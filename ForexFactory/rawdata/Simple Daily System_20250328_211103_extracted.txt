Hello guys! I would like to share this simple but effective system with you. I'm not an author of it but use it quite successfully. Hope for some of you it will give a nice profit specially for those who is not a full-time trader and has only limited time to trade. OK here it is: Buy Rules 1) Daily Charts with 20/50 EMA (close) 2) If price has 3 consecutive days where the Close is higher than the Open and 20 EMA &gt; 50 EMA and the slope of these two emas is positive, on the OPEN of the 4th candle, Initiate a Buy Order. 3) Stop is 2 pips below the previous candle, or 90 pips (whichever is lower) 4) Take Profit is in 2 steps... a) Take half profit at 30 pips and move stop to break even b) Take remaining profit at 100 pips Sell Rules 1) Daily Charts with 20/50 EMA (close) 2) If price has 3 consecutive days where the Close is lower than the Open and 20 EMA &lt; 50 EMA and the slope of these two emas is negative, on the OPEN of the 4th candle, Initiate a Sell Order. 3) Stop is 2 pips above the previous candle, or 90 pips (whichever is lower) 4) Take Profit is in 2 steps... a) Take half profit at 30 pips and move stop to break even b) Take remaining profit at 100 pips This is an easy system because it eliminates many factors that make the novice trader unsuccessful (overtrading, ignorance about how to effectively use indicators, etc.). I would recomend to move your SL to breakeven as soon as possible, 20-30 pips are quite enough. TP levels may differ depending on pair being traded. Say for GBP/USD optimal TP is 39 pips and 80 pips. You have to optimize your TP for each pair you trade. You may paper trate any pair you like and post your results! Thanks to IndyCash for creating backtest tool for SIMPLE. You can find it here and experiment with optimal TP and SL levels. You trade only once a day and it takes about 15 minutes to look over the charts and make your decision. I wish you success and have fun!

Looks good. Definitely good for people who can't watch the charts. Were those results from backtesting or did you actually make the paper trades on those? Do your losing pips reflect the fact that your losing twice as many pips as you are on your winners (ie., you are scaling out half the profit on winners, and you lose 100% on the losers)?

--- 帖子 #3 ---
so always have to wait 3 consecutive days of up or down?

--- 帖子 #4 ---
All pairs are paper traded. Pick up any and compare with your results. Take care, Dimy

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Yes, Price Action rules :

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Is there any specific reason for the 3 bars, Reason i am asking is out of my obverservations i noticed that price on daily charts normaly reverse after 2 - 3 consecutive bars. I counted the bars awhile back and the percentages were less than 50% of continuing after 3 consecutive bars. Unfortunately i deleted the file by mistake. I will try to test after 2 consec bars and compare the results

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Well, if you look closely through James16 thread you can find a lot of examples with 3 bars going in one direction and usually price continue to move in that way. Yes, it may reverse and it should but before that you can catch your first TP level of 30 pips and move your SL to break even. Pick up any pair and paper trade it for a half a year with 2 candles and 3 candles and we can compare the results. This system uses 3 bars as well as price action.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
The Thing, Thanks for sharing the idea and I have a question, Do you consider the sunday candle too?

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Nope, all 3 pairs were tested without sunday candle and i currently trade without taking it into consideration but still results with sunday candle may be good or even better. This method is nicely designed for people who are not able to watch the market all the day long. It takes only 5 minutes to look for setup and place appropriate trades at 00:00 GMT (for me when the new daily candle opens).

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Entered the market: 1) long gbp/usd at 2.0531; 1st target 2.0561 2) long aud/usd at 0.8777; 1st target 0.8807 We'll see..

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Hello The Thing, nice of you to share your system. Thanks. Are GBP/USD GBP/JPY CAD/JPY the only pairs you are trading? If so, what is the reason? One more question: when you say in the stop loss part "whichever is lower" - do you mean lower amount of pips? Thanks again. Pluto2

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Hello Pluto! These pairs mentioned above are the pairs that been tested manually by paper trading. I'm still experimenting with others to find good ones for this strategy. However GBP/USD GBP/JPY and CAD/JPY seem to be most profitable for now. As for your second question..it happens that the range of the 3rd candle which is used for setting SL is not enough for daily trading. 20-40 pips as SL are not suitable for this system and 80-90 seems to be optimal for me. But every trader can make any changes he likes to fit his personality and style of trading. Take care!

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Hi Thing Good looking simple system. Could you just clarify something? If, for example, there was 4 bars with the same open – close relationship, would the last 3 bars be considered a valid setup to enter on the 5th day. Or is the setup just the first 3 bars of each run . I’ll do some back testing, I was just wandering what you did. Ta, again for sharing the system. Yellow

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Hello Yellow, Well, relatively small trading range (doji candles) represents market indecision. On a daily chart, the doji often marks the beginning of a minor or intermediate trend reversal. That is why it's better for me to see a clear picture of a strong trend but not indicision. In real time i'm very careful of such trades and don't taking into account candles with very small trading range. Hope this helps in some way.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Hi Thing, Sorry for the confusion, what I meant by " 4 bars with the same Open - close relationship" was they were all in the one direction ie Close higher the open. There would be an entry on the 4th day (as previous 3 bars all up). If bar 4 also had a higher close then it's open (therefore: bars 2,3 and 4 were 3 consecutive bars where the Close was higher then open), would you re-enter on open of bar 5. Really, what I'm asking is, even if there has been more then 3 consecutive up bars, do you only consider the last 3 bars for a set-up. thanks for patience Yellow

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Ahh, sorry for misunderstanding Yello! There are no re-enter rules! There is only 1 entry rule! So after i have closed my position with profit or loss from previous trade, next day begins and this is my 1st candle i start counting with. If it's what you've been asking - this is the way i'm doing it

--- 帖子 #17 ---
yep, thanks very much. yellow

--- 帖子 #18 ---
thing, are you live with this now?

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Not yet, not yet..Still need more time to demo and get more confident with it.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Just my quick 2 cents. just quickly eye balling the charts, the only time I see a forth or fifth consecutive candle, is when its with the trend. this system has promise trading with the trend. Chris

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Which time do you use for the Open and the Close? Thanks. Hans

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Hi, do you mean break even for the secon half of your position only (in that case, after your Stop is filled, you have +30 pips) or break even for the hole initial position ( in that case, after your Stop is filled, the final result is 0 pips) ? Tia Rem

--- 帖子 #23 ---
My time and time of my broker is GMT +2. So every day i ckeck out the charts at 22:00 GMT or 24:00 GMT+2.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Hello, I open every position with 2 lots. When my TP1 is being hit - I close 1 lot and move SL of second one to BE and let it run for TP2 . Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
AUD/USD first TP of 30 pips achieved. SL has been moved to BE. 2 lot still in play. GBP/USD is -29 pips for now.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
GBP/USD 30 pips locked as profit. Second position still running. 60 pips profit since yesterday. From today i'll be watching only 3 pairs with this system - GBP/USD, GBP/JPY, EUR/JPY. You can find your optimal settings and pairs to trade with. Regards.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Hi TheThing, thank you for sharing this promising system. I think to have understood well the entry/exit rules, so I try papertrading GBPUSD, but my results are quite different from yours. For example, in March I saw +260 pips. Of course I let my trade running if TP/SL has not been hit. Could you clarify me? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
can post a chart?

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hello danyFX, I suppose to think that the defference in our results for March 2007 is due to last trade took place in the end of that month. The setup for entry has formed in March but entry was performed in April actually so i didn't take that trade into account for March. Have a look at the chart and last trade in a blue rectangle. http://img53.imageshack.us/img53/196...yeurusdlp9.gif Anyway, if you're profitable for March you're more lucky than me! That's good :

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Have a look. http://img167.imageshack.us/img167/8...ygbpusdta5.gif Regards.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
If neither the SL or PT have been hit by the end if the day do you close the position(s) out?

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Nope, the only close signal is SL or TP being hit. Anyway, one needs to find optimal settings for SL and TP levels, 'cause 90pips as SL for one pair may be good but it doesn't fit for another one. As well as TP2 for 100 pips is a quite high value for some pairs. I'm searching for optimal levels and will post them as soon as i acomplish more backtesting with this system.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Got it. If appropriate, would you open two new positions with the previous days postion(s) still open?

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Well, if i have my previous positions still running and i want to open a new one i need to look for appropriate setup which means 3 bars with higher (lower) open and close than previous day. Another thing to remember is your MM rules. Say if 1 lot is 1% of your equity and every position opens with 2 lots i don't wants to risk more than 5% of my equity in trade.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Closed GBP/USD second position with 60 pips profit. That's enough for me Opened short GBP/JPY at 249.90 with 2 lots. 1TP achieved - 30 pips; 2TP achieved - 100 pips. So far so good: 250 pips since 19 July. Regards.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
I noticed you said you were trying to find a method to determine TP2 for other pairs. Have you considered using ATR (average true range) for the TP2. One of the advantages I can see is that it is dynamic and would adjust to current market conditions. Something like a ATR(20) Daily, for the most recent price action.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Thanks for your input Scott! It should be a good idea to add ATR to the chart and calculate TP levels in dynamic. Still haven't used this myself, 'cause for now i have only 3-4 hours for watching the market and set my trades. This strategy seems quite profitable after testing it the past and now i would like to see how it works during present days. If i get a good result i'll go live in a month or so with microlots for the start. If one adds price action, fibo or S/R this system should be more profitable for sure. But for now i'm going to stick to mechanical rules. Maybe i'll use only 60pips for TP2 for all pairs and moving SL to B/E after the price has reached at least 20 pips in my direction.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
love the simplicity of your system, but just a little confused as to when you placed your gbp/jpy trade and where you determined your entry. thanks

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hi gnspdr33, Actually, this system is not mine, I'm just a follower My entry point was with the opening of the daily candle (249.92). Short position was opened with 2 lots - TP1 was set to 30 pips and TP2 to 100 pips. Suppose to change my targets a bit - TP1 for 20 pips and TP2 for 60 pips or will be testing it simultaneously.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
thanks for the reply. i think the problem is in the gmt between our charts. i'm using ibfx.how about you?

--- 帖子 #41 ---
My local time and time of my broker is GMT +2 (I'm using NorthFinance due to unlimited demo account). btw, there is no entry setup for today, but it seems tomorrow i'll open 2 positions according to the system: 1 - long on GBP/USD and 2 is short on EUR/JPY. We'll see..

--- 帖子 #42 ---
that's why our entry point was 50 pips different. also, and you may have already answered this, but it seems that you don't use the sunday open bar.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Yeah, that's right, my broker provides sunday candle but i do not take it into account. btw, quickly looking at eur/jpy chart i can't see a single losing trade during the 2007 year..interesting..will paper trade it tonight..

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Hi TheThing, Thanks for your cooperation. I usually use the fozzy method but i was finding other trade methods and i feel good reading Simple Dayly System. I have a question....Do you consider news calendar to check the candles??? Did the news influence over consecutive candle way? Thanks in advance....

--- 帖子 #45 ---
I love the idea of this system. With still working fulltime this could be a great way to get into the game and its very simple from what I can see. The question I have is it dependant on time meaning should we always use 00:00 GMT? I am on Eastern US and it always seems like there is amillion questions about times etc. Looks like most of your testing is always done at 00:00GMT is this also what was back tested and do you change it for any of the summer daylight saving times? Thansk in advance.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
TheThing, so what we're looking for is three consecutive candles with (in an uptrend for instance) an open higher than previous day's open, and close higher than previous day's close? Am I getting it right? What if the open is higher but the close is lower or wiseversa, but candles are still bullish (close higher than open on a current candle) would you consider it as a setup? THank you.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Have you ever tested this idea in other markets? Do you know if it is as interesting in oil or stock indexes for example?

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Hello edgarandreszm, I think we should consider news release days or stay away from trading these days. However all results and trades posted here do not take into consideration news days so news candle is just a candle like during any other day. If i can't stick to my monitor and watch the market all the day long during the news i would stay away from trading or just put a close auto trailing stop of 20-30 pips (FXSolutions allows this). P.S. English is not my native language so if you find i'm not clearly expressing myself just let me know and i'll take another chance to do this

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Hi pintto, Yeah, this system may be good for lazy people or for a fullteime workers I think there is 7 hours difference in our time zones (I have GMT+2 and US seems to be GMT-5). Well, i open my positions at 00:00 GMT with the opening of a new daily candle (it's just before i go to bed)). One needs to check his/her local time and time of broker and enter the market when broker provides a new daily candle. Hope this helps in some way.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Hi masterpiecefx, a good question! I consider not bullish/bearish candles, but candles with higher/lower opens and closes. A good example of this difference can be sunday candles when a candle say is bearish (downtrend) and its open is lower than open of previous day but close is higher than close of previous day. I do not consider such candles. Thank you for your question!

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Nope, for now i'm only sticking to forex market but suppose this system should work in any market where trend and price action take place

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Well, as mentioned yesterday we have a setup today for long GBP/USD and short EUR/JPY. Long GBP/USD at 2.0625; SL 2.0535; TP1 30 pips; TP2 100 pips (testing second variant as TP1 20 pips and TP2 60 pips) For now we have -60 pips (actually -120 'cause position was opened with 2 lots) Short EUR/JPY at 166.19; SL 167.09; TP1 (165.89) 30 pips hit, 1 lot is closed with profit of 30 pips; 2nd lot is still in play, currently +82 pips. Seems like we have a losing trade on GBP/USD but a losing trade is still a trade..We'll see what opening of US session brings..

--- 帖子 #53 ---
GBP/USD is stopped out -90 pips (-180 pips for 2 lots). EUR/JPY TP1 and TP2 hit + 30 and +100 pips. For today: -50 pips. Total (since 19 July): +200 pips

--- 帖子 #54 ---
TheThing In your testing, have you found what the percentage of wins vs losses by taking into consideration of Sunday candles vs not taking them? ET

--- 帖子 #55 ---
You cant win them all but winning more than half is always good. But I wonder if there is some way to tweak it to lose a little less without changing the system too much. Trying to run tests to see if there is a sweet spot for the timing of the new candle. Your 00:00 GMT is my 8pm if I did the conversation right. Although that means you go to bed very late but works out as a perfect time for me well after work.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Nope, i do not consider sunday candles and that's why i haven't performed this test. If from your point of view sunday candles should generate more profit it would be great to test it and share the results with us.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
There should be a way to tweak this system by adding additional indicators or to make it more discretional (compare with current S/R levels, getting confirmations or confluences with price action stuff and etc) but suppose this will mess the system or generate a comletely new system. This technique is as simple as possible and i don't want to complicate it, 'cause often simple things work very well. But if you find a good idea to improve this system and get good results by improving make sure to share it with us

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Thank you very much The Thing, Your words were clear for me. One more thing, You recomended no take in consideration sunday candles, so, i think that your method only can be applied wednesday after close of own candle (considering monday, tuesday and wednesday candles) and thursday after close of own candle (considering tuesday, wednesday and thursday candles)...................is it true??? Bye!

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Glad to hear i can explain smth As for your question it's not quite that way. This sytem allows to enter the market during any day if there was a previous 3 days appropriate setup. Say, we have a setup on thursday, friday, then goes sunday (we ignore it) and then monday (next week). So we enter the market on tuesday (opening candle) as there is no limitation to "transfer" setup through the weeks. Hope this explains smth

--- 帖子 #60 ---
oh I agree 100% simple is best, its always when you go crazy things get messed up. On the other pairs U trade do you always use the same 00:00GMT even for like US/Cad pairs or would you use 00:00 on the originating pair.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
For now i stick only to 3 pairs: GBP/USD, GBP/JPY and EUR/JPY. I always use the daily candle opening time and it's 00:00 GMT for me. If I would like to test other pairs and follow the rules of this system I should use the same time 00:00 GMT for any pairs.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Short GBP/JPY with the opening of daily candle at 247.45; SL 248.34; TP1 (30pips) at 245.15 hit, 1 lot closed and SL of 2nd moved to B/E. 2nd lot still in play and currently + 60 pips (246.85).

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Closed GBP/JPY for total 130 pips profit. No opened trades for today. Today profit: +130 pips Total profit (since 19 July): +330 pips Regards. .

--- 帖子 #64 ---
I only count 2 prior candles meaning today is the 3rd in the ruleset. Looks like you posted your closing message 28 minutes ago and I dont see a new candle popping up anything soon. I think I am setup the wrong way. I am looking at the MT4 spot trader demo info. I am new to looking at this software so maybe I have done something wrong here.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
I think it depends where you started to count daily candles. Look at the chart

--- 帖子 #66 ---
This is what I am showing right now and how do we have different data for the 23rd? I dont mean to be rude or mean I just want to fully understand the system as I love the results you are getting.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Hmm..interesting..I just checked IBFX and it showing the same chart I posted above with NorthFinance..You have a bullish bar on 23 of July..but i have a bearish..weird..

--- 帖子 #68 ---
I pulled a chart on the fxcm FX+ page which I believe comes from netdania and i get same thing, bull on the 23rd. Looking at yahoo chart the exact o/c are a tiny different than what I show but same overall result bull on the 23. I am so confused now lol. Am trying to lookup your source to see if i can figure out whats going on. Anyone else have any clue or how to sync the info?

--- 帖子 #69 ---
I think there is no way to sync the data different brokers providing us As a result we'll have different entries and different gains and losses..

--- 帖子 #70 ---
OH wait I think its getting messed up because of the sunday candles. Look at the difference on my chart for the weekend and your chart for the weekend how they are a bit different. I bet that has somethign to do with where lines are getting drawn at etc. Thats the first divergence in charts as they were exactly the same before that.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
looks like the eur/jpy had a setup and hit also. How does this match up againts your chart?

--- 帖子 #72 ---
i don't thinnk the sunday candle has any bearing on the bars. i trade off a ibfx platform that is different from the thing's. mine shows only 7 red bars including the sunday bars. thing is right you cannot base your entry off of his times. to even get the same open as thing i have to watch for the open at 2100 gmt.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Well correct me if I am wrong no matter where you live 00:00gmt is the same everywhere. If he says he opens at 00:00gmt it should be the same. All the other zones are either + or - of that threw conversion. Change local time but everyone should have the same 00:00gmt. The charts may be drawn a bit different depending on when the charting software starts the day but the entry should always be 00:00gmt according to the rules right? I was trying to figuare out when his software starts the day vs the one I am using. I am new so maybe I am completely messing something up here and I do appoligize if I am. It just may change the results by using different data that isnt giving the same info. Whats the point of using a system that has a great record if you dont have the same tools to tell you directions etc.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Yes, eur/jpy has a setup today but i took a trade yesterday so i have to wait at least 2 full days to enter the market with this pair according to the rules of this system. If you didn't make it yesterday due to differnt counting of daily candles you could entered today. Well a nice move of 200 pips should be yours

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Could you tell your local time and time of your broker? 'cause my time and time of my broker is the same and it's GMT+2 so i have never experienced any problems for adjusting time to trade. If you want to figure out this difference maybe a good idea is to post a chart so we can follow each other and get a solution. I'll post a chart too if it's needed. Regards.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
I am EST and my broker is based out of NY, I use FXCM. I just talked with them and he told me ALL charts should start new candles at the same time, 5pm ends one day and 5:01pm starts the new chart since this is the international settlement time. This is supported by us both having nearly the same lines on every other day except the weekend and the 23rd. He said there can be major differences in pips though based off the relationship the broker has with the market maker but I dont understand how how one is bullish and the other is bearish lol. Does this sound correct according to everyones understanding or did this guy not understand the question either?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
This issue has been discussed at length in the Fozzy Forum, and yes, there can be different times for the beginning of a new Daily candle depending on when the broker begins and ends the trading day. I suggest spending a few minutes reading the posts in this thread; it should make the situation clear and help with choosing a broker based on the Daily candle start time. Enjoy: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=5293

Well, kittiman proposed to count not a 3 candle(bars) formation but 2 and got pretty good results with GBP/USD as he showed in his charts. Today there were 2 successful trades with GBP/USD and EUR/USD as mentioned on Friday. TP1 was hit with these 2 pairs, then my stop was moved to breakeven and then I got stopped out. I have vacation too guys so couldn't post it earlier and now using my PocketPC ) I have no setups for tomorrow with the 3 pairs I'm testing.

Thx for the translation! I thougth that was what he meant but wasnt 100% sure. Did he alos change the tp/sl based off the pair he was trading or just the trend of the pair? Also did you ever figuare out what the sweet spot was or are you just leaving the original 30 then 100 on teh 3 pairs only?

--- 帖子 #89 ---
thing, if you don't trade the sunday bar, then did you put your entry in on friday. thanks

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Yes, he changed sl/tp to 30 or 40 pips depending on strength of the trend. So he uses only one lot and his sl is about 30-40 pips and tp is also 30-40 pips so risk/reward rate is equal 1:1. And he watches and trades more pairs than me

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Nope, i just saw that we have a 3 candles(bars) formation on friday but according to the rules we have to enter with the opening of 4th candle and this should be the beginning of monday. I don't count sunday candle but i can make my entry late night on sunday or very early on monday.

I have a setup of 3 candles with GBP/USD. Long GBP/USD at 2.0324; TP1 2.0354; TP2 2.0424;SL 2.0234

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Forgive me for wading in here for I am just a relative newbie. I really like the look of the results that this method has been producing from such a simple method (yet it is based upon solid empirical data - trends that have three days of movement in one direction tend to continue on a fourth day, ceteris paribus). Perhaps they could be improved further by using a little discretion. For instance, I'm looking at the GBP/USD D1 chart and I see the three bar rule is fulfilled so we would be looking for a good place to enter. However, the 15 min chart shows some resistance at the 2.0330 level (it's at 2.0315 now), and there are candlestick formations that suggest to me that it may go down before it comes up. If we wait and see what happens in the next hour or two it should reveal whether there will be a better opportunity (ie. keep the TP levels the same but enter at a lower price, perhaps move out the SL a little for more breathing space) to enter and potentially haul more pips. How does this sound to you 'Thing'? Update: GBP/USD just fell down to 2.0290. Patience pays!

--- 帖子 #94 ---
OK, I got in LONG on GBP/USD at 2.0297 and closed at 2.0325 for 28 pips profit. I only opened 1 lot so I didn't let it ride, good thing too as it's on it's way back down now - a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush IMO. I think this is a good example how this simple system can be improved - and no doubt could be improved even further by a more experienced trader.

i'm sorry, but the interbank feed for gbp/usd day chart does not have 3 long bars.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Read the whole thread, this discussion has been had before. Depending on where your broker/maker is based, the daily candles will begin at different times. Mine is at 2200 GMT, and I think The Thing's start at a similar time. Interbank is based in the US and so their daily candles will begin and end later than ours so our charts will look different.

TP1 is hit and 30 pips locked as profit, SL moved to B/E.

Hello birdt, Thank you for your attention to this system and a good idea on improving it. Yes, there are many ways to make this method better (as you showed in your example). The more time you dedicate the better results you'll get. But still you need this time. For sure, full time trader should make more profit and consistent profit than a trader who only has about 1 hour a day to observe the market and make his mind on entries. This system is simple and based on trend following idea and nicely designed for people who have full-time job and trade only for several hours. If it works and you can make about 200 pips a month and don't have to sit in front of your PC - i think this system has a chance for a living. The other question is 200 pips per month enough for you? If yes, then just keep it simple. If no, modify it with the knowledge you have and make it 10 times better. As for me 200 pips a month is a good result and if i can get it with this method i would be happy And i'll be happy for you if you modify it make more than 200 pips for yourself! Kind regards.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Yes, results will differ from broker to broker but idea and system should remain the same.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
thank you for the article to help me. let me know how to identify open and close candle. you can stil help me on the margin an stop loss set up.

Hello sogo and welcome to FF community I think the best way to start is to visit babypips resource and attend all the classes in order. It will answer many of your questions! http://www.babypips.com Regards.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
You can have a look at attached spreadsheet (performed by another trader) containing all trades were taken for the year of 2007 and compare with the data your broker provides.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Aye, I can't fault that logic Thing. 200 pips per month for 10-15 minutes work per day (if that) is a good haul. So with the bull candle that we saw today on our GBP/USD charts, are you in again? It might be worth noting for more active traders that the 'filter' is approaching the 'tunnel' using the 1H Vegas method. For those who are not familiar with this method, history has shown that when the filter crosses out of the tunnel, markets often move quite significantly, although not all the time, and not always the way you might expect, but it is a solid strategy nonetheless. For this reason I'll be holding out on this one, plus looking at the candlestick formations I don't think now would be the best time to enter.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Nope, i need to look for the new 3 candles formation to enter again, there is no re-enter rule. Besides, today we'll have news release and one needs to be careful trading on such days. I'm +30 pips in profit with the 2nd lot and maybe i'll close it before the news. 30 pips are 30 pips and don't want to turn winner into loser.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
THING . . . I was looking at your GBP/USD trade setup (-120 pips) . . . note the RED bar for the 22nd . . . and GREEN bars for 23rd and 24th. Could it be that your chart missed the 1st RED bar (23rd) and so . . . we did not have the three bar rule? See picture . . . Like your system . . . thank you! Have been paper-trading it. Looks promising! K http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1186123479

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Hello K, Yes, according to your chart you saved yourself from loss on 23-25 of July but if you look at my post #99 you can see that i have a bullish daily bar on 22 of July so i had to take that trade. The only difficulty with this system i can see for now is the difference in the charts due to various brokers being used. There will be days when i'll have a losing trade but smb will not take it and opposite. But i believe that if this system works it should work with any broker.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Hi, I had a quick look at the backtest results and something look a bit strange for me. When the TP2 is hit the profit is set at 100 pips, but shouldn't it be 65 because you take half at +30 and half at +100 so it is +65 in average. Or did I misunterstood something?

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Is it please EA for your sds? Thx

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Hello, I haven't looked in details at this spreadsheet but only had time to compare the trades and actual dates of them. These are not my results so possibly the author didn't open each position with 2 lots. I'll try to contact him and ask to comment this.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
I'm not a big fan of EA's so haven't found a good one. Regards.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Hi Thing: I guess I am missing something which is very possible since I am a newbie, but I am looking at the performance numbers that you posted and don't understand how they are achieved. If you wait for three days and enter a trade and your second lot is taken out at 100 pips that gives you a total of 131 pips. Then I am assuming you have to wait for another setup to occur before you re-enter a trade. If this is true looking back I don't see where you get more than one or at very most 2 trades per month. Thanks Spent

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Thing, Just a minor observation . . . owing to time differences, reporting times, etc. I truly like this SIMPLE system! So, thanks and congratulations to you for sharing it with us! As it is "new," I suggest that we all paper-trade the heck out of it for a few more weeks . . . to verify that we can do fairly well with it in various market conditions (fully realizing that NO "system" is 100% accurate.) However, if 60%-80% success will produce +200 pips/month . . . and build wealth over time . . . I'm certainly interested and motivated to investigate further! I also urge everyone who is considering "going live" to start easy and closely monitor your trades (money management.) With such large SL's (often approaching 90 pips) . . . just be careful. Also, we should ALL continue to report good, and more importantly POOR trades! If we can analyze what goes right, and what goes wrong, with our trades . . . we can greatly improve efficiency, timing, outcomes, etc. And, with this "system" having so few moving parts . . . we should be able to do that quickly. Well, droned-on enough . . . Again, thanks THING! Great job! Kev-K California - USA (GMT-8) PS: 00:00:00 GMT is 4PM Pacific Standard Time (PST) -- My Local

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Thank you so much for charing this great simple system.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Thanks Kev-K for your interest in this system, 'cause I had a feeling that I'm alone in this tread and it's only me who believes this should work Yeah, SLs are huge, for 2 lots it's 180 pips..so one needs to move SL to B/E as soon as possible, because we hope for 130 pips in profit and risking 180 pips and that means this system should have high win ratio. As for my observation the best TP for GBP/USD is 85 pips not 100 and SL is 65-70 usually enough for daily trading with this pair but still i'm not enough confident to make these changes. One more thing..i'm using NorthFinance for now..knowing it's not a perfect broker for live trading but it's a good one for testing..So my local time and time of my broker is the same and it's GMT+2 and new daily candle opens at 00:00 GMT+2 (22:00 GMT)..so if i confused anyone with this please make appropriate adjustments.. Regards.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Not at all! Hope it will make you some profit! Regards. P.S. If you are going to follow this system please demo it for 2 months to get consistent results before going live. Thank you!

TP2 hit, 2nd lot closed with profit of 100 pips. No more opened positions running for now. Today profit: +130 pips Total profit (since 19 July): +520 pips As for Monday the only pair that has a chance for trading according to the rules is EUR/JPY. But daily candle still not closed so we'll see..

Very good idea of joining the test-team May I ask you smth if you don't mind? 1) How many pairs are you going to watch? 2) Is the example mentioned above considering SL of 100 pips and TP of 40 and 65 pips just an example or are you going to use these values? 3) What broker are you dealing with? This will help me to make a parallel and compare your trades with my own! Thank you! Take care, Dimy

Nice chart Kev-K! What you have marked as "Ooops" is a PB (Pin Bar) and is a well-known element in James16 thread It's long nose pokes out and price telling you a lie about where it is going..So in this example there is a very good chance of LONG trade not short.. Actually the basis of this system meaning 3 candles (bars) in one direction is a part of James price action school P.S. If one needs a good overview of PBs in 2 PDFs files i can attach them here, just let me know.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Just want to say I love the simplicity of the system and this is really a great device for beginners who don't have the time to trade full-time...about the thing you call a pin bar or whatever, may I suggest adding a 50 and 20 ema to the daily charts...what you can do with this is eliminate these pin-bars because they will clearly bounce off the 50 ema (most of them at least), and also the cross on these two ma's will help you trade only with the trend. Just a suggestion...

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Thing, I would like to see your PDF's! And here is my current daily chart for GPB/USD . . . caution is the rule of the day (on paper and even on Monday!) Regards, K http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1186178184

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Thank you mestx41 for a great suggestion! So if we add these 2 ma's to our daily charts we can see that trade on 27 of June was against the main trend as well as PB bounced off the 50 ema There is no way to go short in this situation even if we break the rules of this system..

--- 帖子 #128 ---

On the very last trade setup . . . I do NOT see any meaningful form of "pin bar" (doji formation, etc.) There must have been other "factors" in play to account for the reversal of fortune here. We need to be able (ISTRICTLY In KEEPING WITH YOUR VERY SIMPLE AND SUCCESSFUL SYSTEM) to get a better handle on these occasional events (anti-rule price movements.) Of course, some FOREX trades are nearly impossible to account for (RULE 1: price does what it does.) WHEN, not IF, we formulate an explanation (even a partial explantion) to account for these rare events . . . I will buy a the first round of adult beverages in the Bahamas! I joke, however, your "SIMPLE SYSTEM" is already terrific! And, in its present form, will make ALL followers a TON-O-PIPS! Regards from California, K 8:35PM PST

So far the only real problem I see with this (and many other) strategies...... is the charting time frame.......I trade at Oanda and the chart for the period in post 123 does not show 3 down candles....Oanda charts start a new daily candle at 9:00 PM PDT. Here is a link to net dania charts... perhaps we can use these to coordinate with.....not sure when the new candle forms but the prices seem to stay within a couple pips of Oanda.. http://www.netdania.com/ChartApplet.asp Here are the same time frames post123, Oanda, and Netdania. http://img219.imageshack.us/img219/8...enshot1us5.png http://img451.imageshack.us/img451/6...enshot5yy5.png

Thing I cant believe you think I have left you!! Just testing and compiling. I will say one thing I have noticed is the broker data you use does make a bit of a difference. It may be the feeds ot the few minutes they seem to be off but in backtesting the Northern Finiance feed I get more successful setups. Using the spot demo feed I get less. We have mentioned this before as a possible kink in the system and backtesting has been better with NF than the Spot. Once I have concrete info I will post that but I am glad there are new ideas being thrown around and do enjoy some of them!

I consider the US Non-Farm Payroll release on Friday AM to be a BIG NEWS event. Would never initiate a trade around this time. And it makes analysis of this Wed-Fri SIMPLE setup difficult. However, since we are only paper trading this particular "SIMPLE SYSTEM" (with its rules only) . . . I will stick my neck out . . . Daily shows possible setup for Monday LONG trade - but price in decline last 2hrs of day on Friday (orange vertical 1H - 30 - 15) Pin bar on 30/15 -- Will wait for 1-2 HR on Monday open for better price . . . still think trade will be LONG on Daily (TP @ 2.0440 and SL @ -90) NOTE: THE PROPER 3-BAR SETUP OCCURED Monday-Wed . . . with trade on Thursday.

"NOTE: THE PROPER 3-BAR SETUP OCCURED Monday-Wed . . . with trade on Thursday." Thing, Excellent GBP/USD trade! K

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Let me try to explain myself with the chart.. First of all we have a clearly strong uptrend! So the 1st bad thing we did with our short trade is that we had broken the golden rule of trading - Trend is your friend and trade with the trend! See how 2 EMA (20 and 50) are moving upward and 20 EMA is above 50 EMA. Second, a nice Pin Bar formed on 27 of June (the day before we made our entry). See how it nicely bounced off of the lower side of the channel (blue) and 50 EMA (yellow), protruded through the 38.2 Fib level and bounced off the 50 level precisely! So many confuences that we can say there is a high probability for a LONG trade. Set you buystop when PB is broken with the right eye and almost 100 pips are in your pocket! This is how i see the picture. Hope this can help in some way. Best regards, Dimy

I was just kidding pintto I know there are people watching this thread and possibly testing smth I'll compare NF and InterbankFX (my broker for live trading) charts and we'll see how much the difference is. If you can get the data from other brokers and compare the trades it would be great! Best regards, D.

Thing, For Apples to Apples comparisons, I am going to watch: 1.) GBP/USD, GBP/JPY, EUR/JPY, and AUD/USD 2.) SL 100 - TP1(40 pips) - TP2(65 pips) 3.) FXCM Regards, K

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Great! So one more pair is added to testing basket as well as one more broker (FXCM). I'm trying to decrease my SL and move it to B/E ASAP but seems you're a brave man if to look at SL 100 2 bad trades and -400 pips from the equity (if you're going to use 2 lots). And TP1 as 40 pips seems a bit high..as for me we need to move SL to B/E as ASAP, 'cause we'are risking a lot with such huge SLs. Please, don't get this as critics, it's just my vision over it. That's good that we'are going to test with different settings and values and perhaps will be able to compare our results and find the optimal way. Keep all your good work up! Regards, TheThing

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Hi Thing, For PAPER TRADING AND TESTING your terrific "SIMPLE" . . . I intend to stick with the original SIMPLE system as outlined on Post #1. After all, that is what we are testing/developing (pass or fail) +++++++++++++++++++++++++++ So . . . My BUY rules for purposes of paper-trading/testing: 1) Daily Charts with NO Indicators 2) If price has 3 consecutive days where the Close is higher than the Open, on the OPEN of the 4th candle, Initiate a Buy Order. 3) Stop is 2 pips below the previous candle, or 90 pips (whichever is lower) 4) Take Profit is in 2 steps... a) Take half profit at 30 pips and move stop to break even b) Take remaining profit at 100 pips ADD: EMA8, EMA12, EMA20 and EMA50 (for mkt trend ONLY) ADD: NO SUNDAY BARS COUNT ADD: INITIATE NO TRADES ON BIG NEWS DAYS My Sell rules for purposes of paper-trading/testing: 1) Daily Charts with NO Indicators 2) If price has 3 consecutive days where the Close is lower than the Open, on the OPEN of the 4th candle, Initiate a Sell Order. 3) Stop is 2 pips above the previous candle, or 90 pips (whichever is lower) 4) Take Profit is in 2 steps... a) Take half profit at 30 pips and move stop to break even b) Take remaining profit at 100 pips ADD: EMA8, EMA12, EMA20, EMA50 (for mkt trend ONLY) ADD: NO SUNDAY BARS COUNT ADD: INITIATE NO TRADES ON BIG NEWS DAYS Will move SL to break-even as soon as possible 20-30 pips. TP levels may differ depending on pair being traded. For GBP/USD optimal TP is 39 pips and 80 pips. +++++++++++++++ Remember, I am testing on paper. Nothing I do for several weeks will, IN ANY WAY, be live trading. Too much to learrn about how your SIMPLE three-bar trades work (in differing market conditions, etc.) Further, we may find that it will make us all rich! And, we may find that, with some small tweaks of rules, setups, etc., we can vastly improve your already GREAT system. As we are ALL monitoring pretty much the same CORE pairings (GBP/JPY, GBP/USD, EUR/JPY,) we should ALL arrive at pretty much the same conclusions regarding trades on the 4th day . . . that is, "IF" this system has some internal logic to it. So, as these trends develop over the three days prior to trade day 4 (or not) perhaps, we should report our ideas/observations? Maybe, we can satisfy ourselves of the soundness of this system very rapidly . . . we might also devise additional SIMPLE ideas for the tougher setups. Just my thoughts. We could communicate off-line from this FORUM (e-mail, etc.) However, if people want to keep their work to themselves . . . that's more than OK too! Would like to hear from others on this (pro and con) Regards, K

Kev, I use FXCM also and if you use their charting system, its basically netdania. You should see it flash up as you load their charts on daily+ site. Also I compared those to the Northernfinance data feeds back in the beginning of this system and they gave different results. Just an FYI

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Hi Kittiman, Like your idea about CHF/JPY. The pair looks good for a GREEN Monday . . . or at least more than enough GREEN upside for a profitable trade (beauty of trading longer time frames . . . we have time to react if trade goes opposite . . . i.e., even if the 4th day pair went RED (bar down) on the day candle there is nearly always some upward price component during that day's trade. . . . we could react and "bail-out" of the trade.) The curse of longer-time frame trading is that we have these blasted HUGE stop losses to consider! We are putting condsiderable capital/equity/money at risk . . . so be careful. However, if we are following the SIMPLE rules of this "SIMPLE" system, we have three full days to set-up a good trade (plenty of time to think, ask, post, etc.) NOTE: I know that I won't be shy about asking for opinions/help during the 3-day runup to any 4th day trade!! I hope that others will feel/think likewise!! As for your CHF/JPY trade . . . the day 1-2-3 bars look good and aligned, long term trend lines and EMA's (TL and EMA's) are your friend, strong Pin-bar on day 1 candle, the beginnings of a strong upward channel (off that big green bar at recent bottom.) In short, if I could trade this pair (cant see it on my MT4) . . . I would certainly give it a go for a Monday Long trade at the candle open. If you trade this on Mnday (live or paper) . . . please post a chart of the result (good or bad) . . . so we can all diagnose and learn for next time. How about you be the CHF/JPY Test King!? :-) Many thanks Kittiman! And thank you too, THING!! Warm Regards, K

GBP/USD (!!PAPER TRADE ONLY!!) Tempting . . . PLUS: 3 green bars (nice shape, etc.,) Upward price support from EMA-50, decent positive spread on all green candles (Opens-to-Closes,) Fib's OK MINUS: Friday (last green bar) was U.S. Non Farm Payroll (a BIG NEWS day) And although the NFP numer was anemic . . . it violates one of my cardinal rules for SIMPLE . . . no trades around BIG NEWS days. And its Sunday (dont count Sunday bars.) Therfore, I would not trade this setup for real. However, on paper, as an excercise . . . I would enter a LONG trade: Note: As I write this the local date/time is: Sunday, Aug 5, 2007 - 11:56 AM PST Chart Platform: MetaTrader4 TRADE DATE: Monday, Aug. 6 2007 OPEN: Open price of daily bar (5:00 AM PST :: -8GMT) SL = -90 (move to breakeven "as soon as is possible") ("ASAP") TP1 = +30 TP2 = +100 http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1186339500

Great system Thing. But I would like to throw out something for everyone to consider. I have never been a big fan of scaling out of trades and/or taking profit on the first lot and moving the second lot to B/E. It definitely provides some psychological peace of mind when you hit the first T/P and then you are playing with the markets money. But as I see it, the downside to this approach is that it limits your profit potential (by cashing out the first lot early on - after 30 pips) while exposing you to the maximum loss of 180 pips every time you put on a trade. I do, however, recognize that there are setups that can reliably predict market direction - sometimes for many bars, but most of the time for a short momentum burst in the direction of your trade....after which the market reverses direction and then reverses and stops you out. This type of set up seems well suited for a scaling out approach, since it gets you to B/E really quickly and if that dreaded reversal occurs, you lose nothing. In most other cases, I prefer not scaling out (or in), because it seems to me that you can capture twice as much of the move, instead of 1 and 1/3 of the move, for example. Having said this, has anyone tried simply letting both lots run the whole 100 pips to target #2? I guess the proof in the pudding here would be how many B/E trades you have with the scale out method, compared to letting both lots run the full 100 (or both lots stopping out for a 180 pip loss). What I mean here is that I would consider the B/E trades to have potentially saved you from a 180 pip loss...so the more B/E trades the merrier, as long as you still have a net pip gain. The B/E trades, of course, would also seem to save your account from larger drawdowns, which can erode even the best traders confidence in their system. Two things that I would like to do with this system in my backtesting are: 1. Find what Van Tharp calls the Maximum Price Excursion (MPE) from the entry point for winning trades. In other words, how far do winning trades retrace from their entry point before they take off in the desired direction? I dont care what the MPE is for the losers, since they are losers; only for winners. Its interesting to see the MPE distribution on a series of trades because sometimes you can see...for instance...that you dont even need to have a 90 pip S/L, that the winners have an MPE of around 50 pips. So why give up the other 40 if you dont need to? 2. Find what I call the "max move" that follows each valid signal. For instance, how far does the price move out in the direction of my trade before it retraces...say to the first fib level? Are we catching at least the average max move of these trades by setting a target of 100, rather than 125 or 150 for instance? Perhaps all of these above points have already been considered and are factored into the basis of the system. I am just curious to know how these 2 targets were derived. SLEEK

Good work, kittiman! Can't watch CHF/YEN pair, 'cause don't have it with NF demo account. So maybe you'll be a "Test-King" for this pair as Kev-K said I'll follow 3 bars setups and hope to catch a more strong move than with 2 bars you're testing. This is good that we can compare our trades. Keep the good work up Regards, TheThing

--- 帖子 #149 ---
I'll add one more minus to minuses you have mentioned On 4H chart a PB formed and has confluence with Fibo so I would be very careful with long trade and watch the market closely. In this situation it's not a set and forget setup as for me. Best regards, TheThing

Something was bothering me about the Daily candle answer I received from FXCM . . . So, I spoke with FXCM tech. support again . . . different person. The daily candle for FXCM opens at 5:00 PM EDT (New York) (NOT 5AM) !!!! 5PM EDT - 5PM EDT for NetDania !!!! Do not know about MetaTrader (they could use various data sources) Awaiting reply to e-mail. If we can all use the same charting for the SIMPLE system testing . . we can compare Apples to Apples, etc. Regards, K

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Like your Max Price Excursion concept . . . get's to the heart of our SL issue. If we can determine with some replication (on "good" trades) what the down excursion was (in the traded daily bar,) we could refine our SL to the minimum necessary (plus a tiny added hedge) As for TP levels, I am certainly NOT looking for the BIG kill (would be nice.) I would rather have a reasonably reliable system that produces positive pips on a consistent basis. Over time, financial freedom will come from that too! Regards, K

Great post Slade! Seems like simple things turn into more complicated ones! Kidding This is a very interesting idea with MPE and max move but i can see 2 problems here.. 1) we need more testers join this thread, 'cause in the beginning we needed only to count 3 bars and put our entries but to check your suggestions we need serious backtests and it will take time for sure. I hope that part of FF community interested in this approach will help us in some way. 2) If you have a look at backtest results for this year posted above one can see there were about 80 trades with 4 pairs being tested and only 17 trades with TP 100 were successful (about 21%) while TP1 30 pips was hit almost in 80% of trades. Does this mean that 100 pips as taget is too high for such system? Well..as for my observation with GBP/USD the optimal TP is 80-85 pips not 100 and if we had placed 85 pips TP, our results would be better. I can't say more for now, 'cause time is needed to sink through your post and analyze more data and charts. Thanks for your input! Regards, TheThing

Hi Thing, Great concept for a trading system thread. I hope you do stick to the original concept so anyone with an hour to spare each day should be able to follow it. I do agree this can easily be improved upon.. but as a way for raw newbies to tip a toe in the water of learning trading, this is a great idea. Kudos to you for getting this started! Brad

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Thing, If you can hit 30 pips 80% of the time, thats amazing. Thats a trading system in and of itself. I get what you are saying about the 2nd target, and maybe 100 is even too much. This is also in line with what Kev-K is saying...no need to be greedy here. Maybe you could look to consider an even smaller 2nd target, like 50 or 60 pips. You may have to sacrifice those occasional 100 pip explosions, but if you are gaining reliability and closing out more winners (while reducing your risk of having trades reverse and close out at B/E), I think thats an improvement. In any event, I would not evaluate a system solely by the total number of pips (for 1 contract) that it banks each month. If you think about it, a system that reliably banks 100 pips a month is a gold mine. Once you apply proper position sizing you can trade as many contracts as your account permits, and thus your gains are unlimited (ie. risking a fixed percentage, like 3-4%, on each trade and compounding as you go). Its all a simple function of your account size. Sure, if you start out with a $250 account, it will take you a very long time to be able to live off of the income from the 100 pip per month system; but on a larger account you would be looking at a serious stream of income if you were trading multiple contracts. Sadly though, most (new) traders are drawn to the systems that promise "900 pips per month" and they don't even stop to consider system reliability, robustness, drawdowns, or trade size. For what its worth Thing, I think you are on to something here (even though as you say, its not your system) and I think you just have to keep working it, without complicating it too much... Keep it simple.

Fully agree!! Thing's SIMPLE system . . . is just that . . . SIMPLE! I would never want to tweak it very much! I see so many of the trading systems on this Forum turn into an almost incomprehensible tangle of jumbled MA's, EMA's, Fibo's, Stoch's, SAR's, MACD's, Bollinger Bands, RSI's!! CRIPES!!!!! Makes your head explode! Nope, I will always "Keep It a Simple System" (KISS!) Slow and steady, one trade setup at a time. However, we are on to something special. SO . . . TEST, TEST, TEST.

Kev-K, Yes this one is right lol, I read the other and was like umm no thats not correct. Anyway I also talked with FXCM support and posted it awhile back in this thread. Metatrader is only charting software but you need feeds from brokers for it. Look way up in the begining of this post and there is a link to another post that talks about different sources of data and the times for them. I have MT4 running on two different machines one with the spot trader data which is the same as Netdania and the other with teh northernfinaance, same as thething. The results are different but mostly by a few minutes and the way the weekends are drawn on the two different softwares. Its a free demo so try both out and you will see some differences in the charts. I am interviewing currently so havent had as much time to fully backtest which one is better but there is a slight difference just FYI. All the sources are off by a few minutes and it does involve some final spikes that change candle colors. Hope this helps explain a bit but defintely read the begining of this thread adn look for that link.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
In a few trading classes I have taken that always talk about once you have your price projection plan on cashing out at 80% of that since the last 20% is always the hardest to hit. Maybe we can apply this to that MPE thing you mentioned before. Would be interesting to see what you come up with and that 30 pip stop may move to a 55 pip stop and hit 75% of the time which makes back to the "simple" system again without throwing fib lines etc back into the mix. I dont know much about this MPE thing but will be doing some research into it. Having a set amount for each pair could be nice then when one setups up you set stops for each pair and not just a generic one for all system. Beachbum added an Average true range to another system and it helped target it a bit better.

Hello guys,i'm new one on this thread,so, just want to say that now we are waiting for chf\jpy up-move,am I right? Ok,but i face some problem, i've backtested April and May of 2007 gbp\usd and i didn't get such results as the author speaks. Look at the attach. 1. We have 2 bears candles so,according to the system we sell gbb\usd with SL 90 pips. And we got this -90 pips. 2.We have 3 bulls candles, so acc to the system we buy gbp\usd ang got (max) 335 pips. For April we got 335-90=245 not 550 3. the same...we got -90 4.the same we got +66 The whole -24 ... not -280 Pls tell me ppl what i'm doing wrong, or the author just "paint" this test.Thx

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Yeah, palm trees will wait for us, nowhere to go for them That was a successful trade but I should watch it very carefully as mentioned above. One PB formed on Friday (nose was broken but bears haven't got enough strength to continue downside movement for now), the 2nd formed today, trendline was broken and it almost bounced off the 61.8 Fibo showing good confluence. As a result 100 pips jump down. So daily setup according to the rules of this system formed and we had to go long, but 4H chart showing us the opposite - WAIT! Take a short trade! Some kind of struggle between different time frames.. What I'm trying to say here is when there is such a contrariety of "signals" maybe a good idea is to save ourselves from a huge drawdown of 180 pips and set only 30 pips SL and only 30 pips TP with 2 lots. Well, if you lose you'll lose only 60 pips and it's not a big tragedy while trading daily systems (MM rules and ideas coming soon ) but if you win the trade you would get 2 times more than today. A sharp eye is needed to spot such a contrariety. This is not a new rule for this system. It's just my thinking what should I do in such situation when trading live. Some people like mechanical systems and it's post #1. Some people add discretionary elements..It's all up to you.. Best regards, TheThing

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Hello clapan, I'm not the creator of this system but i'm pretty sure that the author does NOT paint these results posted in post #1. The only problem for now with this system is that with different broker you'll have different results (however can't see a broker with negative gains so far). The backtest posted in post#1 were made using FXDD broker, you're using another broker and I'm with NF for now and will go live with InterbankFX. For example I have 290 pips in profit for April 2007 with NF, you have 245 with your broker and with FXDD you can get whole 550! This is the problem we're looking a solution for. Hope this helps. Regards, TheThing

what does "paint" these results mean?

--- 帖子 #167 ---
If the SIMPLE rules have to be modified slightly (for example, adding the 50EMA or checking the 4-hr chart with some simple analysis) . . . that is one thing. However, if we have to add, and add, and add Fibo's, TL's, etc. . . . well, we might as well go back to the FORUM and pick one of those OTHER complicated methods. My point, the rules of this system (in whatever form they ultimately take) should stand on thier own, with internal logic and some degree of repeatability and positive sucess (50%-60%-70%-80%????) And please know that I am not in favor of a strictly mechanical trading model . . . we have minds and ideas apart from just pushing a button on the 4th bar open! What I am trying to do, and I know others are as well, is to identify a few SIMPLE indicators that will help with our 4th day trades (in terms of overall direction, appropriate SL values and TP.) I hope that we can identify a few, talk about them, evaluate them, and use them to make positive pips. Best regards, K

--- 帖子 #168 ---
"Paint" means that results were just posted spontaneously, say 300 pips for Jan, -500 pips for Feb without actual testing the pairs or with testing but not posting the true results. However I do not share this.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
I share you opinion that simple system should have simple rules. But the only indicator (if it's suitable to call PB an indicator) I used above (the most important) is PB and I haven't seen a better sign of reversal movement. All indicators lags but price doesn't and PB is an price action. However if this makes this simple system too complicated for novice traders (like myself) let's try to keep it as simple as possible. If it gains consistent profit over the time then certainly i don't need any TL, Fibo and other stuff. We need a bad trade to figure out what indicator is able to filter out this losing trade. Looking forward to it : Best regards, TT.

Just for information . . . June-July 2007. If this pair ever trends like this again . . . it will be a good SIMPLE pair to track and watch for. Sorry for the very crummy screen shot of the daily (NetDania.) Until the subprime woes hit the US markets . . . it was presenting some very good SIMPLE system setups (have not looked at the 4HR charts within these apparently good looking daily setups.) http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1186421071

Yes, haven't looked in details but seems there were about 4 successful trades and possibly 1 losing on 30 of June (can't see if SL was hit).

Thing, Just wanted to thank you again for your efforts! I too, am looking for a simple tool (filter) that can add to our succcess on day 4. And when we can identify a couple of easy additional checks/go-nogo's for improving our odds of a good trade (long or short) on day 4 . . . that will be more than fine! A slight improvement is all we need (realizing that no system is perfect and that bad trades will, without doubt, occur!) Perhaps, we could hear from an EXPERT chartist or two . . . what can be done within the basic post #1 rules for SIMPLE to slighty improve outcomes on day 4 trades? (help reduce the potential for a bad trade.) One thing is for sure, if we paper trade enough of these . . . we will find the best possible filter! Kind regards, K :-)

i couldn't get the ea working for this system, so i make the order manually. I trade 3 lots - so I bought 1.5 lots and put a stop loss of +30.. .My question is - How do I make the 2nd half trigger on the +30 target and define the 2nd trade's TP and SL? I use MT4.. Thanks a lot..

--- 帖子 #177 ---
You enter the trade with 2 orders (2 buy or 2 sell). Entry point of 2 orders is the same according to the system's rules. TP1 for order1 is 30 pips, TP2 for order2 is 100 pips (you set this from the beginning). SL for order 2 and 1 is the same - 90 pips. If TP1 is hit move SL of order 2 to B/E. There is no need to trigger 2 trade, 'cause you enter the market with 2 trades/orders (same) Hope this helps.

Anyone watching this pair today/tonight? Would like your thoughts regarding the 3-day bars . . . did anyone take a trade and why? Regards, K

--- 帖子 #182 ---
The only pair that I'm looking at in respect to this method is long in CHF/JPY. It clearly fulfills the three bar criteria but looks to be coming down at the moment, perhaps for a little consolidation retracement, or maybe this could be the end of the move. Yesterday's bull bar was the largest move yet though, so I'm hoping for the former (based on the assumption that this implies there are more bulls in the market right now). I'm going to wait another hour and see what information I can glean from watching the charts. As for some kind of filter to refine the method; looking at the candlestick patterns, price action in shorter time periods, areas of historic support and resistance, pivot point analysis etc are all feasible and may give some clues. They might all detract away from the pure brilliance and simplicity of this method but if it allows us to haul more pips then we're going to have to incorporate it in the most simple way. I think more important right now is the placing of TP and SL points. The 30, 100 and 90 SL - have they been designed with any particular pair in mind? For instance, those numbers are going to be too big for a tight ranging pair like EUR/GBP, and for a volatile pair like GBP/JPY they're probably not big enough. So the introduction of some indicator like ATR that takes this into account is essential IMO. If I have time I may also look into the average 4th day moves (positive or negative) over the last 6 months of EUR/JPY (my favourite pair at the moment - although we may fall out pretty soon), and get some kind of aggregate, see how many pips this pair would have paid out if we'd just opened the position, let it run and closed it at midnight the next day. That will certainly give me a feel for where to put my TP's and SL's. Keep it up people!

--- 帖子 #183 ---
this is some good work, I think I'm going to start paper trading myself to see how successful I am myself. keep it coming. Hey thing, do you still use these rules against the current trend or just in the direction of the trend ?

--- 帖子 #184 ---
OK, it only took me 5 minutes but here are the results of my little EUR/JPY test. In the period starting 7 Feb - 7 August 2007, there were 15 cases where the three day criteria was fulfilled. If I had opened positions in the expectation that the following days would continue in the same direction, I would have closed 10 of those positions at midnight 24 hours later* in profit, which means that 5 were not. Here are the major details of each 'trade': 12/2 - LONG position opened at 158.85, closed at 158.11 for 74 pip loss. 20/2 - LONG open 157.69, close 158.88. 119 pip gain. 28/2 - SHORT open 156.13, close 156.83. 70 pip loss. 06/3 - SHORT open 151.21, close 153.05. 184 pip loss. (Ouch!) 05/4 - LONG open 158.58, close 159.39. 81 pip gain. 13/4 - LONG open 160.63, close 161.30. 67 pip gain. 27/4 - LONG open 162.58, close 163.27. 69 pip gain. 11/5 - SHORT open 161.65, close 162.51. 86 pip loss. 15/5 - LONG open 163.01, close 163.44. 33 pip gain. 08/6 - SHORT open 162.52, close 162.77. 25 pip loss. 18/6 - LONG open 165.16, close 165.89. 73 pip gain 27/6 - SHORT open 165.80, close 165.21. 59 pip gain. (finally a short win) 02/7 - LONG open 166.71, close 166.75. 4 pip gain. 09/7 - LONG open 168.05, close 168.21. 16 pip gain. 25/7 - SHORT open 166.19, close 165.33. 86 pip gain. *I know this isn't the method as set out by TheThing, but we've already cast doubt upon the efficacy of the SL and TP points and this test just shows how powerful this methid could be if we tuned it up a little a) to stop out our losses earlier and b) to leave our profitable trades to run. So, to the analysis of this small set of data. Overall, this method without any discretion would have brought in a 168 pip profit, but an obvious correlation can be seen between SHORT positions and losses, and this is explained by the fact that EUR/JPY was in an uptrend over most of this period (between 7th Feb and 12th July, EUR/JPY moved up by 1000 pips). If we remove the trades against the trend (all short positions up to 25th July - at which point EUR/JPY had began to lose pips rapidly, forcing us to rethink the assumption that the pair was in a strong uptrend), the pip haul would have been 474 pips, with 10 trades, 9 of them winners. And there, my friends, is indisputable evidence as to why we should never trade against an established strong trend with this method.

As we ALL have time . . . can everyone involved in testing, paper trading, etc. this system please post: 1.) What charting software they are using. Its perfectly OK to use ANY other charting software you wish for other systems, but for "SIMPLE" we should try to merge down toward one common package. If possible, and by majority rule, maybe we can arrive at one service that will better allow us to compare apples-to-apples, etc. I am certain that we can use a free service for our simple requirements (another advantage of "SIMPLE!") 2.) The name of your broker (voluntary of course) 3.) Your local time zone 4.) GMT for you 5.) The pairs that you are monitoring/testing/etc. I will compile the data and write it back to this Forum. For the newbies to this group: In short, we are experiencing great difficulty in getting our daily charts to look the same. It makes it very difficult to communicate and share ideas about improvements to SIMPLE. These discrepancies are due primarily to the following: 1.) The data sources (quote vendors around the world) that feed our various charts are different. 2.) Candle open times for our various brokers are ever so slightly different (the times when a candle opens and closes are slightly different.) If there is any other information that needs collecting . . . sound off anyone! Realizing, of course, that all such requests are STRICTLY VOLUNTARY!! I think we can rapidly develop this system into a HUGE SUCCESS if we can: 1.) All get on the same page (same chart, candle opens, etc.) 2.) Begin to look at the same data (apples-to-apples) 3.) Use the terrific talent of the many fine folks on this forum to test and develop SIMPLE 4.) Share ideas . . . and results . . . then test those (be forewarned, many of my ideas will be wrong and just plain old-fashioned STUPID!) :-) 5.) However, out of many dumb ideas will come one, two, or three STELLAR &amp; SIMPLE additions to "SIMPLE" . . . then to the stars!! (More than it already is!) THANKS THING!!! Regards, K

That's a great system... I traded a wrong pair (eurgbp) and still got papery 400$... That's not bad for a off-the-system trade. But even if you trade regular pairs, just from looking @ my chart I see that this system can catch some very good movements!

Thank you for posting your backtest results with this pair and your suggestions! Appreciate all of this After a long overview of your results I would like to share my 2 pips worth ideas and suggestions for this system. 1) Look at your first trade on 12 of Feb (charts attached below). Your backtest starts on 7 Feb and ends on 7 of Aug and the first candle you took into account was on 7th of Feb. However you can see that on 6 Feb was also a bullish candle and if you had started to count bars from 6 of Feb you profit would be 130 pips not a loss. But why you should start to look for the 1st candle on 6 Feb? Because we are here to catch and to follow the established trend with this system. We call it established when we see 3 candles formation. BUT..Do you have a good chance for profit when you jump in the middle of the trend movement? I think not that good if you were to catch the beginning of the trend. It's only 20-30% of the market condition when a good trend is observed and everything other is ranging and chaos. Like an example say you're going to take a bus..what are your chances if you try to catch it standing in the middle of highway? Not so many, because highway is a place where cars move with 100 m/h speed and you'll catch noone. But what are you chances if you go to the previous bus stop just before highway begins? I think you'll get a bus very soon. Trend is just like highway for me so it's crucial to jump in as early as possible and always look for the previous days and not start trading in the middle or in the end of the trend. 2) The 2nd suggestion I would like to make is DON'T TRADE AGAINST THE MAIN TREND. How to define a main trend? You guys have suggested to add 20 and 50 EMA so trade only long when 20 ema crossed 50 ema and now 20 ema is above 50 ema. Take a short when 20 ema crossed 50 ema and is below 50 ema for now. And now look at my charts with only these 2 suggestions. The same period of testing, the same pair, the same broker. There is NO a single losing trade over a period of 7 months! Show me the similar system It's not about how many pips you made! It's about what is the max DD! However if to follow the original rules of this system and open 2 lots and set appropriate TP's and SL's and close only when TP or SL is hit, the results of 7 months of EUR/JPY testing is from 440 pips in profit to 640 pips in profit without a single losing trade! Think about it..how many pairs are there All montly charts attached below!

I have a live and demo FXCM account . . . like them very much, however their internal charting is clunky and funky! I have always used MT4 for charting (but there again, MT4 uses a non-FXCM data source . . . so the charts look different! UGH!) Birdt, Pinnto, Myself . . . have aggreed, for purposes of testing SIMPLE, to open/use a North Finance demo account (example: they have MT4 charting, demo account never expires, +2GMT daily bar open.) Once we refine our techniques for SIMPLE trades (the stop loss issue is critical and will vary by pair traded) we can then go back to whatever live account we wish to use in our private lives. What do you guys and gals think about agreeing on a standard DEMO account? I am hopeful that THING will join us (can't thank him enough for SIMPLE!) By the way, I bet he's already on lying on a beach somewhere! :-) Warm Regards, K

The U.S. Federal Reserve Board meeting now (Tuesday afternoon EDT in U.S.) to set U.S. interest rates . . . an example of a BIG news day??? Interesting to see the effect on USD pairs (if any. Depends on what action they take.) Consensus seems to think that they will not change rates, but who knows. K As I write this note it is: 10:28 AM PST my local time (-8GMT)

Absolutely TheThing, the dataset that I used began on the 7th. If I had included the 6th (as I should have) then it would have been 100% successful! It might not have produced that many pips over 6 months compared to other systems but with that sort of probability of success (no doubt this was an exceptional period), I would feel confident enough to risk a substantial amount of capital allowing me to make big profits. Now I've looked over the data I must admit this is getting pretty exciting. Shall we order the Bahamian brochures already?

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Hehe Bahama is good but more backtesting is needed and then live trading ahead and only then Bahama A good thing to do is to test other pairs using the same broker (NF) and same time period (FEB-AUG) and see the overall performance and use only this filter for now (20 EMA+50EMA). I am going to test GBP/USD today for this period and later will post the monthly charts with my results so you guys can compare and check out. So if anyone else is going to perform the test - please pick up another pair - GBP/USD is mine : P.S. Yep, EUR/JPY showed no losing trade over 7 months..still can't believe..

--- 帖子 #205 ---
I will try to help you guys out. I haven't read the full thread yet. I maybe will. Right, to the point.. Northfinance (I suppose that's the brooker TheThing means). USDCHF FEB --&gt; AUG 12 possible trades. 6 not with trend (not accounted for). 6 with trend. (Possible Reward ** Risk) 1. No profit 2. +25 ** -85 3. No profit (OR trade it for a couple of bars with .. +65 ** -85) 4. +130 ** -20 5. +65 ** no risk 6. no profit. Lets assume a SL of 90 pips and a PERFECT TP. -90 +25 +65 +130 +65 -90 total: +105 THEN SL of 90 (don't know what sl you guys use) and 1 lot TP 30 then move to B/E and second lot TP 100. -90 -90 +30 +130 +30 -90 total: -80 USDCHF in the period FEB-AUG is according to MY testing not a good pair. Hope I was to any help. EDIT: NEVER MIND THE ABOVE PLEASE! KINDA SCREWED UP...

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Thank you zunk for your efforts! Really appreciate your help with testing! However I got a bit different results. Total Trades : 6 Winners: 6 Loss: 0 Total profit: +280 pips. Have a look at attached charts and if somebody got a question regarding trades - please ask. I haven't put in much details the charts like previous ones. Rules were the same as in post #1 + trend following.

Nice work. USD/CHF looks OK to me. To decide upon which way a pair is trending, I use a 5 period simple moving average applied to close on a weekly chart (borrowed from Vegas 4h tunnel method), I find this cuts out the whipsaw and is still responsive enough to identify trends without too much lag. Quite simply, if the gradient of the SMA is positive, I will consider any LONG trades, and only SHORT trades if it is negative. I will look into backtesting the GBP/JPY tonight. I expect similar results to the EUR/JPY, but it's worth looking into. GBP/CHF will be next on my 'to do' list. The only pair that qualifies on my charts tonight is EUR/GBP. This pair is flat and quite frankly pretty boring. There also is some historic resistance in the area and the candlesticks have got long wicks suggesting to me that they may struggle to breach that level so I'll be leaving this one alone. As a note, this pair is one of the least volatile and I really don't think the 30/100/90 points are appropriate.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Gosh! Thats amazingly stupid of me. I guess I will have to read the thread more thoroughly and try it again. Sorry man! By the way, this is correct right? 1. Determine trend with 50EMA and 20EMA. Up slope, long. Down slope, short. 2. when 3 consecutive bars are shown go long/short on the open of the next one IF trend is right. SL: Don't know. TP: 1 lot 30, then B/E. 1 lot 100. EDIT: Again. I apologies. Now when looking back on the chart, and following along with yours I'm kinda concerned about my mental state. HAHA! Guess I've been staring and those things longer than I can take for one day. Again I'm sorry. I will study this thread tomorrow and maybe do another backtest with one of the pairs you've backtested to see if I can get the hang of it Thanks

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Will check 5SMA tonight, thanks! Well, at EUR/GBP chart 20 EMA is going to cross 50 EMA, but it's not above 50 EMA for now. It may be a successful trade but if to strictly follow the rules (I'm talking about 20+50EMA not 5SMA) this trade should be passed. If you have some time please post your results with the charts so we can see and compare. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #215 ---
No worries man, we all make mistakes sometimes Yes, you're right and SL is 90 pips and we open the trade with 2 lots with TP1 of 30 pips and TP2 of 100 pips (Too high for some pairs like USD/CHF but will be back to this later). Once TP1 is hit move SL of 2nd lot to BE. Yes, and always follow the trend

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Again, I have not used any TP or SL's on any of the hypothetical trades, just reporting the activity of the bar following the three bar setup. This time I did not place any trades against the trend. GBP/JPY was in a strong up-trend during much of the period, up until round about mid-July, where it gave up 1000 pips within a few days. During this down period there were set-ups that would have been considered but whether these would have been taken is debatable. 21/2 LONG open 234.62 close 236.29 - 167 pip gain 22/3 LONG open 231.60 close 231.92 - 62 pip gain 13/4 LONG open 235.79 close 236.81 - 102 pip gain 30/4 LONG open 238.18 close 238.94 - 76 pip gain 18/5 LONG open 239.53 close 239.14 - 39 pip loss* 24/5 LONG open 241.65 close 240.92 - 73 pip loss 20/6 LONG open 245.32 close 246.23 - 91 pip gain** *2nd bar (16/5) of the 3 bar formation was a doji closing just 2 pips higher than open. Technically this fulfills the rule but perhaps some discretion may have led us to not place this trade. **However, on the 18/6 we saw a similar situation which would have led to a profit. It is my suggestion that only those who are willing to tolerate a little more risk take these trades, those who are not should wait for the 'A' trades. So, by my reckoning, if we had employed this strategy over the 6 month period only placing LONG trades when the 3 bar setup was observed, this strategy would have yielded 386 pips with 8 trades, 6 of which being profitable. If our indicators signalled that the trend had reversed early enough and we allowed the placement of a SHORT trade, we could potentially have doubled our haul. Using the 50EMA, the gradient became negative around the 25th or 26th. If we'd got in on the 27th, we'd have picked up 314 pips on that SHORT trade alone.

If we allow for my judgement call in early May (anti-trade - no trade) . . . February: 3 good trades March: 3 good trades April: 0 trades May: 1 trade (and one anti-trend - "no trade" my call) June: 0 (a tough month for trading AUD/USD with SIMPLE - trend looked so good too) July: 2 good trades More importantly . . . NO POOR TRADES! Amazing! Gotta admire that! I have not compiled the gains/losses yet . . . however the basic RULES of SIMPLE are working just fine!!! . . . more than fine!!! And, we are staying away from crummy trades! Will complie the numbers in the AM (my local time) However, even taken qualitatively, the AUD/USD pairing looks to be more than acceptable for SIMPLE. In my estimation, we can add this pair to our list of profitable pairs to track and trade in the future. Time for a siesta in California! Warm Regards, K

hello people, this one amount is made with an automatic translation program since English is not my mother tongue so be merciful with me. trading 08.08 gb/usd can be so terrible with a small trader live this. 3 got in at this contrary to my own ones regulate, I in cash, at least made up my mind in the gb/usd according to the second strategy traded by me this morning to set a sell limt at 2.0223 with sl 2.0253. at the gb/usd I am this after an own analysis of the opinion better it is to get in at the third bar (see pictures tread 83). but I my own regulate fallowly, did not get in and missed the beautiful downtrend (form 1) which had been possible for +30 pips. so I traded my second strategy, which one, today, I a sell limt position opened upside trend (form 2) and have my sl auslöste.ich short time later so thrown out of 60 pips to the fenter within the 30 minutes. result: breaks your own never regulate and you will gain breaks now a beer with sorrow drink. kittiman

--- 帖子 #227 ---
I wouldn't say we have enough data, or the data we have is not analysed enough anyway. What about SL, TP for each pair? I don't think we (or I should say YOU guys, since I haven't contributed yet ) come up with anything there? I will do some own testing now and get back to you guys.

Here are GBP/USD backtest from 1 Feb to 7 Aug with NF broker. Total trades: 10 Winners: 9 Losers: 1 Total profit: +790 pips. As for the losing trade..As you can see on the chart (March) this trade was not so clear as others because 20 EMA just crossed 50 down and we entered the market. But rules are rules and we have to follow them..If we didn't take that trade overall profit for this pair would be 970 pips.

So here are results for 3 pairs being tested in this thread by myself for a period of 1 FEB - 7 AUG. EUR/JPY Total trades: 8 Winners : 8 Losers: : 0 Total Profit: +460 pips. USD/CHF Total trades: 6 Winners : 6 Losers : 0 Total Profit: +280 pips. GBP/USD Total trades: 10 Winners: : 9 Losers : 1 Total profit: +790 pips. Total profit with 3 pairs: +1530 pips Average monthly profit: +255 pips. As I can see for now simple things work sometimes..sometimes they work even in Forex..sometimes they produce better results than much more complicated systems.. I know there are systems that show good results in the past and stop working in present or with live trading. I don't want to convince anybody that this system works or not, 'cause for some of you it could be suitable for some maybe not..This is a daily system so if you happy with 1-2 signals for month (with 1 pair) - that's good. More active traders would like to see more action and get more adrenalin and not to wait and pray for 20/50 cross I'll perform more backtests and find other pairs with positive or negative results. I'll try to find optimal TP levels for different pairs, 'cause 100 pips TP for USD/CHF is a funny thing I can see that this simple system can catch big movements and nicely protect us from entering in ranging market. I like this system. Best regards, TheThing

--- 帖子 #236 ---
hello TheThing I was wondering when you count candles to signal entry...do you count a candle that has the same open and close price, or do you start all over? I personally don't see any harm in doing so, especially if it's in between two bearish candles in a down trend or two bullish candles in an up trend? what you think?

--- 帖子 #237 ---
See post #216. When looking at the GBPJPY, there were two 3 bar formations where the 2nd bar was a doji (open close within 2 pips). One was a winner, one was a loser. I wouldn't consider these to be A trades, because they show that there is indecision in the market. From what I have seen the system follows the momentum when there is a strong decisive move in the market. I would suggest that all three bars be moves of at least 10 pips (perhaps more or less taking into consideration the typical range) in one direction to qualify as an A trade, although I'd like to hear other testers experiences and opinions. Current chart formations: EURCAD shows three consecutive bear bars on Marketiva, but looking at recent history there have been two very similar formations that would not have paid off. I'm going to wait and see what happens with this one. EURCHF looks good with three bulls and in an uptrend. I might take this one. GBPCHF has got a formation with two bull bars surrounding a doji. Looking at the circumstances (strong uptrend, filter within Vegas 1h tunnel) this is definitely worth keeping an eye on. USDJPY is also showing an interesting formation although the yen crosses have been so crazy lately that I would approach this one with extreme caution.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
I've thought about how we should calculate/test different TP and SL levels. It can probably be done with backtesting and/or forwardtesting but as smjones said a while back using ATR will probably do. I'm just thinking out loud here... Right now ATR(20) for GBPUSD is 115, 27 days ago it was down to 62 pips. That may be a bit little, especially since your testing at the moment is based on 30/100-90. But then again, it's low because the daily range has gotten lower so for the same reason we now apply EMA's to confirm trend I think we should look into this abit deeper. Now I'm just gonna spew out some rules I'm going to test with, I'll do it with USDCHF first. TP1 : 25% of ATR(20) TP2 : 90% of ATR(20) SL : 80% of ATR(20) AND as I said, this is just numbers I thought of first. ALSO, I don't know if you guys are zooming in on the 1HR bar to see how a trade really goes. I mean, a bar can go up, then down, then up. At all potential trades one should mark the bar with a veritcal line and then zoom in on 1HR to see if it all goes thru well. We shouldn't be fooling our selfs. Now, you guys maybe already be that smart, but i would probably not have done it if I didn't think of it right now USDCHF, above rules. FEB-AUG. 6 trades. 1. TP1: 20 TP2: 73 SL: 65 --- Both TP hit. +93 2. TP1: 20 TP2: 71 SL: 63 --- TP1 hit. Then B/E +20 3. TP1: 20 TP2: 73 SL: 66 --- This one went straight for our SL -132 4. TP1: 18 TP2: 63 SL: 56 --- Both TP hit. +81 5. TP1: 15 TP2: 53 SL: 47 --- Both TP hit. +68 6. TP1: 14 TP2: 51 SL: 45 --- TP1 hit. Then B/E +14 TOTAL: +144 Not as much as with standard rules BUT this was just a shoot from the hip from my part, to demonstrate why the ATR can be of real benifit to us (I think). What I will do tomorrow is tweaking these level abit (higher TP1 springs to mind immediatly) etc. It's getting late here, I will soon go to bed. Will focus more on this tomorrow. Thanks again for your hard work TheThing (and everybody else!)

GBP/CHF results were not as good as I'd hoped, but it has taught me something important about this system. 23/2 LONG open 2.4218 close 2.4207 - 9 pip loss 22/3 LONG open 2.3792 close 2.3850 - 58 pip gain 02/4 LONG open 2.3895 close 2.4032 - 37 pip gain .....and then we had two trades where the opens on second/third candles were not higher than the first candle. If they had been taken, the following days were a 72 pip loss, and then a 123 pip loss - now I understand why that rule in post #1 is there. ......then we had another formation where one of the bars was a doji, only 2 pips between open and close . The movement the following day was 144 pips down. The evidence is mounting to suggest that these formations should be rejected. 24/5 LONG open 2.4388 close 2.4368 - 20 pip loss 13/6 LONG open 2.4530 close 2.4553 - 23 pip gain 19/7 LONG open 2.4649 close 2.4655 - 6 pip gain For a total 95 pip gain over the period. There were a lot of marginal calls that the more greedy of us might have taken (MA was pretty flat so trend undecided, dojis, opens of bars weren't higher than previous bars), which predominantly would have resulted in losing days. The moral of the story is if the criteria isn't filled 100% with this pair then leave it alone and live to fight another day. I know the data that I'm providing is a little different to the others because I'm not using TP or SL points, but I can tell you that they would not have worked well with this pair. Also worth taking into consideration is the high spread that most brokers charge on this pair, as much as 8-10 pips. All in all judging by this relatively small sample of data, unless this pair was in a strong trend and the setup was perfect I would probably keep away from it with this method.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
just one thing, I'm confused about were we put our stop loss...how do we calculate where SL should go. far as i know is suppose to be 90 pips or 2 pips lower of the previous candle whichever is lower, well what do we take from the previous candle to get the sl ?

--- 帖子 #241 ---

Based on the limited pairs and limited testing we have done . . . SIMPLE is just shy of AMAZING! However, I do feel that before any of us "bets the farm" on its use in live action, we should continue to TEST and EVAULATE. (with healthy skepticism and clear, rational heads.) For example, we should try to refine, for the 4-5 pairs tested since Feb. 2007, what might be more appropriate SL's and TP's (realizing that they too will likely be 1st-pass numbers - subject to furhter revision.) However, it is clear that "one size" does not fit all pairs. Gents, we are on to something here . . . no idea as to why it has never been noticed before (to my limited knowledge.) However, there is definite tendency on this FORUM (and Forex in general) toward ever more compressed time scale trading and ever more complex charts filled with indicators, triggers, stats, graphs, charts, etc. So to, most people are entirely focused on trading the 1M, 5M, 10M, 15m, 30M, and at most 1HR charts! . . . they would never dream of sitting in wait for a DAILY three-bar trade to develop! Also, at our time-frame (the daily bar) the "rules" may be different and far more "predictable" (dare I say SIMPE!) :-) when compared to 1M-60M micro-scale. Wonder what happens at the Weekly and Monthly scale?? :-) Just my two-cents worth! OK if I'm wrong or sound silly . . . we need ALL ideas and ANY thoughts here! Keep up the fine work guys! And, if we are even 80% correct with what we have already seen with SIMPLE . . . I'll buy the 1st round in the Bahama's! :-) Warmest regards to ALL around our beautiful globe tonight, K PS: Thanks for compiling the numbers for th AUD/USD pair!

Wow, I'm absolutely blown away by those AUD/USD figures. Following on from what Kev-K said about why this sort of system isn't in widespread use (that I know of), read the following excerpt from the Vegas 4h tunnel intro: See the parallels? Everyone else is trying to pick the tops and bottoms, I've been there. Unless you've got a crystal ball, all the indicators in the world aren't going to get you the percentages that we're witnessing. Every day I waste 30-40 mins reading through some tosh about how GBPUSD is definitely going down to 2.00, the Yens are going to bounce back next week etc. but the truth is that they're just guessing - and people wonder why the failure rate of FX traders is so high.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Thank you Zunk for your efforts and testing this SIMPLE with ATR! ATR can definitely help us to determine the optimal values for TP and SL. As for your question regarding 1 H TF.. you can see on the chart I've put +30/+130 marks and that means either TP1 or TP2 was hit but was the TP2 hit after moving our SL to B/E? That should be checked but I wanted to know the worst scenario and always calculate gains with less profit (with 30 pips not 130 in this case). Keep all your good work up!

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Thank you for putting your eye at this pair! Haven't looked at it in details but from the fast view of it I can that 23 Feb and 24 May was not a losing trade if to trade with original rules but successful trade. Haven't looked more because bad trades are more important for more for now. That's good you perform testing with your little twist of this system and you close you position on the next day and this allows you to watch the market only once before the new daily candle starts. I'm working on indicator for this system and it'll send an e-mail when TP1 is hit so there will be no need to watch your trades for the whole day to move your SL to BE and take your TP1. This will take time (cause I'm not a PRO at programming but have experience and skills for it). Best regards, TheThing

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Yes, IndyCash, you got it right, you followed the rules posted in post #1 + 20/50 EMA rule added later. Thank you for posting your charts, 'cause it's easy to follow your trades! This pair will be definitely in my trading basket. I'm starting to love this SIMPLE due to extremely low "lose" ratio. We tested 4 pairs for the period of 6 months with charts provided (EUR/JPY,GBP/USD, USD/CHF, USD/AUD) and there were 32 successful trades and only one losing.

hello people, baking test for chf/yen regulates: according to my thesis got in at the third bar sl 75 pips tp1 +30 tp2 +100 sl is at drawn on tp1 by tp1 reach for second position not has checked jetz how often second position would have run like +30 pips more highly whether ts is worked with here therefore to gain a maximum profit everybody must decide for himself. kittiman

TP1: 25% of ATR(20) TP2: 100% of ATR(20) SL: 50% of ATR(20) USDCHF 2005 DEC --&gt; 2007 JAN (Just random sample. no agenda here ) 14 trades. 1. TP1 +30 2. TP1, TP2 +150 3. TP1, TP2 +150 4. SL -116 5.

TP1 +14 TOTAL: +121 Again, this may not seem good because TheThing got +280 on the same period with original rules. The ATR thing may prove to suck, but I will test it on another pair with above settings and we'll see how that goes. (I'm writing in a document and will posts later on). One thing I think ATR rules will do for us is we'll be able to do this on more pairs simultaneously, not just a few majors. If one should look at my above results. They are not Bad. Not at all, I think. AND, if the ATR(20) can be applied with the same rules on all pairs (or, many pairs) I think a bit less profit should be worth it.. Further backtesting will prove the usefullness of ATR(20). More to come. GBP/USD 1 FEB - 7 AUG 10 trades (The Thing; Your losing trade in march shouldn't be a trade. It's against the rules. We have three red bars. The third is the bar we make our decision on. It's the third red, it's a sell signal. Now look at the EMA's above the third, They're buy. So no play. No loss. This must surely be correct right? Or am I making an ass out of myself again? hehe) 1. TP1 +32 2. TP1, TP2 +128 3. TP1, TP2 +120 4. TP1, TP2 +88 5. TP1, TP2 +99 6. TP1, TP2 +90 7. TP1, TP2 +90 8. SL -80 9. TP1 +20 10. +125 TOTAL: +712 Again, not as good as original rules. But nice profits with same rules on two diffirent pairs. And a smaller SL which seems to work quite good. Maybe a bit to small. But since we're raking in those TP1's I don't think it's an issue here. A bigger SL would have kept us profitable in the only losing trade above. BUT, it could have gone any way. Smaller SL, less risk. Now I'm gonna take a mini break and then test this on an other pair. EDIT: Excel chart added

thanks ZUNK, silly me ,should have checked my dates,another question please,do we wait a few hours at the open of the 4th days candle before opening a trade or do we going in immediately at 0000hrs, thanks again

--- 帖子 #262 ---
TheThing uses a Metatrader 4 demo from NorthFinance, and he's opening the trade when a new Daily candle appears. Beware that this system is still in test phase. But things sure look promising.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Hey Thing, I'm newly registered on this forum, though I've been lurking for weeks. Your thread caught my attention the other day and I've found it to be full of promise. Well done! I had a brainstorm about the method this morning that I'd like to share. Rather than enter immediately on the open of the fourth candle, why not place a Limit order 5 pips above or below the open in the direction you want it to go, and then watch it for movement. If it takes off right away in the direction you were hoping, you give up the 5 pips, no big deal. Now, if it goes in the wrong direction, a retracement, then you've saved yourself some pips, and here's how you handle it. You follow it by moving your Limit order to always be 5 pips above wherever the price is currently at, until one of two things happens. 1) the retracement finishes and then comes back up or down the 5 pips triggering your Limit order, at which time you enter a Stop Loss according to post #1's rules or 2) the price hits the Stop as determined by post #1 of this thread, in which case you CANCEL the order without having lost any pips. I think this refinement would save a lot of pips. All this is doing is keeping the Stop in it's original place, but it is requiring discretion on the entry. As such, it will be hard to backtest this theory, and it would require constant monitoring at the beginning of each day until you get the entry you are looking for. I'll give an example. You get your three daily candles in a row going UP, and on the fourth day the open is at 1.3800. You enter a Limit Buy at 1.3805 and then watch the price. You set your stop mentally at what it should be according to post #1's rules (3710 if you use 90 pip stop). If price immediately goes to 3805, your order is triggered and you enter the stop and play the trade. Now let's say instead the price drops to 3790. You would move the Limit Buy to 3795. Let's say it keeps going to 3770. You move the LB to 3775. Now let's say it turns around and comes back up. Your LB is triggered, now you enter the stop that you had mentally recorded (3710). The stop is always determined at the beginning of the day. Now, if the price had continued to plummet and never triggered the LB, once it reached 3710 (if you're doing 90 pip stop) you would cancel the whole order, and start over.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
It sounds like a good idea and as you said, it's a real pain to backtest. Plus, I think it's kind of rare for the price not to move in both directions. I mean, the price may go down, but in between the down going it'll probably go up a bit (5 pip? probably) and then continue down, and up abit, and down more. And so on. What I'm trying to say is that 5 pip is not enough to aknowledge the end of a retracement. One could use more pips, but then the system is not anyway near mechanical anymore. I think one must be a very good and experienced trader to accomplish something like that and I know I'm not anyway.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
ok ZUNK thanks

--- 帖子 #266 ---
agreed on the 5 pips. maybe use 8 or 10? but the main point is to save you from losing a lot of pips on the possible about-face movement on the fourth day. if it plummets on the fourth day and never looks back, this would save you from ever entering the trade, and if it does turn back around in your favor, you enter the trade on a discount.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
to see what I'm saying, look at the EUR/CHF chart. It was perfectly set up with three bars, so I entered the trade mechanically at the open last night and lost my shirt on demo overnight. this was one of those times where this system failed miserably, and this enhancement would have saved those pips. and looking more closely, it would have needed a 10-12 pip buffer to work properly.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
I can see what you mean. But be aware that this wouldn't have been a trade since the EMA's (EMA50, EMA20) has crossed and are pointing down. This trade was against the trend. The system has evolved from the original at the first page. We've added EMA's so we can just trade with the trend. But at times like that on the Euro one could really use something like you said. Or we could just stay out of major news announcements like these.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
eur/jpy hi thing,why was it a no trade on 26th of july,the fourth bar was in line wit the trend,please corect me if i am wrong thanks

--- 帖子 #270 ---
ah yes, the 20/50 ema would have worked wonderfully as a filter last night. lesson learned!

--- 帖子 #271 ---
okay, forgive me, my mind is on overdrive with this. here's a simpler way of things... how about entering the trades on the fourth day with a Limit Buy placed 3-5 pips above the High of the day 3 bar? this is mechanical, and protects against sudden price reversals and ensures price is moving in the direction you want it to before entering...

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Please take a closer look again. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=199 The 26th is the fifth bar going down, but look at the EMA's, they're suggesting an up trend. Therfore, no trade. I maybe was unclear in another post just recently about the EMA's. It's the CROSS that matters, note the SLOPE. Sorry about that

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Do you think you can do some backtesting and present your results on that one?

--- 帖子 #274 ---
okay, using USD/CHF from March 2007 forward... making sure trade is in line with the 20/50 ema and I'm not counting Sunday bars. Start with 2 lots. Stop is placed 90 pips away from my Limit entry. after 30 pips profit, 1 lot closed, 2nd is moved to b/e. 3/14 - the 3rd consecutive down bar closed at .2168, low was .2100. so on 3/15, the fourth bar, entered a Limit Sell of .2098. order wasn't hit until the next day 3/16 and 30 pips profit taken that day on one of two lots with other lot moved to b/e. on 3/19 stop taken out +30 pips 3 months until next viable trade... 6/11 - 3rd consec. up bar. close .2386, the high .2399. so on day four, enter Limit Buy at .2401. order is triggered that day, on 6/13 30 pips profit taken on 1 lot, other moved to b/e. on 6/18 stop taken out. +30 pips 6/28 - 3rd consec up bar. .2324 close, high .2343. on 6/29, place Limit Buy at .2345. Order is never triggered, price falls 90 pips away from my entry. order cancelled at .2255 0 pips So, 3 trades possible since March using the 20/50 filter and not counting the Sunday bar. This pair was very choppy over that time. made +60 pips, with a big loser avoided on the last trade. it would definitely seem that you need to watch all the pairs to give yourself the most trading opportunities I'll backtest something else later today and make the test from the beginning of the year.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Or you can use the method we have worked out so far. would have given 200-280 pips on that bear during February to now.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
and that's why we backtest!

--- 帖子 #277 ---
You're right. Sorry

--- 帖子 #278 ---
thanks ZUNK

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Sorry for the long delay answering your question! I just thought that smb of the great guys here already answered this Personally I don't count doji candles if to strictly follow the rules. This is pure mechanical. If you want add more decretionary thinking - you just free to do this and count doji, you can count even sunday candles if you see that a strong trend is present and sunday candle is not against it. Hope this helps! Regards.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Thank you kittiman for posting your results! But seems you have modified this system for yourself a bit, 'cause say on chart 1 I can see two bullish candles and then bearish candle and then you enter on 4th candle. Sometimes you trade against the direction of 20/50EMA. That's good if you find this way of trading work but I can't follow you, 'cause seems you've added new rules and if I would like to check them - my head will blow up

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Hello vincenzo, Thank you for your support! The guys here trying their best to make this system successful, profitable, with minimal DD and suitable for trading. I would like to thank them too As for your question..The chart for July (USD/CHF) says NO trades and it's really so. All the 3 candles formations observed were against our 2nd rule of this SIMPLE - Trade with the trend! Meaning follow the 20/50EMA. There were bullish candles but main trend was down - so no trades for july with this pair. You're always welcome TheThing

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Yes, Zunk, you're right, that trade GBD/USD in March was against the rules. Thank you for spoting this! Maybe I was so eager to see a losing trade that I counted this one as losing So we have now 32 of 32 winners Keep your good work with ATR up! I think you're getting to smth here and possibly it will be a good alternative way of trading with SIMPLE or an useful addition! TheThing.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Hello Repipula and welcome to our community! Thanks for sharing your idea! It may be useful with this system. But if you follow the thread from the beginning you can see that in the beginning we counted only 3 bars formation. The problem was a HUGE SL of 180 pips and it happened a lot but still results were positive. Then we had to found the way to reduce SL or to make it happen not so often, 'cause 180 pips loss is a serious impact on your equity. 20/50EMA idea was suggested and now we trade only with the main trend. Risk of 180 pips SL was reduced significantly and 5 testing pairs showed 32 winners and 0 losers for now. I was trying to add price action school by James16 here as well as Fibo, trendlines etc..Many guys suggested to keep it SIMPLE and not make complicated. I agreed. The only difficulty with your suggestion is a hard backtest. The system works quite good with past data. More backtest is needed as well as forward test. Soon I'll open a very small account with Lite Forex and will go live with 50-100$ to make this system alive. Kind regards, TheThing

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Seems that someone needs to modify 1st post in this thread by adding 20/50 EMA rule to avoid misunderstanding. And seems that this someone is me

--- 帖子 #285 ---
It certainly is you, System Engineer. Lab assistant

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Heh, not really! You guys make this system work! btw guys, while indicator and maybe expert adviser under my construction (it may take decades LOL ) I would like to share with you some little trick to help us in determining of 1st TP1 hit and when we need move our SL to B/E..Some of you already know this..For some it'll be useful! It'll send an e-mail when price reaches certain level or is more than level given by you.. Here is what you can do: 1) Click on tab Alerts in MT4 platform; 2) Then right click --&gt;&gt;click Create; 3) Click Enable, choose Mail, pick up a pair you like, select condition bid&gt;price, &lt;price etc..select iterations..and here you go! After bid/ask is more/less than the given level you'll receive an e-mail! Quite useful and allows you not to watch the market all the day long! Just make sure you have correct settings in Options--&gt;&gt;E-mail.. Best regards, TheThing

--- 帖子 #287 ---
It was against trend so no trade. (Thing might add that rule to post #1 if/when it's confirmed as the way to go)

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Thanks for that tip! But how will people who are not able to adjust trades during the day deal with this do you think? Personally I think we need a rule designed around the objective of trading at one time per day if we can think of a way to do that. I'm a bit of an hack coder myself and have been mucking about trying to write a little php script that will take 15M historical data from any pair and calculate the Daily signals based on any time + or - GMT. Figured it might give a more accurate picture of setups for people who are not trading at the same moment their broker clocks over the daily candle. (I'm struggling to make it do just that so far... so havent thought about adding trend calc yet)

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Ahh..a tough question! If one is not able to make adjustments once during a day then this system maybe not suitable for these people. If daily system is not for you you can pick up a weekly or monthly systems. I don't know a way to make money in forex and not make adjustments at least once per day while using daily systems. One can try using PocketPC or just create EA that will move your SL to B/E after TP is hit..

--- 帖子 #290 ---
once per day is ok... as long as it can be at the same time. I thought that was part of the object, is the reason I mentioned it. Brad

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Love the activity and energy of those working SIMPLE! The results of 5 pairs backtested to February are very, very impressive! However, it may be time for an update and restatement of what we presently think the most accurate rules of SIMPLE actually are. Perhaps, since we owe him much, we could prevail THING should do the honors! We can then begin to work on new pairs (backtest to February) and apply updated rules to existing pairs backtested (re-evaluate success.) As for going live . . . I am not QUITE ready to go live. And when I do, it will be a North Finance account with small "test" positions (smallest leverage.) However, if anyone is ready . . . I am all for it!! For others, I propose that we take the updated SIMPLE rules and begin a FORWARD test of the existing 5 pairs . . . starting with the Daily bar open on Monday, August 13th (+2GMT North Finance bar) What do you guys think? Maybe a dumb idea!? :-) The e-mail alert by THING is GREAT idea . . . I will go for it when availbale! If aI can be of any help please let me know!! I am also working the AUD/USD pair for a better estimate of SL and TP (each pair will have different SL and TP characteristics.) BEST REGARDS to ALL "SIMPLE-tons" around the WORLD! K

--- 帖子 #292 ---
A very good example of an otherwise good looking SIMPLE setup . . . HOWEVER . . . the trend is your friend (EMA-20 &amp; EMA-50) . . . always observe them or beware! Regards, K http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1186713147

--- 帖子 #293 ---
I've followed this thread with interest as simple systems on the daily are where it's at in my mind.I would recommend that you all have a look at TKimble's daily scalping method as there are possibly some good ideas, contained in that particular thread, that could be of assistance in this method.It is interesting to note that in that method Tkimble trades each daily bar from the open and after 3 bull or bear bars reverses the direction which is the exact opposite of this system,so there could be some merit in looking at shortening the set up period to 1 or 2 days. Another thread worth looking at is "Vella's Method", this also has some interesting observations regarding monthly highs and lows.I don't think MA's are of much help, especially if you are using 20 and 50 periods,when trying to trade the daily bars. Just draw a trend line on the daily and only trade that direction makes more sense than using a MA cross over.All food for thought, good luck.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
The MA's has proven quite usefull in FEB --&gt; AUG atleast. And as they say, no two persons draw trendlines in the same way. It would all be mess and not SIMPLE anymore. BUT, your ideas are definitely worth looking into! =)

--- 帖子 #295 ---
This is an indicator I made to point out to us when 3 bars of the same color and in trend with the MA's has occured. It's my first Indicator ever so please use the MA's and eyes to visually confirm it's working. And any suggestions and problems you may find with it. Please contact me on PM or post here! And please don't mess with the code yourselves. You're free to do what you want with it but don't post it. I want to do the fixing and coding if that's okay. It's my first and I'm trying to learn MT4 programming while working on this one.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
I have coded up the backtesting tool I mentioned earlier. http://www.indycash.com/simple/ It has 15min data back to June 2006 for these pairs: USDCHF, GBPUSD, EURUSD, USDJPY, AUDUSD, USDCAD, USDSEK, GBPCHF, GBPJPY, EURCHF, EURGBP, EURJPY, NZDUSD, CHFJPY, EURAUD, EURCAD and AUDJPY. You can set the time offset from GMT to start each day, take profit and stop loss levels. Should make it easier to quickly check out different variations. Right now it only identifies signals and works out the results on a month by month basis. I'll make another version that allows selection of custom time periods and also calculates the 50 and 20 EMA levels, in a few days time, if I can get the time.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
That's very helpful.. makes it simple to scroll back through history and see the setups fast!

Thank you for your indicator Zunk! PM sent

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Look at the success rate of SIMPLE so far; well in the 90+% area, 100% with most pairs in the last 6 months. How does tkimble do? The three bar setup is the foundation of the method. If you go changing it, then you're using a different method altogether.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
I've found a strange flaw in my indicator. When you scroll the chart to unknown area and it downloads new information from NF's servers those arrows just seems to multiply. I have no idea why but I'm googling for a solution, if anyone know anything please PM me =)

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Here's an expert you all might find handy for this system. I cant get it to work on ODL mt4. It seems to be working great for others. It's called ManageTakeprofit created by Stockwet who's an excellent contributor to the forex community. My hats off to you sir.. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=9553

GREAT WORK INDY!! Thanks a MILLION! ;-) However, I have a question . . . I am getting different values for EMA20 and EMA50 on my NF chart (for the same pair, time period, and Daily bar (open +2GMT) From your calculator: 03/19/07: Buy Signal at 1.9463 1st take profit at: 1.9493 2nd take profit at: 1.9563 Stop loss at: 1.9373 MA20: 2.1519 MA50: 2.0174 Trend: Bullish - TRADE CONFIRMED TP1 triggered at 1.9493 +30 pips (3/20/07 at 08:30:00) SL triggered at 1.9463. Break Even (03/20/07 at 10:15:00) Any ideas . . . probably my setup. Can't thank you enough for the great tool! You are all fine fellows! A privilege to know each!

WOW! Very powerful and nice! Thank you for providing this =) You're really good EDIT: I did some testing and it seems to lag behind. It enters a deal on the fourth bar instead of the third it seems. USDCHF 03 25 70 50 &lt;-- my settings. compare to a chart and see it trades on the 12th instead of the 9th. Very good work anyway!

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Agree with Birdt . . . and thanks to Edge540. I think that SIMPLE is functioning in an AMZING fashion! 90% accuracy as to the initiation of a good trade! AND . . . profitable too! (even without SL's and TP's tailored to each qualified pair.) However, if we begin to deviate away from the data . . . SIMPLE. And if we veer off into the realm of TOO MUCH math, interpretation, and hand-drawn TL's, etc., well, I just think that we should be VERY careful!! Perhaps if edge540 could clarify a little with several chart examples? Again, not criticism of anyone's idea . . . we need them ALL!! And I could very likely be all wrong . . . just my two-pips worth! Regards, K

Guys, with this great tool IndyCash provided us we are able to find optimal values for different pairs and post your best results here and let others to compare!

Hey SIMPLE traders You've got a great thread going here. I'm following it with great interest. I trade a variation of the Fozzy Daily and I think this would be a terrific supplement to that strategy. When we limit out on the 2nd or 3rd candle, if we've had 3 bullish/bearish candles in a row, we could reenter for additional pips! One thing that I thought of which MIGHT be helpful is a price channel consisting of: 5 Smooth Moving Average High and 5 Smooth Moving Average Low. This has been very helpful to me trading my variation of the Fozzy. When price closes above/below this channel, it TENDS to continue for additional candles. If you look at the price channel on the time frame above (in this case the Weekly), it is even more predictive of a loooong run on the Daily. It was just a thought. Your winning % is so high, with the possible exception of finding the optimum stop loss and limits for each pair, you may not want to tinker with what you've got. Keep up the good work. you've got something special going here.

Hey Kev, I have only calculated the Simple MA20 and 50... after looking it up, calculating an EMA was just too complicated to consider at this stage. :\ I 'hope' SMA levels will achieve the same purpose? Anyone? *EDIT: I found an error in the SMA calc code.. thanks for noticing Kev. I have also worked out how to calc the EMA and will also add the SMA5 channel numbers as well. (should have it done soonish) You are a star zunk! I have been trying to work out what wasnt 'quite right' and been thinking that Russian data might be taken at a time offset rather than dead on GMT.... I think I know how to fix this one now. The trend seems to always be bullish on signals for all the pairs too I notice... my coding looks right but that doesnt make sense.. so am still making sure the trend call is correct too.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Hello chazbo and thanks for coming into this thread and sharing your ideas with us! Price channel of 5 SMA could be a very good confirmation along with our 3 candles formation and 20/50EMAs. Here is a quick daily chart EURJPY with price channel. In the first example 3rd candle closed high above price channel confirming our long trend. In the second example all 3 candles are above 5SMA channel showing us a high probability of successfor our long trade. I applied this channel to daily TF, one can do the same with weekly and see a picture. Thanks for a nice tip!

Shoot me a PM with your email address. I have 2 versions of this systems programmed using your rules, but I've added in a lot of functionality which can be switched on or off. I'd like to have you look over it first before posting it to make sure it's executing as you would trade it manually. I can't say a lot about the system or it's profit potential as I haven't traded it, but from experience I know that the simple systems are always the most robust and that's exactly why I programmed it. Thanks for sharing and I'll send it over when I hear from you.

ATR ("Average True Range") Developed by J. Welles Wilder and introduced in his book, New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems (1978), the Average True Range (ATR) indicator measures a currency’s volatility. Wilder defined the true range (TR) as the greatest of the following: Current high less the current low. The absolute value of: current high less previous close. The absolute value of: current low less previous close. The method of calculation ensures that significant gaps accompanied by small high/low ranges are not excluded when measuring volatility. The last two possibilities arise when the previous close is greater than the current high (potential gap up) or lower than the current low (potential gap down). Absolute values were applied to differences to ensure positive numbers. Typically, ATR is based on 14 periods and can be calculated on an intraday, daily, weekly or monthly basis. The first 14-day ATR value is a simple average of the last 14 daily ATR values. Subsequent calculations would smooth the indicator by including the previous 14-day ATR value when calculating the current day’s ATR value.

Results for pair: AUDUSD Period: Feb-Jul 2007 Total signals: 6 Winners: 6 Losers: 0 Pips: 480 Daily Start Time: 02:00:00 GMT TP1: 30 TP2: 60 SL: 90 With the lower TP2 on this pair, the system not only picked 6 out of 6 winners, it obtained maximum return 5 out of 6 times and called No Trade correctly 3 out of 3 times big losers would have resulted. I'll add the SMA5 numbers and extra data so it can backtest a complete 12 month period soon.

I am personally on the hunt for the most appropriate SL for each pair backtested (realizing that the proper SL for each pair will be a "range" of values rather than a specific number ( example: 65 pips +/- 5 pips.) This is, by far, the most important issue we face. But once we get a better handle on SL's for each pair, and over time refine it even further, well the sky is the limit! As for the TP numbers . . . they are of secondary importance and impact. Gents, I do think (not believe) that we have more than sufficeint preliminary evidence/data to show that SIMPLE is an AMAZINGLY good tool! It is pumping-out good trades with 80-90% accuracy! Further, it is also keeping us clear of BAD trades!! THANKS THING!!! So, to my mind, the most important thing we can do is to begin looking at a specific and revised SL for each pair backtested. They will be different for each pair . . . and again, it is the single most important issue confronting our success. As for the TP number(s) . . . we can all be VERY successful over time if these values are conservative (even very conservative.) I also want to point out that a good "SIMPLE" setup takes three full trading days to develop. We have time to share, discuss, debate, etc. the action on the 4th day. So, none of us should EVER get stuck in a bad trade because we did not ask the guys on this board for input and advice. I will! Also, I will always be more than happy to help/advise you guys in any way . . . hope that you will help me too? Of course, we may disagree . . . but I pledge that candor, honesty and, "as I see it" will ALWAYS BE RULE NUMBER 1! If any of us here are worried that if we all place the same trade on the same pair, that we could somehow skew the results . . . PLEASE! There are Millions &amp; Billlions of units flying around . . . and we are, to paraphrase THING . . . SIMPLY waiting at the station to hop on the BIG bus! Well, it is getting on toward Saturday evening here in southern California . . . gonna take my lovely Mrs. out for a nice dinner and a stroll. Warm regards to ALL "SIMPLE-tons" around the World! :-) K

Dear Indy! Thanks a million for developing this backtesting tool! I can see you used 02:00 GMT to perform this backtest. However if I set 22:00 GMT (that's when my new day begins and NF has the same time) I get quite different results and different dates of trades. So everybody should use their own time shifts or there is a solution for all of us to use one and the same?

This is somewhat I got for GBP/USD for a period of AUG 2006 - AUG 2007. This is NOT an EA proposed by techinvest, waiting for his reply with patience I have modified some expert advisor with our 20/50 EMA filter and found optimal settings for TP and SL with pair GBP/USD. Results are quite impressive as for me. The best thing in SIMPLE is not the profit returned but maximum DD . As you can from the picture the possiblity of losing trade is quite low. However I would like to ask our senior coders around here (IndyCash or Zunk) - if you guys have a little free time please let me know, 'cause that would be great if you could check the code line by line and look for the bugs in it. Thank you and kind regards, TheThing

Ooppss..Can't modify the 1st post in this thread to add our recent rules..Does anyone has a solution?

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Ask a moderator and they'll do it for you =)

Very nice done! But the executions of the trades are still a problem. Look here: http://i15.tinypic.com/504attf.jpg Your tool says the 12th, the bars after the 9th is the 12th of February. If it executed there it would definetly be no loss. It seems like it's execution on the 13th. On bar ahead. Guys, until IndyCash fixes the minor problems I don't think there is any idea to post results and such. Very good job anyway IndyCash! I'm impressed! EDIT: I just confirmed by looking at an other pair that the same thing happens on all pairs. It executes the trade one bar ahead of the actual bar.

hello thing, I cannot see which trade you think, I do not notice the Emas +30 pips are always almost always destitute of 3 at opening at this carried out even if the following closes in cash in the opposite direction to fetch, got in. which trade and the results are it always realizes wurden.konkretiesiere above the bar at this, please you think. kittiman

--- 帖子 #324 ---
As far as I understand from your chart you enter after 2 candles have formed but we're looking for 3 candles. We don't trade against direction of 20/50 EMA but you have 1 winner (60 pips) and 1 loser (150 pips) in the chart above. If to follow original rules both trades shouldn't be taken, because they are short but we have 20 ema above 50 so no confirmation. It's ok to trade your way but testing around here is going with a bit different setups.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
hello thing, I think ok you mean trade nr.3 and nr.6, got in nothing changed to the regulate was carried out at the third bar and the realization of the results at nichtauslösen of the sl, two, meets later. kittiman

I hope this will help you understand what TheThing means. http://i11.tinypic.com/4uoktgo.jpg Any questions please ask

yup.....profit would have been only 450 or maybe this one is better.... Results for pair: AUDUSD Period: Aug 2006 - Jul 2007 Daily Start Time: 20:00:00 GMT TP1: 30 TP2: 100 SL: 90 Total Confirmed Signals: 10 Winners: 10 Losers: 0 Pips: 800 Results for pair: AUDUSD Period: Aug 2006 - Jul 2007 Daily Start Time: 20:00:00 GMT TP1: 40 TP2: 140 SL: 90 Total Confirmed Signals: 10 Winners: 10 Losers: 0 Pips: 960

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Please note that the information you provided are irrelevant unless your rules are Wait for 3same color bars and MA trend THEN wait 24hours then enter trade as the 24 hours hadn't been there. IndyCash is doing what he can to fix this I think. In the meantime we must wait =) Also note that 2 trades in a row with that big SL would have resulted in 800pips loss. Enter 2X lot. TP1 hit 1X lot --&gt; SL to Break Even. If new SL hit, 1X lot exit. We're out |OR| TP2 hit 1X lot. We're out. OR SL hits in the first place 2X lot. Maybe a dumb explanation, but read it slowly and carefully =)

just posting what the calculator is showing at this time..... here is a time converting link .... sorry about all the crap links on the page but it is a good local to GMT converter.... http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Am I the only one finding this quite irrelevant? I mean the tools is super cool but at the moment it got some flaws that needs to worked out..

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Please also note that you get different amount of signals 16 vs 19. why? because atm the tool is flawed. I beleive IndyCash is working on that. S please stop =)

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Nope, you are not the only one Waiting with patience for IndyCash response

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Yes, also notice I don't find the tool irrelevant but johnedoe's posts. hehe

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Hey zunk....yes the tool is a back tester with some flaws and these posts are merly showing some of the results SO chill out........and here is another irrelevant post with image, your a bright boy can probably figure it out. http://img514.imageshack.us/img514/6...enshot8wp2.png

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Yes I understand what you're posting. If this is from the tool IndyCash is Developing then I must agree, Yes this is totaly irrelevant. I mean, why are you doing it? Do you want me to also post make-believe results that I just make up from my mind? It would be about as useful. Please, it's cluttering the thread. Stop It.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
examples of potential results of entries at differant times is irrelivant.....yes you are absolutly right even with the flaws this tool shows some very good potential as to what one could potentialy expect.... soooo I;ll quit cluttering your board, have a great day.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Yes it's irrelevant - because the trades the tool takes are mot taken correctly! The tool is taking THE WRONG trades. The entries are not based on the setups we discuss in this thread. I'm sorry. But that's the truth. IndyCash is probably working to fix that problem but to me it seems like you have no idea how skewed your results are. They tell us ABSOLUTELY nothing. That's the truth. Please look at your charts and compare the entries, THEY ARE WRONG! Don't you other people who have participated in this thread agree with me on this one? If you don't I will shut up, but to me it's just cluttering up the thread and making it harder to read what people have said... johnedoe, I don't want you to stop participating in this thread but you must understand that at the moment this tool is not taking the trades correctly at all. Please, compare with your chart. Can't you understand what I mean? EDIT: Just to clarify 1. It enters trade 24 hours to late 2. It chooses trades based on the SL, TP1 and TP2 settings you make OR it just chooses randomly (remember that 16 vs 19 post you made. Same pair, time and everything. But different SL, TP1 and TP2) How can we know it's not more fault. AND number 2 should be enough to just not take the result it gives us seriously (no offense here IndyCash, I love what you've done). Those 2 statements above are hard evidence. They are real proofs. You cannot agree that the above is not correct. Now based on that, do you find the tool irrelvant or relevant as it is right now?

--- 帖子 #339 ---
I have compared with my chart and yes there is error in the output, but it is only about a 1/2 day against the oanda charts that I am using. as to the differant results in the post you mention I was changeing the TPs perimiters to see the differance in results....

--- 帖子 #340 ---
I don't know what GMT oanda is on but if I choose the correct GMT and compares it to my brooker it's 24 hours off. And statement 2 above. There is no way we can consider the results of the tool relevant just based on that alone. We can just not be sure it takes the trades correctly yet..

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Yes but why should the tool take more or less TRADES based on what TP you set? It's severly flawed at the moment. We must wait til IndyCash fix it. And then, I'm all for posting the results just as you've done recently

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Oanda starts a new candle at midnight EDT which is 1600 GMT... so ah -4 hours

--- 帖子 #343 ---
fair enough......but even flawed it does give you an idea that TheThing was and is on the right track with this strategy and what the potential can be........catch ya later.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
I can't really say I agree. But ok. As you say, fair enough. See you =)

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Easy gents! Let's all work together . . . there are plenty of stumbles and bumbles for all (certainly me included!) I am hopeful that with a three day run-up to any "4th day" trade we will ALL discuss and analyze the following . . . any "BIG news" that might adversly effect the trade, make sure that our longer term trends are strong and working for us (EMA-20-50, ATR, etc. -- never a reason to enter into "anti-trend" trade,) and consider recent daily bars characteristics &amp; ATR20's for refinements to SL's and TP's. ALL this, one could never hope for when trading the 1M to 1HR time frames! Another AMAZINGLY COOL feature of SIMPLE!!! If we stick together, look for good 1-2-3-setups and are wise with 4th day trades . . . there is virtually no-limit to our success (which will mean something different to each person here.) Personally, I am hoping that the FOREX "markets" (pairs) will settle down a bit . . . very choppy ride since last week. I am gonna begin forward testing with Monday's opening daily candle (Aug. 13th - North Finance demo account using MT4 and NF data feed at +2GMT -- 2:00PM PST my local time.) Will be watching GBP/USD, AUD/USD, EUR/JPY, GBP/JPY, EUR/CHF among others. Hoping others will be watching, tracking, and reporting too! Best regards to ALL around the World, K

--- 帖子 #346 ---
I agree too... sorry I posted it before I had it 100% correct. Right now I have fixed all issues and added all requested features in this thread... apart from the most important one.... which is the need to wait for 24 hours after 3 matching bars to enter the order. It's Sunday afternoon down here and I try to avoid the PC as much as possible on weekends... but I'll post when it is 100% right. I am looking forward to adding ATR calcs to it to set the TP and SL levels and see how that works. I guess it's pretty obvious from playing with it already that the SMA5 calls are not much use.. think I had better add EMA20/50 numbers instead of the simple MA numbers it is using now too. Oh yeah... all pairs have 12 months worth of data available now too

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Indycash... your posting this tool was not premature at all it has allowed us to run it and test it with differant inputs and though it is not 100% it is still able to give us some rough idea as to the potential of thething's strategy...... the post with the table of differant time entries is valuable in that it shows there is deffinatly an optimum time of day for entries..... my posts were intended to stimulate experimentation instead of antagination.... also the current data only seems to go only as far as july 07 so this is not a tool to use as a trade entry indicator..... anyway have a good weekend all....

--- 帖子 #348 ---
IndyCash that is some high end sh#t. I love it. How easy is it to drop other EAs in your backend and make custom faceplates for them? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
I have to agree with Zunk, this thread has been hi-jacked by technicians and trading theorists and unfortunately will end up like most i.e soon forgotten about. It's a pity because I think this method's got potential but the desire to add MA's, indicators and EA's confines to the fate of most systems posted on FF!

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Can't hurt, at least until proven otherwise, to test the additional "stuff." However, at 80-90%, SIMPLE is doing very well! So, we need to be be very careful about mucking it up with way too much stuff!! As for me, I'm gonna stick with the SIMPLE plus EMA20-EMA50 system. As time, and trades progress, I will do my best to revise the SL and TP for each pair down to a reasonabe level plus a few pips for hedge. May never get the scientifically correct answer . . . but who cares!!!!!!! Again, I'm not asking anyone else to follow my lead . . . however I had hoped that folks would help each other with advice, cooperation, etc. After all, we are ALL gonna "see" pretty much the same 3-day setups! And we have a GOLDEN opportunity, on the 4th day trades, to build wealth over time . . . who cares if we miss the BIG trade. We can grow grow wealthy over a period of several months, to a year, with small leverage and conservative TP targets. Gents, helping each other when 3-day setups BEGIN to present themselves and then communicating about a possible 4th day trade is the key!!! We can ALL then take a look and discuss it . . . we have time! Again, let's try to hang together . . . the issue is not indicators . . . it's basic setups and trading them correctly. Regards, K

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Thank you Indy for your hard work! However as you said seems all bugs have been fixed except the one..and the most important..THERE IS NO NEED TO WAIT 24 HOURS AFTER 3 CANDLES CLOSED..YOU ENTER AT 4 CANDLE OPENING (NOT 5th CANDLE!). Look at the chart and one can see how we can easily turn winner into a losser! 09/13/06 Buy Signal 09/14/06 Entry at: 1.8872 - TP1 at: 1.8922 - TP2 at: 1.8957 - SL at: 1.8782 MA20: 1.8883 - MA50: 1.8753 - Trend: Bullish - TRADE CONFIRMED 09/18/06 SL triggered at 1.8782 -180 pips 00:00:00gmt 09/20/06 Buy Signal 09/21/06 Entry at: 1.9034 - TP1 at: 1.9084 - TP2 at: 1.9119 - SL at: 1.8944 MA20: 1.8872 - MA50: 1.8794 - Trend: Bullish - TRADE CONFIRMED 09/26/06 SL triggered at 1.8944 -180 pips 10:45:00gmt If you have some free time please fix it Kind regards, TheThing

--- 帖子 #352 ---
No no! That's not what I meant, it was super that you posted it. Now we can help you find what needs to be fixed, do some beta testing =) If you don't "work" on sundays then don't! We're just glad you're doing this in whatever pace you see fit. ATR would be really cool, and please don't remove SMA, add EMA also so we can see which perform best (unless it's to big trouble, calculating EMA's is a little bit more complex). And super thanks to you! I'm not 100% sure what antagination means. Like non friendly, I work against you or something. Is that somewhat correct? Anyway, It was not premature to post the tool, thou I think it's premature to draw conslusions out of what results it spits out. And about the time. I'm not sure how you can say that the findings you made brings us any closer to an optimal timed entry. On another forum an MA cross with stochastics performs best at GMT +5, does that mean that this system will perform best at GMT +5? No. Why? Because that system is NOT THIS SYSTEM. Just as the tool doesnt represent THIS SYSTEM. So the information you presented are worthless. There is no wrong in exprimentation, but I think you've pushed it a bit over the edge. Post results from random entrys and 24 hour delays is a bit over exprimentation.. I somewhat agree. It wasn't my meaning to sound pessimistic and not promote exprimentation. But if the exprimentations are done on the wrong premisses it just gets irrelevant. And that's not what we need, false expectations or wrong expectations based on nonsense (faulty entries, 400 pips stoploss etc). I also think we should concentrate on testing this thing without to much techi involved. KISS -- Keep It Simple Stupid! I agree. =)

IndyCash not trying to stress you here or anything, take your time! Don't look at this until monday! =) Results for pair: EURJPY Period: Aug 2006 - Jul 2007 Daily Start Time: 15:00:00 gmt TP1: 40 TP2: 90 SL: 90 Total Confirmed Signals: 15 Winners: 10 Losers: 5 Pips: -140 ------------------------------ Results for pair: EURJPY Period: Aug 2006 - Jul 2007 Daily Start Time: 15:00:00 gmt TP1: 40 TP2: 100 SL: 90 Total Confirmed Signals: 14 Winners: 10 Losers: 4 Pips: 80 Different amount of trades depending on TP2. It's strange. It may be that a bigger TP2 does have a open trade while a new signal is coming and therefor the trade is not taken.. I will look into it. I'll be back later with my findings

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Dear Zunk, You have answered to all people except my post just above I just wanted to let you know that tool enters the trade after 24 hours after 3rd candle is closed and it against the rules as you can see from the chart posted above. So your results are just from another system not SIMPLE TheThing

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Hehe, I think we/I have already pointed out that the trades are made 24 hours after the entry is confirmed. But that's just one of the problems. number 2 is that it takes different amounts of trades depending on the SL, TP1 and TP2 amount. I haven't posted any results, just an example of when the tool behaves dodgy. Have a nice sunday everybody!!

--- 帖子 #356 ---
This seems a little tricky : To avoid cunfusion - enter the trade when 3 matching candles are closed with the opening of 4th candle. And as for different number of trades..the solution possibly is here..Let's imagine some bars.. A strong bullish trend..we have about only 10 bullish bars with different Open-Close values. We count 1-2-3 and enter on 4th bars..If you set a small TP1 and TP2 and 4th bar is enough to satisfy your TPs levels then the trade is closed and you get your profit. But 5th bar is again bullish and 3 matching candles before so we open another long trade. But it's against the rules. We have to wait for another 3 bars formation starting from the day we closed our previous position. And now imagine that 4th bar is very little and you have set a big TP levels so the trade wouldn't be closed on 4th bar. And 5th bar again is too small and your TP is not hit and only 6th bar closes your trade with your TP levels. And this makes the difference in number of trades. Kind regards, TheThing

--- 帖子 #357 ---
It was meant as a response to johnedoe's result posting. He's posts are based on the rules i wrote there. since they're incorrect the results he'd posted shouldn't be taken seriously. And what you wrote is excatly what I wrote in my 2nd last post

--- 帖子 #358 ---
That's good to know we're thinking in the same way I'm just trying to make it more clear for myself writing it down

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Yes =) I got you. I new version of my basic indicator: Now the ATR number is shown above/below the arrow (on more volitale pairs the number may be "under" the arrow but I don't know how to solve this. I've put the number like 20 pips above the arrow, if I make it more the number will dissappear on less volitale pairs) At first I tried to do calculations for SL and TP levels but it got to cluttered. It's quiet easy to do it in the head. What I'm experimenting with now: TP1: 25% TP2: 100% SL: 50%. Not hard to do in the head, but if you want to try different levels or need help I also attach the excel sheet again. BEWARE: If you use the indicator a whole day, so a new candle appear. Choose another timeframe (like 5 minute) and them choose 1HR again. I don't know why but it seems to be a bit picky if it isn't freshly reloaded. Also don't scroll back and download more data from your broker while using the indicator. The arrows multiply and your computer might hang. Sorry for the inconvinience. I'm a mql newbie

--- 帖子 #360 ---
I am all for indicators, etc. but they WILL NEVER replace ALL of us looking with human eyes and minds at these SIMPLE setups. YIKES GUYS!! It takes three full daily candles for a trade to EVEN BEGIN to qualify for a 4th day opening candle trade! In other words, we have plenty of time to fully consider: 1.) Any BIG economic/world news that might effect the trade on the 4th day 2.) We will be able to establish if we like the EMA-20 and EMA-50 trend 3.) We will be able to make a good estimation of the recent price activity (from surrounding daily bar characteristics) 4.) Most importantly . . . We have ample time during Day-3 to discuss AT LENGTH what we think the most appropriate SL and TP might be for the pair(s) in question. 5.) We can call off any Day-4 trades if Day-3 candle shows poor signs or goes against us! (another SIMPLE quality - trading a much longer time-frame!) THE NUMBER ONE thing we can ALL do for success with "SIMPLE" is to get on the same page in terms of what our charts are seeing . . . seeing the same data is gonna be essential. And, right now, I do not think we are ALL on the same page in terms of time and charts!!!!!!! And no, I do not care which data feed or broker we use!! Several of us have been using a NorthFinance.com demo account. It comes with MT4 charting and never expires. We are using their data feed for daily setups . . . their daily candle opens at +2 GMT. For me, this translates to a daily opening bar at 2:00PM Pacific Standard Time (PST) Oh well, that is what I am gonna start doing. And it is only my opinion of what we could do together. So hopefuly, we can pull together here for mutual fun and tremendous profit! Cuz, SIMPLE does work very, very well and it does not need a ton-of-indicators! Regards, K

--- 帖子 #361 ---
An indicator such as mine makes it easier to backtest. I'm all with you in what you're saying but as far as I know we don't have TP or SL levels. The original rules doesn't suit all pairs and the ATR hasn't been fully experimented with yet. We need more backtests I think. I also think we're all on our lazy sides since IndyCash is developing such a great tool that will make backtesting so much easier.. That's how I see it anyway.. Have a nice day!

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Did you forget my irrelevant post that showed different TPs and SLs......even though the backtester is flawed

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Hey Kev-K, I'll join your forward test from this Monday and will be watching GBP/USD, AUD/USD, EUR/JPY and USD/JPY with the same broker (NF). We can share our ideas as well as SL and TP levels in the process of testing. Best regards, TheThing

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Hi Thing.... I will start Monday with Oanda forward testiing.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
God.. What are you on man? EDIT: YOU CAN'T GET TP AND SL LEVELS BY EXPERIMENTING WITH ANOTHER SYSTEM. GODDAMN MAN!!!

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Boys and girls! PLEASE STOP ARGY-BARGY here! Just do what you think is right, 'cause everyone is different and human being is not a mechanical system so everyone thinks in a different way and he/she has the right for it. Personally I'm not making any backtests with the Indy's tool for now because I get quite different results with my own manual testing. Kind regards, TheThing

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Hehe. This guy must be pulling my leg, right?

--- 帖子 #369 ---
You're funny guys so please keep this thread in positive

--- 帖子 #370 ---
No problem.....will be busy now looking forward instead of backwards....... It may several days befor anything comes together, given the last two weeks of irregular market conditions. will wait and see.........

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Excellent! I encourage you to post your reports when IndyCash has fixed the tool = so your reports can be based on something that matters. =)

--- 帖子 #372 ---
It's soo hard while this guy's doing this... I will have read only on this thread for a while... No more posting for me.. Will see if I can cool down and Then maybe IndyCash has fixed his tool also. See you

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Right with you Thing! I will be on it like a hawk at NF daily bar open on Monday, Aug 13th. (NF bar opens at 2:00PM PST - my local) ALL that matters is what we actually see with SIMPLE . . . NOT WHO'S INDICATOR IS BETTER, ETC. Besides, with our daily time-frame there is going to be plenty of time to discuss and analyze during the 3 day run-up to ANY 4th day trade. Best regards, K PS: Is anyone else having trouble using the "Private Message" feature with ForexFactory? I am getting some goofy error message about insufficent privilege (I have already written FF asking if it is a transient system glitch, etc.) Suspect that it is.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Hey Simple Traders I just downloaded the MT4 North Finance Charts so I could evaluate potential trades with you guys. I notice they have a Sunday candle unlike the charts I am currently using. What are your rules going to be regarding the Sunday candle? Ignore it or treat it as any other candle? Also, have you made a decision concerning how many pips of movement constitute a bullish or bearish candle? For example, if a doji like candle has only 2 or 3 pips between open and close, would that be considered a bullish/bearish candle? What do you think the minimum # of pips of movement should be?

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Hi Chazbo, Rules are ignore Sunday candle... I don't think there has been a decision on doji candles.. right now I am counting them. Brad

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Hey IndyCash....... Nice work on the changes to the tool......I owe ya a tall cold beer, a good micro brew..... LOL one other thing.....the end data only goes to july..... is that a result of the data feed or is it a line of code? Also do you check the box to use both MAs or do you check the box if you only want to use one MA?

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Hi TheThing, thanks for this simple and great system! @Indycash: Thanks for your backtesting tool, but it's still buggy: 09/14/06 Buy Signal 09/15/06 Entry at: 1.8863 - TP1 at: 1.8893 - TP2 at: 1.8963 - SL at: 1.8773 09/15/06 SL triggered at 1.8773 -180 pips 15:30:00gmt The Buy Signal should be on 09/14/06 Open and the entry as well. I guess I have to disable the "Wait 1 day after setup for entry?" option which isn't possible yet? Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Good day Xaron Yes, buy signal GBP/USD and entry should be on 14th of September not 15th. There is no way to wait 24 hours after 3 candles formation, we have to enter as early as possible to catch that movement. I think Indy will fix it. Actually the option for waiting 24 hours is not needed because it's against the rules. Kind regards, TheThing

--- 帖子 #379 ---
There must be at least 2-3 pips difference between Open and Close. If Open=Close then disregard this bar (candle) Hope this helps. Best regards, TheThing

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Hi everyone, i agree with kev-k and the thing,the system has to be kept veeeeeeeeeeeery simple. thing,please chech the data i have for the 14th sept 2006 trade thanks

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Hi The Thing, I have been reading your thread with great interest. I have manual backtested USD/CHF pair and the result doesn't seem good http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon9.gif May i know, so far which pair produce the best result of all, basing on this SIMPLE system ?? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
the candles seem to have just formed for 12th,13th,14th, so shouldnt the 15th be the right entry, please correct me if i am wrong. thanks

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Yes, according to your chart and your broker you have to enter on 15th BUT I can clearly see that MA's signales you a bearish short trend, so you shouldn't take that trade. We only trade if we have 3 candles formation and they matching the direction of MAs. You could had a good trade just before when a nice bearish movement happened. But if you look at my chart one can see that my entry point should be on 14th of Sep. It was a nice trade

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Hey guys, We got a nice bearish movement with GBP/USD! We have 3 bearish candles and the only problem is that 20 EMA is still above 50 EMA but as you can see it's slope already changed to down as well as 50 EMA. I'll post some my observations and how we can win some good pips even if the trend indicators haven't changed yet. Personally I would take this trade, I know it's against the rules and more risk involved but I'll try to post some ideas on this later. And don't pay attention to my yellow lines - it's trendlines and price pivots TheThing

--- 帖子 #385 ---
USD/CHF is kind of a choppy pair, AUD/USD, most of the yen pairs, NZD/USD and USD/CAD have had smoother more tradable trends. However the last two weeks with all the subprime crap has thrown the market into to a blender, I think it will be a little while yet before we see any good tradable signals and a trend developing. way to rangy right now.

USD/CHF is not the best pair, you can have a look at my manual testing with the charts somewhere in the beginning of this thread.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
I demo trade at OANDA...i got exactly what Johnedoe is getting..there is no setup in OANDA's chart...so which to follow ?? to take this trade or not to take ?? really confuse...?! http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon5.gif

--- 帖子 #389 ---
The problem with this system for now is that different brokers will provide you different setups as you can see. And that's why some people here selected the same broker - NF and we watching the charts together. So if you want to follow us - download NF MT4 platform and if you stick to Oanda that's fine, but sometimes you'll get different entries - not good not bad just different!

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Thanks TheThing, is there a way to align all this ? just curious...

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Yes, there is! Look for the setups with NF demo and trade with Oanda

So, is NZD/USD good move to go short, or is it better to wait, because of the 'storms' going on the market?

--- 帖子 #393 ---
RSI on daily graph is very low, so maybe it would be better to go long - but this is against this sistem now what

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Following this thread with great interest. Based on the latest rules for the daily system what do you guys think about AUDUSD? I am using the StrategybuilderFx demo account that does not show a Sunday candle. AUDUSD is showing 3 days with a lower close but the MA's have not crossed. Blue line is a weekly MA. White and Yellow lines are the 20 and 50 MA.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
TheThing......................my apologies if this is considered an intrusion in your thread (I'll remove this post if you wish). I have been following this thread because I am primarily a Daily chart trader, and therefore try to look at other threads that encourage trading the Dailies. I believe there are aspects of the Daily Fozzy Method that would be useful in your development of the Simple Daily System. The attached chart is a good example.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Hoping for calmer waters ahead . . . the currency markets are choppy since July 25-26. Gonna have to wait with patience for them to settle a bit. It may be that we are lookng at some SHORT opportunities for a while. At any rate, off and running with forward testing of SIMPLE (begin: Aug. 13th, NF demo account using MT4, daily bar opens 2:00PM PST - my local) Warm Regards, K

--- 帖子 #397 ---
I too, would have taken this SHORT trade. That is, IF I weren't paper trading and testing SIMPLE!! I will be interested in your ideas about WHY? :-) Like the overall weak nature of EMA-20/50, price, TL's, and eco-news Thanks a MILLION, Thing! Best Regards, K

--- 帖子 #398 ---
FYI: "Day Zero" will be August 13th's daily bar (inclusive of the 13th's bar)

--- 帖子 #399 ---
LOL... I changed it to wait that 24 hours as people told me that was what was wrong with it to satrt with! Glad to hear it isn't part of the rules... as the results looked much better without that wait day to me. Anyway... will remove that and add "There must be at least 2-3 pips difference between Open and Close. If Open=Close then disregard this bar (candle)" I almost wish I hadn't started this now! But may as well get it right now it's out there. Brad @Xaron... it isn't buggy now at all... it calculates the results based on the data it is fed. It appears the 15M data source is not collected exactly on the minute.. or North Finance data isnt collected exactly on time.. but either way the slight differences in the data will make the results differ slightly. But it's only a backtester to test out different ideas with different pairs.. the forward testing just starting is the only way to get truely accurate results.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
The situation with the GBP/USD as well as the AUD/USD and NZD/USD is where you might want to use some discretion as far as trend determination goes instead of just the 20 and 50 EMAs. I'm experimenting using the 5 Smooth Moving Average High/Low price channel in situations like this. I entered the AUD/USD and NZD/USD because the 20 and 50 EMAs were strongly converging and price had closed below the 5 Smooth Low on the Daily and was below the 5 Smooth Low on the Weekly as well.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
AUD/USD . . . DISCRETION YES! You will probably make some money on this trade (for a variety of TREND and recent eco-news reasons.) And I can see how you might become very eager to enter a SHORT here. However, I would not have taken the trade because of the following: We are looking for, and supposedly testing for SIMPLE setups . . . so, for example: Do you see three consecutive daily down bars? Just curious what our long-term objective is? I know what mine is! Regards, K http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1187061318

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Get rid of the Sunday bar (hint: look at the volume of that bar) and there is a three day formation on the AUD/USD, and it has moved 25 pips or so down so far. However, this set up looks a little weak - the length of the bars (ie difference between open and close) have grown steadily smaller in the formation. Admittedly this didn't stop me opening a small short position!

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Somehow, I knew that would be the answer. Well, guess I am the only one still paper-trading/testing the system! :-) And so, and for me, the World began on Monday, August 13, 2007 at 2:00 PM PST. Sunday did not exist (for my purpose) Have a good day guys. Regards, K

--- 帖子 #404 ---
On my MT4 Charts without the Sunday candle (FXDD and Royal Trader), there ARE 3 bearish candles prior to entry. Instead of disregarding the Sunday candle on NF, I thought I would look at MT4 Charts with and without Sunday candle and try to make a determination which might be better to use for this strategy. On other threads (such as Fozzy), it was determined by testing that no Sunday candle had better results. That dosen't mean the same holds true for the SIMPLE, but since the strategy isn't yet set in stone I thought it might be worthwhile to try some different things. I don't mean to be a rule breaker, just thought it was worth considering. PS I was under the impression that if using a platform with a Sunday candle, it should be disregarded.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Already people are breaking the rules, even as simple to understand as these are.... is it any wonder why most traders fail.... and yes I know gee, we're just trying to optimize the strategy.....I think it should be forward tested for awhile befor optimization gets started......jmho PS .... I have done the same thing in the past so I speak from personal experiance....the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Hi everyone, As a trader of daily chart systems I've been following this thread with interest! Johnedoe, I hear what you're saying about breaking the rules, but I think in this case it's actually a good thing. In fact, I wouldn't even call it breaking the rules just yet as the optimal set of rules has yet to be determined as you point out above. I'm currently backtesting a variant of this system using ATR to determine stop loss and take profit levels and including Sunday candles. If anyone's interested I'll post my results when I'm done. Also, I think the sample size needs to be quite a bit larger than just Feb07 - Jul07. Given the fact that this system produces few trades (a good thing in my opinion) I'm going back a few more years. I personally don't feel comfortable trading a system I haven't tested at least 200 or more sample trades on, preferably more. Good luck everyone! ocelot PS: Hi there Kev-K, from a fellow Californian (northern)

--- 帖子 #407 ---
I guess the point I was trying to make is that allready people are fading the signals and jumping the gun before a signal is made, also trading against the trend....little things that add up to losing trades....

--- 帖子 #408 ---
I think that's a valid criticism, I wouldn't take any trades against the trend using this system either. Sure you'll miss some good ones, but the point of the filter is to keep you out of the bad ones and there will always be new opportunities. Sitting on the sidelines is perfectly okay. Having the discipline to wait until the setup completes is the real trick here.

Don't forget ..... even sitting on the side line your earning intrest on your account...

Hi, can I make my MetaTrader take half profit automatically? When I set up "take profit" price, I cannot change the volume.

Hey guys, I'm just trying to find a way how we can win more pips even if MA 20 and MA 50 are not in order. This doesn't mean this system has new rules. I'm doing my tests and trying to combine simple things in together and will share with you as soon as I feel confident enough about them. Here is what I have for today with my little twist of the system.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
+150 pips for today and I must say not a huge risk envolved. There is no need to set 90 pips SL. TheThing

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Silistar is a place in Bulgaria, I assume he was asking if that was where you went. Obviously not. I agree with Ocelot that more extensive backtesting over several years needs to be done. The 6 month test was just a preliminary test to see if the system has potential. It does, now we need to establish whether the period was extraordinary in any way, and whether the system will perform as well in a larger sample (which in turn should indicate how well it will work in the future). For me, I know the system works really well and it already has the potential to make money but some pairs work much better than others and each will have tailored TP and SL points, and possibly rules such as what constitutes a doji bar, whilst it may be open close within 2 pips for EUR/GBP, it might be 10 pips for EUR/JPY. What I intend to do is go back and look at the three bar set ups that lost and look for reasons why and whether there were any clues that they would lose.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Very well said! Discipline not the system makes you success! Stick to the rules guys for now, no need to take sideway moves. TheThing.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Ahh..I see..No BeachBum, I spent my time in Sozopol, Nessebar and SunnyBeach :

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Thanks a lot, but in this way we still have to sit in front of our computers waiting for the 30 pips profit. What I really want is "automatic", without the need of sitting in front of computers and waiting. There are three types of order, instant execution, pending order and modify order. To take half profit at 30 pips, we can only use modify order. And when we use "modify order", the volume is disabled. So it seems no way to be automatic. == Yes, this is possible. Select your trade and then right click..select Close Order..then, is the upper area you'll see number of lots..select how many you would like to close..and that's it..your single position will be still running but minus lots you have just closed.. Hope this helps and if not I'll post a chart just let me know. Kind regards, TheThing[/quote]

--- 帖子 #423 ---
[/quote] hmm..I don't think MT4 has an option to move your SL automatically to B/E..Possibly FXSOL has this feature..or you can make your expert advisor just move your SL when TP1 is hit..

For gods sake start trading the original system, there is so much testing,back trading,forward testing, adding indicators etc, etc, bla .bla bla you are all parilised by analysis and as a result achieving absolutely nothing!

--- 帖子 #427 ---
What is it to you what we do? If you don't see the need to refine it then your input is of little worth.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
The point is that the original method had some potential but unfortunately the method has been hijacked by the FX theorists who have never traded with real money and as a result have consined this system to the bin!

--- 帖子 #429 ---
And what's wrong when people perform back testing or forward testing? I think it's a common way of development of any system. By adding indicators we 're looking for filters and we found 20EMA/50EMA which greatly increased our successful rate of trades. Can't see any point of you post..

--- 帖子 #430 ---
What is difference between so called "original" system and the present system? The only difference is EMA's added as a filter..and that's it.

Responding to several private messages . . . I am testing/paper trading SIMPLE against my core pairs --- pairs with some SIMPLE backtest history: EUR-USD EUR-JPY GBP-USD GBP-JPY AUD-USD In future, I will add at least one other non-USD and non-JPY pair "TIME ZERO" for me is the daily bar 8/13/07 (for my purposes, nothing exists before this bar opening.) I am using a North Finance demo account (so daily charts, time-frames, quotes, and daily bars match others testing SIMPLE.) I am only using the following "indicators" to filter my POSSIBLE 4th day trades: daily bar characteristics, EMA-20, EMA-50, and any BIG economic news that might skew day 4. Hope this helps some of you. Of course, others are more than welcome to do thier own thing! K

Yeah .... that is the only real problem with this system but I think it will work with any broker, just your entries will be differant, most that are forward testing here are using NorthFinace....I thought I would just stick with the Oanda timeframes to see how it works with them....Good luck

This trade is against the trend according to my charts, but fair play for going for it. I personally took out a modest short trade on the AUD/USD, which paid off beautifully with 80 pips. I don't really like the look of anything tonight though, at least in respect to this method.

Hey guys! Here is what I have recently..2 trades were taken..Look at the charts.. AUD/USD this was a short trade with the following our main rules of SIMPLE. As for now +92 pips..All system conditions were met..If you watched this trade closely you should already reached your TP2 and close (or put your trailing stop and let it run)

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Here is another trade GBP/USD (+85 for now)..This trade is against our 20/50 EMA filter so you can miss it if you don't want to take more risker trades..I think there will be 2 ways to trade with SIMPLE: 1) more conservative and more stable with our main rules and 20/50 EMA filter 2) alternative with more risk envolved but possibly with more positive gains I'll try to put all the things together and post everything in post #1 in this thread so you can check them out..which way you choose - it's only up to you..

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Swissy was a good trade last night. Entered when the 4th up bar broke the high of the third up bar by 3 pips (1.2120). Used the original simple rules (3 up bars, enter on the 4th).

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Yep, it was a good long trade, but against our 20/50EMA filter (20 EMA was below 50EMA). More risk envolved but still nice pips. Regards, TheThing

Buy Rules 1) Daily Charts with NO Indicators 2) If price has 3 consecutive days where the Close is higher than the Open, on the OPEN of the 4th candle, Initiate a Buy Order. 3) Stop is 2 pips below the previous candle, or 90 pips (whichever is lower) 4) Take Profit is in 2 steps... a) Take half profit at 30 pips and move stop to break even b) Take remaining profit at 100 pips Sell Rules 1) Daily Charts with NO Indicators 2) If price has 3 consecutive days where the Close is lower than the Open, on the OPEN of the 4th candle, Initiate a Sell Order. 3) Stop is 2 pips above the previous candle, or 90 pips (whichever is lower) 4) Take Profit is in 2 steps... a) Take half profit at 30 pips and move stop to break even b) Take remaining profit at 100 pips

In an earlier post I suggested that some of the techniques used by Daily Fozzy traders could be applicable to the Simple Daily System and might for some improve the quality of trading. Here, IMO is a good example of that. Trend direction is often an issue. Using a 28 EMA (borrowed from the Vegas Daily Tunnel) and a 5 Smoothed MA on close as well as a 5 Smoothed MA on open can help with establishing overall trend direction, short term trend direction and immediate trend direction change. The attached screenshot shows the 28 EMA as a silver line, the 5 SMA channel in red and blue, S &amp; R levels and fib lines related to the 28 EMA. These support the decision to trade long on the fourth UP candle. Also notice the "Buy" Fozzy signal on Aug 8 which was 'confirmed' on Aug 13 when the trend line indicators turned upward (interestingly this was the second UP candle in this series). I am sharing this for the purpose of encouraging others to think about ways to keep the Simple Daily System 'simple' while at the same time improving the simplicity and quality of trading this method.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
If you want to strictly follow "main" rules of SIMPLE you should enter when 20 EMA is below 50 EMA for a short trade with the closing of 3rd candle (when we make a decision to take or not to take a trade). But according to my charts in the beginning of 14th the 20 EMA was a little above 50 EMA so no trade.

Thank you BeachBum! Your comments and suggestions are always welcome

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Thing, One million "thanks" to you and all the other talented c ontributors of this tread and system. Forgive the stupid question (I read the thread and can't find the answer)..... In confirming the trend, is the "SIMPLE" rule to see that both the 20 and 50 ema lines have actually crossed just before making the trade OR can both the 20 and 50 ema lines be heading in the same direction (20 over 50, heading up, for LONG trades and 20 under 50, heading down, for SHORT trades). Thank you.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Hello... I use IBFX and the chart is based on GMT +0 . Today is 08.15.07, can anyone confirm that these are possible trades for the start of the day on 08.16.07? 1) EU looks like it will close the day as a bear candle on 08.15.07 but the 20 ema is still above 50 ema (but they are both pointed down). 2) UJ looks like it will close the day as a bear candle on 08.15.07 and the 20 ema is nicely below the 50 ema (with both pointing down). Maybe shorts for both these pairs? Thanks

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Here you go. I think you need both files. Put them in the indicator folder.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Yes, I would like to thank these guys too for their great contribution and support! As for your question..it's not stupid at all! If you follow these 2 EMAs and pay attention to their slope they may provide you useful information. At the chart you won't see many crosses of 20/50 EMAs, because of their quite long period. When 20 EMA crosses 50 EMA above this may be a signal of bullish trend. You don't need to wait everytime for 20 EMA cross 50 from downside to upside to take long. If 20 EMA is already above 50 and it's heading up (positive slope) it's OK to look for 3 candles formation and take a long trade. Opposite for a short. Best regards, TheThing

--- 帖子 #466 ---
I'm waiting for smjones reply and as soon as I hear from him I'll edit my 1st post and add 20/50 EMAs filter to the current rules. Besides there will be an alternative way to trade with SIMPLE - more risk envolved and more pips to get

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Heh..Specially loaded IBFX platform to answer your question but can't find EUR/JPY in demo LOL As for USD/JPY yes, 20 EMA is below 50 and we have 3 candles formation..so we can enter short here according to SIMPLE.. Maybe soneone else confirm EUR/JPY..

--- 帖子 #468 ---
My take . . . like to hear from others! EUR/USD: With 1:30 minutes to go until 8/16/07 daily bar open . . . NF daily chart shows EUR/USD with three down daily bars (13,14,15*) -- EMA20&gt;50 (trending down) and price closing well below "5-smoothies" -- If today's bar closes down . . . SHORT opportunity for open on 8/16 bar. I will paper trade this setup. NOTE: To my knowledge, USD/JPY has not been backtested against SIMPLE USD/JPY: With 1:30 minutes to go until 8/16/07 daily bar open . . . NF daily chart shows USD/JPY with only two down candles (Aug 14 &amp; 15) - EMA20&lt;50 and "5-smoothies" down - all with good downward velocity. If tomorrow's daily candle closes down (Aug 16th,) a possible SHORT opportunity will be at hand for open on Aug. 17th. I would not take this trade (no backtest of USD/JPY.) NOTE: All pairs continue to suffer the effects of last week's global sub-prime news releases (in USA, Europe, etc.) Price has been hammered . . . so be cautious and be on the lookout for anti-trend rallies/rebounds. Regards, K

I am Paper Trading ONLY (others can do what they will) 1:20 mintues until NF daily bar open: if bar-3 closes down . . .

There are none yet. We are waiting for IndyCash (no stress man, you've done a great job so far!!!!) to finish up his tool som we can backtest for optimal entries for every pair.

Glad to see you both together

Congrats to you! Yes, there will be many good trades ahead And for TP levels..I understand that SIMPLE was created with certain SL and TP levels. But also I understand that SIMPLE as any other system here is to make you profitable and end up with positive pips. So if you feel comfortable with 30 pips in profit - that's very good, close you trade and be happy for today! Don't say that SIMPLE told me to hold until 100 pips in profit but the market reversed and I got -180 pips loss! Once again SIMPLE is here to gain nice pips for all of us and it has recomendations for TP and SL levels but you have your head on the shoulders so think for yourself - is it better to have 30 pips in profit and be happy or should I risk more and wait for 100 pips to come? 30 pips TP &gt;&gt; 1 standart lot &gt;&gt; 1 pip = 10$ &gt;&gt; position is opened with 2 lots &gt;&gt; overall 60 pips in profit &gt;&gt; 600$ USD in just one day, one single trade..Look in my country average salary is 300$ a month! I'll be happy enough to get 600$ in 1 day! And I know that market will be here till the end of my days so no need to be in a rush and risk too much! 30 pips are 30 pips and that's a decent money. So guys think yourself what are appropriate risks and rewards for you? And follow these rules! Good luck for all of us TheThing

Hi Thing, Today, SIMPLE performed just as advertised! For testing purposes, I chose the 30 pip &amp; 40 pip TP levels. No real science or experience behind those numbers . . . just caution and prudence (my trading nature.) It seemed, given that we (I) know so little about how SIMPLE reacts during SHORT trades, to be the right thing to do. However, as time and confidence evolves, there will be ample time to adjust/refine SL's, TP's, and procedures for the core pairs traded with SIMPLE. Thing, as you so rightly observe, everyone has their comfort level! And yes, there will be a lifetime's worth of SIMPLE setups! So, my advice to all here, take the trade that makes you comfortable . . . within your personal risk tolerance. And, NEVER, repeat NEVER, let anyone talk you into a trade . . . not me . . . not Thing . . . not anyone! No matter how "perfect" it may seem. And, of course, if you do take the trade . . . realize that we are all adults here . . . trade at your own risk. So, no whimpering or finger-pointing allowed! As for today's EUR/USD trade, I am very pleased (on paper!) Of course, I missed the "riches" of a live bankable trade! However, time/trades/and experience will ultimately lead to GREAT success! I am looking to build wealth slowly with reliable, repeatable, logical, and predictable SIMPLE system (maybe not the BIG trade, but who cares!) So, THANKS THING!!! We are on to something fine here! Warm regards to ALL "SIMPLE-tons" around the World tonight (9:25 PM local tiem -- PST) Peace from California, USA K

AMEN! :-)

--- 帖子 #484 ---
On to the next "good" SIMPLE setup!

--- 帖子 #485 ---
IF we disregards the Sunday bar, there is a lot of setup here :- Short Pairs :- GBP/USD, USD/JPY, EUR/USD, EUR/JPY, CAD/JPY, AUD/USD, CHF/JPY Long Pairs :- USD/CAD, USD/CHF http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/dollar.gif http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/dollar.gif http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Thank you Kev-K, I always reading your posts with great interest! I'm not so eloquent as you are! :

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Yes, there are many, but if go through the whole thread here one can find that there is NO re-enter rule with SIMPLE. I mean yesterday you took your short trade and closed it with profit. Today there is a bearish candle too but this trade shouldn't be taken, because we have to wait 3 more candles to form starting from yesterday. And one more thing..some pairs do not produce as good results as others.. TheThing

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Still waiting for smjones reply and permission to edit post #1. I would like to introduce you alternative way of trading SIMPLE for your judgement and another way (my preference) to track your TP. I can post all of this here but it will get lost in some time and many newcomers will be asking where can i find this? So I think the better idea is to wait for smjones response.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Hello there... The Thing: It would be great if you could post some ideas on TP and maybe SL. I don't think it's SIMPLE not to have any, not complaining here, just saying out loud.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Zunk, Nice to see you back full of energy SL and TP levels are included within SIMPLE "main" rules, we just trying to find optimal for each pair. So 90 pips SL and TP1 (30) and TP(100) are still valid even without optimization. I use 90 pips too but with a little twist of TP. Hope to get reply from smjones and post everything with the charts in the post #1 tonight.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
You are absolutly correct......I entered most of those yesterday and made some R E A L L Y nice pips......

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Hello zunk hope your forward testing is doing well......... I have made a couple of changes to the TP SL guidlines origanally set .... instead of 1/2 at 30 and balance of position at 100, I enter with 75 SL and 100 TP, I ake 1/2 at 30 and follow the rest with a trailing stop, ( TS is done manually since I am at Oanda , I check the trade on average every hour or two).....made over 150 pip on a couple pair yesterday......... also I am trading this live but only using 100 units (micro lot) per trade.....will upgrade this as forward testing proves out.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Great one johnedoe http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif if base on oanda's chart, today suppose to be the right time to enter but due to discrepancy of chart between NF &amp; oanda...NF should be right one to follow, since everyone here is testing base on NF..since you have entered your trade yesterday, i suppose the 150 pips profit is just easy.. Good trade. http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/dollar.gif http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Remember the re-enrty rule! Once a trade has concluded . . . we never re-enter it! No matter how appealing. Find another pair setup or forget it. Please wait for the next 3-bar setup to occur. In all the pairs out there, there will ALWAYS be another setup. Be careful. 1-2-3-----4 K

--- 帖子 #495 ---
=) I know they are there but I don't think 90/30/100 will do every pair so somekind of ideas on that one would be awesome. I'm still working (slowly) on testing the ATR and different settings. This is a very good idea, Trailing Stops. Kudos to that! Very nice!

--- 帖子 #496 ---
I have been looking at the ATR also and I think it would be the most logical to set the initial stop, as to the periods for the ATR since we use three consecutive candles maybe also use a three period ATR........ and then perhaps use a trailing stop from there.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
From a SIMPLE testing perspective ONLY . . . I would kinda like to see the markets level out to a more normal level of activity (albeit this is a profitable trading time!) This global credit/liquidity situation has the stock and currency markets in an uproar. Regards, K

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Thing, what do you think . . . can Zunk and Johnedoe work together on ATR's? :-) Just kidding guys! Best regards to All K

--- 帖子 #499 ---
ovr the last two days I snatched up nearly 800 pips......now the speads have increased a little and volitility is still high, however I think i will take the rest of the week off, let things settle down a bit and wait for the next set of entry signals......have a good week all.

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Do you mind telling me what pairs you were trading with .... thanks.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Here ya go..... this is way more than I usually trade .... but they all gave m a signal.. AUD/JPY, AUD/NZD, AUD/USD, CAD/JPY, EUR/AUD, EUR/JPY, EUR/USD, GBP/JPY, USD/JPY, USD/CHF, USD/SGD

--- 帖子 #502 ---
I have read this thread for the past two days and it is awsome. I use Trade Station charts and will start looking at how their daily candle sets up. I am not familar with meta trader 4. If you download the MetaTrader 4 demo, is there a cost for that? Is that a charting package as well. Are the pairs on the demo account restricted in number? I wish to help with back testing and forward testing, but learning a new platform is a challenge with the other things I am doing. Have read the pros and cons of the other time frames. If TradeStation platform produces similar results I would like to stay with them. As folks who have lived with this system I appreciate all insights. ChrisB

--- 帖子 #503 ---
No cost... and yes it includes charting... most examples you see posted in this thread are from MT4. If you use the North Finance demo account with it, you will also be looking at daily charts on the same time frame as some of the regular posters here. (GMT+2) http://www.northfinance.com/eng/open-demo-account I don't think it should matter what platform you trade with once the system has been refined... but during testing and discussion you probably will find it worth the effort to learn how to use MT4.. it shouldnt be that much different to TS that you can't pick it up fairly easilly I think. Also... the way the system is developing, I predict many of us are going to want to use an "Expert Advisor" to move our stops automatically.. which is a well supported option in MT4. Brad

--- 帖子 #504 ---
I would be VERY interested in hearing/learning what ANYONE has learned this past week about SIMPLE . . . and its performance, predictive powers, SL's, TP's, etc. Please everybody!!!!!!!! . . . let's hear what people have to say and reserve our critiques, comments, and arguments until later! Many are NEW to trading and many are OLD to trading . . . and I have learned much from both! Besides, these forums have enough FIGHTS and "I'M RIGHT &amp; YOU'RE WRONGS" . . . we need ALL ideas. Best regards to ALL "SIMPLE-tons" around our beautiful globe tonight (8:30 PM in California, USA) It's just now sundown here and it's spectacular! God Bless All! Regards, K

--- 帖子 #505 ---
So far This strategy has worked out amazingly well even considering the volitility these last two weeks.....I have also made some minor changes in the TP in that I have been using a trailing stop instead of the original take 1/2 at 30 and balance at 100 ..... this was a V E R Y good week.....we shall see what happens next week and the next several months........if the backtesting is any indication of perfprmance, then ladies and gentelmen, we have a simple, easy to understand and follow strategy that is gonna make us some pips. Also this should be a very easy strategy to wright an EA for. though I personally don't care to put that much trust in an automated system.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Hi mate, have anyone came out with the testing coding with this 'SIMPLE' system ?? maybe backtesting will be much more easier with the coding using the rules stated on post #1...

--- 帖子 #507 ---
I've been working on a backtester but some problems were found with it that I havent had time to fix this week.. see my sig line. (but beware, results are not right) I'm planning to spend Sunday afternoon completing it.. so check it next week

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Thats great IndyCash !! http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif BTW, would you be able to produce MT4 codes ?

--- 帖子 #509 ---
If your charting package has pattern recognition, you can filter out for "three white soldiers" and "three black crows" found here: http://www.candlesticker.com/Cs63.asp http://www.candlesticker.com/Cs74.asp The one thing I think might improve the Simple Daily results is to use a filter of some sort. For the Simple Daily, I might check the H1 RSI(96) of the first candle . (You accomplish this with the offset in MQL.) If it is below 50 before 3 white soldiers, that means the market has reversed.... possibly a stronger signal than just 3 white soldiers in an already bullish market. I know, I know.... "use a filter" is cliche.... but in the end it can help the results. Unfortunately you have to manually try different settings.

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Once you hit your 2nd T/P level, if you want to stay in the trade, try placing the S/L at the low (for longs) or high (for shorts) of the most recent bar. So basically, all you would be doing is opening your platform at the end of the day, and, assuming you are still in the trade, moving your stop loss to that days high/low, and continuing to do that until you get stopped out. If you go back and look at these SIMPLE trades on your chart, you will see that many of the winners will really move hard and fast in the direction of your trade for several bars before the momentum is exhausted. Trailing the S/L immediately behind the trade keeps you at a pretty safe distance most of the time. But I think that this S/L method would work best only after the trade has confirmed by moving a certain distance in your favor (thats why I say after you take your second T/P) to get out of its own way. Otherwise, the initial chop at the launch pad may get you stopped out too quickly.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Just a brief observation about the "market" in general. The last ten days have seen tremendous turmoil and confusion. People, traders, institutions, central banks, etc. have no real idea about how wide-spread the "credit crunch" is (or has been.) Indeed, I heard one learned fellow say that "We don't even know what we don't know" (example: BNP in France . . . No exposure on Monday . . . OOPS on Wednesday!) The US is no exception (the epicenter of this current credit fiasco!) There are millions of mortgages out there . . . many of which should have NEVER been approved (based on any reasonable basis!) Zero-interest, stated income, adjustables, etc. . . . all designed to make the sale . . . and now, as these 2-3 year old mortages "adjust," and payments skyrocket . . . homeowners have begun to default at a ridiculous rate . . . this will accelerate for the next 12 to 18 months. Bottom-line, the credit crunch/liquidity problem will get much worse before it gets better (my opinion only.) Consequently, with the BNP news, etc., the currency pairs sold short (to the USD.) However, I am hopeful that as time passes, the market will return to some "normalcy" . . . the reason . . . I think SIMPLE (and any system) performs better in calmer waters. And I for one, wanna get my testing/paper trading done as soon as is possible! Sorry for being a little off topic . . . however macro-economic news takes its toll on currency trading! Something we should always check and consider with our SIMPLE setups and trades. Thanks again THING for SIMPLE! Warm Regards, K

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Actually these times are excelent times to test this strategy.....if it makes it through these it will show the robustness of the system, we already know from past data the this system works quite well.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Yep, very good times for SIMPLE! And, we are only getting started with it! K

--- 帖子 #514 ---
JD I'm suprised you'd say this, being the veteran that you are. We all know "past performance doesn't guarantee future results."

--- 帖子 #515 ---
tdion, a good point....but after looking at several years of past data, this still seems a very resonable and profitable strategy....... I was also looking at the addition of Jack's anti-hedge, and I think it would work very well with this strategy.......

Looks to be an interesting setup for CABLE on Monday's open . . . that is if we are following the basic &amp; original rules of SIMPLE (we can ignore Sunday candles - "no count SUNDAY's") I am certain that many here will jump the gun . . . and take today's opening . . . still I will stick to the original rules.

So what set ups are people watching? Swissy looks like a possibility in a couple of days.

--- 帖子 #522 ---
It's 19:30 GMT and my charts start their new day at 20:00 GMT, in 30 min. The Swissy / USD and EUR pairs seems to be reversing so I don't think we will get a third day downtread today with a 20/50 EMA confirmation. However, The CAD / USD and EUR both are having a good third day down with the 20/50 EMA confirmation so I'm thinking to short these two.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
I've backtested this with a few pairs (eurjpy, eurusd, gbpusd, gbpjpy). So far, the best system is gbpjpy. See this post for detailed results: http://londonsession.blogspot.com/20...le-system.html

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Currently . . . 3:50 PM Pacific Standard Time The EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY appears to be trending (slight but there . . . and still early in today's daily candle) toward a thrid day UP bar close . . . we will just have to wait to see what the rest of the day brings. Also watching the AUD/USD (DITTO - very early too) GBP/JPY --- daily @ 3:50 PST http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1187650402

--- 帖子 #525 ---
I have been away for a few days. I see there have been some good opportunities, especially those huge moves with the jpy crosses last Thursday. If you'd let it run for 24 hours, you might have picked up a few hundred pips, or if you'd placed a moving stop loss once you'd got in profit 100 pips, you could have made closer to 500 pips+! That would have put a smile on my face for sure. Anyhow, I'm sure I'll get it on the next one. Looking at the charts tonight, there are a couple of setups that meet our specifications but they don't grab me as much as I'd like them to. EUR/CHF is presenting a bearish three bar set up but these three bars have come after a doji, whereas I like to see the pattern immediately after a top (or bottom in an uptrend). Also, the CHF hasn't proven to be the best performer with this strategy, so I'm going to sit this one out (it'll probably move 500+ pips now I've said that). USD/CAD is a little more interesting, but it isn't a big mover so if I were to place a trade on this one my tp and sl levels would be pretty tight, close to the pivot points.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
I have been testing the system on a demo account for the last 13 days. I use 3 lots and set a TP of 30 pips. Not letting the lots run yet. So far I have 6 winners and 0 losers. The demo account is up $2900. I have traded GBPJPY, AUDUSD, Pound and the Swissy. Latest was the Swissy last night. Not entirely scientific but I think the best part of the system is that you don't over trade. It also teaches patience!

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Anyone home?

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Very quiet. No set ups to be seen at the moment, the markets are a bit rattled after last week which doesn't really lend itself to the simple system. Plus, I guess people have seen that it works, it's simple and there isn't much more to be said on the matter. It's just a case of incorporating it into their trading repertoire. I think it is plain to see that the system is very effective on the D1 charts with certain pairs but for the more active traders like myself, I am interested to see if the same principal can work on shorter time frames. I've just been looking at the 15m charts for the EUR/JPY and the first indications look pretty good. A trader friend of mine who trades the USD/CHF uses two bar set ups on smaller time frames (1H, 4H) and produces some positive results. So, although people may feel that we have exhausted the subject of the Simple Daily System, it has opened up a whole school of thought that is well worth investigating. As long as there are pips to be made I will continue to develop and add to my trading wisdom and methods.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
pavejon, are u using North Finance for your charts or some other broker? also do u incorporate the 20/50 EMA filter with your trades? thanks

--- 帖子 #530 ---
On Oanda 's chart, EUR/CHF has been declining for eigth consecutive bars..will this consider as one setup ? http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif

--- 帖子 #531 ---
I wrote an EA for this. It's a bit(a lot) messy right now since I wrote it in pieces, and the results are so-so. It only really seems profitable with default parameters (SL = 90, TP1 = 30, TP2 = 100) on the GBP/USD. See if it's working ok. It ignores Sunday bars right now which I don't think is smart. Sunday bars seem to tell a lot about the movement. If it's a doji, the movement tends to hesitate, if it moves hard against the current trend it usually means the trend is over-ish. Anyway, here it is.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
According to the original rules this would have been a TP and a second entry.....or one really nice trade using a trailing stop. as to time frames I have found this will work on the 4 hour charts (3 hour at Oanda) also some pairs on the hourly......it will also work on the weekly and monthly charts.... just a little something to broaden your horizons...... on the shorter TFs you would use tighter TPs and SLs using the ATR is still probebly your best bet.....on the weekly and monthly you would use micro or nano lots with wider TPs and SLs......

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Is anyone trading this system exclusively?

Hi all . The filter for the 4h time frame are the same as on the daily ? Thanks .

--- 帖子 #539 ---
I am using MT4 downloaded from the Strategybuilderfx site. Not sure of the data source. I have not used the filter only the 3 bar set up and then open a trade on the open of the fourth bar.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Has anyone tried messing with the EA yet? How are your results? I'm curious. I only got to run a few brief tests with it before going to sleep last night.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
The Thing, In summary, for you, which are the more interesting pairs to trade? thank you

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Apparently, everyone has concluded that SIMPLE is no longer "fast" enough for them. However, with due diligence, the setups presented by SIMPLE do produce many, many more profitable trades than do other "faster" systems. Well, OK. I will continue with SIMPLE. And hopefully use it to great long-term advantage. I had hoped that you talented currency guys would help confirm the principles of SIMPLE (with backtests, forwardtests, etc.) I had also hoped that we could then use our collective results and observations about the tested pairs to enter good trades as they developed with SIMPLE's backtested and revised SL's, TP's, "indicators," etc. (by pair) Sadly, FOR WAY TO MANY OF US, SIMPLE's finest attribute is its worst curse! The trades take time to develop . . . 3 candle days! Apparently, this is more time than folks can tolerate. Too bad. Still, I wish you all well with your "faster" trades and systems. I think, in fact I know, that I will keep plugging away with SIMPLE. Best regards, K

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Concur, I will stay with the "Simple system".

--- 帖子 #544 ---
I too will be keeping it simple, i have all the time I need to wait for the setup. So far of the pairs I have listed none yet fllfill the three bar rule yet. there are trades that certainly could have been taken and been profitable but they did not conform to the rules. sooooo you are correct in saying this simple system is for the hunter.....and not for those that suffer from buck fever.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Hi all, Firstly all thanks to The Thing for sharing this system and for everybody who is trying to make the systems work. I have studied this system in depth, ran back tests out of MT4's history center for the last seven years and a 14MB file is the result. All test were done manually. Please bear with me as I tell you what I have done. The only thing that I have added was to open the trade with 3 lots, first lot close on TP 30, the second lot close on TP 60 and the last to close on TP 100. I needed to optimize the trades. SL for GBPUSD and EURJPY was 100 and for GBPCHF and GBPJPY IS 150, only forward testing will optimize this. GBPJPY (30,100) 105 P/M (30,60,100) 173 P/M GBPUSD (30,100) 70 P/M (30,60,100) 124 P/M The data from MT4 reports Date,Time,Open,high,Low,Close,Volume. Time and volume gets deleted as it is of no use. I then subtract Open and high,Open and Low, Open and close to get a "average pip movement" / currency pair. What I have realized is that if the average pip movement is below 60 the pair will not perform well, in the testing it was true that below 50 it always ended up in a loss at the end of the time period, Please comment on this as it makes sense to me, some pairs were as low as 24, so here are the pairs that I have found that does work, GBPUSD (66), EURJPY (62), GBPCHF (94), GBPJPY (91). As this forum progressed there were a few ideas that I also incorparated in my tests, one was that if there is a trend developing let it run, I then applied the same rules for "simple" at every open of the new candle. This test came back with exellent results +-700 pips/month for the 4 pairs, untill I broke down the data into end of year figures. The excel graph showed that in the first few years from 2000 that there was a downwards trend up to now as if the trends became less. YEAR EURJPY GBPCHF GBPUSD GBPJPY TOTAL AVE/MONTH 1999 1152 1510 296 3070 6028 502 2000 5226 7191 3140 5934 21491 1790 2001 2265 5944 -90 2340 10459 871 2002 520 4783 654 3771 9728 810 2003 3005 4553 2818 6651 17027 1418 2004 1148 873 1528 1441 4990 415 2005 -1107 -1430 2038 1287 788 65 2006 -1327 1323 1880 -1911 -35 -2 2007 1213 219 -313 2867 3986 332 I have also tested the GBPUSD with and without sunday candles and it only made a difference in 1999 and 2007. YEAR SUNDAY NO SUNDAY 1999 296 -342 2000 3140 3140 2001 -90 -90 2002 654 654 2003 2818 2818 2004 1528 1528 2005 2038 2038 2006 1880 1961 2007 -313 510 The other idea that came to mind was to TP of the 3 lots at 30 to give 90, only tested this on GBPUSD and GBPJPY, GBPUSD 104 P/M GBPJPY 108 P/M I hope this info helps

Excelent.....Thank you for your info and hard work

Hi All I've been lurking for a few weeks before posting. Read through the whole thread a couple of times. Thank you TheThing, for introducing us to this Simple system and to everyone who has posted. An enthralling and stimulating wealth of info. I was inspired to open a dummy account at North Finance and I've been monitoring/paper trading different pairs. Just to get a feel of things. Been doing a limited bit of back testing too using the original Simple rules (plus EMAs). I've also been trying to find a way to determine optimum SP and PO for each pair at different times. Nothing worthwhile reporting yet. In fact I wasn't going to post until I felt I had something useful to add to the debate. But I am prompted to jump the gun by Kev-K's recent post. Please don't disappear, Kev-K! I entirely agree with your hope that we might harness the power of everyone here (like a mini wikipedia) to work out between us how to refine the system parameters and which pairs are most worthwhile to trade. It seems that most people have reported here that the Simple System works for them. Just as TheThing said in his very first post. So keep the faith, Kev-K and all the many others who feel the same way. Let's not lose the elegant simplicity of something that fundamentally works by trying to re-invent it with extra bells and whistles or paint go-faster stripes down its side in the hope of getting more and quicker trades. There are countless speedy systems about for those who need more action. Another solid day trading system is invaluable for the many of us who can't or who don't want to hug their computers day and night. So apologies for a somewhat odd first post. And thanks again to IndyCash and Haywire and... all the others too many to mention and of course, again, TheThing. Best wishes to all from London Chris

Bravo Haywire! Thanks so much for your fine work! I appreciate the effort it took to test SIMPLE like this. Look forward to reading and thinking about your results! Thanks again! K

I, too, came across this thread at the beginning of last week. Decided to test it (demo) with four mini lots, four trade days. Also, for a couple of days I tried to use it on every qualifying pair, as many as eight pairs (not wise for real account, of course, and wore me out when alarms started going off). Bottom line, 4 trading days, $4711.91, more than 5000 pips. Unusual, very trendy week. Decided to try to be more rational this week and not trade any similar pairs that might present themselves after getting burned badly Monday on EUR/CAD and USD/CAD. And Tues, no setups. Bottom line, gonna keep playing with it. Like others, still trying to come up with optimal SL and TP, but a % of ATR seems more reasonable than a flat number. Keep up the good work on this idea. Oh, suggestion for a possible strategy: if more than one pair is eligible for trade, pick one and enter the other when the first is at the first TP whend the stop is moved to breakeven. Don't know if it would work, but ii reduces exposure to catastrophe. The end.

AWESOME observation Haywire! I have been quiet as I didnt want to post again until my backtester was 100% perfect. But I had included that calcuation into the backtester so thought now might be a good time to mention it.... as it will allow people to easily to test those numbers and find others. Just select "Calculate True Range" and an extra column will appear with that days range.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Thanks for your new backtester! But I can't find the final results of the backtest in pips?! Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Tick the box that says "Calculate Trade Results" This is what the final version will look like with all options done btw: http://www.indycash.com/simple/test.php (not all options work on that test one)

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Uh of course... Thanks! I'd like to see the option to use a different start time again. Would that be possible? I use a different time as close than GMT 0:00. Regards - Xaron

--- 帖子 #554 ---
What is the current consensus on the ENTRY rules for the SIMPLE system? I know several different filters were considered and I see MA's on some of the more recent charts. Could someone please post the current entry rules, with filters?

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Thanks for the latest backtester, IndyCash. I've been trying to relate the results to the charts I'm using from North Finance. What close time does it use? Thanks Chris

--- 帖子 #556 ---
I agree that was a good option, but trying to do it is what stumped me in the first place.. as the data does not always contain complete days of 96 x 15 minute periods (as no data I can find seems to) it's not possible for me to do that without some errors creeping into the output. :\

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Indy, Just an observation about your TERRIFIC tester . . . NorthFinance's data stream reports Open/Close-High/Low numbers that are slightly different from your tester. What is the data source for your tester? Here in California (USA) I am -7 GMT. The NF data opens a daily bar a 2:00 PM PST (-7GMT) This time translates to 9:00 PM local time in the UK (2100 Hrs) 5:00 PM local is: 2400/0000 GMT (midnight in the UK) . . . etc., North Finance opens at +2 GMT Again can't thank you enough for your efforts and hard work! Best Regards, K

. . . that she traded using SIMPLE! :-) +++++++ Tokyo housewife hid 1.7 million pounds in forex gains Fri Aug 24, 1:22 AM ET REUTERS A financially savvy Tokyo housewife who made 400 million yen (1.7 million pounds) trading in foreign exchange markets was fined on Friday for evading tax, a court official said. Yukiko Ikebe, 60, got a suspended jail sentence and was fined 34 million yen, after she used relatives' names to make her gains look smaller and avoid paying tax, NHK said. "She felt it was unfair to have to pay tax on her gains, when she made losses some years," NHK quoted the judge as saying. "She spent the money on kimonos and jewellery." Forex trading has become more popular in recent years in Japan, where low interest rates have led retail investors to seek new sources of profit.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
ftp://ftp.akmos.ru/pub/Dealing/history/ is the data source. They don't say what time offset from GMT it is collected at. Variance can also come in depending on the market the data is sourced from.... but the broker's address is in Moscow so I 'think' it's collected at GMT+4 I'd like to make it work with a variable starting hour like the original one... but I can't think of any way to do that and keep the results accurate.

YEP! The market opens for me at 2:15 PM PST on Sunday! Let's discuss ideas regarding the pairs that are looking good (whatever anyone wants to contribute will be fine!) I will post some of my ideas later. Regards, K

looks like I will also be in on sunday night on GBPJPY, GBPUSD and EURJPY Regards

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Hi Indy, The variance we are seeing between my data and your FINE testing tool data is due to the slight difference between the "Open-High-Low-Close" data that my server stores (I use a NorthFinance demo account) and the data that MetaTrader v4 stores in its "History Center" (what your tool uses.) Example: From MT4 select Tools History Center Select pair (example: GBP/JPY) Select time period (example: Daily) Select "Download" The following message will appear: (see below) The question is what to do about it. I suspect that we we will have to live with it. Additionally, could you please explain how your tool calculates the "Range" values? (sorry if you have already explained) Thanks a Million! Best Regards, K http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1187985689

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Hi Haywire, Here's an idea . . . and its OK to be wrong! On the 4HR, take a look at the "velocity" of these apparent trend lines. I like what I see in terms of the Daily chart for Sunday . . . LONG: GBP/JPY - GBP/USD - EUR/JPY 4HR: EMA20 beginning to peek above EMA50 ema20&gt;ema50 4HR: The GBP/USD &amp; GBP/JPY "5-Smoothed" looking good too with nice UP-velocity. LONG: Daily -- EUR/USD looks good too! 4HR "iffy" just now. LONG: Daily and 4HR -- AUD/USD looks good too! SHORT: Daily and 4HR -- USD/CAD looks to be possible SHORT No Setup: USD/CHF No Setup: GBP/CHF (just now . . still a few minutes to go in Friday trading) Let's look for other pairs. Anyone verify and comment? Just an idea? In the immortal words of NASA . . . we are GO for launch (preliminarily!) ;-) So, let's ALL evaluate what we are seeing! The beauty of SIMPLE is that we have TIME to think! Something the "faster" systems cannot offer! We can also enjoy our lives . . . away from these blasted screens! Example: it's a beautful Summer day and Friday afternoon here in California . . . gonna go for walk and think about what SIMPLE is trying to tell me for Sunday . . . just gotta listen to her! Then dinner and a Gin &amp; Tonic! Regards, K

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Hi Kev-K, I must agree, there is momentum in the ema's on the 4hr GBPUSD, looks good. 5 smoothed on the GBPJPY has made a turnaround and in a long and true, the 20ema&lt;50ema on the EURJPY. In my opinion, definitely trade GBPUSD and GBPJPY, EURJPY for the rules on the ema's not yet, 50/50. As for the other pairs I am not sure whether to trade or not to trade because of the "average pip movement" I prefer to work on calculated risk. Still time left to think as you said Regards, Haywire

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Definetly got some momentum goin with those pairs.....

Lots of SIMPLE setup on daily charts:- EUR/JPY, GBP/JPY, CHF/JPY, AUD/JPY, CAD/JPY, USD/JPY, AUD/USD, USA/CAD, EUR/CHF, GBP/CHF, GBP/USD But based on rule, either 20 &gt; 50 for long or 20 &lt; 50 for short...none fulfill that...so is a no trade .. http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon13.gif http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon5.gif

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Hey Kev, I could probably download and use that MT data.. but as they say in the warning.. even then it still wouldnt match your trading client exactly :\ I'll have a look at it though. The "Range" column calcs the True-Range (TR), which is the greatest among: 1. The variance between today’s high and today’s low. 2. The absolute variance between yesterday’s Closing Price and today’s Highest Price. and 3. The absolute variance between yesterday’s Closing Price and today’s Lowest Price. (absolute variance just means the difference, without caring if the number is positive or negative, for anyone that didnt know)

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Indy.... I seem to be getting a glitch in the tester...it shows both TPs taken which should cancel The SL ..... I reduced the TPs for clairity http://img301.imageshack.us/img301/1...enshot2rh3.png

--- 帖子 #570 ---
It seems to me that one could almost take their pick of pairs on Sunday night using the simple SIMPLE. Since there are so many choices (I count about 13), and most people can't afford or desire to play them all, the use of modifiers makes sense. The above posts suggest using a 20ema crossing 50ema, but variably seem to apply to EITHER the 4h or daily chart. So, would it be smart to use the highest chart first, and then the 4h if you cannot find "enough" pairs? Someone, anyone, has 26 hours to answer... the clock is running. Or, heck, play them all since we're demo-ing anyway.

--- 帖子 #571 ---
In an ideal world, we want to use the Daily chart. With, three good daily candles (up or down.) For a long trade, the EMA20&gt;50 with a steady upward 5day-smoothed average trend. For a short, reverse the ideas above. We also do not count count Sunday candles (Any new ideas on this point?) For the record, I have ONLY used the shorter time-frame (4HR) to estimate any trend "velocity" that MIGHT be present going in to Friday's close. It is not a rule, or indicator, or anything other than that. We need to consider and talk about all SIMPLE ideas to refine our future trades. And, if we "trade" the setups presently before us . . . we will see if they are good or poor. Either way, we'll learn something for the longer-term that will increase our success. And so, I would like to hear ANY idea, observation, technique, or even "indicator," that has as its basis the basic SIMPLE ideas. And if we can relate them to our most tested pairs . . . and the pairs presenting SIMPLE setups today: GBP/USD, GBP/JPY, EUR/JPY, AUD/USD, etc. so much the better. I'm thinking that if we can learn to reliably (80%) trade SIMPLE with 1-6 pairs . . . YIKES! (in the long term!) Remember, there will be a lifetime of SIMPLE setups to trade. And the one after this is out there! Regards, K

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Hi FX4Live From a classical SIMPLE daily candle perspective . . . you are right on! the EMA's are not yet in proper alignment. So be warned ALL. I was looking at the 4HR chart to make any estimate I could as to the direction of price going in to Friday's close. At this shorter time-frame . . . the EMA's were just beginning to align properly (EMA20&gt;50) We will see.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
hi guys, think the EMA's on the EUR/USD are lookijng good,wat do u think

--- 帖子 #574 ---
This system looks very promising. I haven't read through the entire thread, so I'm not sure if someone else has created an expert advisor for metatrader for this method yet, but I have attached one that I created. Please test it out and let me know how it works for you. I've done some back testing but haven't traded with it live yet. These are the options and default values for the EA: TakeProfit1 = 30 TakeProfit2 = 100 Max_Stop_Loss = 90 Open_Close_Difference = 20 Allow_Trade_On_Sun = TRUE Allow_Trade_On_Mon = TRUE Allow_Trade_On_Tue = TRUE Allow_Trade_On_Wed = TRUE Allow_Trade_On_Thu = TRUE Allow_Trade_On_Fri = TRUE Allow_Trade_On_Sat = TRUE TakeProfit1 and 2 are the obvious first 2 TP's. Max_Stop_Loss is the maximum stop loss you are willing to take. If the rules state the stop loss should be less than this number, it follows the rules. If the rules say it should be higher than this number, it sets it to this number instead. Open_Close_Difference is the least amount of difference between the open and close price of a bar needed in order to count that bar. The other options allow you to disallow trading on certain days of the week. Backtesting with my data on the GBP/USD for 8/2/2006 - 8/2/2007 on a $500 USD deposit with TP1 = 39 and TP2 = 80, shows a resulting balance of 1769.97 trading 0.1 sized lots. If you have any questions, or suggestions for improvements, please let me know! If you find optimal settings for other pairs, let us know!

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Before anyone dives in tonight, it is worth noting that it is a bank holiday in the UK, so at the very least lower volumes should be expected. It may even be worth taking a back seat with the GBP pairs. I'll check back in later and see what's up with the charts.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Jason, can u pls send in mq4 format ?

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Yes, thanks for creating the ea, Jason. I too would appreciate it in mq4 format if you can.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Sure, here it is in both formats. This is a slightly newer version than the one I posted before. This new one has an additional option so you can adjust the lot size as well. Please post your test results/suggestions/optimal settings for each pair/etc. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Who is gonna take a trade! And why? There is some chatter on the GBP/JPY board that the yen pairs are at some kind of 100sma and 50% FIBO level . . . meaning price may reverse lower (based on 4HR chart.) Then move upward. However, there is similar chatter that the prie is moving higher as the GBP/USD and EUR/USD have easily moved through the 100sma! Go figure . . . their charting method is a complex one . . Butterfly's, FIBO's, EMAs, SMAs, etc. Remember, that that existing home sales in the US will release tomorrow (I thnk it will show weakness.) Be aware . . . I will close trades before tomorrow's announcement. MY OPINION ONLY! Regards, K

--- 帖子 #580 ---
I'm new to this system but as far as i've learned from the previous posts, we have a valid long entry of GBP/JPY on 27/8/07 Monday, am i right?

Jason, Thanks a million for posting the ea in mq4 format. Don't know why but can't get it to copy on to a chart. I put it in C:\Program Files\MetaTrader - North Finance\experts\indicators as usual. Any ideas? Cheers Chris

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Put it in C:\Program Files\MetaTrader - North Finance\experts

That's probably because it's not an indicator. It's an Expert Advisor. You would need to copy it to the experts folder only. Thanks, Jason

Well, so much for Monday. Stopped on NZD/USD, but still in and losing on AUD/USD and EUR/USD. Maybe they'll recover. Looks like no trade for tomorrow and Wed unless someone sees something I don't. Someone want to post what our CURRENT strategy is? For instance, 1) avoid news, 2) use what is on the initial post (w/stop is the lesser of a)90p or b)prev day's high/low difference or c)50% of ATR from entry), 3) enter if there's a 20/50ema cross on daily (or 240??), 4) don't open trade within prev. day's range 5) use 25% and 75% of ATR for TP with 2 lots, or 3 lots with TP at 25%/75%/run to reverse. Anything else?... since we have a couple of days?

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Well, I got absolutely slaughtered, none of the TP's on the trades I took were hit, a couple got stopped out and a couple are still hovering in the red. Admittedly, my entries were pretty sloppy as I didn't really have time to look at the price action and pivot points. Hopefully yesterday was just an anomaly, but it seems that every set up was a wrong 'un and you'd have lost bucks if you'd been in on them. As I said, yesterday was an extraordinary day because there was a bank holiday but I still thought that we'd do OK. IMO, every losing trade is a lesson paid for (even if it's on a demo account), so what can we learn from this? I'll be taking a closer look in the next couple of days, but I'd love to hear what you guys reckon.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Hi all, Yesterday, followed the rules, Got 130 pips on the GBPJPY, 30 pips on GBPUSD, 30 pips on EURJPY, on the EURJPY I know it was against the rules but I was tempted. Anybody else with feedback? regards, Haywire

With TP 30 . . . . Cable made money

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Good result, Haywire. Interesting that by following the original rules (ie no emas) you picked up some bounce up on these three before they went south. I held off because of 50&gt;20. It started me thinking about the emas and how best to use them. Clearly if they keeps us out of more bad trades than than good then fine but I can't help thinking that the original system that THING started here didn't have them. Are we improving it or not? Unfortunately I haven't got any back testing to help resolve this. But USD/JPY, AUD/USD, and EUR/CHF all followed the same pattern as those above - i.e. bounced a bit (profitably) in the direction of the set up bars against the direction of the emas before following the trend indicated by the emas. I don't seem to be able to get all the possible charts up on North Finance and can't therefore see what happened to all of them. Interestingly though with USD/CAD the set up and the emas both indicated a short trade but it went long but not before a quick profitable dip down. This post is a bit all over the place, I know. That's because I have conflicting thoughts. It is throwing up questions. Does Kev-K's technique of looking for clues in the 4H emas get us further? Or perhaps the ema periods of 20 and 50 are not the optimum (why 20 and 50 anyway?)? Or should we just forget about emas after all and Simply http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif rely on the increased velocity of three strong bars? Mind you I am convinced of the wisdom of using the prevailing ATR to determine each pairs po and sl. That, to me, does make sense! What a fascinating thread this is... thanks again to everyone and hope you come back soon, THING.

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Chris001, RE: GBP/USD, GBP/JPY, EUR/JPY, EUR/USD, and AUD/USD Perhaps, we should go back and re-evaluate (compare) good SIMPLE trades with the Daily to "EMA20-to-EMA50" relationship? The mistake yesterday may be something "simple" . . . we may have violated the SIMPLE(v2.0) rules by entering a LONG when EMA20&lt;50. Just thinking out loud. As for the 4HR chart . . . I was only using it to determine if price had upward "velocity" going into Friday's close. It was! However, it might have meant nothing! Regards, K

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Thought I'd let you guys know that I've made my EA available for free and will post new updates here ( http://www.txpg.com/sub-forex-metatr...ily-system.php ) I will also try to make a post in this thread to let everyone know of any updates. If you guys have any test results or suggestions, please send them my way. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #604 ---
The pairs that had 3 bullish candles and were candidates for the SIMPLE strategy were the victims of negative (bearish) divergence. In all the reversals, price had made a lower swing high but a divergence indicator (MACD histogram and/or stochastics) had made a higher swing high. That is called hidden or reverse divergence. In this particular case it was negative or bearish. Divergence is an accurate way of predicting price reversal, however. you don't know exactly when the reversal will take place. You could have very well gotten your 30 or 60 pips before price reversed but taking such a trade would be risky. Spotting divergence could keep you out of the riskier trades. Discussing divergence is beyond the scope of this thread so if anybody is interested in learning more, this is the best site that I know of. www.trading-naked.com/Divergence.htm

--- 帖子 #605 ---
No its not. Nothing is actually. The reason why it might works? Bacause there are more than 50% who believe in this hype... By the way the emas deteriorate the results considerably. Filters. You know the problem with filters that they filter out the good trades as well 99% of the time. Have fun

--- 帖子 #606 ---
The answer for the success is money management. Whatever the system/method/model is.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
One more thing. I will post some results for the GU after the 3rd bar approx 52% chanche that the next bar will be an up bar if the previous 3 were up. And, listen very well, if the previous 3 bars were bearish, down there is a 51% chance that the next bar will be a bullish bar. Reason? I dont know. Maybe interest rates. They drive currencies as well. This analysis I have made from 1999.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Whether divergence, fib levels, pivot points, trendlines etc. work because most traders use them (self fulfilling prophecies) is not important because they do work. Divergence can be an effective tool. Actually, its not part of my trading plan per se, but if I see obvious divergence opposite to my proposed trade, I will think twice about taking the trade. We are in agreement about one thing, that money management is the most important part of trading.

--- 帖子 #609 ---
One expression: Mass psychology . But that might change and then the tools change and people start talking about "the behavior of the market has changed" . It never changes it is always the same. And "we need to adapt the system" Hard cash and protecting your funds, managing positions etc are better. But I would rather vote for the tools you have mentioned than for any silly, colorful indicator.

--- 帖子 #610 ---
You might also just call it what it is......... Momentum .......trade the major trend and let the momentum work for you. A 20 period MA and a 110 will show you all you need to know

Looks like no possible trades (3 candles) until at least Sunday/MOnday session, not to mention 20/50 cross. If anybody sees one, I'd be pleased to know.

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Watch USDCAD, At time of writing 10.45 (GMT+1) it is in the process of creating third down candle with Ema confirmation. EURCH, GBPCHF in process of creating third up candle but contra-indicated by Emas Chris

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Not convinced how well the CHF pairs work with this strategy. My results testing with these pairs have been very mixed and I'd be looking for some confluence elsewhere to confirm the impetus will carry over into a fourth day. USDCAD looks a bit more promising though.

--- 帖子 #615 ---
cad DOES look good for Sunday/Monday so far (1:30pm EDT). However, I'm just not seeing the 20/50 cross you're talking about on the daily where on my platform the 20 is below the 50 and has been since about the end of March (which is GOOD, of course). Is our strategy to look for cross on the 240, where it HAS crossed, or just the fact that it is under the 50 on the daily?? Also, do we care that it is likely to close above its low today and definitely above a low from last week? Take your time, I've got til Sunday night......

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Has anyone done any testing on this? I may be barking up a gumtree here (I'm pretty new to all this) and I'd be delighted if anyone can steer me right in my thinking but I am trying to devise a formula (simple ratio) to determine attainable profit objectives using the Average True Range. The original of 30 pips and 100 pips worked well enough when Thing first put this up in July. But this was only for that period, the six months or so from January 2007, and just for GBPUSD and GBPJPY. Clearly each pair is different and each time period is different. I thought to compare the historical minimum and maximum profits that could have been obtained on each winning trade (with benefit of hindsight), and see if it was possible to relate these to a factor of the prevailing ATR. This might give a way setting po1 and po2 that was dynamically responsive to the specific prevailing conditions. Some fictitious examples to explain what I mean. Supposing: Trade #1: A currency pair has an ATR = 125. Back testing showed that a profit of 110 (88% ATR) would theoretically have been available if the trade had been left to run before retracement. Trade #2: a week later when the ATR = 120, profit max of 45 pips (33% ATR). Trade #3: ATR = 110, max pips 95 (86% ATR) Trade #4: ATR= 110 , max pips 30 (27% ATR) I realise I have 'cooked the books' a bit here to make the point but don't you think that armed with a bunch of stats like it would be possible to work out likely Profit Objectives (for both lot 1 and lot 2) as percentages of the ATR? Assuming there is some logic in all this. The other question I have is what period should the ATR be? Too long and it becomes irrelevant to current conditions and too short it becomes meaningless. Any thoughts, ideas, help please? edit: I mean daily ATR of course

--- 帖子 #617 ---
As far as I know - and I am a newcomer to this - I think the emas are just a means to determine whether the trend is long or short. No need to see a cross as such (the original system did not have this at all). Also check the first post but I think the only thing that matters is the correct relationship between the open and close of each individual bar. Cheers

Hello guys! Two last weeks were crazy for me! Had a long business trip to several countries and only some time was left for me to watch the market and place my trades. I'm sorry I didn't reply to PMs as had a very limited access to my e-mail and forum as well. I'll reply them all soon. Now I'm able to edit my 1st post and will update it with our new filter, backtesting tool etc. As mentioned earlier I was going to open a live account to trade with this simple system. I did that on 16th of August with LiteForex . This is an offshore company located somewhere in Cyprus and I don't recommend to put huge deposit into LF, but about 1-5K is OK. If you click the image in my signature you can see some details of trading progress but one needs to know some russian language for better understanding. As for 26% increase in account there is nothing to proud but live trading helps me to struggle with emotions, fear etc while trading SIMPLE and some other daily systems. The key in trading daily systems is patience! Trade only when you see A trade setups and all the rules are in order. Thank you guys for keeping this thread alive while I was out. I hope I'm back to business and keep in touch Kind regards, TheThing

Well, welcome back home, Thing. I was afraid you were lost. I'll be watching for you to modify that first post, but meanwhile, it looks like maybe, as mentioned earlier, the USD/CAD short is the only one with three candles AND 20ema below 50ema on daily. On my platform three other pairs qualify on three candles and correct 20/50ema's on the 240m: EUR/CHF and GBP/CHF long, plus EUR/GBP short. Market opens in less that an hour. We shall see.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
No wonder there is no movement with USD/CAD, there are national holidays in the US and Canada. I guess all markets will be pretty flat today on account of the reduced trading volumes.

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Well, managed to reach first TP on USD/CAD but what a slooooow day with US and Canada both on holiday. So, my plan is to stay in. Did we come to a decision what to do at the end of a day if TPs not hit? Close and restart? Close and wait for three more candles? Ride it like a bucking bronco? ... So, for today it seems maybe the eur/cad and the aud/nzd qualify w/ their 20/50ema in the right direction. GBP/CHF seems to qualify on candles but not on ema. Is this a correct read?

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Seems like a solid assessment to me, although AUD/NZD is a little 'exotic' for me. There is some important data coming out of Aus in a couple of hours which could have a large effect on that pair. I'm going to stay in the USD/CAD at least until NY opens tomorrow unless there is a major shift. The EUR/CAD is a solid setup but seeing as I'm already tied to the CAD, I'll wait for some price action confirmation and halve the size of the lot. Not a fan of GBP/CHF with SIMPLE myself, especially with the 20/50 EMA as they are.

--- 帖子 #623 ---
I'd be interested to know why you are aren't a fan of GBP/CHF, birdt? And yes welcome back, Thething

--- 帖子 #624 ---
NOTE TO SELF: Be wary of "snugging" the stops when you go to bed, or you may wake up stopped out of EUR/CAD for a 27pip loss, instead of finally hitting the first TP for a 30p gain. Profit WAS taken on the AUD/NZD,however. Again, don't add an incorrect trailing stop overnight or you may wind up getting 23 pips on that final lot instead of the current 90! To paraphrase someone: no trade is completely worthless. It may serve as a bad example.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Ed, I got stopped out just like you on EURCAD. Saw it was moving well so I figured I'd move the stop in to 30 pips from entry, which it later hit and then bounced right down where it would have made some money for us. Definitely shows a lack of trading discipline which would have negated the pips I'd hauled from USDCAD had I not used just a half lot. Why am I not a fan of GBPCHF? It's nothing personal, just quite a large spread and I don't think the CHF pairs work that well with this method.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Back from a business trip. Glad to see that SIMPLE has a loyal following! The market is so troubled right now and soild three day setups are hard to find! But together we'll find em! Best regards, K

--- 帖子 #627 ---
So to recap what pairs do you guys prefer? What I mean is which pairs do work well and which ones don't?

--- 帖子 #628 ---
North Finance GMT+2 Looks like 3rd candle forming on cable, 20 crossing above 50 both showing an upward curve long term trend is up(weekly) 3rd candle breaking through 61.8 fib retrace of 24/7 high and 17/8 low. watch and wait for close. Am I reading this right Also GB/CHF 20 under 50 3rd candle forming and breaking through 38.2 fib retrace of 17/8 low and 4/9 high but 2nd candle open/close neutral would this still be considered.

--- 帖子 #629 ---
The EUR/USD also looks like a third bullish candle will result today with the ema20 just moved above the 50 None of this counts until Monday morning now though I guess.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Close to end of day, and, in addition to the EUR for Sun/Mon, maybe the cable, and swissy qualify with correct ema's. Eur/Cad doesn't have the ema's right. Aud/Nzd has been up each day for a week and I just keep entering (wish it was real money)! Still not sure of the entry point and stop when the start of the 4th candle is below the high of the prev. candle (for long) so I just go ahead and enter whenever I sit down at the computer and start examining pairs.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
On my North Finance charts there appear to be 4 potential trades for tomorrow: GBPUSD, EURUSD - 3 up candles, Emas just turned up 20&gt;50 USDCHF, GBPCHF - 3 down candles, Emas 50&gt;20 Some questions to ponder.... Friday's candle was very long (US non-farm payroll effect?) and that means stops will be placed at 90 pips above or below open as the 2 pips above/below rule would result in excessive stops of around 127, 105, 141, 209 pips. 90 pips is ok if you are using a dummy account but I'm not sure how comfortable I'd be with 90 pips (x2 = 180 for 2 lots) when real money is at stake given that the potential profit of these is is only 130 pips? Not such a great risk/reward ratio. But why 90 pips anyway? It seems totally arbitrary given the different ranges and volatilities involved. Wouldn't it make more sense for stops to be placed in some relation to the individual pair's characteristics? A percentage of ATR for example? Or given that we are trading momentum wouldn't it be reasonable to set them much tighter on the basis that if the momentum has dried up by the fourth day we don't want to be in the trade anyway! So how about an initial stop level based of the difference between yesterday's open and the relevant extreme +2? The logic being that the momentum will have run out today if today's candle retraces as far as that? This would give stops for tomorrow of 78, 29, 15 and 13 pips respectively. I concede that some of these feel a bit too tight. But maybe there's a compromise? Use average of past two days/greatest of past two days... etc.. I'm afraid I haven't got any back data to support any of this. Just throwing it up for discussion. As always finding the right place to exit either at po or sl is so much trickier than entering. Chris

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Did anyone else trade on Monday? It was an u nusual day given the large shift on Friday due to the unexpected non-farm payroll news. Personally I wouldn't have traded for real because of that but here is what happened in my dummy account: GBPUSD (long) ATR(56) 116, ATR(20) 128 Open 2.0277 Max Low (10.00) 2.0262 - 15 Max High (12.30) 2.0329 + 53 Stopped Out at Opening level (18.00) Using current exit rules: PO1 +30 pips, PO2 0 pips EURUSD (long) ATR (56) 72 ATR (20) 77 Open 1.3771 Max Low (06.30) 1.3766 -5 High (12.30) 1.3805 +34 Using current exit rules: PO1 + 30 pips, PO2 + ? still out there! At time of writing (Tuesday 12.00 GMT) Max High is 1.3829 = + 58 pips USDCHF (short) ATR (56) 75 ATR (20) 71 Open 1.1876 Max High (06.15) 1.1879 -3 Low(10.30) 1.1840 +36 Stopped Out at Opening level (12.00) Using current exit rules O1 + 30 pips, PO2 0 pips GBPCHF (short) ATR(56) 159 ATR(20) 168 Open 2.4082 Max High ( 06:45 ) 2.4109 -27 Low(10.30) 2.4031 +51 Stopped Out at Open level (11.00) Using current exit rules: PO1 + 30 pips, PO2 0 pips I'm not trying to draw anything specific from these 4 results but I am trying to learn how to optimize exits (PO and Stops) under any circumstances. Here are some ideas: 1) Use Tight Stops no more than PO1. 2) Is there any relationship discernible between ATRs and POs? 3) Or trade more (mini-)contracts to allow a greater range of profit taking points (usung trailing stops). This would cover potentially wider ranges. Based on a percentage of ATR e.g. 30%, 50%, 75%, 100% etc…? Anyone any thoughts/observations? Cheers all

--- 帖子 #633 ---
I have done similar testing with great results... For my test I have used 6 units... TP levels were 15%, 30%, 45%, 60% and 75% of the ATR and the 6th unit was the EOD that is end of the day unit to have a chance for trends... The result was approx 8 pips / unit a day or 40 - 50 pips a day. There are other things like I've put in the test to BE the SL after the first or second tp was hit....

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Thanks for coming back bullrock - good to get your input. Great idea to have 6 different TPs. Questions: 1. Do you mean by the 6th EOD unit your exit was at the close whatever the price? 2. How did you decide SL or were you using the original 90 pips or 2 pips more formula? 3. You say you moved your SL to BE after taking 1st/2nd profit. With 6 units to play with did you consider locking in profit by moving them up to each TP in turn? Any figures? 4. What ATR period were you using? Hasn't it gone quite round here! A week or so back there was lots of activity. Where is everyone?! Cheers Chris

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Bullrock, I think thats an awesome idea. So when you move your SL to BE is it after the first TP or second TP? As far as the last unit there are a number of exit strategies that capitalize on trending markets? Of course one would be trailing the exit by X bars. Have you tried this? And is your strategy a one-size-fits-all or is it optimized for a certain pair? Some pairs are funky. How does using the ATR for exit numbers fare against using the Average Daily range(year to date) for exits? As far as I understand it ATR is more of a weighted oscillator where Daily Range is a true average. Obviously this isn't something I have thought a whole lot about. EMAs might also offer TPs or areas of resistance. How do weekly, monthly, and yearly highs/lows figure into it? Finally how do you treat formations? For instance if you get an IB,OB, or PB do you move stops? More may come to mind later. Best of luck dude.

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Can someone please tell me what IB, OB and PB stand for?

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Chadriz, while all those things might improve your chance of profit, it sure makes the SIMPLE less simple. Just adding the 20/50 ema (for direction indication) and the percentage ATR for TPs (for better accuracy than fixed number for all pairs) seems about all I would want to add (in my present thinking). BUT, it would behoove anyone to add whatever they wish, to help them be profitable. Still a bit unclear about stop loss (for long trade): 1)previous day's low (add spread?); 2) 50 pips below entry; 3) 50% of ATR below entry; 4) W.A.G. Keep it coming. I still like it.

--- 帖子 #638 ---
You do not need the EMAs and could use just 2 bars for confirmation. I can prove that with calculations.. It works as it is.. Plain simple. You do not need ATR as well just decide 30 or 40 or 90 pips but even better if you find a SR level and you put it below that for long or above that for short.... Have fun... They are just overcomplicating it... This kind of system has appeared earlier without the EMAs. It works. Maybe you can use RSI above 50 long below 50 short... But that is me.

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Can you say more about this 2 instead of 3, Bullrock? I know that this was suggested some while ago but I never saw that anyone had explored it in any detail.

--- 帖子 #640 ---
As far as IB(inside bar) OB(outside bar) PB(pin bar). RSI? I am NOT a fan on RSI. Why?? First off it is an EMA derivative. Secondly it is prone to bogus signals with the default setting. Thirdly almost every indicator in one way or another emulate or follow EMAs but DO NOT give the advantage of showing possible S&amp;R like EMAs do. (which if you have the EMAs on the chart you will see what I'm talkin about). As far as ATR I'm not really sure about that one b/c one can know when a currency is most likely to move (time frame) and how much just by studying the time it trades heavily and they will have a much more accurate idea of how far is to far for a trade to run. Exits/TPs You will only know what you have studied/experienced. So if you haven't done extensive back-tests on different exit strategies then you don't know that answer. I don't know what the best exit is yet either (for my style) b/c I'm buried in back-testing homework. I also rarely try to apply a strategy to multiple pairs with identical rules. ~~Future S&amp;R~~ As far as knowing future S&amp;R thats an open-ended argument. If we could know that easily, this forum would have no purpose. S&amp;R on it's own is very elusive. That's where confluence comes in (Chart formations, Highs/Lows,convergences &amp; divergences, range during high-volume times, fractals, channels, yada yada yada.) ~~Simple systems~~ Every single system that has come along that was simple has been "optimized" not for accuracy but for the comfort levels of the individuals. Not everyone here is going to trade this system the same way. Some want a more statistically accurate system and some want a more simplistic system. Trading is very personal and as such you have to tailor every system to your personal mindset. I am a numbers-head so I personally do not care how long it takes to fully test and exhaust variables in any given system. I also do not care about how complex it makes the system. The only thing I care about is how much more accurate can I make the system. Obviously my mindset does not really fit into this thread by definition, however I only chimed in after much debate so... In closing I want to say that my opinion is only right for me and my trading style. You have to find what fits your personality and thats the real optimization.

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Cable is showing an interesting formation. Anyone thinking about taking it?

--- 帖子 #642 ---
so i just found the thread a few days ago and i am very attracted to the simplicity of this system. mmm simple, just my style . anyways i just started demoing it and i'll post my success/failure here. oh, im also tweaking the MAs for the heck of it and i'll post results here of my backtesting and other findings. thanks!

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Hello! This is my first post, but i've been watching this tread from the begining. And I can't understand why it is so quiet now! Noone is writing anything about it (even people who started) and I think this strategy is really good! I've been using it on my life account for 2 months now. The results are really good! I would like to say thank you for that to TheThing! It really helped a lot!

--- 帖子 #644 ---
I´m wondering that too! Has everyone gone on top another thread somewhere?

--- 帖子 #645 ---
In this months issue of Stocks and Commodities the have an article on ForexFactory and mention this site as the one the author read all the post. &lt;&gt;&lt; Chris

--- 帖子 #646 ---
So, it's Sunday evening where I am and the market just opened. It appears to me the only qualifying pairs might be AUD/USD and NZD/USD. If not, why not? Are there others?

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Bonita, I don't really understand your question. Pls make ur question clearer. jack

--- 帖子 #648 ---
I'm still watching. Cable fits the spec but the last candle yesterday may suggest a reversal. I probably won't take a position because of it, although I will keep an eye on shorter time frames.

--- 帖子 #649 ---
I play demo and live with this method for one month now and today was my first bad trade GBP/USD.

--- 帖子 #650 ---
That's unlucky but it was never an A trade with that Pin Bar. Simple as the system may be, a little discretion to filter out the iffy trades will increase the percentage of trades that are winners. Tonight I see that Aud/Cad meets some of the criteria. My only reservation is that the last bear bar was just a correction rather than the end of a streak of bear bars, so it wasn't really a 'bottom'. Still a good trade though I reckon, so I'm looking for a good entry on lower time frames.

--- 帖子 #651 ---
i have been collecting pips on this pair (USD/CHF) on a daily basis :- 20/9/07 - 150 pips 21/9/07 - 50 pips 24/9/07 - 75 pips 25/9/07 - 35 pips 26/9/07 - 60 pips Using even more simpler method, no indicators, nothing at all...but do not want to upset this thread, will try to post a new thread on my system once i let this running for another week. This thread &amp; system has been great but the only set back is got to wait till the setup which many of us don't like waiting...especially me...

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Great to see some more activity on this thread again. I´ve also been demo-ing for a while but I´ve been working away from home recently and I haven´t been able to monitor anything in the last month. I´d be really interested to see a summary of your various trades, kraszan, if you were prepared to post or pm me? Thanks

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Sounds interesting, fx4live. But how much more simple can it get! I look forward to hear more here or elsewhere. Please keep us posted. Chris

--- 帖子 #654 ---
First of all I was taking signals following the rules but was closing them by myself or manually. Some of the signals (I don't know exactly which ones) were taken following the rules but against the trend (less risk). This is my live result: 20.08 short USD/CAD (-180) pips signal was good but i've made a mistake with SL short USD/CHF +30 pips 26.08 short USD/CAD +5 pips 02/09 short USD/CAD +40 pips 09.09 short USD/CHF +30 pips buy GBP/USD +42 pips buy EUR/USD +37 pips 12.09 short USD/CAD +45 pips 16.09 short GBP/CHF +65 pips short GBP/USD +73 pips 20.09 buy NZD/USD +90 pips buy AUD/USD +85 pips 24.09 buy GBP/USD (-180) pips 25.09 short EUR/AUD +30 pips buy AUD/USD still running

--- 帖子 #655 ---
Thanks very much for posting your recent live results, kraszan. Very informative. I presume you mean the 20 EMA/50 EMA relationship when you say "against the trend"? But I don't understand how these are "less risk". Surely, going against the trend according to the system means they are, at least in theory, more risky?! Exits are always the trickiest aspect of trading, for me anyway. I have been trying to work out whether a PO, or multiple POs, based on a proportion/s of a currency pair's ATR makes sense. (Hope to publish this here in due course when I have a larger body of data.) You said you closed your trades manually - did you have any specific criterion?

Hi, this is my first post, though have been observing for almost a year, now. GREAT site. Thanks to ALL contributors &amp; comments. Congrats &amp; thanks to Thing for well thought out method &amp; system. Funny about Haywire's adjustment in system rules.... I've been looking into the 3 contracts vs 2, myself. With TP at 30 &amp; 50, vs Haywire's 30/60. Haven't tested yet (papertrade). However, I have used IndyCash's tester &amp; paper trade together to try a 30 Trailing Stop for TP # 2 rather than BE. Results for GBP/USD from 10/02/06 - 7/30/07 (IndyCash's tester) are net 1160 pips vs 530 for BE on # 2 stop. Weather it works of well in real life, I don't know. Further, on the other idea.... A TP#2 at 50 vs 100 yeilded 680 pips, rather than 530. I wonder if to combine these ideas: the TP#2 at 60, 30 Trailing stop, and 3 contracts vs 2, with 3rd TP at 100..... I don't have the software nor the smarts to use it. I wonder if anyone could try it, if seems at all reasonable. Good luck to all PeterO West Bath, Maine USA

FX4Live, Your posted results are very impressive. We are all interested in knowing the details of your simple system. Can you share them with us?

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Yes please, FX4Live, share your ideas with us. Even if you haven't 'perfected' them yet. In fact especially if you haven't. Work in progress - that's what makes this forum, and this thread in particular, so instructive. Cheers. Chris

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Spit it out will you! Obviously those results are very good, but they don't mean anything unless you tell us upon which systems of entry and exit they were made. Lower time frames perhaps?

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Glad to see you are online at the moment FX4Live... hope you are going to give us an idea!

--- 帖子 #667 ---
Hi All, I'm not sure whether this is the best method to use, i thought i would like to test further and see the result after a month or so. Since many of you are eager to know the method now than waiting, i'm now sharing it out but bear in mind that this is only my experimental method eventhough i have been using it in my live account and so far i manage to grow my account balance to about 10%. If you get blow up, don't blame me. I'm sure this method there is still plenty of rooms for improvement, some may find this as crabs but it work for me so far, thus, i welcome your comments &amp; suggestion but no dirty words please. I need time to type out the scenario but it will be quick and short, i promised. Sorry, if i upset this thread which originaly is meant for SImple System and now it evolve to as such. I need to get home now....will post it later if all of you don't mind. Will definitely get this write up within couple of hours...please be patient and bear with me for a while. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #668 ---
I'm looking forward to your system.

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Thanks FX4Live. Good to hear from you. Why don't you start a new thread specifically for your system? Then it won't confuse Thing's thing. Don't worry I'm sure you won't get any rude words! My experience on here is that everyone is only eager to help and learn. Cheers. Chris

Thanks for posting your system..........elsewhere! It has nothing to do with this system. For those that are considering employing a grid trading method, do take some time researching it on google and in these forums. Whilst the theory may be compelling, there is a real possibility of a disastrous margin call if the price moves well out of your grid. Grid trading is a long term strategy and the longer you play it, the more you are exposed to this risk. But good luck to those who opt for this strategy anyway. Now, back to the simple system. You might want to be around at 2200GMT, there's a few setups that could be worth considering.

--- 帖子 #673 ---
We've got Eur/Jpy showing three white daily candles in an uptrend, which has been pretty successful with this strategy in the past. There is quite a large shadow on yesterdays bar, which could imply some resistance at the 167.60 level but our longest tp should be placed around there (unless of course you want to ride it even further if it gets that far). Looking at lower time frames there could be evidence of a reversal but in my opinion it's still a good trade. There shouldn't be any news releases that effect this pair too much until 1300 GMT when some data comes out of the US. Hopefully we'll have some profits locked in by this point. As for SL's, I will be placing them at 85 pips from open + my spread, just over 1 ATR for the last 18 periods - why here? I don't know, still experimenting. EUR/USD also fits the bill but as it is closely related to the trade above I will probably leave it alone, especially due to news releases coming out in the US tomorrow. Happy trading all!

--- 帖子 #674 ---
Hey all, what's with this thread? Until the end of August it was fairly humming with activity. But now nearly everyone who used to post ideas, comments and refinements seems to have disappeared. Are you all off hiding somewhere else? Even theThing, our esteemed originator has vanished? Maybe everyone who was in at the beginning has now perfected their system and are just quietly raking it in! If anyone is still around at Friday 19th close I had USD/CAD and USD/JPY showing three down candles and EUR/USD and GBP/USD showing three rising ones - all EMA's in line.

--- 帖子 #675 ---
Well those four didn't do any good given the unusual movement today!

--- 帖子 #676 ---
I'm still with it Chris, just been focusing on a more active strategy lately. I guess people just got bored of it. Sad really cause I reckon it's got legs. Turns out it's not entirely revolutionary after all: Read more with some graphical representations here: http://www.streetauthority.com/terms...tesoldiers.asp and well worth distinguishing from the 'advanced block' candlestick reversal formation: http://www.leavittbrothers.com/educa...ck_bearish.cfm Want to find out more then do a google search on 'three white soldiers' or 'three black crows.'

Could you please do this EA for 1 hours charts and after 2 bars Thx?

--- 帖子 #679 ---
Thanks for the interesting urls birdt. Worth being wary when each successive candle is smaller/larger and closes further from its intraday high. You may be right about people getting bored. But I agree with you it has legs and it's ideal from my pov as I can't always trade actively during the day. It makes a great bread and butter system. I am still demoing at the moment trying to work out best sl's and po's related to ATRs. Hope to publish this when I have a good body of data. You mentioned you've been focusing on a more active strategy lately. Is it anything you can share here or elsewhere?

--- 帖子 #680 ---
I've been trading gbpjpy using the Auslanco 15m strategy. It's very much an intraday system so it isn't for everyone. One thing that could definitely be incorporated into SIMPLE is the 'momentum' indicator for confluence when we have a three bar setup. It's on most platforms and is very simple to use. If the line(s) are pointing up, then the momentum indicator suggests that that particular time frame will be bullish, and if down then bullish. I use three inputs - 1C, 10C and 14C so I get three lines. If all three are in agreement then I'm pretty confident that the price will move in the direction that the lines are pointing in. In this case you could adjust your position size or if the indicators don't all agree then you could abstain from opening a position or reduce your position size to align with your confidence in the trade. Experiment with it and see what you think.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Thanks, birdt. I'll take a look at the Auslanco threads. Also thanks for the idea of the three momentum indicators. Will experiment.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Here you go, a simple system that can be left alone (doesn't require being in front of a computer screen all day) which uses Momentum and 5SMA's on a daily chart. It can certainly be used in conjunction with the Simple System. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=54585 Bear in mind that this system is still being tested, but is showing some promising results.

Why did this thread die? I didn't keep up with it.... haven't read it since about page 10 or so..... Did it look unprofitable? Thx

Thanks..The Thing, I am very interested in Daily Charts with 20/50 EMA (Close). How do I get the 20/50 EMA on my Daily Chart? Best regards, Arnoldchidi

This thread is dead. Perhaps this may be of interest to some of the followers. I focus mainly on GBPJPY these days but I noticed a number of three candle formations which may or may not be valid depending on whether you are willing to trade contra-trend and how you define that trend. Three black crow formations exist on: AUD/CAD AUD/JPY AUD/USD EUR/JPY GBP/JPY NZD/USD and there is a three white soldiers (bullish) formation on: EUR/AUD They all look like pretty good set-ups to me, but I do have reservations about trading in such a thin market. Therefore I'd recommend reducing position size and leaving stops a little wider or profit targets a bit closer. Happy trading all!

I liked this little thread.... sorry to see it die away over time.... Did Indycash ever finish that backtester? I will keep an eye peeled, hope it comes back.

I think like most threads and systems people get bored with not being able to make their first million in a week or two .... so off they go in search of greener pastures... you know, the old grener grass syndrome....

--- 帖子 #418 ---
this incredible slow system WILL NOT make money for 98%, i guess. after three days in a row? I'd say a reversal trade must be better!

--- 帖子 #419 ---
WOW I remember when this thread was alive and kicking... IndyCash doing his backtester. Damn, 3 years ago... I'm getting old!

Another defunked system. The originator of the systems results were totally floored with huge errors. The system was then modified as they all seem to be when they lose. Funny how all these systems go back to price action to get in and out of trades, why not just learn and use price action in the first place.
