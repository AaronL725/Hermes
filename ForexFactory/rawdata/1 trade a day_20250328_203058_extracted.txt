This is not my idea but ,it took my fancy as I wanted an indicator used on it but the principle is sound Take the hi low of the Asian session,I will include a indicator that does this automatically. As the next market to open is London we want to watch any GBP spots I have set this up on gbpusd gbpaud gbpjpy gbpcad gbpchf gbptry We set a buy 10 pips above the high and a sell 10 pips below the low Once triggered we stay in until 1 of 3 criteria is met Our Stop is hit Our Target is hit The close of the day without our SL or TP being hit. An example of 2 trades are shown below A few notes No indicators are used to asses trend OB OS etc etc This is 100% mechanical We trade just once a day per spot Can be used with an EA The red horizontal lines are automatically drawn Set up your fib tool with just 0.00,50%100% after the numerical figure in the properties add %$ after the figure to get the price on the fib lines If a long is triggered place your 0.00 on the low and move the tool to get the 50% line on the high.The 100% line will give you your TP the 0.00 line will give you your SL Very important My life is changing daily some times I think I can day trade with the time i have other times my personal situation changes and I cannot regulary get to my PC hence my recent quite period This is a min time input system without the need to monitor on a regular basis once in. I have no stats etc etc so please no questions regarding that I managed to trade just 2 on the 6 GBP spots available to me as thats all I had set up for last week given my time and the fact Ive only started looking at this.This is a commercial product this is not my idea but I like the princple. If people want to use a different fib level for the tP or a different stop feel free.Lets throw all ideas into the pot but I dont want a clutter of indicators. y results for last week on my 2 spots GBPUSD +125+97+68+118-82 (+327) GBPAUD +143+4+116-145+114 ((+232) Total gain + 559 pips I have included The Hi Lo ind for the Asian session My template PS.. on the screen shots of the trades trade 2 top right should read exit not eneter ....

Update figures GBPJPY 169+108+143+89-108 = +401 GBPCAD -113+89-89-87+100 = - 120 GBPCHF 100+81+77-143+134 = +249

--- 帖子 #3 ---
it looks like an EA can help back test and forward test this system

--- 帖子 #4 ---
This is very similar to the 7am-9am Big Dog USD Breakout Strategy and London ORB threads located here on this forum. I myself use a similar ORB strategy. EA's have already been programmed on those threads. Nicely explained though, Paulus and you have expanded other currency pairs which is very helpful. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Is this the H1 TF?

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Igroks method covers it all since a long time ago. Good luck with the range trading technique.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
yes thought there may be others like this or even this system already here but thought id post any way it seems good and its good to share :-) yes its one hour time frame

--- 帖子 #8 ---
last one GBPTRY +125+146+136+230+139 = +776

--- 帖子 #9 ---
anyone kind enough to post EA for this system since there is already similar EA been made ? Paulus , will this system be good for all available currency pair ? if we diverse our trades to multiple currency pair , the result could be better ? I think it will be rare for all currency pair to hit SL at the same time. we could assign nano or micro lot for each currency pair. what do u think ?

--- 帖子 #10 ---
It is a good clean and simple system. The point is, YOU thought it out, it doesn't matter that similar systems exist. Good job and I hope things have sorted themselves out for you.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
http://www.forexfactory.com/news_archive.php?id=92710 here is another positive review of the system... PC

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Hi Paulus. Interesting System but how many pips is the SL? Thanks tordi.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
gonna test this on demo tomorrow .. thanks for sharing Paulus use Fibo. SL at 0% .. TP at 100% .. If short, SL will be put at Asian High and if long, SL will be put at Asian Low. for example Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #14 ---
MR. Paulus always your post in FF is more than usefull ... i just fallow all your post becase they are really really great. thanx tooooo much

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Thats it ..............risk reward is always 1:1 But Im aiming to use money management If I can use a spread betting company I will do so. using a spread betting company means slightly more spread but the MM should be simpler as the different swaps are different pip $ values so Stop at 100 pips risking 3% of 5k account is £150 I stake £1.50 per pip Loss if it happens is £150 On another trade another swap it may be 75pips stop risking 3% of 5k account is still £150 but I can now stake £2 a pip If a stop comes along of 300 pips still staking my 3% of 5k bank which is £150 I stake £0.50p per pip In all cases the loss is still £150 Forexisfx..... the reason the system uses the GBP spots is that London is the 1st market to open after the Asian session so technicaly heavy trading on any GBP spot should occur. Ive not looked at other spots the most commen being EURUSD Iv not done a complete blow by blow pip count but on eurusd on the last 13 days looking roughly its had 4 losers 2 approx break even and 7 winners cheers Paulus

--- 帖子 #16 ---
No TS? cfp85 trade would have been a bad trade without it, would it not?

--- 帖子 #17 ---
i just put that as a trade example .....i would put at lease 25pips TS or at least change SL to breakeven ..

--- 帖子 #18 ---
I will post this but up to the individual if you use it All I have done is use the Fib Expansion tool to project the 161.8 level below our entry They say in Fib circles the 61.8 and the 161.8 are the most looked at and traded at levels. It may be a good idea if the 161.8 level is hit to close out 50% and bring your stop to break even as its clearly a danger area. Time will tell P

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Hi Paulus. I like what you have shown us here and went to work this evening doing some backtesting. It's manual and not in spreadsheet format so I can't post a shot but have summarised the figures. I tested cable from 25/3 to 24/4. There were two ranging days with no trigger and one closed at b/even at end of day.I agree with your figures for this last week so it would appear I have understood your method. There was a couple of biggish losers (-118 and -100) The tally was 2ranging,1 b/even, 14 winners and 6 losers (23 days on test 21 trades taken) winners = 80.2pips average and losers 74.0 average. giving a total of +679. This included spreads . There were three days when the trade needed closing out manually end of day and one day 24/4 stopped out. What I then did was tried taking profit at 76.4 fib level. This eliminated the manual closing and avoided the stopped out trade. Changed the results to 17 winners and 3 losers 2 ranging and 1 b/even. The winners were worth 41.5 each and the losers 66.6 giving a total of + 505. Perhaps an idea would be to split the stake and take some off at 76.4. Leave the rest to run. This could be preset with an order for those leaving this alone while at work. On days where the Asian session had a wide range this might be enough pips for some anyway. If trading this manually then once the 76.4 is hit the stop on the remaining could safely be moved under the 61.8 based on the test above for 80% of the time. I don't usually split my stake and trade m5 in and out and closed but I think this system may tempt me to try it. Just to give you some feedback on the 161.8 fib idea - there were only two days in this test where it was hit and one of those was budget day. I suppose a small asian range and then big news might move it enough to hit it and other pairs may test differently. I know you said no indis but one ema 150 is all I added and it would have saved a loss on 31 mar of -20 and turned -100 into +20on 7/4 (see red arrows). Do you see any mileage in using two GBP pairs and two Eur pairs to spread the risk abit while trading all four at once? Anyway thats all. Andy edit. I wasn't with you on the fib expansion, thought you were referring to the original fib so ignore that bit.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
what time frame r u using?

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Yeah, his first chart and explanation does not mention the TF and I asked him about it. It is the H1 TF.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
The one who ask about Time frame he may not get the idea of this system ... this system not depand on TF .. its depand only about breacking hi low of each Asian Session.. just draw horz. line on high and low of Asian session and wait breacking either high or low in any time frame.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Sorry Rastaman it is the 1hour your right Paulus

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Andy Thanks for the time you spent on this,I have no in depth stats on this system so any thing like you produced is a great value...taking profits are specific points I think is the way to go..would be nice to lock in some profits on each trade esp as it fires only once a day per swap It seems to be a min time investment strategy with potentially very good gains Cheers Paulus

--- 帖子 #25 ---
you already told him in post# 7

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hello Paulus, congrats for this new thread and My trading style is trend and s/r, very simple, although I test a lot of the other systems that are available hoping to see something. anyway, can you please include your original code so we know that your thread is not a commercial one. thanks.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Hello Paulus,, thank you for your system i am working with 3 broker and your indicator (london forex rush) must be setup for each because of different time zone of brokers. i am looking at time and date of site and i am seeing that tokyo market is still open while because of different of time zone 2 of my charts show that the asia session had been ended.! so i think friends must adjust the indicator with their broker timezone.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
i have this problem too thanks tetis

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Buy and sell orders placed(demo for a couple of days) see how we go. I think the sell at 1.4517 will get hit first. Trying this with 3 lots and will set an order to close 2 at 76.4 and move stop on 1 lot to 61.8 if i'm around otherwise tp at 100% with an order. Sell order just hit. Expecting some pull back here as the asian session was big and we have just had a very large bear candle. tp 76.4=1.4446 tp 100.0=1.4375 sl=1.4677 so s/loss=160, 1st tp=71 x 2 lots so 142, 2nd tp=142 x 1 lot. Leave it alone and wait now then. Andy

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Hey there, are there a time gap between Asia close and London open? I mean like an hour beetwen or so? A bit confusing with times, DSL etc.. Also do we take a trade if the high/low is already broken? thx PC

--- 帖子 #31 ---
ANyone have any idea what this time frame is based on in the inputs. According to the readout London is not open yet, but it is and I am in Tokyo which is also open. Is this GMT it is set to?

--- 帖子 #32 ---
In the forexrush indie, you should adjust the indicator to match the tokyo start and end against your broker offset. e.g. I use Alpari UK as my broker. Alpari UK server time is 1hr ahead of GMT time. In the indicator, I enter "1" for the tokyo start time (Tokyo starts at 00:00 GMT so I need to ad 1 hour to offset alpari) and "9" (Tokyo ends at 08:00 GMT so I need to ad 1 hour to offset alpari) for the end time. You do not need to enter anything for the London open as that is specific to the "London Rush" system. Market hours are here: http://forex.timezoneconverter.com/i...ndon&amp;refresh=5 I recommend that you draw the lines in manually if you did not buy the LONDON FOREX RUSH system as you will be in breach of the copyright. Or instead, use the indicator that I have attached, that was programmed by andee for a similar thread.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Thanks for the advice &amp; the indi. Still can't work out how to set this up as I have no idea about ODL Japans MT4 server time. Can I just count the last 9 bars on the H1 TF and take the high and lows? Or is this much more complicated? Does this look about right?

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Rastaman, This is very simple. Take your MT4 crosshair, hover over the the last bar on a M1 chart. Look at the time axis and note the bars time. This will be your current broker server time to the latest minute. Then offset GMT by the difference. Another example: If your server time shows as 16:14 and current GMT time is 10:14, then your server time is 6 hours ahead. Tokyo time starts at midnight, so you need to enter 06:00, for the start. You could take the last 8 bars provided you took the last 8 bars from Asian close, (which is 8am GMT). You cannot just take any 8-9 bars as this strategy relies on the momentum provided by the London open, therefore you must take the ASIAN range.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
The only point is that as you know London starts at 7 GMT (8 am UK time), so do we leave out the last hour of Tokyo and consider the 7 GMT hourly bar for the start of our breakout? Or do we leave out the first 1 hour bar of London open and consider the 8 GMT (9 am London) as start of the break out from the range?

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Sorry, this is so confusing as I am trying to work out the actual candle time, ODL server time, London time,Japan time and this bloody MT4 time!!! Phew....... The Last bar opened at 10 AM and the the same 10 AM is reported on MT4 at the time it opened. It is currently 7 PM here in Japan. So, now I have to work out what I set the Tokyo Start Tokyo End and London Open numbers to. Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

--- 帖子 #37 ---
I haven't changed anything in the indi and the bars have drawn themselves on nicely. I am using it on broco demo which is gmt +2. In the uk which the trading is based on we are in British Summer Time which is GMT +1. So broco mt4 which is in line with central european time is 1 hr ahead of actual british time. The bars finish at the end of the broco 8am candle. The breakout high low zone is then placed at 9am with the high and low of asian session established. This is 8am in the uk which is widely accepted as the start of the london session. If it helps further, look at your local time on FF and then compare to when I posted this. The uk time is now 11:16. Andy. update -the sell order took me in and currently 45 pips down at the mo. Did expect that though in the pullback. Howard. All the backtest i carried out showed the 7gmt (8bst) candle to be the one to trade on if there is a breakout.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Hey Paulus, It's nice to see you posting and sharing systems again. Thanks for your generosity! Can you please specify what is your understanding of "close of the day"? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #39 ---
What was the sell order pair? I only got LONG order on EUR/GBP

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Yes 7:00 am GMT is the correct starting time

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Hi Rastaman It was cable. low of asian session at 1.4527 on 7.00 bst candle then 8 bst opening candle came down to 1.4517 and took me in. totally going against me at the moment. I found during backtesting that maybe an entry greater than 10 away would have saved a couple of bad entries like this. but who knows there's plenty of time for this to turn round. I placed those entry orders myself and the indi didn't tell me to enter. I haven't concerned myself with that side of it as being in the uk, its easy for me to place my orders manually. Andy

--- 帖子 #42 ---
This is so strange, I work on Alpari UK, BST+1 just like you. The 7AM BST candle signaled my asian low at 1.45211, the next candle's low was at 1.45131, so I never got in. Guess I was lucky this time. There sure is a lot of difference between the brokers!! Good trading to all, Wendy

--- 帖子 #43 ---
will try and answer question later Im following GBPUSD GBPJPY GBPCHF GBPAUD GBPCAD GBPTRY Only those swaps with GBP listed 1st i think should be used Cheers ps.. This is not a commercial venture this is a system that I bought so i could use an indicator off of it. the actual system you buy uses a trend indicator to help you take only the trades with the current trend but i found this knocked you out of some really good moves.. Also i think he states he only looks at the 1st 3 bars after the close of the Asian. So this is different the only thing Im using is his ind to mark hi lo of Asian Paulus

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Right on the nose for EUR/GBP. Didn't exactly play this by the rules though. The LONG order just did not look right, so I wne t short 10 pips after the break.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Think we are just about done. Better not push my luck.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
thanks Limstyls... so i just modify tokyo time with my broker offset .....

--- 帖子 #47 ---
The LFR system puts in about 8-16 trades per month and is profitable. I think the most consecutive losses I had with it were 5, and overall it won approx. 60% of its trades. Its rules allow only 1 pair traded per day; usually the first to trigger and that pair must trigger between the hrs of 8 - 10 am UK local time (BST), and to avoid news. I go to break even at 1:1 and don't take the trade if the LFR indicator displays a take profit less than 1.5:1. If the LFR indcator sets a TP greater than 2:1 I close out at 2:1. The settings I use for the LFR indicators are: stops are "aggressive" and TP's are ""conservative". The GBPTRY is not used in the system; GBPNZD is used instead. The spread on the GBPTRY on my platform is prohibitive and I can't see any practical use in this system for a pair with a 60 pip spread! However, it is getting late and I may have misread that. As with all FOREX methods only lots and lots of hours LIVE TRADING will truly tell you how good it is; at least 100 trades or 3 months of watching if the trades are fewer! So Good luck with this variation of the Asian Break-Out. Gray.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
I've just finished backtesting, manually, this system. Pairs used: EUR/GBP GBP/USD GBP/CHF GBP/AUD GBP/JPY GBP/CAD Did not take into account the spread. Assumed "End of Day" at 00:00 GMT. Don't know if this is what Paulus uses as I didn't get reply to previous post. Backtested from 23/02/09 to 24/04/09 - 60 trading days. Results and basic statistics in attached excel file. Hope this helps to better understand this method. Good luck and pips to all.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Piper, Great job on the backtest. I'm sure that was time consuming. It seems to be impressive but will it be consistent in the FUTURE actual performance? That's always been the key for a good system. All systems go thru a period of down time. I'll be demoing this for a while. It may need adjustments on TP, SL specially during the summer (slower market). Overall, I must say it's a clean system, no care about trend, or other indicators, EMAs, etc. It's a great arsenal to keep in your trading tool box. I use a fib retrace system in a trend with a fairly decent success but my chart looks like somebody's nightmare. This system can't be any easier if it works consistently. Definetely worth a serious live testing for about 6 months to verify its real performance. Good Luck and thanks for taking the time to do the backtest, it really helps put things in prespective.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
http://www.forexfactory.com/nfs/cust...tar96656_1.gif $aly Does, this mean, that you are also residing in Japan? If so, please let me know what settings you are using as, I still am not sure this thing is setup correctly. Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Anyone know what the daily range limit is for this system? Probably around 60 pips, I imagine?

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Great job piper, but which fib level did you use as your tp?

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Piper Great work on the back test From my own results I had already decided to bin GBPCAD as you can see below GBPUSD +125+97+68+118-82 +327 GBPAUD +143+4+116-145+114 +232 GBPJPY 169+108+143+89-108 = +401 GBPCAD -113+89-89-87+100 = - 120 GBPCHF 100+81+77-143+134 = +249 GBPTRY +125+146+136+230+139 = +776 ..very large spread I will follow anyway When going from demo to live there is one ingredient we still need ...luck Not many traders like using this word but the way I see it you need it. A quote from Napoleon " Give me lucky men for my generals, I can teach them everything else" Every system does have draw downs its part of game if you like it will happen .. you may demo this for 12months and then go live only to hit the 4 week draw down.. Unless your un emotional and use money management I guarantee you will bin the system..............its a human reaction Cheers Paulus

GBP/USD has some potential with these double bottoms forming.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
I know, it says NO TRADE but there again, it said NO TRADE for 2 bars after the Asian close on EUR/GBP then LONG, yesterday. The outcome was this. I think this indi needs to be taken with a pinch of salt. Also, if you look at the Murrey Math Lines on the chart above, we are at a major reversal point. I am not saying it will break up, I am simply saying, It COULD.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Rastaman id love to know where you got those levels from on your chart 1/8 2/8 etc, or did you input them manually? Cheers

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Wonder NO More. The Black lines work good on a white background, if you have a black background use the other one.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
The indicator posted by Paulus is for the forex rush system which is known to be useless for anything other than showing the high and low of asian session. If you did not purchase the system then you are in breech of copyright, which is why I posted an indicator by Andee that does the same thing without the NO TRADE bullshit... Use that instead!

--- 帖子 #60 ---
ok 1st candle afetr Uk open at 8am All hi lo lines set... need the break by 10 pips P

--- 帖子 #61 ---
If you want to know about ranges, then look up ATR and ADR. Then I suggest you look at the results for the past 30 days and do an average. This will give you an approximate value of daily range.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
I don't know why you are finding this so difficult... Use the indicator I attached in a previous post.... Set the offset to the difference of your current broker server time and your current local time. Set the start to 8am and the end to 4pm (assuming Tokyo starts at 8am and ends at 4pm). That is it...

--- 帖子 #63 ---
I tried setting it but it was giving conflicting boxes to the other indi, no matter what settings I used. Also, why are you jumping on my back about using this indicator and not the back of others who are also OBVIOUSLY using it?

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Remove the LFR indicator... Use the Andee indicator... Set the settings that I gave earlier. Where is the problem? IF you insist on using the LFR, then you need to ignore the TRADE/NO TRADE signal as that was specific to LFR which is known to be OVERLY cautious and used in conjunction with another useless indicator. The only settings for the LFR that you need are the TOKYO START and FINISH. Just offset your broker time against this.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
I don't know what the problem is as I don't have one. You seem to be the one with the problem here.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Ok, I would love to use the indi you posted, it is a much better indi and looks much cooler. If it will adjust, I will gladly use it and be grateful.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Rather than clogging up this thread, PM me and I will assist you with the correct settings...

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Hi Wvehoven, I did the backtest as per rules stated by Paulus on the first post. I set my fib tool to only show levels 0, 50 and 100. For a short trade I start to draw the fibs from the top of the asian session range. I extend the tool until the 50% retracement line coincides with the low of the range session minus 10 pips. At this point the drawing of the fib levels is complete. Then I use the 50% level as entry, the 100% level as stop loss and 0% level as Tp. Have a look at the picture attached. For a long I draw the fib from the low to top+10 pips (we should add the spread also) of the range of the asian session. Entry, SL and TP are the same levels as stated above. Hope this makes it clear.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Can someone attach Fibo Levels indicator please? This is indicator based on one posted in first post, but cleaned up, no messages on chart and no needed EA settings removed.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
And as I expected we have almost a mirror image of the move yesterday. Those double bottoms were a giveaway. Don't believe the indicator just watch it.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
The fibo levels are in the MT4 platform toolbar already.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
" Do you even know what ADR or ATR is"? I didn't see the condescending title of that post till now. After reading it, you can stick your indi up your officious Ass. You have been bugging me through this thread and I have had enough.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Off course...stupid me...sorry. Rastaman here u can see market hours in different timezones, choose your broker GMT offset click on GO and u will know when Tokyo opens for your broker.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
I know when Tokyo opens, I live here. What I am not sure of is the settings in the program, I put in 9 shift and it is not right, I am not sure what time I am supposed to enter for the Tokyo open and close as my broker is on British time, am I supposed to put the Tokyo open in in British time? I am doing this the reverse of you guys. SOLVED THANKS TO LOU G Lou G in this thread posted a much better indicator and a template for the Asian session. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...&amp;highlight=box Easy to configure and has an alert. And last but not least, it does not have his name written on your screen, unlike the self opinionated person in this thread trying to force his frigging indicator down your throat. Give me a break!

--- 帖子 #75 ---
If anyone wants my template and indicators for this system, here they are. The clock is customizable and the MM math lines are handy to spot a reversal. My template is the London Rush. Hope this helps someone.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Yes... Quite... For the many numerous PM's that I have had with regards to this, and to save me copy and pasting numerous times, here is the time offsetting again, regardless of whether or not you use my (sic) officious Ass indicator that was posted earlier or the LFR indicator posted by Paulus: First, get the difference between your MT4 server time and your current local time. I use Alpari UK who are 1 hour ahead of London time (London is GMT+0 time). Tokyo starts at Midnight London (GMT) time and ends at 8am GMT time In my case I offset GMT by 1, so in the LFR indicator I put in 01:00 as the start and 09:00 as the end. If I use the Ant-GU indicator (coded by ANDEE, and not by me...) then I put 1 in the GMT shift and set the start as 00:00 and end as 08:00. In Rastaman's case, all he needs to put in the LFR indicator is 8 as the start and 4 as the end. If he uses the Ant-GU indicator, he uses 9 as the GMT offset and 00:00 as the start and 08:00 as the end. (This is assuming that his MT4 time and current local time are already in sync) Rastaman, if you post questions, expect an answer...

--- 帖子 #77 ---
I don't understand how the moderators of FF allow this kind of language and atitude!!!!! You should be banned!

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Well, if this guy had not been constantly on MY back about this indicator that other people are using and was posted in this thread for all to use, the problem would not have occurred, now would it. Who does this guy think he is and why was he constantly on my back about this? That is the question now, isn't it. So, your opinion counts for nothing!

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Rastaman, This will be my last post addressed to you as I do not wish to disrespect Paulus anymore by wasting time on this. My posts were not directed as an attack at you, rather to help you and others, so this speaks to your character. If you decide to post and ask a question, then accept a civil answer. If you decide to flame instead of accept and use the answer, then at least have your facts straight (It is not MY indicator that I posted, but rather a respected coder on various forums, and probably the best indicator for this type of strategy that I have come across, and I have many of them). Regardless, do yourself a favour by accepting help, rather than attempting to denegrate those who wish to help...

--- 帖子 #80 ---
I found my "old" forgotten Tokyo indicator among all indicators in folder...it simple and nice. If u like it, download it below. http://i39.tinypic.com/2ahxeds.jpg

Thanks I like the look of it .. its a cool piece of kit.. draw down guys put yer tin hats on .. onwards and upwards..hmmm P

--- 帖子 #82 ---
This is a great little system to have in our box of tools for early evening trading (In my case). Thanks again Paulus for bringing it to our attention. I shall not be posting any more about that person as he is in my ignore list. Back to work. Don't you just love those pin bars and hammers.

Paulus, I know your system doesn't care about trend since you didn't want to ignore some anti-trend moves as setup per your system. But, would it not be safer, more conservative to verify the long term trend (daily, weekly) and continue with those moves only? The reason is if we have a long term trend, the anti-trend moves are probably just retracements (big or small) and may not last long and are riskier than trend moves? Thanks again for sharing this system

i've got a simple question for you all. it's about gmt. i live in italy, now the time is about 01.27 am, it's night here. in italy we are gmt +1, so i set gmt +1 in my preferences here on forexfactory. i can see the startig hour of each market from the home page of FF. my question is: can we solve this problem of gmt and tokyo session using the following infomation? :

--- 帖子 #85 ---
i can see that tokyo session will start in about half hour. isn't it enough for me, for and for you all also?

--- 帖子 #86 ---
matte, This will give you start and end information, yes. The session indicators are just there to make your life easier, but you could draw the lines in manually without too much difficulty (unless time confuses you).

London Time is GMT+1, during Summer Time. Which I believe started around March 1 in the UK.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
British Summer Time this year is from Sunday 29th March to Sunday 1st October Andy

Due to time restrictions here I will be updating profit loss only once a week cheers paulus

so in about two hour we'll have the definitive low and high of the asian session and we will be able to start trading this strategy, it's ok?

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Less than a 20 pip range on EUR/GBP right now. If it stays like that till the end of the Tokyo session we may be in for a big dipper later.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
rastaman what about my post in the bottom of previous page?

--- 帖子 #93 ---
London is always GMT+0 (Greenwich is in London). You are referring to BST(DST) which GMT switches to and from twice a year. As GMT switches to BST, London is still GMT+0, although you are correct, it has moved an hour forward. Perhaps it is better to use UTC?

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Tokyo is closed... you should be looking for potential entries on your pair...

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Sorry about that, missed your post. It is currently 5:15 PM here in Japan so you have another 45 mins to wait before the Tokyo session closes. It is also a national holiday here today so even if the stock exchange is open things will be slow.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
i took this screenshot right now, why do you say tokyo is closed?

--- 帖子 #97 ---
I was looking at the sydney calendar on FF... (I don't use this strategy, I look at London Opening range so don't have Asian session drawn in.) Looking at the FF calendar Tokyo closes in about 40 mins. Sorry for the mistake...

Go to post 75 and download the ZIP file I put up there. In the zip is an indicator called P4Clock, you can configure it to show more time zones but it currently shows, Tokyo, New York, AUS, London etc and shows you when they are open and when they are closed along with the time in that city. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=165513&amp;page=5 In fact you can use the Template as well as it has the cool indicator in it to show the London open.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I hate to argue about it with someone who lives in the UK, but you are mistaken. (At least your profile indicates you live there) GMT never shifts. Local times shift back and forth an hour for Summer and Winter time. GMT remains stationary. During BST, London is GMT +1. Try this. When you read this, check your local time. Then click this link. It is a world clock that gives current GMT. You will find your time an hour later than GMT. http://www.mirage-avm.com/mu/GMTtime.htm Here is another site that shows a British clock and GMT on the same page, for comparison. You will find BST to be one hour later than GMT. http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Hi billbss, Having passed through Greenwich today, I passed by the observatory to pick up some leaflets. Yes, it appears that what I was taught at school is wrong. Although we Brits created this method of time keeping, our point of origin does not dictate that we are GMT+0 (except in Winter) as I and I'm sure many others in England were taught in primary school. Regardless of this fact, the conclusion is the same, in summertime we are an hour forward and in winter time we are in line with GMT. Having read through these leaflets from the observatory, it definitely would be better to use UTC as the standard as this would create less confusion all round. Thanks for pointing me to the sites. I will ensure I do not make the same mistake again.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
I didn't know this until I started nosing around finding those links I posted- UTC and GMT are the same thing. They report the same time at all times of the year. There may be a nanosecond difference because UTC is an atomic clock and GMT is a mechanical clock. But if it's 0:00 GMT, it is also 0:00 UTC.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Thanks Paulus...your previous backtest seems to show that GBPJPY delivers the highest pips so i guess i will stick with only that pair in order to maximise my profit. Thanks for sharing mate! Love ya.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
i need an help. i'm in italy. here, now, is 00:10 i've got an open trade wich didn't reached neither TP nor SL. i must close it at the end of the day. the end of the day (note that i'm in italy and here is 00:10) is few minute ago? is this right? i must close them at midnight, italian hour, ok?

--- 帖子 #111 ---
compare your time with mine, when i say "now here is 00:10". if Paulus lives in UK and says "close at the end of the day" does he means -at the midnight in UK- or -at the midnight of whatever country do you live in-?

--- 帖子 #112 ---
so..i've just closed the trade, and i think i was about 15 minute in late on the Paulus rules. please someone reply me.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Matte I understand Paulus' rules that the end of the day is 23:59 in the uk. Therefore that would be 00:59 in Italy as you are 1 hour ahead of us. The rules are based on trading times in the uk as you are trading the london session opening. On the plus side you can have an extra hour in bed than us in the uk before placing your orders. Hope this helps Andy

hi friend.. thx for the EA.. but i can't use it...! i try to drag in to graph and also right click and than attac to graph but nothing appear (the sittings window).. ???

I wouldn't use an EA with this system..! Just too volatile around Rush Hour.

Put the indicators in your indicators folder, not the root of the experts folder. These are indicators, not EA's.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Hi I dont understand firstly your meaning of hi low of Assian Session and if I dont access to that indication what is alternative? and second your meaning of EA and %$! please describe this kind of words for beginners such as me. Thank you

--- 帖子 #119 ---
hi can anyone say which range gives the best result????

--- 帖子 #120 ---
I asked the same question and got a stupid response from someone in this thread. After, scanning these pairs it appears that 80-100 daily Asian session range seems to move the most.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
take it easy man ..you are a great trader in FF

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Attached Image I think you must have me confused with someone else! A lot of ranging going on right now, so I am experimenting with the De mark indicator to find the break inside the Asian daily. Actually it is quite a good indi to use with this system and gives you a rough idea estimate of TP. This is GPP/CHF where I am looking to find the break of ranging. Earlier I managed to take 50 pips out og GBP/USD.....I love this system.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
GBP/USD Not far off the DeMark indicator target. This may be a good combination for the London Rush.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
I trade this a little different . I trade off the 1st 4bar of the day . (1hr) And I Have a neat indicator to tell me when to go long and short look at upper right hand. It tells you the time frame and price when the signal form. and keep count how many bars ago on each time frame check it out

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Interesting, I take it that you trade on the M15 TF? Just wondering if those M15 candles would make me more nervous than H1. LoL Would you elaborate as to how you trade this? Looks like you can catch the retracement more easily though.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
it seems the best TP for this system when price break the box and offset is the nearest pivot point... any idea????

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Hi everybody! Thanks Paulus for this great and simple system. I prefer trading manually, but an EA would be good for helping placing trades and doing the work on days when I cannot be in front of the screen at Asian close. Has anyone had any luck with coding an EA?

--- 帖子 #128 ---
can anyone make a gui with the best indicator and how to use it?

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Hi. I had purchased Forex Rush before so am relatively familiar with what it does etc. With this system, I can see its getting some great reviews I am sure i am being really dumb here...I can see the entry and exit levels per your first post on this thread. What are the TP/SL Levels or should I say, how are these set? Regards

--- 帖子 #130 ---
ok i've set this for what i think is the best solution, and with alpari uk i set from 19:00 to 2 am i think that this is the best.. i can see big candles after and before those.. can anyone made an EA who take automatic trade?

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Hi Rastaman, I really like your chart! Nice job! In looking at it... what hours do you use for the Asian Session? It looks like from 00:00 to 08:00? If so... then what do you put for the London session? 08:00 thru 15:00? Or 09:00 thru 15:00? Or what? For those interested.... I have included an image showing the 3 market hours and how they overlap. http://www.fsbof.com/images/FX-3market1.gif Thanks in advance! Tony

--- 帖子 #132 ---
This may well work, but this isn't the same strategy that Paulus has outlined on his first post. The main reason being is that this would incorporate the US session which is still active and does not fully encompass the Asian session. This deviation is far enough removed to warrant a new thread, if you chose to follow this route. For those of you looking for an EA, do a search in FF for big dog 7am -9am. There have been several EA's made that are customisable. Also look at Ronald Raygun's posts on his generic breakout EA. In my experience, they do not trade as well as pure price action does with this, but please give them a shot to satisfy your curiosity.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
The chart does not account for DST. The London session begins at 0700 GMT. That is 0800 Lindon time, during the Summer.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Does the chart not show London (European session) at 0700? Or am I not looking at it correctly?

--- 帖子 #135 ---
London session and European session aren't the same thing. Central Europe (France, Germany..etc) begins trading an hour before London. During Summer Time: European Session begins at 0600 GMT London Session begins at 0700 GMT.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Oh... nice to know! Thanks Billbss. So a correct chart to include DST would show the European session starting at 0600 GMT? Did DST start last March? Or whenever we set our clocks forward in March?

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Yes. All the times shown on your chart should be an hour earlier, during DST. DST starts at different dates in the US and Europe. In the US, it begins in early March. In Europe and the UK, it begins in late March. I'm not sure about Asia.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
The only settings for the indicator I am using are as in this photo I posted all the indicators and template in a zip in post 75 of this thread. That one does not have the De Mark indicator in it. Don't really need it, it just gives me a lazy approximate TP. Let me know if you want the zip and template with the demark indicator and trend line in it and I will post it.

i've found this doucument on the web, i'll translate for you. All the jet leg are in relationship between Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). The first meridian wich passes through Greenwich observatory in London is their reference. For this cause the term "greenwich mean time" (GMT) is already used as "base time". GMT il so the ufficial term to measure the time on every trading platform. GMT (UTC) è the local time in Greenwich only between 01.00 UTC of the last sunday of october ane the 01.00 UTC of the last summer of March. In the rest of the yesr the local time is UTC+1 (legal hour).

Rastaman, IN TOKYO, the forex when opens and when closes? tokyo time i mean.. 8 am - 15 pm?

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Guys, Sorry to sound rude but its only time. When you travel to another country, how do you ever manage. Do you turn up to your dinner reservation 3 hours late? Use the ff clock, ie the time on this post. I am posting this at 12:15 in england. Forget about bst for now, it wont matter until october when it changes. Just see what the time is now wherever you are and workout the difference from 12:15 dinner time. It wont change for the next 5 months. Andy

--- 帖子 #149 ---
ok andy, i'm trying to understand..now in italy is 13.25. if tokyo is GMT+9 ,and open at 8am tokyo hour, that means that in italy will be 8 am - 8 hour. in england will be 8 am - 9 hours. it's ok?

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Hi Matte I wouldn't get too hung up on when it starts. Its all a bit vague to me but just be clear that you are one hour ahead of the uk in italy until october. The lines or box for the asian session need to cover whatever period relates to your broker time on the screen. 09:00 Italian time is the official start of London session. This is the candle that you use to tell you when to place your buy/sell orders. It starts to move before that sometimes due to people getting in early to the offices. So the chart you are looking at---- you will use the close of the candle that closed at 08:59 italian time to end the session. Then work back 8 or 9 hours to get the start. You decide and backtest to see what gives the best results as they also may decide to start early in tokyo. It is definitely slower to kick off than the london start though. Once you have grasped the above you can then adjust the indicator properties and start times to suit yourself and your charts/broker time difference. Hope this helps Andy

--- 帖子 #151 ---
really helpful Andy. so, london session starts at 8 am london time, 9 am italian time. tokyo session ends 1 hour after london session open (as we can see in the picture quoted some posts ago). do you agree with me?

--- 帖子 #152 ---
the post is #138... tokyo session overlaps london session for 1 hour.. it's ok?

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Thanks Matte. The chart you refer to is gmt. Remember we are now gmt plus 1 and you are gmt plus 2. I don't even know if tokyo move their clocks like we do. Don't be searching in vain for an official close time. All you need to know is when london opens at 09.00 italian time tokyo might as well have shut. London is now in charge and 08.59 IT was the end of tokyo. Andy

--- 帖子 #154 ---
ok, understood what you say. just one thing it's almost unclear. the FF clock that i've posted several times shows me that tokyo session closes at 11 italian time. why? you are telling me that tokyo close at 8.59 italian time!

--- 帖子 #155 ---
I was referring to the clock at the header bar near to your name and the search tab, not the markets open session clock thingy. Make sure you have changed the clock to read your local time. Hope that's clear. I'm off for the weekend now on my sons' rugby tour so won't be here till tuesday. Have a nice weekend. Andy ps. Matte. There are plenty of different views on when sessions start and finish and ff may show that finish. BUT...... the ONLY thing this system relys on is where the Asian session is when london starts. It's not called the london rush for nothing. That is the level from you to work from. Don't get hung up in the detail. Keep it simple.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
we will end this next week. thank you, happy weekend!

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Just add this indicator to, MT4/experts/indicators The set it up to show all the markets you want to see, it will show you which market is open and the current time of that market.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
done, thank you. FF show london close in 30 minutes. let's see if the indicator you posted do the same thing.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
ok few changes mid way through the week Im only following 3 now GBPUSD GBPJPY there the 2 main big boys on this system Im also adding EURJPY .. its an Asian based swap and the Euro is heavily traded by all Monday to Friday results on the 3 Im taking 50% off at 75% as per the back test that was carried out... bring the rest to break even..... at 100% close the last 50% ..or close at end of day if TP or SL not hit GBPUSD -37-6+41-32+85 = +51 GBPJPY NT +0+68-10+112 = +170 EURJPY +90+67+58-16 = +199 and long from 131.97.. 75% is at 132.51 I like these 3 and I like the indicator posted in the thread called Tokyo,iv coloured mine blue looks crisp and its great to lay on other charts if you dont want to trade the Asian session

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Rastaman, i had had an idea! if you think at sunday evening, when the forex week starts, you'll see that if here, in italy, the platform receives the first quotes at 23.00, that means that the asia session starts at 23 here in italy! and that is for the entire week. as the first quote comes at 23 of sunday, the asian session starts at 23 italian time. don't you agree?

--- 帖子 #161 ---
No. Tokyo opens at 23:00 GMT. In Italy you are GMT +2. What does that mean? What time is 2300GMT in Italian time? It's 1:00 AM.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
usually it's just 1 hour. london 22, milan 23. now whe are in summer time son there are 2 hours. ANYWAY, listen, i'm talking about facts, not theories. if i sunday see the market opening at 23 italian hour, that will means that the asia session has started. isn't it? i see quotes--&gt;asia has started

--- 帖子 #163 ---
No, it does not mean that. It only means that trading is being done with your broker. Australia and parts of Asia may trade before Tokyo opens. I've told you when Tokyo opens. It opens at 0800 Tokyo time. That is 2300 GMT. That is 1 AM Italian time.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Tokyo Open Time 9:00 AM is 2:00 AM in Rome. Right now it is 11:59 AM on Sat May 2 so in Rome it is 4:59 AM Sat May 02. Based on the fact that Rome is 7 hours behind Japan, Tokyo will open for you on Monday May 4th 2:00 AM. London open will be at at 7 am in Italy. So, watch the P4 clock and if London opens at exactly 7 AM Italian time, you are set to go.

Paulus What do you have against EUR/GBP? The spread is 3 pips and it looks pretty consistent to me. GBP/JPY is 6 pips spread which is ok if you catch the trend but possibly a killer if your SL gets hit.

Paulus, Thanks for sharing this system. I am having problems implementing fibs as per your instructions. Trying as best I can, on your long trade example, I cannot make it work to stretch the fib tool to place 0.00 on the low and move the tool to get 50% on the high.

May 4th, 5th &amp; 6th are Japanese national holidays, it appears the market is open but trading will be slower than usual and to make things worse, the UK also has a national holiday on the 5th. How this will affect this system, is unclear, perhaps the Asian session will not be a good gauge for the London open, or maybe the London session will not open at all.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
i dont trade on bank holidays, especially UK, USA any JPY.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
i have an opposite idea Rastaman ,,, i think those holidays cause making a low range box because of less moving and this is enough to make a good trade

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Interesting system. For those of you using this system, do you start looking for breakouts: --When the London Market Opens? OR --When the Tokyo Market Closes? If I'm not mistaken, London opens, then an hour later, Tokyo closes, so there is a 1 hour period when both markets are open. So what exact time do you start looking for the breakout? If you were to use the Asian Hi/Lo as breakout points, then it would mean you can only start looking for breakouts 1 hour into the London session, but not at the beginning.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
It seems to me that it doesn't matter actually if any imaginary market opens or closes at any exact time. The system discussed here is a nice sample of a volatility breakout system, and it works since there are frequent volatility expansions at interleaving times between sessions. As soon as it's based on volatility, the best potential results are cut to almost nothing by exit rules used. In other words, the narrower the pre-London range, the greater the potential move after a breakout, and vice versa. Look at charts posted here and you'll see — when the "asian" period has too wide a range, usually it leads to a stop eventually and when it's narrow a potential nice profit is cut by the limit order. The bottom line is — this system can be greatly improved if volatility is taken into account, for example, by means of well-known ATR or similar.

Tokyo Stock Exchange is open over the following hours. TSE http://www.tse.or.jp/english/index.html What I don't get are the national holidays that they are according to this, NOT open. Like today, but they seem to be open. The plot thickens, as they say.

This is what you should do. http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/personal.html It is already setup for your time so compare this to the P4clock on your chart. When that site says 6:00 PM Tokyo has closed. Just about to lock these 3 in at just above BE

Hi Paulus, Thanks for sharing this system and for sharing this pic. I will compare these charts to my own charts so I know for sure that I have the correct settings. By the way... I used the LondonForexRush template (provided by someone earlier in this thread) which does give the "Trade" or "No Trade" info on the chart. This makes me believe that this is not legal for me to be using it since I did not purchase it. It doesn't really matter because of the 4 charts I was watching this morning, 3 were wrong in the direction of the trades. They all said "Long" when the movement went short. So I missed out on three profitable trades. So I am going to scrap those charts and follow the system you have been using. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Paulus, I just about mirrored your results as well. Ive done some manual backtesting and this method works rather well. 30M looks to work too, thanks again.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Hi Rastaman, Can you please attach the De Mark indicator? I think it sounds like a great tool. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Here you go. I just use it to give me a rough tp or confirm that the predicted fibo tp is good.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Thanks!

On post 45 there is an indicator on the chart that shows little dots showing S/R. I was wondering if anyone knows what that is and where I can get it. I think it will be a great help of the other system I trade. thanks in advance for your help. Simple

In the p4 clock indicator, I just changed the WWW of the time calculation from this: http://www.worldtimezone.net/index24.php To this: http://www.worldtimezone.com/time/wtzstandard.php? Hopefully this will sort out the problem of the Tokyo session being open when it is actually not open yet.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
You can do the same thing with your built-in Windows clock. Double click the time in the bottom right hand corner of your screen. Under the Time Zone tab, select any city in the world. Hit OK. Then your computer will show the time in the bottom right hand corner. Then change it back. It only takes a few seconds.

How can that be easy when all you have to do with the P4 clock is put it on chart, setup which Markets you want to watch and the colors, this takes 30 seconds, save the template then load it for every pair you choose? There are no local timezones to set up on this clock, it is all done automatically. The only problem was that it was reporting the time in each country correctly but the market open time was not correct. It was reporting Tokyo as being open at 8 am when it opens at 9 am.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Hi I will like to ask about this asian timing which I hope you can help me with. May I ask what's the asian hours in terms of EST? is it from 7am to 4pm? thanks

--- 帖子 #201 ---
GBP/USD looks to be in a tight position stuck between Extreme Overshoot and a Major Reversal. Which shall prevail? EST does not matter, the Tokyo session is 9 am to 5 pm Japan time. Just use the P4 clock and it will show you the correct time for Japan. Everyone is confusing their local time with this system, local time means nothing to this system. The only two timezones that mean anything are Japanese time from 9 am-5pm and British time from 8 am to 3 pm. Or thereabouts. If anyone else is STILL confused just use the bloody P4 clock and when Tokyo says 9 am draw a vertical line on your chart, when London says 8 am draw another vertical line on the chart. Waaaaahhhhhhhhhhh $%@$@%$@%$#%$@%$#%$@ Here it is AGAIN!

--- 帖子 #202 ---
i suggesting anybody to keep opening orders till price touch the nearest pivot .

--- 帖子 #203 ---
haha well the problem is many ppl are using different timing in some of the other posts (the EST and EDT difference is still sth confusing to me). Also my platform timing is also different from my current timing, making it worse. anyway thanks alot for your help. Will ask u if i got questions abt this strategy! ha

--- 帖子 #204 ---
OK sorry i have a question, how do you load the clock! sorry i m quite new in forex

No trigger on EURJPY... YET ! GBPUSD +42 pips GBPJPY +110 pips I find im happier using the 61.8 fib level for my TP

--- 帖子 #206 ---
hi paulus, hmm u extended ur trading to eur pairs also?

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Hi yes for the reasons given in post 159 http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=159 P

--- 帖子 #208 ---
icic. missed that post. thanks alot. anyway anyone using MT4? I have difficulty pulling the fib up to the desired level. think someone sounded it out previously but think nobody reply him?

--- 帖子 #209 ---
re fib what you having trouble with ? P

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Im now short EURJPY from 131.63 tp of 61.8 is 131.09 Paulus

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Does anyone know how to change a .ex4 file to a mt4 file so I can use it on IBFX? I can't download the file through metatrader. Thanks, Simple

--- 帖子 #212 ---
mine is in italian but i think mt4 is the same all over the world. press crtl + O and set this option on zero. every attraction between an object and the price will be avoided, so you should be able to draw whatever you want whereever you like.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Close down Mt4, drop the P4 clock indicator in MT4/Experts/indicators folder, open Mt4. open a chart. On tool bar go to VIEW, NAVIGATOR, then double click the P4 clock indicator, make sure you have :allow DLL imports: clicked, setup the markets you want to view or do not want to view and the color schemes for your chart. Once this is done and save the template, then just load that template for every pair you want the clock on.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
hmm basically my problem is that the chart can only move sideways but not up and down. so when the fib is too long, i can extend it to where I want it to be.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
thanks alot. another doubt if you dun mind, because I trying to get the exact timing but it seems like you and paulus seem to be using a slightly different time period? cos I was looking at both areas you all highlight and comparing with mine, seems like you two have + - 1 hr difference for the time period you all select

--- 帖子 #216 ---
wow congrats on ur hit. but actually I do have a question cos i was looking at the chart also. The high for then seems to be at 132.69, 10 pips higher means 132.79, which could be hit by the subsequent candle and probably activate a long instead. Anything to prevent that? I personally will probably not use 10 pips but maybe 12 pips ..

--- 帖子 #217 ---
It is 10:35 am here in Japan, the market opens here at 9 am we are on the second Hourly bar inside the Asian session and there is 25 mins left on the last bar.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Hhmm, you are correct. Paulus May 5th and my May 5th chart GBP/USD Asian open time bars are off.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
ex4 is the compiled code. You would need to decompile it. I suggest contacting the author before decompiling as this might be considered copyright theft. If you are just having problems displaying the indicator, put it into your indicators folder and restart metatrader. Metatrader cannot load compiled indicators on-the-fly, so restarting once the indicator is in the correct folder resolves this issue.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
GBP/USD Just before 11:00 am Japan time May 6th. 2 bars on the chart 3rd about to open.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
lol u actually put there for me to see. i m from singapore so it's 1 hr before your time. ok guess i got the timing already. thanks. anw can mt4 put oco ah? is so, how ah?

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Actually, yes and no as you spotted the discrepancy in the charts. I posted this to try to clarify which chart is correct with Paulus as we are two bars off.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
oh. actually it boils down to, so is the exact correct asian market opening and closing? if you can cfm ur timing then I can check which of you is correct

--- 帖子 #224 ---
The open is as on the chart I just uploaded. 9 am JST.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
hmmm but i think i know where is e discrepancy. his initial post put asian opening.. asian refers to AU probably? maybe that's why it start so early?

--- 帖子 #226 ---
The start bars should be exactly the same no matter where on the planet you are as this is the Tokyo session. Of course the time will be different but the bars must be the same.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
erm but urs is different from him. so maybe his asian opening is follow AU instead of Tokyo?

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Now, we are throwing the proverbial spanner in the works. My impression is this, the Asian open, opens with the same bar anywhere on the planet. The bar itself cannot be different. If it is different than the open at 9 am Tokyo time, then it is not the Asian open. Now, Paulus may have it right,I may be wrong or we may both be wrong. But, the fact that I switched my computer on at just before 11 am Tokyo time and see 2 bars on the chart with the third one opening seconds later, leads me to think my chart is correct. OK here is my live account chart. This is a Java chart and today's and yersterday's open look exactly the same.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Ive always had this problem in my trading synchronizing charts it can be a head ache Im leaving mine for now,I mainly went with the London Forex Rush indicators with the MIG meta trader plateform which he recomends as its on the correct server settings.I have then adjusted the indicators as per the manual and thats how I got the settings I will have a play and get back to you on this The EURJPY signal closed with a loss of some 5 pips although it broke down nicely in the Asian session to hit the old target..but hey ho no good for us. Paulus

--- 帖子 #230 ---
thankyou Rastaman, finally i'm sure, really really sure! tokyo opens at 2 am italian time. does it close in about 30 minutes till now?

--- 帖子 #231 ---
anyone have EA to trade this strategy ?

--- 帖子 #232 ---
GBP/USD was a good runner. I was a bit cautious with that Major Reversal where it is.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Just watch the charts, the breakout is easy to see.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
hmm shucks pound yen dropping like nobody biz, lucky I buy a bit on e way up

--- 帖子 #235 ---
did i trade wrongly or isit not a gd day to trade? the news caused a spike which probably activate ur orders but end up moving back.. but of cos can wait n see.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
but the candle you have traded was the last of the tokyo session, isn't it? tokyo was still open. tokyo closes when that spyke closes, right?

--- 帖子 #237 ---
no, tokyo market closes at 5pm tokyo time, but u put ur vertical line till 4pm cos 5pm not counted. so spike was after that

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Yes, Tokyo was still open but it was too good an opportunity to miss and the signs were right.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
No matte Tokyo open 11 pm (GMT), then in Italy it is 1 am (summer time)

--- 帖子 #240 ---
You are Mistaken...! Tokyo opens at 2 am Italian time!! Will people stop posting rubbish about time zones when they haven't got a clue. The current time in Tokyo, Japan is 7:39 PM on Wednesday, May 6, 2009. Milan, Italy is 7 hours behind Tokyo, Japan. The time in Milan, Italy is 12:39 PM on Wednesday, May 6, 2009. Hey, don't believe me, check out the link. http://www.convertunits.com/time/fro...o/Milan,+Italy

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Yes sir, exacly. here now is 13.04, in tokyo ia 20.04, i confirm. ok for the trade Rastaman, nothing wrong with it, just try to understand clearly the method. it was inside tokyo time, but it was a good set up so yoyu took it, ok.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Today does not look like a good day to trade this system with only 3 hours left of the London session. I am calling it quits.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
And what is this? http://forex.timezoneconverter.com/i...=GMT&amp;refresh=5 Tokyo seem open at 23 GMT

--- 帖子 #244 ---
i don't know dear pierre, but i now that Rastaman lives in Tokyo, and if he say "here in tokyo we are going to start...........RIGHT NOW!" i believe him and i take this as pure gold. i'm doing like this, tokyo session, here in italy, starts at 2 am and ends at 11 am o'clock. i can't help you anymore, this is everything i know and do.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
ok , then london overlap 2h

--- 帖子 #246 ---
yes, it should be. but it's better wait the reply from Rastaman

--- 帖子 #247 ---
yes today is a bloody shit day, stupid pound spike cause stupid signals anyway just now pound yen 1 hr got divergence but yet i traded the wrong way :S

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Hi! everyone instead of us to take trades and discuss those trades; why they fail or succeed, and why we should remain or bail out. You guys from almost the 4th page of this thread have turned it to time zones discussion. If you dont know how to convert time, go and take your elementary goegraphy book and go thru it LOL, and let us discuss trades afterall if we practice it we would all be taking the same trades only with slight differences and by the time we compare charts we would eventually be on the same plane. As Rastaman just said today is somehow not cute, I qiut too since mid day kos

--- 帖子 #249 ---
A way round this may be by adding another fib number we have 61.8 at a TP the other golden number is 0.38 We could go break even at this and then TP at 6.18 P

--- 帖子 #250 ---
well i put a 50+ pip TP for pound usd which hit... actually as i say again, the news at 430 caused the stupid spike. but I think depend on urself, if you are ok with lower TP then it might be good. however the problem is if u lower ur TP u must lower your SL also?

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Today GbpChf has good entry.. its go to my direction but then hits BE.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
hmm ur LONG order was activated? or was it short? looks like a 20pips to the max at most?

--- 帖子 #253 ---
forgot about the news Can any one give me any advice on what news is important and where its listed I know there is stuff on the home page of FF but it seems like news is out every 5 mins P

--- 帖子 #254 ---
On the FF Forex Calender, the news coded red is supposed to have the most impact.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Golden number gets hit P

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Look at this plse..comments on a post card Instead of trying to catch the break ..wait for the break and then enter on a rally or pull back to the golden number Look at the chart starting from the left needs to be 30min ..we get more bars :-) Price broke out of the Tokyo high didnt hit 61.8 - no trade Price broke out of the Tokyo high price hit 61.8 go long follow the rest ..the trades are in yellow for the long the stop is0.00 the tp is 1.68 so if the low is broken look short..high is broken look long P

--- 帖子 #258 ---
I know this is in some respect disregarding this system but, if we drop down to the M15 tf and fib the Tokyo high and the Keep moving the London low down, we get a reasonable clear 38.2 break and the retracement at 61.8. This is totally disregarding the breakout box and trading inside it but hey, if it works. Thing is, after the London open, the market is trending on the M15 and we are missing out on this by closing our minds to any trade inside the box. Let's hear peoples opinions on this.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
EA cannot trade this strategy ?

--- 帖子 #260 ---
My opinion is that you need to start another thread. You're proposing a system that has little or no relationship to the subject.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Okidoki, I am out of here.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
The system seems to have evolved into a different system as new entries and take profit instructions are constantly introduced, there's also a time issue, sounds like alot of people can't match up with their broker and Tokyo start, etc. The original system doesn't seem to be consistent enough to work hence we keep tweeking it as the market changes. I think maybe we should have been following the original instrcutions for about a month, just to get some real performance. I applied it to 9 different pairs, and it did well last week, but no so much this week. So, it may be like every other system, works sometimes and doesn't work most of the time. my opinion, good luck

--- 帖子 #263 ---
If you come to the beginning of the thread, you'll see a note that the original system assumes trades along the trend only, and this note has now been completely disregarded. If you now have a look at daily charts with MACD you'll understand where we are now and where we were last week, so it's no wonder we see some losses ahead. Remember also, it's a volatility breakout system, so both using targets equal to the "start-of-the-day box" or trading "boxes" with too large an amplitude makes totally no sense. Look at these points a bit more carefully.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
In the original system you buy he has 2 other criteria A trend direction indicator so you trade only in the trend direction And a visual interpretation on the atcual high low set up in the Asian session...ie he looks for small ranges a large spike one way or another increases the box size and in this circumstance he doesnt trade. I dont mind the system evolving ...the break out and pull back version Im looking at still uses the Asian box and the break out with an entry on a rally or a pull back just hopefully gets me into the trade in the daily trend direction,which is what he was trying to do with his trend indicator. Also this way of trading is mechanicaly once 8am is over and a break has occured up or down a lmt buy or sell can be placed and you can leave the PC...this could easily be managed by an EA We use 1.68 as a TP and 0.00 as a SL which means our SL will always be smaller than our potential TP giving us a risk rewrad ratio in our favour In the example Ive shown the TP is 101 pips the SL is 63 pips giving a RR of 1.6 not bad agreed also on the example the initial break out does hit its TP BUT the new entry may well eliminate false break outs as it enters later and the entry for exampkle in the case of a long is always below the daily High so we have some room for up ward movement cheers Paulus

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Forgive me if my maths are incorrect but surely if SL is 1.68 and TP is 100 then potential profit will always be less than the potential loss. I have manually backtested this method , not to far back, and for what its worth and it nearly always gets to the 1.618 level. I like the idea and will go further back. Steve

--- 帖子 #266 ---
I also use a trailing stop based on the DMI. In a falling price, lower highs the DMI is a good way of determining wher to put the SL. It has worked well in the past. If you use the 15m chart it may help reduce the potential losses.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Paulus, I see what you mean, instead of trading the breakout, we're waiting for the retrace to 61.8% of the asian session of the move. However, a move may go beyond 1.68 then pull back to 100% instead, perhaps we should trade the retrace of the breakout which may not pull back to 61.8 of the asisan session. just a thought. thanks hyper-fx

--- 帖子 #268 ---
The main problem with all breakout systems is that they completely ignor the maket dynamics. And you can't make it any better just fiddling with artificially calculated levels. So, it doesn't matter if you enter on the actual breakout or on a retracement. For example today you would have losses both ways. But if you look at 30 minutes chart, you will see that there was a classic range market since the very close of yesterdaay's banking day, and volatility was low. So, it is just too risky to enter on a breakout. Better instead to wait till volatility increases. And after that looking for a continuation or a reversal. That's exactly what haappened today. You can see a volatility break down, and soon after that INCREASING range of an up baar. This is the best entry point to go long with target on the upper side of the day. BTW today was a good example of a pattern described by Igrok (his thread is here).

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Just forgot to add. If you look at intraday history you would find that NO real, large and long move ever started from a flat range. There always should be a "false" break before the actual move begins. Remember that when trading breakouts.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Hello Paulus, when the price go up, you trace FIB from the top and when price go down you trace Fib from the bottom of the asian range. Why ? is there a specific rule?

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Hi Steve TP is at the 161.8 fib level not 100 Hyper ....sound good will check it out Piere..just place the fibs so that the TP or 161.8 level is above your entry Hope thats helps sorry for the short answers P

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Well, I guess that now EVERYBODY else including Paulus is ignoring the original rules, perhaps Bilbiss won't mind me joining in again. Crashed out last night so, didn't get to test the floating fibs, as I mentioned to Paulus. Yeah, as I said before getting flac for it, the breakout is just too haphazard on the H1 on most days and we miss the trend on a lower TF which is hinting strongly at where it wants to go.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Rastaman, Actually both breakout and pullback are risky if dynamics of the longer term trend is ignored. At least with pull back method, we can verify that there's a move that may go back to it. But, I also think we should not setup an exact pull back fib level to enter and exit as Paulus describes it. Market will not always abide by certain levels. The enter and exit positions should always be moving with the market. My suggestion is after the asian session, we should verify the move as described by latest instructions then if there's a pull back to the main fib levels we enter at 1/4 positions, then exit when price goes back to the main move at a fib level of no more than 50% of the retrace. The only disadvantage is you must monitor your trades until it's over which is not the purpose of the Paulus system. But, hey, like you said we've tweeked the system already. my opinion, Hyper-fx

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Yes, as you say, we must monitor this system but, that is no big problem, better than monitoring Burgers or even worse kids for 8 hours a day. Also, as has been mentioned, it is easier to see the break on a smaller TF the the H1 which seems to range much more than the M15 or M30 TF. That is the point I was trying to make. All set for the London Crush.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Hi Rastaman, I see on your pics that along with the high and low of the Asian session you also display the range. R=80 (or whatever). Is that part of the indicator you uploaded earlier in this post or something new? If it's new can you attach the new indicator? That would be great. Thanks! Tony

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Attachment Sure, NP. Here is the auto fibo, the antbreakout and the template. This is a good one with the SDX indicator warns you that a possible breakout is taking place.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Do we have a downbreak on EUR/GBB coming up. Obviously not, yet anyway. Too slow for me.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Hi, What is the red and blue line that look slike a Moving Average on the main chart. Regards Steve PS I had my SL &amp; TP the wrong way round in my last post :-(

--- 帖子 #279 ---
You are awesome! Thanks. I did use the basics of the system this morning and made good pips on the GBP/USD and GBP/JPY. Both went long and I captured 20 pips each. I am happy.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
It is the Max Non Lag MA Here you go PS:: Anyone catch the EUR/GBP breakout last night?

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Fraid not Im sticking to just the GBP pairs that have the £ listed as the main and the 2 with the reasonable spread. For last week taking 50% off at 1.618 and bringing stop to break even 2nd 50% off at 200% GBPUSD 50+32(50%)+43-68+87 = 144 pips GBPJPY 77+59(50%)-17+82+26 = 227 pips Combined 371 pips cheers Paul

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Rastaman, Thank You Steve

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Hi Paulus, I have looked at this going back several weeks and some previous dates and I must say that taking prrofits at the 1.618 level works nearly every time. Thank you for a good system. I had seen something similar wher ethe Hi &amp; Lo were fixed at 100 pips from open but that to me never made any sense. I have added the hi/lo line for the 1st 8 hours to my normal EA but I could make it standalone if anyone wants it. Steve

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Hi Steve could you create an EA for this from what you have ? I cannot code at all in meta trader in my old plateform no problem... Here are the signals for last week on GBPUSD the arrow is the trade direction the red line is the 161.8 fib TP..the losing signal is depicted by the green line on the SL point Cheers Paul

--- 帖子 #285 ---
hi friend.. this is an awsome ts.. please explain how should i use those rentracments..

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Yes ea would b great. Then we could test different pairs based on what session opens. Make breakout time a variable

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Hello, really interesting system. I have some questions and I hope you can help me. 1. Can somebody explain me how to configure the fib-tool in that way it also shows the quotes? 2. 1 trade a day means that you don't take another trade after you got stopped out? One example is shown on the picture below.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Hi Yes one trade per day win lose or draw..to get the price on the fib tool just put %$ after the value in description..have attached piccy to help cheers P

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Thanks alot for the fast answer. I have another question: I think most of the time you will be invested in all of your pairs at the same time. When you risk 3% of your account per currencypair you will risk x*3% (X=number of pairs) overall. What is your max risklevel a day?

--- 帖子 #290 ---
me ....watching just 2 pairs just 6% P

--- 帖子 #291 ---
This is something strange I stumbled on over the weekend. Shift the TF to a m15 chart, find the longest candle over the whole 24 hour period and put a red line on the top as resistance and a green line on the bottom as support, highlight the area between the two lines with a reasonably long rectangle so you will be able to identify the area quickly. Shift the chart to an H1 TF and watch where the breakout of the GREEN 5EMA occurs. Don't ask me why this works but it appears to be consistent, even the Sunday bar seems to work.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Ok let's see what happens today. The chart is a H1 EUR/JPY. I have marked the Sunday longest candle tops and bottoms with RED lines, the Friday candle with PURPLE lines and the vertical RD line will be the close of the Asian session. If this works the break UP or DOWN will be at either 134.81 or 134.32 based on the Sunday candle. Based on the Friday candle it will be at either 133.91 or 133.09. I know this is a rather large range and this is because we are testing this with the Sunday candle as part of this equation but, I am sure we will be able to see which of the setups is most valid. If it works it may help to determine the break on the original system after the London open.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
GBP/USD H1 breakout will be at either LONG 1.5237 SHORT 1.5201 based on the Sunday candle. Or, LONG 1.5120 SHORT 1.5056 based on the Friday candle.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
USD/JPY based on the Sunday bar should breakout out high or low as in this chart.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
let's try

--- 帖子 #296 ---
hi man, i would like to have also 200% rentracment.. and not only for short but also for long... i mean: in you template you post only the rentracment with -618 etc i would like to have also +618... instead i can drow them by my self i need them in both direction..

--- 帖子 #297 ---
also why the fibo is from a candle out from the range?? i stay in italy.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Hi Rastaman Looks good but let me re cap as my brain is hurting from last night...no not the wine the song the dance...the Mother in law !! A few question ....you say take the largest candle in a 24 hour period line at the high line at the low.. Then The following day look for a break of either of these 2 lines by the 5 ema ,even if the break occurs in the Asian session whilst the Asian High low is being created Is that correct ? Cheers Paulus

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Yes, that is correct but the chart you mark the breakout points must be a M15 chart, then move up to the H1 and that is where it occurs. Also 5EMA must cross the breakout points. This does not have to be the Asian session, it carries over for 24 hours. The Sunday candle is looking right now as if it may prevail over the Friday candle. Looks like USD/JPY brokeout right on the dot.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
EUR/GBP just made a breakout also at the point we estimated. Let's watch these run.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
GBP/USD also brokeout right on the dot for 103 pips as I write this. Bounced on the 61.8 fibo. Also, notice how it tried to breakout earlier but the 5 EMA did not break the lower line. After it broke the line it shot down. This is uncannily interesting. If these keeps up we will have to start a new thread to develop this system.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
EUR/USD also!!!

--- 帖子 #303 ---
anyone traded pound yen today? probably made a fortune out of it

--- 帖子 #304 ---
No, but a quick check on the longest Sunday candle shows it is viable as long as we make sure the RSI has crossed the 50 mark.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Nice pips on both I follow gbpusd +23 pips GBPJPY +53pips Sound good a new thread is warranted I think on the large bar break out

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Ok, I will start one right now to stop me clustering up your thread.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
thats sounds good Perhaps inc the link here so that people can go from one to another as thier based around a break out system well spotted P

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Yes, I did just that. If it is not too much trouble, I would like to leave the projected breakout posts I posted earlier in this thread as it shows that I did not do this after the fact. Hope to see you in that thread Paulus. Maybe an EA for this system is in order after we refine it. I am off to look for an indicator that shows us the Largest candle. LCB Largest Candle Breakout. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=1#post2725114

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Hi Paulus, something seems to be wrong with the Tokyo indicator. My settings are: asia begin:1 - asia end: 9. These are the settings for germany (London+1). First of all on the picture below you can see that the high of the 1 am candle is higher than the high of the box. Second the low of the asia session is in par with the low of the 9 am candle. But the problem is that Tokyo is closing at the end of the 8 am candle. Do I something wrong?

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Hi The date on that chart is DEC can you get todays chart and post that and we will take a look cheers P

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Try this EA that I modified from the Daily 95 thread. Enter a 1.00 on TP, SL &amp; BE to set those at the hi-lo range between the hours set. TP set at 1.618 would be the equivalent to the fib discussed here in this thread. Bioquim

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Nice trading method. I’ve been doing something similar lately with GU and GJ, but without indicators. I just draw horizontal lines for the Asian high / low and look for a breakout during London. TP is the next area of support / resistance. I’ll read through your thread. It might give me some ideas for improving what I've been doing. Cheers!

thanks a million. will try it out!!

Hy guys ! I think Paulus came with an interesting system an I want to thank to him and to thouse who are bringing good ideeas, so that this system can be improved ! Also I want you guys escuse my english and to forgive me if I am making gramar errors ! So, till now I sow that in this thread were discused a few variants for geting into a trade and for taking profit strategies. I sow that the moment when the trader can get into a trade can be: 1. the breakout of the price from the Asia session or 2. the pullback to 61,8% fib, after the breakout from the Asia session Also I sow that the TP is now at 161.8% fib (as a difference from the original system) So, Paulus as I sow in your last trades that you have posted here, you didn't took into consideration a pullback to 61.8% fib level, and you took the trade as a breakout trade with TP at 161.8% fib. So I am a little lost between thouse two situations 1 or 2 Can you help me with a few resuming ideeas about the actual form of your strategy ? Thank you for your time and for your patience, couse I am a N00b in FX and I might ask stupid questions some time :| N00b_FX

Another good day for this system GBPUSD - +28 pips GBPJPY - + 70 pips FX see your post will answer in a couple hrs Paulus

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Are you using the eur/yen ? Can you post your enter of last days?

--- 帖子 #317 ---
not using that pair..last weeks stats have been posted and yesterday gbpusd +23 pips GBPJPY +53pips Will now look at the pair you suggest P

--- 帖子 #318 ---
so you are using only 2 pairs now GBPUSD and GBPJPY. is it?

--- 帖子 #319 ---
N00b_FX The breakout of the price from the Asia session 10 pips above or below is the entry.This is what I am concentrating on for now..if an EA develops it will be easier to code The TP 161.8% fib that is correct it the TP ..its just 61.8% of the Asian high low added to your entry Hope that helps P

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Yes only those pairs.... 2 had huge spreads and the other just didnt seem to move much P

--- 帖子 #321 ---
thank you

--- 帖子 #322 ---
I see that in the gbp/yen the price have gon below the low. what can I do in this case, open new position or not?

--- 帖子 #323 ---
I dont I take it...this is just 1 trade a day and Ive had that on the break up early in the London open when we had the momentum of the UK traders P

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Thank you Paulus ! I am using this system for two weeks and untill now it worked for me. I will use it from now on with the 161.8% fib TP level and I hope we will have good profits on GBP/USD and GBP/JPY pairs. Another thing Paulus, the trade is taken when the trend is up or down, not flat , am I right ? Thx again !

--- 帖子 #325 ---
wich do you think that are the best range for breackout after asian session? small range or big range? after for example breakout gone in up direction, do you delete the other pendings?

--- 帖子 #326 ---
I am a breakout traders and i found that you breakout system is the best system (Without TP and SL) and i make green pips on UCAD and AU this week.By Mathematical calculation the bigger the trend the bigger the profit. f it hit stop order and the trend countinue we can exit on breakeven and wait for retracment for increase in equity.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Hi... You trade the UCAD and the AU on the London opening?

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Yes.... see the chart and calculate how many one way stop order it hit.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Hi Paulus, Great system thanks. When you say 1 trade per day I assume thats 1 trade per pair per day. i.e. you don't take any opposite trades after one has been taken on a pair. Looking at the charts it strikes me its rare for this to happen anyhow. I like the entry thats fine, I am now looking to refine the exits. a) after a certain profit level take a X% b) trailing stop based on DMI c) perhaps a moving profit target if I can think of some parameters. any other ideas welcome. With this system I need something to fill up the day. Regards Steve

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Hi Just in and out Docs appointment so will answer all later good result again today GBPUSD +53 pips GBPJPY +139 pips As you know at the 161.8 level I take 50% off and bring stop to break even at 200 level I close the rest. If you check the 5min you will see that once the 1st level was hit it just fell again P

--- 帖子 #331 ---
FX I don’t look at trend direction at all is too subjective for me I go with any signal when it occurs.I like things to be mechanical Patt Any range will do me,once long the short order is cancelled yes and visa versa Steve Yes correct 1 trade per day per pair I only follow 2 so for me if the break occurs on each that’s 2 trades At the 1.618 level I close 50% and bring the rest to break even at 200 I close the other 50% You need to take up knitting if you got too much time hehe 8pips Not me cannot code at all in MT4 sorry but others may be willing to Don’t forget there is a vailid reason behind this break out ..the 1st market to open after the Asian session is the UK and we all look at highs and lows of sessions..once broken buying and seilling often piles in…not always of course and there are days when things just don’t go right but that’s just trading Paulus

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Paulus, I just looked at your charts and I have a question about GBP/USD trade from today: How come your stop loss hasn't been hit ? Couse the first candle from London sesion took your sell order and then the seccond candle (the one who goes up) touched the 1.5329 level (the SL of our trade...) I mean , do you use a bigger stop loss than the high/low of the Asia sesion ? Thx again for your help and for your info about the take profit sistem

--- 帖子 #333 ---
FX Sorry the stop is 10pips above the high..we need a price break of 10 pips to enter..I need the high or low to support my trade if it moves against me...To set it at the high or low wouldnt work same as when we use swing low for a stop on a long we set it just below the swing low NOT the swing low itself Cheers Paulus

--- 帖子 #334 ---
So, in this particular case my stop loss should be at 1.5339 (high of the Asia sesion + 10 pips), right ? Sorry if I am so persistent, but I want to put the things in worder for me, couse today I just took a nice loss And I agree that the high can support us when the price goes against us

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Hi FX_NOOB, I too took a loss on that one. I was thinking of adding to the stop loss 10 pips (Like Paulus suggested) but now I see where I was suppose to have done so all along. The good news is since I noticed all of the other GBP pairs started moving down in direction I jumped on board and rode it back down to the 161.8 level so it more than made up for the loss. I don't suggest anyone do this... I just had a hunch it would.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Nice ride man For me this is really a mechanical system, couse I don't have time to stay arround my trading platform so I just give orders and do my job From now on I will keep in mind what you and Paulus told me about this SL. Thx !

--- 帖子 #337 ---
What is it you want? An indicator is not the right vehicle but I can let you have something that will draw the hi/lo lines for the 8 hours. Steve

--- 帖子 #338 ---
I'm done with knitting and needlework as I have t o many sweaters already :-) Looking good. Steve

--- 帖子 #339 ---
I caught a loss on the GBPJPY today with a buy that then dropped to close on the stop loss. In looking at Paulus' chart I see that you're using the 0 GMT to 8 GMT for the Asian session. I know there's been lots of talk here as to which is the preferred time frame for the Asian. I'd been using the 23:00-7:00am GMT as seen on the chart posted by Rasteman. Today this setup stopped the Asian session 'box', the bar before the spike to 148.045. So my buy stop was hit. Then trade closed for a loss on the drop to SL at 146.50. So I plan to start using the 0-8 GMT setting. A related topic is; should the buy stop level be adjusted to accommodate the bid-ask spread? I believe the numbers MT4 lists for the bar hi-lo-open-close are the bid numbers, correct? If the spread is 3 pips on the GBPUSD and the Asian session 'hi' (bid hi) was 146.00, the ask hi would have been 146.03. Shouldn't the buy stop for entry be set at 13 pips (10 + 3=13) added to the bid hi, for the session? In this case if buy stop (ask) is set at 146.13, then when the bid price reaches 146.10, a buy stop for entry would be triggered at 10 pips from the bid hi of the Asian session, at 146.13. On the sell stop you're working with the bid price so the Asian session bid low level, minus 10 pips, would be the proper sell stop setting for 10 pips away from lowest bid level of Asian session. So for GBPUSD with a spread of 3 pips, the buy stop entry level would be set at +13 pips above the Asian bid hi, and -10 pips below the Asian session bid low for a sell entry. Right? Anyone feel free to let me know if my math or reasoning is off. Thanks, LeoM

--- 帖子 #340 ---
I would agree with adding the spread , as I always do, for the sell stop. Although it seems that the stops don't get hit to often we might as well get it right. Steve

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Hi Paulus, I understand that you take out 50% of the position at 161.8 and the rest at 200. Now doesn't that mean the risk reward is less than 1:1 ? What are your views on that? Cheers D

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Hi, Perhaps this question have come up before, but I can't seem to find the answer in the thread. The range is supposed to be 0 to 7 GMT. Which 1H bars should I include, it should be the 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 bars, right? I have noticed that often the big move starts at 8 GMT. Have anyone tried using that time as end of the range instead? Regards Archie

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Yes guys, for the GU normally the big move starts at 8.00 GMT

--- 帖子 #344 ---
bad trades today.. eur/usd still in range..

i hope this is just a pullback..

i'm out il loss on both position. uff

--- 帖子 #350 ---
I have decided to stay away from today's trades...too many whipsaws! 'Tis like bulls and bears have equally matched strengths today. got hit two times on each pair i traded and all i could do was laugh and close my trading platform

--- 帖子 #351 ---
I am out too...It seems that the news are afecting our system...

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Its always dangerous to generalise as someone will always find the exceptions, however, having seen todays performances with losses on both pairs I have gone over the settings and this is what I see. I have not included any 10 pip +/- to the high low values. Notes are for Long positions. Shorts are opposite. 1) if a break doesn't hold above the high of the 8hr on a 15 min chart then it seems to come back into the range. Spikes galore!! 2) both pairs seem to make 25 pips without to much problem from the break points possible point to go to break even. 3)Once a break out is in force attention can be given to MM and by using the LOW swing points it may be possible to reduce any major reversals. I hate the idea of seeing a profitable trade retrace all the way back to the opposite side for a major loss. I am not looking to change the basic Opening Range method just trying to improve on the MM side. All comments welcome

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Yes 2 losses today but be careful things dont go like other threads...ie A nice system a couple losers and all intereste dies. I know its been said many times before but it is true there is no holy grail ..all we can ever do is stack the odds in our favour. Both trades went very close to taking a profit at the 1.618 level ..now i dont use TA in any form in relation to subjective decsion makingI can se a 4 way bottom with the lows of 11th 12th 13th and today the 14th even so given this I still would not of changed my 1st TP. You shouldn't be taking 2 losers per swap only one I only trade once a day on this. I agree it does often move 20 -30 pips when a break occurs but there needs to be a very efficient way of taking smaller profits perhaps scaling in and out other wise as high lighted by another poster our RR is effected. If news is an issue then we shouldnt trade around the news or we should at least close out some time before if we are in profit. If your using MM then the losses today wouldnt of effected your account... p

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Hi Paulus, I've just read through this whole thread. I want to let this run over a week or so to get a feel for it - to do so, I'm going to throw together an EA. Can you please confirm I'm understanding the rules (as you are trading them) correctly? Trade two pairs - GBP/USD and GBP/JPY H1 time frame (but, time frame really shouldn't matter here) Determine the high and low of the Asian session At the open of the London session start watching for a breakout of the Asian session hi/low The London session opens an hour before the Asian session closes - start looking as soon as London opens, or wait until Asia closes which is one hour in to London? When price breaks the hi/lo plus 10 pips plus spread, enter. Stoploss is the other side (so, if we enter long, the stop would be the low of the Asian session, again plus 10 plus spread?) Close half out at 1.618 Fib Level and move the other half to B/E Close the second half at 2.0 Fib level At the end of the day (end of London session, or.... ??) close anything that is open. If there hasn't been a breakout by now, stop watching for one until the next day when we start over again. Only take one trade per day, per pair. Win or lose, stop trading that pair for the rest of the day once a trade triggers. Repeat the next day. Am I missing anything, or have I misinterpreted any of the rules? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Hi Paulus and all, I placed 6 trades last night and I have 1 loss and 3 wins. I traded the E/P, E/J and G/J. As you can see this is about bunts and not home runs. I traded a similar strategy about a year ago and I can tell you this has many advantages over that one. In fact, to many to go into.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Hi all.. Has anyone tried this on GBPCAD? I got stopped out this morning. The broker 15 pip spread doesn't help matters either. Should the only pairs be GBP/USD and GBP/JPY as suggested above by cgrey ? Cheers

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Two wins today using standard Paulus but with TP at the 2.618. Due to the ranging activity of yesterday and close range in todays Asian session, I guessed there would be a big move today. +67 on GBPUSD, +131 on GBPJPY

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Paulus, I think there is a problem with GMT in the hour TF. I start tokyo to 0 GMT and this is ok I end tokyo at 6 GMT and I start my london rush at the same time (6 GMT) But if I put 6 GMT on the hourly chart the time on this chart is from 6:00 to 6:59, then I have to put 5 gmt if I wish my london rush start at 6

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Pierre, there still seems to be some confusion over the times and time zones! I'm sure I'll be corrected instantly if I'm giving false information here. But to my knowledge the Tokyo session runs from 23:00-07:00 GMT. The server my Mt4 connects to, i.e it's 'marketwatch time' is showing London time (BST). London is NOT in GMT at present it's in BST, which is one hour ahead of GMT. Therefore the candles spanning 00:00-07:59 BST are 'Tokyo session'. However, 07:00BST is the opening of Frankfurt and 08:00BST is London's opening (i.e the 'London Rush' begins). I therefore exclude the 07:00-07:59BST candle. That particular candle today on GBP/JPY spanned ~129pips. So my 'Tokyo session' is marked as 00:00-06:00BST (or 23:00-05:00GMT if my marketwatch time was in GMT). I'm probably doing this totally wrong, but when I read the notes on Al Russell's 'London Forex Rush' he mentions something about excluding the Frankfurt opening when looking at the Tokyo session hi/low. Anyone else do this?

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Ok 2 wins one trade on eaxh both short GBPUSD GBPJPY Both hit thier 161.8 fib level..this may be confusing to some but all it is is the high and low of the Asian session which in fib terms goes from 0 to 100 So the low will be 0 the high will be 100 so thats 100% of the asian session..we then get a long signal so I want to close out 50% at the 61.8 fib level thats 61.8% of the 100% value,so if the high low is 100 pips then when we get to 161.8 pips I want to close. I call this the 161.8 fib level and you can see it marked on my fib tool and charts

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Im adding EURJPY Alot of Euro traders will look to the Asian hi Lo areas,its makes sense and will monitor it EURJPY M -71 pips 100% taken at 200% fib T -50 pips 50% taken at 161.8 % fib W -67 pips 50% taken at 161.8% fib T -78 pips 100% taken at market close F -86 pips 50% taken at 161.8% fib Will add other results for other 2 swaps for this week P

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Hi Paulus, Something seriously wrong for me here. My EurJPY today was 40 Pips from Asian Low of 130.44. I wonder if I have the time zone correct? Regards Steve

--- 帖子 #363 ---
&lt;&lt;So my 'Tokyo session' is marked as 00:00-06:00BST (or 23:00-05:00GMT if my marketwatch time was in GMT).&gt;&gt; Exactly . you mark the end of the tokyo session at 5 GMT. Very helpfully Thanks

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Hi Steve its timings again here is my chart of EURJPY for today // and the chart will help with settings Cheers P

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Penny has just dropped. 1.618 was only 50% rest left to trade. Sorry Steve

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Hy ! This was a good day for trade. I think GBP/JPY is more reliable till now. About EUR/JPY I will try to do some back testing and see if he is stable in time. And Paulus, I am sorry if I looked pretty disapointed yesterday, but trust me, I really want that this thread to go on, couse for me this is a verry useful system. And I hope that eaven if we are trading once a day, we will be here for a long time, so that this system will make us to grow together. Thx again Paulus and guys, have some faith in this system !

--- 帖子 #367 ---
het FX no prob I see it this way a day trader may have W W L L W L W w W l W W W L W We have the same strike rate but ours is counted in days so we look for totals at the weeks end If I was trading weekly charts I look for the months end or 3month end totals No worries P

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Thanks. It looks like I am completely off the mark with the timings as I thought London open was 06:00 BST not 08:00 BST. I am running FXDD but will probably be changing to ODL shortly. I won't need to get up so early next week :-) I don't know what this has done to all my manual back testing which was looking very good. Steve

--- 帖子 #369 ---
hey paulus and everyone, loving the looks of this system. here's a quick back test to the beginning of this april for EURUSD, GBPUSD, GBPJPY AND EURJPY. going to go back a few more months during this weekend for GBPJPY to see if it can keep up the high win rate. don't hold me accountable for accuracy of the test. i did my best on it, but this is only my third week studying forex. also, i assumed exiting all of the position at the 161.8 fib. if you hold half until 200, there are several instances in which more pips could be made. spread was not included or accounted for in any of the testing.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
datu All looks very promising locking in profits but allowing a larger gain is tough..not nice to see a 50 pip profit end up as a 90 pip loss.... Im using the fib levels as its mechanical and I like mechanical...dont like emotional Im very black and white that way but there may be a better mechanical method of taking the profits... Thanks for the work it will help a great deal. I will be looking more into this over the week end time permitting Thanks again paulus

--- 帖子 #371 ---
There's been some debate about spreads earlier on in this thread. Can i get a consensus of opinion regarding how you treat broker spread please? If we take the entry level as TokyoHigh+10 and S/L as TokyoLow-10 (on a long position) do you factor in your spreads on top of this, and opposite on short trades? It's not so much the S/L that is issue, but more the false trigger on entry if the broker spread is high that bugs me. Any comments/thoughts please? Cheers Steve

--- 帖子 #372 ---
manual back test through january now. eur/usd got destroyed in jan and eur/jpy not holding up too well either. looks like gbp/jpy and gbp/usd could be the only way to go. eyes and brain tired while going through all of this, so don't rely on it for 100% accuracy. spread not accounted for. will take it back a full year by the end of the weekend.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Steve, See my opinion in post #339. Add spreads, but on the buy stop only , as MT4 by default marks bar hi-lo using the bid price. LeoM

--- 帖子 #374 ---
datugman This is really impressive, thanks for putting all that together. I remember reading somewhere that JPY crosses are better for breakouts, your findings seem to confirm this.

For bouth, TP and SL ? Thx !

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Hi all... Reading here of the first time... I am assuming the method has changed a little from the first post....I base this asumption on the chart in post # 364 of Fridays setup....where the Fib is set at 0 for the high and 100% for the low....where in the first post the low was set to the 50% level.... If there are other changes is it possible to add a section to the first post about "Method changes..."

--- 帖子 #380 ---
a simple script which will draw the high and low onto a chart. Its a "SCRIPT" so goes in the experts/script folder, its not an indicator or expert. You may have to change the hour setting manually, not difficult and I could change/add teh 10pip line if anyone is interested. Just a starter

--- 帖子 #381 ---
yea, really good for me if you would add the 10 pips code lines. would you?

--- 帖子 #382 ---
here is an indicator thats shows the Asian session plus the 10 pip over and under the high low You can set this to anything in the 'inputs 'tab GM shift I have as 0 Start 0 End 8 Looks good and has the +10 high low lines projected forward cheers Paulus

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Hi Paulus, Do you mind posting the source rather than the .exe. please Steve

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Hi Paulus, I think the "End" value must be 7 and not 8. Cos if you use 8, then 9 bars are counted as in the figure you have shown. And the asian session lasts for 8 hours. Please correct me if I am wrong on this.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
I thought I had this. I believe London opens @ 06:00 GMT. Currently UK is on Bristish Summer Time GMT+1 . My server is 2 hours in front of BST so London Open is 09:00 server. The Hi Lo should be x bars upto the hour before i.e. 08:00, x = length of hours Asian Market is open. If opens @ 01:00 server time then bars =7. If Asian is 8 hours long then open is 00:00. You cannot use the bar that is the London opening bar. I am using FXDD server. Steve

tokyo session if from 9 am till 5 pm tokyo hour.8 hours, 8 candles. tell Rastaman, he lives in tokyo.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Hi Matte, Doesn't matter to much where he lives. I wanted to correlate London GMT to Tokyo start/end. 8 candles is correct though bar at start 090:00 ends at bar 16:00. Script with +/- 10 pips for you. Steve

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Tokyo is 8 hours in front of UK British Summer Time and 9 hours in front of GMT. My calcs would agree with deedeed. I still can't determine what is the correct open time for London 06:00 or 08:00 as I have seen on "babypips.com" I always thought it was 06:00. Steve

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Has anyone considered there is an overlap between the Asia market times and London? Steve

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Hello, I'm not sure where to set the stop loss. Is it the 0.00 line or 10 pips below/above?

--- 帖子 #391 ---
10 pips above/below

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Thx

--- 帖子 #393 ---
if anybody wants to keep testing the euro feel free, i've given up on it. back test for EUR/USD to beginning of november '08 results gives -296 pips. back test for EUR/JPY to beginning of october '08 gives 102 pips. edit: just to be clear, i think for trading the london session this can still be a great way to help choose or confirm an entry point, but you will definitely need other techniques to manage your s/l and t/p instead of the mechanical method that is so easily used on the gbp pairs.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
I would generally agree about TP/SL. I am looking at swing points to manage Stops. Did you do anything with GBP/USD &amp; GBP/JPY Steve

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Steve I'd second that. This system is very promising, but in my opinion it possibly needs a tweak on the S/L management side of things. Also has anyone tested the difference in results between taking 100% T/P at 1.618 instead of 50% and not chancing the other 50%?. All good though.. I very much like this idea/system. Cheers Steve

--- 帖子 #396 ---
The backtest from March to current date doesn't look so good. It's only recently that good pips are made.

hi! please backtest this.. first like paulus says enter at +5 pips sl at the other side out half at 161,8 and other half at 200% with stop at breackeven scond: full take profit at 161,8% 3: same as first but SL, if we go short at +10 pips on 618 fibo if long at -10pips from 618 fibo 4: same as 3+2 am i clear?

--- 帖子 #398 ---
my backtest is the second one and closed all trades at end of day

--- 帖子 #399 ---
ok, can u try also the other two? for compare the results and see what was the better tp

--- 帖子 #400 ---
this is an hourly chart not 1 or 5min..we have to give it room to breath if it doesnt we will just keep getting busted out of a trade. We cant take 20pips whilst using a full range hi lo SL of 80 odd pips believe me you just wont make money. We need a stop that will allow the trade to breath and a method of locking in some profits the remainder of which we bring to break even untill we hit another higher or lower TP To use a none lag ma and ma a stochastic Psar williams RSI or another other type of price based indicator wont work.. What will work I think is level that across the industry are looked at and traded around amonst many the golden ratio of 0.618 and 1.618 is one of them for stop swing high lows or high of day and low of day are also looked at .. I think you will be hard pushed to find a better combination Trading 2 lots on each of the 3 swaps last wek would of made you many $k not bad for one trade a day. just my thoughts Paulus

Hi, What are you using to backtest this and are you prepared to share. I can contribute with programming skills as well if you wish Steve

--- 帖子 #402 ---
OK, so the 50% 1.618, 50% 2.0fib is mandatory else we'll not be taking sufficient TP. Looking at past results posted in the XLS GBPJPY appears to be the best, followed by GBPUSD. Maybe I'm not thinking straight here, but with Mt4 how can I set this up with an OCO trade? - there seems no option to have the long cancel the short or vice-versa. Also to close off 50% I assume we have to take out two separate trades at the entry point with 50% of the lot size to accommodate this? I'm new with MT4, as previously I used spreadbet proprietary platoforms.. to which I note UK's IGINDEX also dont' seem to offer OCO trades? How's best to set up these trades on pending order basis? Cheers Steve

--- 帖子 #403 ---
here is another angle to it borrowed from the Robin hood trading method We get the break then go down to 5min chart we need this because we are going to use a stochastic to enter with. We get the break 10 pips above the hi or lo We switch to 5min time scale and we wait until for a long the stoch goes green for a short the stoch goes red. We then take the normal TP An example of a short you can see the break the pull back the entry the target can be 2 types either 161.8 or... the 5 level on the stoch what ever comes 1st again this is taken from the Robin hood thread and works well

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Another example draw down is reduced Profit goes from 41 pips normal set up to 96 pips

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Pips profit goes from 30 pips normal entry to 69 pips new entry Draw down zero Distance from entry to SL ( 10 pips below 0.00 or bottom of yellow band) is smaller giving better RR I have inc the colour Stoch

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Hello, can somebody explain me why the break of the 100 line +/- 10 pips differ on timeframe 15 m and 1 h? This means that I'm not getting the same entry points on both tfs. I'm using the ant-gubreakout

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Hi Paulus, I like this idea and will test it out. Thanks also for attaching the color indicator.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
maybe this is me misunderstanding the fib lines, but i see different 618 levels dependent upon whether i show the 1hour or 5 min candles. This drastically changes things. Can anyone shine light on this? - I read in one post that 1 hour time frame to set the fib levels, and then seen another post says timeframe irrelvent.. confused... sorry

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Hi all.. Leaftrader......the Fib is calculated using the High and low....and as long as you are still using these while in the lower TF the Fib should be the same....The High and Low should not change for the selected Period regardless of Timeframe... Am I seeing things or is this NO longer an indicator free (not including Fib. Lvls ). Making it more complicated will not help...So which entry to take and how will we know when it will retrace or not....the Stoch is always good in hindsight....a bit more difficult in live trades... And can we confirm......This current Hour Bar is the Start of the Trading Block.....?

Paulus Can you sher angle indi......? Thank you

--- 帖子 #417 ---
This is only the nexy step in the evolution of this system. Im happy sticking with the 1hr time frame but several were worried about draw down and risk reward thats why I suggested going to the 5min once we have a trigger on the 1hour. The only reason for this is to see the retracements. Im not too worried about the stoch coming in for the ride and it doesn't look better in hindsight it goes green or red away you go..... But you will prob miss some good trades I had only been trading this for a very short time I know one person here that uses RSI with it to good effect we take the basic system and adapt to how we feel comfortable what I do agree with is that we shouldnt clutter chart with loads of indicators that basically tell you the same thing. I dont particularly like indicators but if they give you an edge hey...why not I have also set up an MT4 for the US breakout,I will monitor this and pass on any good results Paulus

Hi all. LeafTrader........your GBPJPY is close enough to mine so I would say its right...

I'm running a demo on Fxpro and my hi-lo for GBPUSD today were the same as yours. In the indicator settings I have 0 for begin session hour and 8 for end session hour. LeoM

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Thanks Angler.. Upon further inspection I notice I think I had the earliest candle missing. LeoM suggests 0 to 8 which is 9 candles? - I had 8.. I've re-adjusted the indicator and re-drawn the fibs. Any comments on attached chart? right or wrong? My marketwatch time by the way is BST or GMT+1. So the 'London Open' would show on the candle starting at 8AM (i.e the first candle NOT in the Tokyo range). Cheers LeafTrader.

Hi all... LeafTrader..... I was worried there for a minute then noticed it was a GBPUSD chart....lol The Block looks about right now...

hi all. LeoM,i am also using FXpro demo,what are your settings for GMTshift,day number and offset in the antGUbreakout indi?? actually,my hi and lo previously posted was not using the antGUbreakout indi, i used this Cable Indicator attached below.just change the brokerServerGMT to broker offset. i put mine 3 (i hope i am right).please try this one out guys.

I use the ## Breakout Box_Asian indicator which doesn't have GMT or broker time settings. Attached below. When I set the Asian session to 0 to 8:00 it displays correctly. From my comparison of platforms, IBFX is 0 GMT, while ProFX broker is +3 GMT. LeoM

I dont want to mix the thread but on the 3 swaps im looking at for the US break all 3 in the money time monitored is 12.00 to 14.00 The pink zone

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Hi Paulus, I don't want to mix the thread either... just thought I would add the following. I have been using the Big Dog strategy found here on this Forum for trading the New York session break for a few weeks with good success. I have just been focusing on +20 to +30 pips for each pair but today I decided to use the Fib tool like I have been using for the London session. Worked today. One other thing I have noticed in trading the US Session is that if the EUR/USD moves so does the USD/CHF in the opposite direction so I have been trading it and the AUD/USD as well with same success.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Hi all.. Hey Paulus I kept a look out for your "US breakout version" you mentioned earlier. 12:00 till 14:00 is interesting.. US start at 13:00 ? Perhaps a new thread to start on this one, as I'd be keen to follow this. Keeping it mechanical too, then some backtesting to be done.. Cheers LeafTrader

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Hi guys, This looks a really good system so far - really enjoying reading the thread and how it is progressing. I am glad people are benefiting and lots of pips are being pocketed! Just a quick question - what kind of results does this system give in a ranging market? Thanks and keep up the good work John

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Hi All. Johnh......Like most Breakout methods....it does require a certain amount of movement to be successful....but trading around the UK opening gives plenty of chance for profit even if its just a quick spike up/down..

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Johnh The only protection I have in a ranging market is closing out 50% and bringing the stop to break even when we hit the 161.8 % line..other than that Ive spent 12 years trying to find a mechanical way of assesing a range or trend day and havnt been able to solve it yet lols Leaf trader yes US opens at 1pm im taking the timings off of another thread running on FF,the one that adsanders is also following with some success with is great Angler I like your statement under your name..even if a well presented and back tested system is shown to us we should question criticize ( in the most polite way) and try and break it ... it will pay dividends in the long run. When the British army produced a new weapon for infantry and called it the SA80 they gave it to the Royal Marin Commandos and said ' take it to Norway see if you can break it tell us whats bad about it' 4 weeks later they threw it back to the MOD in bits and said its a pile of Sh*t...lols because of that we now have its descendant without all the short comings ..... Paulus

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Hi Paulus, I know what you mean about exits. Entries are relatively easy just eiteh BUY or SELL. Its the getting out which is the problem. Looking at today and comparing a swing trade exit and the 200 level exit would have probably given the same result over the 2 GY &amp; GU pairs. The advantage of the swing stop loss is that it does potentially reduce the losses before the price gets to the profit levels. Other than that it is probably better just to rest and enjoy the actual profit. My son once told me that I wouldn't go broke if I closed all my trades for a profit :-) This system basics already looks sound to me and any tinkering could be regard as being greedy. Regards Steve

--- 帖子 #442 ---
I have been using this system for some time and it has been consistently providing good pips why the tinkering pls paulus sir, this is a very great system, and thanks for sharing it. it is not by force that everyone trades this way, if it suits ones trading personality then let him do it, else look for another one they are many here in FF, dont let us tinker too much with it, the fib levels are OK No system produces winners all the time, if there is then FX would not be kos

--- 帖子 #443 ---
HI all.. Kosomolate - I think I may have contributed to the so called tinkering, as I mentioned the risk to reward was quite high earlier in the thread, and I think someone else mentioned draw-down. Tinkering more often than not leads to trouble. Refinement is something else, but it's a fine line. I'm pleased to hear that you find the system profitable and workable. All credit goes to Paulus for kicking it off. Please don't misunderstand that as a newbie here to FF that I wish to cause hassle, as that's far from the case - wherever possible I wish to contribute positively. I think from reading the entire thread, there is sufficient support here to look at some of these 'tweaks' suggested as maybe's - which would need back and forward testing to prove. Either way the main system remains unchanged, and Paulus has only investigated 'tweaks' to potentially reduce RR. Investigation is one thing, applying it and changing the system is another matter. Cheers

--- 帖子 #444 ---
I'm happy to use the system as is with my own mods as its a good system. I like the once a day decision. Trouble is, is that if there is nothing else to say about it then the thread is as good as finished. Regards

--- 帖子 #445 ---
LOL... Good Point!

--- 帖子 #446 ---
then let us discuss trades as we take them till all of us will be doing the same thing at the same time and reporting same amount of pips pocketed or not pocketed. then if there is any lapse we see the cause, which fundamental news to be wary of e.g. the unemployment claims of last thursday on USD turned this system around and all good trades b4 1:15pm became bad... that is when newbies like me would know why things happen the way they do kos

--- 帖子 #447 ---
No system has the Holy Grail encrypted into it, this system like any other system has its flaws, the only seeming solution would be to reduce the stop loss to say 20 points but i have discovered that there are days that the price would come very close to the SL and then reverse back in the initial direction, but looking at the bright side, you end up with profit most of the week and i think good money management would prevent your account from being wiped out. Cheers mate

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Hi Paulus, Just out of curiousity, you said that you trade the following pairs: gbpusd gbpaud gbpjpy gbpcad gbpchf gbptry Which platform and broker do you use? I use FXDD on the Meta Trader Platform but i cannot see GBPAUD, GBPCAD and GBPTRY on the list of pairs traded.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
OK well today, my buy order was triggered on GBPUSD at 1.5506, TP at 1.5527 (50% position closed) - moved up the SL to break even, which then closed out quite quickly as the price retraced. So I'm out of this trade now.. Pips=21 (less broker spread). Anyone else have the same, or was I too hasty to move up the SL on the remaining 50% of the trade?

--- 帖子 #450 ---
my TP was 1.5526 and also my stop avoided getting hit by .3 pips, so second half still running. so pretty much all the same.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
LOL! .3 pips! I thought you were lucky there datugman, but it looks like it's retraced back again now. What's our thoughts on GBPJPY do we expect to see action on this today? Steve

--- 帖子 #452 ---
wondering when will paulus start to share the us breakout.could it be like the big dog breakout somewhere in this thread.7am to 9am est trading time.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
but pips = 22 I dont know if that is too fast kos

--- 帖子 #454 ---
yeah, stopped out at B/E about five minutes later lol. anyways, you didn't move the stop too fast as you're supposed to move it as soon as the first trade closes at the 161.8 level, which you did.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
hello! what about gbpjpy and eurjpy are you guys still waiting for a breakout or cancel it if it doesnt apearin few hours and the pairs have done some movement allready?thanks for the explanation. maklla

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Looks to me like a 18 Pip profit taken at 1.618 level. Break even on the remainder of the trade at 200 level. Thats my view. I still have some difficulty with the timings of the London open though. I now have it at 07:00 BST/06:00GMT Steve

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Trade opened if it has to hit, not break 10 pips from low. Trading at a loss at the moment. If it has to break past then no trade. I guess its the first rule. Just checked its ahit not break so a loss in progress Comments on hit or break useful.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
GBPJPY nearly gave us a 154 pip loss. This is unacceptable in my view. How can we limit this? If we didn't take spread into account this would be a LOSS now. It hit the upper level to the pip :-(

--- 帖子 #459 ---
steve, which level did your trade for GJ activate? Coz according to my chart today is ranging

--- 帖子 #460 ---
ahbinn.. Same here, my upper and lower range incl +/- 10 pips is 149.18 and 147.43. Since London open it's just being ranging around the 50.0 fib level. It seems lacking in momentum, and I'm contemplating not bothering with it today. LeafTrader.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
in my opinion,the difference between the high and low of tokyo range in this case is big, more than 120pips. it is not recommended to trade or enter carefully if the hi lo difference is big.it s hard to determine the max range. the yen is already being traded in the asian session by the japs,unlike GU.this makes GU has a higher probability of breakout once the big dogs in uk opens.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
For me the order did not get triggered, because 10+spread always saves you from false breakout

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Agree 50 -60 for GU, I do not know about GJ.....

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Guess you were not too hasty dude, i think the market is going the reverse direction soon...

--- 帖子 #465 ---
in my opinion, for japan session if GJ range over than 200pips, it will ranging within this range(ranging). i think all of you could backtest. and, i trade with PO at 61.8 level, TP at 161.8 &amp; 200.00 level and SL at 00.00 level. so it make reward bigger than risk.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Some of you might find the attached trade management expert by Steve Hopwood helpful in managing the split of your initial trade lot between two take profit levels. The included pdf file gives directions on the settings options. The thread for this expert is at; http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=89371 You're able to control the specific order number that's managed, and split your initial order however you like; open with .5 lots, then close .2 at first level, and close remainder, .3, at second TP level. You can assign a variety of SL functions such as remaining lots go to BE breakeven when the first lots portion is closed. There are other functions such as trailing stops, step stops, and basket trade processing, which may not be needed for the Paulus method. Today I entered GBPUSD on a buy stop with .4 lots at 1.55117 and set TP at 423.6% for the order. After the market had ranged for several hours I turned on the expert with the first "Jumping Stops Pips" target at + 26 pips (1.618% level), and 'AddBEP=true', or stop loss goes to break even, when +26 pips was reached and .2 lots closed. The remaining .2 lots ran to 1.56500 and closed at the combined 423.6% Fib level, and a daily R2 level. The directions in the instruction manual are clear but I've listed my settings below in case that helps. To access the partial lot closure use the "Jumping Stops" section settings. The manager is an expert and goes in the experts folder. Default settings plus: Manage by ticket number = true Ticket number = enter seven digit order number BreakEven = true BreakEvenPips = 260 (This is 26 pips; add the last 0 if a five digit broker) BreakEven profit = 0 or 2, etc. whatever pips profit you want above original entry number. JumpingStop = true JumpingStopsPips = 260 AddBEP = true (to break even SL at first closure level is optional) PartClosedEnabled = true Close_Lots = 0.2 PreserveLots = 0.2 (These together should add up to the original entry of total lots) Leave the other settings at default. LeoM

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Well said bro, well said...actually what i do in this kind of situation is to take the second top as my buy stop (or second bottom as my sell stop) and the low of the asian session as my sell stop (or hi of the asian session as my buy stop) whichever one gets hit first...for example today, GBPJPY was already trending during the Asian session in the downwards direction but was beginning to reverse when the London session was about to open so i applied this method and both of the buy orders for GBPUSD and GBPJPY were triggered and hit the TP. Y'see this was what should have happened but i ended up moving my SL so i actually got hit! (talking about today's hit and run whipsaws and late trend on the GBPUSD...boy was it a ride or something? Watch it guys, you might turn choleric trading forex - i mean emotionally spent and none remaining for the wife at the end of the day...lol)

Hi Everyone, It seems I was a candle short which gave me the trigger. My EA mistake. I have uploaded a script which draws all the lines for the system. It runs on Hrly charts. Its easy to eyeball and see that this is a very good system.

absolutely and completely wrong. please don't just state opinions without doing some fact checking. for example, here is a back test for october '08. note all of the huge wins and huge losses because of the wide tokyo session. if you had skipped trading because the tokyo range was over 200 pips, you miss out on a huge number of pips.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Thanks LeoM, This should be very helpful! I was wondering... are you trading live or demo?

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Well I cocked it up good and proper this morning. GBPJPY broke the high and then of course headed South, stopping me out on the way making a fat loss. To make matters worse, I'd only put long trades on GBPUSD - and of course that's fell off and yielding great profits (1.618 and 2.0) for all of you that placed the short trades correctly ;-) Will have to pay more attention tomorrow! Cheers

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Just demo trading this system at present. It looks very promising however, so might go live with small lots in the near future. I like the mechanical simplicity of setting breakout stops but don't like losing the gains made with the GBPUSD to losses from the more volatile GBPJPY. I'm playing with looking at overbot/oversold indicators on 30m, 4H and daily charts to either, weight my exposure with different size lots between the two pairs, or occassionally only trade one. For example, today the 50 bar regression channel on the daily GBPUSD showed it overbot-maxed out on the upper channel line. This usually indicates a drop even in an upward/bullish channel. So I set my TP levels very low at the S1 daily pivot level (1.5535) which today was halfway between the 261.8% and the 423.6% Fib retracement levels. It went to that level, closed me out, and and is now retracing. I got dinged on the GBPJPY however; went long on the buy stop, then closed for a loss at the SL level at bottom of the Asian session box. So today broke even. On the overbot/oversold indies the GBPJPY was mid-range so no bias for today's breakout. If I see this again, I might consider setting trade lot amounts to represent what looks like a bias. For example, 2x the lots for the GBPUSD entry stops, as used on the GBPJPY entry stops. I don't want to overcomplicate a simple system, but hate taking the big losses when a trade reverses.

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Hi all... I dont think you will ever find a cure for what occured today.....and I am sure no indicator will help.. It was just some BAD economic data coming out of the UK that caused the big move...

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Leomeister, I did the same as you did, taking into consideration de stocastic for bouth gbp/jpy and gbp/usd. But I think I will only trade this system (especialy in thouse choppy times)...when the stocastic will show me overbot/oversold. I thought that I should take only gbp/usd but then I got into gbp/jpy too.... But this is how we learn from mistakes Have pips !

--- 帖子 #475 ---
I think I learned a valuable lesson here. They say to always check for news before you place your trade and unless you are planning on trading the news it is probably best to wait until after the news. Well I did check for the news... but after my trade was triggerred and after I saw the huge move down on the GBP/JPY. Oh well... lesson learned. Ouch.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Same here :|

--- 帖子 #477 ---
I havent had time to read all the posts as time for me is so short..how ever there is nothing stopping you just trading the reliable GBPUSD Nice gain on that today and EURJPY came to a hairs breath of stopping out but has now closed out 50% at the 161.8 level Yep GBPJPY loss was painful but the loss should of only been 3% max of your account balance.. Us break today went well 1 loser 2 winners On hols Sunday for 1 week so no updates from me all looks good P

--- 帖子 #478 ---
You are wright Paulus. it didn't kill my account, couse MM is verry important for me Paulus, please tell me what are the rules that you are using for US break system and what hours (GMT) Thx !

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Someone can develop an EA for this system like it take High Low of 8hrs (or X hrs we determine period) and put an order X pips above,below it with tp X pips we choose a fibo number for example and sl option? thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
excuse me but EURJPY for me give not win.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Im serious thinking of using the 0.618 fib pull back as an entry.I may miss some flyer's but if I enter on the fib pull back with my SL at 0.00 +10pips it gives me a much smaller SL I need to spend more time on this I have a few ideas about further entry positions if we get a flyer but not a pull back for entry..trouble is off on hols Sunday for 1 week Hmmm always time time time P

--- 帖子 #482 ---
you stop should have been the low -10 pips, which according to your chart is 129.80 and was never hit.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
This is unbelievable, how did that happened? EURJPY hit the SL i.e. the low of Asian session, or are we not using the same setting anymore? pls Paulus respond to this kos

--- 帖子 #484 ---
This is from the first post by paulus, the SL is the asian low which happens to be the 0.00 line of the fib. If you minus 10 from it then its another rule and that means your sell entry point is your SL point kos

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Paulus, I think that is a great idea. I have been thinking of doing something similar. The smaller SL is very appealing. I was thinking of executing two trades... one being the original trade idea. The second trade... waiting for the pullback. I used your other idea of switching to the 5 minute chart and using the color osc indicator the other day and that seemed to work. The key is just figuring out how far it's going to move before pulling back to make a good entry.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
kosomolate , there is often more to a system than just the first post of a thread. here's where paulus clarifies his S/L. if the stop is 10 pips above the high for a short, then a S/L for a long would be 10 pips beneath the low.

When do you calculate the hi lo asian session? at 8 gmt when the tokyo session end or at 6 gmt when london session start?

--- 帖子 #488 ---
when london session starts.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Pierre, the London Session doesn't start at 06:00GMT mate. It starts at 07:00GMT, which is 08:00BST. As London is currently one hour ahead of GMT because of daylight savings. In October when British Summertime ends and the UK clocks are put back an hour, the London Session will commence at 08:00GMT. Regarding calculating hi/lo of Asian session have a look at my post #429 where I asked for confirmation whether I was marking the session correctly. You will see the Asian session is marked as 23:00-07:00BST (it is in BST because my Marketwatch time in MT4 is BST). The first candle outside of this range is 08:00BST (07:00GMT) which is the London opening as described above. So.. dependent upon the MT4 marketwatch time I would set the 'block' like this:- BST(GMT+1) - 23:00-07:00 GMT - 22:00-06:00 USA - EST - 18:00-02:00 CEST (Central European Summer Time) 00:00-08:00 It's the Summertime stuff which creates the confusion i think! Cheers LeafTrader

How did you manage to win on GBPJPY on Weds Paulus? I followed the system and it went long as the +10 was triggered, the price then reversed and got stopped out with a big loss. I assume you did not take the long trigger? Did anyone else go short on GBPJPY on Weds instead of long?

--- 帖子 #492 ---
GMT is always GMT. The only change is BST is +1hr (Summertime). In the winter GMT=BST. I see various positions on London opening and having looked on many sites and forums have come to the conclusion its 06:00 GMT. Only if someone were a trader, and I would want proof, would I now believe any different. Anyhow thats not really what I cam to post. See next post.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Steve - does this imply that this site is wrong by saying 07:00GMT = London Open ?? http://forex.timezoneconverter.com/i...?timezone=GMT; Cheers

--- 帖子 #494 ---
As I know there are a number of us who would prefer a narrower stop range I have been re-reading the DIBS thread. This is based on an inside bar ( IB) and trading after the London Open (dont ask) and with a price higher or lower that the London Open (again, don't ask :-) ). The stop is then at the other end of the IB. There isn't always an IB that you can trade but as it's another technique based on London Open (guess!) it may be worth adding to your arsenal of openings and will give a lower risk position. Its worth a thought/read. Regards Steve PS London Open is ...................wait for it :-)

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Gosh,, That didn't take long. I have an open mind to this and must admit I think 06:00 a bit early. On what authority do they have to say what time London Opens a sits a 24hr market. I have decided I will be asking my broker on Tuesday as I have just opened a new account Iin London. Wouldn't want to suggest anyone is wrong but it does seem that there are a number of views on what it is.

Below are the rules for my above post Steve ############################################### This is a continuation of the DIBS Method which was started at the No Free Lunch but all the coffee you can drink thread. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=56907 The bottom of the page is all of Peter's posts, thanks to doubletop. It is a must to read and study the above thread to be current with this thread. I would like to thank NowAndLater for putting this together. Opening time I think MPP sums it up nicely: 0600GMT is always 0600GMT. GMT and UTC never move all other times are +/- of GMT/UTC. ie london is currently GMT+1, your broker times are set to a GMT time and never change. BST, DST and EST change at differrent times so can be confusing. I believe PC uses 0600GMT at all times, this way he can set his charts up get used to where the 0600gmt open is and forget about the confusion of BST EST and so on. Peter: "I use 00:00 CST or 06:00 GMT as my open. Believe me, if you are off 1 hour due to Daylight Savings time it is not going to be a problem." NowAndLater's great post: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=679 Thanks ozziedave: The one constant in this equation is that 6:00 GMT never changes. The variables in the equation are your time zone, if you have daylight savings time and what your brokers time feed is. As I see it there are 3 possibilities for setting your start of day time. The one constant in this equation is that 6:00 GMT never changes. The variables in the equation are your time zone, if you have daylight savings time and what your brokers time feed is. As I see it there are 3 possibilities for setting your start of day time. 1. Just find out what time on your trading platform corresponds to 6:00 GMT and adjust your start of day time on your trading platfoorm to reflect 6:00GMT. 2. Change the start of day time based on the London open, which is currently GMT +1. The big money doesn't start trading until the open of the Euro session (currently GMT +2) and really kicks in when London (GMT +1) comes on line. Keep in mind you may always have to adjust your trading platfrom due to it's time feed. For example, some platforms are always set at GMT +2. 3. Find a broker with a time feed that is GMT = 00:00 such as Interbank. So 6:00 GMT will always be 6:00GMT on your trading platform. Then you only have to adjust the time you sit in front of your computer based on daylight savings time. Peter Crowns charts have a time feed of 00:00 CST/USA. When he wrote his posts 6:00GMT corresponded to 1:00CST/USA. So on his charts he would have had to adjust his start of day once per year to account for daylight savings time in the USA. The actual start of the 24 hour period on his charts (the time feed from his broker) never changes). The thing that changes is when he decides to start his trading day based on using 6:00GMT as the start of his day. I believe all of the options I have described will provide you with many chances to take quality DIBs trades. As PC himself said, if your an hour off due to daylight savings time it really won't matter that much. Let's face the fact that not everyone on this forum will choose the start of day time as 6:00GMT. What’s an I nside B ar (candle) ? A bar with a High that is lower than the previous bar’s High and a Low that is higher than the previous bar’s Low. A stricter definition for trading the DIBS Method is that an IB cannot exceed the bounds of the previous bar. Meaning that a top and/or bottom (High and/or Low) can be equal to the previous bar. (see bottom charts) IB on which hour? You can play an IB, be it at 5.00 GMT, 4.00 GMT, 3.00 GMT or even 2.00 GMT as long as it is off the Open of the Day, 6.00 GMT. Peter's charts show this. Where to put the buy and where to put the sell: First rule: We buy on a break of an IB if price is above the daily open and sell if it’s below. Where to put the buy and sell has no where been discussed in great detail. Put the buy/sell 1 pip outside the IB range and remember to add the spread. Example: IB range is high @ 1.5500 and low @ 1.5400. Buystop: 1.5501 + spread, SL 1.5399, BE 1.5603 + spread. Sellstop: 1.5399, SL 1.5501 + spread, BE 1.5297. (chart to follow) Should we not take the high/low of bar prior to IB for our breakout range? This is not by PC’s rules, if you feel that this is what suits you, then go ahead. What is the TP? Or the FTT (Free Trade Target) We are looking to exit half of our position at 1:1, which means that once you’re up the amount of pips which equals the amount of pips you’re risking (IB-range + 2 (1 up and 1 down for the breakout) + spread) then you close half you position. This is your FTT (Free Trade Target) If after this price comes back and takes you out, you haven’t lost anything. Do not move the SL on the remaining 1/2. Variations: close 2/3 after 1:1 this will bank some profits. Or you could close 2/3 after gaining half the risked pips, this will give a free ride sooner, but if you price runs away in positive direction then this will win you less but when you have a doubt about a DIBS or see that there are technical levels that are too close then this may be the approach. PC closes half after 1:1 and I suggest you do it too. There are different ways to trail the stop on the winning remainder. I would move my stop to new support/resistance areas but there are other ways to do it. What if an IB has it’s high above the daily open and it’s low below the daily open? Then you take the break that occurs, if it breaks to the downside then sell and vice versa. 2, 3 or more IB’s in a row – which one to take? I would take the first one which is the largest just to be on the safe side. How to avoid losses? If you look to ask this question then you’ll have to start all over again! Read PC’s posts. Peter Crowns: "buying breakouts of inside hourly bars if the prices are "up" on the day, and selling downside breakouts of inside hourly bars if the prices are "down" on the day. These types of trades are simple, low-risk and potentially high reward. The only problem is you do have to be conscious when they happen so you can take the trade!" "What I like about these simple trades is the tendency to be able to cover your risk quickly by exiting half of your position at 1:1, allowing you to hold the remaining position with the initial stop (the other side of the inside bar) as a virtual "free trade". "I've found 'elegantly simple' in trading is best." "Simple works in the markets, because they are very simple. Most traders complicate things incredibly. Because their minds probably can't handle the truth yet that the markets basically feed where the orders are." "Win rate is not the most important factor in finding a good trading method. Profit potential/risk is." "the best trades for us are the ones that don't give you ANY retracement after the breakout" "The trade is simple and perverse at the same time. It also gives some of the best risk/reward trades possible and always ensures that you are with the daily trend. If you are also in tune with the weekly and monthly trends is when it gets exciting!" The DIBS method is one of the surest "unknown" methods available for making money in Forex. I wish I had invented it. Having traded the concept personally for more than 15 years, I know how good and also how irritating it can be. As you mentioned, trading during the active hours is key to the best trades. It is hard to beat the combination of low risk and high probability. Yet it stays in obscurity, which is the way of all good methods."

I also went long. I happened to be watching the chart when the big drop occurred at the 0300 GMT candle. I believe it had something to do with the GBP news announcement at that time but I could be wrong. In checking the FF news chart for that day there was a RED flag next to the GBP news at 03:30 GMT. I should have checked for news announcements before I placed my trade. Anyway... after I was stopped out for a big loss I switched the chart to a 5 minute chart and using the colored stoch indicator I waited for the retracement. So when I saw the price going back up I opened a new long trade and recovered my loss. I don't recommend anyone doing this as it could easily turn back the other way. But I figured with that big a drop that quickly it had to retrace some. I love this system!

LOL! - You're not mistaken at all Steve... Sorry! - I meant Thursday! Paulus still reports a 'win' - sadly I didn't share in that win.. it was a fat loss for me, so some deviation to the system was implemented by Paulus on 21/05

Hi all Sorry for this I didnt mean to mislead any one its some thing I dont do I have 2-3 systems running right now,I missed the 1st entry due to doing to many things at once so took the 2nd break. This was not a system trade and should of been recored as a system loss rather than a win for me. I do apologize and please dont see it as a way of me fudging the results. If you look at all my threads and posts I try to be as honest as possible Thanks for highlighting it and being curtious in the way you dealt with it Paulus ps..in the manual he draws a line half way between the high and low and uses that level as his aggressive stop and would give you slighly more than 1:1 RR

--- 帖子 #502 ---
London session start at 7 GMT then you put 6 GMT (means 6h 59 m in an 1 hour chart) for the end of asian session

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Steve, if you consider London Start at 6 GMT as Peter Crown says, then you end Asian Session at 5 h 59 m GMT and you put 5 GMT in an hourly chart

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Hi Paulus ! thanks for this wonderful work, its been working for me what do you think about the aggressive stop? do you think that would save us some loss or do you think it would stop us out prematurely from what would have been a good trade. In other words how do you do it, aggressively or conservatively ? bearing in mind this chart eg that you posted thanks for the expected answer kos

--- 帖子 #505 ---
The best way to find out is to spend sometime and going back through the charts to see what would have happened. Then you would know the outcome. Time must be invested to gain knowledge. GL to you, AZ

Yes I am still trading this system, and so far it has brought me real profit without taking it back in one fast swoop. I set it in the morning from my laptop and I go to work and monitor the trades from my sprint phone. since 1st of may till now it has generated for me 1180 green, sweet and hassle-free PIPS, in three weeks, if you want results I 'll send them. thanks Paulus

Hi AZ-Heat I trade it on the following 6 pairs: GBPUSD/ GBPJPY/ GBPCHF/ EURUSD/ EURJPY/ EURGBP Here are the results of todays trades as they were taken: closed @ fib level 161.8 EU +38 EJ +45 GY +10 closed GC +68 closed @ fib level 200 GU +60 EG +53 TOTAL = 274 pips Done for today kos

--- 帖子 #517 ---
hi all.... And what was the reason you closed your GY trade for +10 pips....thats nowhere near 1.618 fib....?

--- 帖子 #518 ---
hey, a little question, what timeframe do you use as the asian session?

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Hi all... The timeframe used for the Asian session should make no difference....as the Block is determined based on time.. Unless you mean ...time in GMT... so in my case its 22 - 6 GMT

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Hey Kosomolate, Thanks for the info. Looked like a couple pairs came close to stopping out and then reversed to close in the green. Seems that some just made it to 161% target by a few pips and the combined draw down could have had me worried. I did a little back checking and found that on some weeks there were some losses of 300-400 pips on a single pair but have not fully back tested all. Glad to see you are having a good run. AZ

--- 帖子 #523 ---
This is the second time I am asking the same question here. "The risk to reward with this system is lesser than 1:1. So what kind of money management are you guys using? " Can somebody who is using this system share their views on this... Cheers D

--- 帖子 #524 ---
I still believe that the stop is placed on the other side of the Asia range +10. If I am wrong, someone please correct me. AZ

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Hey AZ Buy entry point is Asian high +10 pips while sell entry point is Asian low -10 Buy SL is Asian low and Sell SL is Asian high. see pix for clarification Hi Deedeed! the R:R is slightly not 1:1 and the reason is this, sometimes if it reverses back either north or south to the SL, cos of the extra 10 pips at that side then it always adds that 10 extra pips to the loss on its way back, so the difference between reward and risk is 10 pips kos However, this does not remove from the fact that the system is simply good at least for now.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
the fact that you're still using the wrong SL boggles my mind.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
pls datugman read my post very well and point me to the right SL, I cant say, the rules may have changed. thanks kos

--- 帖子 #528 ---
As far as i understand the SL has to be at 50% of Asian HI and Low

--- 帖子 #529 ---
pls serj1 can you point me to the post where paulus changed the rules? cos I have been using the low and high for the SL and you cant believe it I still get good result E.G. EURUSD would have been a loser for me today but the SL at the asian high saved me and I TP at 161.8 fib level with +38 green pips and if I had left it, it went full to 200 fib level later. GBPUSD too would have been another looser but the stop at the asian low saved it and I TP at 200 fib level +60 green pips thats almost -100 pips loss but I ended well today. I think I would allow price to breath well may be that would maximise profit for me, who knows thanks kos

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Hey kos, I think you have it right. I believe it was mentioned somewhere as an alternative to use the 50% level as a stop to minimize loss. I started to use the 50% idea but changed back after my stop was almost was taken out a few days ago. So I say... if it's working for you don't mess with it! Tony

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Hi tony, thats what i think, and with the way price oscillates forth and back these days its better to allow it some space. so that one would not just be stopped out and then price would come back and continue in the direction of your trade that is somehow painful but on the alternative if one is stopped out at the low or the high then 10 pips later it enters the opposite trade and if it goes well it fills the loss back thats my own thinking and for this May it is working I dont know of July yet. thanks kos

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Sorry Kos got mixed with other system.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
hi all.... Do I assume most got stopped out at some level on GY ...unless you were awake and exited late in the day for a small profit.. The problem with trading so many pairs that are related....mostly GBP or EUR...is that the drawdown could be substantial....before the price does/if turn around....

I have found this thread quite interesting, and have done some backtesting(mostly on gbp/jpy, I like the risky one). I would like to mention a little quirk I think could help. Instead of doing the whole Asian session, I find that the asian session -1 hour(frankfurt open) works a little better. That seems to be when the beginning of some of the breakouts begin. That means sessions that aren't so wide. making for easier profits. Let me know your thoughts.

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Hi Saltydoo, Are you saying only the frankfurt or include the frankfurt with the asain session? Sorry but I don't quite understand what you are meaning? Tony

--- 帖子 #537 ---
I think he means place your orders as soon as Frankfurt opens.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
I did that when I was doing demo on the system for about 2 weeks, but what I discovered was that the 1hr frankfurt open bar b4 UK open used to cause false breakout many times i.e. many times it will go trigger one side and as soon as the UK opens the UK open bar will head the other direction, bcos it is driven by GBP fundamental news, and when I included it in the box with the Asian which makes them 9 bars, the fakeouts reduced thats my simple observation anyway kos

--- 帖子 #546 ---
I have been following the thread for sometime and looking to see how I can trade it. Everyone has their own comfort levels. Just a simple question that has started to bug me. What relevance has the asion market got to the trading range for London and USA? My observations are that when London opens it can sometimes tick above or below the Asion range and then reverse. As there is also a lLondon breakout system I have looked at that also and it seems if youtake the first 30 mins/1hr of that and apply the same principles as promoted here you get a similar result only with less possible downside. As always I don't wish to push a thread in a different direction just adding my observations to those who may find them of interest. For the record I have asked my broker what time London really start and he replied 08:00 BST. I can't remeber how that stacks up against previous comments on this and as always I use my own research anyhow. Regards Steve

--- 帖子 #547 ---
On the London breakout I have been observing 5 min charts and found that using a MACD as a filter greatly reduces the occasional spikes. I don't know if this could help on the Asian breakout, someone might like to look at it.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
MCfly, I trade GBPUSD/GBPJPY/EURGBP/GBPCHF on a M15 TF. I put a buy stop on the high, a sell stop on the low (both with a buffer of 10 pips+spread). I set these orders to expire on the same day, some 6 hours before the close of the day. In case you get stopped out on one side, it happens to take some of the loss back by entering the opposite direction. It happens often that you take profit on one side, then see a reverse and take profit on the other side. I set my Tp target at a fixed 15 pips*4pairs*0.5 lots, that pays me a decent meal most of the time. Succes, Ludo

Hi, Hving started with this thread which I found very useful I have been experimenting with the London opening. Results are very similar in terms of trades and I am using slightly more pairs and slightly stricter entry conditions to eliminate spikes . The big difference though is that the maximum loss/profit is potentially smaller and at present I am looking at exit strategies which are the most important anyway. My experience over the last few years is that its easy to get in, VERY difficult to get out at the best time. (without being greedy) "Everything that can happen will happen, eventually"

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Indeed Steve...The exit is the problem I am facing right now with the trading the fractal breakout of the London session. Some may disagree, however I strongly feel it is the exit that makes or breaks a trade and not the entry. My problem is not letting the winners run long enough.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
hi all... The exit is why some use more than 1lot.....so as to take profit on the first target being reached...and then set BE on the second and let it run...but then you face the problem if the trade goes against you at the very start...your losing on 2 lots but again I guess you could stagger the stop levels Leomeister.....surprising enough..I was just looking through the widgets...lol.....maybe a handy clock but I prefer the small size of the 1 I am using....stays on the screen no matter what I am doing......some of those widgets look very good...

Yes, I always close half the trade after 25 pips and let the rest run after moving the stop above BE with a 15 pip TS. This one was good for just over 110 pips

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Hi all.. Ok Kosomolate you lost me with your last post....trading this method on 1hr, 30min OR 15mins should make no difference at all.... The Range should be exactly the same as the 1hr TF thus so should the targets....unless your taking only 15mins of the last hour bar..which at that time maybe the price has not move as far...but if you do this your changing the Asian time by about 45mins....thus possibly getting in earlier.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Hi all.. It seems that the buffer is about right, I have it set to....10pips + Spread cant remember what is used here but its the same or similar. It looks ok on these 4 different pairs..

--- 帖子 #571 ---
This is something I have been working on with but it uses the FIRST candle at 00:00 which is 9am Japan time. The idea I have been working on takes the break of the high or the low by the 3EMA after the ADX crosses, once a substantial trend has finished. I confirm the break with the 13 CCI. It is interesting but I have only tried it on GBP/JPY.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Can anyone spot a loser on the H1? Buggered if I can.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
Hi all... without watching it live....its hard to tell. The first chart you show ...looking at the short.....where would be the entry....the 3ema does not cross by much and as it is based on the close which is a long way down the bar...how far would that bar have moved before it crossed.......not sure...

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Yes that was a rather tight entry and was probably not worth taking, may be a bit early in the day. I am currently trying to work out the best time of day where the big moves are.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
hi all.... The problem is that most of the moves tend to be data release based to some degree.....as you notice that when there is no releases the market is fairly quiet....

--- 帖子 #576 ---
I think this can safely catch the major moves without having to stare at the screen all day. Will start testing tomorrow morning. Started a new thread called T130B for this system so as not to clutter up Paulus's thread. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=172253

hi kos I know your question is directed at paulus, but let me just point you straight to the answer. go and read page 35 post # 525 of this thread, you'll see the answer in graphics there. kos

--- 帖子 #581 ---
which pairs are you trading. it seems that the most profitable pair is EU

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Having traded this strategy for several weeks now I'm now using the GBPUSD and GBPJPY as they seem the most dependable. I don't use EURJPY as for me, it's moves seem more erratic and tend to give more 'head fakes' with a reversal that result in entries, and then a loss at the SL. I'm using Paulus' suggested CL at 1.618, but for half the lots, with a move of the stop loss to BE for remaining lots. These run till end of day and close at 00:00. Because GBPUSD has been the most dependable for me, with fewer reversals and SL losses, I weight my total traded lots towards it. For example; Open with .8 GBPUSD and .4 lots GBPJPY. Close half (.4 and .2) if/when price hits 1.618 level. Move the SL on remaining lots to BE level of entry, and let the .4 GBPUSD, and .2 GBPJPY, run till end of day. Close all at 00:00. LeoM

Initially I traded GU/ GJ/ GC/ EG/ EU/ EJ from 1st to 29th of May, and I printed the trade history for this period and analyse all the trades pair by pair. I found out that half of what was won for that month was from GU so I agree with LeoM that GU is dependable, but I cannot say the same of GY bcos most of the losses were from GY and EJ they use to be very big losses that sometimes wipe the good effort of the other pairs EG and GC have the most won trades but they are always very small but consistent, this may be due to the big spread of 7 on each of them. My dilema now is that I just want to trade two of them all, but I dont really know which one to add alongside with great GU if paulus is still in this thread, pls respond thanks kos

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Based on my experience, we just need to trade GU, with bigger lots The second pair is really not necessary By the way, how about your win rate

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Hi I trade GBPUSD GBPJPY EURJPY I take the lot off at the 161.8 % fib level We have some draw downs of course my SL is the 50% line as per the chart Ive also had good success with the US break out using 3 spots also I will post that soon its very similar to another thread running cheers paulus

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Hy Paulus, Welcome back ! As I sow in your posts, you are using a box (representing the Asia session) with 9 candles. I have search on this site - http://forex.timezoneconverter.com/i...=GMT&amp;refresh=5 and they are saying that the Asia session begin at 23:00 GMT and it end at 07:00 GMT - so here are 8 candles. But I sow that you have in thet coloured box the candle from 22:00 GMT ? So can you please tell me , in GMT terms , wich are the the limits for this "box" ? Thx verry much !

--- 帖子 #587 ---
hey FX your right I sawped my charts over from MIG to Alpari didnt think the server time would be different On my setting I now have GMT shift 0 start 0 End 7 Thanks for pointing that out my MIG MT4 got corrupted and just an age to open then crashed so swapped over ..I will keep these times see how it goes Cheers Paulus

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Hi Paulus! yesterday and today would have been very successful days with this modification, and with this settings: - the loss would be minimal - if eventually it whipsaws then it would take one way - if one side triggers and goes the other way then it would be a BE as I have it today on GC and EG I am going to stay with this system for a long while thanks Paulus kos

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Hi just to say that I have been reading this thread with interest over the last two weeks or so, and last week started to trade based on applying (what I think is) this strategy. My results are mixed but that's because: 1) I've been targeting sometimes 161.8, sometimes 181% fib level for profit; 2) I've had my stop loss at 0% fib level (Not 50%) 3) I've been setting up my orders at 9:01 London time (or 8:01 GMT, as London is currently on DST which is GMT +1). This is what I thought was the end of the asian session, but it seems that I should've been placing the orders at 7:01 GMT (8:01 London time). Is this correct?? As I said the results are mixed, but still positive. GU, GY and EY are my fx pairs of choice. I think a little refinement of my strategy (and an adjustment to the the time I get the kids ready for school!) will ensure my results are much more consistent. A great strategy nonetheless. Thanks Paulus and others who have given me a positive inroad into the world of FX. Look forward to the US breakout thread to add to my FX trading arsenal...

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Hi all! are we still there and trading this system? well, as for me I am still doing it and I must confess it is a beautiful week for me. particularly today is very good, I did it with the new setting of 1.618 level as the TP level, and the mid level as the SLs, it paid off well as the non-farm pushed them home. EU +25 up and +25 down EG +31 pips EJ +42 pips GU +76 and +10 down GC +75 pips GY +76 pips Total pips for today = 360 green pips on 6 pairs I dont know if anyone experienced what I saw today shortly before the NFP my buy stop order for EJ was removed by the broker. I dont know why. If any one can explain that I will appreciate it. if not that EJ would have made the 2 sides. overall, the week is very good and today is excellent paulus you are great kos

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Started reading this thread yesterday from the very beginning. GMT and UTC are EXACTLY the same and NEVER.......NEVER change in the world. London does change depending on the time of the year.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
I agree Paulus is great. I think I will, like you Kos, adopt the 161.8 TP and 50% SL as that will reduce the pips at risk and hence improve risk/reward to much closer to 1.0 (after covering bid/offer spread and the 10pip adjustment for false breakouts). I too placed an EJ order today (actually an OCO order) and my trade worked as planned, but I did notice and ridiculously large spike in the 2:35pm London Time 5 min candle, where the open/close/high were the same (137.61) but the low was 128. 38 - some 920pips lower!! Maybe it had something to do with my spread betting broker, but could be the reason for your issue. Just a thought.

--- 帖子 #595 ---
hi first thanks to paulus the simple idea of this system is beautiful i read the whole thread yesterday and while reading trialed the g/u and like kos took all profit at nfp spike (live as i beleive that testing the tested is just wasting valuable pips to the demo collector live makes you think harder) looks like there is lots of pips to be made question have you found it better changing the SL to 50% has the win loss picture changed maybe even the no of pips gained increased or still aprox the same (retorical ) is it just better on mind will be trading this with g/u and g/y taking all profit at 168 fib un decided fuly on stop loss can any one answer thi puzzle

--- 帖子 #596 ---
WHAUW.....11 hrs later and I finally made it to the end of this thread. Now getting it all functioning on my charts and in my head, lol. Paulus, hope you had a SUPER vacation, mate !!!

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Maybe Im just being greedy, but can anyone tell me if I'm being too conservative with the placing of my entry and SL? I'm really talking about spreads of course, because for the long order, having 1. a (Long) entry level which is 100% fib plus bid/offfer spd plus 10bp; 2. a SL (for the long order) of 50% fib less 10bp; and 3. a TP of 168.% fib means I'm typically having reward:risk ratios of about 60%, but sometimes it's less than 50%. At face value trading on a RR ratio of less than 1:2 doesn't make sense to me as even a hit rate of 2 wins out of 3 means you will lose money (assuming all trades carry equal weight). Part of me wants to filter out those fx pairs that result in a RR of less than 50%. Any thoughts guys? Many thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Hi mate, you are thinking right, that setting is optimal cos the risk reward is beautiful. as for the EJ been deleted, it is still ridiculous to me. It would have been a very successful trade, anyway na dem know kos

Can't some one make an ea for this? or has someone? I want to try this but the end of Asian time is 4am for me. Waking up in the middle of the night is difficult for my work life. Gary

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Hi all... This system is still working good... About an EA.....well I usually only trade maybe 1 pair a day...sometimes 2. But I watch 4 pairs and decide which ones to enter.. Like today...Jpy was doing nothing ( so far).. Eur/Gbp was moving down due to Eur..not Gbp...So that ment for me to stay out of Gbp/Jpy.. So the Best choice was Eur.....trying to pick the target pair is better than just trading blind and taking a loss (maybe) on 1 or more pairs....for me anyway... So the way I am using this method ...an EA would be useless...

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Hi Gary, I found this EA for the Asian breakout and have tested it. It does work but the only problem I see with it now is that with the new hedging rules it may not work. But there is a way you can make it work. It sets a buy stop at the High and sell stop at Low end of the specified time you set in the EA. With my broker ( Forex.com ) they do not allow even pending opposite orders. But in the EA you can set it to only execute only long or short positions. So if you guess correctly you are in luck! It also allows the 5 or 10 pip buffer or whatever you set. Anyway... like always... test it out on demo. Hope this helps and is useful. Tony

Hi FX yes use it every day its holding up P

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Hi Paulus.. Great thread This sytem shurly works, but I've been considering other Entry, TP and SL and here it goes... just please let me know what ya think about it.. GBP/USD Entry: 11pips higher or lower of Tokio session (same like in Paulus strategy), although this is still Paulus strategy just modifed a little bit.. Target +61,8 Fib | + or - 11pips depends if it's long or short SL - 61,8 Fib |+ or -spread so we've got here risk reward ratio on 1:1 level (not exacly very close) between 11th-12May on GBP/USD there was sth like 27 signals like that and only 5 positions hits SL, rest goes to 61,8 Fib and hits TP although my idea starts here.../ GBP/USD Traded only.. open an account just for this pair. deposit - 500USD / Lots 0,1 (1 pips - 1 $) average SL is 30-80pips (as well as Tp, ) Max open positions - 1 I'm trading this way since last monday Rule of 1 trade a day is still valid so far all 5 signals hit TP in this week. and it gave 233pips, which is almost 50% of my initial transfer(500 USD). Thanks a lot Paulus, once again great thread and have pips people

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Hy alien ! Nice to see your way to trade Paulus system. Just want to ask you, your entry is only 11 pips from high/low of Asia sesion, or you put the spreed to ? I think a chart would be nice to see too Thx for your time ! Have a nice weekend

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Hi! Alien, I have been trading it on live account since May 1st till today on six pairs and it has not disappointed me at all. This new idea, can you put a chart up so that we can understand it? cos there was this modification of putting the SL in the middle of the Asian H/L and TP @ 1.618 which I tried for a week and it was getting me out of market untimely by taking the SL and still go the trade's direction. I reverted back to the default way of doing it and things became normal again. So we are a group of six traders doing it together everyday as it is in the first post and it is working brilliantly. thanks Paulus p.s. post your chart let us see what that your idea is

--- 帖子 #622 ---
here are some good example ... FX_N00b/ Entry is 11 pips from HI/LOw Asian session + spread or 12-13 from HI/LOW and don't care about the spread Idea is to trade this way on 500 USD account on mini Lots and double the Lot size when you earn 100% like on my previous post , I've earned almost 50% in one week only on GBP/USD

The last week has gone well. I'm comparing two alternate close options but just trading the GBPUSD. One option is to close all trades at +.618, the second is to close 1/2 lots at +.618, and close second half of the lots at the end of day price about 22:00. I'm using the Trade manager expert I posted earlier in the thread. The return has been amazing but I'm sure unrealistic as there will be occasional losses with a close at the SL level. The screenshot below is the combined return this week. The account manager indicator is available through the Elite section at TSD-FX forum. I've been trying to locate a breakout expert to run this strategy and did find a half dozen on several forums. Unfortunately, most don't seem to place trades. My guess is the new five digit data feed is confusing the coding. I've asked a couple of the programmers if they'd like to customize their expert to fit the Fibonacci level close feature used by Paulus. So far no response. A similar strategy has been tested before with an expert created called 'Asian High Asian Low'. See the thread at Forex-TSD . It uses the same Asian session range for a breakout, but uses smaller TP levels. There have been many breakout strategies tested over the last few years including such famous ones as the Hans 123. Their success wavered a year or so ago when many currency markets were less volatile with shorter trends. IMHO the recent global financial crisis will probably provide us plenty of volatility and big trends in to make this breakout method successful for awhile.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
On Thursday's chart you can see what I think is fairly common in Fibonacci movements, after the Asian session range. I can see two positive options for best TP and SL levels for the GBPUSD. 1.) Enter trade at end of 8 bar GMT, buy stop at High + 10 pips + spread. (~+13p for Buy Stop, -10p for Sell Stop) SL at 23.6% of Asian range. TP on 1/2 lots at +.618 (161.8%), move SL from 23.6% to BE. TP on 1/2 at +1.618 (261.8%) , or End-of-Day 22:00. 2.) Enter trade at end of 8 bar GMT, buy stop at High + 10 pips + spread (~+13p for Buy Stop, -10p for Sell Stop). SL at 23.6% of Asian range. TP on 1/2 lots at +.5 (150%), keep SL at 23.6% At +.618 (161.%) move last 1/2 lots to BE. TP on last 1/2 at +1.618 (261.8%) , or End-of-Day 22:00. These settings would just be for the GBPUSD. As everyone knows, the personality is quite different between the various GBP pairs. Some pairs like EURJPY and GBPJPY can bounce around and reverse on a breakout entrance. On these it would be interesting to try a close all at +.50 and leave both the buy and sell stop in play. This could catch the short spikes that often move both above and below the Asian session range.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
I took a lot of time to look as far back February day by day checking with the SL @ high and low of Asian time which was the original rule by Paulus. and I again check back same period using the mid point of Asian session as SL My findings are that it is better with the original H/L as SL at the long run more than using any point within the Asian H/L cos it easily SL and go that direction if we use the H/L as SL the trades that TP are more than the ones that SL and a few BE And since then I have been doing it that way and its been well with my account Mate you can check and confirm this kos

Can't someone make an EA for this system. I have a hard time getting up at 4am in the morning to set my trades.

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Thx for the charts !

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Hi, I always like the idea of reducing losses and if your idea of 23.6% works then I'm all for it. However aren't the fib levels based on previous movememnt rather than opening ranges. As always we can use what we like and I would never put any ther idea down. Just looking for some thoughts here. I have been away for 2 weeks and I took "The Logical Trader" book with me by Mark Fisher. I had read this before and discounted a lot of what was in there probably due to inexperience as I have had it a long time. However, his book is all about opening ranges so this timeround it was very interesting. A good technique which I am going to add to my EA will be the "Sushi Roll" technique of taking out the previous hi and lo before entering/confirming a trade as I notice we get a swing often before a breakout. I will see how it goes. Regards Steve

--- 帖子 #630 ---
hello alien, may i know what is ur time range of your asia session? Thank you

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Steve you're right that the fib analysis is usually drawn from a fractal pivot hi-low, or low-hi. Maybe its that with eight bars in the session these are usually both included ? On the chart example I posted for last Thursdays GBPUSD, the session low on the hammer(hanging man) bar is slightly lower than the true fractal low three bars before it. But close enough to give the range for a fairly accurate fib measurement. If the 23% is a safe SL level it would most accurately be drawn from the true fractal low to hi even if that means including a a couple bars before our Asian session begins. I'll watch for that this week.

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Hi Leomeister, No problem. This is the most interesting &amp; taxing area of trading when to get out with maximum profit/minimum loss. As I noted earlier I am looking at the Sushi Roll as per Fishers book as a potential area for exiting. It basically looks (for a short trade) at taking out a high then a low over 10bars (last 5 versus previous5) and then closing to the low side. This can be reversed for stops/exits as it gives an indication of possible stop running before reversing. Its an interesting thought process but as yet I have no stats etc. Regards Steve

--- 帖子 #633 ---
hi everyone.. 1.sorry for this same stupid question,can u guys check my asian session hi and lo.should there be 8 candles or 9?i think my start of asian session is correct,but my end session should be 1 candle more or earlier. 2.the trading rules are: Entry : session High/Low + 10pip + spread for Buy/Sell SL : session Low/High for Buy/Sell or 23% or 50% of the asian session's high-low TP : 1.68 fib extension of asian session or 1.23 fib extension which of the sl and tp variant we can all agree with?

hello all, i have traded this system for a week now (demo) and it looks very good; simple... when a trade got triggered i canceled the other order for the pair. i only traded the majors.... the pound crosses have sl and tp far away. do you guys cancel the opposite trade when one is triggered and do you believe this works only with GBP pairs??? kind greets

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Sorry for the delay Bobcat. I was interested to test both. I think the Close All at + .618 and a SL at 0% is a nice conservative play. I believe Paulus is using it. I will continue to experiment by trading that method, and trying to better understand what the tightest SL can be. You probably noticed that on Monday the GBPUSD broke out south to a pip shy of -.5%, then reversed to jump up and hit the 76.8% SL . Nasty!! I thought, 'So much for my theory'. Then looked closer. I think the Asian session hi-lo works for a breakout most of the time because it encloses a fractal hi-lo pivot, plus has a big boost in volume. The break of the session hi-lo may provide a profit even though it's actually a late entry. The 23.6/76.8% retracement levels should be safe for a SL level after a breakout, but ONLY if the fibo retracement is measured from fractal pivot highs-lows. In using the Asian session high and low, SOMETIMES, this happens by chance. But sometimes the fibo high or low actually occurs before the Asian session began. Then just depending on the session range is inaccurate for using the fibo levels to measure dependable TP or Sl levels. I will monitor the fractal pivot highs and lows during the Asian session to see if they provide improved entrance levels and more accurate points from which to compute accurate Fibo TP and SL levels. To see the fractal pivots, drop the 'Fractal' MT4 indicator (in the regular indicator folder) on your chart and watch the Asian session. The little carrot shapes mark the fractal pivot highs and lows. These bars create breakout levels all day long. Watch them at the end of the Asian session for early breakout buys and sells. What's the benefit? On the last hour bar of the Asian session, price may breakout above or below a fractal-pivot high or lo, BEFORE the bar and the session ends. You can safely enter an emerging breakout at a better price than if you wait till the last session bar closes. Using this on Tuesday's GBPUSD gave me an entrance Buy 26 pips lower, than the breakout at the high of the session. Check it out. Now l don't have time to post an illustration chart. Will later. I plan to keep trading the standard method, but will compare the results of this variant to it. I'll be interested in others results.

hello onceaday traders, i have a short UJ trade still open with 25 pips profit, i have put sl at breakeven and wait and see if Tp will be hit..... do you exit the trade at london closing??? UJ trend looks down so it seems a waist to close the trade. please let me know if this and my previous questions are already anwsered i guess i have to read it all then. yes iam pretty lazy.... i guess a method like this atracts people like me. i hope all are doing very well

I have a few things that I need clearing up: 1) I am based in London. Am I placing the orders based on the hi/lo range that ends at 8:00 London time (currently GMT + 1) or 9:00 London time (currently GMT +2)? I believe the London Session opens at the former time and the Asian Session closes at the latter time. The one hour overlap has confused me. 2) I generally have been going for: entry - "hi" plus 10bp plus spread (Long trade) - "lo" less 10bp less spread (short) SL - 0.00% of range (i.e. "lo") less 10bp (long trade) - 100.0% of range (i.e. "hi") plus 10bp plus spread (short trade) Target - "hi" plus 61.8% of range (i.e. 161.8%) (long trade) "lo" less 61.8% of range (i.e. -61.8%) (short trade). Is the current wisdom that SL's should be at 61.8% away from entry? Sounds like it (to keep the risk reward closer to 1.0) but I'm not sure. I've been losing a bit of faith in my understanding of this as my results the past 10 days have been poor...answers to the above would be greatly appreciated to restore confidence. Paulus, Kos &amp; others...many thanks in advance guys.

hi traders, i need some help, cause the timedifferents is confusing me. i am located GMT +1 so here its 9.23am this means in londontime is 8.23am. the asia session is finished at 10.00am (GMT+1). do i have to wait till asia is closed for hi/lo, or do i take the candle with london open (9am)? thanks for the help, and sorry for my poor english....

--- 帖子 #655 ---
Just to clarify a few things. The last bar in the box must be 7 GMT.( For today that would have been the bar with a high of 1.6467 on GU). Trust me the 6 GMT will burn you. Do not try to enter late if it rockets of like today. Only aim for the 161.8 level. The GU is the most profitable. This is mega pips and stress free if you stick to the rules. The pips will follow you.

Hy guys ! I am folowing this system for a while and as I sow in Paulus posts he is falowing the bars from 23:00 till 06:00 (GMT). That means that we take in consideration 8 bars from the opening (23:00) till the close of the Asia Session (07:00). We should clear this things out couse thouse setings are verry important for this system. So Paulus if you are arround please help us with some details. Thx !

i asked earlier if you guys cancel the opposite trade when one is triggered. today i forgot to do this and my EU trade got stopped out both ways fast. i have not experienced TP both ways and price has to travel long to do this... maybe possible after extreme news..... i will cancel oppostite orders from now on.

--- 帖子 #667 ---
jpax i always set the buy order and sell order as oco (one cancels other), so only one order (buy or sell) is triggered. hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Well it looks like the Asian Session is 23:00 GMT to 8:00 GMT. Which means that, as a london based trader (and using london times), my range includes the 00:00 candle and the 8:00 candle (which finishes at 8:59:59). this makes sense to me and was how i was originally trading (successfully) until it was suggested that I was trading an hour too late each morning (and then my results were going pear-shaped). I'll stick with a TP of 161.8% (long), -61.8% (short). and I'll stick with the most conservative stop loss setting of 0% fib (long), 100% fib (short). lesson learned - if in doubt, stick with the original plan (especially if it was working)...

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Hi GeigerB What happens in a day like today if as soon as one trade triggers the other is canceled. GU triggered buy and went down to hit the SL and went further down, triggered the sell in the opposite and hit the TP thereby BE but the down side of that is what EU did today, by hitting the SL the two ways If the opposite sides have been canceled as one side triggers then the loss would have been big. What I do is this if on order hits SL I leave the opposite cos I know whatever pushes it that far should take it the other side before close of the day But once on order hits TP I canceled the opposite side that is what saved me today kos

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Hi kos mate. i'm confused again. i understand the end of the asian session would be 8:59 london time which would mean that the 08:00 (london) hourly candle (meaning the 7:00 GMT hourly candle) would be in the range/box. So a buy wouldn't be triggered today, as the high of 1.6467 would be part of the asian range. Only the sell order would've been triggered, based on my renewed understanding. so there would not be a "whipsaw" (ie both buy and sell orders triggered). Do you disagree with this? if so why? Kind regards

--- 帖子 #671 ---
hi all.... Oh this raises its head again....there is much arguement as to were to set the Block times...I think the idea was to catch the opening of the UK session which most people see as the close of the Asian session which is not quite right....from memory I think the Asian session goes about an hour into the UK session......so where to set you Block range....it just depends on your opinion and where you see it working the best for you.. Do you want to catch the opening of the UK session or would you rather wait an hour and start from the close of the Asian session...its up to you.. the thread starter uses the start of the UK session...but others use close of asian session..... The whipsaw can happen no matter what times you set your block to....

Hi All, Would someone be so kind as to provide the MT4 indicator visual for this strategy (yep, I'm too lazy to calculate these levels myself...but purely for back testing..). I downloaded a couple from the links section but nothing appeared on the chart. I got the box one though but would prefer the coloured one. Thanks Porkpie

--- 帖子 #675 ---
The Fractal indicator is located in the standard Indicators folder in MT4. My suggestions below are only intended to add to, and enhance the accuracy of the Asian period breakout method. I'm testing and wondering whether it's possible to use the fractal levels indicated during the Asian session a.) to provide hints as to the strength of the breakouts that occur during the London session, and, b.) to see if they can provide successful early breakouts during the last bar of the Asian session. Current conclusions are; 1.) Since the fractals mark zig-zag pivot extremes, I think they may be useful to indicate how much movement is left by the time a breakout is cued by the Asian session high or low. If a fractal level is also an Asian session high or low level, the breakout could have some strength and distance potential in it. If, however, there was a fractal breakout before price reaches one of the session high-low levels, then much of the movement could already be over. This could result in a trade entry with the whipsaw reversals we all hate and want to avoid. 2.) I wouldn't use a fractal breakout level during the first seven bars of the Asian period, but might consider taking an early entry if price crosses a fractal level during the last bar of the Asian session. Examples below.

--- 帖子 #676 ---
Attached is an example of my point #2 in the previous post. The possibility of using fractal pivot levels, generated during the Asian session, as early breakout levels for early trade entries during the last bar of the Asian session.

--- 帖子 #677 ---
I spent some time processing information on market hours, and the differing server times for three brokers I'm using. The following settings for the Asian session give me matching graphics defining the session for indicators like 'Tokyo' and the 'ant-GUBreakout_V.04 by Andee'. Alpari (UK) Begin 1, End 9 IBFX Begin 23 (or 0 if 23 not possible), End 7 FxPro Begin 2, End 10

--- 帖子 #678 ---
hi all... Leomeister....I have not looked to much at the fractal indicator ...but my understanding is that depending on the setting a number of bars need to have been completed before a high or low is printed.....so at what point do you know if the breakout is going to be a strong one or a weak one.....The way I see it ...using fractals the move has happened before any points are printed...it wont print on the current bar...am I right in this..

--- 帖子 #679 ---
The Fractal graphics don't repaint and only require a three bar combination to satisfy the definition and set the graphic. So the breakout of a fractal level would always occur on a fractal hi-lo set more than one bar back. The strength I was referring to is if price bars cross a fractal pivot 2-3 bars previous to finally crossing out of the Asian hi-lo extremes, then that impulse move may already be losing energy. If the breakout of the fractal level also corresponds to a session hi-lo level, then it seems likely the price movement has just started. Try them out. Watching their placement and price action, will explain better than I can. I'm just proposing a hypothesis. Might be wrong. But if right, it might help us avoid those whipsaw reversals that steal out profits.

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Hi all... Have you actually watched all this happen on the live charts...or only while the market is closed ( looking Back )... I dont think you will ever stop those whipsaws.....just the fact the time we are using for the breakouts is right around the UK open and thus plenty of data releases which most of the time cause those whips..

Hello Another great thread, i will try this method when forex open ... Petar, Serbia (Team)

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Leomeister your hours for the asian session are wrong!

--- 帖子 #686 ---
Hmmm. Its always possible. Please post a chart shot showing your preferred session times. The first place to start is determine the open and close times for markets in GMT. Would you agree with the chart? Next is to get an accurate fix on how many hours your broker's server is shifted, relative to GMT. Use the attached clock indie on your chart. Subtract the 'broker time' from the 'UTC_GMT'. For example if UTC-GMT is 06:00, and broker time is 09:00, then broker server is +3. You'll add this to the Asian session start and end times. If your Asian session is 00:00 - 09:00, that's nine hours, or nine hour bars. The session indicators vary a bit in how they define their start and end times. If they just read start and end, it likely means the time for the beginning of the bar. So 0 - 8 would be nine bars and start at midnight and the bar beginning at 8am would end at 9am. Some indicators will say start time, and end time, which for the same session the settings would be 0-9. Just count the bars displayed by your settings. For Asian session if the broker server time is 0 like IBFX, then the bar range is 0-8. If FxPro , the server is at +3, so settings would be 3-11.

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Newbie question I'm afraid Leo - What's a "fractal pivot" range, in the context of an Asian hi/lo range being encompassed by one? I don't use metatrader, so I cannot use the 'FRACTAL MT4 indicator' as you suggested in the above post. Thanks in advance...

--- 帖子 #688 ---
The fractals represent the high and low extremes, zig-zags, or pivot points in market movement. There are various definitions for them, but basically you'll see that turning point bars have a lower bar before, and after, if they are a high point, and a higher bar before, and after, if they mark a low point. The turning points are significant as they represent a temporary ebb and flow in the buying-selling. These price levels become support and resistance levels for future market movement. When they're broken the market moves..... In the first chart I posted above in #676, you can see that the high and low of the Asian session are marked by Fractal icons. On that day the high and low of the session corresponded to a fractal high low range. I think that had something to do with the strength of the movement when the breakout occurred. You might want to download a free demo of MT4 from a broker and just drop the Fractal indicator on a chart. You'll begin to understand as price zigs and zags and the extreme points are marked by the little fractal icon. I only mention the fractal indicator in this thread as it corresponds to and supports the high-low session levels that we use for session breakout levels. Don't let it confuse the basic trading strategy here which is trade the Asian session breakout, and take profits at +.5, or +.618 levels. If after losses, you can make 30 pips a day on a regular basis, you're on your way to trading success. Paulus' simple strategy offers that possibility.

--- 帖子 #689 ---
Top man Leo. Thanks very much for that. I agree that this strategy is a great way of getting a regular, positive trading return - I just need to keep disciplined in order to achieve the trading success that you refer to as possible. Im trading GJ, GU, EJ, and EU so as to determine a pattern on those four currencies as quickly as possible, using GE and UJ (i.e. which of the four currencies are strong, which are weak and which are middling). Invariably 2 of the 4 crosses provide the TP relatively early, and then it's a matter of managing manually the last two pairs to break-even or a possible profit (it would be unrealistic to expect all the 4 pairs to hit TP every time - giving the risk/reward ratio, it takes only one pair to hit SL to potentially BE or be down on the day). I'll bear in mind that if I can aggregate 30 pips from the 4 crosses daily (post active management of trades 3 &amp; 4 in particular), then I'll be in a really good zone, longer term. Thanks again. GeigerB

I have two questions Leome First, i am from Serbia and London ses opens at 9.00 that means that i sholud took a trade from 9am to 4pm ? And if i see breakbox 10 up from higher (buy), 10 lower then low price (sell) ? All the best, Petar ( Serbia team )

--- 帖子 #692 ---
Petar, Local times can be confusing so the critical period to determine is the beginning and end of the Asian session on your charts. This sets your session high and low breakout levels. These are 00:00 GMT - 09:00 GMT; nine, one hour bars. I find it best to keep all my time computations in GMT as it can get very confusing otherwise. As seen on the market chart I posted earlier, the Asian market ends at 09:00 GMT. But currently London time is one hour earlier, so if using London time, the Asian session ends at 10:00. If your local time is GMT +2 your local time may be 11:00 when the Asian session ends. The short answer would be you would begin to look for a breakout at 09:01 GMT ( = 10:01 London time). Paulus and others, suggest adding a 10 pip buffer beyond the session hi-lo for the buy/sell stop levels. I personally find that adding 13 pips on GBPUSD and GBPJPY helps me avoid spikes and whipsaw trades. As to how long to wait to take a breakout; I think different people here have different preferences as to how long into the trade day they will take a new breakout. Usually the breakout happens soon after the end of the Asian session, but on today's GBPUSD it was five hours before a sell breakout occurred. Even if you don't trade with MetaTrader it might help to have a visual aid provided by a demo. I'd suggest downloading a demo from IBFX as they use 0 GMT for their server which makes time computation easy. Then load the Breakout indicator attached below (&amp; posted elsewhere on the thread) and input the settings seen in the screen shot. These settings are accurate for any broker server that is 0 GMT. This should give you nine hour bars, with the session box starting and stopping at the correct times. I'd suggest also adding the PL4 clock indicator on your chart. In my setup I use an IBFX chart first, then visually match my other broker demo charts to it. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #695 ---
The correct period for me is 00:00 GMT and 7:00 GMT the begin London session. I work on 1 hour chart then I put 6:00 GMT

--- 帖子 #696 ---
It's a legitimate ongoing discussion as to which is most profit producing; to start trading at the beginning of the London session, or one hour later at the end of the Asian session. It would be beneficial to have a record kept of P/L for 0-6 GMT, versus 0-7 GMT, or 0-8 GMT. Paulus began the thread by using nine bars for the Asian session but opened it up for experimentation. Someday's its better to start looking for a breakout at 8, and on others you get whipsawed, and better to have waited till 9 GMT to begin. For example today on the GBPUSD, you were better off to include the 7-8 GMT bar in the session range. If you stopped the session at 08:00 GMT (eight bars), the lower breakout level would had you enter a sell position which was then stopped out for a loss on a reversal to the 0% level. IMO the bottom line is which session length produces the most pips. I don't know. I'll be interested in anyone's end of week comparison of P/L between the two session options. (7 bar vs. 8 bar vs. 9 bar, all beginning at 00:00 GMT). Part of the confusion about when the Asian session begins and ends is due to the fact that the Forex runs 24/5. So it doesn't necessarily follow exactly the hours for the stock or commodities market. Since we're primarily interested to jump on board rising volume for this breakout method, the attached chart showing Forex activity on the EURUSD might be more helpful than using the stock/commodities market times. If the major pairs follow the EURUSD, it would appear that the drop in overnight trading volume, begins to pick up beginning on the 6 hour GMT bar. The black numbers are EST, New York time. In the end, comparing the trading records of P/L, will tell us which are the optimal session times, and length.

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Hi wltam, Yes they are. My antGUbreakout_v4 time is set to start 00:00 to end 08:00 this covers 9 bars. I am in GMT+1 zone it should be 00:00 to 07:00 which is 8 bars, but I realise that Asian and UK overlap with 1 HR It depends on each trader some people may decide to put the 1 HR in Asian time like me while others may want to include it with the UK session its a matter of choice What informs my including it within the box is that after the analysis of the trades for 6 weeks, I realized that most of the time the candle of the overlapping 1 HR used to cause fakeout because of euro belt news before UK define their direction. And the false breakouts have reduced since then Hope I am informative in this explanation and I will not start the long argument of Asian open and close and UK open etc... kos

--- 帖子 #715 ---
Thank you, Koso Of course i not argue with you about the asian session I started to trade with 3 pairs only but i use in different time range for "asian session" for EU and GU i use 2200 to 0600 GMT(9 bars also) while EG use 2300 to 0700 GMT (9bars also) (seem as yours) Thank again~

--- 帖子 #716 ---
The difference of time settings will make this system either a "London Rush" or a daily trend system, right? Setting the time at 0 to 7 GMT will make use of the London break-out, and setting it at 0 to 9 GMT will make use of the daily trend after the London open. I'm not quite sure which of these to strategies that was the original one? It would be nice to hear any input regarding the system approach, and thoughts about avoiding or making use of the London open. I think that this system will be more profitable if one sets the end of the box just before the open, but I might be wrong.

--- 帖子 #722 ---
I'm fairly new to forex and over the past few days I have read every post on this thread (including all the time differnce posts!) and I would like to say thanks to everyone (especially Paulus) for what seems to be a great system. I have only been demo trading this for the past couple of days and has worked great for GBPJPY. I have also been looking at what can possible done to minimise the potential large losses on some (few) days. Going back through the GBPJPY over the last month, I think I have a fairly simple solution (would like someone to verify it and possibly with other pairs). If you take your range as the 8 bars (0:00 - 07:00 GMT) and then ignore/don't trade the 08:00 bar (as this is generally the one that gives the false break and causes the losses) you will find it generally retraces back into the range and you can then trade any subsequent breakout from the 09:00 onwards. Also, I know it's tweeking it a bit from the original (and again I have been looking at only the GBPJPY), but trading half at the 1.50 fib line seems to stop a few more losses also (the RR dependant people might not like that though). Quickly looking back through the last month of data using these parameters I can only find two days where the stop loss is hit. My thanks again to Paulus and everyone whose contributed.

hi thanks for e fast reply. care to tell me what is ur tp and sl for both? anyway you have any idea about the entry, should it be 10+spread for long or 10- spread? and anyway this strategy does not have a 1:1 R:R right? for example this GJ trade my risk is 188 pips, tp is 100 pips. if i risk 2% of my account, i only gain a 1+%.. hmm

--- 帖子 #736 ---
Yeah the R:R is always less than 1:1 for each individual trade. But this system for GU and GJ seems to have a considerably larger number of good days than bad. Anyway, the GJ levels I had for today were: 152.160 to 150.435 (range) entry point was 150.290, SL was set initially to 152.305 and then moved to 150.290 after price reached the 1.618 fib point and closed 50% of the position.

hmmm, what's the tp for the other 50%? I realised i did draw wrongly for the TP , my redraw put it to 158.55

--- 帖子 #739 ---
TP for the second level is usually the 2.00 fib level, but some people like to let it run to see if the direction carries on. Could use a trailing stop strategy in this case.

Is anyone using an ea for this system. I saw one in this forum but do not see much discussion about whether it is working.

--- 帖子 #742 ---
We should not have the hedging problem if you switch you forex.com US to Forex.com UK. They actually emailed me and offered. All I had to do is fax an approval. Are you using this EA? It looks great... I'm guessing 30min time frame, but with know who wrote it I am just guessing. Gator-Trader

Hello fellow traders...the system overall looks pretty good. I am a veteran trader for 5 years now and I trade something similar to this. I have a couple of suggestions that I use on my system. First, on a mechanical system like this if you trade with a 1:1 ratio you will see good results at first but will ultimately end up giving it all back at some point. Whether you risk 20 to make 20 or 100 to make 100. Either way you will have to win at least 50% of the time to just break even let alone make a profit. Lets face it, the best traders in the world average between 50 to 60 percent. The way I trade my breakout system which is almost identical to this is keep the same entry rules and same tp level but set your SL to a fixed 25 to 30 pips. Once you are up 30 to 40 pips in profit then move your SL from 30 to 15. This way if the market continues in your profit direction then no harm. But, if it reverses on you then you will only get stopped out with 15 to 30 pips instead of 100 or so. If you get stopped out then immediately place you original entry back in with the same tp and sl levels. This way if the market comes back down then it will usually continue but if it doesn't come back to you entry then you only lost 15 pips instead of 100. Even if it comes back to enter you back in the market and reverses again and you lose 2 trades, you are still risking less pips then before. You can keep all the other rules the same. By doing this you now have around a 3:1 risk and sometimes 4:1 and you only need to win around a 25% to 30% of your trades to b/e instead of 50%. By doing this you will see your account grow faster then you ever have before. I make around 1500 net pips per month off this strategy alone. Plus, if you are risking 5% of your account, you can now use more money than with a 100 sl or 60 or what ever the trade calls for. Lets say for example that you have 1000.00 in your account. You are risking 5% on a trade. That means you can risk $50 on the trade. If you use a SL of 100 versus 30, look at the difference in your lot size. You can risk 1.66 per pip on a 30 pip SL versus a .50 on 100 pip SL. If the trade wins, then it is a difference between a $166 versus a $50 win by risking 5% on either. Look at the difference if you use 1 lot per trade. It's a difference between risking $1000 versus $300. That is if you have a TP target of 100 pips. Sometimes you will target 60 and sometimes you will target 120. Your account will survive and grow much faster by using this type of ratio. Some will argue that 30 SL is too close. Well yes and no. Scroll back on your screen for just 1 month and see how many trades would have entered you into the market then reverse the other direction. How many times did that happen especially if you trade multiple currencies. If you were trading 5 different currencies like this and they all retraced with 100 tp and 100 sl.....you would have lost 500 pips in one night. Now, look at it if you were risking 30 pips on those trades....150 pips loss instead of 500. Usually you will not have all currecies lose in the same night but I wouldn't want to risk it. Now look at the ones the didn't hardly retrace at all which would be all profit. Then look at the ones the retraced half way and then came back to take your profit. If you are completely honest with yourself when doing this you will see yourself winning around 40 to 50 percent of the time. Now take the 3:1 or sometime 4:1 ratio and see how much more money you would make. If you are not an experienced trader than I would suggest you not trade all 6 of the currencies that were suggested but pick out a couple and start from there. Then work your way up to more. Money management is a very key factor with this type of trading as well. You are going to lose trades but you need to live to trade another day if you are stopped out a few times. The system overall is a very good system to use with just a little tweaking. I hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #745 ---
Ufgators - thank you for a very informative post. I have been thinking about this strategy for some time, and your money management plan really makes this system far more viable. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #746 ---
Great monday morning for you all trading the GBPUSD with this system, certainly was for me. http://i31.tinypic.com/v4xobd.gif

--- 帖子 #747 ---
Yes, that was a nice trade. Do you have a tool that puts your Conserv TP, etc on the chart? It looks very neat and clean.

--- 帖子 #748 ---
Hi Uf Great advice 2 questions. DO you use 100 % or 618 fib for tp ? Do you use any trailing stop after you have moved sl first time to -15 pips ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #749 ---
On top of the ant_Gu breakout indicator you'll find all over the place, a couple of pages back in this thread you'll find the settings to put into your fibonacci retracement then just draw it across the range. You'll work it out

Thanks George.

--- 帖子 #752 ---
Thank you for your input and for sharing your experience. Some posts back someone asked about the TP-levels. Do you also use the 100 % and 61.8 % levels? What is your opinion about them? Also, do you have any opinion or experience with different breakout ranges? Thanks again!

--- 帖子 #753 ---
No problem

--- 帖子 #754 ---
I use both....I use the 100 for my tp but move my sl into profit once it hits the 618 level. I watch to see how it reacts at this level. Usually when it hits the 618 level I am in profit by 40 to 60 pips. I will move my sl to either b/e or to +20. That way if the market starts to reverse I can't lose. One thing I absolutely hate to see is a winning trade turn into a losing trade. Never let this happen. By a winning trade I don't me being up 10 to 20 pips then come into a loss but when you are up several pips around 50 then that would result in a winning trade. Remember, almost always a currency will not go straight to 100 pips without some sort of retracement. So you still have to let the trade have room to breathe. So you don't want to have your SL too close when you are up. This area of trading will only getting better as you get more experience. There is no set number here but what ever you are comfortable with. I usually follow it by 40 to 50 pips after I move my SL to +20. I never set a TP level unless I am turning off my computer and going to bed. But if I am up watching the trade then I will just keep adjusting my SL. Once I am up 100 pips I will move my SL very tight to around 10 pips away. This way if the market keeps going up in my direction then I can grab and extra 20 to 30 pips. But if it comes back then I will grab a 90 pip trade. No harm there. I don't use a trailing stop but doesn't mean it wouldn't work the same way. I just like to do it myself. If you are a new trader and can't adjust your sl quick enough then you might want to use a trail stop. Also, the 618, 50 and 382 are the sweet spots with fibs. So I keep a close eye on these areas. I also mark all my s/r areas and watch those very close as well. For example, if I have a profit area of 100 pips but a major s/r line is 90 pips away, then I will set my sl very close to that area. Sometimes, depending on how strong the s/r area is, I will just take my profit around 10 away from the s/r area and be done with the trade. Also, jump over to the daily chart before you set up your trades and see if there are any s/r lines there. The daily s/r areas are much stronger than the hour s/r. I do this with any type of trading I do and it has saved me from a lot of trades that would have been losers. For instance, if you are getting ready to place your orders and you see a daily or even the hour s/r is only 10 or 20 pips away from your entry, then you might want to pass on the trade or wait to see how price reacts to this area. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #755 ---
Very quick question, in GMT, when do you start and end your range (box)? Thanks

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Hello, see my last post for some info on the fibs. But I will add to that post here. When using fibs on this type of trade you will have to run a separate set of fibs to get your true tp area. Because the way this trade strategy was designed, you stretch your fibs down where the 50% level is really where the 0 level would normally be. All this is doing is telling you where the price level is for the same amount of movement that the market moved during the asian session. So, what I do is run my fibs like the it says by stretching the fibs down and get my entrys and tp levels. But, after this I delete the fibs and run them like they are intended to do. I run my fib extentions as well. the 3 levels of extensions is where I pay close attention to. You will notice that the majority of the time price will hit one extension then retrace before it goes to its second and third extension. It does not always hit the 2nd and 3rd extension but usually always hits the first. But, if you notice when placing your trades, the entry price is usually close or at the first fib extension. So, now price is either going to reverse, go to the second extension or retrace. This is one of the reasons why setting your sl to 30 will eliminate several losing trades that would result in 60 to 100 or even 120 pips. I don't know about you but I would rather lose 30 pips over 100 any day. The bread and butter of my trading comes from fibs. I use NO indicators at all on any of my trading strategies. I don't have a lot of strategies because I don't need a lot. As far as any other breakout strategies, I don't really have any because I more into reading the market than a mechanical approach. Although I use a mechanical approach like this, my fib trading strategy is my bread and butter of my trading. All I can say is if you want to trade using a breakout strategy, you want to use it where your entries are at the opening of the London or US open. This is where you get your bigger moves of 100 pips or so. A breakout strategy is rather easy to create. Just test your theory on a demo for awhile and make what adjustments you need. Just don't try to use a strategy like this after the london or US has been open for 2 or 3 hours. For example, I live in the EST of the US and the London opens at 3am here. I would not enter any type of trade using a breakout system at 6am. I would wait until the US opens. I have been asked several times to create a post on my fib strategy trading so I will probably create one here real soon. It is rather easy to do and you never risk more than 50 pips on any trade. But has a TP level anywhere from 100 pips to 400 pips. The good thing about the way I trade fibs is you don't have to set in front of your monitor for hours. You come back to it about every 3 or 4 hours until you find a trade setup. Once you find your trade you just set it and your done. You don't need to look at it until the next day if you don't want. Plus it works on any currency. I look at 12 different currencies so I always have a trade each day. Each currency will produce 1 to 2 trades per week. Hope this answered your questions.

I start this strategy from 00:00 to 08:00. Depends on your broker but that is from 6pm to 2am EST.

--- 帖子 #758 ---
Hey ufgators are you saying your range finishes at london open,your trades will only be entered after london open? thanks

--- 帖子 #759 ---
Yes that is correct.

--- 帖子 #760 ---
Hey mate but you say range ends at 2am EST, which is 1hr before london open thanks

--- 帖子 #761 ---
London opens at 3am but the Frankfurt opens at 2am which you will see price start to move during this time. If you are in the trade at 2am and in profit, when the london opens at 3am you will either see price continue in its direction or maybe a reversal. This is where the smaller stops comes into an advantage.

--- 帖子 #762 ---
So now you have contradicted your previous post, whih said you only enter aftr london open?

--- 帖子 #763 ---
Both Frankfurt and London are in Europe...The London market is the Next session to open after the Asian. The frankfurt opens at 2 which is part of the London session. You can start trading the london at 2am instead of 3am. Some traders like to wait until 3am and some like to trade at 2am. I personally start mine at 2am. No contradiction here, you just need to know your session times. For instance the Sydney and Tokyo are part of the Asian Session. So if someone tells you to trade the Asian Session what are you going to do? One starts at 6pm and one starts at 7pm EST. US is only 8am so you wouldn't want to start before 8am. You can find the times at www.forextechniques.com/tradingtimes.html

--- 帖子 #764 ---
ok mate i'm with you now, you just confused me with the reference to london open(i am in the uk) and i do know that europe opens 1hr before, we refer to it as European open thanks

--- 帖子 #765 ---
No problem....I am used to referring things to either the Asian, London or US sessions. So when I refer to the London session I am starting at 2am EST instead of 3am. I will have to remember to be more specific in my post when referring to these times.

--- 帖子 #766 ---

I am guessing you live in Indiana then b/c I am in Columbus Ohio (= NY time) and we are in EDT which is the sametime as Indiana EST right now. Do you only trade G/U and E/U? Thanks

Hey guys I wanted to make another post regarding money management that a friend of mine uses on his account. He uses all the rules that I posted earlier with the sl and tp levels. He uses the same money management rules that I mentioned also, but he takes one pair out of the 5 he trades and places a larger lot size then all the others. What he did basicly just to test out this system was opened a separate trading account that he uses for this strategy only. He placed 2500.00 in this account. He wanted to see how fast he could make it grow using this strategy and money management rules. What he does is place trades on 4 of the 5 pairs with .1 lots on them or $1.00 per pips. So now he is risking $120 if all 4 should result in losing trades. On the 5th currency he is placing 1 full lot on the trade. You can pick any currency but he is just doing this with one. Now if this trade goes bad then he loses $300.00 on that currency. He is risking a total of $420.00 on all these trades combined. I can't really give his results yet since he just started using this strategy last week but I will keep everyone updated on his results. All I can say at this moment is he is pretty happy and his account has nearly doubled so far. But you have to be careful by taking this approach since you are overall risking more than 5% of your account unless you have a larger account size to begin with. Lets do some basic math with this way. Lets say he is using the gbpusd as his 1 full lot and he trades for a full week with it. If he wins 2 out of the 5 trades for the week for an average of lets say 75 pips per win and he has his set sl at 30 pips. 3 losing days X 30 pips = 90 pips = $900.00 2 winning days X 75 pips = 150 pips = $1500.00 Total Net winning = $600.00 That's not counting the money you would make on the other 4 currencies. Not bad for a weeks work with only 2500.00 trading account. From what he told me he only lost 1 trade last week on the one with the full lot size. I just wanted to share this with you guys because a lot of traders do not like to trade with strict money management rules and find themselves risking too much than they should be. By doing this you can risk a little more without going crazy with it. I will update you guys at the end of the week to see how he is doing with it. Also, he uses the same pair as his full lot trade every day. He doesn't change currencies. Hope this helps.

I thought I'd try this yesterday on GBP/USD, got stopped out on the long and short, -30 pips each. I guess it will average out, I may have picked a bad day to start. Kim

--- 帖子 #774 ---
Adjust your SL once your are in profit. I usually move my SL from 30 to 15 once I am up around 25 to 30 pips. Sometime I will wait a little longer or even less just depends on how the market is moving and if there are any news releases coming out. If there is no news releases then chances are the market won't move that much. Needs a little help going 100 pips or so but not always. But on nights like last night you could have lost 15 instead of 30. The original post was a 1:1 ratio so if you stuck with that you would have lost nearly 80 pips. So losing 15 doesn't sound that bad now. Also, I never trade both directions. If I get a sell entry like I did last night I will close out my pending buy entry. If I lose then I lose and I am finished. Or I may re-enter in that same direction if price comes back to it. But every trader has there own preference. Another key point is you don't want to skip days if you are going to stick to this system. The reason I say this is because I have seen on several occasions where traders will lose a trade and get frustrated and will set out a few days to collect there courage to enter the market. Well, during those few days they set out the market actually won all of those days. So now they seen that it was winning again so they decide to enter the maket the next night. Well guess what? That night was the next losing trade. So now they are down 2 trades in a row. So it is very important that you stick to a system like this one since you only make one trade per day. I would suggest demo trading it before you go live just to see what the system can do. But remember you will have losses. They are like death and taxes. There is no way around it.

Hey guys, There was some talk a while back about staying out of the trade if the asia range was too big. What would you consider to be the max range for GBP/USD? eg. it was 106 pips overnight so I stayed out, that would make 55 pips to 161.80% from our open, pretty large. Typically as I write this it is looking like it may hit our first TP but your thoughts would be appreciated. Many thanks.

--- 帖子 #777 ---
Really? From what I have seen GBP/USD's Asia session averages around 70 pips. I normally start to worry if it excedes the 100 pip mark. How many is too many?

Hi Herry, In reference to Paulus initial post, it suggests that "our" close of the day is when London closes. This is because we are only trading with GBP as base currency. Hope it helps Jesper

--- 帖子 #780 ---
You are indeed a wise person, Ufgators, i really like your money management. What do you think about this: Instead of taking half profit at first TP (1.618) and letting the rest run. Buy example: with half lot size of what you would trade normally with Paulus system. Entry as before, 10 pips + spread above the asian high. SL appprox 30 pips below or half of potential profit target (depending on Asian range) which is 1.618. Then a second Entry order 7 pips above first TP (1.618) with a TP at 2.0 and a SL about 20 pips below or half of potential TP (depending on Asian range) at 2.0 fib. That should make a risk/reward (R:R) of 1:2 in theory? Of course if eveything goes well, you would have lost 50% earnings at the first TP at 1.618 since you don't close half anymore, but simply start out with half to begin with. But i think the money management would have taken a turn for the better. Or what do you think? With kind regards Jesper

An update on todays trades: I used the modification to the system as described above and here's the results for today. GBP/JPY +94 pips - Short #1 triggered, went TP #1 -38,5 pips - Short #2 triggered, went SL #2 Total: +55,5 pips GBP/USD +44,4 pips - Short #1 triggered, went TP #1 +53,6 pips - Short #2 triggered, went TP #2 Total: +98 pips Grand total for today: +157,5 pips. Can't complain, except i wish this was on my live account instead of the demo. I think a good part of this modification is that you won't have to follow the trade to split it at TP #1, i only set it up in the morning (i'm GMT +1) and let it run. I was lucky today that they didn't trigger both Short and Long and went red pips, is there a way to automate it so when the Long order is triggered all of the Short orders are cancelled? With kind regards Jesper

--- 帖子 #782 ---
Well done Jesper. Looks like a good amendment. I too was having trouble working out the best way to go from the 161% level to the 200% and 261%. A news event on GBP/USD at 09:30 caused it to swing around wildly for a bit but I will be looking to see how it works from here on. I was gutted today as my broker had technical probs and the charts were all down until around 08:30, doh! But hey, there is always tomorrow. Cancelling a buy order if a sell gets triggered and vice versa depends on your broker. Some have that function, some don't.

Hi Paulus and all FF fellow members... Just finishing reading through the whole 1 trade a day strategy which you (Paulus) kindly shared with all FF members. I want to ask you if you are still trading this strategy? As far as I understood, it is being traded in GU, GJ and EJ; is that correct? I am using the ant-GUBreakout indicator using 0:00 as start time and 8:00 as end time with a broker GMT shift of +2 ( FX Pro ) plus a 10 pip buffer on both sides, so that is 9 bars for me. Am I on the right track? I hope I don't take up too much of your time and would be deeply appreciated if you or anyone else replied back as to my current settings. Thanks in advance and I wish you the best. You deserve to do great in all aspects of life.
