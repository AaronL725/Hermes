Oh, but this one is so much fun!

What is it?

This is a trend trading system using very clean charts.

Which time frame (TF)?

Any two TFs with a ratio of 1:4 - 1:6, for example: I use the H1 and the M15 TFs with a ratio of 1:4. But you could use the H4 and H1 charts (ratio 1:4) or the daily and the H4 charts (ratio 1:6)....you get the picture.

Which pairs?

Any, but I will only use GBPUSD, EURUSD or AUDUSD for illustrative purposes.

How do we determine the direction of the trend for our purposes?

Simple. To a "blank" chart add a 200 EMA/close/0 shift indicator. See chart #1 below.

Looking from left to right at the 200 EMA on the H1 GBPUSD chart it is clear that direction has been going up since around October 7, thus, until the direction of the 200 EMA noticably changes, we will only be taking long trades, that is, only trades above the white 200 EMA line.

UPDATE: I am finding the MA crosss work very well on countertrend trades on lower TFs also....just monitor more closely and don't necessarily look for as many pips as in a trend trade.

Let's look at the H1 EURUSD chart for practice in determining direction. (chart #2 below) Again, the direction has been going up since approximately October 7. Go through this exercise on other pairs to get more practice in determining direction.

(Note: If you are trading from a higher TF as an H4 chart, you would use the 200 EMA on that higher TF to determine direction.)

Finishing setting up the trading chart.

To the blank chart with the 200 EMA add the following  Smoothed MAs:

---3 Smoothed MA/close/0 shift = gold

---8 SmoothedMA/close/0 shift = purple

See chart # 3 in next post

After the chart is set up, make sure to save the template.

SUMMARY OF THE "RULES"

Big Picture for direction comes from the H1 chart (or higher if trading another TF, but drawdown will be significantly bigger the higher TF one uses)

Scan for direction of 3,8 Smoothed MAs in relation to desired direction.

Make note of pairs setting up or need later review, for example, if they are approaching the 200 EMA...what will they do? Bounce off the 200 and turn, go through it, or walk along it. Those are the only choices.

When 3 crosses 8 on higher TF , move to lower TF for entry...look for a strong cross on lower TF and enter.

I monitor the trade on the higher TF, but that is a trader preference.

--- 帖子 #2 ---
Can I follow this with 5 and 30?

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Yes you can.  Just get your direction from the M30 or H1 charts.  That's a 1:6 ratio.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Ok, that's it......enter when the 3EMA crosses the 8EMA....this system does not have to use candles at all! That's the fun of it, although I do throw Heiken Ashi candles on it from time to time.

Over 200 pips on this pair alone last week using this fun system. Notice that the EMAs even pick up consolidation areas and retraces, but of course, what we want to see more often is that October 12, 150 pip move straight up....

Chart No. 3

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Wow. That's kinda like the system I'm using. See the attached chart. Sometimes I color the Stochastic lines black just for fun!

Actually, that's not a bad idea, Lawgirl. Those pesky candles are nothing but a distraction anyway.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
I'm surprised how easy is this to understand, I'm afraid i HAVE to look at the candles hahaha.

Thanks for sharing!

Regards

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Even better than GBPUSD last week...over 300 pips.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
It'd be really fun with an EA. "Paging Dr. Hopwood. Dr. Hopwood to the Blue Phone."

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Is there any SL and TP criteria?

Regards.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
No, I am assuming traders will use proper money management techniques.  But a trailing stop could be used or a hard stop at 2% of account, or a fixed pip TP, or a cross back across the 8EMA on a lower TF is generally what I use...it is up to the individual trader.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Let's say i'm trading the 15M and 1H timeframes.

I should be looking at crosses back to the 8 EMA on 15M TF ??

Thanks

Regards.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Look for cross set ups on the H1, enter on the lower TF.

For that long move up on GBPUSD last week, I was watching for the 3,8EMAs to hit the 200EMA to see if they would be repelled by it, or go through it.  The 200EMA turned price around (see arrow) and we had that nice move up.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
that was a pretty nice catch.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
I right there with you Lawgirl.  Once you get over the fear of losing and you can trust your own intentions, making money at Forex can be simple and fun.

Here's a little envelope MA cross template of my own that I use every so often.  No candles, just follow the white line and stay on the right side of the trend.  How much easier can it be?

I guess great minds think alike, and all that.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Hey forexhard, nice to hear about you, I'm very new in FF cause I was reading but never getting involved in the forum, however i will from now on since it's incredible the amount of kwnoledge you can get out of FF.

I was reading the stairsteps thread, pretty nice system yet powerful, can't wait to markets open just to try it out on demo of course.

I was thinking, what about a 100pips SL looking for a 1000pips profit?

Sounds crazy?

Regards.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
If you are asking about Stairsteps, then this is the wrong place for your questions.  Please respect Lawgirl and keep your questions focused on her presentation, not mine.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
This looks interesting.  Definitely be demoing it this week.  Even in a consolidation phase, if you exit when the 3 and 8 cross your losses will be minimal compared to the times when you win.  Plus, it saves on wear and tear of the ole eyeballs!

There was a fellow on here who suggested this strategy:  "go in with 2 or 3, and when you hit +50, sell two and bring the stop loss up to break even and let the third one run" until the 3 and 8 cross again.  It's a great strategy because you've eliminated greed...and the runner is a free trade!

Thanks LawGirl.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
I was talking about lawgirl's system not yours.

Yours is pretty nice tough.

Regards

--- 帖子 #19 ---
That's a definitely a good idea.

Do you use microlots (0.01) or minilots (0.1)?

Regards

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Just to get this right....?

Look at the 1H for the big picture, if the 200Ema is pointing up, then wait for 3ema to cross 8ema on the 1H. when that happens, wait for a cross on the 15M to time your entry? If 3ema has crossed 8ema allready on the 15M, then you buy immediatly.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
last week was very good for many couples because it had a tendency ... but there will be moments of detection range is paramount when operating ma´s

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Wow, I like this too.  Will give it a try.  Thanks.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Excellent suggestion, but if your account is not big enough for 2 or 3, we can go in with 1 and close.5, .4, etc to protect profits.  Even if one is trading.02($.20) pips, .01 can be closed and let the other $.10 ride.

There are ways to always protect profit.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
You are right.  Last week for example, there were 2 days where I did not trade this method because there was consolidation and no good setups.  When that happens I move on to another trading system.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Did a quick test on the 4h using daily as direction. Eurusd 2011. Profit 87% drawdown 7000 starting with 10k. I will send the results later

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Looking at forexhard's chart set up at post #14 (thanks again, forexhard) along with the 3,8 EMA set up, and using trendlines (TL) we have a very nice way to watch the action.

Notice that the MAs--which reflect price action (PA)-- have narrowed into a pennant formation on both charts.  If the bottom pennant line is breached and continues down, we would not be trading this pair on this system.  (Remember that every good trader needs an arsenal of trading methods for different situations...at least 4-6 different set ups for different market conditions.)

But if price breaches the top pennant line, we would look to enter long again.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
hey lawgirl, i heard that youre one of the indicator pioneers here! How are you?

so u basically  put no color on chart, just indicator?

thats cool such a new method

i hope some people will find it interesting and trade with it

--- 帖子 #28 ---
looks tempting, will take a dive, kudos LG

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Thanks bumapatria, don't think I am a pioneer here, but thanks for your kind words.

I hope everyone goes through charts and researches this setup then demos it before using real money

--- 帖子 #30 ---
" Those pesky candles are nothing but a distraction anyway. "

Now that was funny.. still laughing !!!

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Yes, that is correct, lehmann. Although each trader needs to use their own discretion about entering any trade "immediately".

Big Picture for direction comes from the H1 chart (or higher if trading another TF, but drawdown will be significantly bigger the higher TF one uses)

Scan for direction of 3,8 EMAs in relation to desired direction.

Make note of pairs setting up or need later review, for example, if they are approaching the 200 EMA...what will they do? Bounce off the 200 and turn, go through it, or walk along it. Those are the only choices.

When 3 crosses 8 on higher TF , move to lower TF for entry...look for a strong cross on lower TF and enter.

I monitor the trade on the higher TF, but that is a trader preference.

Hey LG

Good to see you back around.. Much success with this new thread.. MA's are always fun !!

Will definitely be lurking

TSD

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Good to hear from you, TSD. I hope you are doing well and making lots of pips. Yes I am back but will not be spending the time I was spending on Trade What You See...but I missed the community. Trading is a very lonely business, as we have heard a million times. I think as with everything in life, there needs to be balance-- and I was getting a little "unbalanced".

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hello Law girl

i really love your naked trading thread, and that is an awesome trading strategy

today i notice that you make a new thread, a moving average strategy ....

that use indicator as a trigger, and this is contrary to your past trading strategy that use a price action as a trigger ... does the naked trading strategy is not effective anymore ??

btw congrats for your new thread

jin shan

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Good to hear from you.

Yes... Balance is very important... Less is more in this business. Took years to understand that concept. As with many things in trading, it can be very counter intuitive. IMHO

The community is a great place. Hard to stay away for sure.

Trading has been good and I hope the same for you.

Look forward to your new thread. Will pop in from time to time.

TSD

--- 帖子 #36 ---
lawgirl21, maybe it is a stupid question, but I'm smart enough not to be afraid to look stupid!

What exactly do you mean when you say "a strong cross"?

Thank you!

--- 帖子 #37 ---
hey!

I'm just curious would you mind sharing those indi's you have on your MT4?

I think one is from lawgirl and the other one I don't know.

Thanks!

Saludos!

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Lawgirl I have a few questions, hope you don't mind answering.

1. What's the philosophy underlying this system, we are trend followers?

2. I'm using the CCpf indicator as well, what do you think about taking a trade when I know X currency is getting stronger as a confirmation? With this I mean if I know USD is getting stronger against all majors and I have an upside trend in EURUSD (with a cross above the 8EMA) Should I get in?

Regards.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Great new thread. Loved the naked trading thread and learned alot. I have been using a similar set up for the past while. I use 5 and 10 ma with the 200 added for direction. Long if above the 200 and short if below. Works great most of the time.

Good trading,

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Not a stupid question at all. I should have explained better.

By strong cross, I am looking for 12:00 - 2:00 o'clock for a long trade and 4:00 - 6:00 o' clock for a short trade.

Example

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Something like this LG?

--- 帖子 #42 ---
That's exactly what I thought! Thank you, lawgirl21!

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Test results using Daily & 4H

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Using 1H (just a little different approach)

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Thank you for your results. I have questions:

Did you wait for the crosses in the 3&8 EMA in H1 too?

Did you wait for candle close in H1 and m15 before entering the trade?

excuse for my english.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
I waited for the candle to close on the 1H and i waited for the cross on the 1H. When that happened i looked at the 15M for confirmation

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hi lawgirl

few questions :

1. how long have u been trading this system on live account and what results did you have? maybe i got it wrong, but its not enough to say - last week it would produce 300 pips, its very easy but if u were not taking decisions entering trades, closing them etc it is not reliable.

2. you said there is no need for candles, so how do you enter your trades? 3 and 8 moving average (esp EMA's) are very short-term and lagging indicators so it's not so easy to backtest sth like that - it could be crossed much more times than u see in history during candles were creating but then it could reverse and close on the other side and bam there is no cross when u look back in history

3. pls dont take this all as some offence, its good that u want to help traders, there is so much "trading systems" in this section but im very sceptical they do work, i never met pro institutional trader(and i met a lot of them) who was using some ema crosses....it surely can be profitable but its not because of the "system" but because the trader who knows every aspect of the market he trade and the "system" is only some guide or sth like that, but i'm sure that every newbie will just get f*cked up again because of too much relying on TA changing "systems" and not being flexible to what market is telling.

wish you all the best.

regards mike.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
hi, i think that this is a very bad system for beginners and it can kill those micro & mini accounts because what most of the newbies will do (what i did 1 year ago), is that they will enter the market too early or at false breakouts very often. I recommend you to close this thread or to add some more rules to the system. No Offense..!

--- 帖子 #49 ---
i think its part of the process right to fail the first time? failure is the sort of foundation for success imo. You know then what is needed to profit, what istn etc. and yes, this is more on the fun side i guess, and every system usually is locked in to its owners and or creators. Like bill williams' stuff. or whatever..

this one is quite cool in my opinion.

truth be told, technical analysis is not a must.

but since we can analyze part of the market with charts, so why not?

well.. this is a controversy

i see lawgirl with good setups, but that doesnt necessarily mean, its good for everyone like some people say.

@lawgirl, dont close the thread, you cant prevent failure, the true vessel of failure is the traders' themselves ie: i blow my account. i cant blame my system, (well i can...) but in the end i choose to use it and fail with it right? its in the end my fault.

a system should be stuck with if profitable really, but im not too indicator fancy, except ones that change timeframes, and show sessions lol.

but for peopel like lawgirl, this is their passion, their love, so i guess go ahead lawgirl

good luck with thread, i wanna see more of your setups haha they look intriguing

Best regards,

Buma

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Well, LG has proved herself as being one of the most successful traders/mentors here at FF....

Crazzzzzy, I guess most beginner accounts get killed by poor MM and lack of discipline? No??

Anyway, you are free to advice what to improve...

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Hey Mike, if u wanna backtest this, then its obvious closed bars that are referring to and thats pretty easy and straightforward. Otherwise it couldnt be done.

But every trader is not the same, some will close before others and some will let it ride. If u invented a bulletproof system with rules, i would bet u that introduced to 2 different kind of persons, they will give u 2 VERY different results.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
hi lehman,

yes u re right about this about bulletproof system with rules that there will be different results for different persons, and about candles - now i understand what u mean, but i was asking lawgirl because she mentioned in the first post that u dont need candles or chart at all and MA's are enough - but this would cause the method to be lil bit untradeable i think - because of lagging indicators.

mike.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
You are correct, craz, this is NOT a beginner's system. I said that about the systems in my last thread, but few listened. Simplicity is often misunderstood for simple.

Because it is not a beginner's system, we don't need to discuss basic trading assumptions like proper MM and exit rules in anything but the most perfunctory of terms.

Trading is  boring, and especially successful trading, so I am always looking for effective, interesting ways to make pips. This is just another way. But like any trading, use at your own peril. It is indeed possible to lose your entire account with this or any other trading system. (I know, I've done it several times.)

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Exactly like that FH...a perfect representation.  You are good to have around!  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Thanks for the backtesting, lehmann.  Impressive results, even with the DD.  Is there a way to test with an exit before the cross back?

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Throw the line graph (which is the same as a 1EMA, I found out) on this chart Mike and you will see that the 3EMA(yellow) smooths out the PA as represented by the line graph (green line). Using the 3EMA will keep us in trades longer, yet get us out when we need to exit.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Fantastic job on your new system LAWGIRL. I also use your other sytem too.

I have added the round number indie to this. Take a look and see how price reacts to these.

I will only post this indie with your permission. Goldflight.....

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Yes, please post this indie. I have never seen this one. Price does react to those numbers. Thanks, Goldflight.

P.S. Is there a way to only have the green lines, the big round numbers show? Probably...huh...

P.P.S.  Probably would make good range/BO lines too.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
You are very welcome. Here it is.         Goldflight.................

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Yes. Just change the setings.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
I like it...good instant S/R lines.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Distraction anyway? Oh god, reading such posts really make me feel that I want to poke my eyeballs out so I could never see such BS again.

Price action is everything!

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Trading without candles could be like reading a book with the a.b.c.d.e.f of the alphabet.

Each candle has a story to tell.

This EMA cross system is beautiful in its simplicity BUT we cannot ignore what the candles tell us.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Absolutely, removing candles means that you cut yourself out from very useful information that market gives you.

But of course if this system makes them money then it's not my place to judge.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
OMFG. Are you really this obtuse?

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Easy pal, there was no way I could tell that you did not really mean that.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Going back over previous Lawgirl posts, I find that she explains her strategies in a clear and concise manner.  This thread is no exception.

I have no idea whether this strategy will be a pip gatherer or not but, I like the style with which she writes.  Her posts are always courteous, she never talks down to people and there is never a hint of arrogance.  How refreshing, after reading some of the stuff here on FF.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Well, there is one way: obtuseness. Just kidding. Hey, it was late Friday night humor. Actually, the zinger  was 'sometimes I color the Stoch lines black just for fun'. The rest was just piling on.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
An exit before the cross back on the big TF could be on the small TF, but it will create alot of trades. Either that or simple support/resistance or even the round numbers for target.

Its also possible to have 2 TP as targets.

First target could be a round number or nearest s/r. If first target is reached, then move stop to BE. second target could be when a cross is made on the higher TF to let it play out.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Use a stoploss with the help of a stochastic,

after entry,  put you're stop at the low of the stochastic.

calculate the distance of entry and stop and calculate that by the entryprice.

example:  entry 1.4030- stop 1.4010= 20 pips

take profit 1.4030 + 20 = 1.4050

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Lehman and Dutchsignals....both excellent suggestions for stops and TPs.  Between the two or you, you said pretty much all that needs to be said. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #72 ---
that's it  indeed this is no allround method, it's a framework and it will do well if there's momentum in the market, and discretion is mandatory for sensible application.. if traded alone, in itself. It simply has to be profitable IF applied properly, and even if the market conditions are 'easy' (aka trending or at least big swing range), one still needs a clear-cut, definite setup and that is exactly what the method offers.

The method reminds me of this system posted >3yrs ago; a framework simple as it can be. The OP was largely bashed right from the start, because of indicators are lagging etc. He supposedly still trades the system after all these years. I tend to believe him; those 'systems' are NOT mechanical (as ppl like to expect), they're mere but extremely useful frameworks where experience has to be applied. Yes, indeed we need experience and feel for the market, but we need some tool to limit the otherwise unlimited market for ourselves. We need one imaginary line at least  ..otherwise, we're gonna be lost very quickly. Some profitable trader's framework might consist of of channels, trendlines.. another's of gann stuff or forks.. others emphasize supply/demand zones.. and yes, there are profitable traders whose framework is a reign of moving averages or stochs.

I like useful indicator applications because they are a gateway to partial automation/alerting. I like the MA framework on two TFs. I'm about to make myself a kind of 'watchdog' sitting on multiple pairs/instruments to alert me on possible emerging trends for further evaluation (eyeballing/trading).

Many thanks for inspiration, Lawgirl  and pls keep sharing your ideas and experience.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
I made this indicator a while ago for a system idea I had not unlike LawGirl's.

He's an expert named Gus, after Hera's Argus, a watchdog with as many as a thousand eyes. He sits perched on EUR/USD because it is the most liquid pair, and the more ticks, the more Gus watches for price crosses, moving average crosses, and Ichimoku crosses.

He watches 32 pairs across all (selectable) time frames. When a signal is given for any strategy, he Print()'s it to the "Experts" tab in MT4.

I'll post the code when I get back to my computer in the hope that you may all become more vigilant and productive in your trading. Should be in an hour or so..

Regards.

EDIT: The IchimokuMod was a development spin-off when I originally wrote Gus, but if you like it, it could easily be added as a different option/check. Also, the ema_cross_check used to be the frasma_cross_check, which came later on, but I changed it back to EMA for the purposes of this thread.:nerd:

--- 帖子 #74 ---
hi lawgirl

interesting strat and I am looking forward to putting to the test. canI ask how would you trade this strat approaching red or orange news.

Is it worth thowing on the closing price as a line chart?

And how do filter false signals e.g the ones that make the cross only to recross and go in the opposite direction when you have entered.

Many thanks

Aj1

hi lawgirl,

you say wait for the 3/8 ema cross on the highger tf, then look at the lower tf for a cross.

but if the cross has already occured on the higher tf,  then the lower tf would have already crossed ...?  so there is no need to look for a cross on the lower tf is there ?

what happens in a ranging market when there are up and down crosses all the time......

--- 帖子 #83 ---
also, forgot to ask.

when you talk about the trend on the 200 ema, how many candles do you look back at to determine the trend, or indeed how many days / hours must the trend be in existence for it to be a valid trend ?

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Is there a way of not having candles other than making them the same colour as the background?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #85 ---
If i may.

Looking on lower TF is subjective and can be used to time the entry better or even use it as an exit. Or one could look at the angle of the cross to determine the strength.

In a ranging market there will off course be many more trades, and considering the spread then it would be a no go in many pairs.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Set the color to "None"

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Thanks Bobcat2

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Hi Gus,

Your FIRST post on FF is great and may you develope into a great EA-writer but may I suggest that you not mess with this thread and let it carry on the excellent work LG is doing.

Suggest start a New Thread. RGDS.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
I let this trade run through the night. Up around 50 pips. Almost at the 382 fib line.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
IMO the shorter TF would show a trend redirection before the longer one.  Carried to the extreme then the 1M is the most telling as to what is happening NOW but of course the whipsaws on the 1 & 5M TFs are killers.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
That is very true, if you have a tolerance for the M1 chart.  I don't.  I will glance at it, then move back to an M15 or H1 chart.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Is up today....look for EURUSD and other $ pairs, but especially EU, to be down.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Hello LG,

Good luck with the new thread

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Hello tener,

Thanks for the MA cross alert EA, looks to be ideally suited to LG's MA cross system. Any chance an audible alert could be built in as I find keeping an eye on the Expert's log tab means that I miss quite a few signals?  Thanks.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
LG - just wanted to say thanks a million - i have long been a lurker on your other thread - this is simple, and des what it says on the tin - currently i am up 165 pips on EURJPY and 75 pips on EURUSD (though i really ought to say a little thank you to Merkel as well!)

you are the best

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Great job, dimlat.  You are up using the 3,8 EMAs?  Notice how well this works with the H1 4C BO too.. I just banked another 40 pips on the BO.

Thanks for the kind words.  Yes, Merkel helped us today...for sure.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
yes, using the EMA crossover - though, i actually violated one of your rules i think - i went short on the EURJPY although we were clearly above the 200 EMA on most TF - in fact it only just pushed though the 200 EMA just now on the 4H TF - naughty? lucky?  would appreciate your thoughts.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
More or less on the dot ! A little patience and 50 pips in pocket !

Good System. I use indie based system -You give me confidence !

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
No hard and fast rules, just use your good traders' judgment.  I have banked about 100 pips since open on Sunday countertrading too.  Keep doing what you are doing..

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Terrific vilas!  Confidence is what trading is all about..glad I can help.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
thanks - i am slowly learning to read PA and have the confidence to trade - currently using 2 mini lots per trade without being nervous - allowing trade time to breathe a little, setting SL, etc etc

--- 帖子 #102 ---
They are rules I was following too.

Looks like eveyone else has been doing well by just following the EMA crosses.

Aj1

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Lehman, test the 5 and 20 emas,please, and you will be surprised with very high results. The rules are the same as per Lawgirls rules for 3 and 8 emas. Please, report results afterwards,

--- 帖子 #104 ---
That could get pretty annoying with the fast EMA's that this system is using. I've been talking with another member of the forum on another style of displaying the information.

Also, I'd like to write an EA for this system to be backtested, but the rules for whether to go long or short seem to be kind of subjective so far.

Another issue I have is when to enter a position: should I wait for the smaller timeframe candle to close? If I don't, what should I do if it turns out to be a false cross? etc.

be careful - euro taking a breather, its true, but keep an eye on the bigger picture

looks that way.

The price is above the 200 ema on the 1hr.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
I cannot call it Gus anymore, really...

Changed to indicator, instead of expert. The reason the numbers are on the left is because of the difficulty of formatting the string properly given the various lengths that the number of pips could be.

Well, that's it I guess.

Good luck.

EDIT:

Modified it already. It's now optional to show only the pairs who need your attention. Also, cleaner formatting and I set the default colors to match the charts I've seen here.

I would wait for either a break below the congestion/support line or a break above the 8 EMA before an entry.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Hi Lg

Thanks for that, strange how the charts I posted showed a clear cross of the 3/8 ema's, one long and the other a short and how the chart you have got up, there is no cross.

Aj1

--- 帖子 #113 ---
3 ema close

8 ema open

maybe?

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Rules are there on page 1 of the thread 3/8 ema, and throw on the 200 ema.

Great going, are you just going with the ema crosses on any given timeframe.

i am finding the m15 too arbitrary, easily re-crosses - i prefer to wait for the 1hr to give a strong signal

Hi Lawgirl, greetings from Houston, are you still using 3 and 8 EMA's, or 5 and 20 EMA's?

Thank you, Darryl

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Hi Darryl and welcome. I don't know where the 5 and 20 EMAs came from. I am only using the 3 and 8s. I have a brother in Spring.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Trailing stop took me out with 56 pips.  Out of EU with 20 pips.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Lawgirl could you expand on the BO add on that you have, and how you use it?

Thanks

Aj1

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Thank you Lawgirl, the reason I asked is because my charts don't look exactly like your charts, but when I change to 5 and 20 EMA's then my charts look like your charts, strange. Really like this system, made 40 pips on GBPUSD earlier!

Spring is a really nice town, near Houston.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
I guess the difference is different feeds from different brokers.

My set up is the 3 and 8 EMA/close/0 shift.

Glad you like this system,  it's fun and profitable.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
3/8 SMMA match lawgirl21's charts.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Oh boy, Aj1.  The H1 4C BO is the main topic of my other thread Trade What You See---Almost Naked Trading.  That is where the BO indicator comes from too.  I would refer you back to that thread.

I have just somewhat incorporated the two trading systems, although each can stand alone.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
I am waiting for a 6:00 set up for a possible re-enter short.

Ok I will have a look. What are your thoughts on the AUS on the 1hr, I want to take it on, but I dont think it likes me.

Aj1

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Sorry for silly question but could somebody tell me how do you have your charts setup with all the different pairs you are looking at. Do you have a short time frame and long time frame for each pair on display, if so how many pairs can you get on one screen or do you just have one chart per pair and change time frames on the fly?Many Thanks

Geoff

--- 帖子 #157 ---
This is how my screen looks...easy because I am only watching 3 pairs.  I go back and forth between TFs.  Set up is a very individual thing.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Hi zznbrm, you're right, thank you. But now I'm confused, which one do I use? 3 and 8 EMA's, or 3 and 8 SMMA's to match Lawgirl's charts?

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Thanks Lawgirl,

Understand it now

Geoff

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Hello daryll

This is probably more to do with broker timings, take a look at my charts they are slightly different to Lawgirls.

Hope this helps

Aj1

--- 帖子 #161 ---
look at my AUS 1hr chart and see.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #162 ---
This pair is not showing us anything at this time, in my opinion. It seems to be taking a break after that nice move down.

There might be something showing on a lower TF, but to me, that would be chasing the trade.

Notice though that yesterday's move down was almost exactly the same as the move up the day before. Price looks to be wanting to move up again and the 200 EMA suggests long is to be expected....just not quite yet.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
H Aj1, thanks. My chart looks exactly like your's when I use 3 and 8 EMA's.

BTW, I'm using FXDD.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Darryl,

Yes, it is confusing. It is very clear from the lawgirl21's charts that 3/8 Smooth MAs are being used. I'm not sure why they are advertised as EMAs????

And no...these obvious differences in MAs can NOT be attributed to broker data feeds. That's just silly!

Aj1 is clearly showing EMAs.

I guess you can use what works best for you.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Thanks for having a look for me Lg, although on my chart that I just posted it is showing a long.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #166 ---
I owe everyone an apology....I have been using and testing both EMAs and smoothed MAs....what I have been posting this morning has been the 3,8 Smoothed MAs.  I am not  seeing a big difference in trades between the two set-ups, but I am truly sorry for the confusion.

I had no intention of "advertising" anything.  I gain nothing from any of this.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
What should we go with then?

Aj1

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Here they are side by side.  The smoothed is  more conservative than the expo.  I am going to be using the smoothed.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
I have made the changes from EMA (except the 200) to SMA for the 3 and 8 on page 1.  Hopefully I caught them all.

Again, sorry for the confusion.   Pips were made from both setups.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Now my charts are the same.

Hi LG.

Simple but effective strategy, congratulations and thanks, I will follow with interest. Also thanks for your contribution to FF on your other strategies.

One question if I may: You mentioned you had gone short recently on the EUR/USD and yet price is above the 200 MA (which is flattening out a bit) on the 1 HR TF.

Your instruction in post one is to only trade in the direction of the trend.

Any reason for this trade?

Regards

Paul

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Thank you Lawgirl and everyone's help on this. I've changed my MA's to 3 and 8 Smoothed. Left the 200 alone.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Purely countertrend trades for the last 2 days on EURUSD and GBPUSD based on the USD Index going up, which generally mean EU and GU go down.  There was just too srong a move down not to get in, but countertrend trades must be watched more closely, in my opinion, and   generally don't produce as many pips.

Check post 1 again, I have updated to address countertrends.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
USDCAD trade today: 77 pips

Now I took EU as a trend trade setup

It bounced off 200 EMA

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Thanks. Makes perfect sense.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Entered this pair long..up about 15 pips so far.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
So, Lawgirl we should use 200EMA and 3, 8 smoothed EMAs?  I ask, because you spoke about 3, 8 SMAs. Thank you

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Exactly right.

Hey LG, good to see you again, looks like you're tapping into some crazy territory... Wow, no candles, huh? I'll give it a try, love your threads!!! Still doing the 1H BOs here...

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Lawgirl, do you regard the cross of 3 and 8 in eur/usd as a good signal to go euro long now? Thank you,

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Good to hear from you, Pete. I still trade the 1H BOs too, my main setup actually.  This is just a little different twist.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Sorry I found your post a little late.  Looking at the M15 chart now, I would wait to see if the move up continues after this pullback before entering.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Trailing stop took me out with 40 pips.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
http://www.fxcotlounge.com

--- 帖子 #187 ---
3 smoothed MA is the same as 5 EMA, and

8 smoothed MA is the same as 15 EMA.

So you can have 5 EMA and 15 EMA on your chart .

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Nicely done. Simple and working well. Thanks Lawgirl.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
LG, Congratulations by this new thread.

Only on thing, in order not to create confusion, I think you should not use the term SMA to refer to Smoothed MAs, because this term is used for Simple MAs.

Thanks.

Thanks maudur....good point.

Lawgirl,

Could you post the box-indicator that shows on your charts? Thanks, Ludo

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Hi Lawgirl!

Thank you for sharing this very interesting system.

If I understand it, most of the time you don't enter immediately after the cross of the smmas* but when the price goes above the previous resistance (or under the previous support ) formed by the smma 8.

Thank you in advance for your answer.

* "smma" is the usual abbreviation for "smooth moving average" and "sma" stands for"simple moving average".

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Will give it a go - its nice, clean and not complicated with tons of indies - lovely.

May I ask you, to post the BO indi you are using?

Thanks and best regards,

blazej

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Since Im not able to sit in front of the monitor for the whole days I searched for pairs with potential BO - crossings and quickly generated an EA.

its simple:

it enters a long when:

sma3>sma8>ema200 (on h4) and sma3>sma8 (on h1)

opposite for shorts.

only good if you are looking for a BO since it will enter at whatever place if above condtions are met.

Hi Guys,ive been around for sometime here in FF,but never ppost any yet,and i great fan of lawgal for her simpilycity. the reason im posting now,coz im using similar method like this MA,and im using 1HR to take the trade whenever the xrossing happens,well im using Bolingerband squizz to enter the trades,for exit,ill exit 80% and keep the remaining 20% in the trade to ride the trend

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Do u have any results please

--- 帖子 #207 ---
I must have missed the post that explains the "box," what is its significance please?

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Hi Lehmann,so very good ,i can say 70-80% ,only problem is the HIGH impact news ,so we should avoid trading this method or any method when approaching high impact news,ive attach the result from yest ,and im still holding on to the remaining trades/lots to ride the trend

--- 帖子 #209 ---
I am also curious about the blue lines.

Another thought...what about adding a dashed line for smoothed 12 and 32 MAs, which will represent the H4 chart on the H1? So, we wait for the higher timeframe to cross before we consider the lower timeframe cross valid, correct?

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Lots of you asking about those blue lines.......they are from LG's other thread Trade Naked available from the first page.

1 hr breakout (BO).

I went to bed with these three open trades.  Woke up to AUDUSD stopped out at BE +3 pips.  I put trailing stops of 40 points (4 pips) on EU and GU and was stopped out at EU +43 pips and GU +55 pips.

Very Nice results, do u mind sending me a picture of your chart, or post it here.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Hi, i'm kind of new at trading forex and i've read about many systems here at FF, but i have to say this one seems really easy and profitable.

I'm combining it with your BO strategy and added an Ichimoku cloud standard settings to validate the trend against the kumo (still at test stage). I have been paper trading for a week or so, but yesterday i decided to make a small real trade, i got nice +50 on EU entering al 1.3800.

I will keep using this method, looking for reentries setups, trying to eliminate my second guessing .

Many thanks LG!

Happy pips to you all!

had a crazy day yesterday.......ignored many rules and nearly blew my account - up 500 pounds one minute......down 700 the next.........cut my losses and ran

lessons learned

1.  never trade just before the news

2.  always use good money management

3.  dont chase losses - close the computer and take a walk !

4.  always set a SL

5. dont overtrade

6.  dont pull the trigger unless you have checked the larger TF carefully

anyhow....live to fight another day

currently up 40 pips on 2 trades on EURGBP - trailing SL set - 4 minilots

happy trading

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Thnx, can anyone compare their stats with lawgirls method???

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Hi Lawgirl,

Figured I'd chime in as I also trade crossovers with similar MA's, although I use two sets of MA's 5/10 EMA and 30/60 EMA, and enter on pullbacks, and only trade 4H and Weekly. Trading these two TF's on the same pair keeps the trades balanced and has worked very well for me through trending and ranging markets, especially when combined with a trend reversal strategy. It took me a long time to figure out how profitable simple strategies like this can be when applied correctly.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Right now in AUDUSD M30

Countertrend trade

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Andreas, I think you're using EMA and not SMMA. Please see the change in post # 1.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
I am still testing them against each other.  The smoothed seems to be more conservative and gives a later signal than does the exponental.  Both work well.  We are using the smoothed for uniformity.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Both in pullbacks now...countertrend trades.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
How Many pips was TP in each pair?

--- 帖子 #231 ---
hi Lg

Can I ask did you take both trades of the 1hr.

And how long do you wait before you get, and what other factors if any do take into account before getting into a trade.

Regards

Aj1

--- 帖子 #232 ---
I took both trades off the H1 charts with confirmation on the M15 charts.  I was using the EMA setup however, not the SMMA and the EMA got me into the trade faster than the smoothed, but I had to wait longer for profit.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
I am on my office computer now and can't look up exact numbers, but roughly 30 on EU and 40 on AU.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Thanks LG. My question is mostly to know if you decided to take those TP for some special criteria or not.

In my first trades with this strategy I used Trailing Stop and not Take Profit and have left many pips on the table.

Thank you very much.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
No, I have no special way to calculate TP other than reasonable S/R areas and TLs and whether or not it is a trend or countertrend trade.

We will almost always leave pips on the table because we can't judge the tops or the bottoms. Don't let that bother you...there is a next trade right around the corner. I lost almost 50 pips on an earlier trade by setting a SL +3....can't even remember the pair now...would have to look it up.... because that was several good trades ago.

One of my trading mottos is: Move in, move out...but keep on moving.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
i thought you were only taking long trades above the 200 ma ie, post #1. these 2 charts show taking short trades above the 200 ma.???

--- 帖子 #237 ---
No, I pointed out that these were countertrend trades.  Re-read page 1.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Hi Maudur

Glad to see you back!

Actually I use SMMA on the charts, maybe it is a data issue caused by different brokers we use so we get different charts from time to time?

Cheers

Hi Andreas, I'm also glad to see you in this thread.

If the truth is that brokers have different graphs are a little different. The interesting thing is to follow this strategy and actively participate to support each other.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Just started trading this on a small account in conjunction with the BO strategy, focussing on breakouts in the trend direction after London open.

Initial trade:

CHFJPY long @ 84.979 (18 pip SL) = quick 55 pip profit.

Once that trade was closed, I moved the SL on the following trades to nearby S/R to secure in a small profit, so as not to negate my CHFJPY win for the day!  I eventually closed them out upon recross of the SMAs.

USDCAD short @ 1.01914 = 29 pips

NZDUSD long @ 0.79467  = 17 pips

EURCHF short @ 1.23903 = 19 pips

My initial stoploss on all trades was between 1-2%.

Total pips for the morning = 120 pips (7.25% of account balance).

An excellent start!

Many thanks to LG for sharing her strategies.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
I look at them both, but because I am somewhat impatient, I am using the EMAs primarily because they seem to give a quicker signal.  However, the smoothed are more conservative and likely give a more confirmed signal.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
One more thing if I may, to my question last night, you said when you take your trades on the 1hr, you wait for the 15min for confirmation.

Could you expand on that please.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Thank you. I see you use a 200 ema for trend direction, I use 150.  Either one should be ok.  Thanks again, p.

Hi Lawgirl,

congrats on a very interesting trading system, really like it and appreciate you posting it along with the rest of your efforts here.

My question is: Do you have a audible alert for the cross of the sma's?

This would be really useful if you did?

--- 帖子 #291 ---
No, nothing that technical.  I have no idea about how to go about that.

Hy LG,

Hope your well. I've been following your other method for a long time and I've just started to follow this as well....

On the other thread, the guys started to give a reason as to why they entered a trade to give people a better understanding of the trading system....

Do you think it would be a good idea to start doing that on this thread?

So every trade entered by a trader, they give a reason as to why they entered the trade. It may help some of us as I do tend to come home from work and load up my charts and look at the days events and I suppose it would be good to read the reasoning behnd some of the entered trades.

Hey LG, I've been following the new thread with great interest, one question though:

I see that you put the H1 BO boxes on your chart. Do you actually use the lines to enter trades (like with regular BOs enter when outside the lines etc..) I didn't see much discusssion on that topic.

Along the same lines, so since there is no candles, you don't look at much of S/R levels anymore? (besides S/R on the MA lines.. - this one I have to wrap my brains around a little..)

Like Maudur's AUDUSD trade above, he entered at a resistance, but since no candles, we can't tell... Do you worry about that at all?

--- 帖子 #303 ---

Which one are you using SMA or EMA

Thanks

DC

--- 帖子 #305 ---
AUDUSD at TP. +35 pips

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Good questions Pete.  I am using the BO boxes as S/R areas and have noticed that the MAs often go right back to them.  The cross set ups can come within the BO boxes for an earlier entry, but once the MAs BO, the trade is like any other BO.

I definitely use S/R still, but am using the MA lines instead.  I am looking at the  MAs lines as PA (which they are) and find that the lines most often setup clearer S/R areas than looking at candles. I like too that consolidation areas are very clear with the MA lines.

But, I don't want you or any other trader to take my word that we don't need the candles to be very profitable traders.  Prove it to yourself by adding the candles and determining if they really tell you more than the MAs alone do.  So traders may never be comfortable without them and that is certainly fine.

Add the 1EMA or 1SSMA and we can see PA "candle by candle".

Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Now crossing on M15 also. Would this be a good setup you guys?

--- 帖子 #308 ---
I did enter.. up 15 pips.. i guess it was a good setup...

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Actually both....the charts that I post will state which one I am using.  The EMA setup gives a little faster setup than does the smoothed, so I am considering it the more "aggressive", for lack of a better word, set up.  But either works very well...whichever one you like best.

Good to see you, hope you have been doing well.

Hey Lawgirl!

Nice thread.

So, you are trading without price charts, huh?

What's next - trading with just a single horizontal line?

I love your thread and the simplicity of it!  Keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
If you are only 1-2 years into this business, then you are still a Newbie.

No offense.

I've been in the business as a trader for 11 years and I still find some value from the concept.

Basically, in this business, value is where you find it.    How do you know when you are doing it right?  When making pips becomes easy - that's when you know you have arrived at doing it the right way.  Until then, you are still in the steep section of the learning curve.

Again, no offense.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
And, what do the candles tell us?

Or, are we the one's attempting to tell the candles what to do?

Hmmmmm.  Just thinking out loud here that's all.  I'm trying to provoke creative thought - - something that I know Lawgirl would like.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Have a great weekend, Rebecca

I'm glad that you enhanced our H1 BO with this great idea.

I have to admit that now I'm feeling comfortable to trade without any candles.

I wouldn't have believed it 2 weeks ago...

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Hi Lawgirl,

Are you confirming the trades you are taking on the H1 to the H4 chart? Or do you enter on the 15M when you see the H1 set up? I'm just asking because I've noticed a lot of your trades on the H1. Thanks for your help! This might be something I can actually follow while I work  Sneak trade!

--- 帖子 #319 ---
First I want to thank LG for this very interesting system secondly.....

Only in EURUSD I made a killing......I also took GBPUSD and AUDUSD. Yes yes I know they are correlated pairs but what I do is if I want to risk 2% per trade I divide it between the pairs, of course signal permitted....

Hi LG,

Thanks for sharing.

You asked in an earlier post about alternative settings. Compare the following  with the 3/8/200 which you use. I was using this configuration for something else but it actually works very well when used in the same way as you use yours.

Gold, simple ma on close, period 2, shift 0

Purple, smoothed ma on median, period 2, shift 1

White, linear weighted ma on close, period 50, shift 0

I recall you use a trailing stop but the crosses on these work quite well for entries and exits. For example, see the nice move up on Friday end of session on AU H1.

A cross needs to be a definite cross (4 or 5 pip difference between the 2 shorter ma's) not just a touching of the two.

Looks OK on the M15 too but I've not tried the other TFs. The same rules can be applied as your original idea.

Regards, Paul.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
This is similar to what I use, though adding the 200ma for direction is a nice addition. I use a 3/7EMA cross over.

Since 2008 the Euro/USD is pretty highly correlated with the Dow Jones Industrial average. I use the same ma cross over there as well. As long as the Dow is long, based on the ma's I am long the Euro. When the Dow's ma's cross I am short. I use a very low margin and don't work with any stop losses. I just check it once or twice a Day. If it looks like there is a cross over on a particular day, I wait until the next day for confirmation. That's it. You could also use Bollinger Bands for trend direction.

Thanks for sharing. It is nice how many people are willing to share their methods on this forum.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Thanks, Paul.  I'm going to set up that template right now and take a look.  You use the 50 for direction?

--- 帖子 #328 ---
I like to pay attention the the dollar index, but have not paid attention to the Dow direction as it seems more erratic.  I will start doing that...thanks for suggesting that.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Here they are side by side, Paul.  I believe the EMA chart is easier to read.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Lawgirl,

I used to follow the dollar index fairly closely. After a while I begin to see a stronger correlation between the Dow and the euro/$. No relation is perfect or forever. The key is adaptability and flexibility. There does seem to be a strong correlation in all asset classes, except gold. Thus when the Dow is up crude oil is usually up, grains are usually up, and so is the Euro/$. Oh yes, the dollar index is down. Normally, it shouldn't work this way, but we are not in normal times.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
I'll start keeping an eye on the Dow too.  Thanks for this concise summary of the correlations.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
I have been using with some success the correlation "Market (Dow) up = Euro up...Market down = Euro down".

Great threads Lawgirl! Thanks for your observations, intelligence and sharing.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
HI All,

LG nice thread. thanks for the time,effort and sharing. Crossovers with least twist and baggage.

Puritan, Jolly,will check Dow out, I use the e-mini futures effectively for the same. The dollar index (inverse) lags a tad bit.

When this recent "crisis" began, all correlations fell apart. All went up and down together. When afraid, the markets move in unison. Changing relationships interpretation is prabably another art.

I've been thinking about this strategy over the weekend, in particular how it interacts with the 4 candle H1 BO strategy.

There are two things that bother me, the risk of picking up a false BO and the fact that we are jumping on the bandwagon AFTER the BO.

Every man and his dog can watch the period of consolidation, followed by a powerful PA movement outside of the trading range.  Everyone will be getting in when price moves outside the range (which is surely one of the reasons for false BOs?).

So, I've had an idea, which of course might be completely useless (I'm pretty amateur!), so feel free to explain to me where I'm going wrong if I've missed the boat completely!

OK.  So at the moment, we are looking for a period of consolidation/range bound price.  Then we look for a BO of that range (which is confirmed by the lovely north/south angles on the 3 EMA and generally a cross of the 3/8EMAs.

Let's say the 200EMA is up (so we have identified an uptrend), and the price is bouncing around in a range of around 35 pips in the hours leading up the London open.

Instead of buying AFTER the price has moved outside of the range, why not buy at the BOTTOM of the trading range?  The logic in my head is as follows:

1.  Presuming we have identified an established channel (i.e. 2 or 3 tests of the S/R) it is probable that the bottom of the range will act as support and the price will bounce off it, therefore our SL can be pretty tight (we are watching it bounce off support, there is no need to let the trade "breathe", if it's going south then we were completely wrong and best to cut it asap with as little loss as possible).

2.  We can place 2 separate trades (e.g. instead of placing one trade outside of the box for 0.1 lots, we place two trades at the bottom of the range for 0.05 lots).  If the price bounces off the support, it is probable that it will head up to the resistance at the other end of the range (we are expecting a BO after all!), if it does that then we are immediately in profit.  We close one trade once the resistance is reached and adjust the SL on the remaining trade to secure a small profit.

Now, the price will either breakout and run as we expected, bounce back off the resistance or, perhaps most importantly, break out but then retrace fairly quickly.

a)  If the price breaks out and runs, then we are miles ahead most other traders who will be getting in once the resistance has been broken.  Their initial buying frenzy will push the price up nicely to secure a decent amount of pips for our remaining trade.  We will have got in there early.

b) If the price bounces off resistance the worst it can do is trigger our adjusted SL, which will at worst leave us in a no loss position.  At best it may continue north after a minor correction, without triggering our SL.

c) If we get caught out with a false BO (which is the biggest killer with these sorts of strategies) we will be in the same position as above, we won't have lost anything thanks to the profit on our initial trade.

This seems to fit better with the sell highs and buy lows principle (e.g. why buy the high of the breakout?).

Clearly, it will be important to drop down to a lower TF to confirm the rebound off support (e.g. checking for momentum on the M15 for trading the H1), and surely our EMAs could come in handy here?  Confirming that the price is starting to turn in our intended direction?

Apologies if this is way off the mark, but I'm trying to think outside of the box here (excuse the pun!) and milk as many pips from BO's as possible, whilst minimising the risk posed by false BOs.

Comments or suggestions from more knowledgable traders would be most welcome!

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Some very good ideas here, FP.  I especially like the two trades suggestion.

Keep in mind that I see this as a better cross over trend trading set up than a BO set up.  I added the box lines to see if the two systems compliment each other and they do.

Looking at AUDUSD from last week, the cross on October 18 was a beautiful trend cross trade that turned into a H1 4C BO on the 18th and continued as a trend/BO trade on the 19th.  It was on the 20th that the conslidation began and the crosses had to be carefully watched to trade.

Buying at the bottom of the band would have gotten us in trouble.  I bought at the bottom thinking there was going to be a trendline bounce--and there was---but I was too early and lost 40 somthing pips.  Then on the 21st we had both a cross and a BO and it became a beautiful trade.

I like your ideas, but I think we have to look at the set ups not in isolation, but in relation to each other.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
I forgot the chart....

Hi Lawgirl and guys

Firstly what a terrific inspiration to everyone you are Lawgirl, your completely non-selfish attitude and amazing strategies you come up with and share to everyone is a wonderful attribute, many thanks and total respect to you.

I actually do have a question though, your thoughts possibly on something I have been studying over the weekend, you say wait for the trigger of the mas to cross on the 1hr tf and then change to 15m and wait for the confirmation cross on that tf, I looked back over this during weekend and first thing this morning (UK here) and the cross always seems to happen on the 15m tf well before the hr tf, maybe this is just an aggressive cross and we should possibly wait for a conservative cross on the 1hr first but my thoughts were after seeing the cross on the 15m, that is the trigger and for total confirmation wait for it to cross on the 1 hr before entering, thoughts?

sorry for the long windedness of this post

respect to all

Tom(UK)

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Many thanks for the reply LG.

Yes, apologies, I have initially been focusing on using this strategy to assist with trading breakouts after the London open, confirming a move away from consolidation. I find i'm making less mistakes by following the EMAs rather than the often volatile candles after open.

In case it is useful to anyone, I attach an EA which you can load onto your chart after you have placed a trade and instruct it close the trade upon the (re)cross of the 3/8 EMAs. I've found this useful where I've moved a SL to breakeven on a strong move, but can't watch the trade (i'm an attorney too, so you know how it is with meetings etc, nothing worse than placing a trade and then be dragged into a 3 hour meeting with no way to monitor the charts. I tend to sneak out for toilet breaks and check my VPS on my iphone ha ha!).

It's not mine, so I would suggest testing on demo before use!  I got it here:  http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...53#post3590553

Thanks for the kind words, doc.

Those vertical lines are lines I draw manually as a guide for evaluating the angle for myself.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
We've got to figure out why your ma lines are interrupted.  Are you using "None" for color instead of "black"?  If not, try it.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
You got it exactly right, Tom, the M15 cross occurs first.  That is a more aggressive entry, as you said and one can certainly be entered on the M15 cross.  But I like confirmation of direction on at least 2 timeframes.

What I meant by looking for the cross on the H1 chart and confirming on the M15 is, if the M15 is still heading in the desired direction we have our confirmation of the trade.  If it is not, we would not enter the trade at that time.

Despite saying I was going to get out of the market this morning after an early couple of wins, since this is only on a small account I figured the practice would do me good.

Spotted a lovely cross on the M15 for EURAUD which provided a nice entry for the steep EMA angles on the H1. Got out with 21 pips.

Then, for CHFJPY, an absolutely textbook bounce off the 200 EMA which had been tested a few times on the H1. Bought on the EMA cross on the M15 and easily bagged another 22 pips in 14 minutes. (I was almost tempted to trade the subsequent hasty retrace back to support, but thought I was being greedy!).

Sorry I can't put charts up at the moment, I'm trading on my VPS via my iphone, so it would be a real PITA. I'll try to get some screen grabs from my platform at home tonight, so you can see the setups.

So, that's 133 pips today (about 8% increase of account balance) thanks to some lovely clean charts, sufficient volume and the help of a few EMAs for entry/exit

Also, all of my stop losses have been between 1-2% of account equity, so good risk reward ratio too. I move my stops to BE as soon as the PA has moved a sufficient distance from my entry (which is anything from around 10 - 20 pips normally, depending on volatility).

Thanks again for the inspiration LG!

Forexpippy, did you take the cross-over on your 15m screen as an entry knowing that the H1 was trailing sharply down? And can and should this be done on other pairs? So many times I see the H1 in a trend and have to wait quite sometime for the 15m to catch up.  Other times it is just the opposite. Thanks and LG thank you also for your contribtions here and otherwise! Super system if I can ever be on the correct screen at the appropriate time. 66trader66.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
[quote=66trader66;5067267]

Yes, the 200 EMA was down and the 3/8 EMAs were in the 5pm position, running parallel to each other, i.e. a strong downtrend.

So I used the cross of the EMAs on the M15 to identify a good point to jump on board the trend (which was after the price moved back downward following a retrace).  The EMAs crossing on the M15 offer a good confirmation of this.

--- 帖子 #368 ---

--- 帖子 #370 ---
This is only on a small account for practice.  If I had serious money in there I would have stopped after the first trade of the day (which was over 60 pips).

I'm fortunate enough to be able to watch London open since I'm based in the UK.  This gives me an hour or so before I head to the office to set up all my potential trades etc.

Then it's just a case of monitoring the set ups.

In reality, all of the trades I took after the first couple are more risky because I'm trying to do my analysis on an iphone, and monitoring things during the working day - not ideal!  I can load up Oanda from my laptop in the office, so will probably start using that more (MT4 is junk anyway!)

However, I'm happy with one quality trade each day, and these charts are producing plenty at the moment.

Hi Lawgirl

Can I ask why you chose 4 one hourly candles for BO? Is it just something you have spotted on charts which makes this number of candles the best or something else?

Kind Regards

--- 帖子 #373 ---
I use the first four candles of the trading day to set S/R areas.  But I have also used all 8 candles of the Asian session to do the same.  There are some very successful traders who tell us not to trade at all during the Asian session because that is when the Big Dogs are setting their ranges.

But, I have found a 4 hour range to be about all that is needed to set the S/R area.   I do trade the Asian session,  due to my time zone.

This worked for me beautifully the last week.

I struggled with two different methods before this and watched my equity drop to half. Then after using this method, I managed to recover my loss plus a bit more now.

I find it is simple and clean. Not too many lines. Very specific too - if this happens, then do this. I am an engineer so I like set rules rather than  fuzzy logic.

Now, the only thing I have to be wary is anticipating the crossings. We always like to get the tops and bottom don't we?

The 1H is also good as I work but I can glance through every hour or so. Better still when I am in position after a cross. Then I can come back to it after two or three hours.

Nice. Thanks Lawgirl.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Thanks for adding this additional tidbit. I was wondering about the confirmation myself. Now it makes sense!

Now when you see a cross on the H1 and switch to M15 and the cross there already happened, do you still get in? Or do you wait for a better setup?

I was setting up the different templates mentioned in the thread and I couldn't get this one to line up.

update: SL hit at 1.3892

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Morning Guys

I have noticed a few posts concerning the 4 candle 1hr breakout, Staying within the context of LG thread I would like to say what I do, My metatrader period separator starts at 12.00am the start of the asian session, because I am in the UK, I an usually in bed at this time, with a 4x 1hr candle setup, the shaded area would finish at 4am, my trading day starts at 7am the start of Frankfurt/London, so I have extended my candles to cover from 12.00am to 7am so instead of a 4 candle bo I have a 7 candle 1hr break out, yes I sometimes miss a breakout during asia but I have to sleep sometime lol, pays good dividends if asia has a tight trading range and I can wait for a London session breakout, chart included

respect to all

I'm long in EURUSD.

I'm using my EA BuyFibo in order to partially close the order at BreakEven, TP1 and TP2 and go moving the SL.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Now closed 30% (Is a parameter) at BE level and moved SL to Open Price (BE).

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Closed EURUSD at BE.

Now I'm long in EURGBP.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Conditions are a bit wild today for this strategy huh?!!

I'm short in GBPCHF but it's not looking too healthy at the moment!

Might sit out until things settle down a bit.

EDIT:  SL hit on GBPCHF, 26 pips down.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
now long in EURUSD.

There's an established support rising with the trend on the H1, so I've popped an SL under that (the 3/8 on the M15 crossed about an hour ago, but the angles on both the H1 and M15 still look good, I think this one just needs a bit of room to breathe). We'll see!

Loving EURUSD today. Using the EMA cross on the M5/M15 to confirm yet another bounce off the H1 support. The price shot up quickly after I got in, securing 35 pips. The horizontal lines represent my pre-London consolidation range that I trade BO's out of.

Look like the market has now gone bananas, so that's me done for the day

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Excellent trading in a difficult market.  I love the clarity of your charts and that you go from the broad (H1 chart) to the narrow (M5 chart)...just like they taught us in law school....from broad to narrow....

Good day to you LawGirl and others it's been a while since i have not post on FF but was very much happy to see someone using MA like myself to me successfull, i am asking your permission LawGirl to post in the future which may help with current direction for the new traders rather than 200 MA and continue to keep the good work up these are two good MA cross 3 and 8 for early entry.

I think my entry was OK, however hitting TP was more luck than anything else, EURUSD dropped 100 pips in the 15 mins following my TP being triggered!!!  Could have been a different story if I had got in later.....

A good lesson in today's market though....always set a stop loss ha ha!!

I'm finding the 3/8 EMA crosses on the M5 cut out alot of the noise, which actually makes it useable as a TF for determining entries. Normally I wouldn't ever go below M15, so it's nice to have something that can give me "reliable" confirmation that little bit earlier when I want to jump on the trend at a more specific point.

I'm trading on Oanda's FxTrade platform today (simply because I can use it on my office laptop) and I must say, it's a joy to use compared to MT4, especially for this type of trading. Think i'll stick with this for a while and get a feel for it.

What area of law are you in LG (if you don't mind me asking, feel free to PM or tell me to bugger off!)? Just curious really. I do PPP deals (mainly intrastructure deals, anything from high speed rail to hospitals) for one of the globals, sold my soul to the devil in some respects, but I like it and get to travel a lot.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
I do injury law...what we call here, an ambulance chaser...although I am really no such thing....am very "picky" about cases.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
We use the same term here, although it's more as a result of prolific advertising by less scrupulous firms that have realised there is considerable margin in having high volume, quick settlement case loads.

I wonder how many lawyers trade? The education and training/experience probably helps with the volume of research and logic you need to apply to trading, but I doubt many find the time or can be bothered (one of the reasons I trade the London open is because all my research and chart checking conveniently takes place as I eat breakfast!).

--- 帖子 #403 ---
I would prefer to trade the London open, but that's midnight here, so can't do it.  I do start trading around 5:00 am and catch a couple of hours of London...still there are plenty of good trades during the US session and Asia.

I know several lawyers who trade and it's fun running into them because we can talk the talk.  I have tried to get family and friends into it, to no avail.  So, finding a "live" person to talk to about trading is a real treat.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Hey LG,

I am trying to recreate your exact template.... and mine does not look anything as pretty as yours...

have you got yours saved as a template so those of us who haven't got our own can use yours and change it to suit our own preference?

Matt

--- 帖子 #405 ---
I do have it saved and would be happy to share it, although you will have to tell me how.

I think it would be easier to save your own template however.  What exactly doesn't look like mine?

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Hey LG,

If I am completely honest, mine doesn't look at all pretty and pleasing to the eye. It does sound daft, but I like things to be perfect and if i feel good and i see my charts look good, i tend to be that much more "on point" when it comes to trading.

We all have our silly quirks, and this is one of mine - just like when i play soccer - i have to iron my kit so i look the part when i step on the field! lol Yeah... mild OCD comes to mind

erm to save a template, you would just right click on the screen and click save as and save it... i believe...

sorry to be a pain.

Thanks.

Hello michael

Those are the daily line boxes, they show the 4 candle 1 hr breakout, although I am not sure if my settings are the same as Lg's.

Aj

open the daily boxes and you can adjust the Start hours and end hours, depending on when you want those lines drawn.

in MT4, click "view", then "market view", the time as per your broker will be at the top.

In the Daily box, edit, adjust the start hours (normally set to 0, GMT) adjust it -/+ 1,2,3 etc depending on your time zone and when you want those to display.

End hours should be +4 of what ever you enter in Start hour box. This will give you a 4 hour box with the greyed box. You can play with it. It will draw the box to whatever time frame you want ie 1-23hrs. and +/_ GMT

The start hour is based on GMT

This is how I understand it. Hope it helps http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

Hi and thanks for the great thread.

There are some things confusing me, firstly about angle of the moving averages for entry (12-2 for strong up etc) - angle is determined by level of zoom so cannot be properly determined for moving averages. Also, because angle is not fixed because of zoom, why the need to scan 2 different charts at all or are you waiting for the higher TF bar close, some charts don't seem to indicate this? Just place x4 or x6 MAs on the smaller chart (on 5 minute chart place 3, 8, 18, 48, 1200), or am I missing something?

Secondly - the rules say that first trend is determined on the higher timeframe, then a cross of the fast averages, with confirmation then from a fast average cross on the smaller timeframe - that doesn't seem to be what people are posting as trades.

If trading 30 minute and 5 minute (say) and the fast averages have crossed they will 9/10 have already crossed on the 5 minute - and people aren't posting 2 different time-frame charts anyway.

Now, to me, confirmation means the following: Fast EMAs cross on the 30 minute which shows some kind of momentum, then drop to the 5 minute for the pull back and cross back and then cross again for the entry on the 5 minute - that's confirmation surely? i.e. it's pulling back to where you expect (source of breakout) and then the ma cross confirms entry on the 5 min, it's the same deal as using HA candles. Anything else doesn't make sense in terms of how the market moves and will likely give you big drawdowns before (if) going onside.

Hey, JPassion

LG will probably want to add her own comments, but I thought I'd try to answer your queries as best as possible.

That's definitely correct.  However, I've been using a form of rough calibration on my charts to determine what is a strong movement up/down.  I like the idea of having a defined range of movement for entry (e.g. 12-2), so once I have identified all my potential set ups for the day, I briefly turn on the candlesticks and adjust my zoom so that a long solid candle up (or series of smaller solid candles up) results in a 3 EMA angle of 12-2.  This means that when I turn the candles off and I'm keeping an eye on the charts from my iPhone, I know that and 3 EMA in the 12-2 position must have been the result of considerable momentum.  It's not an exact science (and we are using EMAs to replace candlesticks here), but it works for me and keeps me checking the charts for the same thing.

However, you are completely right, the angle can be changed by zooming in or out.  This should probably be put in the first post to avoid confusion when people notice that their charts vary from the ones posted here.

I might be missing something here, but I find the check against 2 completely different timeframes gives a clearer picture of over all trend/pattern and makes it easier to understand what the PA is doing.  Having a load of MAs on a small TF can be pretty confusing (the idea is to keep this simple visually).

Yes, there's been some slight deviation/experimentation in respect of the rules (people trying to make it fit with their own trading), which IMO will help people identify what works well and what doesn't, rather than 100 pages of everyone trading the same as suggested in the first post (which might be great, but there's always room for improvement and fitting in with your own style!).

After spotting a cross on the higher TF the reason for checking for confirmation on the lower TF was to ensure that the PA hadn't decided to move off in the wrong direction.  Obviously, unless you are sitting on top of your charts waiting for the H1 bar to close and actually see the 3/8 cross, then you might be a little bit after the cross and need to check things are still set up for a good entry.

Therefore I drop down to M15 and check that the 3/8 EMAs are pointing in the right direction, or there has been a recent cross....or if they are flat or heading the other way, I'll wait for the recross before entering, otherwise the set up becomes invalid and then I'll just move on to something else.

If the EMAs have crossed on the M30, showing momentum, waiting for a pullback might lose you the strongest part of the move.   This is obviously entirely dependent on what has triggered the cross and where you are entering.  For example, I use this strategy in conjunction with a breakout of a 4 hour consolidation range prior to the London open.  When there is a H1 3/8 EMA cross inside the box, I wait for it to have moved outside the range (however, if I'm also trading the range I will already be in after a bounce off support or resistance), check M15 that the entry is still valid (i.e 3 EMA pointing in the right direction) and then I'll jump onboard.  There's obviously a good chance there will be a pull back, but I'm only setting my initial TP to around 20-30 pips, so don't need/want to hang about for a pullback and miss the first move.  If it's a false breakout it will still often give around 20 pips, and I tend to re-enter after the first pullback anyway, setting a nice tight SL.

This is my own opinion, based on how I have been trading this strategy, so it might not be correct or indeed make any sense at all!

Ideally, M15 should had crossed with the direction still going strong when a cross appear in H1 as a confirmation.

I could be wrong but I think of it as this way, lower tf have a earlier cross, where as high tf have a later cross but with higher accuracy, think of higher tf cross as a confirmation

I've just seen I've put the word 'move' in the graphic. The word should be 'miss'

--- 帖子 #435 ---
That's a text book low risk, high probability entry. You're right, it is a much better entry than aiming for the bigger moves on the higher TF. I've found that such entries work better on M30/M5 compared to H1/M15 though.

I actually trade a slight variation on this (which I set out in a post much earlier in the thread), trying to keep to the low risk and high probability principle, where I trade the range during the consolidation in the lead up to London open (AUDUSD is great for this), buying on bounces off support, selling on bounces off resistance. This keeps my stops tight and whilst only netting 10-15 pips on average (per rebound), and ocassionally getting stopped out, it means I rarely miss the BO. And even if it IS a false BO, the fact that I got in at the bottom of the range means that I still generally net around 30+ pips, and then i'm perfectly positioned to trade the hook and subsequent run.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Hi thx for the explanation where did you get the template ? or what EMA's etc thx

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Hi

The EMAs are lawgirls: 3EMA and 8EMA, as I said, 3EMA on 30 minute = 18EMA on 5 minute (6x3=?, 6x8=?) etc. My chart is set up for trading 5 min. To trade other TFs with this method you will need to change the MAs.

Apart from that I just use pivots and a few things to make things easier to see on the chart - I'll post the template but please be aware that lawgirl likes to keep things clean & simple. These aren't magic indicators, they are just there to help me see, and to sometimes illustrate what I'm seeing,  and I don't advocate cluttering up lawgirls tread with magical templates and indicators.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
I've just loaded the appropriate EMAs on the M5 as you suggested, and then waited for the pullback on the M5 after a cross on the M30 (I actually missed the first one as you can see).

The chart is A LOT cleaner than I expected it to be!

Thanks, this is really helpful JPassion.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Nice one

As always the thing to be aware of is that it's exits that are the important thing. Sometimes you get get crazy R:Rs, a couple of trades this week have had stops less than 10 pips and returns of 40 pips and more. Last week, Friday I think it was, could have gotten 100 odd pips off the same kind of entry, (I closed for 35, risk was 8 pips), although, as I say below, getting your 2 or 3:1 day in day out is the way to go. I've made mine today. Now I'm done, and with the news coming out all day, just as well.

Make 1 trade get your 3% and done, out for the rest of the day. Make 1 trade and lose 1% and done you're out for the day. Don't over-trade. Why not continue to trade after a loss? Because it's highly possible you're entering a ranging market and about to take a beating, don't revenge trade. 1 winning trade every day or so is all you need. If you are netting even 3% per week and compounding weekly you're on the way to making more money than you'll ever need. So don't over-trader and don't be greedy.

I find if I'm trading off a pivot that 3:1 or the next pivot is optimum unless it blows through straight away, then I'll consider trailing. Waiting for MA to cross in the other direction for exit is a 1 way trip to getting a whipping.

See, it just bounced off R1 again. Had a job getting there this time and PA looks horrible but if you took your profit all was good. If you were greedy you've just had a whipping

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Hi LG and all,

I have gone through the thread and I have two questions:

- what is the stop loss level set when entering? I saw in one post that you use 4 pips, but in 15min or H1 tf it is very few. Did I miss something?

- what are the blue parallel lines and boxes in the graphics?

Best regards

EU pips today down quickly out quickly

--- 帖子 #452 ---
In terms of trading daily and weekly vs shorter timeframes - why are drawdowns bigger and profits higher? If you're position sizing correctly I can't understand how you come to the conclusion. If, at the end of the trade you make 3R you make 3R whether it's on the hourly, daily or monthly.

Where the longer TFs become more profitable is in the transaction costs vs the size of your win/loss as they tend towards 0 and of course if you are trading a large account and have to split your orders.

Spread betting - depending on which SB you're using you won't last long trying to trade on the m5, they'll put you on dealer referral if you start making any money, there is one with direct processing but the jury is out imo...and don't forget you actually have to be making money for tax to become an issue. Unless you are profitable the SB selling point is a moot one.

Pips on average per trade - it doesn't matter. Get out of thinking about pips imo.

What matters is how much money you took vs how much money you risked.

On the 5 minute I trade using daily pivots so that should give you an idea of how much you might expect price to move.  Did you make 2R, 3R, 4R?? I look to make around 3R or if price hits a pivot before that point and looks like stalling I get out at that point. If price just shoots through a pivot I'll trail the stop. If the entry is straight into a pivot I don't take it unless price goes through. If I lose, I'm out for the day.

Rebecca,

When you scalp down at the M1 or M5 may I presume you are just looking for the 3x8 at an appropriately steep angle?

Not really waiting for the end of the candle on M5 are you?

Forest

--- 帖子 #462 ---
That is correct...just the angle of the 3 and 8.  I like them straight up or down, which has happened often this week.

If it is close to the end of the time period, shown on the chart, I will often place a line and if when the time changes price goes below/above that line, I will enter or continue the trade, whichever is the case.

Note that that little line is a S/R line.

EURUSD: I missed the crossover at 0000 GMT and it has been rising like a hot air balloon. It certainly takes courage to jump onto the band wagon after EURUSD has gone up 100pips. And more courage after going up another 100pips. Finally went in long at 1.4121 at 1635GMT using the crossover method on the 15min chart. It was going strong so stayed long. Pulled out at 1.4215.

Wished could stay till the crossover turned down, but need to sleep...

--- 帖子 #469 ---
There's a pretty good reason for that line in the sand......the PA reach a point of resistance on the Daily.

I've stopped trading this strategy in it's current form for what I consider to be a sensible reason - we are using indicators to provide us with good points of entry, however for the most part our exits are being picked out if thin air. It's no good thinking "ok, my TP is about 25 pips and the closest support is 15 pips below so I'll place my stop just under there", when in fact, if we'd properly looked at all the S/Rs on all timeframes, we'd have spotted a great big Daily resistance only 10 pips above our entry.

Price is pretty much always going to stall at Daily resistance and will often reverse. Knowledge of all these S/Rs BEFORE we get into the trade will not only keep us from taking poor entries, but will act as amazing take profit targets.

The entry strategy works, there is no doubt about that. We just need to refine the exit strategy and milk this for what we can.

I made over 100 pips today easily on 2 pairs, just using the H1/H4/Daily S/Rs as staged targets.

Hi lawgirl21, thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
I'll post some indicators once I'm in front of my computer later tonight. They will show all SRs for all TFs on one screen, it's pretty much guaranteed to improve our exits

--- 帖子 #472 ---
I think 20 pips from a scalping setup is pretty impressive.

I believe traders have to determine their own exit strategies, whether its at S/R levels, set number of pips, whatever.  Exits, to me,  are the most personal elements of trading and involve must more than set rules.  What is a good exit for one trader may not be for the next one.

I am a follower of Bernard Baruch's trading philosophy about which he said, and I paraphrase:  I do not try to catch the beginning and the end of a trend, I just want to catch part of the middle of the trend....but I want to catch it time after time, after time.

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Hi LG

hope you are well, noticed how the system has changed or should that be developed some what, from being a 1 hr /15 m system concentrating on a 3/8ema crossover it is now a scalping strat, using 1 m and 5 m charts or is this just a separate strat with in a strat?

I personally use candles with the ema's and include the box breakout though I use 7 candles rather than 4, I am in the UK so my trading day starts at 7am gmt and So I use 7 x 1 hr candles starting at 12.00am finishing at 7am which covers the asian session and I use a London breakout from there. Although this week most breakouts have come within the asian session and I am unfortunately asleep then, because of the strong anti-dollar trend this week it has also been difficult to catch any real moves, My question finally was is that why you are scalping with this strat more on countertrends because of the blatantly obvious trends we have.

Sorry for waffling, hope I have made myself clear

respect

Tom

No, no, Tom, the system has not changed at all.  I just started applying it to the M5 and M1 charts because the market has been so crazy.  I  would have to look back, but I don't think I have caught more than one 40 pip move this week.  But moving to the lower TFs, I have gotten 10-20 pips multiple times.  It all adds up, but this week it's been making pips the hard way.

And because scalping is so fast, I am looking to the M30 chart to get the trend and trading both directions from that.  I do expect more pips from a trend trade than a counter, but even that has been upside down this week.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Thanks LG,

Yes it's been a ridiculous week trading, the trends have been so strong that it has been difficult to try and counter trend against them, and because I personally don't believe that the Euro is a true reflection of the currency at where it is now, I expect at any time for it to start falling and so I am damned to join the trend as it is now, I hate that fear aspect, anyway, will follow your scalping methods and try to pick up and understand what I can, you are a great inspiration and great trader LG

respect to you

I did 68 pips today.  Caught part of the big wave up and then I tried scalping on smaller time frames.  Did pretty well.  I like no candles.  Less stress to me and easy on the eyes.

Would OANDA be better than a SB firm  - no dealer referral ?

--- 帖子 #481 ---
I have searched for trades in higher Time Frames.

I'm long in XAUUSD. Currently +250 pips.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Whether they are better or not in those terms I'm not 100% sure - they are a bucket shop just the same. You hear very good things about them and also bad, whether the bad is always genuine I don't know - could just be a trader that guessed wrong again today and blew their account, therefore in their mind it's the broker playing tricks.

What I DO know about OANDA is that you can trade at whatever size you like - you''re not limited to a minimum of £1 a pip as you are with most SBs (I know IG does the 10p thing but it's only for a week or something). So in that sense OANDA is good for, say sticking £500 in an account and trading tiny lots in the live 'market' - that will give you confidence and experience that demo trading will not.

Then, as I say, it doesn't make sense to even think about an SB company until you ARE at the point in a year i.e. you are making money where you would have to pay tax. Beginners just starting out going straight to SBs and trying to scalp will have very short trading careers, most of the SBs simply aren't set up for it. If you want to swing trade, yeah you'll have better luck but again...until you are making money why go with a bookie?

Steve,

Do me a favour and post me your screenshot to my work email.

I understand where you are coming from with this. Rebecca's strategy is good, and I've been using it on purely the 5m chart, when the two ema's cross I enter for 10 pips and it's sound. But I've missed Out on so much more pips because I don't have a clear exit plan. Scalping is good but it is so hard to judge when to go in.

Look forward to the email when I'm in the office.

Hi LG..

I think 20 pips from a scalping setup are pretty impressive.

Agreed !!... Especially if trading multiple lots as I do.

I believe traders have to determine their own exit strategies, whether it’s at S/R levels, set number of pips, whatever. Exits, to me, are the most personal elements of trading and involve must more than set rules. What is a good exit for one trader may not be for the next one.

I would like to offer up one observation if I may. One of the biggest problems traders have is many do not have a plan on what to do once they get into a trade... "Trade Management"...Agree, they are a personal element, most definitely, but having a set of rules, even personal rules, will go along ways to keeping traders in the green.

Being a firm believer in targets, I am a big fan of S/R's. There are major S/R's and minor S/R's. The minors I call stall points, as price will stall and then continue on (hopefully??) The majors are targets, where price should go. Is there room to take the trade??  They are defined well before entering a trade. A trader who has a plan on how to manage their trade, once they are in, will hopefully not take themselves out to early.

It's very interesting that we hear so much on how we should define the risk as it relates to traders equity, how much one can lose on  given trade....Yet....there is very little talk, if any, on how a trader should define their profitability. What are the bare minimums needed to remain in the green.

The comment "That you can never go broke taking a profit" is very misleading and dangerous in the trading business. You "can" go broke very quickly by taking profits to soon. (Most traders do!!!.. I did for the longest time.. OUCH !!) This is a result of having "no trade management plan and exit strategy"

I also agree with Bernard Baruch's comments. But... contained within those comments should be sound trade management coupled with an exit strategy. Yes, this is the "personal elements of trading". I believe a sound set of rules in this area, even if they are discretonary will help traders become and stay profitable.

Just a personal observation..

Stated with respect to your ability to trade and the quality of your methods you have so graciously shared with us.

Very well stated TSD, and I agree with you, but I think different market conditions dictate different plans.  I have never relied on trailing stops like I have this week.  I have never been a scalper, but I did scalp alot this week,  and I enjoyed it, but stress level was up.

I haven't analyzed charts yet and wont until this weekend, but I am wondering if major S/R levels were honored this week?  I am thinking not, but it could be that I just got a little spooked by the market this week and decided to pull pips off the table "one by one" practically.

All I am trying to say is that flexibility is key and we each need an arsenal of entry and exit strategies for different market conditions.

I am using another sys But it is a bit slow flicking through the charts so I started to use this sys last night to quickly flick through to find any thing worth looking at.  This sys also gives a better entry I think.  With my  first try out last night I had a very good result.  up $218.86 on trading two micros  so that works out at a few pips. Not sure how many but if I change to mini lots that could buy the odd coffee down town.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
That is super!  Every trade will  not be a winner and scalping was not the original focus of the system...but hey, we roll with it...whatever it takes.  I am very happy about your success here.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Back in short here.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Hi LG

Most definitely agree LG. Different markets conditions require different trading plans. If one is not fully prepared to trade in a given environment it may be best not to trade. A proper trade management plan will give the opportunity to trade profitably. For example: You have been scalping the markets this week. 10, 20, 30 pips are reasonable and very respectable… Careful, it can become addicting.

I am a firm believer that markets always search, react and test S/R’s. The smaller TF just create more noise around these areas.

All I am trying to say is that flexibility is key and we each need an arsenal of entry and exit strategies for different market conditions.

Agreed! This is why your methods succeed. They have rules and flexibility. These are the hallmarks of profitable trading methods.

LG … I truly appreciate the opportunity to voice a point of view. Thank you again for another great trading method and an excellent thread.

I don't try to scalp , I'm just not good at it, and yes there are loses  I know I had 14 of them yesterday but 37 wins saved the day.   I use the one hour and 15 min with this sys.  the other one I am using is 4 hour but last night I came back every hour to have a look through using your set up, It paid off so I will do the same again to night. I will start 6 pm till midnight our time in NZ .

This method is very much the same as I used back in the mid 80's (before the crash)  only no computer then so ma were calculated on the adding machine. With daily data from the news paper. next I started plotting one ma and the two, all done on paper by hand and different color pens. Then I noticed that at the reversal there was a bigger separation between the two ma's then they would quickly close and cross.  So I started to plot this gap as a %,  after it increased and started to decrease by some thing like 3 or 4 % it was time to get off.   worked out very well on that TF  Not sure if you could use it this sys or not.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
On the one hand, this method is probably as good as any.

On the other hand I can't believe that any serious trader would take this seriously. Apparently, lawgirl trades for "fun" and not because she really wants to make money.

I probably need to read more of the thread but I think that's where the pic's with candles come in, etc., etc.

I probably just like to be contrary.

Morning guys, hope everyone is well,

I have never been a big scalper myself, but like LG says the market sometimes only offers you certain opportunities and scalping is one of those, I have been scoping the 5m charts and do see many crosses of the ma's so it has got to be the angle of the ma's which is the important thing here, it seems that 12-2 or 4-6 is not really enough, and so can now understand why LG enters when the angle is nearer to 12 for up and 6 for down, never 100% but what is in trading, it just offers another tool in your Arsenal and something to bear in mind, thanks LG

Hi LG, been reading your posts for about a week and into demo account.

Have some mistakes here and there but I guess this is what I've been waiting for.

Also, I'll say that my stop outs were about 60-70% but yet the net losses seem to equate the net winnings (50%-50%).

I also used a EA posted by a kind soul in this thread (can't remember the page), where the stop out will be based on 3 crosses 8 automatically. This will eliminate unwanted emotional executions.

I think this is my maiden or 2nd post despite registering in FF since 2 years ago; and I thought I'll just say a thank you for a simple, feasible and (hopefully) sustainable trading system.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
If you know how to read PA, then look at the majority of the bar formations that occur when those two MAs cross maybe you'll understand. MAs are momentum indicators as well as trend sonny Jim.

S/R - S/R is just a line or area that YOU believe to be S/R. Where is S/R? Is it at a congestion breakout (supply/demand imbalance), is it where price breaks out of a high/low, is it where there was a S/R 'flip'...all of which occurred in the past...or is it better to see what the market is actually doing NOW and place your trade according to that, not what you think about what happened in the past? Historic S/R fails just as often as it holds, you can't get two traders to agree where it is and the zones are so wide as to offer not much in the way of meaningful areas of entry. So shoot me down for going against convention.

Want to know where to exit? You either exit based on a statistical edge mixed in with your trade management (as I do for scalping targ 3:1 etc), or if you're swing trading you get out after a big move going your way. How big a move is up to you. How is this one: 3/8 crossover on H4 (where will this cross tend to occur? Weekly highs and lows), wait for pull back on M30 or H1 and 3/8 cross, Entry on pull back m/a cross on M15. Add positions on pull backs and recross 3/8 on M15. Exit on huge H1 momentum or 3/8 cross against on H1 or if it's an overall counter-trend trade, as you approach that 200 average. It's up to you how you cut it. Don't just do it. Test it first. Where is YOUR edge?

Old charts lie because we see what we want to see.

On another tip replaying to another post - 37 trades in a day? C'mon man! You're completely over-trading and on the way to the poor house. Get control of your emotions and money management.

Hi JPassion,  Is there a number of trades that one should stop at? I did 51 all up yesterday and put 18% on my pocket money live micro acc  so there wasn't any thing to get the emotions going.  Thanks for tip It got me thinking and I went back over the last few weeks and from the 29/9/11 to 7/10/11 on my demo acc I did 115%  on 13 trades, so it comes down to quality of trades not the quantity,  good point   thanks.  I must admit that did make me feel happy, so I will need to work on the emotion side if I do the same on my live acc.   Once again thanks for the tip. quality not quantity   right

I'm quite new to forex and am finding this thread very interesting. Lawgirl is using a Daily Linebox Indicator which I understand gives the spread of the first four candles of the day.

I have a couple of questions. 1. Could someone direct me to a post or article which explains the benefit of using this indicator?

2. I live in the UK so would I be better using one which gave the first candles for the London open?

Thanks so much to Lawgirl for all the work she puts into this thread helping so many people.

Digf,  look at the posted USDCAD chart above.  I have put a TP at that bottom support line, which is the BO H1 4C line.  It is acting as a barrier, if you will.  That is the purpose of the BO lines.

Now price may shoot through that line, but it is just as likely to be repelled by it...we just don't know.  If it goes through it, I will consider a re-entry.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Hello digf

The benefit of the indicator is, go to the 1hr tf and go long/short in direction of the breakout.

Go to inputs and put in the start time of 7.00 and end time of 11.00.

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Only USDCAD on the H1 chart.  Because I only trade/consider  3 pairs at a time...this is the only pair that looked to me like any longer time possibility/setup.  But I am scalping GBPUSD at the same time.  Staying out of EURUSD.

Trading systems/styles are not mutually exclusive.

Hi Digf

I am in UK too, what I do is use the 1 hr break out indicator to cover all the asian session from 12.00am to 7am, when we are in bed basically, so in the morning London acts as a breakout, this is just the way I use the indicator instead of covering just 4 hrs it covers 7.

Tradestar,

Actually, this is neither a scalping system nor a trend trading system. LG's brilliantly simple method consists primarily of watching two MAs on two different time frames. I used to trade stochastics the same way, but found them far too lagging for my taste.

Trading multiple timeframes is a smart way to trade, but you must constantly pay attention to the complexion of the market at any given time, as the market is constantly changing. You can apply LG's approach to any 'style' of trading including so-called scalping, depending not only on the market conditions you see in front of you, but on what best suits your individual personality, as well.

Greater trading experience will generally (hopefully) give you a more instinctive feel for how to trade any given market successfully, and most successful traders are able to change tactic as soon as they recognize that the nature of the day's market has shifted. Hope this helps.

Thanks LG, for your terrific insight, and your uncanny clarity. Very, very impressive. You are truly one of the great treasures here on FF.

Good trading to all...

Thanks!

now that's an Aussie!

http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=drongo

3. Drongo A person seemed to be, in some form or another, stupid. Drongo is a typically australian word and is part of common australian dialect.

"Pass me that wratchet you Drongo"

http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/drongo

The Australian slang is from a racehorse called Drongo (foaled 1921, retired 1925) which ran poorly, and by transferrance anyone slow-witted or clumsy became a drongo. (Reference: Bill Wannan, Australian Folklore, Lansdowne Press, 1970, reprint 1979 ISBN 0-7018-1309-1, entry for "Drongo", page 200.)

The horse was apparently named for the bird the Spangled Drongo (Dicrurus bracteatus).

Dear Mr. JP, I regret to point out that this admirable thread stated by LawGirl is about finding profitable entry points and not about Teaching  S & R levels etc. Your post here should be about what you find useful here and how you may help to improve it.

Your present post would be more suitable in Rookie discussion - it is there on FF, find out where it is.

In a previous post on Thread Price Action Trading with Indicators, you complain,"... I don't know why you keep booting me? What's the problem?. All I've done is post 2 trades I took? ", etc.

No one here wants to boot another but the irrelevance of your posts might have got you that response.

Similar remark I would like to make about your advice to other traders. You would make a better contribution if you ask relevant questions rather than advice traders who were most probably trading when you were not even aware of the existence of FX - I refer to your advice to babnz who from his posts seems to be well past middle age with LONG trading experince. How old are you ? Do not take my comments as "booting" - I have no right to do that.

To LG, apologies for diversion from main topic of Forum but this is in the interest of this excellent thread not going completely "out of the way".

Best Regards to All.

I think we are all feeling the stress of last week and the turmoil of the state of world affairs in general. It's good to vent sometimes, I know I have to from time to time.

But let's try not to get personal.  Let's stick with looking for ways to make pips. The reason I banned one trader from posting here this week, is because he got personal. I have no problem with criticism...heck, arguing is how I make my living, but criticism must not get personal to stay valid.

So, analyze charts over the weekend...or totally walk away from them and let's come back Sunday/Monday with fresh resolve to make money this coming week.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Congrats LG for your excellent thread: as wrote earlier, you confirm that this can be done on small TFs - before I used it for MTs only. Only one suggestion, try to keep out "professional advisors" : thread should be limited to discussing what is an outstanding sytem and not to show off one's own expertise with other systems of trading and also to encourage members to find answers from posts written earlier rather than just thumping out on keyboard every new tangential question that crops up in their mind. This will free you to discover other ways of finding entry/exit level rather than answering silly points. Sometimes I feel they write these question to "get" into your "good books". Also if some other reader answers any query raised by others, this should be OK : it would no doubt attract your attention if the answer happens to be wrong.

Enjoy a Good , Happy Week-end and come back to Pip-filled next week !

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Apologies LG, I was posting that chart from my home PC, which I use for studying charts when I get home from work, I didn't mean it to clutter the thread.

I'm still trading your method, still with only the 3/8 EMAs and still without candles.  The only difference now is that I have an indicator which plots faint dotted lines on my screen to highlight areas of past resistance/support/pivot points (primarily H4 and D1).

Your method is giving me fantastic entries, it really is.  Now I'm just focusing on how to ensure I get optimum exits.  Basically, I just look at the chart, if there is a well established H4/Daily SR near my entry then I consider this before I place the trade in terms of how this may affect the chance of my trade running into a brick wall after only a few pips, or indeed whether it might act as a good initial target.

I've found that many times after a great entry, I just watch the EMAs bunch up and flatline 10 pips away from my entry.  By placing the indicator on my screen I now often see an H4 or Daily resistance dotted line which makes me think "ahhh, that would explain it!".  I suppose it's just a lazy man's version of drawing SR lines manually, which the main benefit being that they are clear on every timeframe.

Sorry if my posts came across in the wrong light.  Just to be clear, I still use your method for my entries, and I love it.  And I'm still following this thread post by post.  I'm just using one additional indicator to help me pick exits, mainly because I trade while at work, so when I place the trade I have to also place my TP (in case I can't monitor it), so I need to be sure I'm picking a sensible TP.

I won't post any indicators in your thread, however I will keep posting my entry screen shots if that's OK with you (I'm still following the original rules to the letter).  You might just see a faint dotted SR line or two on my screen

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Well stated LG

If I may add...

The one thing I have notice here on FF... Many tend to let their emotions get the best of them. We see that manifest in comments made. They are based on a frustration of not understanding yet wanting to understand. (They just have not figured it out yet)

I know that many have heard or read that trading is 90% mental...10% method. I am not sure I can agree with the exact percentages but, I would guess they are pretty close. The emotional aspect coupled with the frustration that trading can bring can really bring out these emotional up swellings.

To all the newbie’s, wantabe's, seasoned pro, semi expert, expert, hobbyist, dabbler, technician, fundamentalist, programmer, PA Trader, Indicator trader, EA Trader, or " I have no clue what the &%*$ I'm doing trader " or any combination thereof....

Getting a handle on your emotions, it will take you a long way to being a successful trader. It took me a few years and more than a few $1000.00 to figure that one out. (Major OUCH!!) One's lack of control emotionally will blow your account apart faster that any method or system ever will.

The beauty of this thread, or any other thread, is to opportunity to learn (for free I might add). Concepts, ideas, methods abound here on FF. So much so it can be overwhelming which can cause frustration in an of itslef. What works for one may not work for another. Why? It's what's between your ears.. Your emotional make up and your ability to control it. Understanding this will take you a long way to finding what works for you.

Change your mind set to the positive, keep your emotions in check and you will learn more about yourself that you ever thought possible. This in turn will take your trading to a level you "never thought possible."

So sit back, take a breath, and become that child who wants to learn, where nothing is impossible with the right frame of mind.

Just my 1/2 cent

Going through all the pages just now has proven to me that "you can't put an old head on young shoulders'.

I am constantly reminding my patients, when they complain that a new treatment isn't working after 2-3 days, that very few babies have gone from crawling to running the 100 yard dash in 1, 2 or 3 days.

In the past 2 weeks I have undergone a very steep learning-curve and attitude shift while I have been learning how to drive this system by 'kangaroo-hopping' the D1 and H1 on a demo account;.

LG, this system absolutely fantastic!! I give you my grand-children's saying when anything is 'super-good"… 'Double thumbs up!'

Cheers!

Hi Forexpippy, great post by the way, I was just wondering if the 4h and daily indicator you were using was NB S-R 4H&D.

many thanks

With due regard to you, I would still consider your present chart an intrusion on the system of LG. She is trying to guide a lot of traders to a simple way of making money and your additions, shall I say, add alernatives that could prove costly when they fail. You have no doubt heard and know that all S/R lines are "lines in sand" : S & R lines are regularly Broken and how will you then help the traders who have taken a hint from your charts. Another point re. these SR lines, they ARE YOUR idea of what to expect from future - nothing guaranteed about it. Or is there some such assurance ? For example, there are some members with access to big Bank research who post SR levels that are, I am afraid to say, of better quality. If you have such a source at hand then better quote it to make your own statement more trustworthy. There are hundreds of Indicators and each derives all sorts of levels according to its own "idiosyncraziness".

If you are not posting what you think are "more helpful" charts for self-gratification, then the same purpose can be BETTER SERVED by simply stating in your posts that "Hey, Guys, I am taken such and such a position and I envisage a R or S at such and such level.This will be of immense of help to those needing such guidance. You should know that almost everyone who comes here already knows something about the market and is not totally dependent on what he reads here.

BTW, referring to your frequent repetitions that " LG, I am trading your system ...": You are not doing any favour to her by using her system, you are doing it because you find it good. So, leave it as it is, derive as much benefit as you can from it, but I think it would be better it you refrain from posting charts that introduce "other ideas" for fear of what I have stated above.

With malice towards none.

In interest of fair play because even too much information can be Bad !

Peace.

No problem, FP.  Please keep posting and no problem with the dotted lines (although it looks to me like they are just following our MAs).  We need your contributions here.

I have set my charts for the open of trading this week. We have had discussions over the weekend about S/R areas and yes, I believe they are not "hard and fast" areas rather they are areas we believe price may go, or turn from.

It has been true in the past that price likes to go where it has been before and seeks those levels. But this market is going to new levels both high and low, so there is not that surety, as it was in the past.

But still, as traders, I believe we have to look to those levels using trendlines, S/R lines, big round numbers....whatever the particular chart is calling for. You will notice that my GBPUSD chart calls for a pennant or flag trendline formation while my EURUSD calls for a downward channel. Had I stayed the course on Friday, my USDCAD loss would have been a gain, as price came right down to my TP...the support level provided by the BO line.

In any case...my three charts are ready. I have a "foundation" and know what I "expect" to happen...yet understanding that the market does not give a hoot about what I, or anyone else, expect.

You are right but I had that trade set up since last Wed. on a Daily chart. It took the faith of Job and the patience of an Alligator to catch that Fly.

I like to trade these pairs in tandem too and usually one other USD pair.  If they all get going in the same direction, which happens often, it's easier pipping.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Sorry to inform you Villlas but I've been an FX trader for over 5 years and there aren't many of those about. What 'advice' did I give that you take offence to?

Is this a discussion board or simply a board where we are all supposed to just stick charts up then say 'Thank you thank you thank you'  etc to the OP...btw I have NO BEEF WHATSOEVER with the OP. I don't see what your problem is?

As a matter of FACT, Dredding82 booted me from his chat room because he couldn't find my name of FF, I posted the question to his thread as I had no other way of communicating with him at that point in time, he then booted me off his thread because I asked a question about pivots that they had not considered before. Because it was a question about pivots he kicked me off the thread. We had a conversation, off-board and he said he would re-instate me if I deleted the post. I'm sure you will see from your detective work that I deleted my post but he never re-instated me to the thread. This tells me all I need to know about whether the guy makes money or not. You don't get far in trading with a hair-trigger temper. Am I bothered? No not particularly, I'm only on the board for fun, have lurked for years and am extremely profitable. No need to get into arguments with beginners.

I can also tell you, if you like who is who on this board and many other's, what people's real names are, who's a 'guru' on one forum who recently blew up on another etc. It's very funny is the internet. I have plenty of time for reading when waiting. You have a trader who 3 months ago was absolutely clueless on one board who within the space of a few weeks takes the learned method to another board and becomes 'guru' then vendor within the space of weeks. You then have someone, for example, who is a follower of James 16 and Joe Ross one week and then joins a couple of other forums and spouts endless, pointless drivel about TA and magical angles in mystical ways, painting lovely pictures, all in hindsight, explaining the past to build his drones. Is a live trade ever shown? Or a P&L statement? No, of course not! Blind leading the blind.

Lawgirl shows something that's so unbelievably stupid sounding that people turn up, who want it more complicated, criticising, but if they actually opened their eyes, put the bars on the chart, realised what was happening, then took the bars off again and trusted the averages, they could make money. Oh heck, I think I already mentioned that, that's something you take offence to!

If you take umbrage from any other 'advice' I proffered I don't really care. Go try scalping on 5 minutes charts with an SB for all I care. You won't need me on the other side of the trade driving you broke because the SB will do it. If it costs you all your money to learn the lesson because you don't want to listen then so be it. Sometimes life's lessens have to be learned the hard way.

My comments here about S/R were not directed to you or Lawgirl, so again what is the problem? They were in direct response to someone else wanting to incorporate S/R into Lawgirl's method. A method which does not use S/R. I KNOW what S/R is or isn't. The questions were rhetorical (look it up)! OK??

That's the problem people have over and over and over. They want trading to be complicated. Someone posts some simple method on a board and says 'look at this simple method, it works' before you know it 30 other indicators have been added, EAs are being written, people are changing it to make it 'better', make 'it fit them' and by the time the thread is done no-one is making money and you have a method that doesn't work.

I've been guilty of this a little as I showed charts on with something not in the method, for which I apologise, they were just things I use to help see and for illustration, as I stated.

As I see YOU are a great trading sage, please start posting something positive and instructional re the method rather than your drivel so far.

You also seem to be stalking me.

How sweet!

In fact.

F@ck it. I've never really posted on forums before. I make money and enjoy life. Thought forums would help relieve the boredom but I'll stick with my novels. Maybe you should try doing some reading too? In my 2 attempts to post anything, things that are actually of value I've been jumped upon for God knows what reason as far as I can see. I'll leave you all be, just carry on ruining Lawgirl's thread.

This is not an argument,, this is not a 'rant' it is a FULL AND ADULT RESPONSE WITH EXPLANATIONS. Do not bother replying, there will be no further reply from me.

And Lawgirl.

Carry on the sterling work. Maybe some day some of these idiots will see how simple trading really is.

PS, there seems to be some momentum in the market this morning, use it!

Happy pippin.

Have a nice day.

Not stalking you by any means - you misunderstand ! And your advice was not given to me - I was interlocuting just to preserve the good tone in this excellent thread. I thought you were imposing your way of trading on babnz - he is a very experienced trader and would know how many times a day to trade. He comes first time to this thread and gets "lectured" - I did not want him to get upset and leave. Nothing to do with me at all.

Your "tutorial" about SR lines was for someone quite another.. don't remember the name.

Good to know you are trading for more than 5 yrs - you have something to say but let it not be critical of how others do it.........

I seldom post - I have been trading on similar lines to that being advocated on this thread - have congratulated LG for giving me the confidence to use this for Short TFs - before I used it for higher TFs only.

That is why I want old traders to keep posting and not get spooked !! That is my only interest.

Not stalking you by any chance - just pointed out what could be done better.

Hope you have  a Good Day - I surely made you start on a sour note !

More pips to you.

--- 帖子 #587 ---
LG has stated that she is happy for me to post my entry charts with a few dotted SR lines on them, so I'll make the assumption that she doesn't find it as much of an "intrusion" to her system as you do.

I post my entries, I make no comment as to where I think the price will go. This strategy is a set of rules to provide traders with an entry edge, I'm not screwing around with any of the exit rules because there aren't any.

Prove costly when they fail? If you follow LGs rules of entry and the price heads in your direction then you'll already be in profit before you would even consider your exit point (whether it's SR/diminishing momentum/a recross of the MAs/the moon being at a certain position in the sky). How is that costly?

If you follow LGs rules of entry and the trade moves against you, you'll be stopped out. Having a few dotted lines on the screen won't change the fact that you would have been stopped out, so again, how is that costly?

I was under the impression that traders should be versatile enough to use a multitude of skills to assist in making decisions regarding entry and exit. Keeping SRs in mind is just another exit tool at your disposal, should you choose to use it. I wasn't suggesting that my subjective SR lines should be "The Rules of Exit" for this strategy.

Just a quick quote (key words highlighted in bold):

There is NOTHING in forex which can 100% tell you which way the price will move and for how long. That's why our tools are called INDICATORS. Even the cross of the 3/8 EMA is nothing more than an indication that there is momentum in a given direction, there's nothing to stop the PA reversing the second you get into the trade.

We therefore rely on probabilities. To discount SR completely in all circumstances is the same as discounting any other method available of determining where price my may move to, stall or reverse.

Self-gratification? I work 12 hours per day as a lawyer, trading when I can on my iphone via a VPS and posting on this forum when I get the opportunity. If you have a read through the relatively small number of posts i've made on this forum, you'll notice a common theme through all of them...I'm trying to be helpful and contribute. If my comments are misguided or not useful then I'm grateful to be told so by traders with more experience, but to allude to me posting for "sel-gratification" is quite frankly rude.

I agree though, I will be inclined in future to post where I intend to exit.

I've always been taught that you need to be clear on both entry and exit when entering a trade. All i'm doing is considering my options for exit. SR is is no better or worse than any other indicator to be considered.

I'm quite aware of the fact that it doesn't benefit LG that I trade her system. However, the more entry charts that people post (whether sucessful or unsucessful), the more it benefits this thread and the wider FF community.

I could quite happily read this thread, copy the method, make some money and contribute NOTHING in return (as i'm sure many people do). But that's not me. I'm trying to help.

I've read so much information on FF, some of it good and some of it absolutely useless. LG is one of the most competent trend traders on here and selflessly gives all her knowledge back to FF. As someone in the same profession, I know who hard it is to manage a career with day trading, so the fact that she also runs 2 hugely sucessful threads on here is testament to he willingness to help other traders. If you think my posts are anything other than me "pitching in", then you are mistaken. In order to keep a thread like this going, it needs participants. The injustice to LG would be if no one posted and simply copied her entries blindly.

I'll keep my charts as clean as possible because I do want to ensure that other traders looking at my charts can see immediately that I'm trading the same method as the thread prescribes.

It's also worth considering the boxes drawn on most traders' charts which depict a period of consolidation at the start of the trading day, upon which many use as guidance. These boxes contain a range bound PA in what many would view as a period of consolidation (actually, it's probably just a distinct lack of volume). Is this not another indicator which is unnecessary in light of the original rules? Is it not based on SR of that range bound PA?

This is one of the best threads on FF, I hate that I may have aggravated some traders by posting a few SR lines, that was not my intention.

But at the end of the day, it's a community. Discussion and disagreement are part of the learning development for traders and can often give many that "eureka" moment they have been looking for.

So, let's get back to these MA crosses and bag some pips this week.

I hope you take this in the light it was intended, which is nothing more that entering into a discussion about the relative merits of different methods of exit in a strategy which focuses solely on entries.

I wish you well in your trading this week

Morning Guys

This has been a busy argumentative thread over the weekend, I think anyone that contributes a suggestion, an indicator, an idea, is trying to help in some way, this is a community after all, this is Lawgirls thread and she is the person who should say whether contributions are good or bad, and to date she seems quite happy, if not I am sure she will say, I personally say thank you to all who contribute and negative fall out is the last thing we all need as traders, it is hard enough to trade as it is

respect to all

What you post is both correct and of practical use -support and resistance , for example, are a useful addition to the tool box of LG's method. It does not detract from the skeleton of her approach. It may even enhance depending upon the mindset of the trader.

Overall, I am sure TG would have said something by now if any post digressed too far from her approach or was clearly "off topic."

Hi FXPP,

Nothing in my post was meant as dispargement. You write : "At the end of the day its a Community". This is the most important concept.

People come to forums for 2 things : Trying to help, like LG and to find diversion from Boredom like many others. Whosoever makes a post does it to "help". Sometimes their understanding of what is required may differ from what is the best way to do this and hence the different viewpoints.

Re : I work 12 hours per day as a lawyer, trading when I can on my iphone via a VPS and posting on this forum when I get the opportunity.

YOU ARE LUCKY. Lawyer! I remember you referring to your profession in another post and having "sold, your soul" sometime in line of work !

Only I wish you guys - army of Lawyers - could mount a campaign in Congress to prevent the Admin from "blood-letting" around the world.

I will never have the time to make a long post like yours - I have too many interests : for some of these I neglect even trading which means less pips at the end of day !

Wonder what makes people in secure professions take to FX which is certainly "exhausting" biz. One guy said he does it for kicks ! May be  sometime you can tell me what makes you take to this.

Thanks for your wishes re. Good Trading. I wish you same.

Best Regards.

I work for a global law firm where my billable hours are generally considered to be more important than my health/life etc, hence the reference to "selling my soul".  I chose a path which is generally considered to be brutal in terms of how lawyers are worked/treated.  Corporate clients generally want the world and big firms are all to happy to offer up their lawyers as required.  There are however some considerable perks which (sometimes) make it almost worthwile!

I typed that post whilst sitting at my desk on a conference call with a load of Russian clients.  They seemed to be quite happy to converse in Russian for 2 hours without any translation for my benefit (this isn't uncommon!), but they will be charged for it, so I don't care!

It interests me, simple as that.  I've got so many hobbies/interests/passions, forex is just another one.  I don't need the money and have no intention to trade full time, but I like the learning and logic aspect.

Hi, LawGirl, what is the value of the white MA in your chart pls?

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Monitoring the price which is going to reach 200 MA can be very hectic. It would be nice, if we can setup an alert on the indicator to receive email or some sort of notification. Maybe, we should get an alert when the price hit 150 and then second notification for 200. Does it make sense?

Edit: Can use this indicator. http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...2&d=1199829344

Lawgirl - would it be possible to add the 15 min chart to the first post to show where it was/is likely to be doing on entry - rules say use 2 charts but 2 charts are not shown.

I used this strat yesterday fr a play, got over 100 pips on cable, 15 minute crossed, almost crossed on H1 at entry but both mas up, then because 4hr crossing up later on, decided to hold and gave it all back LOL.

Thanx

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Short AUNZ, may be a bad idea as daily range is already done.

H1 trade.

Can't post charts just now

--- 帖子 #632 ---
I'll do that, nunrgguy.  Knowing when to stop trading is something I still struggle with.

Stick with the original entry time period.  By that I mean if you are looking at a H1 cross with an M15 entry,  don't start looking around at other time frames unless it is a lower one, M5 or M1.

If you are looking at a daily cross (and there is a beautiful one on EURUSD right now) and want to enter on the H4 chart stick with those two or lower....not higher.

--- 帖子 #633 ---
thx

--- 帖子 #634 ---
I have entered these two pairs short on a daily cross.

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Nice charts you got there Bruce.

Is the trending indi "reliable"?   With due indulgence to LG, maybe you can share your template?  And bit background on how to trade it in combi with LG's nice system?

My goal is to get a good 20-30 pips only  =)

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Closed out for a small loss

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Lawgirl - those two charts you've just shown with the daily cross - are you trading daily and weekly or daily and 4 hour?

I can see why you'd enter there if you're trading the weekly as the weekly is about to cross/is crossing but if you're trading the daily it's going to come back up before a drop - 4 hour has been down for aaaaggggeeeeeesss?

They've not crossed on my charts on daily: due to broker time

--- 帖子 #638 ---
I used daily and H4.  There will be a tremendous drawdown, so I have both of these on demo....don't like that DD, but wanted to try that cross.

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Right, right...so why don't you wait for the 4 hr cross then?

Just trying to understand this.

You see, I see a potential trade there with the weekly crossing. Taking the trade there on the daily unless it's in the context of that isn't making too much sense.

--- 帖子 #640 ---
The cross on the EURUSD H4 chart happened Oct. 28 and on the daily Oct. 31.  I waited for the daily cross, but did not catch it as it crossed.  I still like the angle of the MAs so I entered.  Will see if it works out.

GBPUSD cross occurred Oct. 31 on the H4 chart.  Cross on the daily on Oct. 31 too.  Not as sure about the quality of the cross on GU.

--- 帖子 #641 ---
I like this. The pro of this method is it is specific. When it crosses, I long or short. When it crosses again, sell or cover respectively.

I'm using H1 to indicate a long or short. When it crosses, I look at the M15 chart.

If the H1 has crossed upwards, and the M15 has already crossed for a long, then I go long immediately.

If the H1 has crossed upwards, and the M15 just crossed downwards, then I wait till it crosses upwards, then I long.

Vice-versa for shorting. Sounds a bit like computer programming, huh.

So far, it works for me. Just need patience and not anticipate.

Thanks Lawgirl.

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Have you ever seen it not crossed already on the lower TF if it crosses on the higher?

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Something for you to have a play with here.

I put it on the higher tf chart and set the MAtf2 to the lower tf.

The way it is set to trade is to check for cross on current (higher) tf and then check the other (lower) tf for a cross or if the MAs are in pointing in the right direction to trade. It uses the AllAverages indicator for trend direction, so set to 200EMA, or there is the option to use SteveHopwoods Hanover filter based on relative strength (turned off by default).

Lawgirl,

Thank you very much for sharing this simple & profitable system.

In my opinion, this system + pivot points is all you need on the chart.

I am using the 1 hour and 15 minute time frames.

This system reminds me of an older MA cross system, bo7a.

Regards,

Pipguy

--- 帖子 #649 ---
I totally agree, Pipguy, but I don't think we even need pivot points because the MAs crossings act as pivot points for us.

Glad you are enjoying the system.

Is the trending indi "reliable"?  they are called indicators right.  I think of them more as  " probable direction / trend indicators" I use them with 60 to 70% weighting. I would not place a trade with them alone.

Yes the charts are nice and clear thanks to this way L.G. has put forward, just gos to show you don't need a chart that looks like a plate of spaghetti.

I don't want to jump on toes posting templates and indys on here. see your PM's

I've been having some pretty good results using the H1/M15 and M30/M5 EMA cross overs.

I've spoken to LG and she's happy for me to post the following attachments.

I use SteveHopwood's excellent MPTM EA to manage my trades once I have taken them.  I've attached the EA and Steve's user guide.  Please read it carefully and use on demo until you are comfortable with it.  It has many useful features such as being able to partially close your trade at X pips and then let the remaining lots ride out the rest of the move with a trailing stop in place.

The EA will hopefully save you having to watch all your trades constantly.

I was also struck by the irony of the fact that he says your system here is too basic or too unreliable, but in one of his own threads he's claiming to turn 1000 into 13 million within a year.  Here's the post where I set him straight,  Enjoy:

First of all, thank LG for that great, simple and efficient strat !

--- 帖子 #664 ---
I was experimenting with MPTMs settings today, here's the results of the trades I posted earlier:

GBPUSD - 50% of trade closed at 15 pips, then SL was moved to breakeven with a jumping stop trailing the remaining 50%. PA eventually reversed and took out my SL, leaving a 2 pip profit.....total of +17 pips.

USDCAD - trade moved against me quite quickly and took out my SL.....25 pips loss.

EURGBP - 50% of trade closed at 16 pips, then SL was moved to breakeven with a jumping stop trailing the remaining 50%. PA soon nosedived and took out my SL, leaving a 2 pip profit.....total of +18 pips.

Total = +10 pips.

Lessons learned:

Firstly (rather annoyingly), I broke my own rules by trading the only losing trade, USDCAD. I had decided only to trade GBPUSD and EURGBP at London open.  I also entered slightly sooner than I had planned, another mistake. Big lesson learned....stick to the plan! However, my stop was only 1.2% of my account balance, so it was a minor loss.

Secondly, I need to play around with MPTM's settings. I had originally wanted to close 50% of the trade upon the first profit target of 20 pips being reached (the jumping stop point), not at 15 pips (the breakeven trigger). Should be easy enough to correct.

Thirdly, closing part of the trade at my intial profit target and letting the rest run with no risk of loss is working well. I secured the pips from the initial move (which, based on my analysis, was the most likely profitable move), and then I had some lots still in play had the PA continued in the right direction, taking advantage of a bigger move. However, despite the fact the PA quickly reversed, I still have my initial pips bagged and the 2nd trade closed for no loss. I may consider changing the intial TP to 75% and letting 25% chase the bigger moves.

Finally, it's MUCH better for me to have MPTM manage my trades. Once I've placed them I just foget about them. I've planned my trade and MPTM makes sure I stick to it.

Had I stuck to my rules as intended (and correctly set MPTM to close the initial profit at 20 pips), I would have finished 42 pips up (which would have been 3% of account balance for a total of 2% risk). As it stands, I was still profitable today, but it's a good lesson learned in respect of sticking to my own rules!

You have to let it pull back to some kind of supply/demand area before entering (yeah..I know...just saying) unless you just want to use huge stops and 2:1 3:1 etc. It's pulling back to around 8329-8580 area maybe.

Same deal with CAD. Yes first trade was out with a small loss, it's going back down further but my stop is not down at 9892. Reason I got in where I did was some momentum on M30/H1 but the market has other ideas.

--- 帖子 #669 ---
It's still giving a valid short signal on the daily, but that little crook in the 3MA...representing a pullback...was over 100 pips.  .

Nice scalping opportunities this morning.

--- 帖子 #674 ---
Dryclean, I've not used the Easy Order EA before, could you clarify something for me.....does it allow you to set your risk AND stop loss, then it will place a trade of the correct lot size?

If so, that would be very useful to me.

However, if it simply places a SL at a point which is equivalent to the level of your risk, then that seems a bit backwards.

--- 帖子 #675 ---
Nice BO today. SL +80 pips secured.

Excellent pipping, maudur.   And... you are keeping it simple.

I believe it will do that. Read post 1 of the thread.

I use it for Stop orders and just move the SL around. Plus I let updatestops ea run things too. Play on demo

--- 帖子 #679 ---
Easy Order is a Script.

It is given in mql form so you can go in and tweak it.   It is an effective but simple tool, not totally customizable as it is designed to do a basic function.  But what it does it does well.

You can set it to place trades based on risk or set lot size.. Market orders , Limit orders , buy/sell stops..

Once on the chart it can be managed by a Trade management EA or you can just click on the lines and move stops / TP's on the chart.

works very nicely.

My First trade on this system.... any comments are much appriciated......

Thanks LG.

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Hey sprabhu, welcome to the thread.

The thing to remember with this strategy is to start by checking the higher TF and then checking for confirmation of the lower TF.

So, if you check your H1 chart, you'll see that the last MA cross was actually signalling a long position.  There's a clear sell signal on your M15 chart, so you've just jumped the gun slightly.

Wait for the H1 MAs to cross and THEN check the M15 for a cross in the same direction.

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Look for the crossover on the H1 chart first...then go to the M15. We are looking for 2 crosses when we enter.

Since you entered on only the M15 cross, move to a lower TF to monitor this trade and don't  expect as many pips on a lower TF entry.

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Thanks for responding, FP.  I really appreciate traders helping other traders.

Yes you are right, however I was over confident because it was a triple top (3rd reject on 1H), & also the 200 MA resistance.

Going forward will follow the system strictly

It's nice of you, LG to mention this. The other day one member shouted down another who  tried to advice on the post of the former. So, I was wondering if it would be OK to comment on others !

--- 帖子 #690 ---
Yes, LG ! This is what I like best about FX - if one misses a Bus, he does not have to wait long, another one is on the way soon.

What I would like your opinion on is : Is it worth it - using Auto-trading EAs ? Some Mega-traders specifically DO NOT use it - one glitch and Poof ! But then I see people trading Micro-lots (10 cents per pip) and  think nothing makes a diff then whether one makes a 1000 pips a days or loses them !

Have a Good Day - Pip-wise and Fun-wise !

Excellent trading, WT. The move may not be over yet.

--- 帖子 #703 ---
I hate to ask you how to set this up, but can you show us a screen shot of the set up, Mike?  EAs are really confusing to me.  Does it take the trade for us, or just manage the trade?

--- 帖子 #704 ---
Confused as well on how to use the EA.

Anyway, is there a EA that can manage our open trade/s and close it for us if the 3EMA x 8EMA opposite our trade?  So, when we open a BUY trade based on 3x8 bull, we will just let the EA babysit the trade for us then close it when 3x8 bear happened (on m15, or other TF we specified).

Of course the idea of phasing our close trade as how MPTM is great too, although I have yet to fully grasp how it works.  =)

To bail or not to bail. Price seeems to respect the MA's like a form of dynamic support and resistance. Problem is with the short time frames sitting and having to babysit your trade or getting away from the tube bailing and taking PIPS...how many times does it continue to go in the direction of your trade once you close it. I think your way of managing the trade on the higher time frame might keep me in more often than not than bailing out early.

Here's how my chart looks:

TimeFrame- 15m

BLACK - 200EMA

RED -  32EMA

GREEN - 12EMA

GOLD - 8EMA

WHITE - 3EMA

BrokenBlack - 1EMA

Basically, I have the 3ema and 8ema on 15m timeframe.

Instead of shifting from H1 to m15 tf, I use the multiplier 4, therefore the  12ema and 32ema is the 3x8 for H1 timeframe inside the m15 charts.  When GREEN is over RED ma, it shows bullish sentiment, and vice versa.

Question, do we use the same 200EMA for m15 and h1 charts?

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Yes.

There will be instances where the H1 has a long bar up already and the averages have already crossed upwards. But towards the last 15 mins of the hour, it is creeping down. So, looking at the 15M, you'll see that it hasn't crossed upwards.

--- 帖子 #715 ---
Ouch, closed with -24pips

--- 帖子 #716 ---
I was under the impression that simply multiplying the period was not completely accurate?

There are many Multiple Time Frame (MTF) indicators available on FF which allow you to display a "true" MA from one time frame on another.

I've used them and whilst they do work, I actually prefer to switch between time frames since it gives me a better overall picture of what's going on (e.g. looking at M5 can be a bit deceptive in respect of the bigger picture!).

--- 帖子 #717 ---
What a beautiful picture......

You're not the only one. Trading the GBPUSD tonight is not for the faint of heart. (Can you say, "Sybill?") In my case, I took a short nap and woke up 33 pips poorer. Thank God for SLs. Am short again from 1.5937 and believe it will bounce again around 1.5911 . I may be wrong and totally delerious, and it wouldn't be the 1st time. As I write this the Cable is reaching for the stars and my SL. Stay tuned.

--- 帖子 #719 ---
Jumped in on 4 trades today.

The eur/usd at 1.37434 and 1.37423.

The cable at 1.59376 and 1.59383.

The time was 09:13am UK time on the 1H chart when the 3EMA crossed the 8EMA.

I collected 20 pips on each trade, so 80 pips done this morning.

I looked at the M15 time frame to make sure the two EMA's were heading north in the same direction.

--- 帖子 #720 ---
Yes

worked pretty good last night for me 2 winning trades still going. I will let them run to see what the bot will do and how will exit

--- 帖子 #721 ---
It seems to open the trades as per the rules in post 1, but looking at the code I don't think it will ever close the positions with the default settings.  You either need to active one of the trailing stop functions, or change "Close On Opposite Signal" to true - or do both.

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Stuck to the plan today, so that was the first and most important success!

Entered GBPUSD upon H1/M15 EMA cross (as shown in the charts I posted), followed by EURUSD a short while after on the H1/M15 EMA cross.

I'm still using/experimenting with MPTM to manage my trades once I've opened them because (a) I can't be in front of the screen all the time to monitor my trades, and (b) I can't be lured into deviating from my plan since it's out of my control!

EURUSD: 70% of trade was closed at TP1, locking in 22 pips. SL was moved to breakeven and then a 20 pip trailing stop followed the remaining 30% of my trade. The remaining trade was eventually closed for a 42 pip profit. Total pips = 64

GBPUSD: 70% of trade was closed at TP1, locking in 17 pips. SL was moved to breakeven and then a 15 pip trailing stop followed the remaining 30% of my trade. The remaining trade was eventually closed for a 43 pip profit. Total pips = 60

Total pips today = 124

Total increase in account = 3.2%

I'm still trying to find the sweet spot of where my initial TP should be, how much of the trade should be closed at that point, and how big my trailing stop should be on the remainer of the trade (and if I should use one at all).

However, for me, it certainly seems sensible to close the majority of the trade at around 20 pips, since from looking at the charts, the H1/M15 EMA crosses seem to hit this level fairly consistently as a result of the momentum being carried.

--- 帖子 #723 ---
I agree but Steve and the gang are working on a hidden SL TP in the bot to fool the criminals(brokers). Maybe Mike could explain exits

--- 帖子 #724 ---
Where the EA will differ from manual trading is with the use of the 200 EMA.  If I interpret the rules correctly it's "all about the vibe" on the 200 EMA, where as the EA is only taking trades in the direction of the long term moving average.  So, it only took the GBPUSD trade an hour or so ago, not the EURUSD one that forexpippy refers to.

--- 帖子 #725 ---
This is where an EA will always differ from the trader's own view though.

Look at the 200 EMA on the H1 for EURUSD.

Going by the 200 EMA alone (which the EA must do), is the trend up or down?  Try zooming in and out of the H1 chart, then ask yourself again, is the trend up or down?

What period should we use for deciding whether the trend is up or down?  3 days, 5 days, 2 weeks, a month?

--- 帖子 #726 ---
Yeah I know, that's why I was pointing out the difference.  How the EA is coded at the moment it is looking at the long term average in a very short term way.

--- 帖子 #727 ---
Everyone......I've started another thread for the EA.  Please post EA information there.  Those of us who are interested in using an EA will monitor that thread also.

Relatively good news for dollar, a rate cut usually drops the countrys currency involved eg Europe rate drop, bad for Euro, good employment figures for US also today, next news in 20 mins or so the ECB press conference, 1st conference for new ECB president Mario Draghi, so might move markets if he makes a statement

For starters, as LG mentions herself in the first post, counter trend trades are also proving to be good for securing pips.

However, more to the point......do you think, based on the 200 EMA on the H1 for EURUSD, that it's in an uptrend or downtrend?

Is your answer the same for 31 October to present as it is for 30 September to present, or indeed for 8 September to present?

Determining trend is very subjective, even when everyone is using the same EMA. In my opinion, I can see the market ranging for the past couple of days, on a downtrend for the few days before that and on an uptrend for the month before that. So, using the 200 EMA doesn't really help me much in this instance! Therefore I took the view that as a result of the market ranging in the past few days, it could go either way.

--- 帖子 #739 ---
CT trades(using the 200 as a reference point work well on lower time frames as well) How hard price is pushing and 00's and 50's also have bearing. Hard fast rules are usefull guidelines but IMHO you have to be able to dance when the music starts regardless of how ugly she is.

No problem.   Trying to spot an "established" trend is a dark art, and even when you think you've got it nailed, the PA moves off in completely the opposite direction!

The EMAs are about as good as we can get to keep this method consistent and simple, but it's a very rough indication, especially when price has been all over the place, like with EURUSD.

Hi FP

Dead true about trying to find an established trend, cannot remember the markets being this choppy, just when you think its going one way it just suddenly changes and goes the other, I was short on gb/us 10 mins ago after ma's indicated short and now I am 40 pips down, crazy, the brokers must be rubbing their hands

Tom

--- 帖子 #748 ---
Agreed choppy to say the least. I gave up other pairs except EU because it seems to be the less erratic as far as price action and predictability. I only trade a couple of hours during the NY session. I went through a few accounts on my learning path and am still hangin in there. MA systems are simplistic and LG's threads always seem to remain positive and she won't let them disinigrete into the crap pile like most of the rest do... so you have good support here. Hang in there and be patient at the bus stop.... the next bus will come along and take you to Pipville.

--- 帖子 #749 ---
Thanks Wavetrend

The volatility is incredible actually on every time frame, predicting anything is nye impossible unless I am missing something, this is where discipline comes in though and sticking to trading plan, I almost exclusively use Rebecca's ma's now with a s and r thrown in, I went short on gb/us but now after the fact noticed the bounce off the 200ma on the 1 hr and 15 m tf, so slap wrist for me, but the wave down was so strong and ma's showed clear down so thought would break through, never mind, trends seem to go out the window at present, good pipping to you my friend

Hi Lawgirl,

Good to see another thread from you and that too using MAs. many times MA systems are looked at as culprits for loosing money. The fact is that many traders (newbies particularly) rely only on MAs and mostly the trades go wrong.

I think this would be an exception among the systems using MA crossover. I think this could be a successful way of trading...for those who trade with patience.

I am a silent fan of your BO system and would try this one too.

I like simple thing so I'm using similar (scalp) method as "lawgirl21" in this thread:

MA cross HMA on M5 chart as you can see in image

MA setup:

period=8

shift=1

MA method=Linear Weighted

Apply to=close

HMA setup:

period=55

method=3

price=0

you can use in any time frame but I found it is most profitable in M5

--- 帖子 #761 ---
Are you using HMA Color + Trend or Cross HMA & MA + Trend ?

who took the short in eur/usd at the 1hr/15 minute timeframe 5 minutes ago?

--- 帖子 #765 ---
It would have to creep down a LOT to take those averages back over...

Generally what happens is that the 15 minute averages are crossed and up whenever the hourly averages are first crossing, they have to be due to how averages work.

Am I right in thinking here that you are waiting for a close of that hourly bar before entering? I didn't think bars were part of this?

Another thought, considering angles of MAs - are people just using the 3 or both the 3 and 5 to determine angle? (i.e. both the 3 and 5 have to be 4-6 O clock etc?)

I didn't take my usual GBPUSD or EURUSD trades at London open this morning due to big news events.

Found it quite difficult to stay out of the market until after NFP since there did seem to be quite a few set ups.  However, I'm glad i did!

This is my only trade of the day.....EURUSD (sorry I couldn't get my charts up earlier, was on the move when I traded).

Closed 70% of the trade at my initial TP for 31 pips profit.

The added a 20 pip trailing stop on the remaining 30% of the trade, which, thanks to a quick reversal, also stopped out for 31 pips profit.

Total increase in account balance: 2%

Anyway, a good result in terms of the trade, but even more of a success for me personally that I managed to stop myself pressing the trigger on any trades prior to the news and waiting for more reliable indication of the direction of PA.

Hope everyone has a great weekend.

That's great news!  What a week though, will be nice when things start tending again!

--- 帖子 #787 ---
This was in the first post:

(Note: If you are trading from a higher TF as an H4 chart, you would use the 200 EMA on that higher TF to determine direction.)

What does the 200 stand for?  Minutes? Candles?  For example in the H1 time frame if I use a moving average period of 15 does that mean 15 min or 15 hours?

Looks like you can use any number for this moving average but for the EA you can only use the timeframes of the charts, i.e. 1m, 5, 15m, 30m, 1h, 4h, 1wk, and 1m.

So if you are in the 1h chart your EA could get the averages for only those enumeration timeframes but you can drag a moving average onto the chart and use any number but why would this number be different on other TFs?  or rather why would the trend line be different at 200 on the hourly chart as opposed to the weekly?

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Hi vigilanti,

look at http://ta.mql4.com/indicators/trends/moving_average .

If for example you are in the H1 timeframe. Then the 200MA means the average value of the last 200 hours (candles).

see you and nice weekend

Hope this helps:

What does the 200 stand for?
http://www.forexoma.com/how-to-use-m...forex-trading/

Trend lines are subjective to the person placing them on the chart. It signifies a rejection of price in either direction. Usually you look for multiple rejections to base your trendline on. Bouncing off or breaking through these lines can signify a trade opportunity.

There are equivalant moving averages for different time frames so you could use those equivalants and place them on one chart instead of jumping back and forth between chart time frames.

There is a separate thread for the EA for this method which LG started.

I think you are confusing chart timframes(the representation of a candlestick or bar for that particular time frame) with a moving average which represents price over a specific period.

With all said and done these are indicators and guides for buy and sell trading decisions but by no means always indicate absolute price direction at any given time.

--- 帖子 #790 ---
That's an interesting system Lawgirl21 - with no bars/candles.

I'm not sure as what the rule may be for the entry - do we wait for a cross to be confirmed by waiting till the end of 1 hour period on hourly charts.

I didn't want to show any disrespect for the system by displaying the bars, only trying to make my question easier to understand.

For example last 2 signals on EURUSD hourly chart (both strong crosses): if we wait for the candle close in the first case it's around 50 pips from the SMMA and in the second case there is around 60 pips from the SMMA. The momentum may be strong, but after that sort of move I would usually expect some sort of retracement and it we were to place stops bellow SMMAs that may severely affect r/r?

Or is this wrong? Do we jump in straight away - in this example as soon as we see the strong cross on hourly, we check 15 minutely chart if there is a cross there and if yes we go for it.

Is there a danger for cross to be undone in the meantime if we try this approach?

Regards

DR

Lehmann, thanks for your great testing, maybe I am slow, but I don't understand the exact rules you used for the 15m-1h tests.

Do you use 3/8 MA crossovers on the 1h TF or on the 15min TF (using the 1h TF as your main direction)?

Sorry for having to ask for clarification.

Thanks,

Any idea?

Anybody?

--- 帖子 #797 ---
Hi DR,

Strictly speaking, you should wait for the close of the period for confirmation that a cross has occurred, particularly in respect of the higher TFs. As you correctly pointed out, it's entirely possible for a cross to occur in the middle of a period and then reverse.

You are also correct that confirmation of the MA cross might occur at the end of a large move, leading to a frustrating retrace just after you have entered the market.

Unfortunately, there is no way around this issue, especially on the higher TFs. The MAs show PA, and are great for indicating where there is (or indeed, just has been) a lot of momentum in one direction. However, such momentum is often followed by a pause or retrace in PA.

We're not aiming for a 100% strike rate here, just playing the odds that a strong cross of the MAs will more often than not carry sufficient momentum to bag us some pips.

This is where checking for confirmation on the lower TF is useful. Once you spot a cross on the H1, drop down to the M15. What are the MAs doing on the M15? Are they still indicating a strong move in the original direction of the H1 cross, or are they wavering slightly?

On the higher TFs (H1 and above), it's entirely possible that you could miss the majority of the move by the time you get a confirmed MA cross. Based on the method as described in the first post, you may have assumed that you would have a positive expectancy by trading all confirmed crosses. My own personal opinion is that's not correct.

Stick to a limited number of pairs to begin with and watch them closely. Become familiar with what makes them move, how big those moves are, how big the retracements are and when they occur (for example, market opens, news events, days of the week etc). Get a feel for what those "good" crosses look like and what the lower TF confirmations look like.

I know that this is not what most people want to hear (i.e. that you can't just trade an MA cross and become a millionaire), but it's not that simple. The more familiar you are with the pair, the more you will benefit from the MA crosses in my opinion.

The other dimension is in respect of where your stop loss orders and profit targets are. Generally, the higher the TF, the bigger the stop needs to be (and therefore the higher your profit target). So, with that in mind, you could try trading the M30/M5 until you get a feel for how the crosses work since by fine tuning your entry on the M5, your stops can be very tight indeed (I rarely use a SL bigger than 15 pips when trading the M30/M5). This way, if you have missed the move and you get stopped out, your loss is much less, and your profit target can also be smaller. That said, there are more whipsaws on the smaller TFs! That's this style of trading for you though, it's all about finding that balance between good confirmation and not getting in so late that you've missed the party.

Personally, I would stick to M30/M5 for a while, the markets are a bit wild at the moment and the "safer" pips seem to be on the lower TFs with smaller profit targets. Once the markets start trending more heavily, the higher TFs will be a more attractive option.

I have found tht the PriceBar Clock is very helpful to use for entries. I also often draw a marker line ...my "line in the sand" to get a clear visual of PA...like on the chart below.

--- 帖子 #801 ---
Notice how the PriceBar Clock and the "sand line" confirm downward movement..at least for this point in time.

--- 帖子 #802 ---
Hi Lawgirl21.

That's a good idea - 'sand lines'.

If I understood correctly in this case I keep observing the 15 minute period chart. As soon as I see the cross I keep a close eye all the way till the end of that period. Then at the end of that particular 15 minute period I draw a line that represents the level of the golden SMMA at that point of time (that should be the entry point as well)

Thanks for sharing.

Best wishes

I am beginning to think that the Asian Market indicator is a better breakout guide these days than the DailyBoxLines, which mark the first four hours of the broker's session.  Asian indicator is more conservative and there are some very good traders who claim that the Big Dogs are setting their trading parameters with the Asian session.

--- 帖子 #811 ---
It's working very well actually. It seems to work well with this strategy because ideally (for me anyway) you want to secure some profits, move to breakeven and then chase the bigger moves.

Closing the whole trade at initial take profit means you will always miss the big moves.

Leaving the whole trade open to chase big moves means you are more likely to get stopped out.

But partially closing means you get a balance of both worlds. The EA helps pick logical points for those partial closures.

In addition, the auto lot sizing in relation to your predefined risk and stop losses is a great feature (saves me having to input all the figures into a web calculator).

I also like that it's not an "always on" EA, you basically use it to mange the trade, so there's no risk of it placing a trade accidentally. You pick your entries, define your risk and then it carries out the manual labour.

EDIT:  Sorry, I should make it clear, I'm not using the MA cross over EA, i'm using an EA which manages your trades once you've picked an entry!  My own opinion is that an EA picking entries based on MA crosses will not be particularly profitable in the long run.  Also, this strategy is SO easy and enjoyable to trade manually, I can't see why anyone would want to.

--- 帖子 #812 ---
I suspect this is why I have more success using the box lines against the 4 hours prior to the London open (as opposed to my brokers new day) since that's the 2nd half of the Asian session.

I'll have a look at how the whole session highs/lows vary against the last 4 hours though, will be interesting to see how that affects my breakout entries (I would have thought it would reduce the chance of catching a false BO).

--- 帖子 #813 ---
I think it does reduce the chance of a false BO.  See what you think...

--- 帖子 #814 ---
Hi, you mean, with this EA, you can open a trade MANUALLY, and let the EA close it, as the MA cross against you?  Or set it with different TP's with different lot sizes?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #815 ---
Nice setup on USDCHF -trend trade

--- 帖子 #816 ---
Hi, iamnoel

The process works as follows:

1.  You identify your point of entry

2.  Open the EA and input your stop loss, risk and take profit targets (which in this case are based on fibo numbers)

3.  The EA will place the trade immediately, basing your lot size on your predefined risk and stop loss.

4.  The EA will manage the partial closures of the trade at each take profit target.

--- 帖子 #817 ---
It is the EA Maudur introduced to us, right?

Please advice

Andreas

--- 帖子 #818 ---
Yes it is.  It's working very well actually.

If you want the ability to secure profits but still be able to chase the bigger moves, this does pretty much everything you need.  It's also nice to have all the take profit levels on the screen.

But anyway, apologies LG, we're cluttering the thread (although, it's still useful to have the info here since it's a good all round trade management tool)

CT trades work very well on the lower time frames. I trade during very active NY market hours so watching the price momemtum influences my CT trades on lower time frames. I respect the 200 more on the higher time frames. I usually don't trade these smaller time frames but market conditions the last few weeks have made me get in and out more quickly on lower the time frames. Until things change I'll stay at 1hr M15 and M5. Usually though I like 1 hour and up because of the whipsawing you get on the lower time frames. I might take a few trades with a few pip losses before I get into a 20 to 35 pip run on a M5 MA cross. I pay close attention to 00 and 50 numbers and try to watch for fades or breaks of these.

--- 帖子 #848 ---
Hi

I'm using the smoothed movings, haven't tested the exponentials yet

Yes, I wait for confirmation on M15

H4 and D1 are < SMA 200 so we trade with momentum of higher TF

--- 帖子 #855 ---
I am using EMAs, L27. I have moved to the H4 charts for awhile, with confirmation on the M30 chart. I enter as soon as I see a good cross on the H4 and confirm that price is continuing in that dirction on the lower TF.

EURUSD has been moving down since yesterday open, so it has had downward momentum for hours. The 200 EMA on the H4 chart pretty much stopped price and turned it around. Same thing now with GBPUSD...the 3 MA getting close to the 200 EMA. Will the 200 repel price and turn it around, or will price go through it? We'll see...

Interesting to note Euro weakness in both E/USD and E/GBP 4 hour charts - charts, with however only a potential soft cross or even a sideways movement for a while on E/GBP.

Selling price was at 1.3698, 3 minutes before I was able to post the chart.

I also use IBFX.

Basically the cross on H1 below 200 EMA was my setup.

M15 already had a cross and both moving averages pointed clockwise down, that was the confirmation that selling was still strong.

That was my trigger to take the trade.

I've not abandoned this thread, I'm still trading the EMA cross overs and it's still being really profitable for me.  The problem is that it's a pain for me to get charts posted (i'm trading from my iphone after I've checked set ups in the house before work).

I could post retrospectively when I get home from work, which would also show my exit points and how the PA developed over the course of the day, but I'm not sure how much use that would be?

I'm watching GBPUSD, EURUSD, AUDUSD and USDCAD from 7am GMT, looking for a cross on the M30 which carries the PA out of the asian trading range.  I then check for confirmation on the M5 and enter.  Average SL is about 10-15 pips and I'm now closing my full trade at 20-25 pips.  I'm taking 2 trades a day and my strike rate is around 75%.

I've stopped taking partial profits because even after a big move, the partial closures and target levels were not much more than closing a full trade at 25 pips - but in both cases the potential loss was the same.

I am trying to focus on two things at the moment:

1.  Working out a way to still catch those big moves.  I'm considering rules which will allow re-entry after my first trade is closed, e.g. a further EMA cross on the M5 or M15 in the same direction as the original trade, with a nice tight SL, so after a pull back for example.

2.  How to avoid MA crosses that don't carry enough momentum to reach my initial target, and to keep my SL tight.  I think both of these issues can be reduced by focusing on low risk high probability entries - for example only entering the trade after a pullback and recross of the EMAs on the M5.  We'll see..........

--- 帖子 #870 ---
Just a thought having read the above - why, instead of closing out a winning trade and then having to look for a re-entry point just move your stop loss up good and tight. If taken out - so be it, a few pips less than closing but with the added benefit and potential for your trade to continue in original direction. For SL I still think you have to use previous S&R areas even in very small time frames. The 3/8 cross in the lower time frame is in itself is a potential stop loss area.

Good trading

--- 帖子 #871 ---
The difficulty I have is that I can't monitor my trades once they have been placed.

I've tried various things, such as setting jumping stops, but to be honest, nothing compares to being able to watch the charts.  So I take the clearest initial TP and set that when I place my trade.

I agree about SL, mine are always just under/over previous SR, but when you're on the tail of a powerful BO, those areas can be disproportionately far away.  So a choice has to be made of whether to wait for a pullback (and have a tighter stop) or to catch the initial TP on the back of the first push in momentum (but will usually require a slightly larger stop).  I've found both methods have their pros/cons.

--- 帖子 #872 ---
Just a point - take E/Usd this morning our time. Now if one came to the screen at 08.00 hrs this morning the 3 and 8 ema's were virtually touching on a 30 min chart, at 08.20 hrs there was a 3/8 cross on 5 minute. This was a difficult area as it was around a big number - 1.3600, but a stop maybe 10 pips above the 3/8 cross gives a decent stop close to price action and you can use whatever risk to reward ratio you normally use. My own preference would be just set TP for the 1.3500 area - easy in hindsight but the type of strategy I use as all the higher time frames are negative - short.

Regards

--- 帖子 #873 ---
I actually took a similar trade this morning.

08.45 GMT

EURUSD

Sold @ 1.3580

SL = 1.3591 (11 pips)

TP = 1.3557 (23 pips)

The reason my trade was later than yours is because I only take trades at London open which have cleared the Asian trading range.

--- 帖子 #874 ---
Are you finding validity in the belief of many traders that the Asian market sets the trading parameters?  I haven't really taken the time to study that, but I have seen it stated by several traders I admire.

--- 帖子 #875 ---
Yes, but I'm not sure my logic is correct! It's based purely on my observations so far

I've been thinking about it, and the closest I can come to a logical answer is this:

I'm primarily trading EURUSD and GBPUSD, which are traded fairly lightly during the Asian session, and then burst into life when Frankfurt and London open.

If you look at GBPUSD in the 4 hour period before Frankfurt opens, there often isn't a lot going on. The price tends to bounce around rather lazily in a 10-30 pip range. I suspect this is simply because there just isn't the volume/large orders which drive the price during the European/NY trading sessions.

I'm led to believe that there are a large number of limit orders placed on either side of this range. If you watch the PA at 7-9am GMT, this does seem to fit.

The key thing I note is this.....the majority of the time, when Frankfurt/London opens, there is a huge increase in volume. The big players bursting into action in Europe suddenly give the price direction.

It's the words that I have underlined that are important to me. I know that the price is likely to make a significant move, I know when it's going to happen. What I don't know is what direction it is going to be in....

But that doesn't matter to me at all, that's where the asian session range box and the 3/8 EMAs come in.

I imagine a median running through the box on my screen. If the price begins to move from that line towards an edge of the box, I watch it. I don't care which way it's moving, the big players have control, it's up to them. Quite often, right after open, the PA will skip to the outer limits of the Asian range box and then skip to the other limit etc etc, just like it had been doing during the Asian session but now with more volatility. You could trade that range, but it's the BOs that i'm interested in.

So my set up and trigger has developed as follows:

1. Check the news (I don't want to be getting into a trade before big news, and even if it's hours away it can cause the PA to range, so it's no good).

2. Check the range box size from the last 4hours (if it's abnormally large for that pair, I'll avoid).

3. Check nearby SR (on all TFs). Am I trading into a record low, big round number, weekly resistance etc etc? If so I either avoid the trade or use a smaller TP. I also use SR to set TP levels.

4. Watch the PA on M30/M5 from 7am GMT. I just sit and observe the candles forming and things taking shape (this is where my strategy breaches one of your rules, I find that watching the candles form helps me spot good BO potential. As soon as PA breaches the outer limits of either side of the Asian range, I turn the candles off (back to your rules!).

5. Now we approach the first proper set up, I'm watching ONLY the EMAs at this point, it's helps me stick to rules and not be distracted....I need the 3/8 EMAs to have moved outside of the range box on the M30, a cross inside the box just before moving out is an A+ trade. Because of the light trading prior to 7am, there is almost always an M30 3/8 EMA cross in the vicinity which gives us our directional bias.  Most of the time i will wait until that M30 period has closed for confirmation, but not always.

6. Now for the trigger, I drop down to M5 and look at the 3/8 EMAs. Are they compliant? (e.g. pointing in the right direction, the more parallel the better). If they are compliant then it's time to get in.

7. I place my trade. My stop loss is generally just under the last significant SR point on the M5. This is normally around 15 pips on GBPUSD or EURUSD. For TP, I'm aiming for nearby SR, but ideally looking for around 20-25 pips.

That's it.

If I can, I will watch the trade and manage manually, but it seems to be working well just setting and forgetting.

The thing is, even if it's a false BO, I tend to still catch 20 pips on GBPUSD and EURUSD.

I set my risk at around 1.5% of account balance.

--- 帖子 #876 ---
This is a great strategy, especially for those who can trade the open of London.

Looking at just trading BOs from Asian session and with crosses for entry is very profitable from what I am seeing.

--- 帖子 #877 ---
Yes, it does seem to be profitable.

What I'm trying to tap into at the moment (your chart helps to show this) is the HUGE moves.

It looks very simple on the H1....simply place a trade once the 3/8 EMAs cross and breakout, then close the trade when they recross again.

The "problem", as always, is that this doesn't translate so simply in practice. A huge proportion of the move can already be complete by the time the H1 candle closes and the 3/8 EMAs have confirmed, then you jump in..........but it's often a powerful swing in the other direction with causes the 3/8 EMAs to cross again, which can often wipe out much of your profit. The picture is often very different when the candles are visible.

The other issue is that by trading the big moves, you generally need to give them room to breathe, which can mean bigger stops and getting stopped out more often. I was frequently using 30+ pips SLs, watching the trade run into 30 pips profit, only to reverse and trigger my SL just as the 3/8 EMAs triggered an exit. This happened quite often, which can have a significant effect on overall profitablity. You end up waiting on that huge move to wipe out all your 30+ pip losses.

So in the end, I decided on a higher success rate with a lower pip target. This suits my trading style better.

However, I do watch some of the bigger moves with disappointment that I exited with 20 pips, and they continue for another 100. I'm not greedy, but if there is a way to milk some of those extra pips then it's foolish not to use it. It's much easier to do when you can watch the screen and manually move up your stop as new SR levels form, but even then, its hugely discretionary.

forexpippy

I started looking at this thread at the end of last week. I just wanted to say thanks for your clear explanation for two posts in particular numbers 876 and 878.

I still have a lot to read on this thread so I'm sure there are more of yours and other contributors posts which will help me.

I am new to this and am demo trading but as I live in the UK I am able to trade London.

--- 帖子 #880 ---
My morning trades........

EURUSD and AUDUSD

Absolute text book set ups (as they seem to be most mornings ha ha!).

Entered with 11 pip SL on each (about 0.7% of account balance) and TP of 18 pips (about 1.25% of account balance).

Both hit TP very quickly and I'm done for the day.  2.5% increase in account balance.

--- 帖子 #881 ---
Dear lawgirl21 Do you have a longer-term results?

from 100 hundred trades,whatwas win/loss?

Can you show of this system,results?

--- 帖子 #882 ---
Next time I've got a spare few hours, I'm going to turn on the candles (with the 3/8 EMAs in view) and save M30 and M5 chart screenshots for the last 12 months (eugh!).

I'll print them out at work and manually backtest them in conjunction with a couple of sets of rules, marking on the charts where entry and exit would have been on the basis of those rules.

I'm hoping there is one method with is clearly more profitable than the others, and then I'll focus on that.

I'll be looking at:

Entry:

Where 3/8 EMAs cross (even if inside the Asian range)

Where 3/8 EMAs BO of Asian range

Waiting for pullback and recross of 3/8 EMAs after BO

Exit:

Fixed TP

Exit based on further 3/8 EMA recross

Jumping stops

No idea how successful or useful this exercise will be

--- 帖子 #883 ---
Missed most of yesterday and this morning's trading. I like your strategy using LG's concept and your Asian break out. Very simple and efficient by the look of it - well done. Do you allow or take into consideration if the setup is counter trend? Good luck with the back testing!!

Regards

--- 帖子 #884 ---
Hi Malinbeg.

Yes, as I mentioned in my strategy post earlier, the initial BO on London open tends to be pretty random, so i try to avoid a directional bias until I've spotted a BO.  So even if the BO is counter-trend I will happily trade it.

This seems to work because I have smaller profit targets and there is sufficient volatility in the markets at the moment.  Clearly, if you're aiming for the longer runs then greater consideration needs to be given the the exiting trend.

--- 帖子 #885 ---
Forexpippy, do you use 3 and 8 exponential movings or 3 and 8 smoothed? Thank you,

--- 帖子 #886 ---
Hi Lite.

All my posts refer to EMA which is Exponential Moving Average, that's what I'm using.

I find it better for the type of crosses I'm looking to catch (e.g. short powerful moves at market opens, where I need quicker confirmation).

--- 帖子 #887 ---
i was keep trying to get same colours on the chart but i cant and give up can u pls give me ur template if u dont mind thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #888 ---
Most pairs seem to be resting and re-grouping (consolidating)...getting ready for more decisive moves again, I hope.

--- 帖子 #889 ---
Really?

It's grey, blue and gold. 30 seconds of actually trying to change the colours yourself would have led to the same screen.

However, in the interests of "community spirit", here is my template (which took considerably longer than 30 seconds to post here from my VPS via my iphone)

--- 帖子 #890 ---
Sorry, Doncex.  I don't keep those stats...I look only at the bottom line.  I did that when I first started trading, but found that it took too much time from trading and was not productive for me.

--- 帖子 #891 ---
thanks but ur file is not correct

--- 帖子 #892 ---
That's the template I use.

I just loaded it up onto a fresh platform to check if it worked.  It did.  the colours are the same -grey background with gold and blue 3/8 EMA's and a black 200 EMA.

Can you describe what doesn't appear to be working?

--- 帖子 #893 ---
Hi, what are the values of the white and purple MA's?

One of them is 200EMA I believe ...

--- 帖子 #894 ---
Might be a good idea to read the thread which would save a lot of peoples time in answering questions. If you are really pressed for time try the first post.

--- 帖子 #895 ---
This is what is in the FIRST POST.   I only see 3 MA's being mentioned?

Do you know what the fourth one is?

--- 帖子 #896 ---
1.  white = 200EMA

2.  purple = 8 EMA (I am using exponential instead of smoothed, but it really makes little difference.)

3.  gold = 3 EMA

4.  optional pink = 50 EMA

--- 帖子 #897 ---
Thanks a lot!

--- 帖子 #898 ---
Hi Lawgirl and fellow traders,

Thank you for an easy, and that's putting it lightly, system. But I've always been told, if it's too good to be true, it is. I'm just getting back into trading after a small hiatus after switching brokers.

Anyway, I read the first few pages and think i got the jest, but now i'm wondering how things are going? Is the system still brining in positive pips or has it stalled?

Looking forward to following,

FKF

--- 帖子 #899 ---
I admit, I just got through reading the entire thread and my head's  swimming with all the info as I'm trying to get a handle on things.

I have a questions for lawgirl using this method for scalping cuz I just love to scalp those trades ...

What really caught my eye were your earlier posts where you were using this method to scalp a week or so ago using the M5 and M1 charts ... my question is, which lower time frame chart did you use to look for the setups and entries, M15 or just the M5?  Did you use the M1 for confirmation or also setups and entry points?

In other words, did you make your entry off of the M5 chart or a higher time frame when scalping, and which time frame (if any) did you use for confirmation?

Thanks in advance ...

UPDATE:  Never mind LG, no need to respond, I found the answer to my question in one of your previous posts after reading through my notes some more.

--- 帖子 #900 ---
Hi,

Today I share with you a new EA that I have developed that move the SL at a fixed distance from a moving average.

The default values ​​correspond to the EMA 8 and the SL will always be to a default distance of 10 pips.

parameters:

MA             (Default 8)

OFFSET      (Default 0)

METHOD     (0:sma, 1:ema, 2:smma, 3:lwma)

APPLY_TO   (0:close, 1:open, 2:high, 3:low, 4:median, 5:typical, 6:weighted)

TF             (Time Frame in minutes to calculate Moving Average)

DISTANCE   (Distance of SL in pips from MA)

With this tool you can rest assured that if the price (EMA 1) is returned and crosses the EMA 8, the order will be closed for SL, for or against.

You can continue running the order manually, ie, close the order when you want or stop EA when you want.  The only thing EA does is move the SL by the MA.

I welcome your comments.

Note: you must open the order as it does now, manually. EA then it does is move the SL at a distance from the MA, either up or down, as she moves.

--- 帖子 #901 ---
I love these wonderfully clean and uncluttered charts but I am liking Dutchsignals idea of using a stochastic for easy-peasy SL and TP levels (post #70), combined with Lehman's idea of using 2 TP levels for quick gratification combined with the ability to grab additional pips off of the bigger moves in a loss-free trade situation (post #69).

My question is, can anyone give me any ideas as to what to set the parameters at for the stochastic in regard to using it in conjunction with this method as Dutchsignals suggested in post 70?

--- 帖子 #902 ---
hey mate...could you please direct me to that post please..coz i trade only 1 minute...

--- 帖子 #903 ---
Excuses, the previous version published always calculates MA on current timeframe, this version does as the parameter TF. For example, you detect an entry in H1 and confirm entry with M15, but you want SL to be calculated based on the MA in H1. In that case you should select TF to 60 which corresponds to 60 minutes or 1 hour.

When the price crosses the MA in H1 over the distance given as a parameter, the order will be closed by SL winning or losing depends on how advanced the order.

--- 帖子 #904 ---
Next is an example of use MA_TS.

Watch as SL is equal to EMA 8. In this case the parameters are:

MA: 8

OFFSET: 0

METHOD: 1 (EMA)

APPLY_TO: 0 (CLOSE)

TF: 60

DISTANCE: 0 (SL equal to EMA)

If you move to M15 chart, SL continues to move about the MA in H1.

--- 帖子 #905 ---
Same chart in M15.

hello LG thank you for this wonderful system...

I just have some questions if u dont mind about the entries.

im goona be working on 15 and 1 hour charts..

should i look for the cross of 3/8 on the 1 hour chart then come to the 15 minute and look for the same cross right?

but most of the time 15 minutes crosses way before the 1 hour what should i do...please confirm thanks

--- 帖子 #908 ---
Oh my goodness, I didn't make a note of the post number in my notes although if memory servers it was around the first week of the month (November) ... for some reason November 4th comes to mind but I could be mistaken on that.

--- 帖子 #909 ---
thanks for the reply mate...much apprciated//

can u tell about the entries for me please...i see a cross on 1hour and i go back to 15min and see the cross was already made should i wait for another cross on the same direction to take the trade or i should enter right away?

--- 帖子 #910 ---
From my notes taken from posts in this thread ...

I suggest starting at the beginning (post #1) and read through the entire thread, looking at the charts that have been posted and taking your time to do the research necessary to get a handle on this system.  That's what I'm in the process of doing right now myself ...

--- 帖子 #911 ---
Thanks!  Very nice.

Maybe you can add an option where TP can also be set automatically, say at 20 pips, or maybe like this one, relative to the movement of 3ema or 8ema too?

Much appreciated.

Btw, just noticed I used the TF 60, but somehow SL is being set at the 8EMA of H4?

--- 帖子 #912 ---
1. Click on the file I attached to my post and download it to your computer (it's a TPL file, not a regular file).

2. Go to Charts -> Template -> Load Template... on MT4

3. Navigate to where you saved my tpl file. Select it.

I tend to save them to my templates folder in MT4.

--- 帖子 #913 ---
iamnoel, the only purpose of this EA is to make a dynamic trailing stop the orders on your open hand. You also decide manually according to your strategy where to Close an Order.

MA is calculated in the TF given as parameter. Remember there is a parameter called DISTANCE which corresponds to a delta from the MA.

Thanks and I hope I have clarified your concerns.

--- 帖子 #914 ---
Yup, I got it.

What I meant was the dynamic SL is following the 8ema of H4.  I used the default setting which is H1.

Or, was it H1 8ema + 10 pips.  It just so happened that the value equals the 8ema of H4 maybe?

--- 帖子 #915 ---
I don't understand. I didn't write it.

This EA dynamically modifies the SL so that always go to a fixed DISTANCE from the MA in the TF that you enter as a parameter.

--- 帖子 #916 ---
I'm long in EURUSD, and managing trailing stop with MA_TS on EMA 8 in H1 + 10 pips of DISTANCE.

--- 帖子 #917 ---
I'm waiting to go long until the MAs clear that Asian consolidation area.

Good luck! It was tricky trading London open today. I had 2 losers and a winner. Total of 2.5% loss.

Glad I'm not the only one that thought so, both the Asian and London sessions were tough.  Wound up just staying out which - this time around - actually turned out to be a good thing.

@LawGirl21,

I dont know why, but your EU H1 charts posted 8 hours ago is significantly different from the one posted by maudur 10 hours ago.

Notice the BO lines, in particular.

--- 帖子 #921 ---
Hi Forexpippy

Do you set your range box using the candles on the H1 or the M30 chart, and is the range set at the high/low of the candle wicks or candle bodies?

--- 帖子 #922 ---
I'm short in usdjpy. I'm using trailing stop with MA_TS firts with EMA 8, and now I moved MA to 3 in order to assure profits.

--- 帖子 #923 ---
Long in EURUSD. Short in USDCAD. Both with trailing stop with MA_TS.

--- 帖子 #924 ---
Usually, according to LG, the box settings utilize the H1 time frame and the range is the candle body of each hour. I do not mean to speak for anyone else but noticed you had not received a response as yet so thought I would let you know what I have been told. Other people may use different settings and I do not speak for them.

--- 帖子 #925 ---

Sorry Koglkama, I must have missed this.

There is no hard and fast rule for this.  It's an attempt to define a trading range for the pruposes of identifying a breakout, so it's very subjective, what ever produces the best results for you.

I'm actually using an indicator to calculate the boxes for me.  i've attached a copy for you to have a play around with.

Hello Law Girl, really enjoying your thread. Interesting trading with out candles. I have a question regarding your strat. When looking at price movement off of s&r lines, ie. trendlines, pivots, 200 ma etc, are you waiting for price to break or bounce off of those areas… or the ma’s themselves to break s&r? Thank you for the thread and all the time you put in.

--- 帖子 #933 ---
Glad you are enjoying the thread, Brifx...and hope you are banking pips with it.  This has been a great week so far.

I look to the angle of the MAs only and that they are in the direction indicated by the 200 EMA, as well as the 50 EMA which I added to "refine" the direction even more.

The chart below is an ideal set-up..doesn't always work out, but mostly it does.

--- 帖子 #934 ---
I'm a little squeamish  about that word...but happy you are making lots of pips.  It has been a very good early trading week.

Started playing with the strategy late yesterday night! I have a quick question: MTMP - I've never gotten the trailing stop to work correctly - always gets me out of the position somehow... Can you share your settings?

Or maybe PM me with them not to clutter the thread?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #937 ---
I generally can't get it to work either, so I stopped using it for trailing stops!

I was testing another EA entirely.  It's not mine to circulate (not sure if the version I had was made available on FF), however the creator is Maudur, so you could try sending him a nice message   It's a great trade management EA for partial closures and trailing stops.

A bit hard to find entry and setting up TP (and SL too, for that matter), but I suppose it is because I'm not used to the system yet.

I have seen a few different strategies where traders will set TP1, TP2, etc and take off 50% at TP1, another 30% off at TP2, move SL to Be and let the rest ride. Can someone please explain how to manually take 50% off, i am using MT4. Thank you!

--- 帖子 #953 ---
You will need to proceed to CLOSE the order - but on the top - where you have the volume - you need to just use HALF of that... For example - if you are trading 1.0 lots then you will use 0.5 lots for the volume you want to close.

NOTE: it all depends on how you are trading - if you are using the minimum you can trade (volume) then there is no closing of the half... FE: my broker's minimum is 0.01 so I cannot close half of that position... If I use 0.02 then I can close 0.01 of that making it half!

Hope this makes perfect sense to you, and if it doesn't then let us know and we will explain it again!

Yes -people will try to complicate things hoping to improve the win / lose ratio. But they forget trading is largely phsycological so you MUST accept/expect some losses

I just returned from a 5 days in Vegas. Had a wonderful time, but am ready for some serious trading. I hope everyone celebrating Thanksgiving had a wonderful holiday.

I have been tading this pair up and down for about 100 pips so far.

--- 帖子 #963 ---
Glad to see you back

I will stick to H1 for the time beeing -still need more practise before I woud be ready for lower TF.

On H1 trades I'm up +12% this month, I'm more than happy with that.

Simplicity really seems to be the key to success.

--- 帖子 #964 ---
That is terrific!  Imagine averaging 10-12% per month...it is certainly  doable.

--- 帖子 #965 ---
Well done. I just hope I can get to a similar standard as you and Lawgirl

--- 帖子 #966 ---
Traders,

Nice to see some activity on this thread.  I was worried that everbody had made enough and left town.

It would be nice for the EA thread to do the same.  We need to know if the majority of the traders are satisfied with the existing EA or if some tweeeking is needed.

Have a nice day.

DrJack

--- 帖子 #967 ---
Congratulations Andreas. Well done. That good to see you and LG placing new posts. I've tried quite this strategy but I could with it yet. I think I need to improve the exits. Sometimes to look far, the price goes back and I'll go out SL or sometimes too fast and left many pips on the table. I hope to refine my strategy on the experience of LG and you.

Many successes for next month.

--- 帖子 #968 ---
Haven't had much luck this week but i am being forced to trade at some off times because of my work schedule. Hopefully will be able to give it more time and concentration next week. I was using the 1 hr scaling to 15 min for entries but looking at the charts again it looks like market conditions are more favorable to the 30 min charts scaling down to the 5 min tf for scalping. Ant thoughts?

--- 帖子 #969 ---
Thanks, Maudur.

Many pips to you too.

My performance really started to improve after I followed LG.

Exits are still tough for me as well and need to be worked and improved on.

Will keep on posting more charts later.

Hello Lawgirl or anyone who can answer this for me.

I am doing my best to master this it does seem to be a excellent system but I am struggling a little to date and my apologies if this has already been answered

Are the Daily Line Boxes set to the Open and Close of the Asian session? If not what is the best session and time to set them?

Andreas, I see you came short before, when the crossing was beginning. Normally enter in this way?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #976 ---
Yes, as long as H1 starts to cross and M15 points down I enter, as long as we have confluence with higher TF

True...what we are waiting for now, I guess.  I did catch the GBPUSD long, but only because I set it and forgot it.

--- 帖子 #983 ---
Sorry but still a ibit confused. Since we are not using candles or line charts in this system we are only judging where price is according to where the ma's are? S&R are only drawn to the ma's as well? Anyone using pivots as lines in the sand, where price may bounce off of or extend to? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #984 ---
LG,

How are you using the RSI?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #985 ---
That is the indy that was developed for my other thread by a trader named Scrutch.  It works on the RSI(3) and is used for directional purposes.

For BOs on the H1 chart the H4 direction on the indy would need to match..if daily matches... even better.

I do not know how to move it to this thread, but it is on the Trade What you See--Almost Naked thread.   Called "Lawgirls Trend Display".  It's much like the TRO candle indy only doesn't give as much info, which I like.

Ahhh ok. Yes I knows it and have used it from your other thread. Only that in your chart does not look good. I purposely say that I did a small modification to this indicator to correct a problem It have. If you change the Time Frame, the first indicator (H1) changes with each TF. I send the corrected version.

Thanks.

Thanks for that!

--- 帖子 #990 ---
Hi LG,

Regarding your EURCHF 1H trade in the prior post, how did you manage the trade?  Did you set a SL and TP at the time the short was entered?  Do you enter a set SL and TP based on a desired R:R ratio?  Or, do you set SL and TP based on S/R above/below entry if a minimum R:R can be met?  I noticed that price reversed.  Were you able to profit from this trade?

I know you don't maintain a W/L % track record, but when I have mastered this method what W/L% would be typical for the diligent trader?  Put another way, is 80% plus a reasonable benchmark for success with this approach?

Do you prefer this method to TMS?

Thanks very much for your reply,

John

--- 帖子 #991 ---
Good questions, John. I did not manage that trade well at all. I did set a SL and TP and it hit my SL -30 pips. I like to monitor my trades and did not watch this one or I would have gotten out when the RSIs changed and the 3EMA hooked up. And had I been watching, I would have gone long on the cross back up.

I do not look at W/L ratios. I pull money out when I am up $5,000. Then trade my $10k "stake" back to 15,000....pull that out....and repeat. The quickest I have gone from 10k to 15k has been around 4 trading days...but it usually takes longer.

I have several trading systems I really like depending on what the market is doing, TMS is one of them. But I prefer no candles.

Hello: I would like to thank LawGirl for starting the original thread and all the other people that have contributed. Thank you all. I do have experience with technical indicators but am a total noob when it comes to coding. Therefore I have a request regarding the writing of some code. It is within the original concept of the moving average cross over. My thought is to use an 8EMALo and an 8EMAHi
as an envelope. 3 long and 3 short signals would be generated with an arrow marking each one.

LONG
1. 3EMA > 8EMALo. This would have an alert. Start to monitor.
2. 3EMA > 8EMA. LawGirl.
3. 3EMA > 8EMAHi. Does the move have jam.

SHORT
1. 3EMA < 8EMAHi. This would have an alert. Start to monitor.
2. 3EMA < 8EMA LawGirl.
3. 3EMA < 8EMALo. Does the move have jam.

My intention is not to have an automatic system but a staged manual system. The purpose of the alert is to give a wake up call to start monitoring manually and looking for additional clues as to the possible future price direction.
My time frame preference is a 15M chart.
I hope someone can help me bring this together. This is my first ever post so please excuse any rookie errors. Thanks again everyone. Dave.

--- 帖子 #1010 ---
Some very nice set ups this morning.

--- 帖子 #1011 ---
Hi LawGirl... Missed when you added the RSI to the equation... Same rules? New rules? Any post I should go back to?

--- 帖子 #1012 ---
Sorry mf...I just brought the RSI indy over from my other thread.  I still think it is one of the best indicators ever and was constantly still referring to it, so I just added it.  We don't really need it, but it gives a quick look at the other TFs.

--- 帖子 #1013 ---
No worries - quick question on your previous setups for the morning: did you catch those at the EURO session? I was looking over at my charts from FXDD but both of them happened way before the NY session started. Just wanted to confirm what my eyes are looking at is correct...

--- 帖子 #1014 ---
I found the indicators often crossed down, but then climbed up again.

--- 帖子 #1015 ---
Correct - but according to the rules - you won't be on that trade until you are clear of the 200 moving average (white)...

--- 帖子 #1016 ---
You would see that with candles too. Just a natural retrace or pullback, then a continuation. Remember that price seldom goes straight up or straight down.

--- 帖子 #1017 ---
......unless you intend a countertrend trade.

--- 帖子 #1018 ---
I took EURCHF at 1.2349 -trend trade supported by H4 and D1.

Had a nice little trade this morning on A/U for +27. Took it off the 30 min cross, scaled down to 5 min for entry. This system is really showing the inportance of patients, thank you again lawgirl.

Hi Maudur

Sorry for not writing more clearly.

I meant 'supported' more related to confluence.H4 and D1 are above 200 EMA H4 and D1 were green when I entered Hope this helps

Just for information purposes - I have not been at my screen as much this last few weeks due to other issues. But whenever I could grab a bit of time I traded the 5 minute and the 1 minute chart - 5:1 ratio. on E/USD. Works quite nicely for a short, quick in and out and pluck a few pips of the table type of strategy especially when you have no time to start scanning various pairs etc for set ups.

Happy trading.

Bill

Using what criteria for SL and TP?

--- 帖子 #1027 ---
Hey all

Got a question regarding the entries and i'd like if one of you could clear my confusion up!

http://img408.imageshack.us/img408/6182/80863692.jpg

Option 1:

-H1 trend is BELOW white MA so it is a Downtrend.

-We look for shorts on the M15 (even though its above the white MA on that TF).

-As soon as the yellow crosses into the purple ma on the M15 we go short.

Option 2:

-You wait for the H1 yellow MA to cross into the purple MA and is below the white MA indicating downtrend.

-You then look at the M15, however you have to wait for it to cross into the purple AGAIN which is essentially shorting on a retrace?

Option 3:

-You wait for the H1 yellow MA to cross into the purple MA and is below the white MA indicating downtrend.

-You go short on the M15.

The reason I ask is because I'm spending time doing this but I want to clear it up to make sure whilst i'm sitting at my desk i'm actually doing the right thing. If its none of these options, could anyone just mention briefly the procedure?

I might be over complicating it... lol.

thanks

--- 帖子 #1028 ---
ConstantFX,

as per thread post #1

"When 3 crosses 8 on higher TF , move to lower TF for entry...look for a strong cross on lower TF and enter."

So you decide looking at H1 and -if conditions met- enter trade looking at M15. Hope this helps, look at the #1 again, possibly it will make it a bit more clear.

--- 帖子 #1029 ---
EDIT:

Hey thanks for reply.

Ok I have edited the image, with the part after the green vertical line being drawn on my be (ovbiously!).

Where 1 is the signal, and 2 is the trigger to sell (sell regardless of the current position being above the 200MA).

http://img577.imageshack.us/img577/2691/triggert.jpg

Is this correct?

--- 帖子 #1030 ---
If the 2nd image would be H1, better. The relation should be 1:4 to 1:6, so H1 > M15 or M30 > M5. But beside of this, yes - right.

josch

--- 帖子 #1031 ---
Ah yes stupid me.... should've been a H1 and M15.

Thanks for the confirmation .

I am new to Forex and have read this thread and LawGirl's other thread as well.

I apologize, I am having trouble following this method.

Is there someone who can mentor me to help me trade profitably?

Thanks,

Anthony

--- 帖子 #1033 ---
You can mentor yourself for free.  Start at babypips.com and take every lesson.  Do not be dissuaded by the website name [a more appropriate name would have been Forex-101].  There’s a ton of information available.

--- 帖子 #1034 ---
Michael,

Thanks for your reply, I have taken many of Baby Pips lessons.

What I wanted was someone to specifically teach me how to use THIS system and LawGirl's other system she has on here.

I have been over the thread but there are many things I still don't understand.

Anyone care to help me one-on-one?

--- 帖子 #1035 ---
Hi Anthony

I don't know exactly where to point you to start your trek into the Forex market. The forex can be a minefield or mindfield however you look at it, of information. I wish I had a mentor years ago, but that was not the case.

For my 2 cents worth to help start you on your way. Just start watching the market on a demo account. But place no positions, you don't want to start any bad habits. Then I like to read. Don't worry to much about trading systems just start getting the general information in your head first. Then maybe start putting on positions with your demo, but only according to a trading plan.

If you get specific questions...ask them

--- 帖子 #1036 ---
Sorry, I am only seeing your question now - Happy New Year by the way.

When using short time frames like one minute etc I am always sitting at the screen. I use 2% risk and will have my TP/Sl ratio at 2:1 as a minimum - however if trading life - i.e at the screen I will not put in a TP order, preferring to trade manually.

If the trade continues in my direction and past my TP area, I will often move my stop loss to the theoretical TP. I can then walk away from the screen knowing that I have at least locked in my 2:1 profit.

Naturally it doesn't always work out like that, but gives a nice smile to one's face when it does!!

Best regards

Bill.

--- 帖子 #1037 ---
Awesome trading style with the MAs! Following your method without candles is a tough one for me more especially determining what point to take a trade after 200MA repels price leading to a crossover of 3 & 8MAs. My question is this, supposing the 200ma is in a bullish configuration and price gets repelled to the upside on reaching 200ma leading to 3 & 8ma crossover. Now am i expected to take my long right at point of 3 & 8ma crossover or wait a little for price to find some sort of support either on 3ma or 8ma before i pull the trigger? Another question is, how do one know a particular 3 & 8ma crossover is going to be a strong or weak one?

Hey guys

For all of you that want to use Moving Average Crossover systems I have created this indicator you can use for it.

http://www.theforexcabin.com/wp-cont...r-snapshot.png

You can select which moving average type( simple/exponential/linear) and period you would like to use, set take profit ,stop loss levels,etc. and you can see instantly what is hapening with that moving average against the market for 10 currencies of your choice and also select if you want to receive alerts when crossovers occure.

You can get it for free from my website and also read more about how to use it from here.

http://www.theforexcabin.com/trading...erage-trader/#

Fell free to comment ,make suggestion and support my website

Regards

--- 帖子 #1042 ---
Thanks fylaxtas for sharing an interesting indicator. I plan to use it with my daily system where, basically, positions are taken when daily bar crossed Linear Weighted MA (10). SL/TP are defaulted to 100 pips, but I use a jumping SL @30 pips.

One proposal: Can you make it to show the next 10 sets of pairs below or in the next window (2)? There seems to be enough space even with my wide screen.

Regards,  RS

--- 帖子 #1043 ---
Hi RisingSun

I am glad you liked the indicator.  I have quite a few ideas I am working on.

Feel free to check the other systems and indicators I have included.

If you liked what I offer please try to support my site by sharing, commenting on the posts  and possibly checking an add .

Regarding your query if you check my instructions you can change the parameters that are the defaulted ones when you attach the indicator on the chart.  Under these parameters you can also change which currencies to be included.  Therefore simply attach the indicator to a new chart and type the 10 indicators you requested.

Take care

--- 帖子 #1044 ---
Thanks fylaxtas. Yes, I will go to your site occasionally to see if there is anything new uploaded.

Regarding the number of pairs, I am watching at lease 20 pairs. So it would be nice if they could all be seen in one screen. Otherwise I will have to open another chart with different set of 10 pairs, per your instructions.

Regards,  RS

PS: I have attached the indi to my Oanda MT4. This is running now even during the weekend as you probably know. I set the alert to true, and it keeps beeping. Is this normal?

--- 帖子 #1045 ---

--- 帖子 #1047 ---
Hello again Rising Sun

Since your screen is large why don't you just do the following.

1) Open 2 charts and attach the indicator.

2) Put one chart over the other.

3) Change the currency pairs for the second one.

Just like the picture attached. You can still look everything in one screen.

Regarding the alarms.

Whenever a crossover has occurred in any of the symbols you are looking at ,at the current period the Alarm will sound.  The alarm will keep playing each time the price of the symbol changes even by a pip and provided the crossover has occurred at that period.

This is how mt4 indicators work. Each time the price changes the whole indicator code is run again.

Suggestion, once you have heard the alarm and made the trade you can turn of the alarm for that currency pair till that period is over and turn it on again.

Glad to be of help

--- 帖子 #1048 ---
I really like lawgirl21 trading system of using 3SMA and 8SMA as I have tested them which results in a great profit. And what fylaxtas was showing here is more amazing! I have been waiting for an indicator like that for months! Thank you so much...   I will try and give feedback here.

Hello FYLAXTAS,

Thanks for sharing, I'm so excited about your indicator, I use only MA's in my trading but I'm having a problem downloading it. I went to your website, click the link to download the indi but it won't work, all I've got is a .rar file and can't find a .EX4 or .MQ4 file. I don't know what I'm doing wrong or it's something wrong/missing file converter with my computer.I'm reading the other posts and they're not having this kind of problem. Is there a way that you could post the .ex4 or .mq4 file of the indicator here at FF, please. Thanks a lot for your generosity, it's not easy to code this kind of indicator.

--- 帖子 #1052 ---
Hey greenonyx.

May I assume you have never used a winrar extractor before.

Rar files are zipped files, that you need to extract using a winrar extractor.

Once you extract the file , the .ex4  file is inside.

Winrar is free. You can get it from here
http://www.win-rar.com/predownload.html?&L=0

Let me know how you like the indicator.

Hey Fylaxtas,

--- 帖子 #1054 ---
Hey Fylaxtas,

Firstly, huge thanks to Lawgirl for sharing this wonderfully simple strategy and big thanks for everyone elses contributions in helping to understand it.

I have been quietly following the entire thread for some time now and have very successfully incorporated it into my demo (for now!) trading.  In fact, my demo account shot up £10k using what i have learnt here alone last month!!

It is very refreshing to see a genuine thread aimed at helping 'relative' newbies like myself to improve their strategy and discipline, without all the back biting that seems to occur on so many other forums and threads at FF!!

Ref: This great looking Indicator

Thanks for sharing this wonderfully useful looking indicator, however, despite being quite computer literate I am feeling somewhat embarrassed as whatever i seem to do I cannot get it to unzip into the desired folder using Winrar as instructed in your last post? Is it because the download from the link is just an evaluation copy?

Can anyone help, i just get an error?!! Any chance you could just post the ex4 file for me to save me a load of grief please?

Thanks in advance,

Julca

(Nice website by the way ;-)) - can i say that on here?)

--- 帖子 #1055 ---
Hi guys

I hope you enjoyed my indicator.

I have now added  another one in a similar form for Crossovers occurring between 2 Moving Averages of your choice. You can select the 2 types of Moving Averages periods and types and see instantly what is the trend based on them when a crossover occurs and several other information .  (The previous one was showing what the moving average was in relationship with the market price)

You can get it here

If you like it please comment and share.

Anybody on the GBP/USD long?

--- 帖子 #1057 ---
Hi fylaxtas!  thanks for your superb indicator. It relieves me from looking at the monitor all the time. The property of the indicator to keep on sounding the alerts beeps even after the cross has occured  is a very good indeed.

I have one issue. With 8 and 3 period moving averages and M15 time frame the alert window and the sounds were working fine. But when I tried  50 and 20 period moving averages and H1 time frame, neither the alerts window nor the beeps were working even at  crosses and after crosses. What can be the cause?

--- 帖子 #1058 ---
Hi nimsri

I am glad you liked the indicator. Please like and share if it is helping you.

Regarding your issue please note of the following.

-When a crossover occurs at the current time frame you will see an arrow (up or down) being formed at the immediate action row.

-The alert window and beeps will keep ringing for the whole period where the crossover has occured.

-You have the option to turn on/off alerts for all the currencies or a specific one.

If it was working fine for you at 8 and 3 periods then there is no reason not to work well for any other periods. My guess would be that you had the alerts off, as by default is false.  Also check the Immediate Action row when the crossover occurs to see what it tells you.

Hi fylaxtas! Thanks for your prompt reply. I also  have sent a comment in your website about the issue.  However, I'm sure I have set all parameters for the indicator correctly.  Anyway, give me some time to report back the results because crossovers in H1 are not that frequent for doing a quick testing.

Regards

P.S. Let me tell you that even if the alerts don't work as expected, the indicator window's legend about the last intersection price  shows the last cross-over price accurately.

--- 帖子 #1060 ---
Hi again.

I tested 50, 20 in 15  minutes, where a crossover had occurred and I did get the alerts fine. We just need to wait for one to occur under 1 hour I guess to check.

Another reason I can think of is the following.

-Maybe the crossover had occur in that hour, but after a while the moving average is at the same state as it was the previous hour. (ie the 50 MA went above the 20MA for a few minutes but later on went bellow it again).

-If this was the case the alarm would not ring again until the moving average changes state again, as it could be considered a false signal

Regards

Hi fylaxtas, the indicator is working fine in H1-    it's my stupidity not being patient enough to watch a proper crossover in H1.

Thanks for your time and effort

Hi fylaxtas! My stupidity is not in vain,however. One has to learn from failures. I have now got a deeper understanding of your indicator.Keep up your good work. I for one will  sure be an ardent follower.

--- 帖子 #1063 ---
Hi fylaxtas!  There's a minor adjustment needed in the moving average cross-over indicator.  The main heading need to be shifted a few places to the left to avoid  the displayed short MA figure getting truncated.

@ fylaxtas,

For 5 digit broker, I must input 1000 pips even when I want 100 pips take profit

How about when the crossover occurs 30 pips above the actual price as shown?

thanks

--- 帖子 #1065 ---
Hi Erebus

Yes for 5-digit brokers you just enter the pips value multiplied by 10.

If the crossover occurred 30 pips above the market price what is the problem with this ? I fail to get your question.

Thank you

--- 帖子 #1066 ---
Thank you fylaxtas, this indicator is great. It helps me identify when crossover occurs without having to keep watching the screen.

Thanks a lot. Keep up the great work on your website.

--- 帖子 #1067 ---
the problem is your indicator uses the crossover price and not the actual price at time of crossover, might not be a problem as such, except in logic

--- 帖子 #1068 ---

Either would do. Have period 200 MA also to decern direction of trend.

Hi Erebus.

Yes you are right. It makes more sense.  I have changed it to show the actual price when the crossover occurs.

Thank you and enjoy your holidays.

--- 帖子 #1074 ---
are there any fakeouts with this strategy, if so how do we know when to stay away from them?, how do we tell the good from the bad ones? Look at my trade here, is this a good one ?  or can it be a fakeout?

--- 帖子 #1075 ---
You can filter out bad trades by waiting for a breakdown/breakout if you are in a congested area (s/r). Also the angle of the gold line needs to be 12-2 o'clock for longs or 6-4 o'clock for shorts. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #1084 ---
So first apologies. I'm not sure if it's right to post bits like this. It's only my second post on the forums. But I like the original thread and it's ideas. I played around with the idea and had some more ideas.

If I've understood this strategy right, that you're looking for a higher tf cross followed by a lower tf cross for entry, then could you swap your ma crosses for a single colour change ma? Since a change in angle from positive to negative and vise versa achieves the same as a cross but with less lag.

I've had a look at putting a colour change ema 200 and an 800 smma (less changes in colour) on the same 15min chart. So you get your 1:4 ratio as discussed in the original post. We look for a change in colour of the 800. When it does, if both 800 and 200 match you enter in the same direction. When price crosses over the 200 again, the direction will change along with the colour. You can exit here.

Effectively what's happening is you're entering when price crosses the higher tf ma and as the ema moves around a lot more and clings closer to price, when the momentum from the higher tf break runs out, inevitably the ema catches up with price for an exit close to the end of the move. You do catch some 10-20 pip losses at consolidation points where price returns to near enough the same place that it broke through. But when you catch the big moves you take 150+pips.

Thoughts?

--- 帖子 #1085 ---
I had idea for take a profit. It could be set 50% x Yesterday ATR.

If today we get a signal,  we can use yesterday atr for take a profit.

Its reasonable for make a money

--- 帖子 #1086 ---
@conrongumet

Could it be that the EA takes cross entries independent of main 200EMA direction??

As far as I understood  a valid cross entry has always to be in direction of 200EMA.

--- 帖子 #1087 ---
My EA take cross entries independent of main EMA because im not perfect code to add EMA as filter. But its very slow EA we cant make money very fast because my EA 1 order for 1 pair. But its very work. If we want to use other pair we need to change the setting. Look my trade explore for watching forward test of EA. I change the trailing stop. But perfect for manual entry. Still follow EMA 200. But sometime its need patiance. This strategy not for newbie because its have weakness for consolidation market and got stopped out. I try to now for manual trading until i got feel for this strategy. We read on page 1 RR could be 1:1-1:6 but the question its not reasonable for market consolidation. If we want to objective 50% Atr could be good. We can make money 1.5:1 and 3% every day its so good if consitance.

For manual entries my suggestion to use H1 because if we use TF H4 or higher we got big drawdown.  I got profit 14% but now only 4% return because i use it on H4. I use TF H1 i got 14%, and i use TF H4 i got drawdown 10% so hard. Now i back to H1, before i get feel for this strategy,  i use demo.

May I have the secondary file called MA Lawgirl21.mql as this file is the one to allow changing the colors and then re-compile the indicator into a saved state.

--- 帖子 #1115 ---
hesron,

The Indicator will NOT save any change data because it must be re-compiled and save the data. The SAVE Button is for set files which there is no mql Source Code (Second File) to save it too. Change a color or size, hit the Save Button and Okay and then change the TF, watch and see it reverts back to Default Settings.

If you do NOT have the secondary mql Source Code File just say so.
