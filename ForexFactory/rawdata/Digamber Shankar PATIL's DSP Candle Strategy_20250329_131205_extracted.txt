Not sure what the candle identifier is doing and what the DSP candle is. Do you mean find the largest candle in that time (24hr period as highlighted) and trade the opposite break of it? Is the reason for the candle identifier to show the largest candle only? Is the DSP candle simply the largest candle? This looks a lot like John templeton's trading in the buff setup. I think he goes on to say when it breaks back through you should be able to measure the initial move and expect price to make the same size move in the opposite direction. Most of the time.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Candle identifier make easier to find biggest candle. You can check this thread for more information as this strategy is based on this thread and my past experience with my trading gurus. No idea about templeton's trading strategy.

How to determine the TP levels? What is the winning percentage?

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Anywhere around 10 pips or you can follow trend till it reverse.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
SL always be 20-30p, so TP 10 pips is too little for this. Unless the winning percentage is high.

Hy Password! I do not understand what you are meaning with "at center" and "shift axis", see screenshot ... because at that time, when the first big candle at the left happened, you have to look back! 24 hours from -that- time/candle (by your rules)... what/where is "center"? , thanks, Dietmar

--- 帖子 #9 ---
If both (+ve and -ve) sides of candle length indicator are equal then horizontal axis (ie zero line) will be at center. If bulls are more powerful then it will move down and vice versa. Find the biggest candle amongst bull/bear candles

Well friends.. I am leaving now for dinner and sleep. Will try to update this thread regularly. Made all attempts to make it clear abt this strategy. But still there may be some flaws. Don't forget to mention them here. Don't suspects every strategy as loss making.. because trading is all about mindset. Good day!!!

--- 帖子 #15 ---
So if it is long bull and long bear candles, you take only the one trade, which is the longer candle? Attached Image (click to enlarge) In this chart candle 1 is longer then candle 2, axis level for candle 1 is 256.9, and for candle 2 is 224.9. So our market is bullish(watching on axis), so why we are going in sell trade, not in long? P.S. Market is bearish in this example.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
your explanation leaves a lot to be desired. does not make sense. you show a DSP candle on the identifier and DSP candle on the chart as well. but there is supposed to be just one DSP candle. you say if both +ve and -ve are the same then the horizontal line is zero, but thats obviously gonna be zero. so what is your point ? in one of the above chart, i think the first one. step 2, you show the longest candle on the identifier as a bearish candle. yet on the chart you are taking the trade based on a bullish candle !! so what is going on ?? also, what is the point of a 24 hour only chart ? these trades cannot be taken in real time, because the signals would have materialised in the past.....???? you trade 15m, if one traded 1 hour, u still use 24 hour chart ?? you are best to illustrate the rules on a chart as and when you take trades. showing examples of the DSP, bull/bear, in REAL TIME. best to post setups in advance so that people know why you are taking the trade. so that they may understand what you are talking about. with illustrations on the charts. .......you have now confused me to death, and i have become dyslexic....and incoherent.

Thanks for observations... Lots of questions. Try to find answers to all your questions frm following chart.. it made $100+ on demo account. Attached Image (click to enlarge) All in all it worked for me.. and may work with others. What i did is just followed what mentioned in first post of this thread. Frankly.. I don't have answers to your smart questions. Excuse me.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Why is it confusing? For a 24hr period that changes every 15 mins the largest bull/bear is recorded on the indicator, +ve and -ve..., which number is furthest away from the zero line? Match that to the candle and the direction has been decided.. two numbers the same... no trade, as no direction. The largest bull/bear candle will remain there until its beaten by another one, or it drops out the back of the 24hr window in that case the largest bull/ bear within the current 24hr window will be the reference candle. My current NU has +158 and -213 showing in the indi,, so bears in charge, look for break of the largest bear candle. Having said that, does the method work, who know's...

--- 帖子 #24 ---
So if bears in charge, why we are looking a long trade instead of short?

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Because on my NU 15 min, -213 is further away from the zero line than +158....... hence its short..... And a secret bit of information,, don't tell every one, also open up the NU 30Min,H1,H4,D,W,M time frames and see whether going short would be the the logical (remember this is forex so nothing is logical)...direction.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Must admit I would look to go short on the NU according to the indicators and other time frames however Password would take it long... seems back to front, but hey... its forex, 50/50..flip a coin etc

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Another option would be to use the open of a DSP candle as target and trade the move back to the open once the DSP closed (near earlier DSP candle open level). Enter when you see some decent PA and fade the $h!t out of it. One could say these DSP candles mark supply/demand zones because they move away so fast from a certain level. So there must have been a lot of people buying/selling at that level. And if they are supply/demand you could anticipate a breaktrough. I think this is what password is doing. You could also wait for a retrace after a close over the level. Spudfyre does something alike, but incorporates volume: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=402865

Failed Sell Trade

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Looks as though your trade should have been a buy at the open of the short candle, not a short....seems to work opposite to normal thinking... so you would be pip positive..

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Always a good idea to look at the higher TF trend to get the direction of the trend, as can be seen in the blow 1H TF chart we are in a very strong uptrend so the only signal I would be looking for on the lower TF's is a buy before I would consider entering. Where the magenta X and line is, is where your failed traded occured on the 15M TF

--- 帖子 #38 ---
I think he went short on the bull candle. The short candle wasn't there yet. One should have opened the short at the close of that bear candle. But when it closed it was the new DSP candle. So the question here is: to trade or not to trade. I say not. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Yep, agreed. 2 signal candles together, perhaps if closing candle is bigger than the signal candle then no trade, new signal candle in play. Incidently on my platform the short trade would have been an easy winner, my candle formations are different to Jurn e Just rechecked, i had set chart to 5 min hence candle difference..

--- 帖子 #40 ---
In this, DSP candle is long bear candle. Hence buy above its opening price. If you had followed this.. it will be a winner buy trade.

This is a very interesting method password. It reminds me of wide range bar trading. But basically this method only has you place trades when the WRB fails to hold the market. Very nice. I am amazed that so many are confused by this concept... Cheers and thanks for sharing! ~fighter

--- 帖子 #44 ---
For any who are still scratching their heads on how to trade this method.... Here is a current chart of EURUSD 15 min with only 96 bars(24 hours worth of PA) on the chart. There is a DSP(wide range bar) candle in play at the moment and in order to trade this we would need a close BELOW the open of this bar(the red line in chart) before going SHORT. Please see chart below. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Just trying out the method, so I took a short on GBPAUD at the 7:00 GMT close. STOP LOSS above the DSP candle's close. Profit target is set @ 1-1(this is my own idea and is NOT from the original method). We will see what happens. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hmm it seems that setting the refresh setting on the indicator doesn't solve the visual issues and the only way to clear it is to manually refresh the indicator. No real problem and doesn't sabotage the method... just a little annoying.

I doubt .. this chart having more than 96 bars. Plz check.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
No, I know it has way more than 96 bars. I just mark the 24 hr point and then analyze from there. Been working fantastically. However to be honest, I do add my own analysis into it for trend direction, current price pressure etc.... but I use this method for finding opportunities. So far I've had 6 profitable trades and 2 losses. All 1:1 RR or better at 2% risk. So I'm up more than 8% on the day. Really nice so far... Cheers mate! ~fighter - CHECK RESULTS BELOW - Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #78 ---
What do you do when you've traded a DSP candle and a new one forms, and both the traded and the new DSP are within the 24h period? Do you trade it or do you only start looking for opportunities again when the traded DSP candle is out of the 24h period?

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Who are you directing the question to? I trade this method slightly differently than the OP does... just so you know. With my style I look to see if the new DSP is heading in the direction of the longer trend, meaning that if the price were to break the open of the candle then it would signal a continuation of the trend. If it is going in the opposite direction and I am already in a trade headed with the trend then theoretically we should be in good profit at that point on the current trade because a DSP candle trade, with this method, is only taken when price comes back to close beyond the open of the bar. So in short, I dont do anything until price closes above/below the open of the DSP.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Good results.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Keep in mind, I'm not just shooting from the hip on these trades... I am looking at the longer term situation via hourly/4hr charts with my chosen tools and just using the DSP candles to signal that a potential trade opportunity has arrived and then measuring my risk via the size of the DSP candle. Then I go for 1:1 or better RR with my target, but like I said... in order for me to take a DSP candle entry as password has described, it needs to fit within the larger context and I make sure my money management is calculated properly.

it can be traded with 1H time frame or 5M time frame too.. Not only with 15M.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
cant see you have followed the rule on this one

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Which rule specifically? I just use the break of DSP candle opens to alert me to a potential trade, then I use that price as an entry lvl as explained in the pic below. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #87 ---
you have chosen the incorrect dsp candle. remember, the dsp candle is the longest candle displayed on the indicator. which is the long red bar on the left near the vertical line you marked , before the green bar you chose. therefore the candle you should choose on the chart should be a red bearish candle. correct me if iam wrong.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Well technically the red candle you are talking about is not within the last 24hrs from when I executed my trade, which is part of the original rules, to only look back across the last 24hr period. So, the green candle becomes the longest DSP bar. However, I don't get into it that fanatically, and I also trade these a bit differently. The red bar would have been the best one to use the day before because the trend was still bullish, but since the longer TFs signaled that a counter trend move was happening, I was looking for the longest bull DSP to use as my short entry lvl. But that is just me. I am happy with my results so I am going to keep trading this way... Cheers! ~fighter

--- 帖子 #89 ---
each to his own. iam more concerned that this system is losing its identity, like many others on this forum.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Hi guys,look like a very simple method to trade or we can integrate this into each and your own method,but dont change the original of this method,let the owner of this to do it. it will be better if the DSP indicator comes with alert, so that we can watch more pairs, currently i believe we have to scan all the chart for the DSP, hope some programers can add a alert to it. Thanks and all the best for you guys

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Yes, you are right. I suppose I shouldn't be injecting my own ideas into this thread since it is not mine... I apologize to all and to the OP for that. To be honest, I do think that a proper RR of 1:1 or greater is needed though, as the OP seems to think that a negative RR is OK. That was the main reason for my modifying things from his original idea. But, I will no longer add my flavor to this thread. Please continue to discuss the original method, it has a lot of promise. :-) Cheers, ~fighter

--- 帖子 #98 ---
As mentioned in the first post TP can be varies - Min = 10 pips. Another idea is tp = length of the DSP candle (in pips) One more idea is to follow the trend until it reverse.. ie till formation of another DPS candle.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
There is a chance when u ll get false signal. Put SL all the time. In this case, I doubt there are more than 90 candles and also at the time of bull candle, zero line might be at center. ie both bulls n bears equal. This strategy looks very simple and u may get instant results. But there can be exceptions too. Try to stick with the rules written on first post of this thread. Here is what I can see in my EU chart.. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Candle length indicator readings = 181 vs -186 Hence Find Long bear candle. (Even if there is long bull candle.

I use FXCM as well and that is an error in their MT4 feed. At the time news had just been released and the feed went down and didn't come back until 15-20 mins later. However, it doesn't make much difference to the method.

Digamber, I used your Candle indicator to determine the max and the min of the past 96 bars as shown by the indicator in the subwindow. The main window has two lines , Orange and Green and are based on your concept that the Open of the Max Candle is a sell (Orange)and the open of the min candle is a buy(green). Drawing these two lines, as they become effective yields a very interesting trading concept. Buy above the two lines, Sell below the two lines and if the pa crosses any line , use as a stop loss or take profit. Problem is that your indicator is a cpu hog and causes issues. I have sent you a private message with my email.

i get this with eur gbp???

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Have you checked the source code if it calculates on every tick? It does't have to. It also needs to calculate on every new bar and then only for the last bar. All others can be written into a buffer when initiating. Normally it shouldn't need much cpu power then. I am just writing on my own indicator to do this. Actually it draws the lines for the current bar and not for the past ones. This has to be implemented in future steps.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Pat Why do you need to use the other indicator? Why not just scan the last 96bars for candle body size and look for the largest buy and sell candles and use them to draw the lines. I've already written an EA for the system but it is not profitable so i'm still tinkering with ideas, currently testing in Zorro for multiple pairs. I do like your concept for a trading strategy though. Regards Mike

--- 帖子 #128 ---
The other indicator ( Candle Length indicator) helps to find on what side we have to look for the BIG DSP candle: Bullish side or bearish side.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
So does what i said, all you ahve to do is just check which candle size is bigger out of the max buy candle and max sell candle in the 96 bar range. That indicator is a visual representation but Pat1 is looking at using the idea to help make a successful trading strategy. My EA finds the DSP candle and draws lines for me so i can see the dsp candle, it also states the trade direction as well and enters when price crosses as stated in Post #1. I dont use the candle length indicator for any of this, that was the point i was making to reduce cpu overheads. This system seems to work well so lets see how it pans out, only forward testing will tell. Regards Mike

Dear Pat.. I would like to request you (and everyone) to follow trading rules mentioned in the first post of this thread. I am following those rules only and can comment on those only.

conglom, Password provided an ex file and not the source code hence the question. Cheers Pat

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Password, Just read your post. Just to clarify, the indicators on the chart is exactly your strategy. The difference is that you manually draw a horizontal line either a buy or sell depending on the max and min within the look back number of bars and their relative magnitude with respect to each other. The indi you see on the chart shows both, the buy and sell without considering the "magnitude" but does adhere to the look back your strategy calls for. This change allows trading with the trend unlike your concept which is counter trend. anyways, thanks for the concept and all the best. Cheers Pat

Hi ,i dont see EURGBP DSP in my chart, Any thing wrong with setup

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Hi, This is very simple. really, you don't need some indicator. But it simplifies the search. Only find largest candle (body) in the last 96 in M15. This is the DSP. Also, you need to compare DSP with the largest candle in the other direction. If both candles (body) has similar size, don't trade. it is all. With regards, Maudur

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Hi, Here is source code of similar indicator that display lenght of each candle body. With regards, Maudur

This candle is different then mine, your is bullish and the gap from somewhere, mine is bearish. Maybe missing some data. Attached Image

Thanks for your clarification ,is it anything to do with broker ?hope password can guide me here,could some kind soul edit this inductor with alert based on highest or lowest DSP candle . Thankz

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Pat, nice indy! That's exactly what I (and I presume most of us) am looking for. It does make life a lot easier, especially if you're looking at multiple pairs. Any chance you will be sharing it?

--- 帖子 #141 ---
I draw red line to just indicate the DSP candle.. so it will be easier for others to identify dsp candle and buy/sell limit in the main chart. However, if you are trading with other method and want to use this method simultaneous.. then its completely fine. Best of luck

--- 帖子 #142 ---
I am not the coder of this indicator. I got it somewhere in ff.com .. I have nothing to hide.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Hi, thanks Password for your system. I see on EURGBP DSP Bull candle, when will candle close bellow open prize DSP candle I will took short? Sorry my English is bad. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #144 ---
I doubt... more than 96 candles in the chart. (be careful with this). Restart your terminal frequently. But still Large Bull candle is DSP candle. Wait till any of the succeeding candle close below its opening price and put sell order. Stop loss should be at the closing price of dsp candle. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
hi seen this thread - good indicator - ever thought of using the strategy in reverses... just do opposite as the author mentioned... it works magically... regards rocky1980

--- 帖子 #146 ---
It doesn't matter how many candles you have in the chart if you use a proper indicator. I am just working on that. What I have in mind is: - either use fix number of candles or hours to consider (done!) -&gt; you can decide if you want always e.g. 96 candles or 24h to be considered (makes difference on the multiple timeframes) - show "bull" and "bear" line (done!) -&gt; stronger one has dash-dot-dot, weaker one dash-dot as style - show lines for the past candles (still some work to do) P.S.: the indicator on the bottom of the chart has nothing to do with the CandleSeeker! It's another one of mine but I didn't fancy to remove it for this image .

--- 帖子 #147 ---
EURUSD BUY, DSP, wait for candle close above open price, ok?

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Very nice and clean, but shouldn't your indy only show the bull OR the Bear, depending on which candle is bigger? That is, if you're creating it according Password's rules. Forget it. I just saw this: " stronger one has dash-dot-dot, weaker one dash-dot as style "

--- 帖子 #149 ---

--- 帖子 #151 ---
I like it with both candles to consider and with the different lines you always know which one is the one Password's strategy uses.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
I agree. And what do you think about a level when it has been crossed or traded? The sell trade in your image for example. The level has been crossed and/or traded, eventhough it is still the largest bull candle. Do you think it should dissapear from the screen as its is no longer (or is it) valid?

--- 帖子 #153 ---
At first you have to understand that you can't take look in the past to see any trades cause you need to know where the lines laid then. They could have moved until now. This is what is still missing in my indicator and I am working on. Any rules how and what to trade can everybody find for himself and I don't want to mess up Password's thread with that (unless he tolds us to do so ). So for now please let's come back to his rules and charts .

--- 帖子 #154 ---
You're right. Password, what would you do if the largest candle open has already been crossed/traded? Would you trade the second largest candle? Or wait for a larger candle?

--- 帖子 #155 ---
is there any chance this indicator can be made so that the candle length doesn't change on different timeframes? i mean, isn't it better if everything is relative? e.g. there can be a max and min. so if there is a HUGE spike, then that can be a 10. If cnadle doesn't move much that can be a 2. i think it will help with consistency when using different tfs...

--- 帖子 #156 ---

Don't understand what you mean. If you use different timeframes both candlelength and candleplace will not be the same cause the amount of minutes and therefore prices considered are different.

Password, In original thread that 24Hrs showed this system, there is nothing stating about 96 candles (or 24h period). Why do you insist in 96 candles on 15min chart then? Also, anyone tried to trade it on 5min chart? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
i know that, but like if we can have a FIXED range. e.g. on rsi there is a fixed range, even on different timeframes.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
i'm guessing you may think it's not a good idea, but look at it this way. if we can KNOW which levels are a good level for entry, we can apply this same level across the board.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Never take chance. Wait till another DSP candle. There are 25+ currency pairs.. plus gold and silver and other commodities and stocks. Try with them and find trading opportunities. This system can be applied to everything that trades in the world.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
I would like to suggest you to first follow rules mentioned in the main system. Check your results, if you are not happy then you can make your own rules.

Hi, had download the DSP candle line , but don't seem to be able to get it attach to the chart.

It works both ways... according to me the calculation of the DSP is based on Volume and Participation of the traders... and that's the logical point that if the High or Low breaks the new trend get underway.. similar according to master candle method of NickB - so no harm in trying and trading both ways. break of low - sell and break of high - buy.... i am sending some chart snap shots which i saw that this method also works...

Thanks PW n Hello to all Spend some time to modify an indicator to reflect your strategy, the code is not mine, the update to make like DSP is test it modify to suit, my programming skill are not that great it show the most recent DSP from 96 or whatever number of Bars you like to look back. After loading the indicator Press F8 and from Common Tab, Check Show Object Description, so it can show comment on line as well.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
For me, it's too complex. Here is an example long: Buy Stop / buy limit the "CLOSE" green candles DSP. Stop or limit according to current prices. SL is the "OPEN" green candles DSP. Rightly so?

Thanks for the modification, it works perfect now !

Hi Forexzak, Thanks for your Indi.its looks great for now,will test it out once market opens, is it possible to add an alert to it,such as when ever a DSP candle is formed an alert pops up after the close of the DSP candle,would greatly appreciate it . Thanks

--- 帖子 #190 ---
For me, it looks exactly like the original one. No DSP candles shown, no lines drawn... Maybe it works only when market is open?

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Just use the MT4 bult-in Momentum indicator with period 1 applied to Close prices. It is the same as the Candle Length Identifier, but it is better because it is account for opens with gaps. In addition with the thread's strategy, my opinion is dont use the DSP candle's open price cause of the opening gap. Instead use the prior bar's close price for the breakout level.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
PW: This forums is to share, please feel free to post it in first post

Shaikjun: The line is not necessarily formed on the current candle. Its form on the Highest/Lowest of last 96 candles, therefore, when to put Alert One idea is to Alert when price reaches/crosses near the DSP line. I would see, if its manageable within this code.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Hi Forexzak, your idea is good,then try your way.Thanks

hi just go thru .... one thing is to watch out for is that.. .once the DSP candle is recognized the trend decider is the High and Low of that respective candle.. in my examples shown ...it was all long setups.. i am not going as per the rule... please back test in this manner.. Rules : 1) Plot higher time frame chart - h4 - h1 (of any financial instrument) 2) Add DSP 3) Mark the candle (High and Low) not Open and close. with the longest Bear | Bull - DSP. 4) Trade in the trend of either side breakout - after the next candle closes, and stops at 2 points below / above the trade executed of the DSP candle. 5) Now just trail that... trade.. 5) Very important thing to notice is that on higher Time Frame the previous candles were the DSP is spotted.. that respective candles High - Low also works as superb S/R Zones. Price tends to respect that level and similar Price Action occurs on that particular price levels which indicates the major participation of the traders and institutions. 6) This indicator is build for perfect Price Action Traders. Just have to wait for the Pull backs for entries. 7) After back testing i have confirmed this points.. traders please back test this in major time frames, the results are highly profitable. here is the attached example of GBPUSD Chart H4 TF Attached Image Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) if any doubt ill correct --- just want to run...urgent call from one my associate... bye regards rocky1980

Hi everybody this is very interesting, if you consider the VST theories, about volume and candle size, as to recognizing the footprints of the Big Boys...the DSP candles must be somehow the mark of their actions...usually against retail traders, trying to push them to unload their trades at lower and lower prices, hitting their stops, whilst at the same time accumulating positions themselves...and finally going the other way...having collected the retail money.

Rocky - I see it as the original system, not the inverse. Usually long arrow points north.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Currency pair : Any (stocks, commodity also) Indicator: Candle Length Identifier STEP 1 : Look at candle length indicator carefully and observe its horizontal axis (ie zero line). If it is at center (ie.. both +ve and -ve sides equal) skip this chart. But if not, then check where it is shifted? Upward or Downward. If upward then find biggest Bear candle and if downward then find biggest Bull candle. This candle is nothing but DSP candle. Attached Image (click to enlarge) http://www.forexfactory.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=1320886&amp;stc=1&amp;thumb=1&amp;d=1385644219 STEP 2 : If this DSP candle is BULL candle then wait till any of the succeeding candle closes BELOW its opening price. Then, put SELL order. (This i do not prefer to do; as shown below the sell signal.... what if the the close is not below that shown 1st bull candle ...in 1st bubble and the market runs from there.... ? (Back test this for proof) (I don't say that system explained by the Author is wrong - this is my view) Attached Image (click to enlarge) http://www.forexfactory.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=1320889&amp;stc=1&amp;thumb=1&amp;d=1385644306 STEP 3 : If this DSP candle is BEAR candle then wait till any of the succeeding candle closes ABOVE its opening price. Then, put BUY order. (same applies here - if bear power is so strong... why would you buy ?) Attached Image (click to enlarge) http://www.forexfactory.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=1320890&amp;stc=1&amp;thumb=1&amp;d=1385644452 STEP 4 : Put stop loss at opening or closing price for bear or bull DSP candle respectively. Take profit can be varies starting from 10 Pips-minimum. Note : we loose the momentum which the stock or pair is gaining ahead....... and rather we wait for the entire rally to retrace and go long or short in respective of the trade we want to take... rest every body is free to will and trade... these are my views and i have back tested this.. god bless all regards rocky1980

Post 203 = This is the description of the original system, not inverse. "Put a stop loss at opening or closing price for bear or bull candle DSP respectively." Opening or closing is nonsense. Post 204 = input long be close to the blue candle, which is also the DSP.

Worked on AUDUSD too... What really I like about this system is rules are very firm and constant till date. I have seen many people post their strategies and keep updating till the end. Thanks password.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Why should you have to look at the shifting of the horizontal axis of the candle identifier. It is only shifting because of the large bars it is showing. The indy does nothing more than place bull/bear bodies in 1 place. If the largest bull is bigger then the largest bear it will shift the horizontal axis downward. There's no momentum nor any volume incorporated or any calculation whatsoever is used. Just find the largest bar within the last 96 and you've got your DSP. It would be nice to have the possibility to add the DSP candles indy to a larger timeframe. For example, set the indy to 1H and put it on 15m chart. We could then observe price action (engulfing, pinbars) around the 1H levels and trade it one of both possible ways.

Password thanks for bringing us this thread. Here is the EA i wrote for the system based on the rules in post #1. It is locked so only runs on demo accounts and only until the end of January. Please don't ask questions on how to load it and use it, use Google! It is set by default not to trade but to act as an indicator so finds last DSP candle and draws lines for you and the 24hr history box based on NumBars. It doesn't use any indicators all calculations are done internally. The settings are outlined below: SignalOnly=true; //Stops trading and make the EA behave like and Indicator NumBars=96; // Box length LineColor=Yellow; BoxColor=SlateGray; SignalOnly=false; //EA will trade based on rules Lots=0.01; //Trade Lot size RiskPercent=0; //scales lotsize based on SL RR=1; //sets TP to be 1:RR TakeProfit=0; //Overrides TP enter in real pips DspSlFactor=1.0; //Allows SL to be made less than DSP candle is desired DspEntryDelay=0; //Allows a delay of entry i.e. 1 means wait at least 1 candle before a valid entry can occur UseTS=0; //Adds a Trailing stop, 0= off, 1 = on TrailingStop=10; //TS real pips Please don't litter the thread with EA questions, respect the thread owners system this is just an aid.

Hi folks, been following this thread since it start. this system looks interesting and very simple to follow. The problem we should pay attention is MM which regarding to the risk and reward ratio, as per the rule from post 1, TP set as 10 pips which is not good compare to the SL, most of time DSP candle is large than 20 or even 30 pips. That means i have to risk 1% of my account to make only 0.5% or 0.3% profits. Any good ideas guys? Ren

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Where is the problem? As long as your percentage of winning trades is large enough, you'll be fine. You also can use a trailer so you won't get into trouble if the move stops e.g. at 8 Pip profit.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
yes, you are right, high win rate is the key if you have low RR, but why not to keep high win rate and make RR 1:1

Nope. If the Bull bar is the largest of the last 96 you sell when a bar closes beneath the open of that bar. According to this strategy that is.

Hi All Looks like an interesting thread, just a question about the Candle Length Identifier. Do you leave the 'Candle Body Only' option at true, or change it to false, which must use the wicks as well, both settings give different results. thanks Martin

All the rules are in the first post, my EA in signal mode aside from drawing lines and boxes out puts valid signals to the experts tab. The screenshot below is the current GU M15 and we have a long bearish red candle, see vertical green line, and so we are waiting for price to cross the upper yellow line for a BUY/Long trade. This si based on the rules in post #1. The second screenshot are my results using the rules in post #1 and no TS and a fixed Tp of 10pips. Hope this helps Mike

Look how price respects the DSP open as a supply zone. Nice. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #233 ---
ok.. i do understand. BUY if closed above DSP SELL if closed below DSP I dont understand the candle length indicator. buy X-axis is greater than Y-AXIS sell if Y-axis is greater than X-axis should the candle length indicator, tell whether to buy or sell?

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Not quite. BUY if closed above DSP (only if DSP is a bear) SELL if closed below DSP (only if DSP is a bull) I dont understand the candle length indicator. (Find the 1 largest bar of the last 24 hours, that's your DSP. Don't worry about the axis. This indy is just a tool.)

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Look at the candle length indicator, see the two numbers on the far right hand side? Positive number above the zero line and Negative number below the zero line.... which number is furthest from the zero line, negative or positive.. if its positive find the biggest buy candle on the indicator, if its negative find the biggest sell candle on the indicator. So if the indicator shows +120 and -170 then we look at the -170 as its furthest from the zero line..you then look for the biggest sell candle. The candle that you identify is now called the Dsp candle. If the DSP candle that you have identified is a Buy (usually green in most pics) then once price closes below the open of this candle, place a sell trade. Opposite for a Sell candle.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Maybe this indy will make it easier. Just set 'AboveBelowAxis' to 'false'. Now you will see all bars side by side without the useless axis. Now find the largest bar on the indy on the last 24hours (96bars if you're on a 15m). Found it? Is the corresponding bar on the chart a bull? Sell when a bar closes below the open of the DSP. Is the corresponding bar on the chart a bear? Buy when a bar closes above the open of the DSP. Attached File(s) Candle length hanover.ex4 3 KB | 623 downloads

Hey. Instead of worrying so much about having exactly 96 candles in your window I think it would just be easier to hit CRTL Y in metatrader to show a vertical line at your daily open (hour 0) and then just use that.. I think whether you have 96 or 106 or 116 candles is not going to matter. I assume the original idea behind the 96 was to look at the previous days extreme moves and showing your daily open line will give you a good idea of that. Just think it looks like people are getting strung up on the exactly 96 candles when its not that crucial. Josh

Hi Password, I have been testing this system and so far so good, all though I have questions on this method which has more to do with account management. If your TP remains 10pips in all trades will your SL ALWAYS remain at the opposite side of the DSP candle that triggered your entry, regardless of its size( number of pips) being used as SL. Showing that it would be over 2:1 or 3:1 Risk/Reward ratio. In other words whats the max SL to use for trading this strategy. Bearing this in mind, what percentage of account should best be used to trade. no matter how high the ratio of wins to loss is, added to the strategy should be a sound account management strategy since we know that the market is DYNAMIC!!

Let's see how this works out. RR 1:1

Templates do not switch DSP CANDLE STRATEGY, but dsp candle EA. He has very limited use. Not set TP.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Hi Password nice work, i am now just testing EA only on three pairs AUD/USD, EUR/USD and USD/CHF on 15 Min yestarday was good my trades on EUR/USD and AUD/USD hit TP i made around 21 pips on AUD/USD I can make more but i was not in front of my laptop.. i would like to test EA on real account but can't. thnks for your efforts

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Does anyone have this EA? I draw some line. EA enters buy when the close is above the line. Similarly to sell.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Here is an updated version of the EA that will run on Demo and Live accounts and is valid until 28th February 2014. Please test and see how it works and pm me with issues. Please refer to my last post for settings. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...72#post7147572 If you set SignalOnly to False it will trade so i have set Lots =0 so change this if you are sure you want it to trade. Please let me know of any bugs via pm. Regards Mike

After expiration will not work as an indicator?

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Thanks for EA, please is possible update EA with set for only one open position after DSP candle?

--- 帖子 #266 ---
can this ea perform backtest?

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Probably yes, but EA does not work correctly.

Please be clearer. What wrong with it? cheers

--- 帖子 #271 ---
hi traders the thread is going well and profitable as per the method.... please pay attention to the chart attached below... as per rule - Sell only below BULL DSP -- then why not buy also above... same goes for the opposite... chart attached please have a detailed look into this. Attached Image (click to enlarge) good up move missed in this... again yesterday the #EPZ3 formed DSP........ now what ? regards rocky1980 happy trading

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Its a reversal trading method. Big bull/bear candle represents the momentum in the market. Anything that goes against momentum indicates more powerful sign opposite momentum. Its all about finding a moment in the market... when buyers become sellers and sellers become buyers.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Just wondering whether anybody has managed to put together or thought about making a dashboard. It would be great to see at a glance when a pair gets close to a few pips away from it's DSP candle, saves trundling through all the various pairs. Otherwise, excellent method.

Absolutely, a picture is worth a thousand words....

Hi mike thanks for upgrading the EA, today it opened buy position on AUD/USD but not on EUR/USD Chart attach on my live account. anything i am missing..

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Author EA wants to sell. Hopes to find testers who do not mind expiration date.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Dear Dokopi, I see,... In my opinion , not a problem to buy and sell,.... its a value of hard work,.... I will PM Mike personally and see how,... Thanks for your explanation,.....

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Testing is also hard work. I wish you satisfaction with a purchased EA.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Yeah.. exactly that is what i expect from this thread and this strategy.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
My imperfect graphs look like this.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Hey guys, great strategy. I've tried the EA but doesn't work on backtest. Why? Has anyone backtested it yet? I think backtesting could improve our confidence on this system.....

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Hi all my today's results with EA 3 trades 2 hit TP and one Hit SL, so at the end of the day no profit no loss, i think during trading with DSP candle we need to look into other things like S/R, over all trend etc. hope passward will put more light on it thanks..

--- 帖子 #287 ---
As written on the first post... Warning : False signals may generate during big news declaration. Keep eye on forex news calender. Since this is the reversal trading, always check the position of DSP candle in the chart. If DSP BULL candle is at the very bottom of the chart, don't SELL trade, similarly, if DSP BEAR candle is at the very top of the chart, don't BUY trade. In my view no EA can do this.. so its not advisable to trade with ea. Manual trading is better for such time of systems.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Like all of systems, this one does not work 100%,too.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
I guess that that when you got THE signal that THE long red bar left in Your chart still was THE dsp candle cheers

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Hey sh!thead! Why dont you just awnser my question instead of being a anoying troll

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Any good coder plz come forward and code this strategy. I tried it on 5 min charts it works like charm. Requesting all expert coders here to plz code this strategy.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
How many candles are you looking back on 5min tf to define which candle to consider as DSP candle, please?

--- 帖子 #293 ---
I'm backtesting it on 4H and Daily TF using 96 candles. How do you take profit guys?

--- 帖子 #294 ---
trend continue for 3 more candles.... check trend strength in the time frames --- always propels to max 3 -4 candles... u can analyze by using ATR for TP regards rocky 1980 Merry Christmas to all members....

--- 帖子 #295 ---
So, you mean to take profit at the 3rd candle after the breackout or at ATR value (choose the lower one)? I've undrestood correctly?

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Hey guys, I've noticed a bug on the Candle lenght indicator. I need to restart MT4 every 10 minutes to make it work properly. How have you solved thid problem? I've a green and a red histogram on the same price bar... Here is the chart Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #299 ---
I'm also testing this on the daily TF. Let's see how this work out for me..

--- 帖子 #300 ---
The indicator shows candles with two colors simultaneously. It would be better to resolve indicator DSP candles.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
I've tested it on my plaform and works nicely. I don't have the source file of DSP candles

Hi Password, i dont speak english very well and i dont undestood all post until here Please can you attach here the last EA and the last candel indicator ? Thanks Armyda

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Hey Password, we need to think to some TP rules... I've visually backtested and I think that 1:1 R:R could be a good start

--- 帖子 #308 ---
SL = PT = 10 pips?

--- 帖子 #309 ---
No, SL=TP= Body candle lenght As this system works on any timeframe, IMHO we should condider something that works on any timeframe i.e. 10 pips on a daily chart is not a good TP nor SL

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Exactly this is how I am trying to trade this strategy. Because winning rate above 60-70% on 5 min tf - 60 candles. but for this it require well programmed ea. Eas available here are not opening trades even after DSP candle crossover.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Hi,MAGFT is possible later to get your EA in real account? thanks Armyda

Has anyone yet made a backtest of this strategy over the last 10 years e.g.?

--- 帖子 #314 ---
I should know how many candels i have to set in DSP setting. if i want trade with a TF day.24 candels?

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Built an EA over the last weekend and checked the EURUSD from 2011 on. Based on the original rules the strategy ist NOT PROFITABLE, but I still think that the idea itself is good so that some work on the RM/MM rules and filters from higher timeframes, checking resistance and support levels e.g. might result in a good one. Anyone who is interested in discussion about that can reach me on Skype.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Very True.... the Risk is too much.... some more expert filters needed..... help ! Help !! Help !!!!

--- 帖子 #317 ---
can u plz share ur ea here for demo testing?

--- 帖子 #318 ---
By it's very nature in set up the trigger bar will hold support an resistance at it's open and close, if it is green and the open is Brocken and closed below then there are slot more than 10 pips on the table, if the longest candle has a close above there is great probability of a continuation....... Enter half position on close above and enter second half of position on a retrace into what would now be a two candle set up, ........... If taking position on break of low wait for close and enter half position, wait for retrace to enter other half .........both cases you can take profit at risk/reward 1/1 on one half move stop to break-even on second half and let that run until you see opposite price action the other way.......if you hit a good trend you could well be in at the start of a 2or 3day move add a 100 and 200 ma to your chart and use this for direction and s/r only trade above below or off of all on 1hour time frame "..... All the Best Wolf

Hahaa.. There are many people here who are in search of NEW trading strategy everyday. So whenever any expert (?) discloses his strategy.. people just bang on it.. and he keeps on updating his trading rules for rest of the life and people think he did some extraordinary work. I have wasted lots of time with such threads. And stay away frm ff for this reason. As far as this strategy is concern.. rules are same frm the beginning and results depends on ur ability and patience.

Dear all, have been following the thread. My mt4 upgraded to build 610 and I can not run the expert in my charts, do not understand why.. The template draws lines directly to the main chart window - but does not add the new window below chart showing the bars. I have some experience with programming. But I simply can not open the ex4 file to see the code. Can anyone help - advise? many thanks

hi everyone... the thread has almost died.... please check this DSP trade on EURUSD H4 Note - I am not trading this as conventional method please note... please post the trade ideas if any... thanks regards rocky

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Yes, indeed. After finding out via an EA that DSP doens't work (for me) I came back to my roots. Anyone profitable just with DSP over the last few months?

--- 帖子 #171 ---
HI it works... depends on other technicals getting correct... success ratio of 60 % almost... major trends reverses... dont on EA .... regards rocky

--- 帖子 #172 ---
I wrote an EA based on the rules - and it doesnt work in the long run. Will upload backtest if wanted. Maybe you can use DSP as a filter but it is not profitable on its own.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
very good strategy.Well although the DSP candle may not always give you a trade but whenever it gives, its profitable.Most importantly the DSP candle acts like a strong support or resistance .
