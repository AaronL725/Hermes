Hi Mates! i just want to show the way i trade, this is nothing new at all. i have trading for 4 years, mi profit was from 5% to -10% until y drop all indis and oscilators, why? because some times the idis lies and give falce signals, allways repaints and wen you do backtes it looks awesome untill you trade live you get disappointed. Now i trade only with price accion using GMMA and i need to tell you guys that its an exellent way to trade! the rules! trade using m5 and m1 first thing to do is wate for the long gmma (blue) in m5 to get xpanded then wate for retrasement and then shift to 1m, wate for the short to xpand and place a trade. i use 15 sl, 15 tp and 5pips capital protection and 7 pips trailing stop only trade in prime hours (when 2 sessions are overlap)(i only trade eurusd, eurjpy and audusd) and avoid news 15 min before and after, dond forget to trace lines, wedges, triangles, s/r and stuff. i will post every day my trades the loosing and the winners, i have 75% of good trades! happy trading for all! (go to post 93 to see latest rules) (go to post 267 for new indis and templete http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=267 ) pd. please feel free to comment (bad or good) sorry abouth my english

--- 帖子 #3 ---
some good books!

Looks like a profitable system. Thanks for sharing!

--- 帖子 #5 ---
patience its the name of the game! never ever force a trade and never try to predic wath the market its going to do, only flow with it!

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Rohule, I would be interested to learn what your exit strategy is with this system. Seeing that it is essentially scalping.... do you have a set number of pips you usually go for or do you simply trail your stop loss? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Hey This is a lot like Linuxtrolls threads but he trades off the 5 second chart. Have you read his posts? Where did you learn this strategy? How long have you been trading this strategy? Do you trade for a living? How many hours a day do you trade? I like what I see Joe Also, linuxtroll said that WMA are way better for the smaller timeframes then emas?

--- 帖子 #8 ---
hi all! i have been trading for 5 years and testing to namy systems on my career, and yes i trade for a living and trade only at tokio overlaping and uk with us. this is nothing new but its really really awesome! if you guys wanna know something more abouth it: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=10448 http://www.guppytraders.com/gup329.shtml http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=8742 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=91398 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=6917 http://www.downarchive.com/ebooks/vi...anagement.html Inserted Video Inserted Video

hi! yes this is scalping, im looking for 10 to 15 pips of profit before some retrasement(choppy market), if i have big candles i let the trailig stop do the job for me

--- 帖子 #10 ---
this is very important!!! TACTICS Join established trends at points of price weakness Join established trends breaking to new highs Trade breakouts using rally dips and rebounds Trade downtrend rallies as rallies rather than trend breaks Recognise trend breaks as they develop RULES Degree and nature of separation in the long term group define trend strength and weakness Degree and nature of separation in the short term group define the nature of trading activity. Degree and nature of separation between the two groups of moving averages define the character of the trend. Compression shows agreement on price and value. Compression of both groups at the same time indicate major re-evaluation of stock and potential for a trend change Trade in the direction of the long term group of averages The relationships between the groups provide the necessary information about the nature and character of the trend. Do not use as a moving average crossover tool ADVANTAGES Enables effective analysis of the trend environment Improves selection of the appropriate trading tactics Better understanding of trend strength Effective evaluation of unusual price movements, such as dips and spikes Effective understanding of trading activity and behaviour DISADVANTAGES Not effectively applied to trend less stocks Cannot be applied to all trending stocks Do not use as a moving average crossover signal

I hope you stick around and post your trades. I was loving Linuxtrolls thread, but no one else was making any money from his system except for him. A lot of people tried for months and couldn't make money. He said WMAS worked way better for the smaller time frames and EMAS wernt nearly as good. I would love for you to prove that wrong. How do you determine your stop loss? Do you quit for the day after X ammount of pips? What's your daily goal? I also love this because everyone says scalpers fail. Would love for you to prove them wrong. Most of these GMMA threads only lasted 5 pages, so it seems like it's a faily strategy to me? I like being proven wrong though Happy Trading!

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Thanks for sharing this. I have been scalping some successful results in 10 second/1 min chart with similar system. Hope to see more trade examples from you in this thread.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
thanks rohule!

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Hye F-Trader Between 5sec and 10sec, which one would be much better to trade with M1 chart? Would like to know your opinion based from your own experience. Currently I am testing with custom MT4 script/indicator to generate 5sec and 10sec chart. Thanks in advance. ~profi~

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Hi Profi To my trading style 10sec chart fits better with 1min chart, but i have used 5sec with 30sec and 1min chart.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Successful trade! Attached Image (click to enlarge) I took it too early but at the end it hit happily to TP

--- 帖子 #17 ---
exellent trade F-trader!! please keep posting! this is for better looking for the entry, i wanna stay out of idies but we never know (macd guppy) just i case if someone need it

--- 帖子 #18 ---
hi mate! well... i like the way EMAs looks and im conforteble with, i use a 15 stop loss if the market after the entry duddelntly go againts me, after i get 5 pips i move to BE, and wating to get 10 t0 15 pips. but you can also use g#macd to enter (everytime that cross over and cross above or below 0) and olso to exit. some scalpers fail because they dond have the enough skill for trading such a small tfm, they enter in a trade and then analize if the trade was good or not and keep small profits and long loosers. and yes this is a hard job to do, but let me tell you something, the reward its big money. im making 10 to 25 pips per session (2% a day) if i have 3 winners in a row im off the day also if i have 2 loosers cheers!

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Thanks for the reply, that makes sense. Why do you use 10-15 pip stop loss? That seems rather big wouldn't the emas have already crossed over showing you its a weak trade so you could get out earlier? Do you look at the candlestick formations or are you purely looking at the emas? What emas are they? I don't use metatrader You said you're trading like 4 currencies, how do you keep track of them all? Do you put them all on one screen and then look for the ones that are trending and then pull up the 1 minute chart? Sorry for all the questions, I'm just really interested in this method Thanks alot, joe

--- 帖子 #20 ---
avoid this kind of market at all cost! (big candles up and down with no especific way) the us market its closed, my advise is to shut down the pc and enjoy life, tomorrow will be another battle to figth!

--- 帖子 #21 ---
also this can help for you to set the sl and tp

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Hey ro, I noticed you were looking up everyones threads yesterday (im a stalker) I just found a recent one that was started that you would have missed probably because it's just called scalping or something. I remember him from 2007 in Linux thread, after thousands of hours screen time he figured out a GMMA system that works great for him. He uses WMA and also an indicators. You don't like his indicators but his is based on the wmas. When price pulls back and then closes below whatever wma he uses that would be a signal. So it gives you great signals to! You might want to check it out, maybe you could learn something? If not, it's still a good thread to read. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=262960

--- 帖子 #23 ---
hi Joe! if i dond see straingth in the first 5 min im out, if the trend is starting to resume the trend im start to analize for another entry. the EMAs are:1) Short (Fast) Group: EMA(3), EMA(5), EMA(8), EMA(10), EMA(12), EMA(15) 1) Long (Slow) Group: EMA(30), EMA(35), EMA(40), EMA(45), EMA(50), EMA(60) i only trade 3 pairs (eurusd, eurjpy and audusd), i wate so see the 5m blue guppy(long) to be expanded and thend switch to m1 and wate for the contraction (the contraction shows agreement for the trend in place) and then entry if it start to expand, and yes, im also looking for engulfing, dojis and stuff for better entry and exit, also you can use elliot wave have a good one! and remenber the 5m long guppy needs to be start to expand and fresh!

--- 帖子 #24 ---
thank you beehivesjoe! actually it is a good thread, we should work toguether! have a good one!

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Hi rohule, really great system! I do not quite understand what you mean with your above statement. Do you mean for every new entry on the 1m the 5m long guppy needs to compress and expand again? Or what do you mean with "fresh"? Thank you, Oliver

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hi ,Thanks rho I've been trading for a few years now, and I've had a hard time sticking to one strategy. It helps a lot knowing you trade for a living, I've always been trying to figure out how to trade GMAA. I will defiantly be following this thread Does this work on any timeframe? Lets say I wanted to trade the daily? Would you just use the Daily and your signal and then enter off the 4 hour? My last question for the day, once you get your signal and move down to the trigger frame, do you exit based off your trigger frame or do you move back up to your signal timeframe to base exits? Sorry for the dumb questions Happy Thanksgiving!

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Hi Olarion! yes, wee have to enter rigth after the compresion of the short guppy(white) and the long guppy (5m)must be expanded after the firts swing, i oly trade the 2th and the 3th, maybe the 4th, after it can be dangerous,

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Do you only trade the 5 and the 1? OR do you trade others to? I was just wondering why you chose these timeframes over the 30 second and 5 seconds? All the big moves start from the smaler time frame? Just a thought.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
thank you joe! here in Mexico we dond celebrate thanksgiving but than you! i apreciated, and happy thanksgiving for you and for all you people! Actually this system was designed for daily tf, and yes you can enter a trade on 4h, i use 5 and 1m because i like more acction. i get the first signal from 5m, then i switch to 1m, if the trade last more than 5 min i switch again to 5m to have better looking of whats going on.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
hi! I also use 15 and h1 so i can see the hole picture (on higher tf i focus only in the short guppy) The market does not really has tf, we can watch any tf we like for better understanding, the moves can happen on 1m 5m h1 etc, i like 1m and 5m because i like to be in action and i dond like to wate to long for taking a trade or taking profits. best regards!

--- 帖子 #31 ---
to Joe! dude you need to stick with one sistem, any one you like and trade all the way, need to be patience, stick with one and mastered! like Mr. bollinger said: there are no not bad systems, only bad traders, you have to pick a sistem, any sistem and trade it!

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Yes master I've figured this out a few weeks ago! You put it into much better words though. If I could give you vouchers I would The problem is.. I like them all! So many cool strategies, I'll stick with one and then see another awesome strat. That's the problem with forex To many cool things! I'll defiantly agree, I need to stick with one. My problem now is which one.. I like yours a lot, but what I've been doing for the past few days is plotting the .25 .50 .100 round numbers on the chart. When price reaches these numbers (im watching on the 5) I see how it reacts. If it looks like it's going to reverse off of it (usually it reverses back to the previous one ex .50 down to .25) I go down to the 5 second chart and get in with a 2 pip stop. when I get 3+ positive I move my stop to BE and see where it takes me. My biggest problem is I don't know if I want to trade profit at x ammount of pips each time like 10 pips or keep moving to break even and letting it go. Because if you enter in the direction of the main trend you could ride it for 100s of pips with huge leverage (only using 2 pip stop) That's my problem (love to hear masters thoughts lol) Happy Trading! joe

--- 帖子 #33 ---
After talking with my mom for a bit.. (visiting for thanksgiving ) I've come to a conclusion. IM RETARDED! You are trading for a living (my goal since 7th grade) You are posting your strat! You are posting examples. Why would i try to figure something else out?! I'm writing this down now for a promise to myself with witnesses. I WILL FOLLOW THIS STRATEGY ONLY!!!! Thanks a lot man! Hope to see you on the other side soon I have a job where I can trade during the job, so I don't need to trade only just yet. But is your recomended ammount to start with to build my account? I don't have a ton of money, but I will keep putting money into my account each paycheck (a certain %) until I have proven to myself I can trade for atleast a year making gains. How much is enough to start with to have a decent ammount at the end of the year if it was you trading it How much did you start with? Thanks so much, you are my hero ! joe

--- 帖子 #34 ---
thank you joe! thank you joe but i dond deserve that (but thank you i appreciate a lot) the thing here its that you need to became you own hero, how? with hard work, books, screen time ,patience and the most important thing is self confidence, if you are thinking like a pro you will be a pro! i recomend you to start with 100 bucks acc using .001 lots (one cent per pip) on live acc, i dond like demo because we never really trade like the same, once you have a preatty decent % of winning then trade 1000 acc, easily you can make 1% every day so at the end of the month you will have 10% at least, and then its only matter of time!

--- 帖子 #35 ---
hi rohule, your trading sounds very smart indeed ;-) here is a screenshot with a guppy template and my indicator volcanowma.mq4 just check this out: http://img816.imageshack.us/img816/5...etatradera.png our trading is very similar. you wrote some rules on the first page that i follow too but didn't notice them in my thread. i'm a kind of synthetic person if you get what i'm saying. I tend to go straight to the goal and and skip over the things who sound logic to me. keep in touch.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
and now the same screen with my template: http://img808.imageshack.us/img808/7...0metatrade.png both really worth it ;-)

--- 帖子 #37 ---
here could be a very good combination of our strategies: using Guppy MMA Oscillator when looking for short and an arrow appears with a cross happening below the zero line or when looking for long an arrow appears and a cross happening above the zero line then it 's a good signal on both strategies. check out the picture: http://img220.imageshack.us/img220/7...0metatrade.png just some thoughts...

--- 帖子 #38 ---
rohule. Keep posting those trade examples with 5 min &amp; 1 min charts side by side.. Thanks for your hard work

--- 帖子 #39 ---
hi ro thanks for posting your system. i had a look at your first charts you posted. too many things going on. i dont understand where to enter and exit trades ? what do we look for and any filters to be used ? can you please clarify. thanks

--- 帖子 #40 ---
hi Kikoolol and friends! here i attach one of my trades using volcanowma and G#macd that indi do you think that will work better? and also im thinking in how to avoid false signals, how do you think we can do that?

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Good idea! I was having a tough time figuring out which thread to follow, because I liked both strats, combining them sounds amazing But all I can say is don't complicate the method.. if you've been trading this for a living why change it? Why add anything else to it if it's been brining in 2 % a day?

--- 帖子 #42 ---
hi mates! i think the only way to avoid false signals and place better trades are: when all conditions are met( blue guppy well expanded 5m rigt after the first swing and compresion) then switch ti m1 wate for the white emas and price to touch the blue emas (the blue emas must be expanded and in direction of the trade) and take tha trade rigth after it resumes the trend (when the white ema are compresed and start to expand) . for better looking you can enter the trade when the red macd guppy crosess the blue guppy

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Wouldn't you guys have a complete different signals because one uses a complete different set of mas and one uses wmas and different number? Or are they pretty much the same..?

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I think it's useless to use Guppy indicators with Guppy Template: http://img256.imageshack.us/img256/2...tatraderal.png i'm still struggling with fake signals too...

--- 帖子 #45 ---
here i attach prime levels and short guppy GMMA with better look. and please mates, for better understanding of Guppy GMMA read all the documents i attach on the firts page! a lot of pips for all!

--- 帖子 #46 ---
yes, you r rigth, thats why i dond like oscillators only price accion, but it can be usefull if you only look the oscillators when all conditions are met, it can hel for set the entry

--- 帖子 #47 ---
75% winners seems pretty good to me? You can't have a 100% win rate, your always going to have some fakeouts.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
avoid this kind of market, green and red big candles going nowhere, the key for this estrategie is momentum!

--- 帖子 #49 ---
with the guppy template and my indicator the arrows sometimes appear hidden behind the short terms MA's so i changed some settings for your template making arrows visible outside the short terms group. (in this choppy market i stay out because my ma's are almost horizontal)

--- 帖子 #50 ---
thanks friend! its good to work toguether! my best wishes for you!

--- 帖子 #51 ---
another good one! im done for today 25 pips! the best and safe trades are when pa and short term ema touch the long emas i enter in m5 and its confirmed by m15

--- 帖子 #52 ---
I thought you traded the 5 and the 1? When you change timeframes do you change your stop/target? Example on the 15 and the 5 is your stop bigger then 15 pips and target more then 10-15? Thanks joe

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Check out Wickers thread if you haven't already. Maybe this would help you filter some of your whips? http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=40325

--- 帖子 #54 ---
i see 3 time frames at the same time, my first entry signal provider its de 5m, if the 5m pa touch the blue ema and then resume the trend i enter in the trade only if m15 are agree, and i use the same tp and sl

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Thank you! And thanks for the indi, it helps timing the entry. Today so far i have had 3 similar trade to this. All them got stopped by trailing stop. I guess i should stop them manually somewhere at +8 - +10 pips. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #56 ---
hi F-trader! Congratulations! im glat to see that you are having success! and yes it will be grate that you close the trade manualy at 8 to 10 pips and wate for another entry

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Hi mate, i'm working on a new indicator based on your strategy and mine. and i have to say that it starts to look very amazing: http://img843.imageshack.us/img843/7...0metatrade.png and of course it doesn't repaint ;-)

--- 帖子 #58 ---
I keep reading about repainting indicators. What does that mean? Sorry lol I've never figured that one out. Also are you going to stick with your WMAS or trade the guppy emas now? How are you changing the indicator? I'm excited there are traders out there trading this guppy method Did you guys check out the wickers thread? He used a lot of indicators with it because it would help with a lot of the fake outs. A lot of people didn't like it because theres only a few signals a day, but they are very accurate?

--- 帖子 #59 ---
thank you so much dude! is this VOLCANOWMA[last-version].ex4 ? cos i dond have the same arrows as you! thank you and have a good one!

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Hi joe! repaint means that for example, when the indi says that its time to enter short and the secont after it change his color and direction and tell you to enter long or if its an oscillator it changes the line that it use tu be making wonderfull when you are doing backtesting but when you trade live you get very dissaponted and im only going to trade GMMAs, the same way all my life. i wanna stay out for all oscillators, you need to get used to watch the market only with price acction some emas and one oscillator at most, why? because when you are going to place an order the oscillators makes you hesitate, you need to figure out whats going on and react. have a good one!

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Guppy profiles can also be incorporated into longer term trading, and with fib overlays, can produce very profitable trades. I don't scalp, and pay attention to existing profiles and PA placements as fundamental factors approach. I live over on Stocky Monk's thread, and generally trade on a 4 hour and use the one hour, or sometimes lower, for my entries. Nice to see this thread, and will take the time to read once back on a laptop... currently on a Blackberry whilst travelling home.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
no, the new indicator in my thread is just the same as before with less fake arrows during flat market. now i'm trying to improve mine, and after when it will be done i will try to improve the one i showed you above . but not ready yet. i agree with that !

--- 帖子 #63 ---
If you've been trading for so long, you should know by now, that you cannot scalp with piece of sh*t tool like MT4, using 2+ pips spreads , even if you are genius.... You need some serious professional tools and data feed to be successful with scalping: very low spreads (below 1 pip), lightning fast executions and close to none slippage. You'll lose your a$$ trading this "system" with regular MT4 bucket shop. This is a f* guarantee..

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Hi Skyzer! im trading with 1.9 pips of spread with upgrade conection, and actually im very profilable with this methoth, every trade is in 9 to 20 pips of profit and -15 of sl so i dond really care abouth 1.9 pips spread, i probably care abouth .5 pips of spread if i only hopping to get 2 or 3 pips per trade. im not trying to sell nothing here im only here becouse i wanna contribute and if someone want to meke this better its well apreciated. and if you say that this does not work, maybe it doesnt work for you and you need to keep studiyng and trying harder! (like i'd said, there are no bad systems only bad traders) have a good one!

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Sounds good condor! Can you post some of you guppy-Fibonacci trades? So we can figure out how to use them with guppy, thank you and nice to meet you!

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Hi Rohule, an answer I posted some time ago regarding 4hr chart trading and using simple expansion studies: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=323 An example of how I use Fibonacci fans, expansions and standard plots: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=746 I will only trade in the direction of the 4hr and up in most instances... I do think the 15m chart can give better entries, but have learnt to place smaller lots and bigger stops to help the heart, and take positions from the 1hr, mostly. I try not to scalp, but do consider it on retraces into larger time frame Guppy convergences.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Thanks for this thread. I love the GMMA because it makes it obvious when it's not trending. A regular 2 moving average strat its kind of hard to tell sometimes. Very easy to see and play. Thanks a lot!

--- 帖子 #68 ---
hi guys! also give a try at http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=155434 , it explains how to anticipate to a trade, we can use this methot with GMMA and works very very nice!

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Hi rohule, this sound interesting...could you give a chart example how you would use this strategy with the GMMA? And what timeframe works best for this method? Thanks, Oliver

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hi Olarion! here is an example that i just trade, im using it in 5m at seems to be working fine!

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Thank you, great trades!

--- 帖子 #72 ---
hi all! i did some backtest using GMMA with Urban towers and it seems to work very well only in the firts and second wave so be aware

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Hi rohule, Since you use my indicator in your trading i give you the link to the last one and it is really better: http://cdn.forexfactory.com/attachme...9&amp;d=1291070902 I tried to combine your rules and mine but i think i won't make a better one: you can check out my last post for the changes i made: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=151 I wish you many pips !

--- 帖子 #74 ---
thank you so much mate! looks very promising! have a good one and have a nice pips!

--- 帖子 #75 ---
another 2 good trades using urban towers and GMMA! im using it on 5m and 15m, m1 need to much attention and skill

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Rohule, I've been looking at and studying the Guppy method on and off for the past couple of years. I also am one of those people who have looked at a lot of different systems trying to pick the very best one. To be honest the Guppy system makes the most sence to me. Do you know the Gmacd setting numbers that the macd is using? I've never used the gmacd or the guppy mma oscillator before (just used the Guppy system ema numbers) Could you explain the Gmacd and Guppy oscillator and how these two indicators are used? Are they accurate for trading? If a person uses all three indicators: 1). Guppy system, 2). Gmacd, 3). Guppy oscillator. Are you able to get very accurate trades? Thanks for all your help. snarlyjack

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Hi snarlyjack! actually i only put gmacd for help the newbies to enter the trade, noting more, what i use for entry is guppy selectible of put collor in the first and last emas on short guppy, when it crosses i enter. and also im looking at candles patterns, s/r, trend lines, triangles and stuff. and all trades in agreement to 5m and m15 trend

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hi rohule, could you show a picture (or provide your template) how you set and use the guppy selectible indicator? In your last picture I only see the GMMA long and short indicator... Do you not use the 5m/1m entry anymore you explained before? Now only the cross of 2 emas? With regard to the higher timeframe? Thank you, Oliver

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Rohule, Thanks for your answer. Are you talking about the 3 ema cross with the 15 ema? If so it makes sense to me. thanks snarlyjack

--- 帖子 #80 ---
hi guys! i still using MTF with guppy to enter, if im going to enter im 5m i most go i the direciont of m15, and if i see a trade in 1m it most be in the direction of m5. but for more easy entries i put color in the firts or second and the last ema, it helps a lot and you cant make a better desition. its not nesesary placing an order every time it croses, some times it can only touch or compression and expansin. you can improve this method way better using 123, engulfing, haramy, pin bars ect. i use a lot for better entries. i have had a not as good week as i want it because the maket were very erratic this week, i wanna see how will be the next week.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Hi rohule I wish you success and happiness! Kindest regards FXcube

--- 帖子 #82 ---
thank you friend for your kind words! i wish you de best too! have a good one!

--- 帖子 #83 ---
hi guys! if you have some trouble in seting the entry try this: 1. when the 5ema cros the 10 ema 2. when the price touch the 10 ema (only 5m) 3. when de price touch long guppy and then resume the trend and for better entryes i use pin bars, engulfings and inside bars. all in the direction of 5m and 15m trend! sl is no more than 15 pips and tp is 15 pips, capital protection 5 and 8 pips trailing stop. i also use prime leves to set s/r cheers!

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Hallo mr. rohule, Do you practice any time base exit?can I post my trade here so that you or anyone can post up any advice or comments? Thank you

--- 帖子 #85 ---
hi gugugaga! what i do for exit is wate to reach 10 pips, after that im watching the 5m tf and wating for candle formations, if i see a reverse pattern in close the trade and if i see a continuation i let it run with 8 pips trailing stop, and aslo i use cci to confirm momentum so i can get in the rigth swing, if you or some need the money management EA or the cci that i im using only ask! and please post your trades, that will be usefull for all of us! cheers!

--- 帖子 #86 ---
a very good examples of guppy this nigth, the first 2 trades were taking by 123 pattern and cci, the 3th it by engulfing and m1 confirmation (notice that after the 2 candle after entry cci was confirmed) all the entryes are after guppy confirmation.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Thank you sir for the insight,I always having problem with my BE,maybe I alaways move too early,I will try your Idea next time.tank you,here is my trades today,sorry for the messy chart,will try to improve tomorrow.

hi guys! after long time of using guppy this will be the new rules, better understanding, fast recognition and more pips! rule one: trade in the direction of long MMA, only short trades under guppy and only long trades above guppy. rule two entry 1) put 5 and 10 ema, wate for first swing in any direction and wate for the price to touch 10 ema, one the price touch it get redy to place an order when the price resumes the trend (place a trade when the next candle closes above the 10 ema if long and closes below if short) entry 2: rule one and candle patters like pin bar, engulfing etc. entry 3: rule one and place and order when 5 ema crosses 10 ema. for exit wate for reversal pattern or use the last candle +3 pips or when the emas crosses each other. after 5 pips go BE trade during market orverlapping and avoid news, 15 min before and after. no trend, no trade!

I did not do well with the GMMA on short TFs; in fact I lost money. But I bought Guppy's "Trend Trading" and have set up the ema s on Oanda 3H TF &amp; have made a few pips. I guess I am not a scalper and Guppy's examples, share trading &amp; not forex, are all daily, weekly, monthly, etc. So 3H is as short as I will try right now. Maybe with experience I can drop down a TF or two. Right now I'm not trading at all, waiting until mid week next year. Thanks to all who have posted. p.

Hey rohule, what hours do you normally trade? Any days you avoid?

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Hi steve! I normally trade Tokyo and US overlapping UK, if I cant sleep I trade all uk session, and avoid days with low volume, if I see a nice trend I place a trade, and be careful on pivot and news. I mainly trade 5m with 1m for perfect tunning trades.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Rohule, Just wanted you to know that I'am trading the guppy system set up like yours. I trade the eur/usd from 9:30 am to 11:30 am EST. No indicators, just the guppy system with the 5/10 ema cross over. I'll let you know how I do... Nice system by the way. snarlyjack

--- 帖子 #102 ---
hi snarly! its good to know that, that means that we are in the rigt path, i cant wate to see some of your trades! have a good one!

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Do you use M1 timeframe in the new rules, or just M5?

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Hi steve! I only use the tules on m5 but i have m1 open for better entries

--- 帖子 #105 ---
hy guys! i just wanna share some of my latest trades. try to plot on h1 or h4 S&amp;R that have been bouth things in the past and be aware of that, and i have to tell you guys that works preatty good, i used with my guppy and i very very happy with that! if you wanna lern more abouth that go to no bainer trades thread or to his www

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Cool im a genius! I always thought i was possesed by some cool demon like in a horror movie, turns out i was wrong, im actually a genius! Super cool! Ive learned a lot from this sort of trading, but everyone has to make it her/his own thing and adapt it. Cheers! Keep it coming! There is a lot of people out there telling others what CANT be done, often contrary to empirical evidence.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
I have read some of Daryl Guppy's content. Sure very interesting. Does anyone here use the "Countback Bar" entry technique? Ive got a similar version I use to enter my trades, but i dont trade guppy per say so it would be interesting to hear this from guppy traders.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Grate! Keep that coming! Cheers!

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Yupp. I have read through the rainbow thread that 4XQ had, what little that was left, its pretty much guppy trading. He seemed like a really smart guy and i learned some from him. But Linuxtroll told med he was a leecher, thats a shame, i would have wanted to talk to him and exchange ideas if perhaps all that was a misunderstanding.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
here you go! very very reliable

--- 帖子 #114 ---
A nice &amp; simple strategy, so easy to follow. Thank you. I tried the linuxtroll strat but 5 &amp; 10 sec TFs are just not my style. With yours and using Oanda I can, after entering a trade, drop down to 30 seconds to see if MAs will change direction but still mostly rely on the SL. thanks again, I had 3 very small winners this a.m. and after experiencing this strat next week I will up the trade size a little. p.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Hallo everybody I use a little different GMMA setting from you mr.Rohule,hope it is ok for me to post my trade ere. the first one I get out becouse I got chicken out because mi entry was a bit early,however the second one is awesome,maybe Ive been lucky this few weeks but my account growth is awesomeeeee!!Tank you for your Idea!! http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/s...m/thumbsup.gif

Tank u for the ebook mr.Rohule,such a valuable information,will take mi sometime to go through, anyway tis is my chart for today at euro open,the level 1.3536, I wonder when EU will break through,or may be dats a point for a major reversal?any Idea?

--- 帖子 #121 ---
now I understand wut u mean by pin candles ,tank you

--- 帖子 #122 ---
rigth now we have a strong res on h1 so i will wate for brake out and also to find suport on that res. did you enter in 1.3511? i have a good set up in 5m,

--- 帖子 #123 ---
pin bars are very easy to find, (small body long shadow) and there are very usefull, the most important thing abouth pin bars are the location!

--- 帖子 #124 ---
I froze,I didnt take it,I assume maybe it will wait untill us open to retest that level,but the market go where it want to go,I assume to much, to much thinking and assuming no good.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
ok friend, let me show yoy how my screens looks like. what i advice you to do is use m5 as your main tf, and trade only in the direction onf m15, ir you are close to place a trade look at m1 for better entry and only trade m1 if you haver perfect set up and its in the direction of the m5. i like m5 because we have more time to figure out whats going to happen and whats happening. (sorry abouth my english) have a good one!

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Understood Sir,u are right,tf 1 minute always make me a chicken, no need to be sorry my english is oso bad,english is not my mother tounge,but who cares,LoL,as long as I can understand what your doing,than I reckon ur english is better than gorge bush, U never stop giving,tank you my friend,I think I need to gogle on how to add a third monitor to my lappie

--- 帖子 #127 ---
hallo everybody, this is my last trades for this weak,I really2 need to improve my emotion control .Any kind of advice would be appreciated Have a nice weekend

--- 帖子 #128 ---
I know what your problem is, that was my biggest problem in front of the screens, read the books I left in the first page, (emotionfree trading, mental fitnes and maket wizards) all you need is know what you are doing and that comes after several hours of screentime, no chase the market, trade only perfect setups, lern abouth price action patterns (candles and charts) support and resistances and fibo levels. If you want more courage the first thing to do is act, trade and the courage comes next, that's how it works.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Hey rohule, I noticed you use the THV CaveManager. Is this what you use to manage your trades with the GMMA method?

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Yes I do, it's an excellent tool, my sl is 15 pips, tp is 50 or more, capital protection is 7 and ts is 10

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Does "capital protection" correspond to the "NoLossAfterPips" setting?

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Yes it is.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
OK, thanks. You had said before to only trade during the US/UK overlap hours, but I also saw you mention trading the Tokyo hours. Are both periods tradable with this method?

--- 帖子 #134 ---
You can trade since Tokyo to uk close, the best time to trade is the hole uk session, only trade in Tokyo if you see a nice trend and a good set up, I'm from Mexico so I have to move my sleeping time, I sleep at 11 in the morning and awake at 6 in the evening, so I can watch Tokyo and trade all the way to uk close, so uk it's the 1rst, ny 2nd and tokyo 3rd. Have a good one!

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Where can one look at the CaveManager? I'm not familiar with it. p.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Here it is.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Hey guys, great to see some other MMA traders. I use a similar approach for scalping EURUSD. I have found the tool works well as long as you do not get too greedy in gunning for large pips.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Thank you.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Version 1.41 appears to be the latest. There are several competing "trade management" EAs floating around (Steve Hopwood's is quite popular). I actually like this CaveManager EA the best now that I've had a chance to examine it closely.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Gday Rohule, Just after some more information on the G macd indicator, IE Do you still use it and if so how do you use it to trade and where to come from... Many thanks King Pippin

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Hi king Pippin! I dont used it, but is a grate tool, only buy when it's above 0 and emas croses each other, I dond used any more because I get used to price accion and the indi come useless when the price comes oversold or overbougt, the indi tells you not to trade but the price can give you more pips, so if you wanna used it only use the indi in the start of a trend. If you are new to the guppy method use the indi, but also lern more abouth price action (candle and chart patterns) s and r. Price and trend are the key! Cheers and have a good one!

--- 帖子 #142 ---
thank u for the advice my friend,no money can buy such wisdom. I hope one day I can oso be a full time trader like you do.I will work hard for it,please do continue guide me. Anyway I didnt take any trade until us open as Im still busy working on my new desktop,still could not get the third monitor working ,need to go to the com shop tomorrow to get another vga to display adapter converter.anyway,This are my trades tonight,I did use the 15 minute tf for guide.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
hi guys! i just took this trade, good for 15 pips. bougth after the fivo and all rules are met!

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Hey rohule, which indicators are you using in those pics? I see a zigzag and some kind of pivot thing with the levels marked as "fibo".

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Yeah, what happened to those nice clean charts? I got killed yesterday morning so I have moved to 1H - 15M - 5M TFs. Hopefully I can see the trends better.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
i use ziz zag to better view of chart patterns, 123 doble tops etc, and fib pibots so i can see if i have still room for my trade. i aslo had bad trades during NY but i have winers on UK, this day i had 2 winers 1 looser, and lets see whats will happen on NY.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
gugugaga wo kann ich diese indikator ,wie bei dir downloaden? Ich meine CCI.mq4

rohule u should give motivational speeches ,lol nice going with the guppies

--- 帖子 #152 ---
If im not mistaken u speaking german right?sorry my friend i only know one word in german,(achtung),but my guest is u are asking about my chart?it is not mt4,it is oanda ,java base chart.And the CCi is a custom*(duhhh,not custom,it is the default indi,sorry,oanda cant have custom made indi,sorry for my english) indicitor For wut its worth,this is my chart and me getting crazy today...trading forex is about taking ur lost,suck it up and brave it out soldier!!!gonna shoot some one in black ops now... *edit

--- 帖子 #153 ---
yes my friend! todays suck! i have lost a few pips today, hopefully tomorrow the market will perform better. cheers!

--- 帖子 #154 ---
couldnt aggree wit u more my friend,but when I look at the daily chart I think EURUSD is nearing a major resistance level at around 1.3780 and maybe there is a slight hesitance to trader and investor whether want to break or not to break this zone,so maybe that explain why the market is crazy,just a thought anyway...

--- 帖子 #155 ---
gugugaga Many thanks

--- 帖子 #156 ---
I trade differently anyway

--- 帖子 #157 ---
I just went through my indi folder for my mt4,there are a lots of it,enjoy.BTW nice chart u have there,I use the CCi to detect divergance,overbought and oversold,possible retracement and entry.I spent some time in Fx-50 thread reading them posts and it is a good way to trade wit the CCi.Currently Im still training my eye and my brain to understand how the CCi react wit Guppy.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Is this pure technical or news ?

--- 帖子 #159 ---
hi bro! yes i know, hard days for trading, if you dond want to get caught on bad trades wate for a big swing, (25 - 35 pips) or let the long term guppy well spreaded out, and a nice set up in m15, for this kind of tradades we need the more vol as we can. if you dond see a nice trend sit on your hands. i will left you some links you may like, i lern a lot from those! cheers and trade safe my friend! http://www.nobrainertrades.com/ http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=276813 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=11854 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=242404 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=274212 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=155434 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=229238 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=277730 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=163972 so i think you will have a very busy and interesting weekend! we just cant get enough wepons against the best!

i made this trade this morning, all guppy rules met, entry after pivot and nice 123 pattern, and rigth now i have made a good one on gbpusd.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
And read I shall!Thank you sir...BTW this one just took out my BE..Maybe I should settle for small pips on week like this,I was targetting 1.3770 (a fibline)It goes up and reverse at 1.3755(another fibline) and my 20 pips go down the drain,gonna take my RPG and run rampage in Blackops now...

--- 帖子 #162 ---
gugugaga Many thanks for your effort

--- 帖子 #163 ---
nice set up and nice profit.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
one BE!

--- 帖子 #165 ---
You seem to like having price action near the pivot point when you enter. Do you actually enter the trade when price crosses the pivot? Or is it just part of the overall setup?

--- 帖子 #166 ---
yes i like the pa when it taste the pivot, i only trade this in the direcction of the m15. i dond trade only when the price crosses pivot, i trade when i see 123 pattern or all guppy rules. only in two places: 1: when its a nice swing and the retrasement touch the pivot 2:when its a retrasement and the pa resumes the trend and crosses the pivot

--- 帖子 #167 ---
So right now PA has moved quite far from the pivot for EURJPY and AUDUSD but the US market hasn't opened yet. Would you still consider these tradeable like this (so far from the pivot)? Also, EJ is at S1 and AU is at R1. Do you place much significance on the S1, 2, 3 and R1, 2, 3 levels? Or is the pivot most important to you?

--- 帖子 #168 ---
i like to wate for more confirmation, the r1 of aud and s1 of ej seems to be bery strong, i would like to wate for the retrasement to enter. ir the usdchf fails on the pivot i will enter short. but we are on friday so i think im done for the week

--- 帖子 #169 ---
What time do you get up rohule? I'm thinking I need to start getting up earlier to catch the London market action. By the time 0800 EST arrives it seems like the party's over!

--- 帖子 #170 ---
i get up at 2 am (just when uk oppens), yes steve you need to catch all uk session

--- 帖子 #171 ---
one excellent trade during NY!!! fails at the pivot and now the pivot its giving resistance and all guppy rules are met!

--- 帖子 #172 ---
good start of week, all guppy rules are met just when crosses the pivot

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Nice start of the week indeed... my entry was a bit late,need to work more on my entry.. Here how it look from my 1 minute chart

--- 帖子 #174 ---
good set up, 30 pip profit all guppy rules are met and we have fib level as support

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Agreed. I dabbled in between H1 or M15, in the end i decided it didnt much matter, so i just sort of stuck with H1, That way i can see 4 days back on half a screen. But i would never trade either of them, its just to see what happend in days past, i dont know it if does that much for me, i dont look at it that much.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Hi guys... I just found this thread few days ago and I like it.. thanks for sharing it rohule.. please keep sharing your day to day trades as well.. a new newbie on your thread

Hi a2xm Welcome to the thread! And yes I will post my dayli trades! Have a good one!

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Hi! Very good trades friend, keep it up!

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Ive decided to drop the cci..but decided to put more timeframes..actually I have 4 timeframe on my desktop 1minute,5min,15 min and 30 min..without other indi..it is like looking at the chart through celarer window..will keep this setup for another week or so and compare my result..now i understand why u drop all indi..

--- 帖子 #181 ---
"Trade downtrend rallies as rallies rather than trend breaks" My English is not my best ,Im having trouble understanding this "tactic" as Guppy has lay out,I would appreciate if any1 would help,does this means dat we dont have to wait for the retracement (the V pattern) after the trend break to enter a sell position in a downtrend?

--- 帖子 #182 ---
If you wanna have mini charts of higher timeframes below the main chart go to pipwaware.com and then mini charts, you can save a lot of room. And regarding the indi, I waste to many years trying to figure out how to use it properly

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Yes, we dont have to wate for the retrasement but we if you wanna trade that just remember that we dond know in which part of the swing we are, Maby it's time for a retrasement to occur, if you wanna do that I advise you to wate for the touch of the 10 ema and it's still room for at least 20 pips for the next pivot or s&amp;r. And remember to find dandle patterns like engulfing, pin bars etc, that will help you in entering the trades more accurate.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
...and it is freeeeee,cool ..i love free stuff...thank man!

--- 帖子 #185 ---
I see...now I understand,when i look back back at my first trade last friday it does gave me 30 pips but in the end the price turn back and hit my BE,I was so greedy,every week u gave me my "aha" moment my friend,tank you again,I will concentrate more on the setup everyday instead of my pips +/-,master the setup,thats it..no more no less..

--- 帖子 #186 ---
My trade today,and a bit of my thoufht,feel free to comment ..

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Did you know that you where trading the news? I almost did too, went long at 19:10 on your chart and closed at 19:12. But your trade was super nice double digits, mine was just 4.6 pips!

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Rohule, I combined your system with Dreddings and between the two systems they make 1 very accurate system. I really like the guppy system for trend but I also really like using the zig-zag system for pin pointing exact entry. Just thought I would get your opinion on combining systems? tks snarlyjack

--- 帖子 #189 ---
absolutely, i also have combined with Dedding and it works awesome, i trade in 5 and 15 minutes and i have 90% average or winners and i making no less that 50 pips a day, so yeah! we have a very very good method. do you use HA to confirm or golden super k? i use golden super k because it shows the color of ha but i can still see the pa Cheers!

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Rohule, Thanks I appreciate your opinion! I was not able to down load your HA indicator. Are you able to configure it for mq4 so I can download it? I do agree that combining both systems, it is really pinpointing the trades. I feel very good about my trading future right now... tks for all your help! snarlyjack

--- 帖子 #191 ---
owwwhh,yeah its the "German Factory Orders m/m" I didnt notice the spread widening though,I must have been lucky today,thanks for reminding me,better watch out for the news next time

Hi gugugaga, I notice you are not using the original guppy on the long group MA (green). why is it? Thanks...

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Holla friend, it is the Allan Hull setting,I found it fits my brain and my eye,every1 have their own fav MA setting,maybe for others Guppy setting is the best,but for me I found this setting "click" me,it is just in the matter of compatibility for me,LoL,sorry I cant gave u any technical base answer..

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Heres what i do: I get up in the morning and the first thing i do is turn on the computer and look at the news in FF and mark every news in my chart with a vertical line. And then i have chart shift on in my chart so i see 20 minutes before any news. I stay out 15-20 minutes before news and about 10 minutes after. Its not that its impossible to trade news, i have done it profitably, but i am hesitant to if its really such a smart thing to do in the end.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
a very good idea my friend,thanks.I just wish oanda chart have those auto news reminder on chart.Until than manual line it is.Here is my chart today,I came in late,got one BE,my Tp is at 1.3650, however on the bounce I entered,the move already finish..next time I will focus more on the first bounce,try to minimise my trade to maximum 2 position a day.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
nice setup 20 pips,Im done for today,but i think it still can go up..LoL

--- 帖子 #203 ---
hey rohule sorry to junk up your thread with this but here is the pic as described in the pm...the first red vertical line was my initial entry...thanks and do you ever go down to the one minute to pin point entries as well because I noticed that it would have caught the beginning of those big bars perfectly if going down to M1 chart...

--- 帖子 #204 ---
sweeeeeeeeeeet!

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Very nice play on the pull backs...are those still the 5 and 10 ema...it loos so sweet how they rejected the price...

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Holla everybody, my first trade was clumsy becoz it is just 2 minutes after news,my FF calendar was wrongly configured,I thought the news has pass one hour before, but the set up in my POV is to good to let go,I jump in My original TP was at YL,the market turn and hit my BE after 20 pips . The second one I lost -9 pips, The third setup was to good for me to let go (again) seeing the price rejected by fib S1,decide to close my trade a few pips above YL...I already violated my rules 2 trades a day,,thats it for me today. Or maybe I should change it to 3 trades a day?LoL

Hello rohule, I want you to look at the picture, can you explain this situation?

--- 帖子 #225 ---
hi Alex! you need to wate for a nice trend to take place, wate for a nice 20 or 30 pips swing, if the price is testing the long guppy several times thats not good for the trade because the market dond know where to go, also take a look at 15m have a good one!

I would like to wish many pips to all traders on this wonderful forum. I'm a new member and this is my first post. This method is exactly what I've been looking for. I've been trading for well over 5 years but I have not made a single penny from this business. I guess it's safe to say that it's time I turn my results around. I've found the forum here at FF and I found the thread with this Guppy Trading. I truly believe that one must focus on just one method and stick to that method to be successful. That has been a problem for me in the past but I'm letting that go now. I will contribute to this thread as much as possible. I have already read the entire thread and the documents attached and I like what I have come across. I do have my own little touch to this method however. I'm not changing anything as this is not a suggestion for anybody else to do the same as me. I have a much easier time reading the market by using Heiken Ashi candlesticks instead of the traditional candlesticks. So for my trading, I will be using the Heiken Ashi candlesticks to aid me in my trading. I suck at trying to read the 1 minute chart so I will be using the 5 minute with confirmation from the 15 minute chart. I've attached a screenshot of my setup so you can see what my charts look like. I've also added MACD to help me gauge the market as well. I hope to end up taking my Forex dreams to reality in the future and I believe that I have found the place that will help me in accomplishing that goal.

I remember reading somewhere in this thread that rohule trades for a living. First off, congrats on that accomplishment. I hope to be there one day. I have $1k sitting aside that I will be trading live with, within the next month or so. My question is does anybody know if rohule has a live trading room, for those like me, who have the time to trade the bulk or the entire UK session? I would love to be able to speed up the learning curve by being part of a live trading room and having the possibility of making some pips at the same time. I figured I would just ask and see since I don't recall reading that in the thread. The screenshots are a great feature to have and be able to share. I just figured that there may be some seasoned traders out there who can trade during certain times and some traders who are new to this method like myself, that can trade during the active hours. I know I'm just joining this thread so I don't want to ruffle any feathers but I figured I would ask to see if there was a live trading room that already exist.

Here is a screenshot of my first trade using this method. I may not understand the rules completely so please let me know if I entered too soon or broke a rule. I want to reach my goals and Forex is a way to do that. I am committed to doing what I must to be a successful, consistently profitable Forex trader. Many pips to all!

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Well as you can see, my first trade was stopped out for -15 pips. No big deal, onto the next one!

--- 帖子 #235 ---
You scalped the first move in the morning, or close to it You scalped the first move between day and halfday averages There was little separation between the MA groups There was little esablished trendlike behaviour since MAs was not that much separated and the selling had not gone on for a long time at all There is also the 1.3567 S/R to consider, id say about that in particular a 50/50% chance it would hold, and depending on how you define it, maybe it did. That is some things you might want to consider. I went short about the time you closed, it didnt quite go my way so i had to close at 1.9 pip profit, i was aiming for more like 5. With hindsight, of course i should have kept that for a while, would have made me all the pips i need for today, but i was far from sure it would turn out like it did.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Thanks for sharing that with me. I greatly appreciate it. I want to get better so I need the view from others on what I did wrong. Everything you said made sense. It looks like we were right in thinking short. We just jumped the gun, me more than you. 1.9 pips of profit is still profit no matter what. I'm sure you already know this but if you can average 2% per day, you will do just fine in this business. I want to attach a spreadsheet that I think would be helpful to someone but it exceeds the size limitations here on FF. Does anybody know a way I can attach the spreadsheet? It allows you to see just how your money can grow. Helps me stay on track and remember that trading is about long term profits. My next trade is just one of millions that I will take in my trading career so I must not get hung up on it. Thanks again for taking a look at my chart. You are helping me learn and I appreciate that very much.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Here is a screenshot of what my current thoughts on the market are. Does this seem about right or am I off base?

--- 帖子 #238 ---
According to the first post, I am using the old method. The new method does not have the short ema's, just a 5 and 10 ema. Sorry for posting with the wrong setup. I have made the adjustment to my charts and will post the correct charts from this point forward.

Thanks for sharing this indicator. This is going to help me with my stop loss, which is something I struggled with in a major way. It will also help me with my entries as well.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Rohule.. either here or thru email, show me your dredding/guppy combo how you trade that together for all interested? So you trade Dredding M5/M15... then when it shows a short for example do you go straight to your M1 guppy for entry or.. please explain your process..I am sure there are others like me that want to improve on the basics given in that system..ie reduce draw down and pin point better entries. thank you Brian

--- 帖子 #245 ---
hi brian! sorry for the dalay! ok, its very very easy indeed 1; firts thing to do its find a good trend (no trend no trade) 2. my main tf is m5, if the price has cross the fib and make a retrace to the fib i enter when i have a candle in the direction of the trend (red if short and green if long) you have to wate for the confirmation 3, if the retrace occurs in the middle if the fibs i need to see if i have at least 15-20 pips of room to enter in that trade and i enter in the trade after candle and sl dots confirmation 4. if the retrace occurs near the fib i place a pending order when the price has cross the fib (only if you see nice trend and momentum, hh or ll) 5. if the price has make a retrace but is near the fibo (less than 10 pips) i sit on my hads and wate for another set up (you can do it on m1 if you have a good grasp on this) cheers!

--- 帖子 #246 ---
my bigest problen in forextrading was the mindset, for example: 1. lack of confidence (the method works!, do you?)if you know you you will beat the market!!! 2. lack of diciplin (follow the rulles and lern for the market every day) 3. forcing the trades (please dond force a trade, wate for the perfect set up) 4. fear (if you can overcome the above you will drop frear automatically) once you can overcome that (i hope you already have overcome that) the sky is the limit. you will have a financial freedom!!!! i hope this helps to acheive that! (also take a look at the books i post in the firt page)

--- 帖子 #252 ---
I just wanted to weigh in on this thread. I have been trading long term for years and I still do. However, I have been looking for a short term trading method to get 25-50 pips a day. I like the idea of only risking 15 pips a trade and collecting around 25-30pips within the session. I have been using Guppy MA's for the last month on a 15 min chart. I am winning about 90% of the time and I could not be happier. To me, the key to winning with this method is not limiting yourself to any given pair but trading a pair that has the best chance to move in that session. I do this by using parallel and inverse analysis. I will check all 28 pairs on a 15 min chart and determine which currency is weak and which is strong. For example, if I check all the pairs and the EUR pairs are going up and the JPY look weak, I will trade the EUR/JPY. Repeat this each session. I follow Guppy rules and I use a pullback method that is mentioned earlier in this thread(three bars give or take, then take the break of the low bars high). One also has to realize when they are trading to pull this off. My favorite time to trade is 630-1030 est or the "main session". Usually in this time, currency strength or weakness will stay the same for several hours giving someone a better chance thus increasing winning percentage. I just thought I would share this after I just stumbled across the thread. Just my 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Just to give a live example, the CAD/CHF is lining up to be good trade if it pulls back at some point this morning. All the CHF pairs are strong and the CAD pairs are weak at the moment AND the pair has about 150 pips to go to the nearest resistance point. I know the spread is high, for me 8, but when you get a pair that sets up with parallel and inverse analysis, if will move big time and usually will give up plenty of pips. It makes for a real safe trade as well.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
That green orange indicator struck me the minute I saw it in your screens longe before you mentioned it. Can you tell the full name or even better post it please ? I'm considering making an EA based on that indicator and guppy. Any hints how I might use guppy to check the market is not flat ? As long as the market is not flat you can go short when price goes below the green dots and long above the orange. But if it's flat you get slaughtered. Or perhaps check if the faster mas are below or above the slower ones and only trade with the trend ? But I'm open to any suggestions for rules. I'll be making the EA with an ea generator not code it, but it works just fine. If I come up with anything I'll post it here. Hmm- from post 93 the rules are above guppy only long, below only short after 5 and 10 ema cross with candle close above or below 10 ema. Simple enough to automate.

Rohule, would you care to share your latest template with the indys? I find the bands type indicator you are using very interesting since its similar to the braintrend and another indy i have been using quite well for over 2 years now. You have a very simple, yet profitable setup going here. Please continue to post your charts and keep things nice and simple as you do. You're catching some good trades with this. I hope you caught some of the down move on friday, I managed to get a nice chunk, cant wait till monday

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Great trade bud! Heres some pips I caught with this as confirmation with my other trading, We had failure for price to rise above the pivot, but the Dotted bands Rohule provides would have kept you out of an early entry there.... We had a small descending trendline and a breakout with confirmation from the bands, took the long on the Euro around 89 ish, took profit as I felt fit just past the S1 Fibo around 18. If i dont get any more safe setups later on, im happy to be done for the day All the best lads

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Some good charts there guys, keep them coming. Its great to see we didn't really get into losses today. You'd be a winner even if you didn't trade today seeing as we had no proper trend.... Around 9.40 was one of the safest entries when we had price bounce off the Guppy and the Dotted bands quite nicely and slowly head up to the Fibo S1 level. Only problem was there was news 20 minutes away so I didn't risk going in. You guys did well though. Lets make some more pips this week shall we?

--- 帖子 #277 ---
i hope the market perform better, i think i will due to fundamentas ahead, better to fasten the seatbelts! every day its a good day for GMMA! success to every one!!

Guys sorry I couldn't be in the room today, woke up late, and just after I got up had a trade so just focused on takin the money... No need to try and over analyze things, just go with the flow, and followed the money and took profit just past Fibo r2 level. Job done! We had a break of a small trendline to the upside and just after that we had a nice close just over the Fibo R1 level with the green dotted band signalling a long was good to go. Perfect! if you had a good pivot indicator on your charts you can see that just past the Fibo R2 level there was a weekly r1 pivot level where price has been going often so if you held in to this trade, you could have gotten more profit safely at that level.

Hi ! I managed this with TVL, so half position exited wit +15 pips and other half will depend on TVL stop. Rohule, do you still use 15 pip S/L ? And after you have price touching 10 ema and have bar closed above/below 10ema, do you enter on top/bottom bar's extreme or any price which follows after ?

--- 帖子 #291 ---
hi Pip Assassin! i use 15 pips or last h/l, and i enter in the trade in the next candle after the entry signal, also please be aware if you still have room for the next pivot points,

--- 帖子 #292 ---
I have only EUR still open, so far 4 profitable trades.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Thanks, Rohule. Awaiting your critique on my trades !!!

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Hi Pips Assasin! You did very well on those trades, congratulations bro! I notice you enter in the trades using fractals, IMHO it can be to late. The Best set ups are when ps touch long guppy and enter in the brake of the last candle, and when you see the short emas (5 and 10 or 7 and 14) well spreaded out enter in the trade after the pa resumes the trend ( after the retrasement) in the brake of las las candle Take care!

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Took this EU short marked at my vertical line after some patience. Was hitting my trendline I plotted, after that triggered my short i placed just under the Fibo R1 level, closed just under it, ready to go short. Guys sorry i wasn't in the room at the time, my skype was giving me problems and had some pc crashing. Getting this sorted out by the end of the week hopefully. Take profit set at the Daily pivot. Job done and finished for the day although there was another short opportunity later after the London close.

When the market decide to move...

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Nice trade there my friend. The last few Fridays have been very profitable to trade and today was the same, so far at least. The market has been in a pretty smooth decline since the London open, giving more than enough opportunities to net a few pips. Glad to see that you were able to bag some of the pips for yourself. It only takes between 10-20 pips per day consistently to do very well for yourself financially in this business. I believe trading the GMMA gives a very solid opportunity to do such. Great trade and keep it up!

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Yes,i agree wit U my fiend,but Im still having trouble setting up my TP,I really need to work on my emo,my last 2 blown account is haunting me,but maybe I should let go and start fresh.Easy 4 me to say now ..but when ever Im in a trade my heart is beating like Im runniig 100m sprint..silly me..

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Use the fib pivots and those will help you have levels to target...

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Yes, try not to think about the past. I said try because I understand your frustration and it is harder to do than most think. Look at it like this, you know the way you are trading right now works. You have seen the results of that. So the hard part is out of the way. Now as for your targets, use the fibs like my friend Paul said or just set a target like 10 pips or so and just use that. If you are risking 10 pips, target 10 pips. As the trade moves in your favor, trail your stop and if you hit your target, wait for the next signal. If you miss your target, wait for the next signal. Also, think about having a quitting point. I know a very successful trader and he has a quitting point. When he is up 5% of his account balance for the day, he stops trading. He says that anytime he tries to get more than 5%, it always turns into a bad day for him so he stops at that point and goes out and enjoys his life. That's what I do as well. Here is something that may help you understand that even small gains add up. I'm a realist and know that most people don't have $10k or any big amount of money to trade with. Most of us on this forum are starting with $1k or less. So let's say that you have $500 in your trading account. Did you know that if you can average 2% per day (I said average because you will have losing days and also days where you make more than 2%) that you will turn your original $500 investment into $11,651.92 if you started from May 1st all the way through the end of the year. That's just with averaging 2% per day, which sounds hard but if you risk 10 pips and risk 2% per trade, that just means you need to make 10 pips per day on average and you can achieve this. Now will it be easy, probably not but you can do it. Also, lets say you fall a bit short and only end up with $8k by the end of the year, are you going to be upset??? Who would be mad that they took $500 into $8k in 8 months...nobody that I know. And also that's starting on May 1st. If you started on April 1st, you would end up with $17,314.13. So as you see, taking it one step at a time and one trade at a time, is the way to go. Getting 10 pips per day does not sound like much but it sure does add up pretty nicely. So my suggestion is, let go of the past, focus on the present and look forward to your future!

--- 帖子 #324 ---
A heartfelt thank you to you my friend for the wisdom..(I hope I say it right), and you 2 pmulin86 I will definately try to change my mindset from now on..

--- 帖子 #325 ---
We are all here to help each other so no need to thank me at all. I want to see everybody reach their goals and live the life we all want. Another option that may help you forget about your past is lower your trading size for awhile. The reasoning for that is it will allow you to take your trades without the emotions of worrying about the money. As time goes on, you will see that you are taking proper trades, which will build your confidence up. The more and more your confidence gets built up, you can increase your lot size until it is back to normal. By then, you should have proven to yourself that you can successfully and consistently trade your trades and from that point forward, you should be good to go. Keep up the great work and I will be looking forward to hearing you share your stories of success as you climb higher and higher on Mt. Forex!

Hi Roberto ! Nice to see you back ! Great trades, as always ! Looking forward for more :-)

--- 帖子 #337 ---
I sort of trade like this, but thing is, you need to study S/R as well i think, and place some of your own. The other obstacle trading like this is exaustion, its tricky to decide it. Way i see it there cant be any fixed rules for how to trade, it has to be a decision based on whats happening. So if price gets through those and those MAs, its all fine but it gotta be the right thing for price to do, the natural way of it.

Hi there, I was thinking of Automating this process and was just wondering do you think this could be possible? I think it may be ok but if the Fib and resistance levels are very necessary I think it would be a lot harder. Thanks David

--- 帖子 #339 ---
hi david, i have try that a few times but its very hard cos wen choppy market comes you will have a lot of looses. my advise is to trade by yourself david. and yes that fib indi its completelly necessary. have a good one

That's interesting you have tried it already rohule. I have written some Java to calculate the EMA's and I am checking when the long and short ema's cross the ema 55 upwards and downwards. To avoid trading when there are false momentary crosses of the 55 ema I have added some checks to make sure the long emas then move x pips above the ema 55 and that there is also a certain pip gap between the long and short emas and also between the 3 ema and 5 ema to show potentially expansion. All this with the usual sl and sp points too. I will let you know how I get on with this but i did notice today with GBP/USD at 9 UK time there was a big drop (5 min chart) but the drop was from a position where the long emas were already below the 55 ema so there was no cross signal for my code! Must figure out how to pick this movement out too or instead just not be greedy and to just wait for the cross signals :-) Thanks

Hi,,rohule, Big fan of your book and DVD. I have a question. Is there a way to use the GMMA to very quickly scan the currency pairs and identify the pairs that is suitable of using GMMAs?

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Guys is anybody trading this setup? Hoping that my Charts can remain fast with this method on Im going to take some clean m5 setups alongside my normal H1 method I trade... I had to quit trading this method unfortunately before because of it hogging my resources and crashing my motherboard (problem Ive resolved now) since the guppy's quite intensive. Anybody made positive pips with this lately? Any updates here would be nice, hope your keeping well Roberto

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Ive got 2 Indicators that might help folks who are interested in Trading with Roberto's method and make spotting entries easier... the first one, the FanSimple indicator Im using in my chart posted below as seen by the Yellow Dot and Blue Arrow at the top right hand side of my screen...Basically it checks all the Moving Averages that make up our Blue Guppy to make sure that they are ALL in the correct Orientation... so that we can enter make decision to enter a trade or not If we have our blue arrow under the Yellow Dot. If the Guppy MA's are not aligned, it wont display the arrow underneath, when the MA's are aligned short in the correct order it will display a red Arrow instead. For the settings, you can set all TimeFrames to 0, just ensure you set the First TimeFrame setting to 5 so that will read the Guppy MA's from just your m5 chart, to keep things simple. The moving average settings are 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 and 60 ... These need to be set in the DisplayMA1-6 fields, leave the DisplayMA 7 and 8 to 0 because ouf Blue Guppy MA only has the above 6 moving averages so thats all we need... Ensure all the fields for the TypeOfMA are set to 1, that's for EMA's which is what we want, and change all PriceOfMA to 0 to use EMA's that are Closed. All other settings can be kept as they are. This indicator is simple but it helps u to not strain your eyes as when the Guppy compresses or changes over, its often hard to see if they are in the correct order or not. When the Orientation is correct, this increases the chances of a profitable trade. The 2nd indicator ive just found as a Viable trade filter, Its a T3 RSI set to 150 in the settings, when its above the Red line, Longs only, When its Crossed below, Shorts only... It appears to take out some of the fake outs quite nicely and May compliment the Method. Ive attached a chart below to show 2 possible entries for short trades on Friday with this indy... If you see the two Yellow Vertical lines that ive marked my entry, The Guppy appears to be in Good orientation ready to fall with Price, And The T3 RSI crosses to the downside just when price is ready to start falling, notice before both the marked entries how price tries to fall but ends up going the opposite direction for a while. These were nicely avoided by the Help of the T3 RSI to enable us to take profit around the Fibo S1 level since we're under the daily Fibo Pivot. I hope maybe this info is of some help for trades using this method. I'll try posting some more charts later in the week.

Posting an Example of a Trade on the EurUsd from the 12th July this week of a Short and Long trade since we're Under the Daily Fibo Pivot, its safe to go short then trying to trade countertrend...But I explain the safest way to Countertrend for those looking to Long later in the day according to my chart. (the 3 blue lines on the chart are the s1, s2 and s3 fibo pivot levels) Ive marked 4 possible Trade entries on the Chart ive posted with 4 vertical lines, 3 of these possible entries are on the Right hand side are Countertrend to go Long, and the first Vertical line is with the Trend to go Short... The 1st Vertical line ive colored Purple Coincides after a TrendLine Break and would have been taken just after the candle closed below the blue S2 level, again, Being under the Daily Fibo Pivot and having the CORRECTLY stacked/Orientated Guppy MA's increases our chances of profitability and prevents use from getting stopped out easily as was the case for people who tried going long later in the day without looking for a properly stacked Guppy. You can see from the first 2 Red colored Vertical lines price although it closed over the Fibo s2 level, it didn't go long, Like i mentioned in my last post If we wait till we have the CORRECT Guppy orientation and Our MA's of 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 and 60 ma's are in the correct order, we see that they started to become stacked properly to go long in the 3rd Vertical line colored Yellow that ive marked, that entry would have been the Safest to wait for IF you want to risk countertrend since we are below the Daily Fibo Pivot and have a short Bias, but countertrending with the Correct Guppy would have been the most profitable out of the 3 possible long entries. Again for those who aren't sure how to spot the Guppy in the Correct order/orientation, check my previous post and Ive posted an indicator that shows a Blue or Red arrow in the top right hand corner of the chart so you can quickly and easy see when the Guppy is arranged correctly to give you the safest entry's. Now that my Motherboard and PC doesn't crash I can hopefully take these entries with this Guppy as Ive marked in my screenshots. I hope this post was helpful. If anybody has any further insights, please do share.

Seems good, thanks for sharing.

thank you so much Vishal i will test is this week! have a good one!

Attached the chart of a trade I was following today...By around the London open, I Knew price needed a proper retracement upto even the S1 level from the S3 level so I didn't fall for any fake short entries, and even though my long trade today was countertrend, I ensured that the Guppy was properly aligned with the right orientation... Entry was around 65 ish on the Euro to go long marked with the vertical line and took profit around 93 ish just under the S1 line. After I got in the trade even though it was safe, trade went against me for a moment, I survived by just 2 pips, phew lol. Anyway done for the day, will look out for more setups and post later in the week If i get time.

After 2 years of using GMMA, I already familiar with its patterns. Thus, I removed some unimportant Moving Averages from GMMA. The remain Moving Average are 3, 15, 30 and 60.

clc4x, Tell us more about your trading. For example is the macd a no-lag macd or a regular macd 12-26-9. Tell us about your edge. Tks snarlyjack

--- 帖子 #350 ---
it is just a normal macd. I do not use it as entry/exit criteria, but to use it to identify bullish/bearish divergence for 2 purposes in brief: 1. trend trading - i will avoid to enter if regular bullish/bearish divergence happen. 2. reversal trend trading - bullish/bearish divergence give me entry signal If you want to know more, you can visit my blog to download my trading plan.

Ehoooooooooo ?

GREAT!

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Heh just want to say how much I appreciate all the work you guys put into this, as it has quickly become my favorite template for all the reasons already stated in here. I love it for Binary Options, by far the most profitable I have ever been. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
This is a great thread.... lots to be learnt here... well done Rohule.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
We should revive this thread.. this is one of the best scalping system out there

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Hi all. I will continue this tread using guppy system. I think it is in line with Chinese philosophy of Tai Chi, but the accurate entry is a little hard， good feelings and imagination is needed. I will trade DAX30. Yesterday is not good for me. Made a mistake of chasing price, have one BE trade to -3% loss. Another two are correct and two BE trades. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Another 3 trades just taken. 2 losses -6%, one win 10%. For me I think I can avoid 1st one by reading the market next time, will see. Today 2% total profit by far. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #358 ---
This one will not be taken Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Another short was made. 1%backup, maybe exit a bit early, but ok with that, dinner time Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Another BE, should hold longer, as timid as a rabbit Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #253 ---
What I have done here is very unprofessional, went out and use my phone to close a trade without chart, lost half profit. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Choppy at the start of trend, could not catch this nice move. stop at BE Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #255 ---
A night trade, after entry I find that I misread the market. This is even not a trap, it is in nature supply zone, get out with a 1.8% loss to save my ass. Satisfy with the early out. Few minutes later the market proved my judgement and I make a quick opposite trade to cover the loss. This is a couple of interesting trade, again, I am unhappy of the early out of second trade.

Attached Image (click to enlarge) Most difficult part of trading this system comes, sell on the floor. If this is a long trade maybe I can avoid, but not this one. I did feel uncomfortable about the sell price, but it did not prevent me from opening the trade. I think I may take trades like this one in future. I should accept it, loss always occur, I can not solve it.

No interest in this thread anymore?

--- 帖子 #259 ---
is anybody interested in restarting this thread? i am working on a dash to use with the guppy method.....

--- 帖子 #260 ---
i'm working on a guppy single chart ea before i set up all 28 pairs in 1 dash. here is a screen shot of gbpusd. all arrows are red meaning that current price is below the 200 ma on all tf's from 5 min to month. in fact, this is how gbpaud, cad, jpy and chf are right now. the gbp is really tanking against most of the pairs (not all). i will be waiting on good entries when the market opens and believe this will be another good week! the second pic shows the monthly for gbpusd. it looks like about 900 pips to my target over the next couple weeks! i hope we all have a great week!! again, if anybody i interested, the guppy method has improved my trading more than i can say!!!

How do I learn the guppy method?

--- 帖子 #262 ---
hi mr maxwell, the guppy method was created by daryl guppy. there is alot of info on the internet. he uses 6 slow EMA's in blue, and 6 ema's in red. i was always getting in at the end of a run, right before a direction change. this method has helped me get rid of that problem! http://www.guppytraders.com/gup329.shtml here is a link to get you started

--- 帖子 #263 ---
GBPUSD buy

--- 帖子 #264 ---
hi tantra, great entry on your pic! I still believe the overall direction is DOWN. I got in too early as you can see in my pic. I should've waited for a close below that trend line in the blue circle area. BUT, I am confident with my sell because you can see Investor MA's are nicely spread out, and sloping down as shown in the red circle. but great job on the 5 min!! also, RSI is below the "50" midline....
