--- 帖子 #2 ---
Thanks for sharing it,I will test on my demo account!

--- 帖子 #3 ---
hi please explain the way you trade this system looks interesting thanks

--- 帖子 #4 ---
HI, So here we go , All moving avareges are smooth, Go short: 1. MA 9 below the MA 21 and both of them has to be below MA 50 2. MACD down 3. After Stochastic cross Arrow ( down ) the brown Absolute.... indicator has to cross up . Go Long: 1. MA 9 above the MA 21 and both of them has to be above MA 50 2. MACD up 3. After Stochastic cross Arrow ( up ) the blue Absolute.... indicator has to cross up . 10 pip TP and the Stop 5 pips below the entry candle. im working on 1 min chart and eurusd only, u can chek other time frames and other currency pairs also. Good Luck.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
When you say the ABSOLUTE must cross up, does that mean it has to cross the other line or something or are you just looking for it to point up?

--- 帖子 #6 ---
i mean the fat line cross the slim one. look at the photo

--- 帖子 #7 ---
What's your StochCross settings? My number of arrows is more then yours. Thanks

--- 帖子 #8 ---
false false 5 3 3 0 0 80 20 false true false pricefiled:low/high = 0, close/clo... SMA0 EMA1 SMMA2 LWMA3

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Excuse me, don't understand: where do you enter theese parametres? Which fields, I mean. For example, 80 and 20

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Interesting system, can anybody add automatic arrows signals??

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Add StochCross indicator manually and change parametres - that's it

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Hi add indicator manually and follow the photo

--- 帖子 #13 ---
O, then can you upload right that version of indicator, because the previous you did looks like this: http://i.io.ua/img_aa/large/0613/08/06130831.jpg Also you can see the difference in the names of the indicators. Thank you!

--- 帖子 #14 ---
The Stoch Crossing indicator you show in your post, is not the same one you uploaded. The input tab is totally different. Can you check it again? Thanks

--- 帖子 #15 ---
ok , so try this one that exactly i upload from my MT4 directory

--- 帖子 #16 ---
To avoid confusion Dashlat you may want to go back to the first posting of the indicator and change it. This one matches your charts! Very interesting scalping strategy you've posted here. Thank you for sharing!

--- 帖子 #17 ---
OK done! your most welcome. im proud if u guyz make money with that. Good Luck

--- 帖子 #18 ---

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Thanks for sharing, I will forward test on demo

Questions in red

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Here is a coded EA. This EA is based on the assumption that the bull/bear cross has to happen after the stoch signal. Personally, I think I'm missing something because the trades I'm seeing are all getting stopped out prematurely, and I'm getting a 30% hit rate.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
THANKS FOR GOOD QUESTION! ITS BETTER IF THE BOTH OF CROSS ARE TOGETHER . BUT U CAN ENTER IF ABSOLUT... CROSS IS NOT SO FAR AFTER THE STOCH... CROSS AS U CAN SEE IN PHOTO.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
LOOK AT THE PHOTO

--- 帖子 #24 ---
hi dashlat u must be having many valid entries each day . how about your win /loss ratio regards

--- 帖子 #25 ---
So...any particular limit? (1 bar, 2 bars, 3 bars, floor?) I updated the EA so you can now set the maximum distance between stoch cross and bull/bear cross.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
HI Ronald Raygun. THANKS ALOT FOR EA. I HAVE TRY ON VISUAL MOAD STRATEGY TESTER BUT ITS NOT TAKING ANY POSITION , MY METATRADER IS ALPARY IF IM GOING TO CHANGE ANY SETTING??, PLEASE CHECK THAT KINDLY. THANKS.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Did you change the lot size? Default lot size is 0. It's a personal measure I put in to prevent people from blindly attaching my EAs to their live accounts and blaming me for the losses they incur.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Hi Ronald Raygun, I'm so glad to see that a profossional programer like you has payin attention to this system, please be with us so we can use your good advices . in fact this is the first time im my life that im going to test an EA , i have chanched the lot size but not yet working , i dont know where is my mistake! thanks

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Change control points to each tick. And check your journal. See if there are any errors. And to fix the smiley face, press F7 and change the common tab settings to allow live trading with no manual confirmation.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
hi. this one i can see in jurnal: 2008.10.05 11:41:45 Dashlatsystem inputs: MagicNumber=0; Lots=1; Risk=0; Slippage=5; StopLoss=100; TakeProfit=60; TrailingStop=30; MoveStopWhenPrice=50; MoveStopTo=1; im sorry for giving u headache man!

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Try this: http://www.easyexpertforex.com/backt...imization.html

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Ronald Raygun, if you could take his Sto warning and give a warning of sell if MA 9 is below the 50 or a buy if MA 9 is above 50. This would cut down on the false signals. You wouldnt get buy dings when you only want sell dings. Thanks. OR I have a MA cross warning indicator, can you change the code so it only gives sound warning for sell if MA 9 is below 50 ma and sound warning for buy if MA 9 is above 50 MA. This would be very helpful, I wouldnt have to listen to it ding so much. I also attached a pic and template showing the MA cross signals. Also attached is the MA warning template.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
hi Ronald Raygun, i will try to test it on live demo. cuz i become confuse of visual , thanx alot for EA. tommorow market is open. so guyz if you have any idea to make the system more profitable plz let everybody know. so till 2morow. Good LuCk.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Dashlat!!!! Is great this indicator!!! please you can teach an example of trade, entrances and exits? in other TF is also very good, but to my taste 1M, I add this flag to my system and now almost 100% reliable. Thank you and more examples, please!

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Go back to Post #4 and look at his examples! What more can he teach you about this? How many other examples do you need to understand it? He can't make it any clearer. You'll never be a successful trader IMO if you constantly need to be spoon fed! Do your own research now! Who knows. Doing it ourself you just may discover a better way to trade it!

--- 帖子 #36 ---
thanks! for all.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Not sure how to load your stochastic indicators to my chart. anyone please assist.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Ey Flamenco RELAJATE!!!! For that alone, and I posted 2 times does not mean anything and does not know my background. I just thought I like this indicator and not the full system! Your seeks to learn, is what we are doing all! Thanks anyway!

--- 帖子 #39 ---
I took 30 pips this evening using this indicator. Not bad.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
What indicator?

--- 帖子 #41 ---
same goes to here...when i double click nothing was seen on the MT4 platform.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
RR, the EA is not detect any buy/sell...can u pls tell me why. thanks

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Not an indicator, the Dashlat Scalp System, trading manually. I am watching it for signals again this morning.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
dashlat , how long you have been using this system ?

--- 帖子 #45 ---
We do not have to take into account the SMA 200? Or based on the 9 and 21 already have assurances? Sometimes because of the 200 lost some good innings. We will go provided

--- 帖子 #46 ---
What's your lot size?

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Pretty cool system. Quite similar to the one I use. Pulled 40 pips out already today playing around with it...make that 60 now. The only thing that sucks is Oanda probably won't let me trade it off the one minute charts.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Why is that?

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Hi RR, i set 0.2 as my lot size. i waited for few hours but no entry point.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Hi, do u trade manually or with EA???

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Any errors in the journal? Why don't you post charts of missed trades.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
I've heard they don't like you scalping and will put you on manual execution if you are profitable doing it. Typical bucketshop stuff. Nice trending market today. I've pulled out 80 pips so far with no losses.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Hello! Almost 100pips in this post! I am not a supporter of the EA, I like to be me who decides! I combine these indicators and the 265pips Today! Thanks for the input!

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Hi, so dotay is the first day that u traders are checked the system. i just came now to my computer back. i can see some good signal and some bad also that we had today, i will put all the signal after a few minut to consider and to be more clear. actually mondays are not a good day for me to trade, i dnt know why, mybe becuese of the Gaps that is happening on opening time of market that the market mostly will try to fill that up, and the price is confuse to find its trend. any way is not bad to check the other time frame direction and trend lines on biger time frame, so we have better look about how to decide. i just keep on to trade by this system almost 1 month seriosly, but what the problem i have is that i dont have enough time to be on market , thats the reson i didnt check other currency pair, let me say special thanks to Ronald Raygun for the time that he's spending to this system about the EA. so guys please check the system for the more making profit and less lossing please try all the idea that u think about even change the filtering indicator!!! try and test by your own. i ahve tested so many indicators but what i finde is Absolut... for the best filtering the wrong signals and keeping on the good ones! before that i just getting in after stoch... cross on the same direction , but i thing Absolut.... can help to get better signals. Thanks traders that keeping the system on by your posts.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Hello Ronald RayGun, I too am having trouble getting the EA to work on my platform. I have done everything according to the comments on this thread, but nothing seems to work. My broker is IBFX and I am trying to run the EA on Demo. One thing I do have is "Dashlatsystem x" in the upper right hand corner of the screen instead of the "smiley face" even though the common tab live box is checked. I believe the other settings are correct. I sure would like to get this working so I can test it. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Took a look at the logic code for this EA. Couple of observations: 1.) The variables Stoch &amp; Stoch1 appear to be making the same calculation (i.e., they will always be equal) and the condition for determing "Long" or "Short" position would never be met and 2.) It is not enough to say MACD &gt; 0 or MACD &lt; 0 in determining "Long" or "Short" positions because, for example, when MACD is above zero and coming down towards zero, price is declining (i.e., all EA conditions would be met for a Long trade but this situation would most probably result in a stop loss). Same is true when MACD is less than zero. Put another way, price direction does not change at zero for the MACD. These factors may very well be why the EA is not preforming as expected. Food for thought, see what you think because I'm pretty much a newbie at this stuff.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi, do u trade in M1???????/

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Couple points: If you have an "X" Look at the top of the metatrader window. There is a button labeled "Expert Advisors" is it red or green? Now, please refer to the post describing the system: 1) The MAs need to be in their proper order. That's correct. 2) MACD is determined by position, not direction. The MACD is the distance between two EMAs, when the MACD is 0, those EMAs should be crossing each other. 3) The stoch settings look like this in what I'm trading with: Inserted Code double Stoch = iStochastic(NULL, 0, 5, 3, 3, 0, 0, MODE_MAIN, Current + 0); double Stoch1 = iStochastic(NULL, 0, 5, 3, 3, 0, 0, MODE_MAIN, Current + 1); What makes them the same?

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Hello. I test the system and have today with E/U 30 pips. Very good and thanks Dash for your system. tordi

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Hi Ronald RayGun, Ok, found the Expert Advisors button. It was red. Learn something new everyday with this stuff. double Stoch = iStochastic(NULL, 0, 5, 3, 3, 0, 0, MODE_MAIN, Current + 0); double Stoch1 = iStochastic(NULL, 0, 5, 3, 3, 0, 0, MODE_MAIN, Current + 0); The iStochastic expressions are the same. Isn't this going to produce the same value for both variables? Doesn't the signal line come into play here in determing the cross? I see what you are saying on the MACD. You mentioned you changed the EA to allow for setting the distance in bars between the Stoch Arrow and the Absolute Strength Cross. Is this a manual setting? Cuz, I don't see it. Thanks for your help and patience.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Look for MaxBars/

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Thank You Ronald RayGun for your help. Great Work on the EA! It helps to be using the lastest version. I am currently running the EA in Demo on the 1 min chart @ .5 lots. It has placed one successful trade this morning of 10 pips with one trailing stop of 10 pips. I will continue to test in Demo and report on the results. Has anyone determined a best timeframe to run the EA on? Is there a "best" setting for MaxBars?

--- 帖子 #62 ---
MaxBars is only the maximum amount of bars you are willing to wait before you consider a stoch signal "stale". I'm running it at 20 right now. Nailed a few 10 pip trades. I move to breakeven + 1 at 6 pips profit and trail that until I hit TP.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Hi RR, i was placed the EA on my interbankfx/experts and later place on the chart. i also turn to Green color - Expert Advisor and and set 0.2lot. should i change any other settings besides this?

--- 帖子 #64 ---
As of around 12:30 EST i installed RR's EA and dashlets indicators. Changed lots to 0.1 and maxbars to 20. I'll run it for a while and hopefully it'll trigger something. There seems to be a lot of superfluous inputs in the EA (set to false), I think all the added inputs are confusing with SL and TP settings of 100 and 60. There's usestopless = true and also overidestopless = true. Are the generic targets hard coded in for TP 10 and SL 5 from dashlets original post. After changing lots to 0.1 is this fire and forget? Be good if you could just give a quick numpty guide as to what inputs are required for basic operation ronald raygun. If we are meant to ignore them no worries. Sorry to be a pain

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Hi RR, it seems most of us having some problem on the EA espeacialy on how to to make it work. could you pls share with us step by step how to set it. when someone post that they are earn number of pips using this EA, i'm very eager to give a try. i hope u can help us. thanks/

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Here's an explanation of the inputs: MagicNumber: If you intend to run more than one ea simultaneously, make sure that each EA has a different magic number so they don't interfere with each other. SignalsOnly: If set to true, the EA will only tell you when it would have placed a trade, but not actually place the trade for you Alerts: This enables the pop-up window alert function SignalMail: This enables the e-mail function (needs to be set up in MT4) PlaySounds: This enables the sounds function EachTickMode: If set to true, the EA takes a trade as soon as it sees the signal, if set to false, the EA only takes trades at the end of a bar. Lots: Obvious Moneymanagement: If set to true, the lots variable will be replaced by an EA-generated version Risk: amount to risk per trade (applies only if MoneyManagement is set to true) Slippage: amount in pips allowed to deviate from the trade entry price. (Useful when the market is moving very fast) UseStopLoss: This determines if you use a stoploss at all OverRideStopLoss: If you want a fixed stoploss instead of the system-generated stoploss, set this to true. This is the stoploss value used if override stoploss is enabled UseTakeProfit: Set this to true if you want a take profit greater than 0; TakeProfit: This is the value of the takeprofit UseTrailingstop: Set this to true if you want the trailing stop enabled Trailingstop: The amount of pips in profit to trail by. MoveStopOnce: This is the breakeven function MoveStopWhenPrice: Breakeven trigger MoveStopTo: whatever price in pips relative to breakeven. MaxBars: The maximum amount of bars between the current bar, and last bar with the stoch signal. Questions?

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Hi RR, thank you for your explanation. will try first; if there is any Q will let u later..

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Hi RR, the EA still not detect any entry point / trade. i don't know how to xplain to you. could you pls teach me how to attach the template / thumbnail so that u can see my chart

Hi I need help on this indicator 1*3 warning system, i guess it making my system/laptop to hang making difficult to trade. Thanks. Nerry.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Hi dashlat, Thanks for sharing and God bless.Finally i got one and i will like to say that this is more that a scalping method.It is a real system that can fetch 50 - 100 pips. What else can i say......... Thanks. Nerry.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Hi RR, I guess this post is for u. Can u pls check it out cos am having problem with the indicator,i guess it making my system to hang and if not i will check my system.RR u have been doing wonderful work, God bless. Thanks. Nerry.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Hi NerryE, could you pls explain a bit further how do u set-up the EA.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Hi mohan, I trade manually, so am yet to use the EA. Thanks. Nerry.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
then it is fine. am also trade manually and able to catch few pips. Now the only problem i'm facing is EA; i set up everything accordingly but never trade anything on EA. c:interbankfx/expert/EA

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Hi RR, am at work now. will try according to this again tomorrow. Thank you for patiently answer all my question. i suspect that i was enable "Allow DLL imports".

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Hello All, Since 7:00 pm CST last night the EA entered 16 trades, 10 losers &amp; 6 winners for a net LOSS of $245 (in demo). Perhaps additional filters are needed to eliminate false signals. My settings where a straight 10 TP, 10 SL @ .5 lots. The EA did not set the correct TP on two of the winning trades. (Using a larger SL only produces greater losses.) If anyone has different settings that work, please share so I can test. In reviewing this time period I noticed a lot of "moves" the EA did not catch using the current strategy. This appears to be due, primarily, to the moving averages not being in the proper order when the Stoch signal appears. In its present form, I personally, would NOT use this in "Live" trading! I do love this idea of automated trading if we can find a net win strategy.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
I have a system that is almost 100% right. You get about 10pips a trade and you can get at least 10 trades a day. I see that you have written other idea's into an EA. The system is already put into an alert file that is on my MT4 platform that let's me know when there is a possible trade, from there, there is just a few rules to enter or not to enter. Please let me know if you can help. Thanks, Sam

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Almost 100%? Do you mind sharing?

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Would you plz share Sam?! we are here in FF to Help each other !

--- 帖子 #81 ---
This is certainly the place to get help! But we can't help you until we know exactly what it is you need help with!

--- 帖子 #82 ---
I added a 200 smoothed moving average to the system to help filter trades. I wait until all moving averages are on one side or the other of the 200 before looking for an entry. I use the orginal rules with the exception of the t/p &amp; s/l. I am currently testing 20 pips for both settings. I also look for an angle of the 200 as well. Just a few things you might try. Good luck everyone.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Hello, Here is another EA that seems to follow strictly the rules of this system : Dashlat Scalp System EA The results generated are bad. Maybe a time filter is needed.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Wow - you're using a 200 SMA to filter out trades on a one minute scalping system? Man - that's kind of like having a small pizza delivered by an 18 wheeler. Could you explain a little more just HOW that works?

FYI.............. http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon1.gif Male sex hormone may affect stock trades By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, AP Science Writer WASHINGTON - The hormone that drives male aggression and sexual interest also seems able to boost short term success at finance. But what seems to start out well can turn bad, with elevated testosterone levels over several days possibly leading to irrational risk-taking, according to researchers at the University of Cambridge in England. ADVERTISEMENT "If people want to get practical, it would be good for both banks and the financial system as a whole if we had more women and older men in the markets," said John M. Coates, lead author of a study appearing in this week's issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Such a change would produce a much more stable financial system, said Coates, a research fellow in the university's department of physiology, development and neuroscience. Coates and Joe Herbert studied male financial traders in London, taking saliva samples in the morning and evening. They found that levels of two hormones, testosterone and cortisol, affected traders. Those with higher levels of testosterone in the morning were more likely to make an unusually big profit that day, the researchers found. Testosterone, best known as the male sex hormone, affects aggression, confidence and risk-taking. Cortisol is tied to uncertainty, novelty and unpredictability, "which pretty much describes a trader's life," Coates said in a telephone interview. Coates and Herbert's study comes less than two weeks after U.S. researchers reported that young men shown erotic pictures were more likely to make a larger financial gamble than if they were shown a picture of something scary, such as a snake, or something neutral, such as a stapler. Money and women trigger the same brain area in men, those researchers said. One member of that team, Camelia Kuhnen, an assistant professor at the Kellogg School of Finance at Northwestern University, said Coates and Herbert's findings "are very interesting and they help support the claim that emotion influences financial decisions." But she cautioned that the findings don't prove a causal link between testosterone and profitability. Kuhnen, who was not part of Coates and Herbert's team, termed the idea that long-term high testosterone levels can lead to irrational risk-taking "an interesting hypothesis." Coates said he worked as a Wall Street trader during the dot.com bubble in the 1990s when millions of dollars were invested in new Internet companies, many of which later collapsed. He said trader behavior he observed didn't make sense in terms of economic or game theory, "everyone seemed to be on a drug." Even in airport bars the crowd would be ignoring baseball to watch and cheer financial reports on television, Coates said. That prompted him to begin a study of the behavior, which didn't seem to affect women. In hormone research there is the "winner model," based on both human and animal activity, in which competitors have rising testosterone levels. When one wins, his hormone levels increase even more, while they fall in the loser. That can give the winner an advantage in aggression and risk-taking in the next competition, a positive feedback, he explained. But after a while the effect overreaches and the male begins making stupid decisions. "I wondered if that was what was going on in the financial markets," he said. The London study indicated that hormone levels in the traders were both responding to financial events and influencing them. Their conclusion: "Cortisol is likely, therefore, to rise in a market crash and, by increasing risk aversion, to exaggerate the market's downward movement. Testosterone, on the other hand, is likely to rise in a bubble and, by increasing risk taking, to exaggerate the market's upward movement." And that, Coates and Herbert wrote, "may help explain why people caught in bubbles and crashes often find it difficult to make rational choices." http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080415/...lYXUiUYoGs0NUE __________________ "If you can pose an intelligent question, the likelihood of finding its solution is very close." -Joel Rensink- "What Do I Believe That Is Actually False?" -Ken Fisher

Is there time of day that you only trade this system and with the EA what chart are you trading it on. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Hi, try this one out: When an uparrow appears in an downtrend then place a sellstop at the low of the candle with the arrow. When a downarrow appears in an uptrend then place a buystop at the high of the candle. i use the guppy to determine the trend on the 5 min. Seems to give good signals.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Hi.I was reading this thread and wondering what a wonderful system is building up here; then all of a sudden it seems to come to a halt. Did something go wrong?Dash, i noticed you were asking Ron to reprogramme the ea to ignore the absolute: are you changing something? 'cos just following the arrows and macd from visual backtests show a lot of false signals; have you done something else to filter these?I wish someone would come on board again!

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Hi. just i have asked RR to test something but i didng result yet. just continue with original rules,

--- 帖子 #101 ---
tahnx, its a good idea . please consider , im waiting for results,

thank you for testing EA, i will try that setting in demo and from tonight. thanx

--- 帖子 #110 ---
can someone make an ea that will tell me when the conditions are met. to go long or short. I prefer to trade this myself. thanks

--- 帖子 #116 ---

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Hi ipannapi. im working on system hard, trying indicators to mach them with stochastic to making my own method more sequre, the system will update soon. thanks for paying attention to method.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
let me upload the new edition of dashlat scalp system.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
I was wondering what happened Dashlat.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
2 position: 45 pip in 15 min so fast and easy!!! right now so fresh!! lol dnt forget every system has wrong signal.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Hi RR how are you man? i just remove the macd and absolut... . as you can see the stochastic signal has placed by normal stochastic so what we have new? : the new RSI. the moving avrages: EXPONENTIA L 8 , 20 , 50 what do you think about it RR is it got better? i still tring to make more sequre . ( i getting good result on EUR JPY 5 and 1 min chart. )

--- 帖子 #122 ---
How To Get In? I Explane For Long: Ema 8 Has To Be Above The Ema 20 And Both Of Them Have To Be Above The Ema 50. Color Of rsi Have To Be Withe Not maroon. At The Same Time Stochastoc Have To cross Up ( Much Better If Stochastic Be Under The 50 Level) When Crossing Done Click To Buy! Good Luck.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
very good system dashlat did u use stop lose or trai u stop and how thanx regard

--- 帖子 #124 ---
hi spidertwon i use stop from 10 ta 30 pip i check the condition first. tp 20 to 50 also. good luck

--- 帖子 #125 ---
as u can see here spidertwon

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Hi Dashlat, Could you explain in detail your new system? Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Hello Dashlat, Great improvement!!. !Have you considered using DMI. I have other versions and improvements on using DMI with this system. I find it very profitable. I will post the other better versions and Ask RR to code it so that we can test it.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
it keeps going. We can exit when Pink touches green or touches blue

--- 帖子 #129 ---
thanx ronald for that ea this is result for today but it have two problems take +3 pip and close and didnt use trail stop i gave so can u help regards

--- 帖子 #130 ---
and becouse of didnt use t/s

--- 帖子 #131 ---
hi Maxwell_eqtn i dnt know about DMI much, if its can mke it more safe its so good to use that im happy that system is work for you, ____________ the trading Art is so so dificult cuz the real profesional trader never get in and out without Stop Loss , its so hard to accept this cuz when our stop loss has hited we think that the system is not profitable and we going to change the strategy, in fact the only problem is our feeling that have to be control and the trader like a robot has to do the system if we can to do like a robot at the end of the month we can see that system is grate. mostly the stop loss is going to eat our profit but in fact the only way that we can stay in market for a long time and life time is Stop Loss. dear friend speedertown as u can see the system has work too good and also its work too bad, by the way the system has changet alot and we are going to trade with new rulls. and the Expert that our Friend RR has modifided is for the old one. ok guys, here is 2 nice entry on 5 min chart. please check the 15 min chart for getting the better position, please use the 8,3,3 stochastic Good luck.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Hello Dashlat! Thank You very much for this great system, I am testing GBP/USD 5 min and this is incredible!!! I have two question: Your RSI indicator repaints the dots (red, green, black)? In the Stochastic indicators properties there is a signal line which is an exponential moving average, but I dont know the number (e.g. Ema 8)? Thanks

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Hi Shenka, we do not care sbout that dots just the color of rsi is important. please use the this templet the stochastic will done 8,3,3. thnx.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Hello dashlat, I read through your thread. Very Interesting system. You had explained how you would go "long" on post #122. How do we go "short" using your system? 1). Do we do the reverse for the 8, 20, and 50 line setup. 2). Do we look for a Maroon color on the RSI (instead of a white). 3). Do we look for the STOCH to cross down (instead of up), and would it be better if the STOCH is above 50 (instead of below 50). Sorry for the questions? just trying to understand a little clearer. Thank you so much for your time and effort on this thread.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Can any one give any input... What candle would you take short in the picture example i submitted. a). it seems that when bar 1 closed, it set up the "white, black, red" formation. b). bar 2 now seemed to open after the white (8 EMA) cleared the black 20 EMA. the entry would have been 1.3232. c). bar 3 is about 50 pips away at 1.3175 (from 1.3232) from the previous possible entry of bar 2. which bar would you pick Dashlat, anyone? would bar 3 be the conservative/safest choice? Sorry for all the questions guys and gals...

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Excuse me but i'm a little confused about MA Are they set as MA 50 Ma 20 Ma 8 or MA 50 MA 21 Ma 9 ? Thx in adv

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Hi alt.end Ema 50 - 20 - 8 gd lk

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Hi DREAD, Exactly , thats for going short, Thanks.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Candle No. 3 is the Entry signal by the system. i can see that its too late to enter for short , what im doing in this case, jst enter by low risk. or sometime i ignor this kind of signals. and wait for other signals.... Good Luck.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
much appreciated... is the EA up to par?... i have it setup and ready to go. i have them setup on all major pairs. will keep a record and post accordingly. thanks again. WHAT DAYS DO YOU RECOMMEND TO TRADE AND WHAT HOURS?????

--- 帖子 #141 ---
The Ea Doesn't Seem To Want To Work/load Properly.. It Is Attempting To Load....but Is Failing. **after Loading The Ea: I Left All Setting ALONE/ TO Default Except, I ONLY Changed The Following...... -i Set Alerts To True -i Changed Lots To 0.5 -i Made Sl To 20 And Tp To 20 I Set To Allow For Live Trading Is There Any Thing I Am Missing?? Any Help Would Be Greatful. Thanks.

Hi blanca. for 1min chart im using 5 to 8 pip target first target, 2nd target 15 to 20 pip and the 3rd target is free , the stop 10 to 20 pip, im just using that depends on market condition . Good Luck

--- 帖子 #147 ---
your welcom my friend, Good Luck.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
All signals indicate short, and suddenly after...trend was increasing long. System automatic opened a wrong sell position and... -80 pips ;( What's wrong?

--- 帖子 #149 ---
That's a fairly old EA lol. What did trade trigger say?

--- 帖子 #150 ---
I failed ;( trigger trade say: none... But i think this Dashlat system is good again, i've some pips last week Where's Dashlat?? Someone else again use this EA?

--- 帖子 #151 ---
i think that this system is quite simple.. could someone please do a latest summary of this method? btw, can you guys simplify how to buy and sell cause i'm quite confused. thanks.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
I have been reading this thred over the past few days. I have also tryed this system last night looks good. What I would like to know is can I add or have you already got soom way that the EA can place an alert on the chart when it finds the right conditions are correct for eather a long or short and all I will have to do is press Y/N to eather go ahead or not with the trade. I hope this is not to much of a problem but think it would be a good thing.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
I really like this EA am in two trades at the moment so far up 120 pips. Is that good or what? ERU/USD and USD/CHF Have a good day.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Just found this today and did 2 live successful scalps using the second template this evening already. Easiest scalps I've ever done!!! Thanks Dashlat - where ever you are now! You just made me some bucks!!!

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Just wanna say thanks for the system Dashalt. Have made 3 profitable scalp trades so far, without a loss (grabbing quick 10 pips). If the strat continues that way ill add another order and let it run with a jumping stop. Am glad that Fxprobe resurrected it and brought it to my attention. Cheers mate. Will add some pairs and continue testing in demo.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
This totally rocks!!! I've been trying to find a way to scalp for 3 years and this is it! Just got 17 pips in about 60 seconds! Doesn't sound like much, but when it adds up if you have a winning system. Thanks Dashlat, where ever you are!

--- 帖子 #157 ---
I've been working on a "15" minute based intraday system for 4 years and was very successful in charting direction and entry. The only problem is, many times I am up like 15 to 20 pips only to get a big retrace before it goes goes in my direction again - especially near the London open - then I have to decide if I should get out or not or worse it takes out my stop. With this system I don't have to worry about anything and I will win trade after trade in a row. So far 100% wins on this system with no stress. Set a 15 to 20 pip limit and it quickly takes you out and you're off to look for another entry. Who cares if it goes 50 more pips in your direction - the next time it might go 50 pips against you but you don't care because you've got your 15 to 20 pips(just did another one 5 minues ago). I know of someone that scalps(or I guess technically semi-scalps) for a living and he makes 150 to 200 pips a day just going for 10 to 25 pips a trade. Now I see why he does that. I'm on that road now because of Dashlat. Thank you Dashlat - where ever you are.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
This is amazing. I was just sitting here watching TV and saw a setup on gu and in minutes got my 15 pips. I've barely looked at the chart this morning and got 2 15 pip trades easy. Doesn't take much more to make 50 to 100 pips a day with this thing. Once again - thank you Dashlat, where ever you are.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
I was wondering when this system would be rediscovered.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Are you trading off a 15 minute chart, or the one minute?

--- 帖子 #161 ---
hi can you post some screenshots? i trayied it tooday for about one hour but 2wins to lose - unlucky?;p many pips to all!

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Ronald, any chance of making an EA for the new system?

--- 帖子 #163 ---
This is a nice lil MMA scalping system, saw this thread today and threw together a temp with additional moving average. Original is 8,20, 50. Cheers If your not big fan of stoch, try TVI histogram or your fav indy

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Which post are you referring to?

--- 帖子 #165 ---
An update of everything would be nice. I understand Ronald has not adapted his EA to the newest style of trading yet?

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Post #122. The new system is quite a bit different than the original.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
All done

--- 帖子 #168 ---
How do i get the EA onto my metatrader. I want to start backtesting it this weekend. ty

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Thanks amigo. As always, YOU are THE MAN !!!

--- 帖子 #170 ---
RR, you are one amazing EA programmer!! I'll demo it next week. Thanks a lot.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
And well done! Q: Shouldn't the stoch have parameters for when overbought or oversold? You would put in two #'s. eg, 35-75 for long, 65-25 for short. RSI too. Cheers

--- 帖子 #172 ---
How do i get the EA onto my metatrader?

--- 帖子 #173 ---
That's the long and short threshold...

--- 帖子 #174 ---
ok, Isee

--- 帖子 #175 ---
You use Take Profit and trailing together, trailing kicking in when TP is hit?

--- 帖子 #176 ---
No.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Shame. Ok

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Thank Dashlat and all the kind and generous member that contibution for the forum, it is especially benefit for newies like me. I have read all the thread, still confuse Where can i get the ea

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Think about it... If the trailing stop is applied when the takeprofit is hit, what's the point?

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Please post a couple of your trades so others can see what you saw and when you got in and out. For the benefit of all. Brian

--- 帖子 #181 ---
I think you missed the basic idea of trailing stops here...

--- 帖子 #182 ---
@JamesWeat You just put the EA into your Expert´s Folder. That is all that is to it. Than open your Metatrader, go to the navigation tab and select "Expert Advisors". Select the one you want to apply and drag it onto the chart of the pair you want to trade. :-)

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Dashlat I saw your last activity was 29hours ago, did you forget this thread or what? If you read this please make your presence known to us. Regards, thanks for this great system

--- 帖子 #184 ---
I really looked at this tread as dead and was just excited and really thought I was just talking to myself! Now it looks like this is coming back to life! Sure - I will post some screenshots etc. Also I use the template from post #118 and only use that as entry for the final trigger, but that one minute is powerful once you figure out which way the power is in the moment - and to figure that out just use your general knowledge of trading. Like if the 15 minute sto is on top and now crossing down do you really want to go long on the 1 minute there - I'm just saying use general trading logic. So if the 15 min looks ok for a long, and let's say there is also divergence on the 5 min and price has just bounced off of a pivot, that might be a very strong place to go to the template one the 1 minute from post #118 and enter long when it triggers - the trigger is just the rules on this thread. That's really it. Just really look at everything and see if enough things add up for strength for that move and catch a peice of it. One trade it might be divergence, the next it might be a bounce off of a pivot, but look at everything and see if you think it's strong enough. But I will post screenshots(I hope I do it right I don't think I've ever posted a screenshot before - hope I can do it!) and detail all the reasons I decided to enter. I'm excited because it's not just this template - it's the idea of doing more trades but going for less pips - I think that is the key. But what do I know - I'm just a caveman.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Here is the screenshot of what I saw on the 5 min gbpusd Friday morning with the reasons to look for a long. http://i382.photobucket.com/albums/o...HLATTRADEA.jpg

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Then just wait for the trigger on the 1 min to enter. Here is a screenshot of just going by the rules for the 1 min entry. http://i382.photobucket.com/albums/o...LATTRADE1B.jpg

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Actually, if you look at the 5 min I posted - there were 3 more great trades after the trade I did. You can see where the sto's went back and forth and there were candle reversal patterns. One could have easily made 80 pips all after 11:38 am Mountain. I will repost that 5 min showing the reversal candle patterns for the other 3 trades. Then just go to the 1 min again for entry and go for 15 to 20 pips.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Here is the same 5 min chart showing the 3 other setups on the 5 min after my trade. After seeing something like this(ie a reversal candle and the 5,10 and 15 min sto's in place or whatever) you have more confidence to go in using the 1 min template(from post #118). That's really all there is to it. I think people get into trouble when they try to over analyze or are always looking for another filter etc. Just use your trading logic that you know about and then go to the 1 min and set a limit and watch it hit it. Once you see the light on how easy it really is you will be wondering why you haven't done this before or looked at things like this before. It's all a mind game. Don't worry or get upset that it goes 50 pips more after you're limit is hit. The next time it might barely hit your limit and you'll be glad you set it low. As you can see you can make 80 pips in a short period of time. But what do I know. I'm just a caveman. http://i382.photobucket.com/albums/o...HLATTRADEC.jpg

--- 帖子 #189 ---
just wanted to say great posts "pip"...sure you haven't done this before (screenshots)????

--- 帖子 #190 ---
At first I did an attachment but then people would have to download them to see them, but then I remembered from a paid forum I belonged to that they first uploaded files to photobucket and then back to the forum so I tried that and it worked! I don't know how everyone else does it on here though. I can't wait to see how next week goes!!!

--- 帖子 #191 ---
When im back testing the EA, then entries are usually 5 pips above (long) or below(short) the candle it takes the trades on. and this is getting my SL hit alot quicker and TP hardly every hitting. why is it doing this?

--- 帖子 #192 ---
I think the gap is spread. spread is an important problem when talking about scalping

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Wow sorry everyone - when I posted my 5 min that was supposed to go with my one minute entry I went back too far - don't know how that happened but the funny thing is the correct time of entry looks very similiar to the chart I posted. Here is the 5 min that goes with the 1 min entry I did at 11:38 am Mountain. But the good thing is now I've done 2 5 min charts from different times that are all great setups. I might as well post the 1 min's with that first chart too. I will do that in my next post. http://i382.photobucket.com/albums/o...MAY212010D.jpg

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Ok here is a repost of the first 5 min chart where I went back too far. I marked the 3 trades 1,2,3, then marked those numbers on the 3 1 minute chart that I will post. Here is the 5 min that started around 11:30 gmt May 21st: http://i382.photobucket.com/albums/o...TRADES5MIN.jpg

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Here is the chart for the first trade on the 1 min: http://i382.photobucket.com/albums/o...LATTRADE2A.jpg

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Here is the second trade on the 1 min but since the signal happened so late don't know if I would have taken it: http://i382.photobucket.com/albums/o...LATTRADE2B.jpg

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Here is the 3rd trade on the 1 min. For sure I would have taken this trade. And for the exits so far I am just setting a hard 15 pips limit. Hey I don't want to dominate this thread. People asked me to post charts so I did. Dashlat is de man - not me. I'm just a caveman. Hope this helps and I am out of here because I can't add anymore to this. This is all I know. Good luck everyone and I hope this helps. PS - thanks Dashlat, where ever you are. http://i382.photobucket.com/albums/o...LATTRADE2C.jpg

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Forgot there was actually 4 trades within this timeframe I posted on the 5 min chart. Here is the 5 min again with the 4 th trade labeled and 1 min to follow: http://i382.photobucket.com/albums/o...S5MINpartb.jpg

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Here is the 4th trade on the 1 min. Ok, now I am out of here. Good luck everyone. Thank you Dashlat. http://i382.photobucket.com/albums/o...LATTRADE2D.jpg

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Tried with 0.1 and 1.0

--- 帖子 #208 ---
You'll only see that error if the account free margin remaining after opening the trade is less than 0. Something about your lot size is leaving the account with less than 0 free margin to place a trade.

I have tried 2 different brokers on 2 different computers and still gt this message 2010.05.23 20:02:462010.05.19 17:31 Dashlat's Other System [TD] EURUSD,M1: We have no money. Free Margin = 10000 Any thing you can suggest?

--- 帖子 #210 ---
I get the same message even when i put in 0.01. Is it because its a weekend, so you can not do the back tests?

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Thanks for sharing !! looking forward to more details. Can I know why you choose eur/jpy ?

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Ronald. You know I always struggle with these settings. Can you post a suggestion here, so I have a running start, please?

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Raise your margin to as high as possible. The attached set file is guaranteed to open trades. I just ran a backtest using those settings.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Thanks, will do.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Hi RR, I have to say special thanks to you . thanks for following up. i gonna Forward test the EA this week too, Regards.

Hi, I trade eurusd , gbpusd , also but eurjpy it's move nice on one minute time frame. becouse of some reason i can't be always watch market that is why I trade more EURJPY. Gd Lck

--- 帖子 #217 ---
A good setup on M1, I saw your recent post; welcome back, but I wanted to second that taking the first good setup on the M1 in a direction is important and only taking in the same direction after a good pullback in the opposite direction before your entry. I use the THV trix MTF set to M5, if you will look and see you can easily see the benefit, both clearly showing trend pull backs as well as helping you to only take setups that are the first good setup after the M5 trix agrees with the trade direction. Taking the first trade and not all the additional potential greatly increases your success ratio and also your average win size! Just a simple tool to help without cluttering things up at all. For confirmation there are 4 trades on this chart all of them considerable winners. Brian

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Hi Brian, could you explain just with a bit more of details the correct use of THV T3 trix applied to this system? I probably need to know how to read correctly THV T3 trix. Thank you. I use the THV trix MTF set to M5, if you will look and see you can easily see the benefit, both clearly showing trend pull backs as well as helping you to only take setups that are the first good setup after the M5 trix agrees with the trade direction.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Also unless your time is really limited, I recommend only taking trades where stochastic is crossing and below 50 for a long and crossing while above 50 for a short..ignore the others..on the M1 there are tons of opportunities, only take the best. Brian

--- 帖子 #220 ---
I will post a few trades from Friday to help demonstrate, the thv trix is really good and using the great mtf version allows me to see the M5 trix on my M1 chart so when there is a setup on the normal Dashlat setup, I just look to see its the first good setup that occurred since the M5 trix agreed. IE..if the setup occurs and its saying short but the M5 trix both are green, no trade. If its a short and the M5 trix are both red: 1. If its the first Dashlat signal since the M5 trix change I take it. 2. If there have been other good signals since the M5 trix has agreed with short, I let them go and pass. You want the M5 trix to agree (doesnt have to cross just be the same color, both red or both green) and to take only the first Dashlat signal since the M5 trix agreed with trade direction. The 2nd or 3rd etc are lower probability and also likely smaller trades. The first is the best chance..after you take a short and then say the M5 trix both change to green and then back to red you can then take the next good Dashlat short signal. Pretty basic but very effective and can help take this setup to a higher level for you. Brian The three trades here admittedly are good ones, but perfect examples. The trades show realistic after my spread potential of 30, 25 and 80 pips in 2, 5 and 25 minutes respectively. I hope this helps someone, its effective for me.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
To further enhance chances consider to not instantly open a position after a signal occurs. Waiting for the latest high or low being taken out provides the most reliable results. :-)

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Hi Brian. The indicator you posted does not appear in the indi window, just get a blank. Chances are, it uses another indicator to work off ( most mtf's do), could you pls post that as well. Also, what are the settings you use, might be easier to post your template, so we can see the right settings. Many thanks Pardy

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Why can't you simply follow it from the start? If your time is truly that valuable you would pay for that information.

hi guys, i have to go my driving school ( Oops its my other bussines ) see you again guys.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
I want to use the ea just for more accurate alerts so I can check my setup and of course manually trade if good Can I you use the recent ea to alert when all ma's are correct rsi as well and stoch crosses in direction, but only if below 50 for long and above 50 for short?? I setup a set file but its not alerting correctly per above, may someone help me with settings to do exactly such? I am a manual trader always so not sure what I am doing wrong. thanks Brian

Set SignalsOnly to true and choose any combination of the three signals underneath.

Hey, I have been following forex for quite some time now just not active on any forums. I was testing the new (latetest) system bot from RR. I was wondering if it would be difficult to reverse the buy/sell order when the bot signals. So for instance, as it stands now the bot gets a signal for buy it buys. What I would like it to do is to reverse it so when its a buy signal it goes against it and puts in a sell order and vice versa for sell/buy. I went into the code to try and modify this myself but i have nowhere near the experience to be able to figure any of it out. Would this be difficult for you to do? Reason being is I am testing a strategy for this right now that may be profitable, but I need to test it through an EA, because testing it manually will take up too much of my time. If this is easy and possible please advise, I will post my findings here after my testing is done

hi Dashlet nice system also RR thanks for the support but my system is not catching the trade rather is telling me "Erorr:Incorrect Table Name" plz can someone help?

--- 帖子 #255 ---
budyy ur making a killing with this system.nice just .just wanna be like u lol but i trade only 1 pair..........EU

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Which time frame is better M1 or M5?

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Just nailed 30 pips off EURUSD M5!

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Has anyone gotten the new RR EA to be profitable on any pair in any backtest? I love the idea of how often this strategy trades. Would be great if we could get he EA to trade profitably. Please let me know. Thanks for all your hard work guys!!

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Read the thread, this was already covered. And use the latest attached EA.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Hi Dashlat, thanks for sharing this. Just to make it clear, so you took half load out at +8, then rest SL moved to BE (which was finally triggered), and you can either let it run or go for a larger TP at +20, +30... etc, correct? If your SL is, say, at 15 pips, you finally get +4 on this deal (half at +8, half BE). Isn't it a little bit poor in terms of risk/reward ratio? How often does this happen? Also, same question that someone already dropped: M1 or M5? Many thanks in advance. Nice system.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
I've been using 10sl and 15 tp on M1 and roughly 15-20 and 30-40 on M5

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Dashlat has always used this as a 1 min system as far as I know---I just prefer the 5. Proper backtesting of the ea might answer which is more profitable. The poorer R/R should be balanced by a higher win rate---it's always a trade off between the two. I use the Update stops BEv3 ea to manage the trade.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Look @ post #250

--- 帖子 #264 ---
When I tried out the RR EA, the settings I used were giving me a lot of consistent losses with the losses being much higher than the wins, which is why I asked RR if he could impliment a signal reversal. Upon testing over the last few days I have had MT4 crash no less than 5 times and regardless of if the trades were reversed or not, a negative profit. Needless to say my idea has failed pretty badly and I have no explanation for why that is so. I will continue to modify the settings but it does not look promising. RR: Sorry for wasting your time with the tradereverse option. I hope it did not take a long time. Although I will post any positive results if they come. Thanks

--- 帖子 #265 ---
first of all thanks for a quick reply. i have already tried the new EA that has the extension .set but it doesnt seem to show on my EA list(maybe am doing something wrong) .ur help is highly appreciated RR and thanks all for ur supports

--- 帖子 #266 ---
.set is not an EA.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
God help us of if these people actual have real $$ to play with.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
mind ur business guy!!! thats why u share no idea.i block ppl like u thanks RR for drawing my attention

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Love the avatar!!!! That's awesome!!!

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Oh yeah missed that one. I was going off what he said in first post and also an indication in a PM. Maybe the 5 was an experiment.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
I also did some backtest and it also lost consistently. But I have been observing for the past couple of days on my demo on some 10 pairs, I think we can close the trades as in a basket and then halt trading for the session. I think we can easily harvest some 300+ pips average as in a basket. May be we onto something good here.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
The signal reversal doesnt work , I till you why. Because suppose you bought EU and Sold EU for exact same TP and SL. Both of them could hit SL due to spread.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
I don't think you are even making real $$ better than him. Whats your problem?

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Sorry, I am using the non-reverse EA. It catches onto the immediate M5 trend fairly quickly but since it may just be a retracement of the long term trend, we need to get out quickly as in a basket and harvest the pips and wait for the next session.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
I flipped it actually, when I reversed the trades I also reversed the TP and SL, I played around with the settings for each numerous times, it just wasn't working. One of the problems is that once I scalp a good couple trades, it keeps opening further trades in that currency pair.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
I noticed a similar phenomenon. When I had it going and I was watching it, It was up 30-40 pips in that each currency was up a couple of pips 7-8 each some more some less. And I also noticed that it tends to open several currencies within a relatively short amount of time of each other. However, We have to take into account that all these trades could go against us and we could have a negative basket loss and we also have to count on it opening several trades (signals must be there) in order to accomplish what your saying. On the positive side, I did this several times and closed out 20-40 pips each time within a pretty short amount of time. Could you elaborate a bit on how you think we could execute this consistently? Look forward to hearing from you as this does have some potential as I have seen it work because I've done it also. Leaving this thing on as a bot, however, doesn't seem to be the best bet.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
I hear what you are saying - if we can tell when is the tail end of a run. My computer was such a problem this week and what I found out is everytime I restarted it, I got a nice basket of trades. This is the third time it happened to me. I think is more than just luck. The signal looks good and we see if we can avoid getting in the tail end of it. Unfortunately, we cannot backtest in basket. May be I will set up 2 demo, one for London session and the other NY and see how it goes.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Hmm, Are you taking trades on the 5M TF? I was using the 1M TF, as it opens up a lot more trades but a lot more are false signals as well. We should definitely test 5M Minimum. The hardest part, like you said, is going to be finding out when the best time to run this is. When you were getting the positive pips, how long did you have it going for before you collected? Was it quick like within 10-30 minutes or longer?. I sent you a PM as well not sure if you got it.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
I have my demo on M5. For example, tonight I had happened to turn it back on and it around 23gmt caught some 500 pips. I have Steve's Trade Manager on and if it hasn't for it, I think it is even more pips.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Hmm that's a lot of pips. How long did it take to build up to that?

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Well, I saw it reach 500+ pips at around 8gmt so that is about 9 hours.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Sounds good. I'm gonna get some rest lets continue this tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Hi Elizo. yes the Rulls are same as what you said, as you know we try to get FGE and its giving us a chance to win 8 pips easily ( mostly go 8 pips on FGE ) , the second matter is SL , SL going to place a bit over or under Pullback, by considering the size we can manage our Lot Size if pullback is small so our SL is small then the Lot Size have to be Big , when pullback become big so Sl is Big and then we should enter by small Lot Size bye considering this when SL is very big its a trader have to decide NOT TO ENTER . when you trade always and practice always with system, and watching higher time frame to find the market direction, you can win alot. Gd luck

--- 帖子 #288 ---
is there any good result with the bot?

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Hey, I ran this bot opened it at 11am Pacific Time, came home two trades went and stopped out at -50 pips each and another couple are going right now for a basket net loss of about 15-30 pips. This is set on the 5mTF tradereverse= false EDIT: My apologies, When my MT4 crashed it reverted back to 1M TF, damn waste of a testing period.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
I have several Yen pairs long are in dd and may be going to hit sl. Tonight is rather quiet and nothing following through. Well, it's still early and let see if major move will come in the new few hours. I am thinking to move the starttime closer to London open when there is more following through.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
I did a test on 5M earlier in the day, 1 trade was a winner other two hit 50 pip SL and others were going down even more. At one point the "basket" was -100 pips before it went positive and then eventually negative again. I switched over to reverse trades and made about 30 pips basket. Now i set them up again and its going up and down, all with trades reversed. Was up 20 is now down about 15. This is something that needs to be run once a day like you said and that's it. Question is when that time is. Also, I'm not 100% sure where this bot is taking trades. Check your pm.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Dashlat. Still trying to figure out when to enter a trade safely.

hey buddy Dashlat always say that is a scalping system,so u just have to hit and run then wait for another entry major pairs i think but is working for me in EU.i have been testing it since yesterday and is been okey...but i trade it manual Good luck

Hi traders, https://www.myfxbook.com/portfolio/deshat-ea-mod/33500 here are my stats with the second newest EA with 10pips SL, 35p TP and 6p TrailingSL. I ran it on almost every major today (about 16 hours). So NOW is the time to go back in history, look up trade for trade and optimize. If you guys like to, i would participate in your evolvement. best regards Wowa from germany Edit1: Chart USDCAD longer outlook (click to enlage my screens): http://img442.imageshack.us/img442/3570/34242493.th.gif Uploaded with ImageShack.us EA made alot ill-adviced trades: http://img38.imageshack.us/img38/4020/51719960.th.gif Uploaded with ImageShack.us I've realized that imho we could never get the EA to work properly. To many important things are missing: - trading out of the range with momentum - taking the round numbers as S/R and not to short or long into them immediately - trading the range-bounces etc etc. I'll stop the EA experiment and go for further discretionary development. I've read we got a higher timeframe filter here somewhere. Its a nice confirmation for now but we got make some more research. too bad

G'day Dash Just got this 15 +10 on aussie right near news---bailed on 2nd order at that pin bar. Just wondering if you recommend a specific trading time (playing around with the ea)

--- 帖子 #300 ---
See here poss short trade at NY open on aussie was filtered out when trendline broken to upside. Probably a good filter for most systems

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Hey Bullrun You still around??

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Sorry, I have no luck in getting the same result as last week. The market is not the same again. I am still not able to find a filter to prevent robot from opening way up at the end of a trend and not sure if we will ever find one. It's the bot greatest strength to keep opening into the trend when in strong trend but becomes it's greatest weakness when the trend end. Were you able to find something new that works?

--- 帖子 #303 ---
I have been struggling with finding the right time to run this thing properly. The weekend just passed so I wasn't able to test it at all (obviously) and I have been busy all day yesterday and today. I was thinking of letting it loose on the opens, New York, London and Asian trading session, see what results we get. My plan is to turn it on a minute or two before the open, perhaps it'll catch the proper trades, run with them for 20-30 minutes (or enough to get a decent amount of pips) and shut it down. What do you think about testing something like this? If it goes against us all the time we can always reverse trade thanks to RR I sent you my skype ID, we should chat there if you have some time as it would be easier to bounce ideas back and forth. Cheers

--- 帖子 #304 ---
just the few times i used this system .i have been testing in diff market conditions.thanks Dashlat and RR.....where is every one @ ?

hi Math sorry i have not been on my pc since my last message. yes i trade manual with signal from the EA. though not all the signals that i use....have to sit on the pc lol

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Math my EA cannot enter trade automatically .i have tried so many times so i just trade manual .infact lookng @ the signals am better off make my own chose with real money..to be frank about it

--- 帖子 #310 ---
whats up Dashlat .here is the version that am using on the attach.sorry i dont even know the version meanwhile i trade manual .i use it for signal only. i use only the indicator setting but the other things on top i dont use them MA 8 0 1 0 MA 20 0 1 0 MA 50 0 1 0 R S I 21 50.0 50.0 STOCH 5 3 3 50.0 50.0 SIGNAL,ALERT ,SIGNALMAIL,PLAYSOUND ...TRUE ECN BROKER ...FALSE TICKDATABASE...

--- 帖子 #311 ---
u can get from the setings above. Thats what i use but is manual hey freddy maybe my settings have a problem thats why it cannot go automatic. Any help any one?

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Hi webglobe, Not sure how new you are to EA's but have you got a number in the lots field? ? 0.1 etc. Post your set file if you like and I will see if thats the problem.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
I think you have two problems and try changing them to: 1. Lots = 0.1 2. TickDatabase = FALSE;

--- 帖子 #314 ---
thanks for ur help but post #310 has my info but i have something on the lot size and magic # but is like i have answer to that question from B-Run.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
hi Bull thanks for that i have changed it but will test it when next I trade meanwhile i prefare to manually test this EA so that i will be the one to enter when am too sure......i will give u feed back

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Hey webglobe. You definitely need to make sure that you have some type of lot size entered, whatever the minimum is for the broker that you are using. What are you stopping trades based on? What criteria? You have made a lot of profitable trades, from the picture all of your trades have been profitable. How have you done since you posted that screenshot?

--- 帖子 #317 ---
whats up buddy.i have not really traded since then,i have been too busy. well i set my lot size for 0.05,i get out when i make some certain judgement like stoch 5,3,3 is about crossing.u know this is scalping .as u can see i have few long trades(i left them long just to see what the EA could do to my account not really to make alot of profit)if u look back u will see that 1 of my long trades went against me(remember am just testing) so how have u been doing with ur own test?

--- 帖子 #318 ---
To be honest with you, I haven't had time even 1 day this week to test anything. That's the problem with testing, a lack of time. I might put this on the backburner for a week or two while I focus on something else but will definitely come back to it. Let me know if you get any other promising results and I shall come back to this much quicker. Again, the EA seems to be very random in its results. If you have time, try testing it on a minute or two before the london open on 8 or 9 pairs and leave it running for about an hour, see what kind of overall results you get.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
lkewise me i have not been on for sometime but i will try that b4 the london open maybe next week . have a nice weekend guys

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Hell Ronald Could you add the screenshot for entry and exit? Thanks much for coding this EA and thanks to Dashlat for the method Regards

Hi everyone I'm interested in this system and I'm willing to share some ideas that I have, let me know if anyone is still following this system. I'll check the post

--- 帖子 #322 ---
go ahead. has anyone else had any success with it ?

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Yep....I'm listening

--- 帖子 #324 ---
I'm recently reading this thread, I've already read it one time and I'm going to go through it again, I'm not demoing it yet but I'll do it tomorrow, anyway the system sounds promising somehow, I agree with that trix adding that you see in other post recommended by golden1, and I think a fibo pivot would do a great help in this system and any other scalping systems. I'd be happy to make this thread active again so if someone willing to start demoing it and have any idea I would be happy to hear. I'll add the last version indicators and template with the trix and fibonacci pivot if you would like, to help us to be in the same way to continue.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
hey guys + 3 pips Gd Lck

--- 帖子 #327 ---
This system works well in a trend. Here in the chart the stochastics 8,3,3 is used, and the TP is when the stochastics comes back down from being overbought breaking the 80 line (or whenever it is overbought and you feel price has peaked). I only used the stochastics being oversold for entry, not below 50 mark. This helps weed out low ranged price action (unless there is divergence present). Fyi, the system's rules are here for anyone that doesn't know: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=111645&amp;page=9 I also note the 8/20/50 EMA are mathematically 2.5x multiples. You can thus throw in the 125EMA as the fourth if you wish.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Here is a case when the 8-20-50 all cross at the same time. It may be that one can look to enter long if stochastics turn below 40 and short if they turn above 60 after this occurs. The second chart shows that this cross can be explosive.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Here's what a good countertrend divergence trade looks like with these EMAs. Note how the EMAs are all fanned out and the stochastic made a divergent hump. [The purple line near the entry isn't an EMA but rather the boundary of my Bollinger Band Fibonacci Levels indicator].

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Hi all, At first glance seems a very good system. I have to try it. Thanks. Just one question: - what are the settings you are using now? sto (5,3,3) and rsi(21) and ema (8, 20, 50) ? - rsi white and maroon, what rsi is this? - i have read the whole thread (really) and don't see why MACD was removed. Besides, the histogram is on the MACD Signal, correct? Or was it ( MACD - SIGNAL )? mmmm, that was three questions. Sorry. That day I skipped school. Best Regards and Happy Pips gonso

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Hi all, I have used the system this morning, eur/usd, and no way. at 06:27 there was a good entry (i was still asleep) but at 6:41 and 6:48 there were signals that made bad entries. Something wrong with my entries? (times GMT) So I started looking for a slightly different approach (crying solves nothing). It was using the crosses between RSI(10) with its own EMA(10) instead of stochastics. Haven't had time to check real-time, but in the past seems to work reasonably well. Any opinion? Best Regards and Happy Pips gonso

How did you far with the EUR drop yesterday. Also I am looking for a good Scalper EA to put on a smaller live account for testing.

Hi, Ronald Raygun , I know it's an oldy, but I can't get the Dashlat's System to work for me - I attach it to a chart and after I change the inputs, mt4 crashes.. Any idea why? Appreciate any help and direction (ps, you are our FF wonderkid ).

Hey guys! I have been testing the new and improved version with some slight tweaked settings and on ETH/BTC. All you need is RSI Candles ( Color change at Oversold and Overbought levels) and Stochastic (5,3,3). Rules for buy: We wait for a CROSS when STOCHASTIC is OVERSOLD. Once it crosses we make sure the candle it crossed to is bullish and the candle before is a Green RSI Candle. I'll post some pictures too, it's working great. Keep it smple!

Can you share the indicators and template please?

Results are actually similar to original system. Not worth changing.
