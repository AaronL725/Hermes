this system is no longer under developement.

The idea is to have small to zero losses in ranging markets and then make a killing on trends.

Carmen has the simplicity of a moving average system where trades open and close on MA crosses, but she has 0 lag.

This system is for the one-minute timframe.

*****************************************************
There were two themes for the latest release, v4.00: better ranging performance, and a simplified, more intuitive interface.

*****************************************************

Better Ranging Performance

The CARMEN indicator now actively employs three different methods to limit losses due to ranging:

1) 50% of your position should be closed early when the trade is in profit 6-10 pips. The exact value is determined by the variable quick_profit. If the whole trade is not a success, then this profit taken early will reduce the loss to nearly breakeven once the second 50% of the position closes.

2)Untill the whole width of the channel is in profit, the channel will follow the price a distance defined by breakeven_rate. Once the channel is in profit, it will then follow the price at a distance defined by the much slower expand_rate_1. This will help the latter 50% of the position close with minimal losses(or even a small profit) in the event of a sudden reversal.

3)A secret indicator is used to measure trend strength. The period of this indicator is defined by Xindi_period. When the strength of the trend falls below start_trending, then the channel lines turn red and NO new trades should be initiated. When the channel lines turn green again, then it is relatively safe to open a new trade.

Simplified, and a more Intuitive Interface

System Rules:

When the channel lines are Green and when the MA moves outside the channel, open a new trade. If the price is below the channel, open a sell. If it is above the channel, open a buy. The MA should now be Yellow. When the MA turns green, which will happen soon if the price continues to move in the direction of your trade, then close 50% of your position. Close the second 50% of the position when the MA crosses the channel again. If the MA never changes from yellow to green, this means that the price has suddenly retraced. If the channel is still green when the price exists through the opposite side of the channel, exist the position and open a new one. However if the channel has turned red, then simply exist the position, but do not open a new one.

Setting Descriptions:
Play_Sound? : plays sound when indicator indicates a trade opening, trade closing, or when a position should be reduced.
Send_Email? : sends Email when indicator indicates a trade opening, trade closing, or when a position should be reduced.
Show_Message? : shows Message when indicator indicates a trade opening, trade closing, or when a position should be reduced.
spacebase : width of channel in pips
bufferplus : channel will follow price at breakeven_rate till channel is width of channel*bufferplus pips above(or below for sell) order open price.
start_trending : if indicator value is below start_trending, then channel will turn red and no new trades should be opened.
Xindi_period : period of secret indicator that measures trend strength
breakeven_rate : channel will follow price at breakeven_rate till channel is width of channel*bufferplus pips above(or below for sell) order open price.
quick_profit : MA will change from yellow and green and 50% of position should be closed when the trade is in profit by quick_profit points
expand_rate_1 : distance that the channel will follow the price before profit has reached start_at_pips_profit_2
start_at_pips_profit_2 : Determines how profitible trade must be before channel will follow price at the Main_expand_rate_2
Main_expand_rate_2 : Determines how closely the channel will follow the price when profit is between start_at_pips_profit_2 and start_at_pips_profit_3.
start_at_pips_profit_3 : Determines how profitible trade must before channel will follow price at the Main_expand_rate_3
Main_expand_rate_3 : Determines how closely the channel will follow the price when profit is greater than start_at_pips_profit_3

Updates:

v1.01 - 2NOV2009

- Indicator now draws correctly for any currency, just select 4-digit broker or 5-digit broker in indicator settings panel.

- Indicator settings now in whole values.

v1.02 - 2NOV2009

- Indicator automatically determines 4-digit or 5-digit broker setting.

v1.03 - 2NOV2009

- I can take errors in the calculation but errors in the drawing drive me crazy. Fixes drawing for cases when there is not a lot of historical data.

v2.00 - 3NOV2009

- Now the trader can set up 3 groups of settings for three different market moods. The EA will automatically switch from group to the other, depending on how profitable the current trade is.

v2.01 - 5NOV2009

- changed some internal variables to make the indicator a little better

- made some extern variables internal to simplify to the interface. if you want them back just change the source code.

v2.80 - 11NOV2009

- lots and lots of changes

- channel is now mirrored to trade ranging markets

- settings change now based on distance from base trend, vs profit of trade

v3.10 - 27NOV2009

- more similar to the versions before v2.8. Backtracked because 2.8 could only handle ranging around the trendline, ranging in other areas still created havoc.

- indicator now handles ranging by employing two trailing take-profit lines to grab profit early. these lines follow the price at user-defined distances and these distances can be set to change at three different user-defined levels of profit.

- descriptions for the settings are in the indicator.

v4 - 18DEC2009

- added several design features to limit losses due to ranging

- simplified the interface, made it more intuitive
v4.01 - 18DEC2009

- added requested feature: extern variables for line thickness's

- resets alert trigger on MT4 close

sorry,i have absolutely no idea how to trade this carmen,exit and entry's on cross?,could you please explain it more in detail,newbie and no clue!

thanks!

--- 帖子 #3 ---
When the white line is above the yellow and blue lines, buy.

Then when the white lines falls below the yellow and blue lines, close the buy and sell.

Then when the white lines rises back above the yellow and blue lines, close the sell and buy.

And Repeat.

You'll always have a order open with this system.

And don't forget money management.

good morning,

added his EA in USDJPY, TF H1 and M5, but the result is equal to the chart that accompanies it.

Is there a different configuration that should be done?

Grateful

--- 帖子 #5 ---
It's because your USDJPY has 3 digits past the decimal point, and the default values are for 4 digits past the decimal point. My bad.

Give me a sec and I'll post a quick fix to detect that.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Okay, I fixed it. It will draw correctly on any currency now. The only difference is all the indicator settings are now in whole number.

Refer to my first post for the updated file.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
yeah...thats fine. You'll have to change the other 3 variables too.

breakeven_buffer

space

expand_rate

--- 帖子 #8 ---
thank you very much. will observe the strategy for a few hours and give you my opinion hulide.

my only question is how to "repaints". they occur in this EA? There is a statistic on this issue?

--- 帖子 #9 ---
yes, except for ideally those variables are extern variables so you can easily change them. But it wouldn't be hard to figure out a fix for that either. I prefer my way. Its simpler.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
You really shouldn't spill those beans, lol.

I got into a small debate on this forum afew weeks ago. He wanted to invert a loser to make it a winner. Well there's only 1 consistent loser I know of, and that's a system that never takes a profit (regardless of stop loss). The inverse of that is a system that constantly takes a profit. Think about it.

Of course there's a few more details to consider, but overall...

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Nice Thread.......except the fact i had to scroll left to right instead of up and down....(over sized chart)  grrrrrrrrrrr.

thx,

todd

--- 帖子 #12 ---
I'll make them smaller next time.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Thx,...I'm just messing with ya anyway.

By the way...kool indicator.  Looking at the 1min chart for e/u, it's sure been long for quite a while.

thx,

todd

--- 帖子 #14 ---
If this thread gets enough attention I might release an EA for the indicator, so that the values could be optimized. The EA would include a few other tricks.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
embarrassed to show my ignorance, but in the indicator settings, if i have a 4-digit broker, do i only need to change the 5-digit broker from true to false or are there other steps above my pay grade that need to be done. thanks in advance...

--- 帖子 #16 ---
sounds good!

May I ask you how successful you are with this system?

Are you mechanically following your rules or you judge other conditions to enter the trades?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #17 ---
I'm using IBFX and the second indicator you posted here, and see nothing but a white line running through the price, on a 1 min EUR/USD chart. Is there supposed to be some other colors somewhere?

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Sorry, changed it to 4 digit and the lines appeared.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Confused with the wording of your entries and exits when looking at your charts. Shouldn't the rules be..When the white line is above the yellow and blue line, you should buy.

When the white line falls below the blue line, you exit.

When the white line falls below the yellow and blue line you sell.

When the white line goes above the yellow line, you exit.

Can you add arrows and show us when you enter, exit, sell and exit on your 5 minute charts. Thanks

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hi aicccia,

I downloaded the indicator, chose 4 digits for  MT4 and still nothing appeared on the chart. Did the same thing with the second still nothing. Please help.

Tia, Gab

--- 帖子 #21 ---
i put it on my chart look like interesting..when the white line cross the blue or yellow line..any idea to add another filter for this indicator..thank's

--- 帖子 #22 ---
can i use this indicator on 4hr & daily charts? can you also tell us what ur indicator has or does?

tried it on 4hr chart and it didnt work. can you please let me know thanks?

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Choose 5 digits then, give it a try. If you can't make it work, it's not a big loss; not that great of an indicator if you look at it over time.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
This was causing a lot of confusion, my bad. I just upload a new fix, v.1.02. It will automatically determine if you're using a 4-digit or 5-digit broker now, so you can concentrate on the important stuff.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Hi. Do you use it on 5min tf only or you can use it on higher tf too? What pairs do you use n what's your tp and sl? Thank you

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hi aicccia, Interesting indicator. Have had a read through your other threads. Congrates on your 12 vouches.

Re TraderColin post below, are you able to recheck your post #3 & reconfirm what you posted.

cheers scalpz

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Hi,

Sorry to trouble here, i cant seem to load the indicator on my 5minute chart, i've paste it at indicator folder... and load the default settings, nothing appears...

Hope someone can help me out here, using version 1.02

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Did you compile it?

--- 帖子 #29 ---
can you please tell if this will work on larger tf like 4hr and daily. also I loaded the indicator on my chart and it didnt work. ler me know

thanks

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Hi,

Thank you for your reply.

yeah, i just did, and got no errors, but when i load it at chart, stil got nothing yet... at journal says loaded successfully yet got nothing on chart...  anything else i can do?

--- 帖子 #31 ---
no, I worded the system rules correctly.

If the line that we use to close trades is the same line that we use to open trades, then very frequently the price will criss-cross the line over and over and we'll lose money even though the price may be in a solid trend.

See the below picture for an example of what I'm talking about. The white circles are false closes and re-orders that we're avoiding by closing and opening trades on two different lines. The green circle is the correct place to close.

At least I think its green. I'm a little colorblind. lol

--- 帖子 #32 ---
try zooming out.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
managed to get it, but its only works on first 85 only, how about the previous bars?

Refer to my pic...

Thanks

edit: and it only works on 1h chart, tried changing other time frames, it wont show up...

--- 帖子 #34 ---
As I said in the first post, timeframes are relatively irrelevant because the system trades directly off the price action.

The only difference you'll see from one timeframe to another will be from the change of resolution. For example, the 5-minute chart will  has 3x the resolution of a 15 minute chart, and a 1-minute chart has 5x the resolution of a 5-minute chart and 15x the resolution of a 15-minute chart.

This increased resolution allows the system is to get in and out of trades quicker.

While there will be some instances where trades are opened on the higher resolution timeframes(1-minute or 5-minute) that close as losses, that never would have opened on high resolution timeframes(15 minutes and up), these few losses will be easily offset by the large number of pips that will be saved on losing trades and gained on winning trades by getting out quicker by running the indicator on a high resolution timeframe.

So I recommend the 1-minute timeframe. I do all my testing and development on it.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Okay, I can handle errors in the calculation but errors in the drawing drive me crazy.

I fixed it, refer to my first post for the updated file.

And you'll def want to change the default values. The default values for the GBP/USD.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Now it works, can i double check is this how your 1m charts looks like too?

--- 帖子 #37 ---
hi aicccia,

Thanks for sharing.

Can you / anyone please make this indicator into a ex4 format ?

i cant find the indicator when i open my MT4 Chart.

Thanks...

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Yes.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
let me look into the chart and report back soon...

--- 帖子 #40 ---
I am joining the testing of your notion, aiccia.

but my out of the box experience has it working

fine on M5 but on no other TF.

Any ideas?  I'd like to get it onto M1 as you mention.

Ron

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Did you download the latest version, 1.03?

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Ah-ha. I see it...thanks.

R

--- 帖子 #43 ---
I just spent some time with carmen. shes great! I've made 400 pips on my demo account since I downloaded it. Seems like a good indicator, but i had some problems with it that maybe you can help me with. On the 5M chart the white line crossed the yellow line and I went short.

After that I opened a second chart, went to 1M, and loaded carmen. In the new chart the white line hadn't even crossed the blue line!?!

I'm not sure what caused. Any ideas?

Oh and thanks for the holy grail~!

EDIT: got 1.03

you're fast! =P

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Please anyone can help ??

To make this indicator into a ex4 format ?

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Yes I do have an idea of what caused that. It's not a bug though, the indicator is working properly.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
I'm way ahead of you man. I"ll have an EA out soon.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
No..U misunderstand my words.

What i mean is that there is no indicator show on my MT4 Chart.

I cant find your indicator ( After opening of MT4 ).

Even though i have put it at the correct place, expert => indicators folder.

I think i am too dumb here....Sorry.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
No it doesn't repaint.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
If your MT4 is already opened and running, you have to shut it down and restart again. Hopefully you can find this inducator after that.

Harry

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Thanks for your reply.

I have tried and it doesnt work and also i have tried Re-Install the MT4 Software. Both cant work.

I am sure indicators with .ex4 extension can work for me.

Unfortunatly this indicator is in mq4 extension.

If anyone can help, a thousands THANKS to you in advance...

--- 帖子 #51 ---
you have to compile it. After you put it in the indicator folder do this:

1)Open up MetaEditor.

2)Open up the indicator in MetaEditor (File, Open, ect)

3)Look at the top of MetaEditor, there will be a toolbar and on the toolbar will be a button named "Compile". Click the button. It should now show up on Metatrader.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Also, make sure that you are looking for it in the "Custom Indicators" folder. In MT4 there is "Navigator" window and there you can see the list like this:

Accounts

Indicators

Custom Indicators

Scripts

Carmen indi should be found in the "Custom Indicators" folder. If you saved it to the right place, it must be there.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
hi,

you can try this,its from my mt4-folder

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Ok done.

BIG Thanks to aicccia and others too for helping...

You guys rock..

Thanks again...

I love this place...

--- 帖子 #55 ---
hi aicccia,

how about exit or reenty's,should we wait til cross for exit?,is it possible to reenter on bounce white/yellow?

--- 帖子 #56 ---
aicccia,,thank you one more time this so nice to be used on small tf, love it, no missing every single moment, just sitting, grab some food and keep watching the white line crossing the yellow or blue line great..thank's..

--- 帖子 #57 ---
you're very welcome.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Thank you or sharing this very interesting indicator. So far it seems to work well. Still testing.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
May I ask you how do you deal with ranging periods like the one on the image? I counted like 12 - 15 not very good trades that can add up to 150 - 200 pips loss. Do you wait for big trend? These occur every once in a while and may wipe out profits made on bigger moves...

I make 100 pips on previous bigger move, then lose 150, then make 100, then lose 100, ...

Edit: The same period but M5 timeframe looks like is not that bad (second image). So, it looks like we should not go down to M1, right? I am confused a bit since you said TF does not matter...

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Hi Aicccia,

it is incredible your indicator, I think it is something very impressive.

I rarely write on this forum even if I've been looking at it for years: this time I can't only watching.

My sincere congratulations to you and you aknowledge.

I am testing it on 1 min TF, trying to find the best settings.

I think that it is interesting even watch the white line that touch the two coloured like a channel, maybe in rangins markets it is useful:

open LONG when touch the below up and close when touch the up down, open SELL when touch the upper from up and close when touch the below from down.

I noticed that if I wait both the lines to be crossed I often close in pair or loss a very good trend, but maybe are just my settings, you are the absolute leader of this system and I will stick to your rules in case.

The very important thing to me is that this indicator looks Perfect for building an EA.

I think an EA could massimize the potential of Carmen, expecially thinking about Trailing stop function together with Stop Loss, related to the Rules you stated before.

Very thanks again,

I will look forward to see improvements and test it.

thanks again,

iopoipoi

--- 帖子 #61 ---
I am getting two different set of rules from you.  Which is the correct one?

--- 帖子 #62 ---
The first quote is not from me.

It's from another trader that mis-read the second quote and was asking for clarification.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
what is the deal with the indi in post one.  every time i try to save it, it is trying to save it as a php file.  what is that???

CARMEN Indicator v2.00

Several traders who tried out the CARMEN indicator noticed that the default settings(which are for trending markets) do not work well on ranging markets. To solve this, in carmens_eyes_v2.00 there are 3 groups of settings. Each group can be tailored for a different type of market.

Main New Feature:

Now there can be a group of settings for when a trade is first opened, a second group for when the trade is mildly profitable, and finally a third group of settings for when the trade is deep in profitability.

Take a look at the below picture to see for yourself:
http://fiat-luxx.com/trading/threegroups.gif

Here's the detailed descriptions for the new settings.

till_breakeven_rate : Determines how closely the channel will follow the price till the trade breaks even. RECOMMEND 1
space1 : Determines the width of the channel from the beginning of a trade till profit is greater than start_at_pips_profit2. Each standard deviation is equal to 6 pips. It should be wider than space2 and space3 so the trade has room to grow when it is first opened.  RECOMMEND 3-5

expand_rate1 : Determines how closely the channel will follow the price after the trade has broken even.  RECOMMEND 20-60
start_at_pips_profit2 : Determines how many pips of profit the trade must be in before following the second group of settings.   RECOMMEND 40-60
space2 : Determines the width of the channel after profit is greater than start_at_pips_profit2. Each standard deviation is equal to 6 pips. It should be less than space1 but greater than space3.  RECOMMEND 1.5-3
expand_rate2 : Determines how closely the channel will follow the price after profit is greater than start_at_pips_profit2.  RECOMMEND 50-100
start_at_pips_profit3 : Determines how many pips of profit the trade must be in before following the third group of settings.   RECOMMEND 100+
space3 : Determines the width of the channel after profit is greater than start_at_pips_profit3. Each standard deviation is equal to 6 pips. It should greater than space1.  RECOMMEND 0.5-3
expand_rate3 : Determines how closely the channel will follow the price after profit is greater than start_at_pips_profit3. RECOMMEND 100+

CARMEN Indicator v2.00 in Action

Notice the wider channel on the left narrowing as the trade turns profitable on the right.
http://fiat-luxx.com/trading/versiontwo.gif

--- 帖子 #65 ---
You're right, with v1.03 we were forced into fitting one group of setting to every market type. I just uploaded v2.00, it lets you specify 3 different groups of settings, and then will automatically switch from one to the other, depending on the profitability of the current trade.

Check it out here.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
even more impressive

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Are you sure space 3 should be greater then space 1? I'm thinking less

thx,

todd

--- 帖子 #68 ---
try it, if it works better let me be the first to know.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
TraderColin, I've thought a lot about this tonight. The logic you describe is the logic I used on an earlier private version of Carmen. If I can bring it back, it might dramatically increase the profitability in ranging markets.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
I am using the V.1, amazing I trade on 1M, i keep watching the highest TF also as my main trend controller..awesome

The new version must be better than the first one..great job aicccia,..two thumbs up..

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Hi aicccia,

Please could you expand on how to use these three setting? Do I need to change them as the trade progresses?

Many thanks for sharing such a good indicator.

Take care

--- 帖子 #72 ---
aicccia, do we enter a buy or a sell when the candle associated with the white line closes, or immediately when the 'white line" crosses the respective yellow or blue line? great work, by the way !!!!!

--- 帖子 #73 ---
I'm not doubting your settings, i just question it because your instructions are a bit mixed.

space1 : It should be wider than space2 and space3 so the trade has room to grow when it is first opened. RECOMMEND 3-5
space2 :  It should be less than space1 but greater than space3. RECOMMEND 1.5-3

space3 : It should greater than space1. RECOMMEND 0.5-3

You see if space 1 recommended is 3-5 and you say space 3 should be greater then space 1, then why is your recommeded space 3  0.5-3?

Either your space 3 recommeded is wrong or your word 'greater' is wrong.

thx,

todd

--- 帖子 #74 ---
hi aicccia,

thanks 4 sharing this indi. could you resize your charts 4 easier viewing??thanks.

if you are writing an ea for trading this indi. how would you filter false breakouts? would you set a trailing stop that is optional for the user?? can you add alerts too?? thanks

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Hello,

First of all a great thanks to aicccia for this wonderful indicator, it sure seems to have great promise.

I downloaded version 2 and compiled it how you indicated in a couple of posts back and have been using it. Is that correct so far?

Secondly I was wondering do you recommend using this on the 1M or 5M timeframes and can it be used on any other pairs besides EUR/USD/?, which ones do you find it to work best on?

Thirdly, I was wondering about your rules, after looking at the charts, it seems as if you entered the trade when the white line crosses yellow and blue lines and exit once it crosses below the yellow and blue lines, most often the trade would result in a break even or loss. That is for a buy and vice versa for a sell. Should that always be used a profit taking exit or should profit taking be used on our own discretion?

Thanks

Hi All,

Is anyone else having trouble with the blue and yellow lines?  I put the indicator on a 1 M chart, but the blue and yellow lines are missing.  Any ideas?

Thanks.

Hello aicccia

I am stunned by your indicator. My conratulations and thanks.

It seems to contain every aspect of a model I have been trying to trade for some time now - also known as "tunnel method" or "line in the sand".

I only finished reading the thread a few minutes ago and I am very excited to do some back testing and checking the settings in order to fully understand its workings. If it is what I think it is, then you might have here a real winnner.

I will follow this thread with great interest and come back to it with findings or questions soon.

Regards,

--- 帖子 #80 ---
hi all,

how about the first setting 'till breakeven rate'?,i havnt found it on the last version or i have missed something?

...till_breakeven_rate : Determines how closely the channel will follow the price till the trade breaks even. RECOMMEND 1...

--- 帖子 #81 ---
[quote=aicccia;3198990]Just released v2.00. Check out the intro post here.

I had a pretty good idea for an indicator about a month ago but it had some drawbacks, and me being the perfectionist that I am, I went back and completely changed it.

I have read this thread with both interest and bewilderment. It appears to me to be an example of "The Emperors New Clothes". Everybody is praising and admiring them but nobody can see them. The other explanation is that I am just stupid since I cannot see how you can make any money on a regular basis by following the indicator. If you follow the instructions you buy or sell at one end and wait until it fluctuates all over the place and reverse it at the other end with no profit points in the middle.

What am I not getting here????

Granted it gives you a direction for entry but so will any number of other indicators but I fail to see a consistent "take profit" instruction that will generate profitable pips other than that caused by unpredictable volitility. I never thought myself as particularly dense but I just can't see the benefit here.

Can anyone help?

--- 帖子 #82 ---
I just loaded the indy myself and your thoughts crossed my mind too

So I read, er,skimmed the whole thread , fast mind you. it's not very long, you mite give it a shot  I think the channel changes as the trend goes, so, the idea is you stay about even till the big one hits

--- 帖子 #83 ---
I have read the whole thread twice and some posts on it three times and I still can't see the benefits of the indicator. I'm hoping that aicccia can straighten me out or someone else that can see the benefit that I cannot.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Anyone else has the same problem?

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Hi guys, just read thru this thread and found it very interesting and promising. I have download the lastest v2.0 but somehow i feel that is different from the rest of urs. I have uploaded it, please help to check. thanks

and also for the 3 settings in the new version, do we need to do anything?

I just did a short when the white line is below the yellow and blue line, am i right to do that trade? but as what aicccia had mentioned, when the white line is below the yellow and blue line, do a sell and when the white line is above the yellow and blue line, close e sell and do a buy. But when that point of time, i already losing pips, so when i close the sell and do a buy, i am just trying to break even, so in e end, is always lose pips, gain pips, lose pips, gain pips, a cycle, am i right?

--- 帖子 #86 ---
uh huh, untill the the big move comes, he explains it very well in POST #1.

I just fired it up myself, I'm gonna watch it for a few days

hi,

i think its not an EA,its a normal indi,put it into your experts/indicators folder

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Aicccia,

Thank you for sharing your unique idea. What a great and simple concept. I have just read through your thread, and am anxious to try your indicator out.

I use IBFX mt4 for charts only, and trade my live acct. with a non mt4 broker. I assume I must also initiate a trade on the mt4 account in order for the channels to change as the trade progresses from range to trend. Is this correct?

Also, do you recommend closing out your trades, before news, than getting back in once direction has been established?

Have you tried any pairs other than GBP/USD?

Thank you in advance, and many, many pips to you.

hmmm... i read thru e post #1 but still no idea how to enter and exit..i am using version 2.0 and there are 3 settings, do i need to do anyting? thanks

--- 帖子 #90 ---
The rules are pretty straight forward and simple. I just found the thread this afternoon and am watching out of curiosity

--- 帖子 #91 ---
I think is correct,

but this is the great value of the indi for me.

In fact, for what I see in front of me, the real potential can be obtained with the action of trailing stop, not a take profit that would kill the value of following a big move.

An EA with trailing stop is the perfect way to extract value from this indi for me.

another think that I noticed is that sometimes the older version gives better signal, but not on all pairs and timeframes.

still looks incredible to my eyes

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Hi all,

Sorry, but I have read the whole thread and did not see how you compute the blue, yellow and white lines. I do not use MT4, so I cannot read it. Could you please post the computation or the rationale of the computation of the lines? It looks interesting and I would like to study it in detail.

Best Regards and Happy Pips to all.

Hi all,

Been testing Carmen together with GannHiLo for flitering.

Looks good for now. Will monitor more on this.

Btw, I am using Carmen Eyes v1.01. Only change expand_rate parameter to 25 for my liking.

Thanks to aicccia for this lovely Carmen.

Pro. what time frame are you using.. can you post the indi here..?

Thanks rebel

--- 帖子 #96 ---
I'm using M1 and M5.

Top pic showing M1 movement and bottom is M5.

The indi can be found here in FF. Out of respect to aicccia, I think is not good for me to post the indi. Hope you don't mind.

~profi~

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Thanks pro... and good wook aicccia

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Hii

can anyone explain the entry and exit rule with a screenshot much appricated..

thanks again for the great indicator

--- 帖子 #99 ---
A solution to the endless reversing may be to take profit at pre-determined levels based upon historical moves away from the channel.  You could use the close of the bar that coincides with the white line break of the channel, or the high/low of that bar.  Then try to come up with a stop loss that would statistically contain all of these moves.  If you do this on a regular basis and keep track of the optimal take profit and stop loss levels (kind of like an ATR indicator would give you an idea as to an increase or decrease in the trading range over x number of bars), you should be able to lock on to something that produces an edge with this system.

Hi Aicccia,

Would it be possible for you to re-post version 1 or the original carmen indicator. I am currently testing the new version, however the original seemed to work much better. Thank you.

Okay guys theres a video I found just before this thread was started, I think it would be appropriate to share this here as it may help someone....

This youtube video is showing a method very similar to this, but I beleive there using a chandelier type of stop indicator in the video, in this video the guy doesn't mention though what method or indicators there using, But i think it may be using ATR in this method? Looks quite promising, small stops being the strong point so losses are kept small.

youtube.com/watch?v=CvifFRJKtIc

Can anybody make anything out of this video, or get any useful info from it so that we can improve on this indicator? I believe there using eSignal for their charting but they didn't share what method it even is or what proper indicators there using.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
EDIT: sorry WilteredFire it was a bad question.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
this looks VERY familiar to me... This indicator is essentially one of the variations of my smartstop with no horizontal shifts, only vertical shifts. The only difference is that aicccia has used the same indicator as an entry point as well.

Aicccia, because I've done extensive testing with this nearly exact same setup, I'll tell you now that it by itself, will not be profitable long term unless you can figure out some sort of buffer that I may have bypassed.

Tho it might have slightly different results because of how you have it drawn (based on physical trailing stop, and is still just MA's that Averages the trailing stop instead of PA) and with the added "mood" setups, this may very well be the ultimate indicator in the end, as I'm not a programmer, I couldn't go extensive or vastly advanced with my studies, but I suppose only time will tell.

Ok everyone, let the flame begin, I know ya all want to just bag on me for shits and giggles... so let er rip I guess.............

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Thank you Walb99.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
They are using the Chandelier, I did a google search, and found this indicator on forex-indicators.net, it may not be exactly what your looking for/they are using, but it's a start. As for the entry, I'm not exactly sure what they are using, but it seems to be very effective. Hope it helps.

Here you go, this indicator was programmed by Swingman, and is missing one major rule (that is really only considered when a trade is active)

The additional rule is this.

In a up trend, if a trade is active, and the MA retraces down, do not adjust stoploss, only adjust stoploss when MA's make higher highs, not lows, opposite applies for down trends.

and it also doesn't give the options in this particular version to vert shift, but I've included the source code as well so you can modify it to include said features.

Guys one thing if i remember right in the video, it doesn't seem to be plotting as much of the Chandelier stops or these trailing stop type of lines as the chart that walb99 just kindly shared...

Maybe they were using some sort of filter to to only give signals when theres a higher higher or a lower lower perhaps?

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Hey guys,

Sorry to say this, but if you want to introduce something new but has nothing to do with Carmen's system, please create a new thread.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Hey, if you followed my post from the previous page I actually shared something that may be of some good use to this thread and Carmens indicator so that we can get better results and maybe improve the indicator. Im not here to distract the thread or start chucking in a bunch of indicators and take this thread down another road.

Maybe you should go back to the previous page, and watch the video link I shared and you'll see  the similaritys between Carmens indicator/setup and the one shown in the video?

If carmen says that this isn't useful to the thread or irrelevant. I'll stop posting

--- 帖子 #110 ---
It's a frely posted system, and as a result will be subject to individual modifications that WILL be posted.

I don't believe that anything we've posted thus far is anything different than what aicccia has posted, my smartstop is very similar to aicccia's system here, he/she has just taken it a few steps further, and the chandelier is also very similar to what aicccia's system is proposing. I think if anything, these two particular contributions will assist aicccia in his/her research and development.

BTW aicccia, please correct me on the he/she bit, because I honestly don't know.

Thanks for the heads-up, but including the non-extern variables, there are billions of possible configurations. I have a hard time believing that not a single one is profitable. Also, the indicator you've had experience and mine are not completely the same. Yours appears to be made up of a single line under or above the price.

My line can morph into a into a thick block if needed in choppy markets.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Nope, change your chart background color from black (or change the black line color to something other than black), there are 2 lines (if your talking about the smartstop indicator, and not the chandelier)

The reason it looks similar is because it uses the same essential properties, only like I've said in my previous post, you've made it more advanced in the respect of properly locating more significant levels of S&R by setting your MA's to be that of a trailing stop, which is sized depending on the "mood" of the market. These are things that I myself could not do, or even really consider as a possibility because I do not have programming abilities. This is by all means your baby don't get me wrong. I just find it interesting how similar they are, and thought that you might be able to benefit from my indicator to help improve yours.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Very studpid question, but here it is:

Why did you name this indicator "carmens eyes"?

--- 帖子 #116 ---
till now i really had no ideas on when to enter... i am looking at M1 TF and using Gann Hilo as an aid as well.  can anyone assist me?

I have attached GBPUSD 1MIN TF and EURUSD 1MIN TF. It seems like for EURUSD, only can see the white line, the yellow and blue line are right at the bottom of the screen.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Try to adjust "expand_rate" setting.

Based on my testing, different "expand_rate" setting will put the Blue and Yellow channel in different position.

I suggest when using on M1, try to set 25.0 instead of default 75.0

~profi~

--- 帖子 #118 ---
ok, thanks. but how to enter and exit? do u mind if u can explain visually? thanks

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Well here you go.

Here what it looks like on EU. Top pic is M1 and bottom is M5. The magenta dotted line is the Daily Pivot based on my other indi.

Hope this will help.

Here you go.

I'm having some programming issues that are prevented me from completing the EA, which is needed to find the best settings. I'm getting some help from some much better programmers here on the forum so stand by on this at the moment.

Here are the visual open and close rules. Buy when the white line above both yellow and blue, sell when its below.

I just upload an incremental update, v2.01. You can get it on the first post.

The changes are:

- changed some internal variables to make the indicator a little better

- made some extern variables internal to simplify to the interface. if you want them back just change the source code.

The picture in the post above is with v2.01.

In ranging markets, the indicator should now be more prone to breaking even on trades rather than small losses. (Remember the profits come from the trends, in ranging markets we're just trying to keep the profits we made on the trends)

Also I'm thinking that the "thick block" idea at the beginning of a trade was not such a good idea, hence the default value of 1 for the variable that controls that.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
The EA will be named Carmen.

Looking at the indicator, it's like we're looking through the EA's eyes, or Carmen's eyes. lol

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Hi aicccia

Thanks for the latest version.

I just attach the indi on EU and using the default setting. Even though you already mentioned the setting is recommended for GU.

At first glimpse, I can see that the new version is much suitable to be use on M5 and above timeframe. It looks a bit edgy if using on M1.

Is my finding correct about the new version?

Thanks in advance

~profi~

--- 帖子 #124 ---
yes it's possible, especially on eur/usd.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
do you think that it works on lower tf like 1m and 5m?

in the picture above you exited with the buffer of 1pip? i'm i right? we have not to set a SL or trail stop nope? we have to wait the white line cross and the system after a determinate pips (wich is that value?) change the deviaton and we will exit at wite cross that is exatly @+1pip?

i know, i'm wrong

but please explain

--- 帖子 #126 ---
[quote=aicccia;3210587]I just upload an incremental update, v2.01. You can get it on the first post.

Thx for the great indicator.Im still using v1.3 but cant get the 2.01v into my metatrader.I think it needs to be compiled somehow but i have no clue how to do it.Could you or anybody else be so kind and post the compiled file,so that i can load it directly into the indicators folder.I would really appreciate that.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Thanks again for the awesome indicator.    That's all anyone needs to do is avoid taking a trade when your within 10-15 pips of a major d, m, w pivot point and your chance of raking in some pips are extremely high.

I've been testing the 1st version and this latest version with good results.  I changed the settings on the 1st one so that the indicator follows more closely to the price and with no more then approx 20pip space between the blue and yellow line.  I don't like when the price gets too far from the indicator because then it's too easy to give back profits.

thx,

todd

--- 帖子 #128 ---
I tightened up the carmen v2 settings for the 5 minute charts and carmen's eyes act a bit more like the line in the youtube video that WilteredFire posted back on post #101.

space1 = 4.0

expand_rate1 = 10.0

start_at_pips_profit2 = 10

space2 = 2.0

expand_rate = 20.0

start_at_pips_profit3 = 30

space2 = 1.0

expand_rate = 45.0

I was playing with this last night and made decent profits on my demo account.

Attached is a chart illustrating an entry and exit/reversal

--- 帖子 #129 ---
It takes me awhile but I'm finally beginning to see what you are creating here. I've been looking at it as a manual trading indicator on the rather low volitility EUR/USD. Between the post quoted above and using the indicator on the "cable" I got a revelation. I like your new version best and am currently experimenting with splitting trades. (Letting one trade operate according to the rules and taking profit on the other at what appear to be opportune moments i.e. S&R, crosses etc)

I can't wait to see your EA. I think it will be a blockbuster.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Even though it should be simple, I'm having some serious issues getting the EA to to follow the indicator lines. There some programmers from forexfactory looking at what may be causing the problem but if someone here has the skills to use icustom and wants to try making a simple EA for this indicator, please fill free to do so.

The main issue I have with this strategy is in ranging markets, the channel runs straight through the trend which is the worst place for it to be. Ideally, in ranging markets you want to stay out as much as possible, and just pick the tops and bottoms. My last major indicator did just that:

http://fiat-luxx.com/trading/chart1.gif

It's big drawback though was in a trending market, when the price dipped bellow the upper channel, it sometimes would stay in a sell even as the whole trend continued up. This was discussed in the above mentioned thread, it was an unacceptable problem to me and I moved on and from that indicator CARMEN was eventually born.

Now while CARMEN excels where my previous indicator had trouble, she now has problems, unacceptable problems to me, in ranging markets, which is where my previous indicator did splendidly.

So as you might guess, I'm currently trying to combine them into one. The finished product won't follow trends as well as CARMEN or perform in ranging markets as well my previous indicator, it will be a compromise of sorts.

It will do better in ranging markets than CARMEN and better in trends than my previous indicator.

The new indicator will be CARMEN v3.00.

And hopefully someone can make an EA for CARMEN 2.01 in the meantime.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Hi Aiccia,

very interesting your point,

but don't you think it would be better to search for the perfect set up with Carmen EA?

I saw in incredible potential inside of it, and many users I see are trying to optimize it with profit.

the power of finding the right trend is proceless, I think

even considering some minor losses in ranging markets.

just my 2cents

anyway, thanks again for your work.

still incredible to my eyes

--- 帖子 #132 ---

Here is the EA that pops up an alert when a cross of upper or lower line occurs. You must have carmens_eyes_v2.01.ex4 in your indicators folder.

It does NOT trade. This EA just checks if the cross occurred on each new closed candle.

You can add the trading code in the EA, I do not have time for that right now.

Enjoy!

Edit: I added a sound to the alert.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Thanks for the alert indicator...but according to the EA, it shows the blue line as: 1.4868, but the actual blue line is at: 1.4874.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
It looks ok in my MT4. Make sure you have default settings in your indicator. The settings in the EA are copied defaults from 2.01 version.

I changed the timeframe to M1 just to make sure, but it looks ok there too (second image)

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Thanks hotstorm...recompiled the indicator, with default setting, and it looks ok now.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Great indicator aicccia...I am testing it on M1 timeframe with the default setting.

Just a quick question: Let's say, I just openned up my MT4 platform, and want to initiate a new position....I see the white line just crossed above the blue line...time to go long at the market (as it shown in the attached)...correct?

--- 帖子 #143 ---
You can redownload the EA with alert, I updated it to include the sound with the alert.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
I am glad we have an alert now.  I am unable to be by my PC because of my job.  Can someone possibly add an email alert to this?  Then I can have them sent to my phone and can trade via my phone from work.

Maybe a simple alert which indicates the pair, price and BUY or SELL.

I would do this myself, but I am not a programmer.

Thanks to anyone who can help with this!

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Did you get the short alert on eurusd? I didn't get it!

Also with unemployment claim coming up shortly, I don't think taking the short trade is a right trade to make...

--- 帖子 #146 ---
No, I also did not get the alert triggered. Strange, I must double check the code... sorry, it should be working.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
I changed the condition from this

if(CarmenAverageCurrent>CarmenUpperCurrent && CarmenAveragePrevious<CarmenUpperPrevious)

to this

if(CarmenAverageCurrent>=CarmenUpperCurrent && CarmenAveragePrevious<=CarmenUpperPrevious)

I was zooming the chart and it looks like the value of the yellow and white line were equal, so the condition was not fulfilled.

I mean the condition was to trigger alert if previous value was above (greater) the yellow and current is below (smaller). But if the previous value was equal, then the condition was not true. I think it was that. I reuploaded new version. I hope it will work correctly now.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
The reuploaded version is in previous post.. or forgot to attach?

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Thanks hotstorm...will give it a try.

Looks like the short signal from carmen is holding very well. This was a good test to see how carmen behaves during news time.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
aicccia,

nice system, I like the idea of making the EA adaptive to market conditions... I'm trying to do this withsome of my current EA's and am mostly basing it on ATR and CCI... PM me your thoughts and ideas or just post em here, I'd like to help with this development.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #151 ---
I was watching it live and it looks like the indi repaints so it does not trigger alerts in the EA everytime we see a cross on the screen. Maybe aicccia could look into this....

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Thank you hotstorm for the alert EA.

One of the experienced programmers that I submitted it to said he thought it was re-painting also.

If it truly is, I promise its not designed to and its only another example of my poor coding.

Anyway, I believe I know what may be causing the repainting and I'm doing my utmost to avoid it in v3.00

But I love the collaberation, seriously.

If anyone wants to look into it, I believe the re-painting would be coming from the profit value and profitx value getting reset somehow. They shouldn't get reset till the trade is closed.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
I took the e/u 1min just a short time ago.  Had to ride out a few bumps but stuck with it.  Decided to not stay in the trade until another cross.  I think taking profits and scaling out of your positions is better management imo.  Although I did bail early.

Grabbed 1/3 +8

1/3 +9

1/3 +12

Hi todd,

interesting

but I insist,

how it would be taking it only with trailing stop sets at 15 and stop loss at20or30or40?

better or worse?

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Guess I havn't noticed any repainting issues that would cause me any concern.  I've been putting arrows on my charts where the crosses happen and refresh my charts a couple hours later and there's been no repainting in the crosses.  Except one time when the cross happened when the market was very quiet and my candles were only about 3 pips in length.

This method/system gets me into trades a bit late compared to my other method I use.  But this type of system is very attractive because it's pretty much just enter on the cross and don't think much about anything else, and it feels real good when it's a successful trade.  But imo you just can't blindly enter these trades without looking at where the s/r levels are.

If someone could ever come up with an EA that would avoid taking trades that were within 10-15 pips of pivot points, I think it would be one heck of an EA.  That's one reason why I never use them.  They just can't seem to know where support and resistance is.

thx,

todd

--- 帖子 #157 ---
You may want to consider tweaking slightly the expand_rate3 setting.  Looking closely at your chart below, you would have been stopped out with a small loss if you had been adhering strictly to the rules (as I understand them from aicccia's explanations).  Not a big deal as you would have made it back with the next short trade.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
iopoipoi I don't use and actual stop loss except for protection.  That 50 pip stop you see in the manager is just that, protection.  My stops are always an indicator signal which usually average not much more then 20 pips.

Otherwise my trailing stops are after 10 pips the stop moves to +1.  Then after 30 pips it moves to +10.  Assuming I let it run that far.

thx,

todd

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Thanks todd for your explaination,

I am considering trailing stop 'cause of the power of catching trends has carmen; even considering the losses due in ranging market, with trailing stop I think you could find a mid term point to close in profit, avoiding the distance carmen has from price action that would close the trade in break even or little gain/loss.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Results from the past week using v2.01.  There's still an open trade that I would probably exit before (Friday) market close.

No filters or ancillary indicators whatsoever.  Strict entry/exit rules.  Seems to work reasonably well on EJ but hard to say with such a small sample i.e., one week.

Sorry about the huge image.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Money Management

I belive its time now to explain my personal money management system which I think is the icing on the cake. If you'll look at the pic in the above post, while there are losses, if you add up the trades each individual day, on each day the system gained more than it lost.

So my money management system is to keep the same lot size per trade until at least either X bars have passed since last lot recalculation, and a min number of trades has occured.

Personally I recalculate every 24 hours, and on the 1-minute chart, this means I'm recalculating every 3-6 trades. This smooths out my equity curve ALOT, because its rare to not come out positive after 3-6 trades.

So in the above pic, on the first day he made 150 pips. And then I would recaculate the percen of lots I was gonna risk on the next trade (1%,2%,3% ect) at midnight.

The the next day he made 62 pips. I would then recalculate at midnight...

And then the next day he made 248 pips. Again recalculate at midnight...

And then 50 pips positive for the next day, recalculate...

And then the pic ends with -37 closed and a open trade in the green.

Of course you can always customize how long you go before re-calculating, and min trades before re-calculating, but this really helps to smooth out the losses and its mentally helpful too. You don't have to worry about losing one because you know what really matters is the big picture and your average ratio of wins to losses.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
thanks, I've always been huge believer in "less is more" and "simplicity is beautiful". So I've always been very focused on keeping things as simple as possible with trading...but then also applicable on any timeframe/currency and that's the hard part.

How do you calculate your stop loss and take profit targets?

--- 帖子 #167 ---
hm ... i dont know why indicator has such name, but i think its nothing more then "step MA" i can put screenshot and indicator also if someone is interested .. but its long time ago i was using indicators, so i need to check my archive  but my opinion is that it is step ma and if not its 90 % similar to it.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
All the calculations are done for you within the indicator based on your external settings.  We don't need to calculate anything if we simply follow the entry/exit rules:

It's the epitome of simplicity.  Closing a long position means you're next trade will always be a short and vice versa.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
You think? Because it resembles one of your dusty old ma indicators? aicccia and the other FF coders he's working with are all just trying to make a big joke on everyone?

Bugger the screenshot. I have a better idea. The source code has been generously made available for all to see. Why don't you have a quick look at it and return with proof that carmen is a step ma or "90% similar to it" (whatever that means).

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Interesting system, seems promising.

Here are the results for EUR/JPY from the beginning of October:

18 winners - 2042 pips  ---  22 losers - 917 pips

Ave winner - 113, Ave loser - 42

The only drawback is that you would have to trade this 24 hours a day.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
That's the 800lb. gorilla in the living room.  An EA is the only practical way for most people to take full advantage of the system.  I have the added disadvantage of not trading live on MT4.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Since you're opening on a completed bar once the Average is above or below the CarmenLower/CarmenUpper spikes will make your "small losses" much bigger. Also keep in mind that on a cross above the CarmenUpper you will buy at the Ask which will cost you Pips and vice versa. You will never be able to enter or close at the Red or Blue Lines.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Hi,

Have a problem to download the indicator ?

Get only attachment.php ?

Can you help me ?

Regards

Chievo

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Yes I know.

But since I don't know the actual values of the lines till the price is right there on top of them, it's a guessing game to set stop or limit orders. And if I was opening on a cross of price, vs a cross of averages, I would lose many pips due to spikes.

The spread is one of my biggest enemies on the lower timeframes and the only way I can fight it is to only open trades when I have a very clear cross, and this means getting in a little later sometimes.

To make it a little easier i created a line which is the middle of the Red and Blue Channel otherwise I don't know how you can get the EA to only open a Buy or Sell when it passed through both the Blue and the Yellow Lines. With the original code it would have opened a buy when trading inside the channel and then breaking to the upside.

Somehow it doesn't always close the open position despite passing through the MedianLine multiple times. Maybe others can work from here.

EDIT: Changed it back to work without the Median Line. Caused to much trouble.

Hi !

i can't download the indicator, i don't know why. I download it like attachmant.php file and not like a normal file mql. Why?

Thank you

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Found a small bug. Of course for the Close Condition it's enough if the Average crossed the Upper or Lower Line without looking at the PreviousAverage. Has to be changed.

Watching chart with "Carmen" on 15 TF min.. Here is what I've

been notice.. In general pair always return to the middle in Yellow/Blue

line range. Problem of this method is that you losing all the profits while

waiting appositive direction crossings. Most of the trades are positive,

why not take 40-50 pips profit, but instead wait till white line cross another

those Blue/Yellow for the other direction and potentially get nothing or even

lose???

Here is what I can advise. (Based on 15m TF ERUJPY) when White line

cross the blue one (for LONG positing) enter long and we need another

line Adjustable let's say 40-50 pips HIGHER then Blue/LIME one which tracks movement (Like MA with +50 - 50 pips

away from Blu/Yellow), ones it's get hit

Take Profit and wait for another crossing either direction, same thing

we need for  SHORT another line 40-50 pips (based on 15TF) below

YELLOW line, ones it's hit then Take profit So? We basically need 4 lines

instead of 2.. Check for your self! Ones Trade gets too far from Yellow/BLUE

it's always reverses, why wait??? Take Profit and wait for another setup!

Here: Take profit every time trade moving away from YELLOW/BLUE (LIME) in my example for 50 pips (adjustable

depends on the Pair volatility and TF) AND WAIT! for another SETUP. In my example when Pair gets away 50+ pips

from the Lime/Yellow it's more likely would reverse back to median and we don't want to wait for this.

Can Anyone ADD 2 more lines? below Yellow and above Blue (Lime) (Adjustable?)

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Another Example. Every time Pair doing violent move away

from both lines in my example 50 pips it's always retrieves back to

median.. Here EURUSD 15 min TF.. See what I mean???

that 50 pips should be adjustable even to 20 pips for less volatile pairs.

This should be adjusted to collect 50-60% of the moves other trades (if no condition met) could just played out

as described on page 1.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Doesn't make sense the concept of a TrailingStop (thats basicly what this Indicator is ) is to let profits run not to take X Pips out of a move.

Only if you let profits run they can be bigger than your average loss.

Btw you marked the Buy at the wrong spot and the trade would still be open in that picture with room to go higher.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Here is the example of clear uptrend.. pair running away about

20 pips from the Lime line.

Conclusion? TP line should be SET to 35-40 pips to not disturb

such uptrend.

Look:

--- 帖子 #184 ---
You totally don't get it.. It's not a trailing stop and you do let the

largest profits run, look my last screen shot.  Has nothing to do with

trailing stop loss.... Anyway.. Do what's good for you..

--- 帖子 #185 ---
The indicator is drawn using trailing points, so in a sense, yes, he is using trailing stops to generate the locations of the lines.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Ok, perhaps you can name what I'm talking about Trailing Take Profit?

Also I don't know what Trailing points INDY is using but look at this example

Pair running 50-60 pips back and forth and Indy lines are sitting without

any change?

--- 帖子 #187 ---
I agree that taking small profits usually limits your ability to cover losses, but I think it is important to realize that the nature of the markets makes it hard to find large moves without significant retracements.  While I'm not sure whether 50 pips is the best answer or not, I think Skyzer's reasoning makes sense.  There is some level, whatever it may be, on whatever timeframe, where moves typically won't continue without retracing.

If you watch E/J, for example, it typically goes one way in the asia session, and very often goes the other way in London.  This would typically cause any sort of trailing stop to get hit.  On the other hand, if you have a good feel for a pair, you know that exiting with an 80 to 100 pip profit (in my EJ example), is going to make you more pips in the long run because the next session will most likely hit your trailing stop.

Psychologically we like trailing stops because "someday it'll keep me in a really big move!"  And who doesn't want to see +500 pips on their statement someday?  However, I'd much rather consistently see 80 pips, and understanding the probabilities behind a system and R:R is a must.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
This seems similar to the Vegas Tunnel.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Exactly my point, a trailing stop, or trailing point only moves if PA goes above the last highest point, because of this, when it's ranging like this, the lines don't move (because when the PA is above Carmen, it doesn't go higher than the previous high to bring up Carmen, and same when PA is below Carmen, only when PA makes new lower lows from the beginning point of the flatline in Carmen). Also, Carmen's "width" is also dependent on PA distance from Carmen, The faster/farther PA gets from Carmen, the larger the "Retrace Grace" given to prevent whipsaw stopouts due to the new volatility.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Ok, guys, please pay attention, that I'm not talking about hard 50 pips

TP.. I'm talking about 50 pips away from either Yellow (SHort) or Blue (LONG)

line. So it could go for hours just 20 pips away and then spike

to 50 pips away, that's where you TP.

That's the big difference, Because ones pair get that far from Carmen lines, it

almost certainly going to retrace back to median potentially save you 50

or even more pips.. This won't cut off up or down trend.

Scroll you charts on 15m TF and see for yourself.. Look for wide moves away from Carmen lines.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
The big profits in this system do come from the trends...putting in a 50 pip TP would limit this profit potential a lot, but it's also possible that making 50 pips on most of the trades would make up for missing the big trends.

Having said that, the functionality that you're asking for already exists in the system. I made the two variables, start_at_pips_profit2 and start_at_pips_profit3 internal in v2.01 so use v2.00, or you could just open v2.01 and make those two variables extern again.

Once you have a version where they are extern, simply make the first group of settings follow the price losely. Then once profit reaches the level you want(in your case 50 pips), you'll want the second group of settings to be much tighter. And then what you set the third group of settings to is up to you. Prehaps lose again.

Below is an example of what would work for you:

Inserted Code extern string SetOne="*************Set_One_Settings***************";
extern double space1=3;
extern double expand_rate1=50;
extern string SetTwo="********Set_Two_Settings***************";
extern double start_at_pips_profit2=50;
extern double space2=.5;
extern double expand_rate2=1;
extern string SetThree="*******Set_Three_Settings***********";
extern double start_at_pips_profit3=100;
extern double space3=1;
extern double expand_rate3=50;

Set start_at_pips_profit2 to whatever you want your pip goal to be.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Thanks a lot I'll look into it

--- 帖子 #193 ---
I took a look at those settings myself and they do seem to work pretty well.

Thanks for the idea!

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Aicccia, first of all thanks for sharing your indicator!

I think Skyzer's idea was a little different than the settings you recommended.  On the default MA indicator you can add "levels" where the ma is projected up or down however many pips you input.  So, if levels could be added to your indi, when the price keeps going up, you wouldn't take profit until it spiked up unto into the +50 level (which isn't static, it moves along with your blue/yellow lines) or until it crossed back down for a regular exit.  This would basically get you out on big spikes and save the pips lost from an almost inevitable retracement.

I think it sounds like a good idea and is definitely worth checking out.  Hope this helps!

Thanks!

Cory

The question is : where should I put TP ?

All this morning working on that.

On one side if you close trade when PA cross back yellow/blue = a misery pip basket ! (0 to 100 and going back +20 pips !)

The other side is to have a hard point TP : 35, 50, 75 or 100 pips ?

Even TP at 100 sometimes you can have more !!!!

Then the only way is TS

For the moment doing research on most major TS at 35 pips. Will check 40 and 45..

Or there some champion of Trade Simulator to do that quicker than me ????

Last thing that you can only put a TS when the trade is open on MT4...

(on Oanda you can pre-set the value of TP, SL and TS (in bucks or pips): you enter trade bingo ! Everything set !)

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Sorry for large image, I just open chart full screen to show details. You lose nothing

when you TP at spikes.. Yes we need 2 additional LINES above and below

adjustable (Like in MA you can ADD LEVELs +50 -50 in Properties), so those 2 lines track exact movement of both Carmen lines, but

we need them SHIFT +50 -50 ( in my example).. Look, show me what

we going to lose if we stay in those trades except just additional loses?

So IDEA is to enter on the Middle and exit as far as possible away from median it won't hurt profit, if you catch the trend.

See this trend would survive just fine: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=184

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Without any offence : you should read my post before writing such things...

--- 帖子 #198 ---
I agree too. I see more profit at first line instead of waiting to exit at both lines. Food for thought my friend.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Aicccia

In your first post you say that you do not use MAs anymore.

However upon closer inspection, your white line looks like a 4 day Close EMA.

Also, your blue and yellow lines look like open price of previous day (with a few pips buffer) which starts adjusting at Frankfurt Market Open.

Can you please elaborate more on this.

Logical.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Look man  I dont care if its step ma, i dont care if you all here want make joking of each other, and i dont need to make fun of you or how you meant that, i only wrote, that indicator is similar to this one, i have attached here in this post. And i dont care if i have proof or if you want proof of something : D here you have indicator and screenshot with some basic settings, and do whatever you want with that indicator .....

--- 帖子 #201 ---
I plotted on my chart and it looks like a 3EMA on close. i would love to get some insights on the total system....on the calculation

--- 帖子 #202 ---
The source code is published already. What do you mean?

To aicccia!

Can you please check the first page with the latest version of the indicator. There seems to be a download problem. I could only load an FF attachment, which was not to open by any program.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Thanks for the clarification.

The carmen indi is not a step ma but I can understand how someone could mistake it for one on first glance.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
The white line is definitely a 3-period EMA close.  There obviously has to be a way to track price and it appears this is the method aicccia chose.  There are also several calculations that use this value (AverageFX) so it's doing a lot more than simply drawing the white line.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
yeah they def seem similar.

but v3.00 won't be similar. you can bet your life on it.

and it will kick v2.01's ass.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
@walb99:

Had the same problem.

Download it ( the so named attachment ) and rename it to

Carmen.....( original indicator name )

Than it works.....

Thank you!!!

--- 帖子 #209 ---
I went back the past 3 weeks looking at every trade on the 1min and 5min e/u using both version 1 and the latest version. The always in method was not profitable at all. The only way I could come up with a net profit was taking a set amount of pips, which was approx 50pips if I remember right. Anyway the profit after about 20 days trading averaged about 10 pips per day when all was said and done. The losing trades were always 20 to 40 pips and happened way too often if held until another cross. Even trying to take a set amount of pips was difficult because even though I could show approx 53 wins and 7 losses, (trades that were in profit at some point) those 7 losses (trades that never went into profit of more then 2 or 3 pips) created were enough to put a huge dent in the profit. Mainly because there is NO way to know when to take profit and when to let it run. If we knew that answer, we would all be zillioinairs. Of course I never took into account for news or major s/r. I was strickly looking at mechanical trading only.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
thanks for the info.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Are you using the default settings?  After I fine tuned space3 and expand_rate3 to work with EJ M5, my results (using v2.01 only) have been quite respectable.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
I used default and I tried different settings. Maybe it's just EU that's more of a dog at times.

opie999 how far back did you test your settings?

Looking forward to testing V3.

thx,

todd

--- 帖子 #213 ---
todd, try space3 = 4.0 and expand_rate3 = 35.0  That seems to work best for me on EJ/M5.

I've only gone back about 2 1/2 months.  Tiny span of time, I admit, but we've seen a wide variety of market conditions.  It's very obvious (as aicccia has made clear) that carmen kicks butt in trends and does a fair job of minimizing losses during ranges.  I hope V3 has the self adjusting algos aicccia was talking about that may turn the small losses during ranges into wins.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
I've been having a bit of fun experimenting with putting the indicator on the same chart twice (GBP/USD) and have done pretty well with it. I haven't come to any conclusions and have to test it further. The first indicator is set to recommended specs and the second is set to Space = 1 and Expand rate = 2.5. I change the colors on the second indicatorand only use a single SMA (3). Sometimes I offset the SMA with a 1 or 2. So far it gives pretty good signals.

With all the intelligence and expertise that is reading this thread I thought I'd mention this and see what develops in the way of an improvement of Carmen's eyes. There is no question in my mind that in order to be of maximum use an EA will have to be developed and since I know more about brain surgery than MT4 programming (I know nothing about brain surgery) my main contribution to this thread is to toss in an idea or two and see where they go.

One other thought....In order to better visualize the effectiveness of the indicator I block out the price bars and strictly watch the indicator and MA. I also forgot to mention I'm using a 15M timeframe.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Seems to have very good entries, but need a better ( profitable ) exit strategy.....

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Like most systems do.....

--- 帖子 #217 ---
On this subject, I made a discovery regarding a better way to take profit with the system . I'll put in a more detailed explanation of why it works with pics later but the crux is...

The default values for expand_rate so far have always started small and then become larger.

This is intuitive because we instinctively want to breakeven asap, but it's the completely wrong way to go.

expand_rate instead should always start large and get smaller, like this:

Inserted Code extern string SetOne="**********************Set_One_Settings***************";
extern double space1=1;
[b]extern double expand_rate1=75;[/b]
extern string SetTwo="**********************Set_Two_Settings***************";
extern double start_at_pips_profit2=50;
extern double space2=2;
[b]extern double expand_rate2=40;[/b]
extern string SetThree="**********************Set_Three_Settings***********";
extern double start_at_pips_profit3=100;
extern double space3=1;
[b]extern double expand_rate3=20;[/b]

Try it and you'll see the difference. At least it makes a big difference on v3.00. lol My personal life got a little busy suddenly so I haven't had time to complete it yet.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
aiccia,

have you any schedule for v3.0 ?

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Hi

In the Carmen indi posted on Post 1, There is no option to set start_at_pips_profit2 OR start_at_pips_profit3. Is that the most recent indi.

Please suggest...

--- 帖子 #222 ---
It's all there. V2.01. Go to the Indy Properties ---> Inputs..

--- 帖子 #223 ---
I have the same problem. Hve downloaded Indi from the 1st page ??

Missing the options ?

Have only space and expand rate ???

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Thanks for the reply but Please see attached screenshot...

--- 帖子 #225 ---
In V2.01 aicccia made those internal variables.  You can easily change them back to external yourself but it's really not something you have to be too worried about at this point.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Click the paper clip icon...download Carmen Eyes v2

You will get that input properties.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
WE need EA or at least semi-EA for just Enter when lines crossing,

because it's almost impossible

to enter trade exactly or near, when the line is crossing manually

and it will be even harder on the real live account, cause when

pair is moving you'll get "off quotes" error messages and when you

finally place the order, it might already too late..

Test account will place the orders even when pair is moving, no problems,

that's not the case in the real account.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Hey, Skyzer.

I have no idea what your trading style is or how you're using the carmen indi but the signals I'm receiving dictates an intraday style. Maybe half a dozen or so signals per week.  Off quotes aren't going to make much difference in the long run.  From what I've been observing, most times I could easily afford to wait for one or two confirming candles, M5, before pulling the trigger.

With that said, I agree with you 100% that an EA is the only way to get the full benefit of this system/indi.  Following the system keeps you in back to back trades at all times, 24/5.  Physically impossible for one human to manually trade.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Fantastic work aicccia on this indicator...

Concur.. An EA is required for most effective use.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Hope there will be more new updates avaliable...thanks to OP for your great effort and nice sharing.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
please come back aiccia

--- 帖子 #233 ---
I updated the alert EA and this time it should give the alerts correctly. The problem with the indicator was that it repaints a little, so I just "remember" the last trading mode (buy or sell) and whenever that changes it triggers the alert.

Again, this EA does NOT trade, it should only pop up the alert when trade direction is recommended to change.

I attach the image with successful recent alert, the EA and the version of the indicator it works with.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Since I last posted, I've gone through versions 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, and 2.8 on my way to v3.00.

Since it's been a while, I decided to show where I've gotten so far so people can see where I'm going so I'll be putting up 2.8 in less than an hour.

While the influences of 2.00 will be definitely in seen in 2.8, it's definitely another generation of indicator and I'll be looking for the people here to look at it and give their thoughts on what is bloat and what works.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Carmen seems to have re-pain or refresh problem?

Look I'm loading now absolutely the same template on the different

broker and some screens got just different views.. Same pairs I mean..

This is strange on 1 account you think it's a sell, while on the other

it's more like a buy?

Check these screen shots Same pair/ Same time frame

Maybe it's just a glitch, cause mostly screens look the same..

I like Indy though now playing in Real account. EA_ALERT for some reason also got settings for the Carmen indy inside.

Why? I don't get it, since Indy already set all it needs just a Alarm when lines are crossing one or the other direction

Just need Alarm option in the Indy itself "true" "false"

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Just posted 2.8 on the front page. The code has been completely re-written, and re-painting does not happen anymore.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Loaded the indicator into my indicators folder, but it doesn't load up on to the charts like previous versions.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Same here.  It does such a good job not re-painting, that it doesn't even show up on the chart.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
i downloaded the indi and it looks like this

--- 帖子 #240 ---
aicccia,

looks the same on my screen.

Have two red and blue and a yellow line now.

The blue and red seems to be mirrored bout the yellow line ??

Can you explain how it works now... ?

--- 帖子 #241 ---
It's all on the first post. Look at the picture.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Is this correct?

Upper Channel

When the 3EMA crosses above the upper blue line, you buy.

When the 3EMA falls below the upper red line, you close you buy and open a sell.

Lower Channel

When the 3EMA falls below the lower blue line, sell.

When the 3EMA then rises above the red line, you close the sell and open a buy.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
I had no problems with any of the previous versions.  Can't figure out why I can't get this one to show up on the chart.  I use a 4 digit broker.......

thx,

try re-downloading it

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Todd, I could not get it to show on M1, but fine on all other TFs.

Also, perhaps try right-click on it in the list of Custom Indicators,

and then "Modify"...and then right-click in upper area that appears,

and click "Compile".

Jaula...

I have been using the v2.01 set on default and have seen that it is applicable to all TF's...

Also, using it this way I've used it for re-entry into market after an intial cross of Carmen...only taking Longs above or Shorts below and then using PA to dictate how long I my hold the position...

Stop Loss is between 20-30 pips depending on the TF...

Seems to be great on the 5m for scalping this way...

Have included a screen shot of how I am using this on my live account...

Today so far, +44 pips...

Hope this helps those looking to work with this indy...

Trade well...

Cliff

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Yeah some of the pairs like EU is in uptrend, so

cannot see lower bands at all, barely see Middle Yellow line

around 1.47/EURO area. Too far back and away from action

And that's 1H TF you'll see none of it on any faster TF. ?

--- 帖子 #252 ---
If you change the base period to a lower period, then it brings both channels much closer to the base line (yellow line).

--- 帖子 #253 ---
So your entries are at the carmen cross and for re entry's at the stoch OB/OS levels and cross?

Thanks,

revrobwimb

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Ok thanks, I see.. What this 1296 number represents? Hours?

Days?

I set it to 400 now looks better.. What is the reasonable number for 5M TF

you think?

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Okay the high number is high for a specific reason.

If you set it low, then on trends when the price retraces, you'll lose a lot more money than you would with a high base value. You want the channels to be running flat and horizontal when the market is ranging and with a low base value, this won't happen.  Test it and you'll see for yourself what I mean.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
As I wrote you in private already, I loved the atrema indi. This time you just might have nailed it Aicccia, my compliments.

Wendy

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Same findings as with atrema, if used on the 5min avoiding the asian session (for entries) helps staying out of a lot of whipsaws. I'm only checking GBPUSD, for GBPJPY this might not be true.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
I'm still not sure what to trade with..

What settings to rely on?

Cause with one settings it's showing

BUY now and with little different settings those lines are far away or

showing SELL. So, not sure which settings to believe. Is that really "SELL"

Signal? or Maybe BUY? I think I'll stick with v2.01 for now.. At least

there is not a such big spreads with different settings... Just IMHO.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Hey Rev...

Yep...but mostly for CT trades like the screenshots below show...

If it doesn't snap in my direction then I kill the trade...

I give more latitude to trades that are in direction of the Trend as it crosses Carmen or has retraced accordingly...

Hope this helps...

Cliff

--- 帖子 #260 ---
I just got a quick ten pip snap there. I think we should consider trading off the middle yellow line too.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Different settings draw different lines, just as with any indicator, so of course one set of settings may show still show a buy while another set shows a sell.

--- 帖子 #262 ---

hi,

try to save as mq4 file,you can rename it as 'xxx.mq4'

--- 帖子 #266 ---
using the middle line was actually part of my mm with atrema, when the 3ema entered inside the red bands I entered wth 2 lots, closing one when the middle line was reached and letting the other one go as by aicccia's instructions. It also means doubling your losses and in the long run did not proove to be profitable. Plus, if you start a trade at the middle line you get heaps of whipsaws. This system has potential but the most suiting MM has yet to be found. i'm glad this time around there seems to be more interest.

Lot's of pips to all,

Wendy

I'm liking this version much more then the previous ones.  The losses are being kept much smaller the before.  The problem again is that watching the chart 24hrs a day is impossible.

Any update on a possible EA for this new version?

thx,

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Hi .. Not sure if the rules for the new version is posted here (other than 1 guy putting a few rules in one of the post).

Please if someone can post the rules.. when to buy and sell with the new ver 2.8

Thanks

--- 帖子 #270 ---
I'm sure someone will correct me if i'm wrong.  But the way I use the bands are:

White line closes above the lower channel red line after having been below the blue line, I go long.

If the white line suddenly turns and closes back below the lower blue line, I go short.

If the white line crosses the lower red line to go long and continues up past the upper channel lines and then closes back below the upper red, I go short.  And if the short turns on me and the white line again closes back above the upper blue line, I go long.

Well is that wasn't a mouth full.

Anyway that's my way of using the channels.

thx,

todd

Yes, that is exactly the way I am testing it

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Yes, it's supposed to be that way. The atr is set with a period of 1000. That never changes, so I just need to load it once.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
maybe in a week. I'm working on v2.9 and v3.00 first.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
yes that is correct.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
descriptions, rules for the system and latest files will always be on the first post.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
aicccia,

I don't know about anyone else, but I'm still seeing the V 2.01 rules on the first page. The V 2.08 download is there but not the updated entry/exit rules.

I know you are very busy, must have slipped through the cracks.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
I'm glad it's not just me.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Impressive indicator. But I want to ask, just loaded it on GU 1M with default settings, and seems like its getting absolutely killed ... am I missing something?

--- 帖子 #279 ---
looks Fine on USD/Chf but, on eur/usd the indicator is very spiky (default settings) 1m tf

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Hi

I dont know if you miss something. But for me looking at cable today on a 15

mins chart, its look absolute ugly. Cable have been ranging in a channel of about 70 pip the whole day.

And all indicator I have seen around the past years is best when we are in trending marked.

And for me cable have not been trending today, so that could be the reason you find it difficult to find an honest trade.

For me, I always look at some higher timeframes to get a feeling for the marked

and try to find the best one. (trending)

If you put carmen V 2,8 on 15 mins GU you can see it ranging between yellow line and upper red line almost whole day.

I dont know if it give any meaning to you, and excuse my English I am better in Danish

--- 帖子 #281 ---
1min. TF, red line on lower channel has been crossed...

--- 帖子 #282 ---
I am sure that most traders on this thread are probably not using this version given that more advanced ones have been created.

However my early results so far, indicate that once price closes above/below carmen lines, it will retrace to the closest carmen line in most cases offering a good opportunity for entering into a trade.

Does anyone have any experience trading with this version?

Cheers

Ezzy

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Thanks Aicccia for this interesting indicator!

I'm still figuring out and tweaking the settings to reduce the number of failed trades, as the default settings for GBPUSD don't seem to be working too well for me. The small stop outs keep on piling up and eats away the huge profits won during good trends.

Anyway since everyone's putting in their 2 cents, here's my take on what the rules for v2.8 might be:

If WhiteLine crosses UP past TOP BLUE line,

Close all SELLS,

Create a BUY (only if none exist)

If WhiteLine crosses DOWN past TOP RED line,

Close all BUYS,

Create a SELL (only if none exist)

If WhiteLine crosses UP past BOTTOM RED line,

Close all SELLS,

Create a BUY (only if none exist)

If WhiteLine crosses DOWN past BOTTOM BLUE line,

Close all BUYS,

Create a SELL (only if none exist)

--- 帖子 #284 ---
I was thinking If white crosses (lower) red (going short) we are going short until it hits the same level , if the white line goes below lower blue than we wait the line to hit the blue again and we reverse the order.

I don't know if should use a yellow MA to reverse trade also or no?

Sorry for mistakes English is not my 1st language

--- 帖子 #285 ---
no actually the rules are the same...

--- 帖子 #286 ---
1. It's not getting killed, that is the one-minute chart and though all of those trades were losers, you never lost more than 6-10 pips, including spread on each trade trades. And since when the system finds a good trend it can easily make 100-200 pips, this is acceptable. The system is not built to make a killing constantly, the goal of the system is to simply to breakeven or keep loses small on ranging markets and then make all the money on trends.

2. The default settings are not from the genetic optimizer, they are simply estimates from me.

3. I am working on some code that would eliminate the problem where the 3 EMA only briefly crosses through the channels before retracing back. This code would elimate the whiplashing in your picture. This new code will be in v2.90.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
The default settings were estimates for the GBP/USD 1 Minute chart only.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
The default settings are only for GBP/USD 1 Minute Chart.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Yes that is correct, that is how it works.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
aiccia,

I believe your latest post continues to illustrate your resolve to take this brilliant concept to its zenith which will basically give all traders exactly what they wish - large trends with few and minimal losses! It has all the makings of being as close to the HG as is humanly possible. thanks once again for your continued dedication to this terrific thread.

Long still looks good...

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Closed Long, now short eurusd...

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Getting a bit choppy...closed short, now going long.

The idea is to accept small losses, and hope for a big trend.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Now the lower blue line has been crossed from above, signalling short. With average losses of 15-30 pips,  smalll losses are turning into a big loss!

Perhaps the setting for this indicator for eurusd need to be changed. Not sure what is best setting for this indicator to minimize the losses.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
I am currently not trading this version since it does not conform to my style of trading but am watching it very closely to evaluate it as a potential EA. Based on observation I believe it would make a dynamite EA. I am watching it on a 15 min timeframe with 75 - 40 -20 settings. I am not watching price at all only the MA as it moves back and forth. I have had no success with the alert that was written by a member. It worked for me once and that was it. I am sure that the 2.8 version is a great improvement over 2.1 and will probably do a comparison this weekend when the market closes but right now I am extremely happy with 2.1 as the basis for an EA. Aicccia has done a brilliant job with this indicator. With a working EA it is as close to the famed "Holy Grail" as I have ever seen. As a system to manually trade however it would be a lot like watching grass grow.

Hopefully Aicccia will develop that EA and share it with us as he has with his indicator.

I have read several post since writing this reply and see that someone else thinks an EA on this system will be close to the "HG". I also neglected to state that my observations of it's effectiveness are based on the EUR/USD  which is what I primarily trade.

I also believe we owe Aicccia both our thanks and admiration for developing and sharing this concept.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
I have been testing on GJ 5min since yesterday, so far one long closed +100 and short entered which is still open, floating +75

--- 帖子 #297 ---
My favourite v2.1 as well. Never seen anything so simple and effective. Hope an EA developed for it.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Using version 2.1. 75-40-20 are the expansion settings on the indicator. I can't remember if they are the default or whether I changed them in the code. I'm not a coder but I can change numbers .

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Thanks...I am changing to V2.1 as well...using it now on 15min. looks much better...can't handle the wipsaw on 1min. using v2.8

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Thanks for sharing!I will test it for sure!

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Started to develop an EA but the problem with v2.1 is that it repaints. So results were not as should have been...

As per acccia, v 2.8 does not repaint... but I haven't tried the EA code with that version.. Will try that over the weekend.. But i am NOT seeing a good response for v 2.8 (as per comments by some people here).

--- 帖子 #302 ---
so far so good.

Started Carmen 4 days ago on GU, GJ and EJ. had traded about

14 trades on demo acct, 2 losing trades so far but overall profitable.

tp set at 30pips.

i'm using the 2.1 version with the original alert EA. works well for me

at the moment. 1.1 EA is creating lots of messages almost every fractions of a second on the expert log. i cannot refer to which pair is alerted for

action, as it scrolls so fast that i have to replace with the original.

will do more demo somehow....

will spend some time to try ver 2.8. any alert EA as well?

thank you for sharing this system.

happy trading

cheers

--- 帖子 #303 ---
I like the new version more in ranging market most of the trades are 5-8 pips profitable (- spread) iif you use all lines as reverse points.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
If you want to optimize your results on your EA, you might consider using a pyramid system to add to your positions when the market is trending.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Hi Jolly

Totally agree with you. An EA for this version would be fabulous!! I hope someone can develop one http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif  I am trading it on demo on a few pairs and so far my results are good. In addition to Carmen, I use pivots for TP and to help me decide in entries and I trade from London open.

Also a big thanks to Aiccia for sharing.....very good indi.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Well I do have to say that this is the best indicator for my trading style..5 min chart, I have always been a quick hit trader.  the results shown are short term trades, either closed manually or i set the trailing stop (115) on my 5 digit broker.   So you can hit and run because there is another trade around the corner.

Thanks and safe trades to all

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Looks like the rooster system. maybe you posted in the wrong thread?

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Seems a little quite here atm.

Hoping for Carmen's eyes to offer some trading opportunities in the next couple of hours.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Hope aiccia doesn't mind me posting charts of Carmen.

Here is one nice trade on the 15 AU, price broke through Carmen and retraced back.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
I've tried saving the newest version of the indicator but for some reason it is not letting me save it in the mt4 or ex4 version, instead it is making me save it in the php version.  Does anyone know how to fix this?  Thanks in advance.

Hi FXtrial !

Very, very impressive ! I can't believe what i see...all your operations are positive. What can i say, you have talent !

I want to ask you, could you please put your indicatores and your template? And explain the moments "entry - exit".

Thank you

Best regards

--- 帖子 #321 ---
I don't think the thread has died. I think aicccia who is in the Navy has had extended duty or something similar and that we will hear from him when he gets time to work on the system etc. Right now he is probably busy.

At least I hope that my sirmise is correct since I feel that he is onto something that will eventually make a dynamite EA if it can be coded.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
" make a dynamite EA if it can be coded."

Anything can be coded. Yes, indicator is great! I personally prefer

v2.01.

EA is simply necessary, because it's impossible to keep 6-10 pairs

under radar, while situation changes so quickly. Definitely need a robot.

Maybe other experienced coder can help us to create EA while

aicccia is busy?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
[quote=SkyzerFX;3249932]" make a dynamite EA if it can be coded."

Yes, I prefer v2.01 also.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Yep, v2.01 here too.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
I'm working on the EA. v2.01 is much weaker fundamentally than v2.5. If once trade changes in 2.01, then all the trades after it change. However in 2.5, the effect of presiding trades is much less.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
but you EA is based on V2.8 ??

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Yea of course, EA is based on latest version.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
I am testing v2.8, too ...( 1min TF )

What do you think about more tweaking of minDiviations and space ?

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Can you post 2.5 so we can demo it? I really like 2.1 and if 2.5 is better I would like to experiment with that also. For some reason I can't seem to fall in love with 2.8. Thanks.

I think you are working on a terrific concept and very much appreciate your sharing of your efforts.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Hi aicccia,

entries are good and working fine...

make it sense to change minDiviations and space to avoid some choppy action ?

And: We should some of a TP or TS action for exit....

At the moment I am testing things like TS 11pips ( or 111 on 5digit broker ) or i-high-low indicator after x pips in profit...............

What would you use for the EA ?

Regards

Chievo

--- 帖子 #331 ---
+ 1 Let us look on v2.5 please, - thanks

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Hi aicccia,

works good, little tweaking in channel width perhaps.....

What exit strategy do you use for runs outside the 2 channels ??

It seems that makes the big pips......

Regards

Chievo

--- 帖子 #333 ---
The EA for the CARMEN indicator v2.8 is almost done. I have only two bugs left to figure out:

Large Period Bug

Indicator Loading Bug

I've been making EAs for the last 4 years but for some reason this last build has been confounding me. If anyone has any ideas or advice about the above two bugs, let me hear it.

The second bug is not a show stopper, it merely makes optimizing very slow, however I would really like to figure out a good solution to the first bug.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
The greater the width between the price and the base line, i.e the greater the run, the closer the channel will follow the price.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
lol "2.5" was a typo. The lastest and best is 2.8.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
A TP with customizable TP and customizable lot % will be added to the EA.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
i mean more the diff between red and blue line...

--- 帖子 #338 ---
I thonk more about a dynamic TS  ......

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Hi aicccia, just wondering what markets you trade and which time frames?

--- 帖子 #340 ---
I'm not a programmer in Meta Quotes, but look at the code could this

be the problem?

Actually your PRINT function prints value of MA 1200

====================

extern int baseperiod=1200;

Print("MA: "+iMA(NULL,TF,baseperiod,0,MODE_EMA,PRICE_CLOSE,1));

====================

And that Value should be and would be higher than (1296 EMA),

cause 1296 EMA theoretically should be lower than 1200 EMA

Maybe I'm mistaken..

--- 帖子 #341 ---
No the difference is bigger than that.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
@aicccia:

Do you only use TP for EA ?

Or more an dynamic TS thing ??

--- 帖子 #343 ---
I've created work-arounds for each bug so I'm getting the results I've been expecting now.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Great! Thanks. Waiting for that EA..

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Hi guys!

I'm not a "EA kind of guy", but this system caught my attention. Looking forward to test the Carmen EA.

Nice work, it seams that Carmen has lots of potential, she's hot!

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Hi aicccia,

do you have any schedule for EA release ??

--- 帖子 #347 ---
V2.8

After analysing v2.8 in more depth I can say it is a more complete indicator than v2.1 (which is also good, but I feel 2.8 is on another level) so I've decided to put that on all my charts and am really happy with it.

Pairs and time frame

I prefer to trade it on the XXX/JPY and AUD/XXX pairs as they tend to be trending more and are less prone to be locked in a range, but be selective trade the pairs with more volume such as AUD/USD and avoid GBP/AUD because it's too volatile. EUR/GBP is also a good pair.

I use it on the 1 hour time frame and it seems to work well on it.

Anyway, that's how I've been using the indicator.

The thread is getting far too quite.

Share your thoughts, ideas, personal experiences, set ups or whatever you think is productive.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
I've been following eurusd 15min., using V2.8, with default settings....looks very promising.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Bought @ 1.4898

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Hey, I know I've been pretty quiet recently but its only because I've been working really hard on the indicator and EA. I'm releasing a new version of the indicator now so I can get more feedback and you guys can see what I've been working on.

After a lot of testing, I've decided to backtrack and the latest version much more resembles the earlier versions of the indicator. Many people prefered the earlier versions and while I liked their simplicity too, I felt that I had a worthwhile strategy for fighting the ranging, and it's what was in v2.8.

However the Achilles heel of v2.8 was that ranging was only successfully controlled as long as the ranging occurred near the base line trend; and ranging happens anywhere and everywhere.

So I went back to an earlier version and instead of "prevention", I decided to try a policy of allowing all trades and using the opportunity to grab pips and close portions of the order, in order to breakeven or sometimes even more during these ranging markets.

So in this latest version(which is very similar to the first for those who have been following along) there are two extra Take Profit lines that follow the price at user-defined distances and these distances can  be set to change at three different user-defined levels of profit.

The indicator can be grabbed from the first post. And I recommend the one-minute timeframe as usual. The lines will plot the same on each timeframe, so the lowest timeframe will give the earliest entries and exists.

Where the two take profit lines snap back to the blue and yellow channel, this is where some of the profit was be taken.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Thanks. Let me be first to congratulates you on the new version. Looks great on GU.

Do you have any recommended settings for GJ and EJ as well?

Hi aicccia,

The two trailing lines are not showing up! Any idea?

The 2 lines are showing on my chart....just took 30 pips profit  and will ride the rest with sl @ BE

Thanks aicca....

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Carmen 3 on EJ 1 min with default settings

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Where are the 2 take profit lines?

--- 帖子 #357 ---
The default is for GU...so am not surprise with any anomalies on other pairs..

--- 帖子 #358 ---
I believe that an EA will do justice to trading carmen. I found out that most of the setups happen when u are not on ur sit or while sleeping...like last night....

I guess thats why an EA to be near perfect needs time to be put together.

Good job aicca

--- 帖子 #359 ---
They disappear once they've been crossed, e.i. when the partial profit would be taken.

Look at the left of your chart, once the white lines dipped below them, they were removed.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
man what are you talking about??

ain't making millions worth staying up all night??

LOL jk. I'm working on it right now.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Will that imply that one should wait for reset (i.e. wait for break of the blue or yellow line) b4 taking any trade? I have noticed that it sometimes retraces back to the blue/yelow line b4 going in the direction it want to go.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
It now makes sense aicccia...many thanks for this indicator.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
yes, always. that is one of the most fundamental rules of the system.

the EA might give the option to resume TP when the price retraces through a single yellow or blue line.

look at the try_again variable in the indicator for an example of what I'm talking about.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Great Indy as usual, thanks.

Is there possibility to disable those 2 extra lines for profit?

maybe set settings 3-4 sets to 0 ?

I'd like to have only 2 lines on the chart Blue and Yellow, cause

I can decide myself  when to take profit..

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Just change lines colour to black.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Yeah I second that regarding the TP lines, sorta confuse me.

But aicccia, hats off to you man. Simplicity is so effective, and you've made something radical here and very effective. Thanks man

--- 帖子 #367 ---
I have to say aicccia your work keeps getting better, v3.1 has the simplicity of the of the earlier versions and the potential is amazing!

Thanks again

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Those TP lines are there to help you protect your money better, like aicccia said, when they touch the blue and yellow channel, you close some of your position, this protects you from when the market is ranging alot and will also allow you to stay in the trend.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Also just thinking how that could happened?

On 1M pair is under both lines and when I switch to 15M

pair is above lines, look:

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Sure thats easy.

Just download the indicator again(I didn't change the name). There's a new extern variable, Display_TakeProfit, just set it to false.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Thanks yeah, still searching for a param to turn them off , which I've found (lots way too small to close out on each touch of the line hehe, on student budget)

Turn the colour parameter of the orange and red to "no colour" if you want them off!

I agree that this version is the best so far!!

--- 帖子 #372 ---
My chart looks a bit different than this.. Are you using the default settings?

--- 帖子 #373 ---
On the 1M you got into the trade quicker, so you reached a higher level of profitability than on the 15M, and the higher the profit, the closer the channels follow the price. At least thats what the default setting do.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Skyzer where did you get your pivots indicator from?

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Thank You Aiccia!

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Perfect, thanks

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Thank you aiccia,

It just keeps getting better and better when you didn't think it could!

The new indicator looks great and captures what you have been talking about from the beginning. I for one, and I think I can speak for others, really, really appreciate all the hard work and tireless effort that you have continued to put into this indicator from the beginning to help so many others trade. Sometimes on the FF threads, some people lose sight of that wonderful quality. thanks once again.

I can't say it any better than TraderDp did. I loved 2.1 but I am really getting my jollies out of 3.1. A straight EA on this would be fabulous.

Hi all, hi aicccia,

just found this indicator and i am amazaed how good it works.

Great work and thanks for sharing it with the community!

I tested this indicator on M1, M5, M15 and it seems to work on all TF

very well.

Nevertheless i have some questions:

1) Which timeframes do you all use usually?

2) If you buy a position, do you take profits after a certain amount of pips or do you let the complete position run until you reverse from Long to Short or Short to Long?

3) Do you switch the position from Long to Short or vice versa after the candle crosses the Blue AND Yellow line or exactle from the moment, the white line crosses these both Lines?

4) Do switch positons exactly in the moment, the white line indicates to, or do you wait until the candle is finished?

Best regards

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Hi aicccia,

Thanks for sharing the great indi. Just wondering if you can add sound alert on the indi? Until someone (most likely yourself) create the EA, this sound will be a good assistant so we don't have to watch the monitor all the time. Thanks

Hi all,

I will like to suggest that when anyone see a set up, it shld be posted. This will keep this thread much more active, it will also give you the opportunity for someone else to analyse ur trade and finally, it will help newbies get a good hang of the system. Its always easy to look hindsight and see great setup...but remember, hindsight cant pay the bill.

A classical example was someone showing the long on GU on Fri as it happened. I was not looking at GU, but when the person mentioned it, I chked my GU and I was able to get it close to the breakout.

This will help keep the thread much more alive until the EA is finally released.

What do you all think about this idea???

You have to read post #1 at least

Recommended TF is 1min for earlier and accurate entry

that's why your other questions do not apply in 1m TF.

Also that's why many of us do not open their own thread, because

it's like: give me a food, give me a spoon, give me a bread.

Aicccia, give us many great Indicator, which he spends many working hours

on, all you have to do download it and READ few pages of this thread,

before you post, because most of the questions already answered on page

#1

Period.

Skyzer,

thank you for your reply to my post.

I read until page 11, but i couldnt figur out the question when to enter

- directly by crossing or

- after candle close

this is what the first post tells me:

"Then when the white lines rises back above the yellow and blue lines, close the sell and BUY again."

nothing mentioned about the entry by waiting till the candle has finished so i guess we enter directly?

I always try to figur out the key points until i ask a question so sorry if i maybe overread this point. Nevertheless it would be nice if you can give me an answer to my question(s)

Question 1-3 are more generally asked, so i wanted to hear what other users use for taking profits. And the question about the timefrage is the same, i know it is a M1 TF setup but maybe other users use this system on other TF, too?

--- 帖子 #399 ---
its cool. wait for the candle to close. that's how to know that the cross is real.

and you always want to read the first post, especially after a new version comes out because I may change wording to reflect tweaks in the system's rules.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Aicccia,

Just completed reading the thread. Interesting and will wait patiently for the EA. Your great work will allow optimization of the settings for the different pairs/TFs that Carmen can certainly address.

Kostas.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Looks interesting, will give it a shot on Monday.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Me too, I did some visual backtesting this weekend, I'm very pleased with how it looks. It seams I have a date with Carmen Monday morning.

--- 帖子 #403 ---

You have to be a "Roger Federer"  to cleanly close the trade near the

upper

or lower line and immediately place appositive one. I've been trying and it's like

"Off quotes", "Off quotes" Error messages, because there is lots of action

on 1MIN TF and then, when you finally did placed your order, it could be

already

too late. And you'll need actually close 1 order first and open another one

on the fly.. Not easy task, especially if you playing with 4-5

pairs..

EA can help a lot to place those orders faster. IMHO

I have manually backtested GBPUSD for the last week using v3.10 (standard settings). I assumed opening two 0.5 lots at each signal and closed one when price crossed the first additional TP line and the other (or both) when it crossed blue and yellow line as the original strategy suggests. Here are my results:

Asian session: -5 pips

Asian/Sydney session: +72 pips

London session: +262 pips

London/NY session: -88 pips

NY session: +74 pips
Total: +315 pips

Session indicates when trades were closing. However, it doesn't consider the spread. With more than 50 entries and a spread of 3 pips for GBPUSD, it kind of eats up profit very fast. Am I doing the right thing? Thanks

Chamane

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Price crossed the lines, or you waited for the lines to collapse back to the channel? So you see the vertical drop back to the channel, which indicates profit be taken.

Also insead of opening two 0.5s, open 1 standard lot then close half of it per level, that way pay half the spread?

--- 帖子 #406 ---
White line crossed the take profit red line and price is closing. That's when I exited.

How do you close 1/2 lot in MT4 without adding spread?

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Here are my results for two weeks ago on GBPUSD 1min v3.10 standard settings:

Sydney session: -10 pips

Asian/Sydney session: -29 pips

Asian session: -26 pips

London session: +51 pips

London/NY session: +71 pips

NY session: +30 pips
Total: +87 pips

Still using 0.5 lot for exiting at the first takeprofit line and 0.5 lot for standard rule. This time I had around 40 entries. With 3 pips for spread, I was not profitable. Please comment as I want to make sure I understand what is going on. Thanks.

Ibuks

I like the idea and I would like to contribute buy informing that on my chart, we have a buy signal on the GU.

Could someone confirm please.

Ezzy

--- 帖子 #409 ---
I had a short at 6:18 (loss) and a long at 6:42 still in course. I am GMT +1 (I use alpari uk).

cheers,

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Small loss in previous buy. Current sell signal is trending well.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
I'm starting to think splitting entries in 3 would not be a bad idea. 1/3 closes at first TS, 1/3 at second TS and last part at yellow and blue line crossover.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Can the EA alert be altered to work with current version 3.1. That would be most helpful.

Geoff

--- 帖子 #413 ---
hello aicccia and everyone else using this great indi.

has anyone try carmen on higher TFs like 1h it seems good to me what do you guys think.aicccia would appriciate your comments and thoughts

regards

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Maybe someone can compile this to .mq5?

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Missed a great sell entry

Woke up in the circle area...was waiting for the white line to re-enter the channel to trigger the next trade, but prices kept falling.

Well, there is always another time.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
there are EA's who do just that, close x% of the total amount of lots after x pips of profits, multi purpose trade manager is one of those, but I have no clue how to program it to take partial profits at the two TS lines. It is possible though, to close orders partially.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Thanks. I found this in the MT4 userguide: "...client terminal allows to close positions partially. To do so, one  has to specify the amount of lots less than that given for the opened position  in the "Volume" field before pressing of the "Close... " button". Will try it.

Also, what's everyone record with this indy? Everybody is is saying how great it is, but I have some doubts from my latest backtesting with spread eating up profits.

Chamane

--- 帖子 #418 ---
I just wrote a very rudimentary alert for Carmen, only when blue line is crossed in above or yellow in below. Sends an email as well. Nothing fancy but works for me.

Wendy

--- 帖子 #419 ---
I just discovered the exact same thing. 2years behind these graphics and i still learn every day. Just never really needed it.

I have not thoroughly backtested carmen but from what I've seen during London and NY it works quite well, I think you'd want to review your opinion. Alpari gives me a 2.8 pip on the GBP, even during ranging times the first trailing stop usually offsets spread.

Wendy

--- 帖子 #420 ---
THANKS!!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #421 ---
You going to be bombarded by messages in range market

--- 帖子 #422 ---
no, only one per cross at the first tick of each candle.

:-)

or at least that's the way it should be.......

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Hi guys,

I do NOT want to turn this thread into an indicator show, as I am sure that would bother Aicccia as well. His whole work is based on simplifying our charts and have an all-in-on indy.

However, I did notice that in conjunction with awesome Oscillator you can filter out most of the bad trades while loosing only very few good ones. What I do is entrying long only when Awesome is near 0 or has only just turned positive and vice versa for short. A lot of the false entries are made when awesome is already at extreme levels. If the entry is a good one, you will more often than not notice a second entry shortly afterwards with the awesome at level 0 or almost.

It is just an idea. Aicccia if this sort of input bothers you just say so and I'll no longer post on this subject. i do not want to hijack your thread or anything.

Wendy

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Bro, funny things going on with that "Indy_alert"

"Carmen alert: Carmen top Cross"

"Carmen alert: Carmen bottom Cross"

Ha-ha, now go figure, I have 8 pairs on the screen and which one

is actually crossing???

I'll look into source code and see, if I can also pass that Pair name

variable into that message..

BTW, Newest Indy does have Profit lines show false/true..

So, next time please download it from the 1st page latest version and then

Edit.. Thank you.

P.S

OK, I edit that code here: now it should display Pair name

=============================================

if (newbaropen ){

if (averagefx[i] > top[i] && averagefx[i+1] < top[i+1]&& AlertBoxOn   )

{

SendMail(AlertPrefix,Hour()+":"+Minute()+"3Ema crosses UP CarmenTop");

Alert("CARMEN ALERT:" + Symbol()+" BUY Line Crossed ");

}

if (averagefx[i] < bottom[i] && averagefx[i+1] > bottom[i+1]&& AlertBoxOn   )

{

SendMail(AlertPrefix,Hour()+":"+Minute()+"3Ema crosses DOWN CarmenBottom");

Alert("CARMEN ALERT:" + Symbol()+" SELL Line Crossed ");

}

}

i--; }

===========================

Hello Carmen.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
8Pairs?? I'm only using it on GBP as recommended, that's why I did not include the Symbol() but you're right, it is completer this way.

May I ask which pairs you are trading? Settings?

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Sure  Settings I posted here:

Pairs? All popular:

EURUSD

EURJPY

NZDUSD

USDJPY

AUDUSD

USDCHF

GBPUSD

But still playing on Test account so far

Personally I never trade 5-30m time frames.. I prefer

H4-Daily that's what I trade on Real Account

1M-30M it's like stocks day-trading or Casino BlackJack game for me.

I think 99% of the people lose money trading that way eventually.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Got the buy signal...long @1.6450

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Hi,

Do u use carmen on 4HR TF as well??.... What settings do u use for the 4HR - Daily TF so that the lines are not thinned out...

I miss most of today's action...whaooo....reall action for a monday.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #430 ---
That shld be a buy on EURJPY...but will this time of the day favour the move...??...we shall see..

--- 帖子 #431 ---
I'm experimenting with lot's of stuff now, Renko charts, different

brick sizes... So far don't have a clear answer what is the best..

I'll let you guys know.. Just need more time..

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Exited @1.6438.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
I tried renko myself with 10pip  bricks. 4h and daily are great for j16 trading but My account is too small to afford the SL required. I am trading a mix of ichimoku and bat at 15min charts and that is going quite well.

Now I am giving Carmen a shot when possible.

We'll see.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
SL should be way smaller that 12? Mine is like 6+spread so 9

--- 帖子 #435 ---
What maximum size SL would you recommend on a 5 min chart?

--- 帖子 #436 ---
My broker is giving me a 5pips spread to trade this pair, so 9 pips SL is very tight. At this moment, prices are very choppy...got a sell signal a moment ago (stopped out -12pips again), and now the last signal is a buy @ 1.6446.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
That is a disgusting chop zone! Stay out for a while

And a broke giving spreads of 5 on GU is horrible...who are you with?

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Only look at m1 sorry, the concept doesn't fit for me on anything above

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Well, the idea for Carmen is to handle choppy zone as much as catching a good trend...so I will take every signal it gives me, as long as I have my eyes hooked to the monitor:-)

Unfortunately, this is a only forex broker availabe for us in Chile (it is called forexchile)...I am thinking to go with alpari UK, or fxdd, in the near future...any recommendation?

--- 帖子 #440 ---
I see, I think alpari are good for spreads and things. FXDD quite high still. ODL are good.

What time did you start taking all the trades? What has performance been like

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Also like Oanda...they are the lowest in spread, I heard.

I caught a good trade last Friday which gave me 70 pips. And on Monday, early morning, so far two loosing trades with -12pips each, and the last one is a buy which still is open.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Ok...the last buy signal also got stopped out at -17pips. I will stay out, until mid-london/openning NY session.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Hello Carmen.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
I got stopped out.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
I am in this one again.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Hi

please forgive me if I ask a silly question (it is 02:00 in London and it has been a long day). I just read through the postings and have one question. Is carmens_eyes_v3.1 Al..mq4 the only indicator needed for this system or do we need more indicators. I just could not find it in the thread.

thanks very much

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Carmen E/U 1h looks to be giving a long signal, can't post atm, but signal seems to be off DP.

Will try post later.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Hi Sky

I prefer longer tf also, I am terrible selecting the right trades on short tfs. If it does not distract from the objective of this thread, I would like to discuss longer tfs a little more.

Hope this is OK with you aicccia.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
you should be recovering.......wasn't too bad.

I got bitten yesterday by the gbpjpy, was trading another system, news coming on but nothing too important.....got in on a 1h chart basis, it went 150 pips against me, took my SL out and then came all the way back...........

ouch. 3%less in my account.

today has been better.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Yep recovering and up a few pips, my tp is yesterdays high at 6592.

I hate news http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon8.gif I don't know how to trade it and I tend to forget to check the calendar an various occasions when I am trading.

wvehoven, are you trading the smaller tf on this sytem? if so, how are you going with it.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Thank goodness it didn't take my sl, because it was below the weekly pivot. It has hurt me on many occasions though. http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon9.gif

--- 帖子 #456 ---
I am trading it on a 1min TF as stated by aicccia, using awesome as a secondary guideline and only entering between 6-11GMT and then between 14:30-15:30 gmt, it is doing ok, in profit so far. When I see too much ranging and awesome not moving too far away from 0 I tend to trade the real breakout though, giving up on a few pips but avoiding false entries. Most entries in this time period are ok.  Also, i turned on the try again option. I enter with 3 (micro)lots, closing one at each TS and one at the crossover of blue and yellow line. If however I am short, it crosses the yellow line and recrosses it down without ever crossing the blue line, I reenter with the amount of lots closed previously at the various TS.....working like a charm.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Very nice!!!

I find trading smaller tf very difficult.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
this does not bother me at all, and in fact collaberation was one of the reasons I posted this indicator in the first place.

I took a look at the Awesome indicator and its plain that I eneed to make the indicator account for trending and ranging conditions better.

The idea I have is to make the width between the channel fluctuate, so that a trending market would make the width small and a ranging market would make the width large. This would reduce false crosses but when a false cross still managed to cross, the loss would be much larger, maybe around 30 pips. So for that reason I'm a bit wary of going that route, but its all I've got right now.

Does anyone have any ideas?

wvehoven is right, the indicator needs some sort of filter but I want the filter to be built-in influncing the lines themselves, so that at the end of the day, we're still just trading off the channel.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Just an idea, I am not a programmer and I do not know if it is doable.

I LOVE the BAT ATR, it is some sort of TS just like Carmen, but instead of following price at xpips of distance, it uses ATR of the last x candles multiplied by a factor, optimizable as one chooses. Perhaps carmen as well can follow price based on an atr ratio.

If you can correlate the multiplication factor used to the adx value(which should be increasing while trending and decreasing in a ranging market, you might get what you want.

Hope it makes sense.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Aicccia

I no nothing about coding, and little about indicators in general, so please forgive me for sounding so ignorant.

I would like to make a comment in regards to your your above post. You indicate that the Chanel widens in ranging and the opposite in trending markets and that so far this is the aim of the indi. However, whenever price and line cross the chanel, it is always at the chanels widest. The chanel only narrows after the line crosess and price begins to trend. Therefore in my humble observations, widening the chanel when price is ranging will mean that all entries will have a wider chanel.

Please correct me if I am wrong and I hope nobody takes this post the wrong way. I am very greatful for your work and sharing of this indi.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
it does make sense, thanks for the great tip!

--- 帖子 #462 ---
right now the channel never changes in width. the width seems to changes when its trending because both lines are falling or rising, however its just a sort of optical trick.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Got it, thanks.

I couldnt, too many errors.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Just wondering if the EA will able to do the following:
Place SL as the lower channel if buying or upper channel if selling Close a certain user specified percantage ie 50% of your position and let the remaining percentage to stay in any potential trend

Hi,

Is the new Meta trader out...and is it called MT5??...Just wondering why u want mq5.

Nice day today again on carmen...missed some action..but got into EURJPY and GU earlier today, came back to meet TP on both... I set TP and SL on both trades when I took becos I was not around to monitor it. Nice..but very risky.

Ezzy, I love ur 1hr ...I also use higher TF to set TP and SL....very nice. I also noticed that u called it....hope others got on board.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Yes, google "download metatrader5".

--- 帖子 #470 ---
mlq4 and mlq5 are not as similar as metaquotes would like you to think

--- 帖子 #471 ---
yeah you'll be able to do that

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Yes, feeling is like they want to do everything more difficult.

For example, there is no option to put momentum in main window.

But I dont know.

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Last buy signal is doing very well...I decided instead of using the 2 trailing lines as TP, just use the original aicccia's method as my exit point, i.e., wait for the white line closes above/below the blue/yellow line.

So far, the buy signal still holding. Once again, thanks aiccia for this great indicator.

Would be nice to have an alert indicator to sound an alert when the white line has crossed 5 pips(user selectable) above/below the blue/yellow lines.

p.s. to get this massive pips, I had to stay up all night....extremely tired now! An alert indictaor would be a great add-on.

Also I'd like to add to catch this uptrend, I had 4 whipsaw trades which cost me approx. 12 pips. each!

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Hi Candletrader,

Is this on 4hr TF?...whaooo. All u need per day is one of this kind of trade with massive pips. Congrats. I advice u go and sleep now...lol...with this many pips...u dont need another for today...lol

--- 帖子 #475 ---
I use the 1min. timeframe as originally posted by aicccia. Thanks and good day.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
I have spent the past few days reading up on this Carmen Eyes indicator and testing it (yes, on my live account), and I must say how surprised and pleased I am with it.  The author has done a splendid piece of work, and I really appreciate his sharing it with our forum members.  As the 1 minute chart is a little too rapid-fire for me, I use the Carmen primarily on a 5 minute chart.  And, I have elected to use it in its most basic form: a white line, blue line and yellow line.  It does a great job of helping me decide whether to get in and/or and stay in a trade or not.  As for the indicator settings, I've adopted SkyzerFX's parameters:

Display_TakeProfit=false

What time frame do you use? I prefer using the 5 min tf and 1 hour.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
You guys must be lucky geniuses , but so far I cannot find the way to trade

anything below 1H TF, too much noise, too many fake crosses

back and forth.. Also right now I'm mixing Carmen with different Indies..

Anything below 30M TF is Russian Roulette..

On live account I still using H4 to decide entry and M15 for better entry.

Will report if anything positive happens. I'll figure out something, but need more time.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
I use 1 min (default setings), it was my first trade Using Carmen.

I caught a buy signal this morning around 7.00 am GMT while trading another strategy.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
I start with the 15M, then use long term charts for confirmation, then look for entry on 15M.   I tried pulling the trigger with 1M charts, but can't narrow it down enough to be profitable.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Settings for Carmen's indicator..

--- 帖子 #483 ---
I've had a look at the 4 hour chart and I will consider it, your right about there being too many fake crosses, but that's part of the business, you have to accept a small loss like 10 pips and when the're not losses you could easily make around 100 pips and considering the indicator  will easily bag  you profits 80% of the time.

When it comes to stop losses, I think you have to use them, no matter how discipline you are, you never know, you might lose your control, your still human, with a stop loss you predefine a point where you accept it's not gonna go for you, this way there is much more control. But you've been round longer so I shouldn't be lecturing  you

--- 帖子 #484 ---

The sell signal would have been profitable, nevertheless, looking at the way GBPJPY is rising firmly, I'm waiing to go long. hopefuly for a loooooooooong way hehe.

Did you guys notice how Awesome crossed 0 the second time GBPUSD signalled short? It truely is helping me this indi, not perfect of course, but then again what is......

Short signal, entered. Anyone entering be careful, lots of support beneath.

Will post chart a little later.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
If you can see in my chart, the down move started off yesterdays high and it cross the chanel off daily open (levels of resistance), but there is also a bit of support Daily, weekly and monthly pivots, tight stop loss for me on this one.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Short it is Ezzy....if no bounce off the 6547, next target will be 6450.

I just woke up to initiate a position during london open, and this short looks like a good one. Good night, and happy trade.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
My first TP already hit on the short...am riding the second leg..... first TP was 30, took it from 1.6600 but with lots of caution...no risk, no gain....another accai winner...lol

--- 帖子 #495 ---
GBP is at the 38.2 retracement of yesterday's spectacular climb, be careful.If it breaks it it might go to the 50% but I'm not getting short just yet.

See, on a 1min short this short move would have been profitable no matter what, on a 1hour chart you might get in too late.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Look at the bounce from 6549...which way now??

Its always good to take profit on the way...no matter how small....lol

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Yes, a nice bounce of the support 6547...but short still looks good with stop at 6644. I really need an alert indicator for this.

wvehoven, did you update your alert indicator with the latest source code, and also to include the symbol? Can you please post it again. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
I think the best time to fish for GU trade is btw 6-7GMT....if u can get in on the right side, ur day is made...even b4 any news ...

--- 帖子 #502 ---
No, I hadn't. I only look at the mails and those already had the Symbol in it. But since you asked for it,  here you go. Didn't doublecheck the code but compiles without errors so it should do just fine.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #503 ---
I don't like giving out scheldues because they always get broken.

I want to test the EA for maybe a week before I release it so it might be out in two weeks, maybe a bit more. I know many of you need something that can make trading the system easier so the next indicator version, which should be out in a few days, will have message, sound and email alerts.

The pirority for the next version will be better handling of ranging markets.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Very nice and many thanks.

--- 帖子 #505 ---

I was wondering if you could PM me the indies as well.

Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Yes you can. I am most grateful to you.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Long trade should be holding very well so far.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Could someone please explain how and where to load

all the indicators and things that people attach to the posts.

I would greatly appreciate it.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
download the indi's and put it to your C:/Programms/MetaTrader/Experts/Indicators folder,restart your metatrader and use Insert/Indicators/Custom

Hello everyone,

Just came back to see that carmen is nailing it...irrespective of the trend...just go with carmen and u will be a winner. I now understand why aicca named it carmen.....its like saying it loud..." get into the C A R ..... M E N..... for a ride".... lol lol lol...

I also notice that when u cannot see the blue and yellow lines on the 1 min, go to the 5 mins, a setup may be brewing up there...and up like that unti u get to the 1hr TF. The higher time frame signals are really supper, but u need to take more risk.

Once again, thanks aicca... u are appreciated.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Many, many thanks aicccia for your effort...you have given us a jewel, but without strict discipline and money management, this jewel can turn into fire and burn you. God bless you and your family.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Hi Aiccia,

u are the man. I love to stay invincible in all the thread I have been, but man, u made me come out of my shell. Just like Ezzy, u must not let my wife know I am trading.... but seriously, this creation of urs is a gem. Thanks so much..and thanks in advance for the next version and the EA.

With an Alert and especially email alert, I can go to sleep and chart will start to wake me up alerting me on trades setup...lol very nice.

To all carmen follower, I sincerely wish u well and hope u remember risk management/money management. It is when u have funds that u can trade...so preserve ur funds....dont get liquidated into demo trader forever.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Thanks a lot! Definitely need alert, to speed up testing process

as this way Carmen could be placed on many pairs.

Now just sitting and switching 10 screens 1H TF looking good

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Have been playing with Carmen on the fast forward Simultator.

on M1 M5 she was killing me.. too many crosses and the losses are just too huge... Maybe the EA will tell us something elese in longterm.. I dont know.

Yeah she is looking best on h1 also on the Simultator.

I hope she is doing a better Job than the MA (15) on h1 .. any thoughts on this???

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Yeah, I know, I never have any luck trading short term. In real live I'm trading on H4-Daily

with BANDS and 200 EMA shifter +100 -100 +200 -200.. So generally

Idea is to Buy LOW and SELL High (as far as possibly away from 200 SMA) and TP closer to or at 200 SMA

Just resently closed USDJPY/EURJPY/CHFJPY about 50 positions with 5% account profit..

So it's kind of Long term strategy. Sometimes I'd wait week or more for either take a position or TP

but it always works. Trading? Not sure yet.. It's like a blackjack..

Nobody knows when pair is moving in he short run

--- 帖子 #522 ---
I, like others around here, utilize a variety of time frames.  I use the Daily and H4 to geet a good feel for the long-term trend of a pair.

When I decide which pairs are trending, I then switch to the H1 and M15 to analyze the swings/price action(PA).

For timing my actual BUY or SELL, though, I use the M5, as this let's me see what happening right now.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Just an Example

Trix down Carmen was crossed and then reverse and it's in loss

But this is a TEST account, so I will just sell more higher:

ha-ha  walk out for 15 min and now it's in profit

Never know

--- 帖子 #524 ---
My favorite time frame is the M15.  I've attached a sample here which shows what I personally like one a chart.

Many will not like my color scheme, but it's easier on my eyes than others.

I use four indicators:

- Carmens Eyes v3.1  (for my trading channels)

- Magnified Market Price (for current price and chart type)

- THV3 CandleClock  (to let me know how much time till the next candle)

- ant-GUBreakoout v.0.4.1  (to highlight what happened in the 7-9 AM EST window of time)

That last one is not essential to me, as I am just curious how market conditions were from 7-9 AM.

Oh, and I place a text label in the upper-left corner of each template so I can remember which template I used later (smile).

Cheers,

Ed

--- 帖子 #525 ---
This sounds pretty interresting.. so you are using some kind of basket trading I think.. is there any link to this?

Cheers

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Did the simulator took ALL signals? Day and night? I ask because i made the experience, that Carmen works well during London open undtil mid of NY session, so maybe you can filter this a little bit and post the results again :-)

cheers

--- 帖子 #527 ---
hi yes i took all, cant see any edge of not trading carmen 5 hours before london open.. but try it...

here is the Metatrader Simulator

Ok took 5 trades all wins!! 0.40 lot about $600 fake money made

I wish it was that easy on Real account as well

Showing few screen shots:

--- 帖子 #529 ---
hey pauly,

i live in germany, and my oberservations are that durig the night there is not much price action causing ranging markets with some false signals, so i am

trading it only after 6am gmt

--- 帖子 #530 ---
ich weiß   but scrolling back gbpusd.. u will eleminate some losses and some winners too

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Maybe I just can't see it, but where did you Enter and Exit these trades ??  Did you mark the Enter/Exit points ??

--- 帖子 #532 ---
ah, another german

so just my observations only i see the most action is coming with europe open so i trade carmen there only

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Hi.  I see you're using Swingman's Super Ultra Trix indicator.  How's that working for you and how's Swingman doing these days?  I've been a big fan of his for a long while.

Cheers!

--- 帖子 #534 ---
v1 runs fine for me, but v3.1 is crashing my MT4 platform.  Is any one else having the same trouble?

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Pink line that's 24 EMA If TRIX turn into SELL signal I'm looking pair

to be either below 24 EMA line or below Carmen or better below both (and vise versa for BUY).

Swing Man Trix working fine but again no body knows when the real

TREND starts or it's just a next Fake signal? I think the only

way to play this just double lot sizes.  0.20 wrong signal? ok SL,

0.40 wrong signal? SL 0.80 real signal take profit. As far as I can see

there is no way could be like 3-4-5 fake signals in the row..

Same goes for Carmen. Surely you'll need to play with lot sizes to

offset fake cross loses..

Even like 0.20-0.40-0.60-0.80-1.00 or 0.40-0.50-0.60-0.70-0.80 and so on lots (depends on your account

size) will do the job , especially

in EA trading.. Every loss pump up your lot.. Noway there could be like

5-6 straight loses in the row at least in higher TF like 1H

I'm sure it make sense

--- 帖子 #536 ---
looks interesting but unsure;

im seeing lots of false signals?

what settings do people use for 4/1hr gbpusd?

does it redraw/paint?

--- 帖子 #537 ---
I really like this indi!!!

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Hi

Same here crashed IBFX as well as ACM.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Aicccia,

Just wanted to drop you a note to say thank you again for all your hard work in developing this indicator.  What I like about your system/method is that one doesn't need to adulterate one's charts with loads of indicators, thus freeing the trader to focus on pure price action pattern, which I believe is just as important as money management.

What I've noticed is your version (with original settings) shows how 20:34 and 22:02 (GBP/USD 1-MIN) stopped right at the upper band of carmen before reversing telling us we have more upside potential.

This indicator has helped me stay in the trend & correct my overtrading tendencies and as such, I have paid WAY LESS in spreads/commissions.  My first thoughts during initial testing 3.1 was that this must be how the Big Boys (institutional) trade

Well done!

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Hi all,

Its dat time of the day tostart looking for trades...but i guess am late to start up today. GU 1min seems to have taken off without me even up to 15min tf.... but looking at 15min EJ with a little more risk, it seems to be worth the buy if there is still more room to go on the upside.

R1 has been cleared, will it get to R2, R3 ?....Knowing EJ, R2 shld be easy barring any news. I will take a risk of buying EJ @ 56-60 with sl below my R1 (which coincide with the orange profit line).

Anyone got into the GU??...too late for me

--- 帖子 #542 ---
alert function  changed, tested new version with simulator.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Looking at the pretty lady (carmen) today on my few pairs, there does not appear to be any potential trades. Is anyone seeing any different?...please share.

Walb, I'll try that alert, many thanks.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Maybe its just me...but ur chat is just too complicated.

Trading shld not be that difficult...just me anyway.

Anything too complicated, I get confused. Thats why carmen suit me.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Price is about to cross the channel on the down side on the 15 min tf and the 1hr is not too far behind.

Just like yesterday, I would suggest caution on signals going south. If anyone has a difference of opinion please share.

Cheers to all.

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Hello Everyone,

For everyone who is using Carmen, are you guys using the original settings?

What about for larger time frames like the 15m 30m 1hr etc, are you guys still using the same settings?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Yea Ezzy,

The GU actually crossed down on the 1min, good for about 20 pips but bounced back and its crossing down again.

I think this is where caution need to be applied and I belief this is where the EA will be of great assistance...taking out emotion...

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Hi Mannai,

I am using the default settings for all the tf I look at with good result.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Thanks Ibuks,

Has anyone been looking at pairs other than G/U with good results with the original settings?

I was just viewing the E/U with the original settings on the V3.01 and it seems to work nicely.

Any thoughts?

Thanks

Mannai

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Is anyone watching GU 1 min?? It is just chopping around...up, down, up down... anyone watching. 1 Hr is still above the blue line, same as 15min. 5 min broke to the down side but its back in the carmen again....

It will definately go either way...but we must be careful...

Any comment??

--- 帖子 #551 ---
I have turned into 5min. to lessen the number whipsaw, and currently short at 1.6643.

1.6624 is a strong pivot level.  Prices can get very choppy around this level.

Awaiting aicccia's next version to test it again in 1min TF.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Short still looks good...let's see 1.6624 pivot level can be broken soon.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
I would like to say thank you to aicccia.

v3.1 is amazing

I am looking at it in 5m tf.

and it is really good.

sincerly i don't understand many things around here, only watching at it I can find very good entry and exit point, what else is needed?

I think that an EA based on this version, with just two take profit based on the new two lines would be perfect.

easy and perfect

once obtained we could start with setting optimization.

thanks again aicccia

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Many thanks to walb99.  His version works great when the version from the 1st posts crashes  my system.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Is this copied into the indicators or experts folder?

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Thanks walb99....appreciate it very much.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
In the indicator folder.

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Can the alert text a cell phone ?

--- 帖子 #559 ---
E.G. You can put your mailbox-settings to send you SMS when eMail from MT4 arrives.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Every time I load this indy it just starts dinging and won't stop. The only way I can make it stop is by shutting down my MT4 platform. It won't even stop dinging if I delete the indy from the chart.

Any suggestions......???

--- 帖子 #561 ---
In the options dialogue you should be able to set the alert function to false, is this possible?

--- 帖子 #562 ---
If the alert is simply triggered whenever there is a cross, then everytime the indicator is intialized, the alert will go off for every cross as the indicator is drawn for the first time.

Some code needs to be added so that the alert is triggered only for crosses which happen after the indicator has been drawn.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Hi All,

Fishing for trade on NFP day...hmn.. very careful though.

GU got to a good start...anyone caught dat??... I came to my PC late..but was able to get it @ 6614. Anyone else??

Carmen is watching...... lol

Happy trading to u all.

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Guys,

do you trade Carmen during and shortly after Newstime like today after

unemployment rates?

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Personally, I'd rather stay out during major news time, specially NFP. Happy trading.

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Hey Aicccia great thread and indicator---I am looking forward to your ALERT and then the EA...

I like to trade manually and an alert that works would be much appreciated.

thanks again

The Eegle

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Sure... but if I do that, then what's the point of having the alert in the first place.

The whole reason I want an audible alert for any crosses of Carmen is so that I can work on my other business instead of having to stay glued to charts all day.

Cheers,

P.

--- 帖子 #568 ---
The question intended to test the functions of the indicator only.

BTW I am not able to reproduce the error you experienced while using this indi.

You may try to recompile it. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Hello all, very quiet Friday, NFP day.

Pull out ur chart, EU or GU ( Preferably EU for what am about to tell u.

Change ur TF to 5Mins, watch EU after the news. If u traded EU using just carmen, u would have gone short and u would have been up by about 176 pips...ouch....

Carmen can trade the news ....u only need to wait and allow everything to settle down...say 15 mins after the news.

Same for GU. Whaooo....CARMEN is a winner...

Have a good weekend all...and lets do it again from Sunday night....

--- 帖子 #570 ---
It was slow but Carmen turned out to be a winner:  75 pips  (I take winning pips).

I still use version 2.01 and incorporate it with 3.01 in my 30 minute chart (I just close and reopen every 30 minutes which takes care of the lag of version 2.01) along with 1 minute chart using version 3.01 alone.

Aicccia, I still like the 2.01.   It just lags.  I just close and open my MT4 every 30 minutes. and it realigns to give me better picture..works like a charm...at least for me.

Thanks again

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Aicccia can the EA have a MaxSpread parameter?

I was also thinking about a possibility of scaling in winning positions, letting +ve trades cover more and more. Something like each order trails wider and wider, so on large moves if price doesn't come back to the starting point, we are in trades for days?

--- 帖子 #572 ---
I understand what you are saying and the default settings for 2.01 do just that, the greater the profit, the farther the channel follows the price.

However after loooking at my charts alot, I saw that this was not the best strategy since the pips gained from staying in for longer trends always get lost since the trend must to retrace significantly before the order gets closed.

It's better to set a max profit target, maybe 150 pips on the GBP/USD and set your system to follow the trend at its tighest settings once this profit target is reached.

Then once this point is reached, the trade will invaraibly get closed when the price retraces just a little. And then if the trend resumes, the system will be back to following the price at it's loosest settings, giving the trade room to grow more or get stopped out at breakeven.

So the system in its current form, "Let's profits grow, but after a certain point gets very protective of them".

--- 帖子 #573 ---
A max spread parameter is a good idea. I'll add it.

--- 帖子 #574 ---
This is a cool indicator

Thanks

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Hi Ibuks,

saw your screenshot some posts bevor...

Can you tell me what indicators you using, especially the violett one ?

Regards

Peter

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Perfect, I knew you'd know more about the situation...the trend resuming thing is a great idea

And yeah the max spread thing will hopefully be useful and give some piece of mind on crazy news days. Otherwise, on medium news it may milk some extra pips if all goes well

--- 帖子 #577 ---
@aicccia

For exit I would think more about dynamic...

I am testing the Chandelier Exit with different parameters, and it brings good results to me...

--- 帖子 #578 ---
what is a Chandelier Exit?

--- 帖子 #579 ---
I dont know how it works, but add it and you will see how it works..

in BUY trades the blue line is the SL line..

If the line changes to the other side, SL is hit...

( Change the KV parameter to 6.0, seems best for Carmen...)

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Nice strategy..almost zero-loss

But I have to watch the market all the time, can I use it in bigger tf?

--- 帖子 #581 ---
I noticed that if you use the indicator with a 4.0 space on 15 min charts, the results are great. Many false signals are eliminated, although you do still get some. Also, If I am going long I will set my stop 3 pips below the yellow line (27 pips with a 4.0 space), and when I get to 25 pips, I break even. Once I have broken even I move my stop with the dark blue line as it continues up. do the opposite for a short trade.

Here are the results From Nov. 2nd to Dec. 4th for GU using the above parameters:

Winning Trades: 29

Losing Trades: 14

Total Profit: +1766 pips

Keep in mind, this I went through quickly so it is not perfect, but you get the idea. It would be great if the EA had the capablity to set the spacing and exit parameters similar to this!

--- 帖子 #582 ---
thank you for taking the time to look at the system. In version v3.3 it will take only 10 pips to breakeven on a false cross.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Hi Aicccia

It keeps getting better!!

Just wondering, will v3.3 be the EA, or just an improved carmen indi.

Many thanks

Ezzy

--- 帖子 #584 ---
well unless I figure out the bug in this post, there won't ever be an EA. And that's no joke.

I'll release v3.3(the indicator) in a few days when I've had a chance to test the alerts.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
I do not know whether this will help or not but my understanding from another forum is that "when you use an indicator by calling it from within an EA using an "iCustom" call, each time the indicator is called, it's loaded into memory, initialized, performs it's buffer array calculations, returns the value of a designated buffer slot to the EA, and then unloads itself from memory."

Certain functions are only effective on a version of the indicator that is loaded and persistent on a chart. Basically, the indicator is loaded in memory and stays there, allowing the indicator functions to do their thing as each new price bar forms.

Consequently, because of the way EA's call indicators, the signals derived or lines produced within an EA that places iCustom calls (in this case to the carmen indicator) may not correspond to many of the actual lines/dashes painted by the carmen indicator that is loaded on a chart.

To overcome this issue would it be possible to include or embed the indicator code/logic within the EA instead of making iCustom calls to the indicator?

--- 帖子 #586 ---
I have strongly suspected that this was how indicators and custom indicators worked and I did try to to embed the indicator logic in the EA. But my indicator needs to calculate from the beginning of the chart to arrive at the correct values for any single bar, and with an EA, I do not see how this is possible. I was not able to get the indicator logic to calculate bars from prior to the beginning of the backtest.

However you said that icustoms get loaded, initialized and calculated for each call, and if this is so, then I shouldn't have a problem. I don't care that the icustom is being re-loaded constantly, my first bridge to cross is just to get it to arrive at the same value for each bar as when it's loaded onto a chart.

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Is there any body that can help us with this problem cuz I think we should bombard their inbox, i'm sure that will get the attention of other programmers.

--- 帖子 #588 ---
I wish I could help, but in trying to code an EA for this indicator I am encountering the same problem. Although it seems like it should work there must be something that recalculates differently upon each independent call.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
I'll be asking some coder friends aicccia from tommorow morning onwards

--- 帖子 #590 ---
interesting, i've recently been using 15M with more success given my limited amount of trading time.  I'll experiment with your settings and see what I come up with.  Guess I should devote a demo to this.

Thanks again aiccia!

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Hi All, Its good to be back.

Mkt is open for another wk and I wish u all success and loads of pips this week.

Looking forward to a good carmen week.

Already looking to catch something from EURJPY playing the gap with carmen 5mins.

I was able to catch it at 134.03, aiming for 134.40 first TP (to close the gap). My SL is below the Yellow line as usual and am trying the space 4.0 on the 5 mins chart.

Who says carmen does not play gap....lol

--- 帖子 #592 ---
No probs Aicccia.

I am no coder, but let me know if there is anything I can do.

Hi guys,

First of all a great thanks to Aicccia for the awesome indicator.

I've been following this thread since its inception and I thought I would add my two cents.

We all know that carmen gives awesome entries. I just wanted to show you guys how I filter out good and bad entries and get my exits.

As seen in the screenshot, I use the ADX indicator to filter out any possible range bound trades and also use it to enter trades that are bound to trend. I will take a long if the 3ema had crossed up past the blue line on carmen and the +DI has crossed the -DI, also I will see if the ADX line is starting to rise up from 20 or is rising past 25 to determine if this will continue as a trend. To exit the long I will simply exit once the +DI has closed beneath the -DI. Vice versa for shorts.

To filter out bad trades, I will not take any trades when the 3ema crosses carmen and the ADX is below 20. I will also look at higher timeframes such as the 1H and 4H to determine the long term trend and I will only trade in that direction. I've noticed this method of trading carmen is primarily successful on higher timeframes such as 15m and 30m.

If you go back and look at last week you will see that it only gives you a couple of trades per week, and following the guidelines I listed this will keep your losses at a shear minimum if not at zero and give you huge profits.

Just my two cents and any feedback as to how to improve this or any kind of feedback would be appreciated. Thank You

Again thanks to Aicccia

I'm still demoing this way of trading Carmen

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Mannai

Interesting points.

I am finding that for my style of trading, carmen has better results on the 1hr GU only.

Higher timeframes (4hr, daily) show the overall trend and help me to filter bad trades. So if if the overall trend is short, I'll wait for price to retrace and cross above carmen on the 1hr, then I wait for price to cross back below carmen and then I open my trade.

My 5 cents worth.

Ezzy

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Ezzy,

I was wondering, to determine to the trend on the larger timeframes do you use any assistance from indicators such as moving averages or just plain looking at price and which direction its been going over the last little while.

Also what kind of take profit strategy do you use?

What kind of results have you seen with this 1hr GBP

Mannai70

--- 帖子 #601 ---
I have NOT lost any trades using the 30 min.  Can you take a look at this. If we can develop a better methodology that would be great.

--- 帖子 #602 ---
I usually put in 3 lots.  Get out 1 lot after +10pips profit.  Get out another 1 lot after 20pips profit. And let the other run.  SL is triggered at the open price after the first take profit.

--- 帖子 #603 ---
forexforex,

do you open your trade before that candle is finished.

As per my method in my earlier post, I don't believe there was a losing trade since I started demoing it last week on either the 15 min or 30 min. Carmen itself is pretty good to use on the 15min or 30min timeframe but the reason I use the other indicators is to minimize risk and increase my confidence that the trade will be successful. So in the other words I try to decrease the amount of variables that I can not see when determining if I should go in based on a particular Carmen signal.

Are you trading live or demo?

What kind of results have you seen so far?

--- 帖子 #604 ---
I have been trading it live G/U only. What is good about it is that I always take profit in the first lot +10pips. The second lot is +20 pips (breakeven). The 3rd remaining lot gets +30 pips or more (or breakeven).

--- 帖子 #605 ---
After observing different TF, I've also find out some sanity in 30min. So I'll stick to this TF. Also playing with other pairs, came to the same conclusion as aicccia, cable is the best pair to play with.

Now one other observation....since we are looking at the cross of the white line from blue/yellow channel, isn't it better to remove the price graph from the chart! This way, less points of distraction, so you can concentrate on the real price action, i.e., 3ema cross.

Also, I like mannai70's idea using ADX as filter.

So, forexforex, I am with you shorting the cable now...

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Points of reentries are the points where the white line intersects in the previous candle as the price is dropping (in sell trend mode)

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Got me 80 pips total and I am done for now...Waiting till the EMA recrosses BLUE and YELLOW lines...if it recrosses.  If it does not, I am done for the day.

Hi All,

I missed all the action from yesterday. I actually thought with the big move last friday, mkt will be choppy. I decided to take the day off.... my BAD.

I just came back to look at my 30 mins chart with carmen and....meeen...I shoot myself in the leg. A whopping 300 pips on EJ, over 200 pips on GU and even EU.... whaoo...what a move. Mkt will always do what mkt will do.

That is why I am looking forward to carmen EA....lol

Just take a look at 30 mins carmen on EJ..... just forget all the other things u see on the chart...just focus on CARMEN...that is my indicator of choice.

--- 帖子 #609 ---

You trade the 30min chart exclusively right? and the G/U?

Are you trading this live? how long and how have your results been so far?

What kind of SL are you using?

Mannai70

--- 帖子 #618 ---
I was trading the hr live, however my sl was too big at times. Trading the 30 min also give accurate signals and small sl so I am sticking to 30 min atm.

I have learned in the last few weeks to only trade GU. For sl I either use carmen or higher lows / lower highs.

I am trading the GU live.

Here is my recent profit on the crossover:

It has been consistent profit for me with this methodology.

Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Hey, remember how I said the next version would handle ranging "a lot better"?

Well that is turning out to be a huge understatement.

I just wanted to let you guys know that v3.4 is looking S-P-E-C-T-A-C-U-L-A-R.

-----------------------------------------

Also a note of warning:

For the EA, and possibly even for the next indicator version, the source code will not be available.

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Nice trade forexforex...where is your initial SL? do you trail the SL, or leave it at initial SL?

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Can't wait, maestro!

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Hi Aicccia,

I have been trading for 5 years and this is the most consistent methodology...I just need to be patient all the time and wait for the crossover and the good entry to develop.  Can you take a look at it please.

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #624 ---
I definately looked at your posts and considered ways to filter the trades against the prevailing trend, espcially since that was already the theme for the next release. And I have come up with a methdology for "trading with the trend" and though it is a little different from yours, so far it has the same good results.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Do you mean, we won't be able to see the code or there won't be an EA?

--- 帖子 #626 ---
you just won't be able to see the code.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
That's more than reasonable aicccia, you gone to so much trouble so far in coding. May I ask about the reason behind you not sharing the code? Just hope no one has abused anything y'know

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Thank you for your fantastic indicator. Please forgive me for asking a daft question. I can not find Versions 3.2 nor V3.3 for that matter. Can you please enlighten me.

Kindest Regards

--- 帖子 #629 ---
I just don't want anyone selling it and marketing it as their own.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Definitely, I agree also. But don't scammers normally just rename the executable files and pass them on as their own? Hmm, but trading it would far surpass profits from selling it, so maybe it won't be frauded in that way?

--- 帖子 #631 ---
The last public release was v3.1.

v3.2 and 3.3 were internal versions just for myself. Everytime I change a significant portion of the code, I'll up the version number so I can go back to previous versions if I need to. And usually several "significant portions of code" get changed before I consider a version good enough for a public release.

So this is a way for telling how different the versions are. A complete jump from v2 to v3 would indicate 100% rewritten code, so between v3.1 and v3.4 will be about a 30% difference in code.

--- 帖子 #632 ---
I will put things in the code to keep them from doing that.

--- 帖子 #633 ---
hello have been using carmen3.1 with great performance and cant thank you enough for your work and sharing.when can we expect the 3.4 jewl?

Been lurking on this thread, but I have to say I'm very grateful for your work on this beauty. Carmen has brought me luck so far. I'll hope she will continue to do so, but so far I have no reason to think otherwise.

Awaiting version 3.4...

Many thanks for clearing that up. Once again Thank you for sharing and I wish you all the success.

Can I ask what space setting you have on carmen on your charts and do you alter it to suit conditions

Many Thanks

Hi all,

firstly thanks to Aicccia for all the work he is doing for this group. Secondly thanks also to all the members of this thread for your contributions which prompt further developments of Carmen.

Could I ask a question that I cant find the answer to?

How do I use the four settings in the indicator? I know they are to alter parameters in the indicator but cant work out what they do (in laymans terms).

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Hi,

Your system looks great. Could I ask how can I use this system ? I do not understand where can I find the public release was v3.1.

Thanks in advance

It got you a few pips, I missed the initial downward cross, but caught the pullback @ 1.6249 and popped a lot on the live account.  I figured I couldn't go wrong shorting there.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
This is what happened today for me.

+66pips 1st crossover

+10pips 2nd crossover + 30pips @ reentry

Total: 106 pips

Wow impressive today..It has exceeded my target of 50pips/day.

Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Forexforex,

I like your methodology, it gets you about the same amount of profits as the bigger moves without having to stay in the trade as long.

I was just wondering what that other white line is in your charts, I know one is the 3ema but the other one I don't know what that is.

Could please briefly explain your methodology again?

Thanks in advance

Mannai

Hi all

Just wondering if anyone else is taking this one, it looks good!!

Price appears to have generated as it has crossed Daily Pivot and Daily Open.

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Hi Ezzy,

GU look set for another down turn. There is a red news today, so care must be applied.

What SL do u use for ur 30min TF. If I take it, a breach of 6285, I will get out...dats about 35pips SL.

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Ibuks

My stop loss is just above Daily pivot which is 1.6267.

Your right about red news, much caution should be used...nonetheless, I like the look of it.

Carmen's eyes has 20 - 20 vision, what do you think? lol

Hope it's a good run for us both.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #651 ---
That's OK, every system has to have some losses right?

I am thinking that price is testing daily pivot.

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Hey Pal,

Dont u think the sl is too tight ? Sometimes u need to give it room to breath. If it get above 85, there would have been a candle close above the blue carmen line...thats what I think though.

Mkt will do what mkt will do anyway...but carmen have been good to catch these things on all time frame.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Can u see what I said about the tight SL?? It just spiked up, took u out and continued.

I think I like the idea of taking 10, 20, 30 pips along the way...very nice idea from someone earlier in the thread....

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Ibuks

You are completely right, looking at where you suggested to place the sl would have been a much better choice.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
Hey pal,

Its breaking down nicely for me....ouch...

No risk no gain..

--- 帖子 #656 ---
Very true mate.

Good luck on this one!

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Took some off the the table, left the rest at BE.

Unfortunately, I just came back to see that it has been stopped out...ouch.

Thats why I think I will start using forexforex idea...... take what u have while u still have it.

Looking for another setup.

--- 帖子 #658 ---
I have been away the last week and just read up on what has been going on, this is abslutely great news Aicccia! Thank you for everything, I can't wait to test Carmen's new version during this slooooooow holiday season.

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Hi Aicccia,

I have been successful lately trading using your indicator.  I built my trading methodology based on the premise of what you mentioned in your 1st post.  Some traders here are wondering why I have been so successful trading using your indicator.  The only thing I can say is that I look at the bigger picture plus patience, plus trust in the indicator.  To illustrate this I have a print screen of dating back November 9 to present.  The pink blocks represent crossover momentum  and the orange blocks are the rejections momentum. The chart is G/U 30 mins.  Come on  guys...pictures can't tell lie. See it for yourself.

Thanks for the pics ForexForex!  I am glad to see you are doing so well and helping to prove the value of the Carmen Eyes system.

Can you give some specifics on exactly how you are trading this?  What SL and TP.  ANy filters.  Do you exit one trade and just reenter in the opposite direction?

Thanks in advance for your help!

SirWolf

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Hey Forexforex,

Thanks for posting.  I've been following this thread a while and am trialing the Carmen indicator as well - with some success.  My questions to you are: Do you enter the moment the line crosses or wait till a new candle forms (still above when going long and still below when short)? How do you place your stops to try and not get stopped out when the market chops a little? I've caught some good trends with Carmen but lately I do seem to be getting stopped out a fair bit and you seem to be having better success so I'd really appreciate your insight.

Many thanks,

Pushers

--- 帖子 #664 ---
big down move on the USDCAD, this would be the best time to close your trade. A good time to re-enter would be if price breaks support line.

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Hi Aicccia,

Thank you for sharing your amazing indicator. I am still trying to understand it and trying out various settings, but so far it works well. You have obviously dedicated a lot of time and effort to the development of the carmen indicator and your generosity is most commendable. May all your trades be profitable and I wish for you every blessing!

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Not sure I did this quite right but this was my trade on the GU this morning.  It shows the potential although I bailed before it hit the bottom.  This was on the one minute TF.  Like others in this thread, I like the 30 minute too.  There seems to be less false breakouts.  I can see the potential of this indicator filtering it with fibonacci and strategic areas of support and resistance.  I have been following this thread and many are using this indicator in different ways with positive results.  I will keep reading and learning.  Just a note.  I never use indicators so this would be a change for me but so far I like it and the breakouts usually occur where a traditional fib level or s/r is being broken.  Thanks Aicccia for this contribution and all your hard work.

PT

--- 帖子 #667 ---
Thanks. I read your comments about your trade intervals during market trading. You said you preffered 30 min. chart when trading. I want to ask: As an intraday trader who has just started trading, which charts are the most friendly for newbies?

--- 帖子 #668 ---
forexforex,

I was wondering why in the example in this post (645) you waited until what seems like the second or third 30 minute candle after we crossed the blue line to buy.  Is there a filter you used to cause you to wait?

Thanks,

PT

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Sorry for the question, but i want to know where i change the value for take profit (red and orange line in this indicator).

Regards,

Alex.

--- 帖子 #670 ---
I usually wait until white line confirms the current  trend as indicated by the white line and current price have crossed over  and past the previous white line. This usually happens between 2nd and 3rd candle at the crossover.  My point of Entry is usually at the 4th candle as it is passing the last white line.

--- 帖子 #671 ---
Thanks, I knew you had a good reason.

PT

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Forexforex,

I was wondering what that second white line is? I know the one that follows price very closely is the 3ema but I don't know what the second one in your charts is.

Thanks

Mannai70

--- 帖子 #673 ---
That blue line is a Carmens_eyes_v3.1 with the following settings:

It lags a little but after closing and opening the MT right after 30min expires (when forming a new candle), it gives you a better picture or perspective of the trend.  I hope Aicccia will fix this also as we can use it as an early signal of change of trend for more profit.  You can try using it and tell me what you will discover.

--- 帖子 #674 ---
Hmm, strange with those setting I only have yellow line showing.

And top blue line is missing.

--- 帖子 #675 ---
I normally don't trade this late.. But this is just an illustration of the point of entry. Although I went ahead and took the trade.

--- 帖子 #676 ---
same here with this settings only the yellow line appears

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Out 1@ 1.6272.  SL for the remaining 2 lots is triggered at break even point at the point of entry (it is late in the afternoon)

--- 帖子 #678 ---
+30 pips so far in this trade.  I just let the other 1 lot remaining run and see what happens. Done for today.

Thanks again

--- 帖子 #679 ---
nice trades

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Just not sure what you need Carmen for in Market like this?

Today whole day it's

flat EURUSD Pair doesn't even move, because there is sideways trading.

You can just buy low sell high. Without all those 1-2-3 . It's flat like

plywood.

Support--Resistance--Support--Resistance.. That's all. Look

it's flat for over 24 hours now.

--- 帖子 #681 ---
I have not tried Carmen for this currency.  But I adjusted the Average to 4 and space 1 and this is what I got.  You may have to adjust the space and average settings depending on the currency pairs and the momentum of the market.

--- 帖子 #682 ---
Hi aiccia and everyone,

These are my settings for the Carmen indicator when trading G/U:

Average : 3

Space : 1

The methodology that I am using may be unorthodox , but it works with my trading style.  It is never my intention to indoctrinate anyone here.  I am simply addressing one of the ways to trade Carmen.  In the end, Aiccia has the final say on how this indicator should be used and I am just a follower .

Forexforex

--- 帖子 #683 ---
can someone pls post the templates here? thanks!

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Hi ForexForex,

I am new to this forum and have found Aiccia indicator useful. But i had some questions for you regarding his indicator.

Please take a look at the attached. There is a scenario where e white line is below the yellow and blue line and is at the 3rd candle. But however it went up shortly, how do we prevent that from happening?

And also what is the red and green line used for?

I just download from 1st page and used it on GBPUSD 30Mins TF... is it ok? i did not do any setting like what u mentioned above as i dont know how to do that setting...

--- 帖子 #685 ---
I suggest you read the thread in it's entirety and all you questions will be answered.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
In order for the 1st candle to be valid in the crossover it has to be a big push up or down.  Secondly, if there are several candles before the the white line (3ma) crosses over, it indicates that it is just ranging...I usually don't take the trade.  But I still watch for continuation or rejection by waiting for more than 3 candles to develop at the crossover.

If I had taken the the trade anyway, i would have accepted the loss.  But i know that I would  regain it back if I follow the methodology.

--- 帖子 #687 ---
forexforex,

did you post a template earlier on today? if so I can't find it anymore.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #688 ---
ic ic... so based on the indicator now, there is no trade right?

Btw, possible to explain to me what does the red and green line do? thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #689 ---
Thanks for the free lesson forexforex. An obvious observation in hindsight, however I had not taken that into account, looking through the recent signals (this week) I notice that false signals occur when price is ranging.

Many thanks again, cheers

--- 帖子 #690 ---
I take extra precaution on reentries as it is risky to trade.

To be valid in an UPtrend:

1.  Signal of trend continuation (HL Higher than previous Low white line) should occur.

2.  Signs of testing the point of signal should occur

3.  Point of entry should be above the Signal point after ONLY if testing occurred.

To be valid in an UPtrend:

1.  Signal of trend continuation (LH Lower than previous High white line) should occur.

2.  Signs of testing the point of signal should occur

3.  Point of entry should be below the Signal point after ONLY if testing occurred.

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Hey forexforex.............what's that white line just above the carmen indicator?

time to go short for GBPUSD?

See attached...

--- 帖子 #693 ---
hey guys, manage to get 10 pips out of it..

And now i am going in again at 1.6235 with short...

Anybody knows how to set the strategy as what forexforex did?

1) Enter 3 lots

2) TP for 1 lot when gain 10 pips

3) switch to BE for SL for e remaining 2 lots and set 20 pips for TP

i am using ibfx and trying it out on demo.. not sure how to set it... can only close the trades with 3 lots..

--- 帖子 #694 ---
Hello everyone,

Another very good week with carmen. Profit improved with higher time frame trades (30 mins), but I still take the 1 min trade as well.

My advice to new people trading carmen, stick with 1 max 2 pairs. Trading GU alone is enough to pay the bills. I trade GU & EJ only because, GU leads, other follows....lol

Have a great weekened all...and thanks again aiccai for the great innovation...and looking forward to the new release. If the current release can be this good...I wonder how much more to expect....great things are ahead.

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Hi Ibuks,

Do you trade Carmen the way Aicccia outlined in post 1 or do you have your own way?

Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #696 ---
Hi Mannai,

I follow the originator, as he knows the indicator inside out better than I do. Thats why I trade the 1 min ...but my main trades are from the 30 mins. I have more success following what the 30mins says using the 1 min. Something like using the 1 min for entry.

Play with it, find what suit u and am sure it works out the best dat way. I use the default settings, eventhough am also testing other settings suggested on this forum...but i find the default settings as the way to go for me, since that is what is recommended...and on GU.

--- 帖子 #697 ---
I found something which looks similar to carmen, it's called dynamic range indicator.

was wondering, if there could be a relationship between the carmen code and this of the other one.

can someone PLEASE ADD a ALERT to when the the lines get crossed, and not only for GU but for all the currencies PLEASE, i've ried with no luck

--- 帖子 #703 ---
Enter 1 lot, three times...then you can close 1 lot at 10pips, then close the remaining two lots at 20pips.

Be patient....master aicccia will release 3.4 tomorrow which will do just that, plus other tunings to the indicator.

What is the best currency pair to use this system?

So far, is 30m a best fit time frame with this strategy?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
This is a handy tool written by a talented programmer (not me) .  Put in experts and drag it onto the chart window.  It allows you to close a percentage of your trade at tp1 and the rest at tp2.  You also lock in pips at break-even when tp1 is reached or move TP and SL by dragging the lines on the chart.

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Cool thread, found it today. Looks like I got here just in time.

Thanks everyone.

version with alert is here

http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...%202009%208:47

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Folks:

I took the previous indi alert and cleaned up some of the code.  The script will now send an alert once per Carmen crossing.  Unlike the previous version where several alerts were being sent.

I took brief look at the post where the author of the method is having problems with the EA development.  I'm not to clear on what the situation is, if u want u can PM me for some explanation and I'll take a look.

I didn't change the name but added notes in the code to clarify what the update is about.  For those interested (that can program), it would not be difficult to convert this indi into an EA with Buy/Sell functions.

Have fun

Jess

--- 帖子 #711 ---
Hello,

I just wanted to let everyone know that the next version will be postponed a few days, prehaps till wensday. I had previously stated that the theme for the next release would "ranging performance", and while that is still true, there is now a second theme: "simplified and more intuitive".

And since there are so many changes, I'm going ahead and calling the next release v4.0, instead of v3.4.

To summerize:

- Next release will be v4.0

- Themes of release are "ranging performance" and "simplified, more intuitive"

- due to amount of changes, release delayed till wensday.

--- 帖子 #712 ---
Sounds like you are doing a whole heap of work aicccia.

Thanks mate.

--- 帖子 #713 ---
Thanks to aicccia for all the hard work, and thank you for the alert option xmess, I have been looking for an alert add on for another indicator I use (BAT ATR v2), but I am just a beginner in programming and it just wouldn't work. This is the first piece of code I see written seriously and I just might be able to adapt it for what i need. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #719 ---
oh no.. miss this entry of going long... maybe a EA might have help us with it...

--- 帖子 #720 ---
set automatic TP and SL to false.  Set TP to your TP2. Set First take profit to your TP1, I have it set to 50 percent so it closes half at TP1 which I have set at 10pips. I set break even at 10 pips and lock in 1pip for the second half.  TP for the second half is set at 30.  I start trailing at 10 with a 5 pip trailing step.

Here is my set file.  I zipped it because .set files would not upload

Hello Nickmead.This Quik_Trailing EA to manage trades has a ALLOW_DRAG_PRICE LINES in it.Does this mean that the TP and SL lines can be moved up or down to lock-in profits by just using the mouse as price moves?Thanks------GOD BLESS----SJ

--- 帖子 #724 ---
really thanks for ur help...i have load ur .set ,let me interpret it, please correct me if i am wrong.

So once i enter the trade for example. 3 lots long @ 1.6500. The SL would be 20 pips which is 1.6480.

The Total take profit would be 30 pips but we break up into 3 portion.

If it hit 10 pips TP,  it would close 50% which is 1.5 lots close.

Then e rest for example, trailing stop,set breakeven, i do not know how does it works..

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Yes.  If you double click on a SL or TP line you and drag it up or down.  Enjoy

cheers

N

--- 帖子 #726 ---
Quicktrailing only has two TP's not three.

Breakeven allows you to move your SL to your entry price, or lockin profits after your first TP has been hit.  The trailing stop works like the standard one in MT4 but you can decide when it starts.

Play with it in DEMO for a few trades.

cheers

--- 帖子 #727 ---
I've loaded carmens 3.1 with default settings on 1 and 5 min GBP charts and the blue and yellow lines stay as 2 parallel lines about 1/3 from the top of the chart even when I scroll back days. Like below:

Only when I go up to 30 min and 1 hour charts do the blue and yellow lines start to follow price action somewhat.

Should this be happening?

Thanks for any help.

Many thanks to aicccia for this excellent indicator and forexforex, ezzy and others for their insight.

Here is a pic of current trade.  Quick trailing has closed half at 10 pips,  Trailing stop has moved and locked in 5 pips on the remainder already.  Second tp is set at 30 but I might move it higher if price action dictates

Hi AICCCIA

I got my 50 pips target today already and counting.

Can you please look at Carmen with the setting posted in POST # #674

Some are having difficulty though with the setup.  Can you please double check when you can?  I see that I can get a better entry using it.  It just that I have to close and open MT4 every 30 minutes to get the the indicator to readjust corretly...not sure if this is a lag.

I hope it is not much to ask.

Thank you very much.

It hasn't changed and I'm not sure it's working.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #738 ---
Yes, I can confirm that. I think it is to keep you from going in and out of too many trades in a ranging market. It has been pretty flat lately...

I'd like to use this opportunity to thank aicccia for sharing this indicator/system with us! I am trying it out on GBP/USD 1M with default settings.

Thank you Nickmead for confirming this.GOD BLESS....SJ

--- 帖子 #740 ---
in a ranging market, isn't Carmen just the same (because it stays as horizontal lines and doesn't track price) as putting two horizontal lines midway on the chart and only trading when price is either side of them?

--- 帖子 #741 ---
oh gosh, woke up and found that i missed another long entry... looking forward to the EA for this so that i wont miss out anything..

forexforex, so from the chart, you would enter long at the 3rd candle which is around 1.6282?

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Hi ,

The spacing of 0.0001 is too samll which is why the blue and yellow lines merge.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #743 ---
aicccia,

Thank you so much for your work on the Carmen system indicator. Great job!

I did have one tweak I did on version 3.1 to take away a little clutter on the trailing stops (range1 and range2) once they reached the averagefx (white) line. Once those red and orange lines touched the white line they made one more line to match up with the blue or yellow lines.  I took out that last line.

The lines with the comments (red) are what I changed:

if(order==1) {

top[i]=step1;

bottom[i]=step1-buffer;

if(step2Close==false) { range1[i]=step2;  }

if(step2Close==true)  { range1[i]=EMPTY_VALUE; }   //top[i]

if(step3Close==false) { range2[i]=step3;  }

if(step3Close==true)  { range2[i]=EMPTY_VALUE; }}  //top[i]

if(order==2) {

top[i]=step1+buffer;

bottom[i]=step1;

if(step2Close==false) { range1[i]=step2;  }

if(step2Close==true)  { range1[i]=EMPTY_VALUE; }   //bottom[i]

if(step3Close==false) { range2[i]=step3;  }

if(step3Close==true)  { range2[i]=EMPTY_VALUE; }}  //bottom[i]

Plus a thought on your EA problem (your #585 post): when you were coding your EA and using iCustom - for the shift parm did you use 1 (not 0)?  I had troubles once in an EA using 0 as it is the current open bar and is unpredictable while 1 is the previous finished bar.

Hope these help.

Mark

Nice EA nick, I like it, many thanks.

--- 帖子 #745 ---
Does this system work with any timeframe? if the answer is yes, what timeframe is the better one based on your experience?

--- 帖子 #746 ---
Hi Chalieman,

You need to find what suit you best. The originator reccomended 1 min on GU (default settings), however, other people on the forum have come up with the time frame that best suited them.

Personally, I think its best to play around with it, find what your personality can cope with, develop a trading strategy around it...and u will be smilling to the bank daily....dats the truth.

I hope this help......

--- 帖子 #747 ---
Could someone please clarify the instrucitons:

When the white line is above the yellow and blue lines, BUY.

Then when the white lines falls below the yellow and blue lines, close the buy and SELL.

Then when the white lines rises back above the yellow and blue lines, close the sell and BUY again.

In a ranging market where the blue and yellow lines essentially remain as horizontal parallel lines, "close the sell and buy again/close the buy and sell again" (continuous trading/always having an order open) will generate a loss on each trade equal roughly to the pips distance between the lines.

Could someone please clarify thanks.

--- 帖子 #748 ---
manage to try the Quik Trailing EA when the line falls below the yellow and blue line at the 2nd candle.

I go short at 1.6232 for 5 lots. But how come it take profit for 50% at 1.6218 instead of 1.6222?

From the graph, it states First Take Profit is On (50% at +10pips) so it should be 1.6222? pls correct me if i am wrong.. thanks

--- 帖子 #749 ---
You are right, however if the market was moving fast at that time it would have entered the order when the price was 1.6222 and might have been filled a few pips later.  By default the EA allows for max slippage of 5.  Nice trade by the way

cheers

N

--- 帖子 #750 ---
i see....so actually by right it would have close half the lots (2.5 lots) at 1.6222? but i still does not understand why it close at 1.6218 instead? what does it means by slippage of 5 pips?

It would have been even better if we would have a EA on this, so that we would not miss the entry...

--- 帖子 #751 ---
sometimes in the time from when the order is submitted to when it is executed the price changes, this is slippage. Sometimes your broker gives you a requote when the slippage is high.

Yes an EA would be nice

cheers

--- 帖子 #752 ---
Yep I agree an EA would be nice? Where is Ronald Raygun when you need him???

--- 帖子 #753 ---
I am surprised that Ron or Swingman hasn't put together something.

You normally have at least 1 or two programmers working on these things.  Get's a little confusing at times.....

However, credit where credit's due, aicccia has done a fantastic job on this indicator.  Thanks for sharing your work aicccia.

I look forward to seeing your EA (tomorrow?).

Warm Regards,

Hey Guys....Let's show a little patience here. This is aiccia's thread, his idea, his indicator which he has been kind enough to share with us. When he has a problem he has shown no hesitation in asking for coding help. While I have great respect for the coders mentioned in the quoted post I don't feel it is our responsibility to suggest that other coders jump into the thread. I would presume that the above referenced coders concur with this opinion. Aiccia has been more than generous in keeping us up to speed and answering our questions when asked so let's keep off his back.

--- 帖子 #755 ---
JR, I couldn't agree more. Aiccia has given us a gift, a gift some of us truly appreciate for its simplicity and ingenuity. Of course an EA would be nice, but we all need to be thankful for what he has already shared, not whine because we might have to put forth some effort of our own. Here's a thought, "Study to show thyself approved!" If an Ea shows up in the future - fine; if not - fine. We're already light years ahead of where we would be without this indicator.....

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Hi AICCCIA, GOOD MORNING to you and all! It is 2 am (GMT+8)

Have been reading this thread since I found it around 24 hrs ago.

Thanks for the patience and great work on this thread. As I am new here and only started reading up to page 4 but did read up on the last ten pages.

Firstly, I have problem downloading to my MT4 platform and following your instructions on post #51. However, the "compile" button is disabled. How do I get it enabled. Tried fumbling around with "help button" to find a solution myself instead of troubling others but in vain.

Being a late comer and the thread is far ahead, with so much CONSTANTLY CHANGING INFORMATION, it is quite impossible to catch up or filter what is obsolete and what is current especially in the area of indicators.

Hope u do not mind responding to this SOS call from a newbie to this thread. Been trying to make notes here and there.

Well here is to wish everyone on this thread a Blessed Christmas and Happy Pipping for the New Year!

--- 帖子 #757 ---
I agree.. let's be patient.  As you have may noticed I stopped posting my trades because my style of trading 30min is different from Aiccia's trading system.  I do not want to sway him with his original idea about Carmen's capability.

--- 帖子 #758 ---
Knowing trees, I understand the meaning of patience. Knowing grass, I can appreciate persistence.

--- 帖子 #759 ---
I'm new in the game (my first post) and feel fortunate to have come across this thread (name CARMEN drew my attention). I've read the post from page 1 and so far there seems to be a good group of members both following and contributing.

aicccia thank you for your gift and your unselfishness. I've yet to try out Carmen but everyone here seems to be benefiting from her charm. I'm looking forward to doing the same.

Once again, thanks aiccia and good luck in all you do.

God Bless....

--- 帖子 #760 ---
Can someone recommend to me the SL upon entering a trade using CARMEN. Difference between an M30 SL and an M1 SL.

Would sure be appreciated.

--- 帖子 #761 ---
Carmen levels 5min can be SL, when entering with carmen levels 30min. Anybody has another opinion?

--- 帖子 #762 ---
There was a nice buy today at 1015 GMT +1 (15m) on the G/U.

Anyone else pick it up?

--- 帖子 #763 ---
Yeah

Got out with 50 pips.

--- 帖子 #764 ---
Yes, I caught that one too, entered a little later when it broker over the last highs. I had a couple positions stopped out at 60 some pips leading up to the federal funds rate and one TP at 104 pips earlier. But I did get whipsawed a couple times before I got into that move which ate up some of the profit. It is hard for me to keep track of where Carmen is at when I am at work during the NY session. My broker is OandA, so I can at least make adjustments to the ongoing trade at break time (I have a desk job). Guess I should get a laptop...

--- 帖子 #765 ---
If you are talking about this one in the chart.  Yes I got in.

3 lots @1.6290

Out 1 @ 1.6300   +10

Out 1 @ 1.6310   +20

Let it run 1 lot and Out 1 @ 1.6367   +77

Total pips today: + 107

Thanks again and again.

--- 帖子 #766 ---
Hi forexforex.

Why didn't you enter again when the white line dipped below the yellow and blue over on the right of the chart?

Thanks.

Is anyone out there actually making real money with this and not demo money?

Wouldn't it just be the same to place a horizontal line midway up the chart and go short when price drops below it and long when it passes above it?

Aren't the odds effectively the same?

--- 帖子 #767 ---
sigh... miss that again... wish the EA was here..

--- 帖子 #768 ---
if you had the EA kpforex then you would also have got into the next one which was a loser.

it appears to me that there is a bit of living in hope going on here and looking at things through rose coloured glasses

--- 帖子 #769 ---
I usually enter at the 3rd candle. If the 2nd candle is a big push or momentum i take it.

In this scenario i did not enter because of the following reason:

2nd Candle is not a big push down or momentum

In fact, It retracted or retraced past the open of the bar.

White line did not even continue to form going down, in fact it retraced right away after the 2nd candlle or bar closed.

Last trade a winner:

3 lots was sold @1.6306

Out 1 lot@1.6296 +10

Out 1 lot @1.6286 +20

3rd remaining lot I just let it ran and a winner out @1.6130 +176

Total 206pips

Thanks again...Been trading this live by the way.

--- 帖子 #770 ---
I think that even if you had taken the trade that Tahiti mentions and lost a little, it would have only been a battle lost and going by the rules the balance at the end of the month is the indication of if you,re winning the war.

An EA would trade robotically and the above scenario's would inevitably happen.

ForexForex shows us that human intuition and experience is a better way to trade, however this is often at the expense of being glued to the PC.

Thoughts?

--- 帖子 #771 ---
Thanks forexforex.

Would you mind confirming the following as my blue and yellow lines are about 10 pips away from yours:

Which broker are you using

Which timeframe

Any other details particular to your setup that you think might make a difference in where your lines are compared with mine.

Regards

--- 帖子 #772 ---
Please post #683

Any Brokers that support 5 decimals in G/U is fine.

Good luck!

--- 帖子 #773 ---
Really? is that all you're doing that particular to you trading?

If so then you should be entering WHEN the white line passes through the yellow and blue, though you are not.

This is why I phrased my question to ask if there is anything particular to your setup.

So apart from entering on the 3rd candle so long as the 2nd is a stong push, are there any other idiosychracies particular to your style as compared with the authors recommendations?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #774 ---
also, that post doesn't state the time frame.

--- 帖子 #775 ---
He's been using the 30 minute time frame for trading.

I don't understand how the take profit lines work. Can anyone help me??

--- 帖子 #777 ---
Tahiti,

Hey...I am done for today.

It is better to explain my methodology as I do my trades.  When something presents a trading setup I'll post it here live as I enter my trades.. is that cool?

I hope Aiccia does not mind.  I have not seen Aiccia in a while, so while I am waiting for Version 4, I guess I'll start posting again my live trades.

--- 帖子 #778 ---
No trade at this time.

Waiting for White line to crossover.  Crossover signifies possible change of trend.

--- 帖子 #779 ---
Waiting for the same trade.

--- 帖子 #780 ---
Hey Gerry B,

the lines are generated at pre determined distances (line 1 and Line 2),and as the white line hits them they either fall back to the blue/yellow or disapear if you have modified the code as per a previous post.

I find the first one helpfull but the second ,IMO, normally fails to hit more pips on a regular basis.

Hope this helps?

PS wednesday has come and gone, is Aiccia still available to update us on his work?

I hope this sentence is not construed as rushing him!! just curious and really excited as to the next Carmen,(Like many more I suspect).

--- 帖子 #781 ---
Thanks for the info BOMBERO

--- 帖子 #782 ---
Try putting a MACD on your charts with settings of: 13, 21, 5 and watch what happens once Carmen crosses and the MACD crosses above or below the zero line. Enter the trade when the MACD forms above/below the zero line. Exit the trade when the MACD bar pulls under/above the white signal line.

Seems like a good filter to me.

Good trading everyone... and many thanks to the creator of this wonderful indicator. I can't wait until the next version walks the red carpet.

Is anybody able to make a conversion from Mt4 to MT5 for the original Carmen indicator?

--- 帖子 #784 ---
I know a lot of you will jump in and take the trade as the first candle and white line cross over, but it is not a convincing momentum change of trend.  waited for for 2nd candle...did not go anywhere...3rd candle...We just have to wait.

--- 帖子 #785 ---
Has anyone noticed the indicator repainting? Its not a hugh problem but just take note. Put the indicator on two charts of the same time period, let run for a good run. After CARMEN creates a new channel refresh one chart and you will see it repaint. So if CARMEN has been on your chart for awhile change the chart time back and forth to make sure it has a fresh channle for you to trade. Keep making great trades with CARMEN!!!!!!!

Derrick

--- 帖子 #786 ---
Yes that is what I notice.  I have been dealing with it by closing and relaunching MT4 every 30mins after the candle closes, and it recorrects itself.  But Carmen still manages to bring me home consistent pips.

--- 帖子 #787 ---
Hi Aiccia, thanks for the great indicators and your simple to follow system.

Quick question, have you decided what the best timeframes and pairs are for this?

I'm playing around with EURUSD M30 but i'd like your opinion.

thanks

--- 帖子 #788 ---
You' re right look like great i just put on my chart the MACD setting like yours, normally i use 30.60.30 on 15M or 30M.

Thank's for share ur MACD setting..

keep it up aicccia..

--- 帖子 #789 ---
we are all like kids who have been promised a trip to the toy shop. eagerly waiting. However the master is at work and he will be ready when he is ready. i think great things are yet to come

--- 帖子 #790 ---
Forexforex, all you need to do is right-click on either the blue or yellow line, then click on carmen's properties, then just click "OK". She will respond accordingly....

--- 帖子 #791 ---
Yes that would be gret forexforex and you're abosolutely correct, that is the best way to learn as it's completely unambiguous.

I will appreciate it

--- 帖子 #792 ---
Hello all.Try a 30 ema HI and a LOW CHANNEL on your Carmen charts.When price breaks the carmen blue or yellow lines, then wait for price to close , above for buys and below for sells ,of the 30 ema channel.Try it this works real good as a filter for M1 or M30.GOD BLESS......SJ

--- 帖子 #793 ---
I want to also add that,after a candle closes above/below the 30 channel,you can do "2" things:you can wait for the next candle to break the HIGH or LOW of the first candle that closed above /below the 30 channel or wait for the #3 candle like forexforex mentioned.Also,if it starts to form a range after price broke the 30 channel,then you wait for the range to be broken before getting in.DO NOT just get in on the first candle that closes above/below the 30 channel.This CHANNEL can be used as a filter with other technical factors.GOD BLESS...SJ

--- 帖子 #794 ---
hi, if based on ur reasoning... i think is not a good entry for 30EMA... please take a look at attached.

--- 帖子 #795 ---
Personally, I don't like to add any extra indicators to confirm a break of Carmen. I find they confuse more than they do good. I like to see maybe a break of a swing instead to confirm the momentum. Like today:

(Sorry, but I can help myself - what a textbook example of how price moves: Down move - consolidation - 1-2-3 reversal - price breaks the 2 point - creates a Ross hook - re-tests the previous break - breaks the hook and shoots up - hits the pivot point and creates a pin bar (just so happens to be a round number - confluence) - retraces before it shoots up again. And all on a 1 min chart - beautiful!)

--- 帖子 #796 ---
KPForex it is just a suggestion for a filter,when it trends it works pretty good because price will retrace to the channel maybe a little bit into it then resumes again towards the initial trend.For times of ranging you have to use other technical analysis or just wait for the range to break.Also,for a M30 chart you can catch a nice trend.GOD BLESS...SJ

--- 帖子 #797 ---
Wow!  Thanks.. that works.

--- 帖子 #798 ---
I will be posting the new version momentarily.

Thanks for waiting.

Take your time mate. We will test it thoroughly and report back.

take care.

Hey Aicccia,

I'm really looking forward to v.4!  May I enquire if with the new version any of your recommended rules, time frames, etc, have changed also?

Thanks,

Pushers

--- 帖子 #801 ---
I have just posted CARMEN v4 on the first post.

She behaves and looks different from v3.1, so even you've been using CARMEN since day 1, please re-read the first post as its been updated with the new rules and features.

Also as I said before, I'm not putting out the source code anymore. So CARMEN is just an .ex4 file, which means all you need to do is put her in your indicator folder. There is no need to compile her.

--- 帖子 #802 ---
HI

Thanks you are just amazing. Just loaded up and at 15:23GMT (8 minutes ago) conditions for Short was met after 5 minutes 10 pip up.

I notice you say M1 time frame only and havingchanged the time frames I can see the V4 does not work. Can this be used with other Pairs or just GBPUSD? I can see this thread is now buzzing (47 VIEWERS!) , any news on the EA?

Sorry to bombard you with questions. Just reply if you are feeling up to it.

Kind regards

--- 帖子 #803 ---
Thank you so much aicccia! Will be studying it this weekend.

I am still 30 pips up on my V3 trade :-)

--- 帖子 #804 ---
Thank you for publishing V4.   It looks very promising.   However, I have a few questions, if you don't mind:

1.  The default line colors are green, with a thickness of 5.  When I try to reduce them to 2, they stay that way for a while, but then a refresh makes them thickness 5 again.  Are these locked down to that setting, or will we be allowed to change them to suit our visual preferences?

2.  The settings section is all predefined.  Are these the optimal settings for the GU pair, and what options do we have here for other good values.

3.  I presume you're still advocating the use of the M30 time frame, correct?

Here is a screen shot off my system.  Does it look right to you?

Thanks,

Ed

--- 帖子 #805 ---
thks aicccia for ur version 4.1.. would definitely try it out.. was waiting for a EA to go with the indicator... that would be a perfect match.

but i think i will still use ver 3.1 for GBPUSD 30mins TF based on forexforex advice for entry and exit. What u think? may i know wat are the flaws in ver 3.1?

--- 帖子 #806 ---
I'll put out a quick update that will make the line thickness customizable.

These are close to the optimal settings for GBP/USD. I have never optimized the settings with a computer. As for other pairs, just mess around and find what works best. If the system is really good, then finding the perfect settings shouldn't be necessary.

I have never advocated the M30 timeframe. I have always advocated the M1 timeframe. The lower timeframe allows you to get in good trades sooner and out of bad trades quicker.

Yes.

--- 帖子 #807 ---
It can be used on any pair, but the settings would probably need to be tweaked for other pairs.

--- 帖子 #808 ---
I know 3.1 is tried and tested and I like forexforex method of using Carmen, but V4 is something else. In less than 45 mintes 54 pips!!! Just amazing. I would suggest that you use the two versions on two different charts.

By the way people please do read AICCCIA`s post 1. it seems V4 works on M1 TIME FRAME ONLY.

--- 帖子 #809 ---
Great! I appreciate that.

Got it.

Thanks very much for both the time frame clarification and for your hard work.  I appreciate the thought and professionalism you've displayed with your indicator.

A million thanks,

Ed Newbold

--- 帖子 #810 ---
Aicccia what do you think the best settings for the 30 min tf?

--- 帖子 #811 ---
Thank you very much aicccia! Although I use CARMEN in 30min, I have been using 1min as well.  Both charts are  promising.  I will definitely test your latest version.

Than you again, Aiccia...I already bagged hundreds  of pips using Carmen.

--- 帖子 #812 ---
Hi All,

How did you download the new version to your chart? I get a message that Windows cannot open the file.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #813 ---
Thanks very much. If and when you have spare time any suggestions and recommendations (e.g. suitable pairs and settings) would be greatly appreciated. You have done so much I feel guilty asking for more.

I also think that Forexforex`s approach to your system is the most suitable and any feedback from him would be most welcome.

Thanks once again.

Hello aicccia.

When I open my Metatrader, sometimes the alarm goes off incessantly - sounds like a machine gun or something. This happens even if I have the alarm set to 'off'. I then close Metatrader and re-open and the alarm doesn't go off anymore. Not sure what is going on. Also the way I changed thickness on the lines resets itself back to the default setting, colours stay the way I set them. And please, this is not complaining, just trying to help with the debugging.

Thanks again aicccia

--- 帖子 #820 ---
yeah, sorry about that. I've released a fix for that. v4.01 should have that problem corrected, but please let me know right away if it's still happening. v4.01 is on the first post.

--- 帖子 #821 ---
Thanks for the reply. Actually I am on version 4.0.1 and the resetting of the thickness still happens.

I think I figured out when the alarm bug happens. I am on dial up (trading the 1M on dial-up - can you imagine?), so each time I log onto internet with my Metatrader open, the alarm bells go off! :-)

--- 帖子 #822 ---
does the alarm still go off with v4.01? It's not going off here on my computer.

--- 帖子 #823 ---
when the MA cross the channel it does not appear in yellow each time...

as per your rules, it should be ..am i right ?

using 4.01

--- 帖子 #824 ---
aicccia,

I too was having trouble with the alert before the fix. It now appears to be fine.

A little clarification, please, on the MA colors:

Yellow = Enter trade

Green = Exit half position

Red = ?

Great job on the indy and many thanks!

--- 帖子 #825 ---
Hello aicccia,

The alarm doesn't seem to go off anymore, but it might have to do with that there is nothing going on on the chart anymore. We'll see how things are when markets open again on Sunday. The line thickness reverting back is still a problem. I've checked and double checked that I am on version 4.01.

Oh well, if I am the only one having problems with it, never mind. I can live with it.

--- 帖子 #826 ---
aicccia

thanks much for the indicator.  I, too, am having the lines reverting back to their original thickness.

--- 帖子 #827 ---
If this works, I reckon that it will not work for long.

Why?

Because as soon as a thousand or so people start taking the same identical trades and consistently making money, their combined presence in the market will start to weight it and the market will start to stall at Carmen levels and behave differently suddenly, and ultimately then start to go against Carmen trades.

I've noticed it time and time again with other good systems over the last 8 years.

Just watch and see.

--- 帖子 #828 ---
REALLY? Then just name a few.......

I find it really impossible in this huge market, with millions of players, over a thousand of brokers, big banks, etc. that even many traders like us have a chance to affect anything. It would be like dropping a drop of red ink in a swimming pool and expect the pool to become red....

Usually, when a system fails is because market conditions changed and a bad system can't follow it anymore.

--- 帖子 #829 ---
Carmen would have made sure you'd have stayed out of the trade at this chaotic period.

--- 帖子 #830 ---
Can anyone answer this query as I too am not too sure as to the rules as posted?

Don't marry for money. You can borrow it cheaper.

(anon)

--- 帖子 #831 ---
Yes,right,we are all making huge profits and we produced world crisis.All the money gone to retail traders pockets and that is why banks are broke.

But...we will keep fighting so keep the good work aicccia,maybe this one will work.

Try to add range lines (old support/resistance) when carmen turns red...it is better to buy low and sell high in those market conditions instead of standing aside and watching carmen lines was broken by 30 pips before reversing.

For 1 min time frame 20-30 pips are huge profit.

--- 帖子 #832 ---
Bombero red lines = exit trade and stand aside.

However if the channel has turned red, then simply exist the position, but do not open a new one.

***from first post,please read it before asking such questions***

--- 帖子 #833 ---
deepdrunk,

The question refers to the MA colors, not the Channel!

At this point it is not clear to me what the red MA color means since it was not referred to in the first post. If you look back on your chart you will see at times it turns red at some point after the channel turns red.

--- 帖子 #834 ---
CONCUR!!! I can just see the banks and hedgers dropping everything to go after the small trader because an indicator seems to be working well. HO HO HO MERRY CHRISTMAS!

--- 帖子 #835 ---
Hi Aicccia

I have just downloaded the new version. Many thanks for V4 my friend  http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

It looks as though you have been putting in many hours of work on this project, from the first carmen indi to V4.

I hope that you are also having the opportunity to be doing some trading yourself.

Once again thanks and hope that you enjoy Caren as much as we do.

--- 帖子 #836 ---
If everyone is buying(or selling) at the same time, this would cause the market go in the direction of our trades. What are you talking about?

But there is a secret about carmen that I have not talked about.

Imagine a "W".

Now imagine an "M".

They are the same symbol, just reversed.

Carmen can trade the market the same way. Just change a few settings and the lines will be completely different, but still profitable.

There have been several threads on forefactory about using high-level math to screen out the market noise and isolate the true signal/trend of the market. I don't believe there is only one true trend in the forex market, I believe there are hundreds. So who said we all had to trade the same trend?

For some, a slower daily trend is more attractive.

For others, they love the excitement of a hourly trend.

Maybe you feel more comfortable securing profit early.

Perhaps you believe in letting the "trend grow".

Trading styles are infinite, so to each his own.

With a few quick changes, carmen can do it all.

Dear Aicccia

You've done remarkable work with this new indicator and will it loaded on my charts next week.

I wondered if you still plan to pull together an EA, I know it was on the cards but maybe you've decided against the idea?

Unfortunately, I (like many others) have to work full time and can only dabble in some trading here and there so EA's do help a great deal for me and I am sure many others.  I believe that to make a living from currency trading (which ultimately I'd like to work towards) would require a very large capital base to work with.  I'm not there yet!...sadly.

Anyway thanks again for sharing your work and I'll continue to read this thread daily.

Warm Regards and Seasons Greetings,

Hi Deepdrunk, Both Big E and I asked a question which you attempted to answer however you must read the question properly before posting or you will once again give a totally wrong answer.

Can anyone else please answer us without refering us to the first post of a thread we have both been following and contributing to from the strt?

Many Thanks

"However if the channel has turned red, then simply exist the position, but do not open a new one. "

While the channel may already be red, warning you to not to open a new position, the MA doesn't turn red till it crosses through the opposite side of the channel from which the trade was opened. This signals the appropriate time to exit any remaining open position.

Sorry for the confusion.

--- 帖子 #840 ---
An answer from the main man!!!!

Thanks

--- 帖子 #841 ---
I'm planning for the EA to be next. I'm setting a tentative goal to have the first EA version out before the new year.

--- 帖子 #842 ---
Once again, another master piece by aicccia...thanks a million for your incredible effort.

I put the new indicator with default settings on 1min. cable chart, but the default colors are: olive, yellow and red. I assume when you refer to green color, it is actually olive...correct?

Also, do you recommend trading carmen during major news hours?

--- 帖子 #843 ---
Cheers Aicccia

I'll see if in the coming week I can make some pips with the indicator.  Still testing it on demo at the moment but I know others are using it live and they are usually pretty good at posting results on here.

All the best to you,

fxtrader08

aicccia I think I... love u

--- 帖子 #845 ---
Aiccia.... Just wanted to wish you and all the followers of this thread a Merry Christmas. We all appreciate the effort you are putting into this as well as your original concept. Regardless of our particular religious persuasion sharing is a commendable attribute in every one. Thank you for sharing.

--- 帖子 #846 ---
Let me see if I got the trade rules straight.

When the channel lines are Green and the MA turns yellow and moves outside the channel, open a new trade. If price is below the channel, open a sell. If it is above the channel, open a buy.

When the MA turns from yellow to green, close 50% of your position. Close the second 50% of the position when the MA crosses the channel again. (If the MA never changes from yellow to green, this means price has suddenly retraced.)

If the channel is still green when price passes through the opposite side of the channel, exit the position and open a new one in the opposite direction.

If the channel has turned red when price passes through the opposite side of the channel, exit the position and DO NOT open a new one. Stand aside and wait for the channel to turn green and the MA to turn yellow (and move outside the channel), again.

If the MA turns red and crosses through the opposite side of the channel from which the trade was opened, exit any remaining position. The channel may already be red, warning you not to open a new position.

Aiccia, please edit if anything is incorrect or needs clarification. I believe you have successfully achieved your goals (especially the 2 new ones) with this version! Much easier to use than the previous versions. Looks very promising based on backtesting.

--- 帖子 #847 ---
Thank you Aicccia, for your hard work.

Guys, question, how do I close 50% of my open order in MT4?

How to close position partially?

Let's say I open "Buy 0.40 lot", now I want to close 0.20 of that open position

And keep the rest 0.20 running?

Is there special script for it?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #848 ---
I just open 2 positions.

Here is the script:

How to close position partially?

Let's say I open "Buy 0.40 lot", now I want to close 0.20 of that open position

And keep the rest 0.20 running?

>  rightclick on your open order, select close

in pop-up window u enter 0.20(ur example)  in the "volume" tab

then close order and ur done.

--- 帖子 #851 ---
Thank you!

--- 帖子 #852 ---
Also, guys, you might want to check this script (Close and Reverse)

It's closing existing position and opens appositive direction one

with the same lot. So, if, you have let's say 0.10 lot Buy order

it should close it and open 0.10 Sell order on the same currency.,

Should be handy for Carmen actions. Test it on Demo first..

Or in our Case if you take 1/2 profit already then when you open appositive direction order

you want to close existing half and open half *2. I modified that line in the script

================

OrderSend(Symbol(), op, ordLots[i]*2, prc,5,0,0,ordComments[i]+"[Rev]");

===============

and now have 2 scripts one just Close and reverse the same Lot and another Close and revers double lot

make sure you have v4.01. There were one or two bugs that go released in the v4.00 version.

--- 帖子 #856 ---
Hi Jollyroger..

Do you combine this indicator with the MP 350 pips a day method  ?

im just wondering  wich system/method you think is best  ?

regards Lille...

--- 帖子 #857 ---
yup, i am using v4.01... but is it the same as what urs setup?

--- 帖子 #858 ---
Hi Lillelise....That's a tough question to answer and I'm not sure that this thread is the best place to do it. Carmen is both an indicator and a developing system. MP has taught me how to trade and to an extent how the market works. Right now I am using Carmen as an indicator but will trade it as a system when the EA becomes available. I cannot spend all the time required in front of a computer to trade Carmen for maximum success but the concept for an EA is fantastic. In trading I follow MP's teachings but use only some of his recommended indicaors having found several others that I prefer. I am still developing my trading style, plan and techniques.

Hope this answers your question. If you want to discuss this further please do so on the 350 thread in this forum since a discussion of my trading style here would be stepping on aiccia's toes so to speak.

Regards, Roger

--- 帖子 #859 ---
I just found this post and am interested in evaluating the Carmen V4.01 indicator. I have tried to download it from the first post but, although the file indicates it is an .ex4 file on the link, my computer recognizes it as a .php file. Could someone please re-post the indicator so I may evaluate it and contribute to the discussion on this thread?

--- 帖子 #860 ---
This is not so.  The world-wide foreign exchange market is so huge (hundreds and hundreds of billions changing hourly), that no small-scale operation such as a couple of hundred retail traders such as us could affect the market swings.  It's the big boys, the market movers (broker houses such as FXCM, etc.) who can affect the market in this manner.

Cheers.

--- 帖子 #861 ---
Ahh... perhaps you could offer a couple of suggestions regarding the "quick changes" we can make to Carmen.  I, for one, would like to experiment a bit with various settings, but don't know which ones to modify.  Thanks for any advice you might have to offer in this area.

Merry Christmas!

Ed

--- 帖子 #862 ---
aicccia,

Thanks as always for sharing and your hard work.  One problem I have is being able to distinguish between the green and the red.  I fooled with the colors a bit but when I made the changes it seemed to affect how the indicator changes colors.  Any suggestions?

PT

--- 帖子 #863 ---
first, thanks so much aiccia for the newest and best yet indicator, which seems even better than the previous ones. Can anyone point out which thread Jollyroger was refferring to in a recent post on the forum to help in combining aspects of with Carmen -

thanks alot

--- 帖子 #864 ---
The thread is Mp -- 350 Pips Daily And All The Ice Cream You Can Eat ! on this forum. This is the last time I mention this thread on Carmen since it really has nothing to do with Carmen and I don't wish to intrude on Aiccia's thread. The thread is no longer active since the thread starter was suspended from FF.

Hi, i place e indicator again on a GBPUSD 1Min TF.. but however it seems to have all the same color... (see attached), is there anything wrong? thanks

--- 帖子 #866 ---
My chart looks about the same as yours. I don't think there is anything wrong - Carmen is just trying to keep us out of trouble.

--- 帖子 #867 ---
Hello Aicccia,

Below are the all possible scenario in concise form. Could you please confirm if it is correct.

Green Channel with MA turns Yellow outside the channel – Enter trade.

Green Channel with Yellow MA turns Green – Close half position.

Green Channel with Yellow/Green MA passes through opposite side of channel – Close remaining positions and open a new trade in the opposite direction.

Red Channel with Green/Yellow MA  passes through opposite side of channel – Close remaining positions and Stand aside.

Red Channel with Red MA – Stand aside.

Having fun tonight watching and learning as Carmen does what she does. Aiccia, is there any way to be pair-specific in the pop-up alert when she tells us to close our positions and open a new trade - like she does when its time to open a new trade?

--- 帖子 #869 ---
Hello Aicccia,

Here is my first live trade.

According to the rule, MA should turn from Yellow to green based on Quick_profit parameter which has 8 pips as default value.

As you can see from the attached pic, price has moved downwards for more than 20 Pips after the entry (Red Arrow), but it hasn't turned green yet. I had to manually closed my half position for 15 pips.

Am I missing something.

Regards

--- 帖子 #870 ---
Channel Turned red. MA turned red (Gray circle). Out with remaining position with 15 pips

15 + 15 = 30 Pips.

Is this correct?

Regards

--- 帖子 #871 ---
Hi Aicccia,

perhaps a small change on the next update :

Sometimes the Alarm window doesnt show which curreny pair is ment.

Its only clear if you open the the expert window....

Where can i download Carmen v4.01?? The attached file carmen eyes.ex4 is only 13.8kb. I guess that that file is only a update and not the program???

Hey badpojken, look up "indicators in metatrader" in google to help develop your understanding of it's file system and how indicators work

--- 帖子 #874 ---
Just to report that CARMEN seems to be working quite nicely with other pairs.

GBP CAD SHORT 110pips 10:15GMT

EURGBP LONG 20pips 11:10 GMT.

The other pais (e.g. JPY) seem to be responding OK as well. The EA is surely missed.

Thanks once again to the creator of this lovely lady "CARMEN".

Hi Astral, i just put this on a EURGBP 1MIN TF, but how come i see nothing? please see attached... so there are only 3 colors to see rite?

Hi Guys, im a newbie and now testing this indicator on my demo account.. what about SL? i cannot find any information on setting up SL level on the 1st page..

Does it mean that we dont need to set SL when using this indicator?

--- 帖子 #877 ---
HI

You are right that there were only three colours (no yellow confirmation), If I see direction candles and no change of colour to yellow I will take the trade. I notice from your chart that the indicators were RED in colour when movement started however, on my platform it had turned Olive earlier. I have noticed that the indicator looks slightly different with different brokers ( I have it running on FXCM, Forex.com& IBFX). Please see attached which is from Forex.com account.

regards

--- 帖子 #878 ---
HI

It is noteworthy that Carmen seems to preform as well in other pairs for instance this nice 10 pip LONG in EURCHF less than 45 minutes ago. Please bear in mind that the creator of Carmen has created this for GBPUSD only and one should not deviate from that. However, for future developments we should collect enough data to identify other suitable pairs as well.

--- 帖子 #879 ---
Hi Aicccia

you have created something quite unique here. I have been testing it during the London session all day today with 14 different pairs. I like the feature of constantly reminding you with messsages (i.e. close position, marekt ranging, etc), to keep out of trouble. The system demands constant price watch and for most of us who have jobs the EA would be very useful. I guess the EA would also stop people from jumping the gun and taking chances when the market conditions are not optimum.

Just one question, sometime it comes with message "open a NEWS Trade". What is meant by this?

Regards

--- 帖子 #880 ---
Hi Bolloqz

Stop loss is not recomended for this system, as you should always monitor your position, and exit from it as per carmen's instructions. Read and re-read the first post and make sure you understand it well !!

Sotos

--- 帖子 #881 ---
You must always always have Stop Loss, in case of connection problems, etc. Stop Loss is subjective and people disagree what should be the stop loss. Some people use support / resistance levels , some use a % of the ATR and some put the entry + or - certain number of PIPS (e.g if profit target is 30 pips S/L 15 pips). So there is no set rule.

I hope this helps, although there are many contributors who are more experinced than me and may ahve better suggestions.

Observing carmen on the side-line until next year...looking good so far.

Based on aicccia's system rule, hope I made the correct observation on the attached cable 1min. chart...

--- 帖子 #884 ---
I think that must be it. I must have left my brain somewhere!!! It is saying a anew trade. However, since this was designed for GBPUSD and I am running other pairs on it the alert does not say which pair and have to go through them one by one. I do not know how practical it is or indeed possible to add the name of the pair to the alert.

--- 帖子 #885 ---
thanks guys.. --> sotos n astral77 for the reply n advice

--- 帖子 #886 ---
sorry guys, but i need your  advice here..

when i change my chart to 1min TF the chanel line dissapeared. But on other higher TF it works fine.. any advice?

thanks

--- 帖子 #887 ---
Try Zooming Out.

Maybe you can see the Channel in TF 1min

--- 帖子 #888 ---
I understand that this system has been created specifically for GBP/USD and the 1min timeframe.  However as a test I have this indicator loaded on 18 different currency pairs - each with two or three different chart timeframes. From my initial observations (and not serious backtesting) over the last few days Carmen would seem to have worked with the majority of pairs on the 1hr and 15min timeframes. By "work" I simply mean buying when the line goes above the channel (either green or yellow line), and exit or sell when the line goes through the bottom of the channel.  No trade if the channel is red, and no selling half size.

The occassions that it didn't work the losses were kept small by exiting when the line crossed the other side of the channel. Conversely when it does go into profit the system lets them run thereby enabling the gains to far outway the losses.

An extreemly choppy day could result in a loss, however I believe that under standard trading conditions this system has real potential. Like others have commented it lends itself to an EA, due to the need to watch until it exits the other side of the channel.  This is especially true of the longer timeframes which can be in a trade for a number of days.

Just my initial observation for what it's worth.

Cheers

Hi Guys,

For some reason version 4.01 doesnt download correctly on my Computer? It downloads as a Attachment PhP file? Mt4 doesnt reconize it when I try to compile it?

I had trouble too. I saved to documents than dragged and dropped to indicators , works fine now. hope that helps

--- 帖子 #891 ---
LOL. yeah at the last minute I relized I'd only put in alerts for when to open a trade, but forgotten about alerts for closing a trade. I'll fix the typos and make the alerts more specific tonight. thanks for the heads-up.

thats exactly right.

Nope still doesnt work. I have no clue what to do? When I download it this is what is says

Name: attachment. php

Type: Application, 13.7KB

From: cdn.forexfactory.com

I figure it doesnt work because it is recognized as a attachment. php file? Even though it is cleary posted as an carmens eyes v4.01.ex4

I honestly no clue on how to get it to work, I have done everything I know and still have come up short. By chance is version 4.01 an MQ5 Indicator?

In advance thanks for the help

Clayton

--- 帖子 #894 ---
the indicator will look slightly different depending on the amount of history for the timeframe you've put it on. If you have very little history then it might look very different.

--- 帖子 #895 ---
its a typo, it should be "open a new trade". sorry about the confusion, I'll put out a fix soon.

--- 帖子 #896 ---
Sure. I've ranked the settings in the order of how strongly they affect the indicator. For a slower system that makes trades less frequently, increase the expand_rate settings. Start_trending and Xindi_period determine the red, no trading periods of the indicator. breakeven_rate and expand_rate_1 control the channel's distance from the price at the beginning of a trade.

start_trending

breakeven_rate
expand_rate_1
Main_expand_rate_2
Main_expand_rate_3

bufferplus
Xindi_period
start_at_pips_profit_2
start_at_pips_profit_3.
start_at_pips_profit_3

--- 帖子 #897 ---
Clayton, this is a problem associated with Internet Explorer. Download the file then change tne .php to .ex4 then just drag and drop it to the indicators folder. I find this usually works

--- 帖子 #898 ---
Based on aiccia rules, what happens if the MA is yellow throughout? should we exit or remains? cos from the attachment, once the MA is outside the channel line, should do a buy then now is all yellow.... what is the decision? thanks

--- 帖子 #899 ---
Primarily thanks to the author for the great work!

I have tried to receive values of the indicator through iCustom () and have found out the following. Received values are equal in the work beginning to values of the indicator on the chart. And through any operating time of value from the buffer 1 and 2 (the top and a channel bottom) start to differ that is drawn on the chart (7-15 pip). Looked in a tester and on an operating chart. Besides, if through any operating time to enter into properties of the indicator and, without changing them, to leave, lines of the indicator (channel) change the position.

If it is necessary, I will try to put drawings.

Why the such can be? Thanks.

For creation EA it is very important.

I apologise for my English...

--- 帖子 #900 ---
#1:

Initial trade would have been long, but it turned out a false breakout, as MA reversed back under the channel, so you close long, and open a new short position...MA never closed above the channel, so short looks good so far...

#2:

Here, you have already closed your 50% of short for 10pips, and set the rest to breakeven. I don't know why channel(and MA) both turned red here, but I assume carmen is telling us, that prices are ranging now. So you have two choices: exit all your position, or trail your SL...it's up to you.

#3:

Prices are in ranging condition indicating, eihter support has been found, or a pause for a move down again. Both Channel and MA are green, so another trading opportunity is on the horizon.

How would you trade this?

--- 帖子 #901 ---
Thanks for the help, I got it. I just used Firefox. Damn Interent Explorer

--- 帖子 #902 ---
The channel is there. You just can't see it because price is to far away from it. Click and hold on the vertical scale (Price, far right of chart) and scroll.

--- 帖子 #903 ---
oh no...i trade long with 1 lot when the MA is out of the channel. (see attached) and i set SL at 20 pips and it hits my SL..

how do i prevent this? thanks

--- 帖子 #904 ---
Hi KP

I am confused by your post. What was your entry ?

--- 帖子 #905 ---
Hi,

is anyone being flooded with alerts like i am? everytime i open MT4 it blocks because 1001 alerts are being given contemporarily, all carmen 4.01.

Just me?

other than that, great indi as expected.

Thanks Aicccia,

Wendy

--- 帖子 #906 ---
Hi Wendy

yes I have same problem but I just restart and is ok for a bit

--- 帖子 #907 ---
I am also trying to figure out what would be the optimum initial SL when you have pressed that buy/sell order...there is no definit answer, and you have to use the stop level which is in your comfort zone.

Here is my observation, and if aicccia agrees with me:

When trading the 1min. chart, carmen telling us to only focus on three variables:

1- MA (when changing color),

2- Channels (when MA cross them, and changing color)

3- Closing prices to confirm the above two's

So you enter long when MA changed to yellow, and crossed above the green channel, and vice versa for short...if the yellow MA reverse back and close below the green channel, and change color, you must take the loss...this loss can range anywhere betwen 6pips (slow moving market)...up to 40 pips (in a very fast, volatile moving market).

So you need to pay attention to the closing of that yellow MA, when in a trade. Carmen on the last trade could give us 10-15 pips profit.

--- 帖子 #908 ---
...and look what carmen telling us:

--- 帖子 #909 ---
dont use a stoploss.

--- 帖子 #910 ---
Hi aicccia

Will the EA allow you trade the 30 min tf? And will you able to set a custom stop loss?

--- 帖子 #911 ---
Hi aicccia,

MA never turned from green to yellow, but it crossed the green channel...would this be a short trade?

--- 帖子 #912 ---
I too am having an alert problem. For me, about every hour of so, the alert goes off and continues with an incessant clanking sound for 10, 15, 20 minutes. Then the bell rings, it stops and works fine until it goes berserk again. This continues even if I restart platform.

P.S. Does anyone know how to turn off the edit icon. I appear to be the only poster with it showing and I don't have a clue as to how I turned it on. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #913 ---
aicccia make carmen indicator display text referring to FF or it being free or something? To really prevent it being sold because it can't be edited and everyone would know it's free

--- 帖子 #914 ---
Is there yet a way in which one can change the line thickness? They are bit too wide covering my candles - I've been changing them manually, but, they always revert back each time a time frame is changed.  Thanks.

In the Inputs setting, I simply set all three alerts (Play_Sound, Send_Email, Show_Message) to FALSE.  I just observe the action and trade manually without the noise or popup alerts.

these thin market conditions are difficult to trade, it's tradeable but be very cautious!

Admittedly I popped a mini lot on euro after carmen hinted yellow and broke out of its range yesterday.  I TP at 80 pips but it went nearly twice that.  It was quite amazing.  If only it was a standard lot.

Thanks again aicccia!

--- 帖子 #925 ---
hi there guys,new to this,i'm confused wich system we are suppose to be using the the v4 or the v2 i keep seeing different systems up

--- 帖子 #926 ---
Hi forexforex,

are u still using ver 3.1 on a 30MIN TF?

--- 帖子 #927 ---
Cable yesterday was sideways, untradeable.  Look for something that is moving, like E$ did yesterday.  Carmen worked beautifully!

--- 帖子 #928 ---
Yes i am still using Ver 3.1 on 30 min TF with success in the crossover, rejection and reentries (15min TF I have been using it as well with greater success...I will need to test it more next year when the market has better liquidity).  Ver 4 does not allow us to manipulate or adjust the ave setting.

I would like to post my trades but, I am not sure if Aiccia would not mind.  We have to ask the owner's permission or permission to create another thread for the purpose of trading the 15/30min TF only.  I still think that the crossovers make significant indications of developing trends and so far it is safer to take trades there and minimizing the loss.

I have to admit that I have had losses, but the wins outweighs the losses  Most of the losses happens when the market is trending. But the losses were minimized by SMA 7 I have been experimenting.

I wish that Aiccia would also take into consideration the higher TFs.  It appears that Aiccia incorporates the higher TF methodology with the 1 min TF (not sure if that makes sense to you), but I am visual person and the 15/30 TF clearly shows what I need to make the determination if the trades are warranted.

The disadvantage of the Ver 3 is that I have of close/reopen MT4 (or as it was suggested to right-click on the indicator, select properties and click OK) every time the candle closes and the indicator readjusts.  I do not really mind doing this.  What I am just looking for is the crossover.  When it crosses over the indicator becomes stable.

I won't be trading the rest of the year as it is risky due to low liquidity.  So I will just see you all next year.

Happy New Year to all!!!

--- 帖子 #929 ---
i am also trading on 30 Mins TF for ver 3.1 but never get to try on 15 Mins TF...maybe i start to take a look at 15 Mins TF... so still using the same strategy? when the line crosses, wait till the 3rd candle? What do you see by SMA7? can give an example? thanks

--- 帖子 #930 ---
yo, try to keep the thread alive... anyone can come out with EA on this?

--- 帖子 #931 ---
Thanks alot Alicia for your effort and help for all of us here.

I do like the way carmen indicator its work amazing on all time frames, I even like so much V3.1 work very well

I hope if some one can make EA for V3.1 on the following settings:

we will use the blue line only with ema 5

EA will open for example buy close half of the position after 10 pips TP and the other half close it when ema touch again the blue line

when the ema 5 cross again the blue line open sell but incres the position size this way ( 1,2,3,4,5)  --- first trade open position with 1 lot the second 2 lots the 3rd 3 lots

I hope some one can do this EA will work great

* position open when ema5 touch the blue line and after the candle close!!

Thanks

Hi Paulus,  Nice seeing you here.  I have, in fact, found this system to be profitable on the 5M time frame.  Although the author has designed it to be optimal on the 1M charts, a number of us have adapted it to run on either 5M or 30M charts.  I must admit, however, that I use an additional indicator (4x3 Semafor Alert) to help me quickly identify price action directional changes (swings).  I also like your system, but have become very comfortable with this one.  Cheers and Happy New Year, Ed

hi Paulus

here its about GU

--- 帖子 #935 ---
In looking at the chart I can't help wondering what system you are using and how you are trading it. It is certainly not being traded according to the rules laid down by Aiccia in his thread here. Perhaps an explanation would show us how this relates to the Carmen Indicator or if it is a different system it should have a thread of it's own.

--- 帖子 #936 ---
Hi Jolly,

I use Carmen indy v3.1 as alicia's rules but I just consider one line not the whole channel which is between yellow and blue...

in the attached previous pictures I hide the yellow, orange and red lines and just trade the blue, changing the ema from 3 to 5 to minimize the open trades, for me I feel its better to use EMA5 than EMA3 on 5 minutes charts.

the system is perfect on 1 minutes chart but I prefer to work with it on >1tf I dont like to open many trades!, on 5 minutes chart in good moving days you open only 1 up to 4 trades per day. on 30m less trades but bigger stop loss!

I think the idea of Alicia using the 1m chart as she mentioned is to reduce the loses to 0 or for little loses as she can incase there is no profits!! so that is why she stuck with 1m chart, you get bigger TF you have bigger SL.

im very interested in carmen and I do try to find something that improve this system but now days market is slow and tyt moves so maybe next month we find secondary idea and see Alicia opinion about it.

oh here is the picture, same as above with full indy lines..

--- 帖子 #937 ---
Thank's for the explanation. The fact that there was only a single line showing fooled me. My understanding of the double line was to cut down on the reversals. I will play around with your technique and see what I come up with. By the way I think that Aiccia is a "he" and not a "she" (not that it makes any difference regarding his work). I'm currently working with both the 3.1 and the 4.1 versions and if I have something positive to contribute to the thread I will post it here. Like most of the rest of us I believe that the "method" will trade better with an EA since it will eliminate having to constantly monitor the computer but I think that Aiccia is realy on to something here ad I appreciate his sharing it with us.

--- 帖子 #938 ---
Yea ,, you welcome Jolly I see now about Aiccia he is M not F hehe!! well sorry for misunderstand western names.

yea I wish if there EA for Carmen. with increasing lot size after each trade (1,2,3,4....

Hi  Maanawi,

I consider your fine tuning to the Carmen system interesting and would like to try out your style as Ihave been hunting for the indicator or whatever paints the triangle patches. Also, it would be great if you can also share the other alert indicator you mentioned. Thanks for sharing.l

I managed to download indicator from the paperclip (it seems to overide the Carmen original as was asked if Iwould like to replace it.

which I clicked 'yes'.

The template too I downloaded into IBFX and FX Solution MTY-4 platforms the  usual way thru paperclip.

Happy New Year and Happy Pipping to all.

However, upon opening both platforms I cant find the indicator nor the template.  What do u think is the problem.

HAPPY NEW YEAR and HAPPY PIPPING TO ALL!

Could you please explain what could be the for this indicator?

Thank you

Hi
I have been following this thread from it’s start and I find your adjustment in the chart presentation more positive but I have one problem is how to differentiate when the price  reaches the blue line , and I am considering placing a position ,between whether the price will continue through the line or simply bounce off . How do you handle this situation ?

--- 帖子 #943 ---
Thanks for that I'm trying to find within the thread what the blue and yellow thick horizontal lines are based on..could any one tell me please

Cheers

Paulus

--- 帖子 #944 ---
I dont know what to advice you about this, your question is hard, like if im trading 32 EMA and when price bounce back of it what could I do... I think I will be at this time in trade with the direction of the EMA or I will not take the trade.

--- 帖子 #945 ---
Hi Paulus,

Nice to hear from you again.  Alicia has shared this wonderful indicator having different versions.  The blue line was made thick by the trader above by chnaging the line size in the indicator.  I do not know how Alicia coded the indicator, but my understanding was that he used some optical illussion technique to code the indicator.  He is not sharing the code for the new indicator; however, he shared the code for the previous versions.

The indicator sort of moves like the trend magic indicator in some sense.  I am not saying that it is trend magic.  But anyway the indicator is very good at producing huge pips to counter balance the losses in the whipshaws.  If there was an EA to trade the system it would have awesome.  Alicia and many people here are trying different ways of using the indicator to overcome the whipshaws.  So if you wanna throw in an input I believe Alicia would not object.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #946 ---
I am using Carmen 3.1 in the chart.  I took the sell trade because the M5 and H1 agree.  Let's see how it works itself out.

--- 帖子 #947 ---
Thanks I tend to try and capture the move alot sooner than it happens using this ind...BUT ..... when the signal takes off its because the trend has established itself perhaps ? From what I have read its above the blue to buy and break down through the yellow to sell..I have divided the 2 lines in half to give me a mean average..

I like it no descion making

Not wishing to change any thing here just adding a few ideas...

I have been looking to enter using a stoch its a method I use allot and 7 times out of 10 gives me a good fill.

I have inc screen shots of signals on 3 of the 4 swaps Im following

It seems to me most of the signals occur on either quite large up or down candles or spikes when the parallel lines are breached I feel a bit uncomfortable with this as I dont really like taking a short signal at the bottom of a big red bar that breached the lower line by 10 or 15 pips.

I wait for the stoch to come up and break 50 the 1st screen shot shows how it works..

I havnt had long enough to gauge all the sigs but its looks workable and gives a far better fill..

Hello all,

Just chking the thread to see if there is any update as this is the time to really rest and allow the PC to rest too....lol.

This is a great contribution from maanawi and I hope to try it out in the new year.

Just looking at chart...just for fun, I can see that using maanawi's idea on the carmen 3.1, GU would have giving a whooping 200+ pips from yesterday...thats a whaooo.

Its also good to have paulus on the thread, ur experienced contribution is well appreciated.

Happy new year to you all and I pray that year 2010 will bring lots of pis to us all.

Hello Paulus,

many tests and indicators but still show that carmen by it self work like hero, its really place it self in most right places every time, and its has its own secret for me I willing to work on it like its only cause other indicators will confuse me Aiccia also said he want the system to be based on one idicator only.

I wish if some one can do the EA as setting I mentioned and here some pictures explain how EA should be.

Welcome back Paulus

--- 帖子 #961 ---
Good morning, Paulus.  I see you're tracking these pairs with v3.1, but I have been using v4.1 in combination with a semafor alert and CCI to get me into and out of trades.  I like the M15 timeframe because I can see things more clearly.  Here are two screen shots of my set up, where you can pretty clearly see where to BUY or SELL depending on the alerts. Until aiccia comes up with a usable EA, this is how I'm going to continue.

Cheers,

Ed

--- 帖子 #962 ---
Hello Ed,

Very nice post and very much appreciated. Would you be kind enough to post your template & other items that you mentioned besides the very nice carmen indicator? I already have the Carment indicator from the first post and it is indeed impressive. I would be very grateful if you would do that.

Regards,

Jeff

--- 帖子 #963 ---
If it's OK with aiccia, here is my template and other indicators (Carmen v4.1 is on the first post.)

But if not, aiccia, please let me know and I'll remove them from this thread.

Hello Ed,

Many thanks for this. You are truly a giver just like aiccia is a wonderful giver.

Hi Enewbold,

What is the settings for the semafor indicator? I tried to use the template but for some strange reasons, the semafor did not attach with it...

Many thanks.

--- 帖子 #966 ---
I just use the default settings of:

Period1 5.0

Period2 12.0

Period3 35.0

...and all other setting I leave at the defaults.

Ah, well, I did change the color settings to the following

0 Green width 2

1 Red width 2

2 Yellow width 2

3 Blue width 2

4 White width 5

5 Magenta width 5

I didn't really like the big fat dots the original was displaying (smile).

You do know after copying the files and templates into place that you have to exit the MT4 platform and restart it, right?

Cheers,

Ed

--- 帖子 #967 ---
Hi pally,

Thanks.....

On restarting MT4, that goes without saying...lol

Will test it out...

Very good contribution...and its self explainatory...i hope

Market has been moving slowly, the spread is higher on my broker last night it was -8 for GU on my broker, i did not go around just made a small BBQ party in the garden, my broker was open so i did trade for fun.

just played on M1 with carmen and she danced pretty well, she showed her good movement  in new year eve, I love the V.3 any way, the blue and yellow line like EMA 200 as my trend setter.

Happy New Year 2010 and..good luck guys.. success in 2010

--- 帖子 #972 ---
enewbold

Thanks for the template.  Do you scalp or do you use some other method for exiting?

--- 帖子 #973 ---
Yes, I agree that it is simply a trend change alert and should not be used exclusively for entry/exit conditions. I look at the M1, M5, M30 and H1 time frames, check to see what Carmen is indicating, look at the stoch, CCI and semafor alet indis, then make my entry/exit decisions.

I sometimes scalp the M1 time frame, especially if the market is very active, but most often use the M30 for longer term trades, where the market is ranging but still slowly trending in a definite direction.

Well folks, it is January 1, 2010.  Here's hoping we can continue with Carmen, get a reliable EA developed, and then make a good living trading!

Happy New Year!

Aicccia's trying to code the EA virtually by himself, he could do with a bit of help.

Here's the thread:

At least go on to it an comment so the thread will get some attention and hopefully someone will sort it out

Hey guys, I have some sad news.

I finished the EA and backtested it. And no matter how good the results are over the last 3 months, it always looses money when I forward test it.

I've been messing with indicators and EAs for 4 years now and today I'm finished with them. Like the real pros say, it just isn't worth it. I'll be trading with just trendlines, fibos and round numbers now, which is probably something I should have started doing a long time ago.

thanks for the support on this thread and others, I'll see you guys on the other side.

--- 帖子 #976 ---
hi aiccia, so u r saying goodbye to carmen? i thought is great? rather than a EA, maybe we can use it manually? do u think is still worth it?

--- 帖子 #977 ---
Aicccia dont throw the baby out with the bath water carmin is a great indy it just comes back to how you choose to use it.

It probably will loose money if you take every swing back and forth

I will definitely be using it but not every signal only as a confirmation of a new trend developing in conjunction with swingmans trio avg meter v4

--- 帖子 #978 ---
Hello. I aways did this process. And you are high inteligent. Please, try this : fti - technical analysis fallacy. Regards

--- 帖子 #979 ---
Hi Aicccia,

Can you post the EA? I found it really works well on the 30 min tf. When the markets trending, Carmen gets you into the trend, when the markets moving sideways, it manages losses perfectly.

I understand you want to trade using support and resistance, fibs etc (I know that is how the professional's trade). But you can use all these important analysis tools(I do) along with one good indicator (Carmen).

--- 帖子 #980 ---
Aiccia, I would personally like to thank you for the time and effort you have devoted to Carmen. I think she is one grand lady. The ea would have been nice, but like I said in an earlier post, you have given us a gift, and I thank you for "her". I will continue to treat her like a lady. She has been good to me. Good luck with your future efforts with programming/forex. See you down the road............

--- 帖子 #981 ---
Hi Aiccia,

It is really a sad news for me to hear that you are no longer developing Carmen.

I had success with 15min or 30 min charts.  I just use it as an indicator for me to use to indicate a change of trend. With your permission, if I may...to continue using  Carmen V3.1   . I just would like to share with people here how Carmen can be used   in another tangent

--- 帖子 #982 ---
Same here, it works good on 30 min TF. Why don't you let us try the EA? People here might find it useful in their trading.

--- 帖子 #983 ---
Hi aicccia

Do not give up my friend, I guess you are fed up and depressed because you tried to do evrything by yourself, the community at forexfactory is full of fantastic and giving people and they can help. Few of us are trading using CARMEN very successfuly, however, due to work commitments we can not sit front of screen for long time and we do need the EA.

I will ask Stevehopwood to have a look at your thread. If he chooses to help please co-operate with him he is a fantastic EA maker and if he shows an interest there may be a great EA here.

Regards

P.S. I have sent a pm to steve asking for his consideration. For those who do not know his work visit ( http://www.forexfactory.com/search.php?searchid=8708941 ). He has a very big following, I think it is a good idea for aicccia himself to contact Steve and see if he would consider helping.

--- 帖子 #984 ---
Well said.  I agree Steve is one fantastic coder.  I think the best way would have been to post an unfinished EA so that the FF community could try to help with editing the EA.

Warm Regards,

Like I said a while back..  you may as well draw a horizontal line midway across the screen and sell whenever price crosses below it and buy when price crosses above it.

If it worked for a while it was pure coincidence.

Everyone is trying to find reason and rhyme and explanation in something that in the immediate term is totally random and unpredictable. You can't and won't. Stop driving yourself crazy looking for it.

Nothing can predict the future. So what if price has retraced to 50% of blah blah blah. There is no rule that says it will then go one way or the other.

I know it's human nature to want something for nothing and to live in hope of finding it, though I just can't belive there are so many people who obviously seriously genuinely believed thie whole Carmen thing was going to lead anywhere in this regard.

I hope no one gave up their day job.

I think everyone needs to get it into their head (they will be all the richer for it if they do) that there are no short cuts or magic bullet in this life.

How can you possibly think that one guy on some forex forum could discover the financial holy grail when banks with billions haven't?

It's no wonder there are so many scams happening and Madoff type characters around.. because people really are gullible fools.

Stop living in hope and wake up to reality is the only holy grail you will take away from here.

Even Accaccia has finally had the common sense (except he still thinks there's merit in trend lines etc.) to finally awaken from the dellusional belief that the financial holy grail can be discovered.

If this in itself isn't a strong enough message to everyone, then learn you will never.

The "pro's" (if such a person exists) must have a real laugh reading these forums and all the desperate living in hope/fantasy land comments that people post.

Sure, some of you will think I'm being negative, though anyone who does obviously just can't let go and face reality.

For those who can't, I suggest you ask yourself if you know of anyone, anyone at all, who makes real money in forex?

If you do, the answer will undoubtedly be "NO"!

--- 帖子 #986 ---
tahiti,

If you got nothing to say something positive, please keep it to yourself. If you got nothing to contribute to FF, please keep your reality therapy  to yourself.  Why don't you show to us how you are surviving in the forexworld.  If you feel that people don't gain from forex, why bother being in FF.  Please inject your negative remarks somewhere else.  I am sure that many people here in FF find this forum beneficial to them.

--- 帖子 #987 ---
A. His handle is aiccia.

B. No one except you has had thoughts about a "holy grail" here.

C. You've offered nothing worth reading to our FF community.

D. I see you've made a whopping 12 posts on FF. I seriously doubt you are an expert in the area of foreign currency trading or that anyone seriously considers anything you've written.

E. Go preach your negativity somewhere else.

Happy new year to everyone.

I just wondered why aiccai have decided to stop the work he started. Personally, I will like to say a big thank you for the work you have done so far on carmen. Even if I have to be trading it manually, it is still a great work from you. Thanks so much. On behalf of all those who have enjoyed carmen, I will like to say thanks.

I also want to say thanks to all those who have contributed positively to this thread. Pls dont let this thread die.

I wish I know how to code, but I trust that we will get an EA for this system.

I wish you all success in this year 2010.

--- 帖子 #991 ---
hahahaha, as I predicted.. dreamers abound.

just think back on my words in years to come when you realise how futile this period has been and how much time and money you've spent.

oh, I think there are actually a lot of people living in hope of finding the financial holy grail. When people ask "why did my trade lose even though I followed the system rules", as though there exists some logical explanation for why the "random" and unpredictable forex market generated a losing trade for them, it's a good indication of their expectations.

The reason I've made no "worthy" contributions is because there is nothing worthy to contribute.. indicators just don't work. You simply cannot predict or anticipate the future in forex. Contributing would only fuel the bonn fire of hope that rages in forums like this.

Another thing to ponder if you're still persisting with living in hope: to this day why isn't there one single trade room or signal service that makes money??????  I mean, there's not even one that you can name.

The answer is obvious and if you refuse to accept it and persist with this wild goose chase, to the person who mentioned my "poor kids": it would be better for kids in general if all the parents in here instead spent this time with their kids instead of exiling themselves to their computer screen.

These forums are like being in an Amway meeting or a religious cult.. everyone is a believer despite obvious facts to the contrary.

When the maker of this system after hundreds if not thousands of hours has decided there is no point in continuing, and has been exploring indicators and EA's for 4 years, it's incredible that the message and reality just doesn't sink in.

--- 帖子 #992 ---
with all due respect, are you a trader ?

--- 帖子 #993 ---
Hi Tahiti,

Why not keep your opinion to yourself. Rather than be negative, its better to just keep off.

Remember in history before the trains were built, everyone said it cannot be done...finally, it was done and the challenge was to apply the brakes. The people again said, once it start to move, it cannot stop. What do we have today??....

Also remember that it was said that a blackman can never become the president of the US...what do we have today???

Because it has not worked for you does not mean it will not work for others.

For your info.....am trading with carmen on my live account...and am not only breaking even, but making money.

Negative comments are not welcomed....especially in this new year of success.

--- 帖子 #994 ---

Why don't you create your own thread and tell us what you know and share with us what you have gathered during your trading tenure?

If you don't want contribute any of your alleged non-indicator ideas at least, please get your face out of FF.

--- 帖子 #996 ---
Yes, 8 years.

Though I've learned you can't make money from forex in the short term, for reasons stated.

The only way I believe it's possible to make money in forex is with big positions with big TP's and SL's held over long periods and to be right about your bet as to direction and to have made the bet based on fundamentals in the first place.

Hence, forex is typically out of reach of the small guy.

I believe technicals were invented as a ruse to (again) attempt to offer a plausible explanation for random and unpredictible activity and events occuring in the short term in forex so as to keep the bonn fire of hope alive among those who persist in living in it. Technicals are very successful in this regard because people will inherently try and make the price action "fit" into the technical model, even though it generally doesn't, or alternatively people will distort the technicals so as to make the price action appear to have fitted.

--- 帖子 #997 ---
the real holy grail is trendlines and fibos, everyone knows that. The problem is trading trading with trendlines is incredibly difficult to teach a computer to do, so people try to figure out other trading strategies that are simpler to program. Luckily I know how to trade with trendlines and fibos so I'll just go back to that.

--- 帖子 #998 ---
Hey thats not the problem. I made the EA  and it works just like it's supposed to. The problem is that in the long run the small losses outweight the gains. the core strategy is the problem. I suggest everyone learn to trade trendlines and fibos. Trade just off weekly, daily, 4H, and 1H charts and you'll only need to spend 15 minutes at the end of the day reviewing your charts.

--- 帖子 #999 ---
The reason so many of us in this thread do not want to see the end of your creation is that it has been quite successful for us. The only drawback is the high volume of Screen time needed and that would have been solved by the EA.
Of course you are right, support resistance, Fibonacci and chart patterns are the basics of this game, your indicator had touched upon something special and I think you are now in state of depression after devoting so many valuable hours to this project.
Sometimes someone looking from different angle may be able to come up with a solution. Stevehopwood (please see his EAs, he programming abilities is simply incredible). I sent him a pm and he said he needs more information and he may be able to help. So what have you got to lose please give it one more try and after that I will leave you in peace.

kind regards

--- 帖子 #1000 ---
Thank you for reply. Whilst I respect your right to your own opinion I disagree with most of what you have to say, as a full time TA trader for more than 6 years. We all know that there is no "holy grail" but healthy discussion with informed input is a good thing for most novice traders. I fail to understand what a fundamentalist hopes to gain by input to a technical thread.

I wish you the very best fortune with your trading, pehaps you have a thread relative to your style ? if so I would be most interested for direction to it.

--- 帖子 #1001 ---
so you seriously think trendlines are invalid? wow

yeah Jacko, Merlin...there many others but they don't post here anymore. Goldman Sachs, BOA, UBS...

I have one thing to say to you: "it's better to keep your mouth shut and be thought an idiot than to open it and remove all doubt. "

--- 帖子 #1002 ---
Thanks for the post. I am sorry I had put another post and then saw your latest reply.
Please forgive me I am not trying to pester you and we will respect your wishes. In my limited experience all EAs are not profitable in the long run due to the fundamentals and all EAs need the human touch and corrections from time to time. So many people have asked for the “imperfect EA” to be posted so we can demo test it and maybe with feedback things could be improved.
As I mentioned before we will respect your wishes and I will not ask you to reconsider anymore. I thank you for your hard work and wish you all the success.
Kind Regards

if you are going to keep this thread going please ban this master of forex. One wonders what he is doing in the FF. He is full of BS. If you go and see his posting he is the smart chap who on the 18th of DECEMBER said

"...Because as soon as a thousand or so people start taking the same identical trades and consistently making money, their combined presence in the market will start to weight it and the market will start to stall at Carmen levels and behave differently suddenly, and ultimately then start to go against Carmen trades. I've noticed it time and time again with other good systems over the last 8 years. Just watch and see."

He is just bitter because everyone laughed at his idiotic comments.

--- 帖子 #1004 ---
Yes, trend lines are invalid in the short term (otherwise your EA would work), and this thread is all about "HOPE'ing" to make money from forex in the short term.

I don't consider weekly etc. timeframes that you quoted in your recent post to be short term. Since you didn't quote a timeframe in your earlier post in which you referred to trend lines, and you based this thread on the premise of short term time-frame profit, I could only assume you were relating trend lines with short term tiem frames- 1m 5m 15m etc..

So not so "wow", as I never said trend lines have no relevance over longer time frames.

You quote Goldman Sachs et al who make money from forex. Didn't I say forex was typically out of reach of the small guy? Quoting G/S et al just supports my opinion.

As for the individuals you quoted, perhaps they don't post anymore becuase they've realised..

How do you know they made real money? Did you ever see their live statements? There are so many wannabee bullshi_ con artists in forex, you can't take anyones word for it in forex.

The only way to prove me an idiot for standing by my opinion is to present evidence of a "system" that does make money on short time frames in the long term, not just for a week or month or so.

Until that time each of our opinions is equally valid, though with the weight of evidence, teack record and history firmly supporting my opinion at present.

I could equally say to you that it is idiotic (to use your term) to have spent 4 years and thousands of hours messing around with indicators and EA's on a pie-in-the-sky wild goose chase? Wasn't 1 year enough?

--- 帖子 #1005 ---
Tahiti,

By the way Carmen got me 50 pips today and done for the day.  What have you done today? Can you kindly share it with FF so we can learn from your from you.  All you have been doing is bashing and not made any contribution with FF.  If you are frustrated in trading forex, please take your frustration somewhere else.

--- 帖子 #1006 ---
How do you know I am full of BS in stating the below?

Do you know how many active forex market participants there are at any one time so as to be able to establish that what I stated below cannot be possible?

Have you ever actually given thought to this very important aspect?

Consider it now: Just how many active forex market participants can there really be at anyone time, considering:

1. At any one time 2/3 of the world is asleep

2. Of the remaining population, what percentage of them are likely to be active participating investors?

3. Of this minute percentage, what percentage would trade "conventional" or mainstream markets like stocks, options, CFD's etc? Answer: The majority

4. Of the remaining minute percentage of the minute percentage who trade unconventional/non mainstream markets, what percentage would trade non mainstream markets such as indexes, futures, oil, gold etc. Answer: The majority

5. Of the remaining minute percentage of the minute percentage of the minute percentage, what percentage would trade binarys and other niche markets? Answer: A fair proportion.

6. So that leaves a very very small number of active forex market participants. Don't forget that 2/3 oif the world is asleep at any one time.

7. Of those would-be forex market participants who are awake and active, 95% or more of them lose.

8. The 95%+ who lose are not going to continue trading and losing and so will stop.

9. Which means that the total number of active forex market participants depends on a constant influx of new lambs to the slaughter, which just can't happen.

Just because figures of $3 trillion per day turnover are brandished over the internet doesn't mean there are lots of active participants.

Take out international trade related transactions and the "speculative" forex market turnover remaining would be a small percentage of this number.

Do you really think there can be more than 20,000 or 50,000 people at any given time actively trading forex?

I would be grateful if you could either start your own thread or if Aicccia is not going to carry on with this one share your use of CARMEN here.

Please ignore fools such as "tahiti", reading his past comments shows his wisdom. People like him are sad and they get into threads so people take notice of them. I am ignoring him (the thread master can ban him).

Regards

--- 帖子 #1008 ---
All,

I'm making no promises, especially on time, but I'll create an EA based on Carmen. I MAY have something by the weekend but it depends on my work situation (I may have to go away tomorrow).

I've just finished work on an EA that is now being sold commercially (its not one of the mainstream $97.00 EA's and I'm not the system creator, only the programmer).

Cheers,

swnke2.

--- 帖子 #1009 ---
Thanks man, will you posting for free or selling?

It'll be much better if Aicccia could just kindly post his. But he's done more than enough by giving us the indicator in the first place.

--- 帖子 #1010 ---
Wow Tahiti you really underestimate the retail forex market.

Retail fx traders (that's you and me) account for about 5% of the total Forex market, about 50 - 100 $billion.

I really don't think 50 000 individuals are trading a million - 2 million a day each.

Tahiti you should really learn a little more about the forex market before you decide to take such a critical approach.

Wes

P.S

I made 170 pips today. Not bad for 5 min TF hey.

Open your mind Tahiti, you'll probably make alot more money.

--- 帖子 #1011 ---
It will be posted on this forum free-of-charge,

Look..its a trigger not a trading method

It get you in on an edge .. your money management exploits that edge..

On the 4 I follow around 9 ,10 sigs today so far 7 good 3 bad cant ask for more

P

--- 帖子 #1013 ---
Exactly and the 3 bad are at what 8pip loss each? And the winners...as much as you let them

--- 帖子 #1014 ---
hmm yes 10 -12 pips a piece..you looking over my shoulder

--- 帖子 #1015 ---
Paulus,

Nice to see you at this thread.

What is 4 I (4 hrs)? Could you provide an example trade with you settings?

Thanks,

Kostas.

--- 帖子 #1016 ---
I think Paulus means on the 4 pairs he follows he got 9 or 10 signals today.

Good to see you here Paulus.

--- 帖子 #1017 ---
Wow!,eight years huh..you have been trading for 8 years without any profit....don't you think it's time to give up and try something else ? Yet everytime i log on i see you here..i know you are angry for losing,not our fault.. i just hate to hear a sucker like you talk about forex like this because this is how i feed my family..i am a fulltime trader and i will always be so take your negativity and go somewhere else.

--- 帖子 #1018 ---
who said without any profit.

Yes, I would have given up, if after 1 full year I could not turn a profit.

Negativity.. or reality?

--- 帖子 #1019 ---
I note TudorGirl is on your buddy list.

If you check her thread, the general consensus is she turned out to be a complete scam.

which.. doesn't exactly speak volumes for your credibility.

--- 帖子 #1020 ---
Oh goodie. another day of testosterone flexing

--- 帖子 #1021 ---
Tahiti is not allowed to post here anymore, so hopefully there will be no more negativity. If anyone can make a succesful EA of this system then that's awesome.

--- 帖子 #1022 ---
The problem was though it may seem that CARMEN was trading off trendlines, it wasn't and the lines were completely arbitrary. I'm sorry. Like I said before, the real problem is the core strategy.

--- 帖子 #1023 ---
Thanks for banning TAHITI, he was full of it. It was obvious from his earlier posts (17th,18 Dec) that he was new to forex and suddenly got very upset and when there was no EA.

When you sa the lines were completely arbitrary surely you do not mean there was some sort of indications were used! Otherwise are you saying Tahiti was right?

regards

--- 帖子 #1024 ---
They were just visual trailing stops. But this indicator was a great learning expierience, so I don't have any regrets. I know this may damage my credibility some, but at least I had the integrity to let everyone know that I think it's a dead end. And for anyone looking for a great trading methodology that requires very little screen time, check out Jacko's thread in the commercial section.

--- 帖子 #1025 ---
Thanks very much for enlighting us. As they say "Price is the ultimate indicator" so trailing stops is another way of utilizing the Price. Moreover, any system which makes the most of the trends and small to zero loss in a ranging market should be pursued with vigour.

Thanks

p.s. I can see our friend Tahiti here, he loves this thread and can not keep away, but got very upset and emotional when there was no magic EA. I think he should start a thread at the commercial section and offer some mentoring servcies so we can benefit from his wisedom and 8 years of profitable trading.

Aiccia

If you do a search on my name you will see the fact that I have put forward several ways of making money from Forex.Some last some die some crash and burn..

the important thing here is an advancemnt and  move forward..I have many ideas in my head for trading systems and often put un finished projects on the table here to be looked at ridiculed torn apart or improved.

If we dont throw the seeds onto the path how can we hope for a  few to germinate,

Im currently looking and working on an inside bar system on a 5 min chart with no other indicator .. its going well if fact today so far 12 signals with 9 winners..I dont get excited any more because tomorrow it may be the reverse..the important thing is to gain an edge ..another system I use goes long on a down candle and short on an up candle..it gives me an edge because Im getting a better fill.

A casino makes only 3% but on the money invested every day on all the tables it makes a huge amount of money with very little down side risk.

Personaly I think end of day systems using daily bars gives you the edge over day trading .. less time in front of PC less noise on the chart..

As we speak I have just had an inside bar signals on £$ I will go long at  1.6008 or short at 1.5993 my stop being 15 pips my TP is therefore 45 pips 3 x my risk,I dont take levels or pivots into account in my trading only news that way if I have an EA made its simpler to code and already takes into account the swings and round abouts of trading round different price levels.

Il let you know how this trade goes and will post the system if Im happy with the results..but hey its all been done before perhaps just used a different way.

Paulus

--- 帖子 #1027 ---
Sounds promising Paulus, where abouts in UK you from mate?

I agree totally with the edge thing, consistency is the only thing we need to become successful in this game. Also gonna take a look at the IB thing you mentioned, I guess on cable only?

thanks again

--- 帖子 #1028 ---
You are quite right. In any field advancement is made by people who dared think outside the norm and experiment. I think people who ridicule failures of likes of you and aiccia are fools who can not come up with anything constructive themselves. Best of luck and keep us posted.

regards

--- 帖子 #1029 ---
I got very nice and simple idea using your indicator just draw a bunch of parallel lines at your chart and use each line as buy/sell point, i don't know what is the optional size of channels whould be but from visual checking it for las month it seems VERY profitable may be i am mistaking and lying to my self but i would really apriciate some feedback.

--- 帖子 #1030 ---
I find that trading the carmen setup is a valuable addition to my trading toolbox. It helps to have several approaches to the market

cheers

--- 帖子 #1031 ---
Thank you very much for aicccia and your great job.

BTW, could you post your 4.01 source mq4 file?

I want to modify that i can find from signal message what is currency pair.

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #1032 ---
can someone post v4 ?  On page one of this thread its not working.

thx

--- 帖子 #1033 ---
Hi

just loaded and it works fine. Have you intslled fully ?

--- 帖子 #1034 ---
Its not saving with the correct file ext.  When I renamed it, it still does not work. I tried to open it in the editor and it just had one line of gibberish.

Not sure what I'm doing wrong.  I've done uploaded ea's indicators and scripts before.

--- 帖子 #1035 ---
Try right-clicking on the file on post #1 and selecting SAVE AS, or use a browser other than Internet Explorer.

Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #1036 ---
Are you using internet explorer? sometimes that is a problem. I down load then drag and drop to Experts/indicators

--- 帖子 #1037 ---
Try downloading from the "paper clip", upper right-hand corner of thread page...see if that helps...

--- 帖子 #1038 ---
Yes the paper clip worked perfect.

So i put this carmen 4.1 on M1 USD/JPY and she worked awesome.

Is the m1 the recommend TF still?

--- 帖子 #1039 ---
I hope you are getting on well with the EA. I just want to clarify if it will able to do the following.

- Buy when 3EMA crosses above the channel, close 50% of the position when the 3EMA turns yellow. And close the buy (by selling) when the 3EMA crosses below the channel and open a new short order.

-The opposite for selling

-When both the 3EMA and the channels are red, close existing positions and not entering new positions whilst red

The above are the basic functions of the system.  Will the EA have other options e.g. set custom stop losses etc

P.S

I will be more than happy with the EA if it can perform the basic functions of the system only, but robustly.

--- 帖子 #1040 ---
I think I must be going mad....Ive looked back and cannot find the EA lols..

Can someone poke me with a big stick in the right direction please ,,,

Im still finding the stoch pull back entry is getting me in nicely but would like to run the EA on another platform if possible..

My entry points for £$ for yest below..

For a long my end TP is measured from the last swing low to my entry I then project that forward to give me my target..

ie if swing low to entry is 50 pips then I want a move up from my entry the same size as the last swing low in this case 50 the last chart gives the example using fib tool with 0..1..2  if you put %$ after the number in the description box you get the price

Hi Paulus

No EA has been released. Some people are trying to create one. watch this space

Hi paulus,

Do you mind posting your stoich pls.

Thanks

Thanks for info GN...

here is the stoch..

--- 帖子 #1044 ---
Im going to post an indicator here I hope the main guys here dont mind and if you want me to pull it I will but it works on the same principle and you guys may of used it ..its called a stepMA 3D..the nice thing about this ind I have found esp if you want to trade an 'all day ' system.....ie you are always in a position.

The difference with this step ma is that it moves behind price alot quicker and so protects your pips gain..

Friday £$ would of made you around 130 pips

here is the screen shot and ind

paulus

--- 帖子 #1045 ---
Thanks Paulus, will have a look at it

--- 帖子 #1046 ---
All,

I've had my version of the Carmen EA on test now for a few days and in short, the results aren't good. The reason however is not what you might expect. During initial backtests, I couldn't work out why the EA was opening trades on the incorrect side of the two lines (I used Carmen 3.1 as the indicator). After a certain amount of time, I discovered that the information I was getting from the Carmen indicator was not the same as was displayed on the screen. I think AICCCIA may have experienced something similar - see this thread - http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=207639.

The attached images may help to explain what was witnessed.

Carmen1.png (the lower image): This image is of AUDUSD on a 1MIN chart that had been running untouched for some time. You can see the upper (blue) and lower (yellow) Carmen channels. In the top-right, you can see the values of these channels that the EA is obtaining in real time. The upper (blue) channel line is just under 0.91500 and the lower channel line at around 0.91440. However, the value for the upper channel from the EA is 0.91598 (in aqua) and the value for the lower channel is 0.91538 (in yellow). These values that the EA is reading from the indicator do NOT match the values of the on-screen blue & yellow lines that Carmen is displaying.

So, I then switched to a 5MIN timeframe and then switched back to the 1MIN and saw.....

Carmen2.png (the upper image): If you look at this image, you see that the 2 lines displayed by Carmen are now displayed correctly as per the values (i.e. both lines have moved 'up' to the values that were being read by the EA). All I did was to switch timeframes and allow the indicator to redraw the lines.

NOTE: I know that a few minutes had passed on the 1M chart, hence more bars, but this wasn't enough to change the Carmen lines under their normal operational mode. This is confirmed by the values in the upper-right that were being obtained from the EA are displayed the same as before.

So where does that leave us?

I'm not sure if the 'repaint' is caused by the indicator or MT4. Either way, this doesn't give us a solid foundation on which to build the EA. I'm therefore reluctant to spend any further time on it (such as working on improved exit strategies) if we can't get the correct entries.

I also won't post the EA because this will generate many questions and quite frankly I'm not going to spend my time supporting this. I hope you understand my situation.

In the meantime, I'll have a look at the indicator that Paulus has recently posted (good to have you back Paulus) to see if that provides a better platform on which to build an EA.

If anyone can demonstate the indicator (or a different version of it) not repainting that I'll be glad to re-engage with this EA.

Cheers,

swnke2.

--- 帖子 #1047 ---
Thanks for trying swnke2. Is there anyone that you can find that can do it, if so we can pay for it to be completed. Everyone that wants it can pay small amount like $50 etc towards the full amount. But we won't post on here for free, whoever pays, gets it.

Who's up for this.

I've posted a request to methodtraders.com

Here's what I said:

How the system works

When the 3EMA crosses above the channel, you buy

When the 3EMA the crosses below the channel, you close you buy order (by selling) and open a new short order

When the 3EMA crosses below the channel, you sell

When the 3EMA then crosses above the channel, you close your sell order(by buying) and open a new long order

You can set your own customized settings to the indicator, to manipulate the channel.

The EA should be able to perform these functions automatically, allow you to choose your time frame, lot size (make it suited to 5 digit brokers). It will also allow you to place a stop loss and trailing stop loss if you want that option instead of relying on the crossings of the channels for entry and exits.

I've told them where they could find the system and the thread that Aicccia posted and the post that swnke2  with the  problems they've encountered

They will get back to me with a quote

--- 帖子 #1048 ---
I assume that you are talking about getting the indicator fixed? Once the indy is working OK, I'm happy to proceed with the EA.

Cheers,

swnke2.

--- 帖子 #1049 ---
Hi Paulus

Interesting looking indicator there. Would you mind explaining it in a little more detail.

Many Thanks

Adam

--- 帖子 #1050 ---
No, I'm talking about the actual EA.

Does the indicator (v3.1) have to be working fully for us to make the EA? If so, the coders i posted to will have to fix it first before making the EA.

--- 帖子 #1051 ---
There's no problem writing a fully working EA providing that the indicator is working fine, which it isn't.  If someone is able to get the indicator working properly, then I'll be able to complete the EA.

Cheers,

swnke2.

--- 帖子 #1052 ---
What if Aicccia posts v4.01 with the source code. Can you produce an EA for this?

--- 帖子 #1053 ---
Hey Jaula, it is carmen v4 the indicator on your chart which is the problem...aicccia knows about it too and so there is a problem which no one can solve

--- 帖子 #1054 ---
If he provides us with the source code, a coder can then hopefully fix it and make an EA.

--- 帖子 #1055 ---
But check the link provided, aicccia had a thread with the question for other coders but no one could fix it!

--- 帖子 #1056 ---
Yeah thanks I know about the problem, it's on this thread

http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=207639

The coders will have to fully fix the indicator before creating the EA. I prefer it be v4.01, but that's only if I can get the source code. If not it'll have to v3 which is very good as well.

--- 帖子 #1057 ---
Paulus thanks for posting the step ma 3d indy .

Have been looking at it on the 15 min time frame which looks promising

Just looked at 1min and 5 min and they look good as well

--- 帖子 #1058 ---
Thats a good indicator stepMA 3D  thank you Paulus for posting this, is this indicator available with alerts

--- 帖子 #1059 ---
Been looking all over the net for one with alerts founds loads of history on it..but no alert here is the code and the link is to the guy who wrote it

Nikolay Kositsin

hello paulus,

you did ask one time how carmen work? Have you found out? Is carmen consider fibonacci in changing its position?

i have found that trend magic work well on 30m and 1H time frame to be considered as step ma and its move with the price.

--- 帖子 #1062 ---
Hi Jaula

First of all I do like to work on carmen V3.1 and use it with cross of ema 5 with the blue line only cause with this version I open less trades and its seem easier in rules than V4.1.

If carmen v3.1 become EA will be good for taking entries but to be with manual TP or for TP limits, if you leave it to close with next cross with the carmen line again may not show that much profits in long term of EA back-test

(see picture C1)

in ranging market carmen lines not moving up and down with the price that make the EA not profitable with back test!

in (Picture C2) if carmen lines move with the price will show more profits.

--- 帖子 #1063 ---
so it sounds like carmen 4.0 does not work. Too bad because I like the alert/text feacher.

So why don't we drop it and go with a different stepMA and add alerts.

If it test out good on 1 min an EA can come later.

--- 帖子 #1064 ---
The trend magic looks like nothing but 50 period CCI which moves above and below the zero line. So the colour changes on move above and below on the trend magic indicator. The stepma 3D which paulus had posted before looks so good with less wipsaws, alert may be added on the green line moving out of the bands.

--- 帖子 #1065 ---
Thank you paulus for posting the code and indicators.You have been a big contributer in FF with great ideas. Would like to bring to attention of everyone on mainly 2 indicators MT4-LevelStop-Reverse and Stepma D3. The first indicator is having alerts and does work well in any time frame. The second indicator does so good with the trend and removes most of the wipsaws, only there has to be an alert on the green line close above and below the bands.

--- 帖子 #1066 ---
I have had some requests for the source codes. Good luck guys but I am moving on to bigger and better things.

--- 帖子 #1067 ---
Hello Aicccia,

will you share with us your updates?

--- 帖子 #1068 ---
Paulus, what settings are you using on this stepMA

--- 帖子 #1069 ---
I have written and EA for this indicator. So far the results are interesting. $$

Ive noticed repaint after several days - blue and yellow line. Also repaint on red line. (3.1). Anyone having this issue?

--- 帖子 #1070 ---
Which pairs and what time frame did you use to get those results?

--- 帖子 #1071 ---
using 15min on all

Hi Crusty,

You and me too - see my post on #1047.

Cheers,

Nick.

--- 帖子 #1073 ---
Hi,

I dont think it does repaint on 5m and bigger time frames, i been watching for 2 days entry on GU  and its still at same place.

--- 帖子 #1074 ---
I'm now trading using price action and trendlines on 4H and Daily timeframe. So far I'm doing 100x better than I ever did with indicators. I'm really kicking myself for not dropping anything related to mlq sooner.

Hi aiccia

Thank you for an interesting diversion. I agree with your current strategy  However some people will flog a holy grail concept unitl they lose their account. You have been very honest to those who will listen. Perhaps you would be prepared to point some of the hopefulls here To ways of learning what you are currently doing , profitably

--- 帖子 #1076 ---
Hello aicccia,

Good to hear you are doing well  and still thank you very much for carmen indys you did.

have a great day

--- 帖子 #1077 ---
Sadly it does - I've tried it on several timeframes and the values coming back form the indy are different from those displayed via the lines on the screen.  Try selecting different timeframes on the same chart and going back to your original timeframe - not the lines on before/after.

If I could get this working, believe me, I would.

Cheers,

Nick.

--- 帖子 #1078 ---
Hi Nick,

do you mean v3.1 or the new version? cause i look back at posted pictures attached in this thread and found no repaint on carmen v3.1

--- 帖子 #1079 ---
Please help,

after download and install of carmen v.4.01 I just see red.

Who can help ???

Many Thanks in advance !!!!

--- 帖子 #1080 ---
Plz read the first post - you can find in post #1 the explanation for this "red" !

--- 帖子 #1081 ---
camen 401 show red in your M30 chart it's strange.

please try to reduce Xindi_period, may be reduce 10 times

--- 帖子 #1082 ---
Yes, I was using version 3.1.

I'll repeat the exercise on a larger timeframe next week and hopefully I can show you the problem in a smilar way to that on post 1047.

Cheers,

Nick.

--- 帖子 #1083 ---
Thanks for your help.

The problem was, the version 4.01 I´v downloaded from paperclip but this was the wrong one. The right version is from page 1 of this thread.

Thanks again !!!

--- 帖子 #1084 ---
Thanks for your help.

The problem wasn´t the time, I´ve downloaded a wrong version of 4.01. (from paperclip) The right one is on first 1 of this thread.

Tanks again!!

--- 帖子 #1085 ---
How Are You aicccia

I am with you with this strategy , like Jacko's thread and some other guys do...then we can take every single price correction on the smallest TF by following the highest TF (H4 and Daily) as the main trend Good Luck Aiccia and success all

--- 帖子 #1086 ---
attached indicators?

--- 帖子 #1087 ---
so wait after all these posts and discussion, was this system any good?

--- 帖子 #1088 ---
Hi

unfortunatley the creator has decided to trade in a different way, take the hint. some people still think that there is merit in carmen

--- 帖子 #1089 ---
Well, tahiti did warn us. and having re-read his/her posts, i see the point.

the creator did admit the lines were just arbitrary (random).

As stated below.. take the hint.

--- 帖子 #1090 ---
I've found 3.1 to be one of my leading indicators. Very helpful for me.

Wondering if anyone has published any settings for other pairs?

I feel like im missing out - GU is the only pair ive noticed ... thx

One issue I do not like - is the red line repaint in 3.1. However, it has not been a real problem other than waiting for price action to return in that direction eventually. I use the red line for entry - not the white cross - because price action seems "strongest" as it moves that direction.

Another habit ive come to realize - is to "reset" the indicator when i arrive in the morning. I notice the repaint and find more accuracy/confidence with signal.

--- 帖子 #1091 ---
my opinion: its better to trade the blue line only with 5ema cross

--- 帖子 #1092 ---
Hi maanawi

How successful have  you been using your variation, how many pips a week?

How long have you been trading like that for?

Give me all your results since you started trading this variation

--- 帖子 #1093 ---
Here is the template and you can calculate by your self

--- 帖子 #1094 ---
looks good on various time frames

--- 帖子 #1095 ---
Hi all,

Its just a pity that the creator of carmen decided to abandon it and hence the thread is not so active again.

With all the flaws discovered by the creator, carmen is still an amazing tool for me especially carmen 3.1.

The important thing is to know yourself, are u a scalper or a swing trader. Painting or repainting is only an issue for an EA to be created. With the introduction of maanawi's idea of one carmen line, that even makes it easier. I use it to scalp as well as swing. With the wild moves recently being experienced, carmen have been giving a ride to many who know how to drive it.

Thanks again aicca for your work on carmen...... I will suggest that maanawi and all the good contributors to this thread continue to post charts and ideas. If you are looking for the holy grail, I guess this is not the thread...but if you are looking for pips....then welcome on board.

--- 帖子 #1096 ---
Sharing my EA - it looks for a simple 15pip tp. RED LINE CROSS - only indicator used here is Carmen - ohh Carmen - I miss you - please come back.

Other price action rules look to protect original order. remaining orders do nothing but look - get out - if original order does not tp.

no stop loss.

may include an equity SL later - but letting the EA run for now.

Well there idea i do with trading carmen : if my trade size today is 10k i dont put them all on one per i divide my trades on two or three carmen chances for example :

3k on GU, 3K on EU, and 4k on EJ

--- 帖子 #1099 ---
Hi Crusty

Are you going to post your EA? Your chart look much different then mine is that a different template too? Since we don't have the author to get answers from we need to help each other.

Thanks in advance for any help or advice.

I just catch this repaint on my chart do any one else have this repaint?

--- 帖子 #1101 ---
Hi,

I have a idea how to get better resoluts with carmen, but I am sure, if I am right. I used carmen indicator together with indicator called nonlagdot(i found it in other thread on this forum). You can trade on H4, D1 and W1 charts. As I say - now it is only a idea, but I cant work with MetaQuotes language. Is here is samebody, who should help me and test this idea? I will answer all of your questions. The system is explained on the image bellow and indicators you can find in this post.

P.S. My English is not so good, so sorry for that

yep! I have been using the indicator for over a couple months and noticed it does repaint. I still get really great results though. If you are going to still use the indicator you need to restart it after ever major move and at least before each trading session. Once you do that you should get really great trading signals.http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/dollar.gif

اhi mate,

I will give it a look tomorrow,

your English sound from russia

I also plan to trade carmen on 1 hour tf, i'm about good idea that may help.

--- 帖子 #1104 ---
yea but the strange thing it show repaint on MT4 1 and on the other MT$ show the same place of yesterday this confusing

I take the two pictures at same time.. different broker MT4

drawdown is a result of break even orders hedging original position.

39 total trade at 1 full lot. 15 pip tp with no stop loss on 6 pairs.

started ea on sunday. seemed to weather the news data and obama speech rather well.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1106 ---
what time frames and pairs did you leave the EA running on?

--- 帖子 #1107 ---
In my observation any strategy with no stop loss is doomed to fail, hence I think you are wasting your time.

If the lines are arbitrary (the developers own words), how can you expect this to work.

You may as well draw lines or a line anywhere on the chart.

Why don't you change the EA to do this and run it separately and I bet it will be the same as using carmen's lines?

--- 帖子 #1108 ---
i agree - also a "static" stop loss method is useless.

hedging rules are in place to protect original position - which is a sl method. this is reflected in the drawdown. a "static" SL - is a waist of time.

this ea is not FIFO compliant - do you understand hedging?

--- 帖子 #1109 ---
yes Crusty I know what is hedging, so I am looking forword to see your EA.

Thank you

--- 帖子 #1110 ---
Yes, that is true - without stop-loss no trading can be successful. I tested my idea witch a maximum stop-loss: TS was 100 and TP was 250(I cannot test other options). The results was similar to a test, which Crusty posted to this thread. But as you can see there, there are a "times", where I lost a lot of my money. So I want to ask you, if someone can help me find optimal filter to eliminate this "falls".

yo mort1r -

upper time frames are best used on lower time frames - from my observation.

so you may look for entry on lower and confirmation on upper. have you attempted this?

- have to run now - brb

--- 帖子 #1112 ---
Hi All,

Just letting you know that Carmen is still alive.  I have been using it still.  I have much success in 15min chart.  This indicator still works like  charm.  PLease let me know if anyone here is still using it.

forexforex

--- 帖子 #1113 ---
Why don't you post a statement showing trade history so we can all be convinced this indicator is worth the time of day?

Since the creator admitted the lines were arbitrary, I think everyone concluded you may as well just draw a horizontal line across the page and it was all a farce.

You can change the trade results to display in pips instead of $ if you're worried about confidentiality.

Go on, I dare you to remove the ambiguity that others rely on.. to hide the truth.. that they're full of BS.

Dare to be different.

--- 帖子 #1114 ---
well if metatrader didn't encounter bugs when you try to make EAs recognise long MAs I think aicccia would still be involved in this project

--- 帖子 #1115 ---
anyone still using this system? what results are you getting?

--- 帖子 #1116 ---
forexforex:

I have also found that I like Carmen best on M15....once a trend has developed...i like her boundaries to keep me in as it's trending but, more importantly, i like how it keeps me on the right side usually (more times than not) when there's a consolidation...if you notice on the charts...there's usually one more spurt in the correct direction before reversal.  By putting the 00's and 50's on the chart, a lot of times you can pinpoint exactly how far it will go b4 reversing.

--- 帖子 #1117 ---
Hello...

Regarding the "carmens_eyes_v4.01" indicator, what are the settings I must use for M15 EUR/USD?

--- 帖子 #1118 ---
You must read post #1 ! Game over here !!!

--- 帖子 #1119 ---
@ Mandl2007

Reading the last few posts occured to me that still some people is reading the thread so my question was addressing that people in general. As per your instruction to read post #1 there is not any reference for "M15 EUR/USD", there is  for "GBP/USD" and that is quite different (I think).

--- 帖子 #1120 ---
I have carmen 4, can anyone tell me how to interperate the red and yellow lines that show on occassions on the indicator?

--- 帖子 #1121 ---
What if Aicccia posts v4.01 with the source code. Can you produce an EA for this?

--- 帖子 #1122 ---
Dear oftenhungry, i would like to contact u. please send me PM. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1123 ---
I unable to understand how your indicator works as when i downloaded it and fixed in experts indicator it showed colours olive,red and yellow.whereas you are mentioning colours as white yellow and blue.please help

--- 帖子 #1124 ---
Read post 1

There is a problem with this indy.  The idea was abandoned

thread should be in trash

--- 帖子 #1125 ---
