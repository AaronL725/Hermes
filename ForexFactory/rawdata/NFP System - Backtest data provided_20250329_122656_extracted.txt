Whats up fellas? I have something that I would like to share with you all. Rob Booker www.robbooker.com recently held a contest to see who could come up with the best system to trade the NFP report. Here is the system (backtest data in Excel format), as I've agreed to make it freely available shortly after I won the contest. A couple of notes about it: This system relies heavily on an indicator called the Sentinal Index. Origionally created by Joe Knight, I adopted the concept and gave it a use in my system. What it is is a "dollar index" created by taking the movement of the 7 major USD based pairs (GBP/USD, EUR/USD, AUD/USD, NZD/USD, USD/JPY, USD/CAD, USD/CHF) and averaging their daily moves together to come up with a meld of them all, and an overall direction of the dollar. I plot this in Excel, and lay my 7 day SMA indicator overtop, which I use for entry into the system. I don't have an automated means of charting and distributing the Sentinal Index yet (which I intend to distribute freely), but I do still update it by hand, and do offer services such as custom system development based on the index, my signals based on the Sentinal Index and a short description of each trade daily, and so forth. If you are interested in any of these, PM or email me, and we can make a system like this one together Success rate: aprox. 80% over 4 years Equity: $5,000 to $460,526.50 USD in 4 years Pips: 10,467 in 4 years (or an average of 215 a month) Kev

This is really cool. Thanks for sharing the info. I'll try it in the near future and will get back to you ASAP. Thanks again. Al

seems neat .. waiting for the indicator dude

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Hi, This looks great, I know rob well and I can see he has showed you how to backtest... I will backtest this myself tonight Thanks for sharing -S-

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Well, the Sentinal index isn't widely distributed as of yet. Joe Knight is the origional creator, and he let me borrow his idea, computerize and backtest it according to my NFP system. I am in the process of making a webpage that has real time java based charts that will provide the indicator (free of charge). I am on holiday in Canada, and will be returning this Wednesday, so expect something by this coming weekend. I don't have a completely automatic system for producing the indicator, though I am working on a program to do so, so I can't exactly re-do my work here It would take entirely too long. So I hope you can bare with me in the next few days. -Kev Edit: Below are the Sentinel MT4 files for IBFX Mini

take your time kevin

Thank you Kevin for bringing this to us. Definatly worth the test. Enjoy the holiday

Will the sentinal rules be published so we can incorporate them into our API? It sounds like it will end up being for sale. Freely available from the website, but how can we automate the trades our selves without the rules for the sentinal? We can't back-test your results...and we can't verify the signals. Are you planning on making the rules freely available? or will the indicator be for sale?

--- 帖子 #9 ---
mrmikal, I'm not withholding the Sentinal index from anybody. I'm going to make it freely available, but none of my work is here. If you want the rules to create the Sentinal index, something I worked hours a day for weeks to come up with in a useable format, then here you go Any time frame (30 minutes used in the system), take the close of the current candle and subtract the close from the previous candle from it. That gives you a number that shows which direction (up if the number is positive, down if the number is negative) the pair has moved in the last two 30 minute candles. Now, do that for all 7 USD based pairs for the same candle (if you subtract the close on candle 8:30 from the close on candle 8:00 for Jan 8th, 2006 GBP, then you must subtract the close on candle 8:30 from the close on candle 8:00 for Jan 8th, 2006 for the other 6 pairs). Add all the numbers together, divide by 7 (to come up with an average USD move) and that gives you a number....logistically the total average amount all the USD based pairs have moved. Now chart it. Take a base number, doesn't matter what it is...I use 1000. For each 30 minute candle you do the above rules for (and come up with your sentinal number for every 30 minutes), add this to your base number. If your first calculation gives you +8.24 (the number you get after you add all the movements together and divide by 7), add it to your base number 1000 to get 1008.24. Plot that on your graph. The second calculation (next 30 minute candle) gives you a movement of -3.12...then add that to your previous sentinal number which becomes 1005.12. You see? Thats a sentinal number. If you'd like to wait a few days, I can definately get you my hand generated numbers. Until then, if somebody comes up with an automated way of producing this on a chart, then I'd love to see it. It would save me much work -Kev Savage Pip Fiend

Hi Kevin_E, Thanks for posting this intriguing idea... I have been playing with the math for this sentinal index... I have a few questions; 1. In your rules you say you overlay the sma on top of it... How are you normalizing the index to match the scale of the SMA? Or are you referring a 7day sma of the sentinal index and not a 7 day sma of the close? If that is the case, how are you determining a 7 day SMA of a 30min index? Are you using 336 periods of the 30 minute timeframe index? Or are you choosing some particular time of day for the index to denote a end of day.? 2. I see from your backtest, that you have performed the test on GBPUSD. Have you tried anyother pairs or is this strategy for GBPUSD? It is an interesting idea... I would like to look into it further... thanks in advance, Scott

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Kevin, Thanks for the info...question, though... The USD/JPY cross...obviously that number will be considerably higher than the others...won't that screw with your average? For example: The USD/JPY moves 7 pips but the the GBP moves 60 pips...if you don't normalize and just take the subtracted value, you will get (0.07 + 0.006) / 2 = 0.038, which obviously will be skewed...if you were to do the pip values, you would get (60 + 7) / 2 = 33.5 pips...so what is it? Do you have to normalize the pip value or something? Also, you say chart the 7 USD base pairs. What pairs are those? If you're charting the majors, that should be 4 pairs. After that, we have the NZD, AUD and CAD, I would guess...but what about the HKD, the SKK, the Rand, etc...I'm taking it as you're not including those...just the 7 crosses I mentioned. Right?

--- 帖子 #12 ---
I think he mentioned the 7 pairs in his first post This system relies heavily on an indicator called the Sentinal Index. Origionally created by Joe Knight, I adopted the concept and gave it a use in my system. What it is is a "dollar index" created by taking the movement of the 7 major USD based pairs (GBP/USD, EUR/USD, AUD/USD, NZD/USD, USD/JPY, USD/CAD, USD/CHF) I just ignore the decimal when I built my index. That way it normalizes itself... It would be good to here Kevin's take on this...

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Wow, I must have totally been blind...the details were in the first post...I just couldn't get the gist of what was going on. OK...Now I totally get it. I assume it wouldn't be too difficult to create an indicator on this for MT. I've been looking at doing something similar but for another purpose. On a side note, I would think a "real" dollar index would have to possibly weight each of these currencies based on average daily volume. Obviously trades in less liquid pairs (like the GBP/USD) can move the index disproportionately just because of the higher volatility (due to lack of liquidity). Again, I'm not saying that the Sentinal index should be modified, but I was thinking along the same lines. Anyways...interesting stuff.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
This is a good point.. I had not even thought of it... something else to play with... Thanks...

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Yeah usually I just ignore the decimal to normalize. My first attempts at a sentinal index were to create a base day (Jan 3rd of 2000) and take the first close of that day as a base number (insead of 1000). Then, for each day, subtract the sentinal numbers from the base day like normal, totally taking the decimal out of the equation, giving me a normalized rounded number of the total pips moved. The number doesn't really matter, just the movements. I have also taken into account the strength of each pair in relation to the USD, and its effect on the Sentinal index. Ideally, if you make the sentinal index without factoring this in, it would react differently to different pairs (seeing as how some pairs are more effected by the USD than others), instead of attempting to normalize to make it behave the same on each pair. I sort of counted on this, as I would test all the pairs versus the Sentinal index, and see which one it would work best on during different days and times (and months/years). I kind of stopped at GBP/USD because I entered into a contest, and the time constraints forced me to stick to one pair as opposed to manually backtesting on all the other ones. I'm working on putting this into an expert advisor in MQL4, which will let me backtest this against other pairs much more quickly, and let me share it more openly. A "corrected" index would be me creating proportions on how far a pair has gained or slid against the USD (its weight on the USD currently versus the other pairs) and factoring that into the Sentinal number, giving me a different indicator for each pair. I'll probably work on that later on, but I think theres alot more for me to milk out of this as of now, so I'll put that idea on the back burner Also, I've already thrown around a few ideas and charts about only charting the number in specific time frames. If you're only able to trade between the hours of 5pm and midnight, for example, make your number only deal with the times between 5pm and midnight. I've done one between 9am and midnight (completely ignoring the times of midnight to 9am), and the results are pretty nice, and still reflect a good indicator. When I get home in a couple of days, I'll definately share more on it. Until then. -Kev Savage Pip Fiend

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Kevin, when you get a minute, could you answer my first question about the 7 days sma in this post ? http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...1&amp;postcount=10 thanks

--- 帖子 #17 ---
I simply factor. 30 minutes = 336 SMA You could use one time of day, but you would only come up with one point per day, and a straight line between them...also meaning you could only take a trade at that one point during the day, because only then would you know if your sentinal number is above or below the SMA. sorry about missing the question. -Kev Savage Pip Fiend

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Thanks, the 336 is what I figured it would be.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Another question. Where and how are you placing stops, so you can determine your risk % I see you haveused 5%, but what is that 5% based on? thanks

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Well, I leverage 5% of my account. Meaning if I have an account worth 50,000, I'll be leveraging 2,500 per position (or 2.5 lots for both positions that I have open, 5 lots total..which is 10% total leverage). Then I just put the stops 100 pips in the opposite direction, which mean a drawdown of aprox. 10% of my account if I lose, but has in the past gained back decently -Kev Savage Pip Fiend

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Hi Kevin, thanks for sharing. Have you seen this Metatrader indicator which compares moving averages. Perhaps it would be possible to set the moving average to 2? Its not my indicator, I believe the credits are still at the top of the code.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Hi, i have another indicator, that calculates the value of a currency against a weighted average of several other currencies. It could easily be modified for the Sentinal index, but maybe it's already good enough as it is. A currency basket is what central banks use to monitor an exchange rate, with weights based on trade volume. The indicator can also be used to calculate exotic crosses, or simple inverses of standard pairs. From a mathematical point of view it's impossible to calculate the "absolute strength" of a commodity, from any number of prices. (I suppose that was the aim of the Sentinal index.) Practically one further condition can often be made, like assuming that one price or the value of some basket is fixed. One hint for the use: numerator, denominator and weights input is made by strings and the parsing is not very sophisticated: use three character symbols, four digit weights (percent) plus seperators.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
I'm very impressed with people's ideas and strategies based on the indicator! I didn't know discussion would be this high in the Sentinal's reguard, but I'm really glad it is. I'm headed home today (very sad about that), and I'll be home later on tonight. Depending on how I feel after the flight, I may post all of my data when I get home on the Sentinal index thus far, but if I'm too tired or jet lagged, then I'll post it tomorrow first thing. Thanks for keeping interest fellas. -Kev

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Here is the first version of a Sentinal index indicator. It should be a lot easier to read and modify (the code) than the currency basket indicator. I took the liberty to include the choice of measering moves in percent, pips or dollars. Percent is the easiest to calculate and the most meaningfull, imo - but the results are pretty similar (apart from scaling), since all three are almost independent of the second currency. If we want to come as close to a pure dollar index as possible, here is a suggestion: How about using the median of all relative moves of the last 30 minutes instead of an average. This would filter out currencies that moved a lot independently of the dollar, and I think you could actually get rid of all the weighting. http://img238.imageshack.us/img238/528/sentinaljz7.gif

--- 帖子 #25 ---
hello kevin, thank you for sharing your ideas. for programming the indicator, i still have a couple of questions for clarification: (1) when you average the currency pairs, i understand you did not weight them: (a) but did you take into account that USDJPY moves at a different decimal and if you directly compare with other currencies, each 'pip' will count as 10 pips in other currencies? or did you calculate in pips for each currency and they all are the same? (in that case USDJPY/10 should be used for calculations). (b) and did you take into account that some currency pairs move in different directions and the direction will have to be adjusted? (e.g. EURUSD and USDCHF are opposite). (2) SMA(336): this is the SMA on the sentinal indicator, correct? not on price. first we should do whatever you did, because your system made money in the backtest. have a safe trip home, and thank you for your answers

Thanks for writing this index for MT4.. It looks like it is just the ticket...

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Just FYI, You may have issues getting this to run IF your currency pairs aren't standard...for example...interbank FX names their MINI currency pairs EURUSDm (with the "m" at the end)...this causes a non-calculation of the index. BUT you can change it in the script...which is very very clean...LOVE IT!

--- 帖子 #29 ---
excellent work, iya !! this answered my questions, and i took the liberty to do 2 modifications: (1) SMA added (2) direction reversed, so it reflects the direction of GBPUSD on which Kevin worked

--- 帖子 #30 ---
need to know what time to use for this box on the 30min chart thanks for the good work

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Hi Kevin, Thanks for sharing this interesting trading system. Regarding to the rule, "Draw box (horizontal line on high and low) between 8:30 on NFP Friday and midnight the following Monday." Do you mean the box is drew from 08:30 Friday to 00:00 Monday? or 00:00 Tuesday? Is the time based on EST? Please kindly clarify. Once again, thanks for sharing! Best Regards, hksweeper

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hi all, Verry intresting System Just got one problem with the Sentinal Index_SMA indicator. It only draws till jan 25 ( see pic ) Anny sugestions ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Yes, i would say that its EST time (8:30 est, the time when NPF its released) Please Kevin correct me if i am wrong, and Thank u very much for your work Matty

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Me too... when i added it to the chart was looking good and then i tried to check the indicator properties and now it only draws to jan 25, and i cant fix it... maybe a bug?? Thanks fellas matty

--- 帖子 #35 ---
i don't have that problem with drawing only to jan 25. have you tried to scroll back? i don't know if all 7 currencies need to be opened at M30 or whatever you use and need to be scrolled back to ensure your computer has the actual data downloaded on your hard drive. also, it is possible that your memory is limited in MT4. go into 'Tools', then 'Options', then open 'Charts', and fill the 'Max bars in history' and 'Max bars in chart' with as many 9999999 as will fit in. the program will then reset to the max allowable number of data stored. climax - i also don't see your SMA line on the chart. no idea why not - it is showing on my computer without a problem.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Hi Matty, Thanks for clarifying. Do you know if we draw the box from 08:30 Friday to 00:00 Monday? or 00:00 Tuesday? Regards, hksweeper

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Actually im not sure, i guess its sunday nigth/monday 00.00Est and that would be like all friday and sunday data that in some plataforms its one day, but just guessing here mate... i would like Kevin to clarify that to be sure.. Bubo thanks for the suggestion.. will try and see Matty

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Hi: This is excellent! First, I missed the reverse part and got confused. Duh.. LOL Is it possible to add Boll Band, 5EMA and 13EMA to this? If you can't redo, could you post the code, so I can add it? I am just start to learn how to code, so it's not easy for me to modify the stuff yet. Thanks,

--- 帖子 #39 ---
fx4_ever: thank you, and yes - great idea and it is certainly possible to add other indicators on the Sentinal Index. i was thinking along the same lines, particularly for exit strategies. however, i would suggest that we consolidate our progress, or we will race into outer space and have a lot of ideas but nothing solid. Kevin's results are solid and he won a prize for them. i suggest that we (1) verify whether our Sentinal Index is correct and measures the same as Kevin's Sentinal Index; (2) backtest whether Kevin's positive results can be repeated with our Sentinal Index and an EA; (3) try to increase the efficiency of the system by whatever means we can think of. i suggest we follow some discipline in supporting Kevin and rely on his help to achieve these goals. i have seen many threads start with great ideas and then go into a thousand directions and all remain largely untested possibilities. p.s. you can see and modify the code anytime, right-click the name of the indicator on the left hand panel and choose 'Modify'.

Hello to everybody I just got back from vacation from Canada, my legs are killing me, long flights and all. I'm just touching base, I'll be back a little bit later on today to answer all of your questions, and start putting up Sentinal data for you to compare your own calculations with. Thank you all for your support -Kev Savage Pip Fiend

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Bubo, I think that is a great idea. 1. As to verifying weather or not the indicator is correct, I'll take a look at iya's code and determine how his is calculated, and let you know something definate on if the same calculations were used in mine (though I have a pretty good feeling it is). If it is any different, or some changes need to be made, I'll make the changes and post commented code that shows what I changed and why (if Iya doesn't mind me messing with his code a bit ). I'll also be posting data on my index, so we can all compare. 2. Backtesting is self explanitory...once you get the Sentinal indicator down solid (major props on getting it automated so fast by the way...I was having more than a hard time updating it by hand), then the backtesting should be easy to do, and the variables (such as the SMAs you are using, entry methods, etc) can be easily changed and tweaked until we come up with something better. ---snip-- As for my box drawing, I do it midnight the following Monday (not Tuesday). 8:30 am on Friday to 00:00 on Monday. -Kev Savage Pip Fiend

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Perfect! I suggest you use the modified 'Sentinal Index_SMA' - it is iya's code but has the same direction as GBPUSD and the SMA built in. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...0&amp;postcount=29

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Excellent job all! I did some eye tests with Sentinal Index_SMA, and everything seems to be perfect. I've attached some sentinal data done by hand, 30 minute chart with the NZD removed (because thats what I calculated it with this last time I re-made my sentinal index...the feed I was using didn't have the NZD. You'll see my sans-NZD results in the attached xml file). I removed the NZD on the Sentinal Index_SMA and charted it, pretty much a perfect match. This code is what you should use to do your backtesting. I'll put some stuff together today, and see what kind of backtesting data I can come up with. I'll post my results. If this works out right, I have a few other high success Sentinal systems I'd like to test out with this coded indicator. Then I'll run those by you guys too, see how it feels to you. -Kev Savage Pip Fiend

--- 帖子 #44 ---
hi, i added sentinel_SMA to cable 30m chart but it only plots the indicator when I change TF to daily, why doesn't it work with 30m TF?

--- 帖子 #45 ---
It seems to be working on my charts.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hi all, Thanks for sharing the system and the indicator. However, after I loaded the indicator, all I got is a blank indicator window, please see attached image. Is there anyone with the same problem? And anyone know the solution? Please kindly advise. Regards, hksweeper

--- 帖子 #47 ---
The reason is because you are using a mini account and the names do not match. I can change the indicator so it will work on ibfx mini... be right back Try this

--- 帖子 #48 ---
could you do the favor to adapt it to north finance as none of this works on me?

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Could you post a chart, so i can see thanks scott

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Thank you for the data, Kevin! Looks like we calculated the same way. There is a slight discrepancy, you divided by 7 but had only used 6 currencies. This should not affect the pattern much. I was actually surprised to see that leaving out of the NZD had still similar pattern but crossed the SMA at different points. So yes, we better leave NZD out for recreating your success story, at least for now. Easy to do, just set weight for NZD=0. Or has anyone else different results?

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Hi Kevin, I think I'm not clearly understanding some things. 1) Should the sentinal index always be above the SMA, regardless of which way you are trading? Or if going long it should be above and if going short it should be below? 2) Once the two horizontal lines are drawn, are those positions good until the next NFP or only for some other length of time? On the attached chart I believe I have everything plotted correctly. The up arrow would be 8:30 EST and the down arrow would be midnight EST (I think FXDD is 0GMT). My lines are drawn accordingly.. Does this look correct? Thanks, Jason

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Well, if one arrow is 8:30 and the other midnight on Monday, then your high line isn't in the right place. Draw with the absolute high and absolute low between those time frames. In reguards to the Sentinal question -- Long trades taken above, short taken below. And in reguards to how long the lines are good for, I've never had a problem with them running all until the next NFP, so I just take it as it comes If it ran into the next NFP date, I would just not have taken the trade that month. -Kev Savage Pip Fiend

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Kev, Ok, I see my mistake with the upper line (I was just looking at the specific bar). But based on your comments in your notes you mention taking several trades per month (4-5) which makes me believe this box scale is good until the next NFP date. So are you saying that if you could still see the lines when the next NFP came about, you wouldn't re-draw them? Lastly, the exit is only when the price crosses the sma, or also when the sentinal crosses back over it's sma? Thanks, Jason

--- 帖子 #54 ---
i think it worked in build 202 of MT4 for I upgraded to build 203 and now it doesn't work?

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Hi smjones, My problem is solved! Thank you very much! Best Regards, hksweeper

--- 帖子 #56 ---
hi all i seem to have a differnet problem with the indicator. i cant seem to get it to work with any time frame. i have increased the max number of bars already suggested, i am not on a mini account (have tryd the amended version anyway just in case), i am on a normal demo from IBFX. any advice, i so wanna be able to look at this as it looks pretty interesting

--- 帖子 #57 ---
I use North Financial which uses MT4, however, anytime I try to call the indicatior in my EA, the indicator only returns the number 2147483647. No matter what I change and do, the indicator only returns this number. This only occurs in the backtesting. It works just fine when you add the indicator to the chart. Can't figure this one out. Anyone have any clue? The EA right now only calls the indicator and then prints the result so I could see if it working. Argh!!! Any help is appreciated. Thanks,

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Please post a chart, so we can see what it looks like...

--- 帖子 #59 ---
It is a very small indicator with well designed logic. Why not just cut and paste the logic of the indicator directly into your EA?

--- 帖子 #60 ---
hi all i have a question: the Sentinal indicator is calculate the average of 7 currency (the most merchantable). i think the calculate should be with weight for each currancy. (for example the eur/usd have a bigger weight from the aus/usd) that will give more accurate result. what do you think fellow?

--- 帖子 #61 ---
It appears essential that you open windows for all of the 7 currency pairs that the indicator uses. If you don't do that, it may only draw part of the chart (where you have data) or none at all. MT4 uses currency data stored in *.st files in the /history subdirectory (e.g. AUDUSD30.hst). I am not sure if you simply need to have a file for each currency and MT4 will load the needed data when you are online, or if you need to scroll back and ensure that all data of your time period of interest on the chart is actually downloaded into these files on your computer. Does anyone know?

--- 帖子 #62 ---
dormdweller, i have exactly the same problem - indicator works fine on chart but gives me this number in EA. i tried to initialize the array but also did not help. have you found a solution? maybe 2147483647 is the universal answer to all of our problems on this planet...

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Hello. I've consolidated this thread into a single PDF file and posted it here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...5&amp;postcount=10 Cheers.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Can someone confirm this: Is the NFP release date is a Friday of the first week that is completely within that month? I checked a few releases, and that;s how I saw it.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
irusoh, It isn't always the first Friday in the month, though I think thats the norm they try and keep. If you want to find out the date and result of any news report (it seems since the beginning of time), then visit this link: http://biz.yahoo.com/c/e.html You can click "Previous week" at the top of the page as many times as you need to. To skip entire years, simply do this: http://biz.yahoo.com/c/ec/200712.html That is the 12th week in 2007 (the numbers before .html). So naturally: http://biz.yahoo.com/c/ec/200201.html would be the first week in 2002. You need that zero before the 1 in 200201.html, but as soon as you get up to week ten, you can strip the zero (200210.html). Keep in mind there are 52 weeks in a year and about 4 weeks in each month; you'll be able to guesstimate which week you'll need to look for in order to get to the place you want, if you're looking for the May release of the NFP in 2004 for example. But, if you miss your mark, you could always just scroll through them by using "Last week" and "Next week" at the top of the page -Kev Savage Pip Fiend

Do we have one NFP report this friday, good to test the system first hand

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Yea A peice of advice...demo my system if you're going to trade it, get a good feeling for it before you trade it live. I can provide you with all the backtest data in the world...but if you don't familiarize yourself with what you trade and get in a bigger comfort zone than you probably are in now, it could spell disaster. We'll talk it out after the report is over, and what happened. -Kev

Hello all. To get to some of your questions, first the one about taking the trade on a holiday. The reason I set up the rules the way I did was behind logic...to let the pair settle and decide on a more definate direction, giving it Friday afternoon and the weekend. The report has the potential to reverse an entire pair or simply move 100 pips in one direction and not move at all afterwards. I don't recall running into it, but I would say to go ahead and use Friday from 8:30 to Tuesday at 00:00, or right when the market re-opens for your broker. It still recieved its weekend to settle, and got an extra day too. The reason I chose the 100 pip stop was to weed out potential whipsaws. My idea was to capture the market as it started a trend, as the NFP sometimes can do. The ones where it seems more like a consolidation than a definate direction, we get out of by using the two position 50 pip breakeven method. At the peak of trends, it can sometimes get a bit messy...thus the wide stop. Plus, even with 100 pips, it has proven previously to still yeild a nice profit. You may shorten the stop if you want to, but it may have a different effect on your wins...say on those 300+ pip moves that went 80 in the wrong direction first rockrat, try removing the line that says NZD = 1.0; (but be sure to put a semicolon on the line above it to aviod errors) AUD = 1.0, becomes AUD = 1.0; Then, go to the bottom of the file and remove this: x += NZD * Sentinal("NZDUSD",i); and change this: x /= (EUR+JPY+GBP+CHF+CAD+AUD+NZD); to this: x /= (EUR+JPY+GBP+CHF+CAD+AUD); and give that a try. I had to remove the NZD part for my indicator too, though for these backtested results, the NZD was a part of it. Then, make sure to have windows open for all 6 pairs in your case, or at least have the data downloaded. As for Joe Knight, I've let him know of the great work everybody has thought he'd done. He came up with the idea, and is plotting it on graph paper by hand. It was an idea he has just thought of, and followed it to see where it would go. We teamed up, and I produced a computerized version, and entered it with my system into Rob's contest. He's heard of the forum, and said he'd be on soon to chat. -Kev Savage Pip Fiend

Dear traders, According to my IBFX chart, I got a long signal at 02 APR GMT 07:30. Market price closed above 336 SMA, above previous week's high, and above current week's high, while Sentinal Index is above 7 days MA. Do anyone see this? I didn't enter the trade this time as I think that GBP seems to be relatively high now, and I am actually shorting it now and don't want to go against my current trade. I prefer to take the signal after the next NFP. Just want to see if anyone can confirm this signal, so I know I understand this system in the right way. Thanks. Best regards, hksweeper

NFP wasnt on 30/3 it will be on 06/04

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Dear All, I read the whole thread twice. I still cannot figure it out how to trade NFP using the system. Can some one please explain in plain english , how to trade NFP report using this system, it would be a great help... Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Hi Ahil, Thanks for your reply, but I was talking about the first re-entries signal since last NFP (09 March) based on the rule posted by Kevin. The rule is as follow: "Re-entries can be taken only if the price has closed above or below the current and previous week's high/low respectively, and the indicators (Sentinal number nad 336 SMA) support it." If anyone saw the re-entries signal on 02 April GMT 07:30, please kindly confirm. Regards, hksweeper

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Oh! If I followed this signal, I should got at least 50 pips now!

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Hi.. I got eveything, but i just want to know how can i sue NFP to enter the trade???

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Had you download the file in the first message on the first page and read the rules?

--- 帖子 #81 ---
I read the whole thread twice but didnt bother to read the text file in first post.... Thats stupid of me i guess.. Thanks

--- 帖子 #82 ---
what about profit target If i get it correctly when price drops below MA 336 then you close it? And it is a bit tricky to follow it all the time (char is 30min), I mean EA should do it better then me if I cant watch the screen and charts 24H a day. So i guess it would be good thing to even write EA just for closing (if not the whole thing)

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Hello all, This system looks very promising. Like MrMikal, I've been looking at some similar math, but more from an arbitrage position. So, I was excited to take a look. I have, perhaps, a silly question. It seems like there should only be ONE index number. In other words, when one does the calculation, by combining the 7 pairs, you end up with a single index number. If that's true, does anyone know why I might be getting different index numbers using the indicator depending on the chart I have up? I have all 7 pairs up, each with the sentinel index indicator on it (SMA version). Yet, my current index value for GBPUSD is 2.1782 but AUDUSD it's 1.8137. All other pairs have unique values. Thanks. stockwet

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Sockwet, That's a potentially big problem there...if it gives different values, then odvoiusly there is something wrong with the indicator. You're right, all 7 values should come up with one straightforward Sentinal number. I'd hate to be sending you guys mixed signals (har har har), so I'll look at it today and see what the problem might be. Ahil, there is a free service called AlertFX.com (or used to be free anyways, I haven't checked as of late) that will let you know -- via cell phone txt message or email -- when a price has crossed a SMA that you provide. Also, it watches specific numbers and lets you know if you've hit those (good for stops and limits, so you don't even have to be behind your computer to know what you just made ). Give that a try...but your right, the cross could come while you're sleeping, so something automated isn't really neccesarily all that bad of an idea, at least on the exit portion. zamiriqbal, download the file on the first page, and read it The rules file lets you the backbone to everything you'll need; the rest of it has been written here by your trading brothers. -Kev Savage Pip Fiend

hiksweeper, Good eye..almost All of the following is looking at the GBP/USD pair. With that in mind... Last month would have been good for this system...breakeven on initial trade (up 50 pips, or 45 if you count spread), then you have your first re-entry at 3/16/2007 at 13:30, because the price on 3/2/2007 at 13:30 (2 weeks prior..just so happens to be the previous' 2 weeks high as well) is below the close of the candle on 3/16/2007 at 13:30. Notice we didn't take the trade when the candles broke the high. They broke it a few times, but the 13:30 candle was the first to close above. That trade would have been good for 130 pips aprox. (close on other side of 336 SMA and exit on 3/28/2007 at 17:30). So for last month, we would have had about 170 after spread. There is one more re-entry at 4/2/2007 at 09:00. This closes above the high of the last 2 weeks, established on 3/22/2007 at 10:30. As of now, we've hit our 50 pip breakeven point, so tack another 45 onto the total pips, and what do you know? We get our average...215 pips a month That is, of course, purely coincidental lol. I probably would have not taken that last trade. The Sentinal number, if you bother charting it outside of the MetaTrader platform, has created some unique patterns. Its having a hard time pushing above this current level of resistance, but it just punched above it when the last trade was triggered. That's too close for me. Also, you'll notice that on 3/26, the Sentinal number punched below the SMA, and again (even lower this time) mid day on 3/29, and the patterns lead me to believe we're consolidating and going to be picking a direction. A major move that late in the month? I wouldn't have bet on it, so I would have kept my 170 for the month. Anyways, there's my quick rundown of last month -Kev Savage Pip Fiend

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Hello I still canot figure it out how, NFP data or numbers are relative to this method / system.... what does NFP has to do with the system?? Any help on above will be appreciated??

--- 帖子 #87 ---
are there any backtesting results of last few months available? Because IIRC your document doesn't cover the last time.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
OK. I think I found the issue. Maybe one of the developers can comment. It looks like there's an issue with: Inserted Code Index[i] = Index[i+1] + x If I remove that, and simply use: Inserted Code Index[i] = 100 + x everything works OK. For some reason, that line is grayed out. The reason I use 100 is because Kevin said to use a base that you add to the sentinal values. However, I have to say that I like the signals for the previous indicator. I'm just not sure they are accurate.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Did you read the text file that was included with Kevin's zip file on the first post?

--- 帖子 #90 ---
I should also clarify that you shouldn't use either of these files until the original developers comment. The reason is 1) I may be doing something entirely incorrect and 2) I don't know if my modification will work in different modes - I've only looked at in using the pips mode.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Dear Stockwet I did, but couldnt figure out the NFP part, how is it relevant to the system?? If u cud explain ...thx

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Here you go - from the txt file: The theory behind the system is that the NFP provides the primary direction for the month, for the USD. Therefore, the box represents the primary boundary you look at for breakouts. The other indicators are confirming indicators.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
OK. I will have to amend my statement. In truth, reason number 1 in my earlier post seems to be the correct - I am doing something wrong. I re-read the original definition of the sentinal number and realized that you need to add the new value to the previous value. It's a chained or cumulative value, which is why the statement:

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Stockwet, you're right, it's an accumulating indicator. So the reason for different values is the different start date of each chart. It shouldn't affect the relative motion though, and could be corrected with the BIAS value. Missing history data is another problem. I'm not sure about the best way to handle it, but I'll try to make a version that is a little more robust. About problems with backtesting/EA, maybe this is the reason:

--- 帖子 #95 ---
The whole primace behind the system was to catch a move of the NFP. The NFP, in Rob's eyes, is a great market catalyst capable of slowing down trends, reversing a trend, making a pair consolidate...We don't need to know the NFP numbers. We just need to know that price will be effected by the NFP, and try to ride the wave in the correct direction. Taking trades on a breakout of 8:30 NFP Friday forward to midnight on Monday guarentees that a move in a big nature will most likely be the result of the NFP report, since we aren't paying any attention to data that came out before the 8:30 candle, erego before the report. So if it breaks the box and you take your trade, chances are that the movement's catalyst was the NFP report....hence....trading the NFP report Its not all number based, its all price action. You're looking at purely fundamental trading, this is a 20% fundamental 80% technical system probabl.y Hope that answers your question. And as for changing the code to what you did sockwet, sorry bro, that won't work. See, you're in what we coders call a FOR loop. That code is executed, looks like to me, once for every bar. They pretty much start at the beginning, calculate the sentinal number for each bar, and decrement the number of bars until it is 0. Your code pretty much is nothing but Index[i] = x; that he had up there before, but with a 100 offset, so you'll get the same chart with different numbers. His code basically calculates the Sentinal number by taking the previous calculated sentinal number and adding your average to it to get the current one. Logistically, its not the same EXACT way I did it before, but in theory should be the same chart, simply with different numbers. So, when the 336 SMA is layed over it to get our signal, you should get the same 336 SMA as well relative to your sentinal number, giving you the same signals. As for the real difference between the numbers, and why they are different, somebody else is going to have to comment on that. I know C/C++, not MQL4 yet -Kev

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Yeah, I think I've looked at your code 5 different times now, and I can't see anything that would cause things to be thrown off. The only concern I have about your statement relates to this last test I ran. I hand calculated the sentinal value. In other words, I created a var that calculated the raw sentinal value for the current bar. Then, I created a var that calculated the raw sentinal value for the previous bar. Then, created a third var that added them together and then plotted it. I still came up with a consistency across all the different charts. On the other hand, it still doesn't quite feel right. So, I tried something else. I made the number of bars to count a consistent number - 600. That did the trick. So, my suggestion would be to have a max number of bars to count, which would ensure that every chart has a consistent indicator. Summary: I would suggest adding 1) the ability to view as a histogram and 2) the option to count a specific number of bars (must be greater than 336, though.)

--- 帖子 #97 ---
just my two penneth, I am no programmer, but what about chosing some specific date in the past and simply inputting the combined values of the seven pairs at that date as the base sentinel value. One could then reinput this base value with regards to each consequent bars unique average movement away from said base. surely this would create a single value across the spectrum without limiting bar numbers, which would always change the sentinel's base.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Well, after thoroughly confusing everyone with my posts, I might as well post the mods I suggested. This is the same code as the original EA (SMA version), with 2 additions. 1) You can choose to view the Sentinal values as a histogram instead of a line. 2) You can select the number of bars back to go. Remember, you need at least 336 bars in order to draw the SMA. So, pick a big number. By default, it is set to 0, which means all bars in the chart will be used and you will have the same effect as previously - that is, different charts will have varying Sentinal numbers. However, as iya pointed out, the different numbers should not impact the crossings and the overall curve of the dataset. Regards and sorry for the confusion. stockwet PS: Great work on this EA, guys. This code is EXTREMELY clean and easy to read.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Hi Kev, I'm actually quite proficient with MQL and found the code quite readable. The issue wasn't that I was in a FOR loop. Rather, I inaccurately evaluated your definition of how to calculate the value. I missed that the Sentinal value is a cumulative value. That's why iya's statement makes sense - the starting points on each chart are different, which throw off the cumulative result of the numbers. Also, as I know you're new to MQ4. Any code within the "start" function of MQ4 executes every tick, rather than every bar. So, the value is actually being recalculated on every tick movement that comes in. But, since we're looking at BAR level data, you don't see any changes. As you get into MQ4, you'll realize that that is an important point - especially when you program an alert and wonder why the darned thing throws an alert every time a tick comes in. Anyway, kudos on the system. It looks fantastic and I can't wait to back and forward test it. You've done a fabulous job. stockwet

Hi: Thanks for posting modified version of indicator. For some reason, I can't not make indicator to show on my chart. Am I missing something obvious? Does anyone having same problem? I didn't change any setting. Just left it as is.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Who's your broker?

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Hi: You just answer to my problem. for IBFX mini, i had to change the pair symbols. Now it is working. Thanks,

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Hi: I chart your latest posting of this indicator and still current index value is all unique to each different pairs. Did anyone respond to your posting? I read the whole thread and I didn't see it. Also, putting same indicator on IBFX puts out different index value compare to FXDD on same pair/same TF. Is this norm? If it isn't, how reliable is this indicator? Perhaps this # makes no difference as long as it is above/below SMA is matched? While this is unique way of spotting its trend, I still would like to read more about this "sentinal" indicator and its originator, Joe Knight. Does anyone has info on Joe Knight or his original sentinal indicator and how it is used? Sorry to ask too many questions. Any info would be appreciate it. Thanks,

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Dear Stockwet and Kevin-E I would like to thank you for taking time to explain me the system , now i get it... Before i was just wondering that where would NFP numbers fit in this system but after your explanation, i get it... Thanks for helping and keep up the good work!!!.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Stockwet, I have one suggestion for the Sentinal Index indicator. Can we have the bars change color when below or above SMA? This would be much easier on the eyes. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #106 ---
hi stock how excatly use this indicator, i thought we enter using 336 SMA on monday ?

--- 帖子 #107 ---
hi stockwet, wait a minute...Did really someone create an EA? Or did you just mean the Sent. indicator?

--- 帖子 #108 ---
No, sorry. I misspoke. I'm so used to writing EA's now that that just came out by way of habit. Sorry for the confusion. I'm sure there will be an EA soon, though.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
It can be done. However, I really debated about even posting the mods I made. I've found that having a lot of mods for an indicator can get quite confusing for people trying to figure out which one is the right one to use. Also, iya and bubo created the original indicator, and did a FABULOUS job on it. In fact, iya's code is about as clean of code as I've ever seen. I'd like to hear from iya and bubo on how to they want to handle mod requests.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Incidentally, I would not mind seeing an additional indicator that draws H/L lines based on the NFP rule as well as weekly H/L lines, as used by Kevin.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
sorry for asking stupid question, we long when the price open above 336sma on 30 minute chart and we enter after nfp or on monday?

--- 帖子 #112 ---
you got complete rules on page 1, first post by kevin in attch. just read rules in txt file

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Stockwet; This is a super idea. If indicator can draws H/L, there is no 2nd guess or mistakes of drawing at the wrong time line.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Hello Stockwet, Thank you for the the flowers! I am glad the modifications were of use, and I agree that iya did incredibly well with the code. The indicator is in the public domain now and feel free to use or change it. I am happy with it for now and no changes planned, although I have had problems sucking in USDCHF values (does anyone else get error messages regarding missing USDCHF or is something wrong with my data files?).

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Hi guys, just wondering if anybody made an EA for this system? Thanks,

Can someone please put a chart here, showing all : indicators,SMA, BOX, and entry/exit points. I think this will clarify this method further. Picture is worth thousand of words. Thanx in adv.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
EA - short for Expert Advisor or trading programm useable in Metatrader platform (if you can programm you could write a code for entry, exit and everything else and let your computer execute it), you can find alot more under Metatrader hope that helps

Thank you very much!!!!!!!!!

Have I set up my graph the way it supposed to be? Please help me out here! Can anyone also remind me of the rules to enter a trade with this system? Tnx.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Here is how my chart is setup. Waiting for Monday, 04/09/07 @ 12:00AM to complete box. Once the box is complete we wait for the following conditions to be met: "If a CLOSE occurs above or below the box on the 30 minute chart, take the trade ONLY if the 336 SMA backs it up (price is above the 336 SMA for a long trade, below the 336 SMA for a short trade), and if the Sentinal Index is above the 7 day SMA. If the two indicators don't reflect the price action yet, take the trade when they both do." TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Hi; Can you look at my chart and tell me why my Sentinal level # is differnt than your chart? I am using latest indicator, sentinal mod_a version. Thanks a million!

--- 帖子 #124 ---
One of you is using NZDUSD in the calc and one is not. That is what I think. Ther other thing could be the difference in feeds.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
I see your times are differnet and your candles are different.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Hey, Smjones, I am the one not using NZD calculation. What about the time ? What do you mean?

--- 帖子 #127 ---
The difference in the time zones of the two brokers changes the calc slightly... The real point is that it does not matter. The numbers need not be the same from what I have read. Just the relationship between the indicator and it's average is all that matters.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
KEVIN_E, Please take a look at my chart and let me know if I'm understanding your method. The yellow box is not complete but assuming price remains within the current levels, it should look the same. I have a few questions. . Are the times you mention GMT. . We do not take any trades until the box forms (between Friday 8:30 and Monday midnight). . We only take trades when price closes above or below the box. . Re-entries: do we re-draw the box every week based on previous high/low. (I'm a little confused with your #6 in the text doc). Thanks in advance..jj/.

Hello all, following this interesting thread, I am wondering why a individual indicator is being created to measure the strenght of the ? There is a highly industry respected indicator, which is the $DXC, the US-$ cash index. Please find below how it is calculated. It would be highly interesting to see if anyone could code that for MT4 ? In case your broker doesnt provide all the pairs needed, I found ODL MT4 (ODL securities) delivers by far the most available ones. Looking forward to your thoughts, Peter Pan http://www.fxdeals.com/images/stories/dxc-ii.jpg

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Kevin_E and all other wonderful people working on this "Sentinel Index" Based in Italy I know that Latin has influenced many modern languages. Maybe your term "Sentinal" could be written more properly "Sentinel". This could be my contribution to this general effort about "SENTINEL INDEX". Regards, Giuseppe

--- 帖子 #134 ---
is NFP released at 20.30 EST ? what if there is time shift? is the box and everything still using the same time mentioned? to complete the box we have to wait untill sunday 24.00 EST or monday 24.00 EST? thx

--- 帖子 #135 ---
eter, So the USDX is a fixed number? Does it vary or is it the result of the formula above. By the way what is the number? jj/.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
JayJay.. only as fixed as any other rate is it's updated every tic in fact, and traded on the NYBOT as an index http://quotes.ino.com/chart/?s=NYBOT_DX http://quotes.ino.com/chart/?s=NYBOT_DX try to get the DX on ino dot com, in case above link doesnt work. It's calculated with the shown formula based on actual rates of the underlying pairs. (and their weightings, as indicated). THis indicator/instrument was introduced many many years ago, it was included in e-signal a long time for free..no more..so if anyone able to write an indicator could build that in mt4, this would be a great help. Peter Pan

--- 帖子 #137 ---
I am very interested in this indicator as a trend bias tool. Can it be rewritten to display as a histogram of the difference between the two lines? Similar to an OSMA? With the goldenrod line as zero and the histogram above and below that. If possible while you are at it I may as well request if the bars can be colored to reflect higher or lower than the previous bar as with the Awesome Oscilator. Thanks for all the hard work on everyones behalf. Steve

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Peter, I have been to the site (thanks for the link). It does look very interesting and I agree it may prove to be helpful. My knowledge with MT4 programmiing is limited. I wouldn't know where to begin. Any one up to the task? jj/.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
JJ, for a programmer it shouldn't be a hard task to do - I assume. THe US-$ cash index is often used as secondary confirmation in trades, ususally it's used as a separate feed, like any other cross - trendlines and MA's on the DXC are really helpful as they usually confirm trends on the dollar pairs (especially EMA 34 plotted as a wave on H/L/C and trendlines). Also psychological levels of the DXC can stop a move in a dollar-cross ; a ".00" or .50" level acts as natural support or resistance, as the ema 34 often does. Looking forward to anyone able to do this little indicator ! (maybe it can be done not like a normal indicator adhering to a cross, but as something stand-alone like a own crossrate, then drawing and other chart tools are easier to apply) PP

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Hi, You all have the USDX Indicator programmed already. Just put the weights into the input table when you load the Sentinal Indicator. If you don't want to do this each time you load, right-click the indicator in the left hand side 'Navigator' panel, choose 'modify' and then edit the weights, which are set to 1.0 at the moment. Then press the button 'Compile' and you are done. There are many ways of calculating USD indicators. I looked at cross-correlations of currencies, and one lesson is that correlations vary greatly according to time scale and time period looked at. There is no single best indicator for USD trends. The USDX indicator may be good for some specific uses, the Sentinal may be best for the M30 level and combination of lines that Kevin suggests. Overall the lines are pretty similar. Backtesting and seeing if modifications of Sentinal Indicator make a difference are welcome.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Here is a USDX indicator. As shown it is very close to to usdx close on NYBOT It tries to calculate value for all existing currencies. If currency is missing value will be skewed. Value also can be skewed on some bars where not all historical data is present. I tried to adjust it to interbank fx mini names, but not sure if it will work, need exact server name as it appears in AccountCompany().

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Hi Irusoh, many thanks for posting the indicator ! In regards to the many USD indicators available - in general it's simple, as with all technical analysis; it's a prediction/assumption how humans behave - the more trading humans regard one specific indiacator, the better it will work ! In this sense, have a nice easter time ! PP

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Hello all! Sorry, I've been extremely busy these past couple of days. Let me get down to it and answer some of your questions: 1. The holiday, if it changes the times that the markets open, would odviously have an effect on the time that we drew our box. The reason for drawing the box the way that I did was to get the absolute high and low over the weekend, from when the report came out to the following Monday, to allow the pair to cool and decide on a direction, and catch the beginnings of a trend that may be created by the NFP. It hasn't been backtested because I've never run into the problem previously, but if the market was closed on Monday and re-opened the following Tuesday, then I would say use Tuesday at midnight instead of Monday. Same primace, but the pair gets an extra day to rest 2. JayJay, screenshots look good to me 3. radrats, a few of the people in the thread already have their indicator set to histogram. I'm not sure if they've made how they did it public on the thread or not, but if it hasn't, could somebody please post how it was done? Or accept PMs on the subject maybe? Thanks bubo for your post about changing the weights; I was thinking of posting the same thing until I got down to your thread. And you basically took the words from my mouth explaining the use of different indexes with different systems/time frames. And to irusoh too for the indicator. I've added all of the newcomers to the signal list. The next PDF update is Monday after midnight, outlining what the box should look like at that point, and where we will be taking our trades. You can still PM me about adding you to the mailing list, I'm taking requests for it all month. -Kev Savage Pip Fiend

That's funny. I noticed that, too, but figured there's too much momentum now for "sentinal" to change it to it's correct spelling.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Hi Guys, I started yesterday going through the whole post, so far so good. When I downloaded the indexes, non of them show me anything in the indicator window; (except for the name, of course). Nevertheless the USDX does print normally. I tried increasing the no. of bars in the Tools &gt; Charts&gt; etc.,I then tried removing the NZD which my charting doesn't have, I tried the IBfx version, but nothing helped. However when at first I downloaded the first Sentinel it did show the histogram plus MA but then disappeared when moving time frame and disappeared for good. Sorry to be a pain in the neck, but I'm completely confused, even tho' I supppose it's something under my nose. I'll be very grateful for some help!! herty

Hi Merlin, its sad to see such a great thread being put in the recycling bin. Anyways can I ask something... Is it not allowed to use the FF forum to build a commercial system? Im just asking because I was thinking of doing that myself... to build a commercial EA in the forum, similar to how PipBoxer was developed and now sold. Also I see other systems such as vegas being sold... So my question is how should I go about building a commercial system in the FF forum? Regards, Mikhail

--- 帖子 #147 ---
no its not allowed, have you read rule 3? we only allow commercial stuff on the forum in special circumstances. and honesty is the key to the whole thing. pipboxer, for instance, came to me with his proposal and we allowed him to have a subforum, and we are including him in a new program launching soon. vegas never even promoted his stuff here, it was diallist, who is a moderator, who suggested we create that sub forum. let me say that i love EA programmers. i am a programmer myself and love the coder mentality. there is some value in selling an EA, because it can help others develop their own system and to see how a good system is constructed. easily worth the 199 or whatever its being sold for. and programmers-for-hire, these guys are great and i encourage more developers to get into this. BUT there is a BIG BIG DIFFERENCE in selling an EA and selling signals. signals are a scam, no matter how you slice it, there is just no value there. i didnt always feel that way, but after the past two years on this fourm i am convinced that no one benifits from signal services except the signal seller.

Can anyone who is still interested in this system guide me through this old post of Kevin's? I'm having trouble following his monthly breakdown of March. I'm drawing my box from 8:30 EST to 00:00 EST Monday (the NFP for March was on the 9th) but still not seeing his trades and especially the re-entries. Can someone post a chart for me? Maybe I missed this in reading the thread twice but for the re-entries, you use the previous 2 weeks high/low after the NFP Box? Just a little unclear. Thanks! This system still has so much promise!

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Kev, do you ever lock in any profit alog the way or wait until the first TP is hit then lock in BE on the second lot?

--- 帖子 #150 ---
this is my nfp box. i be glad to know if the box is accurate according to the rules.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
bftl that box looks good to me I have high of 1.9687 and low of 1.9636. Not a monster move by NFP standards.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Where is everyone? So should we have looked long on the opposite side of the NFP box?

--- 帖子 #153 ---
In Kevin's rules it is a close above two weeks high for long trade and backed up by Sentina(e)l and EMA: quote: " Re-entries can be taken only if the price has closed above or below the current and previous week's high/low respectively, and the indicators (Sentinal number nad 336 SMA) support it"

--- 帖子 #154 ---
has anybody managed to address the issue of the sentinal indicator not working?

yeah thats wat im saying. the indicator is not working in mt

If you think signals are a scam you should check out www.**********.com . LOL. If only I could really tell you the site. Anyway, www.***********.com is an independent "trading system auditor." They investigate which trading systems are profitable. Then you can set up your own personal hedge fund, and have trades placed automatically in your brokerage account. They monitor over 3,106 trading systems. lol. It's out there, you just don't know where.

I was wondering if anyone knows where you can get a chart that would show the historical data for the US dollar indicator going back to at least the late 90s. The links in this post only go back a couple years. I want to go back to at least 1999.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Sorry everybody. I've had a whole lot go on, and in a small amount of time. This is the first day I've actually checked to see if the thread was still back up. droesparky - you have stopped receiving my updates completely? I remember your email address and putting it on the list. The next update will be coming out today, so if you get nothing, then let me know. Merlin - hi dwothers - you want the NYBOT indicator to go back to 1999, or the Sentinel number? ---snip--- The updates are still running. In the next update, I'll be outlining where we stand, how we got there, and where we will be going. As for everybody's blank indicator window, try to go into History Center and download 30 minute values for all 7 pairs. You need to make sure that you have historical data for all the pairs you will be doing the calculation with. If you still can't get it to work, PM me, and we'll work to see what your problem is. -Kev Savage Pip Fiend

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Hi Kevin, This is what I've looked at, http://quotes.ino.com/chart/?s=NYBOT_DX&amp;v=dmax , and it is what I am interested in, but it does not go back far enough, and that is as far as it goes, about 3 years. I'm not sure what a sentinel number is, but maybe I'll to a search on that. Deborah

Hi, I'm trying to make sense out of the Sentinal Index, but I must be missing something. I understood its purpose is to gauge the strength of the US$. Half of the pairs used will go up on Dollar strength and half will go down, yet positive readings on all pairs are interpreted as strength in the US Dollar. Please correct me if I am wrong. Thanks

Hello Kevin and thank you for sharing! There are no charts in the thread so I need your help please. http://www.kroufr.ru/forum/index.php...ach=2500;image Is this my enter and SL position right? Thank you very much!

Hi Kevin, enjoyed reading the thread so far. I just looked at the backtested data, and see that this is for the GBPUSD pair. Sorry if this has already been answered (stayed up all night reading the thread and looking at data so I'm a bit tired , but can we use this for other pairs like E/U?

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Hi all! Tell me, please, have we to include max/low of 8:30 and 0:00 candels or only candles between them? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #177 ---
aktaurus, in your chart it looks like you have not set your high and low correctly for your "box". Looks like your box only includes 24-hr of data maybe? For April 07, it should go from NFP minute 0 on Friday all the way to Midnight (between Monday and Tuesday) (in this case a day late because of Easter). Your box is way too small. Guys, it seems that you don't have to draw an actual "box" by the way... just draw a line at the highest high in this period, and at the lowest low, and those are your zones.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Quick question. In the txt file, it says: Shouldn't this instead read: ? For example, in your 11/14/06 trade, you go short when the index is below the 7 day SMA.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Aren't there other economic or news reports that should be given as much respect during the month? Why just NFP?

--- 帖子 #180 ---
NFP has long term effects on the direction of the chart...thats why this system is based on NFP.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Hi all, I just made this template which contains vertical lines on NFP dates for Jan-Dec 07. Plus, it contains two bold horizontal lines for the NFP range (friday-midnight sunday) top and bottom. Also, it contains two (non-bold) horizontal lines that you can move at week's end to show weekly high and low for re-entry purposes if need be (by Kevin's rules). At the end of the year, just reset the dates for the vertical lines, and you're ready to go! All objects are labelled so that you can easily identify the proper line when you're editing them (but you should only have to do this at the end of the year). So, at week's end adjust your two thin lines, at month's beginning observe highs and lows between the lime green lines and set you bold horizontal lines to match, and just follow the system! I did this template for the gbpusd pair, so you will have to manually edit the values of the 4 horizontal lines to get them at the right values for any other pair. Hope you enjoy.

Hello again billbss - the pairs are correctly adjusted. The USD/CHF and GBP/USD pairs (for example) in the indicator are each given a different sign (negative for CHF and positive for GBP). So, whenever a negative move occurs on the USD/CHF, it will make the Sentinel go up. Likewise, if the GBP/USD goes down, it would make the Sentinel number go down. Look at the indicator code, you'll understand what I mean. aktaurus - the answer to your second question is to include both the 8:30 and the 00:00 candle in your calculations. The first one, check your PM. JoshDance - great to have you You're right about my typo in the txt file. And though I haven't tested it, logistically we should be able to use a different pair than GBP/USD. The movement is captured by a strength or weakness in the dollar, so I would assume that each USD based pair has the potential to be used. I would advise backtesting it first though --- Another PDF is going out tonight, highlighting what happened this past week, and where we will be heading in the next (and final) week of this month's NFP trade. -Kev Savage Pip Fiend

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Thanks Kevin- I have another question- By 000 EST, Do you mean Midnight Sunday night or Midnight Monday night? In other words, do Monday's prices help form the box? I also assume that by EST you mean either DST or standard time, whichever is in effect.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Hi to all of you, and special thanks to Kevin for sharing this great system with us http://www.forexfactory.com/images/editor/smilie.gif . To Joshdance: Nice Template, thanks for sharing too, makes it very easy to use the system on MT4. One question: Are you interested in implementing the other NFP system, that has also won in the Rob Booker championship? It is very easy to use and would be a perfect addition to Kevin's system, because it deals exactly with the timeframe between (from NFP release time at 8:30 till max. 2 days later, when none of the targets were achieved, the trade will be closed). As I'm not the author of this system, I'm not sure if it's OK to tell it here, but would ask him if it's OK. Let me know what you think, especially Kevin. Thanks so far

Hi, Kevin and how to understand a phrase from the description of system "6. Re-entries can be taken only if the price has closed above or below the current and previous week's high/low respectively"

--- 帖子 #189 ---
If you enter a position, and have to close because the position goes bad or violates a rule, then to reenter, the price must meet all the previous requirements, and in addition, it must be above the previous week's high price for a long position, or it must be below the previous week's low, for a short position.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Hello, JoshDance! Thank you for your reply and advices! Excuse me, but... Are you sure? "Draw box (horizontal line on high and low) between 8:30 EST on NFP Friday and 00:00 EST the following Monday ." Monday = 00:00...23:59 Tuesday = 00:00...23:59 And later you write: So "00:00 EST the following Monday" - is it 00:00 between Monday and Tuesday or between Sunday and Monday ? Thank you once again!

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Thank you very much! Could you also look at msg#191 or msg#185 at this thread? We need your opinion! Thanks!

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Does anyone know if the box ends at Midnight Sunday night or Midnight Monday night?

--- 帖子 #194 ---
aktaurus, if you look right after I said "between Monday and Tuesday", you'll see that I said this: "(in this case a day late because of Easter). " :-) The time range is from 8:30AM to 0:00AM on Monday. It's pretty clear, right? 0:00 on Monday is that time right after 23:59PM on Sunday. The whole idea is, in my understanding, to get the range of trading from NFP all day friday, let the dust settle a bit until Sunday evening, and then catch a few hours of initial cooled-off reaction to the news.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
hey Matrixler, I thought about it yes. I looked at his entry, and was actually a little confused by it. 38 out of the 47 trades are actually entered on the 8:35 candle, and many more than that are entered before (or at) 9:00. His system works on something called an "R Multiplier". Basically, you equate your stop loss to the percentage in your account you would like to have in risk (the max amount to lose). So, if you want to risk 10% of your account (a 5000 dollar account for example), and your stop is set at 20 pips: 5000 (equity) * 0.1 (10%) = 500 (risk) 500 (risk) / 20 (stop) = 25 (dollars per pip risked over 20 pips) 25 (dollars per pip) / 10 (dollars per lot) = 2.5 lots So, if you risked 10% of your account over 20 pips, then every 20 pips worth of profit, you'll have earned 10% of your account. Its all about equating your stop loss with a percentage of the account you want to lose. His max drawdown has been 26%, which is pretty good considering the amount of money he turned over. But his best winners were over 100% because of his R multiplier, and jumping in a trade when he technically can't, gaining hundreds of pips in a quick amount of time. 38 out of the 47 (80%) trades that were taken were all opened on 8:35 NFP day...5 minutes after the report came out. Not only that, every trade that wasn't made at 8:35 was stopped out, which means the system only works for those trades that occur IMMEDIATELY after the report is released. This includes his 5 big trades that launched him over 1 million from 77,000. It would be nearly impossible to throw that much money (or any money at all for that matter) at the market 5 minutes after the report comes out. No broker that I've ever heard of would take an order as soon as the report comes out. As a matter of fact, many brokers suspend orders for an alotted amount of time before and after the report. Also, he states in his txt file that he didn't get to spend very much time on it and would have liked much more to make it better, yet he also states he coded his in 15 minutes in Tradestation. He had rules for entry that simply would never work in a real life situation. Any trader will tell you the same. I know that Rob knows about the flaw, I wonder why he didn't notice? The box is actually from the NFP candle to 00:00 Monday (an hour after 23:00 Sunday). The 8:30 candle and the 00:00 candle are both counted in the high/low process. -Kev Savage Pip Fiend

Hi Kevin, I'm trading News events (especially NFP) for 6 Months now and made some other experiences. It is possible, if you have the right broker (I use IBFX and FXSol) and trade with the right settings. You'll be filled with your order, but the order Gap should be at least 25 Pips away from the current price. So the only adjustment to the other system I would recommend, is to have those 25 Pips distance to the current price shortly (2-5min.) before the News comes out. Not to make this too long here, I would recommend to simply test this with a very small Lot size (don't know if they will fill your order if you throw 50LOTs in but this should take a while to get there...) and on Real account (cause Demo Servers will often "hang" on NFP due to small servers). But I think, you'll see that it is possible and could be very profitably. Anyhow, reading through this thread, testing the indicator and receiving your pdf updates for this sysem, I could say this is with no doubt a very promising, solid looking system, which I'll definetly trade live. Good trades to all of you

--- 帖子 #199 ---
There have been some significant gaps in price (in the opposite direction from the initial spike) that scare me away from NFP trading.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Matrixler, thank you for your insight and your kind words I'll look into these platforms and do some tests when the next NFP comes around. If indeed orders such as this are possible, then I wouldn't have any quams integrating the two systems at all. I think it would turn profits much quicker. Always have to keep an open mind. Also, I'm making some minor to the system. No rule will be added to create new orders or filter out orders, so the system will remain the same. The only thing that I am going to change is the system of stop losses and take profit. I put this system together with a limited amount of time for a contest, and as satisfied as I am with it, I think it can be improved on quite a bit. A reversal system will probably be set in place to limit losses, and a better take profit system will be put together for those who hate seeing your price retreat 150 pips before it hits the 336 SMA to close. Of course, as I make new discoveries, you at FF will be the first to know -Kev Savage Pip Fiend

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Hi billbss, sure it depends on the broker and on settings. Test it with a straddle (position in both directions) with a pending order 5-2min before the news comes out. Pend order gap should be at least 25Pips to both sides according to the current price you have. Set your S/L to 25 and your T/P to 25. I trade it primarely on EUR/USD, but you can use it on GBP/USD as well (take everything to 30 then). Once you are in profit, don't let it go against you, even go for the spread. And if you can, test it live with Micro-Lots. I haven't lost one trade since I use this (on NFP &amp; FOMC, others are more difficult) manually. Thanks Kevin, for keeping an open mind and give it a try to test. It's always hard to optimize a system, even if it's for a long term strategy, because of the fact that one has to wait for a longer time to see it's impact on the current market conditions. But if your backtests show you any improvement to the risk/reward ratio and max drawdown then you should defenitely give it a "try". Again, I like the system and your way of sharing it with us. Maybe we found some cool programmer here who is able to code this one for MT4. Good trades to all of you

Hi Zalakinc, no I'm not. On my way of searching through the net about NFP/News trading, I found this. I'm from Germany, trading forex for 1 Year now and like News Trading especially the NFP.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Because this is a long term strategy, a swap free broker would be ideal. Does anyone have one they can recommend? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Sorry for not being around again for a few days. This is the last week before the next NFP, so I'm crunched for time on a number of projects. The independent backtests should be ideally close to the same, but there are some very important factors to point out. When I did my backtesting, I was doing it fully manual on the FXCM feed in FXCM's TradeStation. All of my times were EST, and the Sentinel number I used had not been put into an mql4 custom indicator yet, so it was all hand updated. I assume many of you are doing the test in MetaTrader with the automated Sentinel Index, which could account for slight differences before you even get down to the testing part. Backtest it how YOU would like to trade it, and optimize according to your schedule and preferences. I made this system public so people could take what I had done, and expand it to fit their own method of trading. If you achieved outstanding backtest results from my system, then by all means, trade it how you tested it I'm very interested in additions people have made or would like to see to the system, and look forward to building something even better together than what I have made alone. JoshDance, I have looked into different MA values when coming up with the take profit scenario, and none (not even the 336 that I seem to keep using) seem to be the most efficient in catching a move and limiting losses. Your price is either going to turn around for 100+ pips until it hits your larger MA, or will tag your smaller MA much sooner than it should and stop your move out completely. I've come up with a new indicator called the Storm number that'll remedy this, and it's based off of the slope and movement of a specific price MA. I haven't done any testing with this number against the NFP system, but when I do, you at FF will be the first to hear about it. All right, I'm off to work a little more. I'm not taking signup requests for the month of PDF signals anymore, as this Friday is our next NFP release, and I feel a re-entry trade this week could prove risky. If you have sent a request within the past few days to be on the mailing list, I will be holding your email address until this Friday, and will send you all of the updates and signals in a zip file to your email for review. Until I can get them all uploaded on a web page, anybody can send me a PM and request the previous PDF files, and you should have them the same day. Of course, as always, free of charge Happy trading! -Kev Savage Pip Fiend

Kevin/others, I heard on another thread that Monday will be a holiday for parts of europe? Is this true? If so, will this impact our NFP initial box timeframe?

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Greetings. I have read through the thread and i understand the concept of what is being attempted and i like the idea as it meshes with my compulsion to breakout trading. One the difference between the three indicators in post 1 that have been updated a few days ago i have a question. All seems to be opperating fine, and i'm wondering which of the three people are finding more visually helpful? If i'm interpreting the data correctly, as of friday's (may 4th) close on the GbpUsd 30m chart we have the price action closing about 20 pips below the 336 SMA. Now looking at the Sentinal Index which i've placed a 336sma set to first indicator i see the data line above the sma. I interpret this as the USD is in positive territory related to the other currencies. Now onto the Sentinal Index_SMA indicator is visualy showing the inverse. I.E. as the USD goes up in value against the others the SI data line goes down very much like the GbpUsd price action might go down when the USD increases in value over the Gbp. Both are working, but the first form, I.E. USD Bullish = Up / Bearish = Down makes more sence to me just like one might read the Williams%R indicator. What do those who have been using these indicators think, as i've just placed them on my chart for the first time today after digesting the thread's data. Cheers, Thom

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Per a discussion with Kevin last night, on his general advice I extended the box period to go till the start of the NY session this morning at 8AM ET due to the UK holiday today and low market activity. That increased the upper limit of the box by a few pips, but nothing major. Currently, my no-trading zone for GU is: High: 1.9974 (hit 07:30GMT on 7/5/07) Low: 1.9846 (hit 13:30GMT on 4/5/07) (data from Alpari UK) So, right now no trades. But these are the numbers I'll use for my trading this month, unless someone else thinks that we should extend the box further...

--- 帖子 #215 ---
oh ok. Good thing it doesnt make a whole lot of difference in this case. I am alreayd in a trade at 1.9970 according to the original rules fo the system. Already down about 40 pips. I hope it works out well.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Well, hopefully that will turn up for you... I'd rather miss out on a few pips up front and be a little more sure of the direction, so even if a candle closed above/below the zone an hour or so after the no-trade-zone ended, I'm still waiting at least a day to try and avoid losing pips upfront.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
hi : Can someone please post a datailed live statement ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #218 ---
As of now we could have technically taken our first long trade for the month. Price closed on 30M above the 1.9974 level. However, it's consolidating a little now, and the sentinel is as of right now back a bit below its MA. Keep your eyes open though!

--- 帖子 #219 ---
We gave it two chances this month and it looks like it blew them both.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
I know, well the second chance hasnt been blown yet....and even if it does,2 trades is not a big deal. it kind of worries me a bit though wiht its 80% accuracy published.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Price has closed under the 336MA on the second trade. It has also lost 50 pips- at least on my chart it has.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Wait a sec, I thought initially the stop would be 100 pips, once the first trade has closed for 50 pips profit and second is moved to break even, then only the Moving average stop comes into effect? which one takes precedence?

--- 帖子 #223 ---
I reviewed the original file for this issue, and its not that clear.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
As Kevin has said before, this is meant to *supplement* your trading strategy, not to be a "don't use your brain and blindly buy and sell" strategy. Remember that leaving pips on the table never hurt anyone as badly as losing them did. Though I thought I remembered the sentinel histogram being slightly above the 7 day MA, it doesn't now appear that it was... maybe I just don't remember correctly. At any rate, how about waiting for a positive confirmation before just jumping in? If the index was above its MA, it was only be a razor thin margin. Give yourself a buffer. Don't blindly pull the trigger. Use standard TA methods like S/R levels and trends when entering ANY trade. I think Kevin would agree with this perspective of the system.

Actually if you read earlier posts, there has only been one entry possibility, and see my last posts for thoughts on that. If you will look back over the backtest data, you will see that indeed some months were losers. Not many, but some. The question is, do you have the patience to wait a whole month (or two even) to see profits with a system? All systems lose. This one appears to have a proven track record. The only thing missing is our patience when we want to make money now, now, now! This should be no news--but if you can't make it through two "blown" trades, then no system will ever work for you, because they will ALL go through runs where two, three, or four losses will happen in a row. The minute you begin to doubt your system, your own confidence diminishes, and no system will ever seem to work for you. This is not a fault of the system--it's a fault with our own fear/greed personalities--we all have them to some extent! Some traders are successful regardless of the system used--meaning that a system does not "blow" trades, we do. So, basically what I'm saying is, why not demo trade the system (if you're not already), and give it a chance to make profits over several months, instead of just giving it 5 days?

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Make money now, now, now? I don't know what you're talking about. I'm not trading it to start with. My only comment was that the trade failed- which it did. On my chart the sentinal index was well above its average and I checked it to insure it was accurate by removing some of the pairs and observing it changing when I did. There was no excuse. The set up was there. The trade failed. As for your earlier post advising the use of trend lines, support and resistance lines etc.- this is a mechanical system. If you want to throw in trendlines and S/R then it is no longer a system, it is a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants discretionary method. I can take you back to every one of his 80% wins and show you a reason not to enter those trades, because of S/R or trendlines or triangles or bad candle formations or whatever. That is not the way the system was presented.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Well nobody is talking about blindly buying and selling.......I am following rules of this system. second of all, about not using the brain, you are not supposed to make discretionary decisions when trading mechanical system.

Don't blindly pull the trigger. [/quote] Ok, here is where I disagree again. when a system is 80% accurate, I wouldnt try to overoptimize it....we all feel like making changes to the systems but sometimes when good system comes around...with decent reward to risk ratio and accuracy...there is no point in overoptimizing it. [/quote] Use standard TA methods like S/R levels and trends when entering ANY trade. I think Kevin would agree with this perspective of the system. [/quote] I agree with you about using TA, but when trading mechanical system....I would say "Blindly" Pulling the trigger according tot the rules of the system makes more sense.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
couldnt agree with you more.....anytime you enter almost any trade, there would a reason not to trade it...S/R , trendlines, candlestick formations, MACD etc etc...

--- 帖子 #229 ---
If there is anything that I've noticed with this method by actually studying the price patters and action over time, is that you shouldn't enter on the first break of the price box. In most situations the price always returns inside or to nearer the top of the box (but still outside) before it reverses and goes the direction the system says it should go. If you would have done this on GBP/USD, it would have kept you out of the trade. I also use this method with the EUR/USD but it doesn't follow as strongly as GBP/USD. Doing so put me in a trade that's at break even right now. Sure it might go the wrong way but the retest of the top of the box and then reversal in the direction expected is what I have found to be a good entry point.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
That sounds like a good idea...I will backtest it.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
I understand your point. However, if you're searching for a black box system that will always do the right thing, I hope you realize it doesn't exist. Even a mechanical system can benefit from basic TA that only the brain can provide. Removing emotions from trading can be good, but removing thinking from it (as with a PURELY mechanical system) is a bad thing. I realize that this method was provided as a mechanical method. I'm saying, why not add to it, and make it your own by doing some extra... I don't mean to sound argumentative, and if I do, I apologize.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Yes, I agree with you Josh. I guess as long as you have backtested it with your discretionary analysis...its ok to trade that way. sometimes, I am too emotional when i see too many pips.....thats why I try to follow strict rules. discretion is not on my side normally.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
As I see it there was a re-entry when it closed below last weeks low at around 1.9833 and sentinal was neg. This would have 1 half exited for +50 and the other half still running with stop at BE. The initial long trade would have been a loss of 2x100 = -200pips with a closed +50 on re-entry and an open position of +59 as of writing. Is this how everyone else sees it? Also a question about a further re-entry if it climbs back up and is stopped out at BE and then falls or rises and closes above/below the weekly high/low so long as the sentinal and MA agree it would be another trade?

First free PDF goes out today. They will be coming out weekly, on every Friday after the markets close. There seems to be quite a bit of discrepancy over trading the system with your own set of rules, or trading it strictly mechanically. Allow me to shed some light on this. Consider this system a brand new house, but built to accomodate. 4 walls, a roof, and the all important doors and windows. When I released this system, I expected the public to learn and grow from it, and make their own informed decisions based on their specific trading style to make this system their own (stated previously, more than once if memory serves me correctly). Though you can live in this house, you wouldn't be near as comfortable unless you had some furniture, appliances, etc. The whole point of releasing my weekly PDF files (goes out today [Friday] after the markets close) is to help you make these decisions when forward testing, or live trading. Notice most of my PDF files thus far suggest reduced lot sizes at times, and even suggest staying out of some of the trades that present themselves. Total mechanical trading on this system is definately possible and has been proven (have created an EA and forward/backtested with positive results), but if you intend to manually trade this system, you'll have to make your own informed and educated decisions, exactly as I do with the system when I release my PDF files. Some trades on this system are more dangerous than others, such as the inital NFP box trade this month (being that the London session was closed). This fact would have led me to not take the first trade, and the second breakout at reduced sizes (since the box is now under a special cercumstance, and I hadn't tested the success rate on the second breakout of the box). This is where your own discretion should come in. Or, you can simply subscribe to the PDF files, and let me furnish your house for you. richo12, you're correct. If this running order hits the breakeven point and closes, another order would be opened on a close below the low that was recently made (new low for the previous 2 weeks) and the other indicators point you in the "short" direction. -Kev Savage Pip Fiend

--- 帖子 #235 ---
As I see it we are close to a possible short re-entry on a 30min close below the weekly low of 1.9747, lets see how it pans out Richo

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Well it penetrated the low but didn't close below it, now its heading back up More waiting... Richo

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Forgot to mention that that makes a new low for the week so now it must close below 1.9740 Richo

--- 帖子 #238 ---
OK I have it as a new short at 1.9712, lets see how this goes Richo

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Well as i see it we were stopped out again, hasnt been a good month so far but we need to keep watching. I think its a total of 350 pips loss Richo

--- 帖子 #240 ---
If I understand the rules correct it looks like we have a new long at 1.9889. I am just not sure if you take the all time high from last NFP or just the high made last week and this week? Kevin can you clarify that please Richo

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Hello friends, I have finally been gotten around to backtesting this strategy...one problem I am having is the difference between gmt and EST time is not always 6 hours is it? I think day light savings time does change it by one hour? is that true? Thanks. Zalak

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Yes thats true. To complicate it further, Europe and the UK don't go on DST the same time the US does.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
to even complicate things further, I just realized that my demo account with MIG doesnt use GMT time...its something else. I will have to do some research i guess. I wish they would just let me change to EST.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
None of them use GMT time except Interbank. If this will help- as i write this it is 23:32 GMT. It is also 7:32PM EDT.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
An interesting thing happened when checking the charts today, the long entry I mentioned last week now shows the sentinal NOT in agreement with the long entry. At the time it was close but definitely a long setup but it is now clearly below the line.......just something to be aware of.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Well this was the last trade for this months NFP and it was a loss I think thats a total of -350 pips Lets hope next months is beter....not long to wait

--- 帖子 #247 ---
OK we have the start of a new month and have our first NFP entry at 1.9840 long. Lets see where this one goes

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Thanks Richo, keep us updated. I personally dont like to trade anything unless its been backtested by me. and i have the timezone issues, so i think when i have time i will just get 1 free month trial of tradestation and test it on that.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
The current open long is around +100

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Hey guys, while manually backtesting...I realized on the sentinetal indicator, the moving average just stays 0 about 50 bars before current one.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
OK so we didnt get a good result, a loss of 2 x 15 pips = 30 pip loss, what a drop and still going. Unfortunately we dont have a short entry so we wait some more

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Hello Kevin, very interesting system. I was in London in 2005 with Rob booker. I would like to write you a private message about the system and some misunderstandings. Perhaps you can answer me some questions !! Thank you very much , kind regards Roger

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Well I think I made a mistake on that first call for June I forgot to take the 1st lot off at +50 and move the last to BE, so that result is +50 not -30. Now we are in the 2nd trade for the month and have closed out 1st half at +50 and moved to BE on last which is +199 at the end of the week Anyone still follow this system?...I havent heard from Kevin in a while

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Well the July NFP is on Friday, Wednesday now, and we have had an exceptional run up . We have had 2 closed for a total of +100 and one is still open and is currently at +411 as I type this. I will leave it open til 0.00am Friday and close it then So this month should make up for the loss in May and some Lets see how July goes

--- 帖子 #255 ---
June NFP trade has now past with a total pips of +425 July NFP starts Monday Total for May/June was +75

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Hello Scott, which of the three indicators from post 1 is the correct one for this strategy? Thanks in advance!

--- 帖子 #257 ---
I am not sure, I did not write them.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
I use Sentinal Index SMA ModA

--- 帖子 #259 ---
July has started well, 1st lot closed at +50 and moved stop to BE....currently at +130 on 2nd

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Why doesn't this thread get much attention?

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Hello, like several other members, I have problems with applying the sentinel index SMA modA indicator to my GBP/USD chart for this system. While it works fine so far on one of my computers with MT4 (MIG server), it works neither with MT4/IBFX nor with MT4/MIG on my other computer. Problem is that the sentinel mod A indicator only shows a blank screen for the current data, while it lacks the MA line in the past, where data occur (data occur until may 10 2007). Right now I'd like to know how important the sentinel index part is for the whole system. How often does it happen that the sentinel index contradicts the price/SMA relation? How much does the whole system become inferior if I leave the Sentinel part out?

--- 帖子 #262 ---
I am using Velocity4X and have no such problems with the indicator, it works fine Also still long 1 half and at +144

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Finally it works for me on both of my computers - thank you! I'm looking forward to trying this strategy after next month's NFP!

--- 帖子 #264 ---
July still open and currently at +440....wow

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Well I have closed out the second lot for +356 so that makes a total of +406 for July so far.....probably no more trades to be taken. Well looks like nobody checks this anymore and Kevin doesnt post either so this will be my last update Richo

--- 帖子 #266 ---
I check it and I want to know why this thread died. Just because it didn't do well in the first month or two, people lost patience and left it for dead.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Well I said I wouldnt post again.....Took another trade using half lots as we are near the end of the month. 1st half exited for +50 and last half now at BE. So all in all an excellent month. I dont know why its lost intereset, probably not fancy enough and low maintenance, not for the trade junky! (glad someone checks the posts)

--- 帖子 #268 ---
I just came across the thread and it looks very interesting, I will study it over the next week, I must say it looks like great returns for a little work. Thank you for the great idea and work that went into it. Regards

--- 帖子 #269 ---
hi, the thread is not dead..it's just summer time! people do vacation, even traders like the see.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Based on the spreadsheet, using fixed risk one can improve the results by 10x ($4M) with no major increase in drawdown, simply by removing the trade which takes a quick 50 pips out of the system. Only trade the trade which has no profit target. Alternately you can reduce risk per trade by 38% and still get the same results. Thanks for sharing Kevin. Regards,

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Because this system is designed to identify long term trends, I wonder if using Jacko's Anti-Hedging would improve the results.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Why did this thread die? What happened to Kevin_E? Is it just me, or did this system have a solid backtest as a track record? Where areeeeeeee you Kevin_E??? And Rob Booker has been silent for months.........

--- 帖子 #273 ---
I communicate with rob regularly. I havent backtested this one but I thin kthis should be ok. I cant backtest it because of day light settings.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
I always liked a good Rob Booker post. Maybe you can let him know that people have noticed his absence.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Wonder where KevinE went off to.... Maybe the method is banking him serious money, assuming the trend in the backtest continued. Is anyone trading this? The thread went silent for no apparent reason.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Does anybody work with this system? No any reply from last Sept....

--- 帖子 #277 ---
What the heck happened here?

--- 帖子 #278 ---
I don't know - back test it. See my comments above about how taking early profits limits profitability / increases risk. Another idea is to trade the system as you would a monthy ORB system, but rather than using the first day of the month use the NFP day as the start of the month. Regards.

I was fortunate (give God the glory, praise, and thanks) and used this indicator (after finding it after I made one of my own) to make over 3000 pips in first two weeks of August trading 1 micro lot each pair and trading six pairs (so only made less than a few hundred dollars taking my account from approx. $460 to a little over $750). But I had to use the daily chart to do so. Playing the daily chart is not going to work nearly that well most of the time (because the USD started a surge in strength at beginning of august that was bigger than moves made in years, that lasted a couple weeks). The problem with this indicator is that it is not updating correctly on the charts in realtime, but waiting on each chart's tick to come in before it updates. You can test this by putting it on all six pairs' M1 charts at the same time. They look correct. Now leave them on the charts for awhile, come back, and you'll see that the line does not look the same on all charts. I could manually update the chart by switching to another timeframe and back, or restarting MT4. Either way is not efficient for trading. If this indicator did update correctly no matter what pair's chart it was on, a boatload of pips is awaiting. Unless someone can make that happen, then the indicator is not trustworthy enough to trade with. The trader MUST know that what they're looking at is trustworthy. Don

--- 帖子 #281 ---
I have been hacking around this indicator for a while, over here is the latest version that should fix the updating problem, at the cost of more CPU usage. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=99145 You could also use a broker that has USDX. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=39722 oh and that server file the guy uploaded in not a zip but a "rar" file so change the extension name or else you will not be able to open it.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Dean, Thank you for posting your reply. I downloaded the indicator from the other thread you mentioned, and see it does calculate a different way. Will check out the USD indicator from that thread and compare to Sentinal Index and also my indicator I made. I will also check out the USD Index. Do you know what currency pairs are used to calculate the USD Index? BTW, as all traders learn sooner or later, if you over-leverage or trade with emotions, you'll lose your gains quickly. Happened to me a couple nights ago. I had my money management set for a certain stop loss and risk. It looked good on paper. When I risked more than I have been, played on a lower timeframe, and saw it go against me, I didn't close the trades, but let them go against me until I had lost all my previous gains I had talked about in the previous post. I was like a deer in the headlights. After being in a funk for a day, I wrote down all the rules I had broken, and plan on reading them every time before I trade. Must plan the trade, and trade the plan - without emotion. And go conservative on money management. Better to build small along the way than risk it all on a trade or two. We live and learn (hopefully). Don

Hello everybody! It has been a long time, hasn't it? Since I posted this, and the overwhelming responce, I decided to get into programming MQL4 code. I have been a programmer for 5 years, but never actually looked into MQL4 until recently. Fortunately, it's extremely similar to C/C++, so my migration was seemless. Now, I'm a full time programmer for a forex firm out of Dallas, and do contract work for a firm out of Austin (Texas). It's been a wild rollercoaster since the first post =) So, with all this in mind, I really apologise for dissapearing the way I did. I'm going to take the liberty of re-coding the indicator. There are two fundamental problems: 1. The indicator will only update on a per tick basis, and only on the indicator that you have attached to the chart. I can, and will, fix this issue. 2. There is no use of the iBarShift function to determine the time of the current bar versus all the previous bars on the different pairs...IE if there was any sort of price/time gap at all in history on any of the 7 pairs, it will effectively un-sync your comparisons, and you will be getting incorrect values for your line (sometimes extremely incorrect). This problem will be fixed too. These are both simple problems to fix, so after I finish up something for my employer this weekened, I'll make the changes and upload the indicator. Update me, how has everybody been doing with this system? I myself have not been keeping up with it, becuase of all the other systems I have been coding for people, I haven't had the time =( Thanks for being patient, and not letting this thread die =) -Kev Savage Pip Fiend

--- 帖子 #284 ---
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! Kevin, welcome back! This was one of my favorite threads and I hated watching it die. How has your system performed since you originally posted it? It seemed to make some logical sense, but unfortunately irrational market behavior can screw up most any great system. Look forward to more great discussion!

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Kevin, If the problems you said you'd fix, are fixed, then I think this would be the best indicator in the world personally. I'm definitely looking forward to the fixed version. Did you see the results I've already had a few posts back? SilverB, I'd be interested in the specifics if you're willing to elaborate, re: 10 x improvment in results Thank you both. Don

Don you can find out what makes up the USDX at: http://www.akmos.com/main/forex/usdx.html you can input all these values into the idicator [except for the Swedish Krona SEK] and see it is extremely close to the USDX. I would like to show you this USDX chart highlighting your recent winning period. Without trying to discourage you, many USD paired systems would have looked amazing in this period. Dean.

Can we all agree that the market dictates any system's performance, and that every system will have hot, cold, and mediocre streaks?

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Yes that is true...Agreed By the way attended a rod booker seminar a few months back, and got to spend some time talking with him. He is smart and has some interesting views on the market.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Dean, Thank you for pointing that out to the others that view this thread, about the surge in USD strength that caused the winnings. I plan on trading a lower timeframe than daily (and maybe even lower than M30), but would need a dependable real-time indicator to do it. The only thing discouraging is my emotions. The indicator and what can be done with it are encouraging. An EA made with the fixed indicator could get past the emotion part. BTW, instead of "normalizing" the indicator by averaging, I simply add the gains or losses from each pair, selling non-usd-based pairs (so minus in front of those in indicator) and buying usd-based pairs. Since the Sentinal Index indicator averages, you can multiply the result from each swing by 6 to get how many pips would really be realized by buying USD or selling USD in those pairs - realtime. So this is not the NFP system I'm using, but using the same indicator with different moving average Period on different timeframe. Hundreds of pips could be made daily is what I'm seeing using 48 SMMA in M1 timeframe, if an EA was made or someone had the intestinal fortitude to trade 6 pairs each time. It's rough manually, especially having to manually update and playing on lower timeframe like M1. Don

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Hey Don, Sorry but I got some more "heads up" that took me ages to realize, if you are trading small time frames especially like M1 with these indicators, in Metatrader if price does not move a pip in the candle time frame you are using then metatrader may not display a candle, it just leaves it out, meaning on M1 time frame there may not be 60 candles an hour, so when the indicator goes and checks all the pairs it might not return with the correct values for every pair, and it gets worse when you try and show the indicator on a chart that does not have 60 candles on it but it is still trying to show 60 candles worth of data. Maybe Kevin knows how to correct this. On higher time frames this is not so much of an issue as price generally moves a pip :-) Emotions, this may not apply in this case but it reminded me, here are 2 interesting interviews with Mark Douglas "Trading in the Zone" Go here and in the left menu click on the 2 called Mark Douglas. http://www.woodiescciclub.com/start.htm Why not use the USDX and put a MA directly on that chat ? Dean.

Hi All, I've been using only one indi in my work Her it is: http://articles.mql4.com/422 It is still lagging like any other indi but gives you a very good picture of the market I think it is similar to what is being developed here would some of the coders hijackers have a look in the code and explain what is the difference? Hope this will help in future developments

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Dean, This is what I was getting at with that iBarShift talk. Somtimes, there may be a gap in time, so going back one candle at a time on all pairs may prove disasterous considering you're taking for granted the fact that they match up perfectly. The fix is easy, and I'm working on that right now, chances are I'll have the fixed version up before the end of our labor day weekend (by Tuesday). I had an idea though...would it be easier on you all if I created a script that literally gives the Sentinal index its own chart (similar to the USDX picture posted a few back)? That way, not only can you put a moving average on it the same as suggested in the system, but you can put any indicator you want to on it to determine the USD pair based direction. It would go from being an indicator to being it's own symbol. If you like this idea and would like to see it, let me know..I've coded something similar to this recently and the code is straight forward. -Kevin Savage Pip Fiend

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Kevin, I have had the opportunity to use a script. The problem I had with the script I used, was jumping into the trade when there wasn't enough pips to be gained to even pay for the set of trades, let alone profit (talking about lower timeframes, and really the script was tick-based, so lower than one minute, so too much of a microscopic view and not enough of a big-picture view IMHO). It would need to be like a currency chart, where one can look to the side of the chart to see how many pips the swings make up, so that one could look at potential of upcoming moves and better judge a certain distance up or down as a certain number of pips, and there could be a consistent correlation between them, e.g. 15 pips every quarter inch). This would bring up why not just use the LiteForex Index (symbol USDLFX, which is the USD Index at Lite-Forex.org). Which brings up the question what is someone attempting to do. The reason I don't use USDX is that I only want to track the currencies I would be trading. If I'm trading 6, I only want to track the P&amp;L for those 6 if either buying USD or selling USD. I would prefer an accumulation indicator myself like what is already made (without the averaging), just made to update realtime. Then hopefully EA after that. I've been working on it for months, but without indicator acting right (and I'm not a programmer really, struggling to learn anything I do), it's been a hard road. I just know in my thinking, this could be more profitable than other things simply because we're tracking the P&amp;L values of multiple currency pairs, and in essence equity, by using one "equity" line and one moving average. Powerful. And not just because this indicator says so, because an indicator I built has said so, trading with it has confirmed, another indicator has been built that says so, and a script I've used has confirmed. USDX and other indexes for USD have also said so. But I don't want to track any currency pairs I'm not trading or are not available. What do you think? Don

--- 帖子 #296 ---
I posted this from gmail account a couple hours ago. Since it hasn't come through to this thread in a couple hours time, I figured it got lost somewhere. So I replied here instead of through email. So if it gets posted twice, sorry. Dean, I don't use USDX because I'm looking for an accumulation indicator, with either 0 (not used) or 1 (used) weighting for each pair. No need for more complicated math in my approach. In fact, more complicated math would work against me. To do this in the Sentinal Index indicator, I simply remove the lines: x += -NZD * Sentinal("NZDUSD",i); x /= (EUR+JPY+GBP+CHF+CAD+AUD+NZD); // FIXME: incorrect if a pair is not available When I do this, I am removing NZD being used in calculation, and I remove averaging, so that I get true P&amp;L of buying 3 pairs and selling 3 pairs at the same time. I need real hard numbers of P&amp;L for each pair I want to trade, added together to form one P&amp;L line. If monetary value of pips are added, then this becomes an equity indicator. It tells if I would be making money or losing money. I would rather put a moving average on equity, which looks at all trades as one, and gets to the "bottom line". And I must know that the calculations are using only the pairs I want to trade, with the simple math that's used in the present indicator, with minor changes. I realize this is different than what has been done before, but I can easily change the fixed NFP indicator to be suitable for my needs, as noted above. Emotions are one thing to overcome, but I can't do that when I know the indicator is not trustworthy on the timeframe I'm playing. Don

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Found this on the net: USDLFX = SQR ((USDCHF * USDJPY) / (GBPUSD * EURUSD)) So we see that it's not a simple addition of P&amp;L of multiple currencies, like we have in the Sentinal Index indicator (if averaging is removed). It seems everything besides this indicator (and if using averaging, even this indicator) uses more complicated math to give a USD value. Every one of them overlooks trying to trade multiple currencies, so none merely adds P&amp;L like could be done to see true potential. Don

Kevin, After looking at the USDLFX M30 chart, and using MACD on it, it looks good. The problem with that chart is that it is only using four pairs. Being able to choose which pairs to use would be great. So whether you fix the indicator, or choose to do a script, either will be appreciated. You're right though, the script would allow us to use other indicators of our choice on it, and I think you got a great idea there. Thank you, Don

Hey I tried that formula......... it did not work for me.......... no matter where I placed the decimal point on the USDJPY. Although at first look it appears so, but this line does not do averaging. x /= (EUR+JPY+GBP+CHF+CAD+AUD+NZD); make an indicator with it in and one without, I think you will not be able to tell the difference in the actual indicator lines. The values in the vertical scale will change but not the line itself. You can choose what pairs you want to include/exclude in my indicators by...... like you request, placing a 0 or a 1 in the input tab next to the currency, [or any value you like if you only want it to partly influence the indicator] Dean.

Don I finally figured out what you are meaning when you say P&amp;L, and that being you trade a basket of currency pairs, and have the indicator only show the combined direction of those basket of pairs. I like the idea. But how do you know when the indicator is going to go up or down, this is what I have been trying to work out for over a year with these indicators, you think to buy the dips when it is rising only to find the low of the dip just got broken. It is kinda like placing a MA on a chart, making the candles invisible and then trying to trade the MA, you just never know when it will turn. But I hope you can prove me wrong :-) It's easier, although not easy, to look at a candle chart of those basket of currencies [ USDX EURX ] and apply your trading technique to that, for when price hits a lever and retraces you can actually make a bit of sense of the chart and see if it was a Support or Resistance level....... etc, so if Kevin can make a script to display a self make basket of pairs viewed as a candle chart, then that would be interesting. Dean.

Dean, I've traded it using the P&amp;L line crossing the moving average for signals (2 SMMA on D1, 48 SMMA on M1). By the time the moving average starts to head down, a lot of the move may be over. IMO the market has been consolidating recently, so it's hard to make money trading this basket (unless you're up during London maybe). August was a great month trading this. Maybe after NFP we'll see a definite direction. Trading six currencies has been rough for me. I don't know about others that may trade this. You never know which way the market it really going. The direction for the M1,M5,M30,M60,H4,D1, etc. can added to see overall direction, MACD added may help, but also may hurt. I can't tell you the perfect combination. But one thing is for sure - if we don't have a reliable P&amp;L line to put the moving average or other indicators on, it's all in vain anyways. I too think a script that made our own chart with candles formed using all pairs we want to include would be interesting. My thoughts have been: we can add or subtract pairs and may be able to affect smoothness of the P&amp;L line, and therefore the smoothness of the moving average, to make trading it easier. But one thing is for sure: one either must have patience to wait for the moves and then patience to sit through the move, or we need an EA made. Sometimes there are two big moves a day, but who wants to or can sit 24 hours watching the screen? But again, an EA built on a faulty indicator is not going to be reliable, so first things first: get the indicator fixed or make a script, then the EA. Don

That formula I quoted is used in USDLFX in Straighthold Trader (custom version of MT4) from lite-forex.org. I never said I would use it. I wouldn't. it does do averaging. the / in front of the = is saying to divide the total that was previously added together in the indicator, by the number of pairs used. Averaging. You added it for "normalizing", I understand. The real P&amp;L number could just as easily be obtained, instead of taking away that line, to just add another line: x *= (EUR+JPY+GBP+CHF+CAD+AUD+NZD); ... which would take the normailized/averaged data and mutiply it by the number of pairs used. If you can, look at it like this: Say you have 6 pairs, and 3 USD-based pairs gain a pip each (you'd be buying these pairs), and 3 non-usd-based pairs lose a pip each (but you are taking the negative, because you are selling these pairs, so this would be 3 gained pips). You have gained 6 pips. Sentinal would display that as a 1 pip gain (1+1+1+1+1+1=6 &amp; 6/6=1). My version where I removed the line would display 6 pips as the gain (1+1+1+1+1+1=6). That's one way to make P&amp;L. If I just added a line to multiply instead of taking away the line to divide, I would still get 6 (1+1+1+1+1+1=6, 6/6=1, and 1*6=6). That's another way to make P&amp;L, although I just see it as using unnecessary math. All three versions of the indicator would look the same. The Sentinal Index would have different numbers than the other two, and the other two should have the same numbers theorhetically. Don

Dean asked how do we know what direction it is going to go. On a high enough timeframe, or using moving averages on either higher or lower timeframes, we can see trend direction. We trade with the trend. I like the "bigger picture", and would like to use M30 or a timeframe around there. Tried to trade M1, and it's just not worth it to me emotionally or physically. I'm ultimately after an EA. BTW, just looking at the trend this past week: Starting since last Friday, selling EURUSD, GBPUSD, and AUDUSD, and simultaneously buying USDCHF, USDCAD, and USDJPY, holding for the week, we would be in profit about 1330 pips. Yesterday it was up over 1600 pips. If we could play the intraday charts, not too small timeframe, we could make many more pips. Add good money management, build an EA that can trade the multiple pairs, and you have the best automated business in the world which I have been researching for about 10 months now. I believe God will make it happen. He has already brought me a long way into accomplishing it. I cannot do it alone. Anyone who participates to make it happen, gets a great business for themselves too. So it's a win-win situation. And the more people that use this strategy the better it is for people already using this strategy - as long as we're all using the same timeframe and buying USD and selling USD at the same time. My emotions make it difficult to watch it go against me, so that's why I am ultimately after an EA. Don

Kevin, You said that chances were you would have the fixed indicator posted about a week ago. Can you please give an estimated time of arrival on that fixed indicator or script? Thank you, Don

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Kevin, Don't know if you've had a chance to try to fix the indicator. If it would be easier for you, maybe a script would be better? I have a money management equation to add to an EA or indicator or script if needed. If there's anything I can do to help the progress, let me know. Just had an idea to use the indicator in a different way than the original strategy (which you said was fine at the beginning of the thread), so I brought the thread back to life after a few months of no one posting, and about a year since anything real meaningful posted. I did it to help us all. Have I done something wrong? Sure would like to hear from you. Please don't let this thread die again, when we all could benefit. I have worked too long to see this strategy die like this - it would suck big time. You see, I'm not a pro trader, and it would change my life. That's why I have worked as hard at learning Forex as I have. But my emotions and an indicator needing fixed are obstacles to that goal. Thanks, Don

Hey fellas! Sorry about the delay, Hurricane Ike beat down my home town so I had to do the whole evacuation thing, that on top of my current work put a decent delay on this, but here it is. This is the completely re-written indicator with the iBarShift fix in it, as well as couple of additions. I didn't use any code from the previous indicators (save for the external variables, though I handled them differently). This indicator automatically checks to see if you have data in each of the pairs, and if not, will default to their mini counterparts (if it cannot find values for EURUSD, it will look for EURUSDm automatically). Also, this will find the lowest bar count on each of the 7 pairs to make sure we aren't pulling data from bars that aren't there. For example, if you have 5000 bars in the EUR chart and 2000 bars in the GBP chart on the same timeframe, you do not want to be trying to grab values for the GBP chart on bar 3000 or so, there will be nothing there and you will come back with an incorrect Sentinel value. Here is the rundown for the external variables: Weights -- the following values can be set anywhere from 0.1 to infinite. If you don't understand these, please read through the whole thread. Setting the weight to 0 will omit the pair from the calculation. EUR JPY GBP CHF CAD AUD NZD AppliedPrice &lt;-- 0 is close, 1 is open, 2 is high, 3 is low. Anything above /below these values is set to close (0) automatically. MA_Value &lt;-- Moving average value set to 336 by default MA_Shift &lt;-- Shift for the MA. Set to 0 by default. MA_Method &lt;-- MA Method (0 is SMA, 1 is EMA, 2 is SMMA, 3 is LWMA). Anything above/below these values is set to SMA (0) automatically. A quick note or two about this indicator..if you find that your indicator doesn't go very far back into history, that is because you need to download more data for the pair with the lowest number of bars. After you attach Sentinel_Revised, in your Terminal window, click the "Experts" tab. You'll see something that's similar to: Pair(NZDUSD) bars = # Pair(AUDUSD) bars = # Pair(USDCAD) bars = # ...etc... This will show you how many bars are in each chart. Your indicator will ONLY build values for your LOWEST number here to avoid incorrect values. To download more data, simply open the respective chart and repeatedly tap the PGUP or Home key repeatedly while connected to the data server. Once you obtain more data, simply re-attach the indicator and repeat the process if you feel you still don't have enough data. Please be kind with your comments here, I coded this in about an hour, and it's definitely almost 5am lol. Look forward to what you guys think about this new revision and please keep a look out for the scripted full chart version soon. -Kev Savage Pip Fiend

Kevin, I've seen that it looks much different than the last indicator internally as well as on the charts. Since I'm working as well as trading, it may take me a little bit of time to get to checking it out. Don

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Kevin, Forgot to ask: How can I change the indicator (new version) to add all pairs together and not average (so as to use it in a different way than NFP thread has been about)? Or does it not average? It's just hard for me to understand code until I look at it for a bit. Thank you for posting the fixed indicator BTW. Are you going to test it out on the NFP system? Don

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Yeah I started from scratch, and condensed the code with alot of loops to keep it small...also there are a couple of extras in there. If you want to NOT take the average, simply edit line 168 from: divNumber++; to: // divNumber++; and change line 172 from: sentCalc /= divNumber; to // sentCalc /= divNumber; ---- Basically just omit the line (by putting // in front of it), and the values you get will just be added, not averaged. -Kev Savage Pip Fiend

Hi Kev, Just a quick thanks so you know your efforts are appreciated. I have not had the time to run the test of the indi, but I look forward to doing that soon. More to come... Thanks, thanks, thanks. VBro

I have added 2 indis on top of the sentinal indi window. 1. 50 SMA 2. 18 EMA 3. I have changed the yellow MA to an 89 period I am using on the 30 min chart. lookin to trade in the direction indicated by the position of the blue index line ( above or below the 89 EMA ) in addition to 1 or more of the moving averages. when the 18 ema crosses over the 50 sma, it may give you a heads up of a possible index cross over the 89

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Kevin, First of all, thank you for fixing the indicator. Much appreciated. I see that you say the default moving average value should be 336, but in the revised indicator, it is set to 100. I made that change to be 336 as default in the indicator, and have posted that as an attached indicator named Sentinal_Revised_Extended. I don't like using Averaging, so have made this a user Input. It is True by default, meaning each pair's Pip Gain/Loss will be added together, and then divided by the number of pairs whose weight is 1 (number of pairs used). If set to False (the way I plan on using it), each pair's Pip Gain/Loss will be added together. Just like the original indicator, since we are trying to get USD value, pairs that begin with USD are added, and pairs that end with USD have their negative added. Why? Because USD value would be going up when pairs that begin with USD go up, so we would be buying those pairs when they go up. Pairs that end in USD would have to be sold for the USD value to go up when pair is going down, so we add the negative because we aren't buying these pairs as USD is going up, we sell these pairs as USD goes up. I also don't like having to deal with decimal places, so I have added Input to PipsAsWholeNumbers, which is False by default. If set to True, then as the input notates, we'll see pips as whole numbers. So a gain of 100 pips will be seen as 100, not .0100. fx__ninja also talked about using 2 more moving averages, so I added those as inputs as well. Use2ndMA and Use3rdMA are set to False by default, but can be set to True and inputs below them set for their Period, Shift, and Method, so that if used, all three MAs can use different periods, shifts, and/or methods. Let me know what you think. I don't think I messed up the indicator, just added options for users if they wanted to use them. Also to note: Although I didn't remove the NZD from this attached indicator, even if set to 0, it is looked at to get how many bars are available, so just having NZD there makes the Sentinal and Moving Averages shorter (unless the user also downloads NZD data like you said to using PGUP or Home key). Hope this helps make the indicator more versatile for more people's needs. I have kept any additions set to False so that the indicator looks like what Kevin last attached by default (with the exception that Moving Average Period is set to 336 instead of 100 per Kevin's post when he attached the Sentinal_Revised indicator). Hope this helps. Don

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Kev, Maybe I'm overthinking this... You use 336 to get the moving average of the previous week right? And it's true there are 336 1/2 hour bars in a 7 day week, but the charts don't have bars for the weekend. So wouldn't it make sense to figure out how many bars are missing because of the weekend, and then subtract that from 336 to get our M Averages? Or am I missing something? Just a thought. VBro

I've found that when I decided to add 'PipsAsWholeNumbers' Input to Sentinal_Revised_Extended, it reads the same on all charts except USDJPY (1745.92 vs. 174592). I know this has something to do with JPY only having two decimal places, but haven't figured out how to fix it yet. AVERAGING VS. NOT AVERAGING: As far as averaging vs. not averaging, it looks to be working. If the user wants a "relative" USD index value, use averaging. If, on the other hand, the user will actually be buying the usd-based pairs and selling the non-usd-based pairs when the Sentinal line is going up, and wants to know how many total pips would be gained from one point on the sentinal line to a higher point on the sentinal line if "buying usd", and want the "absolute" pip gain, don't use averaging. If "selling USD", when Sentinal line going down, buy non-usd-based pairs while selling usd-based pairs. NOW WE TALKIN' 'BOUT SOME PIPS! If we could use whole numbers and not decimals, it brings this reality out better when looking at the numbers and subtracting one point on line from another to get TOTAL pips gained using/trading all the pairs together. I will try to fix it to read same on all pairs' charts, including USDJPY, or maybe Kevin can look at it and see if he can fix it. Either way, this is looking good. Don

Had the Sentinal Revised Extended on EURUSD M1 chart, and it looks like between 09.22.08 1:54 to 09.22.08 2:19, that if "selling USD" (buying EURUSD,GBPUSD,AUDUSD and selling USDCHF,USDCAD,USDJPY) because it crossed below moving average, could have made almost 1000 pips in less than a half hour? (It's moved back up a good little bit, so could have made some now "buying USD") 1000 pips in that amount of time. Is this number right? If so, that's SO COOL! LET'S CHECK (numbers are approx.): EURUSD buy 1.4438, sell 1.4489 +51 GBPUSD buy 1.8303, sell 1.8329 +26 AUDUSD buy 0.8292, sell 0.8303 +11 USDCHF sell 1.1052, buy back 1.1009 +43 USDCAD sell 1.0490, buy back 1.0491 +1 USDJPY sell 107.00, buy back 106.43 +57 So when we add those together, we get 189 pips in less than a half hour, not 1000. So numbers are not correct, but drawn Sentinal appearance remains unchanged, so can use revised or revised extended to do these types of trades. The problem is how there's only two decimals after USDJPY vs 4 decimals for the others. It looks to affect both sentinal revised and sentinal revised extended indicators, which needs checked again.

Just wanted others to note I was using FXDD when I told the times in the last email. If using MT4 download from MetaQuotes, it would be 09.21.08 22:54 to 09.21.08 23:19. It seems to me that FXDD's download keeps up with changes faster, so I use it, with MetaQuotes MT4 as a backup if I need it. Don

--- 帖子 #317 ---
disbellj, Just FYI, the reason you are getting decimal places is that you are using the constant "Point" to divide by. Constants depend on what chart you have the indicator/EA attached to. When you attach it to any chart besides a JPY based chart, you are dividing your entire number basically by the 2 constant instead of the 4 constant...and 4 being the max number of decimal places in our USD based pairs, you end up with a whole number. By attaching your indicator to a Yen chart, you end up dividing by the 2 constant, and you get only 2 decimal places removed. You can solve this by simply dividing it by 1000 instead of leaving it to the Point constant. -Kev Savage Pip Fiend

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Kevin, I remember I had to use 100 for USDJPY and 10000 for all others when I made my indicator (that didn't update correctly), to get the correct pip gains for all pairs. Trying 1000 for all places gives me results that match on all charts, but the range totals not even one pip, so I know this is not what I'm after. So I'll try to figure it out (probably will have to break USDJPY out from the rest and calculate it differently). Thank you, Don

--- 帖子 #319 ---
BTW, I'm using Average set to False, and PipsAsWholeNumbers set to True. Don

--- 帖子 #320 ---
When using PipsAsWholeNumbers, I'm having to multiply USDJPY by 100, and multiply everything else by 10000, so no division. Once I get this figured out how to fix it in the code to read correctly when using multiple pairs, I'll post an update. Don

If I look at last two bars on all 6 pairs' charts in FXDD, the time would be 2008.09.22 18:30 bar and 19:00 bar I'm looking at on all 6 pairs: EURUSD 18:30 close = 1.4695, 19:00 close = 1.4688, so gain of 7 pips if selling. GBPUSD 18:30 close = 1.8482, 19:00 close = 1.8462, so gain of 20 pips if selling. AUDUSD 18:30 close = 0.8439, 19:00 close = 0.8424, so gain of 15 pips if selling. USDCHF 18:30 close = 1.0834, 19:00 close = 1.0827, so loss of 7 pips if buying. USDCAD 18:30 close = 1.0381, 19:00 close = 1.0376, so loss of 5 pips if buying. USDJPY 18:30 close = 106.35, 19:00 close = 106.40, so gain of 5 pips if buying. So add these gains/losses together, and you get: 7+20+15+(-7)+(-5)+5 = 35 But if I look at: original Sentinal Index (set to MODE 1 for pips), at 18:30 close is 701.2857, 19:00 close is 701.4286, for gain of 0.1429. Sentinal Revised, at 18:30 close is 17.3850, 19:00 close is 17.3938, for gain of 0.0088. Sentinal Revised Extended 2 (attached), at 18:30 close is -52196, 19:00 close is -52137, for gain of 59. So we gained 35 pips during that half hour if we would have been "buying USD", but none of the indicators are showing this correctly. Even if I take averaging of original Sentinal into account, and instead don't average, that would be .1429 * 6 pairs, to equal .8574 gain. Well, I would think it would be simple to fix this, but like most things, it does not appear to be so simple. If I look on the chart, Sentinal Revised Extended 2 looks more like original Sentinal Index indicator's lines, where Sentinal Revised doesn't look like either of the other two. This leads me to believe that the decimal is making a problem in Sentinal Revised indicator, which I've (hopefully) fixed in Sentinal Revised Extended 2 by separating USDJPY from the others and making PipsAsWholeNumber set to True. When Sentinal Revised Extended 2 has PipsAsWholeNumbers set to False, it looks like Sentinal Revised when on chart. When Sentinal Revised Extended 2 has PipsAsWholeNumbers set to True, it looks like original Sentinal Index (MODE 1) when on chart. I'm thinking Sentinal Revised hasn't taken the decimal problem into account, where the other two are. Don

Kevin, I have attached my original indicator I built, as yet another confirmation to what I'm seeing. This indicator looks like Sentinal Index and Sentinal Revised Extended 2 indicators when put on the chart. But my original indicator does not update correctly, just like Sentinal Index doesn't. If you put Sentinal Index, Sentinal Revised, Sentinal Revised Extended 2, and Dons 6Pair BUYUSD PipRange092298 on the chart, which one looks different than the others? Sentinal Revised. Needs checked. Kevin, I do thank you for updating/making a new indicator, I just want and need to make sure it's right before using in trading. Thanks again, Don

--- 帖子 #324 ---
I would recommend the Extended 2 version to use at this point, to test with. I would not use any of the indicators in trading until they can be verified to be correct in calculations (which we can do by manually taking a 30 minute period, and checking if the combined pip gain or loss is the same in the indicator as it is in reality). Don

--- 帖子 #325 ---
If you place the Sentinal Revised indicator onto a M30 chart (not USDJPY, just in case it causes a problem doing so, I don't know) using the defaults that came with it. Now place it again on the same chart with the first one, except make every pair (EXCEPT USDJPY) to be 0, leaving JPY at 1.0. Now these should look different, but they don't. This is just more proof that USDJPY value is leading (2 decimal places), while all the other pairs aren't contributing (4 decimal places taken for two would make whole numbers 1/100th their actual value, so would explain why USDJPY is leading and the others look non-existent even when made 1 in inputs, meaning used). Each pair's (EXCEPT USDJPY) 100 pip gain would be seen as a 1 pip gain, so basically not contributing. The fix would be to make the USDJPY pair's value be divided by 100, to make it 4 decimals, and therefore the same as the other pairs involved, before adding the total gains together to make the Sentinal. Then, all I wouldhave to do is multiply by 1000 to make 4 decimals to be no decimals (make pips as whole numbers). Kevin, I hope you know that you did a great job building the indicator. I have just found this problem that has made this indicator needing more work. My day job is to find problems and solve them (in commercial printing as a prepress technician of 13 years, 15 counting college). When I see multiple tests/ways that tell me the same thing, then I must take it seriously. And since I consider I'm building a trading business, I must take this seriously. Thank you, Don

--- 帖子 #326 ---
OK. I figured out I needed to divide USDJPY by 100 to make it 4 decimal places like the others, then multiply USDJPY by 100 to get whole number. These two moves strike each other out, so I removed the multiply by 100 on USDJPY in indicator Sentinal_Revised_Extended2. I then left the others multiplied by 1000 to make whole numbers. This should work fine now. The appearance on-screen should look like the original Sentinal_Index, except this indicator looks to update correctly on the charts (thanks to Kevin. woohoo!). I have looked at the results of this indicator's numbers when looking at the times I mentioned in earlier posts today, and between 2008.09.22 18:30 bar and 19:00 bar on EURUSD M30 chart the result is +35 pips, just like reality. Just as before, I have set moving average Period to 336 (although the 100 SMA Kevin set as default in Sentinal_Revised looks like my 48 SMMA I use, so I would suggest using it on M30 chart instead of 336). I have set inputs Average to True, and PipsAsWholeNumbers to False, so you get a "relative" USD Index value. I will use Average to False, and PipsAsWholeNumbers to True, so I get an "absolute" pip gained from "buying USD" (buying USDCHF,USDCAD,USDJPY and selling EURUSD,GBPUSD,AUDUSD). If the line goes under the moving average, I will "sell USD"(selling USDCHF,USDCAD,USDJPY and buying EURUSD,GBPUSD,AUDUSD). The indicator to use is attached: Sentinal_Revised_Extended3 Sorry if I've posted too much, but it took going through it to get to the right results. Don

--- 帖子 #327 ---
I was laying in bed last night and figured out I had made a mistake with the last indicator. OK. Let's logically work through this: USDJPY has two numbers after the decimal. One pip is 0.01. We want to make it 0.0001 to be like the others, so we can add all gains together. If we didn't do this, I'm thinking that one pip gain on each would look something like this: EURUSD +0.0001 (will be positive if we are selling and it goes down) GBPUSD +0.0001 (will be positive if we are selling and it goes down) AUDUSD +0.0001 (will be positive if we are selling and it goes down) USDCHF +0.0001 (will be positive if we are buying and it goes up) USDCAD +0.0001 (will be positive if we are buying and it goes up) USDJPY +0.01 (will be positive if we are buying and it goes up) equals 0.0105 on Sentinel Revised instead of .0006 like would be correct. This needs to be verified by someone else. Note: The selling vs buying may be confusing, but we "buyUSD" (buy USDJPY,USDCHF,USDCAD and simultaneously sell EURUSD,GBPUSD,AUDUSD) when the Sentinel crosses above the moving average, and "sellUSD" (sell USDJPY,USDCHF,USDCAD and simultaneously buy EURUSD,GBPUSD,AUDUSD) when the Sentinel crosses below the moving average. Since we need to make USDJPY to be four decimal places, 0.01 / 100 = .0001. So we divide USDJPY by 100, and don't have to do this for the rest of the pairs, since they are already four decimal places, so one pip is equal to 0.0001. Now if I want to make whole numbers, I simply multiply all pairs by 10000. 0.0001 x 10000 = 1 I have made these logical changes, and tested the indicator a little. I'm not sure if I need to upload it or not. Something still doesn't look right to me. I would rather Kevin or someone else take a look. I just know that to get whole numbers, I should be able to multiply numbers with 4 decimals by 10000 to get a whole number, and it should numerically match the Sentinel without averaging, except for the decimal place. Don

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Alright. I decided to go back to Sentinel_Revised that Kevin posted, and just take out everything that might be causing trouble. I removed Averaging, so it is no longer a user input. I made PipsAsWholeNumbers to be the norm, so it is no longer a user input. I removed Input for AppliedPrice, and just used the close. I separated all pairs so I could treat USDJPY separate. I have tested a little, and it's looking good. Less user inputs, but the way I see it, if it's not right, then it doesn't matter how many inputs it has. If I can make it right with less user inputs, I'll do it, and think I have done it successfully. Only testing will tell for sure. I have also attached a pic for those that are interested, so that anyone can tell the difference between Sentinal_index, Sentinel_Revised, and the new Sentinel_Revised_Don. If the lines didn't look SO off, maybe I wouldn't have noticed. For everybody's sake who uses it, I had to voice the problems I saw, and come up with a fix if I could. Seeing the difference between them on-screen (see the pic) should explain why I made a big deal out of the correctness of the indicator. The top indicator is Sentinal_index. The middle indicator is Sentinel_Revised. The bottom indicator is Sentinel_Revised_Don. Don

Kevin, As you've hopefully seen, this was not the problem. The problem mainly was that JPY's two decimal places was causing problems. I should have been able to take your indicator and just multiply by 10000 to get the correct whole number, and not use Point or anything. But that wasn't the case, so I followed the problem to where it lead, and found a fix by dividing ONLY USDJPY by 100 to make it four decimal places, then multiply all pairs by 10000. I would rather you update it and provide a working Sentinel_Revised that looks like Sentinal_index when put on the charts (because it looked corrrect). I have provided a simple 6pairs indicator that also proves the point visually and numerically. I don't want to argue right or wrong. That is not productive. Just looking to get it fixed by the original author, because it would be best if you did it, since you gave the NFP strategy and also the revised indicator that's not correct. I do thank you for posting the revised indicator, which does update the same on all pairs' charts, which Sentinel index didn't and doesn't do. If it wasn't for you posting the revised indicator, I couldn't have fixed the one issue, and we wouldn't even have an indicator that is reliable to be used for any strategy. So thank you again for posting the revised indicator. It would just be good if you, the original author, fixed it. Don

Hello everyone, I decided to make the indicator to have Averaged Gains by default (so set to True), and to not use Pips As Whole Numbers (so set to False), to be like the original Sentinal. The appearance is no different than when putting the first Sentinal on the chart, except this Sentinel_Revised2 updates properly because Kevin was kind enough to fix that. This works where Sentinel_Revised didn't because that indicator didn't take the difference in decimal places between JPY and others, so rendered the lines in the indicator incorrectly. This problem is fixed. So that indicator Sentinel_Revised2 is the latest, and trustworthy that I know of. I did make it so that if put on a non-USD based chart of one of the six pairs, it will be "upside down" from what it looks like on usd-based charts. This was done so that the signals from Kevin's original post in this thread could be implemented into an Expert Advisor (EA). So when this indicator is under the moving average on one of the six pairs charts, sell the pair. On another chart at the same time it may be over the moving average, so buy that pair. This is named Sentinel_Revised2, and goes into the experts' indicators folder. I have also added an indicator that is my attempt at helping automate the process of putting horizontal lines on the chart at beginning of NFP Friday and next Monday (Sunday 11:00PM Central). I also added shading to the non-trading area (red = no trades during NFP cooling period, orange = no trade zone after NFP cooing period). There is something wrong in the highest high and lowest low that it's trying to get to form the horizontal lines. The horizontal lines look correct for this time (so far), but I also added the lines for last NFP/last month, so we could have a reference and also to help me check my math. The horizontal lines that are supposed to be for the highest high and lowest low during NFP cooling off period, these lines are wrong. This can be clearly seen from seeing price action on the chart during last NFP and seeing that the red and orange rectangles (no trades zones) are nowhere near the actual highs and lows. If this gets fixed, then this strategy can be backtested in an EA. This file is called NFP_Sentinel_Don and goes into the experts' indicators folder. Speaking of EA, I also included an EA with the rules as best I can understand them for the buy and sell, although the closes need worked on. This goes into the experts folder. Remember folks, this is a work in progress. But a work that is totally worthwhile. How would you like to make hundreds of pips in an automated way? If so, and you can help fix the indicator that is named NFP_Sentinel_Don, then please do help, and we can get any last things changed in the EA we need to. Thank you everybody, especially Kevin. I hope you're doing good Kevin, and I hope I haven't offended you. It's not my intention. Don

OK. I posted the updated indicator, and another indicator, and an EA. The other indicator and EA are a work in progress. I see that NFP doesn't really affect us when using this indicator (Sentinel_Revised2), but it's still a good method to use the lines, etc. As I said before, it looked like the no-trade zone was working correctly for this month on NFP_Sentinel_Don indicator. Today, I watched as both EURUSD and GBPUSD both breached the NFP cooling off period's low. Both are headed down right now as expected after the breach. On a couple usd-based pairs, we see the Sentinel heading up, Sentinel is above 336 SMA, price of each of the pairs is above 336 SMA. USDJPY is moving up strong. USDCHF is moving down right now in the no-trade zone, but is going to go up along with the others (it's just taking it longer to "catch up"). Pics attached. We would be trading 3 of these 4 pairs right now with the money management in the EA, which maximizes potential. The only thing that needs fixed is the highest high and lowest low of the NFP cooling off period, and then I could finish the EA (unless someone else wanted to contribute). Don

Looking at the Sentinel_Revised2, if I want to see how many pips I could have made trading all six pairs (just using the Sentinel_Revised2 indicator, it's moving average and nothing else), I could make AverageGains to be False, and make PipsAsWholeNumbers to be True. I now look at on 2008.09.12 17:00, where the Sentinal above the moving average (on a non-usd-based pair). It crossed again 2008.09.29 01:00. If I subtract what Sentinel_Revised2 says at one crossing from the other crossing, it's a difference of 1815 (9227-7412=1815). So how about making 1815 pips in less than a few weeks? Then when it crossed that time, we would have gotten into a trade in the opposite direction. Between then and now, could have made another 3,648 pips in the last week trading six pairs (9227-5579=3648). So a total of 5,463 pips in less than a month (1815+3648=5463)! Now does THAT sound good to YOU!? Hope so. Please help fix the indicator, and we'll be able to automate it with great money management. Actually, these numbers are not using the rules by Kevin. Like I said, this is the gains we would have gotten just using Sentinel_Revised2. So do we want to even fix the indicator NFP_Sentinel_Don? Why not? It does help to know where in the month we are, if just for curiosity. Don

If anyone is interested I found the correct way in which they calculate the USDLFX. USDLFX = ((USDCHF * USDJPY * USDCAD) / (EURUSD * GBPUSD * AUDUSD))^(1/7) EURLFX = USDLFX * EURUSD GBPLFX = USDLFX * GBPUSD Now where is Kevin with that mixed basket of currency's candle chart script :-) Although I did find this script to mix 2 pairs but the volume does not seem to merge together. Dean.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Deanz, Could you fix the indicator 'NFP_Sentinel_Don' that I posted in post #330? The horizontal lines that are to be for the highest high and lowest low during the NFP "cooling off period" (Friday when NFP released until Sunday 11PM Central, I believe, according to post#1 instructions) are not correct. I did the best I could. If they were correct, the EA could be fixed/finished to automatically trade Kevin's system. I don't know what's happened to Kevin. Hope he's doing OK. I have just tried to move forward with the indicator/system since I found this thread, and do appreciate Kevin fixing the indicator to check that pairs histories are there, and setting the bars to use the lowest bar count of the individual pairs. After I fixed Kevin's revised indicator to take difference into account of JPY being only .01 for pip instead of .0001 for a pip, then the indicator (Sentinel_Revised2 in post #330) works good now and can be used in conjuntion with an EA (provided also in that post, but not finished). Don

Sorry Don my programing skills are only very basic. Maybe it is because you are using a Mac...... Have you tried asking in the Programming Discussion section: http://www.forexfactory.com/forumdisplay.php?f=69 When I first started using metatrader I had people make me an indicator and they only charge $30-50. Maybe that is the way to go ? Dean.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Mac has nothing to do with it No, I haven't asked in the programming session. I didn't think I should have to pay for something I'm not gonna use. As I've said before, I use the indicator, but don't use KEvin's system. But if fixed, then the already fixed indicator (Sentinel_Revised2), the yet-to-be-fixed indicator (NFP_Sentinel_Don), and EA (also in that post) would be Kevin's original idea from post #1 made into an automatic system, with two indicators I last posted and the EA (Sentinel_Revised2 is correct, but the other indicator and EA are not finished, and won't get finished unless someone decides to do it, because I don't have enough skill to do it). Didn't hurt to ask, since you are the only one besides Kevin and myself who has posted since I brought this thread back to life with my first post. Cheers, Don

--- 帖子 #339 ---
There was an indicator made (Sentinal_index). It did not keep updated correctly on the charts. After the thread died, I asked if that could be fixed. I doubt anyone would be successful in using the original indicator unless they manually switched timeframes back and forth to have to manually refresh the indicator. The fixed indiactor Kevin provided did update correctly (Sentinal_Revised), but the line on the indicator appearance was wrong. I fixed the problem and posted a new indicator (Sentinel_Revised2), as well as a couple in-progress stuff - an indicator to show NFP "colling down period" start and stop, highest high and lowest low. It would be put on each individual chart for all 6 pairs. The highest high and lowest low are not correct, and would have to be fixed to be reliable. The EA has the basic rules in buy and sell, but closebuy and closesell are not finished. As I've said before, unless someone can fix the NFP_Sentinel_Don indicator, then the only thing we can reliably use is the Sentinel_Revised2 indicator, and the system must be traded manually. Don

Hello Disbellj, I can try get this done for you, Please post the exact instructions you want done. Be as specific as possible. Also, include all indicators and other items in the one post you make. I know you have indicated that the items are in other posts but please put everything in one post. It will make it a lot easier. Regards, Jeff

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Jeff, That sounds great. I will explain as best I can. First, I read Kevin's post (post#1 in this thread). The Sentinel_Revised2 indicator is set up correctly and working correctly to this strategy. The indicator Sentinel_Revised2 assumes BuyingUSD. So inside the indicator, for usd-based pairs, the last close price for the pair/timeframe is subtracted from this close price (since we would expect these pairs to go up if USD is strengthening). For non-usd-based pairs, we subtract this close price from last close price (since we would expect these pairs to go down if USD is strengthening). Gains for each pair are added together to form a composite number - the Sentinel number. This is represented by the blue line in the Sentinel_Revised2 indicator. Originally, we "BuyUSD" when the line is going up, and "SellUSD" when the line is going down. BUT, because I wanted to make the indicator to be traded via an EA, I made the Sentinel switch direction (upside down) on non-usd-based pairs (so it looks the opposite on these pairs than it does on usd-based pairs). This is so that when the Sentinel is above 336 Simple Moving Average on Sentinel_Revised2 indicator, no matter what pair of the 6 pairs, you buy. When Sentinel is below 336 Simple Moving Average on Sentinel_Revised2 indicator, no matter what pair of the 6 pairs, you sell. This is the way it is set up to be used in the attached EA 'NFP_Sentinel_EA'. Now, Kevin (the originator of the thread) also gave additional requirements for the strategy that I had not done/used. It seems to me that Kevin (in post#1) mentioned also a 336 Simple Moving Average for each pair's chart also (so this is a 336 SMA on EACH pair's M30 chart, IN ADDITION TO the 336 SMA in the indicator window on EACH pair's chart). Also, Kevin referred to the NFP, and said that he waited after NFP was released on a Friday and waited until the following Monday 00:00, and named this period of time the NFP cooling off period. He then took the highest high and lowest low during that cooling off period, for each pair. This is what the indicator 'NFP_Sentinel_Don' was trying to automate. I was able to set the vertical lines correctly at the time NFP is released, to the next Monday at 00:00 (which I believe to be 11:00 PM Central time Sunday night). These lines are correct in that indicator. Then I tried to set horizontal lines to represent the highest high and lowest low during that time, to be automatically calculated and put the horizontal line on the chart automatically for each pair. I have not done this correctly, and it is NOT working. I then made the indicator draw a rectangle encompassing the start to end, lowest low to highest high, of the NFP cooling off period. You can refer to posts on this page (post#331, right after I posted the same indicators and EA I am posting again that I posted in post#330), to see screen shots I made and attached, to show this indicator on some pairs. See how the red rectangle is not correctly encompassing the highest high to lowest low on each pair? The red rectangle should encompass the highest high to lowest low of the NFP cooling off period. This is what needs corrected. If corrected to be able to calculate this correctly, then the red and orange rectangles should automatically be corrected. When/if that gets corrected, the EA should be able to be changed to completely follow the directions on post#1 (Kevin's original post describing the system), use the Sentinel_Revised2 indicator to see strength of USD (and includes a 336 SMA), use this in conjunction with 336 SMA on each pair, and also use the rules about not trading in the red zone (red rectangle = NFP cooling off period), and not trading after the cooling off period as long as the price is in the orange zone (orange rectangle = highest high to lowest low for the pair during NFP cooling off period, but a zone which should not be traded even during the rest of the month). My understanding of Kevin's system is: If, for example, USDJPY's price goes below 336 SMA, the Sentinel in the Sentinel_Revised2 indicator is on a USD-based pair, so if the Sentinel line in the indicator is also below 336 SMA in the indicator, AND if price is also NOT in the red or orange zone, THEN Sell USDJPY. For a non-usd-based pair, here's the same example when selling USD (usd is going down): If EURUSD's price is above the 336 SMA, the Sentinel in the Sentinel_Revised2 indicator is on a non-USD-based pair, so if the Sentinel line in the indicator is above 336 SMA in the indicator, AND if price is also NOT in the red or orange zone, THEN Buy EURUSD. Now (my method): I have just used the Sentinel_Revised2 to trade, and Buy USD (simultaneously Sell EURUSD, GBPUSD, and AUDUSD, while Buy USDCHF, USDCAD, and USDJPY) or Sell USD (simultaneously Buy EURUSD, GBPUSD, and AUDUSD, while Sell USDCHF, USDCAD, and USDJPY) based on this indicator and the internal 336 SMA alone. So I buy or sell all at the same time, where Kevin's method would buy or sell based on multiple criteria. My method can be tested by simply using the attached EA and only keeping/using references to Sentinel_Revised2 (Sentinel &gt; 336 SMA = Buy/CloseSell pair, Sentinel &lt; 336 SMA = Sell/CloseBuy pair) However, I believe that if Kevin's system's additional requirements were added (NFP cooling off period highest high and lowest low, so we don't trade in that range during the remainder of the month) and 336 SMA on each chart, plus stop losses he recommends, these MAY keep us out of ranging areas better in the long run. Also, since my emotions seem to get the better of me when trading, I'd like to finish this and put it into an EA (why I've worked towards that goal). Then we can backtest and compare my method with Kevin's method, and use the best one. Both are profitable for sure. You can see almost 5,500 pips gained last month (actually could have been more if trading from previous month and not having to wait until next cross that happened after the 1st of the month), and this using just the one Sentinel_Revised2 indicator on M30 chart with 336 SMA. However, as I've said before, Kevin's strategy could be more profitable in the long run if it keeps us out of ranging areas when they are encountered. I just know I made 2,000 pips in less than a couple weeks at beginning of August, before I ever found this thread, with an indicator I made that didn't update correctly. Now that we have an updated indicator that can be trusted, I can move to lower timeframes than when I made that 2,000 pips. If Kevin's strategy is better, then all the better. If it can be automated, and take my emotions out of the equation, I'll be one very happy man. Thank you much, Don

This is the best I could do at fixing the indicator and EA. I'm using this on FXDD. If someone knows how to correctly build and optimize the code, it would be much welcome. However, the indicators and EA may be able to be used in an automated way right now, but certainly can be used in a manual way to test Kevin's strategy. All lines are drawn automatically per Kevin's first post (by using the two attached indicators), as I understand his directions: Vertical line is created when NFP is released, which is 7:30 AM Central Time (8:30 Eastern Time), the first Friday of the month. Vertical line is created at the end of the NFP "cooling off" period, which I understand to be 11PM Sunday night Central Time (Monday midnight Eastern time). Simple moving average of 336 (7-day) is placed on each pair's chart, and also on the Sentinel indicator in separate window. Sentinel is created by adding the gains from buying (if usd-based pair) or selling (if non-usd-based pair) each pair that is traded (marked by putting 1.0 in user inputs, beside each pair's counter-currency to USD) When M30 bar closes above 336 SMA, and Sentinel crosses above 7-day moving average (also 336 SMA), then both agree. When both agree and are above the highest high of the NFP cooling-off period, then buy the pair. 100 pip stop loss. Close the buy when the M30 bar close is below the 336 SMA (or if it goes back and closes in the no-trade zone). Only open another buy if M30 bar closes above two-week high, in addition to the other buy conditions listed above. When M30 bar closes below 336 SMA, and Sentinel crosses below 7-day moving average (also 336 SMA), then both agree. When both agree and are below the lowest low of the NFP cooling-off period, then sell the pair. 100 pip stop loss. Close the sell when the M30 bar close is above the 336 SMA (or if it goes back and closes in the no-trade zone). Only open another sell if M30 bar closes below two-week low, in addition to the other sell conditions listed above. As I see the indicator on my chart right now, December 28th, I see that this month, thousands of pips could have been made trading six or seven pairs (not sure if that includes last two weeks rule or not, but just zooming all the way out and looking at the crossing of the price and sentinel with the 336 SMAs). I'm having trouble backtesting because the NFP indicator's code needs optimized (to use arrays which I'm still trying to get, but does not keep me from being able to code the indicator's to be used in manual trading), which I'm having trouble with, because I'm still learning, and do not come from a programming/coding background. Hopefully Kevin or another programmer will be able to optimize the NFP indicator's code so that fast backtesting can be made possible with the EA. At this time, backtest removes this indicator from the chart multiple times a second, so I do know the code needs to be optimized/fixed. I thank anyone giving help to finish this automated business that can be used by all that read this thread. Don

asian_sg_guy, no way to profit from indicators? try telling that to someone who has not profited from indicators. I will look at your comment as either ignorant, or an attempt to stop progress on this profitable system. Either one is negative and not true when it comes to this strategy. I've made over 2000 pips in a couple weeks time using an indicator similar to sentinal index indicator, before I came to this thread, so if you have nothing constructive to add, just please don't comment at all, since it is not productive.

Hi guys! The Kevin_E didn't update the first post. Pls share or send by PM last versions of indicators and template for system! Thanks! Using Index its really nice

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Look back a page or two and you will see the latest indicators. Kevin did post a Sentinel_Revised indicator, and has not fixed his version to be correct. It does not look like Sentinal_index indicator from the past when put on chart. Sentinal_index indicator looked correct when first placed on chart, but did not update correctly (it didn't look the same on multiple currency pair charts of same timeframe after being on the charts for a period of time). Sentinel_Revised is what Kevin made that did update correctly on the charts (same numbers and line appearance on all pairs' charts of the same timeframe, even as the indicator updates over time), but the JPY pair having two decimals instead of four decimals wasn't taken into account, so the line's appearance on charts were wrong even though consistent. So I fixed Sentinel_Revised to be correct (succeeded after multiple tries), and have tried moving forward with my understanding of the strategy. I have asked Kevin to post back, but he hasn't. I have asked if he knows how to code, that it would be best for him to code the indicators and EA. He has not responded. So I have no choice but to do what I can, so that I can get to a point of backtesting the variations that can be used, to see which variation is best. For instance, which is more profitable: Using the rules as they were laid out, or not using all the rules, but just some of the rules. Or maybe just using the lastest Sentinel indicator I posted without all the rules. No one can say which is the best strategy until the EA can be backtested. There is no question in my mind that the strategy is profitable as Kevin gave it. The only question is: Who cares anymore? I do. Does Kevin? Does anybody else? Anyone that can help? Don

Hi disbellj, Thanks for all the hard work. Could I ask what you mean by 336 SMA (also 7 day SMA)? Does that mean you have 2 MA lines? Do you set the SMA lines to the closing price or? I am testing this system. Let me know what needs to be fixed. I wrote an EA according to Rob Booker's idea and automated it but the profits were not consistent. I tried tweaking with my own ideas but it is still crappy - losing too much and missing a lot of nice trends. Happy 2009!

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Could someone please explain to me about these files and what they do: I understand that the NFP_Sentinel_EA_Revised.mq4 is the EA. PHP Code extern bool ShowLastMonth = false ; extern double MonthOffset = 0 ; extern string OA = "Override Automatic NFP Start/End Dates" ; extern bool OA . Override_AutoDates = false ; extern string OA . NFP_Start = "Default: 8:30AM EST 1st Friday of the month, when NFP released" ; extern datetime OA . NFP_StartTime = D '2008.12.05 15:30:00' ; //8:30 AM EST 1st Friday of the month, when NFP released extern string OA . NFP_End = "Default: 00:00 EST Monday Midnight (11:00 PM Sunday Central time)" ; extern datetime OA . NFP_EndTime = D '2008.12.08 07:00:00' ; //00:00 EST Monday (Midnight? which would be 11:00 PM Sunday Central time?) extern datetime OA . NFP_LastStartTime = D '2008.11.07 15:30:00' ; //8:30 AM EST 1st Friday of the month, when NFP released extern datetime OA . NFP_LastEndTime = D '2008.11.10 07:00:00' ; //00:00 EST Monday (Midnight? which would be 11:00 PM Sunday Central time?) I assume that the EA can draw the lines properly without manual input like the code above as long as OA.Override_AutoDates = false? I can see that your code does not use any functions. It would be so much neater if you did. I have an EA that draws the lines of high and low of the NFP Friday. I used a daily chart on my EA. I only start trading on the Monday after NFP Friday. Looking at your screen shots, I see you have implemented something similar. What is TradeCount = 0 for? I do not see any code that adds to this counter. It seems to stay zero forever unless I am wrong. Is there code to increase this once an order has been made? It would be very helpful if you explain your code. Some parts can be understood pretty easily but not other parts. It also depends on the programmer looking at your code. What are these for? extern bool AverageGains = False; extern bool PipsAsWholeNumbers = True; extern double EUR = 1.0, // weights JPY = 1.0, GBP = 1.0, CHF = 1.0, CAD = 1.0, AUD = 1.0, NZD = 1.0;

ForexNewDude, Yes, there is a 336 SMA on each pair's chart, and ALSO a 7-day SMA on the Sentinel indicator in a separate indicator window. When figuring out what "7-day" SMA means on a M30 chart, we know there are 24 hours in a day, so there are 48 half-hours in a day. 48 x 7 days = 336. So both SMAs are 336. I am automatically setting the start times in the NFP indicator, but not doing it with arrays because I don't know how to. I then used iBarShift and don't think it's using the correct bars (off by one?). I have combined the NFP indicator with the EA (not posted), and see that the objects are not updating correctly (probably because not arrays) when backtesting. Kevin's money management needs added instead of mine (or in addition to mine, so the user can choose which to use). I've noticed that the W1 highest highs and lowest lows for the NFP "cooling off period" are sometimes very different than the M30 highest highs and lowest lows for the same pair for the same "cooling off period" (I've seen like 145 pip difference for this last week between HH for EURUSD M30 vs W1 chart). There are a lot of nice trends it does not catch, but plenty it keeps us out of too. Is it more or less profitable than just using Sentinel indicator alone without the extra rules? I don't know. I know both are very profitable lately. I wouldn't have even come to this thread except a friend TRO told me about this thread and said it was very close to what I had already made 2000 pips in a couple weeks doing. This just adds more rules, but may help protect us better. I think money management is going to be as important as anything else. I like the idea of Kevin's for removing half the position at 50 pips gain. I also like the idea in the T101 thread about using an AccountProtect EA (or implement it with ours), so to close all trades once a percentage has been lost from maximum equity high, or locking in profits every 50 pips (so like a 50 pip trailing stop for the whole basket, maybe, if we didn't use anything but the Sentinel indicator alone?) Many possibilities. T101 has a record of 16,000 pips in one week with his strategy, and like he says, locking the profit in is what makes it as successful as it is (plus he's trading 14 pairs on each account, and trading two accounts, all simultaneously, and I would too if I could get the entry and exit rules down for his system). Don

Don This looks bloody impressive, suits trading really well and the direction can pretty much allow you to constantly re enter on support and resistance with tight stops. Well done.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
I do not see any option to add 7-day SMA on the sentinel indicator. Mine only has 1 line. Your screen shots have more than 1 line. Is mine normal? My current EA uses daily charts to calculate the high and low of the NFP friday. I draw a horizontal line at the high of the NFP and low of the NFP. I also draw a vertical line on Monday after the NFP. However, I don't know how you coloured the areas red and orange. That looks good. Please point me to the code where you did this. This depends. We need to back test to find out more. I already have trailing stop and a bit of kevin's 50 pip gain features in my EA. Your money management code is good for automating the lot size to put in. Could you show me the T101 thread? That seems interesting too. I think he uses a 100 pip trailing stop. ================ At the moment, I need to know the exact rules of this system to code it... 1. Buy signal 2. Sell signal 3. Exit buy 4. Exit sell I also need to know which files are the latest and what indicators I should use. I still cannot figure out how to get the indicator to display like your screen shot.

ForexNewDude, Good questions. Yes, Automatic overrides, if set to true, will use the dates manually input. If set to false (default), will automatically set start and end dates for NFP "cooling off period" as explained by Kevin (although I don't know how to set the time for every user, I set it hardwired in the code to conform to FXDD server time (day starts at 4PM Central time) and my local time (Central time), so this means NFP Start time is 15:30 (4PM to midnight Central time is 8 hours, plus 7:30 Central time when NFP is released is another 7 1/2 hours, so total of 15 1/2 hours), and NFP End time is 7:00 (12 PM Monday midnight is really 11 PM Central time Sunday, and 11 minus 4 (which is day open for Forex, Central time) is 7). You are right, I don't know how to code and that is why a programmer could do such a better job than me, but I do have something that can at least be used manually and can be used by a programmer (something they can fix, but have info in the files to go by). TradeCount starts at 0 (no trades have been done). I may have not entered the rest of the code at that time (I have done so in a more recent version that I haven't posted). Once a trade on a pair is taken, right after the ticket for buy or sell is sent, then TradeCount is set to TradeCount+1. This is because there are different rules (additional rules) for a re-entry than there are for the original entry. If TradeCount is above 1, these additional rules/conditions are also used before a trade is placed. AverageGains is an input I put there because Kevin was averaging the gains to make the Sentinel number, while my method is to see total pips gained by all 6 pairs (since I'm going to trade all 6 pairs at once). So if true, then the resulting Sentinel number is all gains divided by number of pairs being used/traded. If false (default), the resulting Sentinel number is all gains (not divided by number of pairs being used/traded). PipsAsWholeNumbers is an input I put there because Kevin's original Sentinal_index showed the pips using decimals, while I like looking at pips as whole numbers and not paying attention to the decimals if I can. So if false, Sentinel will be displayed as decimals (4). If true, Sentinel will be displayed as whole numbers. These whole numbers are the total gain or loss one would have if they started trading at the first bar the Sentinel is formed up to the present time, if buying the 3 USD-based pairs (usdchf,usdcad,usdjpy), and selling the 3 non-USD-based pairs (eurusd,gbpusd,audusd) and having them as one long trade. The up and down oscillation of the Sentinel shows when the account would be gaining or losing money by buying USD. If we would be losing money, we would want to sell USD and not be buying it. The additional rules Kevin has given in his strategy may keep us out of trouble, or may keep us from making as much. Only getting it built right for backtesting will tell us. I really like using visual mode when I backtest in MT4 to show what's going on during the times I'm testing The EUR,GBP,etc. and the 1.0 beside them are basically saying that the pairs are being traded and their gains/loses taken into account when forming the Sentinel. If they are not going to be traded, set them to 0. That way, the Sentinel is only applicable to the pairs you are wanting to trade (where all other USD "indexes" use non-sensical equations and pairs you may not want to trade, but are there giving "weight" anyway) Like I said, very good questions. I thank you for your interest and input. Happy New Year! Don

dfxclub, The system is bloody impressive. Putting it on the chart just shows it. It's hard to imagine that this thread went on as long as it did before I got here without someone making the indicators to make it easy. Kevin said an EA had been made but never have it in the thread. I knew Sentinel alone was profitable by itself (at least my version before I came here was real profitable, but I also keep an eye out for improving where I can also. I think the indicator is impressive given that I'm not a programmer. Thank you for the kind remarks. I do see when I'm zoomed all the way out on M30 that the trends appear to me easier, and with the added lines, the trends become even clearer. Don

The lines on the latest indicators are: Main chart window: Vertical line for NFP Start (First Friday of month at 7:30 Central time) Vertical line for NFP End (end of cooling off period, Sunday 11PM Central time) Horizontal line for the highest high between NFP Start and NFP End. Horizontal line for the lowest low between NFP Start and NFP End. Red rectangle to mark the no-trade zone during NFP cooling off period. Orange rectangle to mark this same no-trade zone during the rest of the month. 336 period SMA (simple moving average) (Don't know if these are added on the latest posted indicators, but they should be there): Vertical line for current week start Horizontal line for current week high Horizontal line for current week low Rectangle to encompass current week start to now, high to low Vertical line for previous week start Vertical line for previous week end Horizontal line for previous week high Horizontal line for previous week low Rectangle to encompass previous week start to end, high to low Seperate Sentinel indicator window: Sentinel (aka BuyUSD Profit) line 336 period SMA (7-day simple moving average, as well as inputs for user to use up to 2 more moving averages) If you look in the indicator 'NFP_Sentinel_Don_Revised', at the top I first make the moving average, then below that, I define Start time for NFP. When I get done with that, you'll see //---- (to separate pieces of code), then you'll see my calculations for the NFP End time. More //--- Then you'll see code for Highest High and Lowest Low calculations, then basically repeat that for current and previous week high and low. My iBarShift is off by one bar, and doesn't show in backtesting, so I do know it needs rebuilt, but I'm learning. It's all based on time and price. When a certain type is needed, return that type. For instance, in iBarShift, when it says that the type that's returned needs to be datetime, then give it datetime if you want it to work. Returning int type will not work. I'm learning how to return the type that's asked for in different circumstances, and learning to convert one type to another if need-be. But time-based stuff I'm still struggling with, learning some, everything I do learn is really cool! BTW, here's the code to create the red rectangle: ObjectCreate("NoTradeZone", 16, 0, StartTime, HighestHigh, EndTime, LowestLow ); Using the help inside MetaEditor has taught me a lot, but I still have a long ways to go if I'm going to really learn MQL4. I've just tonight typed on this thread the buy signals and sell signals, exit signals, and re-entry signals. Look at this thread on the last couple pages. The last indicators I posted at the bottom of the message are the latest posted. Kevin has not responded recently, so it doesn't look like the first post will be getting updated. We might want to move this to another thread, I dunno.

However, although I want to learn that system, I think what we have here MAY be applicable to that system as well. Any input to put this together and see where it takes us is much appreciated. As far as your screen shot not matching mine, the highest highs and lowest lows were messed up on the old indicator that I took those screen shots with, so please download the latest indicator posted. Also, you would probably have to even look inside the new NFP indicator to hard-code the NFP Start time and End time (unless you happen to use FXDD MT4 and are in the Central time zone), for the objects on-chart to be correct.

In addition to how I said that the trade should increase with every buy or sell order (so add a line after ticket made, TradeCount = TradeCount+1), TradeCount can be set to 1 manually in inputs, so that if the user starts sometime in the middle of the month instead of right after NFP cooling off period, then they can tell the EA that it's already had a trade on the pair, so that the extra conditions of price above highest high/below lowest low, for previous and current week, are also taken into consideration, before the trade is taken. Very nifty way of psyching out the EA to not just using the "1st trade after NFP cooling off period" rules (since entering in the middle of the month may make someone nervous, using the extra conditions are a great way to limit losing trades). Don [quote=ForexNewDude;2444941] What is TradeCount = 0 for? I do not see any code that adds to this counter. It seems to stay zero forever unless I am wrong. Is there code to increase this once an order has been made?

Place these indicators on your 6 charts: EURUSD, GBPUSD, AUDUSD, USDCHF, USDCAD, USDJPY I have been told that NFP was not released Friday, so the user will have to put in the time manually. How I figured when NFP is (normally) released my time: NFP Start day is: one day in the range of first 7 days of the month day of week is Friday *IMPORTANT* NFP Start Time is 15:30 Central Time Note: I calculated this by knowing that FXDD's Server time goes to 00:00 at 4PM Central time my time. From this point, there are 8 hours until midnight Central time, then the next morning NFP is released at 7:30 AM Friday Central time. So add 8 + 7:30, and you have 15:30 How I figured when NFP cooling off period is over (normally): int OneSecond = 1; int OneMinute = 60*OneSecond; int OneHour = 60*OneMinute; int OneDay = 24*OneHour; int NFP_EndTime = NFP_StartTime + From NFP release until 4PM Central time + Saturday and Sunday + From 4PM CST Sunday to 11PM CST Sunday/00:00 Midnight EST Monday So, NFP_EndTime = NFP_StartTime + ((8*OneHour)+(30*OneMinute)) + (2*OneDay) + (7*OneHour) Once you know how your time is compared to server time, you should also be able to calculate your correct time. Note: For those that don't know, it's interesting to note that Monday Forex time starts on Sunday afternoon 4PM Central time, so when looking at days and you are in Central time zone: Before 4PM Central, then the current Forex day is the same as the today's date/day you see on your calendar. After 4PM Central, then the current Forex day is the same as tommorrow's date/day you see on your calendar. This is all I can comment on using and changing the time inside the indicator. For someone that knows how to fix the indicator so that the indicator uses server time and local time to figure when NFP is going to be released, so that the time can be done automatically, then that would be great. The way MT4 counts the start time's bar and end time's bar for NFP, previous and current week showed me that these needed fixed so that the correct bars would be chosen for us to manually trade now, and hopefully/eventually autotrade. Note: There is no EA built to work with these indicators. If someone can optimize the code further than I have, that would be great. I have put comments as much as I can into this latest NFP indicator, so please look at the code if you have questions. I have thought about using an approach to move the start and end bars for NFP by a certain number of days (user input) to the left or right, so that the user wouldn't have to override the dates by putting in actual dates, but override the dates by shifting days. If someone knows how to get the date and time for NFP release into MT4, so that the user wouldn't have to do this, that would be great. note:the indicators in this post have been removed because of problems found Happy New Year Don

Don, I dunno what d drama was, how ever this morning those indicators werent looking that bad.

I stayed up for like 18 hours Saturday from morning until after midnight the next night, to try and get the NFP indicator fixed. Since the market wasn't opened yet, I couldn't test the new NFP indicator. Once the market did open, I saw that I had done something wrong be because of the way NFP end was not updating correctly. I wanted the red box to begin drawing at the start of NFP cooling-off period, but not to draw the red line marking the NFP cooling-off period end until the actual end of the NFP cooling off period (bar whose closing time is at the end of NFP cooling-off period), then draw the green line when it's OK to start looking for a trade. The end red rule and the green line are being drawn too soon, and somehow the orange line is affected too. Should be an easy fix, which I already have ideas about how i will fix the problem(s). Don

Thank you Wartercooloer. I'll take a look when I get a chance. The files only being .ex4 doesn't allow me to learn anything about how to make my code more efficient.

Looking at the chart with the latest indicator, (which I have since removed since there was believed to be a glitch, which there may have not been a glitch in the latest indicator, since I had an old indicator on the chart, duh), it looks like if NFP was released Friday, and the NFP cooling-of period end was at the regular time (Sunday 11PM Central): Would have sold two positions of EURUSD at FXDD server time 2009.01.05 10:30 for 1.3712, bought back one of the positions at 50 pips profit 1.3662, and the rest would be in profit at current price 1.3589, for a gain of 123 pips on the 2nd position (or remaining half of original position, however you'd rather look at it). Would not made any trades for GBPUSD since all conditions weren't met. Would not made any trades for AUDUSD since all conditions weren't met. Would have bought two positions of USDCHF at FXDD server time 2009.01.05 10:30 for 1.0928, sold one of the positions at 50 pips profit 1.0978, and the rest would be in profit at current price 1.1059, for a gain of 127 pips on the 2nd position (or remaining half of original position, however you'd rather look at it). Would have bought two positions of USDJPY at FXDD server time 2009.01.05 10:30 for 92.69, sold one of the positions at 50 pips profit 93.19, and the rest would be in profit at current price 93.19, for a gain of 50 pips on the 2nd position (or remaining half of original position, however you'd rather look at it). At this time, Monday 01-05-09 11AM Central Time, 19:00 FXDD server time, if NFP was released on Friday, and we took trades as scheduled, would be 450 pips in profit, and still have half positions in those trades going, to make more profit. Not bad for the trades being half of a day old (12 hours to be exact), huh? I would consider putting in money management (if an EA were written, my money management to pick number of lots, and then to lock 50 pips profit on the second position at 100 pips, lock 100 pips profit when profit at 150 pips, lock 150 pips profit when profit at 200 pips, etc., so that we would never lose more than 50 pips of profit from the high peak of profit) Just wanted to let people see that quick profit can be possible, and to also ask, how can I find out when NFP is released? and does anybody know a way that NFP release can be programmed? Then the cooling-off period would shift with the NFP release time, the way it is coded. Don

I am programming the NFP date thing. I do not see a need to enter the dates. It should either the first week or the second week. I simply added a external variable that sets true or false for 1st week. If it falls on the first week, do this. If not, do that. I think it would be very hard to get a user to enter the dates in that format.. Too much room for errors. True and false is easier. Email me. I can send you the EA I created. It is just without the entry and exit code. Mine runs on daily charts.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Let's put a scenario together using my money management to pick number of lots to trade for each pair, coupled with Kevin's technique of taking off half the position at 50 pips take profit for the first half of position, while putting the remaining half of position at stop loss of break-even: I have determined that I can't risk more than 8% per pair trading six pairs with 100 pips stop loss each, or I will get a margin call. But Kevin said (my understanding at least) to trade 2 trades for each pair, with 100 pips stop loss on each. If I put 200 pips stop loss into my OpenOffice calculator for each pair, I can risk 10% per pair. At $1,000 initial deposit, 10% risk per pair, with a stop loss of 200 pips for each pair, and tick value of $10 per pair, my money management chooses the following number of lots for each pair: =(Account Balance x (RiskPercentPerPair/100)/(StopLoss x TickValue) =(1000 x (10/100))/(200 x 10) (Note: tick value will change and not always be $10, so number of lots will change, as seen below in USD-based pairs) =(1000 x 0.1)/2000 =100/2000 =0.05 standard lots, or 5 micro lots each pair, to begin trade. EURUSD 50 pips take profit x $0.30 per pair (three micro lots = half of position) = $15 EURUSD 123 pips profit x $0.20 per pair (two micro lots = other half of position) = $24.60 USDCHF 50 pips take profit x $0.27 per pair (three micro lots = half of position) = $13.50 USDCHF 127 pips profit x $0.18 per pair (two micro lots = other half of position)= $22.86 USDJPY 50 pips take profit x $0.21 per pair (two micro lots = half of position) = $10.50 USDJPY 50 pips profit x $0.21 per pair (two micro lots = other half of position)= $10.50 Add all these together = $96.96 gained on a $1000 account. Percentage gained: 9.69% - in 12 hours. Now because my money management is set up the way it is, you'd get 9.69% gain on your account (given these trades) no matter what size the account. So if the account was $100,000, you'd still risk the same percent and still gain the same percent from these trades (of course, if you had $100,000 account size, that 9.69% gain in 12 hours would amount to around $9,690). And remember, we would've only traded three of the six pairs so far. Don

ForexNewDude, So you're saying that NFP is always released on a Friday at the same time, and if it's not the first week, it's the second? Cool. Yeah, a true/false input to just forward to the second week would be great and easy on the user. The time to use still is going to be trouble for some I know, because it is hard-wired into the code, and not a user input, and some people don't want to dig in code. However, I don't know how to fix this (yet) without someone having to go into the code to choose the correct hour, since one has to think about their broker's server time, their local time, and maybe even Eastern time that NFP is released, and calculate by themselves to figure out the hour and minute in their broker's MT4 that the lines SHOULD be, and fix the code - geared to their particular broker and local time. Don

--- 帖子 #371 ---
I have revised the new indicators, and I've implemented ForexNewDude's recommendation to have user input of 'Shift_NFPStart_OneWeek'. When set to true, it NFP_Start (start of NFP cooling off-period) and NFP_End (end of NFP cooling-off period) will be pushed forward one week exactly. This month, the user will want to set this to True, since NFP is being released the 2nd Friday this month. Also, there is an input 'Shift_LastNFPStart_OneWeek', that when set to true, will shift last month's NFP_Start and NFP_End forward one week. Next month, the user will want to set this to True, since next month, when looking back at the graphics for this month, they will not be correct unless this is set to True. I've also added my money management. If 'ShowComments' is True, then all sorts of relevant information is shown on-chart, including my money management discussed in previous posts. Also, Server time and Local time are displayed. I've added TradeCount to this indicator, and I've added Alerts, but since I'm getting way too many Alerts (and therefore incorrect TradeCount), I've set Alerts to False - to not use alerts. But the conditions that are put into this portion of the indicator are the signals for buy, buy again, sell, sell again. ForexNewDude, this area may help you when working on your EA buy and sell conditions. Indicator still could be improved, but since I don't know how to at this time, I'll leave it to someone else if they can fix the code to be shorter and neater (using functions, arrays, etc.) Don

I think you done well Don. Personally Im really interested in the way this system is working. I have one minor request if I may... Are the rules still the same? Or better still in a few bullet pionts can you jot them down for the sake of everyone. I read the trades you had and I was watching them too but AUDUSD was a trade according to what I saw. I use ODL. It would be really helpful to summarise the rules in points, for me thats the case any way. thanks for all the hard work.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
dfxclub, Sure, I'll post them again. First, you must know what your broker's server time is when it's the first Friday of the month, at 8:30 AM Eastern time. I have Central time, so NFP is released at my time of 7:30 AM CST. I know my broker starts Friday at my time Thursday 4:00 PM CST. So on my charts, I'm looking for Friday's date, but the hour I need to look for "NFP Start" (where the vertical line should be drawn) is: 4PM-12AM (8 hours) + 12AM-7:30AM (7 hours 30 minutes) ... and 8 + 7:30 = 15:30... ...so I'm looking on my MT4 platform for Friday's date, at hour 15:30. So now I know when the NFP cooling-off period starts. NFP cooling-off period ends at Midnight Monday EST/11PM Sunday CST. The times in my NFP indicator are based on my CST and my broker's (FXDD) Server time combination, so will use wrong Start time if not on CST (Central Standard time) or on a broker who has a different time than FXDD's MT4 does. It would be good if this wasn't the case, and the indicator looked at server time and local time, and made decisions automatically based on these, but I coded what I could. The Sentinel indicator (I would recommend the latest one, which doesn't use NZD), tracks the pips gained from buying USDCHF,USDCAD, and USDJPY (the usd-based pairs), and selling EURUSD,GBPUSD, and AUDUSD (the non-usd-based pairs). This indicator shows "upside down" when placed on EURUSD,GBPUSD, and AUDUSD charts, and is intended to do so, so that an EA (if built) or if manually traded, it makes the user not have to think about direction of Sentinel on non-usd-based chart. When Sentinel indicator is placed on chart, it shows in a separate indicator window below the main chart window. Rules for 1st buy (use M30 chart to go by the rules): 1. Time to start trading (or looking for trades) is after NFP cooling-off period ends (main chart). 2. Price must close above highest high of NFP cooling-off period (main chart). 3. Price must close above 336 SMA (main chart). 4. Sentinel must be above Sentinel moving average of 336 SMA (explained by Kevin to be 7-day moving average). (Note: This is in the separate indicator window. See Sentinel_indi_Don indicator, or Sentinel 3 indicator if you want to use/trade NZD (and if trading NZD, you'll want to use it when calculating the Sentinel also) If all conditions are met above in 1-4, place an order for that pair. Risk 10% of the account when choosing number of lots to trade. When the price hits 50 pips above where you bought, remove half the number of lots you're trading on the pair. Move the stop loss on the remaining half position to where you bought at (which is 50 pips below where you are now). The 2nd half of the position is closed when price closes below the 336 SMA on main chart. So if the price goes at least 50 pips, you've made money and won't lose any money on the trade. If it doesn't get to 50 pips above where you bought, and you use Kevin's recommendation of 100 pips stop loss for both halves of the position, you end up losing 200 pips on this pair. So before you ever put on a trade on a pair, account for 200 pips stop loss on that pair, and it will give you correct amount of lots (my money management equation) to trade. So you see (this is the short explanation): 1st Buy, Condition 1: Price closes ABOVE NFP cooling-off period's highest high 1st Buy, Condition 2: Price closes ABOVE 336 SMA 1st Buy, Condition 3: Sentinel is ABOVE 336 SMA in indicator window. Exit if price closes BELOW 336 SMA on main chart. After the 1st Buy, any Buys after that must also include: Buy Condition 4: Price closes ABOVE current week's highest high. Buy Condition 5: Price closes ABOVE previous week's highest high. The rules for sell on a pair are the exact opposite - switch ABOVE with BELOW, and BELOW with ABOVE in the above statements. If you tackle the time stuff first mentioned, understand the Sentinel I've explained above, and understand the way Kevin take's profit, then the system's rules are all in these last paragraphs. The following is assuming the NFP was released the first week of the month, which it wasn't, so this is just for purpose of discussion for understanding: On my AUDUSD chart, I show that WHEN the price closed above the NFP cooling-off period's highest high (2009.01.05 23:00 on FXDD MT4), the Sentinel was below the Sentinel_MA on that chart's indicator window, so no trade would be taken. Sentinel kept us out of a losing trade. Again, NFP is being released the second Friday this month, so no trades would be taken yet for January 2009, and this little discussion is only for learning (scenario if NFP would have been released the first week). Don

Thanks alot Don Much appreciated

You're welcome. I'm looking at Kevin's NFP.txt from the first post, and the posts in between, and I still don't understand how he got number of lots with the math he provided. Does anybody else have a clue? I just know if someone were to trade 2 "lots" (trades) per pair (look at them as two trades, with each one having a 100 pips stop loss), then at most, I could only risk 4% per trade, trading six pairs, with 2 trades each pair, all at once, and any more than that and I could get a margin call (and even at that, that's 4 x 12 = the percentage of the account at "risk" - although I wouldn't really expect to lose all the trades if going by the rules, so this risk is just for money management and worse-case scenario, which money management should be looking at when choosing amount of lots to trade IMO). Don

Hi Kev, could you please sent me an examplea few chart of your system, about NFP rule i want to try for backtest to firm my trade,

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Hi all, anybody still interested in this method ? I went through all the posts and adapted / modified the NFP/sentinel indicators and EA to Tradestation/Multicharts (without MM yet) because the backtesting capabilities of MT seem to be awful. I backtested all currency pairs for the last 7 years: The adapted strategy works very well and consistently for GBP/USD only. All other currency pairs did not work at all. Maybe this is due to its focus on GBP/USD while it was developed. Can anybody confirm this ? If anybody is interested in this, let me know.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Hi Pippiee, Very interesting! Could you please post some of your charts from backtesting, and give some information on parameter values used? It is very difficult to give a general answer without any specific information on patterns. It is possible that you benefit for the GBPUSD because you benefit from information from the huge volume of EURUSD and USDJPY for predicting trends in USD, while some fringe crosses of the USD may be affected more by other factors than trends in USD. This would leave the GBPUSD as a reasonable choice with a fair amount of volume but not absolute top. It could be that trends in the GBP are related but somewhat lag behind both USD and EUR. But you could also say that the system has serious limitations, and sooner or later these limitations wil become apparent for all pairs. It may just be a matter of chance why the GBPUSD has lasted positive so long. In other words, you may have been out for a statistical fishing expedition (when you look hard enough for something you will eventually find it but may be a fluke with no predictive value). Without seeing more information on how the equiry curves of different pairs look like, and how consistent some of the equity growth is, this is all mute speculation. Would be great to see some charts of yor work!

Hi Bubo, i have attached EUR/USD, GBP/USD and USD/CHF. Parameters: - fixed trade size = 0.1 lot - pessimistic comission (i dont have a spread in multicharts) of 4 pips per transaction (so this equals to a 8 pips spread/slippage per roundtrip) - signal/ea parameters are the original ones (50 Profit Target, 100 SL) The starting equity of 100.000 is of course way to high for a trade size of 0.1 lot. Lets assume a starting equity of 10.000, the maximum DD is 1.500, which is 15 %. Net profit is 8.000 which is not much in respect to the 7 year trading period, but remember, I always traded 0.1 lot. I am curious to see how it will look like after implementing MM code.

Here is the GBP/USD one with 6pct risk of equity MM. Maximum DD is 30 %. Starting equity 10.000. End equity after 7 years is 80.000 which equals to a yearly compounding rate of little over 30 %. If I reduce the spread to 4 instead of 8, the ending equity is 130.000.

I think I am going to add MM based on volatility, as the movements gets erratic as of mid 2008

Ever just used the Sentinel indi? That's why I came to this thread in the first place. It used an idea that I had, but my indicator didn't update correctly. Kevin made a version that does update correctly. So even if not used for this strategy, that indicator is a custom USD index (since you only trade the pairs that have 1.0 in inputs, and if you make a pair 0 in inputs, it's gains are not being tracked, so don't trade it). This means when Sentinel is going up, simultaneously sell EURUSD,GBPUSD,AUDUSD, and buy USDCHF,USDCAD,USDJPY (assuming all are set to 1 in inputs). When Sentinel is going down, simultaneously buy EURUSD,GBPUSD,AUDUSD, and sell USDCHF,USDCAD,USDJPY (assuming all are set to 1 in inputs). Draw trendlines and horizontal support and resistance lines on the Sentinel, and trade it that way. Just my 2 cents. Don

Hi Disbellj, how would you determine if the sentinel goes up ? - Sentinel crossing MA - short MA crosses long MA - MACD cross

Well, right now I'm trying to add 3LZZ Semafors indicator to the Sentinel, and trade all 6 currencies like I trade one with the Semafors. Until then, I draw trendlines like taught here: http://www.trendlinebook.com/ ...along with horizontal support and resistance (where the Semafors would be if they were on the Sentinel). Don

Spot FX brokers do not like news traders and consider them "toxic" because they use some sort of arbitrage in pricing between the feeds. what do you guys think of it?. I have a friend who consistently win with nes release and they cancel all of his winnings from news releases
