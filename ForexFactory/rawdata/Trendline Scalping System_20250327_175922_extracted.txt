Honestly the Fxglow rsi and mfi is better in terms of visuals.

It makes it easier for to find setups rather than reading the graphs.

But nice new thread, i will be posting here too.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
well on reality you will just lose

the only chance for us to win a little is to open orders randomly,

because their main system is easy, they just move the price up when theres more sellers than buyers and when the buyers are more than the sellers they just move the price down, but when the buyers and sellers are everywhere they will get confused because if they go up some will win if they go down some will win too and that is a big problem for them, because they make the game to win money not to lose it to you ppl

cheers

try to make them confused

--- 帖子 #14 ---
i'll give you a trading secret "but not like george's fantasy secret"

when you see a strategy or an indicator or an ea that has a good potential and it get spreaded widely on the net, try in these days "preferably the first days when it get announced/posted" to take the opposite of that stra/indi or ea, you will win always because the main system of the market makers is "on" on that strategy etc... entries which is when theres more sellers than buyers the price will go up, if you do this and it doesn't work know that you are too late because the herd stop following their leaders  or the stra/indi/ea wasn't that popular

Hi Bro,

In your zip file there are NO MFI indicator, could you upload again in post number one zip file, I use previous FxGlow MFI Meter and RSI indicator ,it always prompt the ad screen.

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
No RSI and MFI, it uses the default indicators found on your MT4

But i still prefer the FxGlow Indicators, it is better in my opinion

Hi Swilliam,

just a quick one, you are entering the trade on the candle on the right of the red arrow, right? Cos it says wait the close of the bar, but the red arrow was confusing me.

Thanks for the thread

--- 帖子 #33 ---
The candle on the right is the daily candle. Enter the trade on the close of the bar on M1/M5/M15.

Obviously the daily candle is still not closed until the end of the day.

if you want 100 examples, check the original thread TMT Scalping System

--- 帖子 #34 ---
I was referring to the chart of the post that I quoted, so to the candle on the right of the red arrow. Anyways thanks a lot to you as well for your contribution here and in other threads, it is alway much apreciated!!

You might say that I'm old school so I like to see where the indicators lines are and decide what to do based on the results. So, for me, this is better than the fxglow indicatos. I don't know why I didn't think about that earlier. Keep up the good work

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Hello everybody and thanks for your wonderful contributions to making this thread a great success. I have a suggestion which is to make a single indicator comprising of the rsi and mfi with alert to show when the agree. This i think will simplify the system.

Am i the only one that noticed this?

--- 帖子 #39 ---
I'm the same, they give a little more information.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
yes, the fxglow does not give any info, but is is just better in visuals... that's all.

The standard is better for in depth analysis, but in my case, my concern is if it is below or above 50%.

So colors are more convenient

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Hi buddy thanks for the thread.

Do you have preference of which market to trade, London and on or NYS? or it does not matter as long as the strength and volatility is there?

for example your daily candle could be bullish from London time and then comes NYS where things could change rather quickly but you still got your d1 candle bullish.. so in such case dose your other indicator rsi or mti etc, save you from false signal.. in more or less words anything in place to detect exhaustion.

Thx.

(I apologize if my question is elementary, i just took a quick glance of your thread, I appreciate your time for a quick reply.)

there is daily candle indicator. See the chart above, it is a green daily candle

OR just look at your D1 time frame chart.

If it is green, only buy on small timeframe, red only sell

--- 帖子 #44 ---
The original thread is the first few threads that I chanced upon and read, months back when I started learning about forex.

I have similar indicators as the bar/histogram MFI/RSI. I can do a quick conversion and put it up here if there's any interest. Or combine both into 1 subwindow, might be unsightly though.

I think the Trend Pro Scanner is the reason for the original thread to be moved to commercial since its pretty big on the chart and proprietary unlike the MFI/RSI bars which is really just a different way of presentation.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
We are not sure, but the trend pro has no commercial links.

And it is a very popular indicator that many people here in the forum use including me.

The fxglow has a website attached to it and the fxglow indicators alerts on a website link

That is most probably why.

Try the pairs you are comfortable with.

This strategy works in forex stocks and even crypto

--- 帖子 #50 ---
use the easy pairs that you can get help on this forum in interactive trading section

Leverage other peoples analysis. Use EURUSD GBPUSD to start with

--- 帖子 #51 ---
You are entirely correct to suggest EURUSD and GBPUSD since they both have low spreads. On the other hand the EURUSD has been terrible lately with a very low ATR; only 48 yesterday. We can only hope that it will increase next week.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Most prefer the london time.

trade the direction of the daily candle on THIS time, plain and simple.

Indicator that detects exhaustion no needed here, but you can add if you want

--- 帖子 #53 ---
@swilliam

Many thanks to present this strategy with such a simplicity and effective indicator, especially Daily Candle is very helpful.

Is it possible to change the setting for the Daily candle according to specific open time?

--- 帖子 #54 ---
I'm currently backtesting something similar with good success on EUR/USD. I'm not using the indicators though, just trendlines and price action.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
just keep the thread clean.

The main concept is trendline adding filters to improve success rate in long term

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Trend Line Break + Filter = Higher Probability

Trend Line + Momentum + Trend = Highest Probability

TMT Scalping is the BEST AF IMHO !

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Hello swilliam,

very nice and clear PA system

Here is a Trendline alert indicator for your system, just in case subs need one. Hope it is ok to post it.

By changing the trendline "name", more than one can be used and of course as a horizontal alert line too, if needed. Popup message and email alert included.

Hello,

thanks for sharing, where can i find a usage guide for these indicators?

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Hi lupus89, I don't know if there is a usage guide.

The trend magic just leave "Inputs" as they come pre set.

With the histograms, It's foreign language to me but pretty easy to guess. Here is a screenshot.

What's the red green line with long short arrows. Is that the pipinfinity one or you got a free version

Oh oops sorry. Just saw your last post. Is there the equivalent mt4?

--- 帖子 #75 ---
That's called half-trend nrp (original Super trend for metatrader made by Jason Robinson - calculation correction, repainting solving and mtf by mladen)

I've compared it against charts Pollen has posted and is slightly different to Pipfinite Trend Pro but close enough. - and it's free which is good

Yes, it is ideal to wait for candle to close

--- 帖子 #83 ---
It works in any pair, but since it is scalping use pairs with lower spread

--- 帖子 #87 ---
If you want a filter then get a Renko indicator with no repaint. It's the best "filter" available as a indicator.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
I didn't succeed with Renko's charts.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Whether an indicator repaints or not is not that relevant with Renko as long as the current data is valid. We trade in the present not the past. The trendline fast indicator repaints when you close and reopen the chart but the signals remain the same. Here is an example with the DAX. Red vertical line you sell, blue you buy and yellow you close the trade. If you want to know more look at this thread  https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...0#post12275560

--- 帖子 #90 ---
It's a good system for reviewing history. I would need unambiguous rules when to enter and when to step out on the right side of the chart. Best with alerts.

TMT (Trend-Momentum-Trendline) is a trend scalping trading system based on a set of trend indicators and oscillators. It is developed for MetaTrader 4 for working on short timeframes. The system is founded on a trendline breakthrough in the direction of trend and market momentum.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
TMT is a trend scalping system with one purpose only.....and that is to promote the hell out of the Trend pro products that Pollen is doing with his posts. The original TMT thread was made commercial because FF finally caught on to what these guys were doing... A few days later Swilliam creates this thread with trend line breaks so pollen can make more posts with those products on his screenshots.

Pollen is being careful not to make too many posts on this thread in case it becomes commercial again....

--- 帖子 #106 ---

I tried but they were not interested at all. Now they both have very good jobs so it's too late.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
You all are welcome guys. Happy to feel it worthy.

@Refilla

01. if this indi works on HTF like H4 an D1?

Yes of course this works in anytime frame.

02. why is it valid until 19.12.30 ?

Usually i do this because when testing we are able to find bugs. if there were, i need to update. So when there is a expiry this will not spread more and more. I experienced this. When i use some indicators those are full of bugs but still they are spreading although there are new updated versions. That is why i usually put a expiry.When expires specially me inspire to see new updated versions. I like to feel i do best although i cannot perfect 100%. Sometimes this may be a crazy idea of myself . I will post later without expiry. Thanks

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Thank you I will tell them  I fully paid for their university education and with good degrees they both got a good job in their chosen field. Unfortunately this is not the case for everyone and kids finish university with a degree and lots of debt. In many countries student loans can be wiped out by going bankrupt but it's not the case in the US. All student loans must be repaid and even going bankrupt will not erase that debt. Young people with student debt are stuck because they cannot progress quickly in life like prior generations did.

First post. You can also check the TMT Scalping System

--- 帖子 #257 ---
tried to shoot early on the ey and the eu.  went against the daily candle looking to break the 100 and 50 marks. daily was flicking on the eu but not the ey.  both failed. stops were kept tight so I only lost a little.  still holding an ozzie at even.   against the daily as well. long wick at the top so went for it.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
again against the daily candle because of long upper wick pending sell limit on swissy. all other rules comply. switched from using my OHLC heiken ashi alert to ema crossover. alert . less noise. long ema set to 12 so its right in between the 7 and 20 TMT emas.. sell limit has hit. sitting at even right now with ozzie 1 pip in the green.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
swissy, is not complying. serves me right going against daily candle. not stopped out yet but close. looking to make my life easier so using crossover as a heads up. then adding trendline with alert for the final confirmation. This in turn will help with chart watching. ozzie still holding at +or-1.  chop chop chop

heads up on cable.  was breaking trendline but has receded.  which makes me wonder about ey now.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
left  in trendline.  I think Im doing this right.   using market orders to enter which i dont like but trying to comply with rules.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Im already in this one but now its showing more compliance with the rules.   MFI just dipped down below 50 making it valid now.  Im holding and waiting.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Please confirm RSI and MFI rules

They should be above/below 50 on trend line break only ? because before break of trend line they can go sideway.

If trend line is break and we should wait until RSI and MFI for entry ??

--- 帖子 #265 ---
waiting.... broke resistance

--- 帖子 #266 ---
above 50 for buy bel;ow 50 for sell. I set mine at RSI 8 and MFI for 14.

I am still testing and learning.  it seems that we are looking for "fast longer candle on break which would correspond to a jump of both RSI and MFI.

I am finding the m5 noisy and may switch to m15.  it looks quieter and less false signals.  It also very choppy this morning.  this system works best when a clear direction forms.  basically its just entering on the pullbacks.  a 123 pattern

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Please what means thoses arrow on your chart ??

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Its a moving Average crossover.  Fast MA is set to 1 (line chart) and slow MA is set to 12 to be between my 7EMA and my 20 EMA.  Its just alerts me that price is inbetween the moving averages.   it does not give me a signal.

The trendline break is the signal to get ready but Im finding it to be  a little late.  but thats ok.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
I have my trade manager on my trades now and am in positive territory on three of the 4 so I can write a little bit on how to optimize this system.

below is the M15 of the ozzie.    Y0ou can see the long banner spreading over several days.  this is a good time to us m5 and realize your tp will be small.

the market does this about 70% of the time.

In contrast you have days like the blue square.

Here is where you need to keep patient and trail your stop.  Today is a banner day.  Tomorrow might be a runner.  just remember that runners are less likely..

Keep your stops tight.  if you are wrong you are wrong.  document it and move on.  it will help you if you journal it.

Never move a stop to give a trade "room to breathe" .  only a big loss can hurt you.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Im holding a buy from an m5 signal a while back but now on m15 its showing almost a sell signal. The MFI is still above 50 and the daily candle is green. but all the other elements are there. maybe time to tighten the stop and move on. chop chop chop

--- 帖子 #271 ---
The difference between a winning day and a mediocre day.  know when its a banner day.  kNow when its a pip fiesta!

--- 帖子 #272 ---
eu and ey buys banked 9 pips profit at 80z% letting the remaining 20% ride and squeeze the stop while raising the Take profit. free and clear trade at this pooint. worse case scenario I break even with the 20% plus spread. Being a banner day, Im not expecting much.   Once my trades are free and clear I start looking at swing positions.    To either let my remainders ride or to hang on to a runner.

The euro is still ooking strong on the h1.  The ozzie has bottomed out  so I will be setting that TP at the bottom and waiitn for a bounce.  The cable is also looking strong so Im still holding that with a 2 pip loss as of now.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
That swissy is being a turd!  Chop chop chop.    If you are still holding it its the right position in swing position.    My sell was stopped out.   Banner days suck.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
swissy is one of the most annoying pair to trade

--- 帖子 #275 ---
I have been asked to upload the EMA crossover signal.. RemeMber that this is ONLY to alert you that price is inside the MAs. I reset it on my template with the fast MA set to 1 and slow MA set to 7 to let me know there is a pullback. I changed it from 12 because I noticed when price was moving fast the MA would not retreat enough to generate a pullback signal.

THIS IS ONLY A HEADS UP INDICATOR! IS IS NOT A SIGNAL TO BUY OR SELL. THE TRENDLINE BREAK IS THE SIGNAL. THIS IS ONLY TO LET YOU KNOW TO PAY ATTENTION TO THAT CHART AND DRAW YOUR TRENDLINE.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Yes, still on that trade though. almost hit my SL

My eu and ey remainders are stopped out.  Draghi draggin the euro down after a bad Empire state report..   I'm still practicing and saving up to go live.  I can save faster than I can trade for now so when I know I can trade faster than I save I will go live.  Great system.  thanks!

--- 帖子 #279 ---
https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=329399

looking at adding these instead of the commercial trend indicator.  the first pullback is the best and I went looking for a supertrend indicator that would alert to trend changes,  this has it all.  not as simple as trend pro but looks just as effective.  I will set it up tonight.  my time is still limited so I may only get one trade in before work.  work keeps getting in the way of making pips.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
I used the super trend before and the halftrend, but i prefer the trend pro.

Trend Pro is more profitable in my experience with TMT Scalping

But we are not allowed to talk commercial things here, might get ignored.

Hey Guys, interesting thread. I tried to recreate the old "bar style" MFI and RSI indicators because it is easier to look at than a line, I have attached them, feel free to use them if you like. You can test if they match(they should) by lining them up with the RSI and MFI and comparing.

I know beggars cant be choosers but could you have a color change for over bought and oversold as well?  I think that could be used for help with exits.  They don't have to be different colors.  Just a third color when RSI>70 or <30.  I could try and tinker with it but not sure where to put the else statement.

hi pollen, do you trade index with this system?

--- 帖子 #299 ---
My last trade broke even.  But I tend to cover my trades quickly.  BE trades are win trades IMO when scalping.  Unfortunately,  my time is limited and Im only home and awake during the slowest session.  If you follow the rules,  this is a good system.

Some of the enhancements  beyond the rules I recommend.

Wait for an excited candle to break the trendline.  If its just drifting its probably a false start but the MFI may filter it out.  redraw your line.

Trade after London open.  There is a thing called the "franki Fake"  As frankfurt opens China and Japan are closing up so there is a lot of indecsion in the hour before London.

Try to get the First signal on a trend change.  These are the most probable to run.    the second has less pips available.

I'm keeping this book marked and going up to daily TF for something else.  Pullback trading is a time tested pattern that works.  With these filters and the rules I venture to guess your win rate could get as high as 70%.  But 60% is more than adequate.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
in on the gu. More downside. The frankie fake will probably take me out but that's the way it goes when you can only trade before it. added super trend MTF. set to 60 and m5 for better confirmation. The 60 will be my alert to longer term trends. the five will heelp with confirmation. BE at 7 Partial TP at 15 Final at hourl;y support. Stop loss 10

--- 帖子 #301 ---
First TP hit. Remainder almost hit. slid it down to h4 support. if this holds today I will switch to Fractal candle manager.

the original code doesnt function like what this thread intends to..

since i want it to function like what this thread system which is to show rsi(8) >50 (one colour) and <50 (another colour), i modified the code a little..

n from there i modified again for mfi(14) to show again >50 and <50 conditions..

note: i'm not a programmer, just someone who understands codes a little and since the codes are not complex n free, why not changed it a little.. hope it is useful and error free..

Hi Sr. Pollen,

I've a question about the Targets for profit in the 5M timeframe. If we decide to divide the trade in 3 exit points, TP1, TP2 and TP3, the 1st point (TP1) it would be about how many pips in general? 10 pips? 1 x ATR? and the other 2 points, TP2 and TP3?

Understanding the money management has been the difficult part for me in Forex.

Hello Everyone,

I have a suggestion for you to give more probability to this system.

Examine your H4 candlestick patterns and the 'recent' price levels those patterns are bouncing of. For example, scan the market for a H4 bullish/bearish engulfing pattern and it has to be on a previous S/R. This will give you an edge in trading the 5 min chart.

Yesterday, I made 50+ pips on three trades: Long USDCAD (12 pips) , Long GBPJPY (36 pips), Long EURCHF (16 pips). Check your charts every three or four or 5 hours to scan good looking and textbook candlestick formations (You can use a period converter to get custom TFs). I scanned yesterday every four hours and found a couple of good looking bullish engulfing patterns. But be mindful with how big the candle is, how much price has moved. Is there room for some more pips. There is a lot of commonsense and how you feel the trade.

Now, on the M5 and M15 and M1 charts, you can definitely use your system in this thread and you can add some basic PA common sense. For example, false breaks on LTFs in the opposite direction for good stop-loss positioning, tops, bottoms, wedges, divergences, etc. Wait for some form of PA building on the LTFs in addition to the 7,21 EMAs pullback used in this thread.

I would avoid H1 candles as they may mislead you and concentrate on four-hour candles to get the very immediate bias/momentum and trade accordingly.

------

First pic is H4

Second is M5

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Another example with GBPNZD.

In this one, I will use the setting you are following here in this nice thread and I will apply my own analysis or the way I trade these small TFs of M5 and M1 with regard to the overall relevant PA. I hope you all do.

H4 picture

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

finding a smaller Time Frame for more details

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Entry chart could be M5 or M1 or M2 or even Range/Renko bars. M1 is used here with your template.

We will notice that waiting for the right PA on M1 (the bottoming) timed very well with the entry conditions of the system.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

------

Note that when I trade, I do not really like the incomplete Head and shoulder patterns because of what I mentioned before in the M30 chart. It is tricky to find the true level for the second shoulder.

Sure thing.

First of all, it is all about the bigger picture with this GBPCAD short trade that netted around 18/19 pips.

On H what can we see? We have an S/R Level. We have an incomplete or immature inverse head and Shoulder forming. We have the first shoulder, bottoming of the pattern and the second shoulder is where we are shorting. What significance would this make to our M5 scalp? Well, Identify your territory. What are our borders? How big the move to expect?

We are purely inside a range at the time of entry in the right shoulder.

The second thing on H4, price is clearly rejecting the Level and here we plan for the entry immediately after the red candle that closed on the same level of the green one. There was also a shooting star H4 candle before that as well. Anyway we have a confirmation there is a fall and we need to find entries on M5/M15 or M1.

On M5, we had a break out south and I put my target above a daily pivot line and 38.2 fib retracement. Price went 30 pips further south.

2 trades from today - Loss and a win

Made a mistake on this GA trade.

From my experience- the best setups are those that are poised to make a new high/low of the day. Middle can be an uncertain ground.

also, there was no retracement/rejection inside the EMAs

hit SL -10

Hi,

would you share your indicators or chat with me privately. I love it.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
found all on first post. i just replaced my trend indicator.

But same concept

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Hello guys!) I’ll insert my five cents.

Firstly, the DailyCande indicator does not take into account the time of the terminal. And this, in turn, is very important. After all, the strategy is based on the assumption that the movement begun in the Asian session will continue in the London and American sessions. You can see this in the attached images. On my terminal, broker time + 3GMT. One indicator does not take into account the time of the broker, the other takes into account.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Secondly, this trading system is not completely independent.

The signals of the system must be strictly filtered on higher timeframes. And probably the most important thing is to be able to build trend lines. And understand where to build them is not necessary. If anyone is interested, you can verify this by running the adviser. In general, it fully works according to the rules of the system.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
actually the daily candle can vary a bit depending on broker GMT offset.

I have been using a broker with +3. System works good.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
This is a very good system if it is part of another system. Perhaps in conjunction with your tools, it gives good results. But based only on the files of the first post, it will obviously lead to a loss of money. I will make my small contribution to this thread). Maybe someone will be useful. In the attachment is the DailyCandle indicator, in it you can set the time for the start of trading.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
the indicator on the first post is fine. Thanks anyway for sharing.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
looking at how a larger sample starts to look, this is probably correct

however, if you introduce a discretionary filtering system the whole thing becomes a discretionary system; therefore any possible filtering on a higher timeframe needs to be non-discretionary as well

I will post results once I hit like 75 trades or something

Hi,

do you mind other timeframes at all when you evaluate your trades?

because in your recent buy on EU almost every higher TF shows a downtrend.

greetz

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Thanks to the Op

--- 帖子 #454 ---
I agree with the Eur/Usd being in a downtrend on all the Higher timeframes, but I think because it's scalping the HTFs are less important, because you don't want to be in the trade for very long but maybe @pollen can shed some light here. Thanks

--- 帖子 #455 ---
i was just curious because on his images it shows this "trend pro scanner" thing and that indicates his general interest in looking what the price does in higher timeframes.

would be nice if you can clarify Mr. Pollen

greetings

--- 帖子 #456 ---
just the current timeframe. Just follow the rules mentioned on the first post.

You can use higher Timeframe on some instances, and it can help you get more profit per trade.

Usually when counter trend, i get only 10pips max.

When with the trend, i can extend further

--- 帖子 #457 ---
You dont need to use the trend pro scanner.

Its just my personal taste to add to TMT and been using it for more than 1 year.

Keeps trend filtering simple and stress free and fast.

You can just follow the rules on the first post and add any indicator you want. Im not here to discuss about commercial stuff, there is a commercial thread.

Buy +12 pips, Sell +20pips. Both followed TMT rules.

BUT Obviously Sell was with the trend (higher TF trend) so i decided to ride it

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #458 ---
To those who are new to this system. All the rules are outlined on the first post.

Don't complicate things. You can add some filters as long as the principle is intact.

First experience the system before asking things such as modifying it.
Later you will know what needs to be added depending on your trading style and risk tolerance

Have a good weekend

It's the panel for the Ding Dong Order EA, attach the EA to the Experts Folder and load the template again, then you'd be able to use the panel. however I will make a new post without the EA shortly.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
It helps to know or at least gauge the likelihood of which pairs will have uni-directional movement and wait for them.

That is what I've attempted to put together here.

The ADR indicator highlights the the pairs that have moved the highest in the past 5 days and the Currency strength indicator gives the relative strength of the individual currencies.

I did not include the Ding Dong order EA so you can add that at your choosing.

@Pollen - many thanks for posting your screenshots, however I do have one little gripe: they don't contain the original system's 7 and 20 EMAs and as I don't have the indicators you're using, and don't understand what they are showing, I'm finding it a little difficult to follow how you identified the signal.

Would you be able to post screenshots without the Trend Pro stuff and show the EMAs instead in future?  Alternatively, could you point me to a source for a description of how to read the indicators you're using please?  Please feel free to PM me if that would be easier.

I havent been trading this lately because I am busy having a great quarter with stocks

Just wanted to share my results which I logged in from Sep 1 to Oct 10

Total 54 trades

31 wins - 23 loss

Net Pips (ECN account) - 110

most trades per day - 5

Overall it works if you are aware of the higher time frame and able to read price action, but the average of cca 5 pips per day is not enough for me

Thank you very much

--- 帖子 #513 ---
You are right saying that it takes years of practice to consistently make 20 pips a day. I have been trading forex since 2006 and I don't make 20 pips every day; sometimes more sometimes less and I also have my fair share of losing trades. 20 pips a day is an achievable goal but is somewhat optimistic, better would have been to state 100 pips a week except for the summer months and between 15 December and 15 January when the market slows down. One important thing is to never stop learning even when using an excellent system

Please read the first post. As you can see the system works best on the break of the trendline. No trendline break = no trade.

You might want to try the TMT Scalping System at https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=577639  since it is the same but for some people it's easier to use.

You need to use the original indicators and get used to it before using other indicators

An Example of good 'Inner Signal'

Here is the setting How to catch this signal:

MaTrendFilter = true

InnerTrendFilter = true

MFIFilter = true

RSIFilter = true

TrendLineC = true

InnerSignal = true

--- 帖子 #631 ---
A setting about TMT-Scanner you must to know:

TrendLineA, TrendLineB, TrendLineC, InnerSignal is a GROUP

Example 1:

TrendLineA = true

TrendLineB = true

TrendLineC = true

InnerSignal = true

Any ONE of them are matched means "Matching"

Example 2:

TrendLineA = false

TrendLineB = false

TrendLineC = false

InnerSignal = true

That means "InnerSignal" must be matched.

How many signal did you get in one day?

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Hi bp,

Here is the indi I was talking about.  It is a version of the Alma that was modified by Hayseed.

It has the zigzag built into it and provides alerts when in the direction or not in the direction of zz.

The only problem is the alerts are none stop.  Super annoying.

If we could limit the alerts to only 1 occurrence and make them user input of yes/no.

Then I think it something could provide further confirmation.

Let me know what you think.

tks,

Hi,

I have been watching this thread and wanted to ask if it is effective on higher timeframes?

I watch support and resistance, then candle action for entering a trade.

This trendline approach could be good to support my trading ideas?

I thought trendlines were too difficult to get correct often enough to be effective, but your thread has helped.

The Trendline Scalping System is good on any timeframes. If you use the fxglow MFI and RSI they were not designed to be used above the M15 timeframe.

One is for TMT-Scanner only. One is full of indicators and a simple "Symbol Changer".

Because TMT-Scanner is based on "Symbols Changer", when we change the symbol, we need calculate all symbol's signal. It is too slow when we change the symbol.

But in this case we cannot draw trendline.

Dear Pollen.. i am new one of this trading method. so thanks a lot for sharing of this system. so i have to verify some thing with you about this system.

shall i use this system in manually (that mean draw a trend line in manually)

other thing is before closing of the day how can we confirm the daily candle is green or red (because the color can be change very immediately)

as a experience person of this method ,do you have to wait with the PC much more time when you doing the trading ? (having very stress )

so some time i am can be wrong ,but if you have a free time please write me to clarify the above issue

Pollen would you mind sharing some information around how you manage your positions? Its difficult to see as you haven't posted any loosing trades. Do you move your stop to BE at a certain point? Or if a trade starts going against you do you just let it do its thing until it either stops you out or goes back into profit? More information around this would be much appreciated.

Hi to everyone,

I just discovered this wonderful thread only yesterday and I like it very much for its simplicity. I started testing it based on bp2000's latest scanner with very good results and I would like to add maybe one good filter to it - Auto Fibonacci trading zones - see attached picture, where there is a Buy signal now, but it is in Red zone means possible trend reversal to sell, so I will not take it. So basically buy rule in Blue zone or near it and sell in Red zone or near it. Easy. If you think it is interesting I can post this indicator or you can google for it, its free on net.

Thanks.

Regards,

Tea

--- 帖子 #874 ---

--- 帖子 #875 ---
back to my 1st post where I described the basics of AFTZ - there were a Buy signal and see it turned to opposite so it was good that I do not take this Buy signal

--- 帖子 #876 ---
Can i have you templare and indicators

--- 帖子 #877 ---
Dear bp2000 could you please check the scanner as I found some limitations regarding symbols using suffix as I can put manually only 23-24 instead of 28 without suffix.

Thanks a lot.

Tea

--- 帖子 #878 ---
Hi Teapeak - what period do you use on the Autofibo?

Great idea

--- 帖子 #879 ---
Scanner is auto detect suffix, no need to entry suffix.

Max symbols is 30

--- 帖子 #880 ---
Thanks. I am using 240

--- 帖子 #881 ---
hmmm, then maybe issues with my broker. will check again. One question, when I put manually 1 symbol with suffix It is displayed with suffix, but when auto its displayed witout suffix. Is it correct?

--- 帖子 #882 ---
could you lay out the indicator?

--- 帖子 #883 ---
Excellent, that's the default. I've been trying that today paper trading with a model where longs were taken either above 50% or when the price was in the buy zone (or had touched it in the last 5 candles) and vice versa for shorts. 0.2% risk for initial trades and 0.1% for continuation trades from 09:00-14:00.

Would be a healthy 1.1% up with 0.3% still in play

But to give you number, i have around 66-70% win rate

--- 帖子 #960 ---
trendline break is the trigger. But patterns are good arsenal in addition

--- 帖子 #961 ---
In this approach, trend line are best drawn manually because you get to learn the system in a traders point of view.

Not relying to indicators to draw trend lines and support resistance levels is must have skill any traders should learn.

Nice weekend

--- 帖子 #962 ---
i would ask you if the angle of your trendlines is 45° or something else

--- 帖子 #963 ---

--- 帖子 #964 ---
What time do you use to trade?

--- 帖子 #965 ---
mostly london, but sometimes asia session but for small pips ony and when trendline break is A+

--- 帖子 #966 ---
Hi Pollen,

It says in the first post stop loss 10-30 pips. How do you decide your stop loss and take profit? Do you go for 1:1 0r 1:2 risk reward? Or do you you use support and resistance?

Thank you,

Yana

--- 帖子 #967 ---
Hello, Pollen! How much do you set take profit in points in a trade? Do you have a fixed take profit?

--- 帖子 #968 ---
This is dynamic and depends on market structure. If you are starting, you can use SL and TP 12 pips which is 1:1

As per the rules aren't the histograms below supposed to be blue when you taking a buy?

And price be between moving averages but you don't use the moving averages at all?

You must be new. Well see the histograms here on the entry point??? They are Blue

I mentioned that i dont use moving averages. I replaced them with a better trend filter of my preference.

But those who begin the system need to use MA first and see what works for them.

The core of the system is Drawing Trendlines

--- 帖子 #980 ---
I'm not exactly new, I used to follow the original TMT system, I was just wondering that if you don't use the rules intended for the strategy and use your own tools instead which no one else has, then I really don't see how your posts help anyway else to be honest since no one else uses the indicator you use.

And I'm yet to see a single losing post from you aswell.

Im saying this because too many times threads die because people start changing the original method and start putting their own indicators instead of just opening a new thread of their own.

--- 帖子 #981 ---
Pollen has been transparent and honest with the way and manner he uses the system. It is rather worth learning his winning ways instead of castigating him. I as a person have benefitted from his numerous and consistent postings. Pollen, please keep it up.

--- 帖子 #982 ---
All I'm saying is it would be nice if people followed the rules of the thread so that everyone is trading the same way with the same indicators and exiting the same way aswell so that everyone learns ,

Because I don't see how the group grows or anyone else learns by modifying the rules and using paid Indicators and having your own exit which is totally different from the strategy. Atleast post losing trades so that people learn, I haven't seen a single losing trade.

I'm not being negative, his method might work very well actually, but I just think people should stick to the thread rules or if they want to modify the strategy they should also change the rules in the 1st page or just make a different thread instead so that we can see consistency.

Its  just constructive criticism, don't mean to offend anyone.

@Pollen

@swilliam

Wanted to as you both about using the daily candle direction as confirmation. Trading on such a small timeframe using daily candle as direction seems pointless since lets say the daily candle can be 100 pips bullish and it can keep going down to turn red but you're still trying to buy as it goes down.

Wouldn't a better alternative to use 4hr or 1hr as a filter?

Just curious to see if you tried other alternatives and why daily is best.

--- 帖子 #989 ---
@swilliam,

Just wanted to make sure you see message above ^, really interested in your thoughts if 4hr could work better then daily. i noticed using daily as direction you miss lots of profitable trades, lets say daily candle has big wick up top and starting to move down but still bullish, you would miss sell trades. but with 4 hour you can catch them.

--- 帖子 #990 ---
I also noticed that sometimes a large candle brings doubt when making a decision to open a trade

You can use the MA indicator to start. Using special trend indicators wont help if trendlines are not drawn correctly.

--- 帖子 #1014 ---
its OK, but sometimes signals at the end of US ranges. So better to grab less than 10 pips in my opinion.

That is not always the case, but you can test out

Happy new year everybody!

Swilliam: thank you for thoughtfully sharing your system and keeping the two threads active and clean.

Pollen: really appreciate your consistent posts showing visually what this system can do.

I've reviewed at least 500 posts... Quick clarifying questions:Do you only trade in the direction of the daily candle? Is that the daily candle starting with the with Asian session open (a few hours after NY close)? Are you trading primarily London and NY? I have seen some Asian session trades too. Is there a time that you try to avoid? For example a lot of daily candles have long wicks that mean during the last parts of the NY session price went counter to the daily candle color. This means that trading in the direction of the daily candle would have a statistical disadvantage. How do you use the scanner? Do you look for MTF confirmation (e.g. on M15 and H1) or do you just focus on the M5?

--- 帖子 #1024 ---
1. Yes, direction of the candle, mostly london session.

2. Yes, somtimes on Asia when i see a good setup and clear candle direction

3. Not filtering daily candles. I trade when there is a good trendline break and has space from s/r levels

4. Scanner not a part of the system. I just use it to check higher TF trends and confluence

--- 帖子 #1035 ---
Hey all,

been lurking for a while but started testing this and I'm enjoying it...

Q's

- How do you handle days like what we had yesterday? USD pairs spent about half the day fighting against the daily trend and there was quite a few fakeouts.

- How do you not overtrade with a strategy like this? I know its psychological but do you have set daily targets / limits to achieve?

- Has anyone had success with smaller TP/SL? (5pip TP, 3.5pip SL)

- Do you recommend just looking for pairs that are strong and weak or do you focus on a select few all the time?

Many thanks - E

--- 帖子 #1036 ---
1. fakeouts cannot be avoided. You will avoid most if you correctly draw trendlines and follow direction of daily candle on london

2. this only you can answer

3. too small, specially SL. Dont get caught in tight SL

4. No

Simple monday morning trade.

I follow original rules. Difference is that i take partial at tp1, and trail until major S/R, in this case ADR.

Go in a continuation trade aswell.

--- 帖子 #1077 ---
USDCAD 5M

SL 1.5 ATR - TP1 1ATR

Partial at 1 ATR, trail rest untill major S/R area, in this case higher ADR.

And its last trade of the day, atm with 5.27% on the day, which i think its not bad for such a simple strategy.

Have a nice day.

--- 帖子 #1078 ---
AUDUSD 5M

Well, i saw this really nice setup and couldn't go away without taking this trade.

Rules are the same, and my rules aswell.

SL 1.5ATR, TP1 1ATR.

Forgot to say, trade at BE+1 pip for spreads+commissions, when hit TP1.

Partial at 1ATR, trail rest until major S/R area, in this case lower ADR.

USDCAD 5M

Running risk free, trailing price. 6.77% for today and 1 trade running risk free.

Have a nice day.

HI Pollen

could you share your indicators? it looks very amazing.

thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #1097 ---
indicators on 1st post. But the histigram versions are on the TMT Scalping thread

--- 帖子 #1098 ---
Hey Ajentha, good setup but since you have added an extra MA to your setup, I would suggest instead add only the 200 ma as a long trend guide(only) if you notice at the time of your entry the 200 was just below and the price action has been respecting the 200ma as support which would hold this trade as a short or wait for a break of the 200, also (as my own opinion) the mfi is rising near the cross (50) which added the 200ma in the way wouldn't take the trade.

Just my humble input.

Take care!

Short on GU

--- 帖子 #1102 ---
The best approach to SL and TP is support and resistance levels.
If you are new, you can start with a constant value and adjust as needed.
Try SL and TP around 10-20 pips depending on pair volatility and session.
I usually set my TP around 7-10pips on Asia time and 10-12pips on London time.
My SL, ranges from 10-20pips.

I dont think this system is good. I think no one can earn with that money management. You need 1:3 risk . You cant go 1:1 risk . I always using 1:3 or bigger 1:6. Try to think . If you are using 8 pips sl then you need 20 - 30 pips profit. Just do your best . Good luck

--- 帖子 #1115 ---
this depends. 1:1 is  already good for scalping

If you target 1:2 or more, scalping is not the system you need

As a contribution, let me tell you that these results are due to trade against the real trend. Your Emas does not tell you the real trend. I use your great indicator with an EMA 200 or above. Good results.

Hi bp2000, great job and congratulations.

To improve the quality of the signal, it would be useful for the indicator to leave the brakout signals in the history of chart.

This thing would allow to understand with other indicators if the losing signals can be filtered

Thanks

on 14.05.2021 you show an operation for Buy of EUR / YPJ at a price of 132.534 at 07:45 and a hit stoploss at 09:45 at the level of 132.389. There is no such entrance on my Admiral's mt4 then.

OK got it . In the picture you can see that I use a total of 4 EMAs. This is the system I'm working on. It covers in part

and your system from which I receive an early signal with 1 candle. I use 7,21,84 and 336 EMA on M15. I use EMA21 as the axis of rotation for the moment. And the other EMAs are EMA21 on M5 = 7, M15 = 21, on H1 = 84 and on H4 = 336, When I see the trends of M5-EMA7 (3 five minute candles make 15 minutes EMA21 / 3 = EMA7), H1-EMA84 (21 on M15 x 4 candles = 60) and H4 -EMA336 (21X16- H4 = 16 15-minute candles and 21x16 = 336). And based on this picture I determine my daily direction of play. If they are useful to you, use them. And the picture below shows that for the day I have to eliminate all village signals and play only bye as it is with you for this day, but it is not always so because the current candle is a very short period for trend and saves you only the small stop moose. I eliminate it with supporting operations at a certain distance until the price closes a 15-minute candle <Ema336 and reverse the operation with lot = the sum of all closed operations + the initial lot (for the new operation). But this is another way out without a minus. It's off topic, so have a nice day

--- 帖子 #1245 ---
Could you test the inputs for the TP and SL using ATR period instead of 15pips. So TP could be 2 X ATR value, Stop could be 3 X ATR value. Might add more accuracy especially with the variants of each pair.

Hey @bp2000, Ive been using your scanner for couple of day and finding quite handy to track the pairs, got 2 queries for you though:

1. Alert button keeps switching to OFF when we swap pairs, does that happen to you also, could you check that?

2. I see you coded the EA for MT5 as well, any chance we could get the scanner for MT5 too? I am a M10 trader

and find this Strategy to work better than 5/15 for more frequent and clearer signals.

Thank you in advance and great work!!

P.

--- 帖子 #1248 ---
1. This is normal. If the alarm is not automatically turned off, you will be repeatedly notified when you switch to another currency pair.

Solution: You can open two windows, one to install only the scanner, the other to install the trading system plus Symbol Changer, or you can also use the EA to receive notifications.

2. This will take some time.

--- 帖子 #1273 ---
To those who use EA without any trading orders:

Please check the "Experts" tab first to see if there are any error messages.

Is there a signal but no order? Or is there no signal at all? How long has there been no signal?

Is the funding sufficient? What is the minimum lot size?

Are there other EAs using the same Magic Number?

Are there any changes to the EA settings?

If it still doesn't work after the inspection, I suggest not to use EA. It is also good to use TMT-Scanner.

The two losses below from just before NYO. First image AU B signal. Second image EU A signal.

@ bp2000 Is it possible to try to filter the EU signal. That candle was 11 pips and almost 7 pips below the C line. The setup looked alright but the break was too far and a manual trader wouldn't have taken this trade.

Does the AU look correct? I have my maxorders set to 5. If say the AU setup occurred, but I already had five orders open, then one closed. Would the AU then be initiated, but late?

Scalping dax with tmt works, but mabee it's not such a good idee using tfs like m1 or m5

DAX Spikes 7 pips and then a fast backmove taken out  you SL if to tight. This happens in volatil Times again and again.

So the Most dificult Part of your trading is the handling of the stoplosses. If to tight or Set to break even to early, you can not gainn 10 or more pips,  yuo must be satisfied with 5 pips. So next month I  go back to Forex Eurusd or cable like I dit Before. I feel much more save trading forex..

These are great setups. Was the EJ sell based on the 4H?

--- 帖子 #1420 ---
quite right, H4 showed the start of the setup, then zoom in with lower TF (H1, M30, M15..) and M5 was the trigger on a pullback, the exit was on the first RSI reversal.  If I zoomed out to higher TF I could have stayed a bit longer, but it doesn't matter, maybe next time I will confirm with higher TF.

--- 帖子 #1421 ---
unable to downlaod the file bruh

--- 帖子 #1422 ---
which file is that?

--- 帖子 #1423 ---
do you look for the same pullback setup on the H4 as the M5? also, why do you prefer H4 over D1?

--- 帖子 #1424 ---
I would if my setup TF is D1, then my pullback would be a lower TF like H4 or H1. H4 presents more opportunities than D1.

--- 帖子 #1425 ---
Do you use SR on the higher time frames? I was planning on following the first post, trade in the direction of the daily candle and trade the pullbacks on M5 but use H1 for SR.

--- 帖子 #1426 ---
SR are useful for entry points of price rejection on resistance or bounce off support and also for target projection. I use PVSRA or SonicR Access panel which provide all what I need, you can choose which type of SR you want to display. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Are you using the system on 1H charts now?

--- 帖子 #1432 ---
No, I'm still using M5 but this chart illustrates what I said earlier.

--- 帖子 #1433 ---
1. check direction of d1 candle

2. look for entry points on h1/h4 based on trend direction and SR

3. look for trades on m5

Am I understanding correctly?

--- 帖子 #1434 ---
yes, check direction of D1,

wait for setups on H4 in the same direction,

zoom down to H1 and check the RSI changing color, (I'm using the histogram but you can use the original above /below 50) if price already ahead of you don't run after it, zoom further down until you get a better entry on a pullback.

once you place your trade and SL plan your exit on a near by S/R or on the next change in RSI color (if you got out too soon it's ok, you can wait for re-entry on the next change in color provided the trend is still valid) if you see more than three pullbacks on the M5 be very careful of a reversal, zoom back up and see what's happening, look at the daily wick, is it getting longer.... I keep the H4 and D1 candles on the same chart (you can get the last three candles by applying Anycandlegroup.mq4 twice and choose the H4 and D for TF and shift them apart to get adequate space between them).

I think its very important NOT to take all setups, and trade in high volatility sessions like London start or NY start. Exit at London close if price is going no where and your target is not reached.

I also find ForextrenHero very useful in watching for new setups on different TF, you can choose 4 different TF.

Can you post your candle stick indicator, please?

https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...9#post12829149

--- 帖子 #1437 ---
Guys, when u look at the D1 Candle do u pay attention to size and shape of the candle( for example hammer or shooting star) or only RED or GREEN for Sell or Buy ?

--- 帖子 #1438 ---
The D1 candle is a dynamic price action in progress, unless you’re talking about the previous day candle which is already set and closed. Take a look at the D candle below, at the open and until the NY open it was red, then after NY open it reversed. So before that you would have taken sell trades if the RSI was below 50, I took two sell trades, then after that the candle became green and RSI was above 50 so I took a long trade exited when the rsi histo changed color. By that time the D candle started to have a longer upper wick and there was an opportunity to take a short trade but I did not take it coz too close to LC. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1439 ---
it looks like most of your trades are reversals after the MAs cross back over into the direction of the daily candle rather than pull backs into an ongoing trend. is this a different type of entry than the entry in the first post?

I missed the trade in the attached image today as I am also working but it looks like a good example of the type of pull back we are looking for, though the MFI is not ideal at the time of the break.

--- 帖子 #1440 ---
How is it different if I'm taking my trades in the same direction of the daily candle, do you think that D1 starts red and stays red all the time? or vice versa? sometimes like the example I showed it starts red and the trades were short, then it turned green and so what am I supposed to do? wait for it to become red again? I'm not looking at higher TF to see what the trend is, if the trend is up or down for several days in a row then yes I would ride the trend and enter on pullbacks, but days like this one you have mini trends which you can ride and also enter on pullbacks.

In the example that you showed, the daily candle was green at the open all the way until 1 hour after NY open, then it turned red, and you have your 3 pullbacks, one before and two after

I find the MFI is misleading sometimes, that's why I combined the RSI and MFI in one histo by adding the RSI on top of the MFI, much cleaner signal in and out, but that's me.

PS: I find 6 opportunities in today's range not just 3

--- 帖子 #1441 ---
Thank you so much.

What about pair selection, when u see FAT candle on EURUSD as example do u stay in that pair for the rest of the day if all day green candle will stay or u look for more pair and trade multiply pair in the same time. Im trying to get myself discipline, need advise please

--- 帖子 #1442 ---
Not sure what you mean by FAT, but yes if the trend remains valid then I will stay in. I've yet to find a good exit indicator that will not take me out prematurely. Most of the time if the RSI indicates exit and the trend still valid then re-entry on pullback is few candles away.

I try to concentrate on one or two pairs, I do not trade all day and try to look for setups around LO or NYO.

--- 帖子 #1443 ---
quick one. i did also lose one earlier, though.

it does seem like london open has the best trade opportunities, at least on the few pairs i follow.

--- 帖子 #1444 ---

--- 帖子 #1445 ---
For your last GU sell, my indicator did not show a red bar yet. Based on the MFI, it's not below the 50 line. But on yours it's red. How are you calculating the RSI and MFI?

--- 帖子 #1446 ---
I am using the RSI and MFI bar, overlaid on top of each othe in one window. If you do that you will find that the RSI overpowers the MFI bar which I find useful and less confusing.

--- 帖子 #1447 ---
If that's the case, then the MFI isn't really being used.

--- 帖子 #1448 ---
I think so, yes, I just kept is because I did not do any testing without it and did not want to change the original recommendations from the creator.

PS: I just checked the settings of my MFI and found that the default is 15 not 14, try it and see if it will show red for you too.

The RSI default is 7 not 8, I did not not change them from whoever uploaded them so I assumed they're the same.

--- 帖子 #1449 ---
I changed MFI to 15 and now it's red. Interesting

--- 帖子 #1450 ---
problem solved? you also need to change the RSI to 7 not 8.  Whoever changed those settings must have done some testing and found the right settings.

--- 帖子 #1451 ---
I was wonder if will be possible to create telegram group for that trading system so we can all share ideas and live trading  it will be much more faster

--- 帖子 #1452 ---
I don't want to change the system yet as I'm still learning and I may be missing something but it seems as though MFI is unnecessary. I will likely remove it in the future if I do not see a use for it but I'm keeping it as I gain experience. I've made one trade today and MFI was not in confluence – see attached image.

Just two days but I've only been trading this system for about one business week so it's probably not best to base anything on my trades.

I made another trade on the GBPUSD for 8 or 9 pips only. Wasn't really a trade based on the system, price was just leaving the pullback zone. I sold once price started ranging after a few bars.

--- 帖子 #1459 ---
Thanks bro I'll jump in the chat tomorrow morning.

--- 帖子 #1460 ---
I agree, I have not found the MFI useful myself and that's why I combined the RSI and MFI in one window. I find M5 TF to be more accurate for entry as it can show you a retrace for a better price, and since you already set your SL and profit then the exit TF will not matter.

Good idea, I will try to join whenever I can

please update the indicator , its no longer work now

--- 帖子 #1468 ---
I've been monitoring the thread "1 Minute Pullback System" which has been very popular on FF these days. After analyzing that I applied those concepts to this system in a different way. Ultimately I came to the conclusion that in an ever expanding and contracting market, mean reversion is a very strong concept.

This is my interpretation of this system. Context - I like to scalp volatile indices on short time frames so I usually exit after a bar or two of profit.

The indicator that I'm using to identify the trend is called Half-Trend, it's a very popular and widely used indicator. The logic I'm applying to the system is along the lines of some kind of mean reversion. Essentially, if price has moved "really"(subjective) far from the Half-Trend and Half-Trend has not changed color(trend) then I'm assuming price will pull back to it's mean. I'm using the tried-and-true MACD as an extra layer of validation and confirmation. I'm only entering when the MACD shows weakness and price is relatively far from the Half Trend. We could also use volume in confluence with both indicators for even further filtering.

For the time being this system proves to be very accurate, however I just started back testing today and will do some small forward testing tomorrow.

some examples exemplifying my reasoning

Hey peachblast, nice scalping you got there, I believe entries here are with the trend (the 7 & 20 EMA) which is the essence of this thread "Trendline Scalping System" (please refer to the first page for more details). Trades are initiated upon break of the trendline and upon continuation after pullback towards the line, however I think you are doing counter trend entries or am I mistaken?. Please state your entries clearly i.e what are your conditions for long and short entries using the indicators you mentioned.

Regards LB

hi, i just trying to create my EA. I cannot create new threads so, sorry for me to post my question here.

i create a grid ea. It can work on the stratetry tester. But when i run on realtime, it cannot place order.

My script to calculate value:
Inserted Code void CalculateTradeParameters() {
double grid_range = NormalizeDouble(MarketInfo(Symbol(), MODE_BID) * GridPercentage / 100 / 10 * 100 * _Point, Digits);

double start_buy_price = MarketInfo(Symbol(), MODE_ASK);
S1 = NormalizeDouble(start_sell_price + 1 * grid_range * _Point * 100, Digits);
S2 = NormalizeDouble(start_sell_price + 2 * grid_range * _Point * 100, Digits);
TP_S1 = NormalizeDouble(start_sell_price + (1 - 1) * grid_range*0.99 * _Point * 100, Digits);
TP_S2 = NormalizeDouble(start_sell_price + (2 - 1) * grid_range*0.99 * _Point * 100, Digits);

B1 = NormalizeDouble(start_buy_price - 1 * grid_range * _Point * 100, Digits);
B2 = NormalizeDouble(start_buy_price - 2 * grid_range * _Point * 100, Digits);
TP_B1 = NormalizeDouble(start_buy_price - (1 - 1) * grid_range*1.01 * _Point * 100, Digits);
TP_B2 = NormalizeDouble(start_buy_price - (2 - 1) * grid_range*1.01 * _Point * 100, Digits);

}

if (signal=="start" ) {
// Place Sell Orders
if (!DoesOrderExistWithComment("S1")) {

}

Love the simplicity of this system!

Here's my input:

Add MA Sabres by LuxAlgo (Free TradingView indicator) - The "MA Sabres" indicator highlights potential trend reversals based on a moving average direction. Detected reversals are accompanied by an extrapolated "Sabre" looking shape that can be used as support/resistance and as a source of breakouts.

The indicator will look for a change in direction after the MA went in the same direction during x consecutive bars (settings: "Reversal after x bars in the same direction"). Then a circle-shaped drawing will be drawn 1 bar back, at the previous high/low, dependable of the previous direction. From there originates a sabre-shaped figure where the tip lies as far as the user-set MA length.

Some of the founding fathers of this system, used indicators which was a representation of the mean of two MA's, like, TrendMagic, or HalfTrend.

I Found using HalfTrend, is better than an arbitrary "pullback". If HalfTrend is bullish, then one could equate this to price being above a set of MAs. (similar to 9, and 20) If a frowning sabre is produced WHILE the halftrend is bullish, AND price crosses it, this would trigger the entry. (see screen print)

This strategy is straightforward and reliable.

I have a range trading strategy for gold but wanted something trend-following.

And it works pretty well! (Of course you need to add some stuff to it...)

I trade it in volitilate crypto market, which is also trendy in 1m.

Hi Team,

I am new to this strategy.

I am just wondering how do I know when to enter my trade, is it when the line cross the trendline or do we need to wait for EMA?

Also for profit is there any range we take like 1:2 and how do we determine SL and TP?

Thanks again

Hello Bramking08.

In the first post you have all the necessary info to answer your questions. My recommendation is that you read the entire thread. Reading every page of this thread isn't a waste of time but an investment.

all setups need to conform on the bar close, but the trend line break anytime on the current bar. the previous bar mus satisfy all the conditions before the break.

Risk reward is dynamic, no such thing as 1:2 all the time. Start with 1:1 and feel free to adjust.

Hi @ swilliam

Where did you get the breakout edge scanner, and do you use that with your technique and just checking does the file support mt5 ? TIA

--- 帖子 #1599 ---
Hi guys, I'm just starting to use this system (my first time doing intraday trading of any sort!) really like it for its simplicity, just one question; when you're drawing your trendline from the 'most recent swing high', how far back do you tend to look for this swing high? I read earlier in the thread that drawing the trendline is left up to the individual's discretion but I'm just looking for a gauge on what other users are doing. I personally have been looking for the recent swing high since the 7EMA last crossed over the 20EMA, which in choppier markets can sometimes be quite recently and lead to a very steep trendline. Let me know if you've got any tips, cheers and happy scalping!

--- 帖子 #1601 ---

--- 帖子 #1602 ---
it depends, you will get a feel of it as you get used to the system. The drawing depends how the trendline looks. But in terms of how many bars back. I usually limit to 20 bars.

--- 帖子 #1603 ---
These trend lines are so subjective, can hardly call this a system as the trend lines which are integral to the system can’t not be replicated trade to trade

But you MA's were in the process of ordering nicely, so that would be an up signal. And a resistance is not necessarily the same as a bounce.

ATR Based Trendlines (TradingView)

This script draws trendlines from the pivot points in the price chart.

The angle of the trendlines is determined by (a percentage of) the atr.

The angle follows the change in price, dictated by the atr at the moment where the pivot point is detected.

The atr percentage determines if the trendline follows the rate of change of the atr or a fraction ( value < 100) or a multiple ( value > 100) of that

--- 帖子 #1705 ---
works fine here.

--- 帖子 #1706 ---
This system works well. The trend lines are quite arbitrary but the concept is very solid.

I'm really enjoying the daily candle and oscillator synergy. I also have been enjoying the simple 8-10 pip fixed TP/SL.

For a buy I use; Price is above the daily open, Oscillators are above 50, and a simple trend line is broken. Fixed 1:1

Currently 6W 1L, cheers

--- 帖子 #1707 ---
Don't complicate it

--- 帖子 #1708 ---
Thanks for sharing this. Keep sharing learning in the same way.

And my question is this .

"For buy we look for daily candle open is above in daily candle close"?.

" And for sell we look for daily candle open is below of closing"?.

And Tp/Sl 10 pips 1:1 RR ?.

"Thanks for help".

--- 帖子 #1716 ---
A nice, aggressive short I just took.

--- 帖子 #1717 ---
quick short on EURUSD

--- 帖子 #1718 ---
So - about the exit. There are multiple possibilities. I just want to share a scenario here. We can set a firm exit and then we most of the time see, that it went higher. I suggest - if we use MACD for entry, why not use it for exit too. There you have the possibility to let the profit run.

--- 帖子 #1719 ---
hmm - if you exited when 7EMA crossed below 21 EMA you would have had 37 pips in this case.

I have not made any backtest of these suggestions, just spotted it when I tried the strategy this night.

By the way I think lately the asian pairs have been doing some nice trends during the asian session. However I need to be on the screen from 1 am in the night to trade that. Damn I am sleepy there.
