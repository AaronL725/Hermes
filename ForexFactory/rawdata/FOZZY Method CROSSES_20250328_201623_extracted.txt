Would like to see if there is an interest in a daily posting of Fozzy Crosses each evening. I would be glad to help if there is any interest.....Or maybe there is already one. "Living the dream" Indreamer

--- 帖子 #2 ---
i'd be interested, technically it could happen in my daily fozzy trades, but it's not a bad idea for this thread

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Count me as interested. I'd like to see a list every evening of crosses, &amp; most especially to see a discussion of same! Shotshell

--- 帖子 #4 ---
I would also like to join this thread for discussion, etc.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Yes, it would be most helpful to see them. Thanks

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Count me in too.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
So let's get it done. Starting new day today in 6 hours

--- 帖子 #8 ---
No set-ups today. The eurcad looks overcooked to me but it's not a fozzy trade

--- 帖子 #9 ---
No setups for me either. Still in USDCAD from yesterday. 2xlots both up 30 pips. Looks like a lot of the YEN crosses may give some signals long tomorrow after their sudden drop yesterday but we will have to wait and see.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
i am interested too.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
What crosses do you look at with the fozzy method? I only look at the majors to begin with.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
No new trades for me today. There is cross on GBPUSD but it's very close and right on the tunnel. Given it's lack of direction as of late I skipped it.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
I took the short trade on the gpbusd and closed at 105 pips.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
No trades for me today. Hopefully the upcoming week should see some action.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
I'm long EUR/GBP

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Looks Like We Got A Cross On Fozzy Will Confirm Today At 5pmest For Me...looks Like A Long Move Waiting For Confirmation.....does Anyone Else See It.? Living The Dream

--- 帖子 #17 ---
i am using fxdd chart and mine could not see daily chart. i think something happened to their server. does anyone have the same problem with me?? cant see the signal today :-(

--- 帖子 #18 ---
No problem here.........

--- 帖子 #19 ---
I see it as a possibility....... .......won't know for sure until 5 PM EST.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Here it it is on mine. My Fozzy chart is getting polluted with indicators. Any suggestions?

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Refresh your charts, I had the same problem yesterday

--- 帖子 #22 ---
There is the cross and by its look it will be confirmed at 10pm GMT, the question is: do we take all the crosses irrespective of where RSI is sitting?

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Long, already +45 pips; I must admit , I anticipated the cross..

--- 帖子 #24 ---
That's not fair MissPippy

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Careful MissPiggy.......oops, I mean MissPippy......

--- 帖子 #26 ---
i got my chart back, thanks howard, i just know that we can re-fresh in mt4 :-)

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Long Usd/jpy at 116.82 Long Usd/chf at 1.2234 (initial trade stopped out on the lowest point last night (GMT+1), reentered position

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Finally i can post.. after looking at this forum for months and esp with fozzy method.. GBP/CHF -there was also a cross and went for long.. now up to 50 pips.. the cross in my broker for usd/jpy was a bit late.. i might take a long tomorrow when new bar or when the gap between the cross is high enough..

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hi MissPippy, I didn't get a cross on USD/JPY. It pays to confirm the cross before entering the trade. Cheers Fozzy

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Just the BUY on the EURCAD cross today for me. Hitting some near term resistance there but gave it some room to move with s/l at ydy low.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
We may have a cross at the end of today:

--- 帖子 #32 ---
You were right, unfortunately for me and I got stopped out.This daily system requiers more patience than I sometimes have.. I may reenter tonight if the cross occurs.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
a lot of cross today.. all of them are positive now.. i wasn't able to trade..

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Getting my ass kicked!!!! I entered all of these positions last night on IBFX MT4 Platform GMT time zone. Looks like I could go 0 for 8 on this round. Did anyone else enter these trades? If not since there were signals on all of them can you please let me know why you stayed out so I can make better decissions in the future? Was this just a fluke? I am going to start posting all of the crosses I see every night on this thread. Hopefully we can have descussion on the signals. Thanks Joe Already Stopped out. CHFJPY Sell 96.07 SL 9653 TP 95.73 Sell 96.07 SL 9653 TP 95.18 Sell 96.07 SL 9653 TP open EURJPY Sell 155.63 SL 156.53 TP 155.26 Sell 155.63 SL 156.53 TP 154.66 Sell 155.63 SL 156.53 TP open EURUSD Sell 1.3311 SL 1.3355 TP 1.3283 Sell 1.3311 SL 1.3355 TP 1.3268 Sell 1.3311 SL 1.3355 TP open USDJPY Sell 116.94 SL 117.64 TP 116.41 Sell 116.94 SL 117.64 TP 115.51 Sell 116.94 SL 117.64 TP open I also entered AUDUSE currently -23 pips GBPJPY currently -155 pips GBPUSD currently -3 pips NZDUSD currently -37 pips

--- 帖子 #35 ---
My Fozzy EA entered 6 trades. I closed a couple when I got home and saw the disaster unfolding. It does not look good for the few that are left. All the JPY pairs have already lost. I still have the NZDUSD trade open and the AUDUSD from the day before. It is a dark day. The good thing is that with this method I can start next week with hope. I think a key thing for me is too only take a few of the best setups. Certainly not 3 or 4 trades that depend on the JPY.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
You're not the only one! And yes, I consider this a "fluke". It has happened before and WILL happen again. However, when I compare what has happened this day with what has happened in the past, it's just a blip on the radar. I have had days when all the corelated pairs take off in the "right" direction resulting in a huge profit. I believe there are some Fozzy traders who limit their exposure by not taking all trades on a given day that include the same currency. That practice would have kept us out of all the JPY and AUD loosers today. (FYI: I don't like Fozzy trades on AUD pairs, don't know why, but they don't work out very well!?) But that sword has two edges. Win some, lose some...........

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Thanks for the reinforcement. It's probably my fault. In the past 2 years I have attempted to switch from Demo to live 3 times. Each time one of these Fluke situations has left me with loser’s right out of the gate. No worries though it was only penny’s. In the past this would have knocked me down and made me gun-shy. I'm going to take the next setups.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
anyone looking at this today?

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Trade today or wait until next week??? I'm leaning twards staying out until next week. Seems like this "Fluke" of a move might have run out of steam for the week. I'm still novice, what do you think? Possible crosses at today's close. EURGBP EURJPY USDJPY USDCAD GBPJPY CHFJPY AUDJPY AUDNZD NZDJPY

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Hey Shades. I'm not sure what your seeing? It doesnt appear this will cross. If it did I think it would be risky unless it breaks the tunnel first. http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&amp;d=1175198553

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Not for me. No cross as yet and seems to be lacking direction. Could drop because possible pin bar forming but hasn't got past the first fib after the tunnel for quite some time. EURGBP looks possible. Weak cross but with the trend. There are a few YEN crosses but they all conflict with my OSMA indicator. They were all pointing South yesterday and looked like sure winners. I reckon they will drop again shortly.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
I like the EUR/CAD...........all my indicators point up. It may take a few days to develop, but I believe it's headed that way. A more conservative approach would be to wait one more day...............but then I've never really been accused of being conservative............... PS..... USD/JPY..... EUR/GBP..... AUD/NZD.....

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Hi BB This pair did cross on my chart, but sitting on Vegas daily.. Any comments? thank you

--- 帖子 #44 ---
concur on all. use solar wind which tells same story. will not take eurgbp.. too weak a cross. so off to bed today after having had my ass whupped

--- 帖子 #45 ---
I don't like "back-to-back" signals! Look at the history of any pair and you will see that when this happens it's a crap shoot. I like some space and THEN a signal. (oops, did I just post something I haven't commented on before? I have to be a careful poker player and not show all my cards.......... )

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Thank you. A nice addition to " What will BB not do" file.. Listed in alphabetical order. Soon to be published by the Library of Congress. Feel free to release more clinically proven and confidential secrets. Thank you Thank you

--- 帖子 #47 ---
This will most likely happen as I get older, more forgetful and down-right senile. But when that REALLY kicks in, you know what to believe.......

--- 帖子 #48 ---
G'day Joe, With my limited trading experience in mind, I'll tell you why *I* didn't take that Fozzy trades. The fall in the yen pairs on the previous bar was the catalyst for those trades triggering. The fall was caused by news. The ranges on those bar were anywhere from 80-150 pips. Recalling previous news moves (and not necessarily the yens) there's almost always a retrace after a big move no matter what the direction. In previous weeks when similar scenarios occurred, the result was exactly as seen here - all pairs retraced hitting all SL's. JUst go back and see what happend a few weeks back when the Dow tumbled. Sure, fozzy trades were signalled but the WHY is the important bit here. As BB said, it's a fluke but it happens. If it'd been 2 or 3 pairs, I'd have been in there right along side ya. But ALL the yen pairs? Something's gotta be up. And, most importantly (and it's something I gotta drum into my thick skull), NOT being in a trade is a position as well. That's come up a lot over the last week or so for me. Mate, I hope this doesn't sound like preaching coz I'm in no position to do that - just ask my account balance! To me, it's stuff I've noticed and picked up along my short journey. Cheers, Art...

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Great post Art! I am going to take a "look back" because, I believe you must be right about the big move, retrace observation; this is definitely worth considering. I decided a long time ago I was not going to pay attention to fundamentals, and I still don't (with the exception of NFP); but I like the "technical" way you describe the Fozzy reaction to such events. Thanks again for sharing with us.....

--- 帖子 #50 ---
OK, I got hammered on this one! This HAS been a difficult Fozzy week. Fortunately I have had some success this week, but it HAS been a struggle. My EUR/GBP is doing well and should be able to recoup my loss on the EUR/CAD.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
misery for me to offload here too my eurgbp and usdcad were the only two trades that yielded me pips this week. next week is another day.. when i am down i read muhammed ali

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Art, Thanks for the great reply. I was very hesitant to enter the trades because of the huge range on the previous day's bars. I guess I was just trying to stay disciplined and follow the rules of the system. I should have followed my instincts. Don't worry about the preaching. I asked and you delivered great insite. Hopefully I've learned a lesson and won't let that happen again. Joe

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Beach, its too early to say, but quite a few forming crosses for next week will be against sw..would you ignore these?

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Fozzy people, I have found myself chasing recent posts all over the different Fozzy threads. I post in one, and get the response to my post in another one. I read one interesting post and when I go back to look for it i have to go through all the "fozzies" cause I forgot in which one was it. Here is my suggestion, can we limit our posts to one thread? In that way, all of us, that are following fozzy can be up to date in what is happening and not missing important coomentaries. I do not know if this is sacrilege....just a suggestion

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Chasing? Who's chasing?..................... I agree, it often seems that way. My suggestion: The original thread for posting technical information ONLY. Discuss "crosses" and trades here. And allow Art to discuss HIS trade activity in HIS thread with our posts being limited to observations that are appropriate or direct answers to HIS questions about what HE is doing? (afterall it IS Art's thread) How's that?.......

--- 帖子 #56 ---
I see four crosses for Sunday PM: EUR/USD, USD/CAD, EUR/CAD, AUD/NZD. EUR/USD has good potential AUD/NZD is a "GO" I don't like the others for various reasons. FXDD gives me an open at 4 PM EDT on Sunday. Unless something very unusual happens after the market opens, I'll trade these two.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Good to hear your thoughts BB.... To add my own - the USD/CAD looks more promising that the EUR/USD to me - U/C is with the trend (I use the 28EMA to help decide that) and can see more downside potential. Will be trading it with s/l at 70% ATR(20). It does have a kind of "back-to-back" signal though, as you mentioned above. More studying of that pattern is needed methinks! E/U has formed a nasty range and ended Friday with a spinning top. Would be interested to hear your reasons for it being a good trade to take.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
G'day all, On my charts (with data only til Friday) USDCAD and EURCAD aren't valid Fozzy crosses and don't even appear to likely cross. AUDNZD and EURUSD appear to be crosses but the A/N closed right up against the Vegas tunnel and the E/U does have the spinning top, but I like it's upward pressure. Still, with my dreaded Sunday candle imminent, I'm gonna pass on these trades unless they are clearly not affected by it. Cheers, Art...

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Hello Michael...... Nice to see you back here with fellow Fozzy traders. Right now it's still too early to decide what trades will work or not.......I'm in the EUR/USD and AUD/NZD. But it looks like the EUR/CAD may actually turn out better. (I'm also long on GBP/CHF, but that's NOT a Fozzy trade). Don't be a stranger!

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Anyone notice the EUR/USD possible buy forming today but its just seems to overall high already. Wondering what others think? Also, i have a question. Im making a list for myself on the factors to consider before committing to each trade so far ive got -did the willf cross occur? -weekly/monthly trend -any big news coming up within the week that could drastically affect price -range or trend -support/resistance levels -factor that caused signal (big news that day?), any chance for a strong retrace that would stop trade -range of price on day cross was triggered, the bigger they are the higher the chance of some retrace. These are just some of the things that I currently consider before pressing the trade button. What other factors do the more experienced and successful traders consider while performing "discretion" as it seems that the technicals of this system are hard to beat and the trick lay in picking the winners any feedback would be great Cheers, JMS

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Great question, JMS. Quite a few have posted their Fozzy variations, but true discretion is very hard to define, because ultimately it comes down to "feel", which is anathema to the true, mechanical trader (and also negative to the P&amp;L of most traders). For me, my discretion comes down to whether I like what I see on the chart or not. If all my personal filters say "Yes" to a trade, it is unusual that I will not take it. However, I will occasionally take a trade that does not conform : this Monday morning, there were a number of possible trades &amp; I felt uncomfortable with all except one, which barely fit any of my parameters : long GBPJPY. Nevertheless, something about the chart said "Buy", so I am long from 232.10 (first profit target at 232.89). Let's see. J.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
G'day JMS, Grea idea on the list. I have something similar, but I may have to put it clearly on paper and place it next to my screen. As previously stated, I think these last 2 are of primary importance. And, like you, I always consider overall trend but there are pips to be made in the shorter-term retrace crosses (2-5 days) of a trend. I think it's important not to expect to get 100+ pips on a bearish retrace of an overall bullish trend (and vice versa). Be happy with 20-40 pips, bank them and move on. If you look back at any chart you'll see small retraces happening all the time. And many of those times they are valid Fozzy crosses. Just my noob observations... Cheers, Art...

--- 帖子 #63 ---
G'day J, Excellent, excellent post. This is something I struggle with at times, and I'm sure most noobs do too. Some people wait until every checkbox is ticked. And sometimes the trade still goes against you. I think it's all about how familiar you are with the method you are trading and how that method has behaved historically. You have to know your system intimately, or the markets will own you. Cheers, Art...

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Sounds perfect to me. I will do exactly that

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Let me add my personal "Amen" to these comments! We cannot say enough about "faithfully" trading a system! ((jtrade: The GBP/JPY looks very good!))

--- 帖子 #66 ---
All of these are valid points but just make sure you don't talk yourself out of a potentially good trade. The market will do what it wants. All you can do is use fozzy (or any system) to gain an edge. Backtest your setup and see what results you get. You will probably see lots of potential but you never take into account a lot of the points you listed above. So why take them into account now?

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I am new to this fozzy system and i would like to know if there is a valid cross on UCAD today and if anyone else is going to trade it. I would really appreciate if someone can shed some light on this USD/CAD trade

--- 帖子 #68 ---
The usd/cad cross does look possible and according to the rules, crossing up under the middle of the bollinger. If the cross is confirmed at 0:00 GMT I'll be in it.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
G'day all, With still a few hours til end of bar (on IBFX at least) the USDCAD and EURCAD appear to be possible LONG Fozzy trades, if the crosses remain. Cheers, Art...

--- 帖子 #70 ---
thanks everyon for the insight it was helpful intrying to get "into" the flow of trading. cheers, jms P.S is anyone else using the demo on metatrader through Mig-Fx, i think im getting the dreaded sunday bar.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Hi all, Can anyone confirm - it seems like a lot of crosses happened and not a lot of discussion (I'm on FXDD): Willf Approved: - Short USDCHF - Short EURGBP - Long EURJPY - Long GBPJPY Strict Fozzy: - Short USDCHF - Long USDCAD - Long EURCAD - Short CADJPY Not sure if I'm seeing things... Also I choose not to include AUDUSD since it's at such a high point and the last candle was 100 pips in height even though the ATR(10) is 63 (a little discretion here vs. the above I looked at). Thanks!

--- 帖子 #72 ---
My first time with fozzy and i took UCAD long lets see how it goes

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Willf approved - I think I will be the judge of that Short USDCHF No cross on my platform. Short EURGBP This cross happened 2 bars previous - but I was long from the bar 3 days previous. Long EURJPY This cross happened 3 bars previous. Long GBPJPY This cross happened 3 bars previous. Correct on AUDUSD. Too high for my liking at the moment.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
I have searched from all the fozzy threads as much as i could but i have still not been able to read all the 200+ pages so if anyone here could answer my question i would really appreciate it... What is the TP method people here are using for fozzy can anyone guide me to one or few of them? Also i have a UCAD long now does anyone else have this and what is their TP for this long? Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #75 ---
This is NOT one of the better Fozzy performers; however, I think this trade will pay out eventually. But it may take days, be patient. First t/p = 35, second t/p = 70, third one with trailing stop. HTH!

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Thanks From this answer i have got another question if you dont mind answering. Which pairs did you find are good performers for daily fozzy method.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
.......................................

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Okay - I deserved that one. Didn't mean to sound pretentious - was shorter than writing "From what I believe and understand from willf's variation..." Willf - from what I've read, you seem pretty good natured so hopefully no offense was taken. Thanks for your input. My demo IBFX seems to still show valid crosses (for today's trades) on the ones you identified as crosses on earlier bars. I have to re-install mt4 for my live IBFX account but besides that still seems okay (from what I believe and understand....) - hmmm, wierd.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Sorry jaree, I'm not going to try and answer this question because my opinion of the best pairs to Fozzy trade might send you down the wrong path. Research and experience will tell you what works best for you and your trading style; there's no substitute for that. Be patient, take your time and develop your own Fozzy based method. (CAD/JPY has earned me the most Fozzy pips).

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Well, I'm trailed out of this trade for +79 +215 +239 for +533 on the 3-lot trade, which is not too shabby for a couple of days work... and yet... I am looking at my screen thinking " This chart is still long !" . Maybe this pair will now reverse; maybe it will go another few hundred pips, but the message to me is clear : the whole point of trading 3 lots, which I do with all forex trading (account-size permitting) is to let that last contract run. You can't do this unless you give it a LOT of room, ie. are willing to endure a lot of giveback on the trade. I am going to study this more, because surfing the really big trades is something I defintely want to do. Food for thought . J.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
I understand your point Thanks for your time.... Also my Long on UCAD doing pretty good but still 20 pips away from the target lets see

--- 帖子 #82 ---
No offence taken. Was just messing with ya

--- 帖子 #83 ---
cadjpy bit me on the ass yesterday..anyway you take it as you get it

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Looking at these crosses for tonight.. e/u short - valid or too far gone? g/u short a/u short n/u short Looks like an interesting day for Fozzy

--- 帖子 #85 ---
AUD/USD and NZD/USD seems like they have a cross. Anyone going to take these.... Any other valid daily fozzy crosses today? EDIT: AUD interest rate statement today and i see SAR dot that might prevent a bearish candle to give few pips even though tommorow is going to be a dollar day but i will stay out of this pair today as there is still a chance that interest rate might be increased.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
I took all the crosses I mentioned previously. Wish me luck

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Each of these are a USD sell (correlated?), always a little risky. But IMO you should do all right.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
anyone notice the NZD/USD, shows buy, but lines seem to close, and solarwind indicates stalling uptrend. im sitting out. i just started using solarwind after reading more about it in the other forum is it a reliable trend indicator to be used for confirmation? cheers, jms

--- 帖子 #89 ---
I am short on NZD/USD and up about 40 pips. I went in @ .7214. It seems their is a high correlation between the Kiwi and the AUD currency so when they did not raise rates tonight and both currencies had made very recent highs, I now think it is due for a dive down to at least .7145. IMO

--- 帖子 #90 ---
i agree, i think that the aussie currencies are coming off the strong upward trend and are either gonna hold or start to sink, hopefully in your favor. cheers jms

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Looks like EU has a cross today... Anyone taking this? Any thoughts or comments about EU long.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
i didnt show a cross, and to me it seems that it has been ranging lately. i did not go in, because no signal generated. jms

--- 帖子 #93 ---
I did not trade that either even though cross did happen on my charts(New candle forms after NY close i believe 0:0GMT) but it was not a very clear cross so i avoided it

--- 帖子 #94 ---
I see following crosses forming EUR/AUD USD/CHF GBP/USD Is anyone else going to trade fozzy today since it is major news Friday with NFP and a holiday at same time so for those who are experienced in this fozzy method what do you guys say is it safe to trade in such situation? How has fozzy done in past during NFP week?

--- 帖子 #95 ---
you can name your broker and then probably someone can tell you what timezone your new candles form. If you'r IBFX client than you're right, it's GMT.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
I know mine is in GMT BTW i use Northfinance

--- 帖子 #97 ---
They aren't GMT. Northfinance is GMT+2

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Are they +2 or +3 on summer time?

--- 帖子 #99 ---
+2 on summertime.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
i am looking closely at the USD/CHF. i think its probably gonna continue downwards at least a little bit, unless the news employment news is good then it will rise. The forecast is rising so probably should stay out of it. pass USD/GBP if the news is good will produce downward pressure, but if its bad it will not. It all depends on how you think the news will affect the price. Good Friday will lessen trading but strong news will have alot of people on. pass EUR/AUD seems like a better bet because no major news 2morrow, and based on solarwind is coming down off a long downward trend and is ready to cycle up a bit. it has previously broken strong above the tunnel so it could happen again. I am probably gonna take this position for long. NOTE: this was not a willf cross, long signal beneath the 50 line looking back, maybe i think to much and should just trade, but so is the life of a econ major. cheers, jms

--- 帖子 #101 ---
I often find that after NFP there are a lot of crosses to trade on the Sunday/Monday. I often find these don't work out. Pay attention if the pair was already trending in the direction before NFP. The news can speed up a cross if this is the case. Or give a whipshaw if it wasn't. Personally I sit out during holidays. Generally little volume gives false signals and a market with little movement. But NFP on the Friday may shake things up a bit.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
G'day all, I have the following 3 potential fozzy trades: GBPUSD Short - I won't take this today because of upcoming news (I'd rather wait til next week and see how things develop) EURAUD Long - I will take this but with a tighter SL and only looking for a small win (~20 or so pips) AUDCAD Short - I will take this but with a tighter SL and again only looking for a small win. I don't follow the swissy pairs atm. Also, I'm in EU long since yesterday and banked one lot of pips. I'll be watching NFP tonight hoping for some USD -ve news to lock in some more. If it doesn't happen and I get stopped, so be it. My SL is currently at 1.3411. Cheers, Art...

--- 帖子 #103 ---
I am in long EUR/AUD too but very disappointed by the 10 pip spread lets see if it can cover the spread

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Waiting on NFP tomorrow before I make any moves, however if it comes in strong both AUD and EUR more than likely will take a quick nose dive for 50-75 pips. Also, I have noticed on the EUR/AUD that when the AUD dollar moves you usually get 2 pips in that direction so a 50 point drop may equate to 80-100 move up with the EUR/AUD so you may get lucky. Doesn't seem like anything is going on tonight though...really slow.

I am in Also anyone going to trade or see any potential crosses today

--- 帖子 #107 ---
There are possibilities but since it's a holiday market I'm not going to trust them

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Well holidays are now over i guess Monday is the last day Anyway i see a potential cross on GJ and CHF/JPY anyone going to take it ?

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Pretty bad start of the week with a SL hit on USDCAD I see lot of USD pairs crosses forming tomorrow and i am wondering if anyone is going to take them all

--- 帖子 #110 ---
I hit the cad s/l too. Who could have predicted the anti USD moves in Asia last night? As for new crosses today, we will have to wait and see how the market settles post holiday to see what is possible and what is not. The market at the moment is giving me grey hairs lol.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Woke up to see my GJ hit the SL too prob all the US pairs will have a cross today but i dont know if it would be good to trade those or not.... Can anyone else shed some light on the charts and how stuff look like? Anyone going to take all of them?

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Does anyone here even like to share anything? I mean where is everyone? No fozzy trader here or what?

--- 帖子 #113 ---
About the only cross I see that may make some pips is USDCHF short but it's not great. My broker still has a couple of hours to go before a new candle so I won't know until then. Everything else seems to be overbought, oversold or stuck in a range.

Thanks for replying How about EUR/CHF short that one looks nice to me USD/CHF daily is right on vegas tunnel isnt that pretty dangerous

--- 帖子 #115 ---
EURCHF is too high. I only take short crosses beneath the 50 RSI and long crosses above the 50 RSI I don't consider the tunnel as dangerous. I have backtested this and sure it can stall at the tunnel but it can stall at any fib line as well.

jaree............. Your question will not win any friends. There is a tremendous amount of Fozzy trading info in this sub-forum; and it's here because many of us have not only been willing to share but also to use our time for sharing. That time COULD have been used elsewhere. Suggestion: Use your time to learn as much as possible about Fozzy trading. Don't be so concerned about individual trades or what's happening today, but rather concern yourself with learning the method so you can be comfortable and successful. I have just started doing something new with what I call "The 4 Hour Fozzy" and will be posting some observations and ideas that I hope will be useful. But I don't think it's realistic to expect a lot of daily posts about day-trading. Back and forward testing (as well as a measure of patience) will help you much better in the long run. All the best....

--- 帖子 #117 ---
I understand that and i have read every single post related to fozzy and i am comfortable with the system but i was just wondering where everyone is at i mean it was only me who was posting on this thread so thats why i just asked that I know posting is time consuming but i thought that was this thread made for to share the knowledge of crosses and what others think about it Anyway thanks for your time and suggestion and i am waiting for your update on 4 hour fozzy

--- 帖子 #118 ---
I think once you have settled upon a setup that suits you it's very difficult and time consuming to explain the reasoning behind your trades. I don't usually even know what my next trade will be until about 9.50GMT, 10 mins before by broker forms a new candle.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Excellent explanation................thanks!

I took GBP/USD long USD/CHF short and EUR/CHF short lets see what happens

--- 帖子 #121 ---
I have been reading this post for a while and I do like the fozzy crosses. But looking at what happened yesterday around 10 pm ET when the EURUSD rocketed up makes me just shake my head. I mean can someone exlpain to me what happened exactly?the nf news were supposed to boost the usd, the asia market is usd biased. checked the forex factoy calendar and there was BOJ news with "tentative' beside it. but tsomething was telling me not go short. so I didnt. but still was amazed at how the market changed. I just googled now and found out BOJ is keeping interest rates without change. now was that move fundimental or technical? and how do u act since there are news everyday? I know that I have many questions, but I really want to learn. I was on demofor more than a year. went live since last month. blew up 30% of my account ( it was small acount though) I still want to learn, I read many books and articles to learn, but htink I still have a long way to . Need advice please

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Well I don't really follow fundamentals but I would say that after NFP the USD pairs had a good move. Then there was an Easter break during which the US announced it was pissed with China and filed complaints with the world trade organiszation. This sparked a big move in Asia, hence the sudden reversal of the USD. The BOJ news was as expected and just reinforced peoples expectations that YEN carry trade would continue as it did. I don't think the BOJ decision had any real affect on the dollar overall. Personally I don't pay much attention to fundamentals. I look at my chart and decide from that. Sometimes trades workout, sometimes they don't. It's that simple. Fozzy (or any system) just gives you an edge. Have you seriously backtested your system. I found this an excellent way of confirming that my setup works. You will be surprised at how many times your 'edge' is correct and you beat the market without considering fundamental news. I don't know what books youv'e read but one I would highly recommend is 'Trading In The Zone' by Mark Douglas.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
It would appear that there is a very nice cross today on the Eur/Chf pair. I have sold at 1.6346. Hope it works out! Any thoughts by others here would give me more confidence (I hope- depends on the comment! Ha) . It's been a little tough lately. I've attached my chart. Shotshell

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Thanks willf, I read good review about 'Trading In The Zone' by Mark Douglas and this is going to be my next read soon

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Hello Forexoxo....... I agree with willf: a "technical" system is just that, it's technical and can sometimes give a signal that does NOT generate a profit. But the good thing about the Fozzy method is that in it's purest form, it IS profitable. Good MM and RR along with a conservative approach will get you good results. Personally the ONLY news I pay any attention to is NFP and the day afterwards. Otherwise, for me, it's "technical" Fozzy, day in and day out.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Got stopped out on EUR/GBP too Pretty bad week for fozzy unfortunately

--- 帖子 #127 ---
if no one took this trade yesterday, may i know reasons

--- 帖子 #128 ---
I took it, and lost. Looked a good setup. Good cross, above the 50 and with the trend. Came within 4 pips of my TP and reversed.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Willf, Are you using a % of ATR as TP, and do you two or more lots and scale out or just one? MikeC

--- 帖子 #130 ---
I use the vegas daily fibs as TP levels. I place two trades. Once the first one is hit the trade is moved to breakeven and the second lot left to hit the second TP. I initially set my SL with 70% of an ATR(20). Assuming the trade goes my way and exceeds my breakeven I trail my position with the ATR stop adjusting daily.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
anyone game enough to short the AUD today? Fozzy alert! might be good for about 20 pips!!

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Hey Trump, I dont have a vaild cross yet, are you trading the original fozzy?

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Keep an eye on EUR/AUD for tomorrow. Presently, their is a cross, however a small drop will negate this, but if the Euro presses on strong and the AUD has small correction then you may get some pips out of this pair.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Hi Jese, I'm using IBFX, after yesterday's BEB, my daily fozzy indicator gave me a signal to sell on today's open. I entered using original Fozzy. Demo trade, reward:risk not so high as trade is counter to the trend. Maybe a pullback to the 6EMA.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Hi Trump, Im trading with MT4 and i didnt get the cross. Im not to sure why not.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
I did not get that cross either. What settings are you using?

--- 帖子 #137 ---
hmm I'm using the Fozzy indicator that was posted on here somewhere, maybe it was wrong?

--- 帖子 #138 ---
anyone?

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Did anyone take AUD/JPY cross... It looks interesting I took it but i dont know what should i put as stop loss since the previous candle high is not very far and it can take me out in matter of minutes if i put that SL. Can anyone suggest what should appropriate SL should be in this case. Also did anyone else take this short?

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Yes I took the GBPCHF. Unusual for me, not the usual willf fozzy setup. Lets see what happens

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Not for me. Todays bar has retraced too much for me. If I was going to place a stop (had I traded it) it would be 100.00. Thats 70% of a ATR20.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #143 ---
My Fozzy indicator is showing a short on the GBP/JPY for today. Anyone else have this? Can't seem to upload anything right now...

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Hi Trump, i have this signal on my charts. I wont enter till the new open tomorrow. I have entered a few trades this week on the JPY. 17/4/07 - USDJPY - still open @ +60 (short) 17/4/07 - EURJYP - still open @ +39 (short) 17/4/07 - CADJYP - still open @ +28 (short) 19/4/07 - EURAUD - still open @ +51 (short) I will move my stops tomorrow's new open.

my tps hit.. atlast a winning trade..took no other trade this week other than the bombed eurcad.. water to a parched throat

Anyone planning to take any of these today AUD/USD short cross NZD/USD short cross GBP/JPY short cross GBP/USD short cross against a very major trend thats why i am very hesitant to take this or GBP/JPY even AUD/USD is against trend too but valid fozzy crosses Just noticed a UCAD cross too

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Apart from GBPUSD they have all retraced quite a lot. The GBPUSD looks the better of the bunch but a weak cross. Having said that there were several trades yesterday that retraced through the day but made good pips today so you never can tell. My broker has a hour before a new candle so I will make my mind up then.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
I'm taking ALL of them.....cautiously. Already in the USD/CAD, using my 4 hour Fozzy method described here :

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Crosses with GBP seems too risky to me... Planning to take UCAD and AUD/USD lets see how that goes... Still have about half an hour and UCAD might uncross back again

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Going to take the NZD/USD cross and maybe the USD/CAD. AUD has some new releases this evening so I am going to stay away from that pair, even though they do not seem to significant.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Time of the day and i entered GBP/JPY short UCAD long and NZD/USD short lets see how many pips i get out of it Goodluck to everyone

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Hi Trumpcard Yes im using the original fozzy methord. As for today's crosses as posted by Jaree, i have entered on all of them. Take care.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
NZD Visitor Data came in poorly @ -0.1. Hopefully this will help the shorts...

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Didnt move the market at all not even a pip Lets see what it does later.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
All going negative except for GJ which looks like a bouncer too :o

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Its still early in the day jaree, Im in the negatives as well, but the trades are not near my stop loss, so im not too worried. Ill just stick to the original fozzy and let time take its course. Best peice of advise, turn your sceen off and let the system ride its self.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
wouldnt normally entertain this short since its back to back.. but its with the trend.. so intriguing.. any folks have any opinion?

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Personally it looks well oversold so I am going to give it a miss.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Decided to take the USDCAD in the end. RSI says it's oversold but then again it was saying that 10 days ago. There was also a signal on EURGBP but this pair seems real flat with no kinda direction.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Did anyone else took GBP/CHF short cross. I did for some reason even though i really wanted to avoid looking at the past fozzy signals on that pair... Lets see Any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Short? I had a long cross but very weak so stayed out. Different broker time I guess.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
I thought you had northfinance too Well there was a cross for long yesterday but today i see a short cross and new candle formed

--- 帖子 #164 ---
I dumped Northfinance after they changed their trading times and had an annoying Sunday bar. Now using FXDD.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Do you think that sunday bar mess up some indicators or is it good to have sunday candle for indicators. I tried to look for the answer on my charts but its just too complicated. What do you think? Also i have another question for you if you dont mind answering You said you will take a trade after it cross RSI 50 line... Suppose you get long signal from RSI crossing MA but its under RSI 50 you wont take the trade but after like a day or two price continue to move in right direction of the cross and then it cross RSI 50 too will you enter that trade? and what time as soon as it cross RSI 50 or with new daily. Any help would be appreciated

--- 帖子 #166 ---
The Sunday bar will give some false signals but you can easily spot them and work around it. My main gripe was that it through off the ATR. I use 70% of a 20 period ATR as a stop. With an extra two hour bar on Sundays it skewed the totals. You end up with 3x 2 hours bars with low volatility in a period of 20 days. Once the RSI has crossed the MA if it isn't above/below the 50 level I allow one extra day. I would enter at the end of the day as usual.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
EUR/CAD cross anyone? That strong bullish move might be because of canadas interest rate that came today USD/CAD EUR/AUD Anyone taking any of the above or any other cross ?

I am new to Forex factory and the Forex. I would be interested in joining the Fozzy evening discussion group. What is the proceedure please ?

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Hi maric.................I've been here since the early days of Fozzy trading, and I'm not aware of any "Fozzy evening group discussion".... Where did you get this idea?

--- 帖子 #172 ---
NO...............as explained in the other thread, I sometimes use the 4 hour chart for an early signal and entry. It's all spelled out in a series of posts.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
bet you are in the cadjpy based on 4 hr..

Absolutely................it booked 40 pips for me before the down-turn.

PLease count me in.

In what?

--- 帖子 #177 ---
I am thinking of moving to IBFX for few reason. Does anyone here use fozzy on IBFX and what is their timing and do they have sunday bar if anyone know

--- 帖子 #178 ---
G'day Jaree, I use IBFX with the Fozzy EA. I am quite happy with the performance thus far (about 2 months or so) but that Sunday bar is a pain in the arse! You pretty much have to delete it manually and base you trades for Monday without it otherwise you WILL get false signals. After Tuesday though it plays no real part. Cheers, Art...

--- 帖子 #179 ---
I dont think so, it might give u some chance to win as well. no one can really tell the next signal gonna be a right or wrong one.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
G'day feeder, Obviously this is the case. But how many trades have you entered where the Sunday bar was the cause of the cross (because without that bar there there was NO cross) and had that trade go against you? Me, I think I've documented a few during the first couple of weeks of trading. I now don't trade Mondays unless I think it looks promising in spite of the Sunday bar. My point was that the Sunday bar can and HAS caused false Fozzy signals to be triggered. I'm not in this to leave trading decisions to chance. Cheers, Art...

--- 帖子 #181 ---
I found that EA 2.2 put the trigger even we see no cross at all.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Not in my experience. I can safely say that I have never had a trade triggered where there wasn't a cross. I've had few that were borderline above/below the mid RSI, but there has always been a cross. Remember, the cross matters when the new candle opens. After a few hours it may retrace to a point whereby there is no longer a cross, but at 00:00GMT there would've been a cross. Cheers, Art...

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Thank you Artamon

Anyone taking GBPCHF long at the close of today's candle? As of now, RSI is 66 and MA of RSI is 56.

Hello Brunite..............you must be new around here........... Lurking off to the side somewhere, the 'regulars' are waiting for me to send you back to read my previous posts where I have answered these two questions on more than one occasion..........

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Hey......no sweat! Yes....I am relatively new here. Have been frequenting other forums as well. I'm not looking to be spoon-fed. I've spent over 500 hours chart watching and studying Forex since Jan 1. I'll have no problem wading through all the posts here either. I was just asking that specific question since the issue too much pair-correlation was one that I had problems with in my trading so far. However; I can respect your reply as I've seen too many folks wanting the "holy-grail" handed to them......not the case with me. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Possible 4 hour Fozzy coming up on GPB/USD and USD/JPY which I am short on at the moment.. Just a heads up to all.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
anyone.. fozzy candle is pretty strong..

--- 帖子 #193 ---
cool...................this is a classic example of a Fozzy signal on the Daily chart being generated by a very large price move AGAINST the daily trend. BE CAREFUL! This is also a good example of how to use these movements and the 4 Hour Fozzy method to get into a very good trade..............see the attached screenshot. I have said I will explain this further in the 4 Hour thread, but 'shame on me' because I haven't. I promise to try to get to that in the next few days. In the meantime, take a look at what can be done. (This trade helped me get back some of my loss on the GBP/USD today.)

i enterd gbpusd long -36 and usdjpy short -41 i am just want to ask why is my first trades must be in loss?

--- 帖子 #206 ---
sourour............. You didn't ask me, but I will offer an answer anyway: When starting with a new method, do you expect every trade to be a 'winner'? How did you choose the GBP/USD stop loss? Only 36 on this pair? Have you read about the preferred method for selecting Daily Fozzy stop losses? Why did you short the USD/JPY? I don't have a Fozzy signal on my chart! You might want to read the excellent e-book we have in another thread in this sub-forum and then apply "the rules" to this trading strategy.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
usd/chf sell +4 pips usd/cad sell +11 pips gbp/jpy buy +20 pips eur/aud buy +28 pips eur/cad sell still open aud/cad sell +11 pips I closed all of the above out last night and woke up this morning wishing I had not. The Ozzy pairs are up huge...... I know I am playing it too cautiously, but I think that is because I am building up my trust in Fozzy...(really it is trust in me....but don't tell me that). So far this system is going well. My win ratio would be less if I held on to my trades but my pips and profit would be much much more.... Edit : My SL's are all at above/below the previous days high/low. This for me can be very scary with a SL at 50 - 80 pips. Any thoughts on a better way to do this. Edit Edit : I am up 436 pips since 5/3/2007 to 5/16/2007 not bad for my first few weeks with Fozzy. (using micro lots...average lot being $0.093 per lot...soon to be $0.93 per lot...then $9.30 per lot)

'Back-to-back' signals are fraught with danger! Caution based on experience along with a dose of discretion is required. However........I still don't have a 'sell' on my chart, probably because we are using different indicators and/or different brokers.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
hi sir would u please tell me what was your stop for GBP/CHF ?? thanks

--- 帖子 #225 ---
billser..............I've enjoyed following your Fozzy trading activity. So, here are a few observations about T/P and MM. The Fozzy method will eat you alive if you don't have a solid Risk/Reward plan along with good basic money management. Successful Fozzy trading requires deep stop losses because you are trading on a Daily chart, and if you don't have profit targets that match the stops...............well, that's when the small gains will disappear quickly with one losing trade. IMO you need at least an R/R of 1:1, preferably better; and it doesn't matter if you are using one lot or five per trade, the math should remain constant. If you're trading the GBP/USD, and your S/L is 80, you MUST plan for a T/P of at least 80! That doesn't mean you can't move to B/E when the trade is 40 or 50 in profit. In fact, that's the way I prefer to trade it. Just be sure you protect yourself.......and allow the trades to run for maximum profit; in some cases that can hundreds of pips per trade. HTH!

--- 帖子 #226 ---
2.4078 was my SL on GBP/CHF

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Hi BeachBum, I completely understand what you are saying and I thank you for it. My first trade with Fozzy was on May 3rd 2007 and I had placed 2 trades one of which was EUR/AUD. L ess than 30 minutes into the trade my stop loss was whacked out of the ball park for a loss of 90 pips. The other trade was EUR/JPY with a profit (ha) of 9 pips. Leaving my excitement about gaining pips to one side, I do know that I have a long way to go before I perfect the Fozzy method. 1. Getting in has now become second nature. 2. Putting the SL where it is supposed to be I have become comfortable with. 3. The TP is my next challenge and my thoughts are this. I place a trade at the beginning of the candle. I take 50% off the table to satisfy my inner nervousness. I leave the other half to run its coarse with the SL moved to BE or a few pips above BE. The forex factory has been the greatest place to find for learning systems and having amazing support from folks such as you. Thanks. Billser

--- 帖子 #228 ---
billser, I recall BB mentioning somewhere he avoids AUD because of his experience with this currency. I am sure BB can comment on that if I am mistaken.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
I am very cautious when trading any AUD pair...........but I will trade them........

--- 帖子 #230 ---
I've never posted before, so I hope it works. 16 trades this week with 12 winners using the Fozzy method. +363 pips. Thanks Fozzy!!

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Well done, thats great work. Are you using the original Daily or a combo of the 4 hour Fozzy and Daily.......and what SL and TP do you work with...thanks Keep it up. EDIT: Where is Fozzy these days...anyone know ?????

I went over my trades this morning to figure out what I could be doing to improve my pips and $ per pip ratio Answer.........STAY IN LONGER......

Anyone up for fozzy chat realtime every evening? I have a free to all chatroom on my site and I think it would really help us all find the signals together and for the fozzy noobs (like myself hehe) to learn how to take advantage of the system better. Like, I took the chf/jpy signal which I later found out to be wrong (Trail stopped out at +1 though). I would have liked to be warned that it wasn't a good fozzy trade by more experienced fozzy traders. I doubt it if I'm allowed to post the link to the chatroom here without getting trouble so if you want to join in, please check out my profile, go to my homepage and chose chat from the menu. I look forward to talking fozzy with you guys.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
I've used just the daily charts and I set my SL and TP at 70% of the ATR(20). Sometimes I close the trades out early to lock in profits.

Thanks for the encouragement...... Dam I hate the weekends now.....

--- 帖子 #237 ---
billser, very nice end pip result!!! I hope you don't mind the couple comments below. They are meant to be constructive and thought provoking. I looked at a couple of the loser you had. For example EUR/AUD. If you look at the Fozzy cross the lines were running almost parallel. This resulted in 3 crosses on the Daily in 3 days. (reference 5/3, 5/4, 5/7) The fact that the 1st cross was shallow would have alerted me to beware, 2nd cross could have been ruled out using a stoch 5,3,3 or perhaps another confirming indicator, and the last would be a valid and profitable trade (I couldn't find the short on your list). What is AWESOME regarding your log is that it shows you don't have to make a lot of pips on every trade. You ended two weeks with over 500 pips. TOTALLY COOL. Prov

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Thank you for your comments and suggestions. I see what you are saying about the stoch for comfirmation.. Have a great weekend

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Billser, nice trades! I have a question though. On trades like 5/7, AUDUSD, on my charts (Alpari UK), I don't have an RSI cross at the end of 5/7, but only at the end of 5/8. Ditto for GBPCHF, and most of your other trades (on that day at least). So my question is, is it just a data feed difference--I mean, do you have a clear cross, or are you just trading at the touch of the lines? My dailies start at 6PM ET (GMT+1), and my broker does not have a Sunday bar.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
pd, by this " look at the Fozzy cross the lines were running almost parallel." do you mean rsi and ma were running parallell or something else?

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Hey guys and gals How are you all??? i have been following this thread with much interest but am slightly confused(it doesn't take much!!) some of the results posted are truly excellent ...but i'm having a hard time deciphering what the final setup is for the fozzy method and what filters or confirming indicators are being used.. Does any one have a setup template or perhaps you could point me in the right direction . btw bilser excellent job ...quick question but do you set em and forget em or are you glued to you screen ...how do you operate the method any help greatly appreciated cheers Rye

--- 帖子 #242 ---
The below link is my set up using the Dynamic zone indicator. I use interbankfx that has the sunday candle. I do exactly as Foozy says. Take the cross below the middle BB on a long, above for shorts. I too did notice (after the fact) that some of my trades where taken just as it was crossing as you mentioned above. The weird thing is that when i took the trade initially the cross was definately there. I also notice that when I place the trade at 5.00pm west coast time the trade tends to go against me for 20-30 pips then back in my direction. So I'm wondering if the thing repaints. When I look through the charts for the next days trades I see that the above mentioned trades are only now due for trading according to the Fozzy cross. So in conclution, maybe on some of these trades the Pip Gods where looking after me or maybe I just had beginners luck.... http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...postcount=2077 EDIT: I tend to set my trades and forget them....However I do have my laptop close at hand as I'm watching the idiot box just incase there is a big move either way and I get chicken and decide to bug out...

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Fozzy is around, although he is very selective about posting; but if you are very observant you will see his tracks................

--- 帖子 #244 ---
you got it. The cross angle was shallow.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
did the cross occur on the 17th or on the 18th? any ideas?

--- 帖子 #246 ---
I went short on 15 May and got stopped out; short again on 17 May. I have recovered my loss and have a small profit. Caution is the key word right now on this pair.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
EUR/CHF +1 EUR/JPY +1 Did anyone else take these two crosses....I bugged out this morning because they are not really doing that much

--- 帖子 #248 ---
yes, I did. You must learn patience. These trades need at least a day to develop, most of the time, longer. Set your stops and then forget about the trade until when you prepare for the next days trades.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Hey Billser I took eur/chf last night ,hasn,t done much back &amp; forth most of day then in last two hours am up 32 pips (*2 lots) the weekly 14,33/5,3,3 k % stoch has rolled over so thats a good sign for me wiil ride out see where it goes but will bring stop to b/e at close of todays candle. eur/jpy hasn't crossed for me yet but maybe soon... also took aud/usd which although hasnt crossed yet has a nice momentum building on stoch cross thingy again +10 so far bit unsure on gbp/usd 'looks' like a cross up but all momo is down so not expecting too much may be more convinced if we get 4hr croo today aswell anythoughts .......anyone Rye

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Hi Rye, Can you post a chart of the eur/chf so I can see what your stochs look like. I don't see them roll over for me on my charts.... Thanks

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Hey Bilser i,m fairly new to this forum stuff so i dont have a screen grab software or do i know how too post it if i did....sorry However i use a standard 5,3,3 (k% line only) overlaid with a 14,3,3 k% line. The 14 ,3,3 gives me a higher timeframe than d1 and when the two rise or fall (and this is the important bit - T-O-G-E-T-H-E-R ) then i have both the week and the day on my side. there is a chart of the setup somewhere - stay with me i'll try to find it !! Rye

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Found it !! have a look at 4hr fozzy thread posts #96-#104ish Howard very kindly posted a chart to explain what i was babbling on about.... let me know if i can be any help!!!! Rye

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Hi all Fozzyers, Just spent the last week reading all the posts in this amazing series of threads, absolutely fabulous work everyone. Truly inspirational. I'm demoing one version of 'the fozzy rules' and would like to clarify one thing: Fozzy´s original rules (post #1) look to enter a long when the cross is BELOW the central BB. And Wilf (post #1459) looks to enter a long when the cross is ABOVE the 50% line. More often than not these would seem to be conflicting, no? Or does it just all average put in the end? Any thoughts? Initial results look promising, although cable going totally the wrong way for me right now. Great stuff all, thanks so much for the superb contributions. El Choco Oops, just realised this was in the wrong fozzy forum. Great start.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
I took EURJPY and it is currently -15 pips. However, I also took AUDNZD (-22) and GBPJPY (+56). So overall, I am +19 pips on last night's trades and they are all still open. On my charts, the GBPJPY setup was almost identical to EURJPY, so I took them both. I did not have a cross on EURCHF. It looks as though I will get a negative cross on EURCHF when I get a new bar in a few minutes, but I won't take that trade even if the cross occurs.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Was their a EUR/JPY cross yesterday? I did not see one.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
I shorted AUDUSD 2 days ago and it is currently +42. As for GBPUSD, it looks like it might cross when I get a new bar in a few minutes but even if it does, I will not take the trade.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
It will depend on your charting provider. I use FXDD charts and this was my EURJPY setup.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
The Willf version is nothing to do with Bollinger bands. I don't use them. The 50 level is just the middle of the RSI indicator.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
How wide was your SL on this trade? On my charts GBPUSD opened the day @ 1.9745 and never got lower than 1.9714 (-31 pips).

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Not wide enough . It was @ 1.9717.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Well, everyone needs to have a personal strategy for setting SLs that suits their trading style. But IMHO, 28 pips is a very tight SL when trading GBPUSD on daily charts. I am currently showing an ATR for GBPUSD of 108. According to my research in this thread: http://forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=27335 there is a 52.3% on any given day that GBPUSD will retrace by 28 pips before reversing course and heading in its true direction for the day.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Even though I do not like it so much I place my stop lose at the previous days high/low plus about 5 extra pips just incase.....It paid off on the GBP/USD... If the days candle is over 80 pips I will look at the 4H charts and see what the last few 4 hour candles have been up to to reduce the SL

--- 帖子 #268 ---
It was kept that per design. Being that the BoE minutes were going to coming out while I was asleep, and unsure of the direction of the market I wanted to keep it close. It was a risky trade, but very very profitable. Just happened to come up a few pips short this time.

Pips this month = 647 Win Ratio = 85% Potential pips had I stayed in longer = 2228 Win Ratio had I stayed in longer = 64% Having looked back at some of these trades and the signals they gave I believe I would not have taken some of them....but still no complaints Thank you Fozzy Edit....some of the trades in the fozzy.pdf doc are not fozzy trades.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
So these are all 4-hour trades? What fozzy variant are you using? In other words, are you filtering out any crosses?

--- 帖子 #280 ---
I use the Daily charts only and I do not filter any crosses.....However some of the trades that were at S/R levels I would probably not have traded because of the 1:1 rate of return ratio that BB talks about.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Hi and thanks for your research! I'd like to add myself to the previous question and also to ask what was your exit (or SL?) rule? For example I don't understand your AUDUSD@5/8/2007 trade. Why did you take 16p only? May be you can show a chart? Thank you anyway!

--- 帖子 #282 ---
The honest answer to your question about the 16 pips instead of 50+ is I don't know. I only just started trading the Fozzy method at the beginning of this month and at the time to be up $1.60 for me was big bucks... ....I think I bugged out because aud/usd had gone up so quickly and I paniced. My stop lose is always the high/low of the previous day....which is why some of my trades are down 80+ pips. Still figuring out my TP......any help is always appreciated Last night I traded the eur/cad and went to bed with out a trailing stop or TP. It went up 100+ pips then down to my SL of the previous day's low...Bugger....But like I said still learning. How is everyone else doing with the Fozzy Method?

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Thanks for your answer! I use near idea of SL - H/L of previous "wave". Some times it's fractal, some times it's previous day's candle. How do you think, is B/E after 40p then Trailing with 40p is normal for day method? And... is Trailing Stop - the only exit tactic you use? May be some calculating ideas like a %ofATR? (Does some one still use it for SL or TP?) The same is about Vegas Tunnels. Are they already not in use? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Excellent job!!! You seem to have the hang of it ...but a couple of questions if thats alright.. 1. are you taking all crosses what criteria do you use for rejecting trades 2. do you use filters of any kind 3. i use dynamic zone rsi , but when others are getting crosses mine aren't registering...any ideas Also( sorry ) i am just about to go live can you tell me what account type you use ( i only want to play with 250 for now ..so small ) also if you now of a good broker....blah ...blah ... good results mate speak soon Rye

nope, as i mentioned that i will be entering at a new daily open, these possible trades are for daily fozzy obviously. What are your possible trades? Thanx.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
I've only been trading the fozzy for a few weeks, but my results have not been nearly as impressive: http://forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=29443&amp;page=7 I have perused your attached PDF files with great interest because there is such a discrepancy between our performance. I know that it is not fruitful to attempt to simply copy another trader's methods, but that doesn't mean that you can't constantly review your results against the results of others to expose any flaws in your own method. Likewise, I have been puzzling over the difference between my approach and yours. There are a number of minor factors involved: You are using Dynamic RSI and I am using a manual RSI/MA combo. My RSI keys on median price, whereas yours keys on closing price. I use a PSAR filter while you do not. But after reviewing these factors for a while today, they don't seem to define any major difference between your trades and mine. However, I do think I've found one major difference between your approach and mine - your use of trailing stops. I have constantly flip-flopped between loving/hating trailing stops. Most recently, I was in the "hate them" camp, but your results are forcing me to re-evaluate that approach. I think that my problem in the past is that I have set trailing stops that were entirely too tight, thus taking me out of otherwise profitable positions after brief spikes. I'm going to post more thoughts on this topic in my own trade journal...

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Not sure what to tell you, except I keep it as close to Fozzy original as possible without and other interferance.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Wow, took the GBP/JPY short, moved to breakeven after it went in the 30's and walked away for 10 minutes and was stopped out. That was a nasty reversal.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
I believe this was all tied to Australian news and it was a very bizarre market response. I was watching the market at 9:30 (I have 3 different AUD-short positions) and I watched my open positions go up by +$100 in a matter of minutes - only to watch them slip right back down minutes later. The main piece of news was supposed to be retail sales - which came out below expectations - but I think the market was whipsawed by the fact that a "lesser" release - construction work done q/q - was better than expected.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
The recent drop in Yen pairs is due to the 300% chinese stamp tax increase on stocks. It may signal a carry trade selloff, however, it depends how the market will react to it. http://forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=31687 20:45 Fukui is on the wires saying that it is critical for central banks to examine factors behind global imbalances .

Very nice indeed. What is ultra-cool is this - Consider what happens when your account grows to the size where you can trade just few high probability setups a months, and using proper MM techniques risk 1 or 2% max, and make a KILLER living? What would those pips look like if you could safely and reasonably trade 10 contracts at a time? Would you be able to scrape by on about 60 - 70K (USD) per month? Get to 300 - 500K in the account and you are home. Compounding will work it's magic!

--- 帖子 #305 ---
StoragePro, I agree with you completely....

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Hi billser, are you taking all signals? What is your exit strategy? I remember several being posted before, but are you taking a straight pip profit, or using a trailing s/l, or...? And are these above trades closed profit, or is this profit locked in with a stop? For example, the usd/cad trade I'm assuming you took several days ago, as I don't see a cross yesterday? Oh, and CONGRATS!!! Great job, keep it up!!

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Below are the trades I took last night and you are right some of the signals are not there. What happened was I was blindly going off of the red and blue arrows of the AO_FozzySignal Window indicator which as you can see has a cross signal. After I took the trade and went back later that night to see how things were going, I noticed I should not even be in the trade. NO MORE AO_FozzyWindow Singal for me.... Exit strategy....whats that...only joking....stilll working on it.... SL is mostly previous days high/low TP is also a work in progress. usd/cad was a trade I took last night based on the AO indicator I was wrongly watching. I normally only look at the actual physical cross of the ma/rsi....I think my allergies were kicking my ass last night and I screwed up.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
I'm guessing there is a thread somewhere on this web-site for the "Fozzy Trade"?? Not sure what it is yet, buy I'll find it. Thanks, WillyT

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Excellent guess, happy hunting..............

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Sometimes this indicator will look at a 'bounce' of the RSI and MA and generate a 'signal'; these occurances are misleading. I like using this indicator more as an alert for a possible trade, than as a trade indicator. It's always best to confirm a cross by looking carefully at the RSI and MA and checking the values for both. This can especially be helpful when there are successive "arrows" on the indicator, but other indicators do not support a trade. HTH!

GBP/USD +0 Pips AUD/JPY +16 Pips EUR/AUD + 19 Pips I would have been up 180 pips if I had held on to a/j and e/a but I had just raised my lot amount to $0.30 from $0.20 and was feeling that fear factor coming on.....I got out side my comfort zone for a couple of trades....feel the rush.... ......and pulled out when I was in the plus. I held g/u until this morning only to wake up to -30 pips and what saved me was the Chicago PMI being stronger than expected. But feeling good about myself for stretching my lot amount a bit more...

To All the seasoned Fozzy traders. Do you ever trade anything on the eve of the NFP report coming out tomorrow. Tomorrow looks like aud/cad has a cross. So my question is will only USD related pairs get effected by the NFP or will all pairs have a response. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
NO.......................good day to take off from Fozzy trading.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
thanx for your insight. I also took the GBP US short trade and still in it, with a stop above 1.9850. I also feel now that I should have exited earlier, but I have the feeling it will go down more on daily, while still in the down trend. Of course, it all depends on NFP, but in the last few months, NFP didnt change an already established trend, even if it was in the opposite direction.

hi.. Just been setting this up on MT4...and was wondering is the ma a...sma..ema..wma...the ema seems to look a little better.. and also... the rule about going long only with a cross below the BB centre line...is that still a valid filter.....looking back on a cable chart shows..could have missed a few nice trades...it would seem logical that if a trend has started the RSI and ma would most probably already be above the BB centre line..

I entered long on EUR/USD at candle close yesterday 3PM MTN. I checked my trade this am and RSI is crossing again to the short side. I am still holding the long trade open because there is a strong support level around 1.3398 What filters or methodology do you guys used to avoid entering a trade like this where RSI can re-cross again after the close of the signal candle? Your help is greatly appreciated.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
These are definitely the tricky ones, and I'm not sure there is a perfect way to filter them all. One thing I have noticed (not an expert however) is that if the RSI and RSI-MA lines are running very close to each other, then the trade is risker as the cross isn't very 'strong' if you see my meaning. I don't know how to quantify it (RSI must be more than x away from the RSI-MA for example) but a steeper cross seems better. -TPO.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Ramrocket , there are some things were not supposed to work out ... however if you overlay somekind of horizontal line on the ma you can see its as flat as a pancake( or whatever your favourite flat food is ). this is one of those weeks when you remember all those stats that say ' price action spends most of its time range bound '. When its like this its best to stay away or find something else to trade .TPO hit it right ..the ma is very indecisive around the rsi.. and what you also notice (although maybe this is just me ) is that prior to applying a new method ,in this case fozzy , when you look back in time at your favourite pairs ,they sweep gracefully up and down for 3-4 days at a time, but the moment you apply your new metod everything flatlines .... Like i said, this might just be me , but its a very frustrating waiting game...bear with it ( bear ...not a trade suggestion) if you do find a way .. be a good chap and pass it on.. Cheers Rye

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Hey now. Did you set a reasonable stop and risk? If you did, what changed in less than 24 hours to throw you off? Why did you take the trade? Was it valid at the time you took it? Did you follow the rules or free lance a bit. If you followed YOUR rules, then why would not simply let your SL work for you? If you broke YOUR rules... why did you do that? Gambling? If you don't have a set of WELL DEFINED rules - stop trading and make some. Take some time doing this. Then, start again and faithfully follow your rules to the "T". Keep a journal and record every trade and why you took it. That way when doubt creeps up on you, you will have the chance to rebuild your confidence all over again. You may get stopped out, but you followed the rules - which is key. Please excuse the mindless blather. BTW - there are a few good filters you can use that are brilliantly discussed in the thread. Go ahead and start at the beginning of it and read away. It makes for great bathroom reading. Don't be a tourist - be a pro.

hi... well yes I have been reading...and looking at the other relavant threads also....was always going to do that....just wanted the set-up right so I could compare with whats been posted...

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Angler, I'm using an indicator called Dynamic RSI that some others here are using as well, and I have no idea if it's using ema or sma (it's not open sourced). Why not set up two indicators, using each, and see how they compare? Do some backtesting of your own and determine which gives better results. In a related note, I'm currently doing some testing of my own for my exit strategy and have discovered in my short time as a trader that it's almost necessary to do your own testing, regardless of how many backtests have been done by other people, as even mechanical trading is never exact and needs to be done by the person who will do the trading going forward (just a side note that I wanted to share).

--- 帖子 #335 ---
hi.. Thanks for that Josh.. I just might set-up another chart and compare.. First I will just try the system as Fozzy designed it...and from a post I read in the main thread he is basically still using the original idea..with added levels for exits. As far as stops go...using a daily chart I think you have to be prepared to just let the trade run...of course have an initial stop lvl...but no trailing stops or things like that, as a daily bar can have large intra day movement and you just end up getting stopped out for smalled profits which in the end can effect your overall profitability as its the longer trends your probing for that will greatly cancel out the numbers of initial stops hit.

You make the rules you follow. There are multiple ways of taking a cross - all the way from a restrictive BB filter to using the cross all by itself. Read the main thread - lots of goodies there. Here is the trick - You have to figure out what works for you. You will need to know why you are following some rules. These reasons have to be your reasons, not BeachBum's or Fozzies. You may find mimicking one of the traders here does work for you, but you still make it your own. It can take months, even years to get your mind wrapped around trading. Good luck and take heart - it can be done.

The BBands are up to the individual.....sometimes I take them into consideration and sometimes I don't. My suggestion is for you to use Fozzy method the way that suites you best. If the original Fozzy is the best for you then do that ....if Fozzy is best with out the BBands then do that....I use a bit of descretion when i trade as do almost everyone one who uses this system or ANY other system..... Some pips you win....some pips you loss... some trades you miss.... some trades you wish you had never got into...... You have the final say in deciding if you are going to take a trade and what the reasons are for taking that trade....not me or Beach or Coolshades or anyone else. Regards, Billser

Hey StoragePro, Stop picking on BeachBum.....

--- 帖子 #350 ---
It's a good thing I'm not sensitive to SP's poking, nudging, leg-pulling. Actually, SP has made a few very funny posts............... ...at my expense....

--- 帖子 #351 ---
You are a good sport! I like the FF very much. Lots of good people here - such as yourself and many others too numerous to mention. The last post to Sourour was the real deal. I've been doing some research and self searching. This game called trading really is about the person - and not the market. When I run across a fellow like the Bum-ster, I take notice. I wonder how his clock ticks and how I can pick up the things that make him a success. We cannot do as the BeachBum does - but we CAN learn the process. We will always do as we ourselves do - and that may mean change. I don't care so much aboutthe 'system', I care about the mental aspect. Ther are lots of good systems. Precious few good mental outlooks. Don't misunderstand - I do not want to be the Bum, I want to be me - with the internal psychological components required to be a enduring success. So - what makes the BeachBum the BeachBum? Learn these components and success is a step closer - me thinks. Cheers!

Hey SP, thanks for the complements! I want to share a little of my trading background in hopes it will encourage someone else who is on the learning curve like myself. I have essentially been a positive person and an entrepreneur my whole life. But when I started to learn Forex trading almost four years ago, I was not psychologically prepared. I am a "numbers guy", so the technical aspects of trading came very easy for me, but not the "head game" that is an important part of being successful. I struggled with this for a long time...............too long in hindsight. My solution was to read all I could about the psychology of trading and then try to integrate that into my thinking and trading; developing what I hoped would be a successful trading "style" or personality. One place where I found a lot to read that was very helpful was Forex Factory; and in particular the writings of FijiTrader. I read everything this guy writes (one of the primary reasons I am a James16 PF member). We have talked on the phone several times and that helped my psyche as well. In time I got to know more traders on a personal basis; either through PM, email or Skype communication. The interchanges we have had helped me mentally with my trading. Another trader I consider a good friend is williamk who posts here occasionally and on an other forum I frequent regularly. My point is this: reading and interacting with others here at FF has helped my trading immensely! This is one of the reasons I try to contribute what I hope is helpful to others. I don't feel qualified to help others psychologically; but because the technical part is fairly easy for me, this is where I "try to give something back". Those of you who have read my posts know I won't do someone else's work for them (OK, right now willf and coolshades are both thinking: "yeah he is always sending newbies back to the first post and telling them to read the whole thread..." ), but I will try to point someone in what I consider is the right trading direction, providing enough information and data to serve as a solid basis for learning and eventually successful trading. I apologize for getting off topic here; it just seemed like a good time to respond to some of the things posted by my comrade SP.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
brother, not at all... i know some of the newbies get pissed off at being frogmarched to #1, but i think with hindsight they will realise why and thank you for it.. there were occassions i felt like chucking it in, but what kept me going is the interaction with you over here and elsewhere. i have still not reached where i want but there are different reasons to that.. dont ever stop posting (OK, right now willf and coolshades are both thinking: "yeah he is always sending newbies back to the first post and telling them to read the whole thread..." ),

--- 帖子 #354 ---
any one on these trade still, since 31st may?.. beach you dont need to answer.. i know your reply..

--- 帖子 #355 ---
now wait a minute cool...............I trade this pair "very cautiously", which doesn't mean I'm not in this trade. Actually, I went long using the 4 hour chart but baled early because I've been burned too many times. I took a total of 90 pips, but as you can see there was much, much more to be gained. I hope you have been long since the last signal............

--- 帖子 #356 ---
i too baled out early.. i think i asked this out of some latent sadomasochistic tendency..

Very Nice Trade

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Hi BB Have you removed vegas levels from your charts for good or is it on this occasion only?

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Last night I traded the g/j. The crossed looked good but I didn't like the 138 pip SL which would have been the high of the last candle...oouch....so I went to the 4H chart to see where I might place the SL. I settled for around 80+ pips..... I wake up this morning to find my SL taken out and then retraced back to the positive.....Man was I mad.... Any thoughts on what you would have done for a stop loss...? Or is this one of those trader that you put down to experience!! Thanks Billser

--- 帖子 #363 ---
What was your target and how did you calculate it? Vegas? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #364 ---
I didn't have a target if you mean TP.... I was going against the trend but that is not unusual with the Fozzy trade system

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Hello Howard............ I see you are carefully watching my charts................. Vegas was off in the last screen shot for display purposes only. When I am testing, I often add and remove indicators for convenience and clarity sake. But I still like using the fib levels on the Vegas Daily display. As stated before, I'm always tweeking. HTH!

--- 帖子 #366 ---
billser................how did this happen? The cross was two days ago, not yesterday, and the trade has been a good one!

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Here's an interesting little screenshot:

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Two days ago.... ....on my charts below it crossed yesterday unless I'm doing something wrong Blue line is the cross and trade was the next candle...

--- 帖子 #369 ---
bill, i dont know how drsi works but if it means a short when there is a cross at the lower end of the envelope then you are right., a normal fozzy cross occured a couple of days back as beach mentions... and if i remember right, you DID take the gbpyen a couple of days back too!!!!

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Thanks and happy trading. Yes I do watch your charts.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
thanks for the input Coolshade...below are my trades for June.... beach which version of the AO indicator are you using.......and yes I do realise that it is probably my Sunday candle messing with my head and broker input......

--- 帖子 #372 ---
You guys are referring to 2 different crosses. You are referring to the upward (long) cross. Billser is talking about the downward (short) cross, which is shown on your chart as well.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Which leads to the question offffffffffff.....do you only take Fozzy trades in the direction of the trend.....??

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Excuse me: I am referring to the "down" cross on my chart which occurred two days ago. The dotted verticle line is a "period seperator", not the cross I am discussing.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
I see you are using the Dynamic Zone RSI indicator, which I don't particularly like. I use the AO_FozzySignalALL (I posted it recently). BUT...I always visibly verify the cross and look at the "values" to be sure I have a clean cross and not a "bounce". This indicator has served me very well since originally posted by 'miscon777'.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Recently, willf posted a very important observation about The Fozzy Method. He stated that this method is very good at identifying "trend changes", either long or short term. That said; I will trade with or against the larger general trend. More conservatively against (2 lots), more agressively with (3 lots). Backtest and see for yourself how this plays out.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
This is the chart with the AO all on it

--- 帖子 #378 ---
And that leads to the next question of......how to determine what the current trend is?

--- 帖子 #379 ---
I believe the difference can be attributed to broker time difference. I use FXDD because the new Daily candle is generated at 5 PM ET, at the close of the NY markets. I've seen this before and it is one of the main reasons I use the FXDD feed.............plus NO SUNDAY CANDLE!

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Got TREND ???

--- 帖子 #381 ---
I noticed the difference in signals from FXDD to IBFX. I did not take this trade because of it. I was demoing on IBFX but wil switch to FXDD. I just started Fozzy this week and look forward to testing. I also trade the box breakout of 0:00 GMT to 8:00 GMT (8pm-3am est time) of the E/U off the 15 min chart.

Welcome to Fozzy trading Cmartin371.....

--- 帖子 #383 ---
sheesh man... i used to think bill gates made a career out of making software releases every now and then.. and also made a little bit of moolah in the process.. but the way fozzy variants are coming up, beats even that.. so that leads to.. whats box trading please.. or pls direct us to the resource..

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Thanks Beach! I love your posts and have been following the threads for some time now. I too work full time which really made this style of trading attractive. The box break out....well I do not want to hijack the thread. But its just a hi/lo breakout. Been around for ever with different variations. I have read that banks will use this method, have seen versions from the SRDC crew, the fxoperator crew, etc. They say the daily trend will be determined after 3am...hence the breakout.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Similar to the Hans123 method?

--- 帖子 #386 ---
I am not familiar with Hans123. I am still trying to get a feel for the box, bankers box, or whatever you want to call it.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Sorry Cmartin, I had to remove the link you posted, Rule #3

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Sorry - that dotted line did indeed throw me off.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Sorry I was not trying to promote anything. Just pointing you towards a version of the box set up.....

--- 帖子 #390 ---
I understand..............thanks!

--- 帖子 #391 ---
No worries mate!

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Now this is interesting......See Chart below....Had I stuck to my Fozzy rules and used the high of the previous candle as my stop loss I would now be UP 145 pips instead of down 80+ pips..... It's hard to do a 138 pip SL but maybe what I should do is lower my lot amount from 30 cents to say 10 cents per lot to compensate for the large SL....

--- 帖子 #393 ---
But you had some target for this trade in your head, hadn't you? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #394 ---
I have a better idea: switch to FXDD...............you would have been in this trade a day earlier with a smaller S/L and right now you would be up 280+ pips like someone else I know.............

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Maybe it sounds fun or maybe I need to sleep... But what is FXDD? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Oh, Oh.............some people will see this coming.............. Do you access to Google?

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Beach it's like target practice for you isn't it......

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Oops

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Hi all! Here we have conter-trend signal taken a little bit later in according to candle formation and Stoch. http://img249.imageshack.us/img249/9514/votwk5.gif There were pips... But then - trend bearished it. Even entering with H4 I have to look at D1 for exit, isn't it so? Then nearest Vegas Line wasn't reached. Question: how did we have to fix profit (or when to move SL) in this trade? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Were you guys on last night's crosses? I've been trading poorly lately, but last night has recharged my batteries. Buy AUDNZD Sell CHFJPY ( closed out 1/2 position for +51 - the rest is still riding) Buy EURGBP (closed out whole position for +11 ) Sell EURUSD ( closed out 1/2 position for +66 - the rest is still riding) Sell GBPUSD ( closed out 1/2 position for +92, closed out other half for +157 ) Buy USDCHF ( closed out 1/2 position for +65 - the rest is still riding)

--- 帖子 #401 ---
I got G/U E/U U/C and C/Y. But I closed them out around 30 pips each. I had to get to work and the weekend is calling. Edit: I wanted to metion that I am not taking the trade at the open of the next bar. I am playing the break of the hi/lo signal. I think Miscon was doing this in his/her journal. I will test and see how it goes. That is how I normally play pin bars, bullish/bearish bars, inside bars....etc.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
is anyone gonna be getting in early on this potential usdjpy cross? looks very promising.... I'm long at 121.61...

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Most Fozzy traders have a good sense of humor..................

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Repeat: day-in and day-out Fozzy is profitable, but committment is required!

--- 帖子 #405 ---
I used the 4 hour chart to get in early yesterday at 121.10.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
BB, Nice trade! Sounds like you got that 4hr deal down pat. Wish I could get Meta at work. Dailys will have to do for me at this point in time. Chris

4 hour rocks!

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Amen

--- 帖子 #410 ---
I tried to use the 4-hour chart earlier this week to jump some signals and it totally backfired on me. So the problem now is that I'm gunshy. I know that in the long run you can do much better for yourself by grabbing trends early on the 4-hour chart. But sometimes it can be difficult when you try something for the first time and then get bombed. I will return to the 4-hour chart. It's just going to take me a little time before I'm comfortable enough to go back to it...

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Backtest...backtest...backtest

--- 帖子 #412 ---
just curious, what do u do if the 4h fozzy crosses, but the daily fozzy is unclear....ie either mid way between crosses, or trending in the opposite direction? for example what the eur/us or eur/jpy and even aud/us is doing now? do you take the trades and verify with another indicator? or do u stay out? thanks

I am attaching a very simple spreadsheet that I use to determine position sizing. This allows me to set any SL that I deem to be appropriate without worrying about overextending myself with a major loss. To use it, you just enter the following 4 values (with hypothetical values shown for illustration): Equity: 10000 Risk %: 1.0 Pip Value: 0.82 Stop Loss: 128 Once you've entered these values, it will calculate: Max Loss: 100 Lots: 1.0 So if you were trading with a $10k account and you wanted to risk no more than 1% of that account on the USDJPY (which has a pip-value of $0.82) with a SL of 128 pips, you would trade 1.0 mini-lots and your maximum loss on the trade would be $100. I hope this can be a useful tool for someone.

Thank you Bb!

hello trader anyone will take the NSDUSD short today or we shall wait the confirmation?? good luck

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Any one take the U/J signal. It was not a clean cross for me. It's a DLHC bar, but I may stay away from this

--- 帖子 #422 ---
This is not yet close to a cross on my charts.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
I'm on it.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Did you get the cross, or just playing the bullish price pattern? I have no cross, but the bullish price pattern could confirm a break off the weekly pivot. I will set a buystop at friday's hi. Edit: Could be interesting with strong resistance at 122.10.....

--- 帖子 #425 ---
I got the cross. FWIW, I also traded: Sell AUDNZD Sell EURCAD Buy EURCHF Buy GBPCHF Buy USDJPY For the time being, USDJPY is the only one sitting in negative territory, but there's a long way to go on these trades...

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Nice night! What did push you to close this position? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #427 ---
The only signal I got was E/C. No signal on U/J. I still have a buy stop at Friday's high for possible play on the DBLHC

--- 帖子 #428 ---
EURGBP was closed by a trailing stop.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
CMartin....................are you aware that you are using the "Backtest" indicator and NOT the "Trading" indicator on your charts?

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Shit...well I'm glad I posted a chart. I can't remember where I downloaded this indicator. Could explain why I did not get a cross. I will see if I can find the correct or most recent AO indicator. Thanks for the heads up BB! Chris

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Back in the early pages of the original thread you will find all the indicators and an explanation about each one as posted by miscon777.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Thanks BB...I will just search miscon's posts. Chris

Some signals for tonight?What do you think guys? NZD/CAD CAD/CHF EUR/NZD Fell free to share your 2 cents

--- 帖子 #434 ---
I maybe wrong but I don't think may trade these pairs. My broker doesn't even offer them.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
I'm just curious what everyone decided to do with today's crosses on NZD. I have fozzy signals on AUDNZD and NZDUSD. I don't normally ask for public confirmation on crosses that I can see clearly in front of me, but I'm asking because these crosses were solely created by the RBNZ's intervention last night. This is like a cross that has been created as a result of a huge NFP number. I'm not trying to get anyone to make my decision for me - I've already taken both crosses. But I'd just like to know how others are approaching it.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Very cautiously. I took the NZD/USD cross and am keeping a close eye on it. Seems to the RBNZ sent a pretty clear message last night that these rates are to high and if given the chance they may sell off quite a bit of currency to make sure they stay at an acceptable level. Hopefully, the market will decide they are not going to be able to run to far above 7600 without the possibility of CB Interventation and sell off.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Alright...got the right indicator up now. I got signals for Eur/CAD and EUR/GPB. Not a clean cross on E/C and No cross on E/G. I will stay out and look at playing some of the inside bars. Lot's of them tonight.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Does anyone think the NZD pairs are going to retrace the big 120+ move...4H looks like it could. Billser

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Well, for my own selfish interests, I hope you're wrong.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Are trading system rules made to be broken? How does a trader apply discretion in the face of a price move like this one? Is there always a BIG retrace after large fundamentally driven price action that shows up on the charts as a Fozzy signal? If I had the perfect answers I'm be selling them on my own website as a signal provider! Past experinece has taught me that when I break my trading system rules, the result is not in my best interests.................

--- 帖子 #441 ---
I am with this guy.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Count me in

--- 帖子 #443 ---
G'day Bytebodger, Personally, I pay attention to the range of the bar on which the cross, and hence the signal, happened. If it's "considerably" more than the average range for the pair, I skip it. Of course, "considerable" is a subjective term. Historically, signals that occur on bigger than average ranges tend not to work out in the shorter term (meaning my SL is usually hit before it reverses and goes in my original direction). This is from my own testing. Of course, you do miss the times when it does continue on, but that's the price you pay. Pips lost count against your balance...missed pips don't. That's the philosophy I apply to this. I chose not to take any of the NZD trades, of which there were 3. I suppose this does equate to going against my system rules, but it could also be argued that this is the discretionary part of it. I dunno. Cheers, Art...

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Agreed. Fozzy gave me 3 signals last night - NZDUSD, AUDNZD, and EURGBP. When I woke up, my 0.5 lots of AUDNZD had been stopped out at -43. My NZDUSD is still open and sitting at almost BE. And on EURGBP, 0.3 lots have closed at +24 and I have another 0.3 lots of EURGBP open at +23. (Notice that the negative AUDNZD and the positive EURGBP that have closed basically cancel each other out, since the EURGBP pips are worth so much more.) So the lesson that I take from this (as I have been learning repeatedly over the last few months) is to just trade them all. In fact, when you look at everything that happened last night, including the fozzy trades that I had open from the day before, I made 144 pips in closed trades while I slept last night. Good, good stuff.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
As so it is that you have answered your own questions and profited at the same time................well done!

--- 帖子 #446 ---
ByteB i'm on the NZD/USD and AUD/NZD, and both are still running: AUD/NZD -26 pips NZD/USD +4 pips.So my question is what was your SL?

--- 帖子 #447 ---
I had a 52-pip trailing stop [ATR(30) x 0.7]. When I woke up this morning it was already stopped out. Looking at the chart, the price peaked at 1.1240 before reversing during the night. It has now, of course, recovered to a point where it is close to its original opening price for the day. This trade illustrates the dark side of trailing stops - the fact that otherwise-profitable trades can be taken out by spikes. I have begun making heavy use of trailing stops and they seem to be treating me VERY well. But there is no such thing as a "perfect" stop, and this is just one example where a trailing stop was less than ideal.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
BB, do you still use ATR(10) to figure out SL? I entered USD/NZD yesterday as well with SL at 82 pips. It is still open but not much is going on now at -15.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Sometimes...............but I prefer to conduct detailed and indepth backtests for at least a year to determine what values works best for S/L and T/P. See my recent posts in the original thread about some of this. AND I DO NOT BREAK MY TRADE RULES!!! HTH!

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Looks like fozzy crosses coming on Aud/USD and Aud/JPY

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Both have a good technical setup(for me) going into cross, as they are both crossing on the 4hr and heading south on 1hour at the sametime.. aud/usd also breaking dtl on 4hr Wait and see... Rye

--- 帖子 #452 ---
On my chart the cross on AUD/USD was in 11.06.The rules of the Fozzy method tel us to enter the next day. PS:Byteb if you like to use trailing stops use them but after you close your first lot in profit, then it wont bother you if it turns back on you;thats how i do it.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
I am on FXDD Demo there was no clean cross or signal on the opening of the 6/12 candle at 5pm est. It is possible that I am smoking crack and just did not see it.

Actually I am positive that there was no signal at the open of the 6/12 candle......I was at work so can't take the cross on the 4h. I wish I could down load meta on the work PC...

Seems the explosion of USD/JPY has put some downside pressure on NZD/USD and today's AUD/USD cross. For those still holding, if retail sales can comes in as expected or above average, hopefully we will all see our TP's hit. Good trading to all

--- 帖子 #462 ---
I'm long on GBP/JPY.First lot closed +40 and the second still runs +102 and the AUD/USD cross it seemed a little bit wild for my taste so i passed. CU later guys

--- 帖子 #463 ---
I played Monday's Inside bar on U/J and just got out with 45 pips. Still holding on to the AUD/USD and AUD/JPY cross right now

--- 帖子 #464 ---
GBP/JPY looks like a cross and signal is happening on the daily, but I may wait unitil the close of the candle (5pm est). The cross has already happened on 4h

--- 帖子 #465 ---
I closed the second +76.It was droping like a brick so i di it, i didnt wait to hit my SL.Maybe i was wrong&gt;We'll see

--- 帖子 #466 ---
As usual, this pair has provided some excitement. You could make a case for entering this BUY on June 8, but it would have taken a lot of courage to do so; in hindsight, it worked out very well from that point. I entered on June 11 and have closed out two lots, but I think there is still room to go much higher. We WILL see!

--- 帖子 #467 ---
I agree. This pair is not for the faint of heart. And it maybe too late to enter by the time the new candle comes this afternoon. I am always un-sure of myself on this pair so I may just stay out. So far since late last week (when I started), Fozzy has been pretty good to me. Along with PA bars and The London open breakout, it has all been profitable. Thanks to everyone for keeping this thread alive

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Entered on Sunday myself. Good pin of a support and with the trend. Placed two lots. First closed and moved to BE for +130 pips. Second lot is now around the +140. I will now trail it and adjust my stop daily and see how far it gets.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
This should be interesting

Hi all! At Daily we see: http://img501.imageshack.us/img501/1011/90908396fy5.gif At H4: http://img254.imageshack.us/img254/5492/58032034iv3.gif How do you think: is it interesting to take? Or is this down-movement already finishing (at D)? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #471 ---
aktaurus........... You evidently have your own special version of the Fozzy system, let's call it "The Aktaurus Method". I don't know what your rules are or how much backtesting of this method you have done. But it appears that you are not terribly concerned that the Daily charts had a Fozzy 'down' cross last week and since then the price has been in a downtrend. It appears you are looking at the impending 'down' cross of the 8 and 8 on the 4 hour chart and wonder if this is a good reason to sell the EUR/USD. Correct? Without extensive backtesting and a FIRM set of rules, my opinion about this "potential" trade is no better than a coin-toss. I wonder if there are any other traders here who would advise you?

--- 帖子 #472 ---
My question is : is it a good idea to enter now becouse I missed the last week entry? Or is it better to wait for new powerful signal on D?

--- 帖子 #473 ---
And my answer is: what are your trading method rules and how much backtesting of this method have you done to validate it's worth? Do you expect any of us here to advise you on a potential trade? If I said "Sell" and the trade loses, will you hold me at least partly responsible? This thread is for sharing ideas, not giving advice on when or when not to trade!

Current Trades: nzd/usd +5 aud/usd +52 eur/jpy +30 gbp/jpy +11 Are any of you guys using Twiggs Volume/Momentum to confirm strength when Fozzy cross occurs?

--- 帖子 #477 ---
My NZDUSD was stopped out for a 2-pip loss. I closed half of my AUDUSD position at +58 and the other half is still open (currently +50). I am also on EURJPY (+52), GBPJPY (+35), and CHFJPY (+14). My AUDJPY position from last night was stopped out at -42. I have never heard of a Twiggs Volume/Momentum indicator.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Is this something from a Star Wars movie, Mr. Rocket?

I just scanned the charts for the first time in a while and it looks like it's going to be a busy night of fozzy crosses on the horizon...

Ramrocket........... In the spirit of "practicng what I preach"; I have searched for information about the "Twiggs Volume/Momentum" indicator, and can't find any. I'd appreciate your telling us more!

--- 帖子 #487 ---
BB, did you search FF? http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...ghlight=TWIGGS

--- 帖子 #488 ---
yeah, I found the same script on incrediblecharts.com but didnt know what to do with it

--- 帖子 #489 ---
I should have worded my post differently; I did find this thread, but like Forexoxo, I didn't know what it meant. Sad to say, I don't know or even understand code or the kind of data in that post; that's one of the reasons I do backtesting with charts, paper, pencil and calculator. Thanks for the reply!

--- 帖子 #490 ---
has anyone taken the eur/usd cross? or do you think its too risky due to the latest cpi pounding the dollar, and the dollar might rebound from it very soon?

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Yeah i'm looking at this cross too, i'm tempted to take it as well because swissy, cable and euro are crossing all at once. But i'm still unsure...any other opinions?

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Since the forex markets do not operate over a central exchange, the "volume" in forex is not the same as it is in stocks. Our "volume" is simply the number of incoming prices within a particular bar. My platform offers volume functions to derive TMF so I use it. I simply overlay a trend line and watch to potential break when Fozzy signal occurs as confirmation. (Please see chart)

--- 帖子 #493 ---
I took em all, cable swissy and euro... cable closed at tp +40, euro at +39 I'm still holding out for swissy to make a few more pips.... seems to me though that since all these crosses are against the dollar and were primarily caused by the lower than expected CPI, it would have been better to trade them when the news broke out on the 15th, with confirmation from fozzy..would have made twice as many pips...so maybe thats something to look out for in the future when trading for/against the dollar...

--- 帖子 #494 ---
I took the EUR/USD cross. It had hit and bounced off its 1 1/2 year old uptrend line nicely, so it seemed a good bet. Didnt take the cable because it is so strongly correlated with EUR/USD. It doesnt look like there will be much happening tomorrow? Maybe a NZD/USD cross?

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Very nice............thanks for the explanation!

--- 帖子 #496 ---
I took all three as well. I agree with your thoughts above. I closed them out with 67 pips on Cable, 20 on E/U, and 11 on Swissy just to be safe. Market gave me the pips so I took them.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Yeah I took euro as well late last night, up about 25 now, still hanging on hoping it can break that 1.3412ish resistance (which you can see on the 4 hour chart) Might be tough to break it though so maybe i should close

--- 帖子 #498 ---
where can i find the explanation of fozzy trading system? thanx

If you look at the bottom of this page you will see a similar thread section.......start there.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
hello dratef2..............as a new member here at FF, I would like to suggest you spend some time learning how to navigate your way around, including using the "Search" feature (it is very similar to Google). Three of your four posts are asking for someone to explain how a method works: the information you seek is right there in front of you! A successful Forex trader spends MOST of his/her time doing research and backtesting. Making and/or losing money usually happens very quickly.......

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Ain't that the truth!

--- 帖子 #504 ---
I took it yesterday.I closed 2 lots for +25, and 4 lots are still open.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Anyone CAD Sell

--- 帖子 #506 ---
AS FOR ME! Yes: 1. "Trailing" SL = 0,7xATR(30) of the previous down movement is broken (Magneta horisontal line) 2. 1,0546 - hystorical low and the nearest resistance line for the potential dow movement (Blue line) 3. Candle pattern "the Bearish engulfing" (Light blue square) No: 1. Resistance line of the previous down movement is not broken (Green line) 2. Stoch(14,3,3) is not crossed and is near 50-level All the above - IMHO only. It's important because all of these "Yes"- and "No"-reasons are "addons" and not the parts of the original Fozzy method.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
theres an impending cross down on eur/chf and eur/gbp and usd/cad, the euro pairs were also confirmed as breaking the trend up according to 4 hr mouteki... but i'd be careful and stay out of eur/gbp until the MPC minutes announcement tomorrow... also be a bit wary on cad untill Wholesale Sales report tommorow...i already took this one though after todays cad cpi, and im holding out at the moment at +40...might get out before whole sale tomorrow though...

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Thank you for the insite, Aktaurus, Someone mentionned that this strategy does NOT requires to wait for the next daily candle to start, in order for a cross signal to be valid. I am not done reading the Thread but well on my way and so far have seen nothing supporting this, all I have seen is to wait for the next candle to start under MT4 time. Would you mind elaborating on this statement, I am very interested. Thanks again

--- 帖子 #509 ---
IMHO it's just a work with the same strategy on the different TFs. We need to analise and backtest on the TF we are going to trade.

--- 帖子 #510 ---
The "original" Fozzy says clearly that you have to wait for the cross, and open your position on the next candle... and that's to avoid "bounce offs" off the MA line... however if you want to get in on a trade early, you can use Fozzy 4hr (theres a seperate thread for that, take a look at it) and use the 4hr cross to get in when an impending daily cross is also giving the same signal... I gotta say, I'm a newbie to forex, but the fozzy has worked best for me so far...all the other systems i've used (including so called technical analysis by the "experts") made me lose big time....if it wasnt for fozzy I would have wiped out my account a long time ago... oh well, its all part of the learning curve...if you don't make mistakes then you don't learn...if you don't make losses, then you can't make wins...

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Took AUD/USD EUR/GBP and USD/CAD this morning.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
this crosses follow the fozzy rules and i see that the usdjpy is cooked very well and needs traders to eat it good luck craige2

--- 帖子 #513 ---
hmm usd/jpy crossed looks like a nice short, any one else taking this? dont see any resistance until 121.85 or so

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Yes i tool it and i'm +8 on 2lots

--- 帖子 #515 ---
What if the cross does not hold and why not wait for beg of next bar as per original method, interesting what is the logic into this seems to be good decision with a pretty small risk. Looks good.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
I entered at the opeming of the new candel.On my broker the cross took place in 19.06, so i think it was a correct sell signal.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
What time frame does your broker use GMT +....and is he MT4. Thanks

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Interesting moment. I hope it'll be continued. What I see right NOW: 1. No Fozzy cross @ D1 2. Stoch haven't crossed down 80-level 3. "Trailing" SL = 0,7xATR(30) of the previous up-movement is not broken by the "Close" price of the current day bar (Magneta) 4. Support trend line of the previous up-movement is broken (Bold Green) 5. Fib's 76,4-level of the previous up-movement is not broken by the "Close" price of the current day bar (DodgerBlue) Red lines are nearest S/R lines as I see them. Vertical lines are potential borders of the previous up-movement. Take this cross? Not sure I will. Your thoughts?

--- 帖子 #519 ---
I use North Finance for demo and i have i live account at FXSOL. P.S.:USD/JPY closed(SL) -38 on 2 lots after it was +24.(first TP was 30)

--- 帖子 #520 ---
G'day Brolin, This is not meant to offend, merely a statement. Trades like this are a dime a dozen. I can safely say I've had a couple of dozen of my trades mimic the above scenario. This is all part and parcel of trading. They way I see it, we as traders have 3 choices: 1. Watch the charts and exit the trade when we see it stalling (we may as well be trading hourlies or lower if we're gonna do this...daily TF's are supposed to free us from being glued to the charts) 2. Lower your expected returns from the trades (ie. your TP's -) - but didn't these values work in backtesting??? 3. Let the system do it's thing (after extensive backtesting and being happy with what you have) and live with the fact that this will happen. No. 3 is where one should be if they have confidence in their system that they have extensively backtested, knowing full well that in the long run these types of trades will be more than cancelled out by bigger winning trades. It's all one big learning curve for us all. Cheers, Art...

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Sorry for your lost, Why did you take this trade if there were no confirmed crosses, what did you use as trigger. Thank you

--- 帖子 #522 ---
TiKin............. I'm in this trade at 123.60, using my 4 hour Fozzy chart (see the 4 hour thread) as a basis for entry. IMO, Brolin69 entered too early and has a S/L that is too small. I don't have great expectations for this trade but do expect to gain a few pips.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Humm, but there is no ''valid'' sell signal from 4 H. I am wondering if I am not being sent goose chasing from the shoreline

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Been in and out of the USD/JPY for a few days. From what I have seen the 123.30 area has been very solid support and I am not taking a Fozzy until their is a 1 hour close below this line by at least 5-10 pips.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Really?

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Really, why are you Fozzyed and me Not?

--- 帖子 #527 ---
"Fozzy" signal is when the 8 RSI crosses the 8 MA. Looking at your posted chart, you have the cross but not the green arrow and I don't know why. But here's the important point: what is your trade trigger? RSI/MA cross on the chart? Or "green arrows"? My suggestion: read the indicators that you use for trading! Cross? Or arrow? My trading is based on the cross; the arrow is simply an "alert".

--- 帖子 #528 ---
He's not using the AO_FozzysignalALL so he only get alerts when they are in conjunction with the bollinger bands.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
As usual willf, you are very observant AND correct..................

--- 帖子 #530 ---
But a signal bellow the BB middle line is not valid, I see that you use another indicator where you have signal no matter where, what is the conclusion of the use of this indicator rather than using the original rules

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Personal preference............I don't use Bollinger Bands.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
I got in when it (U/J) crossed on the daily. I don't have my charts here at work so I can't remember if it was yesterday or the day before, but it did uncross. I did not get home right at 5est, but I do know that the cross happend as the new candle was forming. I did not wait for the close of the candle the next day. I got in at 123.37 with my S/L set at 123.87. I am still in this trade (that I know of at least) Chris

--- 帖子 #533 ---
But you had great results with the original using BB. That means your results have improved with the ALL crosses indicator

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Can someone please tell me how to download the AO Fozzy all please ? Thank you, Maric

--- 帖子 #535 ---
I don't want to disappoint those of you who carefully follow my posts! maric (with only 3 posts)................one of the things that will help you immensely with the learning process here at FF is to learn how to use the "Search" function. A little time spent with this feature will lead you to the indicator as well as an explanation about how it works. And along the way you will have the opportunity to do a little Fozzy reading: a MUST if you intend to become a successful Fozzy trader...............all the best!

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Thanks Beachbum, I will give it a whirl. I am not up on searches etc, however there is nothing to loose. maric.

Hi , I am interesting. What can i do?

--- 帖子 #538 ---
How interesting are ya ? LOL Good weekend to all

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Well I'm quite boring actually... anyways, seems to be good crosses on the Chf coming your way soon... I took eur/chf and gbp/chf... can you believe the spread on gbp/chf at my broker is 9 pips!!!!!!! It seems the swissy is getting strong vs the rest, so good pips to all....

--- 帖子 #540 ---
9 pips is nothing to worry about. The last move on this pair made in excess of 300 pips.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Anyone taking the EUR/AUD cross?

I don't normally lookk at this pair, but it looks like it should have been taken on Friday

I took it and got stoped out, what signal do you see.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Look at the 4 hour chart from Friday and you will see ALL you need to know.

OK but ze took it on ze daily.

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Daily from Friday

--- 帖子 #547 ---
I am not using the ALL fozzy yet, as I don't have this buy signal; did you take the trade and I imagine the 4H was your entry ?

--- 帖子 #548 ---
I am 100% new to Fozzy and I want the "experts" to look at my 2 trades to make sure all is good in the hood. Green vertical represents entry.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
They are valid signals (although I never got them with my broker). But just remember you are going against a well established trend.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
willf, Yea, I noticed that after I pulled the trigger. Good thing its still a demo. I added a 28 EMA...can I use that to filter my trades...only going with the trend?

--- 帖子 #551 ---
The 28ema is ok as a filter for most JYP crosses as they have only gone up for quite sometime. Notice how the price retraces below then moves up again. It's not so easy for other pairs. Personally I just zoom out and try to see the bigger picture of where something is going.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Agreed! as you read through the fozzy threads you will see it discussed that one would be better off to trade all signals that your system gives you. So if I get a fozzy signal that goes against the long term trend I don't try and hit a home run. I shorten up on the T/P and take what the market gives. For example I took the EUR/JPY cross and the GBP/JPY cross tonight. Both were showing pin bars on the daily. Granted they were not at a swing low, but I had the trend and this type of price action bar against me. I took 25 quick pips from E/J and 14 from G/J. I am happy with that. So to sum it up it's how you trade the signals and understanding where price is at that point in time. That is what I am learning anyways. On determining trend, I use the Jacko method. Or by simply putting a 50, 100, and 200 ema on my charts. If 50 is on top followed by 100, then 200 you are in an up trend. Reverse for down trend. Chris

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Short AUD/USD @ 0.8453

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Took this one as well. AUD/USD been looking weak past couple of days.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
I was a little iffy about taking this since its against the main trend. However, I banked quite a few pips from the GBP/JPY &amp; EUR/JPY last night and those were against the main trend.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Took it with a very small TP (25 pips). It hit and Im happy

--- 帖子 #557 ---
look at EUR\USD chart. Does fozzy method show signal to sell ??

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Yes, but wait till the start of the next candle to confirm the signal.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
G'day all, Yesterday (26/6) the Fozzy EA v2.2 got me into AUDCAD, EURJPY, GBPJPY &amp; USDJPY all short. All turned out to be winning trades. All except the AUDCAD were exited on the same bar. Today (27/6) the EA got me into CHFJPY and GBPJPY short again! There was no re-cross on the G/J so I am confused as to why that trade was initiated 2 days running, but all stemming from the one cross. It's a bit of a concern and the first time anything like this has happened. On this occassion I ain't complaining as the G/J has netted me a total of +159 &amp; +155 in consecutive days. But, if there's an issue with the EA, it could just as easily be -ve pips. Anyone else encountered anything like this? Cheers, Art...

--- 帖子 #560 ---
if will be bullish candle so price go down - sell if will be bearish - fake signal ?

--- 帖子 #561 ---
i would be hesitant to take the eur/usd trade. the daily chart says short, the 4 hour chart says long. i say stay out. plus currently in an uptrend since 6/13, price is only 35 pips or so above the 72 ma, which is pretty solid resistance... trev

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Hi, This month for me has been a bad month with the Fozzy trades...down 212 pips as off 6/27/2007.... So I have been looking back on the trades I took and the signals that were given, where the rsi ma crossed in relationship to the BBands. Where was the R/S levels and what was the trend up or down. I am also changing my settings to 3.20.3 on the Dynamic Zone indicator to see if that helps. I changed the settings as an experiement because I am with IBFX and they have the Sunday candle. So far this setting in the last 7 trades has been ok (up 135 pips)... I didn't take any of the yen pairs this week because I have juist started testing this setting....but man I wish I had With the 3.20.3 settings I also notice very clearly that when the blue line (see chart) is at the very top or very bottom that is the best time to take the trade when a cross occurs and stay in the trade until the blue line reaches the bottom or top to exit... on the yen pairs this week that would have gieven me some excellent pips. Just my own observations and my own style of trading the Fozzy method. Any thoughts welcomed. Billser

--- 帖子 #563 ---
I took the 2 nice setup yesterday. I was a little bit late on my entries not watching the time of candle close. Nice trading this month. gbp/jpy +101 eur/jpy +76 Up +454 pips this month so far.

--- 帖子 #564 ---
If you look at your chart now, you will see that there is no signal at all, and, in fact, the price has retraced back up.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
This is a trap that a lot of new Fozzy traders fall into. The system is a daily system and works off the close of the daily candle. It's no good getting all excited and hyped over a potential cross because, as in this case above pointed out by Craig, the price retraces and on close on the daily bar there is no cross. It doesn't matter what it did during the bar - it's at the close that it counts. For those that trade the 4hrly or lower, it's still at the close on the relevant bars where we judge whether there is a cross or not. Of course, it's not law. You can trade it as you see fit. But, if you want to follow this method as it was intended you must only take the signals after the bar has closed. Only then are they valid. If you find some other "tweak" that lets you take the trade prior to close of bar and it's working for you, excellent. Then, it would be your turn to share! Cheers, Art...

--- 帖子 #566 ---
i dont see a problem with posting potential crosses... it allows people to point out something others may not have noticed... and for example my previous post showed some good reasons not to take the trade, in my opinion... if it stopped somebody from jumping the gun, its a good thing... trev

--- 帖子 #567 ---
No problem at all, I, in fact, wish there was more of it (mind you, I dont exactly detail the trades I take here). Its always good to "compare notes" BTW, looks to me like CAD pairs are resuming their downtrend. Might be EUR/CAD USD/CAD signals when tomorrow starts.

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Thanks for the answer but please tell me how does the following phrase fit your explanation and comprehension of the system : This strategy does not have a closing "requirement". post 2361 P. 158 of the daily Fozzy thread. Thanks

--- 帖子 #569 ---
I believe that Beach was referring to closing positions at the end of the say (as per your question). Waiting for the close refers to ENTRY rather than EXIT. You wait for the candle to close to confirm that there is an incontrovertible cross before entering a position.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
G'day Tikin, If I understand the statement correctly, I read it as there are no signals that you wait for in order to close out a position. It either hits your TP or your SL (or Trailing Stop). This is how I trade it. I enter the trade based on the crosses but my exit is determined by price movement. If it reaches my pre-defined TP's, it exits. Conversely, if it goes against me and hits my SL, again it exits. Is this the best way? I don't know. But, in my testing it was far more profitable to do this than to try and grab some arbitrary number of pips and exit. Your own testing will show what works best for you. Cheers, Art...

--- 帖子 #571 ---
If you are trading using only the Daily chart, this is correct; wait for the close of the Daily bar/candle before making a trade decision.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
I agree with Art wholeheartedly; my backtesting and experience has lead me to trade this way. Succombing to the temptation to grab early pips will lead to an overall loss. Why? Because most traders will let a trade run to a S/L but not the T/P, resulting in unbalanced and improper R/R and MM. However, every trader needs to do their own homework and establish their own personal trading rules.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
So would you say, on major pairs, that when the setup comes into play we expect to get on average around 30/40/50 pips?!? I would say 30 at least?

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Man o man. How true is THAT . I am finding this out via experience. I keep track of my trade - post close if I TP before I stop or hit my target, and It is true - it is a DUMB-ASS thing to do.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Cannot say straight out. It depends (doesn't always?). You'd have to know YOUR system expectation , and then actually trade it. Pip counts are not the measure. Some traders have very high expectancies (a far more important number than pips - by far ). You need to think differently. Pips are simply not the measure at all. Expectancy is. Get Van Tharps Trade Your Way To Financial Freedom and see why I say this. Of course MM is essential.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
And the rest

--- 帖子 #579 ---
lholcomb................I do not disgaree with your charts, but want to point out something for those who are still "learning" Fozzy trading: Look at the 4 hour chart on the USD/CAD. What do you see? I've been short since 1.0700. Two lots closed, one will run until exhausted. Learning a 4 hour method has it's advantages!

--- 帖子 #580 ---
CRAP!! Would you look at that...well unfortunately I have an 8-5 so the 4H isn't really an option for me. Way to go!

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Not so sure I would take the usd/cad after a big candle like that. Plus on the weekly chart it looks like a bit of support is in place for it to go much further down. And you have a pin bar on the 4H.... But in reality who the heck knows what it will do.....Happy trading Billser

--- 帖子 #582 ---
i passed on the usd/cad as well, the big candle, plus as well the action on the 4 hr chart as BB pointed out. the eur/usd and usd/chf still hadnt quite crossed on my daily open, 00:00 GMT.

Well, usually I take you alls advice...good thing I didn't with the USD/CAD...I had a nice 70 pip gain when I woke up this morning. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Your welcome, just be careful when using the 4 hour. Have you read the thread about trading the 4 hour Fozzy method? If not, I suggest you do so......

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Hi! I'm interesting: have you moved then your SL or just closed position? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #589 ---
I just let it hit my SL @ 1.0520...I was happy with what I had.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Cool! How did you set this SL? I don't see 0,7ATR or ATR or 1,7ATR at this value.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
I think initially I just set a 30 pip S/L and moved the S/L down as price went down. I am still on demo, just testing what I will eventually use. I am opening up a $300 mini and I just can't do a S/L that is 70% or whatever the ATR is until I get may account balance up. I know thats contrary to the Fozzy method.

--- 帖子 #592 ---
its going to be very difficult to trade a mini acct with $300... thats what i am using as well, but trading micro lots, i still cant trade more than 2 or 3 pairs at the same time... probably going to be switching to oanda where i can set the pip size... the only thing i dont like about oanda is they dont have trailing stops... so i may keep my current account open for my trailing stop trades... oanda for fozzy trading.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
MIG has a sunday candle. I have had a live account with FXDD a couple years ago for one trade. When I came to close my position at +45 pips, I got the message market has moved, I tried to close it for 5-7 times and it finally accepted after a few minutes at 25 pips profit, that was when the market completly stoped moving. They called me to confirm I was closing my account but never asked why after only one trade.

is anyone getting any decent cross signals lately? i can't seem to get any on my radar, the only one i have so far(end of today) is the cable cross, but it's too risky ahead of tomorrow's important Gbp and Usd news... what are your thoughts?

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Ive got a USD/JPY cross at the moment. The cable cross is against the trend as well, so I wouldnt take it even without news. Results havent exactly been spectacular over the last couple of weeks though.

--- 帖子 #609 ---
what about usd/chf today

--- 帖子 #610 ---
G'day Oh Dark One, Any crosses? Heck, I got no less than 7 crosses today via the EA. But, being the chicken that I am I passed on them all coz of upcoming news later today. Ok, some looked to be really nice by Fozzy standards but if I pick and choose my trades I invariably choose to go with the wrong ones. So, no go today. Remember, "out of the market" is a position as well. Cheers, Art...

--- 帖子 #611 ---
I totally agree with Craig2 and Artamon, the crosses recently have been way too risky, closer to gambling than to technical trading...has anyone else noticed than within the last 10 days or so, the currency markets have been extremely volatile and unpredictable? or is that just due to my paranoia? Dunno, maybe it's the uncertainty around the dollar and the US economy....for now i'm sticking to just oil trading, its risky but makes reasonable sense....a strong bull market since 3 weeks, and going on to next month...if you go long at a reasonable price there, you're bound to make a few bucks... anyways, keep us posted guys of you spot any decent fozzies....

--- 帖子 #612 ---
I have squeezed out some pips on a few of the crosses, but I am sitting negative on a couple right now. My S/L at 70% ATR is holding strong and the news should not have too much of an effect on the pairs I am in right now.

Hi Fozzy Folk, I have been trading the Fozzy crosses now for the last 3 months. 1st month was great, 2nd month was not great, and this month is mixed. So I have been playing around to find a set up that suites my style. What I have started to look at is the set up on the attached chart. It is the fozzy cross with the Phil Nell 5 min trading set up and the Phil Nell macd setting( please do your own search for Phil Nell on the FF) with a couple of twists to it. The yellow line on the chart represents a perfect trade. We have the Fozzy cross. We have the bounce off of the blue ma and we have the cross of the 5 ema on the macd. I and a few others in the Fozzy chat room are still looking at this set up and STILL learning how to trade it in conjuction with the Fozzy cross. So if you have any questions please feel free to join us in the Fozzy chat room..open 24/7 My template and AO indicator are attached... Happy Trading. Billser

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Hi Billser.............. Your screenshot has piqued my interest because you have so many green arrow signals that I do NOT have on my chart. This has been a subject for discussion before and I would like to get to the bottom of the difference, if possible. You have six signals since June 15; I have none! Therefore, I miss all the false signals. We have different brokers.......do we have the same AO_FozzySignalALL indicator? Is something else different? Is this why my results seem so much different from others?

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Hi Beach, Not sure what is going on......Can you load the indicator and the template on to one of your charts to see if my settings are screwed up..other wise the only thing that should be different is the broker...I use IBFX...with a sunday candle...dang.... Billser. EDIT: I think you said your broker is FXDD...who else uses FXDD and is your charts different to mine...? EDIT 2: Beach can you post your indicator so i can down load it to see if there is a difference..Thanks

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Here is a comparison of FXDD and IBFX. I deleted and then copied the indicator so I know both accounts are using the same AO_FozzySignalALL indicator. At the time of the screen shot and this post IBFX has not started the July 12th candle.

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Well done nvwine..............thank you! Billser, this answers your question too. I would rather miss a few good trades and at the same time the false signals. FXDD works very well for me; this is something for all Daily Fozzy traders to consider.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Dam that's interesting...do you think that the reason for so many different signals is because of the Sunday candle!!!!! or could it be other reasons?

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Sunday candle is one reason but the main one is different times of open and close of candles, 3 hours between FXDD and IBFX. The same problem exists with all the systems using 4h bars including fozzy 4h

--- 帖子 #622 ---
So what time does FXDD open and close...Thanks

--- 帖子 #623 ---
10.00PM GMT

--- 帖子 #624 ---
bill, we discussed this elsewhere.. am not convinced a different charting broker can make trades go suddenly profitable or lossmaking.. different broker opening times will ofcourse mean that a cross on fxdd today (and i too am a happy fxdd user), will mean that cross is +/- a day on another broker and yes at times a day late trade might mean the bull run is over.. but in the long run that shdnt matter shd it? my tuppence worth.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
It is actually 9:00 pm GMT which is 10:00 pm UK time (Summer) or 5:00 pm EST

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Hmmm..... this sounds familiar :-) http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...postcount=2297 One of the interesting things about this following post is that we concluded that your FXDD data feed somehow had a Sunday candle, when ours did not. Now, I still believe that somehow something on your machine just got "messed up" (in a good way since FXDD feeds do NOT have Sunday candles. I noticed that on my computer when I previously installed four different brokers, they all said "Alpari UK", even in the Help-&gt;About screen, when in fact it was different brokers. So do you have any other versions of MT4 installed on your computer BB? (As you can see, though I retired from the fozzy method due to a lack of consistency amongst us, I am still interested in it hehe) http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...postcount=2348

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Agreed.............

--- 帖子 #628 ---
I use FXDD because a new Daily candle forms at 5 PM ET (NY close) regardless of DST or no DST. THAT consistency is important for my style of Fozzy trading.

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Josh, we've been down this road before. I use TWO computers and they both show the same chart setup with an FXDD data feed. Since starting my Fozzy trading, I have had to "sign-up" twice for a new demo account with FXDD because the previous one expired; still no changes in my chart setup. I don't know why the charts I post are different from some other FXDD users. (And no, I don't have another version of MT4 on my computer. I update when prompted by MetaTrader.) Can anyone answer this question?

--- 帖子 #630 ---
There is only one version of MT4, it is the feeds which are different as to open-and-close time of bars which is the cause of all different results. there may be a few pips difference between various brokers' feeds but it has no effect.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Okay, go ahead and be picky--yes, there is a base platform and one version of each build for MT4. But... As for different brokers causing minor differences... I'm afraid that you are dead wrong my friend. Obviously you're forgetting time zone differences. If one broker is in TZ GMT-1, and another is in GMT+2, the two adjacent daily bars will have THREE hours of trading activity apportioned differently. Even hourly and less frequent bars can have significant data-only differences, but 4-HR and daily candles are huge issues. If you don't believe me do some backtesting on most any system (take this one, for example), and you'll see non-trivial differences in outcomes.

--- 帖子 #632 ---
lol BB, it's more like... we've been down, up, down, up, and back down this road! I wasn't trying to resurrect this issue, only responded because others are beginning to see just how important this difference can be!

--- 帖子 #633 ---
BB asked about versions of MT4 and I replied that there is only one version, also in my post I mentioned that different results are caused by different open and close time bars ; at any given time the quote from different brokers may vary a few pips thats is to say one broker may quote 1.3780 for euro and another broker 1.3779, that has no effect whatsoever on the results It is my utmost hope and endeavour to make this method work consistently as it is not comparable to any other method in terms of maintenance and monitoring.

--- 帖子 #634 ---
If you have ever backtested a system thoroughly, then you will definitely remember that even if brokers have the same time zone, two or three pips can make a non-negligible difference when price approaches SL levels, or TP levels, far from "no effect whatsoever." But even ignoring those minor inconsistencies in price, the issue at hand here is that time zone differences are what make the huge difference on the results here, as price may not be drastically different, but the way the price is represented in "bar form" (or "candle form") IS drastically different. This happens when brokers have different time zones, for example. Just look at the last few posts to see what a huge difference it makes! Relatively similar price from two different data feeds, same indicator, totally different signals! This is with ANY system, even a discretionary one, and especially a mechanical one! At any rate, I don't want to go off on tangents here--this is off-topic in this thread, sorry for allowing it to go off.

--- 帖子 #635 ---
In the midst of this discussion, I want to post what I consider to be important: Going waaaaaayyyyy back to the first post by Fozzy, we were informed that he looked at the relationship of the RSI and MA at the end of his trading day; that is, when the Daily candle on his chart closed. If there was a cross, and that cross was on the appropriate side of the Bollinger Bands center line, Fozzy would enter a trade. Simple......that was his method. Since that first post we have learned that a "Fozzy signal" to trade can be generated at different GMT times. Why? Because different brokers will close the Daily candle at different GMT times. AND we have learned that a signal may or may not be generated during a Daily candle depending on the GMT close time of that candle. We have all seen the RSI cross and uncross the MA during the "day". If you are using one the Fozzy indicators, you have seen the green arrow appear and disappear as this happens. What matters to us if we are using the close of the Daily candle as the time to make a trade decision is this: When the Daily candle closes, is there a new RSI/MA cross? Look back to post #618 by nvwine. This illustrates nicely how the different Daily candle close times affects the green arrow signals generated by the AO_FozzySignalALL indicator provided by miscon777. And so we have traders getting "Fozzy signals" at different times, or not at all as seen in the above example. My personal preference based on extensive backtesting is to use FXDD, because the Daily candle closes when the NY market closes at 5 PM ET (the traditional close of the Forex "trading day"). This works best for me and my individual style of Fozzy trading. But, I always confirm the cross before considering a trade and because I also use a 4 hour Fozzy method, I am usually already in a trade before there is a confirmed cross on the Daily chart. One more time: backtest everyone! Make sure you know what you are doing. Make some rules and stick to them like your life depended on it. Don't change the rules because you "feel like it". Use researched data before making changes to your system. When properly applied, this method works great.......

--- 帖子 #636 ---
I have been working on a trading system based around the Fozzy Method. My primary objective was to develop a system that would allow someone to profit consistenly over a period of months and eliminate as much discretion as possible. This is what I have come up with so far. This particular version is only for AUD/USD and no other pair although I am working on others. So here are AUD/USD rules, results and MM. 1.) Enter at the opening of new daily candle at 0:00 GMT-* 2.) Set your SL to 32 and your TP to 60 3.) Walk away and go do something. RESULTS: AUD/USD TOTAL TRADES: 30 32/60 WINS:17 32/60:LOSSES: 13 WIN %:56.67 R:R: 1.875:1 MONTHLY PIP AVG.:92 NET PIPS: 604 DRAW DOWN RATE: 100% DRAW DOWN Low/High: 4/28 Explanations A.) TOTAL TRADES- Trades from Jan of 2007 till the last Fozzy cross on July 9th. B.) Drawdown rate- This is the number of winning trades that went at least 1 pip in the opposite direction before becoming positive trades. Why does this matter? If we know in 100% of the cases it went down before up or vica versa then this allows us to even further minimize our risk and maximize our profits. For example, if you had a buy/sell order at 4 pips from the opening price in every trade then your SL/TP would have been 28/64 instead of 32/60. As you can see over a long period these pips begin to add up. C.) Drawdown H/L- This is the minimum and maximum drawdown over all the winning trades. So 4 pips being the smallest and 28 being the largest. This will help us, if we choose a more conservative approach, to a particular trade. In 12 of the 17 winning trades the pair moved 10 pips or more in the other direction before continuing on it's path. So for instance, if you were highly skeptical about a trade then you could set your buy/sell 10 pips off the open. Then the trade would only be costing you 22 pips but if it were to succeed then you would have a 72 point gain. D.) NET PIPS- How many pips you would have earned so far this year using the 32/60. NOTES: A.) I use MT4 with StrategyBuilderFX and have no Sunday candle B.) These results are for AUD/USD only and will vary depending on your broker and number of other factors. C.) Backtest results are from Jan of this year up till the last Fozzy trade this month which was July 9th. D.) Take profits and stoplosses were factored with a 4 pip spread E.) This is purely technical analysis, no news was taken into account. Thanks to Beach, Fozzy , WillF and the many others you have contributed to this thread and the evolution of this method.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
I don't tend to make too many posts, though I have to give it to BB, Foxy and the rest of the FF members that make a valuable contribution to this forum! And I cannot believe there are, pardon me French, lazy ass people about that do not want to spend some time doing some research and reading threads. There is no way to make a quick buck... I watched the fight lastnight at a BBQ... Amir Khan didn't get where he is now overnight!

--- 帖子 #638 ---
This is a great post because Roscoe_P has shown how a trader can use Fozzy basics to build a personalized trading system that is successful and profitable! I encourage every trader interested in acheiving results like this to do the same thing: backtest using the basic RSI/MA cross and determine for each pair what it takes to enter trades based on that signal that will generate a profit. Use solid RR and MM, stick faithfully to your rules, and you will be a winner over time. Thanks again for sharing your work with us.....................

Rosco, Thanks for a couple of great recent posts. I like seeing test data posted. A couple of questions. Are you using the default 8 and 8? Are you using BB? Are you using a specific indicator for your tests or did you create the rsi crosses from scratch?

--- 帖子 #641 ---
All I am using is the RSI/MA 8 crossovers according to the Fozzy E-book. No Bollinger Bands or additional indicators, and yes I did create them from scratch. Some of this is backtesting and some forward. Have been trading live with this system on and off for about a month or two.

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Rosco_P, Thanks for the info.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Over the past couple of days, I had an oppurtunity to go over some of my results on the North Finance MT 4 Platform. I noticed that the NF MT4 platforms prices were on average 2-3 pips different than the SB MT4 and my brokers quotes as well. Also, that many of the crosses on my charts were non-existent. Moreover, when coupled with their Sunday Candle the RSI/MA crosses produced much different results. So please take time and go over your particular charting software to ensure that any system designed with Fozzy in mind as the base will work for you.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Rosco_P.............thanks for sharing this with us. This is something we have discussed here before, and IMO only serves to emphasize the need to use this method in a very "personalized" manner. Broker feed and timing does make a difference! "Your results may vary"

Did anyone have a GBP/USD and USD/JPY Fozzy cross yesterday? The MT4 that I use had a broker feed issue on August 2nd and the daily numbers were terribly skewed and I am concerned that my charts are not accurate at the moment.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
I had "completed" crosses on Friday for both of these pairs. I did not trade either because I didn't like what the 4 hour chart was telling me. HTH!

--- 帖子 #654 ---
BB-Thanks for the reply. Now I know I was not alone.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
The GBP/USD cross was barely a cross on the daily chart, almost a bounce. I never consider it a cross unless the difference between the RSI and its average is at least 5 or 6 points. Not to mention that there was Fibo. convergence there. And the candles showed a very unhealthy rise. Long shadows showing the uncertainty. THe USD/JPY, even though the cross was a little more pronounced, was still less than 3 points in a consolidating market. Not a good idea...

--- 帖子 #656 ---
My FXDD demo account charts showed the opposite: GBP/USD cross, USD/JPY bounce. But today's 4 hour on the USD/JPY yielded 70 pips, while the 4 hour kept me out of a GBP/USD trade. Please comment on: "I never consider it a cross unless the difference between the RSI and its average is at least 5 or 6 points."

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Weird. I use FXDD's demo account as well... I attached an example. The first highlighted on cross on June 25 had a RSI of 72.79 and a RSI average of 74.40. For me, that's too close to be considered a cross. I still see it as a bounce. What I do is give 2 extra candles for the RSI and its average to separate more. Using the same cross as above, by waiting an extra day, at the end of June 26, the RSI is 58.59 and the average is 70.89. That's plenty of separation, so I would open a short position at the opening of June 27. The thirdhighlighted cross on Aug. 3 shows what waiting often helps me avoid. The RSI was 25.43 and the average 27.97 at the end of the day. So I would wait for better separation and sure enough, it bounced back. The second highlighted example on July 18 is a perfect example of my waiting. There's a short cross, but it's too tight of a cross for me. So I would wait. At the close of the next day, it's still too tight. I always allow for a maximum of 2 extra candles. After that, I don't take the cross no matter what. In this case, at the close of the 2nd extra candle on July 20, there's plenty of separation so I would open a position on July 23. While this way sometimes gets me in too late and creates a losing trade, it helps me avoid many bad signals, especially when the pair is consolidating.

--- 帖子 #663 ---
I took the cross on the Yen last night, and the carry trades are unwinding quite a bit today, so that was a good one! Also, I want to note, I am not using the BB to filter trades. I wanted to just place a few trades on the cross only to get a feel for how they work. Another nice cross would have been short EUR/USD on the 9th (last week) but I wasn't trading this system then! Doh!

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Well things are looking good. 1st TP reached and profit booked. Break even on the rest. Where to now? The daily chart offers a clear exit IF WE GET THERE. From here on I will be following a 4H for any sign of the run up ending. I did not take the GBP/USD, mores the pity. For those in this trade I offer this interpretation. Downtrend line @ 2.0150 Aug 8 low @ 2.0156 Aug 10 low @ 2.0153 61.8R 2.0462 to 1.9652 @ 2.0153 50%R 2.0652 to 1.9652 @ 2.0152

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Hi BB, No problem. Think I'll pass on USD/JPY. At the risk of missing a quick move I figure I can get in higher up. You're putting me on the spot for fib levels BB. At present the best I can offer is 108.92 to 110.24 A bit more price action needed. Some sort of a bounce would be nice. How's your own analysis with fibs doing?

--- 帖子 #671 ---
I'm in this trade because both the Monthly and Weekly charts support the downtrend of the Daily; but because the price has already reached down to almost the 61.8 fib level, I am very carefully watching the PA AND my S/L. We'll see......

Hi all, Looks like to cross GBP/USD on daily chart today. Will anybody take tihis trade?

--- 帖子 #674 ---
Hi rosso.... Have to see where the day ends still.....yet for me, I'll stay on the side lines...only because it has not met my criteria of crossing from 80/20. Looks in a range.....I am a short term/scalper/day trader though......for me to take a DAILY longer term Position, I really cherry pick An example would be the mid/late July cross' near the top ( OB ), and the Aug20th cross' near the short term bottom ( OS ). Also the late June07 cross would be an example.....stopped out on that one. But, as Meatloaf said: "2 outta 3 ain't bad!" Good Luck Fxj P.S. The Cable is a bit volatile for my old blood, so I took smaller positions. Those have been my only 3 trades with cable since learing this Technique, so I don't have a long term track record. Hope my thoughts helped in some small way...

--- 帖子 #686 ---
Glad u liked it and got a good profit. Hopefully I can find a few more to post. Whether they all go as well as that one remains to be seen. More and more I find myself looking for fozzie sells on the 4H. Thats not to say I don't watch the daily charts, its just easier to find turning points off larger time frames, like the last USD/JPY weekly and then try to get in on a shorter TF. More profit, smaller stops. And from my style of trading I find it easier to analise fibs on a 4H. Will be studying charts hard at weekend.

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Hey all, Just wanted to let anyone interested in smaller frames...day trades or scalping. This method works well on the 15 also. The one thing that we tweaked the past week or so, take trades in direction of the short term trend. Found that trying to catch reversals ended up being non productive, and took our focus off other pairs. EXCEPT reversals off of the RSI 15 or &lt; and 85 or &gt;. Trades from last 2 days for review....REMEMBER this is a 15 minute Fozzy....notice a few added indicators to filter out short term noise. Still "working" on those longer time frames BB!.... Fxj

Lately I find myself looking at the 4 hour chart more and more after seeing possible trade setups on the Daily; as with this recent sell of the USD/JPY. And I am paying more attention to Price Action as I become more familiar with this very powerful tool. Thanks for your contributions!

--- 帖子 #689 ---
Always enjoy your observations. Which time frame do you use to establish "The Trend" before looking at the 15 minute chart? Also, not sure why you have the CCI on your chart; it looks like a smoothed out version of the RSI (8).

--- 帖子 #690 ---
Hey BB... I look at the 4h and 1h....Posting a 4 hour chart....it is the same as in the post above, just blown up to 4 hour. I left the text, arrows, X's and trade numbers as they appear on the 15m chart above, just got rid of the Vertical 15 yellow lines. The CCI...yep, it is very close.....the thing is, in a smaller time frame....the cci and 8/8 cross DONOT always happen on the same bar close....it is a double confirmation.....why you may see on some of my chart postings that the 8/8 triggered yet a postion was not taken until another bar over. Also, seems best ( in lower time frames ) when the cci is rising from/thru -100 and falling from/thru +100 along with an 8/8 cross. Now some trades are taken on an 8/8 cross and cci - in between - This is DISCREATIONARY.... and trades are taken at the S/R ema's....especially in a nicely moving trend. I am a more visual trader...also the reason for the RSI 15/85 limits....for visualization reference and knowing the "market" is in need of a correctional bounce or reversal. Found that 70/30 or even 80/20 is far too soon....to go "against" the trend. Damn, I hope I didn't confuse anybody....I'd make a piss poor teacher! One thing for all too remember....I am a discreationary trader , and I am also following IFR reports of market objectives, stop areas, Option levels, news times, ( I don't trade news, just aware of releases )etc.... Overall....what I really wanted to convey was how well this method works in the short term.....even 5min TRUE scalps ( 5 pips+/- ) in a slow moving sideways market, ranging 20 pips+/-( ie..5pm to 1am edt )......That is another conversation all together!! DON'T TRY this with a 4pip spread on usd/jpy!!!!! I have 1.6 - 1.8....and eur/usd now around 0.9 - 1.2. OK, rambled enough!! Fxj

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Nice explanation, thanks!

--- 帖子 #692 ---
This is the 1 hr chart of the 15 min posted a few posts back. Posting them now side by side. Actually, on top of each other. 1. Notice the 8/8 cross occuring after a deep penetration of 1h RSI&lt;15. The 15m and 1h coincide, and the 4 hr had hit the RSI 15 during it's time frame. 2.Notice on 1h that the 8/8 cross did not occur with the CCI...yet in the 15m it did. Coming off that pin, &lt;15 RSI, 15m cross....this is where discreation comes in, on the smaller frames. 3. On the 4h chart, the 8/8 cross and CCI &gt;-100 did not happen on the same bar close, yet the 1h had occured. I seperated where the 1hr 8/8 cross took place ( red ) Other than adding the red verticle line and adding (15m ) to the text of the pin ( to denote location )....No retouch of original entries,exits...etc....one can see how nicely all fall onto several time frame charts. Hoping the pictures speak louder than words Fxj P.S. If one were to look at charts at end of trading Friday...far right....1h has crossed...CCI confirms...( thinking short?? for Sun/Mon ) Keep your safties ON for now.

Hey BB ! Been working on the longer terms....4 hour! Just an update....this pair scares the hell outta me, and I missed the Cable move.....1226am EDT

--- 帖子 #696 ---
This one is called "The Dragon" for good reason, but I like it. I do not trade directly off the Daily; I will wait for the Daily to "setup" and then drop to the 4 hour for agreement and a signal, but you will need larger stops to avoid hourly whipsaw activity.............the profits are well worth the risk. Good MM is always a requirement! PS...........I traded the GBP/USD using the 4 hour PB.

--- 帖子 #697 ---

Great post.............did you take the short and then the long?

--- 帖子 #700 ---
Here is a pair I don't see chatted about or traded much.....yet is one I really like. It is trading in a down trend channel, since about June...though channel not identified till mid July.....Bottom has been good support creating bounces for some very nice pips. One will notice, the Fozzy cross not great at all, yet minorly positive, cci positive....yet it was the channel bottom I traded off of with the "weak" support of my indicators. Plus I did get a bounce off of my rsi &lt;15. Just another tool. Post for review.....Fxj

You also took advantage of what some would loosely call "Price Action".......

--- 帖子 #702 ---
Just wanted to say you guys have been doing an incredible job diving in and out of these pairs, snatching up the pips I don't think I could ever copy what FxJ does though You must really live on those small TFs! =)

Absolutely. I really should take this up for a living. Oh forgot, I do. Congrats on the dragon trades. To much of a white knuckle ride for my multiple lot trading style.

EURJPY But yes, was a very nice trade...I think it coincided with that USDJPY 114 PB / 1h BUOB Still not sure about trusting 4h fozzy tho It seems so...cross-happy It IS the very same setting as for daily, right?

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Yes, same settings. 4 hour works best on a pair with higher volatility, i.e. GBP/JPY; it's like trading the Daily on a slower pair.

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Thanks BB! No idea if this will go anywhere, but....2x4h PB, fozzy cross, fozzy spike PB... Is this a valid one for sane people, too? ;p

--- 帖子 #711 ---
For me, this is an "add to" signal because I am already long on this pair:

--- 帖子 #712 ---
legit? DBLHC off the TL and retrace from current move BB WHERE ART THOU

--- 帖子 #713 ---
Hi Mike.............I was sleeping......zzzzzzzzzzzzzz! This pair is different with the Fozzy. I'm not sure why, but I trade "with" the Daily Chart. On the 26th. there was a nice bearish PB followed by a rather large BEB; for me that is a signal to look on the 4 hour for bearish trades. Your DBLHC was against all that and was hitting a trend line I had on my charts. So NO, for me not a legit trade; sorry!

--- 帖子 #714 ---
It was the first pair that had a fozzy 4hr cross since I started watching lol I hate eur/gbp, thought maybe fozzy could change my mind Thanks for the analysis. I will continue to watch the crosses on the 4hour see if I see anything that fits in nice Thanks B

--- 帖子 #715 ---
I'm not a BIG fan of this pair either, but it CAN be Fozzy traded, just requires some practice. Have a great weekend!

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Hi BB &amp; mbq, With the eur/gbp....I have been working with and studying this pair of late. I am short 3 lots from .7024. I have found, that for a Long Term trade, going up to the MONTHLY Charts, working down to the weeklies , and trading from signals on a daily may hold some decent promise. BB...Your TL up coincides closely with the 200 monthly SMA @ .7034...STRONG Resistence along with an OB daily. The placement of my Sell Lmt was set after the daily PB on the 26th which did give a sell signal....yet on the weeklies and monthly....for this pair, which moves a bit slower than most....200monthly had not been tested enough ( only once ), I placed my Sell just below 200 to be onboard and a stop above to get out if rally broke thru. Going to post a chart for review...if you both have questions, I can probably answer them better than just rambling away here. I never meant to post this trade....not many follow it, yet I saw your discussions, and thought this might help. Fxj FYI...notice cci divergence and rsi 8 divergence after 8/8 cross.... BB...is your posted chart above a daily?....5p close? They look a bit different. Oanda , charts are midnight edt....of course these are NF freebie charts 5pm edt close. UPDATE: Notice on the daily....the 200daily sma was support and than the 8/8 cross up at approx .6765. YES there was a 8/8 cross down just prior....yet far to close to support to have warrented a short, IMO. I did not trade that long cross earlier this month....eurbp was not on my list, though I was doing a FAILED experiment that had nothng to do with this method.

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Other than the trade I am short in the Post above..... These are examples .... I DIDNOT trade these ..... was research only .....Thou helped me with current trade.....notice how 200sma in either time frame is respected. and TL tests usually have an 8/8 cross soon after. Small sampling, I know.....couldn't fit an entire decade or two!! I am short for now...have no bias, if it turns with a decent cross, I will go with that....though for now, I'd target the fib retracements and ultimately a retest of the Mon TL break.

--- 帖子 #718 ---
FxJ.............good info on this pair; no time for additional comment now, but I will post more later. My chart posted above is 4 hour (5 PM ET close, FXDD feed) because Mike had asked about a signal on this time frame; like you, I trade this pair off the higher time frames; EUR/CHF too.

--- 帖子 #719 ---

Another awesome fozzy 4 hour short~

--- 帖子 #732 ---
Very nice: simple and successful!

--- 帖子 #733 ---
is this a valid cross?

--- 帖子 #734 ---
shrombe7....................at what time during the 'Trading Day' do you usually make a decision about a "valid" cross based on your Fozzy-style trading strategy?

--- 帖子 #735 ---
It's a valid cross but "iffy" because of the volatility of the carry trades. If you downshift to a 4 hour chart you would have had an entry on the last candle around 165.11 and you could have entered then with a trailing stop of say + 10 and let it ride. A safer approach. I've been trading the Fozzy 4hr for several months after trading the Dailies for 9 months or so. It just gives you a more timely entry. BB has been advocate of this and rightly so....

--- 帖子 #736 ---
The price on the 4 hour is positioning for a 'breakout' of the wedge.

I know it is early to complete cross ( nearly 5 hrs ealry for new candle). this is my first time using fozzy and I don't want to be in bed at cross time. also I am confused as a Sunday candle is present (it really confuses me .. is it considered a day or not). but the wedge tell all. thanks good article ShadyChars thanks

--- 帖子 #739 ---
BB recommends to all Sunday Candleholders to set up a demo account with FXDD where there are no Sunday Candles. It does seem to make a difference. The movement in the EJ over the past 1/2 hour is why its wise not to jump the gun on your Daily Bread err..candle crosses I use the CCI as confirmation of entry and I like to see movement pushing down towards the 0 line and not hugging the + as is the case at the moment.

Some times I the 4 hour fozzy cross for lets say a buy signal and then look at the daily chart which is giving a conflicting signal i.e. the sell signal. What would you guys recommend in this case? should one take the 4 hour cross if the daily chart or the hourly chart are giving different signals? Thanks.

Outside from reading the entire 4 hour thread~ My simple answer would be to study the charts for many months and get comfortable with what they are telling you. For example, if a pair is in a strong trend it would be wiser to trade in the direction of the trend. Philmcgrew, posted this statement recently- I buy dips on uptrends, sell peaks on downtrends, trade tops and bottoms in choppy markets, and trade breakouts in flat ones Now go read the Fozzy threads

In my quest to be a longer term trader, I have chosen to take positions in pairs that I do not day trade or scalp. So Far, I have been in ( for myself ) long term trades in the eur/gbp and the eur/chf. Posting The eur/chf for review....1st, I noticed a " possible " Pin Bar on this pair than waited for an 8/8 cross...the cross came a few days later, yet crossed under rsi 50. So I waited to see if this was a correction..., I kept the pair on my radar screen, studied the fundies a bit, waited....and than I noticed that a " possible " channel was being formed. I placed an equidistance channel on the info I had available at the time....rec'd a cross above rsi50 close to the bottom of the channel. Entered a Buy Limit at the 8ema for trade number 1. Trades 2 and 3 buy orders where placed the same, at the 8ema...after positive crosses. Trailing stops moved accordingly ( as shown ) after the 5pmNY close. I have begun to notice " possible divergence " on the cci, and the rsi is +80....this has caused me to tighten my trailing stop this evening to lock in some nice profits on all three trades, instead of using the channel bottom/21ema as a TS. I know for many....1 month may not seem like a LONG TERM trade.....Yet for myself....it seems like a year! Unlike a usd/jpy trade I had on several months back....I have not adjusted position sizes, only my STOPS....and I have avg'd up into the trade. If difficult to see: Trade 1 was entered 1.6430 Trade 2 was entered 1.6534 Trade 3 was entered 1.6643 Current trailing stop for all 3 trades is set at 1.6706 as of posting. UPDATE: Trailing Stop Moved To 1.6726 @ 0945 am 10/11/07 - 2nd update....moving stop very tight to 3ema at 1.6761 as of 845pm edt 10/11/07, High bounced off of channel top. Posting Charts for review... Fxj FYI...a few trailing stops were deleted off the chart, as the information became to cluttered. The eur/gbp trade is still in play, with a very tight Trailing stop due to an 8/8 cross...only 2 of the 3 lots remain ( the eur/gbp trade was not avg'd into ) UPDATE: eur/gbp Trailing stop triggered overnight @ .6944

--- 帖子 #745 ---
Hi Ricardo. I will see if I can add to the already good information that has been given here. When we look to take a trade on any TF we must take one large factor into account; and that is: The trend on a weekly is more significant than the daily The trend on a daily is more significant than the 4H The trend on the 4H is more significant than the 1H Etc... So what this means to you and this is how I do things; pick a Tf to trade. If you are more apt to trade the 4H charts then trade the 4H charts. Use the Daily and Weekly charts to gain insight to areas of S/R, Trend, Possible divergence etc. But make your trade decisions based on the 4H chart. Additionally it would behoove you to take signals in the direction of the prevailing trend. And be cautious when going against it. Remember a 4H chart is going to show intraday (sort of) trends that are occuring on a daily and weekly chart. So yes you will get conflicting signals when looking at the Fozzy or any other method/indicator. Use the higher TF's to gain insight but make your decisions on entering and exiting based on your chosen TF. i.e. 4H charts. Hope this helps, Steve

Trader V... Very good advice about the time frames and being aware of the higher trends!! Posting a chart of the eurusd 15 minute trades I made last night. Trade #1 was taken on a cross of the 8/8 from very OS levels....YET, the higher frames....1 hr and 4 hour were UP. Even an old dog like myself can forget to check the higher frames....which is exactly what I did!! It cost me 15 pips. So very timely info as a reminder....and yes....it matters not the method used. Thx! Now, as a disclaimer for myself....I trade both ways, yet was not cautious of the higher trends....had I been, my Target would have been a bit more reserved...maybe 10-15 pips vs. 30. Trade #2 was taken with the knowledge...Though I jumped on a divergence and a possible restest of the price break/resistence out from 1.4171. AND WOULDN"T YA KNOW IT.....as I was getting this chart together, thinking it to be a slow afternoon......look what has just happened at the right of this chart!!!!!!!!:surprised Fxj

--- 帖子 #747 ---
Hey man nice trading today. I don't normally trade smaller time frames due to my schedule but I wanted to point out what I saw with this trade and possible reasons for not taking that initial short position. Please don't take this as a criticism. I am just sharing my views so togehter not only will we become better traders but we may help those who read this as well. Ok so on my chart I used the same TF you have of 15M so we are looking at the same stuff. On the far left you will se an area of previous resistance which was broken by the move whee you entered. On that bearish bar that you took your trade on I would have ben hesistant trading into what could now become support. Also looking down to CCI (I use 21) there is some notable divergence which indicates there may be a short afterall. Which is why I would not have taken that cross back up on the RSI indicated by the arrow. When this kind of thing happens A cross of RSI in a specific direction I look for a price action setup for additional timing and point of entry. I rarely enter at the open of the next bar or during a current bar. I prefer to set a buffer of a few pips below or above the bar that is giving me the signal. So in this case where you entered your short I would have placed a Sell Stop a few pips below that bar indicated by the arrow. One other thing to note is that bar had a weak closing. In other words it did not close near the btoom of that range which also takes away from the faith I would have in the short. But my position of a Sell Stop would have kept me out of the trade. I hope this comes across clearly sometimes I ramble a bit and things get jumbled. Steve

I took a daily fozzy long on Eur Usd and a short on GY. Anybody here with me? I think at least for the Euro, the uptrend resume is obvious, since it went down to 38% of the last upward move, then reversed nicely 3 days ago. Thanx to Jacko and 4H Fozzy, I managed to squeeze this reversal long time before the daily fozzy cross, which proves again the importance of Fozzy 4H strategy. thanx again BB. About the GY short, Im not so sure, it might be a fake move down or just a retracement to 89 sma and not a real downtrend resume, but I will go with it. As long as RSI 8 stays above the 60 level on Daily, I assume the trend is up.

--- 帖子 #749 ---
Believe it or not I am with you. I got in on the Euro a little later than you id though. I use the daily charts quite a bit and will sometimes zoom into the 4H for additional timing. Now that being said I still would have entered in the same price zone that I did even if I were on a 4H based on areas of S/R.Currently at +42 and closed partial profit moving syop to +5. as for the GY This is a tricky bugger since we are in a long term up trend. We hit a double top on the monthly and possibly forming a H&amp;S pattern indicating a reversal. Looking at the weekly it seems as if we may have completed the pull back and are headed north again. If in fact this is the start of a reversal I am not jumping rith in. I have a Sell Stop placed below the most recent support at 236.38. Now mind you even if I get entered in this trade I will be watching it closely because as we all know S/R is a ZONE not a specific price. That being said it may have a hard time breaking through the 234.64 area. I ave seen Jacko mentioned a few times, what exactly is this method and where can I read about it? Good trades to all and to all a good night! Steve

Hey Trader V.. I hear you. I had R1 as 1.4185....seemed it held when I got the 8/8 cross from OS levels....yet if I looked at the higher charts, the trend was really strong. Most times the best trades like that one come with divergence, which happened on my trade #2 and also at R2 which I had around 1.4214....though I had to have a nap for the bounce back off R1. No worries on Rambling....I can ramble with the best of 'em!! Fxj

--- 帖子 #753 ---
I started playing with the Price Action at the advice of BB ( to whom I thank a lot) and recently I made some great trades using PBs, and other reversal candles at Fibonacci levels, and Fozzy crosses. For example today we had great reversal signals for AU, NU, GY and EY, Usd Cad. I will post here the setup for Usd Cad, which I consider the best looking one. Entered short at 0.9800.

--- 帖子 #754 ---
A quick basic questiion - In the MA for Fozzy method should it be EMA or just a basic MA ? Also can some one explain how to combine CCI with the fozzy cross ? I see them in the charts you all post but not sure how to combine it as a filter for the cross. Thanks a lot.

--- 帖子 #755 ---
Hi, first I want to thank anyone in advance for their comments... OK, PA with Fozzy cross. DBHLC (not perfect though, 7 pips difference). I'm thinking of selling if it retraces 50% of the DBHLC around .9220 with stop above 61.8% around .9265 and target the 50% retracement and also previous high at .9050. It might never get there but that's how much risk I'm willing to take on a trade against the trend. This is demo only. Sebastien

--- 帖子 #756 ---
My application of PA in this kind of situation is to sell a break of the low of the previous large Bearish candle (.9106). I'm looking to sell just below .9100.

--- 帖子 #757 ---
Yes sure, many will wait for a break of the low but I have read that Jim also wait for a retracement, that way you sometimes miss the boat but on such large bar you can get in with a smaller stop but hey I'm no expert, have just been reading and practicing the suff taught in the James 16 thread. If you play the break of the low, may I ask you where would you put your stop? Using the ATR20? But more than anything, I want to take this occasion to thank you for your great post about Fozzy and price action. I've printed it and studied it a lot. Now, I do the same with nice results so far (on demo!). Sebastien

--- 帖子 #758 ---
Thanks for the compliment! If I enter below .9100, I will use a rather tight stop; .7 x ATR (20) = 85 pips. First T/P will be .8900. Also, take a look at the Weekly chart........

--- 帖子 #759 ---
Wow! We could be in for a major correction if not some kind of reversal... You know, I've failed so many times taking counter-trend trades that I aim at very conservative targets when I still find the courage to do it. So I've had already close half for 70 pips (70 X ATR 20 and more than my stop) and move stop to b/e. But I will definitly leave the rest running if this potential pin happens and breaks! Thanks again. Sebastien

--- 帖子 #760 ---
I've been following this thread with great interest. I took my first trades on Monday (last) 10/29/07 with GBP/USD. 3 positions with escalating TP. I'm still in on the final position. TP both the other two. My goodness!! I'm sold! Anyway... I read in here somewhere that position should be initiated AFTER the 8/8 cross. But, if using Bollinger Band on RSI, position should be initiated if 8/8 cross is in either the above MA (for short) or the below MA (for long) to filter further false signals. Can anyone please tell me if I have this correct....or if I have the initiate signal backwards? This is a great forum. Great, great posts! The contributors make this site what it is. I'm glad &amp; thankful to be a part of it. Thanks for including me. Peter O.

--- 帖子 #761 ---
Greetings all. Not posted for a while. Been busy trying to figure out how to spend all the money I've made on GBP/USD. What a great fozzy trade this has been. Which brings me nicely to the topic of this piece of rambling. I closed out my last lot Fri eve. The chart reveals an ever steepening climb. Looks like everyone chasing a runaway train. And we all know what happens next. I could well be wrong but I am expecting a pullback before the next leg up to my ultimate target. If this is a valid H &amp; S the measured move is 2.1095. A 1.618 ext is at 2.1023, a 1.0 exp at 2.1089. Call it 2.11. Big round number. If I can get back in on a pullback, say to 2.0650 (July high) there's a nice R/R to be had. Time will tell. If I'm wrong, enjoy the extra pips fozzy followers. I'm sure BB will split his share with me. Monthly chart paints a nice picture.

Looking for a short here. Actually, I could have gone short yesterday after the cross was confirmed but since we were in a range I didn't. Now we have closed below the 365 ema and the rsi has broken it's support line. We have also broken a trendline. We are still in the range though.... So shorting below yesterday's low would be the safest trade to take? Any comments? Many thanks. Sebastien

OGW..... Don't know what you rules are, but I have already taken 100 pips out of this short. A pin bar followed by a cross works nicely for me.

--- 帖子 #767 ---
Well done! Thanks to the chinese news, I just got some pips myself. Now will try to sell again at the range break area and first target a fib extention at around 2.3620. I think this pair is heading much lower. My rules are the simple Fozzy cross combined with PA and I also use fibs. But I am not done testing so this is just demo for now. Beach Bum, was that pin you mentionned on the daily?

--- 帖子 #768 ---
Yes!

--- 帖子 #769 ---
Sorry to bother you, but are you talking about the one on november first? And mind asking if your out now? (I guess not), if not what are you targetting? Sebastien PS I'm always happy when answer my question but please don't feel any pressure to do so as I can guess how busy you are trading and helping out a lot of people here. Once my rules are better defined, I would love to post them and have some feedback if possible.

Hi again! OK, I just got a demo with FXDD and I can now see the very nice pin that you mentioned. It didn't look that nice on Northen Finance. I'm also happy not to have a sunday bar anymore. Thanks to all the nice info you have been posting! Sebastien

Hi OGW, I took 3 contracts @ 0.00 GMT and the last one closed out sometime yesterday for a total of +431. I'm quite impressed with the performance characterists of Fozzy. I'm concentrating on taking the rules as presented in thread entry #1, and refine my interpretation &amp; application accordingly. Now, I took some hits overnight. Entered early on USD/JPY, got stopped out, then missed 175 pip short opportunity last night after a bona fide cross. So, it's my application which needs work. I think the system is all there. I sincerely hope that this thread continues for a while. I find this entire site quite helpful, informative, etc. The hosts need a round of applause from the viewers &amp; contributors. Well done indeed! Good luck &amp; good trading. Peter O

Hi Peter, congrat on your gbp-chf trade. You hold it well! Yeah, it would be nice to see more people start posting again. Sebastien

--- 帖子 #773 ---
Yeah....Same thing happened Wed. P.M with a EUR/JPY cross. 28 MA was e v e r s o s l i g h t l y "implying" downward direction at 0.00 GMT +/-. Check with 4hr. comfirmed, though., so I took the trade. Proceeded to drop like a rock, (this is good) then retraced (not so good). So....moral of the story....wait for CONFIRMATION of the cross in upper band of BB. If I'd waited a day, I'd still be in the trade &amp; deep in the pips. Instead, I got in too early &amp; got stopped out around + 25, thanks to my trailing stop. Need, also to re-look at initial SL setting. I wonder if 70% of ATR, or Hi/low of previous day is enough. Maybe project a 50% fib way way out there &amp; cover my eyes. Tough to sit &amp; watch the draw down....but the system, for me anyway, hasn't given a false signal yet...eventually. My interpretation, on the other hand, needs work. So, after this week, I'm gonna assume the system is right 99.94% &amp; draw down is fact of life, but no losses if you don't close....only a lot of red ink on the books for a while. But, in theory....no worries!!!! Right! This long weekend dedicated to close analysis of these Fozzy trades I've taken. If I discover any Rosetta Stones, I'll gladly share with you, my new friends on this great site. Thats what demo account is for, right? Whip it &amp; drive it &amp; risk money like it isn't even mine, like a liberal with a new matching grant! Have a good weekend folks. Return Monday ready again to rock! Peter O.

I hold my hands up. I got out too early. Have to say I am suprised that the rally managed to push on up without any meaningfull pullback. Even more so that it got up as far as 2.1160. No retracement to get back in on. Overrun my 2.1100 target. Wrong on both counts. Sob sob. You were right BB. What goes up must come down. And down it came, in a hurry.

--- 帖子 #775 ---
No need for tears pf................I know you have profited from this pair! What has surprised me this week is the gap from Friday till Sunday was not filled..............not yet anyway.............. PS.......I'm beginning to like the "Fozzy trend line" break too!

--- 帖子 #776 ---
Thought I was losing my touch. Then again, maybe not. And here's the bounce. Thanks to FxJarhead for making me look at the smaller timeframes. Also BB. One of his favourite pin bars.

--- 帖子 #777 ---
I do too! And thanks to your posts. Also, at times the rsi shows you some familiar patterns and some a little less familiar but still interesting... Sebastien

Hi, I'm looking at EUR/CHF. It's been great all last week, but the 28MA wasn't in line till Thursday close. In keeping with my test, I stayed out. Subsequently missed a terriffic week if had been short. Might need to re-look at importance of this indicator. See the frequency of if I ignore it, or anticipate it, how often I'll blow-up. Going to ignore the BB rule, though. The cross is in lower band for this short. But, it signaled correctly early last week.....and again with the 28 MA...so, out I stayed. Go to weekly &amp; monthly charts.....daily says LT trend is up. But weekly &amp; monthly charts say LT trend is really DOWN...&amp; has been since the stone age. So, I think I'm in at Sunday EST open with a entry stop at Friday low. Set SL at Thursday high &amp; let 'er rip. Comments? Suggestions? Good luck this week folks. Peter O

I haven't seen a "confirmed" cross of the RSI and MA for over two weeks; it's been all downhill since that last cross.

--- 帖子 #780 ---
Hi, I put in a sell stop at 1.6330 on Sunday-Monday GMT. Hasn't hit the target yet. Order still pending. It's certainly threatening to do it though. Interesting how the Fozzy rules, when followed correctly, don't usually lead one astray. I need to trust the system more and less my own optimistic anticipation. The pips aint mine till they're in my account. Good luck all. Peter O

--- 帖子 #781 ---
If you're using a Daily Fozzy method, there is no basis for a sell order. I'm waiting for a "Buy" signal.

--- 帖子 #782 ---
Now you have my attention, BeachBum. I'll look things over. You're ready for a long &amp; I'm waiting for a short. Perfect opportunity to review interpretations of the rules &amp; how they are applied. And on charts, which signals apply &amp; which don't. I'm trying like h&amp;%$ to learn. But, if we're each waiting for a different move, and EUR/CHF hasn't done squat all week.....hmmm. Time to re-read the rules. Discovery of this site was a gift. Thanks, BeachBum &amp; everyone who contributes. Peter O

--- 帖子 #783 ---
This chart shows how I have traded this pair on the Daily chart; as soon as the 5 EMA crosses the 8 EMA, I will consider a Buy (oops.......have I failed to mention those two EMAs before?........... )

--- 帖子 #784 ---
No cross, but came across this and immediately thought of BB https://media.expty.com/RFSImages/ba...i-crib2New.jpg

--- 帖子 #785 ---
Don't you mean a SHORT?

--- 帖子 #786 ---
Sweet...........thanks SL! BTW...........et_phonehome_2; exactly what are you calling SHORT?

--- 帖子 #787 ---
The 5/8 EMA cross would be a short position, you had a long position.... Nice to relax when earning those PIPs...

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Actually I was waiting for the 5 to cross UP over the 8, which it almost has on the Daily chart. But since I like using 4 hour charts to get a jump on my Fozzy-style trades, I entered this morning.

--- 帖子 #789 ---
There are really numerous variations to basic Fozzy rules; here's another: nanningbob's 1 over 5 and the Synergy indicator.

--- 帖子 #790 ---
Nice trade BB....I got in on this one too!!

--- 帖子 #791 ---
Sorry, but how is the Fozzy Method or the link.. thanks.

--- 帖子 #792 ---
Look back two posts to #789 and click on the big HERE at the bottom in BeachBum's signature.

--- 帖子 #793 ---
i wasnt see that, really thanks

--- 帖子 #794 ---
Here's a nice cross.

--- 帖子 #795 ---
Hi, where i can find the indicators for this system?

--- 帖子 #796 ---
Where have you looked?

--- 帖子 #797 ---
Yeah, I took that one. This was/is my first Fozzy trade after reading the whole thread. I based my trade on the Fozzy cross (obviously), the pin bar formation, retracement to the 38.2 fib line, and solar wind approaching the zero line. Price also closed below the 5 SMA (which I don't require but during the retrace it had acted as support). I'm currently down 25 pips but I still think this was a good trade because I followed my rules. Which is most important - I know! My stop was about 107 pips (70% ATR plus took into account the 38.2 fib line). My 3% per trade risk rule allowed me to trade about three 0.3 mini lots. My t/p's are 0.9941 (70% ATR), 0.9891 (100% ATR), and on the last one I'm using a t/s of 70% ATR. I know some folks trade upwards of 20 pairs (I don't have a monitor big enough for that!) but i'm starting with following eight to learn off of: EURUSD, GBPUSD, AUDUSD, USDJPY, USDCHF, USDCAD, EURGBP, EURJPY. My goal with these is not to trade all of them at once (I've read a little about the dangers of currency correlation) but to find the best trade and take that one only . Sorry for the long post, but since this was my first trade I wanted to document it thoroughly and post it for constructive feedback if anyone has any. Thanks.

Hi Lincoln! Well tought trade. I just want a wish you good luck for your first fozzy trade! Sebastien

--- 帖子 #799 ---
Hello Lincoln10.... Trading this pair is always a challenge for me; I wish you the best with your first Fozzy-style trade! Your plan appears solid; stick to it. Right now there is support at the 1.000 level. I believe a break below that will provide opportunity for further price decline.

--- 帖子 #800 ---
Pure, clean, and simple. 1st TP 112.70 Next stop 111.50/80 Or possibly 110.00 All in one move?........ maybe. If not I'll just continue to sell rallies til proven otherwise.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Well we got to 110.00 in a hurry. Retest of the November lows next?

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Fozzy crosses in AUDUSD and NZDUSD?

--- 帖子 #363 ---
You are two days late on the NZD/USD. I'm already short AUD/USD, but not because of a Fozzy-style signal on the Daily chart. However, the Fozzy cross on Friday confirms my early entry and reinforces staying in the trade..............8675 is my final target price!

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) I guess its all about different broker

--- 帖子 #365 ---
FXDD for me!

--- 帖子 #366 ---
My NzdUsd short trade was stopped out at BE....... Hey Beachbum, do you mind to share the strategy that you used for your AudUsd trade. Maybe in a new thread? Thanks

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Is anyone still using the Fozzy method? (also known as 8and8). If so, how is it working for you? Have you made an tweaks or changes? Do you find it works better on some pairs than others, and if so which ones. Thanks in advance. I posted this on another thread, but I'm re-directed here...and it looks like a few of you are still using Fozzy. What tweaks have you made? What pairs do you use it on? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
A cross forming on GBPJPY for cca 50 pips?

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Greeting all. I suspect that this pair is one that not many of us trade, probably due to its almost tortoise like movement. However for those that took the recent short trade I have attached charts with my own analysis. My key levels are 0.7635 on the hrly and 0.7581 on the 4H and daily.
