Its hard not to win pips with this system ... if you do MTFs

This is one of the systems I use (a lot)

here it is an 30 min & 5 min charts

its hard not to make pips with this system.

I use 5 ema and 12 ema

(but if you like use 5 & 8 or 5 & 10 ema it doesn't really matter)

MTF is the point (Multi time frames)

I use the 20 RSI at 50

(if you want a letter win rate put 45 and 55 on the higher chart RSI )

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I trade two lot at a time

1st. lot target 10 pips + spread

stop loss 10 pips

2nd. lot move to break even when 1st lot is taken out

I then keep moving up the stop loss with every swing unill I am taken out.(ie in an up trend every swing lower)

If I can not be at my computuer

- I target the next round number (50 or 100 ie 1.3550 1.13600)

- S/R

Other stuff

1. better % on pull backs and break outs then on the crosses.

2. You need to know when to trade and when not to trade (very important )

-3am to 5am est

-7am to 12noon est

-maybe 8pm to 10pm, est

-no holidays

-Becareful of new events ie 8:30 am and 10:00am est

3. I trade only the big pairs,I trade mostly on the eur/usd !!!

the other two main ones would be usd/jpy and the eur/gbp

then if no trend on these I would look at the usd/cad or the aud/usd or the eur/jpy

Hi.

Seem like a simple+great syatem.

How long this system have been used by you?

--- 帖子 #3 ---
TEB..

Do you wait for the 30 min. candle to close and then drop to 5 minute for entry?

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Yeah TEB.

Simple is best, I am using 10, 25 & 150 EMA close.

Price breaks the 150 followed by the 10 and 25 ema and enter on pullback to 10, 25 05 150 ema.

After 2 years of racking my brains on this system or that, I end up with just 3 emas, S&R & last but certainly not least, Money management.

Of course many new people will still choose to believe mistakenly that, "It can't be that easy". It is!

keep it up TEB.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Hello Rastaman. What time frame you use for 10, 25 and 150 ema. looks good on H1.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
closed mostly (90%)

I have been known to get into it 25 mins into a 30 min candle if its a stronge move and candle.

TEB

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Sorry if this is a newbie question, but does it mean you make a trade every 30 minutes?

Or do you oly use the 30 min chart to see when the price goes up or down?

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Take the trend off the 30 min

and take buy sell signs off the 5 mins

if you want to trade the 30 min

use a 3 or 4 hour chart for trend

in other words if the trend chart is down you only sell

if its trending up you only buy.

you then look for the sign from the lower time chart

TEB

--- 帖子 #9 ---
No, he means if he is trading the M30 chart, he may enter a trade before the 30 min candle closes, if it has met his criteria. whatever that may be.

I am not sure if he is simply trading the crossover or the  pullback to the ema.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
if that is the case, no

on the trading chart

I always wait for the close

thanks

teb

--- 帖子 #11 ---
I waited until the 30 min candle closed (eur/usd), then entered a short on the open of the 5 minute candle. It retraced 7 pips and then went down, and after taking the first lot out at 10 pips, I used my own stop system and got another 22 pips on the second lot.

Great start. Thanks TEB.

Do you know what your winning % is using this method over the years?

--- 帖子 #12 ---
I see, thanks TEB.

It is a bit different and I suppose you don't trade the pullback with the 5 ema as price hardly ever leaves the ema.

A bit different than the system I am using.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
I in fact use the 12 ema on the 5 min chart as a target on the pull back

(on Oanda is easy just keep moving up your buy/sell order )

as long as the 5 min and 30 min rsi are good I keep moving the entery

Its the main way I trade this system

(and all systems now in fact)

so I have two enters 1. the cross over 2. the pull back

(in fact 3 enteries but the other one is a little harder its a break out trade 1.2.3 on the 5 min chart

also I will use candles .. in a later post)

TEB

--- 帖子 #14 ---
TEB

Can we use this system to trade on M1 chart? If yes, what TF should we use for trend direction?

~profi~

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Nice system. I use something similar 5ema(close)/8ema(open) on daily charts with confirmation on weekly. What can kill you is range situation. To avoid it, RSI and MTF are good tools. I used to add BBSqueeze also, but a simple ADX>20 can do the job.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Yes I do .

But its a 3rd chart

when I have a stronge trend on the 5 min and 30 min charts

I will open up a 1 min. chart

but I mostly trade the break on the one min.

not the cross or pull back

TEB

--- 帖子 #17 ---
ADX or Macd also work

The RSI is just so much simpler I find

But its a personal choice

( ADX 14 must be over 30 I have used )

TEB

--- 帖子 #18 ---
just so happened i made a indy for this long ago, i set defaults already

it just colors candles, has a lot calculator

however the alert true will draw arrows, it will not re enter, if u get a buy alert, the next alert wont accur unless its a sell

some1 will probly find it useful

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Thanks TEB.

Understand how it works now.

~profi~

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Sorry I missed your post

have both charts open

because you need to see when the trend changes on the higher chart.

The big red line on both the charts in the 1st post

is the down trend from the 30 min.

I just posted it on the 5 min chart as well

to see it

( I have big RED, BLUE And YELLOW lines on my charts

Red is down ... blue is up... yellow is stand a side becuse the RSI and EMA are not in agreement)

TEB

--- 帖子 #21 ---
TEB.. any idea what your winning % using this method has been over the years?

--- 帖子 #22 ---
If The 5 min and 30min charts are all good

I will also get in with stronge candle as well

these are the 5 main candles formations I would use

they would be on the 5 min chart.

Again when you have the 30 min and 5 min charts iin aggreement

its hard to lose

if you are not a "pig" !!!

--- 帖子 #23 ---
You can use that system on almost any system but of course, the longer the time frame the more accurate the price action is going to be.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
MTF is the key. Yes

when to enter in shorter TF is all about S/R

for Trending short = Sell at recent Support after the break on the pullback

for Trending long = Buy at recent  Resistant after the break on the pullback

all MA are just illusion.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
I am not sure what you mean here ?

but this looks like a good system

why don't you start a thread and show us how you do it .

teb

--- 帖子 #26 ---
what you say is good

but this system will work

wed on 8 trades I did 205 pips

thurday 14 trades 132 pip

( not all of the the trades were with this system but most were with 2 emas and one tool ..in the dead time a use Bbands and Stoch to trade with)

but I did 300 of the pips of those two days with two ema and a tool

cheers

teb

--- 帖子 #27 ---
what i meant is for simplicity , if u can draw horizontal line and identify where the break at then u are in the money

let me ask u , what if the price came back and trade above the break ?????

Are u still Selling ?????

That's why i said MAs are illusion

No Offense

--- 帖子 #28 ---
yes as long as the trend holds on 30 min and 5 min

of course because the % is in my fovour

in fact it might well me a pull back trade.

that does not mean I to not know where the R/S are

and if I get a 1.2.3. break in the opp way I will stop trading

often I find the second signal is great and it often pulls back  across the R/S back to the trend of the 30 min and 5 min  .

teb

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Have used this indi in the past and find in easier to use ..... hope it helps some ....

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Tomhliles,

for some reasons i cannot save your indy as mq4. i must have missed something. thank you for sharing.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
LoL

Yeah, sorry for cluttering up your thread.

I meant not to introduce another system but simply show how ema are effective as a pullback system, indeed as your system is.

Wishing you many pips, TEB.

Possibly you may find this EMA crossover alert indicator useful.

TEB63

Could you confirm your numbers and when did you enter that trade.  EURISD hasn't been down to 1.3018.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
should have been 1.3518 (missed the 5 sorry )

2nd lot closed at 1.3525 as the 5ema  crossed back over the 12ema

teb

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Hi Teb,

Why did you name this the 21 RSI when you actually use a 20 period RSI???

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Training wheels question for TEB or others.

I tried this today with some modest success during the New York session.

As the shorter timeframe builds the longer and thus the 5 minute trends before the 30, it seemed the trend on 5 min was prime for a retrace at about the time the 30 would alert.  With just a 10 pip SL I thought I could be taken out easily.

Do you, should you alternatively look for the first retrace and continuation as a much safer entry - or just boldly buy into 5 or so consecutive up/dwn candles?

I imagine this is one of those 'it depends' questions.  LOL

Thanks

--- 帖子 #42 ---
thats the point.

you get the trend 1st  ie the  30 mins

then buy into the trend ie. on the 5 mins;.

the 30 min must be happening 1st.

cheers

teb

--- 帖子 #43 ---
doesn't really matter I put 21 up by mistake

I use a 21 stoch

if you can and want to please change it to 20 rsi

thanks

teb

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Hey Teb,

I've enjoyed all of your systems and posts for a couple of years, and now that I'm a FF member I can express my appreciation.  Looking forward to more.

Rob

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Hello Teb,

Thank you very much for your help. I am following all system very simply and profit.

Regards.

Bülent

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Thanks teb... It´s for you.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Ok here is what you do

(* you can do it with two charts

or just one you flip back and forth to between 5 and 30 mins)

1. You look on the 5 min chart you are looking for trades

a. Rsi is down so I am only looking to go dowm

b. Prices under the 5ema under 12ema (stacked. Unless its a cross)

c. Go to the chart and look for trades

- crosses

- candle formations

- breaks etc

(see ie. in the boxes with lines on the 5 min charts)

2. Then check on the 30 min

a. Rsi is down so I am only looking to go dowm

b. Prices under the 5ema under 12ema (stacked. Unless its a cross)

*** If it is trending down on the 30 min take the trade..

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

you can do the times you like

natural times would be

`Month/week

`week/day

`day/4 hour(or hour)

`4 hour(or 3 hour) /1 hour(or 30 min)

`1 hour /15 mins

`30 mins(or 15 min)/5 min

`5 min/1 min

(never none it on a lower time frame)

BUT the Bigger time frames need bigger SLs and targets

that is why I like 30/5 mins and 5/1 mins.

cheers

hi guys

aud/usd is on a down trend after a rate increase?(on the 5 min chart)

things that make you go huuu?

And there is money coming.

teb

--- 帖子 #49 ---
AUDUSD is still in an uptrend, it's just bumping up against two strong downward resistance lines:  (best seen on Weekly) July '08 - November '09, and November '09 - January '10.  Last night's increase was anticipated so it was already built into the price.

Rob

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Hi Teb,

I am watching the AUDUSD as well using the 30 and 5 min with the 2 ema´s and the 21 RSI.

Don´t wanna bug you but it would be cool if you could post a screenshot how you trade this down move.

Right now RSI on the 30min is just below 50.

On the 5 min the RSI is down for approx. 45 min.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
BTW similar situation on the EUR/GBP.

Missed the SHORT around 0.883 though.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
I appreciate your insight into the live trading.

Testing the ema-rsi indicator shared earlier as a way to track multiple currencies by just using the faster time frame in the 5 min / 30 min pairing.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Here are the indicators I use for the method. As I said earlier, I personally use the 5ema(close)/8ema(open) crossover, but the 5 ema/12ema (close) gives similar results. The first MACD displays the crossover of the current TF and the second one 5 times higher (25ema(close)/40ema(open)). The arrows represent the same information so you can use wichever you prefer. I like to look at ADX, sometimes it helps to decide wether to enter or not. Also, the ATR value can be the first profit objective. On the 5min TF it equals often 10 pips as TEB suggests for targets.

up 51 pips !!!

I will be closing out 1/2 my trade at .9296

teb

--- 帖子 #55 ---
This is pretty much how you described it, right? I actually started taking trades earlier at the magenta arrow based on PA. Overall, I like it. Simple, manageable.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
More lovely easy to take trades...

on the eur/usd 1.3323

is a possible reveral point;

if so the whole market might reverse .

or not

1.3334 might be a lot of buyers

cheers

teb

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Teb..

The only problem I have is taking one lot out at 10 pips.. seems like when I have used this method, the overall % of the time that I get stopped out on the 2nd lot at break even is higher than if I had just stayed with 2 lots and either taken them both out at 10 pips or allowed them both to run.

Especially if I drop down to 5 min/1 minute for entries.

This system is very consistent in producing at least 10 pips per entry.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
1st lot taken out at 13 pips (?)

other 2 move up the stop up one swing low

teb

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Yes I understand

I should say "I do the EUR/USD 80%+ of the time"

For other pairs you need more

- for the USD/JPY or EUR/GBP or the EUR/JPY - 15 pip sl

(which would be the other three I do most of the time.)

- For the USD/CAD or AUD/USD a little more say 20

- For the BGP/USD or the EUR/CHF or the BGP/CHF at least 20

OR for an other way to do your SL

Put it below the the last swing on the 5 min, this is likely the best anyway.

BUT ... for the 1st lot always do 1:1 + spread

TEB

--- 帖子 #62 ---
2nd lot take out at 1.3361 (100% move of the 1 2 3 break )

3rd lot moves up I will let it let it swing out .

good day,

teb

--- 帖子 #63 ---
ok end of day

on this trade 3 lots in

1st lot 13 pips

2nd lot 26 pips

3rd lot still on

target 1.3397 (next round number)

stop loss 1.3343 (1 pip below last swing low)

done for the day see how it goes if it is a full market turn or not

teb

--- 帖子 #64 ---
What happens when u have a cross and the rsi dips sometime after, is it still valid signal ?

--- 帖子 #65 ---
That is the another PARALLEL TREND TRADING system...

You have to catch the point that has a same trend way at the different time frames.

I usually trade m5-m15, m15-H1, H1-H4....

For example, when cci 14 above 0 at m15, i wait it happen at m5, then i enter to trade. It is as same as both m15-H1 and H1-H4...

That is the way to win ....

I tried every systems. It is not necessary to make forex complicated...

Hehe hehe ...My hair turned to white to understand that...

--- 帖子 #66 ---
which RSI ?

-if the 30 min get out fast.

-if its the 5 min I would look to get out also

a. But likely wait one bar .

b. also I would see if its a news event.

I hope that helps

teb

--- 帖子 #67 ---
What are you saying ?

that this is to complex?

teb

--- 帖子 #68 ---
I mean, parallel trend trading is the simpliest way like the system that you attached. No problem with yours. I am glad to see this one. Keep it up please...

Hi everyone, i read this thread, i like the system, it's simple...

what about writing an EA with this strategy? I think that with an EA, we  can have backtest in the past and we can understand where it is  possible to get better this strategy...

TEB, can you programme? If someone can, please, share the EA in this thread

(in the ea we must have as parameters: Stop Loss, Take Profit, Trailing Stop, MoneyManagement, 4/5 digit broker, ema fast, ema slow, timeframe entry, timeframe "trend", rsi (period and value) )

Luca

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Is this sometimes repainting? I mean after one bar....

--- 帖子 #75 ---
You guys are doing a lot better than me - traded it for two days on quite a few pairs -50 odd pips

I did think i was following the rules properly as well. I used the last swing high/low for my SL

Will try again on Monday. Any pairs you would not use this method on Teb?

--- 帖子 #76 ---
This is a very simple system.....however it requires traders discretion....something that will never be able to be programmed into an EA, and something that does require a bit of screen time to develop.

The system is simple.....wait for a clear trend to identify itself on a higher time frame (this is something that requires traders discretion.....the slope of the EMAs will give a good hint).....then move down to a lower time frame and look for an entry. TEB has suggested......candle patterns, break outs, 123 patterns......all of these require a bit of traders discretion....something that can not be programmed into an EA....and something that will keep experienced traders out of a bad trade.

For instance an EA will not know that there is going to be an interest rate decision or a NFP announcement.

For those who are not winning with this simple system.....my suggestion is to trade 4 hour/1 hour......rather than 30 minute / 5 minute

Anyways....just my thoughts.....I bow to TEBs authority on this.

If you study most of TEBs threads....you will see......MTF

You will also notice on most of TEBs charts......very simple.....NOT a lot of indicators.......I would almost say there is a correlation....the more indicators....the less the trader is experienced in price action (candle patterns, break outs, support and resistance).....and I would think that one can NOT be successful without gaining some experience with price action for entries.

5o pairs?

again I said I only did it on the majors and mostly the eur/usd

most trending systems on 5 mins will not work on most pairs

no vol.

also what times where you trading again trading trend on a 5 min in off times

esp on none majors you will get killed !! for sure!!

teb

--- 帖子 #80 ---
its more the time of day and the pair I think

slope can be programed I believe.

I like to eyeball my trades personally

so I do not program

but if I was to program

I would get a go on both times frames

and look for a candle formation sign on the lowest you are trading

cheers

teb

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Skyline, can you code and post here the ea of these strategy?

Please....

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Maybe you don't understand what I wrote before, this strategy cannot be turned into an EA there's too much discretion involved.

Cheers,

Skyline

--- 帖子 #83 ---
You are likely right

but if you

1. found trend and strenght on the 30 min

2. found trend and strenght on the 5 min

3. found buy/sell sign on the 5 min

say a. candle formation or b. 1 2 3 break

4. let price ride until it crossed out on the 5 min chart

either emas or rsi.

would it not work?

was just wondering?

teb

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Reasons TEB has indicated he would enter on the lower time frame (AFTER the higher time frame has indicated trend)

EMA cross

Candle formations

3 candle reversal

OB

pin bars

IB

Railway tracks

Break of S&R

Pull back to EMA

TEB....anything else??

Do you have a favorite of the entries I have listed?

--- 帖子 #85 ---
the two best are I have found personally are

a.1.2 3. break

b. Inside Candle

c. the pull back is more pips more loses too;

d. S/R always great but you have to be care of Stop hunting

e. Outside candles and pen bars and railway tracks all work well.

f. trend line break works again more pips more loses

g. the weakest is the simple cross on the lowest trade. but it works as well remember price continues 85% of the time in the direction.

you have to find the trend and ride the wave.

cheers

Not 50 pairs

-50 pips - i traded ej, eu, cable, usdjpy, usdchf, usdcad over two days.

A few winners but a lot more losers so far - roll on next week. I will just trade two pairs only from Monday.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
ok trade the eur/usd

a made over 500 pips for the week.

this system will work on almost any pair

some a lot better then others

ie the usd mxn I would not trade

Also where you doing two lots or just one .

the second lot as a runners is where you make the money right ?

the idea is to make a little on the 1st lot and make a lot on the second lot.

If you are using the swing for the stop loss (1 pip + spread plus swing right!!! )

But if the stop loss would be to much do not take the trade

say 25 pips maxum.

teb

--- 帖子 #88 ---
no Teb , there's discretion involved (like candle formations or 1 2 3 breaks), EA cannot be coded when there's no mechanical, precise and repeatitive rules.

Skyline

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Really?

1 2 3 breaks and IB cannot be coded?

I am not a programer so you may be right.

But a friend of mine who is a good one,

once told me once anything you can see can me coded.

but to be honest I don't do this because I eyeball it.

you can make lots between ( my time) 3-5 am & 8-10 & 4-5pm 8-10 pm est

took a short on eurjpy 126.25....tp 124.21

--- 帖子 #112 ---
If it can take out 3rd leg of support at 126.00 (2nd leg was 126.32)...look out Below!  Will probably bounce at 126.00...may be good for ReEntry at the retracement.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
The indicator tells you in the top left hand corner what the abbreviations are & if they are bullish or bearish.

It calls Pin Bars hammers or stars depending on the close.

Great thread TEB.

I have modified an ea to sort of fit this great trading system you have developed. Now I am not a programmer...but I do know how to modify code to get it to do what I want it to. PLZ....do not use this with a real account yet....there could be bugs. I do not have trailing stop programmed in but it does offer money mgmt as well as what hours (UTC) that you want to trade.

If you are a good programmer....plz feel free to better this ea program to fit what TEB recommends. I would appreciate it.

The program simply analyzes the 5 min and 30 min timeframes. If rsi > 50 on both TF and ema_5 > ema_12 on 30 min....it is looking to go long. All you need is the ema_5 > ema_12 on 5 min and then you are in.

opposite for short trades...of course.

1 question TEB.......do you want the 5 min candle to close? Or get into trade the instant that the ema_5 > ema_12 on the 5 min candle?

[quote=TEB63;3605304]Its hard not to win pips with this system ... if you do MTFs

This is one of the systems I use (a lot)

here it is an 30 min & 5 min charts

its hard not to make pips with this system.

I use 5 ema and 12 ema

(but if you like use 5 & 8 or 5 & 10 ema it doesn't really matter)

MTF is the point (Multi time frames)

I use the 20 RSI at 50

(if you want a letter win rate put 45 and 55 on the higher chart RSI )

Hi Teb63, why a better win rate with 45 and 55 on the higher chart RSI? Is it the 30mins TF and why? thanks

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Thank you will pop it on a few charts now

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Please let us know how it goes with the EA......I am not a fan of letting an EA take trades for me.....but what would be kinda cool,  would be an EA that lets me know when a trade is setting up that meets the criteria ..and sends an alert.....then I could have a look myself and decide yes or no

--- 帖子 #118 ---
TEB,

plz correct me if I'm wrong but it seems that you use quite a bit of discretion before entering a trade. A lot of the success you have comes from looking at the chart and only taking some of the trades as opposed to all of them?

Would you recommend any additional 5 min indicators that could be used to insure that a good trade has set up?

For instance...PSAR for a pullback   or   favorable price action over a 10 min period for a cross?

I can understand why EA's wont work for every system. There can be quite a bit of subjective input needed I guess.

Plz know that the meat and bones of your system will remain anchored...I am just trying to come up with a way to solidify the trend and avoid any sideways situations where the ema's are nearly parallel.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
3 trades eu, cad and ej - all hit TP. Good start. This ea will only take one trade per 4 hr candle  win or lose.

Lets see what tomorrow brings

--- 帖子 #120 ---
hi guys

in fact I find there is not a lot of discretion

funny you say this.

I was teaching and calling trades today with a group that

wanted me to use "discretion" on their system.

and to be honest everytime I got away from "my rules"

I got in trouble.I told them for the rest of the week we do it "by the rules"

we made a lot of money but we lost some we didn't have to.

set and follow the rules

teb

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Dear Teb, i like your system but maybe it would help people a lot more if you could show entries you take on both charts (5 min, 30 min) as i think pictures speak louder than words.

Hi Teb, what do u mean by better win rate (I suppose) put 45 and 55 on the higher chart RSI? What do u mean by that? I am applying it to the 4 hr and 1 hr time frame due to my work. Thank you

--- 帖子 #123 ---

I will take a stab at answering this....I think what Teb is saying is let the RSI break the 45 line (for shorting)(rather than the 50 line) on the higher time frame.

This will show that the currency is truely in a downtrend

(obviously the opposite is true for bull trend ...breaking the 55)

Currently on the 4 hour EURGBP we have the RSI just toying with the 50 line....but if it breaks the 45 line...well we will indeed be in business in a resumption of the downtrend (see image)

I too often trade the 4 hour - 1 hour....(although I then refine the entry on the 5 minute

My standard disclaimer is....Teb is the guru of this method...but I thought I would attempt a response

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Thanks Pgpb. What is yr TP and Sl on the 4 hr/ 1 hr tf? Is there any indicator that show the average ADR of the day? I am in at uj at 1.5352 and it seem like not going anywhere. Thanks

--- 帖子 #125 ---
I use the attached ADR indicator....I got it from another thread on FF

As to SL and TP.....it is pretty much up to you....and something that requires your own discretion....I know that Teb talks about trading multiple lots.....taking profit on the first one quite early and letting the other run

IMHO this is a momentum stratagy.....if price goes in our direction it is going to go....so I like to keep stops relatively tight....but I also like to win larger than I lose......I have heard it said that money management is the Holy Grail of trading....something I am slowly getting my head around

Regarding your USDJPY trade....I wish you luck. I would not have traded that pair because it looks like it is ranging on the 4 hour...but I hope it goes your way

One thing that I do (and this is perhaps veering away from Tebs 30 min 5 minute stratagy) is I think hard which pair I will trade the 4 hour one hour stratagy....and one of the first things I will do is look whether the pair is trending or not on the 4 hour.....for instance the USDCAD has a nice trend down.....so I would look to take short trades on that

--- 帖子 #126 ---
FYI TEB..

Using 5min/1min, 2 lots, and 10 pip SL, and using discretion only with respect to exit.. ie.. staying with 2 lots and not using 1 out at 10 etc., my results so far..

32 trades

27 wins

Net pips = 167.5

Most consecutive wins 9

I'm using 5/8 cross and both RSI's below or above 50.. that's it.

Excellent system TEB!!

Ya.. u r right ... i need luck actually. Well sl hit. Lick my wound and go to bed. Singapore time 23 36. Another lesson learned. Thanks pgpb

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Hi pgpb, what does all the numbers and colors in the adr means? thank u

--- 帖子 #129 ---
So you are entering mechanically, but using discretion / price action to exit?

Basically, the reverse of the entry/exit rules?

--- 帖子 #130 ---
If you set the ATR indicator to 5 and 25
ATR (average trading range) of last 5 candles is higher than the ATR of the previous 25 candles, it simply
means that trading activity has increased.
If the ATR indicator is reading red (rather than green) it means the ATR of the last 5 candles is NOT greater than the previous 25 candles...which means trading activity is down. You could use this indicator as a method for deciding whether or not to jump in.
The indicator also shows how much room the currency pair has to move.
It calculates the average daily range....and if the pair has moved a lot in the day already....then it will show a very small (or negative it the pair has moved more than the daily range)

......BUT I caution you to get to excited about this....it is ONLY an indicator....price action is where it is at....reading bars and candles. (I do like the part that shows how much room the pair has to move...but I do not get too hung up on the ATR reading
(I have now exhausted my knowledge of this indicator )

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Yes David.

My experience trading various short term systems has not been good with respect to winning percentage or pips based on using money management techniques that take a lot off the table at 10 pips and allow the other to do what it is going to do etc.

Using a 5 min/1min TF, I have found that I can usually garner at least 5 pips per trade with about 75-80% accuracy consistently.

10-12 trades a day (NY session) with 2 lots nets me a decent return.

Nice results Marco!

What pairs are you trading?

BR

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Thus far, just EUR/USD.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Hi Marco,

Can you explain your entry rules? Do you enter at market on cross of 5/8 EMA or do you prefer pullback to 8 EMA or some other entry rule to achieve your returns? Appreciate you sharing your experience with this strategy.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
I focus on the 5 minute chart, watching to see when the 5/8 cross occurs and making sure, for example, if the cross is down, that the RSI is below 50%.

I then use the 1 minute chart for entry at market, if likewise, the 5/8 has crossed or is crossing down, and RSI is below 50%.

I also make sure price action is not near a pivot point, or strong support at entry in the case of a short position.

I have a 10 pip stop, and allow the trade to play out.

Usually, when the 5/8 and RSI are lined up on both charts, i will get a minimum of 5 pips, and often, price will take off a bit and it is not uncommon to get 10-15 pips or more.

Since I know I will have 10 or so trades before the day is over, I'm not looking for a big "kill" here, and I am quite glad to cash out with 5 or so for the moment.

And if I'm up 5 pips or more, I don't allow price to whip back through and take me out for a loss.

And  FWIW, the 8 period moving average is a SMA (close) and not EMA.

Do I cash out frequently and miss some bigger moves.. yes.

But I trade 2 full lots and a few pips here and there at about 75-80% play well for me.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Thanks for sharing Marco makes sense to me!

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Hi Pgpb, thank you for yr time and willing to share yr knowledge with me. I appreciate it. How many candles are u looking at when u are loking at the 4 hr TF. It may paint to u differently if the numbers of candles we looking at are different. Thanks

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Marko,

What's your RSI setting?

--- 帖子 #140 ---
21 (close)

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Hi there

The ADR indicator is simply comparing the average trading range of the last 5 candles compared to the previous 25 candles (If set at 5 to 25)

I really do not use this indicator religiously. I have become more and more indicator free.......indicators can only tell you so much.....and they will always be telling you what HAS happened.....candles and price action may give clues as to what MAY happen in the future.

Puntalara,

I count 18 wins 17 losses for the week. Thats +105 pips?

I know the 4hr rule may not fit Teb's system. That can be changed to 1 hr or less.  Anything between 1 and 4 hrs would require a bit of code that I am not real sure about. We would need to put a time stamp on the closeout of the last trade and then a minute entry to determine when trading starts again. It can be done I just need to find the right syntax.

Teb...what would be best? Do we need any time interval between trades?

I noticed that some of the text does not update properly...I'll see what can be done.  I can throw in an rsi adjustment as well. You can then set the long rsi threshold anywhere from 50 to 55 and the short from 45 to 50.

IMO.....its important that we stick as closely as possible to Teb's rules with this.

--- 帖子 #148 ---

thanks for the share TEB, as always.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Teb,

The ea currently will only take 1 trade per 4 hour bar. Thats all it is.

This can be adjusted or basically done away with.

It's just a way of limiting the # of trades if needed.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
ok not so sure about that rule then

because you might end up trading in the wrong times

better 2 trades if they are bad take an hour off

3rd bad trade take the day

off come back the next day

there are times you do not want to be trading like now

three winning trades this am

rsi 21 sure is key

few changes...

bbbands 12 (yellow) and 5 ema (red) ....(bbbands taking the place of second ma) (watching the 5ema cross the midline)

have the 1m 5m and 15m chart side by side

the rsi 21 has been key to the decisions to enter long and short

will re read the thread ... may not be quite on same page but this chart

has certainly been keeping me in right direction

of course 1m takes the lead but i wait for 5m to agree before entry

yes no problem

attached zip with all my indi used and 3temp for 1 5 and 15min

green and red lines are ema for this tf that we are looking at and arrows for crosses...

orange and white lines are ema's for one higher tf

double rsi custom to check 9 and 21 rsi

tvi

derail green ema 20 ,fib pivots s , candle clock and zigzag - the pink one - i like that's indi but no need to use them in this system

usually I’m looking at 5min tf i see cross orange and white(15min) then I’m waiting for arrow on 5min in that direction and then on 1min looking for arrow or for tvi start to grow up in the same direction that on 5min... also check rsi 9ro be green and 21 at least orange ;]

1st tp about 8/10pips and IF the crosses was with the same direction as last cross at 30min (i see that cross on my 15tf) i close only 1/2position as teb said ,move sl to be and waiting

Second half close at next 15min cross (saw on 5min tf)

sl -as you like - i prefer last swing(if its not huuuuuge =])

waiting for comments / ideas ;] and first try it on demo!

Happy piping!

the 4 hour rule is a bad Idea

because it will put you in times that are not tradable

for a trending system.

The only times that are tradable are

a. 3am to 5am est        - best

b. 7am to 12noon est    - good

c. 8pm to 10pm, est     - ok to slow

d. 5am to 8am est       - is a maybe.

anyother time are not good on the 5 min trade

which is what we are doing.

I'm trading it and doing quite well.  I think the reason this method isn't getting swamped with posts is because people actually have to think before pulling the trigger.  Way too many people looking for the 100% mechanical get rich quick dream.  Not gonna happen imo.  That's why there's tons of methods/systems on FF and 99% of them are crap.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Yes.

You never can put Experience, S & R - Lines in an EA.

In the MTF-Theory it is important, to know waht time you close position. E.g i have an Long in EUR/USD since the last 45 minutes. And that position stay with -6 or -11 pips. What i do ? i close the position, because i Know, that is no more change.

Can you put this in an EA ? I dont think so...

Hi Teb, the pullback is on 5 min or 30 mins. Right now, U/C and A/U 30 mins corss, However RSI not there yet. Am I right? If lookinf for pull back, do I need to go down to 5 mins or stay at 30 mins? Thanks

--- 帖子 #186 ---
you want the trend to be strong on the 30 min. ie. the EMAs and RSI

you then buy in then the trend continues back on the 5 min chart.

hi guys

I just want to say simpler is always best!!

These threads always die because people keep adding "stuff"

please do not add stuff ...the system works very very very well.

get to know it. or make one yourself.

esp. if you are new, use just one system and master it for at least 6 months.

The nice thing about this system it tells you when to trade and when not do. I use this system (in fact a little simpler one in fact.)

**I just picked up two eurusd trades one for 12 pips one for 25 pips and have a third one on as a free trade.***

I would say "Do not fall in love with indicators and MAs!!! They are tools

to measure what is, almost any set will work if you master them!!."

Hi Teb

do you mostly use "buy/sell" at market orders or pending orders.

For break out (price pushing past a previous support or resistance) entries....a pending order makes sense to me.....but for entry based on a candle pattern (pin bar etc) a entry at market makes sense

I am mostly trading this on 30 minute 5 minute time frame....the one minute time frame is a bit much for me (I also have a full time job)

A "mistake" I may have been making is paying too much attention to the 4 hour time frame.......price could be trending down on the 4 hour...but trending up on the 30 minute/ 5 minute

Here is a trade I jumped into because i thought it was going to break out (down) and then it went up a bit before finally going down. I would have got a way better entry if I jumped in because of the doji candle

--- 帖子 #198 ---

1.about 20% vs 80%..

Hi Teb,

Can this system be used in conjunction with your other system Teb2, ie add stochastics 5,3,3 and 14.3.3 on top of the Rsi anad MA's on here?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Sure? but why would you?

both systems tell you pretty much the same stuff.

5 ema over 12 ema over 20 rsi

5 stoch over 14 stoch over 50 ema

Both on two time frames (or 3 time frames)

the 50 ems and the 20 rsi are basically the same check it out.

5 over 12 ema is basically the same as the 5 over 14 stoch

I like this system over teb2 simply because its easier to compare

diff time frames. and its a little clearer triggers

this is why you do not need 10 or 12 indicators

cheers

Many Thanks for your speedy reply, I'm sorry if the following questions have been answered I've just come accross this thread. Do you wait for 30 min candle to close above or under 50 rsi than go to 5 min if rsi also above or below you enter?

On the 5 min do you only enter if the MA's have crossed on 30 min timeframe?

What do you mean by better to wait for a pullback than enter on is this a pullback on the 5 min chart?

You say that on the higher time ie 30 min you have rsi 45 and 55 so if you were looking to go long would you wait till rsi has crossed and candle has closed above 55 than go to 5 mins to enter?

Do you still trade same pairs as on post one with same spread?

If your 10 pip stop has been hit than a few bars later same conditions occur would you again enter same direction?

Thanks in advance

Many Thanks for your speedy reply, I'm sorry if the following questions have been answered I've just come accross this thread. Do you wait for 30 min candle to close above or under 50 rsi yes

than go to 5 min if rsi also above or below you enter?yes

On the 5 min do you only enter if the MA's have crossed on 30 min timeframe? yes ,,, the set up is on the 30 min ,,
then you enter on the 5 min

What do you mean by better to wait for a pullback than enter on is this a pullback on the 5 min chart? pull backs as always better
I think you can read on pull backs on the enternet

You say that on the higher time ie 30 min you have rsi 45 and 55 so if you were looking to go long would you wait till rsi has crossed and candle has closed above 55 than go to 5 mins to enter? the rsi would be over 55% in an up trend... yes the candle should be closed

Do you still trade same pairs as on post one with same spread? yes

If your 10 pip stop has been hit than a few bars later same conditions occur would you again enter same direction?
yes because the 30 min chart is the same

Thanks in advance

cheers

hi TEB,

For the pullback are you looking to take it when price touches 12 EMA or 5 EMA or some other entry?

Thanks for sharing!

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Teb, Thanks for taking the time to answer all the questions I asked much appreciated.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Thank you very much for the simple system.  I just found this thread tonight, setup my charts and saw a nice momentum candle so pulled the trigger.  10 in under 10

I don't usually start start trading till 12am PST, but just waited to do a quick test. Will continue to monitor the rest of the morning.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
I try to understand the basics.

Are those signals and drawings correct?

First would have been a LONG, 2nd one a SHORT.

I know those are miserable examples, but I want to understand why the setup comes so late.

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #212 ---
great system. After having been in the markets for 7 years, I can honestly say that simplicity increases the odds of success in the market. I don't know why it takes us so long to learn that even though we have read it somewhere. I applaud you for sharing this. It is simple and straight forward. Very followable which will -if nothing else- help instill discipline a necessary quality in any successful trader. Question is, how many will miss the point? I wish you much success in your trading.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
What indicator makes the ema's color like that ?

--- 帖子 #214 ---
the 12 on the 5 sometimes

rather a reset and buy/sell sign on the 5 min or 1 min chart

so the emas and rsi cross back and cross my way again

cheers

how your charts are very big . its hard to see what is going on

this systen is not going for tops and bottoms.

Hi Teb,
Thanks for sharing this method. I have been reading through this thread over the last week or so and I think that this method could be just what I am looking for. It is so simple and has structure.  I want to trade a method that has been tried, tested and proven and not embark on something that leaves a big percentage for me to make up/curve fit around my own comfort zone. The most important part, I think, is to resist the temptation to add things to something that already works… don’t try to fix something that is not broken…ie. I would be determined to stick to Teb’s rules. However, there is an area that I am not sure about. How do you trade in relation to news breaks… do you avoid all relevant red flags, avoid certain types of news announcements or simply pay no attention to the news whatsoever?  This has been a major area for me when trading smaller timeframe methods in the past and I have tried various approaches to it. Like I said earlier, I don’t want make changes to a working method so, I would like, when trading this method, to deal with the news exactly as you do. I would appreciate yours, and other’s, help on this point.
Thanks…Kean

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Ok ...

the simple anwers is do not trade the news .

esp. Interest rate stuff and NFP

close up 15 min before and wait 30 mins after news

close up or tighten up open trades.

you are wise not to add tools!

add you time !!

Love the  system, practice account trading it right now...in fact, in Eur/Usd from 1.3231, short.

We'll see how it goes...

Greg

P.S. Not so well! stopped out a 10 pip loss per contract, 20 pip total.

Unfortunatly, I won't be around for the NY session, but will pick it back up tomorrow evening.

Goodnight all, happy trading

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Hi Spinfoil,

Today is a Bank Holiday in the UK so really it would have been wise not to trade especially before New york opening - if you look at your chart you will see price was in a tight range, until the NY session where it did break out eventually.

Hope this advice helps you..

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Love TEB's threads, for their simplicity. Also, I read them because I've been using MTF's for a very long time now. Thank you TEB.

I've noticed people keep looking for additional stuff to filter out bad trades. The best filter is your experience. Period. There's no special indicator, simply because the market is DYNAMIC, its composition changes all the time: more big players, less big players, news, consolidations; a lot of the money on the market, less money on the market - all this affects the way the price moves. And no indicator out there is designed to reflect these changes except one. Your eyes. Try watching the price move for about an hour before making an entry. Over time you'll be surprised with the difference it makes.

Of course, if the price just moved down 80-120 pips straight without looking back and at this point you have your indicators lined up, it's TOO LATE to enter short, wait for a pullback. No matter what indicators tell you, price still will move in waves. After a big move, there's always a period of consolidation before the move continues or the reversal happens. No system will tell you that, just watch the market and you'll get it.

TEB is successful because he does his homework. He knows what candlestick formations are and how they look and to use them. He knows how to identify 1-2-3 setup in a couple of seconds, he knows how to determine a trend, and so on. Now, the question is, do you? If not, no matter how simple the system is, you won't be successful with it because you simply do not have the feeling for the market.

Train your eyes, educate yourself, and success is inevitable.

Once again, thanks TEB for the system, it's fun making money your way, as always

I have a quick question for you, maybe it was answered already, im just scanning the thread but when u get a cross on the 30min u wait for the pull back on the 5 min because usually the ema's on the 5 min is already crossed ?

--- 帖子 #236 ---
no not really

its to enter at a better rate .

the 30 min chart is only for trend

the 5 min chart is for the trade

( one min chart is for trigger)

cheers

TEB

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Can you explain the trigger with the 1 min chart again or tell me where to find it in the thread?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Hi Teb,

I am looking at this method for the first time this week. However, I only have the 30M and 5M charts set up. I have been finding the trend from the 30M and taking the trigger from the 5M. Should I be also using the 1M charts? Please can you clarify...thanks, Kean

--- 帖子 #239 ---
I do talk about it in the thread.

its more complex

stay with the 30 and 5 untill you know the system

when you do put a chart on the 1 min

and use it when the other two are moving in the same way

its just to really refine enteries and exits .. more the enteries

(triggers and fire doors: enteries and exits)

but the 30 & 5 min is all you need to make a lot of pips

cheers

4 ideas

1. I do swings

2. use the 5ems  as long as it close under the 5 keep in the trade

(ride the five)

3.target the next "00" number  1.6250 or 16300.

4. a big S/R

good job!!!

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Thank you...they seem not to be so difficult....I will try....

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Hi Teb,

Thanks for your speedy reply. Can I ask you a couple of questions regarding how you run your profits? Lets suppose you get a trigger and you put on your two lots. You then go over +10 up so one trade is now fulfilled and the other is running its profits with stop loss now at break even. Now, if this trade goes say +40 up and retraces back a little forming a pullback to the EMA, would this trigger another new trade for you even though your previous trade is still running? I hope I have explained this clearly.

Also, do you close a trade when it reaches a certain amount of pips up?

Regards, Kean

--- 帖子 #247 ---
I would move the stop loss up to the next swing low/hight

and let it run until it does 1 2 3 reversal.

close up ; yes if it gets over 100 pips

I would look at closing it down at days end

if other things are going on.

If I have a free trade on I will take more

I have had as many as 17 trades on normally only 2 or 3

teb

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Thanks TEB63 for publishing an uncomplicated, easy to follow system with charts that don't have me reaching for a pair of sunglasses.

One question I would ask is in respect of the close of the 30 min c/stick. Does it make any difference, to your decision making, whether it closes bullish or bearish?  I notice that, on some occasions, the RSI can be below the 50 level and MAs crossed down but, the candle closes bullish and vice versa for a short set up.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
1st lot +11pips, 2nd lot +22pips

But I like this system, thank you for sharing TEB

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Hi TEB,

Accurate simple system. Thanks for the share.

I have been wondering why the times are so important. From the testing I have done, trades outside of your recommended times are much less likely to succeed. Is it because the markets tend to lack direction outside these hours?

Also what do you think of trading the AU in the Asian session? Has this worked

at all for you in the past?

--- 帖子 #251 ---
I trade AU and EA and would advise that to trade them during Asia with a short term trend following method is unlikely to make you happy.

The suggested 8-10 gmt hours correspond with the opening trend for Europe so it really adds an edge to a st trend extraction method.  I actually find that 7-10 can work quite well but its for a different methodology and it permits more market slop than this does.

I trade longer term trend following as well and will fill during the asian hours but I'm looking to get favourable positions from countertrend retracements rather than to catch a good trend during asia.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Sure I like the asia to do you start with the asia or ausie time zone?

I trade the Aud/Usd

I do not get a good spread on the Eur/Aud so I do not trade it

Maybe you might look at trading the Usd/Jpy

as you will have two very diff. pairs.

Hi TEB, hi guys, I love to make EA and now I settle my eyes on this thread. Something about the entry signal... is it after the last closed bar or the actual one? Is it only for scalping (Take Profit MUST be +10 and little more), or we can go to the stars or hell if the trend goes strong?

For to make a good EA I need to know better as I can the IDEA behind the strategy

Let's fuc_k the forex

I was looking in the first post the rules, and it seems relatively few, how do you defend yourself from choppy periods?

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Hi theres

1. its on the open of the new bar, I do

2. I do two lots

1st lot is 11 pips ( I just changed to 21 pips this week it seems to be working)

2nd lot is on the a swing reversal ,, in other words a 1 2 3 break against my possition .. so I like to do both .

Hi Teb,

I have just completed my first week of trying this system and I think I need to clarify a couple of things with you as I have not done as well as I think I should have. I understand the point of entry when there is a cross over of the EMA’s. However, please could you outline the exact point of entry for a pullback?
Also, I seemed have been flicked out a lot this week using a stop loss of 10. Would you say it is a better idea to use recent swing points as the initial stop loss, in order to give the trade more room to get moving, or just stick with the 10 and put it down to a poor week? Hope you can help so that I can improve next week.

Regards, Kean

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Yes 10 pips only for the eur 20 otherwise

yes I use the last swing normally

(10 pips is only for the eur which I trade most of the time)

but it was a crazy week.

pull back is the 5 min change back to the 30 min trend

teb

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Sorry, I do not understand re-pullbacks... if price retraces back to the EMA, and touches/penetrates it, do you then enter a trade or do you wait for a bar close? I am not sure of the exact trigger point.

Kean

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Ok

lets say we are in an up trend

on the 30 min charts

we have the RSI and EMAs in an up trend.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Here on the 5 min chart

The two pink boxes are the EMAs and the RSI resetting

ie. going down against the 30 min trend ( EMAs and the RSI on the 30 min chart)

They are resetting so we know we have the needed "pip room"

or pull back or price move back it retraces

The blue Arrows tell us to get in

The trend on the 5 min chart is coming in line with the 30 min chart trend

So we know the retracement is over

TEBhttp://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/s...m/big_grin.gif

--- 帖子 #272 ---
How would you tell if the trend is not changing direction on the 5 minute chart?  I know they always say that one should trade in the direction of the higher timeframe, but that does not always work out...

--- 帖子 #273 ---
TEB, please correct me if you disagree.

et, what you are doing is stacking odds in your favour.

The 30m trend with strength (emas+rsi) gives you favourable probability.

The times that you trade are most likely to have short term trends and give you favourable probability.

The setups to enter give you favourable probability.

But nothing here adds up to 100% - so sometimes the 30m trend will be changing despite it still being up and the 5m flashing up.  But that is one of the legitimate system losers and it could well have been a winner - you will never know until after it has played out.

So, as long as you follow TEB's recommendations it is a "good trade" and you did well (pat yourself on the back et!)  But XX% of trades that are good trades also give back some money ... think of it as fuel for the good trades that are profitable.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
yes when you have the 30 min chart trend at your back (RSI and EMAs)

and then the 5 min chart trend moves into agreement with it.

The odds are in your favour big time.

I then look for reasons to enter.

cheers

TEB

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Thanks Teb…
So, the blue arrows show that the RSI is back above the 50 and that the EMA’s have crossed back over. Can you tell me where the trigger for a trade is? Is it when you see price touch the blue EMA?  If so, do you take a new trade every time price returns and touches the blue EMA?
Kean

--- 帖子 #276 ---
No

1. the cross of the two is the easies trigger.

2, safer is a 1 2 3 or what I call a confirmed break

over the 2 crosses

ie, see the pull back from that big candle on that chart?

1 pip plus spread is a GREAT entry !

3. Or a break of and old S/R is a great entry

cheers

I've just sent an email to the address in your last post, Hope to hear from you.

Many Thanks

Ted

Excuse the blunt question, but you say you trade this system mostly. What are your actual performance numbers using it? What is the average strike rate + average win to loss ratio? How long have you been trading it (this question was asked right at the start of the thread but not answered).

If you do not have exact numbers, a rough idea would be helpful.

If you don't have a good guess of performance numbers, how do you know this system works and that your profits don't come from other systems?

I'm not looking for the holy grail here, I'm seeking clarification so as to manage expectations.

I've grown tired of people posting system ideas that they either don't trade themselves or haven't traded for a sufficiently long time.

I know it's up to me to trade it and that my results will be different to yours. What don't want to do is spend hours testing something that doesn't work in reality once you factor in things like the spread.

People are criticized for flip floping between systems and indicators, but this is understandable when very few people are prepared to put real performance numbers online. It creates the seed of doubt.

Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #280 ---
strewthmate,

why don't  you do your research on the boards and see for yourself for how long Teb has been posting MTF systems. They are all similar and still working. That should give you an idea.

The MAJOR idea here is lining up the timeframes, so that you see the indication of the same direction on more than one timeframe. It does work. Only problem is using lagging indicators, you will always miss a little junk of a move. Which is not a big deal, and sometimes prevents you entering a bad trade, so may be shouldn't even be called a problem.

One idea for knowing when to exit the second lot could be to add MACD (I use MACD-2 in custom indicators) and to look for divergences. Once you spot a divergence, you can exit your trade. I use candlestick formations for tuning the exit (just a personal preference).

--- 帖子 #281 ---
hi masterpiecefx

you are right ... I just look for the safe ... very safe sweet spot.

I like safe trades... I miss the tops and bottoms

but I normally miss lossing pips when the reversal happens

I am out of the market.

I tend to take a lot of trades in the market when the 30 min chart is good

I will enter a lot on the 5 min and 1 min charts .

and out again normally before the 30 min chart turns

You almost always get 2 or 3 chances to get out on the 5 min charts as the 30 min chart is turning .

anyways it works for me.

I can and do hunt tops and bottoms

but this is just so much easier ... my thoughts

The macd works great I just do not like the way it comes its water line ... just personal choice.

thanks again for your thoughts

How important is the rsi 50 cross on the 30min? if the 30min rsi show a good trend and it crossed say yesterday could you still trade the 5min today on pullbacks, crosses and breakouts. Or do you have to trade close to the 50line

Teb,

Can we just use eur/jpy as an eg for now ema's have crossed on 30 min rsi is still above 50 now do you wait for the current candle to close than look to trade of nxt candle or do you go into the trade now as rsi is looking to break 50, we know on 5 min both ema's and rsi have crossed and is below 50.

Thanks

Hi Masterpiecefx

Thanks for replying. I am new to the board and having just tried to search for the suggested research I am confronted with mountains of posts to look at. I have tried looking at the most relevant, but nowhere do I find objective performance information other than people trying it for a short period.

I was wondering if you could be so kind as to point me in the direction of the the most relevant of the posts you refer to.

I don't think its unreasonable to ask for specific performance information when someone says this "Its hard not to win pips with this system ... if you do MTFs

This is one of the systems I use (a lot)"

Can TED or anyone provide some sort of real life performance data over 3 months for this system or anything similar. Demo accounts would be good but they don't always taken into account the real spread.

I don't think this is an unreasonable request.

I know results will vary and discretion will be playing a part in anyone's results, but I wonder if anyone has built up a live trading track record using these methods over the last 3 months?

I'm not looking for a pot of gold, I make big distinction between an idea that might work and an idea that has been verified in live trading.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
strewthmate,

I don't mean no disrespect to you, bro, but asking people to post their own account performance is a little bit too much. It's a public board and not too many people will do it. All I can say is that you got to test the system on your own. This is how you learn, not only this system, but also new things along the way, things that make this game work for you individually.

I personally use a slightly different approach to this method, so my performance will be of no relevance to this thread.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Thanks for the replies

I'm not asking for your actual personal account performance, I'm asking for some quantifiable support for the performance of the system. No-one has been able to provide this so far. I don't want to know you bank balance/ amount of money you make every day etc, what I'm interested in is some headline statistics such as the number of trades you have made using it, the average strike rate you achieve with the system and the average win to loss size ratio of every trade.

I don't believe you owe me anything either, but I do believe when you say something works, you should be able to provide some supporting evidence, at least in the form of summary statistics. If you don't have this evidence fine, it's just an idea then, but says its an idea. I am not a beginner, I'm not looking for a teacher. I'm looking for quantifiable evidence that this idea or others like it has actual numbers behind it that can back up its performance.

I'm not trying to catch anyone out here, or prove anyone wrong. I'm not going to turn around and say 'aha, it only has a 50% strike rate'. I'm a numbers person and do not trade anything until I there is a fair weight of evidence that something works. The first step for me is to back test/ review headline trading performance then I perform my own tests based on that evidence and demo trading before finally trading it. As you say you are trading this system or one like it, I assume you have such performance information in order to be able to say that its easy to win pips with it. If you share a system, why not share the evidence you have built up?

So I'm not asking you to give me something on a plate. The reason people flip flop between systems is because there is a seed of doubt in their mind as to whether it works or not. They don't do thorough back/ forward and then live testing.

If you post something saying saying 'its not hard to win pips with this system' I don't believe it's  too much to ask to also be able to back up that statement with some sort of supporting evidence, be it headline statistics or a summary of trades (again I'm not asking for your actual account performance).

Strethmate lets do something that we can measure.....you have 3 posts on FF, Teb has about 2500......so to my eyes...he has "given" a lot more than you, in fact in your very first post you ask for something.....your 3 posts have been rather haughty. I am not going to get into a debate about it. I "take" from various methods, but all of the methods I use have some form of MTF involved.

Tebs method is pretty simple....but it requires traders discretion.......so Teb could say.......he has made X pips....but another trader might attempt to use the system and until he develops traders discretion he will not be successful. Tebs system is simple, but human nature will aways find a way to screw things up.   Anyways....I am not sure how long you plan to hang around FF......but your 3 beginning posts are not going to make you many friends. I like Teb, I like his systems, I like his approach.......you might want to spend some time reading his 2500 posts.......and then.....post a few trades of your own.......or do you come to just ask for proof.....if this was a paid system.....well perhaps you might have the right to ask for proof.....but here....in FF the first requirement is you be respectful of senior posters like Teb

My guess is you have annoyed a few people....I sure I have annoyed people from time to time with my posts.

As you've said, you do thorough testing, demoing, and so on. That's it. Keep doing it, everybody tests something they find on the forum. No one's tests or results will give you any idea about a system until you try it for yourself. We're all different.

The reason people flip flop between systems is because market is dynamic, it changes behavior, so some systems stop working, others start working. This is where your own knowledge inventory would come to use.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
He didn't annoy me.  He gave me a laugh.

I just thought ... oh god ... another newbie w..... (rhymes with banker) and hoped that he'd trade something, preferably his backtests, with real money.

strewthyboy: no one else asks for TEBs account because 1) they know they'll get told to F. Off and 2) they know that because its discretionary it doesn't matter what TEB says they won't get the same results.  3) if it drifts out of synch with the market TEB will adjust with the market.

When you've been around a while then you might move to the "hmmm ... here's an interesting idea ... I wonder if it's profitable for me as it is or I could include it with xxx and it would give me some system diversification position" rather than the immature "prove it to me mummy position."

--- 帖子 #312 ---
I know the sort of newbie post you are referring to Kiwi trader and I can see how how my blunt questioning will have annoyed people.

Let me get this clear, I'm not asking for TEBs personal account records, I was asking for the sort of performance data that might help make an informed decision as to whether to do spend hours testing it myself. In particular the sort of system it is (high strike rate/ low strike rate etc). I know market regimes change and that you need to adapt.

"When you've been around a while then you might move to the "hmmm ...  here's an interesting idea ... I wonder if it's profitable for me as it  is or I could include it with xxx and it would give me some system  diversification position""

From what I've read of TEB's posts, this is the opposite of what he's suggesting. He says that the system is simple in its own right.

"no one doing this anymore ?

I am not sure this is a computer thing

I think that is what killed this thread that and the add ons.

you really only need the RSi and the EMA(s)

I am geting like 100 to 200 pips a day for real

with about 10 to 20 trades a day ."

In posts 80 to 89 TEB indicates that he believes that the system does not need discretion (or little):

"hi guys

in fact I find there is not a lot of discretion

funny you say this.

I was teaching and calling trades today with a group that

wanted me to use "discretion" on their system.

and to be honest everytime I got away from "my rules"

I got in trouble.I told them for the rest of the week we do it "by the  rules"

we made a lot of money but we lost some we didn't have to.

set and follow the rules  "

Given that TEB has implied that the system does not need discretion (or very little) and that it does not need layers and filters, I did not think it was unreasonable to ask for some top level summaries of the sort of system this is. You can lose just as much money trading system posted on a forum as you  can a system you purchase.

Yes I do trade my own systems and have spent many hours/ days running through the testing cycle with various systems (hypothesis - in sample backtest - refinement - out sample test- forward test - demo trade - live trade).

Like I said, I'm a numbers person and this is what I rely on to give me confidence to live trade any system. I could test it live for 1 month, 2 months but I know that this alone without the supporting statisitcs would never give me enough confidence to trade it live no matter how good results in that time.

I like to see longer term results and then put them in the context of the particular market regime at the time.

I recognize I did probably didn't have much 'credit in the bank' to ask such difficult questions, but I don't believe they should be difficult questions, especially when the system is apparently relatively simple and involving little discretion (According to TED, this is - there's probably much he takes for granted with his trading). Its probably more the way I approach trading and system design that I take it as given that people would have such stats to hand and if they are willing to share a system that a summary of stats would be a natural inclusion.

I shall leave it there and not post anymore until I have some quantitative feedback of my own.

Hello Teb

My entry on EU

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Hi Hcp,

Your trades look really good.  Your trades from yesterday looked good also.

I have just signed up as a member here but I have been following the site for some time and in particular MTF systems, which I think are a very good basis for selecting trades and I am now trying to learn as much as I can in this area.

I have had some good trades with this system earlier last week but I have found the volatility in the market from late last week into this week to be challenging.  Maybe it is my inexperience but when you are watching the charts set up live the price can chop around a bit and take you out of positions when you get a valid signal on a MA cross, which then reverses against you.

On your chart you have arrows and vertical yellow lines.  I assume that the arrows are EMA crosses and the vertical lines are the RSI crosses?

Could you explain what the other indicators on your chart are (the blue / red candles - do they relate to overbought / sold areas on a stochastic?) and other MA lines.  Are these indicators helping you to filter some of the choppy trades out?

Many thanks in advance,

JV78

Hi
All trades are according to this system at least TEB did not objected anyone.
For the entries short look for a cross of 5ema and 12 ema and rsi50 to the downside, in a retracement  to these emas in the 30m chart.
These emas in the 30m chart are 30ema and 72ema in 5m chart.(those doted lines)
The other lines upside are ema 120 and ema 144 (this last applied to the open) that I always use to determine the trend in the 2hours (although we do not have 2 h charts)
I always use 2 pips above/below the last swing plus spread as stop loss, if it s too large look in the 1m chart for a shorter swing. That depends on how it is going with profits.
The blue and red are coloured bars that come with the rsi-ema indicator  posted in this thread.(post nro 18)it ind bars above ema 5 and rsi 55 (blue) and below ema12 and rsi 45(red)
The arrows are emacrossover ind 5 and 12., and the yellow vertical lines indicate the bar enter  the trade, that I try to enter to the close of that bar.
I m not an expert trader , I m learning, and trying , this seems to be profitable sys and simple one, thanks to TEB.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Hcp,

Thanks for your explanation.  I will have a look at the indicator posted and give it a try.

I have been through most TEB's previous threads and have gained an exponential amount of knowledge from him and other constructive comments made on his various system threads.

Once I get a little more familiar with the workings of this site I will post some of my set-ups as well for people to comment on for a good bit of group discussion - be it good or bad!

I should also say a big thanks to TEB for this system and his input on this site.  MTF has got to be the way to go.

Cheers,

Here's another RSI that condenses levels, colours and all that stuff into one that I wrote a while back.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
I've been following this method for a few weeks now and am really impressed. Thanks TEB.

I've attached screen shots of the recent short I've taken on USD/CAD on my demo. I always follow the daily trend so I was looking for the short on this pair. I only look for monthly support resistance levels for bounces also round numbers ie 1.2400 1.5600.

Anyway I've attached my template and indicators. Could I have your template Angus, thats a very useful custom RSI indicator you got there.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Can you post your 30m chart as well?

On my chart emas and rsi put me in no trade zone until 16.00 (GMT+1) (Alpari Demo).

So I would not took the trade.

This would have been my entry.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
hi Bostan thank you for your replay, this is ibfx chart gmt, i m taking rsi above/below 50, i mean i dont filter with 45-55 rsi band. any way i think it is risky...

--- 帖子 #326 ---
I see, so is nothing wrong with your entry (wait for Teb review).

It is that the entry method (cross, pull back, etc.) needs discretion.

After the big Shooting star you see LL LH and this scene (for me) do not qualify for an immediate entry. The rally loose steam and I wolud wait dor break out.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
thank you Bostan your explanation has been very usefull, i ve realized the importance of 45-55 rsi levels as a filter, in both charts.

Hi Teb,
Not sure who you have for email account but there should be an area in your contacts to setup a group folder that only has the people that you want to email the calls to...
Google Mail allows you to copy/paste all the people you want to this group...
Clicking on that folder would then send out to all at once...
Hope that helps...

An alternative is to create a closed group (only invited members can join) in yahoo groups. Then you just send one mail to the group list and yahoos sends it out to the subscribers.

Hello TEB63, you say that  we all need to know when to trade and when not to trade (very important )!

you say that you trade:

-3am to 5am est

-7am to 12noon est

-maybe 8pm to 10pm, est

-no holidays

Question!

You trade Eastern Standard Time GMT -5 or Eastern Daylight Time GMT -4

This forum shows GMT -5 as GMT -4 and i have problem with this!

Thnx for the answer!!!

Hi Teb63 & everyone,

I have been reading this thread (I spend all my time reading threads these days!!) and being very new to forex, I am so very grateful for your system, Teb63.

The real beauty of it, apart from it working soooo well, is the simplicity!!!  I made 560.00 just on one quick trade today (demo) gbp/usd.  I can't wait till it shorts later.

This really is a KISS strategy, I have finally taken the plunge and opened an account with fxcm and it's all thanks to you Teb63, your simple strategy has given me the confidence I needed to finally have a go.

Really thanks for this, I look forward to learning more from your thread.

Cheers.

Eur/Usd Bear 8
Eur/Jpy Bear 8

Aud/Usd Bear 5

Crude Oil (Neutral)
Natural Gas Bear 5

7 & 8 Strong trend
5 & 6 Weak trend
1 to 4 no trend (Neutral)
I look to trading only 7 & 8
I will not trade 4 or below,no trend.

Best to trade a pair that does business in the time you are trading.
The best days to trade trend are Tues, Wed, Thru.
Worst time is Sunday night and Friday after 12noon EST (EST NY time)
Only trade with the trend, use whatever set up you like.

Training is risky, trade at your own risk!!!!

Hey Teb,

I just found this thread and finished reading the whole thread, im confident that I understand how to trade it, just want to clear something up about the times you trade as it seems to be one of the key aspects to making this system profitable.

You give your trading times in EST, i live in Australia and we use EST, so the times you give, would actually be my local time. But I noticed you live in Canada, so im not sure if im missing something? or do I have the times right?

But I need to say, I think the bulls are knocking at the fences today

Keep tight stops, a break out to the upside side could be great.
But the top of the trading channel should hold in the bulls.

Hi guys.

I just ended to read the thread. In past I used a similar system with 9 and 18 emas but it wasn't profitable because I entered in every pullback and I didn't know when to exit. Now I learned some rules and I hope to do better thanks to TEB.

I need some clarification:

the 1st target is 10 (or 20) ticks and I enter with 1 lot, reached 10 ticks I move the stop loss to BE + 10 and after I enter the 2nd lot, is it correct?

I don't know how to insert the 2nd lot, could someone explain me please?

Sorry for my english.

You been playing the AUDUSD again this morning TEB?

Nice moves again!!

G-Man

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Busy looking at Aud/usd now, hoping for another pull back so i can get in on the action

Think i might stay away from the Euro today with all the chaos.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
to start with I keep it about 20 pips plus spread

if I have a swing really closs I will ajust my stops and targets

ie. 23/22 etc.

I follow the swings after on the 2nd lot.

Trading Ideas for today
(I will start adding to trend/trade calls if people like me to )

1. I like the Aud/Usd. I will sell the rallies!!!
2. The Euro/Usd. If it gets into the 1.2310-12335 I will look to sell.
3. The Euro/Usd; If it brakes over the 1.2350 look for a break or bounce off the channel which is around at the 1.2400 area now
Training is risky, trade at your own risk!!!!

Teb,
Most appreciated...helps to keep one focused, I think...
Enjoy the day...
Cliff

--- 帖子 #393 ---
I take it you are looking at selling that level because of the resistance that has been formed there on the 5min chart?

Its broken that level, but im holding on as its still only looking as a pullback to the MA's on the 30min chart.

But quickly climbing as im typing haha

Very true Teb, it crossed my mind to buy euros on this fact alone. But could have, should have, would have's dont help now, but i should have known to stay out of the markets for the time being, my mistake.

Oh well, learn something new everyday

hey Teb

If you could,what was your entry point on A/U, and what time?

it appears that after your post it ran up to .8480, then down to .8436 ,and back up to .8528

Thanks

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Teb,

Thanks for all the trade info much appreciated, missed the aud trades today was fighting with the euro, I would like to know where did you enter on your aud trades and at what time as you have said in a previous post you keep your stop at the last swing high/low would like to know where it was for ref also on what time frame are you using the swing high's/low.

Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
someone asked me the following question
here it is ...

“Teb, I have never watched the aud/usd before. Does it normally move like it did this morning? There were some great trends. Thanks “ _-_-_

Yes I would say to all the majors - I count the majors as
Eur/Usd *, Eur/Jpy, Usd/Jpy *, Eur/Gbp, Usd/Cad , Aud/Usd

Also GBP/USD * & USD/CHF* are majors

I do not watch these two as there are basically the same as the eur/usd and in the same time frame and because of this the big boys sometimes play with them, more than the other pairs. esp because of their smaller Vol. so they do not trend as well as the Eur/Usd

I guess, I should put NZD/USD in there as well but again it trades the same time as the AUD/USD with smaller vol, so doesn't trend as well.

Today was a little strange in that I normally like to trade a pair in there working hours but these days are not normal

(*) are the "real majors" of coarse

--- 帖子 #413 ---
were you buying or selling the euro/dollars?

the Aud, you know I went in a few places.

better then asking me where I went in

is for you to go back with your system rules

and see where you should have gone in?

teb

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Hi TEB,

Thanks for the trend posts. One question I would like to ask: how do you measure the strength of the trend?

Kind regards,

hi guys

teb

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Hi Teb.

Did you not trade EURUSD long while the RIS on the 30M chart was above 50? I realize that you deem this pair to be in a down trend, so does this mean that you wouldn't consider trading long until that changes?

I did trade it long today while the RSI was above and knocked off a couple of successful trades.

Thanks

Just missed the AUDUSD sell at 8313. Small RT formed but I didn't like the set up enough.

Then drops 40 pips to currently sit on previous support.

Anyone get in?

just had 1st win for night long on eur usd 1.2377 for 10. thanks teb for system. 1.2400 level just above here see what happens .

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Hello everyone.

I have been looking this system and had a idea, could this system be coded?

I am not a coder but it could be a very good EA I think.

The idea is that EA looks a crossover in M30 and then looks a entry point in M5. Also the RSI should be above or down the 50 line, for extra confirm.

Best wishes,

Danel.

Teb you were right,

the AUD/USD did setup again, managed to catch it.

also caught the EUR/JPY.

You have no idea how you have changed my trading. All the years of reading, studying , practising and it took you to make the "penny drop" and for it all to fall into place.

Thanks man

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Good stuff!!!

its great when you see the trades as they are coming in!!!

I did 3 times my daily pip today as well!!

I tent to just watch one or two pairs so I mised the eur/jpy

Hi Teb, yes great setups today I traded on aud/jpy, aud/usd re entered on aud/usd for a 3rd time and lost last trade in fact all pairs were great even usd/cad.  Madness later on the euro and GBP if only we knew that was coming

its been a very very good week

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Everything looking pretty flat at the moment.

Anyone seeing different?

G-Man

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Im not sure about flat, but yes most of the pairs RSI on the 30min chart is sitting between the 55-45 channel, so waiting for it to move out into a direction before looking for entries.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Have a look at EUR/JPY.

Just caught a setup and it looks like it may be setting up again.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
30 min RSI still in NML though so if uyou are using that filter then it's no trade.

G-Man

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Hey Teb,

I just have a question about exiting, i've been wondering if it wouldn't be more profitable to exit your whole position at 10 pips, instead of just the first lot, or do you feel letting the 2nd lot run is the key to being profitable in the long run?

--- 帖子 #440 ---
I think today we will have to becarefull not to give back some money

the market is tight and flate.

And it might well be a turning around point.

teb

--- 帖子 #441 ---
yes ... I got 6 runners yesterday for 30 or more pips

I think just 10 pips, in the long run it will be hard to win.

(I am doing 20 pips plus spread on the 1st lot in the london and NY times, 10 pips plus spread on the 1st lot in  the asia.. goes with stop loss 1/1)

well

I am up a few pips for the day only (only 74)

I think I am going to call it a day

the nice thing about this system is it tells you when to stay out

of the market.

I do not see a trend anywhere, I want to ride .

We could trade supports but I have had a great week.

by the way, for those that got my trend/trade I called the market

flat to day almost across the board

bshcom can you post your forex power/trend strength indicator.

With this tool I can trade the strongest vs weaket pair or 2nd strogest vs 2nd weakest or 1 strongest vs 2nd weakest et, but only take the trade in the long term trend direction and also confirm trend continuation with a bounce off round number or supoport resistance.

This indicator along with TEB's great trend calls and by glancing at the dailys will give us a great way to select pairs.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
I asked this earlier, but I think you may have missed it.

Hey Teb,

Could you explain this a little more please.(With a chart if possible).

Angus.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Angus question was based on a statement I made a few weeks ago I believe "....but I mostly trade the break on the one min.,,"

(see post before this one ... last page)

candle formations would be the answer

if you like I could maybe do a teaching every week on key candle formations I use I think like 13 patterns .

If people would like me to.

cheers

teb

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Hi Teb

yes....it would be helpful for us to know what you mean by a break on the one minute....I am assuming you mean a break of the most recent high or low.

Understanding the candle formations you watch for would be fantastic

PGPB

Thanks for sharing!

--- 帖子 #454 ---
in fact I only trade 1 or two pairs at a time. I use two computers

but when I have a trade on, I am really only watching that one pair,

(sometimes I will have two pairs on)

I will often add to the trade when I am in a winning trade.

I like to keep it simple. The trend and trade calls are what I do to see what pairs I should look at for the day.

The system that you have shown us here is a really good one, but like anything it requires a lot of practice to get it right like you do. The part that is really difficult is that while we are trying to learn we have nothing to compare against.

I know this is a lot of work for you  but could I ask if you could please post some  screenshots each day of the trades you made.

That way we can go back and look at what we did and compare it to what you have done. It will also generate a bit of discussion for the forum so that we can all learn from each other.

An idea to think about

Bostan,

(Around 8am) Your entries are placed before the ma crossover. If you would have followed "the rules", you would have been stopped out, essentially trading the wrong side of the bounce.

I see you traded ma crossovers and price crossover the ma, but it's not consistent.

How did you anticipate which to use? Or were the arrows drawn after for illustration purposes?

I've written an "EA" for this system, but the trick is knowing where exactly the signal is placed during choppy markets.

Hello JM,

look better. I entered on 16.05 gmt +1 candle. End out to be a breakeven trade.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
trade Idea: I just send out by email

the eur/usd

and usd/cad

both sell

big trade

sell eur/usd under 1.2240

stop loss 1.2324

1st target 1.2153

2nd target 1.2103

teb63@live.com

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Teb, do you have a price to sell usd/cad or just follow normal system rules when to enter short?

--- 帖子 #481 ---
I will do both

but the euro might be a better

teb

--- 帖子 #482 ---
I am short.  I hope to get a runner now on the second lot.

mayby it will be moore easy to create some small blog or website instead of mails ? what do you think?

Hi Bostan.

Are you entered during the news?

--- 帖子 #486 ---
With three timeframes open, I have no time to look to news.

In my mind the daily bias was down.

Teb trend call was down

30M was down

5 M was also down.

This was enough to go down on 123 break.

Result = BE trade

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Hi Bostan,

Sorry I thought the arrows indicated where you entered and exited the trade.

This method has a lot of fake outs. 2 lot trading seems to be the key.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
just wondering what is the problem with the emails?

teb

--- 帖子 #489 ---
got 21 pips on the 1st lot, 42 pips on the 2nd  and 9 pips on the last two lots

for me its no problem;d

but sometimes mail is going <1min but sometimes on some mailboxes can go even couple hours right?

and for you will not be easier and faster?

lot of pips  !

to be honest not much for computers

or setting up a web sight

if someone wanted to help me with this

we could talk

other people have spoke about skype

again in the past I have done it

but its a lot of work.

I trade  with a few people now on it

but I rather teach in person

anyways I am open

I just do not have the ablity for to set up a web page

if it would be helpful great

People have repeatedly ask you for a chart and it seems you just ignore it. Are you just a system creator and use others to see if it works, or are you actually trading your systems? You must have a hundred systems by now from what I have seen. Show us the actual trades and by now you should know how to post a chart.

Wow... Teb has opened this thread and has shared a very good trading system. He has answered questions and even sends out e-mails. Now you come in and start making all these demands. Teb owes you nothing. And him showing you charts are not going to make you a successful trader. If you are not happy with what he offers you then there are plenty of other systems you can try out.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Thanks TEB

Looks pretty good so far...I know it's not the best MM but I will try to tighten it up.

for the reasons stated below

if you want to be added to morning reports send an email

Date: for May 28 Trend Strength

Eur/Usd Bear 8
Eur/Jpy Bear 8
Usd/Jpy Bear 6
Eur/Gbp Bear 8
Usd/Cad Bull 5
Aud/Usd Bear 5

Crude Oil Bear 7
Natural Gas 1 to 4 no trend (Neutral)
Gold Bull 7
Silver Bull 7

Key
Trend
Bear (down)
Bull (up)
Strength
7 & 8 Strong trend
5 & 6 Weak trend
1 to 4 no trend (Neutral)
I look to trading only 7 & 8
I will not trend trade 4 or below,no trend no trade.
· Best to trade a pair that does business in the time you are trading.
· The best days to trade trend are Tues, Wed, Thru.
· Worst times are Sunday night and Friday after 12noon EST.
· Only trade with the trend, use whatever set up you like.
· You make money on the exit!!!

Trading Idea

Take the day off .
Its Friday and the end of the month !
So we may see big moves out of no where as the big boys
adjust their books for week and month end.

the Euro is extreme right now
both the Euro C Bank and China C Bank
have said 1.22 is to low for the euro
ie they will buy to support it
1.25 will be a very hard area to get over

I still see us in a down trend

but with month end and the bank stepping in
it could change the "normal"

also if or when this turns it will move quickly
you do not want to be on the wrong side of it

on the charts I see two very different things

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

the 4 hour chart 20 rsi and 5 and 12 ema
we have a clear up trend
with a non confirmed breakout pattern and candle pattern
Strong up trend

(can not post here. shows emas down. Stoch turning down. price held by Bbands )
On the 3 hour chart we have price held by the Bbands and over buy!
again a non confirmed bounce, strong bear sign.
(I see this as the stronger of the 2 signs as it confirms the prevailing trend)

as the market is moving manly because of the euro
what happens to the euro will determined what happens to all the markets

I still see us in a strong down trend and we will visit 1.22 at least 1 more time
before we begin up ... if we are going up (lol)
but friday could be an interesting day.

cheers

Hey TEB,

How do you determine trend and the trend strength from your emails?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #502 ---
My trading was going up and down with no real gains.  Thanks for your system and your insight TEB.  I have learned a lot from you.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Dont look at the 1st and 2nd trade, i was testing something else out. This is my first trade with this system. The third trade on the 5min, is this what we are looking for, for entry as per your system?? Broke through emas, It retraced back to the 12 ema on the 30min chart, emas crossed, and trend down and then thats when i looked to enter on the 5min.

??? Im liking this system. Thanks.

Nice trade rolo. It was also a Bullish Butterfly pattern...

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Teb i checked your profile  i see that u have developed "couple" great systems ;D

do you think that this is the moust profitible? and easy to use?

how long will you gona stay in it?

--- 帖子 #507 ---
How do you determine the strenth of the trend and when you are in a trade how do you know when to get out, the reason why I ask is because I notice some of you guys are getting more than the usuall pips per trade. Some times I can be +10 and then get stoped out looking at the 30 min ema's still showing what looks like a strong down or up pattern.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Teb,

The easiest way for you to post charts is using screen capture software. I use JING by Techsmith which is simple, easy and free.

--- 帖子 #509 ---
This is very good and very very easy

and the main one I share with others.

I have used it or parts of it for 5 years.

I think it had most of what you need to be a good trader

ie, clear enteries & exits (targets), clear MM and MTF and so clear trends.

as for the most profitible,that would depend on the trader,

the markets of the day and what they want to trade

.. ie trend trading was hard today,Trading off S/R would have been great.

This systm is a breakout system with in a pull back system.

I think it is the safest way to trade. I like to make safe trades

I hate losing money but again that is me,

than its the time frame you like... I do not like holding over the night or weekend. I like to sleep and not worry.

one of my friends can not even make a trade in the same day he sees it.

he sees his' trades days & days before, he like to sleep on them before he takes them.

and holds trades for weeks or month and keeps adding to them that is him..

he is a very good trader

Cheers

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Thanks.  Glad im reading this system the right way.  Its really a simple system.  With more experiance with using this system ill be able to see more confirmations like you pointed out.

I entered with 2 lots, but had to go to gym so i just set a TP.  If i was around....i would have made more.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
In this particular setup......there were so many confirmations, i was really comfortable risking 10 pips for a bigger return.

Maybe wait for it to retrace back on the 30 min and 5 min and then wait for a red candle to close to confirm the pullback.  Im still new at this system so someone else will be able to better help you out.

I have read/noticed that plenty of people do get stopped out on this system alot.  But the profit can definatly exceed the loses on these setups.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
I am glad its working for you!!

I did 10 pips stop loss just on the Eurusd & Eurgbp

everything else I do 20 pips ( or Swing)

(in fact I am doing 20 pips SL on these pairs now to)

its easy

green over red 3 times

or

red over green 3 times

on 2 or 3 time frames(charts)

by the way I do not get stopped out very often (on the 1st lot)

I think the time you are trading is of note

having more then one lot and target is also of note,

to not getting stopped out.

Hi guys

there is a lot of talk about the Euro/Usd reversing

and no one can say what will happen; and if it does turn it could turn fast as we all know.

but let me say

1st. The day and 3(4) hour charts look very strong down.. bears in control

2nd. The Cott charts out on friday (from tuesday)

show no turn from the big boys at all from bears.

3rd. We still have a lot of bad news still to come out of South Europe.

4th. North Europe (Germany/ France) have not really helped this problem

in fact have done some strange things.

5th. The Euro counties still do not have plan.

Hello teb.

I have a question in your first post there is a note when to trade and when not.

I am gmt +3, I wanted to know what to you think is the best trading time for me?

If I would trade 7-12 am then I have to get up 5 a clock in the morning

And I like to sleep in

So what to you think?

Best wishes,

Danel.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Hi Danel

you are two hours a head of me (depending on daylight savings time)

best to just see when the London or Ny Ny trading starts in your time zone and do it. 7am your time I believe would not be a good time

for you to start.

cheers

teb

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Dear TEB,

I see you mark in the 30M chart at 18:30, in the M5 chart at 18:35. As I know that we need to wait until the 30M chart show candle close below MA. so its mean we only can trade in M5 start 19:00.

Please advise if its correct ?

Thanks n Regards,

MS

--- 帖子 #520 ---
also the 1 min came in 2 hours later, was i suppose to wait the 2 hours or was that just an example of what a confirmation looks like ?

--- 帖子 #521 ---
hi Teb,

a very good clear and well defined rules for your entry and exit and tf.

my only question is, does this suppose to be a quick trade? don't you ride you winners? or your just normally target 10pips + spread and the other position will be waiting until it will burn? or maybe i just didn't get it

just my thoughts mate, cheers!

--- 帖子 #522 ---
I put two lots on

one for 10 or 20 pips + spread

the other one to ride wave.

teb

--- 帖子 #523 ---
1st ...

only use the 1 min when you are good with the system

2nd ,,,

the one min is a refining on the 5 min entery

I was not showing a trade

it was just were the crosses where on the charts

--- 帖子 #525 ---
hi teb,

noted! thanks

dongsky

--- 帖子 #526 ---
I would think the opposite, no ? Doesn't the 1 min refine the entry ?

--- 帖子 #527 ---
? did we not say the same thing?

I use it more as a 2nd chance to get in,

the 30 min and 5 min are all up and up so where can I get in on this up trend.

oh the 1 min chart gives me a good place.

to be honest I likely do half my trades on the 1 min chart

but you have to understand the system or you will get burned. a lot!!!

the 5/30 min system is safer and way easier and you will get lots and lots of pips.

****and never never simply do a cross entery on the 1 min chart it will not work.

cheers

--- 帖子 #529 ---
so its mean I need to wait until the 30M candle close below the MA ? and start to entry the trade on M5 or M1 ?

Pls advise

Thanks,

--- 帖子 #530 ---
have you read the thread?

ok

1st. 30 min candle closes in a clear trend. look for a set up on the 5 min.

2nd.  you look to buy/sell in the trend of the 30 min trend on the 5 min chart.

3rd. if the 30 min and 5 min are going the same way in trend

you use the 1 min to get in,

but get to know 5/30 min well before you use the 1 min. or you will lose

and do not simply enter on ema crosses on the 1 min you will get killed.

cheers

Hi Teb

Would you consider using the ADX filter alongside your system to help reduce false signals.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #532 ---
no... ADX .... I find it is to slow for 4x personally,

but if you like it, use it and not the rsi.

do not use both, do your own set up make it yours

you can win in the fx but it takes work

a set of rules you like and stick to them .

having seen 100s of good threads on ff all die

because people added stuff and stuff

simple is better but almost any tool will work.

***and you will have loses, that is part of trading.

MTF is the gold key to trading that is the point.

but for this thread
the set up is as already stated.

thanks and cheers

--- 帖子 #533 ---
yes, done read it.

Only want to ensure one more time. that I need to wait until the 30 min candle closed in clear trend. only I looking the trade on 5 min.

The eur is in free fall :

I think we may see a small bounce north esp. with the holiday
monday or tuesday and a lot of "dump" money will buy in,
The big boys will take some money and let price set up for more of a run down.

but  unless we have a big change we are in free fall,

On the week chart we have closed below the last two BIG lows

Hi Teb

I would like to ask when is the second (runner) at optimum? I.E. when is it good to take profit. What is your experience?

On the longer time frames following PSAR seems to get a good portion of the move but on 5 mins the PSAR is sensitive. On some occasions, I have taken profit when 5 min PSAR turned - and then see it turn in my original direction WITHOUT me on board.

Hope you can share when the best time/setup to close out the position - as the closing of positions is what determines how much you ultimately profit.

Thank you and Cheers.

Hi Teb

Thanks for your reply. Sorry but being new, I don't quite understand what you are saying.

Or maybe my question was wrongly worded - let me try again. Entry with 2lots - When target 1 of 10 or 20 is met, take profit on first lot and move the stop on second lot to Breakeven (so that lot 2 is a free trade and the worst thing that can happen is you breakeven) With the saying "let your runners run" I would like to ask you, from your experience, what is the best way to catch the maximum run on this second lot i.e. how to let this runner run to its maximum potential.

What patterns or hints/Clues do you look for to tell you that it is time to take $$$ and close the runner position?

Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
2nd

ok

swing lows and highs

just keep moving your stop loss each time you make a new swing.

in an up trend every higher low .. put your stop loss 2 pips (plus spread if you have any) below the swing.

also is the trend and trade calls helpful.

I will not be posting trend and trade calls tonight
as tomorrow is NFP and so it really doesn't matter

for those who do not know, it the one day of the month to not trade

(a lot of great trades do not trade Wed or Thru.  before as the market does a lot of silly things before this report  ie. last night.)

Trend and trade calls are helpful. But it would also be nice to get a feel for how you determine these calls. Of course this is something you can achieve overnight, but a little information, e.g. like some of the charts you have been providing to provide further insight would be most welcome.

Kind regards,

Hi TEB

I'm following the GBP with your system and I know its NPF day but for interesting sake, how would you deal with a gem like the support at 1.4645 with respect to your system. Looks like a lot of buy orders at that level, bears are struggling to break it for now. I would play a buy breakout what's your opinion.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Must say I am only following the eur/usd (and usd/jpy in the evenning)
Because the euro is so easy to trade right now!!!

The pound is not in free fall at this time.
I in fact do not know what I would do, I think it will follow the euro.
But the charts are not as easy to trade right now.
It’s up and down on other time frames.

One of the things I might say
Is find an"easy dance partner"
I like the euro and when I can trade it I do
But if she wants to play "hard" I will find a better target

Ie.  A few weeks a go the Aud/usd was an" easier lady" then the Eur/Usd was.

The pound is a very hard pair to trade, in fact I started years ago as my 1st pair .... but moved away because I had loses.
Bigger winner then the eur but a lot ... lot ...lot more losses
But to each their own.

If you are risk taker its great (anf go get them lol)
... my problem is  I am a cowerd lol

yes I see the dance as the 2 with in the pair,

its just finding a strong and weak side. (male and female)

I like the big guys (male0

USD, EURo, JPY, (strongest or weakest of them)

now who will they dance with (female)... USD, EURo, JPY, Cad, Aud Gbp are the 6 I use

I look for the opp in strength/weakness to the male

(Chf & NZD are 2 I might look at as well sometimes )

Divergence with price and Cot
well guys: Divergence with price and Cot

I see the euro still dropping this week:

I think the French Pres may have tried to put up a fire break at 1.7 on friday
when he said he thinks that is a good price,

but we are now in a place of Divergence with price and Cot.
(is the trading of the big boys they lead the market)

and vol is dropping on the weekly chart as price is dropping at the same time.
so this means the big boys are buying as dumb money are selling... right.

The big boys are 25% less short on the Eur/Usd in the last two weeks.
I cannot wait to see next fridays cot report I think the big boys got rid of a lot in the NFP.

I find with euro we see the revesral on the 2nd Divergence
which happen not to long after the 1st.
So we could see a bounce even up into the 1.22 area.
then a drop into the 1.6 area.

I think the run is coming to an end, but not just yet

By the way
1.we had a lot of shorts closed in NFP by the big boys.(!!!)
2. price dropped on very low vol after NFP
so the big boys where not selling in to the dip.(!!!)

I said I though europe would get its rear in gear at 1.2
I still think they did try. we will see what they can do.

I will be bear this week but mostly small targets (I will be looking for runners of coarse)

on the other side
1. The charts say BEAR (week, day 4 hour)
2. News says BEAR (news we know of)

One other note the market is now saying Hungery is not as bad as hungery
said it was friday and it may have been he was the reason for the big drop.

Hi Teb,

Interesting and simple. How about my main trigger is on M15 (to entry and exit), so which higher TF you suggest as a trend confirmation? If so, what's the combination of EMAs and RSI?

Thanks in advance

Cheers

--- 帖子 #581 ---
I would follow the rule of 4 to 6

(the higher the time frame the lower the rule)

so if you want your lowest time frame to be 15 min I would do

15 min, 1 hour, 4 hour (rule of 4)

I do 1 min 5 min 30 min (almost rule of 6 lol)

Hey Teb.

I have a question, i´m bit confused, how to you define the right signal?

I have ema 5 and 12 on my chart and rsi 21.

when do I enter? do I enter on the cross of the ema-s ? and what should the rsi be?

Best wishes,

Danel.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
both need to be crossed in the same direction.

either can cross 1st.

lets say both are down on the 30 min chart

we then wait for the sign on the 5 min.

we are warned of a possible entery

when either one of the 2 cross

then we wait the others crossing then we are in.

have you thought about using DEMA or TEMA instead of EMA? It has less noise.

How many trades do you do per day in average and how many are winners / losers? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #592 ---
no I like the ema.

but it doesn't really matter as my triggers are candle formations

not crosses .

16 to 30 trades a day (I almost always trade in pairs )

1st lot 90%

2nd lot like 50% (40% break even 10% losses)

Thanks for the trend calls and the work on the second candle formation that you sent today.

In the email you mention:

"4.      Here is the secret, go one time trade frame up and see what the trend is on that time frames."

So as I understand this, if we find the formation on the 5min chart we then go to the 15min chart to see that the RSI is in the same direction.

Is this correct?

Thanks Teb

Hello TEB,

Hi TEB

What is the rules: if the 5M is ready before the 30M. Do you enter as soon as the 30M is ready or wait for a retrace or new cross.

Thanks

Shanexx

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Shanexx- from what I have picked up about the system, I believe you wait for confirmation on the 30 ( or whatever larger time frame you wish) and then as is often the case the 5minute ( or shorter time frame) has already turned some time back- but that is ok because you don't want to be entering on the shorter time frame without the backing of the big turn first.

Then I believe there is a matter of discretion . It involves waiting for the 5 min to RSI20 to retrace perhaps as far as the 50% line then turn back in your direction.

This probably means the price candles on the shorter time frame will come back against you somewhat providing a better entry. This is where you search for a "reversal candle formation as the icing on the cake to enter the market.

If I am wrong there I am really happy for someone to correct me.

Thanks

raycam

It would be very helpful for everyone , if you could post your entries on Eurusd today.

Where abouts did you take the 12 entries ?

--- 帖子 #612 ---
no wait for the 5 min to reset after the 30 min gives you a trend

you are entering into a trend

its a higher % of wins.

Outside Candle (Engulfing Candle)
This pattern consists of two candles. 1st. Stranded candles. 2nd. Engulfing candle.
The 1st candle is a narrow range candle that closes down.
The sellers are still in control of the pair but because it is a narrow range candle,
and volatility is low, the sellers are not very aggressive.
The 2nd. Candle is a wider range candlestick that “engulfs” the body of the first candle,
and closes near the top of the range. The buyers have overwhelmed the sellers
(demand is greater than supply). Buyers have "taken over". The bulls are in control

When to take this trade (i.e. in an uptrend, in a down trend reverse everything here)
1. Take the trade as soon as the engulfing candle closes.
2. One pip over the top of the engulfing candle (Pink line)
3. Only trade if you are with the trend on the chart. Here we are using 20 RSI, RSI over 50.
a MACD, CCI, STOCH etc will all do as well.
4. Here is the secret, go one time trade frame up and see what the trend is on that time frames.
Check it on the RSI 20 (MACD etc) only trade if both time frames are inline.

Stop Loss
The bottom of the Engulfing candle. Is the Green line

Target
1st. Target (1st lot) Blue line.
you wing this target by measuring this target ... Line B (white) = Line A (red)
When you hit 1st. target move your stop loss up on the 2nd lot to break even +1 and spread
and let it run.

Best treading idea
reversal on the 5 min chart back to the main trend on the 30 min trend . .

Hello TEB63

May be it's better to write (50 or 100 ie 1.3550 1.3600) without the "1" in the middle of the number.

see page 1, #1

- I target the next round number (50 or 100 ie 1.3550 1.13600)

Why aren't there GBPJPY and EURCHF?

--- 帖子 #634 ---
I prefere to use the indicators RSI(14) and CCI (14) and trade if they make valleys or peaks. Why? You are earlier in and out with lower risk. The CCI (14) indicator has much more variable selectivity and discriminatory power.

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Hey.

Okey I´m still on demo with this, I am still learning and finding the right system and indicators for me.

Right now I have on M30 ema 12 and 5, rsi 21 and currency strength indicator.

Teb, on the 5min chart if you look at 4-5 bars before the area we can see a setup that looks exactly like the one in the circled area. It would have been a loser if taken, but the one in the area you circled turned out to be a winner. What made you not take the trade 4-5 bars ago ?

--- 帖子 #642 ---
haha, at least it's honest !

yes, the advantage of trading on 5min charts or even 1min is that we keep the losses relatively small.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
I was still in bed lol

truth is I might have it and lost... that is trading

the only thing I will say Is

I do not trade between 5 and 7 am est

even 7 and 8 am has to be a great set up which this one was.

and there was a better candle formation on the second one as well

(but I was still in bed for the 1st one lol )

It is really good to find this thread.

I was trading the crossing on 5M and it doesn't always work due to my MM as well as the market behavior.

I think this will improve my entry rate as I tend to miss out of a good run after I take profit on my target.

I uses EMA 5 and 15 but it all works similarly.

Thanks again TED.

Inside Candle ( Harami)
This pattern consists of two candles. 1st. Candle (Mother Candles. Grey).
2nd. Candle (Inside Candle. White)
The 1st. Candle (mother candle) is a range candle.
The Buyers are still in control of the pair because of the push up.
and volatility is high, the buyers are very aggressive.
The 2nd. Candle is a narrow range candlestick that “inside” the body of the mother candle,
and the middle of the range. The buyers and sellers wanting to see who is in charge.
(Demand is equal to supply). No one is in control.

When to take this trade (i.e. in an uptrend, in a down trend reverse everything here)
1.Take the trade one pip over 1st. mother candle (1st. candle. Grey)
2.Only trade in the direction of the trend on chart. Here we are using 20 RSI, RSI over 50.
a MACD, CCI, STOCH etc will all do as well.
3.Here is the secret, go one time trade frame up and see what the trend is on that time frames.
Check it on the RSI 20 (MACD etc) only trade if both time frames are inline.
ie. 5 min go to the 15 min chart.

Stop Loss
Safe stop. 1 pip below the bottom of the 1st. Candle (mother candle, grey). the brown line... or
Aggressive stop, 1 pip below the bottom of the 2nd. Candle (inside candle, white). the purple line,

Target
1st. Target (1st lot) green line.
you fine this target by measuring this target ... Line A (yellow) = Line B (red)
100% of the mother candle.
when you hit 1st. target move your stop loss up on the 2nd lot to break even +1 and spread
and let it run.

Best treading idea
continue trend on the 5 min chart as on the on the 30 min trend. .

TEB.. have you found by your experience that scaling out of trades by taking a lot out at target 1, etc. is more profitable in the long run than the alternative of just moving stops up on multiple lots without scaling out?

--- 帖子 #685 ---
yes I normally get something

and a few times a week I get a home run

I do not have to choose

I get the bunt and the home run

why?

--- 帖子 #693 ---
i also hit SL.

when higher TF continues short, lower TF turns short, turns long and turn short again. can we keep taking shorts ?  or we should allow higher TF to flip and then watch lower TF to take trades

always the first trade (first time when both higher TF, lower TF agrees) will have better chances than subsequent trades

--- 帖子 #694 ---
it will be nice to get a indicator that takes multiple pairs and multiple TF (like M5, M30 or H1, H4) and lists Higher TF status (long or short) and lower T status (long or short) and gives alert when both TF are short or long

Ive plotted a trendline on the EU m5, although its only got 2 points on it right now, price seems to be reacting on it and bouncing off to go higher...If this area breaks it would be safe for a short but we got alot of support near the 53 area on the Euro...

Interesting. Missed getting on the first nice short earlier on the Euro today, so being careful of other moves now.

--- 帖子 #698 ---
As I said, a break of the trendline will be good to take a small short. Profit target should be reached for anybody by now, TP was around 53 which is heavy support.

Have a good evening gents.

--- 帖子 #701 ---
TEB,

Once again I'm slightly confused. In your last e-mail you had EURUSD had as a  trend strength of 1-4 neutral, and as you already stated you do not trade '4's. Also it was a Monday. Could you please explain why you entered these trades. Was it some pattern of behaviour in the EURUSD etc, i.e. did the '4' neutral suddenly become an 8 bear?

Trying to understand...

Kind regards,

--- 帖子 #702 ---
Teb, can you please post your trade entries for today. Eurusd

can not post oanda sorry

that is why once and awail (esp easly morning) I post MT4 charts

I did a few aud/usd early in the morning the rest were eur/usd.

The crosses enter. Some times I will do crosses;

but more often I do candle formations to enter or patterns.

(tomorrow I will send the strongest candle formation

if you are on my list you will get it if not email me and I will send it to you)

Hi 4X

there was nothing to trade.

Its important to read what I right I said "we will not trend untill the euro makes up its mind..." I believe it did,

Big Trend reversal on the 5,15,30 min charts .. I will take that.

What I send out is from the night before but the forex is a living market,

I think with the "thoughts of a war" will change the FX for sure.,

I think its good to see where the trends are

but be open to see when they change

The numbers I send out work 6 out of 7 days

but on the 1 out of 7 I look to see what I can do.

I hope that is helpful

teb

--- 帖子 #706 ---
If you can post MT4 charts that's great. We just would like to see which candle formations you used this morning as a live trading example. I think that would be helpful for many of us here. You could make a screenshot of a MT4 chart and put a square box on the candle formation you entered for instance.

Can't post a chart my ass, thats been your line for years. BULLSHIT!

I'll help you out - try screenhunter-free.en.softonic.com

Now post some of your trade for your followers so they can see

if you are for real or not. I could care less, but you sure have started

alot of system threads but with no follow through to your followers.

They really need to learn to depend on themselves and not someone

No trend trading : Until the euro makes up its mind
The pairs will not be trending . Trade range trading today.

TEB 5ema & 12ema and 20 RSI (MTF)

use on 30 min & 5 min charts

I use 5 ema and 12 ema

I use the 20 RSI at 50

http://cdn.forexfactory.com/attachme...1&d=1270208293

I trade two lot at a time

Asia time: 1st lot target 11 pips + spread & stop loss 10 pips

NY and London times:1st lot target 21 pips + spread & stop loss 20 pips

2nd. lot move to break even (BE) when 1st lot is taken out

moving up the stop loss with every swing unill I am taken out.(ie in an up trend every swing lower)

If I cannot be at my computuer

- I target the next round number (50 or 100 ie 1.3550 1.13600)

- S/R

Other stuff

1. better % on pull backs and break outs then on the crosses.

2. You need to know when to trade and when not to trade (very important )

-3am to 5am est

-7am to 12noon est

-maybe 8pm to 10pm, est

-no holidays

-Becareful of new events ie 8:30 am and 10:00am est

3. I trade only the big pairs,I trade mostly on the eur/usd !!!

the other two main ones would be usd/jpy and the eur/gbp

then if no trend on these I would look at the usd/cad or the aud/usd or the eur/jpy

4. More advanced add add a 1 min.chart

thank you so much teb for the summary.

i am seeing you are trading based on candle formations also. in that case you are not using ema. you are using only RSI. is that true ?

--- 帖子 #721 ---

--- 帖子 #724 ---
TEB,

On the example you show where is the actual entry?

It looks like 1.3550 or thereabouts, short at the RED ARROW, which means, in this case, the trade was a loser, correct?

On my charts, assuming I have the correct reference points, price got as low as 1.3543 and then reversed to a high of 1.3568.

If this is not the case then please provide the actual entries and exits or stops in this example.

Thanks,

I have shown two full trades in the last week.

you want me to show you everything I have learned in 7 yrs

and do it all for free?

One of the best things a new or even an experienced trader can do is to is to read all of TEB's threads to learn about ways to do MTF trading and price action.

Most of those who read this thread appreaciate the time that TEB spends on it.

Candle Formations .. 3 Candle Reversal  .. With Pin Candle

One of my favourite candle formations is the 3 candle reversal  .. variation with a big pin candle (nose or tail)The “Pin” is the big shaddow on the 2nd candle in the formation. I call them “nose or tail”.  . (ie. The chart I am using is an up trend: Reverse everything in a down trend)

Here is a trade I took. when I see one as clear as this one I will take it and say thanks!

Set Up

1. We want to see this Candle formation at the end of a strong trend. The longer the better .
I like at lest 10 candles in the trend . An up trend is higher highs and higher lows.
2. We want to see a big Pin Candle (2nd candle) . the Pin part of the candle . the bigger the better .
Of coarse the tail/nose going opposite to the old trend.
3. Best if the Pin Candle’s colour is opposite to the old trend’s colour.
4. Get in 1 pip (plus spread) below candle 3 in the pattern. white line.
5. Often it will be the 4 candle you enter on, but not always.
6.1st target  (blue line) the number of pips from the top of Pin Candle (2nd candle)(pink line)                                    to bottom of 3rd  Candle (white line) : pink line to white line. = white line to blue line.
7. Stop loss a few pips into the nose/tail

Strongest trading use:
1st  Reversal on the 5 min chart to the main trend on  the 30 min chart/ trend.
2nd  Reversal on the 1 min chart to the main trend on the 5/30 min chart/ trend.

Hi Teb, I'm a trader of 3 years. I would like to thank you for your method of trading. the method I was using before was my own. It was a good method but my SL's were always twice as much as my TP's causing me to have 3 wining trades to make up for one loss. I love how your system trades. The locking in of 10 pips and using the swings to protect profit is genius! I've been trying to redefine my ideas so that they work like this system. Just could never quite grasp it. Saw your post and instantly realized that all my disconnected ideas were put together right here.

Although I've only been using your strategy for 2 days I can instantly tell it's a long lasting. I've now taken 10 trades and I've had 0 losses. Thanks again for the glorious ideas. Sorry about all the lamo's on the forums that harass you. They're ether just stupid or just plane babies that don't want to work for there success.

P.S.

I'll be fallowing your every post from now one. Your methods are great!

--- 帖子 #760 ---
i just apply TEB rules..thats all, no hidden technique though..okay for example, u looking for trend 1st at the TF M30..once the EMA 5 and EMA 12 is crossed and the RSI above 50..your entry is the next candle after the current candle is closed..u put a vertical line on the next candle where u would put your entry, then after that you switch your time trame to TF M5..then you can put your entry..for me, as i dont know when the trend would end..thats why i use trailing stop, after that if you want, you can ride the trend and scalping at the TF M1..as for today, there are 2 signal at the TF M30..i got 50pips twice 9 hour ago and 70pips twice just now on Eur/Usd..

Hello TEB

I have a question I am bit confused, okey I look the trend in M30 then switch to M5 look the cross there. But could I switch to M1 instead, and there look for the cross? Or what is the best time-frame M1 or M5?

Best wishes,

Danel.

Hello.

Could you explain this: u put a vertical line on the next candle where u would put your entry,  then after that you switch your time trame to TF M5..then you can put  your entry..for me, as i dont know when the trend would end..thats why i  use trailing stop, after that if you want, you can ride the trend and  scalping at the TF M1

thank you TEB，you are a very kind man，but i have 2 questions，when you determine the tend ，5and 12ema crossover，rsi20cross50 at the same time is very easy ，but they often one appear at first ，and the other later，is that also the tend confirm？？？and the entry on 5min chart is the same question.

--- 帖子 #782 ---
both have to be in the right way not just one !!

this is very key !!

normally it will be one then the other .

its nice because you see the set up a mile away,

when you have a confirmed trend on the 30 mins

you can then and only then look for what is really a re-entey on the

5 mins again you want both the rsi and emas crossed right with the trend on the 30min chart

hi guys

when people start trading they always want to get every move and every pip. well you can get every move but you wil get a lot of false moves too.

you can trade as I do and get the sweet spot and a lot of the moves and a few losses

or you can hunt tops and bottoms and get longer rides and way more pips

but way way more loses. This is very ok as long as you keep you loses small and run your winners

but what I have seen, this is very hard to do when you are new to the fx

the way I trade is easier but may not be better !!

anyways you have to choice: sweet spot or tops and bottom trader most people can not do both.

I can do one or the other but I have never been much good at doing both at the same time

cheers

Hi, TEB63

First thanks a lot for your system, your advices and your very good calls. Keep going, please.

By the way, I've found this very nice indicator for your system. It draws the MA, it displays an arrow (Up/Down) when MAs & RSI vs 50Line are OK.

On the other hand, I can't get any alert and playsound ??? If anybody could fix this (little ?) bug.. I would be very grateful.

Regards

Hello everyone

I'm new here.  Just finished reading the entire thread.  Its nice to have finished a thread and its still active.  Feel like I know everyone already. I have 3 years of demo and learning, 1 year of actual live trading.  I found the holy grail 6 times and, well, none of them worked out.  Anyway, in the last year, I have employed a standard 3/6/9 EMA and traded based on when the pair went into trend.   I've always used the bollinger bands to help with entry and exit.  I've decided to shake it up and trade based on TEB's rules.  Placed 2 trades last night on the USD/JPY

1.  Went in at 9:20 pm est. at 88.43, out at 88.30 for 10 pips

2.  Went in at 9:50 pm est. at 88.31, out at 88.18 for 10 more

Thanks Teb, gonna give this a solid try.

BTW, does anyone employ the use of Bollinger Bands?  I find them extremely helpful

I don't read candles very well, will work on that

Have a great day everyone

Hi Teb,

do you pay attention to Daily Pivots, S&R lines or Fibs? Or do you just concentrate on the RSI after the EMA cross?

--- 帖子 #843 ---
DP no

S&R : yes

patterns : yes

candle patterns : yes

Fibs : no

-but I do watch the 0% 50% 100% - But these are not fibs.

Candle formation 5: Railway Tracks out of positions

When to take this trade (i.e. in a down trend, in a uptrend reverse everything here)
1. Look for big candles, out of the trend and out of position.
2. Take the trade one pip under the lower of the 2 candles. Here it is the 2nd. candle(red).
3. Only trade in the direction of the trend on chart. Here we are using 20 RSI, under 50.
...a MACD, CCI 20, STOCH 20 etc will all do as well.
4. Here is the secret, go one time trade frame up and see what the trend is on that time frame.
Check it on the RSI 20 (MACD etc) only trade if both time frames are inline.
ie. 5 min go to the 15 min chart.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Enter:
Two lots.

Stop Loss
1 pip + spread over the top of the higher of the 2 candles here it is 1st. Candle (green).

Target
1. 1st. Target (1st. lot) purple line.
2. You fine this target by measuring... Line A (light purple = Line B line green)
3. When you hit 1st. target move your stop loss down on the 2nd. Lot to break even +1+ spread and let it run. Let it swing out!

Best treading idea
Look for this candle formation in news times and the opening and closing of markets.

Note: This candle formation on a higher time frame will be a big pin (nose or tail) formation.

Hi TEB,

I just finished reading the whole thread and i'm really glad i found this. What i really like is that you didn't change your system since you posted it, and you are teaching the same thing from the very beginning very sure that this works. Most thread starters here at FF expect the community to help them upgrading their systems, and after 100 pages you have 20 new indicators, 5 versions and so on.

I just sent you an email with request to add me to the mailing list.

sorry I missed this post

you can always tell which way I am going just check the 30 mins chart ,

for a 5 min trade. here it was bear- south!

if I am trading off the 30 min chart just check the 3 hour chart

as I always get the trend off the one chart time frame higher.

(4 to 6 princible)

the trading chart would also have to be turning bear - south as well of coarse.

not really concerned with the 1 min chart ,,, trigger chart here.

cheers

Did i understand it right

If the Trend is upwards and the M30 EMA crossed upwards and the RSI is above 50 than go to the M5 Chart and wait till the EMA crosses upwards and the RSI crosses 50 and then go long?

lol ... kind of doing tomany things

ok yes

the 30 min chart is the trend chart

the 5 min chart is the trade chart want a good price

the 1 min is the trigger chart ( if you use it)

so the 30 min is up

so you will only go up on the 5 min

Hi TEB thanks for this gr8 system, made me 60 pips yesterday and 50 today, so far xD

--- 帖子 #914 ---
Hi TEB

Please could you help me with something I am struggling with.

I keep picking the wrong pullbacks.

example:

- The RSI and moving averages of on the 30min chart are all going down.

- On 5 in chart, the RSI goes above 50 line and then drops below again.

- On 5 min chart the 5EMA crosses the 12EMA downwards.

- I enter trade only to find that the trend is changing and the price does not  move lower but instead starts upwards.

The smaller time frame will always react first to a change in the trend. So the 30min chart will still be showing a downtrend but the 5 min could already have changed to the new uptrend.

Could you give me any ideas of how I could avoid this. It is strange, it is like a magnet for me at the moment as I keep catching this type of setup.

Thanks TEB

--- 帖子 #915 ---
same as mine.pl help TEB

--- 帖子 #916 ---
yes wait for a break of a S/R

after the emas and rsi cross

also what is the time you are trading?

teb

--- 帖子 #917 ---
Hi TEB

I have tried different times. Those that you recommended as well as others.

What I am finding is that the trend is like throwing a stone across the water. It bounces on top until it finally runs out of steam and sinks.

Sometimes it bounces once, sometimes twice etc.

I just do not know how to identify the "pullback" that is not actually a pullback but changes into the reversal. The final skip of the stone on the water

--- 帖子 #918 ---
mine is 3.00am est to 5.00 am est & 7.00am est to 12.00 noon est.But problem is to determine the S/R.I m using cobra's daily pivots as S/R.{indicator name---THV4 TzPivotsD(Black)}.

--- 帖子 #919 ---
Hi TEB,usdjpy is going to build a set up in 5 min.30 min is already there. is not it ? but i m finding a support ard 87.23.

--- 帖子 #920 ---
I am no expert, but take note that the 30min chart has reached a previous low S&R and also a pivot point. This could prevent further moves to the downside.

--- 帖子 #921 ---
DP do not work the reason is there are to many kinds now.

In stock the DP based at closing work well

In 4X there is no closing

closing Ny Ny work is the best  DP because of futures.

Other ones are a waste of time.

wait for the close below on the 5 min

then look for a 1.2.3 break. of R/S

trading really begin in the NY time at 8am est.

before that is dangerour but about now I am looking at set up

9:30 the stock market opens and we have a bang.

8:30 and 10:00 we have reports and more bangs

cheers

I would wait till the EMA 5 and 12 are crossing upwards and the RSI is crossing the 50 on the M5 Chart like in your chart about 15:30 candle.So the M30 is pointing upwards and the M5 is going upwards too.That how i understand the system and hope that it is right ;-)

Hello TEB63,

tell me please what i did wrong?

trend on M30 is down, M5 EMA's cross and RSI is down, i entered, but reverse.... and then SL (((

Thnx for the answer.

--- 帖子 #939 ---
The move had already happened, you came in too late....if a big drop has already happened.....then it is likely to retrace.....it looks like you took the trade just before lunch (NY time) traders have made their money and now are closing postions (so price rises as they liquidate their sells)

PS. Why have TRIX and RSI on the same chart?

If you are going to learn Teb's system.....why try to improve it?

--- 帖子 #940 ---
Hi Teb, on your chart the M5 RSI is 14 .....?

--- 帖子 #941 ---
its the standerd setting ... my mistake

I took the real trade on oanda

thanks and sorry

it should be 20

teb

--- 帖子 #942 ---
This was in response to new users with the "I keep picking the wrong pullback so how do I get the right one" question.  I would add a couple of points ( slap me down if needed Teb  )

The fact is that you are likely to get wrong pullbacks as well as right ones.  But.  If you watch the market you'll find a rhythm.  Like, 30m rolls over, then you get a couple of 5m pullbacks that will work.  Then on 3 or 4 they do a major pullback that will either stop you out and then keep going or reverse completely.   Get a feel for that sort of pattern and you won't be getting into the "damn it was too late" pullbacks too often.

On the daily pivots.  IMexperience two times are worth considering.  All others are rubbish (the same applies to daily and H4 bars).

Time one is the one that TEB is talking about.  Its what I call globex midnight because it applies to all the futures contracts.  Globex closes and reopens an hour later (at 17:00 ct I think).   This is MIDNIGHT for all the currency and financial futures.  I get that by SierraChart's trading clock to Athens.

Two hours after the globex midnight you get the London midnight (GMT) and its often almost the same price as globex so the pivots for London and futures are very close to the same.  The max number of traders around the world start their serious trading on London open so it's probably the most observed midnight.

FWIW.

Hi there what are these charts of and what time frame?

every pair you can find trend on some time frame

what I am calling for is high % trade where

you can get a lot of pips

and be free of reversals hopefully (lol)

ie. use of cover charts, free from the Big 'D"

S/R and trend lines ETC

Hi TEB63!

I like the way you determine the trend for day to day trading.

I want to know when you stop enter a trade before the new releases ( 30 min or 1 hour before the new releases).

Thanks

--- 帖子 #961 ---
Dear TEB,

It is one of the best threads I came along. I think most value is in consistency, not trying any fancy tune ups and such, this way destroying system.

In any case my question would be following.

Is the EUR/USD the only pair where you have 10pip SL, except when you choose 20pip SL?

Is it always you keep TP and SL  1:1?

And which pairs you use 20pip SL and TP always? Is it volatile GBP/USD or EUR/JPY.

I know by time I would choose best setup myself, but before that just would like to have your profesional input.

Thank you in advance.

BR,

--- 帖子 #962 ---
Hello TEB,

One more question, to you hope you can help me out.

Lets say 7a.m. EST (New your time) I open up a chert of 30 min with indicators which should be there and see that EMA's are crossed for a while, price is above or below EMAs depending on it, and RSI is above 50, say this is valid for 20 bars. Do I look to 5 min chart to trade this as trend, or it is best once crossover happens either in EMAS or RSI?

Somehow it is hard to figure this, or should I scan higher TF to make assumtion of trend?

Thank you in advance,

--- 帖子 #963 ---
Helo TEB,

If im planning to apply this system on a monthly, weekly and daily(entry) time frame, what ema is the best? will ema 5 and ema 12 be good?

thank you.

I want to add my thanks to Teb for posting this strategy - it ain't hard and I make money when I follow the rules.  Indicator haters will throw out their reasons as to why indies don't work but indicator do do something - they indicate even if a little late (and not by much in the shorter time frames.)  I am glad that it has been pointed that one shouldn't ignore S/R, candlestick patterns, PA, etc., which helps me stay out of bad trades.

I confess I like the 1/2 out at +10 pips, move to BE+1, & let the rest run.  I even feel a bit smug that I have beaten the market at its own game.  I always felt that scaling in made more sense but I never got the hang of doing that properly or profitably.  Thanks to everyone for sharing your tips and suggestions.  Good trading all, p.

The rules are all the same like in post 1. No changes needed.

Teb -

How much of a time lapse is safe between the 30M & the 5M?  That is, if the 5M just crossed but the 30M crossed 2 hours previously then should this trade be taken?  I know the 30M is the setup but how long is it safe to wait for the 5M to comply?

I really appreciate your strategy: I funded an Oanda acct on 5/10 and it has never been in the black but I am within .22 cts of being back to BE.

Thank you.  piprac

In long on eur/usd at the moment. 1st lot out at + 10, 2nd lot still going at the mo but there not much happening currently. 2nd lot at +10 so hoping for price to shoot up any second!! nice stress-free system so far. 3rd trade today on eur/usd. first two were both out at +10 on first lot and BE for second lot. up 30 pips today.

--- 帖子 #999 ---
In short on eur/usd. 5min was short, entered on the 1 min. 30 min dropped under a previous low. 1st lot out at +10. second at BE

--- 帖子 #1000 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Moved SL on 2nd lot to the last swing on the 5min to lock in +10 pips. price dropping nicely at mo.

............Moved SL to next 5 min swing. +20 locked in now on the 2nd lot

................Moved SL to next swing. +30 pips locked in now

.......................Moved SL to next swing on the 1min as price seems to be stalling and there was a medium news on the board. now +40 locked in.

.....All is well again. SL moved to lock in +50

...Closed trade at +110 pips!

Hi Iak

Not sure your short trade followed the rules of this system. But as long as you made money, that's the important thing.

Seems like the EUR/USD is setting up for short trades now. (15:50)

--- 帖子 #1003 ---
Im not sure either lol!

Got out of trade at +110 pips. I know it wasnt exactly by the book but i have the same set-up and 30, 5 and 1 min in front of me. Took 6 trades today. First 3 +10 on 1st lot and BE on 2nd. next 2 trades i lost -5pips x2 and then again. Then i could see tide was turning on the 30 so i decided to go with what the 5 and 1 were saying. prob just got lucky today. Anyway, very pleased. gunna give my eyes a rest now and finish my taxes!!

That's OK then. So long as I'm not mis-reading my charts.

The E/$ crossed down on the 30M TF at 07:30 CDT/US. Caught +32 pips; sell @ 1.2896, TP 1.2864. One of the hazards of "set & forget" is that the pair is now around 1.2800 or lower! But my 32 are in the bank and I'm done for the week - have a nice weekend all. p.

edit - "prob just got lucky today." per iak.   I was watching a reality crime show and one of the detectives said that he would rather have a partner that was lucky than good.  Nice job, wish I could train myself to get up at 1 a.m. & trade the London but the N.Y. session will have to do.

Hi TEB,

Can you post a chart when you enter a trade so we can see your analysis and timing an entry. It is very important to determine a trend  and very very important to enter a trade at the right moment.

Have a nice weekend

Thanks

Hi Teb,

I just finished reading the thread, thanks for the simple system, its rather simple with the exception of using candle sticks to determine PA, which i feel requires quite a bit of discretion.

Most of your candle stick formations that you use seem to be continual trend patterns instead of reversal trend patterns? As i understand that candle sticks are most effective for reversal patterns?

Thanks for your inputs and the knowledge you have imparted. Anyway will it be possible to send me the 5 candlestick formations that you have compiled, and also the 1-2-3 Breakout. Sorry, wished i had joined the thread earlier.

I will be sending you an email shortly.

Thanks!

Btw i like it that you smile everytime even at your detractors.

--- 帖子 #1010 ---
Just a quick thought. TEB says the EUR/USD is in bull trend. At the moment there seems to be a sell setup shaping up on the 30 min chart.

Would this be a valid trade assuming the 5 min sets up as well?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1011 ---
I entered short at 2986 - a bit over zealous. Luckily only on my demo account. Doesn't seem to be working out too well at the moment.

Hi Jobey!

When you short Euro you go counter trend from 4h chart. You can do counter trend trade but it is a short live.

Most of the time the Bigs Dogs enter their trades in 4h chart. If we, the day to day traders, determine the trend from the 4h chart then we can assure riding the wave longer.

First I determine the trend in 4h chart (5/10 ema and filtered by RSI(9) & stoc(10,3,3). If 5/10 ema cross down, 4h chart, confirmed by rsi(9) is below 50 and stoc(10.3.3) cross down then I'm only looking short trade signal in 30 min chart with 5/10 ema cross down confirmed by RSI(20) below 50 and stoc(10.3.3) cross down too. Then wait for the tracement in 5 min chart to enter a trade with the minimum stop loss.

Hope it helps

Thanks

Hi Sriloba

Thanks for that. I was stopped out - thankfully demo - but as it turns out, had I put a wider SL on it would have finally come back into profit. (Story of my trading career).

But I am doing better following! this system.

--- 帖子 #1014 ---
Hi all!

I like to put the weekly pivot and determine the market flows (fractal) on 4h chart to look for the S/R.

And I put 200 ema in 4h-30min-5min charts for the over all trend.

When 5/10 ema ( or 5/12 ema) cross up/down above/below 200 ema in 4h-30min-5min charts combined with keys S/R ( pivot lines or fractal or candles patterns or fibonacci lines ) then we have the high probability of the long/short trade. I consider the 200 ema as the fair value. When price goes far away from the 200 ema then price tends to come back to bounce or to break.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1015 ---
Hi Sriloba

Sounds good sense. Although it does seem to be adding to TEB 63s system. I will be glad to hear TEB 63s view, and see what he does longer term.

Thanks, I will look at what you say.

Hi all!

I am a new member here on the forex factory forums. I have been reading so many excellent posts from a variety of authors and have found many useful ideas in my trading,specifically in the eu/usd which is my main interest. I trade only a few hours a day since I have a full time job starting 8:30 EST. I attempt my trading approximately from 5:30 am EST to 8:00 Monday through Friday from my home. I use the cornflower method for support and resistance levels as well as its alerts in looking at trends, especially on the hour 30 minute and 5 minute. I have found the TEB 5/12 21 RSI an excellent addition to my trading. My problem seems to be that of timing where much of the action appears during those early trading times of London which starts at 3:00 est. Does anyone have an idea from there experiences which of the 5/12 or 21 rsi indicators and time frame is best to have as an alert for my cell phone to awaken me  in the attempt to place a trade before leaving for work? I attemt to get from 3-5 pips per day as an addition to my salary working off of the five minute. The four hour and the hour are great time frames for alerts but the drawdowns are so great which is no fault of the timeframe since it needs time to work for a potential profitable trade. Any thoughts greatly appreciated.  Belmonte

It seems that Ej and Uj will give a signal soon, big bars thou.

Edit :Bleh just found out that cause I'm a junior it will take some time for this to print.

The bar that gave the signal opened a bit high for my liking, I'm staying out of this one

--- 帖子 #1019 ---
Short opened on USDCAD @ 1.0307 (I know it's above 1.03 and it's kinda bad but I gotta catch a glimplse of this system)

The M5 pullback was formed via MA crosses. From my understanding we don't need both RSI crossing up and down the 50 line and MA cross and recross, the MA cross is enough right?

Atm I'm on a 9 pip gain, sadly I'm using Forex.com as broker and that means 4 pip spread on usdcad.

Anyone else in?

Diez

EDIT : I'm glad I stood out the jpy crosses, Eurjpy would have hit my SL and UJ went up 10 pips only, excluding spread.

--- 帖子 #1020 ---
Took long on EURUSD @ 1.3007

Mas crossed for a long signal on M5 for USDCAD so I closed the trades for 10 pips loss.

EDIT : EU First target hit - 21 pips-3 spread =18 pips profit, 2nd trade still running

EDIT 2 : 2n trade hit sl ,

-2 pips atm for the day

Hi TEB63

Thanks for all you're doing. I'm slowly getting more confident in my trading thanks to your system.

I have a question regarding counter trend trades.

For example, today you have given the GBP/USD pair a very strong Bull trend. (I don't follow this pair as the spread is too great for me.)

If a short trade was indicated with your system, would you take it, or wait for the trend to correct?

Thanks for all your work.

--- 帖子 #1024 ---
Hi Jobey!

If the system indicates there is a trade then we should not hesitate to look for an entry. The problem is taking the prevail trend in lower time frame we may face a volatile market.

Pound is up on 4h chart based on the golden cross of 5/12 ema and rsi(20) above 50. (See picture)

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1025 ---
Teb -

I have a decent success rate with this strategy but don't know how to spot pullbacks.  If the 2 TFs are completely in agreement (i use the more conservative 45 & 55 RSI) do you just wait a little while, 5-10 minutes, to see if there is a pullback?  The pullback is the only real problem I've had with this strat.  Looking over past trades there are frequent pullbacks that would have given extra pips.  p.

Hi everyone,

This is my first post on this thread, I have finally finished going through the whole thread and think there is a great method here which really suits my trading style.

Thanks to Teb for all the effort he has put in and also thanks for adding me to your mailing list, just got my first e-mail today.

I have a chart below with a trade I took from this morning (still only paper trading at this point until I build up my knowledge of the method).

So on the cable this morning the 30min chart was trending quite well, RSI and EMAs all correct. I then followed the market on the 5min timeframe and found a few possible trigger points, I would like some advice on what would be the best ones to take if possible.

The 3 blue circled candles are all candle patterns, 1-engulfing, 2-hammer/pinbar, 3- piercing line/engulfing. Personally I thought the best entry was to wait for the break of the resistance level, and take the trigger at the black line as I have indicated on the chart. In this case the tp20 was hit, and the 2nd order stopped out at BE.

Do others agree and think its best to wait for the break, or should I have been more aggressive and entered on some of the candlestick patterns?

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1028 ---
Hi Caj1986

Im not sure about those candle patterns you metioned. If Im correct one on the rules for reversal patterns (like hammer, or engulfing pattern) is preceding trend. In your case short term trend is up so that hammer or engulfing pattern could be a false signal. But break of upper trendline is a good entry.

Regards

--- 帖子 #1029 ---
Hi teb63 and sorry for my bad English

This is my questions:

1)If cross at 30m tf… before ema and after rsi or… before rsi and after ema or… both together is        important or not?

2)at the 5m the rsi many times retracement in pull back?
And the first rsi retracement is always secure?..always happen?

3) I am doubtful the system is great in eur/usd ..a little less into gpb/usd…bat the other pair
Eur/Jpy  Usd/Jpy  Eur/Gbp Usd/Cad  Aud/Usd ..its very dangerous…too false signals, there is same that I don’t know?

4) I want  propose the exit, whit this levels:

In the chart 30m you can see that there are same good trade very strong (line green) and same trade that I think like false signal (line red ),,,good!

The good trade have one thing too similar..all trades cross the MA cyan and usually taKe the level resistence or support, and same time go again..now!

If is possible take away the bad trades (line red)…we have the exit for the trade!

I post you because bago system have less false signal at 60tf…but the exit is the same for the bago system…if sameone is interesting can post this into the trade of bago system!

I post here the pic,,,I hope don’t mistake the post  this is my firs post here!

Cheer!

--- 帖子 #1030 ---
i attach the other tf 30m..

ho yes.. really the line red and green at tf 5m you see are the same line at the 30m tf so that the position is more or less and no exatly the position whe the trand started.

cheer!

--- 帖子 #1031 ---
the resistence or support i mean is the envelopes indicator ( the line....    line-dot)...the 3th after the ema cyan!

Hi Teb 63

Thanks for your Trend 'heads up'. They are very useful. I seem to have the same problem with the email version that Slack has.

Absolutely no problem, I just look at the FF version and that's fine.

I do have one tiny question though, and that concerns trend direction.

If you recommend/indicate that a particular pair has a strong trend going one way, would you consider a counter trend trade if your system indicated one?

Thanks for your work.

Hi TEB 63

Yep. That's very clear. Don't have to count the arrows anymore!

I don't like arrows, especially when I'm wearing my cowboy hat!

hey everyone

I was looking for strategy for 8-10 pm EST and came across this thread.

I read about 50 pages this weekend. When I sat down this move had just occurred and I thought I would share it.

This is aud/usd.

Does anyone wait for this setup and then have a limit order waiting on the 5ema.  It would have been nice in this situation, but it can't always be this pretty.

oh and since I only read the first 50 pages, I don't think anyone ever helped TEB with posting Oanda charts. you don't need any special programs.

1) hit "print screen" (a key on the key board)

2) open microsoft paint

3) hit ctrl and V to paste

4) save as

Hi Vence

your 1st lot TP should be at least equal to SL

or I think you will lose over time.

the usd/chf will be hard to trade today interest rate stuff

good trading you like the system?

--- 帖子 #1070 ---
Hi TEB!

Yes I like your MTF strategies.

I set SL to -10pips. But when I trade 2 lots and SL gets hit I count it 2x10 = -20pips.

What are you trading (going to) today? Any advice? Thanks for your time and effort.

GBP/USD and EUR/GBP looks good now.

Teb - I'm ok with your trend reports but I think you have made it hard on yourself.  Me, I would do something like this (and forget the colors)

EUR/USD   Long   #3

At the start and at the end you could post the meanings of the numbers.  I guess that now that you have the colors, arrows, numbers etc already formatted it doesn't matter but it must have been a lot of work.  Do you have the a.m.s & p.m.s mixed up as to when the trend info will be posted?  p.

--- 帖子 #1076 ---
thanks

the # refers the trend strengh

ie 3 is strong, 4 is very strong, 0 is no trend.

as for am and pm ?

where are you?

I am ny.ny time

thanks for your thoughts

I am going to send out a report by email
each night between 6 and 8 am.
And post on FF between 6 and 8 pm.

Shouldn't it be that the night email is p.m. & the FF post will be a.m.?  Or are you giving yourself a 14 hour leeway?

Also, I know what the numbers mean and if that info is posted at the begiing and end of the trend info then that is all that needs to be posted. But you are the expert.

Hi TEB 63

I have just realised that I misread your first post.

Where you said 'in at 53' and first target 85, I assumed you meant it had reached your target.

It is now clear that you opened at 53 and then set a target at 85 that wasn't reached.

I was worried about my broker. I'm already convinced that he is looking over my shoulder when I place a trade, then does the complete opposite of what I want.

Thanks

TEB, thank you for the effort you have made in this thread. I started to descover a "MTF" as a solution for a while ago-it is really simple but effective ! But I use a slightly different MM - I usually set my TP two or three times more than my SL - it is more easy for me psychologically, because I know that even with 45-50% win rate I will still be able to make money. Let me kow what you think about it, because I think that you have more expirience with this kind of system than I do !

Hi one and all

This is my new outline and with 3 set up.
Just a thought the market is a little bit wild right now.
This is what the system looks like, but I will personally
be waiting until after the big boys in London,
tell me what is going on.
So I will be trading the NY open.

I will send out an email to my list Monday morning.
If you would like you to be added to the email
Just send an email to teb63@hotmail.ca

Hello Teb,

I have been following your thread for a while now and also got your ebook. However I'm still not sure what is teh difference between setup1 and setup2. For setup2 you have written in ebook that wait for cross after price hits price target. what is the price target or how do we determine it?

Thanks for helping us.

Hi Teb...

just wanted to ask u ... is ur 5ema & 12 ema still working??... and how profitable is it (I mean daily avg pips)?? ... I have read ur system rules and done some visual backtesting... it looks good ... but then real trading always has diff outcome... so was curious to know!!!!

thanks and regards.

--- 帖子 #1154 ---
TEB "classical" works great I have done many times live trades.

do 4(3) hours, 30 mins, 5 mins

(1 min if you know what you are doing)

go for the 21 pips 1st lot 2nd lot run.

I just like the new system better

I can see what is really going on

Rather then waiting for something to happen.

cheers

I trade using 7 and 14 emas (i was using these before i read this thread).. dont use rsi... trade from 3.00 to 13.30 est... and use only the 5 min chart.. but i avoid trading immediately after a big move (of around 100 pips)..cause i feel after a big move there can be consolidation... also i discontinue trading after i have made some good pips for the day.

but my problem is tht i make profits but they r not very significant.

ur strategy of booking one lot and letting another one run is wonderful. so will surely try ur system out... and the element of mtf may also be giving ur system an edge. i hope i can improve after seeing ur system and learning frm it... thnx a lot for sharing!!!

Thanx and Regards.

Hi Guys

the markets are all looking to make an other move at the asia open

I am going out with the guys

I had a great day up well over a 100s pips

with 6 safe trades on that will be at least an other 100 pips.

just wondering how everyone else is liking this?

is it helpful ? or do people like the classical teb better?

are the two metres working for people?

are the two set ups clear? .. I will redo my ebook when I can.

I am going fishing this weekend so it might not happen until next week

but I think they are easy to understand?

anyways any thoughts ?

(By the way i will be gone from friday until tuesday... no internet where I am going)

out for the night

cheers

Hi.TEB,

i m silently following your thread along with these new set ups rules.But sry to say u that i m not yet clearly understand the set ups.for example will u pl clearify why u enterd in the above trade at 82 as in my chart the 20 rsi in 5 min was still above 50 level though 5/12 cross over happened in 5 min & on the other hand the 5/12 in 30 min was still in up ward? thank u for your great works & sharing.

I was going through this thread yesterday. I could not resist, so get on my live account setting up my charts as per TEB..

I should say, I got almost 100pips so far only with EU pair. I did not go through the complete thread. but first few posts gave me information about the system and how it works.. There were so many add ups for TEB system, but I don see all that.. I set up only based on MA and RSI..

I am not sure about the entry as it was mentioned about breakout, candle formation 123 setup all that... I was waiting for the cross and RSI below or above 50.. Candle is below or above MA.. and then look for pull back to MA and then enter the trade.. I was trading only one trade per signal.. But was able to take good pips..

If some one can help me understand the entry rules of the trade would be greatly appreciated. May be which post or link that i should look at..

I am very grateful to TEB and THANKS will not be enough to say.. MORE THAN THANKS... MAY GOD BLESS you all..

--- 帖子 #1181 ---
I have been asked by people if I can do a daily call.

so I have added a new set up it may come either with  Strong Trend or just Trend.
its a daily call so you will need
bigger stops and so bigger take proffits,

I would say do at least 2 to 1 if not 3 to 1 ( TP to SL)

ie.
Eur/Gbp . Strong Trend : Set Up3 Break of 0.8137(new)

1. Red is sell , Green is a buy
2. 0.8137 is the trigger

Hey Teb,
Days like this makes one feel like they can actually trade for a living, eh!
Really appreciate the update changes that you continue to make to this 30m-5m "money machine".
The Power Trend trade reports each morning are just great for zeroing in on the active crosses.
Enjoy the weekend fishing trip.
See you next week in the trenches.

TEBSmartMetre:Lead Indicators Trade.

I have been playing with a new set up. Its based on the TEBSmartMetre:
Its very easy, I will post here if people are interested. its seems to be working very well for me.
its based on lead indicators from the day and week. it is not based on the charts to find the trend
as my other sets up are. I trade it on the 4 hour harts mostly –on the day chart sometimes

Steps
1.Fnd the pair you want to trade. the higher the number the better the pair.
I will send out the numbers with the main call (see below to under stand the numbers)
2. Wait for the cross on the Cci 8
3. Enter in on a 1. 2. 3. Break or IB or OS or a 3 candle reversal, etc
All after the cross out of the 100 or -100 zone back towards the 0
(More aggressive is to drop down to the 1 hour or 15 for the entry)

Exit/Take Profit
1. When “numbers” drop down against you. Exit right away
2. The stoch/Cci crosses against you (I exit 1/2 my position)
3. Takes out a swing. Exit right away!!!

Stop loss
Last swing Or the other side of what ever got you into the trade.

TEBSmartMetre: Sunday Sept 5
Lead Indicators: Weekly & Daily to see there the big dogs are going..

Eur 3
Chf 5
Gbp 3
Usd 1
Jpy 4

Cad 4
Aud1
Nzd 1

Highest Green added to highest Red = Best possible return
Ie. Chf 5+EUR 3= 8
....... So the best trades are , Eur/Chf, Gpb/Chf

Let’s look at the charts

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

1. Red break line.. Based all are IB and all are bear
2. Entries 2 pips 0n the other side of the candle formation,
3. Stop loss is the last swing highs or
the other side of what ever got you into the trade.

I will post my entries again its a new system I am using.
That is it... This is for inter-day, swing and long term trading, The good thing is we can see the trades a long time before ... set and forget.

I am gone for the day.

we have a great air show here in Toronto (a bit over cast)

I moved all trades to BE+1

I will let them run .. I do not want any surprise.

But I really do not think anything will happen today.
no news + no markets = no moves ... so no pips ... no money...right

I will see you tonight

Hi Teb,
What is the CCI to be set at? Close, open, or ???
Thanks much.
Cliff

Steps
1.Fnd the pair you want to trade. the higher the number the better the pair.
I will send out the numbers with the main call (see below to under stand the numbers)
2. Wait for the cross on the Cci 8
3. Enter in on a 1. 2. 3. Break or IB or OS or a 3 candle reversal, etc
All after the cross out of the 100 or -100 zone back towards the 0
(More aggressive is to drop down to the 1 hour or 15 for the entry)

teb63@live.com[/quote]

UPDATE: On the CLOSE, thanks Teb.

--- 帖子 #1230 ---
Teb,
When you say for more aggressive entry drop down to 1h or 15m, do you mean to say that the entry is independent of the the higher time frame set up.

Steps
1.Fnd the pair you want to trade. the higher the number the better the pair.
I will send out the numbers with the main call (see below to understand the numbers)
2. Wait for the cross on the Cci 8
3. Enter in on a 1. 2. 3. Break or IB or OB or a 3 candle reversal, etc
All after the cross out of the 100 or -100 zone back towards the 0
(More aggressive is to drop down to the 1 hour or 15 for the entry)

In other words, is our entry dependent on the setup occuring first on the higher TF or are you saying we can use this as a stand alone approach on the shorter TF for a more aggressive trade setup?
I've included some charts to help high lite the questions. Once the CCI shows an entry on a Daily/Weekly TF it has already moved lower or higher on the 4h, 1h, 15m TF's.
Are the Entries I've noted correct per your rules?
Also, do you take CCI divergence into consideration?
Thanks,
Cliff

--- 帖子 #1231 ---
no ,,,rather then waiting for a candle formation or a 1 2 3 break (etc)

on the 4 hour chart after the CCI gives you a entry sign.

get a entry sign on the hour or 15 but again only after the CCI says go

I came accross this thread a couple of days ago and started reading, but ive just noticed that your not using the ema cross any more, can you please tell me why this is, thanks in advance

Highest Green added to highest Red = Best possible return
Ie. Chf 5+EUR 3= 8
....... So the best trades are , Eur/Chf, Gpb/Chf

Steps
1.Fnd the pair you want to trade. the higher the number the better the pair.
I will send out the numbers with the main call (see above to understand the numbers)
2. Wait for the cross on the Cci 8
3. Enter in on a 1. 2. 3. Break or IB or OB or a 3 candle reversal, etc
All after the cross out of the 100 or -100 zone back towards the 0
(More aggressive is to drop down to the 1 hour or 15 for the entry)

Exit/Take Profit
1. When “numbers” drop down against you. Exit right away
2. The stoch/Cci crosses against you (I exit 1/2 my position)
3. Takes out a swing. Exit right away!!!

Stop Loss
Last swing Or the other side of what ever got you into the trad
Let’s look at the charts

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

1. Red break line.. Based all are IB and all are bear
2. Entries 2 pips 0n the other side of the candle formation,
3. Stop loss is the last swing highs or
the other side of what ever got you into the trade.

I will post my entries again its a new system I am using.
That is it... This is for inter-day, swing and long term trading,
The good thing is we can see the trades a long time before ... set and forget.

Hi Teb,

How do you calculate your smart metre? I was comparing your smart metre with the "news profiteer currency strength meter", yesterday it was in agreement, today not as much.

I took the GBP/JPY 4H trade yesterday and took 101 pips in 1 lot. The meters were in agreement.

The "news profiteer meter" on a scale of 0 - 10:

USD 5.1

EUR 0

GBP 2.3

CHF 6

CAD 9

AUD 2.3

JPY 9

NZD 0

--- 帖子 #1267 ---
The "news profiteer metre" is a very short term based metre

based on RSIs which are based on charts .

My numbers are not based charts at all

cheers

You are not responsible for other people's profits.  I really enjoy your information and use it often.  If I lose, it's my fault not yours.  It sounds like most of the people who are complaining need to go back to www.babypips.com for a refresher course.  Try not to let it get to you because the majority here really appreciate what you do!

Have a great weekend!!!

Your quote to Strat, on Sep 1, 2010 10:10pm, post #13760
"i have read some of your post"

Strat's reply to you,
"But obviously not enough! Stop posting until you have read it all!"

I high-lite this exchange between you and another very experienced trader to help you focus. It is not my intention to insult.
You badger Teb in one sentence and beg for his help in another. It seems clear to me that you are both new to life and new to trading forex.
You would do well to consider the old saying,
"Less talking, more listening."
Teb, gave you a heads up on a potential entry point. If the forex market got there. The forex market did not, and as such, Teb then was gracious enough to provide to you another potential entry point. If the forex market got there.
You should be picking up on a theme here.
Teb, does not control the market.
Although, arguable, it can be safely said that no one person can control the out come of the forex market.
Widegap, made some observations that I would also echo.
I would add that after the forex market closed, for me on FXDD it it was 1.2709, it continued to fall on other brokers platforms to 1.2680 or less. Potentially nice gap trade setting up there on Sunday night market open. But no guaranty.
I've included a screen shot to help you see why Teb might have been favoring a short at some point on Friday. If the market got there during normal trading hours and if it continued in that direction. Pretty big ifs, if you ask me. That's why we use a sensible Stop Loss.

Teb, like many others here on FF, I look forward to learning from your experience.
Enjoy the weekend.
!Ciao!
Cliff

yes,all of  you are right.i am just a college student,in a not rich family.i am absolutely a new one to trade,i just trade less than half year.of course ,i use a very very very little account. i am a newbie of the work,SO i just want to learn faster learn more and more.i want to know more,so i read many threats in FF.i PM teb,and i post in strat's threat,just want to learn more. i feel so lonely ,i can not see the market.and i even do not know how to improve my level.

[quote=geniusztc;4015387]yes,all of you are right.i am just a college student,in a not rich family.i am absolutely a new one to trade,i just trade less than half year.of course ,

It appears that you are looking at FF for an education on trading.  You need to start with a structured education program and then you can and gain some confidence and understanding before you trade.  I would suggest going to www.babypips.com and go through the entire education process before you trade.  We all go through the excitment of getting started into trading but after a short time you will just get frustrated if you don't master the basics first.

Just a suggestion as I am no expert and I have been where you are now.  It takes time and a lot of studying.

1. My numbers are day based from tebsmartmetre

2. These charts are from 6pm EST

The numbers are just adding together

green + red = purple
3 + 5 = 8

green (hi) - green (low) = purple
5 - 2 = 3

red (hi) - red (low) = purple
7 - 4 = 3

Look for the CCI 8 to turn in the direction of the trend

3 entry calls tonight I took the two forex ones

Hi Teb,

If you are trading on a 1h/4hr charts or 4hr/1dy charts do you still set your first TP at 10 pips?

Regards

Steve

--- 帖子 #1308 ---
Goodness no ... I use the last swing (hi or low)

or sometimes I do 50 SL and 100 tp

Hello Teb, first of all thank you for your help and great sistems. I have 2 questions.  1.When you trade with your sistem 5/30 minut do you trade in the direction of 4 hour chart? I mean when 30 and 5 minuts movings and rci crossed down,but movings and rci on 4 H. chart are crossed UP do you take a trade or wait until the sell signal will apear on all 3 timeframes: 4H,30min. 5min?      2. What do mean your numbers in smart meter, where you write,for example, today  euro/usd 1.3015?  ENTRY point?  Thank you, have a great day,

--- 帖子 #1313 ---

Hello guys,

As we can see in chart, EURAUD Daily trend is down,

but, if anyone can tell how to avoid these kind of enters in 4H chart (vertical red line), when both CCI (8 and 14) cross 100 down and OSMA is losing value

See chart, thanks,

everyone asks what is my % of wins / loses

of the last 20 trades opened and closed I have had 2 loser .

that is better then normal a little - but when you know the trend

.. in a trending market its earier to win

and the 30/5 trade (my system) in a the trending market is nice

the hour and day trades I am calling are also always with the trend and so normally win.

this system works I showed that today. I do not normally show all my trades . I still have 7 trades still on all + from 12 pips to 98 pips

( I closed some trades at 5pm)

Hi TEB, you are bullish on the EURO, based on charts?  Do the fundamental support it? I know most traders are shorting the USD. but can any thing help the USD to rally? I am thinking about shorting the EURO, but ur system is great.

--- 帖子 #1366 ---
Well I would be careful personally shorting but who knows

I like the pound even more then the euro!

I do think the Usd/chf have a a little correction though

Why are you looking at shorting?

cheers

teb

--- 帖子 #1367 ---
I know most traders are shorting the USD

i am sorry, but do you really know ? i suspect. however, i know that most traders are losers here.   and i think if you know most of the capital is short or long ,then you will get money from the ATM.

--- 帖子 #1368 ---
I like the pound even more then the euro!

hello,teb,when you said you like the pound even more than the euro,did you mean the pound has a stronger long trend than euro? but if you did , you also have an outlook on EURGBP (a long trend).is it contradictory ? however , in my chart ,the EURGBP is also a long trend .

thank you

--- 帖子 #1369 ---
I think the pound has more to run in the short to mid term

.. long term it looks like the eur will be stronger

TEB Can i ask you how you calculate those lines?? Vertical and horizontals?

--- 帖子 #1379 ---
I think the horizontal lines are related to his recent article on the 7th candle formation called "steps".  In a trend, he is looking for a break of an opposite colored candle.

I sent this out a few weeks ago

7th Candle Formation Steps: It’s a variation of the 1 2 3 Break.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

1. RSI 20
i. Blue Box on the RSI 20 : Gives permission to start to look to trade.
ii Blue Box on the RSI 20 : Big reversal: If you are not out get out.
2. Steps
i. See the Blue Steps
a. Step #1 the beginning step (Bullnose)
b. Steps #2 & #3 are Entries
c. Step # 4 the ending (floor or ceiling) a Pattern Failed: price bounds off step
ii. See the Pink Steps
a. Steps #1 is Reversal
Entry: With at least lots
i. Direction of the RSI 20
ii: Break of a wrong coloured candle back to the trend.
Exit:
i. 1.2.3. Break reversal
ii. A change on the RSI
Stop Loss: Above the Step before. ie Step 1 would be the SL for Step 2
Target: 1st lot equal to Stop Loss2nd lot target let it swing out

Best treading idea: London To Ny to Asia open on 5 min charts

The remainder is the same as the basic 1.2.3 break please see that teaching

I will be sending out The next candle formation tonight or tomorrow

Hay Guys

You need to understand

4X real and 4X game

The real 4X is month week and Day

(4 hour and 3 hour could be seen as the between ground)

4X game is below that

I play on the 3 hour 30 min and 5 min

sometimes the 1 min

But the 4X real and 4X game have very differant rules

TEB is my new hero. His systems just work. No magic, no extreme risk, not too much risk. Just simple tools that even the newb can learn fairly quickly.

I am particularly excited today as I have discovered how to add Teb's 1 minute killer with this EMA/RSI to make quick profits even when the markets enter a small range. I also noticed that if I miss a trade that starts to run, I can switch to the 1 min and find a nice entry.

Note: on the 1 min I added HA candles to identify the micro-trend.

Remember the trend is your friend and if you can't find the trend, then make TEB your friend!

Hi fellows traders,

I agree with taking the trend on the 4h chart. Because the trend is stronger and also most of the hedges funds enter their trades on 4h chart. If the bigs dogs go long on 4h chart and our system indicates 5/12 ema cross up and confirmed by rsi(20) is above 50 then we are only looking to buy the pair of currency on the lower times frames (15min or 5 min chart).

Honestly, I enjoy using the TEB 5ema & 12ema and 20 RSI (MTF) in my day trading with small modification just to fit my personnality. It is very simple system that gives us everyday at least 25 pips (loonie,yen,aussie,kiwi).

Thank you, Teb

I live in montreal and full time trader.

Hi one and all

I am moving into the 21C

dear teb,

can you please explain a little about the pullback.

u said you trade off the 12ema.  i have been only take the cross.

but you mentioned it is better than the cross.

i know it's probably something simple, but if you dont mind, just explain it in a few words. no chart needed.

thanks for the time

--- 帖子 #1481 ---
it's an excellent system. the key is the mtf.  that is really, very, very, very important which needs to be stressed.  that is the make or break of this form of trading psychology.

the reason i am looking into your system is cuz i did a search on ema crosses.

it is very, very, very tough to do 1h using 4h to confirm or even 15m using 1h to confirm a lot of the time.  it's tough because there aren't enough trades and your nerves are tested big time when you don't know when to get out, OR even if you are waiting for the ema to RE-cross.

that's why i'm looking into your system. i am willing to sacrifice and get less pips and have more losses, but to have a happier trading life.

--- 帖子 #1482 ---

--- 帖子 #1486 ---
what is the mtf ? is it an indicator ? what are the settings ?

--- 帖子 #1487 ---
Teb, parles tu français?? Peut-être que vous devriez avoir un blog français

--- 帖子 #1488 ---
MTF is Multi Time Frame. If you are using Teb's 30 min 5 min system, you would look for the trend to start on the 30 minute chart, with the moving averages crossed and the rsi below the 50 line. this would indicate a trend is beginning on that time frame, then you would look for the same set up to occur on the the 5 min chart. entries are taken off the 5 min.. you should read the thread from the first page. It's all there in black and white.

Great week using your methods teb!

160 pips on eur/usd for the week

123 pips on the aud/usd

You want the two currencies to be one of the highest numbers a part.
a. On this set you want the two at least 5 apart.
b. It is best if one of the currencies is red and one is green .
c. The Number a part changes with the market Volatility

I have the Usd and the Eur marked in yellows
a. they are more then 5 apart
b. one is Green and one is Red.

2nd. Now move to the 30 min chart and make sure it’s in line with the bigger trend.
(we can pull trades off this chart too .. you can see one trade on the charts)

3rd. Then we look for trades signals on the on the 5 min chart .

4th. Eastest exits are
a. A cross back on the 30 min chart .... let it run/
b. or keep moving the SL until it takes you out ,

5th. Stop losses are the last swings ... again keep moving it up/down.

Its that simple ..

teb

--- 帖子 #1491 ---
Sorry to ask you that but when you say that the two numbers must be more than five apart, does it mean that they must have a difference of 5?

Like A green 1 and a green 6 or (I suppose red is negative numbers for you)

a red 1 (-1) and a green 4?

Just not to be confuse...

And when on the 5mn chart is the crossing more important than the RSI?

--- 帖子 #1492 ---
yes its the differance

ie

3 and a 2 =5

or

3 and a 8 =5

but all things being equal the 1st pair is better

again 5 is the smallest differance ... look for the bigger ones.

teb

--- 帖子 #1493 ---
Ok again a lot of emails  3 ways to play this system

1st. 10 or 20 pips (same SL)

every time it crosses the 5 min chart in line with the 30 min And TEBstrenghtmetre (only in busy hours) and if you take 2 losses in a row take some time off you are in chop.

2nd. Entry every signal on the 5 min as entries into the 30 min and let it run until a 30 min exit.

3rd. Do both. 2 lots. but on the 30 min lot use the last swing as the stop not a pip SL and on the other do a pip stop

can also enter on the 30 chart when it turns to the main trend very strong

on how you like system and if it is working for you

I want to get some feed back

I think its very very simple

... its working for me how is it working for you

If its not helpful that is fine but its a lot of work on my side

I make 100s of pips a week, but I know the system

I want to see if others can follow it

cheers

--- 帖子 #1500 ---
I keep on eye on them for sure.

But I find they are not as helpful as in stocks

i think this is because of the com. traders

Its a clean entry. The only thing I do not like is both currancies are about the same strenght on the
TEBmetre. So it might not be a big run.

Teb, thanks for this system and thread, I've read through about 70 pages so far...

Nice trade this morning on EUR/USD with the original 5/12/RSI20 system. I entered at break of 1.4150 at 1.4152 took profit on 50% at 1.4162 (+ 10 pips) took another 25% before the round number at 1.4195 (+43 pips) last 25% out with stop loss at 1.4237 (+85 pips).

Some things I would like to clear on this trade:

1. I didn't enter on the EMA cross, I wanted to see the range from the previous 5 hours broken first and set a limit order at 1.4152 Is this ok?

2. There were some news events that triggered the move, should we only stay away from trading when there is major news events?

The trade worked out well but any critique on my thinking process will be appreciated.

how does your power trend work.  on what basis do you give those numbers per currency?

--- 帖子 #1516 ---
man this system is so amazing at the london open!!

I trade this mostly on the 4 hour as I am a sleep at 3pm

sometimes I get a 5/30 cross at the NY open but not always

but you guys as the london open are very blessed !!!

cheers

On the Weekend I look at Gold. silver. Oil. NGas. & DowJ.

do people like these? what else are people trading?

I now trade 4X almost only//

had 3 people say they could not open my emails attactment

is this wide spread?  I use Micr office 2007

I may try to get my blog going.. I am just very busy!

hello ,i am just  confused with that should i trade only one pairs ,focused one pairs ,or should i trade a lot of pairs???

i can open your attachments ,and i think most ones can open it.

expect your blog .

it  go short .

--- 帖子 #1523 ---
no the green on the Number is long
red on the number is short

teb

--- 帖子 #1524 ---
that is a great question

when I started I centred the pound (not a great Idea lol)

Becauase I was told to centre on one

if you are to centre on one pair make it the eur/usd

if I was going to add an other one I would add aud/usd.

but if you can learn a sytem you will have more chance to trade

Then you will have very few chop days.

i find most of my loses over the yrs were because I felt I had to trade

and could not find one ...so I make one ... I made someone else money lol

I am not sure either is right or wrong its personal choice.

teb

--- 帖子 #1525 ---
Hi Guys

Tomorrow is Non-Farm Payrolls!!!

I Think ( heard lol ) it just might be more crazy then normal (what ever normal is for NFP) because of the USA election past. We might have some surprises.

so I will begin to close down a lot of my trades as the day goes on

We also might have some big moves esp, after London closes

and when Aud open and then when Asia opens . London will likely tread water until the release ... but who knows

just becareful trading today

teb

--- 帖子 #1526 ---
Just finished reading the entire thread, can't wait to put it all to practice.

Teb, with regards to money management, you are entering several trades on different pairs, how do I manage correlation risk?

--- 帖子 #1527 ---
Inserted Code i find most of my loses over the yrs were because I felt I had to trade
and could not find one ...so I make one ...

can not agree with you any more . thank you with your advice .

--- 帖子 #1528 ---
Hi Teb,

It appears that the Power Trend Trader is a big part of how you successfully trade. I know you share your directions but wouldn't it be more useful to teach people how you come up with those numbers/trends? I always feel like it doesn't make sense to follow a thread where the system isn't fully disclosed/taught. Let's face it, you could stop posting tomorrow or start charging an outrageous amount for your signals and every one here would be left holding the empty bag. People spending alot of time learning most of your system only to find they can't trade it because a big part of the system has gone missing.

I don't mean any disrespect, I think the thread is very good I just think it would be a much more powerful system if you taught the trend direction part.

--- 帖子 #1529 ---
I see no Disrespect and so none taken but its not that easy..

Its very complext it takes me 3 hours on the weekend to set it up

and about 75 mins a day .... 60 in the morning and 15 in the evenning

I am not a computer guy so I do it all by hand so to speak.

I hope you understand not sure what else to say.

cheers

teb

--- 帖子 #1530 ---
I don't follow anything I don't understand so I double check teb's power trend with a daily chart and a trend line. Most of the time it's pretty obvious what the trends are and then you can kinda see how teb is coming to the conclusion that a pair is power trending.

Take a look at the following chart and you can see what I mean.

--- 帖子 #1531 ---
Teb is telling us that the strongest pairs are NZD, AUD, EUR, GBP - just pull up a daily chart of any of those currencies vs the USD. It is pretty clear to me that they are trending fairly well and have been since August. Why fight it?

--- 帖子 #1532 ---
hey now you are thinking like a trader!!!

that is a great start

I in fact do use TL but I use them for comformation

not as part of my main system

But they are a great thing to build a system on

esp short term trading

long term the SLs are just too far a part on the angle ....right

TL are looking where the market is and trending great start!!

now add a way to find strength

and a way to compare to others

and then to tell when the turns in the market is coming

and then over buy/sold (Big D)

and add a way to see what the dumb and smart money is doing

and you will have a great system!!!!!

cheers

TEB

--- 帖子 #1533 ---
Hi Teb,

Thanks for the explanation. I didn't realize that it was that complicated. It would appear that the average trader may have some difficulties understanding your formula and applying it to the market.

I will follow along because this thread certainly has alot of good information that can help any trader.

--- 帖子 #1534 ---
Thanks Teb; took 25 pips off your Eur/Aud 4h call; may get back in on a 5/30 signal.  Nice to add a little extra to the bottom line.

4 hour trade

Red : Down trend
Green : Uptrend
Black : Neutral
==== : no signal
Purple: Enter or Exit
Colour on pair means trend in place
Black on pair means no trend in place

1st Key to entry
TEBPOWERTRENDTRADER:Trade a high Green & a high Red
Usd 5
Eur6
Only trade with strength: You may get a small follow through without
but without strength you will not get a big move.

2nd Key to entry
EurUsd//==== Uptrend but we have missed it.
(This is good for 30/5 min trade set up)
GbpUsed/ (in .9525)uptrend at number in bracket but we have missed it,
(this is good for 30/5 min trade set)
UsdChf/ Enter.9525 ... Enter 1 pip and spread beyond number or other
EurAud/ Exit. 7555 ... Exits 1 pip and spread beyond number.
NGas / ==== no signal

Enter Other
1. Basic: At The number 1 pip and spread beyond number. The SL is last swing. Big Stop Losses.
2. Safest:Enter at the next Candle formation on the 4 hour chart.
The SL is last swing or the better the other end of candle formation.
3. Aggressive: Enter at the next Candle formation on the 30 min chart.
The SL is last swing or the better the other end of candle formation.

Take Profit: Some of the ways I have used
1. When I give you a number to Exit
2. A swing in the opposite direction
3. 5/12 EMA swing against you (on the 30 min or 3 hour)
4. S/R or TL or “00” or “50”
5. 21 pips 50 pips 100 pips or ATR

Well Guys

It looks like the market might be turning

We have no real trend so this system will not work well

so I will be using my "chop" rules

last week I had well over an 1000 pips with this system

To another matter

.

I had 861 Emails last week

I lot back to just over 450

a lot of the emails were for simple 4X stuff

alot of the other emails were fore bacis TEB stuff

It was way to much time need to do something about it.

1st please learn the basic 4X stuff

please read the threat esp. the postings I have stated

in the postings I give on trade calls

Hi TEB,

following the thread with interest many thanks for all your input.

Past two days on Eur/Usd it's been hard to find a trend on 30m and matching setup on 5m - for me anyway. How many days per month would you say this sys doesn't trade well and what are the signs you look for to keep you out of the market during non-tradeable days?

Cheers.

well if you are just trading one pair likely 1/3 of the days.

if you are london open

1st Candle Formations .. 3 Candle Reversal /With Pin Candle

One of my favourite candle formations is the 3 candle reversal  .. variation with a big pin candle (nose or tail)The “Pin” is the big shaddow on the 2nd candle in the formation. I call them “nose or tail”.  . (ie. The chart I am using is an up trend: Reverse everything in a down trend)

Here is a trade I took. when I see one as clear as this one I will take it and say thanks!

Set Up
1. We want to see this Candle formation at the end of a strong trend. The longer the better .
I like at lest 10 candles in the trend . An up trend is higher highs and higher lows.
2. We want to see a big Pin Candle (2nd candle) . the Pin part of the candle . the bigger the better .
Of coarse the tail/nose going opposite to the old trend.
3. Best if the Pin Candle’s colour is opposite to the old trend’s colour.
4. Get in 1 pip (plus spread) below candle 3 in the pattern. white line.
5. Often it will be the 4 candle you enter on, but not always.
6.1st target  (blue line) the number of pips from the top of Pin Candle (2nd candle)(pink line)                                    to bottom of 3rd  Candle (white line) : pink line to white line. = white line to blue line.
7. Stop loss a few pips into the nose/tail

Strongest trading use:
1st  Reversal on the 5 min chart to the main trend on  the 30 min chart/ trend.
2nd  Reversal on the 1 min chart to the main trend on the 5/30 min chart/ trend.

Hi Guys

there is the 2nd candle formation
I will send out some new stuff on the weekend

if you do not get it email me at [size=3][color=black]teb63@live.com[/size][/color]

teb

2nd Candle formation: Outside Candle (Engulfing Candle)

This pattern consists of two candles.
1st. Standard candles. 2nd. Engulfing candle.
The 1st candle is a narrow range candle that closes down.
The sellers are still in control of the pair but because it is a narrow range candle,
and volatility is low, the sellers are not very aggressive.
The 2nd Candle is a wider range candlestick that “engulfs” the body of the first candle,
and closes near the top of the range. The buyers have overwhelmed the sellers
(demand is greater than supply). Buyers have "taken over". The bulls are in control

When to take this trade (i.e. in an uptrend, in a down trend reverse everything here)
1. Take the trade as soon as the engulfing candle closes.
2. One pip over the top of the engulfing candle (Pink line)
3. Only trade if you are with the trend, on the chart. Look for the 20 RSI, to me over 50.
4. Here is the secret, go one time trade frame up & see what the trend is on that time frame.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Stop Loss: The bottom of the Engulfing candle. Is the Green line

Target

1st. Target (1st lot) Blue line.

you wing this target by measuring this target ... Line B (white) = Line A (red)

When you hit 1st. target move your stop loss up on the 2nd lot to break even +1 and spread

and let it run.
Best treading idea

reversal on the 5 min chart back to the main trend on the 30 min trend.

--- 帖子 #1583 ---
What do you mean by "1 lot 100% of the SL to the entry? Does that mean when the first lot hits the profit target you move the stop of the second lot to breakeven? And I assume the third lot keeps the original stoploss, right?

3rd. candle formation Inside Candle ( Harami)
This pattern consists of two candles. 1st. Candle (Mother Candles. Grey).
2nd..Candle (Inside Candle White)
The 1st. Candle (Mother Candle) is a range candle.
The Buyers are still in control of the pair because of the push up.
and volatility is high, the buyers are very aggressive.
The 2nd. Candle is a narrow range candlestick that “inside” the body of the mother candle,
and the middle of the range. The buyers and sellers wanting to see who is in charge.
(Demand is equal to supply). No one is in control.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

When to take this trade:
(i.e. in an uptrend, in a down trend reverse everything here)
1. Take the trade one pip over 1st. mother candle (1st. candle. Grey)
2. Only trade in the direction of the trend on chart. Here we are using 20 RSI, over 50.
3. Here is the secret,
go one time trade frame up & see what the trend is on those time frames.
Check it on the RSI 20 only trade if both time frames are inline. ie. 5 min go to the 15 min chart.

Stop Loss:
Safe stop.1 pip below the bottom of the 1st. Candle (mother candle, grey). the brown line...
or Aggressive stop, 1 pip below the bottom of the 2nd. Candle (inside candle, white). The purple line.

Target:
1st. Target (1st lot) green line.
you fine this target by measuring this target ... Line A (yellow) = Line B (red)
100% of the mother candle.
when you hit 1st. target move your stop loss up on the 2nd lot to break even +1 and spread
and let it run.

Best treading idea:
continue trend on the 5 min chart as on the on the 30 min trend.

Hi TEB, so I just joined this forum and since I cannot PM you as a junior member...

I wanted to you which system you are currently trading.. I like this system is awesome and also this one... http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=21982

currently loving the MTF concept ... what is your opinion on my theory about MTF..

in my mind I see MTF with setups like 1day 4 hour and 30 min the equivalent of finding long trend, intermediate, and short term trend.. but the MTF lets you see it so much clearly and those single TF guys are at such a dis advantange by ignoring 2 of the 3 main trends.. (like to know why you feel MTF works as good as it does)

anyways I could ramble on but main question is what system is your bread and butter currently and has held up over the years of trading..

Thank you so much!

PS: if you start a group of traders again to test a system I would love to help out, I admire your work.. screw those bastards who try to hide there "secret system" love how everyone here is working together to find a good method of trading.

Well I am using the TEB Classic

i just sent out an email

Hi Teb,

Why did you choose to trade NZDUSD. On your power trend chart both are green. I thought you were to match one red with one green that gave you the biggest number difference, for example  USD 5 Green with EUR 5 red which is a 10 point difference. You would sell EURUSD.

Am I missing something?

--- 帖子 #1600 ---
Ok, so like this system but a big thread so please. Anyone who has been trading this system please review my interpretation.

So we have the basic set up and ready to trade. (example as short trade)

On 30 min... Looking for 5 ema below 12 and RSI below 50.. doesnt really matter when that happens but just in that current state?

now on the 5 minute we should only place a trade once the indicators are just starting to go: ema 5 below 12, and RSI below 50.. (so they must just be making this transition to consider going in)

and finally use the 1 minute chart to find entry such as a recent low being broken.

----

a little confused about the exact entry.. like a recent low being broken or a candle pattern of price failing?

stop loss 10 pips (2 lots, one trails)

Thanks for the assistance,

PS: just want to confirm.. if all indicators were down on the 30 min and 5 min we can't technically enter right? since we need 5 min indicators to pull back to give pip profit room.

Thanks again!

1. 2. 3. (4) break pattern (i.e. is a down trend; reverse for uptrend)
a. Want it to be supported by RSI 20. under 50
b. Want the 1. 2. 3. to be wide!!
c. Safer reversal on the 30 min; more aggressive on the 5 min chart
i. A typical 1-2-3-break chart pattern is best traded after a strong currency pair up
…I like at least 8 candles.
Point (1): The high in an up trending currency market.
Point (2): A downward correction in the uptrend, the lowest candle in the correction                                              before the price moves back up to point (3).
Point (3): High in the move up from Point (2) but a failure to make a new higher high (Point 1)
.A lower high is what we're looking for to signal the potential downside move
Point (4) break: Go short 1 pip below point (2)

Enter:  2 lots

Stop lose
Conservatives: One pip plus spread over point 1.
Aggressive one pip plus spread over point 3

Target
100% of Point 1 to Point 2 this is line A.    A=B
When 1st target is hit move second lot to BE +1

Best  trading Idea
5 min reversal back to the 30 min trend but a failure to make a new higher high (Point 1).
A lower high is what we're looking for to signal the potential downside move

Hi Teb,

Thanks for the chart and explanation on the 123 type trades. I think that chart will help alot. The thing that myself and may others are struggling with is your post like this one in 1614. I can't make any sense of it and I certainly am unable to use it to my advantage to place a trade with this information.  Any additional explanation you can provide would be appreciated.

--- 帖子 #1612 ---
Hi Teb, nice refresher on 123 breakouts thanks. I'm also having trouble following your tips! I guess it makes perfect sense to you but to me it reads like the Shipping Forcast!!! You will only get that if you listen to BBC Radio4.

Anyway as a starter what exactly does this mean?

5th.Candle formation:Railway Tracks out of positions

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

When to take this trade: (i.e. in a down trend, in a uptrend reverse everything here)
1. Look for big candles, out of the trend and out of position.

2. Take the trade one pip under the lower of the 2 candles. Here it is the 2nd. candle (red).

3. Only trade in the direction of the trend on chart. Here we are using 20 RSI, under 50.

4. Here is the secret, go one time trade frame up and see what the trend is on that time frame.

Check it on the RSI 20 only trade if both time frames are inline.
ie. 5 min go to the 15 min chart.

Enter: Two lots.

Stop Loss:
1 pip + spread over the top of the higher of the 2 candles here it is 1st. Candle (green).

Target:

1. 1st. Target (1st. lot) purple line.

2. You fine this target by measuring... Line A (light purple = Line B line green)
3. When you hit 1st. target move your stop loss down on the 2nd. Lot to break even +1+ spread and let it run. Let it swing out!

Best treading idea:

Look for this candle formation in news times or the opening and closing of markets.

Note: This candle formation on a higher time frame will be a big pin (nose or tail) formation.

6th Candle formation: Gap 1
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

When to take this trade: (i.e. in an uptrend, in a down trend reverse everything here)
1. Look for the gap.

2. Look for price to try and close the gap. This becomes the base
3. Look for price to take out the high after the gap the break. Blue Line
4. Only take the trade in the direction of the trend on chart. Here we are using 20 RSI, over 50.

5. The yellow gap box and the red and white line are all equal; often are.
6. Here is the secret, go up to a few time frame up & see what the trend is on that time frame.

Check it on the RSI 20 only trade if both time frames are inline.
ie. 5 min go to the 30 min chart.

Enter: With two lots.

Stop Loss:1 pip + spread below base.

Target:
1.  First Target (1st. lot) is purple line, which is the red line = white line = to gap
2. You find this target by measuring pips base to break.
3. When you hit 1st. target move your stop loss up on the 2nd. Lot to break even +1+ spread and let it run. Let it swing out!

Best treading idea: Sunday night or after a holiday

I used the 30/5 system earlier this year.  But for some reason i had to waste this past year trying every strategy and indicator on this site.   I have finally decided that i need to keep it simple. But I have lost the touch exactly for this system.  Just to double check, is this what we are looking for????  as per the rules i would have entered on the retracement back down on the 5 min chart??

As im typing this there might be another sell swing happening.

http://i168.photobucket.com/albums/u.../tebeurjpy.jpg

--- 帖子 #1650 ---
Hey rolo,

Looks like you have a good entry there about 23.50 or another bang on 00:00 if waiting for a clearer 30min ema cross.  Obviously a price retrace on 5m to 5ema is there at both those times.

To further refine entry switch to 1m and you have price at 5ema at 0:01 or 0:04.

The rsi is south on both TF which is good but you don't trade the rsi crosses (if that's what your green line is) but a pullback to the 5ems on the 5m as far as I'm aware.

--- 帖子 #1651 ---
Thanks Steve.

Yeah the green line is just to show where the cross was on the 30min, not an entry point. I add the same line and at same time onto the 5 min to get a better view to compare.  Otherwise the ups and downs on the RSI will get confusing comparing back and forth between TFs.

--- 帖子 #1652 ---
Teb,

I was curious what metrics you use to quantify trend strength/weakness

when you make your trend trade calls(if this proprietary my apologies)

I use a naive model myself for assessing which pairs I'd like to trade:

-TF: Daily, 4h, 1h, 15m, 5m

-Indi: 200 EMA

-7:00 EST I scan every pair and cross pair consisting of Aud,Eur,Gbp,Jpy,Usd

-If the pair is trending up(price is above 200 ema) on the Daily, 4h, or 1hr I give the base currency 2 points for each TF if its trending down I give the cross currency 2 points for each TF. I give 1 point for the lower TFs

-I add up each currencies total: Max = 32 Min = 0 and trade the strongest pairs against the weakest pairs

Do you use a similar approach?

-Cheers

Candle Formations .. 3 Candle Reversal /With PinCandle

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

This pattern consists of a candles at extreme will a big Shadow (Pin) extending the extreme position
With a break below the next candle, and this is with the higher trend charts.

1. Enter:
1. We want to see this Candle formation at the end of a strong trend. An up trend is higher highs & higher lows.
2. We want to see a big Pin Candle 2nd candle . the Pin part of the candle. The bigger the better
Of coarse the tail/nose going opposite to the old trend.
3. Best if the Pin Candle’s colour is opposite to the old trend’s colour.
4. Get in 1 pip (plus spread) above candle 3 in the pattern. d. Yellow line
5. Often it will be the 4 candle you enter on, but not always.

2. Targets 1st target c. blue line the number of pips from the bottom of Pin Candle 2nd candle pink line to bottom of 3rd Candle d. Yellow line : ...d - e = c - d.

3. Stop loss a few pips below the nose/tail of candle 2

4. Strongest trading use:
Reversal back to higher time chart trend. See pink box on hight time chart.We use the RSI over the 50% line.

but I do just mostly PA and RRR for real trading

--- 帖子 #1668 ---
Teb, is that because you found the system to be unprofitable in the end? Can I ask what PA system you would recommend?

--- 帖子 #1669 ---
no not at all, but it all all systems based on tools and not PA and RRR are like training wheels

a time comes when you want to move away from training wheel.

system works best with two TF, ie 5 mins and 30min in the opening two hours of any market or news times

or 1 hour and 4 hours other times

Cheers

Teb

--- 帖子 #1670 ---
Well I don't mind using training wheels for now. I have incorporated the multi time frame on 5 min chart by adding a 30 EMA representing the 5 EMA on a 30 min chart (6 x 5 = 30) and a 72 EMA representing the 12 EMA on the 30 min chart ( 6 x 12 = 72) I have also added a 120 RSI representing the 20 period RSI on the 30 min time frame. Do you see any disadvantages in doing it this way?

Attached is the set up on my chart.

You can see I have a an indicator that signals Short Engulf and Long Engulf candles. Can I ask where you would have placed your trades on this chart? I have already taken a 10 pip trade after the first Short Engulfing candle. I imagine pullbacks after the first cross are more risky?

What other candle formations would you recommend TEB ?

I am working my way thru your thread. Love what I have read so far and was worried when I saw you had stopped participating in the thread which is why I contacted you. Thank you for the information

--- 帖子 #1671 ---
Here is the chart I referred to in the previous post

--- 帖子 #1672 ---
TEB the thing I find frustrating with this is knowing when the angle is right. Sometimes the angle looks flatter and you would get whip sawed to death if you entered on a pull back. Other times it looks nice and steep but as so as you enter it peters out. So far I can only make this system break even at best. Any help would be appreciated.

--- 帖子 #1673 ---
And to judge where the pullback is, is tricky too. Sometimes you enter on a pullback to the 5 and 12 EMA and then it pulls back further and stops you out.

--- 帖子 #1674 ---
I find two charts better -- one of the reasons is the very thing you speak of. but more to the point do top down,
ie, find a great chart on the 30 min then move down to the 5 min chart. I think you will find easier.

also the higher the time frame the easier to trade - I only trade on the 4 hour and up now,

cheers

--- 帖子 #1675 ---
not the right time to trade this ie 30 min and 5 min

- need to trade this after the europe open - better the london open

-  here is the systen and reasons

--- 帖子 #1676 ---
Thank you sooooooo much for your help!

--- 帖子 #1677 ---
Thanks TEB. Just made 23 pips profit. Decided to get out at major support on eur/usd

--- 帖子 #1678 ---
you will make more on the 4 hour charts and swing trades are is better

3 TP yesterday for  wins  I close 3 more for wins to enter trades I thought had more up.

if you want to do this system do it on the day and 4 hour.

less trades more winners lest time in front of a screen

anyways

TEB

--- 帖子 #1679 ---
Are we talking about a different system on the 4 HR? If so can I ask the rules?

--- 帖子 #1680 ---
why same system - keep with the same system for at least 3 months - master it, if you like this one stay with it

I am just saying the higher time chart is easier

--- 帖子 #1681 ---
OK I will stick with this system TEB as I like it.

As far as pull back candle stick formations, I have done some back testing and found a pin bar or doji followed by a lower low (see attached pic) is often a good place to get in. Do you have any other reliable candle stick formations you use to enter on after a pullback?

Guys been fun

we have big statements with the CAD, GBP and the USD

esp. the USD will move the market big time

we have no way to know what will happen so I will take the day off!

I normally set and forget but with the FOMC statement

it effects the market

--- 帖子 #1684 ---
Thanks for all your help TEB enjoy your time off

Hmmmm where do you get your news from? I got stuck in a trade that was going nowhere as my news source did not state any significant news? This is what I use http://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/

--- 帖子 #1686 ---
hey Teb

Good to see you posting again.

I have always been a big fan of your threads and posts.

Good stuff

Thanks!

PGPB

--- 帖子 #1687 ---
well the chart you had  for news was fine  it had everything on it

- but what are you looking for?

My 1st question to you is,  what are you looking to trade - price or the market?

Price moves all the time for little reason- its a hard way to trade and this is where most people lose money

market has a place to go its the real thing - easier to trade.

Most news effects price -very few things effect the real market.

The best news charts I know of is here on FF

Go to the pink area in the attachment

Find the filter

Check only -the red and white boxes - if you want to trade only the market ( 4 hours and up)

Only this stuff will move the market and not just price.

cheers

teb

--- 帖子 #1688 ---
Teb, thanks for the ideas. What are you typical stop losses you use trading from the H4? And how many pairs do you monitor?

--- 帖子 #1689 ---
no problem hope it is helpful

4 hour Stop - well that depends what the market gives you ...

general you put a stop where price should not go for your system to be right

pairs I watch

--- 帖子 #1693 ---
Thanks anyway. I must say that looking at  this system again with fresh eyes and the longer time frames has been a breath of fresh air to me. Thankyou.

--- 帖子 #1694 ---
So TEB you got in on this trade on an engulfing bar right?

--- 帖子 #1695 ---
So Teb you think I will get burned doing 5M/30M ? If I was to trade the 4HR I can see how I could look at more charts. At what point in time do you start looking at the charts before the 4 hour period? How do you manage the trade? Do you still take off half at a certain price and let the other half run? If so how do you manager the other half when you are sleeping?

--- 帖子 #1696 ---
I tried to get in on a retest of the level of the OC but I got a really bad fill

--- 帖子 #1697 ---
You can trade the 5m/30m, but it has to be only in the busy hours  ie. 3am to noon (new York time) maybe 8pm to 10pm

Only do the main pairs ie USD or JAP, vs  USD, JAP, EUR, AUD, CAD.

Make sure you have a good RRR at least 3 to 1!!!!!!!!!!!

but you will have to sit there all day on the 5 min charts.

" before the 4 hour period" - I get in 95% on a limit orders -  I set it and forget it.

I normally let it run until it is all taken.

again sleeping- doesn't matter - in the limit order, I put  - entry - stop - target

-and I let it run - I normally look at it one to three times a day.

I will let it run-  if I get up 130 or more pips I may move the SL to B/E sometimes.

But I find the less I play with the trade the better I do

cheers

--- 帖子 #1698 ---
How do I know it's going to be good risk/reward? Today I lost money. The first few trades I closed half at 10 pips and let the other half run. It only ran once. The other time I made half the amount I was stopped out. So yeah lost money today. Would love to know how to get a better Risk/Reard

--- 帖子 #1699 ---
this is the greatest art in trading

The easiest is to just find the stop with the last swing or candle stop etc

then make the target 3 times that

(of coarse there can be more to it then this,  but this alone will win pips if you just win one out of 3 trades)

--- 帖子 #1700 ---
OK so the 30M is down. The 5M crosses down and forms a bearish pin bar. I enter a short after break of that pin bar and place my stop above that pin bar. My profit is then 3 x my risk. That being the length of the pin bar? Do I take some profit at any stage before the take profit is hit"?

--- 帖子 #1701 ---
you can do what ever you like but it changes the odds so I would say no -unless something else happens to change the trade rules

--- 帖子 #1702 ---
Teb just looking at the AUD/USD right now. Looks pretty good for a short if the pin bar is broken to the downside at the end of this current hour?

--- 帖子 #1703 ---
That last post is referring to the AUD on 4H chart. Daily is down and bearish pin bar forming on 4H

--- 帖子 #1704 ---
So if all of that is right I could put a sell order under that pin bar that expires in 4 hours with a stop above the pin bar and a limit order at 3 x the risk. Yes?

--- 帖子 #1705 ---
well you could but the pin is going the wrong way - so its not really a pin candle

on my charts you its the tail down  and the body up- (right) in a down trend this is not a pin

send the picture of your charts

this is not a pin break but something a little more complex

it still may work well but for other reasons altogether different from the pin

BUT

if you with the day trend and the 4 hour tend almost everything works and everything else is forgiven !!

lol

--- 帖子 #1706 ---
I would not take this trade - on this system's rules we have no retracement

the 4th aces so to speak is  the cross on the smaller TF chart  and this is to give you a good entry.

ie. a retracement - the key

--- 帖子 #1707 ---
if people are going to trade this short term make sure you have the flow

Only 3 times that can really traded - short term

(1) now is the best 2am (3am) to noon  New York time

(2) 2am to 4pm -  traders may be squaring accounts and not trading trend

(3) the Japan time -  much smaller flow

and everyone in jpy time from japan tent to do the same thing as they all watch the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo system

- its a nation past time esp. at thier lunch time

so you get crazy moves out of nowhere - from the charts we use anyways

esp. on the JPY crosses

so the 2am (3am) to noon is the only time I would trade this on the 30/5 min TF

--- 帖子 #1708 ---
well today and yesterday clearly show what is up!

Guys like crammer on CNBC and other were saying this Stock rally was real - had legs

I thought they were a bit daff

If it was real why did it not rise faster!

and why was the Volume so low ?

they were saying because the little guy was afraid to come in!

I thought all along it was the big boys pushing it up.

(1) because they could and (2) with a free lunch on the Fed

(3) and they knew it would drop fast where the fed changes

just a hint the free lunch may end some where down the road (and not to soon either!)

and the USA Stock marks nose dive.

When the lunch really is over - wow

S&P drops 100s in two days !

maybe we will have a little life in this trade yet lol

what a dead day -

--- 帖子 #1710 ---
The EurUsd best trending market

maybe a trade on the 4/1 hour charts looking to get in at a retest of the IC

--- 帖子 #1711 ---
looks like I missed this trade it has moved 65 pips from my limit entry to the good. It would have been a good trade~

cannot get them all

teb

--- 帖子 #1712 ---
could be a bad stock day again today

if this level breaks look out

--- 帖子 #1713 ---
Hopefully a late day rally

--- 帖子 #1714 ---
I love it when a plan comes together!

I just wish I was in it lol

I missed the entry by 2 pips !!!!!!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #1715 ---
Nice work! Teb you were saying you RR is 3 to 1. Is there any point at which you move to break even?

--- 帖子 #1716 ---
on larger trades around 120 pips to the good I will move to B/E

thank bro for this strategy

--- 帖子 #1720 ---
Market is turning or something- with my main system I could not find anything so I was trying to find some trades with this one

--- 帖子 #1721 ---
Welcome back TEB, after ages

--- 帖子 #1722 ---
This is a great starter system . This worked very very good - not normally quite this good every day.

shut down at days end,

--- 帖子 #1723 ---
Hi Teb, thanks for sharing your strategy!

I have followed your strategy for quite a while know, and I do have a question though,

so,

1. for example, for long trades,

Higher TF : we should have RSI above 55,

and try to find entry from lower TF (EMA 5 cross above EMA 12 and RSI above 55) right?

but,  when RSI cross above 55 on higher TF, RSI and EMA on lower TF are usually already far away from entry point. so, does that mean we can only enter from a retracement? and is it better if we only enter only from the first retracement?

2. lets say we have a retracement, i have this problem a multiple times, when about to go long, the price is usually already at the resistance level, and when about to go short, the price is usually already at the support level. do you have a same problem? or what do you think about this?

Thank you so much, your answer will mean a lot to me

Moving Averages can still be used at all times

This example uses multi-period EMA and MTF

--- 帖子 #1727 ---
Yes, they can, but is it for market condition or trade signal?

Details matter.

--- 帖子 #1728 ---
Basic rules of Moving Average :

Buy if the smallest MA is above and the largest MA is below, Sell the opposite

A larger TF is a major trend, a small TF is a mini trend

Other parameters are adjusted to each trading style

Below is just an example of following a major trend and its mistakes

And all of that is still speculation and relying solely on luck
