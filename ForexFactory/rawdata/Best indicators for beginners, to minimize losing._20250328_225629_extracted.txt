Greetings to all traders, As we know that as beginners, we are often trapped in complicated situations in reading charts so that the hope of getting a profit turns out to be a loss. For that, I advise you to follow the directions of several important indicators and not rely on your own hunches. I suggest you to use the following indicators: 1. Awesome 2. Fibonacci in the form of Moving Average 3. Daily pivots with S / R Time frame is 1 hour, stop loss is 30 pips and Target is between 30 to 70 pips. Please avoid setting very large daily targets such as 100 pips or greater as this can be a dangerous trap. I suggest that you use Euro / USD or USD / CHF because they are both more stable. You also have to recognize candle formations before entering. For example, all indicators have given orders to buy, so you need to see whether the market is ranging in the last 3 or 5 hours, if 'yes' then you need to start entry buy at lower support. It will be clearer after you look through the picture. Please use a Demo account as long as you learn this method or use a small amount of capital to open a position for real account. Thank you Bale

Eur / USD chart

--- 帖子 #3 ---
I will start trading tomorrow morning and also answer all questions. Thank you

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Time frame charts you use ? Please post template and indicators thanks

--- 帖子 #5 ---
waiting for further explanation and indicator..

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Did you read first post?

--- 帖子 #7 ---
what?

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Genius.......If I pay you will you train me to be a successful Forex trader?

--- 帖子 #9 ---
A truly revolutionary idea - read the first post - holy dooly, it's only a few posts above too -

--- 帖子 #10 ---
On a light hearted note, as it is a boring Aussie Monday Asian session, and I don't trade Mondays until about 4pm, I think a test to see if you are allowed to even trade currency/forex is if you can't read the first initial post properly! lol....couldn't resist!

--- 帖子 #11 ---
One hour tf and as you see I use Fibo in MA form, thanks.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
You will see it much more clearly after I present a picture of the trade I'm about to make. Thank you

--- 帖子 #13 ---
This is just an idea that aims to take advantage of the functionality of AWESOME and Fibo so that beginners can avoid losing streaks in transactions. Please use a domo account as long as you try it. Thank you

--- 帖子 #14 ---
This is an example of AWESOME's ability to make initial entries and how to take advantage of the lower limit for re-entry.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
The Best is + momentum.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Can you share your template and Fib indi, it looks like this trading system could be very fruitful

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Fibo in Moving Average form, Ema 50 close Ema 38 close Ema 23 close Ema 13 close Ema 5 close, thank you

--- 帖子 #18 ---
This is an example of how AWESOME provides clear examples of how to get started selling early and how to re-enter.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
EU. Waiting for an information from AWESOME

--- 帖子 #20 ---
USD/CHF AWESOME, will there be an initial entry for USDCHF ??

--- 帖子 #21 ---
USD/CHF Charts Waiting ....

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Usdchf 1h just popped through the daily R1. Awesome Occ just pointed up green. Are you entering after candle closes in 45 mins? 9am eastern?

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Sorry I was away, indeed AWESOME has given confirmation to buy but I still have to wait for confirmation from the Fibo retracement and after that I will make a decision. This method really tests patience and that is what is needed to avoid losing and maximizing the profits to be achieved. This USD / CHF pair will provide an initial entry which will give a substantial profit, especially after being followed by a Re-enter signal as in the example of the image that I have shown earlier. Thank you very much for your confirmation.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Wkwk muhun kang, supados para newbie tiasa diajar, wilujeng sukses kang.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
thank you for replying . Do you find it hard to keep up with the 1h charts while busy/out /at work ? I assume you check the close of all 1h candles . Most movement London and NY

--- 帖子 #26 ---
USD/CHF Awesome has agreed, but I still have to wait for the Fibo retracement to provide more strength to the initial entry I will take.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Yes you are right I follow every movement in the EU and UC every candle is closed and will pay special attention after AWESOME and Fibo give approval. The situation will be very pleasant if the initial entry appears especially if there is support from UL or LL. Thank you very much

--- 帖子 #28 ---
EU AWESOME has confirmed, almost all Fibo retracement have confirmed, and Upper Limit has been reached. I will do the Initial entry in a few moments.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
newbie here trying to learn. im sorry if this question looks stupid but where i can find the daily pivot and moving average ?

--- 帖子 #30 ---
EA Hi, Fiboncci retracement in the form of EMA is as follow; EMA 50 close EMA 38 close EMA 23 close EMA 13 close EMA 5 close Pivots_daily1.ex4

--- 帖子 #31 ---
USDCHF AWESOME has confirmed, Fibo retracement have all confirmed , and the Lower Limit has been reached. I will do the Initial entry in a few hours.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Is that supposed to be a long or short?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
USD/CHF ? it must be a bull

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Why do you think so ?

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Based on indicator instructions

--- 帖子 #36 ---
OK, AO is going down (presently) so pls explain what "instructions" any indicator is giving.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
In the next half hour we will see if NEWS plays a role more than indicators. USD / CHF will go up according to the indicator and EUR / USD will go down, I chose to follow the indicators

--- 帖子 #38 ---
You have a large heart. Thanks a million for your generosity!

--- 帖子 #39 ---
You may be right and we will see BUT I doubt anyone here understanmds WHY you say that

--- 帖子 #40 ---
This is a risk, I trade based on AWESOME and Fibonacci. Short EU at 1.18263 TP at 1.16273 SL at 1.18643

--- 帖子 #41 ---
If AWESOME and Fibonacci have said to sell then I have to follow without fear of losing. This is the initial entry for the EU

--- 帖子 #42 ---
The EU is doing its job, and it's time to see the latest developments in USD/CHF.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
As seen in the image below, all indicators agree to buy, so I just need to wait for the Lower limit to be met to start making Initial entries. Maybe around the NY session.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
but WHY do you feel the indication is to go long ? Is it because the Fib lines have now aligned in order, or do you feel the fractional move in AO is likely to strengthen ? I am not saying you are wrong - just trying to get a handle on your observations. For my part - I don't see any reliable bias at this moment.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
As I said before, if AWESOME and Fibonacci have shown the same direction, then I have to see whether it is an Initial entry or not, so I just need to see if there is a Lower limit to wait for or enter right away. I can't analyze charts outside of the indicators I understand. thanks.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hopefully the EU continues to fall and this entry will become an Initial entry. Unfortunately I was taking a nap when the USD/CHF started to creep up , wait and see

--- 帖子 #47 ---
EU, will this be an Initial entry? If so, there will be a re-entry tomorrow which will be even longer.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
I have shifted Stop loss to profit +4

--- 帖子 #49 ---
great job bale

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Thank you very much

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Most likely USD / CHF will make an Initial Entry around 0.9115, because AWESOME and Fibonacci are very supportive

--- 帖子 #52 ---
If it becomes true in the next few hours then this Initial entry will be followed by a Re-enter which will be very long and satisfying.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Please are these 2 indicators the same: Awesome and Awesome Oscillator? Fibonacci in the form of Moving Average - How does this one work? Is this a stand-alone indicator and where can it be found? Thank you for a job well done.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Bale, I've been following this tutorial. Its quite cool. My question is this; what inspired to choice of TP. I'm a newbie tho. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Hi bale, look at the picture NZDCAD. Is it a good entry or not?

--- 帖子 #56 ---
You called that right for sure. In your setup I don't see what you are seeing but I cannot argue with your result. I will set up a couple of additional charts and watch what happens - maybe the penny will drop. :-)

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Yes it's a same indi. You can set it as follow ema 50 close ema 38 close ema 23 close ema 13 clse ema 5 close, they are all Fibonacci retracement

--- 帖子 #58 ---
As I said in post # 1, the target is between 30 to 70 pips, but usually if it's an Initial entry then the target can be S3 or R3. Thank you

--- 帖子 #59 ---
It looks like the entry should be between pivot and s1 but I don't trade NZDCAD. Thanks

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Hopefully the way we view the additional charts will be the same. Thank you

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Come on EU, make the Upper limit first before you free fall to 1.1630

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Thank you so much.

Advice for new users of Metatrader, learn what it means when you sign up for Community, it gives you access to hundreds of FREE indicators, utilities, scripts, and EA's at https://www.mql5.com/ Don't be put off by the "5" plenty there for MT 4 Here is one for a start, Round Numbers. Can you be bothered to waste hours placing Support &amp; Resistance lines on Weekly, Monthly, Daily charts for every pair like they tell you in a Youtube video? Or in that $500 course, you bought? https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/27658 With this one, you can isolate the 100 numbers to the daily, the 50 numbers to 4 Hour, and the 25 numbers to 1 Hour and lower of course. Can you tell the difference between S&amp;R? Does it matter? See 3 charts of GBPJPY below. The next best thing to learn is the MARKET tab , and the Codebase tab too, right within Metatrader; here you can find the very same FREE items mentioned as being on MQL5.com. Use the Free as Filter and the Search is easy Good luck

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Good Job Bal ..., Thanks for this posting, i am trying to learning and practice today with position in euro usd sell at 1.18280, i hope can reached 30 pipis today close at 1.7980.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Thank you for this info and I really appreciate it.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Congratulations, the way you opened a transaction on upper limit has indicated it. You have mastered it. Be careful with AWESUME which has started to change. Thanks

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Thanks Bal ... done close 30 pips. Thank you I will see any price changes in the market for re-entry. Greetings for profit in trade and health for Bal and all of us.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
My pleasureand congratulations. I really like it every time a member can master this method.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
This UCHF chart shows that AWESOME won't change easily every time it supports each other with Fibonacci. In a situation like this, our only task is to apply re-entry from the Lower limit. Happy learning for you to get more and more understanding.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
[quote = bale; 13257352] Grafik UCHF ini menunjukkan bahwa AWESOME tidak akan mudah berubah setiap kali mendukung satu sama lain dengan Fibonacci. Dalam situasi seperti ini, satu-satunya tugas kita adalah menerapkan masuk kembali dari batas Bawah. Selamat belajar bagi Anda untuk mendapatkan lebih banyak pemahaman. {image} [/ quote] Nice Bal ..., its great point to entry. Oh yeah I saw on your grap there are red and blue lines R1 and S1 , I don't have it in my graph, can you help me with that. Thank you in advance for your generosity in helping me. Regards

--- 帖子 #71 ---
oh itu di daily pivot. Googling disini, Pivots_daily1.ex4

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Finding it difficult to master the method. Please do you have video explaining how these indicators are inserted? Extremely Newbie!

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Have any of you from Indonesia used the $ 100 FBS bonus? I tried yesterday, with a capital of $ 100 a profit of $ 15. Unfortunately you can only use 0.01 per entry. This is even a lesson that AWESOME and Fibonacci are a compatible indicator pair.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
It's actually very easy, please follow these instructions: 1. Open a new EU chart 2. Select Moving Average Exponential (EMA) 50, close. 3.EMA 38 3.EMA 23 4.EMA 13 5. EMA 5 Numbers 2 to 5 are called the Fibonacci retracements in the Moving Average format After that, click Awesome After that, add pivot_daily1.ex4 and enter it into the indicator list on your chart. Googling on FF to get it. It's easy, right?

--- 帖子 #75 ---
A good job indeed! It feels good to see someone mastering skills that are not everyone’s cup of tea!

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Thank you Bale. I will try it now.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
the pivot daily I got from FF didn't work on my mt4. can you share yours?

--- 帖子 #78 ---
try this

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Please where can I get this: pivot_daily1.ex4? I only saw a video from ff on how to instal indicators.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Here you are.... I got 7cent in my account......hahaha

--- 帖子 #81 ---
open chrt click File click open data folder clck MQL4 click indicators copy paste pivot_daily1.mt4

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Nice

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Fibonacci in the EU is getting more perfect, please prepare your mentally and do a Re-enter only from the Upper limit. For those who have not mastered this method, please use a Demo account.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Please this indicator, Dale-AwesomePivotFib-Template.tpl is not showing in my chart. Where did I miss it? I did follow the same method. I saw the daily pivot but not this one. Thank you for being so helpful.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Hi Glorybound, I already check the template and indi once again but no problem. I don't know which part is your problem. Awesome and Moving Average are MT4 indi. Only the pivot will be added and I already give to you. What can I show is the pivot setting in case you need to adjust. Wish you all the best.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Bale, A new setup is developing on EU,S1 could be an initial entry ...

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Trades using FBS bonus money today generate 23% profit. This is a lesson learned that in trading on the forex market sometimes there will be a correction.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Yes, there will be the formation of an upper limit and it will be caught in a few hours. It seems that you have also passed this method

--- 帖子 #89 ---
For those who are still learning, try showing the location where there is free money on this chart.

Please try once more

Best indicator for beginners? STOP playing forex =)

--- 帖子 #99 ---
This is the correct answer

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Can you explain why? Because fibo is in downtrend, AO below 0 and the market was ranging in the last few candles?

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Thanks a million Kopra Tasa. I was actually looking to see Dale-AwesomePivotFib-Template.tpl in my list of indicators. Is there any adjustment to be made in the awesome indicator or do I leave it at default?

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Hi bale, thank you for nice trading strategy. Please why did you trade 11.11. EU buy when Awesome was under 0? Thanks

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Sell at the upper limit

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Instead, we have to sell if the price is below 0, thanks

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Sorry bro, AO indi are created default. We cannot change anything. Maybe you can use CCI. They can get similar formation with AO. Wish you all the best.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Bale can you explain more what is upper limit and lower limit, a when we see upper limit where we take trade (first or second candle?)? Thank you very much. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Nice question for the newbies...

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Awesome cut 0 upwards, all MAs are in their respective positions, then the price will be stuck at LL aka Lower Low aka the lowest bottom of the last few candles. BUY immediately around this when the price is closed.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Is this sell correct?

--- 帖子 #110 ---
yes, that's right, you can be locked in + 1 after profit 15; thanks

--- 帖子 #111 ---
The best indicators for newbies to minimise loosing ARE NO INDICATORS AT ALL. (A very few people will understand what i mean in here,lmao,considering the nature of the people/traders in here.) No indicators is the BEST indicator!!

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Having indicators or no indicator make no different because this all are called Technical Analysis. Unless if you are SCAMMER, then the trading can be useless and nonsense. best or worst is only depends on individual. Look like you are newbie and know nothing about trading.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Awesome Oscillator, Fibonacci &amp; Pivot Point is not the best indicator for beginners but best of the best indicator for all users if understanding how this indicator works. Bale, Congratulations on your thread you have done your best!

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Thank you very much , kang

Post # 74 &amp; #81

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Sorry Bale, I still don't get what do you mean by an upper limit and lower limit? .. is it the pivot line you refer it as the upper limit and lower limit or is it the high and low of the consolidation range?

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Yes, that is the answer

--- 帖子 #120 ---
1. Starting Monday 16 Nov 2020, I will give an example of how to apply this method in real trading so that beginners will see how the development of small capital can become large in a month.For example a $ 100 capital will be $ 200 or $ 250. 2. I will use the $ 100 BONUS money I received from FBS . So if you beginners also want to use cash then please register for free at FBS or another broker that offers the same program. 3. Don't try to use cash for beginners who don't have Bonus money from FBS. Please use a DEMO account.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
4. I have mentioned all the indicators and how to apply them in the chart, so that all beginners will understand the teaching. This thread is only 6 pages long so it is mandatory for beginners to read from pages 1 to 6 so there is no need to ask very simple basic questions. Please learn to read and learn to understand.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
5. Believe me beginners that I will be very focused on reading political and market news on FF, and will follow the price movements very closely before I give any signal in this thread. That's why I won't have time to answer basic questions.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
6. Traders who already have experience and happen to be prone to following the signals I am about to give can do so using the least amount of risk.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
7. This is how I make this notice to be understood by all beginners and thank you very much for your attention.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
USDCHF is stable? I sure don't see it. I do however like your use of the trends. I use EMA 15, 30 and 50 in M5, M15, H1 for support and resistance entry once there is some movement in a direction.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Based on last chart it will go down

--- 帖子 #127 ---
A chart will guarantee direction? Maybe think of your system and you want it to go up before going down. It would be a higher probability of going down if it goes up and touches the EMA or your upper limit. 91380 or so would provide confirmation if it dropped back after getting there. ie the bears are in charge. My point was that USDCHF is far from stable in my observation. But that can be played as well. Always will have a large corrective move to any large move up or down. Breakouts will have a large correction. I never chase this pair and wait for that big reversal to get on board. But it does hold the EMA's and your limit lines when it does move. Finding the pairs that hold them is important.

I do have the ability to analyze GJ's behavior better than other pairs. That's why I entered at 6.20 this morning because I saw an opportunity for GJ to go up. Unfortunately the conditions weren't so good that GJ just walked sideways and I was forced to close it with a little profit. At first I thought the GJ pair was not suitable for beginners so I only gave signals on EU and UCH but it turns out that this thread is followed by experienced traders, so I will no longer hesitate to discuss GJ. This pair of GJ is indeed lazy and boring but strangely he is able to run faster than Timo Werner the Chelsea striker, because GJ is able to run 150 pips per hour to 300 pips.

--- 帖子 #144 ---

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Nice job , thanks

--- 帖子 #146 ---
In a few hours I will buy gj because I see that this pair is still determined to move upwards. Indeed, right now he was catching his breath and would soon be flying at almost maximum speed.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
AWESOME and FIBONACCI draw the direction of GJ movement perfectly. We just need to follow it with help from PIVOT

--- 帖子 #148 ---
if I get this system correctly, you take a trade when the candle stick rests on the lower limit in an uptrend?

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Yes, perfect. I love seeing how you understand this method. The results that I will achieve from the transaction will be the same as the results you will receive on the condition that you also make an entry after I give a call to the GJ pair and also set a target and stop loss.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Indeed we will find defeats here and there but we will win over and over again.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
GJ, Long 138,000 tp 140,758 sl 137,500

--- 帖子 #152 ---
That's GJ's strength, like biting in a blanket. He moved at unexpected times.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Good day RoshanS. Please what is that information towards the right edge of your chart - the one containing MACD, STR, and EMA? Below it is 1.32426; Spread 16.0, PIPS to open, 517, High to Low, 835, and Daily Av. 1097.0. What indicator is responsible for this date. Just learning and curious to know. Thank you for being so helpful.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Out +12

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Today GJ is a bit tired and it is better for him to rest first to recover his strength.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
i think it is a good indicator for beginners to define trends better. it is not repainted and also customizable that we can find a better setting for our trading purposes. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached File(s) 03-Swing Catcher.ex4 31 KB | 485 downloads

It's too risky to go back in because the timing isn't right. Even though there will be a Lower Low in the New York session, I will not enter again.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Thank you. Please can you, at your convenience, interpret those parameters, and what is the advantage of using signal bars in trading?

Thank you

Of course, news from the presidential election.

If snapper is not available then a lot of anchovies can replace it. It took 2 weeks to turn $ 100 into $ 200. I use the FBS bonus account .

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Today's GJ pair range is only 28 pips and spread is 5 pips

--- 帖子 #163 ---
i still cant comprehend what yall saying Bale,am a newbie i cant find the indicators either.Pls I need assistance. LITE FOREX IS MY BROKER

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Take a look, the new LL again? GJ, do you want to take scalping until tomorrow morning?

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Actually, I can also sell from the Upper limit, but I chose to buy because the range is very narrow, only 28 pips, while we have to pay a spread of 5pips x 2 for each transaction. very risky. Thanks

--- 帖子 #166 ---
lease read from the beginning of the thread, and if possible, follow every call that I will give, thank you.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
I have done so already,seems my platform is different am having issues

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Friends, our target is to follow the trend from the very beginning with the target of snapper or tuna . So I was just doing the scalping fun today.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Hello, do u still have ur buys open on GJ?

--- 帖子 #170 ---
No position anymore, I am very sleepy after 19 hours OL, thanks

--- 帖子 #171 ---
See you tomorrow guys, thank you for your time.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
I did a search and got it from a blogger. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Why you take longs? MAs and AO are for SELL

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Short GJ @ 137,698 tp 136,198 sl 138,200

--- 帖子 #175 ---
My pleasure

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Today we are trying to catch a snapper due to uncertain market conditions. These are the market conditions that GJ loves so much and we hope to be successful.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Our trading method, on average, earns 3,000 pips in 6 months, but that doesn't mean we will earn 500 pips per month. Sometimes it's only 350 pips, 88 pips, 350 pips, 545 pips or 1,230 pips. It all depends on market conditions.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Can you put a trade explorer on this?

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Currently, the UJ pair is safe to sell.

--- 帖子 #180 ---

Today the market doesn't provide snapper, instead it consumes small bait

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Analysis of the reasons for losing 11 pips today

--- 帖子 #183 ---
1. I entered too fast because I thought the Upper limit occurred at 137,689

--- 帖子 #184 ---
2. It turns out that the market prefers 137,940 and that should be today's upper limit.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
3. The market had offered me a 10 pips profit which of course I immediately rejected.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Hopefully next week we will not only catch snapper but will catch giant marlin.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Hi Bale, what are these figures on top or bottom of the candles for - what do they represent?

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Analysis chart

--- 帖子 #189 ---
What do you mean by "snapper" please? What of this one, "lot of anchovies"?

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Down arrow means sell and up arrow means buy. Green means winning and red means losing.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Bale, Kindly share your indicators and templates here. Thanks

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Sorry, but the title of this thread is so ridiculous that I just had to comment. There is no single indicator or combination of indicators that will stop you from losing or enable you to win if you do not have the knowledge of price movement to enable you to read the markets with clarity, and this, unless you are some kind of special genius, takes years. To assume that an indicator can provide a short cut to success is as delusional as looking for an off the shelf winning system on the internet. Trial and error based knowledge is the only way anyone can succeed in this business, and losing over and over, not trying to avoid losing, is the best way to eventually achieve it.

Indicator with input field. Indicator is from "Copyright 2005-2014, MetaQuotes" without input. Therefore I do not want to post it here. If you are interested I can post the lines and you can change them yourself. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Interested.. How do we get it ?

--- 帖子 #202 ---
I agree and disagree. If you know what the indicators are telling you, then they can be used to trade off. A simple moving average for example can tell not only which way a trend is but also its rate of movement. A stochastic can give you a low risk entry point if used in conjunction with the trend. Just one example. You are right in that you need to study and try these things out as really there is more than one way to trade. Could go on but time is of the essence.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
In the picture you can see the name and where you can get it. Change lines 22 and 23. Add lines 24 and 25. Save changes. Compile. Finished. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The indicator does not belong to me it belongs to MetaQuotes. Therefore I do not want to pass on an indicator that I have changed 4me. How you can adapt it for yourself is described above. Very simple, takes only a few seconds. I use the indicator only for my own use. Have fun.

Starting from today I have made a few changes and you will see the results in the next 10 days. If the results are good then I will share them. Again, I remind you to use a demo account as long as you follow my method until you feel confident.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
The pairs that I will use are GJ, GU, AU, EU and UJ.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
I call this new method " The Cowboy Method" because of its principle of chasing cows from the backs and herding them into the pen. My hope is that with this Cowboy method, we can get 200 to 300 pips in a week. In a few hours this method will be in action.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Rules that need to be followed: 1. The first target is S1 or R1 or a minimum of 30 pips. 2. The second entry target is of course S2 or R2 to R3 in a very trending market condition. 3. Stop loss is -30 4. Apply Locked profit +2 during the first transaction to protect your account. 5. Never try to stop a train even though the price has entered the area for entry.

Sir idiot,KopraTasa....lmao... i dont know if you were trying to sound "cool",or "clever" but the more you talk the more i realise how clueless you are. Go learn from the bankers/pple who create the market and trade large volumes,pple who actually hold the majority of the FX bag,they will all tell you how useless all those macds ,ichomukos,moving averages etc are! Everytime they line up and tell your idiotic pompous self its ok to buy/sell the market makers pullback and or consolidate.(70 % of the time). I dont expect you to understand me at all....after all you are just and average joe trading some account equivalent to some guys lunch money out there. So take a breath and respect your elders.Been doing this since you were an inch in you daddys pants. Go find some average dick head to play with. Most of the retail traders are hard headed,learn from each other and think you the best thing since slice bread...and none of you are holding large impactful volumes or participation in the markets...let alone make any impacts in your life using trading.... Meaning,the banks hold the majority of volume,yet statistically they constitute the minority in numbers of paritcipants...On the other hand the retail sector holds a large number of pariticipants and very little volume....so why in the heck would anyone in their right mind learn,take advice or take notes from the no money participants.-doesnt make sense at all. If you think i am talking bullshit,PLEASE PLEASE show me indicator that has made you a consistent trader AKA helped you minimise losses!!!(ill be waiting). haha,some flipping idiots in here.shaking my head(lmao). So Traopaza...you are the one who woke up this dragon,how do you like me now!!!? Bears make money,Bulls make money-and the pigs get slaughtered...Gordon G.

Why in those 9 days, only the best 2 days for entry? Newbies will see a new method of transacting with GJ, EJ and AJ to be able to generate profits on time.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Of the 3 pairs available, at least we would expect to get 150-200 pips a week

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Why did I choose to trade only with these 3 pairs? Because they often make happy surprises.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Happy surprise from GJ

--- 帖子 #259 ---
In the same period EJ was a bit disappointing.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
In fact, during that period, AJ was also neutral

--- 帖子 #261 ---
It means that in the period 7-11 Sept 2020 only GJ gave a happy surprise, EJ donated a little and AJ was just silent. So why do I still use AJ for transactions? Because there are times when this pair goes crazy alone, leaving its competitors far behind.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Hahaha, of course I'm just kidding, what I mean is GA and this pair is one of our mainstays in future transactions. Let you see how great GA is in making profits in the same period.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
We will focus on transactions on GJ, EJ and GA. Starting tomorrow we will focus on getting 150 - 200 pips per week from these 3 pairs.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
It's actually too early, but GJ is already challenging to duel which I am obliged to accept.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Hello dude, I've taught about all the required indicators and how to apply them, and repeated it many times. There is no need to teach the same things over and over to a beginner who just comes without going through the first page. Thanks

--- 帖子 #272 ---
It seems that the economic news that will be released today will press GA, so I will sell GA for today. Unusually, I want this thread to be more active in asking questions about why I made the decision to sell or buy and why I set a target at a certain price, so I will trade on a 4 hour time frame instead of daily. Each candle changes, I will have the option to continue or close the current transaction, so those of you who are interested in participating can do it on 4 occasions.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
We have to be careful because in less than an hour the bad news of Astralia will be out, so we have to prepare to buy GA . Check market conditions: 1. The news will be bad, the effect of GA will go up. 2. The EMA14 indicator is already below the EMA5, the effect is that GA will rise. 3. H1 price is trying to go to the pivot, the effect is GA will go up. 4. I am mentally good, the effect is I will win this transaction.

In a bearish situation, after the first transaction is closed at least +50 pips, then we will wait for the Morning Star to appear to carry out the second transaction.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
to me it looks like the ema is a buy or neutral signal, can you please explain the reason for entry on this? Thank you!!

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Pardon me I was sleeping. Please wait a moment

--- 帖子 #319 ---
You are right, when I took the transaction, EMA5 was still&gt; EMA14 on TF H4. If I wait for a new candle to open, it means I will miss the train because Big News will come out in 1 hour aka 07.30. That's why I saw the situation on H1 TF because the previous night I won 105 pips and there is no way that GA will make a correction in the situation Big News will come out in 1 hour. Incidentally, the price is slightly above the pivot, which means I will take a short position with the S2 target. Why Short? because the news for Australia will be good. Proven right? I got another +84 pips

--- 帖子 #320 ---
GA and GJ are 2 crosses that we really rely on to contribute 200 to 300 pips every week. But between the two, GJ is sometimes a bit naughty because it often makes corrections when the profit is still around 60 pips and it will make us disappointed. To outsmart it, when we transact with GJ for the first time (there are 3 opportunities in 24 hours) then we can close the transaction when the profit reaches +50 or at R1 / S1. Please don't forget this secret , and we will continue the transaction at the opening of the next candle.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
I also have pivot points on my charts but just to identify if the price is high or low, nothing else. Not to directly trade them, well because i've seen couple of expanding markets piercing through all the resistances or supports of the day in couple of hours and expanding hundres of pips away from them, so how would that make any sense to buy Support 4? or sell the highest resistance directly etc. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Good morning cowboys, I hope today we will have a happy surprise.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
I totally agree with your comment, the S / R pivot is only an indication of where the price will start moving and where the possible limit will be. Due to the reason I sold GA yesterday from around the pivot, it was only because the price happened to be around the pivot when I had to enter because News would be out in 30 minutes. Thank you

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Cowboys, it looks like we still have to wait because GA is in the process of giving us a good signal.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
You should know the ADR of any pair you trade and all trades should target and be pressed to that number.. press without exception

We must get in the habit of analyzing all the achievements we have made in live trading as correction material for wrong transactions and as things that must be repeated for positive results.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
From 30 Nov to 4 Dec we only use 2 currencies to transact, they are GA and EU pairs. As our target for each currency pair they must contribute 150 pips to 200 pips in a week. Did they fulfill their obligations?

--- 帖子 #381 ---
If GA or the EU succeeds in fulfilling its obligation to contribute 150-200 pips a week, then we must respect these two currencies. We must read 5 times back and forth about the news about both of them in the FF calendar about the events that will occur and adjust it to the strategy we have mastered.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Let's take a look at the results.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
GA managed to complete its task by giving +206 pips and it was very happy.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
The EU also managed to complete its task successfully and gave a return of 270 pips. A very proud achievement.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Hi Balle Can you please clarify the entry rule of circled candle, here EMA5 is already above EMA13.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Good question, this was live trading a few days ago. When I took the decision to sell, it was still influenced by the previous conditions where I won 105 pips, and when EMA5 and MACD gave a signal, I immediately sold. Another consideration at the time was that Australian news would come out good while Poud's news was bad. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
In addition, EMA5 and MACD 121 are very ideal pairs and they both react very quickly to all changes that occur in the 4 hour time frame.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Sometimes the market is preparing to satisfy us and fortunately we use this method to take all the profits the market provides. Similar to the condition where someone is trying to fish next to you who is fishing with a net. Take a look at this market.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
In this market condition, the Euro alone has contributed 300 pips in a week, what about the additional pips from GA and GJ? You will be proud of your own ability to make a profit.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Thanks for clarification.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
In this condition we need to monitor the pair continuously instead of looking it 4 hourly.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Yes, we should still monitor price movements so we can get out around 50 pips on the first transaction of the day {please check the rules}

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Good morning cowboys, I wish you all good health and good spirits.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
I have read the news about the Euro next week, 3 times back and forth, I hope that we will have an encouraging result of between 200 and 250 pips from the EU next week. Don't forget to limit tp to 50 pips for the FIRST transaction every day, aka the first candle of 5 candles, ok?

--- 帖子 #395 ---
GA will also try to provide the best for us. We hope to earn between 150-200 pips from this pair next week.

We must pay attention to the movement of Cable because this is the center of the forex market movement. Hopefully we can also get 150 -200 pips from GU next week.

Good morning cowboys, may we have a happy surprise today.

Hi Balle I took 2 trades today and all landed in loss, did I do something wrong here.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Nice trades

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Congratulations, I just focused on the EU earlier and I didn't realize that there was a signal in GU.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
MACD with this rules does not work like this

--- 帖子 #409 ---
I also lost -22 pips because I only focused on EU, and I didn't realize that there was a signal in GU.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
You're absolutely right, I should have followed the signal in GU. I am too complacent about the EU results so far.

Sorry that I didn't take this opportunity.

Seems like you have other powerful and important indicators - do you mind sharing?

It will look very plentiful under your Christmas tree, I think

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Bro, I've given all the secrets about this strategy, there are 10 rules that must be followed, and I've also shown how to transact based on this strategy. When I make a profit of 50 pips, 105 pips or 84 pips I accept it happily and when the time comes to lose 22 pips I also accept it gracefully. So if we have entered according to the rules and it turns out the market is against the direction, then we have to accept it. That's what we use a stop loss for. The only way not to lose real money is to use a demo account. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
I totally agree, and I am happy to share this strategy. Let's transact with a happy heart while enjoying the song "Joy to the World". Thank you bro for the support.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Good morning cowboys, May today we have a happy surprise from this wild forex market.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Please understand the entry rules starting from post # 333

--- 帖子 #419 ---
I Hope you guys get used to reading the news and see how it affects the pairs you will take. We already have clear entry rules, stop loss and target, so you can enter without fear as long as it follows the rules of this method.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
The best indicator is you! You should learn some price action and everything will change. Why will you use indicators? Indicators are delayed price action... if you learn price action. you will be the indicator and you will remove the lagging indicator. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
EJ pair, the last 2 candles tend to go down, where EMA 5 is already below Ema 10 and MACD 1,2,1 is below 0. This means that the indicator has given a sell signal so that EJ may be sold if the price returns to EMA5. Please watch the News now, will the Euro news weaken? or the Yen will be strong? Newbies should use a demo account.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
I really appreciate your advice, thank you very much

Thats all ok, I just wanted to confirm that my entries were right. PS: Its a demo account.

hello friend... can you share indicator and tpl?

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Wondering why you missed the GBP drop? The insiders, hedge-funds, and political elite already knew the drop was coming. Look at my chart and you can see the setup completely. The un-trained eye can see beyond using a ton of indicators. You really think the Central Banks not telling their friends which way they will move the market. You better think again. You really think they trade on M15,M30,H1,H4 timeframes. No, they trade on information before the world knows. You can track their footprints on offline charts. I use the M10. USA and London controls the money flow via World Bank and their Central Banks. The money movement must go through both countries. This is why EU is so scared to leave because

You have nice template but believe me it is the mindset which takes you to profitability. Would you mind sharing how you scan pairs to trade, what are the rules you are considering while opening and closing the trades.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Im sorry but my template will not be shared. I spent quite some time understanding coding to perfect my cloud indicator. The other indicator is available freely which is TMA-CG by Mladen. I will just post which direction the market is headed for three pairs I focus on. GBPUSD,EURUSD, and GOLD.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
See how the Elite and Insiders already knew the news before the world. Better understand how this game is played or get left behind. Smart Money have eyes and ears in every government. There's no fair play when trading; all about the money grab from government Central Banks....

Last post for me. Just to show real trades placed. Understanding the Smart Money.

ok, I personally don't think it's nice, because we're all here to support each other, but everyone has to know how and what they are doing themselves. But then I hope that you can be asked questions, for example i have one, what kind of cloud is that on the chart, is it Ichimoku?

--- 帖子 #441 ---
I understand. Trading is not fair. If so, everybody would be Millionaires. I have given this forum plenty free systems over the years. Check under systems and you will see how much I gave. This system will only be given to private lessons to serious traders. However, I'm giving free market direction to help beginners least make a buck or two.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
how can you have given this forum a lot of system if you don't even know the rules? so i don't just post my ideas to someone in a tread who has absolutely nothing to do with your system...I have already seen through you my friend, you are a would like to, that's what we call guys like you in Germany

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Oh and something else, my good ... if I give a coder what you've posted here and add 20 EUR to it, I'll have the settings for your system tomorrow, but only if I really wanted it

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Your current user account was only created December 2020. So did you use a different account when you gave this 'forum plenty of free systems over the years' ?

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Leave him alone, he just wants to make himself important and unfortunately there are a lot of them in this forum, what he posted is nothing special and maybe he just wants to lure people to do something else, we have already had that here very often. Be a fox

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Play with the settings until they come close to that of the aggieman01, show him that you are a fox Whether you will be successful with the strategy is another piece of paper.

It will not help I think, since people will still do errors. It's about way of thinking. I also made 2 000% in week when following my own rules and then big boom came because I did not follow it at all. Plus these indi will lag. They are usable, yes, but not always. They need to learn WHEN to use which indicator. SF

Cowboys, from the morning I tried the new science "scalping GU", and I have entered 3 times and the results are like this. This method seems interesting too, especially if the market is trending.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
GU M15

--- 帖子 #467 ---
We expect to try it after London to NY opens. Want to know the results in trending markets.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Scalping Rules : 1. EMA 2. MACD 2,3,1

--- 帖子 #469 ---
3 The market is ranging, so the entry from the EMA4 after MACD 2,3,1 agrees, with a target of 20-25 pips and sl 23 pips. This condition usually occurs during Asian markets.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
4. The market is trending, so after 50 pips is reached you can add lots and the next target is 40-50 pips. This condition occurs after the London market opens until midnight Jakarta time.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
5. In the event of a candle that goes against the direction and engulfs the last candle, immediately close the last position.

Hello Bale, I am a beginner trader living in France. I am reviewing your different methods of trading which I find very instructive. I am currently trying to elaborate a trading system with a reasonable win rate, but I am hesitating between scalping trading, day trading, swing trading or a mix. I can see that you trade in one hour time frame which can be considered as day trading (with Awesome and Fibonacci in the form of Moving Average indicators) and also scalp (with EMA and MACD indicators)(which time frame?). As a beginner, what advice would you give me in terms of starting trading scalping or day trade? Are your methods applicable with commodities and indices? Are they successful in long run without adding any other technical analysis? Regards

The advantages of scalping are a small stop loss and we can even exit if the last candle is engulfed.

you are right. My observation is that it is not a valid setup to take a trade. Moreover below 4hr TF nothing works.
