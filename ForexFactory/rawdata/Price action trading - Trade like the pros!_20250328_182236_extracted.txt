TEMPORARILY REMOVING THIS FIRST POST Have a look at This post and that one, before you go further. Hello and welcome to the thread. We will be learning how to perform proper Technical Analysis and trade the markets. I have recapped the information needed in short Youtube videos, as we will be basing our TA on 4 pillars, which are: Market Structure, Key Support/Resistance levels and Supply/Demand zones, Liquidity &amp; Stops , and finally Fibonacci . Find me on Youtube - www.youtube.com/1337WD and Twitter - https://twitter.com/wndrfldays123

The Dollar The dollar index is our barometer for risk, so to speak. Like I said, if the dollar is poised to rally, we are in a "Risk Off!" type of environment (pretty basic stuff). This should result in declines over EURUSD and GBPUSD. If the dollar is poised to decline, it's "Risk On!" and we can buy away euro &amp; cable. What this means is that we will have to start our analysis on a dollar index chart. Not many platforms have that, I am using a demo account on a broker for nothing but the USDX charts. I am not sure if I am allowed to refer people to it on here, so I will let you google it. USDx charts can be found on a number of web-based platforms too, I just find it handier that way. How do we tell which direction the dollar is headed? By performing some tech analysis on a daily, H4 and even hourly chart, of course! The inverse correlation between EURUSD and USDx is the strongest, since the EUR amounts for the biggest part in the basket the index is made up of, but it goes for cable and other dollar based pairs just as well. What do we look for? We look to spot KSR levels, sup/dem areas and the type of market environment the dollar is currently in. I also use the dollar index to help me tell how far price may reach in the day, but that's a bit more complicated, so I will leave it with just a mention for now.

I will stop here for now, leaving off with a trade example from this week; a 50 pip winner from monday. The stop was initially a tiny 15 pip. This is a huge advantage to this system, we look for the most precise entries so that stops are no issue. My stop size usually varies, but is never more than 20 pips. The returns can be great. edit: there is a small typo on the second text in the picture, it is supposed to say "1.2920 was marked as an important level", not 1.2929...

That was very informative for new traders like us. Thank you so much for giving us such info, free of charge. Be blessed

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Very interesting concept cant to wait to learn how to use index to trade. Thanks WDays

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Nice thread WDays, sorry but I have to ask : Is this anyhow related to ICT ?

--- 帖子 #7 ---
As much as it is based on some of his concepts. I have adapted his stuff to suit myself as a trader. Like I said, I am very deeply influenced by ICT, even though I do not personally know him or have ever been in contact with him

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Hello. I also use what I learned from ICT's videos in my trading. I used to follow him on Youtube but he is now doing mentoring and not posting any more. Such a shame! It is obvious, from the last post, that some will not be reading the posts or the underlying concepts but will only want some-one to provide signals. I trade the GBP/JPY, EUR/JPY and the USD/JPY as well as the one you mentioned. Regards.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Basically we're looking at naked chart trading, but instead of using classic price action patterns, candlestick patterns, inside bars, engulfing patterns and all that crap that works only when it does, we're basing our trades on predictive analysis. Contrary to popular belief, you CAN predict what price will do next. The idea is to show that there are signs of something being conjured up, and things happen for a reason on our charts. It is monday, so I am looking at a daily USDx chart. Let's see if we can tell anything about these highlighted lows as they relate to prior market action...?

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Which is why I am trying to structure this thread more as a written guide rather than giving away my own interpretation. ICT's stuff is gold, would be a shame if it all went to waste. I don't feel guilty when it comes to what I've done by opening this thread, because he used to encourage people who learned from him to "give back to the public" and since I have no intention of going commercial with this stuff, my conscious is clean

--- 帖子 #11 ---
By using real-time charts that are based on the futures markets we can see the liquidity voids. MT4 charts of Futures markets tend to expand the candles to draw in these areas. The $index began this week with a liquidity void. Looking at the G/$ we can see that the void has not yet been closed unlike the E/$. If we look at the Eur/Gbp we can see that the there is also a gap that has not been closed. I like to use the Eur/Gbp as well to help make predictions.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
I don't see why you would feel guilty. All the best to you.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Its developing a lower lows hence showing a bullish pattern. I also see a flag forming as well. Thats my observations

--- 帖子 #14 ---
I have FXCM 's USDollar index on one of my MT4 platforms, they are not my broker, and their candles/prices are different to yours. Mine doesn't show the nice incremental increase in price like your chart does. It is for this reason I also like to look at Tradingview charts or go to Investing.com for their chart.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Yep, good eye. It's making higher lows, which is supposed to be a sign of a bullish trend. But look closer - why did it drop and why did it stop where it did? The answer: magic!

--- 帖子 #16 ---
The charts that I use for USDx are forex ltd co uk. You can register a demo account and use the ones they provide on their metatrader.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Think of those areas as demand. The reason markets can't just keep going straight in one direction is because they need fuel. I look at things this way: The dollar started the rally roughly from 92.00; moved all the way to 95.95 and lost some of its steam. It then fell until it reached a stack of buyers piled up over at around 93.00 before thrusting up and reaching 97.55. Markets are like a pendulum. They oscillate up and down. There is nothing random here.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
To put it in context, while the dollar is rallying, the euro and pound should be declining. Like I said, magic.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Let's zone in on the highlighted area on the eurusd chart - H4 shows us exactly where to expect that turn.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hey WDays, What is the signal to put the trigger on Support / Ressistance area ?

--- 帖子 #21 ---
When you are aware of your surroundings and know what to expect, entering is easy. You have two ways you can go about it. Either you are aggressive and buy at support/sell at resistance, or you play it safe and wait for a bounce+retrace back. There are a few things to note, however. Price will rotate between three cycles: range - expansion - consolidation . I like to think of the first phase as the "accumulation" phase; during the accumulation phase, buyers or sellers will set up their positions and they'll do it slowly, without causing much noise. Once they're all set, there is a sudden volatility injection in the market and price moves from A to B. Once it reaches its point of destination, it will proceed to go sideways and consolidate, perhaps retrace a little before that. In terms of timing, we need to wait for the market to settle down. Entering while the market is in an accumulation process is simple and can be done by using a fib (could enter at the middle of the range), we could use a smaller timeframe area of supply or demand or we could wait for a fakeout and enter in the other direction. I will elaborate further as we come accross these examples in the upcoming trade week. I hope my crappy Paint diagram is clear enough.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Notice, during the accumulation phase, price action will be very choppy, volatile, going in all directions. We don't care about that. We have built a trade idea on the higher timeframes, we are confident that this market will be going up (down) today. We are bullish (bearish) and the ongoing jitter does not interest us. We hold our position with a tight stop (that is not too tight and risks getting hit) and we wait for the expansion of the range. Then we get paid.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Another component to a successful trade is to be aware of the time of day we are planning to position ourselves. Please, do not take any trades between 10 pm GMT and 4am GMT on european or american markets, as you will end up stuck in a consolidating market. The Asian session is when our major currency pairs will consolidate. Keeping in mind what we just saw in the previous post, market moves from range (accumulation) to range expansion to consolidation. This goes for all timeframes and periods. It is crucial to keep in mind the importance of timing. It is advisable to trade during the early London session, a couple of hours before the NY session and a few other sensitive times (6 am, 10 am, 12 am, 2:30-3:00 pm, 5 and 6 pm, 8 pm all GMT). Those are times of the day where you can expect to see a rise in volatility.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
more explanation please..

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Let's take usdcad, a setup from august 12th. Breaking up the trading day by time. All times are GMT+1 (CET), since that's what my broker uses. Midnight is when the new trade day starts on our platforms. Up until Frankfurt Open, I call that the Asian Session. During that time, price is steady - it just declined during the previous day, it retraced and is now consolidating in peace. We're cautious, so we don't rush in before we figure it out. We know we should expect a second bearish day, price will be going down. We have to short. Inside the highlighted box, we're going to look for a logical entry point. I suggest doing that after Frankfurt has already opened.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
One way to get a precise entry is using the fibonacci retracement tool.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
With a rather tight 15 pip stop above the top of the asian range.... This position yields almost a 4:1 reward to risk ratio with an entry from the 61.8% retracement.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
This method requires a bit of discretion because it's not your ordinary "When green crosses red up - buy, when green crosses red down - sell" type of deal. However, when we want to learn how to trade properly and more importantly consistently, we must be prepared and know what to expect once volatility kicks in. Entering is the easiest part, yet it bugs so many of the new traders. 90% of the work should be done outside of trading hours. We should focus on marking up our charts in a way that it is clear to us what exactly is going on in the market. That way, our confidence will grow to the point where entries no longer bug us. Over time, we will eventually be able to spot things before they happen and capitalize by taking the most adequate course of action during trading hours.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Speaking of time sensitivity, some trading days are in fact better than others! For instance, mondays are usually choppier and slow moving. Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday are much better in terms of trend activity. Usually the weekly candle will develop during those three days. Fridays are 50/50... Sometimes you can see good activity, sometimes they're choppy. This does not go to say that ALL mondays are bad or that all tuesdays are great. There are just bigger chances for those things to happen on their respective days.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
And here's why that happens: How does price action develop? And this goes for any candle on any timeframe. The first 20% are usually moving against the intended direction (they move counter-trend), they set a high or a low. That goes on for a reason; when momentum is weakening, it needs new fuel to move forward. This means the market will look for liquidity and attack areas of supply or demand. Once they grab hold of liquidity, they will return back to the open and start going from there. Every time the range is expanded significantly, there will be some time spent in consolidation (sort of validating the freshly conquered territory). the last 20% are reserved for a retracement and consolidation. I've tried to depict it with a diagram again...

--- 帖子 #31 ---
All in hindsight. Live examples would explain it better.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Thankyou Wdays for sharing this to help others you told"We know we should expect a second bearish day, price will be going down" how did we know we will have another bearish day? was not it possible it did go more up first in second day(i mean price goes first up until your SL and then down)?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Of course Sir. You are 100% right. This stuff is gold and each one of us take what suits us better. I liked your approach adn will follow with interest. Good job.

its called wyckoff Attached Image (click to enlarge) I had thread about wyckoff formation only: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=601278

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Here's a live example on EU for you Can we all agree that EU is bullish right now? The rally started from 1.1130, on wednesday, September 21st. The rally was exhausted 5 days later, on the 26th @ 1.1280, which in turn started a move down. The pair found new demand @ 1.1160 roughly and jumped back to 1.1250 last friday. The rally to 1.1250 was followed by an ongoing consolidation today. Within that consolidation, we look to take action.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Perfect. I took this one also. but just one entry at 1.12388. target hit.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Good job Today was a lousy day to give a live example on, but I hope we can find better ones in the upcoming days...

--- 帖子 #38 ---
I shorted euro, going against the overall trend. It's a risky trade, it could have well shot up. What gave me the confidence to act? Well first of all, the move up was capped, like I said by 1.1250. Which meant that in order for it to fight through that level, it needed some of that liquidity, resting below. This morning started with a tiny drop and formed a double bottom @ 1.12204. Keep an eye out for double bottoms like that! It's not your ordinary formation, which confirms a strong support level. A level as clear as that usually means there is liquidity resting right below. Retail orders . My analysis is further backed by what someone else mentioned earlier, the so called "Liquidity void" (which is kinda coined by ICT I think, so I'm reluctant to call it that). Naturally, the expected development was a down day. And look at USDx I was expecting it to hit the 95.68-72 area, it even overshot.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Thank you, I didn't realize it had a name But yeah, that's generally it. We look at our charts and try to figure out what market has done, so that we understand what is currently doing and finally so we can know what to expect. Today's example was probably a little too perfect in that it illustrates what I was going on about earlier. Work inside the consolidation, with a directional bias in mind. Try to sell in the upper portion of the range or buy in the lower portion. This allows for tighter stops. I have to admit, today was rather annoying, sitting through an entire day of ranging, but all is well that ends well.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Simply by building a directional bias before sitting down to trade We do most of our work outside of trading hours, remember? Regarding stops, trading is like a game. We have to think like retail traders and like market makers at the same time. Retailers are taught to place stops at the last swing low or high. What's more, people who want to buy or sell a breakout will place buy stops and sell stops above or below known highs/lows. What do you think is going to be the first thing market makers do? Stops are meant to protect our capital, not serve as target practice. With a directional bias in mind and well placed entry, you can afford to have a 10 pip stop without a care in the world.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Hello Wdays, thx for the sharing of your knowledge, I identified a small supply zone on the EUR/CAD 4H TF, the 76,4% Fib retrace comes at 1.4855, right in the supply zone. What do you think of the potential trade? http://prntscr.com/cpcedk

--- 帖子 #42 ---
You're right Since my chart is a bit different than yours, I see price already dipped into it and dropped. However, may I shed more light? The supply on its own is strong, but not strong enough. There are a few other things to factor in. If you look at your daily chart, you'll see price rallied straight into a daily supply zone over at 1.4920. What followed was a decline right into an area of demand + BRN @ 1.4650. Once there, it went back to the middle of the range (where it usually goes) to take a correctional breather. If there is a chance for the decline to continue, it will have to rally to 1.4800, hold and tumble down. Next targets down would then be the low (body) at 1.4618

--- 帖子 #43 ---
You have stopped posting on your thread?

--- 帖子 #44 ---
So you are trading only SnR + fibo retracement?

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Pretty much, yes Well I like to think of myself as trading market models but in terms of the tools that I use - those sum it up

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hello my Friend! looks like you use very similiar idea to one of my method which I use mainly on daily chart, but my question is: do you wait for some kind of a confirmation (like the market structure you write about in earlier posts) when price is at your pointed level or you going in, "blindly"? Cheers! M

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Can this system be automated?

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Thx for the feed-back, our charts are different indeed, I am using FCXM trading station NY close hours. I think if price can get up to the 1.4835 - 1.4860 zone, then I would consider a SL, it's a little conservative, but still learning S&amp;D trading

--- 帖子 #49 ---
This is a Sell Market trader order I placed earlier today, a little too early I think http://prntscr.com/cpg79m At the bottom is a big green demand zone, to be identified on the daily chart. I also marked a red box 4H supply zone and a magenta 1H supply zone, both on the right of the chart. Now I actually wonder if this zone is 'fresh' enough, reason beeing that this supply zone is actually a first test of a previous zone, left red box. So the last candle on the chart would actually be a second test and price is at the moment not really rejecting this supply zone. Or maybe we can look at it in a different way: maybe the second red supply zone is a NEW supply zone, this would make it a valable trade. What would be your thoughts? Minosd

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Going in blindly never goes well No, there are three types of entries for me - during consolidation, like yesterday, in a market reversal, in a trending market. If the market is in a consolidation range, I would use my fib on the range and try to enter in the upper portion (like yesterday). As far as market reversals go, I will wait for confirmation (price moving away from the level it reversed from and then retracing back to it). That can be done by using a fib also. Trending markets are the easiest. If we're in a bullish trend, every day price will drop, return to open, expand to the upside. I will use this post to mention another concept, that of the daily open. If we want safer setups, it is best to sell above the daily open (on down days) or to buy below the open (on up days). That said, it's not very advisable to buy way below the open, because the chances are it is a down day. Same goes for shorting when price has gone too far up.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
I'm sorry, you'd have to tell me which pair this is so I can have a look of my own.. I have never used EAs and never really trusted or liked them. I wouldn't know how you can automate a system that requires as much discretion as this one. You don't need to spend 24 hours a week trading to rake in a good amount. More trades is not the key to more success.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Remember what we talked about suspiciously clear equal lows? Practice time. Anyone who can tell me why EURUSD turned down at 1.1350 wins.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
"SUPPLY" D...

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Of course but where? How? Why?

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Forgot to mention the pair, it was AUD/JPY, and I had to take a 50 pips loss on this one

--- 帖子 #56 ---
what do you mean with turned down?

--- 帖子 #57 ---
I am eying this at the moment, it's just above the 1.1150 zone on a 1H EUR/USD chart http://prntscr.com/cpm70e

--- 帖子 #58 ---
I want a retrace back into my fib retracement, or I'm not getting in it I am short on usdcad, though. Don't look at too many pairs or else you risk becoming overwhelmed. I mean reversed the rally and dropped.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
I know what you mean, I am watching 21 pairs and I know I should cut it to 5 or so, but I just can't LOL, which pairs to choose is a difficult job. Similar to the above EUR/USD chart, here is a AUD/USD chart 30 min : 2 times similar lows at 0.7648 http://prntscr.com/cpmbp8

--- 帖子 #60 ---
This is my try: On the Daily: SUPPLY started at 24/06, very big red candle. http://prntscr.com/cpme5r On 4H we can zoom in a bit, we see that supply entered the market at 1.1350, see the turquoise line, on the 18/08 it entered this zone and topped at 1.1368 http://prntscr.com/cpmgql

--- 帖子 #61 ---
How did you place your FIB on the EUR/USD pair?

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Excellent That's exactly what I wanted to see. By going on a smaller timeframe, it's hindsight now, but expect it to hit back 1.1164. This is what I meant, when I said it's risky to buy too low below the daily open.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
In order to make sense of what's going on, we take to the USDx chart. Now I'm not saying it will, but there are strong chances dollar pops above those highs.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Looking at a daily EU chart, 1.1150 was tested. It's an important level because it doubles as a psych number and demand. I would rather not take any longs today, because any rally would be shortlived.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
My best shot for today, I entered a long EUR USD because we are in a 4H supply zone, tight stop, cross fingers ;-) http://prntscr.com/cpnjl4

--- 帖子 #66 ---
I also just entered a USD/CAD short, 30Min chart, just below supply zone, after confirmation with bearish engulfing candle http://prntscr.com/cpnoe6

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Ucad shorts tight stops, better be right on this

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Thx, would be curious to know the reasons you took the trade, from long term and short term perspective.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
The answer is within this recent price action. Markets are like a pendulum. They oscillate and you know, what goes up has got to fall The way I see it, price declined from 1.3170 and then rallied back to complete the range. It then proceeded to consolidate and this morning I woke up to see accumulation right below the level. I looked for an entry inside the range. What worries me is the dollar strength as demonstrated on the USDx chart I posted earlier... In case it manages to go beyond 96.32 it's bad news for my shorts as well as any EU longs..

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Patience is rewarded in this line of work.. now let's see it fight through that blue-marked area.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
This is what I meant when I said it completed the range and needs new fuel to keep moving. Dipped to the asian session accumulation, straight into demand (and more importantly - liquidity) and took off. Also have a look at the dollar index, it busted the highs.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
I modified my TP to yours at 1.3136 on the USD/CAD and it was almost the low...so thx for that, good trade for me On the other hand, I was stopped out on my EUR/USD trade , 10 pips lower it reversed, the problem with 2 demand zones on top of eachother, you don't know where to place your stop. Still learning, I will get better at this in the coming weeks http://prntscr.com/cpufzn

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Glad to hear it Careful though, sometimes I can get it wrong. As for EU, like I said - too far down below the daily open. Rallies were tiny up until that huge jump up at london close. It would appear you enter your trades using a H4 chart. What I'm trying to explain is how to use our higher timeframe analysis to capitalise in a short-term to intraday session. We use D1 and H4 for the purposes of our analysis, but we execute trades on one of the intraday TFs, m5, m15 even m30. There is too much information and lots of clues on m15 charts, we cannot neglect them! As far as stops go, work on getting direction right, look at the entries I've shown. Try using a 20-25 pip stop at first, with some practice, you'll narrow your stop down to as much as 7-8 pips. The beauty of this system is that at one point, you start expecting what to see and moments later see it unfold. We can predict price action with the right knowledge and some practice

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Thx for the good feed-back. Beeing able to work with stops of 7 to 8 pips would really require a good mastering of S&amp;D. But it is also my aim. What are you looking at today? I have a supply zone marked out on the NZD/USD 30 min chart: http://prnt.sc/cq16mg On the EUR AUD I see a supply zone on the 1H, start marked by Turquoise line: http://prntscr.com/cq1b9b On the EUR CHF I took a short, too early it seems, because the candle will not close as a bearish engulfing: http://prntscr.com/cq1bxd Another one that looks good on the 4H: http://prntscr.com/cq1e0l

Short EURGBP 0.88116 H1 CHART

--- 帖子 #76 ---
You're welcome for the feedback. It's nice that you are training your eyes to spot areas of supply and demand. Keep it up, and it will become second nature to you. However, don't forget that we don't just buy or sell when price gets near or inside an area of liquidity. We have to put as many odds as we can behind us, time our entry neatly, place a tight stop and reach high R:R. We start by denoting areas of sup/dem. We look for historical highs and lows that may affect in some way our bias. We look at recent price action, and by that I don't mean price action candles. The truth is PA candles on their own don't work. You can have a bearish engulfing candle and a rally within the following 2 candles. They can be a trigger to enter a position, but honestly, when we're done here, you won't need it. What we're trying to learn here is that no matter what "system" we trade, markets will always be the same. Systems, in the forexfactory sense, are synonymous to "signals", what signal we use to enter our trades is not at all important. What we want is to be able to tell where price is and where it's trying to go. We want to acquire the practice and training to know when we can enter a trade and when we'll end up losing if we do. All of that can only be done by building a proper background, using all the tools mentioned in the first post, on a higher timeframe no smaller than H4. Daily charts is where it all happens, and by that I mean where "macrotrends" are formed. The people in charge of creating trends and making price move do not care about lower timeframe noise. However we think of lower timeframes as "broken down price action", as if we zoom in to see better what goes on during the day. That way we may get a better entry on our trades, on an intraday basis... And tight stops, don't forget the tight stops

--- 帖子 #77 ---
The problem with EURGBP is that its main driver right now is GBP weakness. Cable is making record lows, and we're not sure when it will stop. We can only guess psych levels like 1.2750 or 1.2700 will hold it. It's a matter of pricing brexit in. If we go to a weekly chart, where we can see price action at those levels clearly, EURGBP is tackling the 0.8810 highs from february 2013. There are strong chances it rallies above those highs, reaching into an area of liquidty around 80 pips higher. Even then, there's no guarantee it will stop because of the aforementioned cable weakness. Throw in a "Draghi bomb" about tapering QE sooner and it will shoot up to the 2011 highs at 0.90. So 1) it's not a pair I'd risk exposure on 2) even if I would it would be after I've seen confirmation of an exhausted rally (consolidation, new accumulation) 3) I would only hope to see very shortlived declines =&gt; it is safer to buy the dips. Once again, trends are built on higher timeframe charts - H4, daily, weekly and monthly. That's my opinion, at least

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Appreciate your insight, thank you

--- 帖子 #79 ---
True, shorting the EURGBP makes me nervous, closed short for +21 pips, but looking at the week chart: 1. Fib 161.8 2. RSI divergence + MACD divergence

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Hello Wdays, it is very true I tend to watch for a level/zone and step in without consideration for whats happening with the pair...shoot in all directions and take a lot of lesser quality trades. I need to improve Below a GBP JPY short opportunity with good RR and with overal trend, this is a 1H chart, but the supply zone was marked on a 4H chart, the turquise line marks the beginning of the 1H supply zone. Downsides on this trade: we are entering asian trading hours and the zone was tested twice before... 1H: http://prntscr.com/cqabv5 4H: http://prntscr.com/cqaecu

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Great, I can showcase another way to enter in a different market type. Consolidation from tuesday's rally extended throughout the entire session yesterday. It picked up today, with euro and cable moving down. What followed was a retrace back to a supply area in the asian session, which is an opportunity for us to capitalize on the move down.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Same thing on Cable, but with choppier PA.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
I missed the gbp jpy by 3 pips at 132.10, sad because i moved it from 132.07 to 132.10. http://prntscr.com/cqh65o

--- 帖子 #84 ---
When we're looking for entries, it is best to play it safe. Here's the thing, the area between the wick of the candle and the body is where the supply or demand is at. Most times it will reach the body. Now that we know how to pinpoint those areas, it is time to start narrowing down the area of likely reversal. Also, once you've created your trade idea, zoom down to a smaller timeframe, which you have. Go to M15 also, check out the smaller picture.

Nice Thread WDays keep it up

Thank you for the support Cable hit TP, +30

Some more insight on the method: We don't want to be in every single trade on every single currency pair at any given moment. What we do is planned, strategic, surgical strikes. We enter, take our profit and leave. It's simple math really. A couple of 30 pip trades, short and sweet, per week will yield 240 pips per month. At 2% risk, this can mean doubling our account equity every few months. Every 100 pips is roughly 10% to me

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Depending on how confident I am at the time, I will use varying ranges as the background of my trade. Sometimes I will look for smaller ranges, which are safer, in case I notice that the trend is strong, I will zoom out and use a larger range. In this case, the difference was pretty insignificant so I decided to play it safe. Segmenting price into various ranges is very helpful, and I strongly advise doing it until our eyes get used to it.

EU short, entered inside the range as shown on the chart. I may close once it gets inside the highlighted area below.

Beautiful entry on gbp usd, I understand consolidation during Asian hours (in a pair with the trend?) and enter on smaller times frames after a small reversal in a S&amp;D zone with fib.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Nice :-), you need a lot of confidence in your method to trade with such high leverage. Mine is much lower at the moment, trading almost without leverage.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
That is a really interesting way of looking at the price, why are smaller ranges safer? ALso, do you modify your lot size when you trade higher TF with bigger TP?

--- 帖子 #93 ---
If you think about it, price is always traded within a certain range. Sort of like russian puppets. When I set my SL and TP, I was looking at the small range, and I was worried price would not go beyond it, evidently I was wrong and it went another 70 pips lower than my exit, but it could have well reversed. That's why I said I played it safe I trade intraday 99% of the time, every order I have, I try to close within the end of the day or even before or around 5 pm gmt. If I were to leave a position running, my risk parameters don't change, because my entry will have been based on what we're seeing in this thread and my stops would be tight enough. I rarely do that, though. Why is my leverage high? My stop amounts for around 20 pips, which is my 2%. 5 times that, you get 100 pips and 10%

--- 帖子 #94 ---
it's a good thing to have the confidence to use the leverage we have in fx

--- 帖子 #95 ---
No matter how much confidence you have, it's never wise to overleverage. No more than 2% risk per trade!

Hello Wdays, I missed the GBP JPY today, but I took a USD CAD Buy after I saw price rocket from 1.3180 to 1.3150 in less then 2 hours; Price was entering a zupply zone on the 4H : http://prntscr.com/cqnysp (just for info) I drew the demand zone (green square) based on 1H price action: http://prntscr.com/cqny2g Then I zoomed in on the 30 min chart to determine the entry, now I entered with Buy Limit and did not wait for price action confirmation. The blue line is were I think demand overcame supply, so I placed my limit 2 pips aboce, the low come in 1 pip below my BL, I was lucky here: http://prntscr.com/cqnzyj So it's all positive, BUT the RR was not reallt good, a 20 pips stop here for a 30 pips profit. At the moment price is re-entering supply zone , so I closed the trade, also we are nearing Asian tradin hours. Zoomed out you can see price was entering a zupply zone, drew on 4H : http://prntscr.com/cqnysp

Dear "threadstarter" what is your name? ; ) I think I know more people even here in FF who trade similiar method.. ; ) but that is no matter. I have a one simple question how do you know which one SR is ok? I understand "space" between SR and retracing price is very important but do you always search for SR and entry after asian session? search there for SR? For example you open the charts in the morning and...? what is most important? daily-&gt;4h-&gt; asian session ? and last question, what is the entry confirmation? Thank your reply in advance!

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Perfect! You're getting the hangs of it ) Just one thing, that area you marked as supply on your H4 chart is not necessarily supply. This is what it should look like. And be careful, on USDCAD supply levels come from a daily chart on two occasions. What's more, CAD is very much correlated with Oil. So often times you'll see it behaving in a more specific way in terms of breaking out, because of that correlation.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Hey I'm Alex. It's possible, a lot of people trade the core of what I do, but you'll find this method is different in a lot of ways. Like for instance, our ability to predict future PA To answer your questions, I will refer you back to my first post. We start by marking out areas of interest on our charts. Starting with the historical levels, because they are the easiest to spot. Have a look at any daily chart, and note the key reversal points (levels, at which price stopped in its tracks and turned the other way). We're interested in the bodies of the candles, so the close and open of the candles this specifically took place. When price runs to those places, we know something interesting will happen. Either it will be a reversal or momentum picking up due to all the orders piled up above and below such a level. We then move onto most recent price action, and look for supply and demand areas, as shown in prior posts. Those areas will turn market direction around. So now we've spotted key levels, areas with their respective supply and demand (sellers or buyers waiting to short or long the market), what do we do? We check to see if we can find similar traces on our correlated instruments. When it comes to EU and GU, we turn to the USDx. Now a thing to remember is, the correlation is inverse, meaning that when dollar rallies, euro and cable will decline and vice versa. How do we know if a level will hold or break? Well if we see a level that is holding on the EU, but USDx has a clear path ahead, then it's likely the EU will break out. If we see a strong level or area on our USDx chart, and one on EU, then the likelihood of a reversal increases. If the dollar breaks the level, then so will EU/GU etc. As far as what's most important, nothing is most or least important. Everything is important. Trading is a mix of good preparation (sound analysis before every session), patience and money management. Daily/H4 and the Asian session are two different things, one does not exclude the other. We prepare for our sessions using the higher timeframes, because we cannot tell what market makers want to achieve just by looking at the smaller timeframe charts (because they are essentially noise). We cannot hope to get a good entry, with a tight stop using just our high timeframe charts, so we need to go back and forth from high to low timeframe. The asian session is usually a time where markets consolidate, the price action that follows the asian session (for me it's between frankfurt open and london open, or slightly after that) can give us a proper entry, which will most of the time be the high or low of the day. Ideally, we want to enter our shorts above the daily open and our longs below the daily open. Our entry confirmation is our ability to properly assess if a market will be rallying or declining, simple as that When I have my bias, I am confident that I am right. I will therefore move into position during certain market phases (mostly when it is moving sideways, or accumulating as we saw in previous posts). I will then give it enough time to unfold.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
+60 for the day over two positions, it's as simple as that. So far, we've seen two types of entries. First one was the entry during consolidation with a bias based on sound analysis of the market. The second one was in a more dynamic market environment, when there is increased volatility, and consolidations don't last as long, where price will most often dip back into an area of supply or demand before resuming on its way. A few more left, hopefully we will see examples in the near future.

I am so sad I did not hold that position 700 pips in a matter of seconds...

Hi Alex, Thanks for the great info in this thread and for all your efforts. I have a question regarding how to draw supply and demand zones. You have shown in one chart of the first page that these zones should be drawn along the last opposite candle of a reversal. Later I see you draw them from close to high (demand) and in page 5 from wick (low) to open (supply). Please could you clarify? Mostafa

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Firstly, I wanted to thank you for your time to explain that, I must say thats a real essey... so the real SR must be on daily chart for the start. How far do you search for such level in the past? Regarding test of that highest/lowest candle before move. I understand your meaning the firstly you wait for candle to test that level. Which is the signal ? the candle wick touch and didnt close above or...? Thank you again in advance Alex, nice to know you I am Mike

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Remember what we said about those clean daily lows?

--- 帖子 #105 ---
One last thing about this trade, I looked indeed at the correlation between Oil and USD CAD, USD CAD was rallying while oil was up strong on the day, normally the correlation works the other way, so I was thinking if OIL goes up this is positive for CAD and USD CAD should go down, meaning the forces after the USD CAD bull rally were very strong... Could you explain on higher time frames how you spot your supply and demand zones? It seems there are different ways to do it...I took my method from the following site http://www.forexmentoronline.com/the...trading-guide/ , this is someone that was taught by Sam Seiden, so I think this is more the Sam Seiden way of doing it (although I never went on his website) It would be great to have some more examples from your charts to learn your way of spotting supply and demand, many thanks.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Was this EUR/USD trade the one you opened yesterday?

--- 帖子 #107 ---
I started off drawing everybody's attention to the last candle of opposite color before a rally or decline, which is a good start. We want as much precision as possible, so I am now narrowing down the sensitive area to the wick to body zone of that same candle. 99% of the time it will be the body, but there will be occasions where price will just tag the wick and turn around. It will eventually drop back down to the body, though. When we are in a trade, since we want to preserve our profits, we will target whatever comes first as a possible sup/dem area, so the wick. That way we can't mess up and miss taking profit. Yes, I just had to go out and left it. There are SR on every single tf. We will, on occasion use an hourly KSR. The idea is to just note the levels that stick out. As far as entries go, I will usually enter on the touch of a level, so no candlestick confirmation at all. It's the level that counts!

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Hallo Alex, a very good thread. I've worked through the tutorial videos of ICT, they're good, but for me it was hard to extract the really important informations. They are usually very long and detailed. I thank you for your work here. I will follow your contributions to my great interest.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Am I right? Attached Image (click to enlarge) It is EURCAD different pair but the idea should be same (now blowed out up)

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Yes, that's the idea. Very nice

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Since there are US payrolls in about an hour, we don't want to have any exposure going. Sometimes we can use NFP as a driver for our positions, but most of the time it's a gamble. I STRONGLY ADVISE WE STAY FLAT DURING THE PAYROLLS. However, since the dollar is rallying, I will suppose that it is reaching for the 97.40 range completion. On euro, this relates as 1.1080. My "bet" is, NFPs will bring the euro down to 1.1080... Please, do not consider this as trading advice, do not enter any EU shorts based on this. It is simply for fun . I will also narrow it down and say it will whipsaw into a quick jab to 1.1150 before it goes down.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Only a small decline within range so far..

--- 帖子 #113 ---
I got it now. Thanks again

--- 帖子 #114 ---
So you would enter blindly at such level at the point? or wait there and see the PA?

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Yes, sometimes I'll use limit orders, sometimes I'll just wait for price to reach these levels and act on market price. I don't have any specific signal to tell me to buy or sell. Don't really need one, when you're picking highs and lows.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Hi I've been trading just a few months now, and I think your system is how I've basically been approaching trading, though I haven't been able to clarify it as clearly. Nonetheless I'd appreciate you reviewing my analysis to see if I'm interpreting the price action according to your system. Starting with a daily chart of the dollar index https://www.tradingview.com/x/BGfpqp7u/ 1. Lower supply area identified as 93.00-93.48 2. Upper demand area identified as 96.90-97.54 3. Price making higher lows and just broke through a resistance line. Bullish bias 4. Fib retracement between 93.00 and 97.54 drawn. Noteworthy price between 78.6% and 61% is 96.25. So I'm expecting the US Dollar Price is to fall slightly before rebounding up. So my bias on the EURUSD is bullish. From the daily chart of the EURUSD: https://www.tradingview.com/x/UlxeaBbF/ 1. Lower supply zone identified as 1.0950-1.1143 2. Upper demand zone identified as 1.1283-1.1362 3. Price been forming lower highs while bouncing off a resistance line, suggesting bearish trend 4. Fib retracement between 1.0950 and 1.1362 drawn. Noteworthy price between 78.6% and 61% is 1.1215. So I'm expected the EURUSD to rise before continuing downwards My Trade plan for next week Pair: EURUSD Entry: 1.1215 Stop: 1.1235 Limit: 1. 1185 Does this make sense?

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Good job on the thorough analysis! ) I explained in a previous post why EU made a lower low. I was expecting it to drop straight down to 1.1080, but it seems there's still some bullishness. What's more, those payroll numbers surprised me, since I was expecting better results pre-election. USDx and EU found supply and demand respectively inside an H4 area, never reached the top /bottom/ of the range. I agree with you, that the rally would be rather short and sweet, and price would resume its downtrend. As for the entry, it's nice to have a trade idea built during the weekend, however a lot can change between sunday open and Tuesday open.

Here is my little analysis on the EUR USD, I think we are still range trading with a slicht bearish bias http://prntscr.com/crqaz0 On a higher Time frame I see the ranges getting smaller, at some point it will break out of the wedge that is forming. I would also be carefull with short because on the daily you can see a big bullish candle from support. http://prntscr.com/crqc7o

Hi Alex. Thank you for sharing your trading method. English is not my mother tongue and I'm trying to figure something out floor plan. I'm re-reading several times your posts. I hope in a while to be able to understand how to do. What changes do you trade?

--- 帖子 #122 ---
1.1080 low got taken, like we said. Bearish until 1.1020. Now do you see why I don't trust candlestick patterns?

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Dollar completes the range, retraces are probable. Highlighted area above is the next target.

Hi I'm sorry, what do you mean what changes do I trade?

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Excuse my English. I mean what do cross trading.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Oh I trade majors with an emphasis on EU, GU and sometimes USD/CAD. I don't like monitoring too many pairs, and I like the ones that are closely correlated with the USDX, since I use it a lot in my analysis. Also, right now I try to stay off cable because of the GBP flash crash last week.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Thank you very much. the swift response. So if I understand it to D1 we identify key levels where the price has turned sharply. Then there are the areas of demand and supply. Which are represented by the last candle before reversing the trend. it's correct? I is not clear, however, the difference between the supply and demand levels, and key area, since both are of trend reversal zones.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
You've got it right KSR may have been an area of supply or demand way back in time. It may have also been a swift fundamental turn. The big difference between Sup/Dem and KSR is thаt the first relate to nearest price action, while KSR may be taken further back.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
So let the key levels on H4 and D1 instead of the supply / demand areas of lower time frame?

--- 帖子 #130 ---
No, it's like this: The first level, we see price reacts to it and we have to assume it is a level of resistance for whatever reason. If we scroll back on our charts, we might spot an area of supply, it may have also been just a fundamental reason (like an agreement between central banks not to allow the pair above or below a certain level) etc. The important thing is, price is sensitive around that level. The second one we look to in a shorter term in order to find a probable reversal area. We may find both key support/resistance levels and areas of supply/demand on our lower timeframe charts. In fact, we look for them in order to frame trade ideas with more precision.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
In this last image I understand the key level of resistance but I can not understand the question lievllo. Why you have not used this area that I designed? P.S. sorry for the many questions but I am trying to do my best. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Hi Wday, Your strategy is interesting. Thanks for sharing . I understand the KSR and SUP/DEM part. But i don't get how you identify the market is in accumulation ?. Could you please give me more examples when you have time. I see you mark the levels on higher timeframe(i.e Daily and H4) and wait for entry in 15mins. am i right? Regards, Vijai

--- 帖子 #133 ---
It sounds easy, but it takes a long time to become good ...

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Accumulation is easy to identify. Every large move (trend) is followed by consolidation (range), which in turn becomes a new accumulation phase. The concept is based on the premise that the market moves from range to expansion to consolidation. Accumulation is essentially price not going anywhere, staying within a range. It then gets unstable and starts breaking up and down (faking). We try to short at the top of the range and long at the bottom, in order to afford tight stops. The direction we enter (buy or sell) is based on higher timeframe analysis. So this answers your second question, we use H4 and Daily to determine the overall market sentiment. Whether we're expecting a bullish or bearish close. We combine that with correlated pair analysis, and we thus build our bias (sentiment). Our entries are timed on M15 or M5 (no smaller than M5), because that is where price action is broken down. We have a more detailed, zoomed-in view of the market, and this allows us to obtain maximum precision and tight stops, ergo to avoid that nasty Drawdown. With this method, I have very little drawdown, no more than 10-12 pips.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
You can, but what good will it do? We want to see the closest levels of interest around current market price. Today, the closest level was the one I marked. However, as you can see, there was a reaction at the level you have drawn, so you basically answered your own question. To trade the rally that followed the highlighted area, we take into account that area there.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Notice the wicks overshot the line I have marked up there? This is why we scale down to smaller timeframes, in order to take our trades. It's like "Inception", there are areas within the areas. First picture is that of H4, price is a broken down in smaller pieces: we see the area becomes smaller. On the second picture, we are looking at an hourly chart of the same area, with a further enhanced entry. Notice the precision of this method

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Furthermore, if you missed the initial entry as shown on the chart above, have a look at this: An entry at the 78.6 retracement will get you barely 11 pips drawdown. So a standard 20 pip SL will be okay, for a 240 pip rally. I personally would probably never hold for the entirety of the trend, having to hold my position through all the retracements that followed, but if you want to trade longer term, this is how you do it

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Hey Mate! that is best info about this method from the begining. I understand the concept but I have a question regarding space between signal candle (daily TF) and retrace back to that entry point. Is it said that it should be some days before price hit the spot again? What if price retrace on the next day after bullish big candle? is it still ok for buy or not? Thank you in advance - attached pic Attached Image (click to enlarge)

minosd - This is FOREX.. there is nothing guaranteed ; ) PS Personally I think - firstly - did u looked at daily at that point? Second thing is that if you looked backward you would see chopping price action (from 5th to 11th) and that was a fakey breakout. This is only my point..

--- 帖子 #144 ---
As called. And once again, like russian puppets

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Those exotic pairs are highly volatile. Look at price action to your left. We have a range completion at 1.5646, and another range at 1.5730 to which the rally extended. Once it reached that, and having broken an important mid-term high, it was bound to pullback. What's more, in the most recent price action, we have a very sharp market rally, leaving an area of "liquidity void" as we mentioned it in an earlier post. Now I am now familiar with EUR/NZD fundamentals, but unless it has a very heavy driver, the rally cannot go on before it covers that. So I would expect a deeper pullback. Lastly, we advise to take entries on smaller timeframes, just placing an order on a supply/demand level is not enough. In a word, the pair was wayyy too overbought.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
I haven't traded these days, because I've been super busy with other things, I will once I find the time again... As far as how to trade it, I will use hindsight to show a couple of possible ways to go about it, just for the sake of giving an example, if it helps... Frankly, with our bias in mind how we enter doesn't matter, so long as we don't enter as it's falling or too late in the london session. We want to capture as much of the daily range as possible.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Excellent analysis on the EurUsd. Well done.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Like Michaelion said: too much sideways action before the demand level was created, also trend on Daily is down...for a bigger retrace there is the demand level below, but I am not sure to take this given the downtrend. Also the BL was triggered during Asion hours, learned a lot from this trade...

Alex, regarding "entry candle" how we should do if there is two or more candles which could be "entry", is there is some additional rule for inbars or outside bars? hard to say which one is best... Some EU buy setup..? [attach]2039338[/attach

No worries I don't trade ICT's methods I have heard some good things about him and some bad things . He was challenged recently to trade against another trader and all accounts were scrutinised by someone independent when it came to the end of the challenge ICT failed to provide his account the other trader did. Make what you will from that. I do have a problem with people who claim to be successful then start mentoring it doesn't seem right to me .

Yes there are , I don't know about you or anyone on her but since post Brexit trading has been terrible , PA seems to be redundant I use Dante's methods who is a real gent but even he is struggling, so was interested in this thread and to see if anyone is doing well, I haven't come on here for years .

--- 帖子 #158 ---
There isn't an exact trigger, like I said. We look for levels, take trades at or near them. You can use any trigger signal you want, if inbars or outside bars is your thing - by all means, use that. It won't make a difference, since you're trading with the trend and more importantly with the smart money This is kind of hard to grasp at first, but eventually it gets easier.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Sat in front of my charts a bit late, missed the drop to the previously shown level, so tried to enter on a retracement. It went for a second test before it shot up, unfortunately it never made it to my 30 pip TP and turned after 22 pips. I usually lock breakeven after 20 pips in the green. The end result was this... (2 day old trade, first time I can sit in front of my terminal in a few days...)

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Well EU reached the target we called, what's next? I'm looking at a dollar chart right now aaaand... Price reached some supply which caused it to turn today, however it may still go to 98.63, where another juicy supply area is waiting. Now, personally I think we may see some bearishness going into next week, leaving that level intact for now... Downside levels I'm eyeing for sensitivity: 97.39 as a recently broken high; the 96.40 area used to be resistance, holding the dollar at bay, but once it was broken, it was retested and held as support; below that we'll just have to see... On the fundamental side, the dollar doesn't really have a strong reason to decline... All eyes are on a possible federal rate hike for the 2nd time this year, so every drop is a possible long entry in the long term. The dollar is however very overbought what with recent price action, and it will need a breather before it keeps on going.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
As far as the EU and GU go... I don't think EU should rally much above 1.1150, there is still one more low in recent price action that needs taking out, so after a correctional wave, I expect to see that gone just as USDx hits the 98.63 level. GU is still bad, moving in circles, so I'm not really trading that right now.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
U/cad is my baby right now. Since it's failed to stay above the range ( &gt; 1.3275): I kind of want to see it drop to 1.2930ish before it resumes any rally into the wider range above.

Hi Wdays I was wondering what R to value you use ? Thx

--- 帖子 #171 ---
It's not fixed, so it varies. I use a stop no bigger than 20 pips (2%) for a TP no smaller than 30 pips. Most often it's 2:1 with a 15 pip stop - 30 pip tp. I will however sometimes hold on longer and achieve higher RR.

--- 帖子 #172 ---

Starting to feel uncomfortable with this PA. Bears are clawing at the door. Very likely to end up as a loss, and may look for a way out of it before that happens. I was expecting EU to break, unfortunately it didn't. Dollar halted also.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
This is what I'm hoping to see.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Hi WHD I still don't understand why you put the line on the top and not the bottom of the dollar candle on the last bar down before the move up shouldn't it at the bottom where liquidity is ?

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Liquidity is within the open and 50% of the body, when we're talking supply/demand. KSR levels is where we look at wicks, closes and opens etc.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Hi on another not people are 70% long the GBP that's probably it isn't going up.

The markets are just very bad since the UK Brexit vote , scalpers have been doing fine but swing traders have been smashed.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
I am looking at the same target. https://www.tradingview.com/x/XsZFbKaE/ I'm expecting the USDx to reverse at the level and begin climbing again. As such, I'm also looking for the EURUSD to reverse soon, so I'm awaiting a sell signal.

W Days, how do you see the market today?

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Break to 97.30 is possible today but not 100% likely... GU capped by consolidation range, EU is still correcting from the decline...

--- 帖子 #189 ---
GU breaks out on brexit fear-relief, took stops out at the 2300 RN, it could present a good long opportunity by the end of the day, target is 1.2340 for now.

what broker that have usd index chart?

--- 帖子 #192 ---
WDAYS I have been watching patiently and I have come to the conclusion there seems to be no value in watching the dollar chart , it is to far weighted to the euro , so even if you get a daily bias correct that will be for the euro and by then the movement is already factored in to the price. Secondly it is hard to predict using S&amp;R on one pair let alone 2 pairs . Your method is that you judge the level where the dollar index is and determine the bias, then you look at the other pair and determine the level. In fact you have get both levels right before inviting a trade. I asked earlier about your win ratio but you never stated , I am curious how long you have been using this method and how many winners you have had you should be able to say how much your account size has increased. Thank you .

--- 帖子 #193 ---
The fact that you did not understand how to implement USDx analysis into trading does most definitely not mean that it does not work. It may not be your fault, I may have been vague about it. No matter how weighed the euro is, once the USDx begins to move - all dollar related major pairs will do so as well. You have to understand that the EURUSD is the most traded pair in terms of volume. The liquidity is several times more than say GBPUSD. It is not harder to predict using two pairs, on the contrary - it's the only way to do it. Correlation has a crucial role in market analysis, and as far as indexes go it's Finance 101. We do not look at USDx separately from the other pairs, we work together with our currency pairs and the dollar index. We look for a trend &amp; key levels on the USDx, on the EU and cable. We look for any divergences between the three - has the dollar came to a halt at a level, while EU and GU are clear? Is it the other way around? That is why dollar is king in - if the index is halted, EU/GU will most likely stop in their tracks also. If the USDx is clear - expect a breakout on EU/GU. Nobody ever said trading was easy, it takes a lot to build a bias alone and it's hard to learn to do it properly from a forum where anybody can post any nonsense they see fit. When you do it for some time, you get used to it and begin to see things quicker. I am sorry this thread doesn't offer what you appear to be looking for, I will not give you a flashy, colorful "when this crosses that" type of signal system, mostly because I think that's BS. I'm trying to pass on tips &amp; clues I've acquired over my 3 years of naked-chart trading. As you can see from my prior posts, I can be pretty accurate when it comes to prediction, so obviously it works and obviously it won't work within a week of practice, while looking for all the wrong things Take it or leave it, I'm not forcing you to follow. As for my winners, seeing as I am not trying to sell anything or make a profit from this thread, I find it offensive that you would even ask me that. I do alright. The minimum return on my equity is 10% and that's on a bad month. Usually it's around 25-30%, so you do the math.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Or you could use Tradingview like some of the people on here.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Wdays sorry if you feel I asking about your equity curve was offensive but probably everyone on here would want to know that as it would be slightly pointless learning something that is a negative . The other issue and this might be me why don't you trade other dollar pairs kiwi and alike ?. I might be a bit confused with your process on trading as I said it's a bit spread out , you do mention somewhere on times to trade but it's never mentioned again . I have been trading a while using PA and patterns did really well last year and before but this year has been atrocious know one seems to be doing anything even prop traders have lost money so hence some scepticism if you could explain the whole process that would be definitely appreciated.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Here's my view of today's USDx. It looks to me like it's ranging. In a case like this, we'd also expect the EURUSD to be ranging correct? https://www.tradingview.com/x/XWqQnodp/

--- 帖子 #198 ---
If the USDx were ranging, then yes, no clear direction on foreign currencies. In our case, USDx has rallied and is sitting at supply around 98.00, with potential to break higher. We said, last friday, that there would be some minor corective bearishness in the beginning of the week. Said correction turned into what appears to be a consolidation. We know that what follows consolidation is accumulation, so we expect a range expansion soon.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
I would not post something that is negative I don't trade Kiwi and aussie because they tend to move a lot while I'm asleep, ranging thru the day (Sydney open @ midnight my time, NZ an hour before that I believe). I would, but honestly 3 pairs is already enough. Even just EU/GU is okay. I don't trade jpy pairs for the same reason and because they're far too volatile and ergo risky. I have of course traded every single pair out there, there was a time I had a whole bunch of exotic crosses, but that just isn't necessary. Like I said, I trade at 2% risk at most (using a 20 pip SL), so 2% = 20 pips. If we net 60 pips/week (or 2x30 pips) that's 240 pips for the month, which translates to roughly 25%. You can most certainly achieve that just by looking at 2-3 pairs. Hell, you can even do it using one pair. Makes sense? I'll try to sum up the entire process in "steps" a bit later on, you're right that I only touched on the subject of timing. I'll say a little bit more about that before I get to the entire process as a whole.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
A recap on higher timeframe analysis (or in other words, our preparation work): Using our higher timeframes, we try to determine a bias. To do that, and starting on a daily chart, we look left to see where price has been, denote key levels, mark supply &amp; demand zones in our most recent price action. To determine the trend: we want to see price make Higher Highs, Higher Lows in a rally; lower lows, lower highs in a decline - pretty basic stuff. What's more, we want to see resistance being broken and support holding in a rally and vice versa in a decline. That's how we gauge market direction! Once we're done with our daily chart, we zoom in to a H4 chart to break up price action further. Again, we look for the same things, except our focus will now be mostly on supply/demand areas in recent price action. All of this is done on USDx, EURUSD, GBPUSD which are the pairs that I advise people to focus trading on . We then take to comparing the three. Since USD is the common denominator, we want to see rallying on the dollar and declines in EU and GU or the other way around. We will look for levels that match - is there a supply zone on EU yet none on GU &amp; no demand on USDx? Chances are that supply zone will be disregarded. We take note of all those things and we've already got a good idea what market will do next. Hopefully, we will know if the market will be rallying or declining in the session. Now, I advise you to do this on your time off and not during trading hours. It will be hard to cope &amp; focus with price moving all over the place.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Timing explained: Obviously, when we're trying to make money off trading, we want to capture those times of the day, when there will be momentum to bring price from A to B. As it relates to the dollar (specifically EU, GU), we have to take note of a few windows of opportunity, when there would be enough liquidity for the daily range to develop. Price won't move straight up or straight down like we've already said so many times on here. The daily open is at midnight, yet for me, there are 2 sessions: morning session &amp; afternoon session. The morning session starts at 6 am GMT+2 and ends around 1pm GMT+2. It coincides with Frankfurt open, London open, Tokyo and Sydney close. There is hence a lot of momentum during that time. Usually, after 6am the high of the day (HOD) or the low of the day (LOD) is set. Sometimes it takes a very short while, sometimes it can extend past London open, but no later than 1pm GMT+2. Naturally, we want to trade away from the HOD or LOD. I posted a diagram earlier with the daily range and it how it looks on intraday timeframes and I said we want to be buying below the daily open and selling above the daily open. As for the Asian session, I keep an indicator to denote it simply because I use it for my morning entries, I will often look for a return inside the asian range. There are small-TF supply and demand areas within it. The Asian Range goes from midnight to Frankfurt open for me. Now, regarding the second session I said, it's the afternoon session. It goes from 2pm to roughly 7pm GMT+2. Usually, that's the window where we get all the US data, we have New York open at 4:30 pm GMT+2, we have sensitivity an hour before that, euros coming back from lunch around the beginning of the window etc. In a nutshell, there will be momentum here again. Now what will happen on most days is, price will set a HOD or LOD in the first session, travel from A to B and go into consolidation when it ends at 1om. Slowly, it will begin to move countertrend and at around 3 o'clock in the afternoon it will resume the London direction. So in my book, that's a trend continuation. HOWEVER, and this is why it's important to have good awareness, the afternoon session may be a reversal if price has traveled to a key level during the morning session. In that case, we want to take profit before that happens. Usually, the daily range will be fulfilled by 7-8 pm GMT+2, and it will pull back slightly from there. At 10pm, there is usually a small return back to the original direction and midnight is the start of the new day.

As I add new theory, I will add a link to it in the initial post. That way it's all systemized in one place.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
OK understood thanks.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
On the EURUSD today I saw a lot of movement that I'm attributing to comments from Draghi. How do you normally factor in the effect of the news releases and speeches in your analysis? Do you give any consideration to them. For example, do you redo your analysis with them in mind or do you maintain your bias even if they cause a reverse in the trend.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Great thanks Wdays for that explanation , now I was wondering if you also look at gold , Silver and bunds and T Bills ? And would the Norwegian Krona or SEK work as well ?

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Do you think analysis of the Treasury Yields can add value to this system?

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Usually I disregard HIN, because I think of it as liquidity injection for price to reach its destination. However, there are exceptions - I hate having exposure during Draghi, usually choppy as hell; Fed is pretty dangerous too, and NFP are 50/50. I like GBP releases best because they tend to whipsaw the least. So in a word, I maintain my bias of where price is headed and I expect the news to drive markets rather than cause mayhem...with the exception of ECB/Fed and sometimes payrolls.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
I'm not big on commodities. I don't trade them at all if that's what you mean. As far as using them for analysis goes, I'd say meh... Don't really need to monitor them. I used to use a lot of T-notes and Bunds to try to determine possible shifts in monetary policy that can cause a ruckus, but I gradually started doing it less and less. I do use COT charts, though. That's commitment of traders. They help me back my analysis by having a look at the fundamental side. They are limited to the US, but still a very good compass. I have never traded the Krona, I see a lot of big fund traders do, especially ones at Saxobank. I don't favor it at all. If the method works on there too? Sure it does, it goes for all instruments, including indices and commodities.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Sure they can, it's just a matter of keeping it simple for me. Also there is no point in checking them every single day, once a month is okay in my book. ICT has been talking about the "trinity of yields" and it goes a little something like this: We use a trio of major yields - US Bonds, UK, and the German Bund. We want to see if they're confirming (moving in tandem) or diverging. If one of them is divergent, then we can expect something of a trend shift, and the rest will usually follow. Secondly, we want to see if they're moving up or down. Yields going up means that currencies will be going up. Illustration below. 2nd chart is Bund declining, which gives us a bearish outlook on euro. Oh and you can get those charts at http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GDBR5:IND and you have to add GUKG5:IND &amp; USGG5YR:IND for the first chart

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Since there were questions on news releases and trading... During the Draghi conference, euro whipsawed up before dropping like a hammer. Where did the move up get cut? That's right, into an H4 supply area that we had marked previously in one of the posts above I believe. It took out a recent lower swing high, dipped into the liquidity pool and dropped. Since this is ECB press conf and I said I don't trust it, naturally I didn't risk a short... Not that I was in front of my computers at the time either.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
And before you go "hindsight", the break of the 1.0970 low was called As well as the 98.63 mark on USDx Time to plan ahead of the new trade week I'd love to see other people's analysis posted on here before I post mine.

You CAN predict markets, anyone who says otherwise has no idea what they're talking about.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Hi much appreciated it will take a bit of time to grasp some of the stuff it's pretty similar to price action but without inside bars spinning tops etc etc . Do you trade for a living or part time ? Also are you using a broker or spread firm ? One thing I do use is a 200 day moving average to add a bit of confluence I have been told a lot of big banks use it but I have also been told most the banks financial teams don't trade forex anymore they trade bunds ....

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Candlestick patterns cannot be trusted on their own, everybody who teaches trading with candle patterns emphasizes on the fact that we are supposed to only take them at certain levels (support/resistance). I like to think I trade part time, being involved in projects outside of finance, but trading represents a big part of my income. I use a broker, local one but saxo-backed. I have used FXDD in the past. It's just a matter of easier fund depositing/withdrawing. I used MAs in the past, mostly as dynamic S/R. It's not consistent for me, just like trendlines aren't. In the end, it's not a moving average that is relative, it's the level the MA coincides at. So think BRN, historical levels, Supply &amp; Demand. It's not true that financial teams don't trade forex anymore, if it were markets would be idle, lol. If anything, it's the other way around. Forex is slowly becoming the only sensible instrument, worth trading mainly because of the contracted risk appetite in regards to any other security.. So they do trade it heavily, only the rules changed over the years. Ranges are smaller nowadays, much more consolidation than trending and so on.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Hi have a listen with latest guy on chat with traders he's full time and trades the bund and also the DAX but his primary is the bund for liquidity if you ever viewed a ladder you will see the volume going through on the bund . He tells you why he stopped trading forex , I do know a lot of traders who trade the Bund as their primary market using volume profile but you really need to be full time to do that. I do like the 200ma on the weekley. I agree with candlesticks you can't just use them. What do you think about patterns in Head and shoulders , flag etc etc ..

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Hi WD Thanks for this wonderful thread. I have been following it and trying to get my head around what you have been saying, until I realised unless I actually post what I think I won't know if I'm right. My thoughts for well today at least are that the USDx will struggle to the 100 mark. I trade the EURAUD and I don't think it is going to break the resistance area it has been flirting with. I have attached (hopefully) 3 pictures. 1) the USDx 2) the current EURAUD coming up to the resistance area (brown lines) 3) last weeks EURAUD and it's love for that area. Thanks

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Hopefully this is the 3rd picture.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Slow monday scalps... 12+5 so far

--- 帖子 #219 ---
The 100 mark so far is the record high. It's gonna take a lot for it to make it there. 99.60 is up next in terms of upside target. But it's high time we see a deeper pullback after the march highs were taken out. You were right, EA didn't break resistance, however I'm thinking it will just by eyeballing. It's ranging right now, in a pretty wide range that is common for EA. There is liquidity above the last swing high, it should get taken out at some point soon. Right now I'm more bearish on euro crosses than anything else, even though they're choppy and slow.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
As far as the USDx, this is what I'm seeing for today...

Hi WD I having a problem with KSR and supply areas , you state on KSR the lines should be on the body of the candle not the wicks but on a lot of your charts it's the wicks, also you state that the supply is between the wick and bod but on some charts you colour the whole candle . Can you show me please some examples . Also bit confused on time frames is it daily hourly and 15min as some you have 4 HR . Thx

--- 帖子 #224 ---
With KSR, I use the bodies because it's a safer bet. Sometimes the wicks will be important, but I feel better not taking chances while trading and limiting myself to looking just at the bodies. As for supply/demand, be careful not to mistake "target" areas and supply/demand areas. On my last screenshot, it was a target area - between the midpoint and 78.6% fibo retracement. I use H4-D1 for analysis, and I look to m15-m5 for execution. I also view hourl and m30, but not as often. Mostly to look for any sup/dem areas I have missed.

Took my longs half an hour before GDP news, with the expectation range would expand to the upside. I normally don't really focus much on GBPJPY, but in this case I saw GBP was leading and entered a position on GJ for bulkier profits. GU immediately made it to TP (even slipped lol) to +50, GJ went up but stalled so I killed it for +40 I am a happy man.

Well, the dollar index is kind of predictable and quite less special. It is strictly related with the US dollar. So when the US consumer confidence comes out very positive; expect the dollar index to rise up too as the US dollar will surely appreciate against its rivals.

The dollar index is a basket of currencies paired with the USD, an average weighed index made up partially of EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDCAD, AUDUSD, NZDUSD, USDJPY and any other USD cross you can think of. Think moving average. Or common denominator. It's very special, because if it's moving it's giving away what the main market driver is. And that is either dollar strength or dollar weakness. US consumer confidence is just a data release that will inject liquidity into the market so it can move from A to B... or sometimes Z. Naturally, when consumer confidence is high, the dollar should be surging. It's not always the case, though and I've gone over that in previous posts. To make it seem even more important, when the Monster (GBPJPY) or other "exotic" pairs are moving, it's probably because GBPUSD or other major pairs are moving. GBPUSD is moving because the dollar is moving (excluding GBP releases most times). Everything comes to the USD, which is why I said it was our barometer for risk (in terms of "Risk-on" and "Risk-off").

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Thank you Piphoarder

--- 帖子 #249 ---
I think that this is more accurate: The US Dollar Index (USDX) is an index (or measure) of the value of the United States dollar relative to a basket of foreign currencies. It is a weighted geometric mean of the dollar's value compared only with Euro (EUR), 57.6% weight Pound sterling (GBP), 11.9% weight Canadian dollar (CAD), 9.1% weight Swedish krona (SEK), 4.2% weight and Swiss franc (CHF) 3.6% weight. Japanese Yen (JPY) 13.6% weight.

Inserted Video First time making a vid, be gentle I tried to pretty much write down comments of whatever was flying through my head as the trade progressed. Obviously I've recorded it on Demo, on a broker I don't even use to trade. Just wanted to show the thought process, working with the dollar index and combining HTF with LTF. I think I sum up why I'm in this trade in the first couple of minutes, notably the uptrend, expecting the daily close to be a doji (return back to open) etc.

Looking over some charts, I see this EURGBP chart. I've talked about it before, but liquidity takes an important place in my viewing of the market. When I see a clean level I'm expecting price to surge toward it. This is probably one of the most picture-perfect examples of that.

On the other hand, we have this. Starting to get used to seeing it already? This V-shaped pattern?

"This is how you predict swings" No offense but if you could predict anything in financial markets, forex in this case, you would be the richer than God! All the best!

--- 帖子 #274 ---
None taken, but no offense to you, if you couldn't predict anything in financial markets, how do you expect to make money in them? Don't kick it 'til you've tried it. Prediction implies "controlled" and measured risk. Otherwise you may as well call it gambling. Based on my analysis, I expect the euro to rally, so I buy it. What I don't do is see it tick higher and buy, just to get on the wrong side of a bearish market

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Ok, but still, prediction is prediction. Controled and measured risk is risk management which is something else. All the best!

--- 帖子 #276 ---
No. They're all components of being a good trader. You see, for me the pillars of proper trading are: Sound analysis, having a bias (expectation of where any market is going), timing /having the patience not to jump straight in, but wait for a good opportunity/, money management - knowing how to handle your open position (knowing when to cut, when to let run, placing your stop, trailing your stop), and finally risk management - I think of hedging. What this means is, someone who is profitable covers all of the above. Someone who isn't is lacking in one or more aspects. For instance, you can have awesome predictive analysis skills, but always chicken out of your positions or worse, manage poorly and end up losing on winner-analysis. So like I said, without knowing what to expect from any trading session, you stand no chance in making it in the long run, because you are gambling. Personally, by the number of trades I get breakeven'd on, it seems I'm still not adept in the position management department

--- 帖子 #277 ---
It's okay to not believe, it's actually pretty hard. I'm nowhere near as skilled as traders like ICT or other of his more advanced followers in terms of predictive analysis.

pipshaman @@This is how you predict swings" No offense but if you could predict anything in financial markets, forex in this case, you would be the richer than God! All the best! WDays not predict, and reads the price movement. This is consistent different things. And then every day there are good signals for trading. Sometimes you can not read write that price. And so all is right WDays. Good luck to you and the green pips guy.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Wdays, you've got me wrong pal, I was only highlighting the sintactics u've been using, I don't doubt in any way that u are a good trader. No, for the love of the debate, you say u must have a bias and an expectation where the price may go...OK, in my view this is a very bad thing, because when you have an expectation and bias the market will always show how wrong are you. A sound methode, based on a sound risk management should not be based on any biase from the trader, the trader must be neutral and trade mechanical. In markets when u try to predict u (we all) are always wrong. This is the way I see, is just the way I see but don't mind, your way is as good for you as is mine for me Enjoy the weekend!

--- 帖子 #280 ---
In the pic you've attached to the above post you've expected a down move before the breakout above 1.11224 but the market have told you u are wrong (see my attachement), so, your prediction was wrong. Don't expect anything from the market because anyway will do whatever want to do. Regards!

The common denominator between successful traders is having a plan, and trading the plan. Using triggers on its own can't be profitable in the long run as much as you try it. The reason being that a moving average cross, matrix signal, or any other custom indicator on its own will be right as much as it will be wrong. You can turn in some profit with it, by having 2:1, 3:1 etc. RR, but in the long run you won't make it. So mechanical trading is definitely not the way to go, unless you're Blackrock and have baller algo's that scalp the market for billions of dollars a year.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
No trade was entered based on this expectation. I traded the higher probability setups on USDCAD and USDCHF as shown in my post Don't forget that this was a NFP prognosis, and like I've stated in the past, NFPs, Feds and ECBs are dangerous and unpredictable for the most part.

Hi all, Only yesterday I found this thread and it appears to be an amazingly interesting thread. So i would like to participate and if I may ask a few questions. Now, I did read the thread over and over again before just asking and I did some (weekend) charting practice. Now, I have drawn my S&amp;R levels and drew some area's of possible demand and supply. Now, according to my theory ( and hopeully according to the guidelines over here) I came to the conclusion that USD will theoreticly decline further ( not taking into account the elections for theoreticle purposes) Based on what you see, would you agree and did I in fact drew my chart the right way? By the way: the red lines are based on what I found on the weekly chart (S&amp;R) and the orange ones are based on the daily. Any comment would be much appreciated. Have a nice weekend Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Watch all these gaps get filled overnight It's statistics, 70% of the time gaps will fill. Of course that leaves us with a 30% chance they don't fill Nonetheless, it's a pretty good strategy that some people use.

You're welcome man, I'll try to come up with one every now and then

--- 帖子 #288 ---
This is how it may unfold. Keep in mind Hillary victory = bullish for the dollar, Trump = bearish for the dollar. I've a feeling we'll see a woman president and betting on stronger dollar Of course it may as well straight up rally from here, which will be pretty bad for the point I'm trying to prove about being able to predict markets Joke aside, the rally to our marked out zone @ 97.55 was pretty swift, it reached the lows on the left of the H4 chart which is making me question the drop lower into 95.95-96.00 area.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
First off, let me thank you for the kind words. Hopefully it will be of some help. Second, REALLY like your color scheme It's very clean and neat. Now, regarding your read of the market. The S/R areas are drawn nicely, I like that you used weekly. I rarely go on a weekly chart these days, and it's probably not the smartest thing I'm doing. Nevertheless, your supply areas are a little off. We draw supply based on the wick-to-open of the last bullish candle before a decline. We draw demand based on the wick-to-open of the last bearish candle before a rally. So it would be like this, below. Also I don't advise you to use the fxcm US dollar index chart, because it's often a bit off from what it should look like. You can use a demo account on the broker I've mentioned in the early pages for biggest accuracy. In fact, I find those charts to be the most accurate so far... They're kinda bad because of the number of decimals, but still better and cleaner than the most of the other charts.

Thanks a lot Alex it is much appreciated. Now, on sunday evening when the markets opened (for retailers that is) we faced a big gap going north. It iseems for now ( monday morning (CET) that the gap in fact is not going to fill so I think the upcomming elections are playing their game here. Normaly the price should have continued to go down. Is it not? Jan

Commitment of Traders line chart with Open Interest. We see a sharp drop in Open Interest, which means long positions covering prior to the election. However, the CoT data suggests commercials are increasing hedging &amp; large speculator are positioning themselves long. The idea of CoT reports is that Large Speculators are trend followers, Commercials are hedgers. So for a rally, LS are net-long and CS are net short.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
very difficult to me planning trades with COT info since commercials are long, we want to go long, but when? they can accumulate much more than expected, i think. it's a good tool for sure, but i can't time it with charts

--- 帖子 #308 ---
stop loss hit

--- 帖子 #309 ---
I don't use it to plan trades, I use it to back my bias. Commercials being net long would mean overall bearish trend, since like I said they're selling as it rallies and buying as it declines. So you have to look at it mirrored. I'd refer you to that post again, large speculators (hedge funds and the like) are trend followers so if they're overall net-long, expect a bullish market.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Start shorting tomorrow

--- 帖子 #311 ---
yes, large specs go with the trend and the commercials go on the opposite. so you are more focused on large specs to define trend and so your bias? i tought ICTs mindset was to sniper commercials accumulation and try to get the top/bottom they make. i really can see that's gold what ICT shared, but i'm really struggling in put it all together. very frequently, i catch myself doing trades counter trend, chasing order blocks and at the other side, when following the trend, very frequently we're going into and opposite order block hope this thread can help me to solve the puzzle.. have been struggling for a while i don't have problem with money management techniques, that's what made me alive till now, but i'm going wrong in trading the 'edge' with consistency ICT really changed the way i see the markets, but when i tought "thats it!" and the profits will become more consistent, i was wrong.. not easy to execute all that

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Even if what we do here is strongly inspired by ICT, it's not full on ICT. I don't implement CoT analysis the same way as he does. For me, it's a tool to back-up my analysis.

Your analysis is spot on Wdays.. great to see someone trade this way... all the information one needs to trade profitably is on the charts and only experience and months and months of chart study is required to get a hang of this business.. on the EurUSD.... my bias had been bearish long before the election since it broke 1.1000 BRN and other technical levels highlighted on my chart... so i saw all bullish moves as temporary correction and had been waiting for a retest of the Key levels. once the election whipsaw happened, i watched how priced spiked up and started racing back down and felt it was time to join the short train again... current +200 pips and running ..... learning new things from you about accumulation and entry precision on smaller time frames. I usually don't trade below the 1HR chart because i look to take nothing less than a 100pips per trade. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

At the time I wrote this, both EURUSD and USDx were at their respective support and resistance levels, both showing willingness to catch their breath. They took out significant swings, which in my book is a call for a retracement. However, I will not act on the bias until I see this

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Hello WDays, I'm just seeking confirmation if I'm getting the anticipatory analysis correctly. On GU would you agree with me that the market structure is biased upwards for a extensive correction to fill the empty space? Also taking into account USDx sitting at resistance should increase the chances of higher prices for the cable? Possible reaching 1.29x best regards

--- 帖子 #330 ---
About GU - Yes, but it already reached the first target I had given. USDx slightly broke above a very significant record high, couldn't stay above =&gt; Fakeout in my eyes. Wait for market structure....

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Thanks man, so I must assume you're biased long on both GU and EU until structure and USDx shifts. Sorry to bother, just trying to get this right, the material is gold.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
No, I am cautiously bullish, which means I'm not shorting neither right now. But I want confirmation to start going long Any dips on USDx for now are an opportunity to go short on EU/GU moreso than a decent long trade on EU/GU. Especially with news of a very probable rate hike by the Fed...

Hello WDays, Here I am reading the thread and taking a closer look at Yields and how they can hint shifts in market sentiment as risk on and risk off scenarios, and I believe this statement is misleading isn't it? Please correct me if I'm wrong but I believe currencies seek yields therefore if yields are going up this is risk on and bullish, on the contrary if they're going down this is appreciation for the safe haven currencies like the dollar and we expect to see a risk off scenario. Now what do you think about future movement of the Trinity? I've notice a small divergence in the US yields compared to the others and how yields are moving higher, perhaps we'll see failure in the USDx holding higher levels and a market shift to a bullish bias macro speaking in the upcoming months. Anyways, just my neophyte view on the market outlook without taking into account other barometers like Gold and OIL. Your input is very much appreciated and have a great weekend all.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Yes, thanks.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Hi, sorry for the late reply. In general, when the bund is moving higher, so is the euro, when the US bond is moving higher, so is the dollar etc. It's hard to predict future yield move, so I don't really bother, but you could use the trinity to see when one goes off in its own direction and trade that currency because it will be stronger than the rest (think currency strength meter wise). This chart, that you posted is showing higher yields, and we're expecting a Fed rate hike like almost 100%. Bullish dollar it is... for now.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Thanks mate

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Morning WDays my friend, I have a Technical question which is confusing me, hope you don't mind. When approaching a KSR, and lets say for instance we're neutral in our bias, but we expect a bounce since the level is very sensitive, do you wait for structure to form on the Higher Timeframe, form a bias and THEN start taking positions intraday from smaller timeframes? Or if structure start to break intraday you start to positioning yourself?

--- 帖子 #348 ---
It depends on how confident I am. Sometimes I will aggressively buy or sell off the level, other times I will wait for smaller timeframe market structure. Most of the time it's the first, because I try to preempt price action throughout the session/day, so when I build my bias using the higher timeframes I just look for levels to buy or sell at on my lower timeframes. There are times, like the EU long off the 1.0570, where I want structure verification.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Reversals are the trickiest, because sometimes price will fly off in the opposite direction that it has been going, sometimes it will only move slightly and go into a range. EU did just that, it's been consolidating and market structure can be confusing.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Over at the lower timeframes, we see a clear break in market structure last night, and like I said - expect a deep retracement following that. Where does it go? Inside a demand area, only to shoot up. So on here, we also have market structure confirming, except we have to look back to notice it. However the follow up was not too convincing, hence why we have another dip inside that same demand area. If this were our daily close, I'd be selling tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Thanks again, these times when you start positioning yourself aggressively when market structure is breaking in the lower timeframes usually happens in extreme highs or lows from HTF or very very sensitive levels am I right? Developing a bias is the hardest part IMHO, it will probably take a while for me to grasp the concepts but in 3 year of forex this is by far the first time I feel like getting in sync with what is actually going on behind the scenes.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Developing a bias is the easiest part because there's no money on the table. You've got a clear mind while looking for stuff and actually see what your charts are showing, instead of what that feeling of nausea in your gut is telling you (fear/greed). It's when money's on the line that it gets hard. Market structure shifts on lower timeframes can be a false indication, we only use to confirm what we already know - that the trend is reversing at an important level. You can't trust market structure breaks and shifts alone, because of the stop raids. It happens plenty of times, much more rare on the higher timeframes, though. It's all a combination of different principles that we apply throughout the entire routine, analytic stages and the execution stage.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Also, join the club, that's exactly how I felt the first time, too

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Hi Alex, I am not a regular poster on FF. I happen to come accross your thread and read it through. It is very interesting. I like your concept. Thanks for posting your methodology. We have a similar approach i.e. looking at a higher timeframe and executing on lower timeframes. It is your thread that shed some light into supply and demand trading. I came accross supply/demand but never really applied it. Reading the entire thread and watching your well taken videos was very interesting. I am always interested in fine tuning my trading. I am looking forward for more of your insight and hopefully soon I will contribute as well. As mentioned above, our approach is similar as I am defining my bias based on the higher timeframe. The execution is on the lower timeframe. I totally agree with you in saying that most of the job is done outside of trading hours. I normally plan my week ahead on sundays. Then I just need to wait for price to reach my areas of interest. And H4 helps me with that. Trade execution is mostly on m5. Happy trading, Oezy

I just realized I should maybe elaborate a bit on market structure, I'll get on it when I've got time this week.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
That would be great! I've been reading your thread since about a week ago and it's great stuff. Earlier today when you mentioned market structure I said to myself "I wish he would elaborate on that". I didn't post to make that request because I was afraid that topic alone might be too much of a tangent from your original topic in this thread. Anyway, I look forward to that and all your posts for that matter. Thank you for your time and effort in sharing your experience with us. P.S. If there's a good source online that covers market structure that you know of I'd love to know about it. I'd like to get a nice introduction to it so that when you cover it it will make more sense to me.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Hi Alex, you mentioned a couple times you expect range completions. When is a range complete? I assume there is a difference in range completion and a range taken out. Further, I assume a touch of a former supply/demand zone is the range completion. That would mean we look for a reversal at that point. Following this, a range taken out often translates to a high/low taken out. In this instance we expect a retracement. Below I marked a level of interest. Not so sure if I'd call it a demand zone as of now as it was formed long time ago. Would the level in green be a range completion? Now we wait for a reaction. Ideally we get a strong bounce, and we'd assume a demand zone having formed. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Cheers bro

--- 帖子 #359 ---
To me, range completion would mean a symmetrical move in the opposite direction, back to where the first movement came from. It looks like a V or an upside-down V on our charts. Price on EU went into a historical low and bounced from it. It did, however complete the range. This concept is based on the fact that markets oscillate up and down, and eventually price will go back to whence it came from.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Yesterday I started making a detailed blueprint on Market Structure, but I figured it would be way too long and not really clear to post as a block of text. Which is why I made a presentation and today I'll make it into a video, so you can look forward to that today.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Awesome, looking forward to it!

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Thanks for the prompt reply. Theoretically our expectation would now be to look for a retrace back to the origin of the move down at about 1,11 (supply). On its way up, there are some levels of interest that need to get violated (most importantly previous month low - former swing low). Below is NGAS. This asset made a nice move south and is now on it's way back north. I was looking for a bounce off the green rectangle on its way up, but didn't get the touch. I made some notes on the chart to grasp if I do get the idea of range completion. Basically we expect the market to complete a range (which is the origin of the move up or down). If we have a violation we look for the next higher range. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Market Structure Inserted Video As promised. Forgive me for the slight delay. Unfortunately I cannot upload the PPT file.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
It's not something that I monitor, but I guess I agree with your analysis. Beware though, when looking for Sup &amp; Dem candles, avoid taking the ones that form inside a consolidation. Look at biggest juicy candle you can find, like I've shown below.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
I didn't think about the consolodation. Looking at the candle you are pointing at, would you have considered that as an entry (looking to the immediate left)? The strong move up, and than price comes back to the start of the move. Just crossed my mind looking at the chart again. I do not really Monitor this asset either. I just put it couple days ago on my list. The reason to take this asset is simply to have a neutral view on the supply/deamand and price action for a better understanding of what you show us. The Supply level shown on the pic above got busted. There was no money at stack. But from the look of above chart it looked pretty apealing to take a short trade. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I left the original levels on the chart and added some more. The green lines represent Demand and the orange line Supply. Price broke the previous range and is completing the next range. With the recent swing high taken out, we'd expect a pullback to one of the green lines. Since we have a strong close above the swing high, we would not expect to see a strong pullback. We'd look for price hit the first green line (counting from top). Am I getting the idea? I might be putting in some of my own thoughs. But am interested in how you would look at this asset.

Hello Alex, did you managed to grab this position on Fiber? The bounce from H4 supply in direction of D1 Structure, also a Fakeout above 1.0650 RN to grab liquidity, confirmed by the USDx failing to break 100.60. The only thing I don't know how to handle is the large Asia session, how do you manage those days? Also would you agree we may see the Fiber go into a consolidation on this upcoming week and is better to wait for longer term market structure to form before entering? PS: Green area is demand from H4, I expect some reaction there however I'm unwilling to enter as it goes againt D1 market structure. best regards

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Unfortunately I didn't, I wasn't around when it happened. Did you? It's an excellent read of the pair, well done! (y) We have a break of market structure on EU and price retraced. This could just be a stop raid, because USDx did not make a lower low, but an equal low. EU is in consolidation, but looking for targets within the range is my strategy for now. Will see how it plays out and probably act on it tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Thanks but I also missed, it was good for 100pips and its still dropping. Could you elaborate on how do you trade inside longer term consolidation? Sorry to bother again

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Generally speaking, if we're in a rally, supply areas need to be broken and demand areas need to hold and the other way around in a decline. This is why, when trading with the trend, we use the "range completion" principle to determine targets for our trades. In technical analysis, we want to look slightly beyond, and look for a range completion + Supply area for our trend reversal point. However, when a range is complete and price attacks the next level (wider range), there is also a market structure shift. When price bust up through the level, it also caused a shift in market structure. I believe the level you highlighted should have held and price would have dipped a little, in a corrective way. Bias is still to the upside until the widest range is complete I'd say, though. NGas is probably not your typical chart, because there are also a couple of more fundamentals in play, so you may see new momentum (as it so happened).

--- 帖子 #371 ---
It depends on how wide the range is. If it's wide enough, I will look for price to attack liquidity on both sides of the market and base trade ideas on that. I will no longer look for price to set a high and fade the rally, or set a low and fade the decline. Sometimes I will try to stay within a smaller range and collapse the trade before it goes for the high or low. It all depends on the exact type of consolidation we have on our hands. A lot of times it's so bad, that I have to stay away from any entries and just ride it out.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
I realize I've thrown a lot of stuff at you guys, and it may become confusing. At some point I will try to adequately categorize the information. I've an idea how I can do that, but it's still kinda in development. It will probably include a series of videos, though.

List of abbreviations could be great (in first post). Video for teaching is not good idea. For not English native speaker is problem to understand. Every viewer should make a lot of notes. It often will be not exact. Texts and images are much more better. Idealy in first post or near or link from first post. Text could be gradually improving. Thank all in advance.

Hello Lifon, for the videos, which I personally think are excellent, you can click on the button to watch it in Youtube. Click on the 'Settings' tab and select 'Subtitles'. From there you can then select 'Auto-Translate'. This will translate the spoken text into any language you care to select. Hope this helps. Do you want me to make a video on how to do this? Lol.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Yes this is a clean and readable image, but you should make somewhere in this thread a brief summary of the abbreviations like, ST, IT, LT, so we can all understand and learn what your annotations on the chart mean.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Thanks for advise. English subtitles are usefull. But translate in czech language is bad.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
I do not mean to be blunt. I'd strongly advise to read the whole thread from post 1. All questions should be clear when you reach the last post. If there are still questions, everyone whe knows the answer will be happy to answer. It is really a good read and informative. And it is just 20 pages. This is a discretionary approach that requires to understand the basics. So followers need to do their due dilligengce. Cheers, Wmn

--- 帖子 #384 ---
I've used the abbreviation in the latest video, which is why I thought I'd use it directly here Like I said, I will reorganize everything soon, anyway.

Tight stop, leaving soon and can't micro-manage. Target is way higher but I will cut before that by the end of the day I'm sure.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
I grabbed a similar position on EU, I'm long planing to TP way higher @ 1.070x. A calculated bet on the MS shift and USDx overbought condition. Let's see, If I'm right this has a great likelihood of becoming the LOW.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
I took 9 pips in loss on mine

--- 帖子 #391 ---
I really like the "set and forget" type of trading, and it appeals to my lifestyle a lot. Sometimes trades just need to unfold and keeping a close eye on them the entire day makes that impossible. But looking at charts every once in a while helps to avoid missing out on good trades. With that in mind, I removed my initial buy limit order and set it on the 1.0572 support level. I got filled and price reached my 30 pip TP just as I came home.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Oil stopped digging lower lows, so I decided I'd give this a go... Late entry, but it feels like it wants to drop. Holding it for now, will see again by london close. Edit: changed stop level higher, and will look to add to the position because now it wants to retrace it seems

--- 帖子 #393 ---
I want a lower swing high to form on usdcad right now, otherwise it's bad news for my trades.

Great trade, I'm still holding my Fiber long as short term trade targeting 127% Fib + H4 supply. I'm really curious on your technique to add to winners, hopefully you'll share with us mate Best regards

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Good to hear. I think it should be good til 1.08-1.0850, but don't let me bias you. As for adding to winners, you can either use pullbacks to enter some more, or in this case, I saw it would retrace instead of tank. I waited for the pullback and used a combination of fibo + low timeframe supply areas, and set my limits. They all got filled, because the retracement was deeper.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Great approach, but how do you handle exposure?

--- 帖子 #399 ---
What do you mean? How do I not shit myself when I have multiple positions with stops?

Alex, would you show us your top down thought process for your Loonie and Oil trade?

--- 帖子 #403 ---
After not being able to decide where to place my stops, I finally put them below the second order right before going to bed, and I almost got stopped..... Completely lucky on this one

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Gladly. USDCAD has been in a very wide consolidation range. It began falling, and retracing. I just caught positions inside yesterday's retracement and got super lucky that I didn't get stopped overnight. P.S: I checked out an oil chart because I read headlines it was dropping like a hammer. I wanted it to not be dropping when I plot my trade, because I wanted overall dollar weakness to be leading, and not CAD reacting to oil movements.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Nice trade. How many pairs are monitoring Alex? Got stopped out on my EU for 20pips

--- 帖子 #406 ---
I've a bunch, but I don't really trade them all the time. I focus mainly on EU, GU and Ucad

--- 帖子 #407 ---
It did not get back to the Green zone becuase thats where the Market Makers(MM) have set up liquidity traps for later on. When you see a set up like that, expect price to come back take out those stops, come into the DZ then head back up again. This is a standard MM business model and you will see it repeating over and over again in the markets

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Hi WDays i just learn about your strategy and you can check my analysis this is right? http://prntscr.com/ddy1e1 Thank you

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Morning WDays, what do you think of this. Cable is making higher lows for a couple of weeks as it hits demand zones, however its now touching a strong supply zone with confluences with the sweet spot and 1.2550 RN, there's a possibility of reaching 1.2328 for a retest of support if that supply confirms momentum. Keep in mind we have NFP this friday and USDx is still consolidating. I would love to read your taking on this pair, after the fast crash it's acting very cautious.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
I'm bullish until 1.2655. Look at your hourly chart, you'll see a now common pattern hopefully

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Yes, the range got filled, I have some trouble grasping this concept. Thanks man EDIT: Could you elaborate more about range completion and how to implement into the analysis of Market structure Alex?

--- 帖子 #412 ---

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Get well soon Alex. Take it as a nice opportunity to get off the charts and enjoy some interesting movies Below is my view on EUR/USD. I currently have a bullish bias for the time being. This bias will remain until proven wrong. Edit: An interesting level that price want to aim to hit would be the 1,10 level as slightly above we have a SZ. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Prive bounced off support slightly above 1,05, formed a range and finally broke out on top of the range. The orange line should be the top of the Demand Zone. It is a big zone and I'd not really put a pending order there with a stop below. Narrowing down to a smaller TF such as H1 does not really narrow down the DZ, unless you use the bullish wicks. I personally like to be as close to Support Zones or SZ with my entries as possible. Ideally we do not get a strong retrace inside the zone, as that would make me question the bullish strength. I am looking for signs of strength off the orange line (top of DZ) which is a confluence level of the range top and previous week high.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Those were the levels that I had prior and during the ECB conference. EU reacted to a statement by Draghi, that QE would be increased. However, seeing as it is set to end in march 2017, I do believe the decline should be shortlived and EU should head back up from around these support levels. The bottom line is, USD was no actor in this decline. It's all euro-based. It should recuperate with a limited upside, though, because we're waiting for a december Fed hike.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Small trade idea that I had late last night. Set a pending sell at the 1.0650 RN with the expectation that price would correct downwards after taking out a significant swing on the left. I was opting for a larger target, but I got scared of 15m demand area. This is an alternative way we can incorporate our knowledge on Market Structure

--- 帖子 #421 ---
What is lagging?.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
What do you mean?

--- 帖子 #423 ---
If you mean, what is a ''lagging'' indicator (?) it means that instead of showing what price is going to do - or even is doing, which is no doubt the claim it, or at least its coder, makes - it is actually behind the price. This is most readily available indicators, by the way!

Judging by the confluence of KSR across the board? Those concepts need to be further explained, very very interesting stuff IMHO

--- 帖子 #431 ---
It's simple logic, when the USD moves across all pairs - there's still fuel. When all USD pairs have reached a form of support or resistance and are stalling, chances are the USD rally will be cut short. I wouldn't say I'm bullish on EU, I still think we will end up seeing parity on Fiber, but just not yet.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
In fact, if the euro fails to close below 1.0400 today, chances of parity by the end of the month grow weaker.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
+30 at the end of the day.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Yday's long, closed for +30 at TP

--- 帖子 #435 ---
And this explains why I took the trade. Also as per our knowledge on MS and swings being taken out, I've now got a short

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Where do you think is the PA go in sell mode from now? Â Â

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Buy the dips is the right strategy for me For me, the euro is now a bullish market until 1.07 perhaps, will have to adjust later on.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
I will now wait to get in on a long to 1.07 as I said...

--- 帖子 #439 ---
I thought we shouldn't trust lower tfs MS since they are noise, its get confusing about which bias we should focus and methodology . please elaborate Wdays

--- 帖子 #440 ---
This is H1 market structure we're talking about here As I've said, I watch daily MS for overall trend, but I keep an eye on hourly market structure in order to quickly spot shifts in trend. Also, the short trade was based on the premise that when a swing gets taken out, price will usually go the other way. This current situation looks more like a raid on stops, but I've been keeping an eye on the swing at 1.0477 as it is an important one. I believe we're headed for a retracement into 1.0400 maybe? And then we should be seeing some more upside, before we start thinking about parity next year.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
I hope this clears it up... Sorry if I confused you. I'm open for questions and clarifications If you spend enough time looking at charts, your eye will get used to which swings are noise and which ones are the real deal, don't worry. It comes with practice

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Is this noises happen in all time frame? Or just in lower time frame? Would you please be kind showing more examples?

--- 帖子 #443 ---
I see your reasoning, and its spot on. Why do you think the retrace should be further into the 1.0400 before more bullishness? its because the stop raid and 1.50RN liquidity grab?

--- 帖子 #444 ---
I'm still going by the logic that the swing at 1.0477 was taken, and price needs to retrace. When it does so, I usually pull my fib and look for the 50%, 61.8% until the 78.6%. Inside that area, we have a lot of horizontal levels. We have an hourly demand at 1.0380 which is also an institutional level; we have the 1.04 RN + confluence of the fibonacci midpoint (70.5) level. I guess I won't place a limit there, but I will wait and see the reaction there. That way, if I'm wrong and it plummets, I won't lose money.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
It's a ballsy call, because everyones sentiment is still bearish and looking for parity. I stand by my belief, that we might not see parity any time soon.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
I see, but i don't understand why you discarded the retrace to 1.0430 swing low as a possible long setup.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Because I am looking for a deeper retracement, simply. Remember what we talked about market structure shifts and retracements. There is nothing fueling a euro rally, except for speculative trading. Ergo, it can't settle for a retracement as shallow as 1.0430. It will need to go lower, in order to go higher! The 1.05 RN is proving to be a hard nut to crack, too.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Ok makes perfect sense, Im also not expecting 1.50 to be breached without further retracement as well, however we could expect some reaction around 1,0430 perhaps a shallow one but decent to grab something around 20pips. Is this reasoning flawed?

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Of course it's not flawed! It just depends on perspective The problem is, that move already happened and any support 1.0430 offered in the past may be absorbed now.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Thanx for the answer mate, just one more thing, you mentioned keeping a eye on the d1 bias, but you're ok in taking positions against it, if you are in sync how this affect the way you manage the position?

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Well there's a time and place to take counter-trend trades. Even if I'm bullish longterm, I may still sell in the short term. It's all about cherry picking scenarios, like today. As for managing the positions, I use regular risk parameters. If you're not confident, you could cut your risk in half and use a position twice as smaller on your counter-trend trades, until you build enough confidence. Cut risk by more, if you're still worried at 1/2 your lotsize.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
EA long hit for +30, I was cautious

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Hi mate, here I am again bothering you with questions lol. This time about profit taking, I've noticed you always taking profits constantly at 30pips, is there a reasoning for it? Bellow is my trade for the day on GU, entered on the H1 supply zone for a result of +43pips. I've followed your advice and started paying more attention to intraday market structure as they offer lower risk (stops wise). Best regards and Merry Christmas to all.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
GU short +30

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Great job! Keep at it, and you'll be raking in tons I do 30 pips as a standard TP on EU/GU simply because it's roughly 1/3 of the daily ADR and it's an easy to achieve target - ideal for intraday trading. Sometimes I will do setups that take longer and require holding, that's where I don't look for a set number of pips but for price to reach a certain level.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Awesome, you don't place SL bellow above highs or lows right? you use a standard fixed sl?

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Nah.. well sometimes I will but not as a rule of thumb though. I set a stop as tightly as I can afford and I base my lotsize on my stop size

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Do you follow any guidelines about where to place them?

--- 帖子 #459 ---
If I assume my entry is picture perfect I will use a less than 10 pips stop. If I deem it a little too volatile, I will place a larger stop - within the 15 to 20 pips. There are setups like the HOD-LOD London one, where I will use a 10 pip stop or less, when I'm entering on a pullback I will be more cautious and place a larger stop. Either way I will risk no more than 2%. So for example, if my equity is 10 000$ and I take an aggressive 10 pip stop, lotsize would be 2.00 lots, if I do regular 20 pip stops - then it's 1.00 lot.

--- 帖子 #460 ---

As for you WDays

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Nice work WDays. I mostly trade S/D set ups. This basic method keeps me profitable week to week. You have a few variations I've not seen before. Thanks for those. Education Never Stops. Have noticed many of your charts show M30. They can provide a fine tuned entry zone. Mostly, I've found under M30 zones are unreliable, unless you're simply using them to drill down into a Zone, to see where the rapid escape began. Thanks, Darryl

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Time is irrelevant in trading. Using tick or volume bar charts show where the trades are taking place at least in the futures market

--- 帖子 #466 ---
GbpAud H1 chart with excellent level @ 1.7001. On Gbp pairs I rarely get in before price is at least touching zone. M30 looks a bit bigger, so take your pick. R:R could be at least 1:2.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
My strategy would be this, on GA...

--- 帖子 #468 ---
I beg to differ, it all depends on the "on-average" timeframe you use for your trades - whether it's scalping, intraday, short term or swing time is always relevant.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ I like that too. I just choose to take set ups I'm more familiar with.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
There are more than one ways to skin a cat GA is a terribly volatile pair, though. I'd bet on my setup with more confidence, but that's just my way. By all means, go with whatever you're more confident with

--- 帖子 #471 ---
CadJpy has tested this H1 zone, a cleared it. Now on retest, where I'm in short. H4 chart shown here. Next Demand Zone is about 80p from here. Let's see how it goes. Risk is 20. SL @ 86.90. TP 86.12. Red dashed line is last weeks low. At that point is another H1 Demand zone. If price gets there, I'll remove risk.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
what does the on average mean? like fibs or indicators or anyone other tool they become self fulfilling people don't trade via time they trade via price action using whatever chart is up its just my 16 year of trading opinion

--- 帖子 #473 ---
playing the 30-+ range on the euro also use line chart for V W Setup when i want to go long for short i do N M Setup. Keep in mind euro is on a Bear Trend just scalping!!!!!!!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Yet some patterns work better than others? Again, I disagree with the concept that anything is self-fulfilling just because retailers all look for the same things. Markets move thanks to bank liquidity, not retailers who spot a head &amp; shoulders. Their actions are mostly politically driven, especially as of late. When moving into position, they leave clues for the enlightened to follow. Time is an extremely important concept when trading this method, because by breaking down the intraday price action into key timezones, we can take advantage of trading the daily range from the High of Day or Low of day, which is usually set in the morning session (London open and a couple of hours after that). 16 years of experience is bound to give confidence in your own way of perceiving the market, yet I wouldn't say you're right about that, simply because my method differs and works just as well

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Of course, I say time is important from an intraday perspective, but it is equally as important in a swing trader's mindset: the weekly high-low is set by wednesday morning the latest, and we ought to trade away from it at that point. Same principle and rules apply

--- 帖子 #476 ---
The secret to trading success is finding your niche, whatevrr works for you, and then training and working towards establishing the proper discipline to abide by your own rules, because statistically that's what makes money for you. Then comes the experience and confidence that results out of the millions of hours of chart time.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Alex, you nailed it pretty well. If you are a scalper and you like to trade breakouts, you do not want to trade during asian session. Ideal trading hours would be the overlaps i.e. London Open (overlap with Asia close), US Open (overlap with Europe trading hours). It boils down to your type of trading. For some traders time / timeframe is irrelevant. You may be looking at tick charts or you are a position trader and do not worry about chopping market conditions, because your stop is wide enough. For the type of trading Alex presents here, time plays an important role. The market is not always the same. With that I mean we can't trade all market conditions the same way. A breakout trader will have a hard time when the market is ranging. A range trader will have a hard time in a trending market. Then we have the reversal traders who look for trading the top off a bull market. These will also have a hard time in a trending market. As a trader either I need to be able to accomodate to the different market conditions, or I need to be patient and wait for the propper market condition I am accustomed to. And this is not timeframe dependant. A pullback on the daily can be a trend on H4 or lower. A range on a weekly can have up and down trends on the daily. All we need to do is to identifiy what currently is happening on the timeframe we want to trade and act accordingly. And this may include knowledge of time.

Hi Mercennary The commercials in the COT report are actually short the EUR not long. For Commercials they buy/sell contracts for hedging positions so you have to invert it for their view of the market.

Hey WD, by the way you're talking, your EU SL held up. From your posted chart, it looked like your stop might have hit, or missed by a pip or two. But maybe you got in on the way back up. Either way, good eye catching that one.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
I had moved it below the 72 level because I figured it would get hit right at the low of the move down (as it would have). 1.0372 was initially where I wanted to enter, but decided to enter at the demand area above. I rushed in before it was fully tested, too, so I had to play around with my stops a bit.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Hi Sir, you're wrong, and btw Im well informed on how commercials operate but thanx anyway . They are more long them they had been in the past 2 years, expecting euro to rally here. Already bagged 200pips and holding some for the intermediate term. best regards

--- 帖子 #494 ---

Please explain how I am incorrect. Also you are talking about the EURUSD in your first post but posted are Eurodollar chart. Which one are we talking about here?

Trying to get 30 pips on each, EURUSD and USDCHF. Not a perfect entry , i could get lower risk on each trade.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Breakeven on each

--- 帖子 #507 ---
TP of 30 pip hit on EURUSD and USDCHF. Lets see if i could do it better. Now i'm waiting for an retrace to enter again

--- 帖子 #508 ---
GJ closed for +50 1 of two EU longs closed for +30, waiting on 50 for the second one. And that's how you make a nice 10% to kickstart the year

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Really well done man! I'm curious if we entered for the same reasons?

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Missed my tp by a pip and bounced almost 20 pips from a m5 supply area. Killing it manually if it breaks 1.0415

--- 帖子 #511 ---
I think so...my methodology is to identify the entry zones in higher TF (4h chart). The entry zone is retrace of the last leg - in the EURUSD the previous leg was up so the price should retrace at least 61.8 or lower (below 1.04801) - in USDCHF the previous leg was down, so the price should retrace at least 61.8 or higher (higher than 1.02211) in both cases those zone are Support and resistance zones of the higher TF, then when the price gets to the Entry zone, i go to lower TF (in this case 15M) and i start looking for entries with low risk I think the major reasons are identical But i have to admit that may entry was a littel bit late

--- 帖子 #512 ---
My entry was based off the fact that the historical Low at 1.0355 was pierced, but price failed to stay below. So I assumed it was liquidity being attacked and faded the decline

--- 帖子 #513 ---
nice start man . 10% is very good.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Nice Trade, could you elaborate on your reasoning for the entry, since taking longs is counter trend from the HTF D1, was the market structure shift on H1?

--- 帖子 #519 ---
It is merely a follow up to yesterday's long I'm chasing 1.07 and liquidity above the 1.0650 highs, so trend is not bearish for me

In terms of EU, I see this but expect further upside to 1.0760. There are payrolls tomorrow, so anything can happen at this point. I'm still waiting for liquidity above 1.0650 to be taken.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
unfortunately the price reached my target of 40 pip, i closed the position to soon Today i'm also not having Setup in FX

--- 帖子 #526 ---
It happens, don't worry When I started I was closing positions waaaaay too early, and always ended up regretting. I battled that by trying a couple of things, and I found that if I did not stick around in front of my charts, I can let positions run longer and usually end up winning more out of each one.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
EURUSD TARGETS (in ascending order) 1.0590 - H it 1.0650 - Even if price stalls, I doubt it will stop here 1.0690 - Price going there will mean Liquidity above 1.0650 is absorbed 1.0790 - Final target before any serious downside. The move could extend as much as 1.0870

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Seems I'm always on the wrong side of the trades Could you please explain better how do we incorporate the "range completion pattern"? How it affects our bias and market structure interpretation, I feel like this is a key element I miss in my understanding of this methodology

--- 帖子 #529 ---
What do you mean by range completion pattern?

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Awesome, however how do we, noobies, reach this conclusion that the structure has shifted to bullish and should look for upside targets inside the range completion, sorry If I sound a bit frustrated, because I am, lol. There's plenty of information In here however its lacking some serious methodology structure. Don't get me wrong, I'm loving everything I'm learning here, but its plenty of moving parts that's getting hard to put together best regards

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Thank you for this very informative thread I am following it, I like your precision trading style and am impressed by your results ! I am able to see and reproduce by myself the eurusd targets you mentionned above but I have the same question than Mercennary: how do you know for sure that the structure has shifted to bullish? I use market structure and 9/18 ema cross on D1/W1 to identify the major trend but I don't see it bullish at this time. Thanks!

Great thread, keep it up guys

hi wdays thanks for your kindness i am new in forex i expecting more clear education in this thread.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Â Hey Wdays, nice thread here. I use similar methods but am still lacking the confidence to execute quickly. The trade you took in the image you posted caught my eye and made me curious as to why you thought price would be bullish instead of bearish coming out of the consolation/accumulation phase? You entered a position before price made a move.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
With your higher timeframe bias in mind, accumulation can be an opportunity to get in rather than something to confuse you

--- 帖子 #536 ---
I already explained that a couple of times EU has ran a 10 year low and pulled back. Think of it as part of our counter-trend strategy

--- 帖子 #537 ---
The reversal has nothing to do with range completion. Range completion is merely something that I use to set targets when trading a trend It's going to take me longer to explain, so I will do that a bit later.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Trying out some stocks, same analysis rules apply

I've been quiete over the holidays. Am back now and here is what I am looking at. Comments are more than welcome. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The downside of this idea is. If price reaches the target area (the orange lines) price did break a local high which is rather a bullish sign. More interesting resistance levels are further up at the 1,03 area. But as supply zone, I beleive the area I marked would be the interesting supply zone. Looking forward for your input

Thanks pa, I had a good time. The indicator you ask about (red and blue triangles) is the Fractal indicator. I think mt4 has it under Bill Williams indicators. It's a good visual tool to highlight s/r, and congestion zones.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Cool. I didn't know that. USD/CHF is my least favourite asset. Never traded it. Just caught my eye and thought about going for it. Price did react slightly below the orange line. Kinda confirms I am getting the hang of this.

I wouldn't be so sure about that Market structure is still bullish, Key Support and demand areas are being respected while resistance and supply is broken. While 1.0760 is in my sight for now, I presume the bull move could extend as far as 1.0870.

Hi Wdays, Great thread you have here. I have been following with interest and read through the thread a couple of times over recent days. I like the way it provides you with definite targets. I need to work on my entries so as not to enter too soon. I am just trying to get a handle on the HTF analysis to get my bias. Below are daily charts of the USD Index and EURUSD. The full width green and blue lines are KSR for daily and 4HR respectively, while the shorter green and blue lines are daily and 4HR S&amp;D. My take is that we could be seeing a head and shoulders forming on the USD Index and a corresponding upside down head and shoulders on the EURUSD. If I am right it should mean the EU going down for a day or two and then back up and vice versa for the USD Index. Please can you let me know your thoughts and if my analysis is correct or totally off? Thanks Nelson Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

HI There, How do you use the asian range in your day trading? Great stuff!!!

--- 帖子 #581 ---
I don't use it on its own, I mostly use it to denote key sessions. Sometimes I will look for a retracement back to a sup/dem area inside the AR. Having the indicator makes it easier to map out the market for me, simply.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Hi Alex, Thank you for sharing your knowledge with us. Would you please share with us your indicator that shows spread, entries etc... (top right corner of your chart) Many thanks

USDOLLAR remains at the level I mentioned in post 571. I didn't take any position as I talked about at that time. Attached Image (click to enlarge) As long price stays above support I am looking for a move south on EUR/USD and GBP/USD. But currently need to excersize patience. Cheers, Wmn

Bullish euro, bearish dollar. Just like clockwork. I believe we can reach for the stars on EU - 1.07ish after the last significant swing high at 1.0634 got taken.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Thanks. When you draw the zone on the Bearish candle prior to the bullish move on price - is it from bottom wick to the body or upper wick to the body? When you draw the zone on the Bullish candle prior to the Bearish move on price - is it from bottom wick to the body or upper wick to the body? H4 - if two zones are one on the top of each (sperated by 50-60pips), Should we assume that the second one (higher) will hold stronger or should be rely on USindex to support the decision?

--- 帖子 #587 ---
I used a simple memo-trick at first, use whichever side price is moving towards. So if we're in a downtrend and expecting a bounce off demand - use the top wick-to-body of the bearish candle and then the other way around for supply

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Thanks Wdays. If the demand zone fails, shall we expect the one below it to be stronger... What makes some demand zone stronger than others....

--- 帖子 #589 ---
If demand breaks but supply holds, then we're simply in a downtrend Sup &amp; Dem are only meant to hold when we're expecting or seeing a shift in trend based on MS + correlative pair analysis (USDx) I've talked about it in prior posts, and it's probably in one of the highlighted ones.

Hey Alex, thank you for sharing your knowledge here with us. I just finished reading the whole thread. What a gold nugget we have here. I took several notes but I'm still a bit confused on the process. I think it would be beneficial if you could post the HTF and LTF image. I hope I'm not asking for too much. On a side note, what is your views on EURUSD? I've been trying to apply what I learnt, but I'm not confident its correct. For whatever reason I foresee a huge bull move coming. Once again, thank you for all you did here on the thread.

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Hi everyone, great thread. It might be me being slow, but if the USDx is just reversed from EU, GU then how can that help us in our analyzing?

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Hi man, let me refer you to this post, it should make things clear...

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Which HTF and LTF image do you mean? As far as my EU bias, I'm bullish. Talks of rate hike may foil it, though...

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Quick question, in this example (post #17) point 3 takes the previous high. I'm assuming it took the high because there was SLs from the previous bearish trend. Is that a correct assessment? Also, breaking the previous high is a requirement to look for a setup? It almost look like a Quasimodo pattern. Is that just a coincidence?

--- 帖子 #597 ---
What I meant is that usually you just show the LTF. So basically your entry based on fib or price reaching the order block. But if you could show the HTF of WHY you found that setup WHEN you found it. Let me give you an example. This is a trade I took Friday. It didn't work. It went 20 pips my way with no draw-down then it reversed and took stopped me out. Clearly, there was an issue with my HTF assessment. In the image below you can see the trade. On the HTF we had a clean double bottom. So I figured there would be stops to be taken there. If im not mistaken the dollar index showed divergence. Now, in the LTF, price had reached a order block. So I entered short. The entry on a LTF seems to be "easy". It seems like the big problem is interpreting where price is at, and what it intends to do. If you could expand more on that it would be great.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
When price breaks a significant swing, there are three things that should be going thru our minds: Number 1: Market Structure has shifted, we're expecting a turn in price direction.... Number 2: It was a fakeout and liquidity above or below the swing was snatched, we're expecting price to resume its trend... Number 3: A Swing was taken, so price is more likely to run the other way at least at first. When you get enough chart hours you will begin to see it for yourself, and more importantly you'll begin to know which one it is. Usually, in a neat trend with higher highs and higher lows /// lower lows, lower highs, price will eventually f**k the swings up at some point... What you need to find out then is, is the trend still strong or is it weakening because we have confluencing KSR on two or more correlative instruments, or because some stuff is going on in the yield markets or whatever the reason. Usually, as a rule of thumb, double bottoms and tops are extremely suspicious to me... Once you see that, or even better if there are more than two, you'd better be sure that price is gonna go for that.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Oh yeah, I show the LTF, but I've put it in context beforehand. I just never realized it was spread out all over the thread. I share my bias every now and then, and every post I make showing my trades I just base it off that bias.

Just a few conclusions I've reached in my day... Let's see if you people agree or disagree

--- 帖子 #613 ---
strongly agree man. The bit about letting winners turn into losers and managing equity strongly resonates with me. I can boldly say that is the only thing i am currently struggling with at the moment. I watch trades that have gone into "unclaimed" compounded profits of about 500pips turn around and return the profits to the market just because i was too greedy to close the trade at a certain resistance or support level, in hopes that price would break that level and continue in profits. This one problem has caused me so much in profits.. i seem to never want to get out "too early" because it would irk me to see that i would have made much more profits if i had just remained in the trade.. still looking for a remedy to this offspring of greed. i may just have to start targeting a certain risk to reward ratio and closing out trades once i achieve it regardless of if i feel price may continue moving in my favour. no ..... no .... i think i should never cut my winners short, but always let them run ... phew... the problem i'm faced with

--- 帖子 #614 ---
I feel your pain, I used to constantly let winners slip into loser territory, but then I started doing the exact opposite. I started cutting winners short and watching them run for dozens and sometimes hundreds of pips. For me, I think, this issue gets resolved with practice. If you spend enough time observing charts and trends, you'll eventually start getting that inner gut feel harbinger of a dying trend or potentially missed profits. Then again, it depends very much so on what type of trading you're doing. If you're intraday and wish to close during the day (and I personally think it's the only way to trade Forex because of swaps and commissions ripping you off big time with most retail brokers), you needn't be worried that price will overshoot your daily target... Just have to be realistic about what can happen during the day. It's also very important to keep an eye on various calendar events.

--- 帖子 #615 ---
you nailed it just at the end of your comment. i probably wouldn't have this problem if i traded intra-day. However, i tend to prefer holding trades for a longer period of time in order to milk the market for all i can get. will definitely do something about this way of thinking soon. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #619 ---
See this is where it gets interesting. I've been keeping an eye on fundamentals because of my stock trading, but I still rely generally on technicals to trade forex. Markets are real good at predicting large political outcomes. Investors are smarter than the average Joe, and they will price in what the most probable scenario is. After some years of practice, you can actually tell who's winning an election or if a deal can be made on a high level, just by looking at your charts. The French election were weighing in on markets, I'm sure you all knew, for the last few weeks. The break down is such: Lepen &amp; Melenchon are euro-sceptics. Had one of them won, markets would have felt threaten due to a possible explosion of the EZ, with France being the second largest economy in the union. Fillon &amp; Macron, on the other hand, would not have made such a move. Bottom line is: Lepen vs. Melenchon in the second round of the presidential elections - absolutely horrendous for stocks (european and US alike), euro crashes and burns. Lepen vs. Fillon or Macron (as it happened here), is a relief for markets and investors. Mainly because nobody expects Lepen to win. Macron holds the immigrant vote, and is also supported by pro-EU citizens and entities. Markets knew all that long before anybody started saying it, as can be seen by the huge rally in euro stocks and the gap higher in euro pairs.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Anyone trading the GAP ?? I just shorted the EURO

--- 帖子 #621 ---
It's hard for me to say what will happen to the EU right now. On the one hand, it rallied since asia... On the other hand, I do believe that if we see a 1.0950-1.10 by the end of the day with no closing of the gap, this might be it in terms of upside. I expect the gap to be filled, however euphoria over the first round of the elections is still with the markets. Judging by European equities, though, buying is not as intense as it was yesterday. Gold also erased losses by yesterday's close. They say risk is back to markets, and investors are growing more and more confident of a Macron win next week...

Hey WD, Is this a level of demand? Can we see EU and GU reverse? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Thanks Razor

--- 帖子 #631 ---
It's not demand in my book. It is however liquidity. Trump tax plan is in focus... so US equities, dollar are moving higher. I pointed to liquidity building above 1.09; I said if that gets taken out before the correction, I'm expecting a very very limited upside and loads of downside.

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Would you mind explaining a bit further why you don't think this is a demand level?

--- 帖子 #633 ---
This is what I consider demand. Last bearish candle before the rally - that's where all the large market entities' buy orders are set. The reason being, said entities are hedgers: they buy as price is going lower... accumulating large net long positions.

Hey Wdays, the idea of considering the USDX when making trading decisions that involve most USD pairs is very nice and it has helped me a lot. I recently stumbled across a thread on FF which directed me to a broker who provides a sort of Index for other major currencies as well. Great stuff... i'v been using them for a while now just like with the USDX. i don't think you trade much of other currencies asides the USDX but if anyone wants to check it out, it's on the Liteforex mt4 demo ....

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Very late, but it also didn't reach for that liquidity. Ended up as a loser, I let it run without monitoring due to other engagements. It went 1:1 RR, and I did not trail my stop. Stuff happen... However markets are in a bit of a sideways trend between all the expected data - FOMC, NFP, French elections. The water is not ideal for fishing Below is a chart of my reevaluation of the trade - I like to revise trades and ask myself "what went wrong?" It reached for the first level of liquidity, but then followed up by heading up and taking out liquidity above 1.0925 highs. After taking out those highs, price managed to simply correct lower, forming a higher low. I'm flat for now, see where it gets.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
At the same time, if we look at a slightly bigger picture, 1.0885 has been an interesting level with 4 reactions to the level in the last 7 trade days - 3 times it gave support, once it was a resistance price quickly overcame soon after.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
The USDx chart gives a small resistance level over at 99.20 and a much more important level at 99.30. I'd say either FOMC or NFP give USD the boost it needs to either break above 99.30 and whipsaw back below 98.50 or withhold the rally and fill in the gap. It is also important to note how the euro, being the largest weight in the index basket, behaves right after the french presidential election. The second chart represents liquidity.

Hi, can you to share your ptotrade EA.? thx in advance

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Hey guys. New trade week, new setups! Let's see what we can look forward to... Starting at our trusty USDx chart. Now the dollar has been making lower lows and lower highs. It dipped below our listed level (@ 98.90) just slightly, and pulled back to 99.80ish. It then began a new wave down, which we're currently in. Now the way I see it, things might turn bullish real quick if we're not careful, but no sooner than 98.75 (demand). I'd say this week might see some reversal midway in. If it doesn't however, it has a long way to drop until our next DZ over @ 97.20ish. Now I'm typing this as I go with my monday morning analysis, so no jumping to conclusions just yet - we have yet to check out our majors Remember, start at a USDx chart, work our way to Fiber/Cable/yen and cad.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Hi WDays always thanks for you advice and post. I have a question. Sometimes usdjpy don't follow USDX, why it happened so how can we predict it?

--- 帖子 #654 ---
EURUSD Up next, Fiber. Now Fiber is setting up higher highs/higher lows. We have a MS shift with our LT low @ 1.0340-60 roughly as shown by the arrows. What followed was a failure to go higher high just yet, but after price retraced down and formed a higher low, the next wave up took the high. Pullback ensued, another higher low and up to a higher high. Now I was expecting this gap to fill before more upside, but french elections drove EU high and fast, reaching 1.1014 - our Fib level. Apart from that, nothing is holding it; our previous support-turned-resistance level over at 1.0970 was pierced to the upside, and we have a SZ waiting at the 78.6% fib retracement @ 1.1095. This looks like my weekly target for Fiber, for now... But what with USDx setting up for just a slight move downwards, I will be careful going long past 1.1015. Not forgetting there is a gap between 1.0780-1.0820, waiting to be filled, I will approach this week's trading with a slightly bullish bias on Fiber.

The USDx is a weighed index, consisting of 6 major world currencies - eur, jpy, sek, cad, gbp, chf. In terms of volumes traded, the euro trumps all others, thus forming a weight of 58% in the index. JPY is second, with just 14%. So you see, the index will show a much stronger negative correlation with the euro than it will with the yen. Nonetheless, it is important to note USDx direction when trading other pairs too, but also pay attention to any jpy (or other for that matter) drivers. You can read up on it here: http://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/usdx.asp

GBPUSD Now Cable isn't a pair I'm very fond of trading ever since the Brexit referendum, so I haven't really touched it much the past months. What's more it has been in a sideways consolidation range post-Brexit, for the longest time. Recently, though it broke out of that range and began consolidating above 1.2870. It is still not dynamic at all except for some short-lived momentum every now and again. To me, it's politics dictating the pace in this pair. For instance, I believe the June 9 elections are a chance for brits to "correct" themselves and vote against Brexit, by not reelecting May. I believe the rally above 1.2870 is related to just that. If the rally firms, it may well go anywhere from 1.3310 (SZ) to 1.3450 (roughly the cap of the summer consolidation last year). I can't really place the dollar in this particular analysis, since it is not the driver, fueling any of the moves currently. Cable has enough on its hands already for the aforementioned reasons. Technically speaking, a dip to 1.2640 may not be entirely out of the question. However, I expect this week to be relatively quiet despite CPI, claimant count and other GBP news, and prices should stick to ranges.

USDCAD Cad is a pair I reaaaally like due to its dynamics and respect of technical levels in intraday trade. Now something to keep in mind is that CAD is very related to Oil prices... Which have been in a decline for the past month (attached below is a US oil chart for you to see). This brought cad down relative the US dollar, leaving a lot of liquidity void to be filled in the upcoming trading weeks. What's more, Oil is now moving up. We have a couple of resistance-turned-support levels, the first one holding at 1.3570; followed by 1.3500; followed by 1.3440. Last, but not least, we have a DZ down at 1.3325. This week's trading started with a large bearish candle coming down from what seems to be a short consolidation range from almost 1.38 to current price levels. CAD has upcoming data this thursday, which could mean an acceleration of the decline in USDCAD. Until then, in conjunction with my USDx analysis, I'd say it's safe to short at least until 1.3570.

USDJPY Now UJ is currently reacting on geopolitical reasons driving risk appetite. Whenever there is uncertainty in the USA, UJ plummets. Whenever investors are reassured, UJ flies high. It's hard for me to present technical reasons for its rallies or declines since it stopped mid-air after falling to 108.30 in April. One could argue it consolidated over and under 50% of the entire range (large scale one), or it's the tiny support from Nov last year barely halting the decline. Either way, upside was halted by a SZ @ 114.40, we could still make it to 115.30 though.

Hi WDays I like your thread. Just finished reading most of it. Could you clarify how you normally enter a trade. Do place a pending order (e.g. for a long a Buy limit or a Buy Stop)? Or, do you use instant execution?

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Hey, well I use both to be honest. Since this strategy implies we'd be waiting for price to reach certain levels, pending orders are great. Just make sure you account for spread when buying. Instant execution will generally give you a not so great price.

--- 帖子 #667 ---
Thanks for the fast response. I am still having difficulty in deciding on a directional bias. On a daily chart (of for example USDX) one could observe, say, a down trend. However, 30% of the days will still be counter trend. Does this mean that one should actually reassess the trend on a lower timeframe and take positions in that reassessed direction knowing that they are counter trend?

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Hi carling. I think finding a reliable way to assess a directional bias is one of the hardest things to get right. It really depends on the time-frame you are working from. IMO, looking at the Daily and working (entering) on the 30 min is useless. For me, the highest you should go up is a factor of one, if you will. So looking at 30 min, go to H1. For H1, look at H4 etc. A variant on this is the Three Ducks approach, where you look first at, for instance, the Daily and where price is in relation to an ema, then drop to the H4 and do the same. Once - and only once - they line up, then go to the H1. Once that confirms, look to enter on pullbacks on the m15. That's incredibly simplistic and you could probably devote an entire thread to finding a reliable directional bias indicator (as well as Three Ducks) but overall, you get the idea. By the way, if you ever crack this, get in touch, eh, lol! Meanwhile, I'll keep on looking

--- 帖子 #669 ---
I beg to differ. The whole premise for us to look at Daily as our bias-maker is that sustainable trends are seen there. If you read the thread thoroughly, you will understand what I mean. We look for key elements on a D1 chart, before dropping down to our intraday chart (m15 or m5 for me) with an expectation price is supposed to do something. We position ourselves in certain timeframes throughout the day - mostly along with market opens. If you were to look at the hourly while trading m5, you'd just see it a little bit more smoothed. What's more, I already explained how market movers and market makers use D1 and higher for their trading In the examples I have previously shown, you see me talk about how let's say price would react at point A, only to move back to point B, before retreating to point C. What I do there is establish a bias - if it's bouncing higher from point A, I will be going long until it reaches point B, then I will be shorting it to point C. Do you see where I'm going with this?

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Oh yeah, I have no problems understanding this. It serves me right for thread-surfing while bored and sticking my nose in on a whim, lol. Sorry, about that - feel free to delete the post if you feel it just confuses the issue. I think my own methods differ so much from yours here that it's a bit apples-and-oranges. As such, both ways work. Mine for me and yours for you. '' What's more, I already explained how market movers and market makers use D1 and higher for their trading '' Yes, you did and as an ex-Prop Trader, I get that just fine, cheers. I'll just be off back to my own sand-box

--- 帖子 #671 ---
Naturally, whatever works I'm not deleting anything, everybody is entitled to an opinion - especially if what you do works for you. I could never get on-board with the whole MA trading business. I've tried a couple of models, but it's just not my thing. I do use a couple for my stock trading, buuuut technicals aren't really as important as they are in forex. That being said, we focus on horizontal S/R and S&amp;D zones here. I am sure they offer much greater precision in trading than any dynamic S/R (trendlines, MAs...) Think of it as two separate steps, if you will: analyzing market environments is the first step, done on a Daily/H4 most of the time and then entering with a specific method on a lower tf.

I'm flat for the bigger part of the summer, august is one of those months I really dislike, where all the big boys are on holiday and all that's left is a bunch of rookies and algos... Looking to get back into it on a reversal, perhaps. USDx is at the bottom portion of the range, so at support. EU already broke out of its trading range and claimed liquidity resting above it. I will wait to see how it plays out, though.

Hello Fellow traders. I love trading Price Action. Thanks for the thread. I entered GBP CAD couple of days ago and just got out at around 100 pips on H4 chart. Entry and target are marked by the vertical lines on H4. Now I am considering re-entering "Selling" on a retest of H4 as on the weekly chart, there seems to me more movement to retest the horizontal support (White vertical line on weekly". Any ideas.

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Well, H4 on GBP CAD is currently testing previous S/R. But when looking at the monthly chart, there seems to be a big range area where price was ranging for few years. Now I am bit hesitant to ride the bearish trend of H4.

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Now this time with GBP/AUD. On Daily, Price is hovering under the horizontal dash line acting as Resistance. (First Chart) On H4, Price needs to clear a small range and I will short with the break of it targetting the bottom horizontal dashed line on the H4 chart. It will give an excellent risk/reward ration. (second chart) Nevertheless, the range created on H4 charts can be easily traded on m30 for quick profits between the two boundaries. I would favour shorts in this range as the general trend is bearish. (third chart)

--- 帖子 #686 ---
I decided to short the above pair on M30. The risk/reward was very tempting (more than 1:3). There is a possibility price stops me out and head to the first resistance line but it is a fine for me as the Risk Reward ration is great. I am closing the trade at the bottom boundary and then re enter again to short when price congests below the lowest S/R

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Hi sir. Wich books would you recommend for someone to go through. I mean powerful ones of PA. Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #688 ---
The beauty of trading off support and resistance is that even with news time, if the trader is on the right side of the market, nothing to fear. I entered just before GBP news on forex factory calendar. Now I booked 10 pips and trailing price on m15. Not encouraging trading at news time, it is sometimes risky with long spikes hitting stop loss.

GC isn't normally a pair I trade but you piqued my interest! I see why you are wondering. To me, there are mixed signals. If I had a gun to my head, I would say there was a reasonable amount of room below but I'd be more inclined to wait for a pull-back (using H1 cw H4) and try and snatch a few more out of it on a short. However after that, the Weekly resistance seems pretty formidable, though at the moment price is only at the outer edge.

Hi lemercenaire Thanks for your charts and comments. "GC isn't normally a pair I trade but you piqued my interest! " Well, there are lots of gems in minors and crosses . When I trade H4 and dailiy, I don't care about those tiny 0.2 spreads . There so many pairs which make a hundred pip move on H1 and H4. "I see why you are wondering. To me, there are mixed signals.

If you switch to the monthly (I have it posted above), you will find that price has just entered a range with many candles not just two long wicks finding support on weekly chart. This has also made me more confused. I was very tempted to continue this bearish journey and make more couple of hundred pips. Very good opportunity if not for the monthly chart.

Ok. I invite you dear lemercenaire and other sincere PA traders to analyse with me this pair : NZD/USD. Weekly time frame : PA is in a range bounded by the two yellow horizontal lines. Price has also tested 50 percent fibo and heading down. Daily time frame: A very visible Head and Shoulders Pattern presents itself. I am Waiting for a strong break of the neck yellow line and price to retest this S/R. Will keep an eye on H4. H4 time frame: Nothing much at this time to indicate a break. H4 and H1 will be my entry time frame within the next couple of days. Just need one more confluence from those TFs after the break of course.

I'd actually say that on the Weekly tf there initially looks to be a fair bit of room to continue a drop. However, once you add the fib, you can see that we are in a range between 50.0 and 38.2, the latter of which, could give some bounce potential. Dropping to the Daily and H4, this is given much added weight by the areas of demand. Going to the H1 would have me ready to get in on a move long, any time from the next few hours on. Not saying it will go for any huge run but I'd say there is definitely something there over the short-term.

Hello WDays. Thanks for the thread and your reply. I agree with you the whole entire is now filled with demand. Most of the weekly bearish trend started off the 38.2 fibo level on the weekly chart which offered great safer opportunities on H4 but now we have to give a chance for price to see if it rebounds in a series of HL HH or dive down again.

--- 帖子 #698 ---
Hi lemercenaire, Thanks for taking time to analyse NZDUSD. "I'd actually say that on the Weekly tf there initially looks to be a fair bit of room to continue a drop. However, once you add the fib, you can see that we are in a range between 50.0 and 38.2, the latter of which, could give some bounce potential" I definitely agree with u and I am waiting for a break of the neckline (which is on the 38.2 weekly fibo) and a retest. "Going to the H1 would have me ready to get in on a move long, any time from the next few hours on. Not saying it will go for any huge run but I'd say there is definitely something there over the short-term." Well for the H1, I would only be thinking of taking longs in either of two cases: 1- There is at least one HL, HH. 2- Price has touched this level three or more times and bounced off it. So far the look on H1 is very bearish with a series of Lower Highs. Any ways, this pair is a bit slow but is one of those on my watch list. I am glad you did well with the crude. May be share the chart with us when u have time.

Well Done, What a move!. I am assuming you entered after the first long red candle and the green demand area disappeared. In this case, I want to ask you what do you normally do: wait for a retest after such big move or just short with a sell stop?. In case of the latter, I think higher time frames would suggest if the volatility is high enough or not to resume the trend. Thanks for sharing.

Hey man I am sorry to say, but channels have always felt to me like that scribble analysts do on their chart to make it look professional The way I see it, it's a series of higher highs and higher lows - if drawing a channel helps you spot those trends, than more power to ya. But personally, I think it's completely unnecessary and often deluding - channels fail more often than not, unless drawn in hindsight where they're made to fit. On a more serious note, gold is the true safe haven in this world, and beside it being highly speculative because gold futures weigh in on price way more than physical gold, it's good to keep in mind that the gold rally has been thriving on Trump and N Korea related uncertainty which goes on still to this day. Also, seeing as you are a longer term trader, keep in mind Diwali, when trading gold. It's usually a driver for gold around the last quarter. I completely agree on the resistance part, it may however result in a turn. Which is why I'd rather seek opportunity elsewhere I've spent too much time trading risky setups, I'm all for the safe and sweet ones.

Supply and Demand trading is a subject that I'm still interested in despite me giving up on it because I'm having a hard time how to exactly identify an S&amp;D area. I just tell myself this may not be something that will work for me. But I'm still interested in it. So I'd like to ask how exactly do you identify an exact supply and demand area. What exactly does one have to look for in order to determine an exact and precise S&amp;D area. What is the exact and precise thought process that goes into your mind when looking for an exact and precise S&amp;D area. What are the exact and precise set of rules that I must follow when looking for an exact and precise S&amp;D area. So far some of the lessons I've studied about S&amp;D specially about looking for the levels are somewhat broad and general to me. At least for me I haven't seen an S&amp;D lesson that teaches and pinpoints exactly on how to I can find these levels. In the lessons I've read I can tell that there were differences on how the writer or presenter of the lesson finds an S&amp;D level hence making it subjective not objective. Sorry for the long post.

--- 帖子 #711 ---
I waited for the set-up on candle 'A', which was the first to show some real mojo and to break the channel. The next four pushed down but did not clear the other side. While this is going on, I have been down on the m30 and m15 charts and was able to see the levels of resistance stopping the bigger drop (sorry but no copies taken of these charts at the time). This gave me confidence that I had a while to go (if it was going to go at all, which of course I didn't know yet). I then saw the two green candles reverse us back and now I was looking to get involved. Once candle 'B' had moved up and then once more turned down, I went in at around the marked level. I say ''at around'' because at this time I am once more down on the lower time-frames, this time including the m15 and m5. I will use the micros-S+D Zones here to get in at the very best entry I can get. I know the zones are very unstable at these small time-frames but I find them useful used in this way, especially to scale in to positions. The chart with the fib attached shows the initial targets. My reasoning being that I figured I was going to get to #1 at least and the others are pretty self-explanatory. After that, if price cleared what was the lower level of the green zone - which was a Turncoat Zone, remember, so would in essence change from support to resistance - then I could put a locked-in stop there and let the rest run.

Hi marcnathan88, you've kind of answered your own question in the way that you frame it.... ''exact and precise'' . To me, those three words and S+D are kind of mutually exclusive. Your final point about it being subjective, not objective, is also pretty much on the money. However, does this make it any less valid? I don't think so. I do think that it is a technique that requires an experienced eye and more than a fair bit of practice. If that's something that is not in your mindset, than perhaps S+D isn't for you. Now, having said all that, I am in no way an S+D guru. I use a pre-set indi (though I can draw my own zones) and I use it in conjunction with my main methods as often as I use it as a stand-alone. I find it gives the potential for very high probability entries. The main issue you may be finding is the fact that there is no exact and therefore repeatable entry method. This is because these are S+D zones, not lines. That is why I use multiple time-frames to find my actual entries once the main zone has been identified. I am sure there are those here or hereabouts who can give you a much more in-depth breakdown but maybe this answer will go some way to pointing you in a direction that will help you get the full answers you need.

Allright, let me try to help. I can see where your problem is. You are fine with H4 and lower. I think your problem with daily is that you are only considering the last three or four candles. The same way as you analyse h4 and lower is the same with higher time frame. When I do my top down approach, I normally draw the support and resistance lines that are relevant to current PA. With daily candles, you would deal with the last two or three candle formations as a confirmation for instance within the general context of the market structure. Example: On H1 and H4, there is a bearish trend line and price has touched the trend line is expected to go down and there is a dark cloud cover for example . On the daily , there is a doji and hence you get your entry supported by different time frames. But the main thing is that this trend line is valid on both H4 and D1. On the weekly, you have also noticed PA to make the first Lower High and so on... It is the bigger picture of the market and not individual candles on higher time frames.

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Thanks for taking the time to answer. Maybe you're right that it's not in my mindset. Maybe just being interested about it isn't enough. My only issue is in identifying the levels. I'm looking for a set of rules that I can follow when trying to identify a level because I think in trading it's also pretty much about rules. There is a money management rules, rules for entering a trade and many others. But despite S&amp;D not being for me this will always be something that I'll keep my eye on and who knows maybe I can finally learn to put it in my mindset and have that "Aha" moment. For now I think I can settle with the shved S&amp;D indicator. Give it a try on demo trading and see how it works. I hope you don't mind me asking. How long have been using shved and how are you doing with it? I'm interested to know how effective the indicator works. I also see that you're trading it somehow. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #718 ---
Hi again. What I would suggest, is that, yes, use the shved indi and treat it as a '' heads-up '' area that when price approaches it, you know that ''something'' may happen. That's when you can begin to pay attention to that pair. From there, you can run whatever method you are using. If that method involves reversals in any way, then you are onto a winner straight away. Be aware that in the shved indi there is an option to use the Turncoat Zone feature but you will need to add that option, as by default it is turned off. This is really useful for showing continuation moves (as worked for me on The DAX this morning). A Turncoat Zone is one that will change from being support into resistance if / when price pushes through it. I've been using the indi live for a few months now, I think. I must admit to being surprised by how effective it actually is - even in its most basic form. As I mentioned, Hanover coded one that added lots of subtle additions but I have been happy enough with this one that I have never used the newer variant.

--- 帖子 #719 ---
It's great to hear that it's working well for you and take note not on a demo but a live account. Thanks for sharing. I greatly appreciate it. I'll start practicing and demo trading with shved from now on. Also thanks for letting me know what the Turncoat Zone means. I really had no idea what it is. The first time I used the indicator on chart I was surprised to see how price was reacting to these levels. They start stalling and then eventually reversing and moving the other direction. I must also say it's good to have met someone, like you whose doing well with an S&amp;D indicator. I'll be looking forward to all your post here. I'll definitely learn a lot from you. Thanks again and regards.

--- 帖子 #720 ---
No worries. If I can help at all, I will. As I've said, there are without doubt those out there who specialise in S+D and know all the subtleties of the technique - WDays for one - however I am happy to use it the way I do as one part of a larger picture.

--- 帖子 #721 ---
Hi. I usually set up my TP's one of three ways; Either spot a supply/demand area or KSR of any kind and wait for price to reach it. Use a fixed 30/50/100 pip target depending on what kind of range price is in - 100 for HIN or "exotic pairs" (GJ, GA, EA, GCad etc.), 30-50 for EU-GU-EJ. Find a possible liquidity area that price will try to reach and claim, such as a clean level where stops are resting for instance, and where we'd expect a turn-around.

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Hello man, see this post where I explain how to find S/D. (click on the quote to see it in full) If it doesn't clear it up, let me know. Also, see this example of a tested demand area coming from way back in April this year.

--- 帖子 #723 ---
Alright. I expect you read this post here: If you have, then let me try to shed some light. What we want to do is, based on defining market structure, key levels that may act as support or resistance and supply and demand levels, we want to establish an idea about where price may go next. I believe I've also shown a live example on how I do it. I will try to conjure up another live example soon, because right now it would be a hindsight example that nobody wants to see When you're performing HTF analysis, you want to try and think like a market moving entity. Think liquidity or lack thereof, think stops laying around the map. If it were you, where would you push price next? It takes a lot of practice and noting down your analysis over time. You will eventually train your eye so much so that you'd be able to spot those things without giving it too much thought. Don't worry about it, it just takes time.

Even if you are a longer term trader, using the smaller timeframes can be pure gold in terms of entry accuracy. Doing it allows for much tighter stops at the very least. When you're done analysing your higher timeframes (which would in this case probably be weekly-daily-h4), look for the "area within the area", try to be as precise as you can be in entering so that you avoid getting a stop hit. Don't be in a rush to lock breakeven, give price some time to move. Of course, all that being said, I really don't advise trading forex in a longer term, since swap rates and other commissions your broker may take will eat up your gains. I personally believe in a steady but small pip rake every day or every couple of days rather than holding on to a position that may eventually cost me money just for having kept it open so long in the eventuality of a breakeven stop being hit. I find there are much better instruments that cost a lot less to keep in your longer term portfolio - such as stocks or options or even CFD's.

Thanks WDays. Appreciate this a lot. I'll read and study all your previous post where you marked and identify an S&amp;D area. I'll also be looking forward to your future post. I'd like to learn how you identify these levels on the chart.

Hi All, I do understand the support and resistance trading, and feel it as one of the best approaches when combined with price action. I try to trade Daily and 4 hr charts. One thing that confuses me it that we have Daily and 4 hourly Support and Resistances, and we also have similar structures on lower timeframes. For a a trader of higher timeframe (say daily), how should one deal with S&amp;R on lower timeframes. Should they be ignored, or should we be concerned about them and book profit on them and then take and entry again. I need an approach that a higher timeframe trader must follow. Thanks for any help

--- 帖子 #728 ---
High time-frames tell you what to do - low time-frames tell you when to do it.

--- 帖子 #729 ---
Hello. Well obviously higher timeframes will be more reliable, but that doesn't mean small tf S/R are to be neglected. Like I said in one of my previous posts, look for the area within the area. Here's an example on USD-CAD :

hi WDays! man I am getting better and better days by day by practicing these method! now I want to you something regarding the Fibonacci! do we draw it on the Higher to Lower of the Asian session only before London opens?

Hi W! What is your thoughts about the Stop Loss? How do you use it? Its been very hard for me to use a more wide stop loss (psycological effects) but at the end and after lookin to my journal I see that some losses could be winners

--- 帖子 #740 ---
Trying to understand something here so i draw my levels on the daily chart, now i'll wait for price to reach those areas, can i not trade off that same daily chart? when i go to lower time frames, it just gets confusing as i keep saying different patters/trends/candle sticks on lower tfs

--- 帖子 #741 ---
Set it and forget it type of trade, with a 30 pip TP as I was out all day, capitalizing on the post-german elections euro decline.

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Of course you can, but you will have to use a much bigger stop. Smaller timeframes help frame your entry point much better. I would refer you to the "zone within the zone" concept that you can find a link to in the first post.

--- 帖子 #743 ---
I usually use a 20 pip stop, with a 2-2,5% risk parameter. Sometimes I will use a tighter, 10 pip or less if I am really sure the trade will shoot in my direction straight away. Placing a stop is not easy, because in order to have a reasonable stop size, you will have to time your entry pretty well. A few tricks I use to determine how tight my stop may be is, if I'm trading off a fib level, I will place the trade at the 61.8% or midlevel, and I will account for price eventually moving as low as the 78.6%. If I'm trading off a resistance (or support) level, I will account for an eventual stop-swipe move and use a generally larger stop. No matter where the stop is, I will always risk up to 2.5% of my equity. So if I am forced to use a much smaller than usual lot on a trade that requires me to have a very wide stop, I would rather pass on the trade than be stuck waiting for momentum to swing price in the right direction.

I've been getting questions on fibonacci and how to use it, I will try to dedicate a post to fibs one of these days.

--- 帖子 #746 ---
Hi WDays, Thanks heaps for the work you've put into this thread, really appreciate it. Just wondering if you're able to comment on how you would've triggered a short in the early euro session on the EU on both the 25th and 26th September. 25th looks to have hit the 50% fib of the asian range before retreating and on the 26th it retreated almost to the 100%. I'm also interested on how high above the daily high you would set your stop too, so that you avoid any stop hunting. I've been entering during the asian session of late and after coming across thread, do agree that it's a bad idea. I seem to be unnecessarily sitting in trades before they start moving (yesterday I went long/short/long on the UJ, instead of sticking to my guns. if I traded in the early euro session, I would have stuck to my long bias, especially after the 111.50 area failed to break 6 times on the M15) Also, if the euro session is going to show I got the bias wrong, I have a much better chance of avoiding the trade if I wait until the early euro hours. Also, with price targets, do you try and figure out the daily range? I mean it seems that trying to shoot for the max can be good, but most of the time it probably won't work out. I actually had my target on the EU at 17760 on the 26th, but closed at 17768 as soon as I woke up and saw that it bounced a little off 11764. This type of day when the range works out perfectly from the previous H4 swings, are probably rare right? So I'm thinking a 45-50 pip fixed TP might do me better in the long run. I apologize if you've already answered these questions on this thread, I'm still reading through the materials. I hope to be a regular on this thread, as of late I've been trying to trade in a very similar manner (i.e. pick a bias on the D1/H4 and look for an entry on the M15/M1). There's so many more ideas on here that I'll benefit from greatly. Thanks heaps. Cheers, Jason

--- 帖子 #747 ---
Actually I'm using a SL of 20 pips as you, my problem is with the fibonacci and the support/resistance levels. I will try to incorporate your ideia as my trading is similar to yours. My 2 cents about the fib and how to use that. I think people always try to know 'how to use' and then they use them in every swing, and of course the levels will fails and they will say that fibs sucks, they dont realize that what is important to understant is 'when to use'.

--- 帖子 #748 ---
Can you please elaborate further on this? I don't understand what you mean by psychological levels. Thanks for creating this thread!

--- 帖子 #749 ---
I mean what I said in brackets the 00, 20, 50 and 80 levels. The 1.20, 1.10 levels hold a significance for the euro. The 1.1980, 1.2020 levels are institutional levels. Institutions and traders both like round numbers. And there's a rational explanation - it's just human nature.

--- 帖子 #750 ---
Pretty much, yes. That's what I meant too.

--- 帖子 #751 ---
Well on the 25th, I actually took a short in the morning and I showcased it here: As for the 26th, I would hate to point to hindsight entry ideas as I did not take a short then. But if I would have to, daily open on the 26th is located at 1.1858. We're working within the premise that euro is declining (German elections, like I said in the previous post). Before that, price went to that same 1.1858 level and reacted to it. So when price went and tested it the next morning, it probably should have been clear that we wouldn't see it go far above the open. As for your other questions; I don't set my stops above the daily high. That would be an extremely large stop I avoid stop hunting by taking part in stop hunting, lol. Trying to guess daily range, it's hard. It really depends on the environment I'm working with, what I gotta do during the day, whether I'm expecting HIN and so on. I usually love my standard 30 pip TP on majors and as big as 50 on exotic crosses. Sometimes I will give a trade more time to reach a set level that I deem should be reached, but that usually stresses me out more than I'd like since it means trailing stops and what not. I hope I've managed to answer you more or less well.

This may be a dumb question but what does M15 and M5 mean?

--- 帖子 #754 ---
Okay, got it. I thought so but wasn't sure. Thanks for clarifying.

--- 帖子 #755 ---
Not sure if you are serious, but in case you are M15 = 15 minutes and M5 = 5 minutes.

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Thanks. I am still trying to get used to some of the lingo here. I am familiar with 15 minute and 5 minute charts but I never seen it described as M15 and M5. Sometimes acronyms and such can throw one for a loop. Humble yourself. Not everyone has been doing this for years.

--- 帖子 #763 ---
Hey WDays, New member here, long time stalker of your thread. Thanks for sharing that beautiful trade. In fact, i was long in that same trade too but I got stopped out. Reason why i was long is due to the fact that the dollar index was at a strong resistance area and the eurusd was at a strong support which I didn't see them breaking through both without a strong fundamental data. I also figured the area below 1.1680 (where my stop loss was located) should help push back any spiked pre and post data release. My question is good sir, how off was my analysis? and if you do not mind, could you share with us your thought process before you took that trade? Thanks alot and keep up the good work

--- 帖子 #764 ---
You're right about the KSR, but there's something more to it. I had plotted out two scenarios for the NFP to play out.. The one I acted upon was this one:

--- 帖子 #765 ---
Scenario #2: The other thing I was sort of expecting was a lower fiber after a liquidity swipe on the 15 minute. It missed my sell limit at the level, so I waited it out a bit and saw it struggle to move much lower. Meanwhile I checked the data and it turned out it's mixed. I ended up instead using this scenario's levels as my targeted levels.

--- 帖子 #766 ---
Sometimes trading HIN news can be much easier. In my head, it's obvious what's gonna happen - other times I plan out several ways it can play out and decide which one to act on based on experience and instinct, after seeing hundreds of market reactions to HIN. In friday's NFP trade, I was wrong. I expected much more volatility. But I adapted, which is why I still posted the live youtube video - to give you an idea of how dynamic things can be, and how to adapt. I show you my decision making process, since that's what brings profit to our accounts.

Market structure shifted, let's wait for price to get "in the zone"

If you guys are paying attention, you should be getting this by now... 1. Fake low that went lower than the previous one by just a bit 2. Rally that took out a recent swing high thus making for a market structure shift. 3. Retrace expected into a fib/demand level. 4. Continued rally to the previous swing high.

It's ironic, but this thread helps my trading as well. Keeps me exactly from losing focus on what matters! Everybody goes through rough patches in their trading, that's the problem with FX, you can't just go 100% winrate and never lose a dime. Sometimes we go through losing streaks, no matter the experience and practice we have. Experience and practice helps you cope with the losers better....

Forex trading packs way more risk, so I wouldn't trade large amounts in forex. Stocks are more laidback and if you can manage anywhere between a 5-8% monthly return, you're set for tons of gains.

Hi Wdays, would you like to update your analysis on eurjpy h4, i am looking for the resistance, and i am a bit confuse so need your help. thank you

--- 帖子 #800 ---
It will probably take a lot of explaining, but here's what it is. 1. Remember when I talked about the three types of market? Which one do you think applies for this here pair, if you look at a daily chart? 2. If you assumed correctly, then what is price to do in such a situation? The large resistance comes, of course at the 134.40 level. There are plenty of smaller, less significant resistance levels. But think of what I'm showing you in this thread this way: KSR, Sz/Dz, Fibo, market structure - all of those things are components of a bigger picture. It's when you learn how to utilize them in synergy that you will be able to foretell market direction.

--- 帖子 #801 ---
Alright, here's what I'm going to try to do by the end of the year: We already covered Market Structure and Fibonacci in youtube videos, I will try to make a video on Supply/Demand Zones and one on market liquidity. Those will be the 4 pillars around which this "system" is structured. I will then try to make one last video which will feature a recap on all 4 "pillars" as well as how to implement them all together on live charts. Now, given that markets aren't ideal around holidays I am not sure if I'll be able to do that by the end of the year, so the last video may come in next year. Furthermore, I will try to completely revamp the first post, in an attempt to summarize the entire purpose of this thread as clearly as possible.

Hi there Wdays Hereby i attach usdcad h4 chart. Let me know your opinion. Did i draw my chart in the correct way? Thank you Sorry for my bleh english.

--- 帖子 #808 ---
If it's Sz/Dz you are trying to spot, you did it the other way around. Supply = last bullish candle before a decline, Demand = last bearish candle before a rally. Like so:

--- 帖子 #809 ---
Remember this market structure, it happens a lot. Remember what it looks like after it's happened, so you know how to act next time it's happening.

--- 帖子 #810 ---
Fantastic! I will take a note on what happen next on eurusd. Thank you Wdays for your feedback, i really appreciate it.

--- 帖子 #811 ---
is this one kind of the same patter as eurusd but in smaller time frame happening right now? as a market is fractal its looks similar imo

--- 帖子 #812 ---
Keep in mind this pattern signals the beginning of a market structure shift. Unless there are other reasons to factor in, it would be unwise to put ourselves out there and risk money. It will take a break of a swing high and a creation of a higher swing low after the retracement for me, personally to get in. Otherwise this, below, may happen In your screenshot, we're obviously in a downtrend for now.

--- 帖子 #813 ---
now it could fit for an example isnt it? i think i got the idea u wanted to say, we need to wait untill market make new higher high and higher low to take it as that patter that u said... thnks for that

--- 帖子 #814 ---
Yep, now wait for the retracement

This looks like the big players are looking for liquidity. Would you agree? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #819 ---
If you mean to say looking to fill up the void, then yes, you're right

--- 帖子 #820 ---
For me, Aussie is in a "no touch zone" - it's sitting on daily support. Like I've always said, when in doubt, wait for confirmation It can come in the shape of a break in MS, or it could break down the level it's sat at.

--- 帖子 #821 ---
I was thinking the break of the right shoulder of the head &amp; shoulders pattern is a break against the dominant pressure (on this timeframe) &amp; the big players brought price below the orange line to get longs to sell out and to trap new short sellers. That's why I thought big players were looking for liquidity. Obviously there's a big void as well which will get filled at some point I would think, but.....and I really can't put this into more technical terms, but big moves tend to not get countered so quickly. Anyway I've only watched the liquidity video once. Before these posts I planned on watching it several more times.

--- 帖子 #822 ---
Oh I see, yes, you are right in the shorter term. Sometimes there are quiet sessions like today, where the main goal is to strike out retail traders by setting up what would appear to be breakout trades, only to fake traders out of their positions. Wonder if there will be enough kick for such a development today (minus the decline), or they will leave it off for later on.

--- 帖子 #823 ---
So glad you agree with me...and presently price action agrees too. See I told you I learned something from your video Still gonna watch them a few more times. Thanks WDays!

--- 帖子 #826 ---
Thanks again for replying to my follow up post. I spotted a place where the big players were looking for liquidity which is great but I had no idea where to put a target for going long. Your reply with a chart and the fib retracement lines cleared that all up. Approx. 10 min. ago price just went up to the 61.8 fib level. I either missed that in your liquidity video or perhaps you didn't include it. I still haven't watched the video a 2nd time, this weekend for sure....actually I'm going to try to re-read this entire thread.

--- 帖子 #827 ---

wday, thanks for the video. I appreciate it that you share your knowledge with us. Cheers

--- 帖子 #829 ---
No, you're right it wasn't mentioned in the liquidity video. We covered that in the fib video. I showed you market taking out liquidity above the recent highs, drew the fib with the expectation of a retracement, which as we already said should reach inside the 61.8 - 78.6 fibo levels.

--- 帖子 #830 ---
hi wdays! yesterday, after watching one of your videos, i slapped a fib on the hourly chart of gbpnzd......waiting for the retracement. as you can see by the circle, price hit 70.2 fib EXACTLY and began going up again!! i am a HUGE fan for sure!! my question: how do you predict how high price will go? as you can see, i got in too early (around the 38.2 fib) and got out too early!! i got in again and AGAIN got out too early!! still made over 200 pips on this pair and augjpy overnight, but need alot of practise on entries and target!! thank you VERY much for this thread and your time and effort!! p.s. i placed the purple fib on the most recent hi and low on the hourly (the light blue line shows the main fib levels)

Hello everyone, I updated the first post a little bit. Youtube videos are in focus now. Two more videos left, the one on KSR/S&amp;D zones and a major recap on everything, featuring live examples - a rather big project that may take longer. I will also do a little something on trading psychology and trading mindset based on my own personal experience, kind of like the x-mas special I released last december. You can find it in the thread, or in my youtube channel - www.youtube.com/1337WD Have a good weekend

Thank you Wdays for your video. Could you please look at USDJPY, i found a demand there ( the last bearish candle before a rally), i hope it right, but i dont know. Let me know your opinion.

--- 帖子 #836 ---
Hi there, for some reason I completely forgot to answer, I'm so sorry. Well for one thing, I don't use the 38.2 and 23.6 levels. I focus only on the 61.8 to 78.6 area, that's my cue to enter. As far as exits and targets, I've mentioned in a few of the videos that I use different tactics. Sometimes I will use a preset TP when I'm not expecting a large move, I will target old highs or lows, or maybe S/D zones... One thing is sure, I won't use fibs for my exits, nor will I use ADR or any other completely random tool to time my exit. In my opinion, targetting levels of support or resistance (and what I mean by that is a level where I expect price may reverse or halt) is the most accurate. However, when you do that, there's always a chance that an intraday trade turns into a swing trade, which carries its own risk (of stop hunts being executed, fat thumbs and so on), and essentially. I've said it before, I don't really think anything outside of intraday or perhaps very short term swing trading (a couple of days or so) fits Forex trading, because there are nearly no brokers that offer reasonable swaps and commissions for positions held over night. And if I pay the equivalent of a few pips in terms of swaps and commissions and my trade goes to b/e, I tend to get more upset than if I had just gotten out much sooner.

It's nice to see new people taking up interest in the thread. What you need to remember is, all the tools displayed throughout the thread are meant to be used in conjunction. You can't just solely rely on one component, in order to make the most out of this method (I dare not call it a system), you have to work it all simultaneously. And I know it's hard, and there's a lot to absorb, but there are no shortcuts. The picture may only become clear once you've gotten the hang of everything we're talking about in here. So take the time, demo or even paper trade the markets looking for these patterns. I can only point them out for you, the rest of the effort should be carried out by each and every aspiring trader.

Spot supply on gbpusd, what do u think Wdays? thank u

--- 帖子 #845 ---
hi alex, after we define supply/demand zone. how to differentiate which one will hit that supply/demand zone and retrace and which one will go through? what should we aware and anticipate? thanks

--- 帖子 #846 ---
Alex, Cant do charts right now because I'm at work but... I tried analysing DXY over the weekend. I concluded that on the weekly, the index was sitting right at a demand zone and the most likely scenario was an initial dip into that zone around 92.5 followed by a rally up to supply in the 94 area On that basis, I concluded that the EURUSD would likely rally a bit and then fall this week. That's enabled me to set up 2 fire and forget trades this week. 1) a long EU @1.1902 which never hit 2) a short EU @ 1.19607 (H4 Supply) which hit perfectly and got me 40 pips and today... 3) another short @ 1.1873 (H1 supply and expectation of continued DXY strength) is currently 45 pips up with TP @1.1810 I'd be interested to know if this is a complete fluke or does it match up with your own expectations.

2/3 of the position is off at 33 pips profit, holding a small amount til the 40 pip TP or b/e. Risk free anyway.

Took off the rest for 16 pips before it got to my stop.

I hope we see gap filling today..

--- 帖子 #851 ---
I've built my daily positions around this trade - got GU and UJ also. I want EURGBP to rally and USDx to decline.

--- 帖子 #852 ---
Unfortunately, my trade idea did not work out. I cut off all positions and got stopped on UJ for -20

--- 帖子 #853 ---
It's good to know im screwed cuz i just opened long @1.1839

--- 帖子 #854 ---
Not necessarily, market is pretty much rangebound, just in a large and wide range. I hate it when it does that because momentum is slower and it gets you to question your trade decisions even more. Yes, we all question our decisions no matter how advanced or not we are.

--- 帖子 #855 ---
It seems 'gap must be filled' myth often fails these days. I guess that's because it's wide spead to retailers these days. Big boys take advantage on that as usual....

--- 帖子 #856 ---
It still works fine on stocks, it's a big part of my strategy. Forex.. not so much, yeah.

--- 帖子 #857 ---
Yesterday's EU london open trade, unfortunately price whipsawed above the high of the day and took me out for 10 pips, instead of my 30 pip TP. I've had a hard time landing good trades this week, I didn't get a fill on GU short yesterday and got me upset. No trades until next week, payrolls inc today.

--- 帖子 #858 ---
When in doubt check the Commitment of Traders index. Commercial Net longs were increased late november, as dollar was moving lower.

--- 帖子 #859 ---
Dollar reached a Sz and started to move lower, while Fiber went to a Dz and turned. I've denoted a possible rebound level for dollar to rally from and Fiber to decline from. Now, time will tell.

--- 帖子 #860 ---
hi wdays, please correct me. you mean you are expecting fiber at some point will go south? and dollar will go north? thanks

--- 帖子 #861 ---
hi wdays, which we should focus to watch? commercial or large for the direction of dollar?. is it large net short (going south) mean dollar will go south too? please elaborate more. thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #862 ---
I generally watch both, I only disregard the retail traders (Small Speculators). Large Speculators (LS) are usually trend followers, while commercials (CS) are hedgers. So for me, LS show me the "now" in terms of trend, while CS warn me of potential trend shifts.

--- 帖子 #863 ---
Yes, I am expecting /hoping/ fiber will rally to 1.1850 and decline from there. It's my weekly trade idea.

--- 帖子 #864 ---
thanks wdays

--- 帖子 #865 ---
GU trade idea, buy the dip, hold until the last high.

--- 帖子 #866 ---
UC trade idea, short from Sz to Dz in order to fill the liq void.

--- 帖子 #867 ---
may u explain why u see that view? is it for the trend line + daily key level?? thnks

--- 帖子 #868 ---
Which one do you mean? I don't use trendlines as dynamic S/R. If it's UCad you're talking about, there's a daily supply zone right under a key resistance level. Then, there's a demand zone below, at 1.2720

--- 帖子 #869 ---
Thnks for ur answer, i was asking for cable but its good to know also for usdcad

--- 帖子 #870 ---
Cable is roughly the same, H4 Dz (the green trendline) and support on the upper side of the consolidation range we see at roughly 1.3290. Price is moving slow, I suspect it may move up intraday into the m15 Sz @ 1.3395 and shoot down to the aforementioned 1.3290 level, taking out liquidity below 1.3320 and resulting in a neat intraday trade . EDIT: Just as I was typing it, it actually broke thru 1.3320 )

--- 帖子 #871 ---
As far as Fiber, I've the feeling a retrace back to 1.1750 will thrust price higher, to 1.1830 at least or ideally, 1.1850, where I would short.

--- 帖子 #882 ---
I closed my EU also, way before TP but got roughly 40 pips over two positions.

--- 帖子 #883 ---
I want to be flat before FOMC. I have pending buys on EU and Cable, as well as a pending short where my long target is on Fiber. Let's see how it plays out.

--- 帖子 #884 ---
Fed is expected to hike rates, so be careful as we’re setting up for a very volatile fomc. I moved my buy limit even lower, hoping that I catch the falling knife as it loses steam and I don’t get cut. Good luck, heading out for now.

--- 帖子 #885 ---
The volatility can be very high but I think the impact of the hike wont be very strong as the inflation came below expectations, this decrease the probability of the 2018 interest rates increases. Fed will also upgrade the inflation projections and if it comes weak the hike today can have the opposite effect as happened with the BoE interest rates hike. We can ignore this as daytraders but is always good to share

--- 帖子 #886 ---
Pretty spot on and I almost regret killing my trades earlier. Would have made a killing from being long on eu over two positions and short on uj.

--- 帖子 #887 ---
Hi WDays. I'm new to this. I'm just using this chart for learning purpose. I'm not quite understand why open the trade. correct me if i'm wrong. this is what i understand 1st this chart is uptrend. 2nd uptrend chart buy at the dip. which is purple area? I know with fib which is at 61,8-78,6. but from the last leg? I look at your youtube video, you open trade like the MM where the stop be. I'm sorry i know this is seems like i didn't read the thread. but I saw your the pictures, and my mind is jumping around.

--- 帖子 #892 ---
WOW ... niceeee... i really like your analysis.

--- 帖子 #893 ---
so did you sell the EU and got stopped or did you manage to pass that one?

--- 帖子 #894 ---
I took a 20 pip stop on EU but still holding UJ on the positive side, though. Tax-vote going on today, so I expect some sort of dollar related volatility. My focus is on major pairs for the week. I will post charts in a bit.

--- 帖子 #895 ---
So essentially, what happened was, the EU short trade was negated simply because of poor timing. What happened in fact - dollar swipes below the low, hits right into the H4 Dz, retreats, pulls back lower, and hopefully aims for the liquidity above 94.15 My bias remains unchanged. I strongly believe that with the pending tax vote, this is the market's way. The same scenario can be seen on EU and GU. Let's see if you guys can spot what I mean.

--- 帖子 #896 ---
i guess you think, that for example the EU market will aim for the 1.167 level (magenta line) in the long run. i think the same but wouldnt short it before it visits at least 1.186 (not marked in my example) and i think when it shoots through the upper resistance level (blue line) i wouldnt want to short it anymore. kinda the same for GU, i look for possible shorts between 1.339 and 1.34. Would be interesting to see what you think about this. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #897 ---
+52 realized. I won't risk a reversal at this level due to price action on the left.

--- 帖子 #898 ---
I agree with you Except I would short EU from 1.1840-50. It's late december, so probably such a move will not be taking place unless some speculative drive kicks in the market. Usually, the couple of days between Christmas and New Year's Eve are pretty speculative. So for now, I'm shorting, but not reaching for the liquidity that I have highlighted. I took a breakeven on cable yesterday, after price going 50 pips my way, so kind of recovering from that.

--- 帖子 #915 ---
This is the strategy with accuracy.

--- 帖子 #916 ---
Simplest way to put it; Consolidation is price settling down after trending, accumulation is market movers slowly building their positions to run price further.

--- 帖子 #917 ---
Dude, seriously?!

--- 帖子 #918 ---
Maybe you already have some charts to illustrate it. It would be kind enough to show in further charts about " accumulation "

I recently opened a demo account at FOREX LTD so I could have access to a USX chart so I could follow along with your posts and try to look for trade opportunities that you would look for. The 4 hr USDJPY chart you posted not too long ago doesn't look up to date. Attached is the same chart from ProRealTime. Is the difference due to FOREX LTD being closed (I don't know that they are, I'm assuming they are)? Or is there something you have to do with MT4 charts to get up to date data? I've never used MT4 charts before opening the demo account with FOREX LTD.

--- 帖子 #923 ---
Well you have to take into account the fact that different brokers may have different work days during holidays like what we had last week. Some may be open on the first of january, others won't. The one that I use to trade shows gaps, whereas fx ltd co uk doesn't appear to have any at first glance. Then there's the timezone that the broker uses. Fx ltd co uk is a GMT broker, meaning there can be some offset with other brokers that do GMT +2 (like FXDD). So yeah, charts may end up different. And the difference can usually be seen in the 4 hour and higher timeframes. I started using fx co uk ltd for my charting because it seems the most adequate. I take trades on another broker, though. Edit: oh wow my chart feed really is indeed off holiday got me tired, but it least it proves what I was saying

--- 帖子 #924 ---
I reopened ProRealTime and they changed the data for Jan 1st. I highlighted the difference in the ellipse. Still don't have a live feed with FOREX LTD. Maybe I gotta wait for the London open.

Looking at 4 hr timeframes, the EURUSD took out yesterday's high while USDX has so far failed to makes a new LL. Would the break of yesterday's high on the EURUSD be a fade opportunity? Is this one of the ways you use the USDX to help you with looking for setups on the EURUSD? Edit: USDX got closer to yesterday's low as I was typing. Let's see if it holds.

--- 帖子 #932 ---
I posted a fiber chart on my twitter yesterday, saying that if the daily supply managed to hold and turn price, we may be seeing further bearishness. However, price only came back slightly above yesterday's open, and essentially, fiber closed bullish. I now believe we may see higher PA on euro. The reason the highs and lows don't match is that the euro rally is not related to dollar weakness, but rather euro strength. Which is why most other majors aren't moving as much. Longterm, I am bearish dollar. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DTLiEltXcAIGnPO.jpg:large

--- 帖子 #933 ---
The way I use USDx, and there will be more on that later on in the year, is I compare key levels and S&amp;D zones. Basically, if there is one on EURUSD but nothing on USDx, I doubt it will be that respected. So even though USDx managed to strengthen yesterday afternoon, it didn't really bounce off a relative level, meaning the correction is somewhat shortlived and cannot be trusted. Furthermore, when using the USDx, we have to keep in mind that since it's a weighted basket with fiber holding the largest share, there needs to be a very strong impulse move on the index, in order for all other currencies to be lead by the dollar. Something note worthy is using EURGBP in determining whether to take a trade on EURUSD or GBPUSD, it's something a lot of people do.

Yes, except you're looking at a 5m chart. And if you zoomed out, you'd see that this entire construction is part of a consolidation. But generally speakng, whenever range tightens we can soon expect an expansion.

yup it's a shame what has happened to this thread but then again he wanted to keep it for educational purposes only.

--- 帖子 #953 ---
I disagree. It's really no shame that I let this thread die out. While creating all the material, I realized I wasn't doing anybody any favors. Seeing all the messages I kept receiving in my inbox made me kind of sad that real people, with real lives have their hopes built up to such an extent, they are hopping through threads in the forum, trying out this system here and that system there, hoping it would help them improve and start making those big bucks real soon, so they could retire early. This logic is flawed on so many levels, because it's entirely based on desperation and the determination to get rich fast. As soon as someone offered a more distant approach, like not letting them know which indicator cross-over they needed to watch out for in order to open a buy or a sell, they run away from that thread like they're on fire. People want systems &amp; not to actually put in work and understand what's going on. Unfortunately, this only goes to their detriment. And I do not wish to uphold and feed people's delusions which can cost them more than just some money. ____________________________ To those of you, willing to put in the time and effort to build their way up, I suggest we start from scratch. But first let me answer the people inboxing me on here &amp; twitter: I do not wish to capitalize from any mentorship programs. I will not hold secret skype chats, with small groups of people paying me to teach them how to trade. I do not wish to prove anything to you or whoever. I'm only doing this in my free time, for whoever wants to take a moment and listen/read. The content is up there, on Youtube, since it's easier for me to get through to you while talking/showing a presentation coupled with live examples. All of the content will be public, I will answer (pertinent) questions if there are any first chance I get. Besides I don't think what I've got to show you is very appealing to the FF crowd, since... well I ranted enough about that above. The idea is to truly help people improve, not just bring them more and more delusions about something that is cloudy enough as it is.

--- 帖子 #954 ---
I've seen so many people get lured into this world, myself included once, thinking “lol, it's easy, just gotta make 10 pips/month with tons of leverage and #BRBGOINGTOTHEMOON”. And that's because there's so much info out there, it's overwhelming enough as it is to go and look for a proper education. We want to put ourselves out there and start making money. We open a demo account, then fiddle around with it for a few days, score some quick cash and think to ourselves “why am I still working that dead-end job, when I could be doing this every day day-in and day-out”. We open the real account with a small amount of money, and find a broker that offers as much leverage as possible . Waste the account and either quit, or fund another one, this time trying to read up a little – generally in the interwebs and ForexFactory among others. We find some cool looking, very colorful chart with loads of different indicators out there, in one of the many Trading System threads that exist, slap the template on and go for round #2... ...which ends just the same way. We start hopping from one system to the next, never stopping to think what we're actually doing wrong . Now, having read that, if you thought it sounded just like you, keep reading. I'm about to tell you what you're doing wrong... And you're not going to like it. At all. Trading is serious business and should be treated as such. Time for a reality check, before we go any further. This is going to be the start of an entire series of boring, finance &amp; economy lectures, that nobody wants to hear or has time for. Yet without this knowledge, you cannot be profitable. Not in the long run, anyway. As I was going on, I already mentioned some of the biggest mistakes people who are new to this fall victim to. If I had to shortlist them, it would be something among the lines of: Not being prepared and/or having little to no idea WTF you're doing. Not taking the time to get to know the world of investing. Not getting to know the fundamental basics that drive markets, because hey, who needs to when we can trade with a simple chart Using hugeass leverage to trade, without understanding what “leverage” truly is. Only looking at what gains you could earn by opening a position, without taking into account the fact that the position may just as well go against you and crush you. Never ever hedging and/or diversifying your portfolio (trading 1 currency pair is all you need to make a living... yeah right) Starting out waaay too undercapitalized, hoping profits will grow the account fast enough. Using crappy (and free) trading tools And the list goes on and on. I'm not even going to go in on most of the problems “trading mentors/teachers/gurus” usually talk about (you should trade with the “smart money”; “you need to keep a journal”; “you need to have good Risk/Reward parameters”) . I think they really don't matter if you're completely new and looking to improve. At the end of the day, trading is psychological. And once you know your way around the financial world, it's only then you can begin working on the aforementioned “pro” traders' advice. Otherwise it would mean nothing to you.

--- 帖子 #955 ---
Well said bro. That is exactly what I have found time and again and again and again. I meet traders all the time who want help. But when you try and help them and they realise you are offering "real help" that comes with real work, with thinking and learning and not the kind of BS help that is out there they hit the road, looking for the next best thing. The vast majority want the "instant fix", just like their instant coffee, hence the reason the vast majority fail. They are not interested in learning, they just want an indicator to tell them when to get in and when to get out. They are not interested in learning to fish, they just want the fish. "At the end of the day, trading is psychological"... This is all trading is. 90% psychology, 10% strategy.

--- 帖子 #956 ---
I fully agree with you, but I think everyone should go through that process and that takes time. it is a fight with yourself. and if you sustain long enough, the puzzle pieces slowly fall into place. but that can take years! learn to loose !!

--- 帖子 #957 ---
That's not exactly true, because when people get into it for all the wrong reasons, they inevitably fail. And once they fail, it doesn't take too long for them to quit and call it a gamble. It's all about built-up expectations vs the cold hard reality of the business. Trading is boring af, it's not some super intense party. It's ever changing - nowadays, intraday trading on an institutional level is mostly automated. So most people look for an edge, just so they can go up against computers and get robbed. All that because they think/are told "trading should be easy".

For anyone that not yet put entries on nzdusd, could you guyz check on it, i already have floating , maybe not patient enough just entries based on fibonacci, i did sell and closed all, got few profits, then resell again. Check on weekly chart and daily chart. Ok so i upload daily and weekly chart. If this right then good for us, take this as a gift to you and your family, but if this wrong, then sorry really. We can only try and try and study. Possibility of sell on nzdusd, there are 13 traders viewing this thread now while i am uploading my screenshot

Ok I understand now how to identify market structure and where to wait for an order, now the question is how do we define a profit target?

Some people in forum give target income or realised profit in trades in percentage terms. That's realistic and totally objective to compare results or performances if your account size is big enough.
