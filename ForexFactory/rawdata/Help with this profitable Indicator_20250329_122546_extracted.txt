Hello Traders, 2months ago I found this indicator and I'm using it in my trading. I have my own rules for use it but I feel the indicator have more potential. I want to share my idea and the indicator for those that want to make it more profitable. First I going to explain rules, feel free to modify for better use. Time frame: 1 Hour System Pairs: Any For Buy -You need wait a bar to cross the +100 level of the indicator. Take long after candle close. -Don't take the signal if already been 6 bars before. Only take inside the first 5 bars cross For Sell -You need wait a bar to cross the -100 level of the indicator. Take short after candle close. -Don't take the signal if already been 6 bars before. Only take inside the first 5 bars cross. Exit -You can go for TP, like 50 pips or what you want. -You can go signal by signal Stop loss -Personaly I don't use stop loss because in a opposite signal I close the trade and take a new one. Some times the price will go back -60 pips or a little more but later it goes to profit if the indicator don't change. I don't close the trade after a valid signal occurs, the indicator can change red to green to red many times but if there is no valid signal I keep the trade. Hope somebody can improve the system. Cheers

Thank you for sharing your method, Invermac... A quick look on your indicator/strategy rules suggests it's a sound method...I'll need to test it for a few days though before I can think of additional filters or modifications..Regards

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Thank you Inceptionist! ok do what you want to do, lets make a better strategy. good day

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Hello, I take a short in EURJPY, I have an account in other plataform but I see the signal in MT4 still in profit. TP 50

--- 帖子 #5 ---
good indi for breakout trading, but i think it will be disaster in ranging market, just imo

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Hello Cendol, I think is for trend trading, and it is good too in ranging, check the pic. I think there is no perfect indi or analysis for ranging market

--- 帖子 #7 ---
The problem with these type of indicators is that they repaint backwards. signals that appear just in Two bars, in real time appeared like 6 to 7 bars. if you forward test this you will see for yourself

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Hello Esosa, This indicator not repaint and the signal appears when the candle close and a new one opens. Check by yourself, I make good trades today with this indicator only I want is a kind of filter or something. Greetings

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Hi Invermac, ​ Thanks for sharing. I cant seem to download these files or find them at forexwot. Any Ideas?

--- 帖子 #10 ---
sometimes arrows appear on my charts, most of the time ......nothing

--- 帖子 #11 ---
hello lalala, The files are attachet in the first post please check it. Greetings

--- 帖子 #12 ---
hello kaiser soze, Arrows? there is not arrows in this strategy, check the attached files in the first post, only one indicator with no arrows and template. Greetings

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Hi Invermac,​ I see that, but they will not download properly. The awesome one gets a message saying it is damaged, or wasn't decoded properly. Also which one is it that you are using? Anyone else having this problem?

--- 帖子 #14 ---
just in case like January 26, what we got is a false signal to follow. this indi need another backup to filter from "badluck". Attached Image (click to enlarge) how if i using this fractal-based no repaint indi just to filter them? as i see if today price breakout .8900, so be aware to take a sell potition when the red bar already passed -100 Attached Image (click to enlarge) edit : i using this indi just to filter them Attached File(s) Rail Indi.ex4 32 KB | 1,482 downloads

--- 帖子 #15 ---
haven't tested this filter so try it only on demo....I'm set the TMA1 PERIOD at 7 and TMA Period2 at 13.....Price as "weighted".....seems to smooth it out.....also, indicator is MTF

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Excellent on AU:

--- 帖子 #17 ---
same chart but with ema 100:

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Cendol, the indicator have some false and negative trade like all indicator, check later the long after the negative sell, it is been the double pips of your lose trade, maybe you lose -50 pips but then the long give you +80 pips or a little more. The sell signal of your second picture only takes in the first cross, if you see a pullback then a new sell cross you don't take that sell, only the first cross. Hope we can make a good convination of indicator to create a powerful strategy, thank you for your effort! greetings

--- 帖子 #19 ---
hi lalala, Here the template, hope this works

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hi kaiser soze, I will check your filter if this improve the indicator, if we can make a less false signals we have a very powerful strategy. Thanks for your idea. Greetings

--- 帖子 #21 ---
​ Hi Invermac, Still getting the same message here. Where did you get it from?

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Hi lalala, you have problems with the indicator or template? the awesome is a template, paste the file in templates folder and the snipper in indicator folder. A friend give me one folder with many indicator and I got it from there. I search the system in the web site but I still can not find it. greetings

--- 帖子 #23 ---
took long gy:

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Nice trade, it have a maximum of 40 pips. Did you take the short? +100 pips

--- 帖子 #25 ---
hye i have placed snipper.ex4 in indicator folder.still not working for me because MQL4 file with same name missing.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hi and thanks for sharing! Have you tried lower TF's? I played around a M5 chart today with mixed results. Maybe adding a Donchian (20 period) indicator and using the opposite resistant level as your TP/SL? This way you can enter a trade with a clear SL and you will also be abletofilter out a lot of the false breaks. Thoughts? See below screenshot. You would've had placed only two trades today, one BE and the sscondforwellover 100 pips. I'll take a look at other pairs and TP's Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #27 ---
My biggest concerns are ranging markets. I took a quick look at GU during Jan 20th - 22nd when the pair was pretty dead and although I had about a 90/10% ratio of losses, I was only down about 250-300 pips which is very good for that crappy ratio! Afterwards, things looked a bit better and days like todayor January 26th were amazing. I'll take a look at a few more indy's with a focus on trying to find something that will help avoid false breakouts. Do you happen to have the code for the indicator? Thanks

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Hi adnankabir, try to close your mt4 after paste the indicator in indicators folder and open again your plataform. Maybe this helps. Greetings

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hello Shemski, looks interesting in 5 min with donchian channels. I think this time frame is for scalping and maybe works with your modification to let run the profits because this indicator works greats in trend market. I will test with donchian. Can you share the channel indicator? I don't have it in mt4. Thank you!.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Yeah, the indicator may have false signal in ranging or in much volatilty but the 90% of the times when you have a DD then the indicator cover ALL OF YOUR LOSES whit 1 or 3 trades later, I check many signals and always after a big loses a big win comes. That is why I'm looking a good filter or something that can help to improve this, if we can avoid a little the bad signals we will have a powerful strategy!. Thank you for your effort. Greetings.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Donchian shouldbe visable

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Was manually checking the signals and it seems like it gained 460 pips in January on EUR/USD, by doing a 50 pip TP and 50 pip SL. 16 wins and 9 losses. Is anyone able to make an EA for this?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Which TF?

--- 帖子 #34 ---
1 Hour. It seems like this indicator is just a (delayed) version of CCI.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Here we go..... Use the Bollinger Indy rather than the Donchian. Jan 4th through Jan 19th: 9 to 1 win ratio, with well over 300 pips won. TF: H1 Donchian; Period 20,Shift 0, Deviations 3 Entry (as explained in post one) Exit; either band (your lower band will be your SLon a buy, upper band SL on a short) TP; Upper band on a long position, lower band on a short position (SL/TP's must be moved after each candle closes) I would not recommend opening more than one position (per direction) per pair but would most likely have periods where a long and shortposition are opened at the same time. As you can see here, the first short trade would'vewon about 1.5 pips (max!), the second trade would've been opened at the close of that candle and would've ran for about 80 pips. The third trade (short Jan 14th, 17:00 would've been the only loss closing on the 26th at 13:00 (93 pips). In between the open and close of that trade, a long trade would've been opened at 5:00AM on the 15th and closed at the same time the short position also closed (going for a profit of 73 pips). 60 pips in 100 hours on the 1HR chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) This was the mostr choppy (consolidating market) part of the time frame I looked at. The rest of it looked great! Can anyone else look at some otehr pairs with my suggested indys?? Thanks

Fifty fifty 50 / 50 indicator.. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Hey guys,​ First thing I try as a filter with any new strategy is to place a 200 sma and only buy above and sell below. I find with just about any new strategy that most sell signals above the ma result in a loss or BE, whereas only buying at those times should provide some profitability with good money management. In this case I'm trialing on a 1hr chart. 2 from 2 so far, up 160 pips.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
My intention is not to divert this thread, please bear with me. However for those looking for the mq4 files and ea based on the same indicator . This was done before on the following thread. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=128699

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Don't waste your time, there's no such a thing like profitable indicator. You need to learn how to trade, not trust in any indicator.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Nice efforts from all, Leanmore share a thread with the same indicator, I don't have the mql4 code but in the link of post #38 there is the code. The old thread use the indicator with a high period but still have many false signal in the change red-green. We use the indicator in +-100 cross bars. If somebody can help us to make an EA with this parameters to test the indicator, not in the change red-green, when cross the +-100 levels please and don't take after 6 bars. Thank you a lot. NOTE, Nice trade in EURUSD since monday, less stress less trades in the week, big profits

--- 帖子 #41 ---
What is your TP signal? Why did you hold that long? Isn't your TP, the reversal on the CCI??

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Hello Shemski, My TP is 50pips, but I close the 90% of the trade in this TP and let 1 contract run until OPPOSITE VALID SIGNAL. From monday to now the indicator have reversal but no one was VALID SIGNAL, no one cross the -100 so my last contract still running. And each time when it reaches +100 I move my SL in +100 pips of distance.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Gotcha, so the opposite CCI needs to cross 100 or -100. I've been front testing the system manually with mixed results on a M5 chart. I see potential, but more as a manual-trading system. I'm not sure if Bollinger Bands or a Donchian indicator is what you would like to add to it, but I'll keep on digging.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
That's right friend, needs to cross +100 -100 for valid signals, I try it take position each cross +/-100 but some times the price go back to BE for a new signal or in loss, that is why I take profit and let run a contract for a bonus. Ok, If we can make something good for scalping in 5min is ok, hope somebody can code an EA whit the rules of the first post to test it if this is profitable.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Have done some simple arrows to help visually test. Please confirm if they are taking the trades correctly according to the rules. May also give an attempt on a simple EA for testing, I am not a programmer but i can manipulate mt4 here and there.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Thank you so much leanmore! Let me test the arrow indicator for correct rules, really thank you so much

--- 帖子 #47 ---
The longer I play with this strat the more I'm convinced that it will work best on larger TF's. I'm messing around with a Chaikin indicator, using it for cleaner entries and better defined SL's and TP's. I'll try to finish it up this weekend. Cheers

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Here is the EA for backtesting. Please note this is not for live trading . It opens a trade , when the bar closes beyond +100 or -100 and considers only the first 5 bars from change of colour, as per the entry rules in post 1. Closes the full trade at TP of 50 pips and if take profit is not reached closes the trade at the opposite valid signal. No stoploss is used. You may backtest in MT4 strategy tester . NOT FOR LIVE TRADING. It should be run on 1 hour period. For the EA to run you need to have Fx Sniper's T3 CCI and Sniper Arrows Spot in the indicators folder.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Thanks Leanmore I'll take a look at it today and backtest a few pairs and let you know. Great work!

--- 帖子 #50 ---
It looks like the EA works best on the H1 chart with the following variables: Buy/Sell level; 130 Target Profit; 1000 I am assuming it will work best with a higher Buy/sell level on lower charts. The hit rate was about 75-80% on the H1 with a 200/-200 B/S level . My modelling Quality is crap on this computer so lets take these numbers with a grain of salt...

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Thanks for the share! Could you also create a version with options for a stop loss?

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Hi guys, Thank you Leanmore for this robot!, TEST DONE PARAMETERS: TP 50 2015.January.02 to 2016.February.04 I don't know how upload the statement with all the operations. But here is a picture of the graphic NOTE: Here a excel with the operations

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Agreed. Because This EA ONLY closed if there is opposite signal , other word mean : Stop lost after there is opposite signal. This EA will be great with Stop Lost option. thank Leanmore.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Here is the EA with more options. NoStoploss - Select "true" if no stop loss is to be used, and "false" if stoploss is to be used. NoTakeProfit - Select "true" if no takeprofit is to be used, and "false" if take profit is to be used. CloseTradeOnOppositeSignal - Select "true" if its to close open trade when opposite signal appear. "false" if the open trade is not to be closed. Run on Every tick, because the entry is made on the first tick of the candle (using changes in time). For the purposes of backtesting the code seems ok as far as I have tested on my side. Mismatched data errors which may affect the modeling quality are due to the quality of data in MT4 (Strategy tester reconstruct ticks from the lowest time frame available) .

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Thanks, I'll try to run some tests today! Good stuff my man!!

Shemski, This strategy is great! We will make a lot of money every year! Thanks a lot to Leanmore

--- 帖子 #60 ---
I'm tweeking the strat, using a Chaikin Volatilty Indy and it looks amazing. I need to refine it first but it looks very, very nice! This is what I am working with now: Chart: anything under H4 Indy's: Your FXST3CCI Indy (100 &amp; -100) Chaikin (50) Bollinger Bands (20, 0, 3) Buy Entry: Switch of signaon CCI and Chaikin !!MUST!! be above 30 Sell Entry: Opposite TP'sand SL's will be calcualated based on volatility. I am trying to figure out what works better; Bolllinger or Chaikin. This will take time! Below you can see two signals, the first one was a false sell, while the second was a correct buy (see the Chakin Indy). Attached Image (click to enlarge) I might have to open a new thread because it is slightly different to what you've introduced. Let me know what you think. This is another nice entry. Notice the pop in both the Chaikin and the CCI? Figuring out when to take these types of "pops" serious is also crucial. A move like this on a UC pair during Tokyo hours holds much less strength than the EU pair popping at the open of the NY trading session. Do you see where I am going with this? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Hello Evildex, I saw in your chart only 2 bad trades. You take signal only when the bars cross +/-100 until 5 bars, You marked 2 that no cross the +/-100 levels

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Hi Shemski, You really do good improvement! the idea of this thread is modify the indicator rules to make a better one so it doesn't matter the improvements you make, but if you want open a new one it's ok buddy just tell me to follow it. Looks very good filter the chaikin volatility. Can you share the indi please? Thank you so much!

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Here ya go!

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Ok thank you friend!, let me have fun this weekend testing with this filter. Regards!

--- 帖子 #65 ---
In my view this indi like almost all indicators are MA based.So when a move happens most profitable is taking the trade from ZERO not at 100 when the move is potentially exhausted. Its no different then taking MA cross over. I am a big believer of taking the trades EARLY regards

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Hello Davit Yes some trades maybe have less profit but the filter of level -100/+100 is to avoid false zero cross. you can put instead 100 levels may be 40 or 30 levels for a quick entry

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Hi friend I think based on my own experience before anyone strictly trades MA oscillators its good idea to understand how price moves. Basic knowledge of harmonics and Elliot wave is a must.This is critical because Oscillator showing -/+ 100 could mean end of ABC formation or Wave 5 going into correction.Major S/R and pivots play a role as well.To me trading is little like baking certain ingredients must be there for consistent Bread making. Oscillators good at showing divergences which is again advance trading.What I am trying to convey simply following -+100 Oscillator for signal won't be profitable in long run. Putting things in cohesive context will work. For example throwing a fib pivots on price will show critical junctures where price may turn. 38 61 100 level are key turning points. Will try to show on charts

--- 帖子 #68 ---
I am huge fan of TDI because I love RSI perhaps best oscillator out there Notice TDI cross matches with Snipper 0 going south but more important notice price turning down from 61 fib towards the weekly pivot This is what I mean context what price is doing

--- 帖子 #69 ---
UJ Taking Snipper below 100 here Bear will be a huge mistake! Price hit major fib R 100 and TDI turning N setting up bull run. So now we can see clearly what Price action is doing. Snipper alone can't do it.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Great posts Davit. Harmoncs, Gartley and Elliot Wave trading is something I am studying on the side. I agree that a trader must master several skills, sort of like a blacksmith or even a samurai. Imyselfam more interested in building/creating several EA's which would perform seperately sort of like a trading desk of a bank. Basically having each startegy hedge eachother rather than spending the rest of my life searching for the grail... Please do us all a favor and stay in this thread! I'd love to see you add some more imput. Greatly, greatly appreciated.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
What was your pivot based on? This is laso on a H4 chart. This system works (or seems to work best) on H1 to M15 charts where you could actually trade within an Elliott Wave pattern.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Hi Shemski Pivot is based on weekly.If you are interested click on my name files you'll see it along with other indies. I look at the markets more like a living organic being in constant flux and within this chaos there is order.I am a huge believer of fibs and I know some would disagree but I have made good deal of money trading it so evidence is in form of $$ I'll chip in if needed but to be honest I won't be using sniper since I love my current TDI set up which has everything I need. Regards

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Thanks, will check it out later. Off to the gym now!

Hello Machine25, Looks very good your modification of the indicator! two arrow open position, one close, it's look better signal confirmation and leave the profits run!! amazing!, let's see if Leanmore or any other programmer can make a new EA for test this new improvement. Thank you a lot! Regards!

--- 帖子 #78 ---
yes an EA would be welcome, There is still a job to do, fiding the best parameter and manage the signal, not the easiest

--- 帖子 #79 ---
I'd add a Chaikin indicator along with a 250 and 8 EMA and attempt to only trade with the trend and reportback as soona s I have the results.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Change the CCI period to 21 and adjust the buy/sell signal to 40.

I've combined the presented strategy along with a TDI indicator, flipped the original strategy around and am coming up with some amazing results. Please note that only the X.01 lot, Gold Oil and DOllar Index and trades have been placed based on this system.

Long Entry: Chart: H1 -CCI below 120 (less aggressive would be below 150) -TDI below 32 Exit on reverse signal (TDI above 68) or a SL of 100 pips. Expect to take a max of 6 trades per cycle, two per signal, then two more when indicators retrace, repeat no more than three times (6 positions) and risk no more than a total of 3%/portfolio. 100 pips draw-down would equal 0.5% of portfolio. Short Entry: The exact opposite Notes; you will always be in the market unless you are stopped out! It's a simple swing-trade strategy.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
attached are two short signs, one buy (which closes out both short positions and opens a new long pos.) and another short position (which closed out the long pos.) Let me know if anything is not clear. Attached Image (click to enlarge) )

--- 帖子 #88 ---
The following pairs are lining up for long positions: EU EG EA I will most likely wait another 45 minutes until this candle closes and the market cools off. Again, my SL will be 100 pips and my TP will be roughly 120-180 depending on pair. Although I will close the position manually depending on when/if TDI crosses 68.

​Can you post a couple more charts of examples,please Shemski :]

--- 帖子 #100 ---
I'm trying my best not to hijack this thread... Again, these trades are not based on the original rules! The long position went for about 110 to 130 pips (closed that one out yesterday a little early because of Yellen) and the short position was taken earlier today because I wanted to wait for the TDI and the TDI signal to cross. Any questions? Attached Image (click to enlarge) btw, GBPUSD is showing a buy sign, I am going to open a position now.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
All in all a good day. Ignore the two big GBPUSD losses, those were triggered by an EA I forgot to shut down! BE but this system alone added about another 10% to my portfolio, this after about 20% yesterday. I am going to reduce my lots in order to simulate real money. My money management isn't the wisest right now!! Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Shemski, kindly please share your TDI indi and its settings. Many Thanks!

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Read through the thread and you will find it. i think it's on page 5 somewhere. Feel free to program an EA if you are capable.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Hi Shemski, Amazing results! Congratulations! I will test it too with your rules.Regards! And thank you a lot!

--- 帖子 #105 ---
No, thank you.I just added the TDI and reversed it...

--- 帖子 #106 ---
For those interested, the system is showing a sell on Gold. Actually it has been since it hit 1209 but depending on where you set your SL, you might've been SL'd out. I think it's still safe to take. I just shorted at 1247.37

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Closed everything exept for my metals and natgas positions. Ended the day up a little under 2% but had two mistrades which were mistakenly taken from a damn EA I forgot to turn off. My losses there were about GBP 3450.00 there so this system put up another easy 10% today. As mentioned earlier, I am going to reduce lot sizes in order to simulate live trading. My goal is to average 3% a day and hopefully only have one down day a week. Attached Image (click to enlarge) If anyone out there is capable of building an EA please let me know and I'll guide you through the system.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
For those interested, the following pairs are beginning to line up. Give it another 1 to 3 hours and we might have some really nice entry points: EG GU AN GN Not only are we getting very nice signals on the CCI and TDI, but resistance levels are lining up right above/below where our signals should hit. A SL of ca. 50 pips might even do the job in some cases, that would give you a 5-8 to 1 risk/return ratio!!! Good luck and let me know if anynone is trading/testing this system. Would love to hear some critical or negative feedback!

--- 帖子 #109 ---
hello Shemski, I use the strategy you suggested ... and within the last 48 hours i had gained 2000pips of green pips thanks so much.... i am still looking for ways to fine tune the entry the more and avoid some few draw downs occasionally.

Not sure if you are serious or trolling. Either way someone deserves a prize, either you for trolling or me for the system. LOL Do us all a favor and contribute to this thread.

Not at all as for using only daily candle...it is just a reference nothing more.... i just wait to be a little bit sure after the exhaustion of the move which will touch the outer B Band (cross of 160 of the FXst CCI indicator and the TDI have to each other at a very good steep angle) to the direction i want to enter... i trade only live accounts Thank you

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Good stuff! Stay confident but don't get too cocky. The markets will take you down quickly with a sucker punch, the second you get to jumpy! Have a great trading day!!

--- 帖子 #117 ---
NZDCAD and AUDNZD lining up. I like the AN trade a little better because of closer resistance levels. Might only take that... We'll see

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Hello my good friend Shemski,I test your new strategy and really works amazing! Now I'm waiting for an EA, let's see if a programmer can do the EA with this new strategy.Thank you a lot an lets make much money the next week!

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Not really my strategyy, i just tweeked yours! Thank you for the intro! I am um 27% in three days.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Holly trading! Well the next week I'll make that amazing profit!

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Monday looks to be a very exciting trading day with almost all Yen pairs, S&amp;P and a few other kiwi pairs lining up for very sweet entries. Time to get some research in and prepare for for what looks to be a big Monday! Have a great weekend everyone.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Hi Friends, Im able to programm you the EA easily. If Im hopefully that a strategy could provide good results Im ready to make it free. So here is my offer. That it is easier for me: Please post here in one Reply all the indicators I need plus a template and again all the rules. Than I will make for you the EA within a day for free and post here. Kind Reagrds Ben

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Thanks kleybenny, here ya go! Long Entry: Chart: H1 -CCI below 120 (less aggressive would be below 150) -TDI below 32 Exit on reverse signal (TDI above 68) or a SL of 100 pips. Expect to take a max of 6 trades per cycle, two per signal, then two more when indicators retrace, repeat no more than three times (6 positions) and risk no more than a total of 3%/portfolio. 100 pips draw-down would equal 0.5% of portfolio. Short Entry: The exact opposite I am also playing around with a standard CCI indicator which pretty much does the job also and it might even be more accurate! I've also added the standard CCI. The indicators I've been using until now are: Snipper, Synergy Pro TDI and the Bollinger Bands are really only there for direction. Not really needed. Notes; you will always be in the market unless you are stopped out! ***EDIT*** I originally had the wrong template up. the correct one is now uploaded "CCI TDI 13.012.16"

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Hi Mate, thank you. Today evening I will programm the EA. One question: You explained maximum 6 positions. This I dont understand. 2 at first signal (lets say 2 times one lot = 2 lots), than 2 lots again after inidcator (CCI) retraces from 120 Level and then? Again when signal in same direction appears 2 lots? Why than every time 2 positions? You would get the same results with only one position with 2 lots for example.... Or do you close one of the two positions earlier? Kind Regards Ben

--- 帖子 #125 ---
The baseic idea is to: a) never risk more than 3% of your portfolio per pair b) scale in to that 3%. Never take a 3% position right from the start Don't forget, we are using 100 pip SL's on a H1 chart, this gives us plenty of room to survive volatile markets. Below is a nice exaple of how a signal was triggered twice, once on Jan 20th, two sell arrows and again on Jan 21st (red and blue sell arrows). On the 25th traders "could've exited but only the TDI crossed 32, the TDI signal remained above. Then, on the 26th, two more sell signs were triggered. The "true" buy sign wass on the 27th. Total profit there was about 420-450 pips on 6 trades. Your total SL was 6 times 100 pips (each set at 0.5% of portfolio) Any other questions? Thank you again!!!! Attached Image (click to enlarge) ***EDIT*** That second yellow arrow shpould be shifted two candles to the right. My bad

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Ok, I think I begin to get your idea. Again one example for my understanding: The EA should open one short position after Canlde close when TDI (Main, not signal) is over 68 and CCI is over 120 right? So lets say first 1 lot (0,5% of Balance with 100 SL). Than cci indicator crosses the 120 level downwards, second trade right? Agian with 100 SL. Than lets say price raises before TDI reaches the 32 Level and TDI crosses upwards 68 and CCI again over 120, than third position. After that CCI crosses downwards again 120 level and 4. trade. Lets say the price will still rise further and TDI crosses not downwards the 32 Level. Lets say TDI raises again over 68 and CCI again over+120 level, 5. trade. 6. trade after CCI crosses again downwards the +120 level. Right? And than wait until all SL are triggered? Or Sell again when one SL was triggered and a new sell signal appears? Because the SL (100 pips) are all not at the same level.... But when a buy triggered, automatic close all sell positions right?

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Ok, I think I begin to get your idea. Again one example for my understanding: The EA should open one short position after Canlde close when TDI (Main, not signal) is over 68 and CCI is over 120 right? I usually wait for both TDI's to cross. We coudl play around with this. So lets say first 1 lot (0,5% of Balance with 100 SL). Than cci indicator crosses the 120 level downwards, second trade right? Agian with 100 SL. No, the 120 CCI is your fist signal (as long as the CCI is abocve zero, we are waiting to take another position). We only take another position if TDI crosses back over 68. Than lets say price raises before TDI reaches the 32 Level and TDI crosses upwards 68 and CCI again over 120, than third position. Yes. After that CCI crosses downwards again 120 level and 4. trade. No. Lets say the price will still rise further and TDI crosses not downwards the 32 Level. Lets say TDI raises again over 68 and CCI again over+120 level, 5. trade. 6. trade after CCI crosses again downwards the +120 level. Right? Yes. And than wait until all SL are triggered? Or Sell again whenn one SL was triggered? Each position has it's own SL, 100 pips. Because the SL (100 pips) are all not at the same level.... But when a buy triggered, automatic close all sell positions right? Yes.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
My friend, I still dont understand when to take the first and when to take the second trade .... sorry. I try to ask to understand: You trade only when CCI is above 120 AND TDI is above 68 right? So when CCI is above 120 but TDI is at 50, you dont trade right? After bove Indicators gave the trigger sell, you sell two times at the same time? so 2 trades were triggered? If yes why 2 trades? Why not only one Sorry for misunderstanding

--- 帖子 #129 ---
CCI is trigger one TDI is trigger two CCIis almost always going to trigger first and is only there in order to assure that the trend was strong (hopefully alo die off quickly). As soon as the CCI crosses, you wait for the TDI. The CCI might cross below 120, that doesn't really matter. As long as it was hit shortly before (lets say three candles before the TDI is signaled). The reason why you end up taking two trades is when the TDI flatlines above 68 and TDI dips and rises. Sure you could take two positions (or 1%) but by taking slow steps you'll be bale to scale in with less risk.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
I'll try to make things more clear: Position 1) CCI crosses above 120, TDI and TDI signal crosses above 68 Position 2) TDI and TDI signal drops below 68, then retraces above 68 (let's asums this happens within 8-10 hours on the H1 chart) Price then dips and all indicators also retreat. The TDI's DO NOT touch 32 and bounce back up to 68, while the CCI crosses over 120. Then: -Position 3 is opened, possibly position 4. If you get a fifth signal with TDI flatlining do not take it. -Pirce will either rise or drop -A 5th and 6th position can be opened if the TDI's drop and retrace. I hope it's clear now!

Hi Found the same CCI here on FF without the advertisement. Just change the settings Cheers

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Ok friends, I really want to help. But please try to understand me: Im a programmer. I need clear rules. At first there was no explanation about TDI and TDI crosses. Now you tell me the second trade is at cross from TDI and TDI SIGNAL. Please again: Tell me exactly what you want. Buy rule and Sell rule and Close condition. I dont cant spent so much time to understand your rules. If you now what you want, please write heare again a post with clear rules. When you take your first picture which you send today morning with the arrows: The arrows are not at the place where you explain the trades. Take for example the second red arrow and the second green arrow on this pricture (both are sells). But they are not correct with your rules. Why you take the trade so late? The trades would be triggered for my understand a few canldes before. EAs cant think. They cant feel. They need CLEAR rules. So provide me this please in form of: Sell if ...... Buy if...... close if ...... ok? If you could provide the rules clearly I could help you. Ben

--- 帖子 #138 ---
I'm on the road, will reply with clear rules later. I'll also reply to those trades posted above. Some of them look off.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
OK, I hope this is enough, a short position would obviously be the complete opposite. Chart: H1 Position size: 0.5% / portfolio Long entry rules: 1) CCI must be above 120 for at least 4 candles 2) TDI and TDI Signal must be above 68 Long exit rules: 1) TDI crosses below 32 (Note; I would recommend not waiting for the TDI Signal to also cross) SL: 100 pips Additiional positions rule: 1) Take a second position if TDI drops below 68 and retraces back over using the same CCI rule (must have broken 120 within last 4 candles) 2) Only take two positions per cycle (The cycle will be defined by the CCI, if the CCI drops in to negative, a new cycle begins) *Note* If two positions are taken, then price drops, TDI drops (but does not touch 32) and CCI drops below zero and then CCi hits 120, TDI and TDI Signal cross back over 68, only then a new "set" (2) of positions can be taken.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Your entries and exits are all wrong: I'm not sure if the TDI signal ever dropped under 32 while you took your first two long positions. If it did, then your first and only long entry should be on that very long bear candle, in between your two long entries. Your second exit (and opening of short position) looks correct. Your short exit and entrance of your second long position should be right in between your two arrows on the right...

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Again, slightly wrong. The second short entry is correct, a second short position should've never been placedbecause the TDI never rose above 32. Now, if I was trading this manually, I would've mabe entered a second time when the CCI retraced -120.... But yes, this looks liek a losing trade.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Thank you!!

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Shemski, I think you mean in your example Short and not Long position right? Because your wrote Long....

--- 帖子 #144 ---
So friends, here is my first version of the EA. I added a view possibilities. You can choose for example the CCI triggering level. Please try it and tell me what you think. My first view: Its not as good as I thout.... Kind Regards Ben

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Hello kleybenny,Thank you for the EA! I test it right now.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Thanks Ben, I can't seem to get it to work... Anyone else having issues testing it? I also don't see the TDI as a variale within the input settings.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Hi, you wanted the TDI in inputs? Its no problem, but I thout that 32 and 68 are the fix levels. What is the problem with the EA? Can you load it?

--- 帖子 #148 ---
OK, just wasn't sure if you had them as fixed levels. Perfect in that case. I'mnot sure if it's my broker, but the damn MT4 starts the backtest and just freezes after a few seconds. The green bar is basically stuck between the "p" and "h" of graph and no results are showing up in the results tab. Strange... Can you post the result of your backtests? Thanks

--- 帖子 #149 ---
I testing the EA and works very good, but can you remove this rule please? or put this rule like option because there are very good trades and the EA takes only 2 per cycle "Exit on reverse signal (TDI above 68) or a SL of 100 pips. Expect to take a max of 6 trades per cycle, two per signal, then two more when indicators retrace, repeat no more than three times (6 positions) and risk no more than a total of 3%/portfolio. 100 pips draw-down would equal 0.5% of portfolio." Just make the EA take trades every signal please. Thank you and still testing every month since 2014

--- 帖子 #150 ---
hi, where can I find the "panel" stop loss, take profit from your share picture? thanks in advance!

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Can somebody please post some backtest results? I still can't get the EA to run. Thanks

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Hello friends, Here the first results, the EA is too slow in back testing. Only one month january 2016. I saw many good trades but the rule of two trades per signal affects the good results, please benny modify the EA and delet that rule, just leave the EA take trades in each signal.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
December 2015

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Could you please confirm your model quality? Thanks

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Sure, in the first test of january it was 74%, The second test I use the third option in model section because is more fast. I saw the same results if I use the first model or the third model but the third is more fast.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
i test it eurusd h1 default settings on 01/2016 win 394 02/2016 win 605 01/01/2016 to 12/02/2106 win 1306 account 10.000 24 trades drawdown 18.95% profit trades 16 loss rades 8

--- 帖子 #157 ---
I have 90% model quality but when I try and back test. It hangs the tester screen and gets stuck. I think there might be a bug causing this.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Hi Juan, was that manually tested or auto? Great reults!

--- 帖子 #159 ---
I am having the exact same issue! Would love to test it but it keeps on freezing on me. Kley, can you please share the code? Maybe someone can refine it a bit. Thanks

--- 帖子 #160 ---
I ran it from beginning of February to current day. Took Forever, but it showed 90% also. Trades moved slow though.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
So far, so good today! Ignore the EURUSD, USDCAD and USDJPY trades. They are all from another EA. This bad boy has me up 2% / portfolio already. Attached Image (click to enlarge) There are well over 10 pairs which are ripe to enter. Anyone else in the market with this system today? Enjoy your trading day and green pips to all!!!

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Hi shemski, What is your bad boy EA? Looks amazing!

--- 帖子 #163 ---
yes i am in AUDNZD _ sell GBPNZD - sell so far that is what i am in thanks Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #164 ---
No, the other one isn't anything sprecial. I'm playing around with the nonlagdot and the EMA/RSI EA's. Both on the first page of the forum.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Your entries look better than mine. I missed the GN entry but took the AN pair twice. Good stuff, I hope you are enjoying the system!

--- 帖子 #166 ---
----- Yes Shemski.... So far so good.. the system gives me room to relax and play around without necessarily staying glue to system all day... i also had another entry.. NZDCAD - buy

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Thankyou would you please say this position is based on which rules?

--- 帖子 #168 ---
The NZDCAD position? Based on the rules stated here a few times... CCI and TDI crosses, etc.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
gbpnzd i have a buy 2.17081 on -150 and 32

--- 帖子 #170 ---
NZDCAD by ejiks!!! according to his screen shot i dont see that his position was as the rules!!! edit: ok maybe he has taken this position about 17hours before !! when TDI has crossed down of 32 ?

--- 帖子 #171 ---
i have a problem on cci tdi ea when a run the ea and i change from h1 to m30 the close all the open trades also if the trade is on another pair i run it on a demo and i confirm the problem thanks

--- 帖子 #172 ---
For those trading the market. A crap load of positions are about to get SL'd, hang in there and do not panic. This is why we only risk 0.5% per position. We will re-enter soon enough and make up for the losses. Luckely I'm only down 3% on the day, but prices should correct soon and then we'll catch the correctional-move! Let's do this!! Confidence, confidence, confidence!!!

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Hello guys There is a little problem with this indicator, I thaught it was ok because it is coded T3 -like, and T3 do not repaint, but it is not coded properly : it repaint like hell, so I recoded it, it work fine now : Get the signal on bar 1, not on bar 0

--- 帖子 #174 ---
EA is not working, therefore we can not back test it...whoever can code, please use Shemski rules, so we can see if we need to spend any more time on this...

--- 帖子 #175 ---
You are using completely different settings at 50,10. The CCI's settings we've been using are 14,5. If you use the same settings, there is no big difference between the two indicators.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Shemski, for long trades, we do not wait for TDI signal to cross TDI from under 32? On the image few bad Long trades

--- 帖子 #177 ---
I called up commissioner Gordon and had him run up to the roof and turn on the Mathtrader7-Bat-Signal. I hope he is working on the EA now. If anyone on here can rescue us, it's him! Attached Image

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Yes we do. In this case,you are correct. twotrades which hit SL. More good trades to come, so don't worry. I re-entered the EU long trade at 1.11433.I simply waited for the TDI to cross the TDI Signal. Sidenote; this might be an even better entry signal: Only take trades when TDI crosses back over TDI-Signal and is still above/below 68/32. Just some food for thought!

--- 帖子 #179 ---
BTW, thanks again for these indicators. So happy I don't have to look at that damn forex.wot advertisement!!

--- 帖子 #180 ---
it looks like the EA does work for back testing just very very very slow, I have left it running since my last post and it is 90% there lol running over a 2 and half month period. Any idea why it would be so slow. Not sure if the data will be worth anything at the end.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
The markets are finally turning around. Those who were patient, set their SL's correctly and did not panic should all be back in the green! Green pips to all today!

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Good things come to those who wait! This account went from 30K to +40K in about a week. The great thing about it is, it also was pretty stable while it was not performing. This system is f*king money! Although I do need to admit, about 1K to ca. 2K of the performance came from another system. But still, 26% in one week! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #183 ---
What leverage and what allocation of equity risk per position you are using?

--- 帖子 #184 ---
right now I am at 2% per trade and take no more than two positions per pair. I'll reduce that though in the near future. The system is simple; measure 100 pips calculate size so that you risk no more than 2%. Set TP at about 1.5 to 2 times length of SL and adjust as soon as TDI gets close to trigger. My profit can be anywhere from 0.5% to 5%. Really depends on the pairs movement velocity.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Here is a simple EA for testing Shemski 's rules. Its not exact but i think its a close approximation: maximumorders = the ea will not open more than this number at any time. This is slightly different from the rules, because its only considering maximum number of open trades at a point in time. The TDI is calculated as simply the moving average of RSI. This may differ from the indicator used in the rules , but i do not think much. THIS EA IS NOT FOR LIVE TRADING , ITS FOUR TESTING PURPOSES.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Thanks leanmore, I'll take a look at it later tonight. Does everyone still understand the basic rules? Someone messaged me and mentioned that a few of you are having issues understanding them...

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Hi Shemski, As you requested, here is the first version of the EA that trades based on above rules. I haven't fully tested it. Use it at your own risk! Best, Math

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Thank you Math, once again my man.... You are one of the best, if not the best member on here. Will give it a run tmrw. Need to get some sleep now. You're the baddest, dude!!!!

--- 帖子 #189 ---
i see the ea default sl and tp is set in points......how do points translate into pips, being that i'm not familiar with the idea of "points" in forex.....

--- 帖子 #190 ---
10 points = 1pip 350point= 35 pip

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Hi Math It seems as if the TP is a simple set number. Would it be possible to change that to the following: Sell TP: TDI crosses over 32 Buy TP: TDI crosses over 68 Thanks again and clean EA as usual!

--- 帖子 #192 ---
For those who are interested and trading CFD's, almost every european and US stock markets are lining up to be shorted. We could see a huge move back down from here. Good luck and green pips to all!

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Hi Shemski, You're welcome! :-) How's the EA working? In the first version the EA closes an open position at reverse signals. I'll modify it to close when price closes above TDI 68 for Long positions and below TDI 32 for Short positions. Best, Math

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Looking to short the Nasdaq, this time I am going to wait for the TDI to cross back over the TDI-Signal. I think this could be the key. The Long Entry would be: CCI above 120 TDI above 68 TDI Signal above 68 TDI crosses TDI Signal (and still over 68) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Hi Math, it's coded super clean, you can really tell how smooth it is. It's not doing exactly what I want it to do, but def something to work with. Thank you sooo much! Good things come to those who wait! The top 13 open positions were triggered from this system. the bottom two are based on another system I'm working on, which is also looking promising. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #196 ---
That's good news! :-) I haven't had a chance to put it under test on my VPS yet. Since the results seems promising, I would like to further develop this EA. You mentioned that it doesn't work exactly the way you want it to do. Please tell me how you want the EA to be modified to enter/exit the market the way you do. Best, Math

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Shemski and MathTrader7, please incorporate nonlog logic for entries as on option True/False...Shemski, you know the rules..

--- 帖子 #198 ---
@ Invermac Here is Testing CCI TDI System V2 with MA options: If Matrendfilter is true , it will only open buy positions when the close is above MA 1 and MA 2 and if CloseOnMA2Cross is true it will close buy position if price close below MA2. Vice Versa for sell. All the other is same as previous version. REMEMBER FOR TESTING PURPOSES, NOT DONE BY A PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMMER

--- 帖子 #199 ---
I tried to demo this EA but it kept putting an error stating it needed the synergy pro tdi indicator. I had one on but it was from another thread but I am confused why it would conflict. Regardless, can someone provide the indicators to go along with the EA?

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Leanmore could you please put a template for the EAv2 thanks in advance

Hi MathTrader7 the EA is not working im my MT4 . when drage it to my chart nothing happend . i but it in EXPERT directory . and i have snipper at idecator directory. whats wrong ?

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Probably you don't have the file Synergy_Pro_TDI.ex4 copied into your MT4's Indicators folder.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Hi MathTrader7 I have snipper.ex3 and Synergy_Pro_TDI.ex4 at my indecator directory and EA at expert directory . but still not working .

--- 帖子 #204 ---
What error message(s) do you see in your MT4's Experts tab?

--- 帖子 #205 ---
"2016.02.17 22:35:13.357 MathTrader7_ShemskiEA: has newer unsupported version, please update your client terminal " I will try to update my terminal .

--- 帖子 #206 ---
It means that you have to upgrade your MT4 to build 940+ in order to be able to use the EA.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Thanks for this, guys ​ But, do we have to have the Snipper indi in the indi folder also, or do we only need the Synergy indi?

--- 帖子 #208 ---
OK guys, I am at fault here. my variables in an earlier post were not clear. These should be: Chart: H1 Long Entry: -CCI below 120 (less aggressive would be below 150) at least once during the previous 6 candles -TDI and TDI Signal below 32 (one could wait for TDI to cross back over TDI signal (while under 32) if you'd liek to playit safe) Exit on (semi)reverse signal (TDI above 68) or a SL of 100 pips. You can play with your SL and calculating your R/R is almost impossible because your profit will depend on the velocity of the pair and how the TDI moves. Just risk no more than 2% f your portfolio on the SL... I'd movetoBE as soon as you get about 50pips. Sorry again and thank you Mat hand everyone else who is putting in work!

--- 帖子 #209 ---
if you want to automate this strategy then please upload the .mq4 file and give me 6 hours at least and EA will be ready for you (for free of course)

I updated Mt4 and it's working ok now thanks Math

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Its not a bad system at all. Stumbled upon it last night about 7 hrs ago and put in some pending orders. So far so good. Any strategy that use's a higher time frame means less time in front of the screen (and less stress) im always a fan of. I did add my twist. I added the DSS 1h and 4h to the TDI window to confirm reversals. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Quick summary of how those trades went: AUS200, almost at SL, might not win this one but looking to enter again soon. GBPCAD, in the green ca. 75 pips GBPAUD, sold with 262 pips profit (1%/portfolio) GBPAUD, loss of 203 pips (1%/port) EURCAD, loss of 100 pips (2%/port) OIL, NASDAX, DOW, AUSUSD did not enter NZDUSD, up 20 pips EURAUD, missed the entry EURNZD, break even - position still open USDCAD, up a few pips GBPNZD, up 180 pips (ca. 2%/port) Other positions which I took: EURGBP, up 74 pips (1.8%) GBPUSD, up 71 pips NZDJPY, up 62 pips AUDNZD, up 72 pips and a few more All in all, with both systems I am up another 10% of my portfolio. On good days I'll be up about 15-20%, my max drawdown is about 8% portflolio. NOt that I'm risking too much, I just take a crap load of positions and am trading two systems. This bad boy is making me a crapload of pips! http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=579246 all of these trades except for the bottom three were based on the above system.

Very, very nice. could ypu please upload that indy? I am happy you like it. Thanks

--- 帖子 #224 ---
This is a perfect example of how the system works and if you show patience, how you can make a crap load of pips: My first and only entry was at the first TDI/TSI crossover above 68, I had the option to take it again after the second crossover (I should've) and boom, look at that drop! I'm sitting on 80 pips, waiting for 100, maybe 120. Just take your positions, spread your risk and sit and watch... Attached Image (click to enlarge) Green pips to all!

Sure thing, I also included the "WorkTime" indi. I use it for visual reference of my waking hours for trading from 6am-10pm. I notice that 6am (london open +3H (seems to be the sweet spot for when pairs make a move for me.

I've had quite a few people message me about how good their results are and how they like Math's EA. Can you guys please post some of your results on here. I'd also love to hear some negative feedback. What do you think WE could/should do better. This is a forum, let's act that way and help eachother out. Hell, I'm no pro, but I'm doing my best to make this thing work as good as possible! Help us out guys an gals!

IMHO, the Synergy Pro TDI indicator and the system of trading you shared with us here have a great potential to become a profitable trading system/EA. I am going to add further functionalities such as Move-to-Breakeven, Trailing Stop (Fixed/ATR based), Money Management, etc. to new versions of the EA. Let's see how it would perform at the end of the day. Best, Math

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Hi Math and Shemski, Which is the latest version of the EA, is it complete and working as it should will forward test it on one of my servers. Let me know. Thanks, Spencer

--- 帖子 #234 ---
I didn't find any good setting to be a little similar as your results. I have 90% data. But I did a test till now only eurusd..

--- 帖子 #235 ---
You should try it with DSS Bressart as posted further up on the page here. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...70#post8762070 One regular and one MTF set on 4H, when the waves line up with the TDI, its a golden entry.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
I have been back testing Math's EA and not finding the sweet spot you have. Is there something I am missing?

--- 帖子 #237 ---
I think it might be a combo of a few things. a) I trade everything and I mean everything, well maybe not exotics like the ZARJPY pair, but I amnot picky. Oil, Gold, Nat Gas, FX, eveything. b) I take multiple positions and do not giveup on a trade. If I get SL'd our and two minutes later another long signalis sent, I'm in.I don't care, I'm in! c) I play around with my TP's and SL's. My TPis usually set for the opposite crossing of the TDI through 32/68. If I see that I am 80 pips in and 20 away from my SL but the TDI is at 55, I'll add a few more pips to my TP. The other way around also. If myTP is set for 100 and TDI crosses opposite at 60 pips, I'm out. These three "tweeks" willmake it difficult to create that perfect EA. But then again, I am a firm believer of guiding an EA and not blindly trusting it... So where is the sweet spot? I guess you can say, we willall have a different sweetspot depending on our style of trade. Btw, I also never keep positions open during news.... EDIT: Notice where my SL and TP is compared to the TDI? That TP is set too high, adjusting it now. Imight only get 90 pips out of this rather than the original 160 I was looking for... My SL has also been set to slightly above BE Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #238 ---
You rule Math. I'm so happy you are helping us! This is OUR system, let's all help eachother out!

--- 帖子 #239 ---
You guys should all try to trade this manually in order to get a feel for it. As mentioend quite a few times, the SL's are pretty deep and it takes quite a bit of patience. As soon as you sit out 10 or maybe 20 trades, you'll get a better feel for the system. Strangly enough I feel extremely close to the markets right now. It's really weird, almost as if the system is somehow acting like a translator and telling me what the markets are thinking. LOL, my ass sounds drunk. Doesn't it??

Hi shemski, the problem with this system is, that it probably works only in ranging markets very good, as they are at the moment. But you get in serious troubles when markets moves in one direction without stop. For example look please last year. Nearly all EUR pairs fall down hardly. How this system would manage such trends? For example please only look at 05.01.2015 EURJPY pair h1 chart. From beginning of this date many weeks you will see a lot of buy signals. But the price is falling and falling and falling. You would have more than 1000 pips loss.... Please understand me right, Im not critic, I only want to help. Kind Regards Ben

Hi Math, I test this EA on M5 chart and the result is 50 win 50 lose, I see that we have many lose at market open time (Tokyo, London and NewYork). Because the trend on that time is very strong. You can see attached picture file. Could you make a combine EA? It mean: At market open time, we run EA2: long as CCI over 120 and TDI over 68; and short as CCI below -120 and TDI below 32. After 1 hour (this time we can set to change), this EA will close all order automatically. After 1 hour, trend is weak and the market is sideway, we run EA1 (this EA you coded):short as CCI over 120 and TDI over 68; and long as CCI below -120 and TDI below 32. And all order will close automatically at market open time. And EA2 start automatically. So we will have one EA that combine EA1 and EA2. We run EA2 at market open time (Tokyo, London and NewYork) and we run EA1 after 2 hours market open time. We close all order before we start EA1 or EA2 automatically. All time we coded that we can set to change. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
I'll add an option to the next versions to let the user set the EA to open positions in reverse directions as you mentioned.

Thank you Math

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Hi Math, As EA stop lose short, EA entry next short order in the next candle, If we are in trend we will have big lose. I think we should wait CCI and TDI decrease and then increase again above +120 and above 68 to short. Please see attached picture file.

So, here is the screenshot. Sorry for delay. Was sleeping You can see a lot of entrys, but nearly never a chance to close in profit for the whole Januar 2015 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Yes, I see. I see about 4-5 losing trades and one winner. At the end of the day it just makes the most sense to trade more than one system. Maybe two breakouts and one swing trading system. In this case, our system would be down about 4-5% / portfolio. Just something to consider....

Hi Shemski, You mention that the TDI above 68, is this the Green line? TDI signal above 68, is this the Red line?

--- 帖子 #270 ---
That's not the same system I (and most of us) am/are using. That is what was originally suggested...

--- 帖子 #271 ---
TDI is green line in below indy, red line is TDI Signal

--- 帖子 #272 ---
How has the system been treating you guys? I'd love to hear about some good, but better yet bad trades and attempt to refine it. I'm up 4.4% on the day but my other system is dragging me down a little. Who's up, who's down??

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Interesting... rediscovering pretty old indicator...

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Indeed, the TDI is an extremely powerful, underrated indy! So many ways to use it!

--- 帖子 #275 ---
CCi in general is a great indi for spotted divergences like shown below. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Am i missing something here, whats the use of CCI in shemski's method? take that off and just use TDI on its own, the problem with TDI has always been the times we get price moving higher/lower after a cross over or under 32, 68. The filter in this case is the huge stop in place. I simply dont get what cci is doing for this system?

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Some comparison.... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Hi Math, Please check and fix this in attached picture file, I thinh we should wait CCI and TDI decrease and increase again over +120 and 68 to short. Similiar for long. Thank you so much.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
I agree and this is something I mentioned to Math. At the end of the day the CCI is pretty usuelss. I suggested we take the porion AFTER the TDI crosses the TDI Signal while still above/under 68/32

--- 帖子 #280 ---
That is not divergence. If you draw a trendline under the price, you also should draw a matching trendline under the oscillator.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Cci is amazing but this thread has diverged into two methods. Cci is perfect for momentum and TDI ive used mainly for reversals so we either try make a combined system or separate them?

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Essentially the Trading Made Simple and TMS for M30 charts are both TDI systems..

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Don't know why TDI is being mentioned here, but if you're interested, refer to this user . She uses both TDI and Awesome (which has similar performance to Sniper's as I showed it in the comparison picture below) very successfully. You can get the idea.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Yes i know but shemski and math are trying to automate a TDI system my comment was simply the cci had no use

--- 帖子 #285 ---
If the purpose is to automate TDI, then there's already a thread for it: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=551041 You may want to see it before you reinvent the wheel....

--- 帖子 #286 ---
The longer I look at this, the more I'm convinced that it will make more sense to refine the TDI method. The CCI doesn't really hold that much value with this system. With that said, I think I'll move this over there. Oh, one more thing.... I think I've found the exact indy needed on top of the TDI. As we all know, the TDI combines a MA, RSI and volatility bands in order to give you a three in one type of indy. While studying this damn TDI indy for weeks, if not months now, what I've noticed is it usually shows false buy or sell signs (using my method based more on the RSI) when the market is either quiet or volatile. The indicator which tracks that best if you ask me, is the ADX. So long story short, I've adjusted the ADX to a 13 peiriod rather than 14 in order to tighten up the time frame it was measuring and set two barriers at 30 and 50 within the ADX. I then only take trades when my TDI signals and the ADX is BETWEEN 30 and 50. These would be the new rules: Chart: H1 Indicators: Synergy Pro TDI (standard settings) ADX (Period 13) Two lines set at 30 and 50 Long Entry: -TDI and TDI Signal below 32 (one could wait for TDI to cross back over TDI signal (while under 32) if you'd like to playit safe) -ADX is between 30 and 50 Exit on (semi)reverse signal (TDI above 68) or a SL of 100 pips. (do not worry about ADX on reversal, we couldcare less about a trend's strength on the exit) I backtested on EURUSD and GBPUSD and the results look a lot better! CAn some of you guys give it a look and let me know if you'd like to add something?

--- 帖子 #287 ---
I think the points already made are there's tdi systems out there you are re inventing the wheel for no reason

--- 帖子 #288 ---
No, I understand that and that's why I mentioned it might be time to move it to the TDi thread or just open a new one which would be a TDI/ADX thread. But due to the mass amount of messages I'm getting rgding this system, I figured I'd post the variables in here.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
For thsoe interested in my current setup, here it is: Bollingers (only for reference - non functional) - Standard MT4 Indy Synergy Pro TDI (standard settings) ADX (Period 13, two ref. lines at 30 and 50) -Standard MT4 Indy This is a decent example of how the ADX should help.Attached you'll see six lines.The red lines are all buy/sell signals which the ADX would've filtered out. Line 1) correct short Line 2) correct long Line 3) false short (which would've been a bad trade) Line 4) false short Line 5) correct short (TDI crossed below 68, then crossed over and backdown) Line 6) correct long Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Sorry to be a pain but my understanding of ADX is its best to get it while under 20 as this is the start of a new trend anything over 40 is the end of a trend. Id of only taken the while lines on this screebshot. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Again,you are correct but that would be if you are trading on a system based around the ADX. The ADX in this case is only supporting the TDI. The ADX is usually used to measure a trends strength and when used as a primary indicator, attempt to catch the beginning of a trend. I'm trying to catch the market while it's trending (30 - 50 mark) but not trending too strong. I'm trying to avoid the following situation: EURUSD is trending very strong DOWN. My TDI keeps on crossing the TDI Signal under 32 which is constantly triggering buy signs. I keep on getting SL'd until the strong trend ends. What I'd like to do is identify a trending market with the ADX but determin that it is not trending too strong. Hey, if I amcompletely wrong here. let meknow. I enjoy your feedback the most in here. Please keep it up! BTW,just noticed; that 3rd sign, the false sell is actually correct.My bad. Tired as hellright now...

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Dont get me wrong im not saying you are wrong at all, just throwing in my thoughts.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
And those thoughts are highly appreciated. Please keep them coming!!

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Here is Version 1.5 of the EA that implements trading according above rules.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Thanks Math. It looks like the EA is taking trades as soon as the TDI crosses 32/68. Could you adjust it so that it only takes trades when the TDI crosses back over the TDI signal while still under 32. A long entry would be the following: 1) TDI below 32 2) TDI Signal below 32 3) TDI under TDI Signal 4) TDI crosses above TDI Signal whle both are still under 32 5) ADX is between 30 and 50 SL: 100 pips = 1% / portfolio Year to date, I see 15 trades on the EURUSD pair / H1 chart. The total profit should be a round 250-350 pips. 9 winning and 6 losing trades. **EDIT; 9 trades in December. Up about 270 pips on 6 winning and 3 lossing trades.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Here's a great example of how adding the ADX will keep you out of trouble. These are pretty recent signals, as you can see the cycle starts off with two bad trades (first two red arrows). Both of them get SL'd on that large dip around 04:00 of Feb 11th but shortly after the TDI crossed back over the TDI Signal (first blue arrow). That trades rode for over 200 points (see double blue arrow - exit arrows), which made up for the first two losses. Then on Feb 15th at 00:00, a flase signal (yellow arrow) was triggered, because the ADX was too high. This trade would've been SL'd about 15 hours later. Then two more short trades (the fourth and fifth blue arrows) which rode for about 40 and 90 pips. Shortly after at 5:00 on the 19th we were hit with our latest long signal (currently 53 pips in the red). So all in all we are up around 80 pips rather than being down about 20. This is the third pair I've manually backtested thison and the resultyare identical. Let me know if this isn't clear! Attached Image (click to enlarge) Depending on how the market opens tonight,I might take that USDJPY long position with a 100 SL.

OK, I like where this is going. I'llplay around with the settings later, need to get a few things done first. Is nayone else playing with it?

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Your're better off trading the TDI using the PL and MBL (Green and yellow). I trade it using the following rules: Long when Green crosses up over red and yellow. Yellow has to be below 50% midline. Short when Green crosses down over red and yellow. Yellow has to be above 50% midline. Attached Image (click to enlarge) (I also use it to spot divergences as noted on the chart.) There's several different ways to trade off the TDI, this is how I trade it. However as we all know, news and market events will defeat the best of positive trade indications. See the Synergy attachment starting on page 35.

I also keep an eye on the TDI waves when they match up on multiple TF's. Great entries and exit indications. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #302 ---
I understand how the "standard" TDI trading system works. It's more of a breakout trading system. I'm interested in using it more as a swing system. Again, this would be one of about four systems I'd like to run. Two breakout and two swing systems... Great feedback though! Thanks

AUDCAD lining up very nicely! The last three times TDI crossed under TDI Signal while above 68,we had at least 80 pip runs! I'm keeping my eye on that ADX, this couldbe a very nice trade! I also see very nice resitance about 25 and 60 pips above us and a good 60-70 pip free fall down. D1, H4 are both trending down. I might even risk 3% of portfolio on this one....

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Hi Invermac! Could you please provide more details - what this indicator measures, how it's calculated and in general what is idea behind it?

--- 帖子 #321 ---
The EA traded three pairs: 1. EURJPY, BUY 2. CADJPY, SELL 3. USDCAD, BUY Overall not bad so far!

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Yes, I see. But it also missed a few trades. I think it only took about three trades since I started runnig it... It does look good though!

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Please keep an eye on USDCAD. It is lining up for a short. Let's see if the EA takes it. NZDJPY and CADJPY are also lining up for long positions

--- 帖子 #324 ---
I have a question! The EA must check the cross between TDI and TDI signal line for every tick or at close of a candle? Checking at every tick means that the indicator may repaint.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Here is why the EA didn't take that trade,

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Which is correct, but please take a look at EJ: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Maybe the EA only takes trades on the TDI crossover candle and doesn't wait for the ADX to drop/rise. In this case the TDI crossed the TDI Signal at 13:00 but the ADX was above 50, one candle later the ADX droppped and the TDI's were still below 32 and the TDI was above the TDI Signal....

Close of candle

Yes, but idea is the same...

--- 帖子 #335 ---
NOt really, M5 charts are way too volatilefor this system. Here's a quickexample of two entries compared next to eachother. Myentries are marked with the blue lines, the NLD would've sent a long signal in both cases later and at a higher price. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Do you see where I'm going with this?

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Yes, I do...it is Forex and anything can be interpreted positive or negative in the span of few minutes.....so whatever works is fine with me..not pushing anymore BTW, I was only advocating entries as dot changes color and not on the arrows...

--- 帖子 #337 ---
hi, sorry to be a pain but where should I start reading as looks different to the early pages of thread.? ​

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Post 208, 237, 250 onwards. And anything Math posts!

--- 帖子 #339 ---
I understand. Gotcha! Thanks, how hasit been on the M5 charts? I'd love to also trade it on quicker charts, just haven't been able tofind nice setups.

S&amp;P position finally closed. This is a great example of how you can bank on slowly trending prices. My original SL was set at 1% of portfolio. I kept on adjusting my TP keeping my eye on the TDI and the 32 mark. I then looked for resistance and set my TP right above it. This trade made me 2.5% / portfolio. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Acouple more weeks of practice and I'll go live. I can't wait to trade this. The fact that it works so well on the H1 chartmakes it even more fun to trade manually. EA's take away all of the fun. LOL

Hello GlobusFX The indicator is a CCI but with a diferent configuration or something, I don't know exactly what it does but it is an oscillator and have good potential of trades if we can found a good combination of indicators. Cheers

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Shemski, is this EA of Mathtrader or you trade manually?

--- 帖子 #343 ---
those are all manually taken trades. The system is super easy to trade manually. Have you played around with it? I've been looking at faster charts after Driven's posts and I must say, it could also be a decent scalping system. The idea is basically the same but with a standard ADX and more setailed rules regarding +DI and -DI within the ADX Iny. Rather than enterring above 68 and below 32, I would suggest something like 72 and 28. Exits would be around 32 and 68. I think it might be time to open a new thread soon...

Thanks Ranger For those who are interested, the following pairs are lining up: USDCAD AUDCAD NZDJPY EURCAD CADJPY UK100 HKG33 HKG is my current favor, love the upside.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Hi i am reading post and base on the rules you thinking to buy usdcad ?? audcad would wait until to see if brake lower low for the jpy i can see it but maybe basket jpy around 11 or 12:30 that is al manual yes? not EA thanks

--- 帖子 #347 ---
USDCAD is still not ready. The TDI has not yet crossed the TDI signal. The ADX indy is still between 30 and 50. USDCAD is also touching a very, very strong trendline from a trend dating back to June 2014. If it breaks and heads down, you will get stopped out. Heck, if you take the signal again, you'd be down another 100 pips (1%). But the return on this could be +1000 pips depending on when you chose to exit. I really, really like this set up. The AUDCAD setup is also sweet looking. Support is only about 40-50 pips away (a SL could even be set there rather than 100) but the upside is about 140 - 170. That's a killer R/R ratio!

--- 帖子 #348 ---
i am still using the fxst3cci not and when cross and bar leave 100 toward 0 i get in i do not get in when bar reach 100 only crosses i hope all ok but less trade but more stable i think thanks

--- 帖子 #349 ---
I install the awesome template everything looks fine and the same as the first post, but after i install the Snipper.ex4 into the chart a new FXSTCCI window appear at the bottom? What am i doing wrong here, is there any settings that i need to change in order to get the Snipper working? Can anyone point me in the right direction please as i'm not very technical in doing all the settings? Thanks

--- 帖子 #350 ---
yes online12793 just right click go to indicator remove one cci then load manualy the synergy pro tdi you should be ok after

USOIL Nasdaq Dow and a bunch of other indexes are lining up for shorts.

For those who missed the EURUSD long, it looks like it retraced it's original entry. I missed it myself, but willbe going long shortly after the open. Here are a few other pairs lining up: USDJPY, short GBPUSD, long GBPCAD, long GBPNZD, short AUSUSD, long AUDCAD, long NZDUSD, long NZDCAD, long CADJPJ, short The three bold pairs are my favorites, due to nearby support. I might risk 2% portfolio for each of those, putting about 12%/portfolio at risk. But hey, I trust this system and even if all 9 positions fail, I'll be back, waiting for the next signals. It looks like we have one helluva ride ahead of us this week. Green pips to everyone next week!

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Hey Shemski, i don't get the trade(Line) 3, why was it false trade? ADX has been between value 30 and 50 and TDI crossed back above 68. Am i missing something?

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Hi Math Any update on the EA? Thanks

--- 帖子 #357 ---
I suggest trading this system manually. It's just a lot more fun... So, today I finally hit the 50% mark. That since Feb 6th. Here are my open and closed trades for the day. The only trade which was not placed based on this system is the 1.20 Unit EUR/USD trade. I'm using my other system for that one. For those interested: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=580627 Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Green pips to all and good luck to those using my system! Once again, if you need any help, I am here to help you!!! And for those using the system, please post results. Thanks, Shem

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Shemski, do you eventually use the ADX also or only the TDI?

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Chart: H1 Long Entry: -CCI below 120 (less aggressive would be below 150) at least once during the previous 6 candles -TDI and TDI Signal below 32 (one could wait for TDI to cross back over TDI signal (while under 32) if you'd liek to play it safe) -ADX between 30 AND 50 (I try to stay away from extremely strong and extremely week trends) Exit on (semi) reverse signal (TDI above 68) or a SL of 100 pips. You can play with your SL and calculating your R/R is almost impossible because your profit will depend on the velocity of the pair and how the TDI moves. Just risk no more than 2% of your portfolio on the SL... I'd move to BE as soon as you get about 50pips. Again: If I see S/R close to my entry, I might tweak the strategy a bit. This is the beauty of this system! Good luck

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Hi Shemski, CCI must be below or above 120? If it must be below 120, then a long position will be taken even if CCI is negative (-100, for example)? Best, Math

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Below for a long position, above when going short. Would you mind spending some time on an EA based only on TDI and ADX, without the CCI?? EDIT: BELOW -120 OR -150 damn it, my bad!!!

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Version 1.51 is based on TDI and ADX only.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Perfect! Thank you. &lt;I actually had pretty good results with that EA. Thanks again!

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Here is Version 1.60 of the EA.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Awesome, will take a look at it after lunch. What did you change? Thanks again my man! You rule this forum!!!!

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Just closed all of those other positions right when the market got volatile this morning. These are my current positions for those interested. Guys, please post yours if you are using this. I'd love to see who is taking what! Thanks Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Math and Shemski, here is my run with your parameters.....can you see what is wrong?

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Modelling Quality? You've only backtested YTD, this system needs time. You'll have moments (maybe weeks) where the market is trending extremely strong and you'll get hit with a few losses in a row and take a hit...

--- 帖子 #369 ---
I agree, but this draw-down was 20%...not many can handle it...if they started trading as of January 1 2016..so it just a caution...

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Well, that all depends on how much you risk per position. Your biggest loss was 5% of portfolio, that is a lot considering you would trade this system on several pairs. If you drop that to 1% / portfolio than your draw down all of the sudden is considerably less. I try to never risk more than 2% per trade, even less if I'm trading several different pairs with the same strat. Thank you very much for your input though!!

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Here's a great example of why I like to trade this manually. The EJ run down was sooo freakin strong that the TDI/TDI signal crossover simply wasn't convincing enough for me. The fact that support is only 25 (!) pips away, I figgure it would be safer to wait this one out. As soon as I can get a nice bounce, I'll take this trade. As you can see everything is lined up; TDI, ADX, etc. The upside is about 200 pips, I'll most likely set my SL around 80-90 pips (maybe even less) and ride this one. This could be a huge trade! Attached Image (click to enlarge) EG looks a bit different. EU already broke support, so I'll wait for a bounce there.... Just my two cents on how to trade this. You need to use smart common sense, like almost everything in life. Systems and EA's are here to keep you focused. You are the fund manager!

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Hihi, thanks, i thought CCI is already out of the picture long time ago, becasue i haven't seen it in your examples recently. I can't see it on the picture in the previous post either.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
LOL, it is.... Well, it is for me. Just for the sake of this thread I decided to keep it included. At the end of the day, the TDI will cross 32/68 right around the same time the CCI crosses, so it doesn't really matter. I personally like the TDI much, much better!

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Shemski, could you please explane this one? http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...73#post8782273 Thanks!

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Thanks to original op for the thread. shemski- You probably are aware of this thread that uses TDI and has some good stuff on a similar system that you are trading. ck it out.-- http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=291622

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Good eye, you are correct. My bad!! That indeed, would've been a bad trade. Thanks for picking that up!

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Very aware of it and will join it soon. Do you also use the TDI?

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Shemski, I agree with you on entering closer to support. Can we ask Math to give us an option to enter with in 10-15 pips closer to S/R. We can use best S/R indicators available.....

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Go ahead and ask him. I'm just throwing ideas out there. If someone can make this even better, great... Let's do it!

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Math , can you give us an option to enter with in 10-15 pips closer to S/R. Please use any S/R indicator available, you probably know winch is the best for this EA, but if anyone has suggestions, please let us know.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
So it looks like you can keep yourself from taking a crapload of bad trades by simply adding a simple 200MA to the chart. Check out the below chart. Due to the fact that we will ONLY be trading with the trend, I've decided to change the entry rule to TDI above/below 50. In other words, we wait for the TDI to cross back over the TDI signal and take the trade as long as the TDI is above 50 for a short or below 50 for a long trade. As you can see below, the original system would've failed four times and would've been profitable only twice: Old Sytsem: Winning trades Nr. 1 Nr 8 Lossing trades: Nr. 2 Nr. 4 Nr. 5 Nr. 6 The new system went 3 for 4: Winning trades: Nr. 1 Nr. 3 Nr. 8 Lossing trades: Nr. 7 Attached Image (click to enlarge) Let me know what you guys think. this could be huuuuuge from smaller TF charts! The possible birth of a really nice scalping system! I amgoing to need some help with manual backtesting...

Hi guys ,it's time to open a new thread.We have drifted too far away from what was originally suggested. the new thread is here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=580923 I'll be checking in here, but spending most of my time over there. Thanks again to all of you who have helped me!!!

Hello MathTrader, I test your EA with the same parameters and time frame, the same date and the results is not like yours, what I'm doing wrong?
