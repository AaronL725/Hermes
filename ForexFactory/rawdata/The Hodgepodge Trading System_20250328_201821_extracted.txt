This Trading System and EA was inspired by the work of BigE (R.I.P.), Emmanuel, tony-fx, wizlon32 and Abokwaik. It is a Hodgepodge of their respective systems, strategies and perspectives that have been posted in these Forums. Thanks to each of you for your selfless input into my Forex Journey to date. https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=656770 https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=291622 https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=614720 I started this as a post for tony-fx's thread ( https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=656770 ) but thought it would detract from the "purity" of his system hence a separate thread would be more appropriate. The system essentially replaces tony-fx's Trend Filter (Ichimoku Cloud) with a Moving Average Cross on a Higher Timeframe. I have used the 5/8 EMA (Close) on the Daily Timeframe for trading on the H4 Charts. Additionally, I have introduced BigE's 5-SMA-Typical-Shift3 as the trigger for the Signal Candle. Echoing BigE here, the Ichimoku filter leaves too much on the table. The 'semi-martingale' feature has been maintained. Edit: We are now using the 5-EMA-Close-Shift 3 for the trigger line. Disclaimer; I am not a Programmer so while suggestions for improvement are welcome, updates will only be periodic - perhaps once monthly. Also, I do not have good/adequate Historical Data for extensive Backtesting at this time. Thread Rules Do whatever you wish with this EA Post your results and thoughts Indicators On Current Timeframe: Moving Average (5 Period, Simple, Typical Price; Shift3) Edit: Now using 5EMA_Close_Shift 3 On Higher Timeframe: Moving Average (5 Period, Exponential, Close) On Higher Timeframe: Moving Average (8 Period, Exponential, Close) Heiken Ashi Bill Williams Fractals (used by EA to establish Auto_Stop_Loss if enabled) Timeframe/Currency Pair H4/Gold (Other currency pairs and timeframes to be investigated) Buy Entry Rules HA breaks and closes above 5-SMA-Typical (Shift 3) Fast MA is above Slow MA on Higher Time-frame(s) Enter on open of next Candle Close trade when HA closes below 5-SMA (Shift 3) or on HA colour change (per Dean Malone Synergy) Opposite for Sell Money Management Position size: 0.1 Loss Factor: +0.05 Stop Loss: Optional (Auto Stop Loss based on previous Fractal high/low; Manual Stop Loss; No Stop Loss) Trailing Stop: Optional Options/Features: Stop Loss, Trailing Stop, Break Even Exit on HA Colour Change (per Dean Malone Synergy Method) Exit on HA Break of 5 SMA+Shift3 Re-entry on false reversal candle.

Congratulation my brother Krismitt. I wish the success come to you soon. Backtests shows a very low draw down which is excellent. I would suggest to carry a backtest for longer period probably 2005 and on ward..

Hi , good one krismitt. I am backtesting it in visual mode from 1.01.2017 .. on the way it opened trades with lots of 0.01,0.05,0.11,0.16 but on 23.3.2017 on this single day it opened 0.01,0.05,0.11,0.16,..................till lot size 4.66 that is (roughly like 100 trades with multiple of 0.05) in the span of 4 hours that day... I don't know if it was a bug because that many trades in this few hours on that single day is unusual , kindly have a look if it is a problem.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Thanks for sharing this EA. Maybe a silly question but, where do I put the 'settings' file? Also, what do I do with it? I've applied the template to the chart, and started the EA.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Put the set file here; File&gt;Open Data folder&gt;MQL4&gt; Presets Then when you attach the EA to a chart go to the Inputs tab in the settings and click on Load and then select the Gold.set file. The EA will now have the settings that Krismitt has pre-tested and set to file.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Pretty unusual Skat. I have attached my full results from 2017, which does not show those trades; have a look and compare. Have you used my .set file? Regards Attached File(s) Hodgepodge Gold 2017.pdf 2.5 MB | 1,902 downloads

Hi Firewight: The next version will include a built-in indicator to show Higher Timeframe Conditions on the (Current) Chart. Please note however that there are Multitimeframe Moving Average Cross Dashboard Indicators in these Forums that you can use for the same purpose. You can find some useful resources here https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=614720 See MTF MA Dashboard Indicator attached which is freely available here Trade Well.

If you trade Ger30, this EA might work pretty well for you. Trade well.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
hi, will the EA auto take profit? cause the option is not available in the settings.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Hello Menpowerup: Trades will be closed when HA breaks and closes above/below the Trigger Line (5-SMA). (However, you could use Break-Even or Trailing Stop Functions to achieve a hard Take Profit if desired.....but the system's success depends on the "letting the winners run") Trade well.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
thx mate!

--- 帖子 #29 ---
DowJones is also nice, might do better with a spread filter.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Good to hear Go5. Could you share your results with us? Cheers.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Krismit, I love trading Dax but I do get a bit nervous about using EA's (especially unattended). However I know from experience that you know what you are talking about so I will give it a whirl (initially on demo of course). I wish you all the best with your new thread buddy and also on your EA journey.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Shure, here's a test, since it is an index, only buying. The thing is, during "off-hours", the spread goes from 100 to 400 points so for a live situation an extra filter would come in handy. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

on default setting error 130. either need to change parameters setting or eu not the right pair

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Gold better result (but error 130 due to price jump on default setting)

--- 帖子 #35 ---
I made a short video to show how to use the strategy tester. I hope that is ok with you Krismitt. There is more that can be done but this shows the basics of how to run a test and record the results. The reason I did this is because I know that when I first wanted to test an EA in the strategy tester I had no idea what I was doing - It was actually Krismitt who told me what to do . I hope this benefits some people and helps this thread to receive more test results. I paused the recording so the video is quick to watch. If you know what you are doing already you won't gain anything by watching. If you un-tick the visual mode option you will get quicker results. The red boxes that I drew when looking at the test results show some of the most important information; 1st box is the settings you used to run the test. This is important if others want to use your settings or maybe modify them slightly. 2nd box is profit factor. You want this to be as high as possible. 3rd box is drawdown. You want this to be as low as possible. Others will know more than me but I hope this can get some of you started with your tests. Good luck Inserted Video

Hi OKShop: Have you tried the .set file from Post #1?. I will check on the error Regards.

Thanks. Looking at the trades I noticed very small profits / hardly any losses. So, on my platform the spread is 100 points (1 pip in DAX case) and when setting TS and BE also a factor 100 higher this is what comes out: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Explore this a bit more Go5, there is good potential here. Best to you.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hi krismitt, looking through the trades that are taken by your EA. I see that there is some form of trailing that is happening even within a 4hour interval. Could you share what trailing strategy you are using to minimize your risk? Thank you

--- 帖子 #47 ---
I think I have updated that .set file Aston? When did you download? Regards

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Krismitt, I did not download your EA actually, I merely downloaded the PDF file of your past trades to study the entry logic. That's where I saw your trailing to minimize risk. Am wondering how are you trailing for this strategy? thank you

--- 帖子 #49 ---
My guess is, that on his platform (as on mine) the 300 points TS are actually only 3 pips - which is why I multiplied all those settings by 100. Only guessing though...

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Understood. The EA was just developed and I have not yet used it on any live account. I like the idea of having options built into EAs (since I am not a Programmer) so that if they are needed at a future time (as the brain churns) they would have already been incorporated. For trading Gold, as intended, the Trailing Feature should really be disabled. Trade well.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
I would agree. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Hi Krissmit I like it. Thanks for sharing this EA. Its works the renko chart ? Best regards

Hi Wizlon32: Looking for this Indicator. Do you still have in your Arsenal? Thank you Attached Image

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Last nights trading on currency pairs showed some adjustments needed when whipsaws are present Attached Image (click to enlarge) These trades shouldn't have closed, but with the Auto Stoploss Set it was way to close.. According to Daily and weekly it was a momentary consolidation. Maybe Manual set at 100 would be the answer ( except GBP/xxx should be 200).. Always check higher timeframe when consolidation (whipsaw) is noticed. Otherwise works great. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) BTW .. How do you upload .set files and bypass the files not supported pop up?

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Also an option to add trades after 100 pips on first trade should be added to EA.. Let the winners run and add.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Thanks for your suggestion MTPockets. The Stoploss feature was really included as something that I would be looking at in the future but should actually be "disabled", which is solution for the issue that you have flagged. Optionally, we could incorporate an "Auto_Stop_Loss_Buffer" which I imagine would be a unique for each pair (wider for GBP/XXX pairs for example). Will include this in the next update. Good on you. Regarding the issue with the .set file, solution is to place it/them in a compressed (zipped) folder and upload. Trade well.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Looking into this. Thinking of adding at a "bounce" as well....... Cheers.

Hi krismitt, Thanks for the EA , loaded ea and set file into presets, running ea on gold h4 for 3 days no trade ? can you help, Thanks

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Don't think you have an issue Montego, since you are forward testing. See last two signals (bars) in the pic. (yellow arrows) EA would not have taken the last SELL Entry as this would have been filtered by the Higher Timeframe Conditions. Trade well. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi Been trading this Ea on Demo since 06/06 but it has opened one position, which was a winner, so has anyone got more trades than this?

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Try to understand the logic behind the EA. I presume you are trying to trade H4 Gold using the .set file that Krismitt provided? If so then you will see that on D1 the 5EMA is still above the 8 EMA which means that the EA is favouring longs. However on H4 we can see that price is now below the 5SMA so is favouring shorts. This has been the case since around midnight on 06/06. If you understand how this works you can adjust your settings and experiment and share your findings. If I got this wrong then you need to show your settings so someone can offer some help. Edit: H4 price below the 5 SMA does not favour shorts as such. A cross and close above the 5 sma is what you need for a long trade to open (as long as the D1 conditions remain the same (5EMA above 8EMA))

--- 帖子 #75 ---
bvc, wizlon32 has it correct.. we need more information (ie. Gold or Forex pair(s)) This EA is long term trading .. trading daily trend but entering on 4 hr... if your Daily trend is is still in the direction it was going when the first trade you had opened then re enter on a pull back ... but you'll need to monitor the trade manually.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
bvc: In addition to the very accurate comments by wizlon32 and MTPockets, the EA has some flexibility which you might wish to explore. For example, you could Disable the Higher Time-frame Check so that EA takes Trades in both directions (Trend and Counter-trend). There is a big difference however, between "more trades" and "winning trades". You could also adjust the settings to Trade the H4 Time-frame with Entries on a Lower compression (H1 for example). However, these are options that you will need to explore. You would also need to play around with Stop Loss and Trailing Stop Inputs. Trade well. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #77 ---
I am surprised not to see many more test results by now. This EA will make you money if you try. I know for a fact that it is a very well thought out and considered Expert Advisor. It may seem simple (which is a positive) but there is power in it's simplicity. As Krismitt said, Explore! Explore the settings. Explore the time frames and share your results. Then expand on those results. This thread could become one of the best EA threads that there has been.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Maybe I should be using this EA on a Practice account instead of a Live account .... but having been a follower of BigE (when he was alive and able to answer questions) and having great success with his method. This EA that krismitt has expanded on BigE's method by putting it into an EA that is simple and uncluttered and profitable. I'm thinking the next step on improving this method is putting it into a Dash (something like GVC has offered in his thread). https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=532236 What are your thoughts?? Krismitt I can't thank you enough for taking the time and effort for sharing. Respectfully MTPockets

--- 帖子 #79 ---
I'm thinking something like this .. Attached Image (click to enlarge) but instead of "Candle direction" , the 5 &amp; 8 ema cross in the 4hr, Daily, Weekly and maybe Monthly. And the Trigger (5 EMA shift 3 ) time frame in the place of "Signal" and the Hodgepodge template set as the Dash Template

--- 帖子 #80 ---
I am considering the following for the next revision of this EA:- Option to close Trade on HA Colour Change; and Option for re-entry after Colour change Option for exit of trade only on opposite cross of Moving Averages on Higher Time-frame What do you think? Regards Attached Image

--- 帖子 #81 ---
This is what I have so far .. if anybody is familiar with code please feel free to put Hodgepodge parameters in Attached File(s) Dashboard - HeikenAshi &amp; Strength-jos-1.mq4 88 KB | 500 downloads BTW ... I have no coding skills, all I did was help test the EA. . This EA was left behind (not because it was bad) as the thread went into a complete different direction.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Happy to support this move MTPockets. Let's see if one of our Programmers will adopt the challenge. This would provide a an alternate approach for those with a preference for Dashboard Trading. We will support the original version alongside a Dashboard if one is configured. Trade well.

My personal settings are set as follows: at the cross of the 5 sma (light blue) and 8 sma (red) on the Daily chart determines trend Attached Image then on the 4 hr chart, when the HA crosses over the 5 sma shift 3 and the second candle closes after crossing .. the EA opens a trade Attached Image and as long as they are going in the same direction you let it ride

I don't know what the EA's code is but I'll bet it's the suffix that is screwing it up. I don't think (at least the EA settings) don't have a Prefix or Suffix box. I think krismitt will have to address this issue when he comes online. Thanks for the information.

@ Krismitt - Thanks for this simple &amp; effective strategy with an EA :-) @MTPockets - Really appreciate your efforts in posting the charts and keep motivating. Couldn't ask for more. I have been using this since 2 days and seeing good results on Demo....thinking of fine tuning the EA with multiple trade management options like TP levels, multiple positions may be? etc...however am no coder, so will try and see if I succeed anyways...if you also have similar ideas please share and we can all help each other. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Tatachar, Thanks. I think krismitt has in the works the suggestions you mentioned (additional trades on pull-back), but anything you can bring to this fantastic EA is greatly appreciated Attached File(s) Hodgepodge Profile.rar 147 KB | 499 downloads All indicators and templates are a few posts back

--- 帖子 #116 ---
No worries at all Tatachar: Please feel free to post your suggestions here and they will all be considered. Per MTPockets (whose pockets are now filling up), I am currently working on the next version; in fact I m currently testing it. The new version provides an option for re-entry at the open of the second candle following a "fake-reversal candle", if the first candle after the "fake-reversal" is in the direction of the trade. See NZDUSD D1 Chart below. My early indications are that this works better on the D1 Time-frame and perhaps is not a winner on the H4. The Option to close at "fake reversal candle" (per Dean Malone's Synergy Method) is also included. I will complete my testing and post the new version early next week, excluding results. I will leave Traders to test and adopt at their own discretion, but will continue support both versions in this thread. Trade well. Attached Image

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Hi krismitt, I am soooooo excited to see the newest model !!!! Update (USDCHF &amp; EURUSD have the EA turned off, scalping them) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Green PIPS to everyone !!!!!!

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Thanks Krismitt for working/testing on the updated version. I am sure MTPockets will change his/her name soon to FilledPockets or the likes. Yes re-entry is certainly a good idea. Also, was thinking if we provide an option to have the EA open up multiple positions(say n*0.01) it would be better for trade management. Another idea would be to wait for candle close on the daily and not just take the MA cross instantly? e.g AUDNZD I had 17 trades opened few nights(I am on AEST) ago based on the Martingale and had series of loss(all of demo though)..reason being it was choppy ranging market at that time. Please see screen print below.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Thanks for your comments Tatachar; will consider them. I really like this comment by Emmanuel, https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...44#post9984744 . It seems a very good solution for staying clear of "chop" and I might include it as an optional Higher Time-frame check. This is also very useful for my Trading in General since it can be one of the filters in my weekend evaluation of currency pairs to be traded in the week ahead. Trade well.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Are you still having this issue Skat? Cheers.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Nice. So in essence we see the daily candle(s) and if it is consolidation/range then we may avoid taking trades on H4 - Did I get it right?

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Correct ... I have the Martingale disabled (that's just because I don't like it)

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Mr.MTPockets, hello. I was exciting about your result! I have a one silly question. How long do you turn on the EA or do you keep it working whole day except before major news? thanks and have a green pips!

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Hello busted, I have been closing the trades after a 24 hour period. Today will be the first time letting the EA run for longer than a day, just to see if I can reach a total of all trades over 500 pips. I'll let you know how that goes when I clear trades next Friday. I have discovered Major (Red) News doesn't really affect the trend in the Daily time frame ( which determines which trades close Auto by the 5 &amp; 8 ema crossing).

Awesome result! I wonder why this EA still have a great result. I have to sturdy about this EA harder. Have a good weekend all

Hi Krismitt, I didn't counter the issue again in BT. However I still have to forward test it. I am following the progress of this thread with interest and hope to contribute in near future. Thanks to you and MTPockets for your contributions. Regards skat

Heads-up Next Version of EA to have Inside Bar (IB) check on Higher Timeframe to avoid "chop" (Sideway/Ranging Market) on the Lower/Current Time-frame while trading. Attached Image So if Trading the H4 Timeframe, before opening a new position EA will check for IB Setup on D1 and if IB is present then the Trade Setup will be ignored. Similarly, if trading on the D1 Time-frame EA will check for IB on the Weekly Chart. So EA will have two Higher time-frame filters:- 1. Trend Filter - Moving Average Cross; and 2. Range Filter - Inside Bar Check, inspired by Emmanuel777 Trade well. Regards.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Awesome !!!!

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Hi Krismitt, Thanks for the updates you are working on the EA. I noticed this morning that GJ short was activated by the EA. If you see the daily HA candles are blue, however the cross has not happened for long yet. Do you reckon it's a good idea to include the condition where if daily candle has closed above Smoothed 5 MA(shift 3) then any short trades are void?

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Hi Tatachar, On the Daily timeframe the HA was blue but the cross of the 5 &amp; 8 ema still shows a short position. I would wait for the GJ to continue on it's downward trend, which shouldn't be too long from now. Attached Image The GJ has the highest ADR of all the Forex pairs (152 pips) so it is nicknamed "The Beast". It is hard to trade , but with the Daily giving you direction it is a lot easier to manage, just be patient.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
No worries MTP. I think I will have to turn the martingale option to NO and may be put a manual stop loss for trades. With the GJ, SL was hit 2 times and may be now it is going in the intended direction. I will adjust the settings for EA stop loss etc... and play with it.

Well done Morne72. I would love to see these same tests done with Loss Factor of 0.05. Much appreciated. Trade well.

One lesson might be to (always) take profits at the end of the week MTPockets? Regards

Nice!

--- 帖子 #144 ---
I do agree, especially if Asian session is really profitable (Take the money and run, then open new trades after London open). I opened these new trades an hour or so after the original trades closed. I guess I just need to be more patient. 4 hr trigger on Daily trend Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Thanks for this MTP.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Wow, that's real cool man. Is that all in one day or spanning across weeks? I had a good run with AJ too, last week though.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Thanks Morne72. This helps. May I know why you chose only Gold for testing? I know Krismitt has put this EA is/was used only for gold on post #1. Is that your reasoning as well. I tried to run the 'Strategy Tester' in MT4 with limited success. Modelling quality was N/A. Not sure if it has to do with data. Anyways, I may run the test against multiple pairs and see how that fairs.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
That's not good MTP!! I know how it feels, especially with you trading on live account!! You reckon any more filters would have avoided you going into a loss, say like tightening the trailing stops etc...? I am trying to get an optimum setting for the EA too.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
As soon as these trades I have open are in profit by $50.00 , I'll close and then try a new strategy. I'm thinking of leaving the trend Daily and putting the trigger (5 ema shift +3) on the 30 minute time frame. Then closing all trades at $20.00 combined total (kinda like Basket Trading). Edit.... I guess it would be Basket Trading

--- 帖子 #152 ---
I'm thinking about changing MM below 1.as soon open the trade by the EA, set sl to -20pips. 2.see 1hr chart and set tp to last swing bottom or top. kind like trailing stop. I'm so noob at FX.plz some advises about my suggest

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Turn on "Auto Stoploss" .. it does what you mention

Almost made up for yesterdays blow out !! YIPPEEEEEEEEEEE !!!! Attached Image And now trying out the 30 minute Trigger on Daily Trend

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Congratulations MTP, may I know where/how do you change the trigger settings? I can see that the MA cross can be set for a certain period. I thought if you change the cross period to daily the trigger is at H4 (one lower time frame) and that's how it worked.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Just change the chart timeframe for trigger, for a different trend timeframe change the settings to the lower timeframe I just want to change trigger to go with the Daily trend Attached Image If you are using my template change the Chart Indicator for 5ema shift +3 to show this

--- 帖子 #160 ---
I started testing on few pairs + Gold, Silver and WTI with MA 5-3 instead of 8-5 on Daily, trigger H4. I will post the results. Cheers!

He was probably the nicest person in the world. But I'm thankful for krismitt putting it into an EA.. Nice how the market is treating my trades Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #163 ---
From London Open to now. I think this EA is great in a day but in case of loosing, any trades which opened same or similar time hit LS so loss is bigger. However I love this EA and should more study! Thanks,

Built for GOLD. Works for many other pairs. Great if you would do some back-testing and share your findings with us Cheers.

RE-ENTRY Currently testing v1.1. Here is a re-entry in Gold, which is now coded into the new version. Can you tell what the Logic is? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Trade well.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
I am keen to see what your settings are. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
MTPockets, Just a gentle reminder here that this EA was designed for GOLD, but based on BigE's system we know that it works for other pairs as well. This is therefore a process of discovery in relation to which pairs to Trade with the system and what times (Sessions) to trade. Both were integral. As you know, he traded specific pairs and specific times - The London Session +the first three hours of New York. Trade well.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
I backteted EA GOLDUSD and GOLDEURO seems have all time best results, I'm currently running on my FXTM Cent account but the spreads seems around 5-6 pips, will that effect for performance of EA

The Hodgepodge 2.0 Options: Stop Loss, Trailing Stop, Break Even Exit on HA Colour Change (per Dean Malone Synergy Method) New! Exit on HA Break of 5 SMA+Shift3 Re-entry on false reversal candle. See post #165 New! Higher Time-frame Filters: EMA Cross; and Inside Bar. See post #130 New! Use AutoStopLoss as Insurance against crazy market moves (snap UK Election Announcement for example). Otherwise, and particularly with the new exit condition, there may be no need for Break-Even and Trailing Stop Features so these could well be disabled.

COSMETIC ADJUSTMENT V2.0 EA and .set file for The Hodgepodge 2.0. Didn't like the "wording" of the Exit Conditions so I have changed them to make them more explicit. In v2,0 they are:- Reversal Candle' and Reversal Signal Quite confusing In v2.0.1 these have been nominated as:- SMA Break; and Colour change Nothing else has changed. This EA has been inspired by a number of Traders and their systems as described in Post#1. In one sense it is also an attempt to automate the very simple system that BigE (RIP) has left us. I do not intend to complicate this very simple trading method and there is not much else that I can see that will change, going forward. One missing element is the " look to your left " advice from him, to check on Support/resistance before entry. I will be thinking about this and how to create a Logic to do it effectively. In the meantime, the Inside bar higher time-frame check is meant to do this - particularly when trading the D1 Charts. Trade well. Attached File(s) The_Hodgepodge 2.0.1.zip 52 KB | 397 downloads

thanks for great work krismitt. want to ask about exit condition. can be replace stop loss?? if we disabled stop loss, but set exit condition at SMA break. will that cut loss if true SMA break?? thanks again.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
It's really a matter of personal preference Dedetfx. I have said in a previous post that I do like the idea of a Stop Loss to protect small and/or vulnerable accounts from the inevitable erratic market moves. A stop loss is particularly helpful if you are on the wrong side of a trade in such circumstances. Perhaps you could do some back-testing to see what works better for you? Cheers and Trade well!

Hi Happy Traders.... I was kind of bored all day so I tried an experiment (it did so well I am trying it again 2 hours after LO).

Had that same problem when using "Auto Stoploss". Try setting to "Manual Stoploss" of 175 to take care of GBP crosses.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
krismitt, Thank you so much for putting the Hodgepodge into an EA. I think, like you've said, "It doesn't need anything else". If anybody has questions the answer probably has been answered in the first 10 pages.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
i think auto SL good enough, because we dont know when the price going grazy. we hope the system make profit to close the other minus from SL. in my oppinion this system have great effort because trend follower and nice exit condition.

Hi krismitt, can the latest updated versions &amp; set files always be found in your 1st post? Thank you! G

Hi dedetfx, That is why I've eliminated the GBP/XXX from the Hodgepodge ... way too erratic !!!

--- 帖子 #208 ---
in my opinion SL is best suit for me want to ask about re-entry status. i set exit at colour change, but then it go with trend again, but why it doesnt open trade again?? i though if price going with the trend again, then it will open again.. thanks and 1 question again about trailing stop, it says 300 if enable, real 300 pips or 30 pips?

--- 帖子 #209 ---
yup gbp cross pair have high violatie, but have high profit also lol.

Please post a screenshot showing the conditions where the trade was not re-entered. Make the trailing stop what you want it to be but yes, I start trailing at 300pips with stop trailing 200pips behind highest/lowest price. I am happy to do this when trading D1 with exit on colour change. Regards.

Good work Dedetex. Cheers.

this chart chfjpy H4. buy from yesterday, stop when colour change. then it doesnt re-entry again when new signal show up. or i'm missunderstanding with rule re-entry. hehe

dedetfx, thank you for being so observant, I didn't notice that either. krismitt, perhaps you can post a .set file like your D1 TF but for H4 TF. with the colour change (Edit) I posted my set file for H4 charts below (next post) and "Re enter" works great.

HERE IT COMES. THE HODGEPODGE V 3.0! Just received this back from my Programmer for testing/checking. In this version of The Hodgepodge will Trade the Signals if the pairs are Strong/Weak based on the CCFp-Diff Indicator. You can see this Indicator in action on the very hottest thread on FF at this time https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...0#post10041470 Credits to FerruFX, Forexpinbar and xmess7. In this version we have added a "Hard_Take_Profit" for those who need it. We have also included 5 Options for the 5EMAx 8EMA Higher TImeframe Cross (H4, D1, W1, H4+D1 and H4+D1+W1). There is also a small indicator shown in the bottom right hand corner that provides a visual on the Higher Time-frame conditions that are selected in the settings. Pretty cool eh?. Like I said.......wait for it Attached Image (click to enlarge) Have a good weekend and... Trade well.

Weekend Read: Here is a very excellent piece on the CCFp-Diff Indicator, found here in the FF Threads. Thanks to FerruFX, Forexpinbar and xmess7 Hodgepodge: The word Hodgepodge simply means " a jumbled mixture ".

Hi krismitt, I did find that to use the CCFp you have to disable the pairs being traded in the Hodgepodge, otherwise the Manager in Hodgepodge will close the trade down. But it is great !!!

Sorry for the confusion I caused Tatachar. I have my own system that is similar to krismitt's. dedeyfx I have 2 live accounts running on 3 screens. I monitor my primary Live account on 1 screen with a Trade Manager. I can't afford more monitors PS. I don't give a raving review unless I'm running it on Live accounts ... and krismitt has presented 2 methods that are established, tested systems that a follower of his threads can trust to be money makers. Trading on Demo is not the same as Live .. not even close to the same. Green pips to all

No worries MTP....didn't know you were also working on another system in parallel.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Tatachar, I am also doing tests for krismitts un announced new systems. Right now if the 2 methods were merged there would be the problem of the 2 methods cancelling trades. Krismitt only wants to provide the very best methods that don't conflict.

The Hodgepodge v3.0 Test Version Let's do this together!. I would like to have as many of us as possible testing this version of the EA and posting our results and/or comments. The objective is to develop, together, the very best settings for the best time-frames and currency pairs. Let me say at the outset that my preference is for the Daily Time-frame. This far we have had a few subscribers who have not shared their experiences/findings with this EA. Please do. Let's earn the green pips together! Any volunteers for testing?. My objective in this version is to eliminate the need for the 5 x 8 Moving Average Cross on the Higher Time-frame and to replace it with the CCFp-Diff Indicator for trend verification. With the 5 x 8 MVA Cross we will never be in on the big trend reversals as the higher time-frame signal will always be lagging and much too late with it's reversal (cross). But to do this, we also have to find the right settings for the CCFp-Diff Indicator. If you are new to this thread you must read the attached PDF (All questions regarding the CCFP_Diff Indicator will be directed to the PDF). Of course, one can always keep the HTF Trend Checks for extra security, and there are copious options Finally, please note that this version can be used exactly as you used all previous versions so you can disable all the new features if you are happy with Version 1, for example. Cheers. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached File(s) CCFp&amp;XM7 EA(Pent56) (2).pdf 786 KB | 1,007 downloads

hello Nice work! I agree to test, i already work on testing ccfp dashboard. The problem is that it also lags a lot. We should enter a trend at the cross between currencies ccfp or crossing of the 0 line. The idea would be to catch a strong HTF ccf and wait for a pullback in the LTF. Then wait for the cross of the ccf in the direction of the bih trend. Any comments?

I am Checking this out MTPockets; I am struggling to make the CCFp-Diff work well with the Hodgepodge. USDCHF H4 Just took this trade on my Live Account. Note with the entry the 5 x 8 EMA on H4, D1 and W1 are all " perfectly aligned " and your Heat Map is showing USD as the Weakest Currency and CHF as the strongest on the H4 Time-frame (I actually think I should be using the D1 Time-frame for this)....but let's see how it plays out.

Good luck !! I think I'll stay with Hodgepodge v 2.0 .. I have better luck with simplicity. The CCFp doesn't seem to do me any good ... all I've seen is exaggerated lots of Monopoly money being traded ... in real life 5.0 and above lots don't apply to us poor folk.

Hi Krismitt, Thanks for sharing V3.0. Now please let me know if I got this right: 1) Put SMA 5,0 and 8,0 on Daily - as template doesn't come with this. 2) EA set to D1 or H4,D1,W1 settings and trade should be triggered on H4 TF. Is that right or you reckon there is no need for me manually put those SMAs? I have it on GOld &amp; Silver as of now. Will put this on more charts and see if it triggers any trade.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
No I have withdrawn V3.0 so back to the previous versions. Regards.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
If you are trading H4 then yes, the Higher Timeframe Filter (5 x 8 EMA Cross) should be set at D1. Please note that I have withdrawn Version 3.0 for the time being so do not bother to use it. Continue working with the earlier versions. Cheers.

Hi Krismitt, i have been lurking on the thread and did post at the start a few times, i have been on another ccfp thread from the start with xmess7 and forexpinbar, the settings everyone seems to think work there and are most reliable are - Timeframe 10080 trade level 2 and either True/False OR False/False . My opinion is that 00.10 gmt is a good time to trade and 11.00 gmt. but obviously thats for basket trading, this EA is different, i hope that is of some use to you all, cheers. p.s i posted on this thread at the start and i did try version 1 but i could not get any profit from it, did you manage good results with any of the EAs if so Which EA ? and which settings as i would like to test again with better settings, cheers everyone and good Luck.

I dont think so... You see clearly higher highs and higer Lows = Uptrend, confirmed by the 5/8 Indicator/Flag on 1W. My opinion is, this takes maybe 3-4 candles until cross, 2 days more and the color of HA will change - MAYBE.

I had to disable Auto Stop Loss in conjunction with Break Even .. everytime an order got placed it would set the Stop Loss correctly but it would put the Take Profit at 5 pips and I couldn't remove the TP as it would close the trade.

Thank you Krismitt for a wonderful robot. I am also a great fan of BigE's thread, so I am glad that his logic was proved effective by this EA. Actually I got confused by several upgrades for a short period, but all now is going well. I am running 15 pairs, and now total about 500pips over in profit ! I have changed only a trailing and breakeven parameter to a quite moderate number. For example trailing start at 50pips,distance 40 for 4hr chart. I've been still looking for the better parameter. sorry for my English,but I wanted to say one word,Thanks!

Weekend Reads. This has been posted by Emmanuel7788 on several Threads in these Forums over the years. I have found it to be very useful; extremely useful!. This is my Inspiration for using the (D1+W1) 5/8EMA Cross Filters when trading on H4. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Trade well!.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Oh . So you don't use (H4 + D1 + W1) on the H4 chart? I didn't know, but it makes sense !!

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Sometimes I do; at other times I don't MTPocks.. One size does not fit all pairs; check them in turn. Remember in the first version of the EA we only did the higher time-frame check on the D1 Time-frame, but generally I am most comfortable with D1+W1 Cheers.

The EA comes with an Auto Stop Loss feature. It uses the Bill Williams Fractals to establish the "prior low" or "prior high" in order to place the Stop Loss when this feature is enabled.

hi guys, still a newbie here especially when it comes to EAs, I use to trade manually, until i found a full time job, now that's when i started reading about EAs as i still wanted to trade and wanted a second income. Now with this Hodgepodge trading EA, will it trigger trades for example whislt i'm at work or will i have to confirm them, or maybe it gives options before triggering a trade? Thanks in advance, looking to learn a lot more.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Welcome shay14, Krismitt has put together a truly remarkable EA. Yes you can go to work and leave the EA running. After you get use to the settings you find comfortable with (you'll find higher TF (H4, D1 &amp; W1 best )) then just let it run 24/5 and watch your profits go up.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
very interesting, also especially i enjoy trading gold, now another question, i can see the lot size is determined by the EA, can the lot size be modifed?

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Of course you will need to leave your Computer running at home while you are away. Alternately, you could subscribe to a VPS Service to keep you rolling 24/7. Some Brokers offer free VPS if you trade a certain number of lots per period (month etc). Cheers.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
how many trades a week do you guys usually get with the system?

--- 帖子 #361 ---
I forgot one important detail.... The EA will only monitor trades it has initiated, if you manually open trades you will have to set a SL &amp; TP and close out manually. It would be nice (hint, hint) to have the trade manager monitor all trades. I'm not a programer so I have no clue as to how that is done.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
I have (deliberately) refused to post too much of my discoveries on the settings. The reason is very simple; my desire is that we do this collaboratively, by trying different settings (on Demo Accounts) and posting/discussing them here so we can develop the "best settings" for the various currency pairs. Unfortunately, this is not happening. I will hasten to say thanks to the couple who have been posting their Charts and/or results. Please feel free to PM on any matter. that is pertinent to this thread/system. Cheers.

I only have 5 ma on the chart? hope to post some trades up on here soon of successful trades ?? regards Paul.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
G'day paulkeys Yes the chart does hide a few bars when price is going short, sometimes. Just zoom in a little. The number on the lower left is your pip count, positive or negative. The 5 &amp; 8 EMA is hiden , it is your Higher TF Trend direction. It determines when to close or open trades when in alignment with the H4 Trigger TF.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
wow I'm getting into this. those fluctuating numbers came from the pipsometer, so I changed it to the left corner of chart, I assume it tells me how many pips in profit I am... cool

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Paulkeys, Honestly, I just look at the charts from time to time and smile. This HP EA does (manages) all the trades.... you can almost say it's a "set and forget" trading system. Only thing I do is add trades on pull backs. The Manual trades I do have to monitor. Those I set at first with a 50 pip TS and reset it once the trades hit 60 pips to 155 TS

Hi Paulkeys: 5EMA x 8 EMA represents the status of the "cross" between the 5 period Exponential Moving Average and the 8 period Exponential Moving Average . When 5EMA is above (or has crossed above) the 8EMA (on your chosen higher timeframes) we look for BUY Signals only. When 5EMA is below (or has crossed below) the 8EMA (on your chosen higher timeframes) we take SELL Signals only. Here is some pretty good good reading for you.

Hi fellow Hodgepodge traders, It has been requested that I give you all a little insight to my trading with the Hodgepodge. First of all let me make clear that I've had many accounts blown in the past. Until BigE introduced me to the SMA Shift +2 or +3. Just like him I was ready to quit trading until someone told him of that little secret. Krismitt has taken the time and effort to put together an EA that BigE would be proud of. For sure. This insight of my trading will be in posts, not all at once. As you know trading is a thinking persons game, "One size does not fit all" and "Learn to adapt to market conditions". Very few methods are "set and forget" you have to be on your best game, otherwise you might as well write a check to someone else. First and foremost, for me, I trade the higher TF's and scalp the pair I'm trading until it gets in the trend and direction of the higher TF. The 5 &amp; 8 EMA might show a up trend but going to the chart might show a retracement that hasn't crossed the 5 SMA +3... leave that pair alone. Go to the next pair that IS trending in the right direction but a trade hasn't been triggered yet, then start going down in TF's until you find the TF that is "out of step" with the trend. Scalp that pair manually until the EA triggers a trade. (post #386 has a picture, GBPCAD has 2 trades... the first trade was a scalp trade until the HP EA triggered a trade when everything was aligned and all conditions were met). The scalp trade has to be monitored in case there was a trend reversal GBP crosses are famous for that). That's all I have time for now, wife needs me to water lawns and take trash out. I encourage you to read the first few posts over and over again until it makes sense to you... this is probably by far the simplest trading method around and will last as long as you adapt to market conditions. ( In fact reading The School of Pipsology provided for free from Forex Factory will give you a better understanding of market behavior. Green pips to all

Continuation, Here are 4 TF's of same trade... GBPAUD D1 TF Attached Image if you wanted to add to the trade start dropping down TF's until the PA match the Daily Trend. GBPAUD H4 Attached Image GBPAUD H1 Attached Image GBPAUD 30M Attached Image Once you've become accustomed to looking back you'll never say "There are no trades today", there is always a trade somewhere. Don't try and control the PA, you'll never do it... we are very small fish in an ocean of predators .. go with the flow !! I use a SL on this kind of trade until it gets to 50 pip profit, then I remove SL and let it run on D1 TF

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Hi, Those are very nice results indeed! Are you using the EA? If so could you please provide your .set file, I'd like to test it on a live account. Thanks

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Yes tillionaire, I use the EA and the set file is in the zip file in the first post.. it's labeled "Gold .set" But I do not rely solely on the EA, I improvise.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
continuation.... It looks like the PA has hit a major resistence point and starting to reverse it's course back into the trend of D1. With a 90 + pip draw back you might consider at this point opening a trade 4x the amount of the original trade and close the trade in 25 pips or let it ride until the 30M PA reverses again .. then you repeat the sequence until the trade of the D1 gets back on track and shows a reversal in the D1 TF Attached Image working the 30M chart in direction of D1 trend These trades are the only time I use SL to stop trade (I always use a emergency SL hidden)

Ah yes, that is good advise The OPEN-script The open-script will simply open NEW charts and will not influence existing trading. Depending on the input-parameter you can select if it will open 28 new charts or just new charts that are not already open. I always use the latter option. The CHANGE-scripts The change-scripts will change the timeframe of all open charts to the indicated timeframe (H4 or D1). This could potentially change the behaviour of running Expert Advisers when they need a specific chart-timeframe other than H4 or D1. The sourcecode is included in the zip-file so its easy to see what happens. These scripts are intended to be used when you are experimenting with settings of indicators and expert-advisors. On a system with live trading I would recommend to be very cautious with using scripts. Personally I use a separate computer for live trading. I try to keep that system as clean as possible regarding unneeded software.

Hello Krismitt and thanks for sharing this system with us. I've found this thread by chance and immediately has caught my attention because I'm building a system with a very similar entry signal, so I've registered To FF , and I've subscribed to your thread. After reading the thread, the first I've made is to try to replicate your gold test posted on the first page, but I can not with the newest version of the EA, because results are very different. So I've tried again with the first EA version and again my results are very different. Krismitt, I think I have the same settings as you, but my method is "every tick", but the difference is notable. Also, note that the majority of my profit comes of only two trades. I'm sure this EA and methodology are powerfull, but first I need understand very well how the EA works.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
this ea , even with martingale aspect enabled, really have potential , thanks for sharing it. btw , on backtest , there are a lot of order modify error 130 , seems the stop loss are to close , in fact i set it 100 , how can it possible? does anything wrong? tq

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Thanks for posting jquellbo and happy to have you on the thread. Before commenting on your results, I would like you to do some additional testing on some Forex Currency Pairs and post those results also. I have been promoting a collaborative approach here on this thread so we can work together to discover what works best for each of us. I see no issue with your gold results by the way. The only bankable results you get from back-testing is that the EA does what it is supposed to do . You should therefore do some forward-testing on a Demo Account. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
am i the only one who noticed trades will open on third HA candles? instead of just the second?

--- 帖子 #415 ---
The EA is coded to open trades at the OPEN of the HA Candle after the close of the Signal Candle. The signal Candle is the Candle that breaks and closes above/below the 5-EMA Cheers.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Hi shay14... They are the settings that I use

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Hi MTPockets. Are you using these settings for all the pairs?

--- 帖子 #418 ---
I've made some tests with gold, but not optimization yet. All the tests have been made with "every tick", and "visual model", by this way I have a clear idea how this EA works, and I have some conclusions and/ or suggestions. 1. The EA is designed to consider higher time frames, but the trades are executed in shorter time frames when the trends are in the same direction. Ok this is good, a solid and robust principle, but all trades are closed after a few hours so, Why we use W1 period? I've made tests with W1+D1+H4, D1+H4 and D1 (entries with 4h and 1h), and in my opinion, W1 is useless, because all the trades are closed after a few hours. It makes more sense, in my opinion, to delete the W1 and add 1H, because the system is short time oriented. 2 . Have you considered the possibility of stacking? For example, take the trades like now, but instead to close the full position, close only the half, let the remaining half run, until the trend of the higher time frame reverse. 3. In my first post, I said I work with a similar idea, and as you, I want to avoid range periods, so I been trying and testing different methods. This is one of the best I've found and maybe you will find it useful for your system. I use a Bollinger band with these settings: D1= period 5, shift 1, dev1. ( why period 1? because 5 days = 1 week). 4h= period 6, shift 1, dev1. ( why period 6? because 6 bars of 4h = 1 day). 1h= period 4, shift 1, dev1. ( why period 4? because 4 bars of 1h = 1 bar of 4h). 30min= period 8, shift 1, dev1. ( why period 8? because 8 bars of 30min = 1 bar of 4h). 15 min = period 8, shift 1, dev1. ( why period 8? because 8 bars of 15min = 2 bar of 1h). Now, look the attached chart. When a bar opens and closes above/ below of the BB, is my signal bar ( is better if the high and the low are also above/below). When the trend is strong, the following bars open and close also above/below of the BB.It's a hot market. Here is when we are interested in opening trades. When there is a bar that open and closes in the BB, then the trend is losing momentum and most probably is going to have a ranging period. I attach the tests, maybe someone is interested with.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Sorry, I forgot this test. This is gold 2016-2017, D1+h4, sma break as a exit, and martingale factor of 0.03. Now, I'm going to run an optimization. I'm not a big fan of the optimizations, but let's see what happen.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Yes .. to enter trades then I switch over to D1 only 2 . Have you considered the possibility of stacking? For example, take the trades like now, but instead to close the full position, close only the half, let the remaining half run, until the trend of the higher time frame reverse. I also do stacking. Somewhere in this thread I have a picture of Stacking a lower TF in direction of D1 trend (post #381) then close the full positions when D1 trend is exhuasted. Thank you for posting your suggestions. We get better with this system when traders share ideas.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Yes MTPockets, I've seen your post about stacking. I like stacking too, for these reason I was suggesting the stacking as a new feature of the EA, if Krismitt consider this opportune.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Thank you for your excellent work here jguellbo; your thoughts are much appreciated and our goal is to extract all the learnings we can from this type of analysis. Good on you!. There are two fundamental principles which are very active behind the scenes of this thread and they are:- 1. Simplicity; we want to keep the system as simple as possible; and 2. Freedom; the EA is Coded with options for just about every setting so that Traders can do whatever works for them in terms of the settings. 1. The EA is designed to consider higher time frames, but the trades are executed in shorter time frames when the trends are in the same direction. Ok this is good, a solid and robust principle, but all trades are closed after a few hours so, Why we use W1 period? I've made tests with W1+D1+H4, D1+H4 and D1 (entries with 4h and 1h), and in my opinion, W1 is useless, because all the trades are closed after a few hours. It makes more sense, in my opinion, to delete the W1 and add 1H, because the system is short time oriented. [Krismitt] The EA is deliberately coded to consider higher time-frames and much depends on the time horizon of the individual trader (Scalper, Day Trader, Swing trader Etc.). The following chart explains why we have coded the EA to include for the weekly time-frame:- Attached Image (click to enlarge) Most importantly, however, is that the EA is designed to allow each trader the freedom to use whatever higher time-frame he/she wishes. The weekly time-frame is included for "whosoever will". I do. I have also been inspired by STRARS PASR Attached File(s) STRATS PASR (1).pdf 2.2 MB | 459 downloads 2. Have you considered the possibility of stacking? [Krismitt] Yes, this is something for future updates. 3. In my first post, I said I work with a similar idea, and as you, I want to avoid range periods, so I been trying and testing different methods. This is one of the best I've found and maybe you will find it useful for your system. I use a Bollinger band... [Krismitt] We have considered and have made provisions in the EA for Ranging Markets. https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...45#post9989545 I like your approach as well. Please continue to share your insights with the Hodgepodge community. Trade well.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
I think krismitt has considered this , but he would like for the method to remain as uncomplicated as possible sticking to the original idea that Big E presented years ago. Also , newbies would get lost advancing to that level, let them get use to the idea of trading the basic method. We don't want to overwhelm people as they would get discouraged way too quickly Krismitt, I didn't know you were also responding ... you beat me to the punch !! Your answer is much better than mine

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Hi all - v interesting thread and lovely EA. I've been having a play over the last week and agree stacking really adds juice. As far as I can see (and correct me if I'm wrong, which I often am), if the EA had a 'none' option on the trade exit criteria you could manually stack to your hearts content, or add a TF to the trade exit criteria. Then for example you could enter at the H4 signals and exit at say a cross of the daily 5sma (or HA colour change). Nothing new there, and I know you'll already be thinking of it. I also think basket trading would work really well.

--- 帖子 #425 ---

Hi there Hollowhead: Whenever I want to squeeze that juice I simply remove the EA from the chart after break-even and trade the position manually from there. By doing this I can also flip to the Higher Time-frame and exit using my desired criteria. Keeping it simple, specifically for those among us who are new to trading and/or this system. Cheers.

Hi all, thanks for his nice thread and ea Who trade this ea on live account? Thank you.

Hi, I started last week week testing on SILVER. This is a set of trades that shows the Martingale in action. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I set the timeframe to H1 so that the trades are better visible in the screenshot. The EA is running in H4. This week I will run it on 28 pairs (H4).

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Another example for SILVER... Attached Image (click to enlarge) As you can see it took a SELL where I would only expect a BUY. The trend lines clearly show an up trend. This could be because my settings are not correct. I wll have to check that. PS: This trade was initiated on the H1 TF. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #435 ---
I understand, however does it take candle numbers into account, for example, would it enter on second candle or it's not relevant to the EA rules?

--- 帖子 #436 ---
also what about trading times? my 4 hour candles are 6am 10 am, 2pm and 6pm, 12pm,Uk time I Find that its best to trade from 6am to 2pm

--- 帖子 #437 ---
I have also noticed during testing, some candles will close below MA for example and ea will open a buy trade on next candle

--- 帖子 #438 ---
There is no provision in this EA for you to set the time-frame. The EA trades the time-frame of the chart on which it is placed only ("Current time-frame"). You can only dictate the Higher Timeframe Filters. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
The rules are exactly as I have described. Cheers.

Hello everyone. Attached you can find my optimization results. Also I attached a .rar archive with the 10 settings most profitable, and a word document with the settings obtained (only the most profitable).

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Thanks a lot for all those results! I see you are using a TP in (some?) of them - is this working on the buy side? I tried to use TP but the EA (V 3.1) did not put any TP on for buy orders.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Yes, you are right, the EA doesn't send target profit orders for buy orders. I suppose there is something wrong in the code. There is another thing is worth to say. I've been running test with two different brokers, and I've seen they doesn't count pips the same way. I said this because of the settings attached in my previous post. If results of the tests using those settings are bad, try to change the amount of pips, adding or substracting whith a 0 ( if stop 90, add a 0-&gt; 900)

After the optimization, I've run a couple of tests from 2012 to 2017. One of them with a fixed lot, the other with a martingale factor of 0.03. In the attached rar file, you can find both tests, also a settings file (without martingale).

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Excellent!. I was just looking at this issue of re-entries in strong trending Markets. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Yours is an H4 Trade Spijack, but do some homework on these re-entries on the D1 time compression. I have taken some profits and switched my Gold Trade to the D1, but look at what I see.... Attached Image (click to enlarge) So one approach to this system could be to look for strong trends on the D1, wait for a "retracing candle" then drop down to the H4 and stalk the pair for an H4 entry. Notice that although there is a pull-back candle (in both cases), there is no change in the Heiken Ashi colour - hence no valid re-entries on the D1 Timeframe 'Would love to see some analysis done on this... Trade well.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Krismitt I have sent a request to the coder who built these 2 indicators and hopefully get them combined into one. The idea is that on higher TF's the trend might be going in one direction but the HA might be in a slight pull back (could be 100 + pips) and not breaking the 5 &amp; 8 EMA. With this combination you could avoid getting caught up in the pull back and avoid the draw down. This isn't what I'm talking about in the previous post ... but just an idea I'm working on ...

Good on you Bro!. Looking forward.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Lol. Happy wife, happy life! Remember that The Hodgepodge is presently coded to open a (re-entry) position as soon as the HA Candle pulls out of the retracement in this scenario. I would rather see you spend some time looking at the scenario where there is a retracement in a strong trend but with no Heiken Ashi colour change Cheers.

I've been running some tests with D1 as entry time frame (2016-2017), change of color as exit method, martingale factor of 0.03 and reentry, another one with the same settings but without reentry, and another one without martingale. moving average time frame filter is D1 After that, with the best settings of the previous three tests, I run a test from 2001 till 2017, with martingale factor of 0.03, and reentry, with the change of color as exit method. Common sense, says that results should be better with a target profit related to the buy orders because the price is reaching the target area, and usually, the trade is closed with a lower price when the trailing stop is reached. However, sometimes, the EA catch a very good runners, with a very large profits, because there isn't target related. So, is better with a target related or without it? At this point, I don't know. More tests must be done. I have attached the basic settings for this tests.

Great Stuff!. Continue to forward trade on a Demo account certainly for the next two weeks, to get a good handle on the settings and what works best for you. Remember, one size does not fit all (different settings for different currency pairs). Have a good weekend. Cheers.

Hi, I've tried to download history from https://tickstory.com/#features . Everything is ok until to opened the metatrader. Once I've tried to launch metatrader, there is an error. Is there somebody here with the same problem?

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Hi, i want to report on the results for 28 pairs. First of all I started this week with trading the H4 timeframe, in combination with my own set-file. Unfortunately that was a big no-no and i lost $44 (demo-money). On Wednesday evening I closed all open orders and switched to D1 timeframe with the default set-file. That seems to work better. Since the first trade opened on thursdaymorning none of the trades has actually closed so the results so far (+$14) are what it is now. I will post some of the results with my comments/questions. First AUDCHF: Attached Image (click to enlarge) This trade looks good, with a lotsize of 0.01 its now at +$10.17. Funny thing for this trade is that there is no TP set. I would expect it to be set to 200 pips. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Next AUDJPY: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) This one is not doing well. As there seems to be a double top I think this one has chance to end in a loss. Note that this trade has also no TP set.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Next EURNZD: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) This one is negative just now but there is a good chance that it will go positive. Note that the TP is set.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Next GBPCHF: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) I am happy with this one. Nice profit in the making. Again no TP is set. According tho the set-file it should be at 200 pips.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Finally my order overview: Attached Image (click to enlarge) What I like is that although I am trading on the daily timescale there are plenty orders. Some of the trades seem to be going pearshaped but overall I am happy with the result so far. I will keep you guys up to date of the developments. One point of concern: Personally I am getting a bit nervous when I see multiple trades involving the same currencies. For example 5 of my 10 trades have GBP in them. That means that if something happens to the GBP a lot of my trades might go south. For me this means that I will manually shift the SL to break-even for those pairs that are positive. Just to manage the risc. Of course you could say: "Well, don't trade 28 pairs then!". But for those that have long working days, and use a trading robot because they can not be behind the computer all day. They want their trading robot looking out for any opportunity but not overdo it. If I would be trading manually and 5 GBP opportunities would present itself I would try to select the one with the best prospect and only trade that pair. Once that is positive and break-even is protected with SL I would consider another trade with the same currency. But that is of course my personal preference, and it would require multi-currency capabilities for the EA. So lets leave that for a future version. And after all, there is nothing wrong with mainaining your orders once per day manually. Cheers .

With all three Higher Timeframes purely aligned, this should be a good Swing Trade (provided the SNB does not intervene!). Cheers.

Another good trade from a technical point of view but the CHF weakness cannot be trusted. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) is "never asleep". Cheers.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Watch what each trade is doing though. You have 2 sells &amp; 3 buys in GBP so you're just +1 in GBP. Your biggest exposure is AUD @ +3, NZD @ +3 and CHF @ -3. AUD &amp; NZD are highly correlated so largest exposure there if China coughs.

EA trades are auto, is that correct? For that to happen I have to have HP running? Have to make sure computer doesn't go into sleep mode.? Can I adjust SL and TP?. Thanks. Have a great week. PS. If you wish the weekend was over so you can go trading, DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM. Just askin?

So switching to higher time frame on open trade alters the TP scenario.?? Cheers.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
I've been getting my head around that for the last month since I started looking at Forex. Also some EA will only go to 4 decimal places whereas your broker might go to 5. I mainly use MT4 which uses all decimal points availability for a particular pair . You have to be careful. Terrible to wake up in the morning to find you placed a trade with a 2000 SL.

Hi Paul I hope you are planning to take some time to learn the basics of Forex Trading before committing any of your hard-earned funds to live trading. Many of us in here are willing to facilitate this process so please feel to ask. We know a lot about Forex Trading, and have been trading for a long time (some of us) yet we still loose money and sometimes blow our accounts. I guess what I am saying is, take the time to learn, before putting any money on the table!. Ps: If you wish you can PM me. I will give you my skype address and commit some time to you, at your convenience, to respond to your specific questions about this system. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Will do Thankyou.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
It could close your trade, since the entry conditions might not be met on the higher timeframe. If the switch is made too early, the EA most likely will encounter an exit condition and close. So before switching, you should examine the trade on a separate chart of the same pair (at the higher time-frame) but with the EA removed. Cheers.

MTP, mate, just worked out you posted a new HP ea in post 137. Couple of Q. What are the bars on the end of chart pattern with RDL,RWL etc mean.?

Hi, Expert Advisors come in several types, but the HP is indeed detecting, opening and closing trades for you. For an Expert Advisor to work the computer must be always on. Some brokers offer a VPS for this purpose. If you use your own computer or laptop then it is important that you make sure it doesn't go to sleep. Personally I use an old computer for running EA and keep that always on (it's actually in my cellar). Maintanance, checks and reading the forum (and programming) I do from another computer.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
paulkeys Right side of chart lines is Daily High &amp; Daily Low also Weekly High &amp; Weekly Low. Across the top LO = London Open NYO = New York Open AO = Asia Open Moving to Higher TF ... Depending on the Daily Range of the particular pair you are working with (all Forex pairs are not the same) when you reach 50 - 100 in profit turn off Auto Trading and put the "Daily" Template on your pair that you are working with ( you should have them already preset so you aren't wasting time guessing as to what you want the settings to be) Attached Image GBP Trading .. These I am looking into grouping all together and trading the Pound in an "Offline Chart" ( Money Management easier). An example is here (but using Aussie in the picture, ALL Aussie crosses on one chart) https://www.forexfactory.com/attachm...4&amp;d=1497264941 At the moment I only trade 1 GBP/XXX at a time. When I get a signal on any Pound cross I disable the rest. In order for EA to work computer that your MT4 is on MUST be on 24/5.... SL &amp; TP is taken care of by the HA price action .. If you zoom out as far as you can, on any chart you have, you will notice the greedy Brokers and Market Makers have some out of this world, unbelievably impossible spikes (known as Stop Hunting) ... and no matter what SL you have, 100 - 5000 points you will suffer a loss.. of course if you profit.. your broker will not allow the spike to profit you and they will make some excuse to take that profit away... unfortunately, it doesn't work the other way around if you lost. I hope I've answered all the questions so far

Thanks Wileypeyote. The Inside Bar Filter was introduced for D1 Trading. I did a number of back-tests using it with H4 Trading and the results were disappointing; it filtered out more than 50% of possible entries, many of which were pretty good to I abandoned the idea. Evidently, you have used it with some success so I am going to have another go at it!. Iron sharpens iron Trade well.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
For those that have questions about adding to a HP trade... let's go through this trade together ... Hodgepodge opened a trade on the H4 sometime while I was asleep (#1 on chart) without changing the chart I opened up another chart using Hodgepodge No EA. I looked at Daily chart to see where the trade is sitting on the candle .. still on H4 after NY open GBPJPY dropped to the bottom of the H4 candle. without changing the chart I placed up a second trade (#2 on chart) .. All this is shown on the Daily chart (notice I have the 5 &amp; 8 EMA and the 5 +3 SMA on the chart, so I can see in what relation the trend is to the trades. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Now we will SOOH's (sit on our hands) and let the trade unfold... hopefully it goes the right way. Question I have disabled the Hodgepodge EA on the H4 chart and switched to the Daily chart with that EA disabled ... Why ?? (Anyone other than krismitt please answer) ************EDIT************ I'm thinking the best way to trade these Pound crosses is on the Daily chart. Still has too much risk on H4 charts. *****Results***** Woke up this morning and I thought I was seeing the U.S. Housing bust from years ago .. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I waited for an uptick on the 15 minute chart and added number of all lots I had in the trade , to lessen the pain , then closed all trades. Maybe next time things will go good.

USDCAD UPDATE Still in. Attached Image (click to enlarge) HTF filters were turned off for entry. Have since enabled them so as to keep my eyes on how the pair is developing. Trade well.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
I have it on from some previous tests across 28 pairs. While I did notice some major trades not being taken, it seemed to filter out the ranging periods that happens around middle of NY session to Tokyo/London session. I read the TMS thread that Big E started, and since he quit trading at a certain time of day due to ranging markets, I figured it would be a useful filter to keep the trash trades from starting. But it still allows some trades that occur for whatever reason, news, market makers, etc. So far, so good! Thanks, again, for this system.

Same scenario as the GBPJPY trade that I was hoping to follow but the ECB had different ideas. GBPUSD , I'm hanging onto for awhile and see if it can be recovered. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Thanks! It's just theory really, a concept that so far for the rest of this week hasn't really panned out. Will screenshot tomorrow, after NFP. I think your trading session idea would be a great addition actually. It would be nice to have multiple instances (maybe 3, with a true/false setting to turn them on or off) too, so that if there were news events coming out, I could set the EA to be on for a small window in the middle of the "closed" part of the day. Not at all a request, but I would happily test it if it were implemented!

--- 帖子 #590 ---
I love ideas.....I spend hours testing and checking out the good ones. If yours has merit it will have a place in my Arsenal. I am only considering Sydney, Tokyo, London &amp; New York with "Yes/No" for each, and option to "Close_all_trades_at end", like BigE did. In due course.... Cheers.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
As promised, here are the results, post NFP: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Each window has the most recent trades on it. Summary of the results: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Same settings as I posted previously, lol. I think that maybe the 5x8 cross on the D1 may be a little slow? At first glance, it looks like if I had left that filter off, perhaps I would have done better with these pairs. But a quick glance at my tests with 28 pairs looks like that would have been a mistake. So maybe just a rough week for the Hodge Podge. Any input on these trades and what I could have done to have succeeded would be great.

Had a net loss this week as well; lost $400.00 thereabouts. Played around too much with USDCAD and lost some there, plus yes, ECB gave me a kick in the gut!.

Ha ha, nope. Sorry I used the wrong template. I have the EA on a different computer then the one i took the screenshots from. Sorry for the confusion. I will make sure I use the correct template next time. I decided to take the profit before the ECB and NFP so no losses for me this week . Cheers.

UPDATE Went out today and came back to see both trades closed!. Phew!. Reason: I entered on the H4 and switched to D1, but forgot to change the EA settings, specifically, the "move_stop_to_break_even". The H4 settings are much too tight for the D1 so once the switch is made, the settings must be adjusted to match the D1 Time-frame. My Stop to break-even on H4 for example is usually at 30 pips but for D1 it's always 100 pips. Lesson learnt!. Ps: I have re-entered the trades manually. Regards.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Thank You

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Sure jansb: This was requested by another Trader in an earlier post and there is merit to it. At present some of us enter on the H4, then flip to the D1 and manage the trade(s) from there. Why do we do this?. Simply to evade the H4 exit Conditions, since we have to select one or the other So having a "No Exit" Condition allows us to exit our trades whenever either our Stop Loss, Trailing Stop or Take Profit is hit. Good for swing traders and of course is just an option. Take Gold for example; strong Uptrend. But any of our two exit conditions would have seen us in and out of Gold in the midst of a strong uptrend - if we were trading the H4 Timeframe. I would have preferred the option to rely on my Trailing Stop to take me out of this trade. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Cheers.

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Nice Jansb. I reckon though, that these are all too tight for D1 Trading:- Attached Image Did you have any trades that were stopped out?. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #623 ---
You are onto it here Inescapable!. I have looked at this and I am of the view that D1 trading without the Higher Time-frame Filters is the exceedingly profitable when trading Gold. I have also been looking at OIL similarly (doesn't work for all pairs). Edit: Martingale feature would need to be Enabled for this and no re-entry. The Higher Time-frame Filters will negate the swing high/low entries which are all excellent entries for this pair. Good on you Attached Image (click to enlarge) GREEN PIPS NEXT WEEK!!

In my post - only the one that was negative by a couple of EUR. All the rest were positive. https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...2#post10180872 I am very happy with the results so far.

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Yes, I guess you have a point. I am just too scared to let a positive trade turn negative. I guess thats leasons from the past - never ever get greedy - be happy with small profits. So I set the break-even early. I understood that the defaults were meant for gold-trading so I decided to go in very carefully to find settings that I can use (and trust) on my real account. So far these settings work out for me, but I might have made more profit with giving the EA more room to breathe. This week I will switch to version 3.1.1 with the same settings. Then I will decide if I am going to change the settings towards more suitable values for D1 trading.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Hi Krismitt, yes that looks very good. I now understand what the benefit can be of the no-exit option. PS: Personally I have lost some confidence in the strategy testing mechanism of MT4. I have created my own EA's in the past and had all parameters tuned only to see that in practice it didn't work out at all as tested. So I am very careful with parameter sets obtained from the strategy test. The strategy tester is greatly improved in MT5. But porting an EA to MT5 is a bit challenging. Anyway thats off-topic.

Little bug in HP3.1 I was trying HP31 on a micro-account. It didn't open any trades today (running on just 4 pairs). However, I noticed that the text in the lower-right corner doesn't come out good. Its running on the NZDUSD pair in this example but the 'NZD' is covered by the graphics. A cosmetic problem so to say... Attached Image Cheers

Closed most of this this trade leaving 0.02 (2 micros) You will note that I am using this EA in semi-automatic mode. I'm just trying different things. I have now closed GBPCAD, GBPAUD and Gold Trade. One of the things that The Hodgepodge doesn't do, which was an integral part of BigE's Method, was to "look left" before entering a trade (check for support/resistance areas). This is something for future development but for now I do it "by eye". I am basically applying the same principle to these manual exits. Cheers.

Suggestion: Would it be possible to add a parameter for the maximum allowed spread? I noticed that some currency pairs (on one of the 28 pairs that i am testing) have really big spreads at certain times during the day (often late in the evening or at night). I would like a setting in the parameters where I could simply say: don't open a trade when the spread is more than x pips. I have seen spreads that go over 25 pips (250 pipettes for a 5-digit broker) during the night. I would like to limit my trades to a maximum spread of 10 or 15 pips. (EURDKK goes to above 80 pips at some times, but i stopped trading that all together - not a member of my 28 pairs). This is a bit of code that I use in my programs: Inserted Code // === Check spread, do not trade huge spreads === // If the spread is unreasonable high it becomes difficult to make // any profit at all because the chance of gaining just the spread // is very low. The spread is not constant so we better check it. double ls_allowed_spread = cSpreadLimit; double ls_current_spread = MarketInfo(i_symbol, MODE_SPREAD); if (ls_current_spread &gt; ls_allowed_spread) { // str_detail = "actual: " + DoubleToString(ls_current_spread,0) // + " - allowed: " + DoubleToString(ls_allowed_spread,0); //return NTR_HIGH_SPREAD; ... do not trade huge spread ... } In my code I use a function that checks all kinds of no-trade conditions. If a no-trade condition is found the function returns with an explanation (str_detail) and the type of error (NTR_HIGH_SPREAD). Just an example of how I do this. Cheers.

Hi. I came across this thread and this incredible EA couple of days ago and I must say that this is amazing. However I know that this is supposed to trade on higher TF, but I like better low TF and got idea from MT Pockets to test M5 with H4 inside bar and it looks very good. I wanted to test in hard conditions with little deposit of $400 with fixed lot 0.1 no exit, TP and SL 100 pips and trailing start 60 pips. I've got around 50% DD first day after opening asian sesion and after that got in profit. This is demo account and just 2 days old but it looks very promising.

[Quote = majamivice; 10236149] Ciao. Mi sono imbattuto in questo thread e questo incredibile paio di giorni fa di EA e devo dire che questo è incredibile. Comunque so che questo si suppone per scambiare su TF più alti, ma mi piace più basso TF e ho avuto idea da MT Task per testare M5 con H4 all'interno del bar e sembra molto buono. Volevo testare in condizioni difficili con scarso deposito di $ 400 con lotto fisso 0,1 no exit, TP e SL 100 pips e trailing start 60 pips. Ho avuto circa il 50% di DD il primo giorno dopo l'apertura della sessione asiatica e dopo che ha ottenuto il profitto. Questo è un demo account e ha solo 2 giorni, ma sembra molto promettente. {Image} [/ quote] can you post your settings? thanks

Hi, it happened again !!! Hi, it happened again !!!

--- 帖子 #704 ---
Are you trading on H4 Timeframe?. You are using Auto Stop Loss; no Break Even, no Trailing Stop and no Exit hence your trades should only close at either of:- Stop Loss; or Take profit. Your Journal does not show that all your trades were closed at once, but i note a couple were closed at one minute intervals......I am wondering if your stops may have been hit by the High Impact News on 7th September, but that would require bit more analysis Attached Image (click to enlarge) I am posting a screenshot of your settings here; perhaps someone else might see something...

Great thread and nice EA. I learned about TMS 5-6 yrs ago and used successfully (after a bit of paddling) for a while. I also tried to compile an EA to automatize my trades during the night hours (I live in Italy) but then abandoned the project also due to my low coding skills. Krismit, you've done a great job, the EA is rich of interesting features such as BE, Trailing-stops, and fractal SLs. I have to say that seems to me that takes a bit too long during backtesting (everytick mode). I found some pieces of codes to insert in my EAs which reduce the backtesting time a lot: Check here: https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...02#post8447802 Especially the Inserted Code ObjectsDeleteAll(); makes a huge difference in my case. Hope it can be helpful for your projects too, if you haven't used something similar already. my 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #708 ---
Awesome thread. I have been trading with TMS with some success and am just humbled with what I have seen in this thread. Thanks to everyone who has been involved in this project. I have downloaded and installed the EA in my MT, ready to be an active participant in this thread. Cheers and Green Pips to all! ~Peter

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Thanks Lorbax. Will take your recommendations on board. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Glad to have you here Peter. Looking forward to your contributions. Trade well.

--- 帖子 #711 ---
Suggestions Krismitt. 1. I think there is a way the EA can be modified so that the user chooses the specific time frame to trade. This will ensure that in case someone changes time frames, the trades that are already running wont be affected and no new trades get opened. 2. A modification so that in case you close MT and reopen it, the trades already running will not be affected... i.e... no new trades get opened until new signals are found. Cheers

--- 帖子 #712 ---
What does it do now ? Do it re-open new orders ?

--- 帖子 #713 ---
Sorry, I have 2 EAs running in my MT. The other one is the one that has been doing that. I had not looked at the comments... I guess am a bit sleepy, been studying all day and night.

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Ok that's good.

--- 帖子 #715 ---
Hi Smartboi: Thank you for your suggestions. One of the objectives of this thread is to "keep it simple" The EA is coded to take trades on any time-frame (chart) it is placed on and we wouldn't want to change that. Existing trades will be affected on a change of time-frame if the exit conditions are met on the new chart. One can simply dis-able auto trading when switching between time frames, which I currently do. Closing and opening MT4 terminal does not affect existing trades. Regards.

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Thank you for making it smooth and clear. I appreciate it much.

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Hello there, I have another suggestion/request. I found your "Auto SL" function very interesting and smart, setting SL for longs at the last relative low (high for shorts). Brokers, some more than others, do the very funny game of "stop hunting" at those same levels. IMHO it would be smart to add a few (possibly random withing a range) pips to the SL levels, in order not to get hunted, or at least not that easily. What do you think about ?

--- 帖子 #718 ---
Why i can't see the sell order arrow in the screen using the template. A sell order is there with only sl line, i can't see in which bar it is opoened?

--- 帖子 #719 ---
Yes they do!. So I simply move my stops to where I want them, after the trades have been open Cheers Lorbax.

--- 帖子 #720 ---
Look in your "Chart Properties" and either activate "Volumes" or change the colour so you can see the line. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #721 ---
Thanks krismitt, i can now see the line. Here another question, why this order was opened? Have you got the same order?

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Ok, which means you use it semi-auto, right ? ok. Another thing, in order to do a bit of backtesting and possible optimization, using at least a bit of Walk-Forward Analysis, I find very powerful using two implementations, which I understand not to be fast to insert nor extremely easy (at least for my low coding skills) 1. At the end of any optimization we end up with a set of "best" constant numbers such as Take Profits, BreakEven levels and Trailing Stops. Those are the result of a best value set, which we believe to be optimum. The hardest target here is to avoid overfitting of values, creating the "best" set for the past. One way out is using "variables" instead of "constants". Example: TakeProfit is 1.5 times the average daily range, Trailing Stop is 0.75 of the average daily range ... and so on. Our optimizations will be based on those multipliers, instead of the pure absolute numbers. I know this can be a bit of coding labor, but in most of cases you end up with much more robust optimum sets, which last longer on live trading. 2. MT4 offers the possibility to have a customized optimization, instead of using one of the poor basic ones (best balance, lowest dd, best profict factor, ...etc) which are all very fragile, tend to overfitting and/or only include one aspect of the results. Check this short article: http://sharpquant.com/general/custom...tion-criteria/ This implementation is actually very easy to code and can lead to incredibly interesting results. One of the most famous custom formula is to maximize "profit/drawdown" so you end up having the highest profit AND the lowest drawdown combined. There are several popular formulas for this. You can also add more than one and with an external variable choose the one you prefer "1,2,3,4 ...." . Here you can find one advanced evaluation formula called K-Ratio: http://www.styleadvisor.com/content/k-ratio Or, other examples here: https://www.multicharts.com/discussi...pic.php?t=8838 What do you think about these 2 things ? Let me know if you need a hand with some coding, I am more than available (despite of my little free time) to help you in case you need some. Let me know, open to collaborate. Thanks, have a nice day.

Hi, This week was not good for me. I have HP3.1 on 28 pairs on timeframe D1. The results were not positive. The main reason seems to me that quiet a few pairs have bounced of a resistance line on D1/W1 that is not broken yet. Hmm, maybe I should try H4 for my main timeframe.

My setup of 28 pairs trading D1 demo account was not very succesful this week . I decided to switch to H4 now with the basic set-file from post 1. Let's see what results that will give. My analysis is that when hitting a major resistance line, HP sometimes still tries to trade in the direction of the resistance. On the D1 timeframe this situation can last for days or weeks. When I would be trading manually I would wait with new entries until I saw confirmation of either a break of the resistance line or a reversal away from the resistance line. Now that analysis gave me an idea for a possible new trading rule: Fact: HP usually make a good decision on the direction of the next trade. Fact: When HP is wrong it often has to do with a resistance line. Possible new trading rule: When a trade fails (Stop Loss, as initially set, is hit) maybe HP should wait for a) a setup in the opposite direction, or b) wait until we are at least xx pips past the last entry point. Just an idea. What do you guys think? Would this make sense? Cheers.

--- 帖子 #754 ---
I run the ea on 28 pairs on 4hr since 2 weeks and checked results, I have noticed the following: I wake up with many trades in one currency(monday on jpy this morning gbp) all losers. I could be a good idea to stop taking more than 2 trades in one currency. Most trades on sunday / monday / tuesday fail as the currencies are still on their way to midweek reversalpoint. then one would want trade on monday / trade on tuesday etc flags. If you loose 5 time on jpy trades it is not a good idea to martingale on jpy on that day. The magicnumber would be easily programmed to unique per currencypair. we are now entering on baropen many losers will be prevented when entering on the high/low of the bar crossing the MA (plus spread) Now since the source is not available i need to come here to point this out in stead of changing it myself. Please krismitt change something or upload the source here.

What's up guys, this entry signal seems to be good if you use the right risk management tools. I ll post some results when I am finish putting together a strategy with this entry signal but managing the trades a certain way to bounce back better from the ranging markets. So far it's looking really good, low draw down and steady growth. I always recommend everyone trade on the daily chart for trend so this is a very good approach.

Hey Shum, great results, would you mind sharing your EA settings. Rub

--- 帖子 #760 ---
Hi Kris, I came across your thread last week and read through it and the others over the weekend. Why i was interested was because its similar to how i confirm most of my trades which is entry of cross of two EMAs on higher timeframes with of cuz closer look at price action. Having said that I began testing out the EA with the higher TF entry because im a swing trader, so I will post my week 1 result below and also ask a few questions., if you dont mind answering them. I will leave the EA to run for a month and will also be testing out different MA values that I have used effectively over the years. 1. This EA has great potential, because I trade similarly for some years now profitably. The major key to really benefitting from this EA will be each individuals money management plan. 2. I was thinking if you could add a general Equity Lock Option to the EA if trading 28 pairs, as this will set options for one if they want maybe a weekly target if trading H4 timeframe or lower. So when a certain pip value target or weekly target amount value has been hit all EA on pairs close/stop running automatically. From what I understand the break even lock is just for each pair the EA is on. 3. EA properties i have highlighted some questions in diagram posted below. 4. USDJPY had opened two trades, first on the 3rd (tuesday) and on the 6th (today friday), im guessing this is because of i left the re-entry enabled in the EA properties?? But i want to know what has to happen for a trade to renter?

Hi JoePro, You make me very curious about your method. It almost sounds to me like you want to use this program purely for order entries and then swap to another order management tool (possibly some kind of ME/ME) to maximise your chance to come out with profit. Am I right? Cheers.

is there any mt4 coder here ready to work for free plz pm me , for the ea coding of a system as shown in my explorer thanks

Hey guys/girls. Wanted to bring a bit of a value to the system. I've been researching in the last weeks for a strategy that can meet the following requirements: - trade on the 4-hour chart - work well in trend training and avoid as many falls signals as possible - have a good risk/reward money management - use as few indicators as possible in order to focus on price action I found this thread and combined the following indicators: - MTF MA Multi Pair Dashboard - xSuperTrend Candles (I feel that the heikein ashi are too slow for my taste) - a moving average of 200 to help determine trend - the 5 moving average which I use as stated in the thread Below are this week's trades. As you can see, there were 7 trades on gold that had a positive outcome with approx. 100 pips and 2 with a loss of 50. I always enter a trade when the previous candle is red (short) and has closed below the 5 MA. Can you help in improving the system?

--- 帖子 #764 ---
Here is one of my accounts containing trades with this strategy -&gt; https://www.myfxbook.com/portfolio/stefan/2255220 I'm still testing it. Your help would be appreciated. Added another example of the strategy from my previous for GBP/USD. Approx. 300 pips in the selected time period.

Hello Krismitt, together with the new year the EA says "Trail Period Expired" - on my Demo Account :-) It works best since "No Exit" :-)

any new versions ? i still use this but manually, would be nice if it could just take trades and let me manage them

--- 帖子 #768 ---
Hi Shay14: Seasons Greetings. Yes, I have done a lot of development, including a Basket Version. However, I was not impressed overall with the performance of the system so didn't bother to upload it. Perhaps is was loaded with to many "bells and whistles" for its own good . The Basket version would do you well; as it provides a nice Dashboard to manage all pairs/trades on a single chart. This is what the Dash looks like. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Made a request earlier in this thread for Traders to assist me in testing the system but the response was more disappointing than I could have imagined, hence my diminishing interest in supporting the thread...

All: I would like to review The Hodgepodge : If you have traded they system on a Demo Accoun t I would like to see a full Statement from your Account. Please PM me if you have this information. Note : If you have traded live and wish to discuss your experience , not necessarily your results, please feel free to PM me as well. Best to you for 2018. Regards.

nice going Mucky..can i ask what timeframe for your charts? thanks, blam

--- 帖子 #772 ---
Just one question Mucky: I see from your settings that you have gone the "no exit" route. However, the intent was that with this option, the Stop Loss would protect and manage the risk in the event that the trade went against you. You have disabled the Stop Loss. How do you get out of a bad trade that turns negative before break-even is achieved? Cheers.

--- 帖子 #773 ---
Hello blam, it's the H4 timeframe mucky :-)

--- 帖子 #774 ---
Hello Krismitt, I noticed most of the time the EA closed an acertain trade, the market turns back into the proposed direction. If the market does not turned back, it opens the martingale trades - and this becomes expensive. So first I tried to set manual SL's to avoid the EA closing the trades - but this doesn't work, the EA closed the trades before SL was hit. So the best option was to go the no exit route. I was missing the option to close the trades only if the trade is in profit, because of a trend change - as an example. Now I check the trades from time to time to see if any trades goes against the main trend ... I am using 21 currencies focused on D1 and W1 - there are always trades in red and in green pips, so the overall DD is acceptable. Using D1 and W1 means a trade can go quite against you - but this is only demo to learn and optimize the involved strategies But I have a smal live account also - but this in the next post :-) Mucky

Hello Krismitt, since 01.09.2017 I am testing the EA on a smal live account - started with abaut 120 USD but added a few more USD :-) This account is also using 21 currencies - no CHF's. The setup is slightly different from the demo account - but still the no exit route. I noticed that Break even and trailing is not working all the time - so I decided to use a second EA to do Break even / trailing - Steve Hopwood's "Multipurposetrademanager" Now I will start investigateing the code an the involved strategies - maybe I can contribute to this. Mucky

--- 帖子 #776 ---
Thanks for this Mucky. Yes, have a look at the Code and see what you find. Regards.

--- 帖子 #777 ---
Happy new Year krismitt, don't give up as I think you had the basis of a really good EA, I would be happy to help in any testing, including the basket testing, I check in here to see if anything has developed but please pm me if needed.

--- 帖子 #778 ---
Happy new year Mucky and thanks for the info

--- 帖子 #779 ---
Hi Mucky, Thanks for the info. Where abouts did you get the Multipurposetrademanager from and what are the settings you use with that EA? Cheers

--- 帖子 #780 ---
Also i noticed that it only uses trailing stop and break even when its a long order, it wont manage the trade when it goes short.

--- 帖子 #781 ---
Hello tobzz, the manager is from FF member Steve Hopwood - https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=89371 - there is a link to his own homepage. Topic is " MPTM updated" There is also a free User Guide for download. If you need further assistance, you welcome Mucky PS.: But now with the code available, I think we should solve this issues within Krismitt's EA :-)

--- 帖子 #782 ---
subscribed. I am the fan of EA. thanks kris for introducing it, will put into demo for 3 months and see the result. Please continue to keep the thread live.

--- 帖子 #783 ---
Hi Mucky I think its spot on what you have said, I had a demo on the EA for 3 months, it can be 50-60 pips in profit but then closes in negative, so I think the Ea just needs work on the break even trailing side of things, I was going to ask for a set file for the steve hopwood ea if you have one, but don't worry if you haven't, as you have said hopefully, this can be re-coded in the Hodgepodge Ea and then there is no need for this. I think if we could lock in profit or manage the break even better then this EA is a winner ! Krismitt keep up the good work and Thanks for all you have done so far

--- 帖子 #784 ---
Trades for this week - USD/JPY was in profit at one point, but still a great outcome for a 4 day week.

--- 帖子 #785 ---
Good stuff Montego Would definitely be good so see some improvements to the EA Mucky....based on the observations to date. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #786 ---
thanks for sharing. the drawdown is about 35%, is this within your tolerance level? i see the potential of this EA, still trying to see which setting perhaps can generate about 15% return per year and maximum drawdown of maximum 15%.

--- 帖子 #787 ---
hey Mucky would you mind sharing your mptm settings? would be appreciated thanks, blam

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Update: my MPTM Settings on a smal live account for testing - trading timeframe is H4 - 21 Currencies After download please remove .txt from filename :-) ... and update from Live account, as you can see there one position from 21.11.2017 GPBUSD 0.05 lots :-( Mucky

--- 帖子 #789 ---
Brilliant Mucky ! could you please confirm, what pairs your useing as there is only 14 displayed in the screenshot cheers. Stop loss looks too tight maybe ?

--- 帖子 #790 ---
... update nothing changed

--- 帖子 #791 ---
Hi Mucky, Can show which 21 currencies you live trading? interested to see the progress moving forward.. I am trying to find some setting, so hope to live test and put this as one of the EA portfolios.

--- 帖子 #792 ---
Hello happytrade38, you welcome, please see last screenshot from my post obove - these are the currencies I am trading live. My post is about my smal live trading account only :-) kind regards mucky

Hello, how trades on renko in this Post

--- 帖子 #794 ---
thanks. I saw the some settings different such as breakeven, brean even lock, start trailing, maintain trail distance is quite unique as well as the TP setting. You did back test for those 21 pairs?

--- 帖子 #795 ---
Hello happytrade38, no I didn't any back tests for this particular trading strategy. But over the years and more than 100 differnt EA's developing and running - I am using these settings in H4 timeframe. I do not expect that TP will be hit using this strategy, it is more likely that S/L will be hit by a retrace - but if not, let the trade run :-) .. the used values are fibonacci numbers :-) mucky

hi all, I read through the code and found the trailing/BE problem may be created by using "bid" for sell order. attached the revised code.

Hi Krismitt, Can you share the dash EA?? Is better to open one chart rather than opening 28 charts..

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Had some issues with the coding and the Dash has been useless. Need to get the Code reviewed. Regards.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Hi Friend, I am using your revised version 3.1.1_V2 and noticed that trailing once activated does not move with price movement, does the coding need some change or my settings are not correct. plz help.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
I see there is an indicator ea for london daybreak
