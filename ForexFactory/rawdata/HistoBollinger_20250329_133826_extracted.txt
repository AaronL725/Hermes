Note: have started new discussion to identify the strategy to earn 3 to 5 pips. I will keep posting screenshots and will help in answering the questions of new traders. You can find the post on page 17. Welcome to our HistoBollinger thread. We will use very common indicator with some modifications. HistoBollinger is very easy to use. HistoBollinger minimize the risk so that you will have more positive results. I do not want to add any other indicators but if you want to use it for your satisfaction then you are welcome but do not ask me to add indicators in this thread. Note: First try on Demo account. Time Frame :H1 Note: Please change the Period of FS30_Histogram from 10 to 9. Updated Dec 14, 2012 Short Entry: When value of Fisher and FS30_Histogram (Period = 9) turns less than zero and SSL bar is red after closing the candle . Exit Strategy: Close the trade when FS30_Histogram value turns into positive value. Long Entry: When value of Fisher and FS30_Histogram (Period = 9) turns greater than zero and SSL bar is green after closing the candle . Exit Strategy: Close the trade when FS30_Histogram value turns into negative value. Note: Use H1 time frame and make sure that SSL indicator has H4 in the title of indicator. Thanks to RoyPK and EasyRyder for providing template and indicators. I liked the template and Fisher indicator of RoyPK and indicator of EasyRyder but still i have added histogram. All three indicators should match before entry. Histogram indicator and Template file is attached. When to use :Use this this system during EU and US session When Not to use :Be careful before any important (Red Report in Forexfactory.com) report is released. Many traders visited this thread and some of them worried about repainting of indicator. I want to say that if you involve some risk then you have higher win but there are many new traders and they have focus to have positive result in the beginning. So for new traders i brought update (SSL Bar H4). Ignore Post#2

Histogram indicator and Template file is attached. When to use :Use this this system during EU and US session When Not to use :Be careful before any important (Red Report in Forexfactory.com) report is released. Note: When histogram value turns into positive/negative value, wait until candle close. Sometimes Bar already touch the opposite band before histogram value turns into negative/positive value then in that case do not place order. Many traders visited this thread and some of them worried about repainting of indicator. I want to say that if you involve some risk then you have higher win but there are many new traders and they have focus to have positive result in the beginning. So for new traders i am bringing update. Update: One histogram is attached but you have to use two histograms. Change the settings of second histogram. 1) First histogram, Period = 10 2) Second Histogram, Period = 25 When both histograms value turn into negative/positive value then place order. You can set take profit as next support/resistance line or you can exit the system if first histogram value turns into negative/positive value.

It should be an indicator to add alerts.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
. You are right but i am not programmer so you have to do it manually.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
hi aahmad29, your strategy seems have high win rate,i will test more later. How long have you used this indicator and which pairs do you trade? Thanks chye

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Well done! This system is very simple! I love it!

--- 帖子 #7 ---
I am using this indicator for more than two years on EUR/USD pair because mostly spread is less than 2.5. If you want to play more safe then you can set take profit as Upper/Lower band.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
But how do u deal with the repainting-part of the indicator?

--- 帖子 #9 ---
I think the indicator repaint.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
First of all, there is no arrow or any other symbol which repaint. I never said that this system is 100% accurate and give you 100% positive result. There is no such trading system which can give you 100% positive results. It is very simple that when price touch the upper/lower band then you have to wait until value of histogram turn into positive/negative value. You can set take profit as upper/lower band according to your long/short entry. I am using this sytem on H1 time frame and when value of histogram turns into poistive/negative value then wait for candle close. Important : Test this indicator on Demo account and if you are satisfied then use it.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
So you mean the histogram doesn't repaint? I thought it was a variation of the solar wind indicator which repaints badly.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
FIRST of all thanks to you that you visited this thread. You are experienced trader.Yes sometimes this indicator repaints but if you follow the all instructions then success rate will be higher. I know that some traders are new to this industry and i have to give them indicator with higher win rate. I am working on making some changes and i will provide these updates very soon.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Thanks for your effort anyway,bro,and i'll look forward to your updates.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Repainting indicators can be useful for extra confirmation but are dangerous as stand alone indicators especially for less experienced traders. Looking forward to the updates.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
thanks for sharing, it does repaint at least 2 or 3 candle before. But bollinger use as filter.. somehow if wait for 3rd or 4th candle to close it seem not repaint.. from backtest it has good performance...thanks again..

--- 帖子 #16 ---
If you have any suggestions so that indicator do not repaint, you are welcome

--- 帖子 #17 ---
hi, Enter at close of red line (where histogram turn red). it is ok to enter if PA already touch the lower bollinger? thanks.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
If you have any suggestions so that indicator do not repaint, you are welcome

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Maybe you can find answer to you question from here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...28#post6182828 Regards Kristjan

--- 帖子 #20 ---
I have posted updates and if you follow the instructions then it won't repaint and you will have highest win rate.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
You changed the rules but not the code right? Kristjan

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Hi all. You indicator is interesting. Thanks for show it. Indicator repaints cause it based on BB and BB is a live indicator. But you can probe how i describe at chart attached. For Sell. Draw a horizontal line at 50% last histogram below 0 line. When first bar touch this line enter a sell order. No need wait bar close if you wont. Exit when price touch horizontal line drawed at 50% level of last histrogram bar secuencial above 0. I dont know if you understand it. Apologize my english. You can probe at simulator and coment it. Regards.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
I did not change the code. I changed the rule because i wanted to give high win rate. Now new trader can also use this system and make money . Experienced trader knows lot about other things so if histogram repaints then they can easily figure out that this is fake signal. I have changed the rule that both histograms should have positive/negative value. Recommended take profit 10 Pips for new traders other wise use the exit strategy as i mentioned in my first post.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Thanks for such a good idea. I liked it.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
keep going... 2nd trade with this system..

--- 帖子 #26 ---
I didn't see the histogram value changing once the candle corresponding to it, is closed. Am I missing something? TS

--- 帖子 #27 ---
what is the calculation of this histogram indicator.... I didn't see it based on the width of BB bands?

--- 帖子 #28 ---
setup..u can check on the page 1..

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Sometimes value does not change but if it is happening requently then remove the indicator from the chart and insert the indicator in chart again. Probably it could be template issue. Hopefully it will resolve your issue.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Where can I find # FS30 Histogram.mq4? Can you give a link?

--- 帖子 #31 ---
I mean what is the logic of the histogram indi, is it based on macd or BB bands? But I didn't think it is related to the the BB bands width.....

--- 帖子 #32 ---
I do not have MQ4 file of histogram because i did not create that file. I have tested more than 100 trading systems and i downloaded from any of one system. I really do not remember what is source of that indicator but i just found that there is another indicator which is same as my histogram indicator and name of that indicator is "fisher1". You can go to the trading system Fisher/Float and download the MQ4 file if it is available. I am not just here to promote my thread but my purpose is to provide such system which is profitable for new traders.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Thank you for your time.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Enjoy it.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Thank you very much. Now if any one needs that indicator with Audible Alert; they can download from here. Again thanks to help in providing Profitable system.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Friday Nov 16,2012. H1 Chart posted. Trade was following the Rule which is given in updates on page1.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Can you provide me feedback after testing the strategy given in Updates ( For beginners) on Page1. It will be really great help. Thanks

Some members are sending Private messages and asking questions. There is my request that if you have any question or comments please post on this thread so that when i answer the question, it can help others.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Dear Sir, I am herewith would like to apologize for sending you a private message, the reason is only i am stupid person i just do not know how and where to message someone in this FF, i am really new to FF. I am sorry it was bothering you with it and I should thank you so much much for your wise advices. you are right! i have to go back to the Demo again. I do hope that i can get better sight of Forex &amp; Trading system from yours as attached. with very best regards Akhmad Paozi

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Hi aahmad, Thanks for sharing the stragey. At least 10 pips assured daily if, traders who use this strategy are patient and not greedy. Trading on low spread pairs is advisable. I attach my trading template in case it helps the thread followers. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
I don't mean to pour cold water... In this image, the circled bar became the signal bar after the tick marked bar was formed. Almost three to four bars get repainted. Any trading ideas, taking this possibility into account? TS

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Nothing was bothering me. There are some traders who are shy and do not ask questions so if any beginner ask question then others can get benefit from the answer. Did you follow this strategy today when market opened? If you followed, you should have +15 Pips in your account.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I know that in this strategy you get late entry but my purpose is to provide positive results for beginners. I believe that once new trader start getting positive results then he/she wll be confident to learn other knowledge. Some traders contacted me and said that they are about to say goodbye to this industry so i decided to share my strategy. I got inspiration from other experienced traders who provided very good trading systems (free of cost). Thanks

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Hi TradeStar, I don't have time to get in to an argument and counter argument with an experienced trader like you. But the following picture explains my first trade today.. 15.2 pips and still counting. I like this simple system. Regards, Roy

--- 帖子 #46 ---
I am really thankful to you ; it is very helpful template and additional indicator.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Among many indicators driven ideas, this one has a good potential, in spite of the fact that histogram repaints. Hence my interest in the thread. Aahmad29 has done really a nice job, especially adding histogram 25 as additional filter. Roy, your template is also quite nice. Just wanted the new traders to trade this with caution. One additional filter you may consider is to wait for another bar to close above/below the signal bar. I will post few trades as I take them. All the best to Aahmad29 Thanks TS

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Hi, would not be better to use Renko charts? With GbpUsd from the month of November we get over 300 pips ... I use 13 Renko bricks, Entrance with both fisher agree, if output fisher (10) changes color. what do you think? Sorry for my english... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Yes i already said in my first post that if you want to use any additional indicator then it is good because you are more comfortable with it and more encouragement when verified by histogram. I will be happy if you make good pips.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
I will recommend to use "FXI Pivot" and when you have signal then you should set take profit (Next resistance or Support). Like today, i set my take profit at 1.2786 and system already exit with take profit. It will take time for new traders to learn these things.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Todays positive results with 1H chart. I will try to post the chart every day for the results of my strategy.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
so mr.aahmad, what's boilinger band period 20 use for? if we just need histogram period 10 and 25 i think this pretty cool and save indicator, i will try first at demo.. thanks aahmad

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Hi Aahmad I noticed your system during the weekend and it seems ok. What i have been doing is using the 4 hr charts with the indicators and looking to lower time frame to help get into the trade earlier because as others have said it does repaint for maybe 4 bars so if you backtest it looks great but in reality the set ups you look at in backtest you wont get in real time so i try to filter it using lower time frames but actually trading the 4 hr chart. I will see how this goes over the week and report anything i find Graham

--- 帖子 #54 ---
You can use only two histograms.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
You are talking about filter so second histogram acts like filter. When both histogram matches then first histogram does not repaint.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi Aahmad Yes the you are right it doesnt but when you wait for the 2nd histogram to change it can repaint by 4 bars so example on a short trade 1st histogram is red then we are waiting for the 2nd to turn red. But on watching this today the 2nd will turn red but also repaint the previous 1,2,3,4 bars red so on back test it looks good because it looks like u got into the trade 1,2,3,4 bars to when you actually got into the trade this is why i am looking to lower time frames to try and catch the movement just as its happening of the 4 hr chart. I hope this helps. I will keep you posted during the week. Keep up the good work

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Thank you Ahmad for very good system or a part of system. It is helpfull,

--- 帖子 #58 ---
If it changes colour then exit the trade. If it is possible then post your charts so that others can get benefit.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
first blood using aahmad indicator, and closed mannualy for several pips

--- 帖子 #60 ---
My first one too but on 4h UsdCad. I have no time for scalp. http://imageshack.us/a/img202/4494/201211191505l.png

Hi fccailou Im in on this also on the 4hr

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Fcaliou This pair USD/CAD is stalling at the 0.99570 mark will wait and see what happens looks like its bounced of support line

--- 帖子 #63 ---
M15 Chart is ok but i will recommend you 1H chart

--- 帖子 #64 ---
My TP are on the Weekly support 2: 0.9945 Wait and see.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
hello U did not use the bollinger Bands?

--- 帖子 #66 ---
which indicator did u use

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Hummm, I use only fisher indicators and "aahmad29" template from the first page. I don't like white background

--- 帖子 #68 ---
I have removed bollinger for those who are not experienced traders. Many new traders asked me to bring strategy where is high win rate. So i gave them indicator and it is on page 1. Repainting of indicator was issue for new traders so i brought filter (another indicator).

--- 帖子 #69 ---
thanks for your suggestion. mr ahmad, personally would you take action if the volume in both histogram is just a small size? or you will waiting for a bigger volume?

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Aahmad29 strategy can be a high win rate one if you add just one non repainting filter. Mine is just trend line and weekly pivot for H4.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
I do not wait for the bigger volume. I just believe on chart and i think when both histogram matches then volume is enough for the trade.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
oke ahmad, but as I try in demo account using ur indi, we can't know how long the trend will over? this will make user of "ahmad indicator" feel worry if we have been doing action, but soon trend is over so how do you think we can overcome this problem?

--- 帖子 #73 ---
aahmed29 Thanks for your very simple system. I have earned some pips using your system. Could you please let us know on an average how many pips your system earns?

--- 帖子 #74 ---
This is the main reason that i use 1H chart. When histogram (Period=10) changes colour then that is Exit point. My first preference is to promote the positive results and later when i will have enough time then i will bring something else for exit strategy But for now use Historam of Period =10 My way of trade is that if histogram changes colour i closed my position if colour match again then i take another position. I use this method as precaution so that traders do not have loss

--- 帖子 #75 ---
It always depend on the market and your experience but if you totally depend on the indicator then daily 15+ Pips are sure.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Exuse me Ahmad, i'm testing this indicator ( parametr 25) now, everything is ok. But you as a discoverer of the system tell please for how long are you playing with it? how reliable is this system do you think?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Hi Aahmad Thanks for sharing your system. I like its simplicity. I read this from another thread a few days ago: "Symphonie Sentiment Indikator / Fisher Transform HistogramSource: a decompile of Fisher_Yur4ik_2Problem: Negative indices, possible memory corruption, incorrect values, reverse calculation and painting. Yes, this indicator always calculate the last 3 bars in reverse (from current into the past) and paints them the same way, which causes absolutely unjustified repainting. It also produces incorrect values because of the EMA used in Fisher Transform calculation, which is supposed to continue from the last value. Instead it always starts with 0.Principle of Operation: (it did not do that originally due to errors, but supposed to) Fisher Transform crossing 0 line. When Fisher positive - it signals "up" (blue), when negative - it's "down" (red).Features: Does not repaint anymore. Fixed, cleaned and added selectable "collapse" mode - to display blue/red bars on the same line instead of spread up and down. Useful if you like to have the "spike" indicator in the separate sub-window.Parameters:Length - Fisher Transform period.Collapse - explained above.Comment: It may appear that the fixed indicator gives signals later. It's an illusion. Since the original implementation calculated 3 bars all the time and painted them backwards, you will never find the signal at the current bar exactly. When it appears, it appears 2 bars behind (3 minus the 1 current) and in retrospect it looks like it works 2-bar faster than the correct one.The smoothing used is per original design by Ehler - EMA(3) and EMA(5). I did not expose those values as parameters, but if you want to experiment - it's trivial to do - just uncomment to "extern" qualifiers." So basically a non repainting Fisher indicator, usefull for a visual backtesting. Since I'm not at the PC now I will try later. Cheers

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hi aahmad, I did test the system yesterday,it is a simple system with clear entry &amp; exit signal &amp; right time to enter the trade, with some basic knowledge about reversal candlestick will give the good pips.Good job.Credit to u

--- 帖子 #79 ---
okey ahmad, so period 10 is more important than 25 ? we'll wait for your update bro, and keep sharing thank's a lot credit for you

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Nothing is going to change much because i use two histograms. Both histograms have same colour then this is entry and if first histogram change the colour thne it is exit signal.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Thanks. I appreciate your effort, i will try to test it.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Both are equally important because entry signal if both histogram have same colour and exit signal is that when first histogram change the colour.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
The simplicity of this system is: We spot the signal (only signal....nor exit or entry) whenever the candle touches the lower or upper band....and then we wait for the exit or entry,no matter what time frame we are using....with this system we also can trade the retracement

--- 帖子 #84 ---
UJ for short entry?

--- 帖子 #85 ---
JPY FF is Yellow, I hope UJ sure can go short http://www.meti.go.jp/english/statistics/index.html

--- 帖子 #86 ---
UJ is the currency which i always avoid.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
omg.. so can I know your prediction about uj ? cause I already short entry in UJ

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Hi Beckham, if we look at the UJ...refer to the Daily &amp; 4H timeframe....the Sell signal was there.....just wait to go down...hopefully

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Hiy Lion King, i already closed for -12 pips cause it's so ranging ej

--- 帖子 #90 ---
it's true, the bands become more smaller....wait for the breakout

--- 帖子 #91 ---
It is much better if you trade during EU and US session. During other times i can only check emails and i am not here to predict. I just follow the chart. Sorry for not to reply. UJ is most unpredictable currency. I will also recommend you to use support and resistance lines as your TP. For me, if there is one big size candle trigger the entry then i just use other knowledge to make sure that entry is safe but for other who are just following chart then stay away so that you do not loose money.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
yes ahmad, its my fault trade in asian time Mr.ahmad if you do not mind,,can u show us your signal if you want trading some pairs, so we can more understand how to practice it

--- 帖子 #93 ---
I am really sorry ; i can't provide you signal but i am busy in refining my trading system by adding any additional indicator with histogram. I liked the idea of "RoyPK" on page 3 and i am testing this system. Roypk added SSL H4 indicator. Let me complete testing then i will come up with good idea. My trading system is not 100% perfect but i can try to improve which i am doing with the help of traders like Roypk, Jako2, Tradestar, luipie and others. I am thankful to them and i know that people have many more expectations from me so i am trying my best to meet those expectations within my capacity.

snakeforce.ex4 file is missing in the attached file. MT4 is responding that snakeforce.ex4 is missing.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Hi, not sure if this will serve. Lordorly

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Hi aahmad, I attach here the 'Tro-Multimeter Snake' indicator I use. Regards and goodluck with your trading. Roy

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Mr.Roy can u explain how to use them?

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Run-time management of signal, just another approach When Bar numbered 3 closed, it made previous three histograms red thus making bar number 1 as the signal bar. Let us call the bar 3 as the 'Revealing bar'. Now bar 4 has to be bearish in order for the signal to remain constant going forward. Let us call the bar 4 'Confirmation bar. Now confirmation bar closed below the 'Revealing bar', which is good. Now we should be ready to go short 2 ticks below the low of the confirmation bar. We may be far off from the signal bar by say 20 odd pips, still, more often than not, this can lead to another 40+ pips. Additionally, we can move the pending short below two bar low, starting from the confirmation bar to get a better price. Again, this just another thought process for discussion; doesn't mean to clutter or confuse the original model. Thanks TS

Pls what is the Latest and reliable Template for HistoBollinger as at November 21st 2012 thanks

--- 帖子 #100 ---
You can always find latest template on page 1. There are different traders who are helping me to add an extra filter with histogram and there is no boundary for the template.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Ok Aahmad29 so how far with ur testing have we u and ur backtesting team unanimously gotten a generally accepted reliable extra filter or u are still working on it?

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Hi aahmad29: I attached following histogram indicator. It can help to determine trend in combination with HistoBollinger. Ignore divergences. I dont know how it works but it can help in your system. You must be test it. All the best. Regards.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Hello Ashmad. In an effort to help you move forward, I have attached a no-repaint version Fisher_Yur4ik. It took me a day and a half to figure out that Fisher_Yur4ik was such a extreme re-painter. A day and a half waisted, in my opinion. If the period is 10, it can repaint up to nine bars. Try this version with a short period along with RoyPK's SSL_fast_sBar. It looks interesting.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Hello all. One trade yesterday. NzdUsd 4h, i'm still in. fcaillou http://img837.imageshack.us/img837/8...1211211139.png

Thanks to the thread starter. Nice system. I won`t recommend additional indicator(s). But short of an EA the next best thing would be a nice dashboard with email possibilities. Anybody can transform one of the trusted and proven oldies? Thanks

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Actually i am busy in other stuff so i couldn't get time to test but i will do my best as per my capacity. Just give me some time. Thanks

--- 帖子 #107 ---
I dropped Renko bars because I am not satisfied with this system, I prefer H1 with the addition of an indicator fantastic "SSL (34)" taken from the system Mihailo. Entry with all three indicators agree, exit when fisher(10) changes color, re entry if fisher(10) returns color. I am attaching the indicator, try it. hello Attached File(s) SSL 3.ex4 4 KB | 1,438 downloads

--- 帖子 #108 ---
I appreciate your efforts.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Thanks for your efforts.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Hi Luipie Can you tell me does the SSL indicator repaint ?

--- 帖子 #111 ---
OK Here we go again. After close of bar number 3, bar number 1 became the signal. So bar number 3 is 'Reveal bar' Bar number 4 is the 'Confirmation bar' since it closed in the same direction and froze the signal I am long couple of tick above the confirmation bar. SL 20 pips We will see how this plays out for few more signals. Thanks TS

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Hello TradeStar. I went through the code for Fisher_Yur4ik. In the instance you discuss here, realize that the indi can repaint again for each new bar up until the period of the indi is reached. So if you have the period set to 10, the indi can repaint for 9 new bars. The indi does its calculation from the right most bar to the oldest bar. I changed this in the no-paint revision I posted. The negative is that the signals come several bars later, but they do not re-paint. In combination with SSL, the combined no-repaint signals do not look too bad. Good luck. These re-painting indis should be banned from FF, in my opinion.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
I see. Thanks, EasyRyder. I was assuming max 3 bars gets altered based on my observation. Let us work with the non-repaint version. Thanks TS

--- 帖子 #114 ---
I do not think it

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Hi luipie Can u pl tell me about 13 renko bricks. Thanks fxmyluv

--- 帖子 #116 ---
fxmyluv, you cannot do a visual backtest with the fisher indis because they repaint. The signal bars you are looking at have been repainted after two, or three or four bars later. Same way in real time trading -- you do not see the signal until several bars late, because of the repaint feature.. Not always, but frequently. The fisher indi is useless as an effective trding tool. My opinion.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
There are other thread that talk about Renko systems, we are talking about the system histobollinger, does not seem right to enter other threads ... In any case use RenkoLiveChart_v3.2.mq4 setting boxsize 13 and renkotimeframe 2, then open the chart offline m2 and apply the indicators that we are using here. hi fxmyluv

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Hi Trade star I agree with u, to have more surety, this additional filter will definitely add to surety. But sometimes u may lose some pips. fxmyluv

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Hi luipie I agree &amp; I am not trying to go away from the subject of this thread. If u feel so I say sorry. I have heard this Renko bars so many times but am curious what they are &amp; how can I experience them. Just that &amp; nothing else bro. Thanks fxmyluv

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Hi aahmad exit when anyone changes colour or when first one changes colour Thanks fxmyluv

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Thanks, I put in 30 min, BB100, (bb100 in 30min = bb20 in 2h30), when the 2 BB touch (bb20 et bb100) can be sign of reverse.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
I am really sorry to take long time in bringing more refine system. First of all i want to say thanks to RoyPK and EasyRyder and other traders to participate in healthy discussion with different ideas. I have tested the system and then i decided to combine RoyPK's template and indicator with EasyRyder's indicator because i am fan of H4 trend. Strategy and Chart has been posted on page1 (Post#1). If you have any question feel free to ask me. I will try to reply ASAP according to my capacity. Again thanks to all traders for participation.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Interesting...can you just share your template and we can copy the BB parameters from there..it would be easier in the translation...thanks!

--- 帖子 #124 ---
I have posted the template on Page1 (Post 1)

--- 帖子 #125 ---
It's "Aahmad29" template, i just put BB100 and a regular macd. Medium BB100, can be first TP. 95% of the candle are in the BB.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
the indicator repaints

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Yes thats why i have added three indicators so that repainting do not become issue.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Unfortunately, not much to test it on during this holiday....I am wondering what you are using for SL and TP on this 1 Hour Setup? Thanks

Hi guys, I am using the system now on my live account during USA THANKSGIVING DAY. I will tell you the results later. Look forward to the good result lol

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Hi guys, I am waiting for the EUR/USD to meet with the pre-required rules in the system. Actually it's been very slow market today. However, I have tried it on AUD/USD and just earned + 30 pips. It should be all right with the market like today's. cheers &amp; all the best.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
You can use support/resistance as take profit. You have to close the position manually by looking at FS30_Histogram.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
You can use this method for any currency pair. After one week, choose your option in given Poll on page 1.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
The signal indicator "Fisher_Yur4ik_2.1_no repaint" is always late, I'm trying the fisher standard with this system: when we have the signal on H1 (or all three indicators agree), I move on M30 and take (always with the same rules) all movements in agreement with the signal of H1 ... seems to work well ... try

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Hi Maybe you should try old one, that works all right for me at least . Just a suggestion, hope it will help you about the issue you have now.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Dear luipie The best is #FS30 Histogram(one at 10,second 25) BTW , the SSL is a big "repainter"(set to 4H on a 15M chart can repaint up to 16 bars) Regards Dan

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Hi , Which one you mean by standard one? Can you give me the mq4 file name? Again, which 3 should agree before you go to 30 minutes? Thanks TS

--- 帖子 #137 ---
aahmad29 - Last week I added your HISTO indo to my suite of indos&gt; I use it to verify trend and other indos for timing. So far I am pleased and thank you

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Yes, you can use FS30_Histogram for both periods because i am using this indicator for long time.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Friday is another successful day by using Histobollinger system. Day start with 1.2883 (already was carrying Buy signal) and now currently market is at 1.2973. All of you should close your positions because i never leave the position open because you never know what will happen during weekend. So our Profit for friday is 90 Pips. Have a good weekend.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
I'm constantly playing with new toys (aka indicators) Just thought I'd post this comparison for study purpose only (too much crap on my chart) (congrats aahmad29) Have a great weekend

I have been Trading for almost two years now and have been reading up on hundreds of system and techniques on FF, but must admit that this is my very first post on this forum... I want to also start contributing as so many of you already have, therefore then also my take and experiences below: I have combined a few strategies and please give comments and suggestions where I do good or fail. I have combined systems Histobollinger and Genesis Matrix System which can be found here and here . Reason for this was because it is simple and it WORKS for me... Gives results... Indicators I use: - SSL bar - Gann High/Low Activator Indicator from member Xaphod - Histograms with period 10 and 25 from member aahmad29 - GMTS-Tape which is a tape chart of the ‘ Genesis Matrix Trading System ’ Matrix indicator - 50 EMA line (use this to identify the trend to filter out bad trades) System Rules: Long trades: 1) When candle closes above the 50 EM A line 2) When ALL indicators have a Green colour Exit whenever ANY two or more indicators change colour Short trades: 1) When candle closes below the 50 EM A line 2) When ALL indicators have a Red colour Exit whenever ANY two or more indicators change colour Example trades:

--- 帖子 #142 ---
hi, anybody here have #FS30 Histogram.mq4, please attach here.tq very much.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Is this what you are looking for?

--- 帖子 #144 ---
hi aahmad29, may i know why u change it using fisher indicator in this system..tq

--- 帖子 #145 ---
I have posted the file but i donot have MQ4 file. I am very happy that traders are contributing in this thread. I know many traders are saying that histogram is repainting indicator but that indicator has given me most positive results so traders you have to use this indicator. For me Histogram With period=25 is very important. Now i am waiting that if histogram with period = 25 change the colour then i place sell order(Short Position). But on the other side if it does not change then i have buy stop order at Friday high Point + spread

--- 帖子 #146 ---
I have tested fisher indicator for two days and probably i missed something but it seems that FS30_histogram and fisher indicator had same behaviour. Fisher indicator also has period 25.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Hi aahmad29, Congratulations on your success with the system. Fisher and FS30 are the same indicators. You can use Fisher 25 for your entries and Fisher 10 for planning your exits. Good luck with your trading. Roy

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Yes you are right, i added one H4 indicator so that beginner do not loose money. I am thinking to add part 2 (For traders who have some experience) in same way as you mentioned.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Now it's red + red + red: short now?

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Sorry many times i donot reply quickly because i trade during London open and half time of NY session. It looks like sell entry but to be safe look at the very low point after opening the market. that point will be Sell Stop

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Remember one thing: If Histogram = 25 gives you one signal which is false and then change the colour. It means now signal is true. Remember R1 , R2, and R3 are close enough.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Buy stop is activated. My buy stop was at 1.2993 and i closed at 1.3004 but according to my trading system Buy signal was at 1.2969 and at this point market is at 1.2993. You should set your stop loss at break even. Wish you all Good week

--- 帖子 #153 ---
New traders, who are watching the FX market; they can easily find that we have 4 big candles in H1 time frame. Many indicators would be fail to detect specially for higher timeframe but it does not mean that you have to use small time frame. First learn with Big time frame like H1. Histobollinger system was clear today because we did not have sell signal so all spikes for Short entries does not effect.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
could you please share ur tpl with indicators too. rgds.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Hi CoiSmanFX can you give us too your indicator in that chart? especially in template thanks

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Hopefully new traders got the short entry today from 1.2976 to 1.2925.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Good stuff, Aahmad. Keep it up. Cheers TS

--- 帖子 #158 ---
ahmad, how to use snake indi ? can you tell us

--- 帖子 #159 ---
All I can say from experience is that any system with repainting indicator(s) with give 80% past performers and if it will give same result in the present signals have to be filtered with PA. So how do you filter the signals?

--- 帖子 #160 ---
No; i am not really making use of this indicator. Use only three indicators as i mentioned in my first post. Good days or Bad Days? Most important thing is that after one week what you have. You should have Good days by Histobollinger.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
First of all i want to appologise for late reply because i am not feeling well nowadays. I have seasonal Cough,flu and fever. I think you did not read complete thread. You can see that there are three indicators. I give them numbering like that: 1) FS30_Histogram (period=10) 2) Fisher indicator or you can use Histogram (Period should be = 25) 3) H4 SSL Bar. Now all three indicators must match before entry. Second and third indicators are filters.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Ok good. I want to believe you are now getting better? Do trade small T F like 15m?

--- 帖子 #163 ---
No this system is not that good for small time frame. In near future, i am planning to add some indicators for small time frame. It depends on the popularity of this thread. I wanted to present idea which i am currently using successfully. I also use H1 time frame so my experience is much more in H1.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
aahmad29 this is very good system - thanks for sharing with us

--- 帖子 #165 ---
I wanted to discuss the last 24 Hours FX market movements and how new traders can deal with it if they are using Histobollinger. Remember whenever you enter any position after receiving signal, R1/S1 or R2/S2 are very important targets. You should always keep in mind about the timing of "High Impact Reports". Traders try to get advantage if data released in favour of your position direction. They set stop loss with 5 to 10 Pips Stop Loss from the current market Price. It depends on you, if you want to close your order then you can do it.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
aahmad29, I saw you trade with EURUSD only. Can this trade with other pairs as well? What are the pair you recommended?

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Attached Indicators and Templates I use:

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Hello CoismanFX from ur templates i saw 2of them so which one of them do u use cos they are quite different

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Hi, can you post the indicator you use for the pivot. Thx.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
I recommend EURUSD but Histobollinger works with all pairs.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Indicator for the Pivot is attached.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
How do u use the Pivots in ur trading i mean the rule of trading with Pivots

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Hi cku Yes they are different but in a sense somewhat the same. The GMTS-Tape is a combination of the GMTS-Matrix. So instead of using the matrix (which takes up space), I used the tape. Use the links I provided and read up on the Genesis Matrix System and the Histobollinger...

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Rule is very simple. For long entry, R1 is my first take profit and R2 is second take profit. Sometimes signal activated near R1 then my take profit is R2. For short entry, i use the same rule as for Long entry except my take profit targets are S1 and S2. There is another scenario which i have used many times. For example, You have long position and your order is still running in positive Pips but market is very slow and you want to sleep then i put stop loss (whatever you can afford but not on break even; save something for you). Sometimes you get lucky and sometimes you won't.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
tnx for ur time Aahmad and COiSmanFX have a nice weekend

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Congratulations! The "Histobollinger" is the goose that lays the golden eggs! I'm using the index of Brazil (Bovespa) in Broker "GCI." Sensational, large daily earnings! I recommend! Thank you!

--- 帖子 #177 ---
There is an "EA" of Histobollinger?

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Caldeira -- can you post a chart showing one of you Golden Egg trades. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
No there is no EA, If anyone wants to develop EA then conditions and requirements will be little different.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Hi, aahmad and others for "EA" that conditions and rules? Lordorly

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Rules : Time Frame = H1 Long Entry : When Histogram Period = 25 of Time Frame H4 is greater than zero. And When "Histogram Period =10 and Histogram Period=25", In H1 Time Frame both values are greater than zero after closing candle. Close Long Position : When "Histogram Period = 10" value is less than zero in H1 Time Frame. For Exit there is no need to wait for candle to be close. Short Entry : When Histogram Period = 25 of Time Frame H4 is Less than zero. And When "Histogram Period =10 and Histogram Period=25", In time frame H1 both values are Less than zero after closing candle. Close Short Position : When "Histogram Period = 10" value is greater than zero in H1 time frame. For Exit there is no need to wait for candle to be close.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Hi When Histogram Period = 25 of Time Frame H4 is greater than zero. (after closing candle? ) When Histogram Period = 25 of Time Frame H4 is Less than zero. (after closing candle? ) Lordorly

--- 帖子 #183 ---
certainly have to closed candle

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Hello again, published two Backtest of November, the EA is very slow. The BT. are different in terms of the output rule. One calculates the histogram h1 exit with 10. The other with Histogram H4 10 Lordorly

--- 帖子 #185 ---
According to this backtest, i wont recommend EA for Histobollinger.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
????????? I made an EA that is exactly histobollinguer rules, and the results are not good?????. Blame the rules or EA's fault??. Anyway, with the second option of exit (H4 Histogram period 10). the results are not spectacular but steady. Lordorly P.S. I'm trying to shorten execution times for BT to do. faster.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Thanks for EA. I really appreciate your efforts. I need one more favour. I think it won't be difficult for you. Can you create EA with only one rule and do the backtest? Rule : Time Frame = H1 Only one histogram FS30_Histogram with Period = 25 Long Entry : Value of Histogram is greater than zero after closing the candle. Long entry should carry the position until Exit condition occur. Exit : When value of histogram becomes less than zero after closing the candle. Short Entry : Value of Histogram is less than zero after closing the candle. Short Entry should carry the position until Exit condition occur Exit : When value of histogram becomes greater than zero after closing the candle. Thanks in advance. Feel free to ask any question

Yes.

Hi,

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Hi, more BT. Lordorly

--- 帖子 #192 ---
H4 filter is very good. I know that new traders do not have expertise using all tools so i added H4 Histogram as filter. So far back test is not bad. If traders use this strategy wisely, they can make money.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
I'd be curious to see how the back test would fair using the H4 time frame and only using the Histogram = 25 (closing bar) for entries and exits.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
??. Rules for entries and exit pls.? Lordorly

--- 帖子 #195 ---
H4 Time Frame Long Entries - Histrogram = 25 above zero..... Exits below zero. Short Entries - Histogram = 25 below zero.... Exits above zero.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Hi, results in post #190 Lordorly SORRY is H1, soon.........

--- 帖子 #197 ---
based on rule, we should SELL EUR/USD just now

--- 帖子 #198 ---
DiD you use support lines as take profit? Many trader are not using support/resistance as take profit and then they say that our trade is in loss. Always use support/resistance as take profit. When first take profit is achieved then i wait for candle to close on the other side of suport/resistance lines and then place next order. Please all traders who are following this system, use this technique and i am sure that there winning probability will be more than 85%

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Hello AahmadPlease whats de difference between support/resitance and Pivots

--- 帖子 #200 ---
you have some calculated lines (targets) where price reaches and then market stay there and decide the next direction. For downtrend, calculated lines are called support (S1,S2,S3). For uptrend, calculated lines are called resistance (R1,R2,R3). Pivot is the main line (From where trend start) where market stay for some time and then decide the direction. I am not giving the definitions from books, it is just general idea to understand. As Vahn said that sell signal is activated and if he used support lines as take profit then he is in good position otherwise result could be loss.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Good afternoon! Prompt please, what means tenches of FPV? Lines the price can make a start from this?

--- 帖子 #202 ---
aahmad sir we should take buy position when price is above middle bollinger band and both histogram are green. for sell vice a versa i need ur reply

--- 帖子 #203 ---
aahmandtnx for our reply am grateful

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Bollinger is just for your analysis, you have to take position if both bollinger have same colour.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
FPV and PV is almost same and it is center line. It is the nearest point where market starts.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
It's just for analysis But how the point for entry ??

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Point of entry is given in first post

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Sorry i couldn't post the daily chart with successful trades for few days because i was not feeling well. Today again +30 Pips profit is sure. Again i want to mention that when both histogram and fisher indicator match the colour then this is entry point. From now on, i will post daily chart with successful trades so that new traders understand it completely. Traders will have idea how to enter and exit the market. Today trade, you can see that it touch the Support S2. You can see the word open (at this point Asian session starts) and S1 was very close when system gave signal so i set S2 as take profit.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Thanks for ur effort aahmadkeep up the good workcheers

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Hey Lordorly, Any further updates on the back test results using the above parameters? Cheers!!

--- 帖子 #211 ---
In my honest opinion for H4 time frame the SSL Bar 3 indicator should be set as daily time frame that is 1440 instead of 240 set as default (H4), after which trades should be taken only inline with the SSL Bar 3 indicator. Best Regards Raza

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Hi Luipie, Can you send me your Renko indicator and the indicator on it? Thank you very much!

--- 帖子 #213 ---
I post here the BBands Bollinger indicator in color.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
I think you did not understand it. Signal for entry is Long Position: When both( histogram and fisher indicator) has value greater than zero. (This is entry) Short Position: When both (histogram and fisher indicator) has value greater Less zero. (This is entry)

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #216 ---
And what? The SSL indicator bar is rejected or not?

--- 帖子 #217 ---
ONLY for consideration............

--- 帖子 #218 ---
As i mentioned before that for traders who have some experience, they can use only fisher and histogram. For new traders, all three indicators should match (fisher, histogram and ssl bar).

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Hello, sorry for the delay in my response. The results are not good, it's hard to just repaint indicators Lordorly

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Major reason of bad results of EA is that we are not implementing complete procedure. I have asked traders that when they recieve entry signal then they should set take profit as next support/resistance line. If you can implement in this way then it would be great. It does not mean that we do not have exit signal. If take profit is not achieved then Histogram period = 10 change the colour , it is exit signal. Entry signal is that when histogram period =10 and period =25 match the colour.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Hi Rules for exit ? next support/resistence ??? Lordorly

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Indicators : I am using FXI Pivot indicator to find the support and resistance lines. Histogram period = 10 (I will give name H.P 10) Histogram Period = 25 (I will give name H.P 25) Entry Rules: Long Position: When value of both H.P 10 and H.P 25 is greater than zero after closing the candle. Place buy order with take profit = Resistance (R1) which can be find from FXI Pivot indicator. Exit rule: If R1 take profit is not achieved and value of H.P 10 became less than zero then exit the long position. Re-Entry: If during UPTREND, value of H.P 10 goes less than zero and after a while value turned positive and H.P 25 is already carrying positive value then this is re-entry for long position(because both match the colour). Short Position: When value of both H.P 10 and H.P 25 is less than zero after closing the candle. Place sell order with take profit = Support (S1) which can be find from FXI Pivot indicator. If S1 take profit is not achieved and value of H.P 10 became greater than zero then exit the short position. Re-Entry: If during DOWNTREND, value of H.P 10 goes greater than zero and after a while value turned negative and H.P 25 is already carrying negative value then this is re-entry for short position.

Parameters FXI Pivot indicator ???? lordorly CHART pls.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
tnx aahmad for ur chats please could u mark the point of entry and exit on ur chart thanks

--- 帖子 #228 ---
When candle having Green Line close, this is entry because both histogram and fisher values were greater than zero. Normally R1 is my take profit but i wanted to sleep so i closed the position early.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
No, i don't have parameters. I just downloaded from forexfactory.com.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
THANKS Lordorly

--- 帖子 #231 ---
As i mentioned earlier that normally my take profit is R1 but i am closing the position earlier. Now you can see that R1 take profit limit is achieved. If i donot set take profit then again market has red(sell) bars and going down. I always set take profit one or two pips earlier than R1/S1 limit. I just wanted to make sure that my take profit is achieved for sure.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Hello, sorry for my question, which use rules, the post 222, or those of the last chart (there are other indicators, fisher, ssl, etc) Lordorly

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Fisher indicator is same as Histogram Period = 25. There is no need of SSL indicator. Yes use the rules given in post 222. Thanks for your effort.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Hi, Time: Session EU or Session USD or Asia Session ?? Thanks

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Hi, Time: Session EU or Session USD or Asia Session ?? Thanks

--- 帖子 #236 ---
So if I am reading charts correctly, no signal yet today dec 11/12 correct?

--- 帖子 #237 ---
For EA, there is no limit of session.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
As i have already mentioned that R1 is my first target as take profit but if i closed my position early then i looked at first candle of Asian session. If trend is UPWARD then i place buy stop with 5 Pips + Spread otherwise Sell stop. In post 198, i also mentioned that if R1 is achieved and candle close above R1 in H1 time frame then i place another Buy order with take profit R2. You can see that R2 is also achieved. I know that market has gone even above R2 but for new traders, i won't recommend anyother position after R2/S2 in single day. If you did not use buy stop then after candle closed above R1, traders can make money with another buy order. +10 Pips are sure.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Sorry, i totally missed your post. Indicator is given on first page "aahmad29 strategy" or post 41.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
aahmad29 tnx for your attention. Today I took 25pip with your strategy.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Hi aahmad29, I like your method, simple and effective. Thank you for your generosity, god bless you.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Hi, I would be interesting to get an alarm when both histogram period 10 and 25 are greater than zero at the same time!

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Thanks. If any trader who has some experience, they can get more benefits by using this strategy. I found that when trend changes, this strategy is very effective to identify the change.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
I am not programmer so it is not possible for me. If anyone else can do it then it is useful thing.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Method which i described in above thread is useful for continuing trend. You can see that if you had buy stop order then R1 take profit is achieved for today. It is enough for me.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
EU: 1.3097 is important for bullish signal.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
You can see that signal was at 1.3080 and R1 take profit is achieved at 1.3103. Happy Pips +20

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Today was very good day. Histobollinger system gave us two entry signals. First signal screenshot is given in last post but i also mentioned entry and re-entry green lines in this screenshot. In second entry we achieved R3 but as i said that R2 is our second take profit in single day. Second entry was at 1.3086 and take profit was 1.3131. +40 Pips Profit

--- 帖子 #249 ---
I have made one change and it is mentioned on Page 1. Modification is given below: Note: Please change the Period of FS30_Histogram from 10 to 9. Updated Dec 14, 2012

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Sorry to have ignored here. I rarely/never check PM's and have disabled (them) Now, I would simply like to present this chart of E/U As evidenced, there was no real selling from the monthly pivot @ 1.2897 It is also worthy of noting that the (CORAL) 125 MA on the hourly is much the same as the 34 MA on 4H

--- 帖子 #251 ---
When you trade with many indicators you easily get confused. indicators are meant to show what the price is doing on chart. indicator that qualifies you for sell can in the next 15mmunte qualifies you for buy. Forex war fear are not carnal that indicators can fight.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Hi Everyone I admit that Monday was not successfull day for Histobollinger. Tuesday has covered not only loss but also gave you positive result. Monday: Loss -11 Pips (Loss 11 Pips) Tuesday: Entry 1.3162 and Closed at R2 1.3207 (Profit +40 Pips)

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Wednesday is wonderful day for Histobollinger. First Trade Long : Entry 1.3236 to 1.3289 (R2) --- +50 Pips Second Trade Short: Entry 1.3241 to 1.3196 (S1) ---- + 50 Pips I have already mentioned that our first target is R1 or S1 and then R2 or S2. In single day, we are not looking for R3 or S3.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Hi, Mr. Ahmad..... Would like to know, why you not short EU at previous bar, as shown in the arrows..... Thanks.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
I couldn't completely understand your question so i will explain in more details and hopefully you will get your answer. You have drawn two lines with two arrows. I have mentioned that all three indicators should match after closing the candle before placing order. Left most line or arrow is the entry point where fisher, histogram and SSL bar are red but you have to take short position after closing the candle. So when candle is closed then we are sure that we have confirmed signal. I hope you found your answer but if Not then send me your question in detail and i will be happy to answer.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Hi, Thanks for your respond. My doubt is simple. I put the first arrow and line, the three indicators are match. Fisher, histogram and SSL are red. Also the following candle, and third candle which i put 2nd arrow. And why you not short during the first arrow, or second arrow, and wait after so many hours only you taking the position to short.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Yes, you are right that first Arrow is the entry point but to be safe side you have to wait so that candle (which has first arrow) is closed. I am not taking any other candle as entry. I was short at First arrow or first line (which match all three indicators) is the entry point. Probably there is some misunderstanding that i took short position late but it is not true. My take profit was S1.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
@ahmad you have backtested it ? if yes then for how much time ?

--- 帖子 #259 ---
I think i did not mention the candle with arrow so there was confusion about entry. Here i am explaining the next two trades and i have put two arrows (UP,DOWN) but again you have to take position after closing that pointed candle. First Trade Long: 1.3246 to 1.3281 (R1 Take Profit) -- +30 Pips Second Trade Short : 1.3245 to 1.3190 (S1 Take Profit) --- +50 Pips

--- 帖子 #260 ---
It is not only tested for three months but i am also using this method for more than one year. I love H1 time frame because it keeps me away from market noise and signal is more clear to me.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Yes, this is what I am talking about. haha; is clear for me now. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
I want to share my own experience to new traders. When i started using Histobollinger method on my live account, i was always hesitating in placing order and closing the order. It resulted in loss because i was not following all the rules and i was always late for entry. My mentor told me that there is no system which can give you 100% Positive result but there are trading systems which can give you 80% Positive result. He also said that Patience and courage is the only key to get full benefits from 80% Positive results. Wish you all Happy Holidays and Happy Christmas.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
i have seen that histo is repainting how are you countering this problem ? the ea attached with the thread works ?

--- 帖子 #264 ---
I wont recommend EA. Yes you are right that Histogram repaint but i have already explained that i have added two filters to recover that issue. 1. FS30_Histogram Period =10 is signal (Not entry) 2. Fisher Period =25 is filter 3. SSL Bar H4 is filter When all three match then it is entry and confirmed signal. When all three indicators match then Mostly Histogram wont repaint.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Hi, Mr Ahmad; Do you have any re-entry strategy, let says if we miss the entry as you marked the arrow there?

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Yes there is only one strategy. If FS30_Histogram period=10 chnages its colour (Different from Fisher) and then match it again with the colour of Fisher Period=25 then you can Re-Enter.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Hello ahmad Are you using the 10 or 9 period Histogram ? Because on the first post update it says to use the 9. Thanks for the strategy man, working well so far

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Thanks for encouragement. Post#1 is always updated. Yes Period=9 is the update.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
So got these 2 entries today. Both hit TP, entries could have been slightly better but not bad for first 2 trades. Actually had 4 trades. All in profit, 3 hit TP and 1 I closed manually for a small profit. Aahmad29 seems like your system is not too bad. Obviously it's only the first few trades and the results are inconclusive but it does give you confidence. The beauty of this system is the place and forget mentality. I'll be honest I was watching the trades early this morning and came close to manually closing them but made myself sit on my hands. Got rid of the BB and MA, 3 indicators and the pivots are just fine by me. There were 2 other entries which I missed. 1 was at 07:00GMT on the A/U which would've been a RR of 1:1 and another at 07:00GMT on the G/U which would've hit R1. Will keep trading the system and contribute to the forum when I can. Saf

Thanks for posting the chart. I was going to post the chart. I am happy that your initial trades go well.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
It's the least I can do, I should be thanking you for showing me the system. Just a quick question, how do you set your SL? I've been looking for either the last swing high/low or just below a pivot/resistance/round number. Do you ever move SL to BE or do you trail the price? Sometimes the price doesn't reach a pivot point and reverses, what do you do at these times? It happened with the N/U today thankfully I had exited that trade for a small profit long before. Thanks again. Saf

--- 帖子 #272 ---
When i take any position i always have 30 Pips stoploss but it does not mean that i wait the market to hit my stoploss. I have explained the strategy to close the trade in my Post#1. If my order is active and have +20 Pips in profit then i place stoploss at BE and additional 2 pips. so that if market moves in opposite direction then you don't loose money.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Been looking back at the results from yesterday and today. Results are very promising. Found about 15 entries on 2 different brokers within the last 2 days. All, but 1 moved from atleast 1 pivot to the next. Will keep testing to find moves which don't go our way. Entered 2 trades earlier, having abit of an issue with SSL bar 3 indicator. Definite repainting issue on the E/U entry was showing 2 blue bars but when I switched TF and came back to 1HR TF both the bars turned red. Will keep an eye on it and update when trades are finished. Saf

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Update on the 2 trades. Won 1 lost 1. Also realised it's better to wait for SSL indicator to give a signal before the others. Will try it this way and get back the results. Saf

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Yes, in my strategy you have to wait for all three indicators to match (including SSL Bar). SSL Bar is also one of the filter so that you stay away from loss. But still sometimes you may have loss and then next trade will be profitable. There is one rule which i always follow: If you receive signal for taking position and you take your position but market goes in opposite direction then close your current position and wait for entry in that direction.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
It was my own fault for losing that trade. I know the mistake i made and hopefully will learn from it. Need to learn to exit sooner and all. Hope and fear played a big part and all. There were plenty of opportunities for entries today. Watched them but didnt trade after that loss. Oh well keep trying, 5 wins 1 loss. Not bad for 2 hours of work a day. Will do it full time from next week onwards. Saf

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Has anybody come up with a 4hr or daily trading set-up for this strategy? Would the settings for the indicators be the same except for the SSL?

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Hi Everyone, Last Four Days Result of Histobollinger: Monday: Short Entry ; 1.3210 to 1.3196 (S1) = 14 Pips Tuesday : Short Entry ; Closed at Break Even = 0 Pips Wednesday: Long Entry ; 1.3206 to 1.3263 (R2) = +50 Pips Wednesday: Short Entry ; 1.3238 to 1.3163 (S1) = +70 Pips Thursday: Short Entry ; 1.3174 to 1.3127 (S1) = +40 Pips

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Good results aahmad ! Very profitable system !

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Results look good. have you considered setting up a trade explorer to make them easier to follow?

--- 帖子 #281 ---
No, I am not setting trade explorer because when i started trading ,i was depending completely on this system but now with the experience i am taking more risk. I introduced this system to new traders so that they will have some positive results. I am also introducing this system with M15 time frame. So far i asked traders to follow H1 timeframe and if traders are not comfortable with M15 then still they can keep using H1 timeframe. From now on, I will also post results with M15 timeframe.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Looking forward to see how you trade the 15 min tf. I'm still trying to gain confidence on the 1 hr tf with the indicators repainting. I've had 1 win and 2 loses. One lose was due to getting into the trade too late or indicator repainting, not sure. Are there alarms that can be set when all three indicators agree?

--- 帖子 #283 ---
i'm just hesitant to invest the time into looking further into this strategy without seeing you're profitable (with it and whatever else you may be using) cause a lot of the previously posted screenshots look like they have an entry at a point which wouldn't have a live signal given the repainting.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Dear Mr. Ahmad, As I running the simulation today, on Wednesday, the signal only show after 2 bars from the bar you shorted. I haven't try other days yet. Is there any other thing that you use to determine your entry? I think due to the repainting issues, a lot people getting confuse. Can you show your trade statement? for more convincing to all the followers.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
I already mentioned that i am taking positions on smaller timeframes and i am taking more risk for more profit. so you won't find the exact signal and i don't want to confuse the traders. This system was used by me in the beginning when i started trading 3 years ago. I am using same system on smaller time frame and on the base of my experience; i am not using SSL bar. Histogram repaint upto 3 bars; not more than that so if you are looking at histogram then you will have signal for sure at 4th bar.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
it's good of you to want to share your success and help out new traders. if your point is to not confuse traders, though, wouldn't it be better to be more consistent and transparent? to show and explain all your setups and not say things like your system uses SSL, but at the same time your system doesn't use SSL the way you trade it? What good are those results if 'new traders' don't understand how you get there so they can duplicate your success and learn to trade for themselves? Don't you think it will be more confusing when they don't understand why their results are so different than yours? And if you were really just trying to help wouldn't you share the best version of your system on whatever time frame you trade and take the time to explain your market perspective? This is why things like trade explorers help. People can follow your trades real time and see what the setups looked like at the time you entered and exited. they can also quickly separate quality traders who express their care for others by sharing their knowledge from those who want people on the internet to be impressed by them but can't trade well.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Hi All, Im pretty new to trading but find your thread very informative. Can anyone advise on the best way to get started in MT4 and the preferred time frame? Thanks Sandip

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Hi I decided not to post anything bymyself because there was no benefit. There is no such indicator which can be 100% Accurate. I advise you to start with Demo account. First master your strategy and then jump in the market with live account. I will advise you to start with H4 time frame. If you are going to use my indicators then use only one indicator "FS30_Histogram" with Period=25. In the beginning there is no rentry position. When value of FS30_Histogram is greater than zero for last candle, take long position. When value of FS30_Histogram is less than zero for last candle, take short position. When your order is in positive you have to learn how to manage your positions and secure your profit.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Many thanks

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Remember, indicator can give you direction of PA and direction can change anytime. I use this indicator in different timeframes. I also started with H4 time frame and now i trade in almost all time frames except M1. Today i traded in M5. Results are here.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Hi Do you still keep the 25 Period on A smaller time frame as well?

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Sometimes but i won't advise you to try this on smaller time frames. H1 and H4 time frames are good for 25 Period.

Scalping on short cycles. Added 3 more pips on UJ

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Last 4 days scalping results.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Todays scalping results and still contnue to find some more pips. I wanted to reach 10 pips target daily.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Today's target is achieved. Now going to sleep. Busy tomorrow and probably not able to trade.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
I placed three trades and my strategy brought positive results in pips but profit is nothing. This is the learning material. My trades were stabbed by Swap Fee. You can see in screenshots. So careful when you choose your broker. One of my EU buy trade is active with 3 pips take profit.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
I did not try to make pips during the release of NFP but few hours before NFP i found some opportunities and got pips. Again consistent profit and positive results. 3 pips take profit achieved in all three trades.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
I have full time job so i get less time for trading but i am happy. My trading results from Sep 1 to Sep 6 2013 are given. only 4 trading days 3,4,5,6 Sep results.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
I am using M5 time frame for scalping but now i will also do manual testing with H1 time frame. Note i am not sure about the draw down. Sep 06, 2013 - Posted just 1 Hour before closing the forex market 1. AU pair is expected to go down at least 30 pips. At this time PA is at 0.9186. 2. GU pair is expected to go down at least 30 pips. At this time PA is at 1.5632. Both pairs up cycle is ended and i think now down cycle will start. Only the issue is that 3 big brothers (EU, GU, AU) should be in same position but Eu behaving differently and it is in the middle and direction is not clear. Lets see what happen on coming Monday.

--- 帖子 #301 ---

Manual Testing of indicator "TrendWave.ex4" is failed

--- 帖子 #307 ---
One thing i believe that we always have to continue our research for the best so that was the main reason to test "Trendwave" indicator. It is my hobby to do manual testing of indicator in live market. I did not get the chance to trade this week and last night i had short position of AU for 10 pips.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
I am lucky to get one more signal and quick 10 more pips with EU

Long Term Trade: It could close in more profit but sometimes it happens

--- 帖子 #314 ---
aahmad long time passed how are histob results going?

--- 帖子 #315 ---
I have only one issue that i have full time job and i am not long term trader. Whenever i get some free time then i do some scalping. Scalping is going fine and results are very good. If i talk about histobollinger then those trades needs time and little bit research about the market situation and i am not able to do nowadays.

Respected sir, THANKS FOR SHAREING i am new user of mt4 , i cant see FISHER, HISTOGRAM &amp; SSL JOINTLY together, how can i upload together these indicator Warm Regards Chinmay Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Hi chinmay. I don't really know what you meant by upload together. But if you mean one over the other. I guess you need to add one indicator first and then drag the other one from the list of indicators over it. I had a question though. I see you have a Nifty chart open on metatrader. Are you using the service by Firstcharting or is there some borker providing NSE charts on metatrader. Thanks in adavance. Cheers !!!

--- 帖子 #319 ---
I couldn't understand what you mean by jointly together. All indicators are attached to chart one by one.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Respected Sir, Sorry for my poor ENGLISH There are many data provider in market fot mt4, Last 6 months i have found 3,4 data provider, FIRSTT CHARTTING is one of them, few months ago i use it for MCX &amp; NSE. its very good. Sir, now system is running with both indicator &amp; ITS GOOD here the screen shot

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Respectd AAHMAD sir, SORRY FOR POOR ENGLISH Now system is running with FISHER YUR4IK, SSL BAR &amp; HISTOGRAM , Yesterday i cant see these indicators with jointly THANKS FOR SHARING Regards Chinmay

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Do not forget to use Support and resistance indicator which is attached and it will help you in your decision. I also wanted to introduce scalping method but i do not have enough time. I will try my best to find some free time to bring scalping strategy so that losses would be minimum but on the other side profit will also decrease.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Respected Sir, Thanks for u r suggestion, now 2days i am watching u r stratagy Sir, how can i back test the code, if u know please tell me &amp; sir do u know about AUTOMATED TRADING ? Can we automated trade in mt4 ? Warm Regards Chinmay

--- 帖子 #276 ---
You can do backtest if you have historical data. You can use the option strategy tester. Automated trading is done by a program (EA) designed with any strategy to execute your orders but i won't recommend. I also don't recommend back test. There is one thing which can help you is "Simulator". I have attached this simulator. Just google the word "Forex simulator" probably you will find information. I downloaded this from one thread in forexfactory but i donot remember the exact name of that thread.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Respected Sir Thanks, i am using mt4 from last 3/4 months, i dont understand what u said, i dowload the u r attachted fiel &amp; pest in the Expert/Indicator Folder but i cant see when we open mt4, i dont know what to do with u r attached file?, how it works can u tell me plese or tell me any web name whic is guide ................ thanks gaing for u r co-operation Warm Regards Chinamy

--- 帖子 #278 ---
you have to paste the LFH Trading simulator 3.ex4 to "experts" folder and not in "expert/indicator". restart your MT4, go to "view" click on strategy tester. in the window that opens select "LFH Trading simulator" in the "Expert Advisor" field, select the symbol you want to backtest, select the time period, like 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 hour, etc, select the dates (depends on the data that is in your MT4), click on visual mode and click on start. After the MT4 collects all the data required, you will see the candles moving in the above chart.., now select the template that you want to backtest and you are good to run. aapko yeh samajhme aayega shaayad.

When using M5 TF what period do you set on the SSL bar ? M15 ? Keep H4 ?

--- 帖子 #282 ---
I already mentioned in one post that i do not use SSL bar anymore. You have to be very careful in M5 TF. Do not forget to use Support and resistance indicator. I have already posted that indicator. You can use all other indicators in M5 TF but do practice on Demo account. If you need any help or question let me know. Probably i won't reply quickly because i have other full time job but i will reply as soon as possible. Please post chart with your question then it is easy to answer.

I will try to reply as soon as possible but it can take time due to my full time job.

Respected aahmad Sir THANKS

As i mentioned in my recent posts that i will bring in scalping system to earn 3 to 5 Pips but now i decided not to just give away indicators or system. Instead of giving indicators, i will give screenshots and new traders or learning traders try to determine the strategy which can be used to earn 3 to 5 pips successfully. In this way new traders learn a lot and will be confident once they define strategy. Screenshots will give you idea about indicators but you have to find strategy. I will try my best to participate in discussion. Wish you all Good Luck.
