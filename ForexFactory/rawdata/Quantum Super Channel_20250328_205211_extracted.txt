Good Day, I hope to never stop learning... This page has changed overtime and will now be used to reflect Tools I have designed. Special Note: ++ TRADING IS HIGH RISK!!!! ** IF YOU ADVERTISE HERE YOU WILL BE BANNED - NO QUESTIONS ASKED. ** IF YOU DUMP YOUR INDICATORS HERE, YOU WILL BE BANNED. //---- NB: Tools published by me are free to use. If a tool is marked "R&amp;D", than that is just what it is. I share what I can, and hope my tools will assist the community's profitability. //---- Quantum Super Channel: It is a derivative of the Quantum indicator found here . Enhanced to view price action within a repainting channel. The word "Super" refers to when the setting for SuperChannel = false. I understand "repainting" as defined by fellow traders. My view of repainting is price trying tell us something. Colours : 0 - Red : Top channel Line; 1 - Green : Bottom Channel Line; 2 - Green : Bottom Dot; 3 - Red : Top Dot; 4 - BLue : MidLine; 5 - Blue : Inside/Outside Bar //---- dwebInsideBar : There are many on the internet. This is available in the Quantum Super Channel by default. //---- dwebMA-Median: Moving average tool with a small twist. Available here //---- dwebPriceTrend: Is a bid revolutionise the way we trade or view price. It remains to be seen what this will turn out to be in the future. Examples: here from page #20 Updated Tool: here dwebInverseBeta posted here //---- Research &amp; Development : (Features and Trading strategy may be updated because of NEW developments) (This will bee updated soon) Please post your results, it helps with further development and thought! Play around with settings, where possible. Enjoy! dweb

Hi dweb Congratulation your new indicator. I will try and monitor it. Do it repaint or fix signal on band? Here is new trade Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Thank you Anthony_sg...happy green pips to you on your H1 approach. Please share your experience here.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Hi Anthony, The signal is confirmation of a current new LH/HH or HL/LL, if the next bar forms a new LH/HH or HL/LL it will move accordingly. Use the Quantum Indicator found here to keep the signal on the bar. Thanks

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Thanks DWEB I'm following that thread also. I think you can use some indicators to filter signal like SD or MA 50 as you posted I am using this template to combine with your indi. Enjoy!

I applaud your enthusiasm to test and modify your strategy as you move forward dweb including the posting of informative charts. In my view a strategy should always be tested and modified for improvement as an ongoing and continual process. Its also refreshing to see you applying it to the DAX and NASDAQ. The use of price action in your analysis will make a big difference too! Masterrmind............

Observations of this morning's trades... Entry: was late as I am busy programming (novie) Exits: a better exit should have been with the Channel switch on, and exiting on new high(s), pending market momentum. Please note: Inside bar trade add-on(s) require confirmed and strong momentum (if I am not using the right words, please forgive) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

USDCAD... 1. I overlayed 2 x Quantum Super Channel (QSC) ++ the one QSC had default settings ++ The other had the SuperChannel = False, Channel Colours changed, HighDepth = 300, LowDepth = 100. These can be changed to the pair you are trading and serve here just as an example. 2. I overlayed on the chart a Bolinger Band, settings: Period = 55, and Standard Deviation = 2.7 Oberservation: The QSC where the SuperChannel = False acts the same way as the Bolinger on the chart, although not entirely the same (trying to stop a debate here, LOL). Traders must choose whats suite them. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Chart where ShowChannel = False. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Clean Chart Preferred Attached Image (click to enlarge)

The Quantum Super Channel is built for the manual trader - I hope to mod it for EA. Now, just focused on application in market. The Rule are simple (see post #1). Use your own trading style/method. Examples listed on this thread is how I do it - Comment if you find it workable or not...that's the whole idea. Tools: ( Less is more motto ) 1. Quantum Super Channel - continuous development planned. many possibilities that will live up to the "super". 2. Strength meter. ( There are many CSM on FF, most, if not all have different flavours of measurement. Use the one that fits you) 3. dweb RSI (my own mod, still in development) 4. Lines...I draw lines like crazy... just to make sure I identify the direction correctly Some ideas from Matt098: 1. Reduce the size of the lot 2. Stop-loss at right place - I use the channel lines to give guidance. A narrow channel = tight SL, A wide channel = tight SL or where the previous high/low was formed 3. Don't recede from trading plan 4. MM 5. Don't trade during NFP 6. Don't trade with a strong market volatility 7. Analytics Money: Small account = small target(s) = medium/high trade frequency. Hope more novice/expert/experienced/whatever (lol) traders can share their experiences here...peace

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Thanks Kmw. That example live trade will be the last published. Now I will just focus on refinement of manual method, and hopefully EA soon...Thanks for the visit!

There's also Renko Street Channel and SS Channel indis. I placed these on a graph with your Quantum Channel indi and they all align. How is Quantum Channel different from these? Just curious...

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Thanks for the feedback san99. I was referred to the Renko Street Channel, though not the SS Channel. However, you will find alignment in many indicators, up to a certain point, and that's why there are so many of them. The code in some ways are generic, hence alignment, but you will most cases find the authors have added some thing different - Quantum Super Channel is heading that way and changes are already implemented that will enhance the trading view if the novice trader. I applaud the expert who bring out brilliant systems. Systems work for some, and not for others - hence different approaches to trading - we are all fighting the machines whom we trade against. QSC is just another gun to shoot with, and hope fully more winning trades. It is far from finish, however the development path has been designed already...so here we go. Traders must use what fits their style/methods, etc.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Cosmetic change to come....might upload tomorrow..let's hope Think I must change the "Candle Bar Open" line to "Bull" or "Bear" and corresponding colour. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Pips display changed. The pips display of the Channel Width and Bull/Bear Bar will function where SuperChannel = False, and ShowChannel = False...This may be useful to someone using other methods/systems. Attached Image (click to enlarge) SuperChannel = True, ShowChannel = True. The SuperChannel setting will influence which channel pips are measured. The ShowChannel can be True or False. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

v1.05a (see post #1) The short horizontal line helps to de-clutter the screen. I am hoping to do more... Distance from open: I will rectify in v1.06. It calculates from open to high channel line in stead candle open. Channel Width: is the difference between the top and bottom channel lines Bull.Bear Bar: looks at the close position in relation to open position of the current candlee, and calculates the difference between the bar close and top/bottom channel line pending the bar direction. ie, Bull bar will show difference between and bar and top channel line.

Brilliant work Masterrmind

--- 帖子 #52 ---
The repainting channel of the Quantum Super Channel tells what PA is doing. interpret it correctly and you probabilities increases. It repaints to indicate direction change happening and "coming", it shows the impact of things such as volatility and momentum, and maybe more experienced traders can add more here...my vocab is not that big. The IB channel is created when an IB is detected is a valuable source of information ito of market indecision. There are two type of IB its currently user defined bu the control ShowDefaultInsidebar . Setting the control to True gives you a default IB, but setting it to False is another animal still to be discovered. The default setting gives more alerts. Used in the correct way can increase your winning trades. Know the momentum through strength indicators, and other tools. See what the MA20 and Midline is doing. The MA55 ito the rules I have now made optional as do not use it much anymore. Publish your trade results here so others can comment, and really thank Kmw and Masterrmind for publishing. Their screens are not cluttered, and this is key to the development of the Quatum Super Channel...and "Super" here does mean "Supper:. It is mean to be used to put bread on your table. My losses are contained, my winning rate have increase - 1:10. This tools is not meant to replace what you are doing, but to enhance. Happy trading and green pips.

Thanks dweb.......... There are plenty of setups on these types of trades, choose wisely and manage your account and keep an eye on DD. My plan is to let the 1st trade hit TP and then lock in the other trades SL's @ BE + a few pips for a couple of 'free trades'. ps. I don't just look at M30 either but all TF's mainly from M15 through to D1........... Masterrmind...........

Quote by Laurent Bernut "If a loss is too small to hurt, do you think it's big enough to contribute?", said to a friend who made a bad bet on Toyota and Mazda - market moved against him! ++ What separates the men from the boys is the ability to set a stoploss and the ability to honour them. ++ The key to making money in the market is to accept to be wrong, and move on. Any trading system is an extreme formalization of believes and habits. ++ Start your day with a big world picture ++ Focus on Money Management/Position sizing/Risk Management. Larry Williams said people are either too conservative or too racy" ++ Exit: (is more important than entry, IMHO) **** when you feel good about your trade - close it or cover half.Scale in, scale out. **** Break even, it's also a win. Trading fatigue: you will be retested, and given false positives. Reduce your near losses, and your winning rate will increase. ++ Stoploss is king ++ Partial exit: reduce the risk by closing some of the trades ++ Time out: this is trades that does not go anywhere - close them ++ Every time you say Yes to a loser, you say No to a winner!!! Cut the losses! ++ If its very difficult to say goodbye to a trade - you starting with trouble. Know your exit before entry. How can we test an exit without a defined entry? ++ Random entry...brutal!!!

Hi dweb seen you got your thread here so thought I would post my setup here, after some more playing around today using your system aswell as the cycle identifier spikes on bottom to match with 4 greens/reds for buy/sell and to take exits also as like to trade manually this soon into the game, also thought a price action from 0.0 to 100.0 pivot lines for day lines with coloured zones, I look and the h4 and D1 time frames to confirm trend so I know what to look out for on the H1, auto trend line indicators on higher time frames also and a bollinger/rsi indi that puts arrows on chart so not a repaint jobby either so will see how it goes with the 3 time frame setups, have put some pictures here below will be aud/usd am working with at moment, hope this helps people for ideas too happy trading.... Updates will follow if all is well

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Great work Antoni4EVA. I would love to see more people add their views and setups as it helps to identify what the channel needs more of or less of. We want to super charge it so the basic setups has an edge. Great Charts Antoni4EVA

Good Day Ya'll, The thread was never meant to change the way people trade, but enhance their trading styles/methods. Advantage of the Channel : ++ We set our HighDepth and LowDepth settings as a visual range target. The Super Channel facilitates by pin pointing how far you are from the target. It does not predict price, but rather the effect of price action . Many examples here attest to that. ++ A decrease in distance between the Channel lines and Bar open , is an indication of the visual targets closing in. ++ Quantum Super Channel is not momentum, but shows the effect thereof by narrowing the channel. This effect can be seen fast on the M1 time frame. ++ InsideBar Channel width : During market indecision, you can scalp the channel if it is wide enough for scalping as in most cases it ranges in the channel for a while. Do this only when you are confident enough to do so, and have the conviction of the opportunity. Use a lower time frame for entries. More info will be made available, that hopefully can be used in your trading methods/styles. dweb

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Yes EURUSD [M1] and GBPUSD [M1] can be scalped between the channels.... works like a charm but always keep a close eye on a break out situation which might mean closing out the final trade sooner rather than later. Many other pairs can also be scalped in between the channels too .... great when waiting for higher TF setups to materialize while you fill in time, grab a little more profit from the market.

Thanks dweb, There is no shortage of opportunities but sometimes you miss some potential setups on other TF's when watching multiple pairs..........

hi dweb, with great interest i read your thread. There are very interesting ideas, specially because i'am also experimenting with the "super-signals-channel" or however this indi will be called... Here is a picture of my version, let me know if u want a copy, because i dont want to publish it for now. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Btw, the InsideBar-part of your indi is very interesting, is it possible that you make only a IB-indi and to share it as .ex4 ?! Green pips and greetings robcole

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Hi robcole, You should publish if you want to use what you have to assist others. The channel code is generic hence developers will come with their own flavour, and that what makes the FF community great. A search for inside bar indicators will lead to many here at FF and elsewhere- thus do not want to create another one, unless it is/will be different. QSC strategic design is different and at a basic level meant for newbies. (see post #1), should you wish to take the '"channel trend" to a higher level please do so. an ever changing market needs an ever changing think tank. Best pips to you. let me know when your thread is running, I will follow!

--- 帖子 #104 ---
hi dweb, thx for your fast answer! Thats the point, i'am searching a long time for a very good IB-indi, and i have never seen such a thing like this!! That was the reason for my question for that... If you don't like to make a full new indi, can you please PM me the Part of Code for that ?? THX, robcole

Yesterday was too slow for words, so no market for me, but today.... AUDJPY trades.... IB Channel exploitation...newbie talk... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Hi dweb, Any chance you could code in a user option that allows for a true/false setting for current and previous IB channel(s) ? The aim being to show past trades with relevant IB channels since as soon as new IB is produced after a certain period the previous IB channel + star is automatically deleted. It would be nice to post a chart with the IB channel + star that I used for any previous trades. Note: if not then that's ok since I can always draw them on my chart manually.....

I've had nice pips from the QSC. Just wondering if u can add an EA to close trades at new HH, LL or new opposite signal from PriceChannel_Stop v9.2. Thanks

Hi dextroze, Thanks for the feedback, however, that would defeat the purpose of the QSC release and its intended path if I am using another indicator's to open/close orders. Someone else may be able to help you. dweb

A few issues with the IB indicator are as follows: 1. If InsideBarCount = 0 then multiple IB stars are painted as far back as the start of the Quantum Super Channel start point but NO IB channel lines are drawn; 2. If InsideBarCount = 1 then IB a star + IB channel lines are drawn .... all good; 3. If InsideBarCount = 2 then 2 IB stars are drawn but only 1 pair of IB channel lines for the 2nd previous IB channel are drawn, ie no IB channel lines are drawn on the most current IB channel. Note: this appears to be the case for the following: v1.05b,c,d etc and dweb Inside bar v1.00 What would be great is for a setting of say InsideBarCount = N where the value N produces N stars and N pairs of IB channel lines. Such that if InsideBarCount = 5 then 5 stars are drawn with their respective IB channel lines. Masterrmind...........

..... It turns out that that inside bars are actually Initial Balance Highs or Lows, that when formed too narrow results in breakouts into new Distribution Price balance/levels or channels as we call it.

Pending IB Channel improvements as requested by Masterrmind....Still some work to do... Still need testing on Market Open....

Hi,​ For anyone who might be interested I have been hugely impressed in the quantum trading system that Mer designed about 5 months ago. I have just set up a system on Zulu Trades running against EURUSD. The system is running fully automated and is looking incredibly promising. I have been running the same EA against six currency pairs since September and have already seen a 60+% profit. If you're interested in following my trades you can find me at https://www.zulutrade.com/trader/314054 (also on my profile). Cheers, Mark.

Thanks dweb, Would you please check some of your formulas for the following: IB Channel width; Spread may need to be divided by10 so it reads as pips (check for 4/5 brokers); Distance from Open - perhaps have the value colored in blue for when price is above the DO and red when price is below the DO or apply +/- for above/below DO....... Today Range - perhaps divided by 10 (check if 4/5 digit broker) Hope this helps, Masterrmind........

dear dweb.. i am also started to use this quantum super channal from today and i am quite interested.. but little mistake i did ...... thought that upper red line is meant to short and did short..... but the top red line is moving up and up .... so still holding positon.. where to cut the position because i dont know where to place sl ... but i got an idea so if i tell means will you consider this to add with indicator... point number 1. when inside bar or out side bar appears alert is coming...up to that it is gooe ... after that if candle moves upon the top insidebar line means fibonacci level lines (short dotted) with corresponding price levels appears for the upper side targets and mention sl as the bottom line of the inside bar line ... if the candle cross the bottom line of inside bar means same fibonacci level lines (short dotted ) with corresponding price levels for down side targets and top insidebar line mention as sl. point number 2. some times patterns are forming .. if you know about pattern.. then that is well and good ... to add further... suppose in any time frame higher than 1 hr.. then the trend is according to that pattern. i have seen latest bearish AB=CD pattern and falls is there in vision... so for this pattern making minimum time frame can set 1 hr means the result will be higher. point number 3. volume.. i have seen many volume indicators but didnt seen any volume breakout indicator.. but volume spread indicator.. but i dint understand the working of volume indicators because of straight lines.. .. if you can understand means please add .. but i understood one thing.. day by day volume increase with price for some days and one day the volume is 10 times more than past 10days then sure that scrip is going to big move.. either long or short.... can be predict with the help of volume breakout only... for your consideration i will attach some volume indicators .. especially zz named is good based on that only i hold my copper position short in hrly chart base... but you have to decide... i will attach those volume indicators in next post............ thanking you

--- 帖子 #143 ---
really sorry to send max of my collections of volume based ... please dont anger with me.. if the system is well and good means ... its good return yielding source.. thats why i am sending all... if you consider means i am really happy.. because fibonacci retracements are number magic.. when 1.618 takes means it may get reverse or further surpass.. so there we can decide to hold or exit.. by looking volume direction...

--- 帖子 #144 ---
its not allowing me to upload much so i am splitting into few and few... please look after and come to perfect trade dweb sir... i am waiting for new release... then no other indicator is needed than this one.. when see.. chart with this that too some times along with volume identification or some fibonacci retrace points.. we can avoid the trades and save the sl too ..

Hi ramzam, Thank you for your post. In a ranging market your will sell when PA signals on Red, and buy when PA signals on green channel lines. In a trending market your observe the behavior of the midline (middle dotted line) - it will lean towards red channel line confirming up trend, and lean towards green line confirming down trend. Post #1 contains these rules. post #141 clearly identifies how the QSC assist your trading style/methods...If the picture requires more input, please let me know. The inside Bars (IB Channel) identifies the a ranging market during uptrend. The psychology of IB channels needs understanding, thus requiring market structure knowledge....lots can be said here... I have not added the Monthly Fibs/Pivots/S&amp;R yet. I, and those that actively participate, endeavor to make the indicator of such nature that the screen is not cluttered. We want simple entry/exit rules, with higher success rates. If we make a loss, we will know why and not wonder which indicator is the culprit. Indicators list by you: I am not a closed book and will willingly look at these and provide feedback...that is what we are here for. If the rules is not clear, please share some trades you have made wit Quantum Super Channel so it can be discussed in a meaningful way. I want to be able to trade not everytime, but at the right time, with the right signals... dweb

Hi..i have been reading this thread for a week and i have tired SQC today it WORKs ...but i just wanted to know what is the (star or flower) means when it appeared on ..your system is perfect ..XXXXXX

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Hi Huss70, Thank for your comment and feedback. The star is an identifier of an Inside or Outside Bar, see post #125 and read through the thread for the posts of Masterrmind. Post #141, #155 also shows exploitation of the market decision makers. When that occurs the market is waiting direction from buyers/sellers. Its what I call psychology trading...and it is a very lucrative method to trade. If add order inside channel you are technically scalping if the IB channel, as per Channelinfo, is wide enough. If the brealout is in your direction of the scalp, leave trade open...If you have longterm view, then wait for breakout by at least two candles - one candle will if your momentum is confirmed in trend direction... dweb

--- 帖子 #155 ---

EURAUD [M30; IB] 3 longs for just over +30 pips........ Attached Image (click to enlarge) Note: original trigger was 2 candles prior to the one taken but no problem waiting for a later entry especially getting in at a similar price! Stops moved up as trade progresses but on smaller TP trades ie lower range IB channels apply common sense which means in this case that the SL movements are slower to action thereby providing breathing space and allowing the trades to move. My final trade was taken out at the 161.8 fib somewhat expected and I was certainly not going to allow all the profit to evaporate. It would not surprise me to see the 300 level eventually hit but I'm onto the next setup............ Masterrmind...........

--- 帖子 #161 ---
ea is presenting one of the most obvious downtrends among all pairs. longs re justified above 1.52. wish you good luck.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Hi tashkent, Agreed! However, you will note that I applied the 3 long trades from a 'tightish' IB channel which necessitates smaller TP levels based on how I apply the TP Fib levels. Even on a significantly strong down trend as noted on the EA pair one needs to be looking for minor pullbacks and this is when I struck! All 3 trades profitable and as mentioned earlier have all been closed out and as also mentioned I've moved onto other tradeable setups. Note: The 300 level I mention was referring to the 300 Fib level NOT the price level! Good trading, Masterrmind............ :nerd:

Gidday MM , trust ur xmas went well as does 2016 , wonder why ur chart didnt show this IB , mine didnt show ur IB due to broker diff .

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Hi starpro, I hope your xmas went well too! Yes your brokers data was different to mine for the M30 start of day candle. The difference in broker data is just enough to cause an IB star to show on one chart but not on the other! This also implies that results will vary between traders since one trader will open a trade whilst another trader will not. Good trading, Masterrmind...........

Happy holidays dweb my trades are improving with SQC (im studying it slowly)..i would like to suggest since SMA 20 AND 55 are important in your system is to add an alert when both crosses over i thing is gonna add better value to your system .....and that's for sure when you have time . with all respect

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Compliments for the New Year Huss70, QSC is undergoing some changes to be released and hopefully helpful soon. MA55 is now optional MA20 is essential ito trade psychology and its interaction with the Midline and PA, where the Midline is not in D1 trend guide mode. The MA20/55 cross not needed, but PA inside the channel, Price creates the Channel as well as the MA and everything else for that matter...that where the focus is now... I will update trade rules soon, Howver, suggestions are welcome... dweb

R&amp;D.... Trade observations/actions - in reference to post #196 EU, H1 ++ Confirmations observed at all times. ++ This is an approach to my trading confirmations for the Quantum Super Channel. 1. The "Quantum Super Channel" top and bottom channel lines stayed constant due to PA "attempting to fill it up"...thus if the Red moved down while PA moves up, it means slow-down in momentum. 2. At point (A) the 1st and 2nd hour is used to make a channel (manually drawn on chart = yellow broken lines). The 3rd hour we had a IB. Now we wait for break of IB and "HR 1-2 CHANNEL". 3. Point(B) we had the break upwards. 4. We now have 3 IB channels, inside bar + 2 outside bars...this is where market is testing new highs and lows. The 4th IB is an outside bar which channel is immediately broken upwards, 5. Point(C) reversal attempted, but market wanted none of that and re-established the original trend...up wards Note : Point(D) IB 2,3,4 is where PA spent most of its time thus far and becomes a major area to watch ito S&amp;R, etc. Attached Image ..continued... 6. Point(E) Scalping the IB channel and placed another order at bottom of IB channel (not on chart) 7. Top channel line moved down reflecting the PA slow down or ranging. Attached Image ...closed orders. 7. Point(F) top channel line dropped further soon to touch the Outside Bar at point(E)... Exit: ++ USD news in about 1.5 hours time...enough for today.

just did a carte-blanche test over the weekend on a IB Channel method. No trailstops used, SL needs some work though.

Ideal would be for the white line to exceed zero followed by the line exceeding zero then we have a perfect range, thus it identifies a trend direction change. 3, dweb trend identifier: is an out of the bliss of night idea that evaluates candles and thus tells me when it's safe to trade OR where there is a trend. it does not show direction. 4.

Hi....R&amp;D: I thought of why don't we test methods first without managing them. The TP I made 10 pips and removed the SL, hence the equity lag. the method is not intelligent, not yet anyway...just raw. I called it "dweb midhight idea 1gp", but the name is misleading..."midhight" should actually be "midnight"..lol - my eyes!

H1 had 5 trades, TP = 50pips, zero loss 3. M30 had 4 trades, TP = 50pips, zero loss The main idea for me was to test an insight into PA, but also to take that and try with minimal management to throw into the maze and see what happens. It was also important not to investigate the loss or profit, and did not want update to code to manage the loss...It was more important to see an obsercation exists in a series of data, and to find it without studying the surrounding data. Soon I will need to find an intelligent trail-stopper...if it exists. dweb

R&amp;D: Trading the dwebTalonv2 with Quantum Super Channel overlay-ed with a new approach to seeking highs and lows...or something like that . Same GOLD chart as in post #219. IMHO, Trading the Red (Sell) or Green (Buy) are strong trade positions. However, the dwebTalonv2 certainly holds its own, bringing them together makes it even better, The psychology is this that as long that there is a dot, that's the trend direction. the no-dots areas become your re-consider zones, or whateva it will be in the future. The blue-arrows just where trades could have been taken should I trade the high/low method only...but confluence is key... just my observations though.... Attached Image (click to enlarge) dweb

followup.... 150pip run to the bottom of OB channel complete, and the potential 160pip run from open of 9 March candle to top of OB channel is good reason to smile...Breakout at the top of OB channel will inspire confidence en route to a 160pip run to the nearest resistance level + 90pips beyond that to break free to the estimated 120 price levels.

90 pips area is so important, decision area. depends to breakout so maybe go up test 120 levels again, maybe 110 then 105-106. it looks like bearish to me.

Hey dweb, I tend to only trade the M15 and higher TFs using the IB channel breakout. Stops on the far side of the channel and a 1:1 risk:reward which implies that the TP is always slightly greater than the IB channel width. The closing of an M15/M30/H1/H4/D1/W1 candle will almost always close at a higher price than the upper IB channel (long trade) and a lower price than the lower IB channel (short trade). Since by definition we seek a close of a candle outside the channel although I have come across a few that have closed precisely on the IB channel but this very rare. For HTF entries also consider the fundamentals/sentiment of the market and only trade in the same direction (rather discretionary appraoch) What this system needs is some coder with the time to make either of the following: 1. A dashboard that shows all the IB channel information for multiple pairs (at least 28) visible on only 1 chart because it is a pain having to click through multiple TFs from say M15 through to W1 on a single pair looking for a setup. Then you need to do this for all the other pairs ... very very time consuming although the process is simple enough it is far from efficient! 2. Code an EA with MM and a trailing SL Stops are generally quite wide on higher TF setups for the IB channel approach so the lots sizes need to be relatively low. Take care, Masterrmind...........

Hi simnz, Thanks for your post. IB Channel Width: this gives you an idea of the width of the Inside Bar channel drawn on the screen and mark by a star. knowing the spread of the asset and IB width may be wide enough to place a qiuck scalp of the channel. This gives you an opportunity to setup a buy stop or sell stop or limit orders outside the IB channel, pending the assets you engage with. ROC: rate of change measure the of the time-frame daily open and close prices. a consistent change in a particular direction may help with setting up of orders based on market bias/direction. IB channels provides high probabilities consistently. Bear or Bull bar: direction of current bar and its distance to the Bottom (green) channel line or Top (red) channel line. This also helps to determine if there is enough space left i.t.o. spread and pips to place an add-on order. Distance from open: positive , ie. price above the open - buy bias, and price belowthe open - sell bias. Today Range: gap between High and Low of the daily candle. Gives the width ito pips for the day. Increasing number = high volatility, etc Looking at your pic: price re-entered the channel. This an indication of failed break attempt, with now a higher probaility of direction/bias = sell. Plac a sell stop below the bottom channel.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Both you and Mastermind are doing wonderful work for traders. Since last one year I have been making money from averaging positions by slicing one position into four and trading at 150 pips gap for GBPJPY for longer cycle trades and reducing breakevens. If you have any strategy for equal position grid trading, please do share. Thank you again for your taking out time to explain.

Hi dweb, Could you please explain more about IB Channel? How to detect it and use it for averaging purpose? Mastermind has suggested Confluence as a good point to decide about averaging. I am using arbitrary distance of 150 pips to average as I don't want to use my equity for too many positions and suffer in case an adverse Blackswan kind of event happens. From Mastermind I have learned to use equity drawdown threshold as Stoploss in case the averaged positions don't help in reducing breakevens. I use Interactive Brokers platform for trading and use MT4 only for trade setup idea. Have not made any system as such but have a rough idea as to what to do. I am now trying to set up a system mainly for free teaching of retirees and university students (supported by parents with enough savings) to trade on CME market both fx futures and fx future options (low ask/bid spreads and no interest to pay to brokers). Without enough raw material of money, I feel fx trading business will not grow. But I am keenly watching Mastermind's plan to grow trade from a small account because he is setting up metrics any business operator should have. I admire the simple way you analyse. Using indicators mostly for trades entry, continuation and exit estimation. Statistics produced do the analysis. All in one simple chart.

Hi simnz, Hope you are well. Chart TF: H1 How to detect it: IB Channel: When using the QSC and a IB is identified, the channel is drawn on the screen in default color: Magenta. You have a choice or preference to which type of order suites your trading the best, ito planning etc. looking the pic below once can see how price behaved around the the IB channel. Attached Image ++ false break to the bottom ++ break out to the top and continuing...as I am typing this (lol) use it for averaging purpose?: ++ BUY/SELL orders (order type is up to you) placed where IB Channel are formed. Not that these can take some time to form breakout. in the pic the previous IB channels at bottom (not marked in pic) is about 80 pips away. I feel fx trading business will not grow: ++ this is dependent on your style, and understanding of the asset(s) you are trading, etc. However, options/binaries are attractive. Commodities/Stocks, as is now my primary focus as it suites me best (spycho, etc). Fx market is used partly to understand potential moves. indicators mostly for trades entry: ++ I have been doing R&amp;D on entry for over 12 months now with considerable improvements. Indicators form only part of the idea, like Masterrmind said - confluence (this is where all the tools, ideas, whatever makes you decide to enter or exit comes together.) "Exits" has been an idea I have been working on for some time, and my philosophy is the "Exit" (locks profits) is more important than "Entry". All in one simple chart. How would you analyse the market using just this FREE tool finviz forex performance online?: ++ I may be able to but won't as it is not what I am used to, or fits my way of thinking about assets. I have been through the mill, and like the dust in the air, settled on what fits me the best....now I am close to only trading "the best fit for me" style, instead of every signal. PS : The best learning is I have gained over this time is that when a " RULE BREAKS, GET ANOTHER OR WAIT UNTIL IT WORKS AGAIN ", and will also limit losses. Leave the faith at home, and watch the price action. ================ Few hours later: see a new IB Channel formed.... (this pic take after post #322 below) Attached Image

Thank you very much for your guidelines and the chart. I think you have developed a fabulous trading pad - simple yet efficient doing away the need for having so many different indicators. I am basically a directionless futures options trader. I trade CME currency futures and not spot fx. Because of options trading experience, I rely mostly on risk and money management to make profits. I don't use stop-loss at all. So far it's working though it requires buffer margin before getting into trades. Unlike those aiming at trending trades I trade mainly on (a) momentum acceleration scalping - short cycle - a play on currencies correlation and strength and weakness (b) If scalping trades end up in drawdown, then use it as long cycle trade and exit by averaging. (c) Futures options as a last-resort stoploss for EurUSD symbol. (d) Now looking for last-resort stoploss for GBPJPY (CME options are not available) as drawdown so far has been manageable by averaging but it is not safe. Returns are lucrative though. If I don't find a satisfactory solution, I will shift to other currencies whose mean-reversion patterns can be estimated and averaging can work. Those using MT4 platform and trading like me doing cost averaging based on fixed pips may find the attached indicator useful as a risk mitigating tool.

Welcome and Thanks jaguar1637 for the visit, Yes it repaints last bar, thus affecting the Midline and Top or Bottom channel line in whichever way price moves that moment, thus changing the landscape of the channel. The idea was to try understand if there was a "hidden message" in the channel due to price action, capture it, and trade it effectively..still busy with it - one pice at a time i guess. . I have picked up so many ideas from traders and developers here of FF and yourself, that its hard to keep track of what I - currently reading books suggested by yourself to shape out trading endeavours. I used the Quantum indicator understanding and code as a start...then changed/combined/modified ideas in it. Please have a look at the following pics.

well, well Are you looking too for the Holy grail by guessing the equilibrium point ? ^^ First : ok, I wrote something you could see about volume it's a try , may be it could be a good help when there is a crossing of the two lines Secondly : regarding the repainting, there is an option =&gt; to apply a causal regression on prices, which means results won't be affect by new bars and new market prices I wrote the inverse of Hodrick prescott, it's a damned algo, it could help you to stabilize this indy

Hi, I've been following your thread for quite a while now, looks like you're making progress with every passing day. I have a question regarding the inside bar indicator, I've downloaded one from the first page but it looks nothing like yours, mainly, it doesn't keep history for me to analyse for later (I'm not in front of my charts most of the time). Could you share your settings for it, please? Also, will it be possible for the indicator to send an email? And what's the meaning of the stars? I must have missed that somewhere along the thread. Thank you and keep up with your progress.

Hi dweb, great work you're doing here Seems you're handling multiple strategies, will read back in the thread Thanks for posting. Best

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Thanks a lot! Are you using the open/close or the low/high for calculating IB? Seems like you're using the open/close price, will you consider adding the high/low option, as well? Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
I am new to your posts. I found the "Trend Up" and "Trend Down" info do not change in my M1 chart when the Red/Green line change. How did it work? Do it relate to a particular period such as H1 or D1. Thanks. Most of all, you discussed for PA, it seemed you ignore most of the volume factor. Right?

--- 帖子 #350 ---
For the QSC, I thought I make some confusions. Did I buy when MA20 cross up the centre line of QSC or buy when breakthough up an IB? Or would work with it both together, independantly? How if it breakthough up an IB when the MA20 was still below the centre line of QSC? How QSC combine work with the "dwebinsidebar" indicator? It seems the dwebinsidebar less sensitive than the QSC and it disabled the IB of QSC? Thanks for your reply.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
to correctly identify the IB the high/low is used only

--- 帖子 #352 ---
1. Thanks for your input. I will review the dwebTalon2 regarding the issue, and post an update should there be a requirement. 2. Volume is not considered At that time the QSC tool dev was halted to ensure ideas are streamlined. I have accumulated much observations and needed to re-stack the code of the QSC - under development. This is also delayed by new things coming, and decided to code seperate indicators to test ideas before QSC implementation.... It appears now there may be quantum leap ito dev work ahead, and I hope for the best. I will release nuggets that may assist fellow FF in their trading in due time. Till then, QSC version 1.06 on post #244 s the last published work, and other related tools are to assist.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Rules: I need to update them, to remove any confusion. I am doing much work around the Midline nowadays and hope to bring clarity to that. Use the MA20 as guide as well as using an MA200ema as guid ito Buy and Sell signals. [see post #342 and prior posts for the ideas]. Note that that price may be higher or lower than the Midline, thus care has to be taken when the trader enters...more later this week ito of the rules.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Hi, Thanks for replying. I'm not near my charts but I saw several IBs that the next candle's H/L exceeded the IB, that's why I though you might be using O/C for the IB. I'll post a screenshot when I am home.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
In the pic below one have to keep in mind that PRICE has crossed the 200ema up/down long before the Midline makes the cross up/down. BUT it brings additional confirmation in a strong trend. The idea then is to use it as trading guide... The line signals is from the dwebMedian2 where the 200ema bias has been added... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Thanks for your reply, your system attracts me because you also gave DAX and NASDAQ examples. They are index which may cause opening gaps. The lower time flame such as M15 works for 200ema should be affected by the daily gap constructing meaningless figures. Would you take special care for them? Looking forwards to your new version at the week. Will the dwebMedian2 replace the dwebTalon2 and insidebar development to be discontinued? Anyway, I trust you will give us a wonderful holy grail. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Gaps: The only special care I take is to trade in the direction of the gaps in some cases... However, every asset reacts more or less different when the gap occurs and how they will treat. For day trading orders are closed, unless I am position setting. ++ DwebTalon2 evolved into version 4, however more work to be done...more soon ++ DwebMedian evolved from the use of MA, but a re cent mathematical coding procedure provided a more robust and tight angles - this not combined yet... ++ The Insidebar, although standalone, is a key feature of the QSC in its current form and will not be removed. The repainting channel is being tightened with key work from jaguar1637, and it is real honour to have him around, and perhaps a surprise or two in store... ++ Holy Grail...eish!

Hi Masterrmind, Good to hear from you. The ideas have great potential. Much still needs to be done still. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) ++ dweb QSC: she looks pretty descent on white...lol. ++ dwebMean: is there somewhere...not visible due start of new day ++ dwebPevo: The arrows are from the dwebPevo tool - used to Id cycle starts and finishes..not really a buy/sell tool. It it contains methods just to good to be true. ++ dwebInverse: Old tool that I refreshed into a histogram and now gives a better guide on what price is up to. It would be great If I get the time to include price convergence/divergence as well. ++ dwebInefficiency: this baby is real something....lots of work here still left ito ideas. I also converted it to histogram and now MTF past week. must be tested though to know hw it needs to be traded.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Hi simnz. Which commodities are you trading? The dwebSwing is/was a test idea developed around Stocks, commodities, metals like wheat etc. However, not all were studied/tested. it also does not require user intervention ito period/lookback/distance settings...its is derived, hence creates a problem when applied to Forex for example - really weird!!! I need to rest my mind around this tool. Thanks for the interest. dweb

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Yes I especially like the inverse and the inefficiencies. Very interesting concept. Masterrmind...........

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Those two look good...testing is time consuming though... Here are two new tools that will be added to soon to the team, and perhaps combined: ++ dwebmimTrend: shows the lines on Chart. The idea here is to trade where the lines merge. ++ dweb_???( no name yet ): shows the arrows...The idea here is cycles. dwebPevo: shows all three methods in play (stochastic, macd, rsi)...highly experimental at this stage...it has potential. Both are work in progress. M1 Chart Attached Image (click to enlarge) M30 chart Attached Image (click to enlarge) dweb

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Yes and the areas of uncertainty with merging lines of probability. Now you are really onto something. Keep it going and post up the new indicators in your own good time as I for one want to merge these ideas with my take on Quantum. ps. the Stoch, MACD and RSI don't interest me but they might interest others. Masterrmind...........

--- 帖子 #382 ---
hi, nice work. i am following

--- 帖子 #383 ---
dweb, Gold, silver, copper, soyabean and timbre is on my mind. I haven't traded for more than 20 years now. I am getting tempted seeing your user-friendly indicators. Your use of histogram is a good idea. I extensively use a stack of 9 MA histograms to trade pullbacks, retracements and bounceback timing with correlation strength and weakness using super quantum and donchan fibo as the two indicators on the main chart and making decisions based on histogram movements. velocity indicator is also used by me as I am mostly scalping. My weakness is the money management part. I hope Mastermind gives me some plan for money management.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Thanks for the question Bomi. In hindsight one can say its easy to see the gaps, hence why patience is required before launching the trade. On the chart I have made the one setting M15 to view the price movement better. The other setting: H4. One can now clearly see how "clean" gaps are developing and price is better reflected using the M15 setting or lower depending on trading style, and time frame you trade in. Also note that the Bar Chart seting is part of the template, thus price colours is from the indicator.

Hi Dweb, stumbled across your thread here as someone published your indicator in another forum. It's a valuable idea and great for trading retracements and even S/R. I have a small request though. The indicator does not allow to change the width i.e. I'd like to set it to 5 to get a coloured area not lines but when changing TF it switches back to 2. I know the reason but as I don't have the code, I can't change it. Setting the width to 10 would even be better as it could be used with standard width candles too. The most convenient solution would be to have an extern int ...width" in the Parameter window and one can choose the setting as he likes. Again. I applaud your idea. Good job! Thank you for making it available.

Hi, it looks like it could be a useful tool to help identify interesting zones depending on the many configurations that it can cover along with the various t/fs...well done. I had a little play with it today to see what it could do with my own settings and the EG m5 basic chart attached seems to indicate a hot zone is present to buy soon I feel, somewhere in the box I've drawn. I don't normally trade off lower t/fs tbh but I'll be checking this out Monday to see whether it pans out. LL Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi dweb .... Hope your trading is shooting the stars .. thanks to you i think a lot of people is doing nicely today. Really appreciate it. Just a question. What does 50% DN at the top right hand screen means ?

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Thanks for the kind comments dextroze, That comes from the dwebMA-Median (available on Post #1)...Its still in draft mode - sort unfinished work. The basic idea is that if the trend status is down it will show "Trend DN", if trend starts to change it will "75% Trend DN", then "50% Trend DN", "25% Trend DN" and then "Trend UP".

hi rplust, can u share your template, please. Thank you

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Not the same set-up as yours but I also agree that higher settings as you have noticed is better imo. I'm still developing my optimum usage of the tool at present and how/if I can gain maximum advantage from it when coupled with other tools I use. The h1 chart attached illustrates a live entry I've made a couple of hours ago with only the price trend indication shown for clarity to avoid confusion. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #506 ---
I agree with the higher time-frame setting. It is a tool with great potential that will assist in making trading decisions in conjunction with other tools traders are using. Here we are just looking for that high probability zones, so to speak. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Hi, not to disappoint you, but I don't have really anything to share. Both Indicators QauntumSuperChannel and Price Trend are on page one. Regarding the SR Indicator. I belief that the thread here should be used for developing the idea of dweb, thus I'm not going to post other indicators. But there are plenty of that kind to download. Just Google SupportResistance. Set the Zone Factor to 0.50. That gives better results. I just use that for a quick overview. I usually draw major lines by myself using D1.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
There are a 1000 ways to trade of course. I don't trade the Euro/Pound. But if you don't mind (just my 3 Cents, no critic), here is the chart how I see it for illustration purpose. My concern is always to identify S/D levels and trade with the flow, not against it. Thus, following my H1 chart, I'd only trade shorts. And for entries I always get down to M5 or even M1. And I love simple chart settings that boost my confidence. Trading should be fun, no guessing,nail biting and praying..... Have fun! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I don't believe I have cracked the wip, but with more research and fellow members input this tool can become quite useful for others in their strategies.

To what assets are you applying the indicator? Every Asset has a "unique" rhythm (volatility), and not knowing how it beats will make it difficult to trade.

Hell dweb and rplust, Thank you both for your reply, I am applying the indicator to all currency pairs. I will post post some screen shots in the future. Regarding the gap, at what stage should the trade be triggered ?. Should I enter only the the first sign of the gap between the two different settings of the indicator ? dweb, are the templates you have posted for scalping and not for day,swing, long term trading. Can you please clarify this. Kind regards Sarju

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Thanks for the reply. The dwebPriceTrend indicator shows a visible gap as price moves up or down against a higher time frame. It should be used within your existing system, However can be used as a stand alone. It is important to note that every trader is different and our perceptions therefore different, thus a "gap" may not be the operative word to use in your case, but rather a way of explaining how the tool will assist in your current trading environment. I should never have tried to "convince" you of a "gap", but it was obviously a cheap shot from on my part. I should understood it myself better and then release it with better explanations. However, rplust is using it as a S&amp;R tool to assist in decision making. Bomi also had an idea around it, but has not yet posted his results. However, It is an individual choice, and I am glad it will or could help someone. If it works, it works, if does not, it does not. I use it as part of a bigger environment to give me better decisions. and allow me to trade less (ultimate goal). Send me what you do, you may email me as well should you not want to share what you do, and then I can see what-is-what. I do not believe that the tool will just fit with current settings all assets, thats why testing to what works is important. Those who shared their info, I really do appreciate. Eventually we all want to know where the best possible points is on a string (of prices) and the losses right there, and move ahead with profits....this is what I am working on. I am here to help...where I can ofcourse. dweb

A friend of mine ask me few days back what influences the price of Silver? The following is what I would have said, if not more: ++ Price movements of other commodities in combination with global demand for these commodities, an “indirect pricing” of production costs . ++ Global and in particular U.S. inflation , often driven by rising money supply. ++ Trade and growth imbalances against the U.S. and the resulting twin deficits, that might culminate in a “fear factor” . ++ Central banks ’ activities like money printing or gold purchases and sales. ++ Real interest rates and in particular the ones in the U.S.: interest rates compared to inflation and wages, that might culminate in “financial repression”. ++ The production/demand/inventory formula in the form of physical demand and supply . I had R&amp;D I had been working on for some months now, and yet not finished. This could be my Thesis LOL... A picture was my best answer/bet to him, and I share the same picture with you.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Thanks for the question, dextroze. I wish I could say that I take fundamentals into account, but I am pure technical based. I tend to look at patterns, and volatility. One should take the last 30 days into account at least - I am still working on this. The objective now is to improve in small increments and have a price movement at least 40%-60% in the targeted levels, up or down. Forecasting has been intriguing me for last 3 years, but I have been slow of the blocks. However, post #563 may change all that as I am bringing my ideas together, health permitting. Your comments welcome.

That's what I like about FF - no one thinks generally alike. I have not looked at Silver post that way. My focus was on something else, however, sliding volatility window(s) is what I am going to look at in near future. and may be a feature or work outside of MT4. Good perception dextroze. I am beginning to like Silver, as it has a better temperament than Gold.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Hey guys, I just joined the forum and would like to start out by contributing to this thread on Quantum Super Channel. I'm currently testing this in a small live account and thought I'd share for those interested. My strategy is rather simple, utilizing the Quantum Super Channel as the basis. TF: 1 Min Pair: Gbp/Nzd Settings: Everything standard with the exception of the "ChGap" being tweaked ChGap : Change from 24 to 1000 Through the years I've started implementing pending orders to help gauge and adjust to market conditions. The Quantum Super Channel indicator is a useful tool in my opinion, and if set large enough (with pending orders to give the market breathing room), they can serve as the cushion or contingency plans needed for the initial trade. To open a position: Wait for a red or green dot to appear, then open the initial trade on the next bar. Next, set two pending orders, each at 100 pips greater. e.g. - If a short trade is entered at 1.73, we would then set the first pending order at 1.74 (100 pips higher than initial trade) and then the second pending order 100 pips higher than the first pending order. This allows breathing room for the market as mentioned earlier, and between this and the "indication" of the general direction supplied by the trend the Quantum Super Channel Indicator, a trader should be able to make some decent and consistent pips. Best Case Scenario: The initial trade never goes into 100 pips draw down, the trade is closed in profit, resulting in a reversal trade/opposite direction. Worst Case Scenario: Both pending orders are opened due to draw down, the second pending order covers most of the loss. Possibly break even or profit along with the first pending order. The initial and possibly the first pending order would result in a loss. I trade the Gbp/Nzd because of the movement and potential profit. IMPORTANT: As any experienced trader will stress, money management is a MUST. Especially when trading with pending orders and the expectation of drawdown from market fluctuation. I hope my current manual strategy helps fellow traders and if you have any questions or suggestions, I'm more than happy to answer them/hear them.

Thanks dweb. But I do not understand your intention. Why do you display but lots seems to be secret?

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Hi kofix11 Good question. When I started I wanted to share with the world, but soon realised its difficult as a new comer to persuade people to think of the market different, and that really began my work as it stands today. It is not a secret, but not going to share what I have built. The dwebTWT is one where I shared my thought and it had some fanfare, but no consistent participation to make it better. It is now much better and will be included into some of the tools I am still working on, especially SQC. I may not be answering your question, but its better left that way. You are welcome to PM. I would not like to make it a discussion point here. dweb

Hello, I am not knowledgeable, but came across the Quantum Super Channel 1.08 and found it to be extremely useful in my binary trading, it seems to draw the line below the candle at which the price turns. I use it only on the 5M chart. I do not need anything but the channel lines No inside candle etc required at all for my purpose. However, it continues to give me signals when the candle is no where near the upper or lower channel line. Could you, or someone help me to achieve what I want, this is channels only and when the price turns and it draws the next section onto the channel line I need to get a signal Appended hereto are a few screen drops which may help my explanation. I aam not the best author. I thank you Regards Hans

Hello Dweb, Can can you help me please? I have downloaded the I down loaded the Quantum Super Channel the channels are ideal for my purpose, I trade Binary options, but do have an Alpari demo trading account also and have traded Forex for many years. I use the Tech Anal to provide binary signals. Can you alter the QSC v1.08 alter to show only the lines giving only a signal when it hits the bottom ot top of the channel. As yot can see from the screen drop the ball signal is all over the place, neither do I need the IB signals. If you do not have the time could you talk to someone who can? Or give me the info? I only have the ex4 file Thank you Hans

--- 帖子 #656 ---
I will try as best I can: ++ Set "IB_On" to "False" ++ Set "ShowChannel" to "False"

Dear dweb, i have been following your this thread for a while now, but only now I am starting to experiment with your superChannel indi, and it look pretty impressive. would you be able to provide some literature to understand its functioning. I tried to work with the High and Low depth but the arrow up and down seems not to move at all, i overlapped one indi with 1250 value for high/low, and another with 100. I could not see any difference? Could you also post a complete icustom call to set all the param pls? Thanks for the good work

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Hi fabio.g, v1.09: To override the channel behaviour, set the following SuperChannel = True ( Default - False . In prior versions was to False where you want to change channel behaviour ) chGap: 1250 Manipulate the HighDepth/LowDepth to the line touch signals where you want them iCustom: I was thinking about it as I have to clean code a bit to do this. I will let you know when done.
