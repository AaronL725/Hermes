Hello guys

Here some simple rules - nothing fancy

Here we go

1)Pull up 5 minutes charts in your favorite -flavored pair.

2) observe the market INSIDE THE BOX - screw the trend. You need to pay attention on where the market is heading inside the box. Stay tight to your system.

3) Once the box period is over, check 'n see if there's a breakout

4) if breakout occurs, wait for a pullback. Meanwhile, take a note(or draw an horizontal line as I show on the charts) of the PRICE at the last higher/high - lower low before the breakout - let's say the last high/low happened @ 1.3950 and then the market began to retrace form there, take a note of that and place a limit around 1.3953(if long) or 1.3947(if short)

5). Place a stop-loss at the other side of the breakout candle or at a reasonable distance to let the trade works its way - 20 pips is reasonable in my opinion.

6)Place a Take Profit at least 1:1 risk /reward (assuming 20 pips stop loss/20 pips profit target)

7)sit back and let the market do it's thing

8) wash, rinse and repeat everyday

If you get stopped out, look for the other side of the box and play the market. If nothing happens...I have a secret...come closer...shhhh don't tell anyone but

tomorrow is another day~~~~

here's a chart pretty much self-explanatory

Cheers

NOMORETOXIC

Whats your opinion of my trades made today, see charts.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Dear M69,

What were your TPs?

Thanks,

Lenoxer

--- 帖子 #5 ---
are you entering at the retracement???

--- 帖子 #6 ---
I go for atleast 20 pips.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Waiting for clean retracement below the high of the box then entering on the break again of the high.

It might not be perfect but I think its a solid entry. The retracements I am working on.

Like minimum number of candles?

Or fibs?

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Hello,

Could you say what size the box should be or the times for the box. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
ok just to be sure

your charts look nice

just keep it simple..

I personally look for a fixed number of pips. Normally if the stop loss is 20 pips, I shoot for 20 pips profit target..It all depends.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
I use London session. My box is from 1:30 AM EST to 3:30 AM EST.. not a hard and fast rule. You can play around with it.

NY session, I use 7:00AM EST to 9:00 AM EST

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Very simple!! Like this method alot!!

--- 帖子 #12 ---
NoMoretoxic - Did you have a successful trade this morning during the NY session on the Eur/Usd pair? If so, could you please post a chart?

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
I didn't trade the NY session this morning

But as I looked on the charts, looks like I could be stopped out

cheers

--- 帖子 #14 ---
well, there's a thin line here

as I look up 9:00 AM candle, there's a chance I could get 20 pips off that.

If I got stopped, well like I said, there's another day tomorrow.

part f the game

cheers

--- 帖子 #15 ---
I understand...thank you for your reply.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Hi Nomoretoxic, thanks for sharing.

Could you attach the indicator as well?

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Hi nomo,  It will be better to either post a template or indicator and other necessary details here so as not to make people to start going to the other brother or sister thread and get confuse at the end. So let there be concentration here, it is either u are here or there and not to miss things up. Hope my message is clear kind of nomoretoxic. Thanks.  Nerry.

Can I assume you meant EDT and not EST?

--- 帖子 #22 ---
I am sitting here watching NY session

no trades so far

it's very important to see what's happening inside the box

the market has bounced both sides of the box. Now seems like is coming back to the south side.

You just sit on your hands and have a cup of coffee or something. Let this baby come to you.

Don't make the big mistake of having a bias(long of short) or look at the trend...as you see, the London session trend has become irrelevant.

We don't know what's going to happen next...maybe we're in a range due FMOC announcement.......I sincerely don't know

you know....I don't care either.

Play your game...stay focus

If you lose...deal with it...if you win, close your charts and wait for tomorrow.

trading is emotionless...is just a job you do

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Bobcat2,

Yes, here in NY we are still on Daylight Savings Time - therefore- EDT.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Picture perfect break out, retrace and price continuation. Out with positive pips on the Euro and GBP this morning. You Da Man NoMo!

--- 帖子 #25 ---
I don't know about you guys, but this is 20 pips in my book......unless I am wrong please don't hesitate to correct me!!

there's you have

Moving averages used = 0

oscillators used = 0

how many time frames = 1

how many guppy's used = 0

how many correlations used = 0

bollinger bands - none

pivot points - 0

welcome to stress-free trading

cheers

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Nomoretoxic,

Man, I'll tell you, I couldn't agree more with you.  I've finally removed everything off my charts enabling me to finally see just what the hell is going on.  You're 100% correct - stress free trading.  Thanks

--- 帖子 #27 ---
hi nomoretoxic!

20 pips on gbpusd! thank you!

but stopped out on eurusd. did I have my stop in the right place ?

entry at 38, stop at 58 at top of candle with arrow at 10:35 EDT.

thanks a million,

Alexandra

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Hi nomo,  Indeed self explanatory. Pls keep it up and more of such chart. Thanks.  Nerry.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
ouch Alex!!!!!  I really don't know

Try this indicator to see if it works for you better

Man, I havent' look at  EUR/USD today

I am going to check it's charts to se what happened

brb

Alex

here you go

look at the charts

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Guys

you don't have to trade many pairs......

Take one you like and go for it

I like cable, but Euro is fine!!!

believe it or not sometimes I go like "minnie minnie mo" stuff...between euro and cable...Aussie is good...swissy is good too.....

seriously don't laugh at me please!!!!! (I am laughing at myself here LOL)

The least I like is the yen.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hi Nomo,

Thanks for sharing your method

How many pips after a 2nd breakout do you take your position on the cable.  My spread is 4 pips with IBFX, would you do 9 pips above break out (5pips + 4 pip spread) ?

thx

--- 帖子 #33 ---
about taking profit, that's pretty much up to the trader.

I am happy with 20 pips a day...sometimes I make more but that's pretty much discretionary.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
I trade London session, sometimes I trade NY but very seldom

Doesn't matter how you use the box...the idea is to be able to mark periods of consolidation and to be in line when the breakout occurs

not a hard and fast rule.

welcome to the club!!!

cheers

--- 帖子 #35 ---
sorry, I worded my question wrong.  After the second breakout occurs, when do you enter ? how many pips above the first breakout do you place your position ? (also please let me know if that number of pips includes your spread)

thx

--- 帖子 #36 ---
about 2-3 pips

no, I don't include the spread

I use Oanda for entry - fairly low spread

cheers

--- 帖子 #37 ---
thanks for the quick response

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Hi NMT,

Just wanted to say a big thank you for starting this new thread and sharing your trading style. I hope we all will remain focussed and keep the thread updated in a positive manner

--- 帖子 #39 ---
you welcome!

--- 帖子 #40 ---
on that eurusd I did have my stop in the wrong place.

got it now....

alex

--- 帖子 #41 ---
no problem!!!

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Nomoretoxic,

Thanks again for re-energizing the breakout thread and making things simply again.

I'm using a modified version of the newyork.mq4 indicator from the old thread but wanted to try your posted but I'm having trouble. The file is an exe and to load/ compile the indicator in Metaeditor it has to end with mq4. Can you re-post it or send it to me please?

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
May I have your attention please!!!!!

Listen, I notice that today we had a good day with this system.

Everything is all rosy......yeepie!!!

well, see like I always say, tomorrow it's another day. I can't guarantee we will win.....

The trick here is not based on winning or losing..

trading is about keep the ball rolling.

Just my humble advice is...stop looking for systems like a beheaded chicken!!! just look around, how many people outhere bouncing off from system to system like a monkey on a tree

see, either if you choose to use this box as your system or whatever you choose...stick to it like a gum in a shoe!!

You will lose my friend...there's no way to get around it!!!! but in time you'll be ahead.

cheers

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Hey nomoretoxic

just curious what you do for mm management.....

traditional 2% - 5% of account balance per trade?

--- 帖子 #45 ---
yeah...pretty much

I use the box with some other stuff ...all price based. Help me keep money management on check among other things.

In my opinion just with the box alone you'll be fine.

cheers

--- 帖子 #46 ---
oh man...sorry to hear that

Only have the .exe file

ask this guy, Ronald Raygun he should have what you're looking for.

he is a very nice guy I am sure he will lend you a hand

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Thanks for your responses to the many questions asked of you on your system.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
no problems buddy!!!

ok...to me everything is about price. If the market breaks the box even for 1 pip, to me, there's an intention of breaking that level AKA price...good enough for me.

still wait for a pullback - that's the only confirmation I will ever need.

about scaling out of a position, I don't do it. Looks good on theory but in reality doesn't work....talking form experience here.

I go all in and if I lose, so be it..

hope it helps

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Thanks.... i pretty much do the same..... i use 2-5% as a do not exceed number and then I follow the box....

--- 帖子 #50 ---
I adjust the number of lots if exceeds 20 pips.

the 20 pip rule, I heard that a lot.

It's good just that I won't limit myself on a trade if the stop-loss is passing 20 pips.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Nomo, does the 5 minute bar have to close out of the box or is it good enough

if the bar just breaks the high/low of the box?

--- 帖子 #52 ---
How do u determine the points to draw to get the fib level on 5M Chart. What are the pairs u trade for U.K session?  Thanks.  Nerry.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
the price has to close outside the box

Everything must be done at the close

cheers

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Nomo..

I like the simplicity of your system and the way you thoroughly explain it.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
thank you

always happy to help

--- 帖子 #56 ---
No fibs? No moving averages? No pivot points? No CCIs? No indicators? No Ouiji board? YIKES!! What am I gonna do with my rainbow charts?

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Great system  Nomoretoxic !!!

What if there is no retracement at all? No pullback? I understand after the first breakout,instead entering you wait for a pullback..How long do u wait for this? What determines your entry point in such a case??

--- 帖子 #58 ---
mmm sell them on ebay??

LOL

Cheers

--- 帖子 #59 ---
no pullback - no trade. It's important to follow the system to the core

once in a while you'll miss the bus. It's ok

I'll wait until 2:00 PM EST if is necessary. After that not worth the wait.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Firstly, thanks for sharing with us your system. Although I'm extremely new to FX(just started a demo after about a month of reading about it) I have traded the local Australian stock exchange for the past 10 years. When i say 'traded' i should really say 'invested' as I wasn't overly active in buying and selling. I was more building a portfolio for myself. Obviously FX is gigantic leap from share trading.

I had to get that out of the way so you see where I'm coming from when i ask very stupid questions like i have below.

I have more stupid questions about the pullback as well but I'll take it one step at a time for the moment. Thanks again for sharing your knowledge.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Hi Nomoretoxic- thanks for posting your system here- the simple systems are always the best!

If I follow your strategy correctly you wait for a break out of the high of the "box" with the breakout candle closing above/below the line and then wait for a pullback.

Does the pullback have to pullback inside the box to be valid or if there is a sharp move up followed by a down candle outside the box does this constitute a valid move signalling an entry?

many thanks

Mark

--- 帖子 #62 ---
The trend is just a long cold sustained myth. I don't have any use for the trend using 5 minutes charts. Trend trading is more effective on longer range trading, but here it's all noise.

The trend will keep you on your toes. Trust me, I've been there.

The trend is just another crutch, along with moving averages, multiple timeframes....all of it will lead you to second guessing, which is the #1 (numero uno) reason why so many people have no consistency on trading.

I stay focus on my system. I bring no bias whatsoever. I look on the charts and if it's no there, I will just sit on my hands. Once I spot a possible trade (pullback) , I place my limit , stop-loss and that's all I can do.

Welcome by the way

oh, yes the box is two hours long

Cheers

--- 帖子 #63 ---
OK Mark. A very good question

the pullback could be either inside the box or outside, doesn't matter.

Doesn't matter how long the pullback takes.

hope it helps

--- 帖子 #64 ---
nomoretoxic

did you take any trades during the early london session today?

RR -

--- 帖子 #65 ---
no box trades for me.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Nomero!!

Are you using any offsets for your box? If yes how many?

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Default = 5

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Did I do this right. I got stopped out. I entered short on u/j at 104.99 with a sl of 105.31 (the high of the breakout candle). I know they cant all be winners. Just curious if I did it right.  Thanks.

False breakout - EUR/USD 9-17-2008

believe me it's better to have patience and keep your money in your pocket

don't you agree??

cheers

--- 帖子 #70 ---
I agree.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
You did it right

but you know, I really don't like USD/JPY for the box.

I found out it moves erratically most of the time (and not enough juice!!)

As for long ranges  the yen works good...or maybe for hyper-scalping.

sorry man!!!!

but you know, that's how it is

sometimes you win - sometimes you lose

Just shake it off and keep running

Cheers

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Missed usd/cad. Looks like a beautiful chart!

Thanks for the quick reply NMT

As my little league baseball coach use to tell us (40 years ago), rub some dirt on it and shake it off

--- 帖子 #74 ---
I will post this charts again

People, please take a look on how the market bounced off each side of the box.

There you have it...the trend is useless.....

Trade simple......throw the crutches away.....

Did you enter this trade?

I waiting on Swissy and Pound now.

oh well....better luck next time for all of us LOL

This was a nice breakout/retrace. Wish I was paying attention at thhttp://www.forexfactory.com/C:%5CUse...p%5Cusdcad.gife time!

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Not on the EUR/JPY because of its past results when traded as a straight breakout.

The aud/usd was just a test and it worked ( NO ONE MUST DO THIS, IT WAS A FLAT-OUT GAMBLE !!!!!). I am using a demo, as I am forward testing this system before using it live so I gambled on the Aussie.

The EUR/JPY was intentional as I am leaning toward trading it in this manner.

However, USE NOMO'S PULLBACK. I use it on every pair with EUR/JPY being a slight exception, still indecisive.

Disclaimer: DO NOT CHANGE NOMO'S METHOD FOR ANY PAIR !!! He is trading for a living and has been sustaining himself from trading so HE knows best.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
I just got killed on Swissy.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
yaaaay for pound!

Northbound to the London High. I just got my 20 pips.

Thanks Nomo.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
cool

I am distracted today...LOL

well....I made my day but honestly I haven't paid much attention to the box today!!!

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Nomo,assume a short trade, does the pullback bar have to close above the breakout bars close or just have some part of the pullback bar be higher while the bar is forming?

+27 pips EUR/USD

--- 帖子 #87 ---
+ 20 pips GBPUSD

--- 帖子 #88 ---
ok excellent question

in my experience, a bar that closes higher (at the opposite direction) will give you better odds..

but

you take any pullback....don't leave money on the table.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Following the rules of this strategy as defined so far, can someone please explain to me how you could make +20 pips (let alone +27) on EURUSD during the NY session?

--- 帖子 #90 ---
here's a lits of trading crutches

1) moving averages has to crossover

2) the bollinger bands are narrow

3) time frames doesn't match

4) the trend is up/down/sideways

5)the oscillators are  oversold/overbought (the market won't care trust me)

6) the price is above/below the moving average

7) EUR/USD and EUR/JPY are correlated/uncorrelated

8) there's a doji/dragonfly formed

9) The market is on the .618% line (oh boy you have no idea how much I hate this one)

10) momentum has slow down

I guess the list goes on..

Ladies and gent's......the markets are not about charts

THE MARKETS ARE ABOUT PRICE

Like my mentor use to say - don't patronize anything on the charts...not even the box.

The box is just a guide...that's it...the box won't trade for you.

be free of all crutches!!!!!!

welcome to stress-free trading

cheers

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Hi Nomo,

Regarding EURUSD, there was a false breakout identified by your first arrow. Once the market retraced, shouldnt you have entered short after that first breakout bar'slow was taken out? Looks like you waited for another mini retrace to happen before you entered the trade. I'm little bit confused. Please help me.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
I have to go my friends...long day here...need some rest

take care...see ya soon

cheers

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Cheelu - You are not alone my friend, something is a little off with this trade.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
i got stopped out on eurusd too

--- 帖子 #95 ---
In NY session ? what was your stop SL and TP ??

--- 帖子 #96 ---
breakout candle was at 9:20 candle with a low of 52

entry was at 9:30 candle at 49

stop was at top of breakout candle at 79

--- 帖子 #97 ---
please let me know if you see a mistake

--- 帖子 #98 ---
I see how you made your trade. Good job! Looks like each person might be using a different variety of strategy criteria. Nomoretoxic stated this additional criteria that you did not use:

Post #67

-----------

Q: Are you using any offsets for your box? If yes how many?

A: default = 5

Post #53

-----------

Q: Nomo, does the 5 minute bar have to close out of the box or is it good enough if the bar just breaks the high/low of the box?

A: The price has to close outside the box. Everything must be done at the close

I don't understand how the chart in Post #85 could have resulted in 20 pips gain with a 1:1 RR ratio.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
pipping - This was not addressed to you, it was addressed to iflyhigh72. To get +27 pips out of this setup, the entry must have been after the big pullback.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
I use this strategy in conjunction with the "7am-9am Big Dog Method". Mainly NOMORETOXIC's pullback method is needed and has proved valuable to me already..... Also, like simplifying this FOREX game. Makes it easier to trade, sometimes anyway. Here were my results today:

AUD/USD +40

USD/CHF -10 (stopped out, but should have applied another entry order..would have made alot of Pips)

EUR/USD +40

USD/JPY -20 (Got burned on the pullback at 14:45..should've had another entry order and would have made some nice pips)

+50 for the Day.

My Question for NoMoreToxic is...in the case of USD/JPY and USD/CHF...should I or do you apply another entry order for your top and bottom lines?

Good Things

--- 帖子 #101 ---
thank you zznbrm!

I see now about the close of the candle.

Sorry for the dumb question, but could someone please tell me what an offset is?

alex

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Guys

sorry for my late reply. I had a much needed rest

About the trade this morning, I did got  20 pips. Actually the market went down 21 pips before reversing.  I am using OANDA for execution and there's difference on price. I notice on Admiral Markets and Interbank that the market didn't quite reach 20 pips

Anyway if you got stopped out, as I said before , look at the other side of the box

here's some charts to prove it

I apologize if there's any misunderstanding

cheers

--- 帖子 #103 ---
I don't like USD/JPY at least for the box.

As for USD/CHF I am not interested on this pair at all. Not because is bad for trading or anything, it's just an habit

But I do think that the swissy is an excellent pair.

About applying another entry order, my suggestion is to stick to your system. My success in trading is to stay truthful to my system and don't change it no matter what.

I am always happy to help

Cheers

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Ok

about the box settings

The only thing I change is the time.

that's it

I don't mess around with offsets or anything like that

--- 帖子 #105 ---
hi nomo

zznbrm straightened me out on the fact that the breakout candle must actually close outside of the box (?)

but what about the entry candle, do you wait for it to close too?

thanks again

alex

--- 帖子 #106 ---
no, once I see a pullback materialized I place my limits.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
nomo,

you are one patient guy.  bless you.

meanwhile,  my husband wants to know if this can be traded on the Asian session?

alex

--- 帖子 #108 ---
well, Asia session is somehow slow.

You could try it to see if it works. I never care about that session , but who knows??? maybe your husband could get something out of it.

let us know

no problem, happy to help...thanks

--- 帖子 #109 ---
here is one night for what it's worth

20 pips!

alex

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Hmmmm, that is interesting. Something to forward test, for sure.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
there you go Alex

experiment....all the way

--- 帖子 #112 ---
So you entered to the upside later on in the day for the EUR/USD?

Anyone who entered to the downside earlier in the morning had to get stopped out, unless they only wanted like 10 pips.

I suppose u entered the AUD/USD on the Big Dog method (straight breakout, no pulling back).

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Hi nomo

Changing the time can make lots of different in the trading results.

Did you change the time just on the indicator to match your trading strategy?

or

Did you change time on your strategy depending on some observation?

Need to clarify.

Jeff Ng

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Hi Guys,

For those interested in the Asian search for "AHAL" in this forum and google for other forums. Same principle applies.

However don't get too involved with it.

Anyway if you want a similar indicator to the ones here, see this post:

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Did you have any statistics of this system? Have you done any backtest? I just wanna know how profitable is so far. If you have any info about this please share.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Backtesting is one of the most useless thing I ever see in my life, and I tell you,  I have seen many!!! In order to explain why we'll need another thread.

But we can still talk profitability here.

Since I got my eyes opened to price action, I have never had a losing month..period. Some months I make more, some less..

I pay myself monthly. Measuring a system everyday is a huge mistake.

The box is just one(visual) way to see price action.

The box won't make any money for you, just how you interpret price action (pullback and follow-thru) once the market reach either side.

The box has some simple rules I outlined at the first post of this thread

Very simple rules to follow. Will you win every trade? Unfortunately no.

Will you be profitable in a reasonable  period of time?, I have

But I stick to my rules, all the time, no matter what

that's the secret

g/u had a nice move too.  +20 pips for it.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
short G/U at 1.8166. SL 1.8222. Right now working against me, but time will tell.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
You should've shorted earlier imo @1.8194 when g/u broke the low of the candle that originally pierced the box.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
so you didn't wait for a retrace?

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Check out the chart I posted a few posts before.  I use ibfx so the feed might be different than yours, but on ibfx g/u pierced the box earlier, and then retraced.  I entered a little under the low of the pierce after the retracement.

**if you notice g/u pierced both sides of the box

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Any questions?

don't hesitate to ask

--- 帖子 #132 ---
i see it now.....wow i know the data feeds are different but FXCM feed looks entirely different.....

--- 帖子 #133 ---
It's something how different charts will look between brokers.  Here is my ibfx chart for e/u.  I shorted @ 1.4446 with a target of 1.4426 (+20).  It had a much bigger looking retracement than nomo's did.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Yeah, how is the 13:20 GMT candle on EUR/USD considered a pullback when it's low is lower than the breakout candle (13:15 GMT) low?

--- 帖子 #135 ---
guys I use ibfx as well. The 9:30 candle pierced the box. The 9:30 retraced. I entered short GU 3 pips from the low of the piercing candle which was 1.8166. Im a newbie on a demo account. Just trying to learn as much as I can.  Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
I actually got in and got out already - grabbed 15 pips and got out.  I jumped the gun a little based on the rules but with the volitility the way it is...

Nomo. What was your S/L on the Cable this morning. Thanks.

the close...everything must be measured at the close. That candle closed higher than the breakout candle hence the pullback

the pullback candle closed @1.4436. The breakout candle closed @1.4418

Could someone please help me regarding when exactly to enter ?

Assuming short

1) mark the low of the box from 7am - 9am EST

2) 5 pips offset to low of the box (low A)

3) Wait for breakout to happen

4) If market continues lower ,mark down the lowest low ( low B)

5) once retrace happens, should I enter 3 pips below low A or wait till price crosses 3 pips below low B ?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Hello guys

Here some simple rules - nothing fancy

Here we go

1)Pull up 5 minutes charts in your favorite -flavored pair.

2) observe the market INSIDE THE BOX - screw the trend. You need to pay attention on where the market is heading inside the box. Stay tight to your system.

3) Once the box period is over, check 'n see if there's a breakout

4) if breakout occurs, wait for a pullback. Meanwhile, take a note(or draw an horizontal line as I show on the charts) of the PRICE at the last higher/high - lower low before the breakout - let's say the last high/low happened @ 1.3950 and then the market began to retrace form there, take a note of that and place a limit around 1.3953(if long) or 1.3947(if short)

5). Place a stop-loss at the other side of the breakout candle or at a reasonable distance to let the trade works its way - 20 pips is reasonable in my opinion.

6)Place a Take Profit at least 1:1 risk /reward (assuming 20 pips stop loss/20 pips profit target)

7)sit back and let the market do it's thing

8) wash, rinse and repeat everyday

If you get stopped out, look for the other side of the box and play the market. If nothing happens...I have a secret...come closer...shhhh don't tell anyone but

tomorrow is another day~~~~

I brought the rules back to front...just in case

you place a stop limit order....I assume you're talking about market order...that's a no-no...never use a market order at least for the box.

once you see the pullback, you start to look where to place the stop order

guys I need some rest, but still PM or ask...... be back in a few hours

if you see that I don't reply to your question, just ask again.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Nomoretoxic,

I thank you for your efforts. Few questions:

1) In post #30, you show a chart for EURUSD on 9/16. You show a stop loss at the top of the breakout candle. The SL would be roughly 1.4182. The low point before the pullback is roughly 1.4139. So entry would be at 1.4136. One of your rules is : "Place a Take Profit at least 1:1 risk /reward". That would make Take Profit of about 1.4090. You indicate on the chart "20 PIPS HERE". I assume this to mean you would take profit there. That is not even close to 1:1 RR ratio. Why the discrepency?

2) In post #53, you gave the following answer:

Q: Nomo, does the 5 minute bar have to close out of the box or is it good enough if the bar just breaks the high/low of the box?

A: The price has to close outside the box. Everything must be done at the close

However, the charts posted in Post #76 and Post #119 show the breakout candle NOT closing outside the box. Which is the proper definition of a breakout?

3) There is also the outstanding question about the GBPUSD in the NY session this morning. Your chart in Post #138 does indicate "20 PIPS". I assume this means that you actually got 20 pips on this trade. Where are the SL, TP, Entry for this trade to get 20 pips?

If your answer to any question is "I use OandA and the price is different between brokers", then maybe you could post the actual charts you use to make your trading decisions.

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #147 ---
according to the rules the first trade would not have been stopped out.  You would've entered short under the low of the move that pierced the box to the downside.  You would've made some pips.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
yes, but the target profit is 20 pips

--- 帖子 #149 ---
I have to call a big opps on my part.  This morning I used 6am to 8 am est without realizing it.  It worked in my favor though.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
that's great because you should've gotten the 20 pips if the entry was around .8030, which would be around the low of the piercing move.  It wouldn't be according to the rules if you entered at .7954 as the red line on your chart shows.  What price would you have entered at?

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Thanks Scott.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
your welcome, glad to help.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Nomoretoxic,

Chart below exactly per your rules. IBFX broker so exact price may vary slightly. Based on rules, this would have been an iffy trade for me due to the retrace did NOT close inside of box. Plus, my retrace candle was a doji.

Opinions welcome, thks.

Nomo says

any pullback...ultimately what you're looking for is the last price either high or low before the pullback - 2-3 pips away, that will be your entry.

4) if breakout occurs, wait for a pullback.

and I see some other folks make entry at the high/low of the breakout candle .

where's the exact entry?

1) 3 pips above/below the original box's high/low after pullback

2) 3 pipe above/below the highest high / lowest low which hapened AFTER the breakout and BEFORE pullback

3) 3 pipe above/below the breakout candle after pullback

He states also that he use the CLOSE for all candles. So the retrace candle CLOSED inside the breakout candle but NOT inside the box?

My lower low before breakout was #3 @ 1.4435 so then I should place entry 3-5 pips below that @ 1.4430??

My retrace candle was a doji, closed at @1.4433. Above lower low before breakout. Place entry @ 1.4430.

That sound right??

This is so simple but its complicated, Im thinking to much is my problem.

imo a retrace really didn't happen until your point #5.  The retrace does not have to be back into the box.  If you placed your sell stop below point #5 you still would've had a winner.  Stop thinking too much.

OK, here goes again. Breakout at #1, price continues down till #5, next 2 candles are the retrace up. My entry should be a few pips below retrace candle, 1.4390 or so.

Ny box(breach of hi/low of box) by breakout candle.
Watch for retrace(general price retracement), place order using retrace hi/low + a few pips.

Listen

I don't want to sound offensive but before you have a question (which I don't mind asking) take your time and read my posts carefully.... and analyze the charts I posted..calmly, there's no rush..

Somebody asked about risk and reward. Listen, I am just proving that this system delivers AT LEAST 20 pips....if you want to trail the stop or use 2:1 or 3:1 on R/R it's up to you. Most people are content to capture 20 pips consistently on every trade. I also recall talking adjusting the # of lots accordingly to the distance, from your stop loss.

If you risk is 40 pips and goes beyond your load (# of lots invested ) then,  reduce the lots and take advantage of the move.

About stop-loss

I said " use the breakout candle as a guide". I probably had this remark posted in another thread but anyway I'll repeat....breakout candle it's just a guide.

If you place a stop-loss too close to the box line, chances are you're getting stopped out before the trade materializes. Look for a place not too far away from the box-line but sufficient far enough to avoid a shake-out.

Not to be rude or anything but you need top clear off your charts. You need to stop thinking about doji's or counting candles. Make this trading system simple for God's sake.

Just clear off your charts. I have seen people here with charts very much like a Christmas tree. It's your prerogative but I said many times it's not worth it and will only lead you to confusion.

I will said this again - I started to be profitable in my trading the day I cleared off my charts. You guys need to do that if you want to follow my steps.

Stop over thinking. Don't analyze too much...

be like the sniper - one shot - one kill...plain and simple....you either have a trade or you don't

You either win or lose....be happy no matter what

Re-read the rules again and read my post on advice.

And remember...there will be days you will lose...be prepared. There's not a guarantee even using a sensible stop-loss your won't get stopped out... eventually you will.

My nick is nomoretoxic

The reason - no more toxic waste on my charts

cheers

NOMO what was your entry and your S/L on the cable this morning.  It seems that if you had used the high of the breakout candle as an s/l you would have gotten stopped out 4 candles later before it broke down.  Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
I'll go by price - bear in mind I am using Oanda

entry - 1.8178

stop-loss - candle before the breakout 1.8222

exit - 1.8158

my risk and reward was unbalanced but I had plenty of money in my pocket from EUR/USD and cable on London Session - the risk was worth it. My load was light as well.

Besides I monitored the trade very closely as the condition of the cable after my fill was very bad. That's why I put on the charts "rough ride".

Cheers

OK, so I took a break to relax, trading record since monday is  4-4. Working on my sleep habits, not to think to much, no emotion.

Just went thru the rules, charts nice and simple. Starting 9/11, london session thru 9/18, ny session i found the following. Now following rules and just trading price, (9 Wins and 3 NO trades), no losses in 12 available sessions.

9/12 = 75% success rate. No losses, clear 3 NO trades.

20 pips TP, 20 pips SL, PERIOD.

Cool, got it, thanks guys, just follow price.

Hello NOMO and everybody,

Long story short, I stopped trading for about the last 7-8 months due to other things going on in my life and now I am back. You would be surprized at how much one forgets in that amount of time when it comes to trading. I plan to make the best of a fresh start with this trading method and find it refreshing beings how it is so simple.

Now I know it must be posted here somewhere and I missed it but perhaps you could relate some times to me for other market trade times?

NY time is 7 to 9 am est.  or 6 to 8 am cst for myself.

What times using NY time zone are the correct trade times for the other markets like London?

Thanks

Mappollo69 - I think you use InterbankFX, so do I. Here are the results of my test during the same timeframe:

Chart Setup

-------------

Interbank FX - Demo Account

London Box: 0500 - 0700 GMT

NY Box: 1100 - 1300 GMT

TF : M5

Dates: 9/11/2008 - 9/18/2008

ant-GUBreakout_V.0.4 with 5 pip offset

Breakout Candle

---------------

First candle to close outside the box

Pullback

--------

Pullback starts with the first candle after the Breakout Candle to close in the opposite direction from the Breakout candle. So, if the Breakout Candle is SHORT, the Pullback starts with the first LONG candle after the Breakout Candle.

Entry

-----

Note the extreme price attained before the Pullback begins. For a SHORT, this will be the lowest price from the Breakout Candle until the Pullback begins. Once Pullback starts, enter sell stop order 3 pips below the extreme price for short (buy stop order 3 pips above for long).

SL

-----

For this test, -20 pips from the Entry

TP

-----

For this test, +20 pips from the Entry

I ignored Spread for this test.

I find it a little odd that the London box is 0500-0700 GMT since London currently opens at 0700 GMT. So, I also did the test using 0600-0800 GMT for the London Box. Results:

Yup.

As a member noted in her post that her husband was wondering if this method could work between 22:00 and 24:00.

I really think that this method can work anywhere consolidation is spotted at anytime on a 5 min chart. Look at today's charts just before the Asian open, on all majors, EU, GU, AU, Swissy, EJ, they all had tight consolidation maybe 30 or 40 pips then broke. Many times there is consolidation before the Asian session because the US market closes then there is a breather for a couple hours. Sometimes even during the Asian session consolidation takes place then breaks in the London session.If traded exactly as Nomo trades, I am pretty sure it will be successful, just look back at the charts.

Essentially, the method is combining a straight breakout method with a 1-2-3 setup, which is a simple but genius idea. So instead of just entering at a specific price a few pips from a high or low, the 1-2-3 set up filters the bad trades (though 2 false breaks in a row can occur but losing is part of it).

If trading at a specific time suits a trader's personality then good, if u can at anytime when consolidation is spotted then good also.

Thanks again, Nomoretoxic.

The breakout was 65 pips from the offset line and it retrace 4 bars after.

should you void this trade because the breakout gap was too big.

Is there a point after price trades out of the box without retracing that you won't play a retracement?

IE: Let's say e/u trades straight up out of the box, and goes 50 pips up before retracing.  Would you not even look at it at that point or would you still play it........

Will do some small live trades with this next week. Looks like today that many pairs just went straight up without a retrace. The USD/CHF, GBP/USD, EUR/USD. Nomoretoxic, do you use only this system for full time trading?

--- 帖子 #205 ---
I use another stuff. Price based.

Sometimes I combine the two, but the box itself works more often than not.

I use to trade the box using straight out breakouts. But I realized after a while I was getting burned quite a lot. I rather miss the bus and wait for the next one than getting toasted on many trades.

EUR/USD had a nice move but it was late and outside the box. Check the last chart I posted here.

Guys

Probably some of you have noticed that I reply very quickly.

Well, I am in front of the screen 'cause this is what I do. I trade off the screen. My job is right here.

But today is Friday. I deserve some entertainment. Right now is 3:41 PM Eastern Time and there's a lady coming in from work, looking for some entertainment too. So we need to figure out how we can "fix" this situation LOL

Unfortunately, as much as I love to chat with you guys, I need to clear off for a while. But I'll be around tomorrow, Saturday, so don't hesitate to ask me any questions....I will surely check this thread tomorrow.

Congratulations to all of you who make some dough during this week using this system. As for me it's an honor and a pleasure to contribute to your trading...Bear in mind that no matter what you use not all days and weeks will be like this one. Just by hanging in there you will stack odds in your favor. Trust me. Been there done that.

I wish you all a wonderful weekend...

see you guys tomorrow

Here was my GBPUSD trade on Friday. My SL was set to 20. I use a 20 PIP trailing stop once i secure 20 PIPs. Red lines make up the box. I use 7 - 9a for the box, I must have moved it by mistake when making the image.

Any comments would be appreciated. I want to make sure I'm getting a true understanding of the price action here.

Thanks RR -

--- 帖子 #217 ---
It worked for you so thats good. A few things, this was a no trade for me due to a few things.

Closed candle is 9:04.59, your line is drawn at 9:00.00 closed candle.

Your breakout candle is actually your hi of the box.

Your retrace candles happened before the breakout.

Your entry candle is actually your breakout candle.

There was no retracement in the box.

Thats one way.

Another way, wait till that doji by your exit, Place buy a few pips above doji, stop loss 20pip minimum, take profit 20 pips. Could have held this long for a solid +60.

This is another way.

NOMORETOXIC,

Asking your opinion about live trade room. Im thinking a good idea overall. I know all rules are here but LIVE AS IT HAPPENS would be great.

Time willing, effort I would be willing to be there, posting charts as they happen, making money losing money.

Your thread, your decision. Im just greatfull for the info, I went 70% last week, positive pips. I will be trading London and NY Breakout Method daily.

GBP/USD, I was 6-0 will this pair last week, eur/usd and eur/jpy brought down percentage but positive is positive.

Let me know.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Nomo, your system is very similar to Phil Newton's breakout system. He has been trading and teaching his system for several years. Your system is excellent and I thank you for

sharing it with all of us. Check out his system as I think his way might increase the win loss ratio.

Guys

My idea of opening up a thread with a so simple yet still confusing method is for you guys to stop optimizing and/or looking for the"next big thing" and start trading. You need to go back to my posts and have a deep understanding of what I am trying to accomplish with you guys. It's time to stop been like a cat in the headlights and trade like a professional.

No fear. Like a sniper.....one shot...one kill.

As I stated in the first post, there's nothing fancy about these rules. No big deal to follow them.

I said this many times, don't worship the box.

The box is just a guide. That's it. If the pullback and follow thru occurs outside the box, no matter how many candles, you just take it and apply the rules. Please check my last chart. A trade made out outside the box.

Please bear this in mind : the market is unpredictable. After you place an order and have a fill, you're pretty much at the mercy of the market.

I am sorry but I am not going to participate in "this is how I do it" or stuff like that. If you want to make this work you need to follow the rules I already outlined. No matter if you win or lose, that's the way it is.

I am not going to let this thread to be hijacked by that. No way.  Sorry if I sound harsh or rude but I refuse to follow this constant "optimization process" that is a common practice here at FF.  I rather close the thread for good.

You must adhere to the rules. Period. I said many times, if you lose, deal with it. I have losing days. You will have losing days, sometimes 2 or 3 in a row. This is the nature of the markets

I don't change my rules because I lose. I stick to it. Stay disciplined.

Give yourself plenty of time to detox from all of the common practice here and stay put on a clean - fresh chart. If you're new to trading, still give yourself plenty of time to adapt yourself to the system. Take it easy, don't rush things up.

There's always another day and the markets (I swear, honestly ) won't go away...especially forex.

Another thing I got a lot by PM's about backtesting. I will say this once more..out loud

BACKTESTING IS A USELESS TOOL ONLY MADE OUT TO SCREW YOUR HEAD.

Have your ever head this " past results are not guarantee of future results blah blah blah

well that my friend it's entirely true.

As I said before, will take me a new thread to explain why people need to stop looking at the past and start trading what they have front of their noses. A long story that I will not discuss here to maintain the integrity of the thread .

If you want to trade this box , waiting for "comfirmations" (moving averages, a million timeframes in agreement, fibos, pivot points, trends, candlestick formations, etc) be my guest...go for it

not here please

Cheers

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Hi All,

Listen to Nomo he is giving out some very good advise here. I've been trading for 3 years now and by far this is one of the easiest system to learn and understand. I have just picked this system up the past week and I was 5 of 5 in my trades making over 120 pips. I was one who never thought trading off a 5 minute chart could be profitable. This this goes to show that in Forex there is not just "one right " way to trade.

So Keep it simple and apply Nomo's rules consistantly for 2 weeks. After the 2 week period take a look at your account balance and then decide if you need to change anything about this system or you just need to move on to something that better suits your trading style.

Kudos to Nomo...keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
This box is nothing new. I wasn't aware of this newtron guy up to few days ago

I respect him  and I can tell the similarities, probably different views about time periods. I set myself apart from him by the fact of tryng to make you guys stick to some rules and stay disciplined.

About the trading rooms, you're more than welcome to open one, just be aware price feed difers from broker to broker.

I f you guys do that, I might swing by from time to time, but I can't make any promises nor chanting trades.

cheers

Dear Nomoretoxic,

It was mentioned in a previous post that one could take the BKO and pullback trade not just on the box but in any consolidation period. Could you please describe how you would define when there is consolidation?

Thanks very much,

Lenoxer

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Consolidation is a period when highs and lows are equal. It's like the price are contained withing a range forming some sort of a box. Normally (not to be taken as a rule please) you'll see period like this between 5:00 PM Easter time and 8:00 PM on USD based pairs and 1:00 AM EST to 3:00 AM EST, Just to give you an average.

hope it helps

cheers

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Dear Nomoretoxic,

And what amount of time would you like to see in that consolidation---one hour, two hours? (Then, I assume, you'd go down to the 5" chart and take it from there, n'est-ce pas?)

Thanks,

Lenoxer

--- 帖子 #227 ---
What time would you use if you were going to look at the Asian session.  Would you use 6:00 p.m - 8 p.m est or 5:00 p.m - 8:00 p.m. est?

--- 帖子 #228 ---
T_S - I think it is 6:00 - 8:00 eastern.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Sorry for a late reply. Valid questions here.

I prefer 2 hours time span. On my experience anything less is premature and more will leave you missing a move. That's from trial an error.

Yes that will be 5 minutes (time frame) -2 hour period.

I picked 5 minutes time frame by trial an error as well

hope it helps

--- 帖子 #230 ---
I'll probably go 5 PM to 8:00PM. I don't trade the Asia session

Nomo..

Thanks for sticking to your guns about keeping it simple and using discipline.

Strategies are easy to learn compared to disciline, yet discipline is the one

thing that can turn your account to the positive. I think discipline is located somewhere between the ears.

thanks loads...

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Dear Nomoretoxic,

Yes, yet another timeframe question---and sorry about that---but what is the difference in terms of numbers of trades, expectation of pips, and amount of failure/successes, of, say, using your method on 15" or 30" or 60" charts instead of the 5"?

Thanks,

Lenoxer

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Excellent question

Here's my breakdown concerning about timeframes.

Everything below 1 day, it's noise with probably an exception on 3-or 4 hr.

I won't go into details about noise in order to keep the integrity of the thread.

The reason I pick 5 minutes charts is for a quicker entry. That's it.

On trial an error, 10, 15 minutes and up made me miss the bus more often.

Anything less than 5 minutes is too noisy unless I am in the mood for hyper-scalping (I do that on futures sometimes).

5 minutes deliver an adequate balance of a quick entry (time I need to place my stops) while I watch the market making it's move.

Amount of failure/success varies depending on market conditions. I was glued and stressed out every day waiting for the market to make a move once I got a fill. Now, I really don't care as I pay myself every month. Having losing days is part of the game, no biggie.

I end up in profit every month. That's for sure. Sometimes more, sometime less.

I trade 5 minutes charts (the box and some other system) also I trade off  daily charts, using another method for swing trading. I don't trade anything in between.

hope it helps

--- 帖子 #234 ---
you welcome...Glad to help

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Dear Nomoretoxic,

Thanks very much for your quick response. My brother is thinking of trading BKOs of IBs (like Peter Crowns) with your pullback idea wherever they occur. To be more descriptive, you search for IBs on any timeframe from 60" on up---IBs being a proxy for consolidation---and then drawing the lines and trading the BKO of that "rolling" range with your pullback idea. Your thoughts?

Lenoxer

--- 帖子 #236 ---
I am not familiar with this gentleman methods . As you describe here (correct me if I am wrong) this gentleman is bringing up a floor-like mentality to the forex market (BKO's of  IB's)

This box straddle-like is suitable for a quicker entry. Became some sort of a head start against higher time frames traders. I tried this box in all shapes, times and forms and to me, the most effective way is to be ahead of the crowd - first in, first out.

If he wants to trade on 60 hr charts and up, I suggest using another stuff and combine it with the box. Adjust your load in both methods , that way you capitalize in both, a quick buck on the box and a longer-range trade on higher timeframes.

Capitalization is the key. I do that

I trade off 5 minutes,  combining two methods, and then I shoot for longer range at the daily charts. Works nicely.

But I know people trading the box alone pulling big bucks .

It's pretty much up to the trader.

hope it helps

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Nomo, could you tell us how your swing trading on a daily chart works?

How many pairs do u trade at once?

If one, how do u decide which pair have the most potential at that specific time?

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Although my schedule (read that kids and work) don't allow me to trade a 5 minute chart very often.  It really helps me to see a trade from inception where I can learn from seeing it evolve.  Charts are helpful but not necessary if they are too time consuming to add.

Thank you for the generosity of your time.

Only 1 pair at once.

about potential??  I don't know. Possibly how far/distant is the price from the box line,

I am looking more into EUR/USD cause I get 1 pip spread on Oanda.

I'm confussed...I thought the breakout candle had to close outside of the box.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
I have the same question nomoretoxic

--- 帖子 #258 ---
This is what I understood to be the rules. Maybe I've got it wrong.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
I can see the confusion. I haven't look at my notes but I deeply apologize.

The price needs to break the box. It's a breakout we're looking for. Not necessarily close outside the box.

Breaking to box clearly defines the market looking for a new high or low. That is called "price discovery If I have something about the close has to be outside the box, please disregard. I am human, you know.

One thing for sure is that everything must be done at the close. In other words, you don't place a limit until you see the breakout/pullback candle closed.

Remember that the "kicker" of the system is wait for the pullback to be sure the market keeps it's intentions to go that route.

Again, I haven't check my notes but if it's so again,  my apologies.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Based on a break of the box and not only a close above the box then there were trades on AUDUSD, USDCHF GBPUSD and EURUSD this morning that each would have yielded 20 PIPs of profit, if I'm using the strategy correctly.

Hey Nomo,

Can we benefit from your experience here?

I have been monitoring your system along side the original straight breakout system (of which the originators had been trading profitably for some time).

Is it the current volatile market conditions that are favoring a straight breakout without waiting for the pullback?

How has your trading been over the last year. Do you find that the straight breakout way fails more often during normal/ranging periods?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
First question - current market conditions are meaningless for a 5 minutes charts - you're trading in the middle of the storm - pure noise...so who cares? the market can be up/down/sideways...it won't matter.

I have been burned on a straight breakout way more often than a pullback. My forward-trading experience.

My trading over the last year -  profitable.

hope it helps

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Dear Nomoretoxic,

May I post some questions at the risk of adding detested complication:

1) Where really is the best place to put that risk stop: on the hi/lo of the candle before the BKO candle, at the halfway point of the box, at the other side of the box? ---And, is there anyway of really---really---knowing?

2) Where does one take profit: 20 pips, 30 pips, MA crossing, some sort of time stop, does one take off 1/2 and let the other 1/2 run, etc. etc. etc.? ---Money mge. and not trade entry seem to me to be the key to the system and that is discussed less than the entry.

3) Have you experimented with some filtering of the ranges to make for higher % trades: a certain box width, a certain direction for the BKO based on a trend definition, a certain time, etc. etc. etc.

Do you have any thoughts about these questions? ---I do think that if one could mechanically trade these BKOs on eight pairs at once for the London open and for the NY open with enough of a statistical edge, one would have a sustainable edge.

Thanks so much,

Lenoxer

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Dear Thread,

And one more thought: it's interesting to me that Phil of the Newtron Bomb will tell you everything about how to enter his BKO trade but will tell you nothing essentially about his MM unless you pay his fee. Which indicates to me that the MM is the deal breaker---or maker.

L.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Lenorex

I suggest you read my post carefully. Many of your questions are answered in many of them. But still, I will give you a straight-shoot answer here on this post. Please always ask. I really don't mind but as I said before, even if I clear your confusion on what you're inquiring, still read the posts on this thread.

As I said before, the box is just a guide. The reason why some people are not successful trading the box is because they think the market will respect the box levels to the core. That's absolutely wrong. The box is a guide for your eyes only and it's just another way to spot price discovery by the market.

Price discovery = the market is pushing price to new highs/lows.

About stop loss, yes I understand, could be somehow tricky. Here's the thing. I Always chose to place the stop loss in a place where the market has already discovered (passed thru) that way, there's little chance the market will come back and sweep the stop. As a habit,  I always look for the breakout candle, but it's not a hard and fast rule to place the stop at the other side. I give more weight to the levels (where the breakout candle begins) and sometimes you'll notice more than one candle starting at the same level. That's a sign of a good place to put a  stop.

Another thing you might see is the breakout candle range(or the levels) is too long, probably for your R:R. Maybe is 40-50 pips and you're shooting for 20. Although R:R is unbalanced, I take those trades and in the worst case, I  just adjust the load, so I can keep my risk in check. The trade off is that my profit will be less, but as I said, I keep my risk at level and I don't limit myself on not taking the trade.

More about stop-loss = the trick is not to create a hard and fast rule, but to place it in a level (price) that you see the market will doubly return .

Stop loss is more about price/levels than candles or chart formations.

even so..you will get stopped from time to time...there's no escape my friends...

I hope didn't sound too complicated.

About taking profits - I have notice 20 pips to be a very consistent measure, using the box. But you can go higher if you want. It's hard to tell and you must bear in mind that you're trading off 5 minutes, the middle of the storm. Using a moving average for tp is futile but that's a big subject and as I said before, won't jeopardize the integrity of the thread.

Scaling out is futile as well. Go all the way. Scaling out is in my book another crutch, a big one. I ether take my money off the table or lose. You will see in the long run it's worth it.

about trends = another useless thing for 5 minutes...this one I say it with all my heart. Again, another subject for a new thread.

About me experimenting, well I have experimented with all kinds of stuff. After a while I found out that I should redirect my efforts for consistency rather than wining every trade. I came up to this system after many years of forward testing

Backtesting is completely useless.

Statistics, filtering, etc ..all of what you have described here is exactly what I took off my head and my charts, long time ago. That very day is when I started to be profitable consistenly. .

Getting too technical and quite complicated is the reason why so many people lose in this business. That's why I constantly preach about simplicity.

In top of every advice on this post, if you like this system, just go for it. Think less and act upon. Close your eyes and deal with the market with no fear.

There's may people outhere trying to "understand" the market...they make all kinds of theories based on whatever they  "belieive" .

At the end, the market will do whatever.

Like my mentor say "stop listening to others and start listening to yourself"

believe me it works

hope it helps

--- 帖子 #269 ---
About this gentleman, I really have no comments other than, if  he wants to charge a fee to show you that you should keep a healthy MM. to increase your odds on the long run, here you have it...cost $00000.

I assure you, there's nothing more about MM. If you want to use this all so venerable 2% rule, go for it. Nothing wrong with it. But I will add , you should also consider risk tolerance ( ho much you feel comfortable losing) and put more weight into that.

As I use more than one system, I shoot for  1% - 1.5% risk per trade...works for me.

MM.as a deal breaker, well it's been said many times, and yes I agree to some extend. MM should be something mechanical...automatic and seriously, I don't give it much color as is a requirement for trading. It's something like you must dress up before go to work. Be naked it's not an option.

That's all there's to know about money management

unless somebody has a crystal ball...(a working one)  then we all can pool some money in to pay for the use....LOL

Hi All,

Although Phil Newton doesn't disclose his entire system his videos on the breakout methodology are very educational and I've found them to be very useful. Phil also trades several different strategies that require you to become a member of his website before you get the additional information. I am in no way connected with Phil Newton or his website but I do think Phil's videos are worth a look see.

Dear Nomoretoxic,

Thanks for the good and timely reply. I've indeed read the thread completely a number of times already. In fact, the method is so simple it is hard to believe in it. My mind, Talmudically trained, tends toward complication. The problem of course is my belief system. Your no-holds-barred assault on trading complexity is refreshing. Thanks very much again and the best of luck.

EUR-USD - London session

here's an example of a long pullback - notice where I place my stop. As I mentioned before,  Unbalanced R:R I take those trades by adjusting the load.

Just bear in mind I am watching the pullbacks as it forms - real time.

It's like letting the market come to you. As the market comes back to the south side I already have my stops-limits in place . No sweat - stress free.

by the way here's the rundown.

entry - 1.4705

stop-loss - 1.4750

exit - 1.4685

Oanda's feed by the way.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Here's the same charts I posted above.

The reason why I don't play straight out breakouts.

see for yourself.

pretty much self-explanatory.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
here you go.

do you prefer to be cross-eyed looking at a zillion time frames???

After all, the chop will haunt you.

and....no squiggly lines will save you...I guarantee that.

cheers

--- 帖子 #276 ---
OK, I'll bite.  What do you do in that last screen shot?  GBP-USD is doing the same thing.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
for a box trade.

sit on my hands.

need to see a breakout at the box line for me to start a play.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
That's what I thought.  stay with the rules.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
POSSIBLE TRADE?

Note that my stops-limits are in place already. But things might change.

let's see what happens.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Nomo, just want to be sure I have this down before making live trades, and this one seems very simple. The first candle wasn't a breakout candle because it never went more than 3 pips past the box? The second one was the breakout candle, even though it did not close outside the box. The pair has retraced back up into the box, so I set a stop sell order of the low of the candle, less 3 pips. So I don't have to stay glues to the screen if I don't want to, I've set TP and SL of 20. Also of interest is that anyone that had taken the straight breakout without waiting fro a retrace would most likely have been stopped out.

One final question. On the "other" thread that discussed a similar strategy which doesn't wait for a retrace, a poster said there were huge drawdowns on a similar breakout strategy in early 2007. Do you know anything about that?

--- 帖子 #281 ---
good question

to me 1 pip passing the box is good enough for me for a breakout.

My entry, after the pullback gets on it's way will be 2 3 pips, not a hard and fast rule.

about early 2007, I really don't have a clue. To me Jan-2007 was great.

It all depends on their interpretation of the box. I really don't pay attention to other "systems" . I can tell you, when I started on the box, I was using straight breakouts and yes I got burned big time. Then I started to "tweak " the box with all kinds of stuff, until my eyes got open.

hope it helps

--- 帖子 #282 ---
as you see , I already had my stops-limits on place. Notice the big "wicky" red candle that passed my stop loss( no,  my stop loss didn't get fill)

The reading is on the wall - smells like choppiness to me.

Passing that judgment to you guys.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Nomo,

Is paradoxical correct in that the entry should be at 96,  or should it be at 2-3 pips past the breakout candle?

Thanks,

alex

--- 帖子 #284 ---
oh by the way

I set alarms at the limit (s) of the box, that way I don't glue myself to the screen.

Sometimes you need to trade unbalanced.

read my posts - many times my risk/reward is unbalanced.

Still take the trade - just need to adjust the load.

hope it helps.

Nomo, on your chart, post 183,273, it looks like the pullback candle

in the one next to the breakout candle. If this was a real time trade, it looks like it was a loser. Why do you say false breakout?

I entered 5 pips below the false breakout doji. Stop loss set to prior hi before entry candle, risky due to the long wick candle after it but I felt comfortable. The stop loss was tested twice then south slowly. I followed price action.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Congratulations on your win. BUT.........if the rules that nomo are adhered to, the entry would have been at what you referred to as the false breakout. At least that's the way I interpret it. Of course, you're free to trade the way you see it. But, it doesn't look like this strictly adhered to the original rules.

Just remember the market does not care about 20 pips.  IMO the stop/target should be market based rather than a hard flat number like nomo suggested.

Meet me at the oasis for a drink if you want.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Paradoxical....

A win rate of 100%...come on now...you can't be serious!!! If you are...you better take what money you have left and run like the wind to some other form of investment...like a savings account.

Remember the box is just a guide. I actually enter some trades when the candle is still inside of the box and some after it's outside the box. It all depends on price action and how you're reading market conditions at the time.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
OK Folks, here's where you need to pass judgment on a trade.

As you saw on my last charts, I had place a stop-loss, entry and exit, but as the trade unfolds (in the case I was looking to trade, actually I didn't trade this morning) I would move my stop-loss to a place which the market hasn't discovered yet (recently, remember we're trading off 5 minutes charts)

Notice the original stop-loss and the new stop loss.

I still keep my original entry - no reason to change it.

See you need to make a judgment on this situations.

You either

1) Don't trade. Range is too wide -

2) trade with an unbalanced R:R with a lesser load.

3) use a fixed R:R - this represents a problem on placing the stop too close to the fire.

the 20 rule is a costume. It's not meant to be followed like book. You must be flexible on that.

Listen, sometimes I win more on a trade , sometimes I win less, but I look to see how I can take a chance using the same risk. Doing this,  I sacrifice profit but I get to participate in the market without the risk of putting MM on the shambles.

hope it helps

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Again

You could chose not to trade in market conditions like the charts above. That's valid.

It's pretty much a judgment call.

I take those trades...after all I keep the risk in check lowering the load (# of lots)...but that's me.

This morning, my patience ran short. But still I made some dough during london session.

cheers

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Mappollo

Could u please post ur eur/usd anc usd/chf charts. I would love to see how u got 20 pips out of these this morning. By the way does this include the spread.

I guess your stop loss maybe 35 pips.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Of course I wasn't serious! I think a little bit of humor helps when we're in the serious business of trading. If I'm risking 1 to 1, I'd take a win ratio of 51%. From the looks of it, this system is well over that.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Paradoxical,

Sorry if I misunderstood your post, but there are some people who actually believe that if it's written in someones thread it must be... has to be true. I would agree with you 100% that this thread, if applied properly, should net you well over a 50% win ratio. I've only been trading it for 2 weeks now and I've only had 1 small loss. What I do a bit differently is I will pull my S/L up to break even if I feel the trade is headed back down to my entry point. I feel that I can always re-enter a trade if  it turns and heads back in the original direction.

Nomo has given us basic guidelines and it is up to each one of us to figure out how to apply these guidelines. There is no magic box that gets drawn on your chart from day to day that you can just place a trade and hope it goes in your direction. Remember the box and time set ups are just a guidelines.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
See nomo trade post #309. Pretty much same chart as his, entry, original stop loss and so on. He widened his stop, I kept mine the same.
Solid trade to me.

I entered 5 pips below the false breakout doji. Stop loss set to prior hi before entry candle, risky due to the long wick candle after it but I felt comfortable. The stop loss was tested twice then south slowly. I followed price action.[/quote][/quote]

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Here you go. My stop loss was 50 and tp 20 for eur trade. Its not your 1/1, I include wiggle room based on PA.

Stop loss on chf was 50 as well. Its risky but with the economic shakeup going on I padded the stop loss betting I could get +20 before -50.

Hi Bull:

I notice that you use an indicator that has a 10 pip buffer on each side, while the one NOMO uses one that has a 5 pip buffer.  Question for you or NOMO or anyone really.  The size of the box is different, does it make much of a difference, and is your entry 3 pips above or below the box line no matter the size of the buffer? Thanks for all your help

Jim

--- 帖子 #341 ---
This is what I had on the EU. I had a box low at 1100 GMT of 1.4644.  With the 3 pip buffer the bottom of my box was 1.4641.  I hope this helps. I use IBFX.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Don't get me wrong.

I KNOW the method really well. I was only wondering if you were doing the right thing. Remember time is between 11:00 and 13:00 GMT. You are actually showing 15:00 OR 16:00 GMT on your posted chart. If you use ibfx your low between 11 and 13 GMT should have been 1.4652 and not 1.4644. Look at the attached pic.

If you are trading a different time period then i guess that's a different method not Nomo's.

Just looking out for you man, good luck

--- 帖子 #343 ---
aha. I see my mistake my friend. I used 1055-1300. That chart I included in my last post was just showing when the breakout candle occurred. If you look at that 1055 candle, you'll see my error. It had the low candle I used.  Thanks for looking out for me. I appreciate it.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Hi Jim,

You're right, in my chart the margin or buffer is 10 pips, this was my mistake, sorry for any confusion about that, I just set to 5, I think that the right way is follow the system by the original Nomo rules.

I'll attached some pictures for today, London and US session.

Thank you for show me my mistake.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Hi nomoretoxic,

I am teaching myself to code and thought this would be a good project.

Please find attached an ea.  I realise there is some discretion with the stop loss but I am using a fixed stoploss.  I have allowed 5 pips above and below the box for the breakout and it sends an order 3 pips above or below the breakout candle.  It will only allow one trade per day.

It might be handy for testing different times for the box as well as different take profit and stoploss scenarios.  I have one of the inputs as candle time so you can nominate the timeframe if you want to try 15 minute bars instead which seemed to work quite well.

Hi NOMO, just finished reading the thread and I love the simplicity of it.  I've had 2 +20 trades today on eur/usd which is the only pair I trade.  The first was the breakout of the Asian, BO candle was at 07:15 (London time, I think GMT -1) BO was only 3 pips above then pullback,  entered at 08:30, small pb then full steam ahead.

Second was based on 10/12 consolodation period. BO at 12:30 small pb then down she went for another 20pips price has just pulled back from daily pivot.

I know my box is at diferent times than yours but my thinking is that this will work with any period of consolodation, if you disagree can you please explain why.

Thanks

Dan

Here's the chart for the second trade of Mappollo69 in USDCHF,

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Whenever you see a chart like this you must think on real time.

The idea is to keep your stop away from the fire as much as you can.

Remember this:

you're minimizing risk, not avoiding it.

Entry - 1.4691

original stop-loss - 1.4722

new stop-loss - 1.4732

exit - 1.4671.

The box will work at any consolidation period. I chose those times at London/NY after many years of  trial and error. You're welcome to try any period you seem fit as long as you see a constant consolidation.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Here's why you should place your entry 2 -3 pips away from the breakout.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Did E/U break both sides of the box for everyone else?  If you any ideas on how to play it?

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Something like this:

Short Entry : 1.8432

SL: 1.8580 (148 pips)

TP: 1.8412 (20 pips)

--- 帖子 #369 ---
On IBFX it touched the outside of the box with an allowance of 5 pips. In other words it never broke out, it only touched both sides.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
You would have a order on both sides, and when one is filled you'd cancel the other.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
it broke the upper side of the box....

how to play it??

sit on your hands

cheers

--- 帖子 #372 ---
that's not how you suppose to play it - read my posts

--- 帖子 #373 ---
T4K - the pound has since retraced, and is now eyeing the low of the breakout.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #375 ---
I see that

--- 帖子 #376 ---
if price breaks the top of the box, and then does not trade above the high of the upper break, but then trades down and breaks the bottom of the box, you wouldn't place an order to sell if it trades below the lower break after a retracement?

so you would sit on your hands if price breaks both sides....?

let the market come to you.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
I'm totally agree with nomoretoxic, in this case stay out, it's nothing clear... tomorrow will be another day, btw don't forget that we has a very good trades during the London Session, if somebody loss these trade, don't worry, but don't over trade, the market isn't clear for us.

You work one side of the box. If nothing happens and there's an evident move to the other side, then you work the other. You wait and position yourself ahead of time....if nothing happens, well, move with the herd to the other side.

Doing that you will accomplish two things

1) avoid a shake-out due implied volatility AKA news/announcements.

2) Minimize the risk of a false breakout as the charts illustrate.

cheers

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Don't let the market intimidate you.

If you get stopped on one side of the box AND YOU NOTICE AN EVIDENT MOVE TO THE OTHER SIDE . . work it out.

Two strikes in a row - quit for the day.

of course, you need to adjust MM and everything.

You're cautious, which is ok but you're here for the money as well.

cheers

Out +20 GU short

gotcha, I was wrong about having open orders on both sides.  When you said you'd sit on your hands I thought you would'nt take a down move if it happened according to the rules.  thx

--- 帖子 #383 ---
I guess R:R ratios are overrated. +20 pips

--- 帖子 #384 ---
why would you place your stop so far away.  At that level you would need 7 ish winners to cover that loss.  You could've used a stop above the high of the retracement that on ibfx was around 1.8493.  That was still far away, but 40 pips closer then yours (2 winners).

--- 帖子 #385 ---
I used a stop of 1.8493. The top of the retracement. Nice trade!!

nomoretoxic, how long do you hold the trades open in the London and NY timeframes?

--- 帖子 #393 ---
well..what do you know??

people are having a good week here.

Always a reminder - the would be times not as rosy as this one.

You job is to keep going and stick to the system - be disciplined even in rough times.

Cheers.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
NY - anything after 2:00 PM - 3:00PM I probably won't take it.

But, there's exceptions. On that it's your call.

. - If you see the market getting choppy after 2:30 PM - Better to stay out , especially on Fridays.

On London - I try to complete my trades before the NY Box starts - another judgment call...I mean, if the market keeps rolling, go for it.

Cheers

Nomo, have you given any thought in sharing your daily chart

trading system with us? If it's half as good as your box system, you will make a lot of traders very happy campers.

Thanks again for sharing your system with us. It's the only

system I now trade and life is much simpler and more profitable. My 2 hour box is from 8-10 pm west coast time. I use a 3 minute chart as I find this gets me in a little earlier and as of now, has not put me in a trade that the 5 minute chart

would have got me into. So, PLEASE give some serious thought

in sharing your other system.  Thx

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Nomo - Thank you for sharing your system, and for the breath of fresh air.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Nomo I was wondering how you deal with news.  If a news report sent price through the BO line and then retraced, would you treat this as a breakout and put your order above/ below the line or would you wait for the market to settle and still wait for pullback off the next bo.

Thanks

Well i figured why I have been doing so poorly in london, time was off 30 minutes. 130a to 330a est doesnt work for me.

EU Trade

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Hi iflyhigh72,

No, I didn't away from Cable, the Trade look good (before to know the result ).... Why look ok: The box range is 52 pips, then it's ok; the R:R also look ok, Stop Loss in 22 pipsn then near to be 1:1, and EU & UCHF are going in the same direction (EU was going down in armony with cable and UCHF was going in a up trend). After all of this points, I take the trade, and as you can see was a Loss Trade.

I hope that can help my explanation, sorry if I'm not very clear or for any mistake in my English.

Here are my results from the London session today.

GBPUSD (-54 PIPs)

Short 1.8339

SL 1.8393 (54 PIPs!)

TP 1.8319

GBPJPY (+20)

Short 193.93

SL 194.40 (47 PIPs)

TP 193.72

EURUSD (+20)

Short 1.4599

SL 1.4634 (35 PIPs)

TP 1.4579

USDCHF (+20)

Long 1.0892

SL 1.0857 (35 PIPs)

TP 1.0812

AUDUSD (+20)

Short 0.8287

SL 0.8304 (17 PIPs!)

TP 0.8267

The SL on the GBPUSD was so big that I scaled back on the LOT size pretty significantly. The SL on the AUDUSD trade was less than 20 PIPs so I increased my normal LOT size.  MM helped improve the results from a cash standpoint.

RR -

--- 帖子 #412 ---
you're doing great!!!

adjusting the lot size is the way to go with the box.

You will take the trades no matter how far risk would be.

cheers.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Hello to all of you here I'm new to this thread trying to understand the system you using, looks good.

Question what is the MM stand for please, sorry for my ignorance.

Thanks.

no problem my friend.

MM = Money Management.

This is my first post on FF. After spending months reviewing myriad of strats this one suits my style the most.

Q: on todays eur/usd NY box are you guys still waiting for a pullback?

How does it work in this case?

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Yes, a pullback hasn't occured yet.  Looks like the 9:30EST bar may be one.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
welcome!!

On your question,  yes, we just wait for a pullback.

hope it helps.

cheers.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Waiting for a pullback has saved the day today on the GBP and EUR. The EUR penetrated the box by about 15 pips, and went way back up over 50 points, and the GBP also went about 15 pips into the box, and then reversed upwards from there by 99 points. Anyone that had taken these as straight breakouts without waiting for a reversal almost assuredly would have been stopped out. As it is, on these two, they're coming back down., But, with the credit crisis in the U.S., maybe it's a good day to just pass on trading. No one knows what senators (who get campaign bribes from the same banks that failed) will do to get us out of the mess that THEY got us into.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
I agree 100% - a shaky day for trading - all markets.

If you go back in time and check all the false breakout,  at any pair, you'll be amazed.

cheers

--- 帖子 #420 ---
-21 GU I got suckered in. I had a break out at 1.8370. After the pullback candle. I set my sell stop in at 1.8367. It was triggered and up it went.  Oh well. To make up for it, I am +20 USD/JPY. Heres my chart. I hope you understand it. Ill take any feed back or criticism.  Thanks

--- 帖子 #421 ---
You did not get "suckered in". You followed your trading rules. I applaud you for displaying your chart of a failed trade. In fact, with IBFx, the GU in the London session lost also.

IMO, it would be very beneficial for Nomoretoxic to display the charts of his trades during today's London and New York sessions. Sometimes you learn much more investigating losing trades versus winning trades.

Unless, of course, he did not trade today. Just a suggestion.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
I think I have a problem with your tool, but before I go and attempt to alter the code myself, let me just double check with you...

The way I understand is, that the boxes are set on the open of the london and NY exchanges...

but in my Mt4 software.. the time runs on European Zone time.. and I have searched and searched and I can't find a way to change it to eastern time.

so in my case I would have to go into the code and alter the box times by about 6 hours or so, to have the boxes function properly ... correct?

--- 帖子 #423 ---
I did the same thing on gu

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Hi guys.....i don't trade on fridays, except in the London session, and i think that nomoretoxic said that he doesn't as well.  in my past experience, trading another breakout strategy, fridays are usually unpredictable.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Guys

look at my posts . It's Friday. Look at my last post. The markets are shaky. You must keep your ear on the ground. I didn't trade today, by the way.

On another subject, I've been telling you guys that you WILL have losers. If you're coming here thinking that the box is a 100% winner, I am sorry to disappoint you.

If you lost today, well, deal with it. If you're using a proper money management, well, where's the problem??

I personally don't have any criticism to you. You played by the rules. That's the way it is. You WILL lose sometimes, no matter what you use.

iflyhigh72, you have a great attitude. That's the way it is. Maybe you lose on Monday again  who knows???  you just need to keep going forward like an elephant.

To all of you, do yourself a favor. If you feel that this system/strategy etc suits you, stick to it. Make a precedent here at forex factory for a change and stick to your guns. Believe me it pays.

cheers

--- 帖子 #426 ---
1 am to 3 am eastern

--- 帖子 #427 ---
The only thing you did wrong imo if you are trading Fridays is missing the move on the top of the box.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Hi All,

I just wanted to show you an example from Friday where I was too greedy and wasn't paying attention to what was going on in the market place.

I took a EURUSD trade just after the London session open. The box broke to the downside and I had a small retracement happen just outside the box. Got in @ 1.4605. Now my target was some 80-100 pips away and I was pretty sure it was going to make it based on my technical analysis. Price retraced and went back down and reached 1.4555 which was a 50 pip trade. At that point I was still sure it was going lower. Now I got a little greedy here and wasn't paying attention to the Banking Bailout issues the USA was running into and when the USA market opened on Friday...boom...price went up and stopped me out for a 20 pip loss. I wasn't at my computer at the time other wise I may have gotten out at break even. The point is not that I lost on this trade, the point is you can't be too greedy in this game and you need to pay attention to the Fundamentals so you don't get surprised like I did.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Good post OZ, we need reminders like this to point out the pitfalls. I think if I saw the possibility of a 50 to 100 pip move I would use a trailing stop or keep moving the SL after every 15 pip move. Just a suggestion. p.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Good Morning All:

THis is what I saw for London Session this morning:

GBPJPY: +20

AUDUSD: -20

GBPUSD: -50

EURUSD: -18

USDCHF: No Trade

If anyone saw/had different results, please let me know.

I'm seeing consolidation in AUDUSD and GBPJPY in the NY box.  We'll see what happens.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Well, G/U was not good.

I've been telling you , there will be losing days.

it's part of the game - you just keep going.

Here's where others start to "improve" the strategy.

In my case, I don't.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Thanks for the response.

No modifications on my part.  As we have discussed in the past, MM was adjusted to account for the 50 PIP SL.

On to NY.

Can't thank you enough for showing this to us!

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Always here to help!!!

it's good to see that the box has a losing period (London) that way you can see, this is not a holy grail.

Although it's not (a holy grail) some of you have already see the consistency of the box when a pullback is applied.

Despite we had a loser at London session, here's is a chart (at the same session) of a false breakout.

be the judge.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
AUDUSD: - No Trade

GBPJPY: +20

GBPUSD: +20

EURUSD: +20

USDCHF: +20

Increased positioning on the GBPJPY because of consolidation I saw during the box.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Some time adjustments (1.30-3.30) today would have avoided a loss on EUR/USD.

Good 20+ pips on USD/CHF and USD/JPY.

A question nomo...

If you were to adjust the timeframe on a pair and you are trading several pairs in the session, would you adjust the timeframe on each pair that you are considering trading?

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Time adjustment on the EUR/USD...

Trade with sense and u avoid some losses :-)

Nice trading Roth!

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Good question Trade sense.

I don't adjust time on the box. I know there will be losses. It's part of the game. I work with probabilities. Actually, as a matter of fact this is a game of probabilities. I don't avoid losing. I minimize risk.

I prefer to work 1 pair at the time. I found out that trading may pairs at once is not worth it (a rule not to be followed, my personal choice). I have more control on money management using just 1 pair. Less stressful.

hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Cool... thanks for the info nomo.

Thanks.

Let's hope that the NY session has good opportunities too!

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Here are my results so far for this session:

USDCHF: +23

EURUSD: +44 (Once I got to +20 PIPs I put in a trailing stop: Nomo obviously did a better job on this trade than me.)

AUDUSD: +70 (Trade ongoing SL moved to +20)  This was a 1:1 trade, my best trade so far

I'll provide my entries, SLs, and TPs if it will help....

RR -

--- 帖子 #449 ---
OK.

Trade outside the box - not the first time. (check my previous charts).

I used a 1:1 R/R  - 60 pips stop-loss - 60 pips profit target.

Money management/load adjusted.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Well done guys.. yes RRoth, please can u post entries, SLs, and TPs.

Many Thanks

--- 帖子 #451 ---
nomo,

great trade!

i know sometimes you use imbalanced r:r ( load adjusted ).

how did you know you could go for 60 tp today?

i got 20 on eurusd and audusd today

alex

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Well, if you notice the move was way outside the box.

It's more like a judgment call than anything else.

20 pips unbalanced are good when you can trade close to the box. Even so you can still go 1:1. Not a hard and fast rule.

My point is to prove you can get 20 pips consistently.

hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #453 ---

Hi nomoretoxic,

no probleme. The next chart is clean.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
You're correct, there could have been a trade on the 5:40 Est bar. I didn't take it because it was too close to the next session for me.

The trade would still be open at this point. It would have looked like this if I woud have taken it:

Entry 1.4163

SL 1.4112 (51 PIPs)

TP 1.4214

Too risky for me that late in the session. Nomo's the expert, he can weigh in on my decision.

Hope this helps

RR -

--- 帖子 #464 ---
I normally don't trade anything close to 7:00 AM coming down from London session.

As to the exact time to stop trading, pretty much a judgment call.  I check how the price has been trading inside the box. If get's choppy, I stay out - another good thing about the box in my opinion.

Hope it helps

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Here is the chart

--- 帖子 #466 ---
it's is a clean - stopped out - no questions about it.

Like 1 hour before 7:00 AM.

Here's my advice to you.

if you see the trade not coming 1 or 1/12 hours before 7:00 am, I suggest don't take the trade.

But....

if you're in a trade and the market gets choppy afterward, you can either close the trade with a loss or simply let it go (which is risky).

Anyway, what will make you or break you as a trader, is to know that losses are possible no matter what system/strategy/box you use.

We try to minimize risk. That's the best we can do.

hope it helps

cheers

I started casually eyeballing the Asian session last week (E/U, G/U, G/Y). There are some trades if you stick with the rules. Last couple of days have been choppy, but I have noticed that the pound yen will explode out of the box for 20-30 pips and more (usually not long after the open). But never come back until the Euro session.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Absolutely. I personally don't trade Asia session but it's probably worth to take a look at it.

Here's an indicator that draws a vertical line per session. It's adjustable. I found it very useful.

Hope it helps.

i notice that e/u has formed a 30 pip trading range from 09:45gmt onwards. My question is are you guys looking out for an intermediate opportunity before NY opens or purely running the boxes?

I suppose the key to trading the box (and any other formation) is getting the confirmation of breakout nailed down right... any general thoughts regarding confirmation for a noob like myself?

Nice trade, but do you not wait for the retrace candle?

are you trading the box not waiting for a pullback??

EUR-USD.

Notice that the market broke the box 3 times. The first time was a straight breakout, then the market went back to mama's belly. There's two subsequent breakouts with their pullbacks, I decided to show you guys the second one for illustration purposes. You could take the first one and will work out nicely as well.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
That is what I did.  Like you said the box is an excellent "guide".

Good trade on the EURUSD. After the straight breakout I stoped watching it. I don't think that I would have taken it anyway.

Nomo - do you ever look at the 1min chart for a pullback/confirmation or too noisy? The "straight breakout" on 5m is not so straight on 1m?

--- 帖子 #506 ---
1m =  too noisy.

never look at million timeframes to confirm a trade .

hope it helps.

How come you didn't use the original breakout low as the entry point?

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Well, I did or I should say, it's possible. But as price action unfolds, it turn out to be ugly - remember you have the upper hand as price action is happening while you wait.

This is the true definition of "position trading" . If you see the market coming back to the box with anger, common trading sense will put you into halt mode.

Hi RR,

Nice trade on GPB/JPY.

What trading platform are you using?

I had entry on AUD/USD at 0.7748 and closed at 25 pips.

Good night for the Asian Session. Too bad the spreads are higher nowadays.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Yes my trades on G/U and E/U were pretty much identical.  Just a pip difference.  The session was a little slower than the rest of this week, of course non farm payroll is today, and everything seems to slow down until the release.

Hey Nomo,

Just wanted to know the reasoning behind the box being between 7.00-9.05 and not 7.00-9.00.

Is it because of the results of the forward testing which you have done?

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Well....

A valuable lesson learned.

Nomoretoxic, thanks for the great thread.  Maybe I should pay attention  to and stop feeling compelled to trade.

Results of my UC trade.  Range was way to big and I must have been crazy to enter.

As the teacher says.... tomorrow is another day .

Have a good weekend all!

--- 帖子 #518 ---
No reason, I think is a glitch on the program  or something. Five minutes won't make a difference.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Just set the box to end at 8:59 if you so desire.  I did that for the Asian session just because of the way price has been firing out of the box as Asia opens.

Ok Thanks Nomo and Cmartin.

I am looking for the best session times.

New-York session : 7-9 am EST = 11am-12:59am GMT

Are you ok with me?

Thank you!

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Dear Nomo and Thread,

Can people share alternative ways to exiting these BKO trades other than a straight 20 pips? Though it seems to me that there there is much money being left on the table, I do not want to expect from the method more than it can deliver.

Thanks,

Lenoxer

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Personally from me, I will more prefer a TP of 20pip which grant us a higher probability of winning.

But here's some method.

1) Only set SL for your trade, but no TP. Exit it manually using market price action. Required a fully understand market experienced trader.

2) Use scale out.

Example :

Open with 3lot. Close 1st lot at 15pips (then move SL to +1), 2nd lot at 30pips (move SL to +31), and 3rd lot trail it with 15pips trailing stop.

But do not forget, only use scale out method on the setup having a good quality. Bcoz, if the setup doesn't hit your first TP at all, you will suffer by hitting your SL with 3lot. Then you'll

A lot happening this session, could have got over 100 points on 2/3 different pairs

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Hi RRothschild.  With that 80 pip win on the aussie, are you just using a 20 pip trailing stop?  Thanks

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Yes, once I get to 20 PIPs, I lock those in and trail at that point.  Sometimes that will make you miss a bigger move like I did this morning on the GBPUSD.  I got 19 PIPs but the market pulled back to my stop and then took off for another bunch of PIPs.

Nomo originally said that the system pretty much can consistanly produce 20 PIPs, so I lock in the "guaranteed" PIPs then let the market do its thing.  I'm still experimenting with the TP.  Nomo said we should aim for 1:1 r/r.  So that is usually my initial TP, then based on PA I adjust sometimes.

I figure it's only fair for an EA for this system. I coded an EA with adjustable times so you can define your specific range-finding period. Just make sure that the EA is placed on the 1 minute chart.

No, it doesn't follow the usual wait-for-retrace-then-take-trade. I'm still working on that.

It's an unfortunate part of life here at FF.

Life Cycle of popular thread: New/Exotic idea comes out Idea is proven to be  very successful early on Veterans are attracted because the idea is successful. Newbies flock after the veterans Veterans get angry at newbies for laziness and repetitive questions EAs and indicators are developed for the system. Newbies start suggesting/demanding modifications which make the system "better" More EAS and indicators are developed for the system More newbies join in on the fun but don't want to read the thread through The new newbies start blaming the veterans for not helping them. Veterans get angry at the newbies for disturbing/annoying them with repetitive questions Creator is either kicked off or leaves due to the emotional unrest System starts failing, people start calling this a fluke Thread loses interest Thread dies. Repeat.

For the Asian session, it seems a straight breakout achieved the above results except usd/chf. Can you confirm? I am finding out it may be better not to wait for retrace during this session, pairs tend to just run with the initial breakout.

Whats your experience with the Asian session, insight appreciated.

Great post RR.....It's a viscous circle.  Unfortunately, most of the newbies asking the questions should be studying trading101 instead of jumping into systems that will only deplete their trading capital unless their lucky.  I'm sure those that fall in that category will also not follow the rules of the system when it has a downturn.  That's always when they start recommending to add to the system or change something.

London session was all over the place. There were no other setups other than AUDUSD that I saw.

There have been some good straight breakouts, if you look closely 2 out of 3 are false breakouts. We may have missed 1 or 2 big moves, but we probably missed many more big losses. Just my view.

I reluctantly took a AUDUSD trade and it worked out.

Had no trades.  The market was too wild for me.

--- 帖子 #577 ---
I used the prior highest high before the initial breakout.

we should be using a price that the market hasn't been to in a while.

Sometime, when you end up out of the box, then you should use the highest high of the retracement......because it is the highest high that the market has seen in a while....

Nomo any additional wisdom would be appreciated.

Hope this helps.....

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Nomo,

Have you ever reused the same side of the box after you have made a profitable trade?

If you have the time, take a look at the GBPUSD this NY Session.  Loos like you could have gotten 20 PIPs from the initial retracement of the box.

Then you have double bottom low close bars, a retracement and then further movement down.

What do you think?

RR -

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Hi RR:       Thanks for your quick reply.  Do you worry about R:R with a SL that high when we're shooting for approx 20 pips?Jim

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Yes, we reduce the LOT size, so that you can take the trade.

sometimes the r/r is off, but you can still aim for 1:1 and lock in the 20 PIPS once you get them and trail the rest.  you will lose from time to time it happens.

Hi Folks:         Question for the group.  Can the same candle be both a breakout candle and a reversal candle. i.e. box closes, then next candle has a wick that breaks the top of the box, but then closes as a down candle, could that candle be both, or do we have to wait for the next reversal candle. Especially interested in what Nomore has to say. Keep up the great thread guys.Jim

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Ok

If you see a candle breaking the box, no matter how that candle closes, it constitutes a breakout. That's all the information you need.After that, you must wait for the next candle/bar to reverse. Could be 1 candle or could be more than one, who knows. Don't get to tight about candles, just be attentive to price. The logic behind the breakout is the market looking for new highs/lows. The logic behind the pullback is (very often) scared money running away as the move is contrarian to what they have perceived. Also,pullbacks could be stops getting hit. Could be the combination of two....really hard to tell, but don't worry, we don't really care.

Candles/bars are just a way for you to see the past representation of price in a pictorial way. That's pretty much it.

Hope it helps

Hi Nomo:

Thanks for that consice, informative explanation.  You helped me a lot and I'm sure a lot of others on this thread.  Have a great weekend.

Jim

i'm sorry if my question sounds stupid, i still don't get it

the size of the box... is it 2 hours before london open ? or the start of the box is when london session begin ?

--- 帖子 #607 ---
5:00 - 7:00 GMT  =  6:00 - 8:00 London time.

I use 5:00 - 6:59 GMT

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Hi Nomo,

When a breakout occurs and lets say the pull back doesn't occur until after 100+ pips, would you still enter this trade even after such a large move or do you usually look for a pair to pull back fairly quickly after a breakout ?

Thanks,

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Does anyone here trade the NZD/USD on the NY session ?  I've had mixed results with this pair on the NY session.

--- 帖子 #610 ---
if the pullback happens way over the box, I still take the trade.

How many candles/ how far - distant is the breakout from the box won't affect the trade. Remember , the box is just a guide. Most importantly is to position yourself in term of stop-loss/profit target, and take advantage of the move after the pullback.

hope it helps

--- 帖子 #611 ---
thanks for response

Nomo, does the 5 minute bar have to close out of the box or is it good enough

if the bar just breaks the high/low of the box?

the price has to close outside the box

Everything must be done at the close

Hi Folks: Question for the group. Can the same candle be both a breakout candle and a reversal candle. i.e. box closes, then next candle has a wick that breaks the top of the box, but then closes as a down candle, could that candle be both, or do we have to wait for the next reversal candle. Especially interested in what Nomore has to say. Keep up the great thread guys.Jim

Ok

If you see a candle breaking the box, no matter how that candle closes, it constitutes a breakout. That's all the information you need.After that, you must wait for the next candle/bar to reverse. Could be 1 candle or could be more than one, who knows. Don't get to tight about candles, just be attentive to price. The logic behind the breakout is the market looking for new highs/lows. The logic behind the pullback is (very often) scared money running away as the move is contrarian to what they have perceived. Also,pullbacks could be stops getting hit. Could be the combination of two....really hard to tell, but don't worry, we don't really care.

Candles/bars are just a way for you to see the past representation of price in a pictorial way. That's pretty much it.

Hope it helps

NOMO, first you say the candle has to break the box and close out of the box, then you say all it has to do is break the box and does not have to close out of the box. So which is it???

Hi all,

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Ok I see where the confusion is.

What I meant by the close is that some people place an trade before the candle closes. That's wrong. You have a candle or let's say it properly, the market breaking the box, you don't do anything. Everything must be done at the close means, you sit on your hands and wait 'n see if there's a pullback afterward.

My emphasis at the close of the candle is for you to avoid pulling the trigger before a pullback materializes. If is in or out the box it won't matter.

"the price has to close outside the box" is a wrong choice of words. My apologies.

Ok to make things even clearer, the box will only tell you if the market has intentions to make new highs/lows when it breaks the box. Could be candles, bars etc...it doesn't matter...price is what we're looking for.

Once you see the market (let's substitute candle with markets ) breaking the box line (which is a pre-detremined arbitrary price we have already programmed on the box)  it's just a signal. You go to yourself with something like "hm, the market wants to go that way, but I need assurance"...this is where the pullback comes in.

Also bear in mind that the pullback bar/candle has to close as well.

everything must be done at the close - true

the price has to close outside the box - wrong -

the price has to break the box - true

Again,  my apologies for the wrong use of words.

hope it helps

Hi

I thought I would post this chart showing a successful GU trade from this morning. My entry is indicated by the up arrow. I used a 30SL and 20TP- I found the SL indictaed by the breakout candle to be just too large and 30/20 are R/R Ive used for a little while now.

The pullback was only formed by one candle but I felt it met with the rules?

Have a good day

Dear sir/madam.

Just as informative note, I'll repeat, swaps were pretty active today. Lack of volatility has nothing to do with banks been close. We're not here to go beyond a trading system per se.

This EA is not meant for auto trading. Its only an alert.

It sends you an email,

raises an Alert sound,

takes a chart snapshot when alert is triggered,

whenever a breakout,pullback,entry setup is triggered.

--- 帖子 #662 ---
I am trying to figure out what you mean, well please correct me if I am wrong.

Waiting for a trade is probably what you're looking for.

Normally NY session get's slow after 2:00PM Eastern time. Moreover on Friday.

It's pretty much a judgment call to either trade it or pull off a trade that's going nowhere.

Hope I have got your question correctly.

--- 帖子 #663 ---
The indicator and EA by Cheelu is very good. Am switching over to it. The EA gives you a pop up alert. All we need now is an EA based on this to make the actual trades, and I'll see you at the beach!

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Well, an EA will be a bit of a challenge as we don't use a fixed stop loss and some of us use another measure for take profit (maybe that PF thing could be worked out)  hope I am wrong 'cause an EA will be sweet!!!

--- 帖子 #665 ---
It's so nice to see people around here making profit slowly and steady.

Cheers to all of you!!!

--- 帖子 #666 ---
What's that PF thing?

I have a version that calculates the lot size based on the capital, max risk per trade and the stop loss. But the stop loss would be either the previous swing high/low or 20 pips , whichever is higher. Will post that version tommorrow.

--- 帖子 #667 ---
PF = Profit Target

Hi cheelu:          First off, thanks for a great indicator. I'm trying to add two different time frame indicators to the same chart, i.e., london box and then n.y. box and it won't let me, it always gets rid of the older box.  Does someone have a solution for this, or do I just have to open up 2 different charts of the same pair and add the indicator to the different charts instead of on 1 chart? Thanks guysJim

--- 帖子 #669 ---
It is possible to have more than one session box . There is a session number on the indicator. You have to give a different session number each time u attach. I will make that session number as input and repost the indicator.

give me about 4-5 hours. will do it after work.

I posted the latest version of indicator on

--- 帖子 #672 ---
I think I'm confused here... what times do you use for your box for Asian Session? I saw you mention earlier that you use the same times swakop, but his box doesn't finish for another ten minutes?

--- 帖子 #673 ---
My Bad....for Asian I run the box 6-7:59pm EDT.  So the 2 hours up to the open of the Asian session

--- 帖子 #674 ---
I thought so judging from a few of your other posts. I was just wondering, does it seem like that works out better? I mean the other sessions my start time is either 30minutes-1hour after the open, but since asian is a different world, do you find it to be better?

--- 帖子 #675 ---
So far yes.....you always get that bit of a lull after the NY session before Asia opens.  I have always noticed an increase of activity at the open, around 10-10:30 and 11:30-12 for this session.....

--- 帖子 #676 ---
Hi folks:

i attached the new indicator that was done so nicely by cheelu #644, but unless I'm seeing things, the beginning of the box looks like it might be off. The red line indicating the limits of the box plus a buffer is higher than even the low of the first candle.  Could someone explain if I'm looking at that wrong. Thanks

Jim

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Hi bigjim1958,

you're right. If the first candle marked a hight or low in the box, it don't consider.

Are you talking about the 5 pips offset represented by a red line (down) and a green line (up). ???

--- 帖子 #683 ---
yes, the box provided by cheelu doesn't appear to use the first candle the way that you recommend. Again, I may be wrong, just looking for your inputJim

I notice the dotted line appears just before the pullback. I assume that's for signaling the risk (stop loss) and it takes in consideration the last swing high. So, please correct me if I am wrong, the dotted line will appear after the swing is confirmed??

regarding the alert, do you want the alert on the indicator itself as opposed to using an ea ? thats possible.

--- 帖子 #700 ---
Guys

You can choose to trade 1 or 2 pairs...

If you trade more than one pair,  be sure to  spread the risk among them wisely.

This thread is about some people making profit quietly...that's interesting,  don't you think??

cheers

--- 帖子 #701 ---
So...what are you saying? We should not talk about winners and losers?

--- 帖子 #702 ---
It is refreshing actually.  It's simple and effective, and most people here want complicated with thousands of indicators or a robot to trade for them.  I use this along with two other volatility breakout methods that are very simple.  That is all I need.

--- 帖子 #703 ---
oK

I use the dotted line, before my order gets filled. The reason why is due the fact I make my calculations (the whole bracket, entry, stop loss and profit target) once I see the market coming back to my direction. That gives me enough time to calculate how much I am risking and how many lots/mini lots (load) I will use so I can keep my risk always at the same level, no matter how far/distant the swing is.

The idea is to be ready before the order gets filled.

Could this dotted line appears before my entry gets filled??

Like for instance, wait a couple for bars heading in our direction before the dotted line appears...

if is not possible, we'll love you anyways.

You have no idea how easy my life is now with this indicator LOL.

I hope I don't sound too complicated...if you got lost, please let me know.

Please advise.

--- 帖子 #704 ---
oh not at all, I love when you guys talk about winners and losers. It's that I see all of you making pips consistently and I can't avoid to be glad for all of you...as I said in one of my post "consistency is the key" (my mentor words by the way).

cheers

--- 帖子 #705 ---
That is what I was thinking.  I just kept using the original box from the beginning of the thread.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
I believe the indicator gives the trader more information on the go.

If cheelu can't do anything on the stop-loss line I'll use it anyway.

The stop-loss line still brings a confirmation on the swing so it's not a big deal.

cheers

--- 帖子 #707 ---
I got the EA now...Excellent job.

Thanks a lot cheelu!!

cheers

--- 帖子 #708 ---
hi Nomo,

if i understand it properly, once the pullback starts to happen, i should immediately find the swing high/low and draw the dotted line. if price reaches a new swing point, the dot line should be redrawn.

i can do that.

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Exactly...that will be nice!!!

--- 帖子 #710 ---
I think it would be awesome to have on the indicator that way we could just have a box for each session and be alerted instead of having to change the box times for the EA each time.

It isn't all that hard, but it would be a convenience if its at all possible.

swakop,

I appreciate your sharing - I am trying to make sure I have this down..

Looking at your chart, was there a reason you did not take the pullback that occurred at approx 7:45 chart time?  Looks like there was pullback candle that closed back in the box and the the next one continued up.

Your comments are greatly appreciated..

Cheelu,

Thanks for the advice but what you advise is something I have tried several times to make work. If this is an indicator it cannot work as a ex4. It runs as an EA. There seems to be alot of confusion about it need to be loaded. Are you running indicators or Ea's.

As I said before I have used Metatrader for many years and I'm always learning something new everyday but how you described the installation, as an indicator ex4, does not make sense. It needs to be complied normally to run as a mq4 to be an indicator.

I know I'm not the only one having problems understanding this?

Thank you

--- 帖子 #734 ---
Cheelu,

Thank you for the effort and I'm sure however your indicator/EA works it looks like a fine effort.

--- 帖子 #735 ---
Sorry. I should've named the files better.

BOXBreakout.ex4 is an indicator

BreakOutAlert.exe4 is an EA.

--- 帖子 #736 ---
Question for NOMO and or Cheelu. I thought I understood this system until today. Today's NY session - EUR/USD - The Cheelu box shows the pullback bar at 13:45 GMT. This bar made a higher high than the bar before it. How can this be a pullback bar?

--- 帖子 #737 ---
could u pls post ur chart?

--- 帖子 #738 ---
Cheelu,

Thank you for clarifying, it's now clear how it works.

--- 帖子 #739 ---
So my question is about the pullback candle. For a long trade,

can a candle be the pullback candle if it makes a higher high that the candle before it but closes lower than the candle before it if?

--- 帖子 #740 ---
Hi folks:         I loaded "breakout alert ex4 EA", #645 and got the text on the screen but no box. Do we then have to load "BoxBreakout.ex4, #644 to get the box and will they both work together.  I couldn't get them to work, but that could be me.  Hopefully this will clear it up for everyone.Jim

--- 帖子 #741 ---
Hi:   Follow up to previous post, loaded the indicator and ea, it works, but don't have stop loss line. If someone has a better way to get it to work, I'm all ears.  This way will work, but it won't have the stop loss level. Any suggestions?Jim

--- 帖子 #742 ---
the indicator and ea are independent of each other.

download the latest indicator from the first post of my journal. that version will display the stop loss. but remember, right now it gets displayed only if entry is hit. im working on another version that displays the stop line all the time.

--- 帖子 #743 ---
the way i think and which is what i've coded on to the indicator is

a candle becomes a pullback candle (for long) if it either stops making new high or if its a bearish candle (close below open)

can other folks confirm this?

--- 帖子 #744 ---
.EX4 is all metatrader needs for both indicator and ea. you need mq4 only if u are going to be modifying the code. i have several indicators for which i have only .ex4 file. Even Nomo posted a sessions indicator thats only .ex4.

--- 帖子 #745 ---
Hi Nomo,

I apologize that your great thread is clogged up with my posts about indicator. If you want we all can discuss about indicators and EAs in a seperate thread or my journal, so that this thread remains focussed on just trading.

--- 帖子 #746 ---
I was under the impression that a candle is a breakout candle (for long) if it's a bearish candle only. If it doesn't make a new high, but doesn't close below open, that is not considered a pullback candle, nomo?Jim

--- 帖子 #747 ---
sorry I was out for some time.

You'll be better of thinking of price instead of a candle. If the market breaks the box, no matter how it closes, is a breakout. On that moment is where the play starts.

Pullback has many colors. You could have a pullback many periods AKA candles in a row or you could have a pullback just right at the next period. In my experience (many forward testing included) if you have a breakout candle (now we can talk candles) let's say bullish and the next candle retraces (please read this carefully) and closes bullish(same color at the breakout candle) but doesn't violate the high of the breakout candle, that tells me that the market is not done yet going up. Same for shorts.

I'll rather wait for a clear signal.

hope it helps

--- 帖子 #748 ---
Nomo, still not clear on the pullback candle. Assume a long trade. If the pullback candle closes below the breakout candle, but did make a higher high

that the breakout candle, does it still qualify as a pullback candle because it closed lower than the breakout candle?

--- 帖子 #749 ---
Sorry my bad:             I meant to say that a candle is a PULLBACK candle only if it closes opposite of the direction of the breakout, sorry for that. Also if people could distinguish between the first breakout, when price first breaks the box and the second breakout, it might make it easier for people to understand.  Or I'm the class dunce, and you can send me the dunce cap if you like. ThanksJim

--- 帖子 #750 ---
yes definitely qualifies....if it closes lower than the breakout candle...

--- 帖子 #751 ---
Hi Nomo,

I understand now. a bullish candle with lower high is not a pullback candle. But any kind of bearish candle is a pullback candle right?

can a  candle be considered as pullback candle

if its a bearish candle with higher high

--- 帖子 #752 ---
Hi Nomo,

I think we're more confused as a group then when you first introduced your method.  Any help would be greatly appreciated. This is a great system, just have to get all of us up to speed.

Ok here's some charts.

--- 帖子 #754 ---
Look at the charts.

--- 帖子 #755 ---
As you see in the charts, a pullback could start in one candle, and then move many candles before coming back.

We could say that the next candle either bearish or bullish is a sign. Just to make our lives easier. But I don't want you guys to be on your toes because the following candles (after the initial pullback-candle) keeps retracing. This is why I said before that pullback has many colors.

Notice there's a bullish candle with a bullish low - still part of the whole move.

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Now for the easy part.

The reason I've been talking about cheelu's making my life easier, it's that you just have to follow the entry lines and place your stops/limits automatically . That way you won't have to over-think about your trades or how far-distant pullbacks are.

--- 帖子 #757 ---
Cheelu

if you see this post, just do it at the next bar/candle - no biggie. I think will be better that way in order to create a code for the indi.

I just want to point out that people get all mixed up on counting how many candles they need to count for a pullback.

A pullback could have so many bars up to a point it could become a reversal...who knows???

You guys just need to focused on be in position in order to catch the follow-thru move...that's it..

hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #758 ---
My results so far have been mixed.  At times the volatility has help as in my 229 PIP GBPJPY trade.  But the wild rides do play havoc at times.

--- 帖子 #759 ---
well...I can see that.

So you're doing some sort of research on ASIA Session/ still to early to come up to a conclusion or do you think so far is worth to trade it???

Please advise.

--- 帖子 #760 ---
Hi Nomo,

for the purposes of the indicator, only the START of the pullback will be identified.

to summarize, to identify that pullback start candle, we look for a bearish candle (for long breakouts) and bullish candle (for short breakouts).

--- 帖子 #761 ---
There you go my friend...

That's all we need...

Plain and simple..

--- 帖子 #762 ---
yeah, i'm up in the air still.....so far it has been profitable, AUDUSD and GBPJPY have been performing well.

--- 帖子 #763 ---
Here are my stats so far with regard to Asian session so far

This includes the 200+ PIP GBPJPY trade.

Hi cheelu,

The indicator is great but when I try to apply it to only the 5 and 15 min charts it shows up on every time frame. Why don't the visualization parameters work?

--- 帖子 #770 ---
Nomo and all...

Thanks for the input and especially the clarification on the pullback candles Nomo.  Cheerlu, the indicator is great.  My results have been mixed - more because of interruptions than enything else.

My question has to do with times for the breakout boxes everyone is using.  I believe there are no 'Official Nomoretoxic' times.  I have been using one hour before and one hour, 5 minutes after the market opening.  (London and New York mainly)  Is this the time everybody else is using?

Also, how long is everybody monitoring the box?  I have been using only 2 hours but I believe some are using longer.

Finally - which pairs seem to work best?  I have been trying to stay with the majors but look like I have missed some pretty good action in other pairs.

Thanks

Hello T.

One logic behind the box is to identify periods of consolidations followed by breakouts. It's definitely hard to tell as the markets will do whatever. So we can only make an educated guess and take every session's change as a benchmark.

Some people will have different results and honestly, if you try to be at either side, will probably make you crazy. The best we can do is try to match it up in order to be singing the same song.

This style of trading is not completely mechanical. Therefore discipline must be applied. I began to be profitable when I took time to trade this system (no distractions) and applied the rules no matter wining or losing ...every day like a clock.

About pairs, my experience has been better since I trade only EUR/USD. I found on this pair more stability with a lot less fake outs.

Hope it helps

--- 帖子 #773 ---
Appreciate the quick response.

T...

--- 帖子 #774 ---
Well first off let me thank Nomoretoxic for the solid and simple trading strategy.  Unfortunately I haven't been able to test it out first hand, as I've been reading through the entire thread for the past few days, and I don't think I am going to try anything on a Sunday.

At first I had some confusion as to when the box should start, especially considering that so many people are at least slightly different times, but I've figured out that it's not really a hard and fast rule of Nomoretoxics on when to start the box.  Really something that you just have to judge for yourself on.

My main concern however is with the Asian session.  Unfortunately for me, it's the only session that I'm going to get to trade in.

I noticed that RRothschild has been testing it out and has admittedly had mixed results with it.  RRothschild has however mentioned that there were two pairs thus far that had done fairly well.  My thought is that maybe those two pairs should be the one's that are focused on during the Asian session.

Maybe RRothschild, if you don't mind, can crunch the numbers (success rate & average pip result) of just those two pairs during his trades from the Asian session.  It may just be that there are only two that work effectively during the Asian session.  Not that it would be a bad thing however, Nomoretoxic admits himself that he only focus' on EUR/USD.  Just having two to pay attention to begin with would be easier anyways.  I guess I would just like to know RRothschild's actual #'s with his two most successful pairs during the Asian session.

Thanks everyone for all the continued examples of how this strategy works.  Awesome thread............and long too.

--- 帖子 #785 ---
thx nomore for this system,but i will lik to advise traders of this system to stick to a particular currency(i think EU is the best) and trade it, and also let go for 1:2 risk/reward ratio,meaning that u only need one win to cover  for 2 losses.

i.e. we are looking for this system to work 50% of the time,if it works 50% of the time we have 100% at 1:2(risk:reward) then the other 50% loss has been covered for,at the end of the day we are all happy wth a 50% gain.

RRothschild,

Thank you for the rundown of the current stats from your Asian session trials.  Though, like you said, it's a small sample size it should give me a fair idea of where to start my testing at.......narrow it down, so I'm not trying to watch 10 different pairs just to figure out which one/two are truly effective.

I'll start my testing on tonights Asian session.  One more thing though, where to you have your box for the Asian session starting at?  I was thinking of having my box start at the start of the Aussie session and then look to start trading at the open of the Asian.

Hello,

I have made a small contribution to the thread.

Put the attention breakout wav file in your metatrader sounds folder.Rename alert to alertold and rename attention breakout to

alert.wav

Insert the chin breakout alert and calibrate the upper and lower breakout lines five pips higher and lower of your breakout box.

Now you can control all the 7 majors while not in front of your pc.

Apply 15 tp 15 sl and lock your profits at 7pips .

--- 帖子 #799 ---
I noticed that too.

I just went ahead and done up the box and everything myself, rather than try and figure out how to make it work properly for the Asian session. Although that could just be because I'm lazy.

P.S. Asian market not looking pretty for my first run right now. Already got stopped out of GBP/USD......Although I only went 20 S/L & 20 T/P instead of actually putting the S/L in a safe place.

Just went ahead with the 1:1 R/R approach with my first attempt at things.

Got stopped out on GBP/JPY just now too.....*EDIT*::  Just noticed I should never had been in this trade, oops!

Still getting a feel for things too, so some of this is likely my mistakes.

Also running myself a little crazy paying attention to 4 pairs, can't wait till I get it narrowed down to 1 or 2.

--- 帖子 #802 ---
Do you require your retrace to go all the way back to the box?

Regardless, I think I had my box placed at a bad two hour time span....Pretty much everytime one would have done just enough to enter a trade, but then turned straight back the other way for a solid run......Having my box start either 1 hour later or earlier would have kept me out of the trade.  On AUD/USD it would have actually set me up for a successful trade if I'd set it up for the earlier time frame.

Lesson learned.  Now I just have to decide which way I want to change it.......earlier or later.

Loophole,

Are considering the candle that didn't go quite as long as the one before it a retrace candle, even though it finished as bearish?

I always went with a candle that closed in the opposite direction as a retrace. I might have to keep notes on that however.

I'm not getting in until 1.29985 myself.

FYI, keep an eye out on the U/C pair.

--- 帖子 #818 ---
Wish I could help ya, but I'm still trying to really figure that out myself.

I'm currently using 17:25 - 19:30

Though I don't believe anyone else is. Just testing a theory that came to my head........from absolutely zero information, just popped in there.

UPDATE:: A/U just brokeout, next candle has started off as a re-trace...

UPDATE II ::  3 trades entered...... +66.3 Pips

EUR/USD - Open @ 22:15 Eastern U.S. time

Enter: 1.29985

Stop Loss: 1.30325

Take Profit: Actually I just manually closed this.......well all three actually.

Closed: 1.29617 @ 22:28 : *+36.8*

GBP/USD - Open @ 22:24

Enter: 1.65061

Stop Loss: 1.69585

Closed: 1.64970 @ 22:29 : *+9.1*

USD/CAD - Open @ 22:26

Enter: 1.21602

Stop Loss: 1.21445

Closed: 1.21806 @ 22:30 : *+20.4*

NOTE::  All of these could have been better, U/C & G/U especially, but I am a bit lost on working the trailing stop with FXCM......Yes I abandoned MetaTrader after just one day......I'm more familiar and comfortable with FXCM's Marketscope 2.0, with the exception of the "trailing stop".

SO if anyone can assist me with their trailing stop, it'd be much appreciated.  Thanx.

And now that I was trading on a platform I'm comfortable with, and felt more confident with using.....I can praise the system introduced to us by Nomoretoxic......Even if it is really just day one of success, yesterday I was too lost to count so I'm giving myself a mulligan.

Here's an advice that will save you many headaches (and $$$).

Trailing stop off 5 minutes charts will lead you to the land of frustration so quickly you won't look back at trading again.

When I started on the box, I knew by heart it was a profitable system because for the first time something made sense to me. That's the reason I didn't bother to backtest. Many years later, it paid off big time.

But.....

two things almost put my trading to rest, using the box.

1)Straight breakouts. A true killer. Just look back on my post how many fakeouts I pointed out.

2)Trailing stops. Oh man this is a real bummer. You have no idea how many times I trailed the stops (in all shapes and  flavors) just to see me like an idiot,   how the market went in my favor afterward.

At the beginning of this thread I didn't put much weight on trade management. I suggested a 1:1 risk/ratio and I also said that 20 pips is attainable with this system. I can't  recall right now but for some of you keeping a record, if I ever suggested even indirectly trailing stops for this system, please disregard that line.

Summarize - stick to your guns and once you have an order in place, let the market do whatever....You'll see it's better that way eventually.If you fell of and have a scratch on your knees, well get up, lick up your wounds and keep on running.

Hope it helps.

Very hard to tell..You'll be surprise on those large candles,how many good trades you can take.

--- 帖子 #824 ---
As for the trailing stop thing though.......I was just interested in it because I'm just looking for the 20 pip gain initially, and anything after that is gravy.  If I locked in my 20 pips and then set my trailing stop and it stopped me out for a total of only 25 pips (only 5 pips more, or even less really) and then the market went back in my favor for what would have landed me 50+ more extra pips, I wouldn't think twice about having used the trailing stop.  I still made my 20 pips that I wanted.

Kinda like playing poker, once you fold your hand don't second guess that same hand next time just because after all was said and done you would have won the pot.  Chances are more likely that folding that hand saves you more money than it's going to win you.

I'm still new to the forex, so whenever I see profits go from 30 pips back down to the 20 or below range, it's VERY difficult to ride it out and hope for the best.  I get trigger happy and close the trade out to secure the profits.

I'm certain with experience, I'll be able to decide which one's to try and ride out and which one's to go ahead and take what I got.

Again, thanks for the advice though.

Just a reminder. A false breakout.

PD Someone asked me privately if I have something hidden in my sleeve in order to lure people into "charging" for something more.

Publicly I have to say I won't.....I don't need to...

Trading is good to me.

Knowledge is free. Just follow the rules and you'll come up ahead.

Hi Nomo,

Do you not lock in any profit before your target ? even if your target is like 60 pips.

I usually set my stop loss 5 pips above the highest level of the pull back plust spread - and how many ever pips that stop loss is, that is what I make my take profit, so my R/R is 1 to 1. I usually place my stop at b/e even at about 20 pips and little bit more for the cable because it swings a little more.

Loophole,

Yeah you're right. But like Nomo has said, I don't get too hung up on the range times. I have taken trades 2/3 of the way into the box if I like the price action...

--- 帖子 #833 ---
I agree, the box size does not matter.

--- 帖子 #834 ---
whatever broker you used had vastly different prices than myself.  Right after the false Breakout around the 1.2730 my prices never went any lower, while yours went for a positive pip gain.

Don't look like I'm going to be making any trades in tonights Asian session.

I have my box end 30 min's prior to the open of the Asian session.  No in depth strategical reason, just a theory I'm forward testing.

--- 帖子 #835 ---
For the lowest spreads, I use ODL for Asia session, and Oanda for London and NY session.

...apologies if this has been covered elsewhere, haven't read it in the thread yet...is it best to let open London trades run to conclusion even if they overlap New York, or is there a cut off point? (edit: ...market might just have answered my question )

I used to trade a volatility expansion breakout strat (GU only) around the 5am-8am(UK) range and let open trades run to 4pm (UK) or until ADR was hit, whichever came first. I didn't have the discipline back then to trade VEBO through ranging periods...really knocked my confidence.

Buy EURUSD

e - 1.2844

tp - 1.2914

closed 1.2868

r/r target was 2:1, moved SL to 25 PIPs profit once I had 1:1.  tried to get more and got closed out.  Max profit was during this trade 45 PIPs

--- 帖子 #845 ---
Hi, would you mind giving your rationale for the initial sl above the round number?

--- 帖子 #846 ---
I put the entry order in after the close of the 09:10 EST candle.  My SL was below the low of the retrace candle.

When the trade went live I made the decision to leave the sl unchanged because of the way the trade was playing out.  Higher highs and higher lows, even on pull backs.

--- 帖子 #847 ---
thanks RR.

--- 帖子 #848 ---
In your experience, is it worth re-entering trades in the same direction if stopped out on the 1st attempt, or best to max out at 2 trades per day, 1 in each direction if offered?

--- 帖子 #849 ---
In my experience, I have not entered a second trade in the same direction.  I have played both sides of the box however.

Based on the idea that a box can be made in any area of consolidation, I guess that it is possible.  Perhaps NOMO will chime in on this one?

RR -

--- 帖子 #850 ---
I have a rule...two strikes in one day and I call it off. I try to shoot for 2:1 R/R ..I say I try 'cause not always it's possible.

About entering at the same  direction if stopped out, I have never done it.

I manage to trade both sessions, London and NY and I always manage to either have two strikes or make my goal. No need to re-entry at the same direction I was stopped out. I have seeing it but by the time it happens,  my play was already done.

My opinion is that, if fits your bill, money management wise, go for it. As long  as you don't exceed your daily limit.

Hope it helps.

Can you please explain your MM strategy? In the past you have been very strict about 3 items:

- You always shoot for 20 pips profit - no more no less - always 20 pips.

- Never use a trailing stop

- When price action warrants a stop loss of more than 20 pips, you will decrease the lots traded to account for worse than 1:1 R/R ratio.

I'm just trying to understand your statement above about 2:1 R/R. Has your MM rules changed due to market conditions?

Thanks in advance for your answer to my question.

Cheerlu

My suggestion would be to keep the EA very simple.  This is a very simple, straight-forward system.  The only choices (other than those in the indicator) I can think of would be:

1.  Size of the stop-loss if not letting your indicator set it.

2.  Size of order.  (Let the user determine the amount of risk)

3.  Take profit amount, in number of pips.

4.  Whether to take a 2nd entry or not in the same direction. (I really am not sure about this one.)

If you would like to add any other features, I would wait until the first effort had been beta and live tested by several different people on several different broker's platforms.

I would be more than happy to test the EA once you feel it is ready.  Again, I think you would be saving yourself many hours of frustration by keeping this EA just a simple as possible.

Here is a revised version of my generic breakout EA. I've run this for a few days and it works well.

If anyone has a problem with it, don't simply say it's wrong. Tell me what is wrong, is it the range-finding? Is it the entry price? Show me if you can, the comments in the upper left corner tell you everything the EA is thinking.

Guys

Some people have asked me about my money management rules. I've been giving bits here  and there about how I do. I am going to lay down a nice document including all my rules and how to apply them,  during this weekend. I will open up a new thread maybe in the rookie's section.

Stay Tuned.

--- 帖子 #865 ---
I'll try to get that chart up for you, but it won't be until later this evening.........Whenever I get back home.  I'm currently at work.

Just some notes real quick though.......I use FXCM, my box time is from 17:25 - 19:30 Eastern U.S. time.  My guess is that the start and end time of my box is the main difference here.

--- 帖子 #866 ---
Hi Jnatty you are correct that is the reason the time frame for the box I use from 18pm to 20pm EST.

Thank you

E

--- 帖子 #867 ---
Hi Nomoretoxic,

First let me thank you for your strategy and your wisdom.

I've been studying breakouts for a while now, even as to test different theories for the past year with different TP and SL. Success ratio varies from 50% to 75% but spreads usually kill the deal and the losses are too close to the wins for it to be a successful long term strategy. (Trading bare NY box breakouts) Were the spreads to get tighter it would make those strats viable.

I'm very interested in hearing more about your money management and the % of average growth and success rate you get per month using this strategy.

The # of pips that people are saying they're making doesn't mean anything because we don't know the % of risk involved.

--- 帖子 #868 ---
You welcome!!!

I understand completely.

As I said,  I will prepare something  on money management with all bells n' whistles. .. I'll be in another thread.

stick around.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #869 ---
Do you mean the % risk or the lot size?

Size of the order would be determined automatically based on the stop loss , AccountBalance and % risk

Thats what Nomo means when he says adjust the load accordingly.

--- 帖子 #870 ---
Sorry - I really was not very clear...

I favor making the user specify the lot size. This may be a slight variation from the 'adjust the load' method - however it will save countless questions about how the lot size was figured.

making the change from using lot size to using risk % can always be added later. I just think the simpler you make the initial EA, the better.

As always - thank you Cheerlu - and everyone else who takes the time to post - for your time and efforts...

http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...62#post2303362

Are you worried if the same could happen to your system Nomo?

Should we 'protect' EAs  somehow?

--- 帖子 #872 ---
The best way to protect free EAs from being stolen is to really distribute them everywhere. If you see a commercial version of a free EA, put the free EA next to it. There's really not much else you can do.

--- 帖子 #873 ---
I have to agree with Ronald.

Just go ahead and give it away for free. 95% (hahaha) of the people that lose a couple of times using this system will move to the next combination of oscillators and moving averages.....Mark my words.

We're the other 5%.

--- 帖子 #874 ---
Ok my first yr trading and am a bit confused... I live in UK, just switched back to GMT.. will box time still be between:

5am-7am GMT for London Session?

11am-1pm GMT for New York Session?

Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #875 ---
For the London session, I believe that NOMO created the box to capture 6am to 8am (London Daylight Savings Time).  Since we are going back to Standard time... it seems logical to make the London box 6am to 8am GMT. (GMT and London time are now the same).

For the New York session, we Americans are still on DST....so, keep the box as you mentioned above until we also go back to standard time.

Hope I am correct and hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #876 ---
I was trying to post the chart that "evasz" requested from Thursday's Asian session, but I obviously don't know how.

If anyone is familiar with how to accomplish this using FXCM, I would appreciate the help.

--- 帖子 #877 ---
Wouldn't it be easier if we just stated when the box starts?  By this I mean, if it starts an hour before the open of the London session or starts at the open of the London session.........

I just think that by using this approach the time zone confusion will be eliminated.  I know it screw's me all up trying to figure out EST & GMT and whether or not its DST.

--- 帖子 #878 ---
Hi Jnatty thank you for your concern but at this point it is all right if you can't do it, on the weekend I had a chance to looked at my chart and compare with your numbers with the time difference and its all make sense now.

Thanks anyway.

Good deal, sitting here just watching this Sunday session......even though I'm on a demo account......Not sure I'd be interested in trading live on Sunday's.

The of the pairs I'm watching have broken out, and all have now retraced.  Though the G/U & E/U have broken out by 50+ pips, so I'd be iffy if I was trading these.  A/U looks alright, except now it's in a steep retrace.....so the S/L would likely be set a heft distance away.

Yeah, Sunday look like a little TOO much excitement for me.

hi Nomo,

once we close a trade for a profit in a certain direction, if the market pullsback again and breaks out in the same direction again (this time a new pullback - breakout entry ) , would u enter the position again? kind of like adding to winning positions strategy

--- 帖子 #883 ---
I don't do it.

In my case I have more opportunities as I play both London and NY session.

The problem with a re-entry is the lack of volatility during certain periods.

A play on NY session after 12:00 PM becomes risky as the time passes. Anything after 2:00 pm I prefer not to take it.

A play in London session close to 8:00 am is risky as new money comes in.

So you take a re-entry and get stuck for hours with a huge risk of new money coming in. That way you'll turn a winner into a loser...been there many times.

Hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #888 ---
Nomoretoxic,

One thing I don't understand is the risk reward ratio when the pullback is far from the breakout peak. I mean I see pullbacks as far as 100 pips and yet aiming for only 20 pips profit. The risk far outweigh the reward. You'd need just one loss to undo the last 5 trades.

Is the success ratio of these so good that you always take these trades?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #889 ---
Although Nomoretoxic is likely better suited to answer the question based on his system.  I would imagine that entering such a trade that has a pullback of such length is up to your own decision.  Personally I don't like to pull the trigger on something that has such a LARGE retrace, or on one that has such a LARGE initial breakout.

My advice on such occurrences would be to, as Nomoretoxic says, "sit on your hands".

If the risks are too much for your own personal taste, then trust your gut.

I believe however that Nomoretoxic lessens the amount of lot's traded to lessen the blow in case of a loss.  Instead of trading 3 lots, he may just trade one and live with the results......win or lose.

--- 帖子 #890 ---
I use FXCM.  Just the nature of the day re: US pairs.  I enter the initial order on the close of the first pull back bar.  I set the SL and the TP once I get into the trade.

Listen guys.

The whole idea of 20 pips is for you to see there's consistency to a certain degree using this box. The real problem about systems/strategies etc. they work for a while but all of the sudden you get screwed. This is the whole reason why traders are jumping from system to system and losing money trying.

The real edge to me with any system is how to manage your trades. In my case, once you have a fill, there's nothing you can do, just sit and wait. I've been trading for years and, many times, I choose move my bracket (stops/targets),  I simply lose consistency.

As I said before, I am working on a lay out on money management.

PD: sit on your hands is a valid trade.

Stay Tuned

This message might be for cheelu. On G/U this morning, EA called breakout short at 1.5665, the next candle closed down, not up, but I believe the EA considered that a retracement candle, because the next candle down was signaled as the 2nd breakout candle. Do I have a wrong understanding of a retracement candle?  I believed it had to close in the opposite direction of the first breakout candle.  I'm sorry for no chart, I'm at work. I'm using Admiral Mkts, same as Nomo. This is the second time I've seen this and wanted to bring it to your attention. Thanks for all your help.Jim

Hi everyone,

here are my trades in this morning. I use cheelu's BOXBreakOut indicator. Thanks cheelu.

eurusd buy @ 1.3189 (+100)

sl: 1.3149

tp: 1.3289

usdcad sell @ 1.2030 (+69)

sl: 1.2076

tp: 1.2930

--- 帖子 #916 ---
ok, but if you did the same trade last week it would have been 08:35gmt does that matter? I realise that for "london" session your slot is 01:00-03:05est, I just need you to please confirm what we mean by "london session"... should we be saying "europe" or something...? The basis for this system is to track prices 2 hours prior to the "open". For NY its 07:00-09:00 local time est. So are we saying London opens at 07:00 gmt?

sorry, don't mean to pick at bones but I just need someone to set me straight, cheers....

I was actually a little nervous trading today because I had 10 winning trades in a row.  I was actually a little happy to have the loss in the USDCAD trade!

I thought that i was done for the day, but something may be brewing on the AUDUSD in the next few bars.  Let's see!

Are you trading live??

Just curious.

Thanks.

Yes, I'm trading live.

Hi RR, thank you for your information I check them every time I learn from them.

Can you please give me the information on the stopl. do you enter the sl prier to the trade come a live or just simple watching as it work it self and the right time you close the trade?

Thanks for your help.

--- 帖子 #921 ---
I understand your question now, and I'm not sure.  I will pm NOMO on this one, or maybe he will respond directly to this post.

As of right now, I have not made any adjustments for the fact that europe is on dst and here in the USA we're not yet.

If I still have your question incorrect please let me know.

RR -

--- 帖子 #922 ---
i enter the sl after I enter the trade. (if the chart is giving me an sl with too much risk i use 20 - 24 PIPs, depends on the pair and the type of trading day/week i'm having)

once i get up past 25 pips, i move the sl to a 25 pip profit

once i get to 1:1, i do the same

the tp is 2:1 at the beginning of the trade. i also mark the 25 ans 1:1 points on my graphs with horizontal lines.

At times you will notice that I end up with some strange stops these are due to the following:

- missed changing the sl and the trade moved against the sl i was going to set

- sometimes the moves of the trades are happening at the same time so i can't get to it in time

- slippage if it's a strong move

there are many times that i leave PIPs on the table using this method.  i average 7.79 PIPs left on the table per trade.

hope that this helps

We call it "London session" because normally is when the trades begin to appear.

Frankfurt session , I believe starts on 1:00 AM (please correct me if I'm wrong) normally lacks on push. This is where we position ourselves in reality.

On NY its slightly different. Although the session opens up @8:00 am, the influx of new trades on the overlap creates a wave that last 1 hour approximately.

Note the use of "normally" and "approximately"

In trading, there's nothing written on stone.

Hope it helps.

I appreciate your replies... many thanks

Hi Nomo,

Your method is very interesting to me and I have some questions:

1. Do you use fixed time periods for your boxes or do you choose them according to market condition on particular day?

2. Do you use 1:1 for your PT and ST or sometimes they are different?

If your answer is yes to the above questions then it is fully automated system and as we all know automated systems can not win in the long term. We can assume that the system has 50:50 losers to winners. So with 1:1 Stop loss to Ptofit target you should be break even at the best.

I wonder what is your winning percentage over the long term? What I am trying to find out is how much discretionary decision is involved in this system? Because I think only discretionary element can give you an edge using this system. But maybe sticking to your rules and not closing manually your open positions untill they are stopped or PT is triggered is part of the edge? For many people it is very hard to stick to that rule. But I don't think it is enough to win in the long term.

I would appreciate your comments.

Y.

When you read a book - do you read the first chapter and then the last chapter and ask someone to tell you about the middle?

If not, then do not treat this thread (or any thread) that way.

There are almost 1000 posts to this thread over the past several months, discussing this method. Please do us the courtesy of doing your homework first before posing questions that are answered numerous time throughout the thread.

RR, Tsquad, cheelu ..anyone following this method.

I would like to know how many pairs are you currently trading??

how are you spreading the risk across the board..??

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #929 ---
I would like to thank you for your system, and the way that you manage this thread.

I'm 100% with you about indicator, ma, bla , blah

As you said>I use London session. My box is from 1:30 AM EST to 3:30 AM EST.. not a hard and fast rule. You can play around with it.

NY session, I use 7:00AM EST to 9:00 AM EST

I have account with oanda and I set the platform time at EST or NY time.

So the london box will be 1:30 / 3:30 AM EST and ny box 7:00 / 9:00 am EST

I'm doing ok?

thanks

--- 帖子 #930 ---
You're on the right track my friend.

Welcome to the thread.

--- 帖子 #931 ---
Nomo and all...

Because of my schedule, I have traded mainly the US open the past couple of weeks.  I also use a lot of discression over trades I take versus ones I let pass by.  That being said, over the the past couple of weeks, here are the pairs I traded with this method:

GBPUSD

EURUSD

USDJPY

GBPJPY

EURJPY

USDCHF

EURGRP

As far as risk, I try to limit myself to 4% per breakout period, making sure I do not exceed the 3% on a particular currency per breakout.  Said another way, if both the GBPUSD and EURUSD give a bullish signal, I will either spread the 3% risk out between the two pairs OR trade just the pair that I felt the best about.  That way, if the USD was to strengthen, I would not be out more than the 3%.  I allocate risk according to how confident I am in a particular move.

I know that Nomo says not to worry about the trend, but that is a old habit that I have not yet broken.  I am more likely to take a trade that is moving the same direction as the trend and also risk more on that trade than one moving against the trend.  When I say risk more, I mean both in risk % and also risk reward ratio.

Final note, I do watch risk vs. reward and will sometimes bend the method  parameters to make the trade, again if I feel very good about it.  For example, if I am looking to capture 20 pips but the last level of support or resistance level was 100 pips away, I might still enter the order with a 40 or 60 pip SL.

The biggest danger I face trading this or any method is overtrading.  Right now I am averaging about 3 winners for every loser.  Therefore, I better be very sure about a trade with anything above a 3:1 risk reward ratio.  I am still very new to this system and do not take all trades in live accounts.

Hope this helps

Hi Nomo,

You may have mentionned it before and if so I apologize in advance.

When looking back to last year's data it seems this method doesn't work nearly as well as the market conditions seem too thin.

Have you been trading that method in those conditions or is it a method that is more suitable to volatile markets such as the current market?

--- 帖子 #933 ---
I believe that targets were shorter last year. This year most definitely had bigger ranges.

I did good on this method last year. I have to look back but I believe my targets were shorter and many times I went off-balance. Sorry, but I really don't keep any records other than P/L's.

I use the box and I also have a counter-trend method I use. Daily market conditions are hard to gauge. But here's a hint.

One thing I found useful is having the box closing at 9:00 AM. I think most likely the first hour of NY session defines the rest of the day - note I use the word "most likely"...anything can happens..

It all depends on what session you're trading. Like if you are trading NY session, most likely, what happens on London Session becomes useless.

Markets are living things. The contract and expand and trust me,  it's really a loser's game trying to predict what will happen next.  Especially ranges. Sometimes, E/U goes over 100 pips daily range, sometimes it goes way below that. I give like 1 week leeway to make sure there's an increase/decrease in range and then I adjust my targets accordingly. It's not a hard and fast rule.

My goal is to get 2:1 . As I stated before, sometimes you just can't get it.

Please don't hesitate to ask, I'll do my best..promise.

cheers.

Currently trading 6 pairs:

EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDCAD, GBPJPY, AUDUSD and USDCHF.

I'm at 1 - 2 % risk per trade.  Overall win rate is 3:1.  Average win 39 pips average loss 26 pips.  Using my 25 PIPs, 1:1 and 2:1 SL moving scheme i leave about 7.9 pips on the table per trade.

--- 帖子 #936 ---
Please understand - I am not being critical.  I am very much from the school of "if it ain't broke don't fix it..." Your numbers indicate you are doing very well.  But I do have one question:

5 of the 6 pairs include the USD.  Do you limit your risk exposure during a particular session?  A 'whipsaw' concerning the dollar pairs could cost you 5 to 10% (1 - 2% each pair) of your account.

Thanks for your input...

--- 帖子 #937 ---
I hear you.  Just reporting what I'm doing now.  It's not for everyone and not what NOMO recommends, nor am I recommending it.

Surprisingly, I'm usually not in many of these trades at the same time.  Many of my trades only last for about 5 - 10 minutes and I'm out.  Also, many times a move in EUR, for example, is mirrored in the GBP, but one is happening outside the box and the other may be inside the box so I only have one position open.

I guess that I should add that EURUSD and GBPUSD are my priority.  EURUSD for the smaller spread and GBPUSD for the bigger daily range.  My daily goal is 25 pips so everything else goes into the "bank."

Hi NOMO!

I only looked at your system the last three month or so. I started trading 8 years ago and lost all my capital because of greed. You’re not the first person that were “pissed of” excuse the words by someone that doesn’t appreciate a guys opinion and understand were he is coming from

For a while I haven’t even looked at the market again. All I can say is your system made me positive to trading again.

I can see many of the other persons don’t follow your suggestions on the dot. It might work for them and we can even learn from them.

I just want to thank you for your system and input. It will be a loss if you don’t post anymore.

And thanks for all the others for their input, it is appreciated but please keep the negativity for yourselfs.

I like reading all the posts and enjoy all the results posted.

Keep up the good work!!!

Thanks for sharing...

Both of these JPY pairs ended up at a profit of 20 pips....

No Problem. Always happy to help.

I am glad I make you look back into trading.

Once you have a trade going on, chances are 50% of either winning or losing.  My real "edge" (if we can call it that way) is money management. That's the tool I use to survive in this business.

I post here from time to time. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. I am glad you took the time and read the thread.

This thread has made me realize how profitable trading on retracements can be.

I guess it made me notice those small but very frequent retracements in trending markets that provide opportunity to enter and exit with a profit.

Distracted during NY Session and didn't get to make the GBPUSD trade that I saw around 10a est.  Not sure if there were any other opportunities.  I must have been tired this morning during this trade because I did make 25 PIPs and completely missed it, not my best trading.  It happens, that trade should have closed for at least 20 pips profit.

Hi everyone:

Big thanks to everyone, especially nomo, I'm finally in the positive with my trading thanks to you. Question for Cheelu. I attached a chart of last night's London session and the EUR. I hope you can see the indicator gave a green check at the first breakout, then a second check at the breakout after the pullback, but the alert didn't signal until the 4th candle later, during another breakout. Am I misunderstanding, or should it have signalled at the second breakout. Thanks for all your help

Jim

--- 帖子 #944 ---
First off...I would like to thank Nomo and others who generously contribute to this thread. This system, combined with a couple other "price action only" systems I follow, have completely changed and enlightened my perception of positive trading.

I was curious to know if the creators of the alert indicator/EA could add email or text mail notifications to when the breakouts occur...particulary the first breakout. I try to monitor trades from the box end, until a valid trade opportunity, but the 9 to 5 gets in the way sometimes. Having an email or text alert might make it easy to work and still catch the moves.

Looking forward to the future of this thread and system.

--- 帖子 #945 ---
Scratch the last post request for email/text notifications.  Went back and played with it a little more and found an incorrect setting.  It's working now.  Just got a GU Long Break.

Hi Folks:

Looking at the attached chart, could anyone tell me why the alert didn't consider the second breakout at 1.5981 as valid. It put a green check mark on it, but didn't send a alert and if you read it you'll see it says it's still waiting for a breakout. Especially curious about what chellu has to say. Thanks

Jim

--- 帖子 #951 ---
Hi folks:

Please see previous post about the cable, this is the EUR from the same session. You can see the second breakout and the check mark, but no alert and nothing written on the screen noting a breakout. Any help would be appreciated.

Hi Cheelu:

Nice moves on U/J and U/Cad this morning.  The NFP report made the range spreads on the G/U and E/U too big to trade in my opinion.

--- 帖子 #961 ---
Evasz,

Since you are only going for a 20 pip PT, how do you determine your stop loss?  Last swing, 1:1, mental stop, other.

I like the 20 PT idea as well.  However with the big moves in price action these days, I worry that a bounce off the buy/sell price will come back 20+ pips before going back the right direction.  At 1:1 it's toast.  What is your win rate?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #962 ---
Hi Hellcat I'm very new here just learning, ok the only time I take the trade jet where I see the brake out candle is not exceed 30 pips so my st is at the other side of the brake out candle,also I look at the pullback candle I like to see when the pullback candle happen and close outside of the box that gives me more confirmation to take the trade since my st is small, the mental st dose not work for me I tried and I always last big amount.

As I said earlier I'm just practicing I learn a lot from some of the good traders here thanks for Nomo and all of you.

I just found this thread last week and have been following it.

I just got out of a short trade on the EUR/USD on break of NY 7:00 - 9:00 box.

Got in at 1.2857 and after got to 20 pips profit, trailed the stop 20 pips. Finally stopped out at 1.2821 for 36 pip profit.

System is easy to follow. I made one stupid mistake that cost me 20 pips. I KNEW there would be strong support at 1.2800 and I should have put TP there but was foolishly hoping for miracle and long runner.

Thanks for the system and all the information in the thread.

Hi Swakop - nice trades but I have some questions:

1 - was your early g/u trade a classic box-trade? if so, what times do you use to construct your London/Europe box?

2- your u/cad trade, wouldn't you enter at the breakout high plus spread as your entry price? Same goes for any buy trades but in particular those pairs with the bigger spreads. Or was the 1.1838 entry the bid (sell) price?

Regards

Gossy

Good Monday morning (NY session).  Classic set ups on e/j, e/u, u/cad.  Closed out at +20 on each pair within a short period of time.   See attached charts.  Yeah....I could have gone for more, but the 9 to 5 kept me busy.

Hi Gossy,
1 - was your early g/u trade a classic box-trade? if so, what times do you use to construct your London/Europe box?

I use for this trade my asian box - 00:00 til 01:59 gmt. I trade this box til 06:30 gmt

My European box 04:55 til 6:59 gmt.

2- your u/cad trade, wouldn't you enter at the breakout high plus spread as your entry price? Same goes for any buy trades but in particular those pairs with the bigger spreads. Or was the 1.1838 entry the bid (sell) price?

Breakout plus/minus spread, buy orders once more spread.

I've always E/U 2 pips, G/U 3 pips and U/C 3 pips spread.

I hope, I could help.

Hello All,

I was sidetracked last week.  I did trade, but missed many of the good ones.  It also reminded me that the system can be great, but you are still the determining factor.

Simply said, while I made 161 pips last week, I feel as though my "trading" and decision making was poor because i wasn't focused.

Seems like everyone was doing well last week.  Congrats!

Hi All,

- I am in the UK using Alpari.uk broker which is GMT+1. Does my morning box begin from 7-8:59 (local time)

- How do you determine the TP (and hence the SL) to get a risk reward ? Or do you say the SL is x pips therefore i will TP at the same level to get 1:1 rr

Sorry if these questions simple

Thank you for your time

Good "trading" day for me today (+50 pips on 2 trades).  Missed other opportunities but stuck to my rules.  The London trade was good for another 35 pips and the NY trade eventually hit my original tp.

Good trading to everyone!

Thanks Jim..that seems like the best solution.

Another issue I am having is if I draw any objects on my chart like trend lines, they disappear when I change time frames and go back to my 5 minute chart. Any one else had that problem with the Boxbreakout indicator?

--- 帖子 #992 ---
That will be fixed in the next version.

also planning to include the alert functionality in the indicator itself.

--- 帖子 #993 ---
Hi NerryE,

yes, I use this indicator, the BoxBreakOut by Cheelu. Can you take up this indicator?

Hi RR..

You seem to be one of the most consistent and profitable traders using this methodology. Have you changed/adjusted the times of your boxes since the time changes in October? If so, what times are you using now?

For the direction of the breakout do you trade only in the direction of the daily trend or do you just trade the breakout no matter what direction it is as long as it's a valid breakout?

--- 帖子 #996 ---
hi swakop

when i look at your last trade i think i m missing something , so it would be great if you can explain it to me .

i see that you consider the breakout at the green line and not at the breaking of the box limit and you place your entry so high above on the green line .

why not immediatly after the pullback candle .

thanks

--- 帖子 #997 ---
Hi imad,

I've set the "BoxBreakOut offset" on 3 pips. That was a long trade and I added once again 3 pips for the spread.

Cheers, swakop

Hi Folks:

Question for Nomo, or anyone who wants to answer. I'm on EST, and the London Box is from 1:00-3:00 A.M., the NY box starts at 7:00 A.M. EST. Do you let the london box overlap past 7:00, or do you figure that if there is no trade signalled by the London box by 7:00, start over with the NY box. Hope this question makes sense, thanks again to everyone, I'm actually having a great month because of all the people here, thanks.

Jim

--- 帖子 #1000 ---
I actually won't take a trade after 5p usually.  I've never had a trade last from the London to the NY session yet.

Lots of wild swings today.  I left my GBPUSD trade in place for too long in my opinion, as I took the trade 2 hours after the initial bko and pull back.  I should have re-evaluated the trade.

RR -

--- 帖子 #1002 ---
I've made no change to my box times.  I trade whichever way the box guides me to.  Sometimes I've actually sold and bought the same pair in one day during the different sessions.

Hope that this helps,

--- 帖子 #1003 ---
Jim

The logic behind 7:009:00 am est -

Very much follows the all so-called theory about the opening breakout. Well, not exactly, but has the same foundation.

See, normally NY-London overlap creates a huge mass of traders investors, looking to position themselves at the first hour of the overlap.Pretty much they set the tone for the rest of the day.

We wait a reasonable time - maybe 9:00 - 9:30 to make our play.

By that time, the smoke has cleared and we can see better.

Also, most big announcements are due @8:30 am, giving us reasonable time for the dust to clear.

Please note the bold "normally" in bold....anything goes...we don't know the future...but it's a pretty good average.

hope it helps.

cheers!!!!

Hi Nomo

I was wondering if you wouldnt mind help answering my questions if you have the time

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1005 ---

I meant after 5am not 5pm.

--- 帖子 #1006 ---
Hi:

I figured as much, thanks for all the help you give.

Jim

--- 帖子 #1007 ---
I apologize not to reply earlier.....the only excuse I have is just overlooked your post(sorry, I am a honest guy)

The easiest way to explain it is to look at cheelu's indicator. The dotted line is where you suppose to place your stop-loss. The logic is simple: the indicator looks for a reasonable last swing high/low to place the stop. You can do it without the indicator,following the logic.

As for take profit, at the beginning I stated that the box at least delivers 20 pips consistently. But  of course, you can shoot for more.

I personally look for a R/R of 2:1.

Hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #1008 ---
Hi Nomo and RR,

Do you have any guidelines about how large the box range can be before you consider it too big to trade a breakout? For example, the 2 hour range is 100 pips, would you still take a trade if price breaks out from that range or would you sit that one out based on how far price has already moved for that day?

I would assume the smaller the range the bigger the breakout?

--- 帖子 #1009 ---
My advice: don't pay attention to the range of the box.

That's over-thinking.

Play the pullback-continuation as soon as the box ends.

Just look on where the price is heading inside the box and be ready for the pullback.

Simple and easy.

The rest is overkill.

hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #1010 ---
i concur with NOMO.

i personally don't pay attention to the range in the box.

I use it mainly as a guide.  A narrow or wide range does tell you something, but it doesn't tell you whether there will be a good breakout or not.

I took a look at my trades and I have had good trades on both narrow and wide boxes.  This includes a NOMO's bko-continuation and my straight bko strategy that I used in the past.

what i don't like to see are lots of spikes in the box.

Hope this helps,

RR -

Thank you both - you are excellant teachers

Would love to buy you guys a coffee if ever in London !

--- 帖子 #1012 ---
Hi Nomo,

Do you at any point adjust your stop loss to breakeven before taking your profit.

Also, thanks a lot for the detailed MM rules.  You mentioned 2% risk per day, 1% per trade, is that 2% per session NY and London in your case or 2% for both sessions combined.  I only trade the NY session, I'm sleeping during the london session and the Asian session doest have enough volume for the 2 pairs that I trade.  I was wondering if I should increase that 1% to 1.5% or 2%, since I only trade one session.

Thanks,

--- 帖子 #1013 ---
actually shouldn't the london box be from 2-4AM EST?

Jim

--- 帖子 #1027 ---
Hi Jim,

I dont understand your question. Are u talking about where to enter ur email address etc.?

--- 帖子 #1028 ---
As for MM% if you're comfortable with less than 2% risk, it's acceptable on my view. Just be ware that risk is measured proportionally with reward. One goes with the other.

As for trailing stop, it's hard to tell. Personally, I don't do it at least using the box.

Hope it helps.

I don 't post as much nor a broker yet I use this strategy. As for me intraday trading is a no-man's land in all markets, not just forex. The only time I go down in time frame is on fed announcements. To each of its own.

To whoever is profitable on 5-30 minutes charts, my hats off to them. It all depends with your personality in my opinion. I like to trade stress-free and I love to place trades them after 00:00 GMT.

I prefer yen crosses.

It has worked for me

From your other posts I have the impression that you trade box system for couple of months now.

Don't get me wrong I am not saying the system is bad - it is good in good hands  but when you say you are consistently profitable with this system last year I need your explanation.

NOMO and CTGUY,

Okay...I am still confused about the box times as regards the Asian, London and New York Markets. Why is this not simple? Because of the confusion from some posts stating EST when we were still on EDT. Others have reported their broker's time which may be offset from GMT. And others are simply using different time frame boxes.

And of course, we are using 5 min charts with NONO and 15 minute charts with CTGUY. A pullback with one and no pullback with the other. Not to mention the offset buffer is 1 with CTGUY and 5 with NOMO.

So pretty please...will the both of you please state your starting and ending box times in GMT? This will forever end the confusion (I sincerely hope)!

Thanks in advance, fellas!

--- 帖子 #1046 ---
you are just adding to the confusion, this is nemo's thread not ctguy's, if you want to know CTGUY's time box read THE ENTIRE Big Dogs THREAD (yes it will take a couple of hours but it will be worth it) and you will have no further questions.

btw CTGUY's bigdogs is 7am-9am EST

--- 帖子 #1047 ---
Sorry if my request for clarity was inappropriate for you. I know others who are still confused over this issue.

BTW, I requested GMT not EST time. But, thanks, anyway.

However, you are INCORRECT and adding even more confusion. CTGUY's time frame runs from 7:00 AM EST through 9:14:59 AM EST, not what you posted.

Please make sure you know what you are talking about before criticizing others.

Have a GREAT day!

--- 帖子 #1051 ---
everyone knows that 7-9am technically means 7:00 - 9:14:59 when you look at the bars on MT4. but no1 says 7-9:14, we just say 7-9am and assume ppl know what we mean.

and the "others who are still confused over this issue" are those who are simply too lazy to read the entire thread of CTGUY's and nomo's and just want the easy way out, aka just ask the question without doing the work.

--- 帖子 #1052 ---
Maybe it's you who should reread my request. I never addressed you in the first place. You promptly posted incorrect information further comfusing the issue and were critical of my simple question for some clarity. Hint: no one likes to be lectured by someone who is both disrespectful and wrong at the same time. This is the last time I will address you.

Hello guys.

I believe this little system has served well to some people here. As I see, it has lost interest. Thanks to all of PM's with nice results. Has been my pleasure to help you all guys.

Nomo,

I want to express a huge Thank You for showing us this system. I have been using it now for about 3 weeks live and have been profitable each week. I am only using a minimal % of my account for now, but if the success rate continues I will gradually increase, as my comfort level increases.

In regards to your last post about closing the thread, I wonder if maybe you haven't been getting many comments because most everyone here is using it and doing well with it. It's simplicity of rules and execution are quite easy to apply, and really do not require much more explanation than what you've already provided. This is in fact the case with me anyway. I haven't been this excited about trading my live account since starting my forex learning some 3 years ago.

If you decide to open another thread, or any other medium, discussing your other methods, I would definately be eager to learn from your exeperience as you did with the mentor that helped you. My company is in the midst of a merger and my JOB future is in potential jeapordy. Finding the system could not have come at a better time. Again, many thanks!

--- 帖子 #1056 ---
Thank You Nomo for everything You have done , but if You decide to close this site , You will be Greatly Missed .

Well...no new posts since the first of the month. Is this thread still alive? I am sad if no one responds because nomotoxic's strategy is a real winner. I made LOTS of pips today on E/U.

One adjustment I make is to place two trades. The first trade is ala CTGUY's 15SL and 10TP. This strategy works when there is a strong initial spike. Often you easily make the 10 pips.

If the trade goes sour as in a false breakout, I go for 20 pips ala our leader, nomotoxic. This way when the second trade returns a profit, it wipes out the loss from the false breakout. I seldom have both systems losing on the same trade. Today, for exammple, on E/U, I made profits on both trades, including about 70 pips with nomo, by manually moving up my SL on Oanda.

I hope others respond to help strengthen our trading, because nomo has given us a GREAT way to trade and make pips!

Good trading everyone!

--- 帖子 #1080 ---
Hi folks:

Read whole thread couple of times, confused about two things.

1) A candle is a breakout when it breaks box by 1 pip, even if it closes back inside the box, correct? Pretty sure about this by would appreciate confirmation.

2) Retracement candle: We wait till the close. If breakout candle is long, a candle is considered retracement if it closes below the high of the breakout candle, even if the retracement candle might also be a positive candle, as long as the close is lower than any part of the breakout or the close of the breakout?

My confusion comes when the breakout candle is long and the retracement candle is also long, but lower then the breakout, thanks for all your help.

Jim

--- 帖子 #1081 ---
Hi Jim,

Here is my opinion and based on what Nomo said long time back

http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=762

1) Yes. as long as price touched 1 pip ( I use 5 pips) above the high , that's your breakout candle.

2) Then we start looking for retracement after this initial breakout. There is no direct relationship between the pullback candle and the breakout candle. the only relationship is the order of events. Initial Breakout first; then pullback .

What we are interested in is to identify the highest high / lowest low price made before the retracement candle happened. So to find that out we are only interested in identifying the START of the pullback. The pullback might take the price to anywhere within the box. We dont care about that.

and to identify the START of the pullback candle, the rule is

1) for long breakouts, look for a bearish candle . Whatever high price made up until this point will be ur entry price.

2) for short breakouts, look for bullish candle

i hope that helps.

Hello,

Just checking to see if anyone is still using this excellent system. Nomoretoxic has introduced us to a solid strategy that works. I have been using a similar strategy for many months and have achieved consistent profitability.

Whilst this trading method is very simple, it is not easy. It requires rigid discipline, patience and some amount of practice. It would be great to see this forum revived and those of us using this system participating actively so that we can all benefit.

fxpilot

--- 帖子 #1084 ---
Hi fxpilot,

I concur. This is an excellent thread. Let's keep it going!

As an incentive, if you were trading the New York Open this morning, you could have made a bagful of pips. I traded GU, EU and GJ totaling more than 300 pips!

I am sure some of us are still not clear on what constitutes a valid breakout candle. Some are using a simple price movement exceeding the high (with an offset of up to 5 pips). I'm not trading that way. I do use a 5 pip offset, but I wait for the candle to close outside the box to determine if it is a valid breakout or not. Nomo did say all calculations are based on candle CLOSES.

Please correct me if I am wrong.

Bob

--- 帖子 #1085 ---
Hi Bobcat,

Congrats on the pips earned. I agree with waiting for the candles to close. I trade only the GU and EU and today was very profitable...+200pips. Great trading!!

fxpilot

--- 帖子 #1086 ---
In the spirit of things...I got in on the EU as well and made my daily goal of 2% gain.

I have been gun shy of the GU lately as a few whipsaws have smoked my trades. However, I have not been waiting for the close of the second breakout candle. I might try that approach and see how it goes. Nice work everyone...

Hi folks:

Just wanted to post a winning trade I had this morning using NOMO's method. I am hesitant to post since there are so many people on this thread with much more expierence than me, but wanted to encourage people to post, this is a great method. It's only on a mini lot, $1.00 per pip, but it counts.

Jim

--- 帖子 #1088 ---
Hey Jim,

In turn, please let me encourage you to continue to post here. My results since this thread has opened have been very positive (meaning I've made more money than I have lost  LOL).  I believe the more we exchange ideas and nuances trading this strategy will help us all grow better as traders and more prosperous.

Keep it up!

Hi Jim,

Thanks for your post. I've started to trade Nomo's method on my live account. Took USDCHF, EURUSD, GBPUSD trades during NY session. All winners.

Do you go for 20 pip? How do u manage ur exits ?

--- 帖子 #1090 ---
remember its not about the pips, its about what % of your account did you make on those trades.

one's 20 pips may be equal to your 200 pips.

--- 帖子 #1091 ---
That's true...but mo' pips = mo' fun!  LOL

--- 帖子 #1092 ---
Nice trade.

Thanks RR:

Appreciate that, surprise, surprise, had another one this morning for a quick 20 pips. I am still struggling with T/P levels, your suggestions are very helpful. I'll keep posting, I'm a newb, but hopefully this will give hope to others to use this simple, but effective, at least in the short run technique. My exit is where I put the check mark.

"This is better that Nomo's system. The DOW correlation comes and goes. For three months it was very profitable, but the correlation ended last week. It will come back and when it does I will let everyone know." "Nomo's system doesn't work, well at least this one works better(Funny, a system will either work for period of time or don't), the dow correlation went belly up, for now."

The above was posted on the TKPOWER8 thread. How many people are using Nomos system and making good money with it? Not too many have posted in quite some time.

--- 帖子 #1095 ---
This trading method works very well and is profitable. It requires discipline to stick to the rules and patience to wait for the right trades. Merry Christmas to all and a prosperous and successful 2009. Blessings.

Hi everyone:

Happy New Year everyone and let's make 2009 the year of our financial freedom!!. Just wanted to enclose a chart from a profitable trade this morning, I got out with 20 pips using a trailing stop. Hope everyone has a great holiday.

Hi again folks:

Wanted to show you a potential winner this morning, unfortunately my boss was hovering over my desk and I couldn't trade. This system has been consistent in the short term, in my uneducated opinion.  My greatest challenge is taking small losses and not hoping they come back and watching it go against me a ton.  Any thoughts or insight would be appreciated. Happy New Year.

Hey,

I've been using this method also since the thread started, but only on 2 pairs.  How do you determine your stops ?

Do you use the original 20 pip stop ?

I do't think that would work in this volatile market at least not on the pairs I trade.  I put mine 5 pips above the pull back and set my TP at least 2x my stop

Last year I started using a stop of 25 pips.  This year I'm using 20 pips, but looking to reduce it a little further.  I'm trying to focus mainly on the really solid trades and my data is telling me that once you pass 17 your chances for success, based on my risk level are, low.

I either use 2x my stop or, I add a trailing stop with no tp.  The second method tends to capture more of the move for me.  There have been many times where the trade has got to 48 when the tp was 50 and then turned around.

Hi there,

First of all I want to thank Nomo, RRothschild, cheelu and all contributors for sharing this strat. I`m a noob tryng to make it on the forex.

From today i will start live tests wit nomo`s system and hopfuly in 2 weeks from now i will start trading it live.

My first question for you is if i got the box timed in. So... can you check the chart below (compare it with your own charts) and see if the begining and end of the box for London and NY session are right?

Thanx.

hi necre,

if i'm readin your charts correctly, they are off based on the times that i use.

i use:

- 1:00 - 3:00 EST (6:00 - 9:00 GMT) for London

- 7:00 - 9:00 EST (12:00 - 14:00 GMT) for New York

Hope this helps

RR -

--- 帖子 #1110 ---
Hi RR,

Trying to understand the reason why you choose 1-3 EST for London. I thought we are supposed to pick 1 hr before and 1 hr after the session open as the box timings.

For New york, your timings 7-9 EST go well with the above theory.

--- 帖子 #1111 ---
Yes cheelu, I was about to ask the same question... Why 3 hours box for london?

Another thing... how do i interpret you log?

For example, I took this short trade this morning...

EURUSD London 1/8/2009 Sell 13536.1 13561.1 13508.1 13486.1 13556.1 (20.00)... but i can`t understand all the athores levels... one sl and more tp levels or what???

Best of pips

My London box (1:00 - 3:00) is 2 hours not 3 not sure where you're getting 3 from.

if it's from the typo on the GMT then the times are (6:00 - 8:00 GMT).

Hi Folks:

Quick question. Say you get a long signal at for example. 1.5000. Would you place the trade when the ask hit 1.5000, or in the example of a 3 pip spread wait until the bid hit 1.5000 and the ask was at 1.5003. Just curious as to what people do.  If anyone remembers what NOMO said that would also be great. Happy, profitable New Year everyone.

Hi Folks:

Wanted to post a losing trade from this morning.  Thought that it was important to show both winners and losers on the forum.  It's a holiday today in U.S. plus the inaguration, so I'll pass on further trading until London session early tomorrow morning.

Jim

--- 帖子 #1117 ---
Hey guys,

I only trade a select few pairs with this system, including the EU. It used to be my most consistent pair before the new year. Now it doesn't seem to break the box with much strength or consistency anymore...at least in the NY session. It seems to make a stronger run earlier around the open of NY that maxes out the range, and never breaks out again.

Have you EU traders noticed this change? Does this typically happen each January time frame, or is it because of the election/innauguration, or just a change in market dynamics, or ?? Obviously, there is also a lot going on with economy as well.

Any thoughts on what might have caused the change, and whether it (hopefully) is just a cycle that might come back to compliment the system?

Fortunately, USDCAD is performing like EU used to...very well with this setup.

--- 帖子 #1118 ---
Hi everyone:

Just wanted to post a small winning trade this morning, I was up approx. 20 pips, but it retraced and I got out at the check mark with 10. Keep posting people, this seems to give pretty consistent pips if you aren't too greedy, and as always, limit your losses.

Jim

--- 帖子 #1119 ---
Havent posted in awhile but here goes.

gbpusd +40

gbpjpy +15

eurjpy + 10

eurgbp + 10

Breakouts are a major part of my trading, I find them consistantly making me pips along with S/R. Im up about 500 pips since yesterday, its great.

--- 帖子 #1120 ---
no one likes bragging about their losses.

ppl only post winning trades here on FF, even though FF people lose trades 70% of the time

--- 帖子 #1121 ---
Just because people only post winning trades doesn't mean the system is fault-less or just blind luck. But 70%?

Pull that stat right from your behind?

--- 帖子 #1122 ---
Have been using this system for a while now , still working Great on the GBP/JPY  pair from 12:00 midnight to 2:00 am . EST. for box high and low .... Getting excelent results..... buffalopip......

--- 帖子 #1123 ---
Cheelu,

Thanks. I was facing same problem as I was using your old indicator. New one is very good. And in the process of finding update of your indicator I have found new system too.

Your new indicator every thing is clear. Except Breakout end time.

Input of BOx Begin and Box end is clear to me. But I don't know what to put in for Breakout End time: Is it same for all three sessions : Asian, European and US : Should it be 23: 00 GMT for all the three sessions?

I hope all the times accepted by your indicator are in GMT.

What are considered the breakout times (in GMT) for Asia , Europe, and USA . Is it the first 4 hours of each session? first 2 or first 3? Please guide me.

Thanks again for your developing such a good yet simple indicator.

--- 帖子 #1124 ---
GBP/JPY breakout (hi/lo established in Asian session) working very well.

--- 帖子 #1125 ---
Yes I am also following the same pair and during the same time.

--- 帖子 #1126 ---
Is anyone trading this strategy. I got a question here if someone can answer? From the attached picture if one has to take a trade that will be at 1.3512 right?

The bar poking out will not be considered a breakout right?

--- 帖子 #1127 ---
This system continues to produce consistent profits. are there any other FF members who are still using this system?

--- 帖子 #1128 ---
I guess no one uses this system any more. It continues to work well, especially if trades are only taken in the direction of 4 hour market flow. It would be great to get some feedback from anyone who still uses this system. It consistently produces +20 pips on GBPUSD and EURUSD trades.

--- 帖子 #1129 ---
Has anyone traded this method long enough to have a sense of trade frequency, ie. monthly number of trades/pair, especially Gbp/Usd ? Most often when I employ this method I am met with success. I look back 2 hrs, 1 hr after London/NY open and trade levels as they appear in Cheelu's indicator, but use only 1 pip margin to enter, and SL/TP of 25/30. So far I have traded only Gbp/Usd with this method. In London session today I bought G/U at 1.6373 and closed at 1.6403. In NY session I just closed a sell at 1.6338 position at 1.6340, 15:01 GMT. Today's tally: +28. Any info about trade frequency will be greatly appreciated. Pippo

--- 帖子 #1130 ---
Hi FxPilot:

I have been demoing this system along with Phil Newton's system for a little while now, trying to find right pairs etc. Have you changed anything since your last post and are you still successful.  Thanks for sharing with everyone.

Jim

--- 帖子 #1131 ---
Hi Jim,

I have only tried this system with GBPUSD and EURUSD. It continues to average 20 pips per trade. However, the frequency of trades have decreased to an average of 3 good setups weekly. This is due to the fact that I only trade breakouts in the direction of the 4 hour trend (market flow).

--- 帖子 #1132 ---
I would like to say my IMHO here.

This system would work as long as there will be periods of consolidations (balanced market) and periods of moving market (unbalanced market) in the trading world.

You have to understand that even having your setup in hands, and seeing market goes out of balance, you can still loose this trade because of various things. Like too large pullback after trigging your trade, too weak follow-through etc. But as Nomo said - the trick is to keep the ball rolling.

This system is based on natural occurences of the markets.

Good luck!

--- 帖子 #1133 ---
Well said!

--- 帖子 #1134 ---
I have an idea to start trading this method from today with my little account. Will trade it really small lots for a period of time (may be about month or two) to get used with it, and if things will be Ok - then I would increase my lots.

Good luck to me!

P.S. - what I think about this method is - it really is based on just pure price action (box-indi is just for eyes, not for trading off it), and on... Supply and Demand! And as we know - Sup_and_Dem will never go out of style. Market are just based on them. Box shows us where and when the market is balance (range), and then some of these two forces goes in top of the other, then we wait for a pullback (to be sure there is intention to go more) and take our trade. The rest is a matter of we would have win or loss.  I like it.

--- 帖子 #1135 ---
Hi Dim,

Just wondering how you are doing with this.

I have been studying the system and so far I haven't seen a set up for the London open, but there have been some good break-outs later.

Not sure that this type of trading would be for me as I usually trade much higher time frames, but I will continue to monitor the system for a while.

--- 帖子 #1136 ---
What I have found is that if I apply the indicator on a 1 hour time frame and ignore the shaded time area, it does consistently highlight break out points.

I think that as long as a tight stop loss is employed, this indicator may produce some good results on the 1 hour chart.

I am going to start trading with it from tomorrow and I will  post the results.

--- 帖子 #1137 ---
Off to a good start  20 pips on Au/Us (see chart). There were other opportunities but I want to take it one trade at a time while I evaluate this.

--- 帖子 #1138 ---
Another good break out day on the 1 hour. This really does seem to work rather well, but since I appear to be the only one watching this thread I have not posted a chart today.

--- 帖子 #1139 ---
Hello!

Good observation!

I honestly have to say that because of some personal things I could not trade this technique in real time... but only during evenings and nigths I was seeing some good oportunities that was during last days...

But again - this method would work as long as there would be London's markets and N.Y.'s markets...  They would make those whole moves (waves) which would move the markets across the board.

Hi laharjaya,

The indicator is available on page 2 of this thread and was kindly posted by the originator of the thread......nomoretoxic.

I have only recently started using this indicator and so although early results look promising, I am not in a position to say whether it will be profitable long term.

If you do test it, posting your results would be very much appreciated.

--- 帖子 #1142 ---
Hello!

This is my long trade on EUR/JPY.

I trade this pair because of more volatility last time here than EUR/USD,

So - here is my trade long. Will see what would happen.

--- 帖子 #1143 ---
Its August 20 2023.

I Can't believe this thread is what? 14 years old? I came here and probably none of the participants are active - As for me, I began trading I guess around 2004 can't even remember - Now I am more invested into hard assets like office space buildings etc. All thanks to trading. But I still trade - it's fun .

I normally come to this site for the calendar and honestly I forgot completely about this thread. I decided to trade exclusively futures, including currency futures. Spot forex/market makers was not a place for me. Too many issues with data , requotes etc.

The idea of this system/strategy etc is to teach how to be disciplined and stick to your rules no matter what. No system is bullet proof and the main lesson you must learn is that, no matter what you use, losing is part of this business. I've been a succesful trader because i knew that from the start. This box/breakout strategy was made under the asumption that , once the market break the box either side, there's a high probablity that won't return to the other side of the box, hence giving the opportunity for profit on the side of your trade. This system has been a part of my trading toolbox, with some minor variations.

I was thinking about closing this thread I mean, it's 2023 time flies and probably people as moved on but, won't hurt to leave it as it is. After all , it's part of FF history rigth?

Thanks to all the people who flooded my inbox I am still reading the mesages LOL! Thank you very much from the bottom of my heart!!

I'll peak around from time to time.

Cheers.
