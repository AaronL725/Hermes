Dear all,

Here I present to you my new System, AshFX Daily. It's excellent for traders who work a full-time job, and/or can't/don't want to spend hours and hours staring at the screen.

I’ve been working on this system for quite a while; I wanted to make it accurate, yet simple at the same time.  I believe I have achieved that.  It is designed for the Daily Timeframe, and can be used on any currency pair.

The results that can be obtained from this system, is literally hundreds of pips a month. On average, the reward is greater than the risk.

These are the indicators that are required:

-   Parabolic Stop and Reverse (PSAR, 0.03, 0.2)

-   AC (Accelerator Oscillator)

-   AO (Awesome Oscillator)

-   Stochastics (5,3,3)

Take the attached template and apply it in Metatrader. Use it on the Daily Timeframe (D1), on any currency pair. By the way, these indicators can be found in any platform, so you are not limited to MT4.

See below for an example of what you should be seeing:

Two files attached - the actual AshFX System PDF manual, and the template for MT4 users. Please read carefully.

Look forward to questions/analysis/discussion/testing.

Regards,

Ash

Somehow this seems to work much better on M15 at least watching Cable.

On the daily I have not found a single profitable trade.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Do you enter only on closed bars?

Thanks

Hi Ash

I got your email about this system last week and Demo traded with it. I found 3 trades that matched your entry criteria. GBPCHF long, AUDCAD short both of which hit the first take profit and then closed at break even. the other trade CADJPY short is still running. It was in profit but now slightly in the red, however first impression look very good.

I have a couple of question which I will post soon but so far so good.

Thanks a lot

Ljr

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Check the EUR/USD daily. There are many profitable trades.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Your last trade wouldn't qualify because the AO is green correct?

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Regarding stop loss. Where would you put it for the attached trade? This indicates a long but the low of the trigger candle is at or near the entry point.

On Demo what i did was put a 100 pip Stop loss and this work out quite well.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
I'm sorry, but you are mistaken, the system produced over 400 pips on Cable over the past month. Please see screenshot. I haven't tried it on M15, nor was it designed for that timeframe. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Yes, I do.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
is the AO & AC have to be below or above the 0 line or U wory just un the coler

--- 帖子 #11 ---
You're welcome Ljr, appreciate the positive response.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Correct Billbss, but it's not only the Eur/Usd.  Like I said it works on any pair.  Obviously some pairs will fare better than others, but that's the nature of FX of course.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
is it posibel to post the signals to help the now traders

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Actually it would.  I've mentioned this in the PDF manual.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Actually, since I released this system last week (privately), a lot of people had asked me whether I could supply Daily signals when entry conditions have been met.  I'm thinking about it, but if I do it, I have to be consistent and persistent. (And no I'll never charge any money for the signals).

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Ash it seems that waiting for the close of the candle means often a large portion of the move is missed. Have you found this is best to be sure of the trend? Should one look at the next candle to decide if you should enter the trade or do you simply take the trade based on the closed candle.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
To be above or below 50, do both the stochastic %K and %D have to qualify, or either ?

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Doesn't matter if they're above or below, just focus on the colour.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
I have found that taking trades on the close of the candle is the best way forward, since:

a) It allows for manual backtesting.

b) It allows traders who have time constraints to use this system.

c) Most importantly, it is a profitable system.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Both have to qualify.  However, if either (or even both) have exceeded the 50 limit, then the system still accomodates for that occurrence as well.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
The system specifies that the signal you have taken there is actually invalid, because you were taking a long trade on a bearish candle.

However, interesting to note it still worked out for you...

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Thanks Ash for your system I have already been trading it,with good results!

I am only trading my demo for monday because of news doing usd/chf gbp/chf long

--- 帖子 #23 ---
I see you have changed you document slightly from the version I got last week and this didn't say anything about the type of candle. I think taking a long trade after a bullish candle and short trade after a bearish candle makes more sense so this is a good addition. As they say the trend is your friend.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Hi All

I don't currently see any trades based on this system for the pairs I usually watch but if anybody sees anything, it may be worth posting here so we can all benefit and ensure we are following the system correctly.

Ash if one misses the initial signal is there anyway to enter the trade later on or is it best to wait for a new signal?

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Looks like no trades tonight using IBFX.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Thanks Ah for your system! I did open good trades.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Hey Ash,  I think this will be good for a lot of Pips per month. Thanks for sharing.  Big E

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Nice system Ash.....I see there have been a few changes since the PDF you emailed out ealier....Thanks for the udate....I see good potential especially since I am not able to watch the charts all day....keep up the good work...

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Why is the posted pdf file prohibited from printing?

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Traded gpp/chf usd/chf both long  with the Ash system last night.

both doing very well at the moment!

--- 帖子 #31 ---
What time zone is your platform in? I don't have any signal on any of those pairs on mine (GMT+3).

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #32 ---
I prefer to use a broker with Sunday bar. I personally use FXDD Demo, and this is what I advise.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
It's best to wait for a new signal my friend.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
You're welcome mate.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Whoops sorry. Try again now, I hadn't changed the settings on my Adobe Professional.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Hello Ash,

thanks a lot for sharing this system! It's very kind of you that you share such a good system with us. I followed your other system PipNailer and now I'll do this with this one. Great system as usual from you - very simple and great! Great quality system!

Would this be a entry signal? I'm not sure because of the Stoch lines.

Thanks and keep going like this, we all like it!

Happy Trading,

Marcel

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Ash am I right in saying this?

For a sell the stochs need to be crossing above the 50 line IE as long as the red and blue line have crossed over each other above the 50 line and pointing down.

Is it the crossing of the stoch thats important, so cross above for short cross below and pointing up for long?

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Ok everyone, I coded two EAs for this system:

AskFX trades the complete AshFX system including the AO requirement and trade management

AskFx Entry Only  Only follows the entry for this system.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hi Ronald,

I'm well impressed how quick you came up with the EA! Thanks for the EA and hopefully we get the best out of it.

I tested it already and it seems that the EA does not take any trades. I used your first EA and run the test on EUR/USD for the last 12 months. Time Frame daily and I adjusted the magic number and lot size (set to 1.0) in your setting.

But no trades made and no error messages too. Anybody else tested the EA yet?

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Maybe I should clarify how I interpreted ForexMoment's PDF.

BUY:AC Green AO Green PSAR Below Price Candle Long Stoch Main less than 50 Stoch Signal less than 50 Stoch Main greater than Stoch Signal Stoch Main greater than previous Stoch Main Stoch Signal greater than previous Stoch Signal SELL:AC Red AO Red PSAR Below Price Candle Short Stoch Main greater than 50 Stoch Signal greater than 50 Stoch Main less than Stoch Signal Stoch Main less than previous Stoch Main Stoch Signal less than previous Stoch Signal

Did I miss something?

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Very interesting approach here,  gotta love the simplicity of it.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Hi man!

thx for the system.

looking at the 2 trades mentioned here with the pound it seems our stop should be caught before the trade goes out way.

you said the stop should be the High/ Low of the candle and in both cases we reached the stop.

anything im missing here?

--- 帖子 #43 ---
You should see the code for PipNailer =D

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I cast my vote in favor of receiving signals on this thread. Speaking for a lot of people, I think it'll primarily educational. Ultimately, most traders want to be self-sufficient.

In addition, I can't imagine that this would be all that difficult to code into an indicator. That will go a long way toward helping people to get up to speed in recognizing the signals so that they can focus on entry, trade management, and scaling out.

I know Mr. Raygun is creating an EA, but at the same time there are going to be a quite a few people that want to be more hands-on.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Thanks for the EA...

There are some, like me, that will probably turn off the "Trading" and use this as an indicator.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hi MajorB,

I applied the EA to my chart and would like to use it as an indicator.... I don't see and indication on the chart where it would indicate a trade, such as an arrow or such... I have allow trading turned off...I would like to use it as a manual indicator... Can you advise?  Ronald?

Thanks ASH for the simple clear system rules...

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Use it on a separate account, set signal mail to true.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Here is a sar with an alert.   you might need to adjust the parameters.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
RR, Is there anyway to get an arrow to appear on the chart... that would be a boon for back testing and chart screening...

--- 帖子 #50 ---
hi ash, i got your mail and i want to try you system, but i don't know how to set it on the platform that i you. can you pls show me how to set it.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Sorry, I don't know how to code indicators. What you can do is to run this EA on the strategy tester, and be sure to enable "visual mode"

--- 帖子 #52 ---
I like this system. I do not believe in stops how ever. I shoot for 20 pips each trade. There is a buy signal on the NZD/JPY if the signal holds current

--- 帖子 #53 ---
2 questions.

1. Do you use this system with another timeframe?

2. What time do you use for the daily bar? GMT or EST?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Thanks RR... I ran your EA in visual mode, Open bars (to speed things up) and  tested from 1/1/08 until today... but there were no trades or results reported....  Do I need to use every tick?  Can you point to a post with explicit instructions on setting up the strategy tester to run properly?  I did notice that there is a small x next to your EA instead of the smiley face... I sssume that's because I didn't click on "allow live trades..."

Thanks

--- 帖子 #55 ---
That may be the reason, but it shouldn't affect the backtest.

My suggestion for the backtest is to set to every tick and then set the date range to a known trade and see if the EA takes it.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi Marcel, thanks for the compliments. Concerning your question, yes it would, but I don't recommend using IBFX, since it has a Sunday bar.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Ronald you amaze me at your speed. Amazing.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Yep, you're totally correct mate.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
I used the four hour charts and this system last night to go long gbp/usd and eur/jpy.  Both winners with locked in profits.  Anyone else try the four hour?  Maybe someone can test Ronalds EA on a 4 hour.

Michael

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Ash is this a valid signal?

Only issue I see is the Stochs are above 50.

(Sorry subject should be NZDJPY, cant seem to edit it)

--- 帖子 #61 ---
I think this one may look a bit better?

--- 帖子 #62 ---
From what Ash has said your chart looks good for a long.

The stock.......... red and green line, crosses at the 20 mark forget the tail end of it, its the cross of the stock that counts.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
For the first 2 or 3 weeks, I think it would be helpful if you posted the trade opportunities you see each day in this thread. At least for a couple of  days each week. It would help the readers by allowing us to compare our setups with yours. You could avoid the  long term commitment of issuing a daily signal while still showing us what you see.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Hi, please place the TPL file into yout MT4\Templates folder.  Then restart your platform and apply the Template by right clicking on any chart. You''ll see a menu, and click on Template, then select AshFX_Daily.

Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
1. Nope.

2. EST.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
It is a valid signal, but you're using Northfinance.

FXDD Demo is what I use for my signals.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Hi 4 questions

1) what is the SL in the EA

2) can I use it in other time frames ?

3)by back tasting is the system counting the spread ?

4) can I set up the EA to avoid rool 4 in post #40 ?

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Which one?

Yes

Yes

Remove this part of the code every time you see it:

Inserted Code
&& Open[0] < Close[0]

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Yes you are missing something. The Cable was not stopped out, because remember - the SL is the low/high of the wick.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
I keep coming back but the first message I read is the first one one for forum and it is getting old.  How can I read the most recent message first?

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Ash do you think it matters which platform a person uses? I would imagine this system should work on any platform and any timezone, although I understand that would produce different entries and results but overall should still work.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
what is the question "Which one"

2 ) pleas explain which code to remove

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Not rocket science try upper right...click the highest number or last page

--- 帖子 #74 ---
in the original pdf is not writen abbout the candle what is the reason for the change did U made more back testing & U sow thet its bedder this way ?

--- 帖子 #75 ---
wow the same questions everytime u post a EA....RR u certainly must get tired of it. maybe some could take 5 minutes to understand basics of something they would use in trading...EA 101....much easier to be spoon fed like a baby instead of taking a micro second to use google I guess so we have to go through another 100 post to tell people what folder to put the EA in and what some of the variables mean.....

--- 帖子 #76 ---
There are two EAs that I coded for this system: Which one are you referring to?

Open up the EA of your choice in metaeditor. Look for that specific part of code. Delete that part of code every time you see it.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Ash -

I already have an acct with IBFX which has a Sunday bar.  How do I handle that, just ignore it and use a Mon. bar if the indicators are looking good?  It's not really in the cards for me to switch right now. p

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hi Ash,

Thanks once again for another wonderful system. I will be trading it. Just to check with ya, have u been trading this system live n how long have u been trading it?

Thanks again for sharing and i will keep u posted on e live trade results.

Andrew.

Hi I dont know how to place a chart on the forum so this link should show you a picture of my gbp/chf trade that I set up on my live account last night, I got  stopped out at 117 pips

I Followed the rules

ac green

ao green

stock cross just above 20 and pointing up

yesterdays candle closed above daily pivot point,

So all looking good for a long

I know you can not have a pefect system an you have to expect loses but is there anything else I could look out for, to try and reduce my loses

Thanks

--- 帖子 #80 ---
any result ??

--- 帖子 #81 ---
I really can't say.  All I know is I've tested it extensively on FXDD Demo, which is why I propose that.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Hi mate,

Been trading it live for around 1 month now.  I had demoed it for many weeks before that, and the system development started actually around the same time as Pip Nailer.  I kept on tweaking until this is my final result.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
I checked this trade and you are mistaken, it's not closed out for a loss.

Remember, you're supposed to enter as soon as all conditions are met. Look at my picture. That is where all conditions were met. So you would have entered at market opening, which was 2.0372, and placed your SL at the swing low (which is 2.0224). This trade is not over yet.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Thanks Ash!

I now understand

--- 帖子 #85 ---
No probs dude.  I am editing the PDF manual to make the rules clearer!

If anyone is unsure, just ask.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Updated PDF now uploaded on to 1st post.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Thanks so much, Ash!

I just downloaded FXDD demo and indeed the difference in setups is really huge... for example on that GBPCHF trade, on North Finance (GMT+3) the chart presented all the characteristics on June 12 for an open of 2.0251... and AC stopped meeting the "green" standard on yesterday's daily candle...

Did you made a comparison about which time zone was giving better setups? that would be interesting to watch. The thing is that at least 100 days would be needed to have a balanced overview... Maybe I'll start doing it, I guess that in the end it should be averaging more or less the same...

--- 帖子 #88 ---
I'm wondering Ash, how close is my EA?

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Hi Ron, are you sure this is correct? Your code:
PHP Code  double StochMain = iStochastic(NULL, 0, 5, 3, 3, MODE_SMA, 0, MODE_MAIN, 0);
double StochSignal = iStochastic(NULL, 0, 5, 3, 3, MODE_SMA, 0, MODE_SIGNAL, 0);
double StochMain1 = iStochastic(NULL, 0, 5, 3, 3, MODE_SMA, 0, MODE_MAIN, 0);
double StochSignal1 = iStochastic(NULL, 0, 5, 3, 3, MODE_SMA, 0, MODE_SIGNAL, 0);

It looks like these are assigned the same Stochastic outcomes.

Sorry to butt into the thread. I have always admired your coding style. It is very logical and well laid out.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Ron, I'm not a programmer so I can't really say.

Tell me which parts of the rules you don't understand.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
You know, I think you're right. The second set of Stochs should have a bar shfit of +1.

See attached. Thanks for pointing it out smjones.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
No way mate, you're not butting in at all. It's a pleasure to have an experienced Factory member like you to participating in one's thread.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
OH please, call me Scott. smjones is some old fart.

Forexmoments, thanks for your note. It is a interesting approach and I like the longer time frame and following the trend.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
This is how the EA was meant to perform.

BUY: AC Green AO Green PSAR Below Price Candle Long Stoch Main less than 50 Stoch Signal less than 50 Stoch Main greater than Stoch Signal Stoch Main greater than previous Stoch Main Stoch Signal greater than previous Stoch Signal SELL: AC Red AO Red PSAR Below Price Candle Short Stoch Main greater than 50 Stoch Signal greater than 50 Stoch Main less than Stoch Signal Stoch Main less than previous Stoch Main Stoch Signal less than previous Stoch Signal

Is that correct?

Clearly. It's a shame really that some people think forex is a get-rich-quick-every-day-scheme. They just don't seem to understand that the get-rich-quick part lasts 2 weeks about once a year. The most recent one I caught was From November 1 to November 20s. The same time another member on this forum turned 1k into 100k. I'm waiting for the next one to come around.

Occassionally there is someone who is genuinely interested and I take them under my wing provided that they spread the knowledge. And they've done a pretty good job of that for the most past.

EA 101 would be nice, there's a PDF by someone on google and I just direct people to that. I'd like Merlin to code some feature into the Forums to let us save autoresponses or macro-like responses for FAQs.

I would say maybe 20% of the Ozfx thread is full of those exact same questions lol.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
The first three conditions are correct of course, but I don't understand what you're trying to say with Stoch Main and Stoch Signal.  What does "main" and "signal" represent?

--- 帖子 #96 ---
He is referring to how it is addressed in MT4 See the screenshot below.

Edit: Although, I wonder how effective the Stochastic is. It looks like you are taking trades when there is a cross below 50 for buy and above 50 for sell and Ron's program requires both main and signal to be below 50 for a buy and above 50 for a sell. this is not how the chart you posted in your PDF looks. Take a look at the 05/12/2008 buy and see that actually, the main is above 50, but the cross is below 50.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Understood, thanks.

Yep, that is correct Ron (for the main signals).

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Right, but I have covered this in the PDF. Maybe I didn't explain it properly at first.  However, these are known "Secondary Trades", and are valid signals.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Oh please, call me Ash.  Forexmoments is so 80's...

--- 帖子 #100 ---
To Ronald:

I haven't read your code yet but am wondering this as I don't see it reflected in your features list:

About the SAR characteristics (for a "first strength" trade entry):

We're supposed to enter after the close of the first candle (= on the open of the second candle) on which the PSAR has changed places. That would mean the previous PSAR is on the same side, and the second previous is on the other side.

So the conditions on the list would be (let's say on Day1, Day2, Day3):

for LONG entries:

PSAR below price (Day 3) > PSAR previous candle (Day 2) < PSAR Day 1 (which would be above price).

for SHORT entries:

PSAR above price (Day 3) < PSAR previous candle (Day 2) > PSAR Day 1 (which would be below price).

If it's already taken account of, please disregard this message

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Hi Ash,

Was just checking out the system. Very ingenious!. and also very simplistic for  any noobs starting....I'm not a diehard longtime trader ( 1yr) but this sys def does show some merit!. I just took a nice little trade on nzd/usd as everything was set up on D1. will see what happens. Am just gonig for small pips at the mo, but if sys proves solid, will take more.

thanx for the sys

Doc

ps.. nicely explained in the PDF!

--- 帖子 #102 ---
It's there don't worry. It's through the EachTickMode feature.

If set to true, the EA will take a signal as soon as it sees one.

If set to false, the EA will take a signal at the end of the bar.

Some people think it's better to enter when you see the signal, and others think it's better to enter at the close of a bar.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Ok, thanks, I have read it now.

However I still don't see how do you reflect the fact that the signal has to be the FIRST PSAR dot above or below the "current" candle (be it "0" or "1") as the formula only specifies PSAR value should be higher or lower than the "Middle" variable but doesn't require previous candle (which would be "current +1") to be of inverse value.

Wouldn't it be taking trades on ANY subsequent candle that still meets the rest of the conditions even if it is not the FIRST one (if signal taken at once) or the SECOND one (if taken at the next candle open from the signal)?

Thanks for the patience

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Hi Ash,

Thanks again for your system, just to check with u on your data feed, is FXDD the same as InterbankFX, the same one u use for your pip nailer??

Sorree for th3e trouble, just checking

Andrew

--- 帖子 #105 ---
I read the first couple pages of this thread and will read the rest when I make a bathroom break.  It looks interesting.  So far I see USDCAD shaping up for a sell.  It looks to be close to a resistance point so a sell looks good.  I actually entered a sell a couple days ago in another system I'm demoing so this is even more confirmation.  I'll be demoing this system and providing input where appropriate.  Thanks Ash.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
For this system, use FXDD.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Guys, take a look at this long trade on the USD/CAD. If todays AO closes as red (once candle has closed), then we would have exited for around 1000 pips (yes ONE THOUSAND).  And our SL would have ONLY been around 100 pips.

These are the types of trades that make you an absolute killing, and these are the trades that this system was designed to catch, big time.

A thousand pips in two weeks, on one pair, with a relatively exceedingly low risk.  That's what I'm talking about!

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Ash,

Wouldn't that have been stopped out on 5/29?

And when the stoch crosses on 5/30, it's above the 50, so I wouldn't consider it a valid signal.

Am I misunderstanding something?

Thanks!!

-Dave

--- 帖子 #109 ---
NuclearSecret, it's all explained in the PDF my friend. (Hint: it's under the section entitled "Second Trades").

Read it again and if you still don't understand, let me know, happy to explain. Maybe I haven't explained it so well.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Ahhh... I was still reading the "original version."  I hadn't grabbed the update from this morning.

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Hi Ash,

I totally see the potential in this system!!! I just lost a profit because I misunderstood the trailing stop - but that's the human factor

I'm in the same pair for a short ride since yesterday. I saw the signal and entered - may I ask when you took the picture? Because I see the second red candle and you don't?! Maybe you took the picture yesterday but if not there is something strange / exiting in it. I'm using InterFX.

Do you guys think what I think? Maybe it's just a stupid thought of mine and the picture from ash is from yesterday or so ... I'm sure there is some logical explanation in it ...

--- 帖子 #112 ---
What do you consider the swing low .9818? If so does this mean the Second Strength Trades could have a SL larger than 100 Pips and/or larger than the other method of determining the SL?

When you calculate the SL move to BE using the info from the previous candle do you take the values from the candle that was previous to the entry candle or the candle that is prior to the day when the profits turn positive? On the USDCAD it was several days later.

Wouldn't it be about a 250 pip gain on the long USDCAD trade.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
is this a new vergin of the EA ?

--- 帖子 #114 ---
I think I actually see two trades here. the first one was stopped out. Then there was a new first psar dot below for the second trade. The second one looks like the one that ran the distance. I do not know what is meant by 1000 pips though.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Yes

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Hi Ron. I have changed the settings on the AshFXOriginal attachment to AshFXSet as you can see in the second attachment. No other settings have been changed. Do the amendments all look "correct" to you please? Or have I changed something which will mess it up?

--- 帖子 #117 ---
I have changed the magic numbers on each chart actually. Did I need to? It does look very pretty now it's all set up.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Looks like you're in the complete trading system. AshFX as opposed to AshFX Entry Only.

The code ifgnores Takeprofit and Stoploss, and replaces those with the high/low where appropriate.

The trailing stop function will override the existing SL. If the SL due to trailing stop is tighter than the current SL, the SL will be changed. Otherwise, those settings look good.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
You're correct, AskFX, and thanks for your quick reply. For anyone that's interested, from the time of this post, all AshFX trades made will be updated and published on auto every 5 minutes in my signature below. The previous EA was an unmitigated disaster as you can see. I'm looking forward to a satisfactory performance here and thanks again to you Ron and, of course, Scott and Ash.

Nvwine - correct, the swing low is exactly that, 0.9818. So yep, if you look at the trade, it was a "Second Strength Trade", because the Stochs has crossed the 50 line, which is why the initial SL would be placed at 0.9818, making the SL = 119 pips to be precise.

So, like I mentioned in the PDF, we always enter two positions of equal size lots. We enter at the start of the next day at 0.9936. The first TP would be equal to the previous candle's close minus it's low, which is 0.9937 - 0.9867 = 70.  I.e. our first TP on our first position would be 70 pips. As soon as this is hit, we move our SL on our second position to break even, i.e. new SL is @ 0.9936.

We let the remaning second position ride until the AO closes as a red colour, which happened tonight, thus price closing @ 1.0184. Which meant our second position made us 248 pips.

So in total, for that USD/CAD trade you're looking at 248 + 70 = 318 pips.  Hope this makes sense.

(Apologies for my 1000 pip outburst, I had entered multiple positions and got excited, ahem. Been working on different MM strategies for this system but haven't mentioned that as of yet.)

--- 帖子 #121 ---
No, there is only one trade, because:

a) The SL wasn't hit.

b) The second "trade" you talk about couldn't occur since the Stochs weren't crossing up.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Did you get in and out on all the high's and lows?

I do not see how you got 1000 pips in 2 weeks from the chart.

What am I missing?

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Lol, you're missing nothing, it was my personal trade where I had entered multiple positions on USD/CAD!!

Apologies for the confusion.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Hi everyone, just gone thru the thread and I like the system, somewhat similar to ozfx, however based on the system can somebody tell me if USD/CAD is a sell right now on the dailies AC& AO are all red PSaR is in sell position and stoch is pointing downwards.

THE EMPEROR

--- 帖子 #125 ---
LOL, thanks for the clarification.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Ash,

First, thanks for posting your system and answering all our questions about it. I appreciate your effort. Thanks for your answer about the swing low and the way to figure BE. Based on the TP calculation the  SL might be viewed as 238 pips on the trade. If both orders were stopped out.

Is there a Second Strength Trade on USDCAD today on FXDD? If so, for your tests would you consider the swing high at 1.0321 or 1.0296?

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Not a problem.

True actually; I should have counted the real stop as 238 pips (especially since I'm counting the multiple profitable pips as well).

Yes, there is a short on the USD/CAD today. But it's a regular trade, not a SS trade. The stochs did not trespass into the 0-50 zone.

Hence SL would be @ 1.0246.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
It would be GREAT if someone could a signal notification to the program.  maybe a beeping noise or a email when the signal triggers.  Can someone do this?

I do not know anything about programing the signals.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
- Parabolic Stop and Reverse (PSAR, 0.03, 0.2)

how do I program that setting. My Parabolic has 3 settings.

Default .02

Min Bounds .0010

Max Bounds .1000

Do I change default to .03 and max to .3

Use the template I've provided if you're with MT4.

Otherwise it's:

Eur/Jpy currently up over 400 pips.  Let's see where this one takes us.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Take any of my EAs and set SignalMail to "True"

--- 帖子 #134 ---
No EA trades for anyone in the last 16 hours then?

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Yesterday I eye spotted (not using EA) a sell of USDCAD.  I posted it a few posts back and Ash later confirmed it to be a valid signal.  It's negative 13 pips as I type but I expect it to move towards my target since there is strong resistance above its current position.  My daily chart shows USDCAD ranging from a low of 0.9710 to a high of 1.0377 since early December of last year.  It would make sense that USDCAD will continue its pattern and head south from its current position of 1.0197.  Everything seems to line up perfectly with this trade.  These are just my personal thoughts so take them with a grain of salt.  We'll see if I'm right or wrong.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
By the way guys, last night I closed my NZD/USD short, because the AO closed as green.

The system made 371 pips.

Check it out:

--- 帖子 #137 ---
hello AshFx! just found your system, today- looks pretty good, i have to admit. i am not really familiar with PSAR though. isnt it repainting by any chance?

tonny

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Thanks Tonny.

PSAR does not repaint. Obviously the signal will adjust DURING candle formation, but once the candle has closed, it stays put.

And since we only enter on the close of a candle (i.e. start of a new candle), then for our purposes it's perfect.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
thanx for ur quick reply, will definetely keep an eye on this thread

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Thanks Ricky - any EA trades today please anyone?

--- 帖子 #141 ---
P.S. If you had taken the previous trade on NZD/USD, you would have also made another killing.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Ash could you have not got back in on that trade nzd/usd  going Long?

AO ok

AC ok

Stoch ok

Do we have to stick to what the  SAR says?

--- 帖子 #143 ---
It's in the "final points" of the method:

"Please bear in mind that when entering a trade, it doesn't matter in which order the indicators may line up, e.g. the AO and AC don't have to change colour at the same candle as the first PSAR dot appearing. Or perhaps the AO / AC / Stochs might be compliant before the first PSAR dot appears, or vice versa, and this is fine."

--- 帖子 #144 ---
I had another question about this as well.  In the Entry Rules of the "revised" PDF, you note that the candle must agree with the rest of the signals.

In the Final Points section (quoted above) you say that order of the indicators doesn't matter, but there is no explicit mention of the candle.

Does the candle direction always have to agree with the trade direction when the trade is taken, or can we take the wait-and-see attitude as we do with the indicators?

Thanks!

-Dave

--- 帖子 #145 ---
I find it odd that the AskFX EA has 62 downloads on the previous page at the time of writing but no one appears to be using it. At least no one who's visited here today. Any ideas anyone?

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Entry is only made on the appearance of the PSAR.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
What this means is, it doesn't matter which order the AO or AC or Stochs line up...  So either AO can come before AC, or vice versa, or AC can come before Stochs or vice versa, or AO can come before Stochs or vice versa.  It doesn't matter. But as long as they all line up when the PSAR appears it's cool. I.e. they don't all have to change on the same candle.

What DOES matter is that we only take trades upon the close of the first PSAR dot.

Hope this clarifies things, and apologies for the ambuigity.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Hi, the candle HAS to be compliant when the first PSAR dot appears.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Is it a good signal for long on NDZUSD?

http://images31.fotosik.pl/290/fa195806c8a74ab7.gif

--- 帖子 #150 ---
I don't see that on my FXDD platform, but for all intents and purposes, yes, that is a long. Wait till candle closes.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Hi Ash,

Do you long signal on EUR/USD ? I think about indicator turned green and I was tempted for long trade

--- 帖子 #152 ---
hello there, i am looking at the charts. AshFx, you posted the pdf document (the first post). i dont understand why you didnt enter long eur/usd on 9th of june. wasnt that a valid entry ?

tonny

--- 帖子 #153 ---
I also use FXDD, and it's on my list... odd.

At any rate, my PSAR dot hasn't dropped yet, but everything else looks good.

Thanks for the heads-up, kobra11! I wasn't even watching that pair.

-Dave

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Ash, thanks for sharing another one of your findings.

Ron, Thanks for taking on your time for coding all these EA i see around the threads at FF.

I was wondering if, for "AshFx Daily" It would be possible for you to code a dashbord similar to the one swingman made for the pipnailer ?

Something that in one chart shows you all the possible entry for all pairs.

I have any clue about programming, so off course i mean if it s not to complicate and if it doesn't take too much of your time...

Btw thanks again to both of you guys for always being kind, patient and helpful

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Hi,

I went long on this today and allready in profit of £37 on ODL

paul

--- 帖子 #156 ---
I think a number of us are trying the EAs. I'm not sure what you find odd.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
This one got stopped out ( Demo trade )

In hindsight there was a descending trendline so should not have taken a long here.

Ash I know this is not on FXDD but would you have taken this trade?

--- 帖子 #158 ---
I don't see a long on Eur/Usd at this moment.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Yes, you're right, that was a valid long produced by the system, but I personally didn't take it.

Reason?  Look at the pic below.  There was a relatively strong resistance at that point.  Taking that trade in my opinion would be folly.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Nice one mate.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
I took that trade as well for a loss (small, thankfully), but on FXDD the trigger candle on 6/17 was red. Really seems to make a difference which broker you're using for signals!

-Dave

--- 帖子 #162 ---
I wasn't focussing on this pair, but yes, it would have been a valid setup if it was on FXDD.

However, the trade isn't over yet, because the SL should be at the swing low, since it was a SS Trade.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Ash, which broker do you use ?/

--- 帖子 #164 ---
For my signals I use FXDD.  For my trading I have different accounts at different brokers.  I mainly use IBFX and MBTrading.

My advice to you is never place all your eggs in one basket. (That also includes trading systems!).

--- 帖子 #165 ---
I guess you haven't seen my post 4 after yours from yesterday. FYI it's the second one below sir. Anyway, to clarify, your reply above quoting my question here...
...was made because no one has confirmed a single EA trade today but there have now been manual entries.
I have asked on 3 separate occasions over the last 10 hours. So, let's make it a fourth. Anyone had an EA trade today please? Really, I just want to compare notes with another EA user for Ash's system. Are you using the EA nvwine and, if so, would you be so kind as to tell me has it made any trades for you today please?

--- 帖子 #166 ---
hi,

I have just downloaded the EA, and put it on 9 pairs, will post any trades that happen.

but reading the thread carefully I think the trades will be few and far between as the way it works is to the original outline ie, the stochs must not have crossed the 50 line, this is fairly rare

Steve.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
No the EAs I'm using did not see any valid signals 23 hours ago. The USDCAD was a valid trade as confirmed by Ash if you took it visually. Using the EA the stoch was  below 50% at the start of the new bar from an automated point of view. Just my opinion.

We only have trade oportunities once every 24 hours so watch your charts in 30 minutes. If you have your Data Window open on any charts where the first PSAR dot may close in the opposite direction you can see what data the EA is looking at. That way you can tell if the EAs should have opened a normal AshFX Daily trade. I don't think the EAs will enter a Second Strength Trade.

Edit: After looking at the charts just now I don't see any possible automated trade entries in 15 minutes.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Well, I'm off to bed now so if you get a moment nvwine or anyone else to let met know if you're using the EA and it's made a trade 10 hours before or after the time of this post it would be greatly appreciated. For my part, when it springs in to life you'll be able to see immediately in my signature below. I look forward to your comments in my morning. And goodnight.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
It must have taken me 5 minutes to type the above. God, that's embarrassing. And thanks for your detailed response. I really am gone now.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Guys if you are entering long for example, does the signal candle have to be a long candle? and Vice versa, does this matter?

By the way Ash, thanks for the great system, This is how forex needs to be, simple, effective.

May i ask why 2-3 pages ago some of your charts you posted had a red bar for a long entry for example? Is this some kinda advanced entry?

Whats the best stoch settings that you've got good results with, 5,3,3 or 14,3,3?

Many thanks for your time and help buddy

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Hey dude, I've not really tested the EA. But personally, I prefer to enter manually.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Officially, yes it matters - the candle must be bullish if entering a long, and the candle must be bearish if entering a short. I continually endeavour to test this system with differing variations, and it's clear that there can be advantageous outcomes even if you took a long on a bearish candle for example, but I'm not in a position to claim whether that's generally profitable long term. I'll post my findings if I come up with anything conclusive.

Thanks mate.

Did I really?  Please remind me.

Haven't even tested 14,3,3.

Any time.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Thank you AshFX for your thread, i have been trading a similar system over past 2 months (demo only) and i have used your knowledge there to improve it. E.g. didnt use support and resistance before as i didnt realise how powerful they are... and your targets and SL make sense. i was using fixed sl and tp for all my trades, which was rather inflexible and i keep leaving many pips `on the table`. Once again, thanx

Will be soaking as much knowledge as i can (and my time allow).

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Thanks ash for your replies. Just about to go bed, i'll find the charts you posted tomorrow and tell you which ones i meant.

But any success with this on gbpjpy?

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Ash, what is the time zone shown on your FXDD demo MT4 platform? I thought it might be GMT or GMT+1 but am just checking and it shows the same time as my North Finance platform (GMT+3), the only difference is that it doesn't show a sunday candle.

I'm puzzled indeed, when I installed it I could have sworn it had a different time zone.

P.S. I just checked against your EURUSD chart and indeed it's GMT+3 as well. But the fact that it doesn't have a sunday candle makes a big change as to where PSAR dots appear. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #176 ---
hello Ash, sorry i'm not very well in english, what do you mean by the sentence that i quoted above?

and the other question is when we actually execute entry point?

as the attachment, we should always execute entry point after the requirement occur right?

and last, when we know the S/R level?

--- 帖子 #177 ---
I believe the "A" point is the signal (all indicators align w/bullish candle) and the open of "B" point is the entry.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Ash,

Thanks for the great system, I started using it yesterday and been in positive pips ever since. It doesn't get much easier than this.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Hi Ash.

Downloaded everything and installed on a clean new demo with FXDD. Also activated the Ronald EA, thus looking forward to an interesting action here. If it delivers as expected, I will give it a BIG push to teach my Dutch speaking buddies on the other side of the world.

Thanks so far for all your input and keep up the good work....and a BIG thanks to Ronald.

I will post any trade signals I get with this system As for a very long time i've been looking to do some serious daily trading, because this is where the money and pips are guys.

Btw im from the UK, perfect time to trade this i guess. Please guys try and share any signals you get even just for a while to help others and each other out so that we know we are on the right track.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
lets all post our thoughts and possible trade setups. Ive been looking for something like this because i work a fulltime day job and sitting in front of charts isnt really an option. thanks to all

--- 帖子 #189 ---
I wish we could find some one to code an indicator for this system.

When using multiple charts it would be much easier to spot a potential trade by looking at the indicator generating a signal and then checking the validity of the signal on the charts.

I know it is possible to use the EA for signals by disabling "live trading" but it is by no means a substitute for visual signals on the charts.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
It would help if we could alter the EA to take trades where the stoch was over the 50 line but under the 80/20 lines, I will have a go at it tonight but I don't have much experience with MQL4, so no promises.

I am also in the UK & in full time employment so this would be perfect, if we can get consistant results.

Steve.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Based on my tests I think the EAs may need some modifications before they enter trades in the closed candle mode. I'm using the visual method until I understand the system.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
I did actually ask Ronald Raygun a couple of days ago if everything looked fine and his response is below.
Are you saying that, in your opinion, nvwine, I am waiting in vain? I'd value your opinion even if you're not a 100 % certain.

My settings are below.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
This looks like it could be a good setup.. I just opened this one a few mins ago. the sar is above, both AO/AC are red/short and the stoch is just crossing... however the candle has yet to turn, but the odds are good that it will shortly. How about this one Ash.. did I jump the gun?

Doc

--- 帖子 #194 ---
What pair did you enter?

--- 帖子 #195 ---
He posted it in the subject, Usd/Jpy

You have to wait until the candle closes. In addition, it needs to be a bear candle.

Pete

--- 帖子 #197 ---
I’m typing this at around 9am EST.  The first lot on my USDCAD sell trade from a couple days ago has hit take profit for 41 pips.  The second lot is still running in the right direction and has already garnered 53 pips at the 1.0128 level.  I expect this lot to run for at least another 143 pips to the 0.9985 level.  We’ll need to monitor it closely once it approaches the 1.0000 level.

As for today’s possible setup, a new PSAR has been spotted under today’s GBPUSD bullish bar.  See the attached image. I don’t, however, have much confidence in this trade because of a couple reasons:  1) today’s bullish bar is pushing the upper trendline of a descending triangle.  Combine this with my observation that the pair has been trending down in the last 8 months and this leaves me with little confidence this pair will be bullish for long.  2) The stochs at the moment look to be approaching the 80 level, which if today’s bar continues at its current pace may put the stochs well into the 80 level.  This again would signal to me that the pair might not have significant enough upwards movement to warrant a trade.  If the bar closes above the upper trendline at 5pm EST, I might consider this trade depending on where the stochs are at the time.  But for now I’m playing it safe.

These are my very subjective thoughts.  I’m just putting them up here to see what others think and so that I can document my thoughts.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
hi forexmoments, i love your system, because i don't have to be in front of my monitor all day.  btw, i want to ask, please see these charts below, are they valid entries according to your system's rule?

thank you

I've spotted 3 setups that seem promising. They are AUDUSD (long), NZDUSD (long) and CHFJPY (short). Once again you have to wait until close of candle for confirmation. Also keep in mind that AUD and NZD are highly correlated pairs so taking both may be equavalent to being in the same trade with two different currencies, thereby increasing your risk exposure. I've attached the charts.

EDIT:  The AUDUSD and NZDUSD stochs may not be ideal, so I don't know whether Ash would consider them to be valid Second Strength trades.  Ash could you comment on this as we get closer to 5pm EST?

--- 帖子 #200 ---
the way i understand the system the usd/cad should have been entered on the close of mondays candle to maximize potential.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
chf/jpy looks to be the best of the three to me imho. with stochs where they are, have to see how it ends.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Thanx for the reply Pete. Yes I figured I jumped the gun a little, hoping that the candle would turn, or run short. will just have to wait it out now and see what happens. Everything else looked good...  however.... patience is needed

doc

--- 帖子 #203 ---
I concur, CHFJPY is looking like the best candidate.  The stochs line up and it's also at what seems to be a strong forming resistance point.  I expect to jump on this one later.  The other two I'm not so sure about.

BTW, my USDCAD trade is still looking good.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
ya i demoed that yesterday. looking good

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Ron,

Thanks for your work on the EA.

It always takes a while to get the bugs out of any EA. I think there are a couple of modifications that can be looked at. There is not an allowance for Second Strength Trades. The Stoch settings may need to be relaxed a little.

More important, from my tests I think that when Each Tick Mode is set to False the following line of code prohibits any trade entries.

((EachTickMode && !TickCheck) || (!EachTickMode && (Bars != BarCount)))

Neither side of the Or operator is ever equal.I may be wrong. I'm not a programmer. The tester program does not always reflect forward trading.

Edit: I read Ron's response. I must be in error.  Ignore this post.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Even if you're wrong thanks for taking such a close look at this. I have each Tick Mode set to False on 12 pairs which may explain why I've had no trades. I look forward to the reply from Ron.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
I assure you that EachTickMode works properly. Allow me to explain those bits of code:

Inserted Code ((EachTickMode && !TickCheck) || (!EachTickMode && (Bars != BarCount)))

If EachTickMode is true and there is a new tick, OR EachTickMode is false, and there is a new bar....[do what's next]

--- 帖子 #208 ---
And thanks for your quick reply Ron. I'll just leave well alone then.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Hee guys.

First order was placed.

When I added the CHFJPY pair just now, the platfrom took 2x the position SHORT@103.15

Freddy

--- 帖子 #210 ---
I guess this was on the AshFX EA? and not the Entry-Only EA?

It's supposed to open two orders.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Unfortunately, I'm not on that pair so still waiting.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
EXACTLY

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Exactly dude.  I prefer price action to determine my SL and TP. Using fixed stops and tp's are way too rigid. Not saying they don't work, but price action rules. Maybe some systems suit fixed SL/TP, (e.g. scalping systems), but mine definitely doesn't.

On that note of price action, this is why I really insist on budding traders (like myself), to get to grips with Support and Resistance. I'm glad you have taken my advice on board.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
It means that if the PSAR is below the candle, then the candle must be green. If the PSAR is above the candle, then the candle needs to be red.

You only enter when you see the first PSAR dot. You can't enter after 3/4 dots have appeared.

S/R levels are something that can't be explained in 1 post. You need to practice, and train your eye. There are many threads on Forexfactory dedicated to Support and Resistance.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Wowser, talk about 0 to 60...

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Looks like it mate. Remember - candle needs to close before making a decision.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Hi Ron,

I've been testing the EA on strategy tester in visual mode, for a perfect entry day (GBP/USD, 17/4/08) and it didn't take the trade,

so then I used it from jan 07 to today in normal mode, got 90% modelling quality but no trades,

journal is ok, also I downloaded the history file

I'm not keen on using the strategy tester but I just want to be sure the EA will take trades,

please could you check it ? cause I may be doing something wrong.

thanks,

Steve.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Excellent analysis Rick. Yes, you are correct, I would consider the AUD/USD and NZD/USD trades to be invalid, since the Stochs have crossed the 80 line. Obviously the candles haven't closed yet, so can't say for certain, although it seems that way.

As for the CHF/JPY, it's looking like an excellent potential setup.

Lets just wait for the candle close.  Will update in an hour (i.e. at start of new FXDD day).

Ash

--- 帖子 #219 ---
I've spotted 3 setups that seem promising. They are AUDUSD (long), NZDUSD (long) and CHFJPY (short).

Ricky, I took the AUDUSD and NZDUUD  trades the other day, I'm nowp 170 pips total  - love this system!

Mitch

--- 帖子 #220 ---
got it working now by switching to every tick mode, but still not working in close bar mode, so there definitley seems to be something wrong?

Steve

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Good job on the 170+ pips.  My apprehension about the AUDUSD and NZDUSD is that I'm not sure if they've already exhausted their bullish move.  As Ash wrote a couple posts above, his system considers them invalid.  If you're already in those trade then they should work out for you depending on when you got in.  However, taking them now, according to the system rules, would be risky.  The CHFJPY seems to be the most promising.  I'm planning on taking that one.  It is consistant with Ash's system as well as my other analysis.

Looking into the future I think we should keep an eye out for AUDCAD for a long in a couple days.  I'm not saying there is a setup there but my analysis says we could see one in a couple days.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Candle for the daily on fxdd closing in 20minutes roughly is that right?

Any updates on GbpUsd? I read on a site its in a Downtrend for the moment?

Ash any thoughts at the moment on ChfJpy?

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Definitely, I'm looking into this. Out of curiosity, when is the EA taking the trades? Is there a pattern?

--- 帖子 #224 ---
USD/CAD hit our first TP today, made made 62 pips on that, so we'ved closed half our position, and moved SL to Break Even. The second half of USD/CAD we're still short on.  We will only close it once the AO closes as green.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Yes, FXDD closes at 5PM EST (2 minutes from now).

I'm staying away from GBPUSD.  What you read is what my earlier analysis indicated.  I wrote this in a post early this morning.  It is just too risky for my taste.

I'm definitely taking CHFJPY.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
A is NOT the signal becous the PS&R is above the candel

I've got a resistance level here for the ChfJpy at 102.69 that price could go down and touch....Any thoughts on wether to take the chfJpy then or not?

Thanks guys, and congrats ash on the usdcad, hope it makes some great pips for u and the other guys who might have taken that.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Right guys, I have taken a short on CHF/JPY according to my setup.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
I am also short chfjpy.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Ash,

Just wanted to say thanks for the system and the hard work /support.

I've noticed that if people are using different brokers other than the one you are using (FXDD) they will be seeing different setups. I have FXDD and ODL Securities. The USD/JPY has already flipped the PSAR on the ODL Securities feed but not on FXDD, the stochastics are also in a different position on GBP/USD on the ODL Securities feed. It is interesting how the same indicators do not act the same at different brokers and thus can different signals.

Ron,

It is taking trades only in every tick mode, as soon as everything lines up, as it should, but nothing in close bar mode

also I have noticed it opens two trades but usually treats them as one

Steve.

switched to manual trading and just gone long GBP/USD at 1.9725

This time on a forward test neither side of the OR statement from post #207 was true at the start of the new day on FXDD. Here is part of my experts log with the results of the print statements generated by my debug EA. My local time of 14:00 is the start of the new day for FXDD and is 21:00 GMT.

It still seems to me once 'Order = SIGNAL_BUY' or  'Order = SIGNAL_SELL' then you have to have the result from one side of the code from post #207 match in order to enter the buy or sell part of your code. This is with Every Tick Mode = False.

Another thing to look at:
Inserted Code [font=Arial Narrow]if(AC1 > AC2 && AO1 > AO2 && PSAR < Middle && Open[0] < Close[0] && StochMain < 80 && StochSignal < 65 && StochMain > StochMain1 && StochSignal > StochSignal1 && StochMain > StochSignal) Order = SIGNAL_BUY;
if(AC1 < AC2 && AO1 < AO2 && PSAR > Middle && Open[0] > Close[0] && StochMain > 20 && StochSignal > 35 && StochMain < StochMain1 && StochSignal < StochSignal1 && StochMain < StochSignal) Order = SIGNAL_SELL;[/font]
Open[0] < Close[0]

This is reading the current new bar not the closed bar. I think it should be Open[1] < Close[1]

One more:

Using AskFX.mq4

Long order are opened with the SL too tight.

Low[0] change to  Low[1]?

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Still waiting for the EA to spring in to life. Maybe next week?

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Why oh Why,

do you have it set to every tick mode?

if not, it won't trigger.

if you are in every tick mode, keep a close eye on the second trade & see what happens.

thanks,

Steve.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Here is my current trade, I wonder if I should take the short or wait for the AO confirmation

--- 帖子 #237 ---
you already have AO confirmation, but you need AC to get in the short, this doesn't seem to be a valid trade to me

Steve.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
I meant AC, it's just others have already been signaled. Just wondering if I should just the gun and get in a little early. The wise answer is probably just wait.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
At the end of the day you should do what you feel comfortable with. Just bear in mind though, my advice is to use FXDD Demo for signals, then you can enter on any broker you wish.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
I personally am not gonna take a long on Cable. Too much resistance too soon, thus offering a bad reward:risk ratio.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Ash,

What are your thoughts on the EURAUD today?

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Still in the CHFJPY since this morning, although one of the 2 opened positions have disappeared by itself  about 2 hrs ago.

Present DD 24 pips, nothing to worry about so far

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Thanks for that Steve. Nvwine agrees with you but Ron, the author, clearly stated earlier in this thread it will definitely work in both modes so I'm leaving it alone until he changes his opinion.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
My thoughts also, but then I noticed divergance between the price & the stoch so lets see what happens, it's only demo money anyway

Steve.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
I haven't taken it mate, but if you do, remember the SL is at the swing high @ 1.6527.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
what would ur stop loss be on the chf/jpy trade thanks

--- 帖子 #247 ---
I have got my stop at 10434 which is 1 pip above the High ( + spread ). This makes the risk 100 pips so first take profit of 100 pips is at 10234.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
yep thats just about where i have mine thanks

--- 帖子 #249 ---
The short on the chf/jpy not looking good at the moment.

it looks more like a strong long.

chf/jpy been ranging in this area for the last 10 days, also the stoch was weak pointing only slightly downwards to the 50 so maybe not such a good trade to take?

--- 帖子 #250 ---
I agree - especially on the back of good news for CHF!

Trino

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Have to see what happens either get stopped out or we wont.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Hi, am I the only one who didnt see the change of the parabolic?

--- 帖子 #253 ---
what broker are you using? looks like eveything is the same eccept the psar

--- 帖子 #254 ---
I don't think you are using a FXDD MT4 chart. The candles are not the same as the ones on my chart. Ash along with many if not most of the rest of us are using FXDD. FXDD has no Sunday bar and starts a new day at 21:00 GMT.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
its Varengold from Germany, I think it has to with the broker or maybe the setting of the parabolic, but they are from the template I didn't change nothing. hmmm strange

--- 帖子 #256 ---
How can I get those Charts? Can you post a link ?

--- 帖子 #257 ---
http://www.fxdd.com/index.html

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Thank you, now I have the exactly same view.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Your welcome.

Having the same charts as the system's author makes learning much easier.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Hi Ash and all others,

do you close all of your trades at the end of the week? Or do you just leave them run?

Thanks,

M.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
You know this is a good post! We have commited to the trade on the Daily timeframe, set our stop loss and now whatever happens happens. Some will win some will lose but we should not worry about what happens during the daily candle.

Sit back relax and check again tonight when the candle closes.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
My thoughts are letting it run until stopped out or take profits are hit

--- 帖子 #263 ---
I just noticed that the PSAR dot is coincidentally the same as my SL, so this question is kind of moot, BUT...  generally if the PSAR or AO changes against the trade before the SL is hit should we close all positions?

Thanks!

-Dave

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Ron, is it possible nvwine and Steve are correct? The EA has been standing by for four days with no trades. Tick mode is false. BTW, he's (the EA now has a sex!) monitoring 12 pairs.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
If stop loss or take profit hasn't been hit leave them open.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
The problem would be in the order criteria, not the EachTickMode function. I'm still going through the order entry. Something isn't matching up.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Thanks a lot mate.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
USDJPY seems to be the next potential Trade...

--- 帖子 #269 ---
I normally don’t like trading against the trend like we did with the chfjpy pair.  However, when I looked at the charts for this pair I saw that the last 2-3 times this pair reached its high or made a new high it headed South.  All the other indicators I check, including the ones for this system, pointed to it going South as well.  I must admit though, I don’t pay attention to news when I’m testing a system.  I still haven’t given up hope on this trade.

The second half of the my USDCAD trade has stopped out at breakeven.  The first half hit its profit target yesterday.  So far my record with this system is 1 win (or a half win since the second lot was a breakeven).

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Ash,

Regarding the USD/JPY , if all criteria is met at the end of the day, when is entry since this is a Friday.

Pilgrim

--- 帖子 #271 ---
i believe it would be the open of mondays candle

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Whatever happens on Sunday or Monday is not going to change the Friday candle in anyway.

The price could move for you or against you between Friday and Monday and will only affect your entry point but your stop would not change so I would be inclined to say place your order immediately after the Friday close.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
i think usually there is some retracement on the last candle and if going short on USDJPY the swap is actually against you. just some thoughts

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Guys you needn't worry about CHF/JPY.  This should hit our TP before our SL.  I am very confident about this trade, the resistance is too strong.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
just be aware, price action on the USD pairs could get choppy the beginning of the week as we have a FOMC statement on Wed afternoon (1:15 pm Eastern).

Pilgrim

--- 帖子 #276 ---
EDIT: This is personal preference, but I usually let them run.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
I personally let the market re-open and then make a decision.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Correct.

Because this is a Second Strength Trade, it means our stop would be placed at the swing high.  This is also a strong resistance point, as can be seen in the picture. Excellent setup.

You can either enter on Friday night or at market open. That's something which I haven't accounted for officially.

--- 帖子 #279 ---

Ash,

Did you take swing Low into account, which was three bars away from the entry for the first Long trade? if so, then yes, it did not hit the SL.

I am asking to be sure that SL was not the difference of Low and close of the previous bar to go long. Otherwise, SL would have been hit.

Thanks

akalra

Never mind Ash. I found answer to my own question as per post 120.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Ash,

The first solid week of trading in a long time - thanks Ash for a great system. I used it live exclusively this week starting Tuesday and closed everything out just before close. Did my best to follow your rules, but still made some stupid noobie moves. All in all 275 pips booked!!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Hi all,

As Ash said we dont have to risk more than 3% on a trade. What does it exactly mean? Imagine I opened an account with USD 500. Give me an example please!

--- 帖子 #282 ---
www.babypips.com will have ur answer!!

sonic

--- 帖子 #283 ---
3% of $500 is $15.

$15 is what you can risk = stop loss on that trade.

You will need a micro account (positions from 0,01 lots = 1 pip equals $0,10), as with a mini account you would only be able to place a 15 pips stop loss.

On a micro account: $15 on a 0,01 lot is 150 pips (150 x $0,10 = $15)

If you only need a 50 pips stop loss, you would be able to open a 0,03 lot position (50 x $0,30 = $15).

And so on.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Hi Guys,  With the broker Ash recommends for charts, what time does the daily chart update if you live in the Pacific Time Zone? Oregon, USA Thanks,  Big E

Guys just informing you that I'm still holding my long for Eur/Jpy from a few days ago.

Closed my first half of position for just under 300 pips, and letting the other half run till the AO closes red.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Thanks DOBLECE, I really apreciate your answer and your time.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Hi Ron, I know you've got a lot on but I was just wondering if you' had any joy sorting it out? Thanks for your continued support.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Well done man. That's what I LOVE to hear, people making real money on real accounts.

Let's hope for another productive week hey!

--- 帖子 #293 ---
No luck.

Try going through the code if you can. You may see something I've missed.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Oh well, I've now switched it to  EachTickMode = True based on previous suggestions. Thanks for your efforts.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Anybody else see this setup on USDCHF.

This would be a second strength setup and the stop will be about 180 pips!

--- 帖子 #296 ---
I don't see that signal on my FXDD platform, so I won't be taking it.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
PSAR is not compliant on my chart, what are your settings for psar, 0.03, 0.2?

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Yes the settings are correct (using Ash's template)

Must be just the different feeds. The PSAR on my USDJPY is also not the same as the chart that was posted earlier, although some of the other charts have been the same.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Ash I have set up a demo account on FXDD so I am now seeing what you are seeing.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Ok guys, I have just entered my short on USD/JPY.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Good stuff.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
This is what everyone should be seeing for USD/JPY:

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Ash, I see that also on my chart, but I am not going for it, as I don't feel good about that pair in comparison to the EUR/USD.

The rule is, when you don't feel right about it, then stay out of the trade, right?!

My CHFJPY is still open, want to see where that leads to.

PS: live with that one

--- 帖子 #304 ---
No trades at all on this system? Your web page that updates every 5 minutes hasn't a single trade listed. What currencies are you monitoring?

--- 帖子 #305 ---
I'm using IBFX demo account for signals for AshFX and it showed a short signal 3 days ago. Why are you guys only seeing it now. Any reason why FXDD charts show it differently? I'm fairly new to FX, and have been using OZFX system with great success, and now i'm using AshFX as well.

Why different signals from different banks? and who "should" i be using?

--- 帖子 #306 ---
hi forexmoments

i enter it live and this is the first day i see your thread , i like it . look so nice this system .

just please can you tell me what sl i should place , previous candle high - previous candle close ?

regards and thanks

imad

--- 帖子 #307 ---
You have a Sunday bar and FXDD does not. That means you have 6 days in your trading week. This changes the calculations of the indicators. Less important but worth noting, IBFX's new day starts 3 hours later.

If you want to learn this system right use FXDD. That is what Ash, the system's creator uses. You can always run both the FXDD and IBFX platforms. Another platform with some adjustments may work as well or better than FXDD. It is hard to tell at this point. But learn the system first then you can compare platforms and try to optimize the settings you use.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
There is a problem with the the EA. The settings have now been changed. 12 pairs monitored. I trust it'll spring in to life this week.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Does the AO indicator have a tendency to repaint?

Pete

--- 帖子 #310 ---
During the day it may change colour as the price fluctuates but once the bar is closed it stays the same.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Nope, not at all.  Colour remains the same after candle close.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
hello ash, do you have source for learning S/R? site and ebook?

--- 帖子 #313 ---
hi

are you stil in the trade uj ?

thanks

--- 帖子 #314 ---
just an idea for an early entry: timeframe 4H, system as is.

currently

eurusd: +46

usdchf+47

gbpusd:+53

audusd:+18

gbpjpy:-17

floating pips: 147

--- 帖子 #315 ---
I didn't take this one.  I'm a bit picky going against the trend. I didn't feel as good doing so with this one as I did chfjpy from the end of last week.

I also passed on last week's gbpusd long and glad I did.  Had I taken it today's action would've stopped me out.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
I am in the usd /jpy on my live account any one else take this trade?

what are your veiws on it?

The trade is going against us at the mo but its  just hit major resistance at 108.07

--- 帖子 #317 ---
yep im in it live. i see its up against resistance. I was thinking of adding another short to up my average.but waiting to see if this holds.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
I got stopped out on this one.  Friday candle high was 108.05, which is where I placed my SL.

SL got his about 30 minutes ago.

I'm on FXDD.  Some saw 108.07... was this on FXDD as well?

-Dave

--- 帖子 #319 ---
I am still short in the U/J trade. Anyonr else?

--- 帖子 #320 ---
i think the stop should have been the swing high? Im not sure. which would have been around 108.65 because it was a second strength trade. someone correct me if im wrong.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Good results so far - keep posting.

I don't usually approve of folks taking a method (daily) and immediately changing it (4hour) but on the other hand I'm uneasy with the huge SLs of 100 pips or more on the daily ...and also the dearth of opportunies.

I assume everything else is the same; FXDD, the basic rules, SLs, TPs??

R

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Was it?  I didn't think it was, but if you're correct then clearly there is something that I'm not understanding about the entry rules (simple as they are).

What did I miss?

-Dave

--- 帖子 #323 ---
I agree, the stop should have been the swing high at 108.57 (from my FXDD chart).

Dave - see Ash's system details ----"Second strenght trades".

freddi

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Ahh, Stoch below the 50.  I guess that was it.

So both stoch values must be above 50 (below for long) to make it a "primary" trade?

-Dave

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Absolutely.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Hi Ash,

Is this a 'second strength' setup?

thanks

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Any EA trades anyone today please? None posted by anyone today. I'm still zero trades.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
u/j I set my stoploss the same as what I saw on Ashes chart swing high 108.67

But I entered the trade sunday night late going short 108.67

--- 帖子 #329 ---
just broke the 103 support lets see if this holds. whats the next target?

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Ok, I'm absolutely stumped on this one, I need your help.

Here are the variables that the entry program is using.

Inserted Code
double PSAR = iSAR(NULL, 0, 0.03, 0.2, Current + 0);
double AC1 = iAC(NULL, 0, Current + 0);
double AC2 = iAC(NULL, 0, Current + 1);
double AO1 = iAO(NULL, 0, Current + 0);
double AO2 = iAO(NULL, 0, Current + 1);
double Middle = (Open[0] + Close[0])/2;
double StochMain = iStochastic(NULL, 0, 5, 3, 3, MODE_SMA, 0, MODE_MAIN, Current + 0);
double StochSignal = iStochastic(NULL, 0, 5, 3, 3, MODE_SMA, 0, MODE_SIGNAL, Current + 0);
double StochMain1 = iStochastic(NULL, 0, 5, 3, 3, MODE_SMA, 0, MODE_MAIN, Current + 1);
double StochSignal1 = iStochastic(NULL, 0, 5, 3, 3, MODE_SMA, 0, MODE_SIGNAL, Current + 1);

Here is the actual entry code.

Inserted Code
if(AC1 > AC2 && AO1 > AO2 && PSAR < Middle && Open[0] < Close[0] && StochMain < 50 && StochSignal < 50 && StochMain > StochMain1 && StochSignal > StochSignal1 && StochMain > StochSignal) Order = SIGNAL_BUY;
if(AC1 < AC2 && AO1 < AO2 && PSAR > Middle && Open[0] > Close[0] && StochMain > 50 && StochSignal > 50 && StochMain < StochMain1 && StochSignal < StochSignal1 && StochMain < StochSignal) Order = SIGNAL_SELL;

Just match the variables with the entry code and see if there's something wrong.

--- 帖子 #331 ---

I'm actually still long on Eur/Jpy from the 5th of June. It looks as if the AO will be exhausted today and close as red, at which point I'm exiting.

A cool few hundred pips collected there...

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Still holding my short.  Guys don't panic.  Stick to the system, it works long term. If you didn't enter it initially because you were hesitant, that's all well and good.  But if you entered and then start bailing out when such things occur based on FEAR, then you're gonna get nowhere in trading, that much I can guarantee.

SL is fixed, TP is fixed, looked a good short, and I confidently took it.

If I get stopped out, fine - take it on the chin and move on.  But this trade aint over yet...

--- 帖子 #340 ---
whats your take profit set at?

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Thanks ASH for the encouragement. I'm learning on these long time frames you have to hold em and have a stomach for negative pippage in order to let these trades play out. Even if you hit your stop loss you have to follow the rules and look for the next setup. Unlike Pipnailer on the lower TF's these are long term and more productive. So you end up trading less, with higher probability and profitability. It is a mindset that has to be developed through repetitive practice and taking losses is all part of it. The beauty of this beast is more time away from the computer and not having to look at charts on lower tf's constantly going back anf forth to confirm indicators.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
I think you need the [1] with Open and Close to check the prior day instead of the newly formed bar. Hardly any trades passed the Stoch test from an EA point of view when used as a daily trader. (This may be because the EA is checking the Stoch on the newly formed bar? haven't figured it out yet)  I used the numbers below to start with before changing to variables on my daily trader.

I changed that part of the code to
Inserted Code if(AC1 > AC2 && AO1 > AO2 && PSAR < Middle && Open[1] < Close[1] && StochMain < 80 && StochSignal < 65 && StochMain > StochMain1 && StochSignal > StochSignal1 && StochMain > StochSignal) Order = SIGNAL_BUY;
if(AC1 < AC2 && AO1 < AO2 && PSAR > Middle && Open[1] > Close[1] && StochMain > 20 && StochSignal > 35 && StochMain < StochMain1 && StochSignal < StochSignal1 && StochMain < StochSignal) Order = SIGNAL_SELL;
With 'Every Tick' set to false I could never get a true condition out of either side of the || using the following code:
Inserted Code if (Order == SIGNAL_SELL && ((EachTickMode && !TickCheck) || (!EachTickMode && (Bars != BarCount))))
I don't know how to program well enough to know why it does not work so I cut out most of it for daily trading and used something like the following to make a daily only trader.
Inserted Code
if (Hour() == 0 && (Minute() <= 15))
{
TradeNow = True;
}
else
{
TradeNow = false;
}

if ((Order == SIGNAL_BUY ) && (TradeNow == true))
I also changed
Inserted Code          Ticket1 = OrderSend(Symbol(), OP_BUY, Lots, Ask, Slippage, Low[0], Ask + (Ask - Low[0]), "Buy(#" + MagicNumber + ") Trade #1", MagicNumber, 0, DodgerBlue);
Ticket2 = OrderSend(Symbol(), OP_BUY, Lots, Ask, Slippage, Low[0], Ask + (Ask - Low[0]), "Buy(#" + MagicNumber + ") Trade #2", MagicNumber, 0, DodgerBlue);
To
Inserted Code          Ticket1 = OrderSend(Symbol(), OP_BUY, Lots, Ask, Slippage, Low[1], Ask + (Ask - Low[1]), "Buy(#" + MagicNumber + ") Trade #1", MagicNumber, 0, DodgerBlue);
Ticket2 = OrderSend(Symbol(), OP_BUY, Lots, Ask, Slippage, Low[1], Ask + (Ask - Low[1]), "Buy(#" + MagicNumber + ") Trade #2", MagicNumber, 0, DodgerBlue);
If the Stoch test is too low, a new test needs to be added to avoid re-entry on a trade recently closed at TP. I used a PSAR test checking to see if middle had changed in the last 3 bars.

On the AskFX EA I am playing with having the second trade's SL being moved to BE+?? when the first trade closes for a profit. Then trailing the second trade by a large amount. Making sure the EA does not open any more trades while the one trade is still open.

It helps to walk away and do other matters, even better if you would have to leave the pc alone, LOL

Also interested to hear what the TP is from Ash.

So still in the CJ.

Out of the UJ after a fast scalp, just don´t rust it at the moment.

NO additional trades have been taken anymore by the EA after this EJ one.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
There are two potential TP's.

1st TP is set @ 106.32.

2nd TP is wait until AO turns green.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
I'm going to go against my original plan and short usdjpy.  I'm getting a good price after today's action.  That should outweigh the my self perceived risk of taking this trade.  Fingers crossed it doesn't break that resistance.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
I'm pleased when I get part of a forum post to look right! Editing an EA is so beyond me. I'm still letting it run with EachTickMode True now but at this time no trades. With everyone's help hopefully we'll get there. Sorry, but I'm about as much use as a chocolate fireguard right now.

And thanks for your continued input Nvwine and Ron.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Ok, I replaced the appropriate arrays with their "i" counterparts. Hopefully it works now. I'd do the testing myself, but I'm using Notepad to edit the EAs =D.The office computers won't let me install stuff.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
I got the idea he was talking about your CJ trade.

In any case, I was.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
1st TP for CHF/JPY is 102.31.

2nd TP for CHF/JPY is when AO turns green (upon candle close)

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Ash

can you explain (in detail (by marking the chart ?)) the 300 pips, you must have entered around 165.18?

R

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Ash what would you do if AO changes before the first TP is hit? Would you exit the trade or let it run?

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Good Job Ron.

I don't know how you can do that with Notepad. I have to put about 20 print commands around changes I make and then try to compile about 10 times per change before I get most changes to work properly.

The new AskFX EA takes trades now with 'Each Tick' set to false.  Back testing the EA with defaults only opened about 3 trades a year on the USDCAD.

For the back test shown below, I changed the Stoch main to 90 10 and signal to 80 20 instead of the default 50 50. This does not match the visual conditions or the rules. That is why I think something is still a little off.

EDIT:

I think the EA is following it's rules. There are not many trading opportunities to enter a trade following a strict interpretation of the Stoch rules and not using SS Trade rules.

Before the EA never took any trades. So a big improvement.

Backtest:

My results are not accurate as accurate as I would like. It is for EA testing only. I am using data with Sunday Bars because that is the only half-clean data I have.  Not all testing perriods were as good as the one shown.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
and may I add........

WHY 102.31 ??

--- 帖子 #355 ---
According to Ash's pdf the first take profit = the risk.

For my trade I entered at 10334 so stop loss would be at 10434 (100 pips) and take profit 1 will be 10234 (100 pips)

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Thanks, must have slipped my mind, too much reading on this side and then mixing things up, I guess

--- 帖子 #357 ---
re: the eur/jpy  this I asked about this am, the reason I took the trade is I had ODL meta platform and it showed a psar dot at the top of the candle. The Platform I usually us is IBFX and it does not show the psar.. Can anyone explain the difference to me??

thanx

Doc

--- 帖子 #358 ---
hi ash

the swing high on uj is where ? the candle where we got the signal ?? or where ?

thanks

--- 帖子 #359 ---
108.67, because this is a SS Trade.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Hi Ash,

What is your SL for the USDJPY? and how did you calculate it please? Also, What was the price you entered short?

I think what is happening here is going to be a very good example of money management.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
I'll be showing my newb-ness here for sure, but I haven't used the PSAR in depth at all.

I just noticed something interesting, though... when the dot changes sides, its value is the same as the most recent corresponding swing high or low.

So in other words, the value of the USDJPY dot on 6/20 is 108.57, which is the same swing high value of the candle on 6/16 from which it is calculated.

Most of you probably already know this, but it will help me figure out where to place my stops for secondary trades in the future.

-Dave

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Ash, sorry, you did already answered my questions in post #359.

Thank NuclearSecret for post #361.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
I've downloaded the new version from Ron and hopefully completed the amendments suggested by Nvwine. All compiled and attached.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
I think I've edited the wrong StochMain - there are quite a few. Any chance of attaching your amended EA Nvwine with all your settings? Sorry to be a nuisance.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Good stuff. Let's wait and see what happens.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
If it is in profit, I would exit, else I would let it run.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
I do not want to post any EAs in this thread. Ron makes corrections properly. I make dirty 'cut and paste', 'work around', type of edits. I feel it is problematic long term to have a bunch of poorly modified EAs spread through a thread. I don't want to turn Ash's thread into a discussion of which EA is better and which version is correct. I am doing more back testing. If I find additional areas that I think Ron may want to look at I will post it.

As I said in a previous post the EA trades as written just very seldom. This does not mean the EA is not working properly. The EA is mechanical. It does not use common sense. These EAs are not designed to enter SS Trades. I have attached a chart for the GBPUSD. I'm sure if you traded manually you would find more than 2 entries in 3 months. I checked all of them and the EA with default settings was trading properly in my opinion.

Any results posted from the EAs should not be considered when evaluating Ash's system. It is not easy to get an expert to trade the same as a skilled eye following all the rules.

I don't know if changing the Stoch values is the proper way to increase EA trades. I mentioned what I did before for debugging purposes.

If you do want to play with the EA, the two lines where I modified the Stoch values for my back test were next to each other in the Signal Begin(Entry) section of the EA. You could try some numbers like I did below. If you enter too many bad trades you will have to move closer to the defaults.
Inserted Code if(AC1 > AC2 && AO1 > AO2 && PSAR < Middle && iOpen(NULL, 0, Current + 0) < iClose(NULL, 0, Current + 0) && [b]StochMain < 80 && StochSignal < 70[/b] && StochMain > StochMain1 && StochSignal > StochSignal1 && StochMain > StochSignal) Order = SIGNAL_BUY;
if(AC1 < AC2 && AO1 < AO2 && PSAR > Middle && iOpen(NULL, 0, Current + 0) > iClose(NULL, 0, Current + 0) && [b]StochMain > 20 && StochSignal > 30[/b] && StochMain < StochMain1 && StochSignal < StochSignal1 && StochMain < StochSignal) Order = SIGNAL_SELL;

--- 帖子 #368 ---
usd/jpy at is like watching paint dry

35 pips movement up and down in the last 5 hours.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
I've changed the EAs so the Stoch level requirements are variable.

StochUpper is the limit the Stoch main and signal must be below in order to be a BUY

StochLower is the limit the Stoch main and signal must be above in order to be a SELL

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Thanks for your detailed post. I'll leave well alone then. I have just noticed that the first trade was opened and closed over my night and I didn't notice. It had a trailing stop which closed at -22 pips.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
If there's anything I've learned about Ash's systems is that they generally take a lot of time between signals on a single pair, and there's good reason for that.

Mechanical trading revolves around one main concept: The market has repeated-predictable imperfections where we can determine which way it needs to go.

So, yes, I guess it's okay to relax the rules just to make sure the EA takes the trades, but once that's established, return the settings to the system spec.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Thanks Ron. All loaded and I'm gonna stick with defaults for the rest of the week and see where we go from there.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
What is the veiw on usd/jpy still hold for another day?

Is there any milage left in it?

AC and AO red but stoch is crossing now below 50

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Still having the CJ going. DD 65

EU popped up and disappeared with a SL.

UJ initiated, DD 26

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Yep, I'm holding my short till I hit my TP!

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Hi Ror,

Yes, I entered my SS Long Trade for Eur/Jpy at the opening of the new candle, i.e. 165.18.  My SL was at the swing low, which was @ 161.73.

My 1st TP (as outlined in the PDF manual in the first post), is equal to the same number of pips of the close of the candle minus the low, which is 165.17 - 162.24 = 293 pips.  This TP was hit, and I moved my SL to break even.

The second TP was when the AO closed as red. This occured yesterday, at which point I closed my long for an additional 215 pips.

So in total, on that trade I made around 500 pips.

Hope the pic makes things clearer.

Thanks.

Ash

You mentioned S/R and Fibs being very important

as we are looking at the daily charts do you only use

S/R and Fibs from the  daily charts and nothing else.

thanks

I'm still holding the short on usd/jpy, currently up just 5 pips.

I don't see any new entries for today on FXDD.

I'm testing this system using IBFX also. I'll check that when their new day starts at 8:00 PM EST (USA).

dave

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Ash,

It is a wonderful system and hope to gain pips with this system. I have ibfx mt4 and in your posts you recommend fxdd to base our trade on. I went to their site, they only offer demo for 90 days. Do you know if they let you renew demo or open yet another one so that I keep using it without opening a live account with them at this point?

Thanks

Akalra

--- 帖子 #381 ---
I'm waiting for EURGBP long next day or two. Backtesting with this pair on this system looks very promising.

Of course, with my luck I've just jinxed it for everyone, so sorry in advance!!

-Dave

--- 帖子 #382 ---
on IBFX the psar has already flipped but waiting for ac and ao. the stoch is a little above the 50 line though so it would be second strength trade. I'll be checking other pairs in little while.

dave

--- 帖子 #383 ---
I could be wrong but I think that when the demo acct runs out it's just a matter of a few mouse clicks to open a new one:  FILE\OPEN AN ACCOUNT

Hope that helps (and that its correct!).

dave

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Yep, I only use a dedicated D1 chart.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Yeah, that's all you gotta do!

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Ash do you think this

1:30pm USDhttp://www.forexfactory.com/images/m...mpact_high.gifCore Durable Goods Orders m/m

Is going to affect our usd/jpy trade to our benifit ?

Is it best not to worry too much about these announcements ?

--- 帖子 #387 ---
I personally don't really worry too much about news announcements, unless it's the NFP.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
USD/JPY

Ash sorry to keep on about this trade but I have traded it on my live account since sunday night.

Now I have notice that now the AC has turned green and the stoch is below 50 and pointing up, as if a buy signal, do I hang on in the trade to see if it hits my s/l at 108.67.

I know win or lose thats the name of the game but what do you think?

also the daily rollover charges are stacking up, on a trade that on the daily average moves only about  90 pips.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Dude, hang in there.

You wanna test this system and see if it works?

Then go the whole hog and let the trade do it's talking.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Ash is right.  The problem I'm seeing is that many of you are using real live accounts to test the system.  That's taking on more risk than necessary.  You should be testing with a demo account unless you hate money.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Personally, I don't recommend trading for too long on demo accounts. In my opinion, to test a system, it's better to open a live micro account (tenth of a mini), and then test. This way, you're working with real money, and it will instill in to you the required attributes you need to cope with natural human emotions such as greed, fear, hope, etc...

--- 帖子 #392 ---
also, systems are often a product of the specific market they were developed in. waiting too long to impliment a system could see the market conditions change and the system losing its effectiveness.

of course the best systems overcome that, which is the hope for every system developer.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Dear Stormin Norman,

Be assured ASH did not wake up one morning and decided to throw this one out there. If you trade this you know these are based on trend changes on the daily and the three indicators give you a high level of profitable trades...Try it....you will like it...if your looking for a quick scalp in and out method this is not your dog. This method requires patience...slow and easy patience....to collect 100 plus pips easy...I would not worry about market conditions changing since this is suited for any pair... if some turn cold others will get hot...there are always trade setups on this one. Good Luck

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Bent the rules a little.... not first PSAR and Stochs not ideal..... but hey into some Pips and out when the AO changes. Ash would this be a secondary secondary strength trade??

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Ash,

Many thanks for the detailed reply, I understand perfectly. A chart is worth 1000 pips or something, as they say...

You run TWO trades (2lots, 2 stakes, £2...) and TOTAL the pips.

I have learned to calculate a trade PER LOT, so this (successful) UJ trade netted 500/2 = 250 pips

BTW, the first TP was a very close shave to the pip!

You don't use Spread Betting to trade? Why not?

At £1 a pip this (2 lot) trade needs a SL of £586!! which puts the method WAY out of my league.

Using the 3% rule this leads to a bank of about £20,000 for ONE pair!

Four pairs = £80,000.... Hmmmm

I note the FF way is to report only wins and usually off demo trades, losses are bad press!

Are you trading money and what is the win/loss ratio you have seen with the daily method?

thanks

rorieu

Have I got numbers right?

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Well, the chfjpy trade was a bust.  I actually had more confidence in that one than usdjpy.  Glad I'm only testing this system on a demo account :-)  Now I'm pulling for usdjpy, but not too worried as I won't lose any money with a demo.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Then that would be a system in which I am not interested. I would even go as far as question how good that system is.  Nobody can predict when the market conditions will change. If you try to do that you will have lost your shirt. That's not a good approach to trading.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
That's fine for you. The point of testing a system is to see whether it works or not. I've tested too many systems that don't work to put blind faith into something to which I'm just introduced. Moreover, I see so many people on here repeatedly ask the same questions about the rules of the system. Why would I use my hard earned money to test something especially if I'm not sure of the rules? That makes no sense. They also want to bail on trades when things start looking down. You are not going to effectively test a system if you have the fear of losing money because of a system in which you haven't built trust. You're not going to know if the system is any good if you keep bailing on trades because you have this fear of losing money. The better approach to me is to first test on a demo, then once you're familiar and comfortable with the system go live, even if its only for pennies. What a lot of new traders fail to understand is that it is better to limit your risk/exposure.

Of course, this is just my humble opinion and I'll continue to approach my trading in this way.

have you set TP at 1.5800 same as me?

good luck

ps. checkout usd/chf

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Would that constitute a rule, for example any XXX/CHF or XXX/JPY or GBP/XXX, etc? If we have already one trade short or long the same currency we don't take a new signal in any pair holding the same side for that currency?

Brasilforex,

Are you in those trades, if yes what level did you get in??? Thanks

--- 帖子 #422 ---
EURAUD looks correct but Ash said above that GBPCHF is a SS trade so stop loss should be at swing high around 2.0657

--- 帖子 #423 ---
It is indeed a long, but I won't be taking it, too much resistance for my liking around the 1.6550 area.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
I opend the orders now at GPB/CHF 2.0354 and EUR/AUD 1.6483.

I not entered at the open price, because i see de chart now but the correcty price to enter was :

EUR/AUD 1.6479.

eur/chf also looks like a short, any thoughts on that pair pls. Thanks

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Looking for the fib retracement one good point to exit or to move your stop loss is  1.6560 (but you can also use trailing stop 30 pips).

Just my opinion

--- 帖子 #430 ---
The problem is if you're going for just something like thirty pips, it's makes the reward:risk ratio quite poor.  Just bear that in mind.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
I don't see that on my FXDD platform.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Here's apear also

Just uploaded the chart

My opinion to exit or move to breakeven 1.6086

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Maybe not short yet for eur/chf, but based on the chart below will the short work/ Thanks

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Hi Ash,

At what point would you consider getting into this trade, when it breaks that resistance area? if so by how much?

thanks dave

--- 帖子 #435 ---
I would highly recommend the book "Trading in the Zone". You must try at least 15 trades of a system before you start changing. How will you know if YOUR system works if you continually change the entries and exits because you feel it is right. You need to remove emotion from your trading.  Read the system and at least follow it to the letter for at least 15 trades and if it is not working for you then alter it or abandon it. Be patience, it will all come together.

Pete

--- 帖子 #436 ---
I've been following along for sometime now and will try to post my entry set-ups. Some entries are open to personal opinion as to S and R levels. Basically I have been taking the entry signals irregardless of S/R levels. Exact entry time may also vary slightly. For example, today I traded a little before the new candle (FXDD open daily), whereas on other trades I may have entered 3 or 4 hrs late depending on my perception of the trade signal at the time entered. Some days signals will be missed.

This is a FXDD demo based on AshFx signals as I read them. . .I will be using microlots (.01 x 2entries) so that I have plenty of margin as I see that some SL levels will be 200 to 300 pips.

Be careful with this pair using this system... it ranges very tightly, and if you follow the rules, my observations are that you end up with more losers than winners.

You might get lucky, but I won't be taking this one.

Hi ASH and all,I have been a silent follower of this thread. Your system is wonderful. I have been using it on a demo on FXOPEN platform.I see obviously the EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY set for a short trade. I can also see EUR/CHF set for short trade too, but my problem with this last pair is very close to support level. Is the trade worth taking? Please post entry, SL and TP targets for the first twotrades come sunday night.Best regards

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Ash designed this system to be as automatic and non-discretionary as possible. Now, what I'm about to say is really against the current trend, but sometimes I feel is necessary:

Ignore the S/R levels. This system was designed presumably to take those into account, and generate signals accordingly.

I understand that you're trying to stop a bad trade, but given the general strength of these signals, what's to stop the price from piercing through support?

--- 帖子 #465 ---
EUR/CHF is hitting strong support level. That's the problem with that one. Paris

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Alot of good trades that i just missed. GBP/CHF, CAD/JPY, AUD/JPY. I wish i saw this thread a few days ago. Very nice system. Thanks, Ash

--- 帖子 #467 ---
The EUR/CAD is showing signals however the candle is bear and the stochs are past 50 level so this is a no go. Paris

--- 帖子 #468 ---
You're welcome Paris.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
I have been reading, studying, watching and admiring your trade setups, though have not followed any of it.

I am really impressed with the results so far. So I am thinking of joining you guys this week.

Like someone said above I think EJ and GJ meets the trade critaria. But  I have a problem with GJ. Do you trade that curency as well?

Overall nice setups and system. Gods blessings

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Welcome on board dude.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Exactly, candle is bearish.  No entry.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Ok everyone.

I am shorting GBP/JPY and EUR/JPY.

These trades are regular trades, all our conditions have been met perfectly.

HOWEVER, for GBP/JPY, I am setting my stop at the top of the swing high. This is because there is a very strong resistance at that point, and I feel we should use that to our advantage.

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Here is the powerful resistance I'm talking about on GBP/JPY.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Ash,

Sorry if you already said this, but what MT4 broker are you using for the signals?

Thanks,

Lcfx

--- 帖子 #475 ---
I'm using FXDD.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
So what if the candle for this pair turns red do we now enter?

Trino

--- 帖子 #477 ---
We entered at market opening, i.e. @ 167.53, because at the close of play on Friday last week, we had a short signal.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Ash,

From a technical point of view do EURCHF and CADJPY qualify as SS Trades today?

--- 帖子 #479 ---
CAD/JPY doesn't, EUR/CHF does.

However, I am not taking EUR/CHF due to impending support.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
I' got into the GBP/JPY too and i placed my stop loss at resistance which is about 230 pip stop loss. I guess that's not too much considering GBP/JPY on the daily time frame. Paris

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Thanks Ash  - I'm in as well!!

freddi

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Me too

--- 帖子 #483 ---
hi ash

could you please when you enter a position say what is your sl ?

regards

imad

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Hi ash:

I'm getting to the two trades late, they have both moved against where the original entry would have been.  One by 40 pips and one by 15 pips.  Would you still enter and just consider this getting a better entry point because of the retracement, or stay out of the trades, they were the GBP/JPY and the EUR/JPY. Thanks

Jim

--- 帖子 #485 ---
I'm in with short order in GBP/JPY and EUR/JPY.

GBP/JPY@211.74

EUR/JPY@167.54

--- 帖子 #486 ---
From the rules set in the PDF document (see first page of the thread):

EXIT
Initial stop loss is at the high / low of the candle (day's high if going short, day's low if going long).

And especially in today's case Ash just wrote:

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Generally speaking, how far back do you look for a swing? Because I'll try to code in a detection loop into the EA to look for highest/lowest points in a specific range.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Am waiting for it to go down, put the sell stop @ 167.10

sonic

--- 帖子 #489 ---
CADJPY did not qualify because it was the 2nd day since the triggers lined up?

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Short USDJPY and GBPCHF opened over my night. Short USDJPY from last week still open and stop moved manually to break even.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Everybody wich opened one EUR/AUD (buy order) last 27th cotinues opened same me ?

--- 帖子 #492 ---
yep lets see where she takes us

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Hi Ash I been trying your system and I like it thank you , I am also short e/y and g/u ,good luck to all

--- 帖子 #494 ---
hello again ash,

do you have any good refference or share ebook which teaches about support and resistance? thank you.

does fxpro time server is same as FXDD?

and the last is the SL of EJ is 169.40 and GJ is 213.90?

thank you for the great system

--- 帖子 #495 ---
I can maybe answer two of your three questions.

2) FxPro server has the same time as FXDD (GMT+3)

3) Ash only mentioned GBPJPY stoploss being at the last swing high, so I suppose that for EURJPY it would be set as per the rules (that is, high of the signal candle).

--- 帖子 #496 ---
hi again

i m really confused about the sl . could you please tell us where was your stop loss for ej .

thanks

imad

--- 帖子 #497 ---
gj just touched 100 pips closed half moved stop loss to BE

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Just seen this now sorry. If you stay out, you don't lose pips, put it that way.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
It is the high of the candle that signaled the trade.

So initial SL is at: 168.58

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Good to see most of us getting in these two trades on GBP/JPY and EUR/JPY.

Happy pips everyone.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Sorry Ash, why did you short Yen two times? (EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY)

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Ash I am also in on the gbp/jpy and eur/jpy

mega pips to us all!

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Could not be happier with this system.

I trail my positions and may have gotten out too early but +140 on EJ, +204 on GJ

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Because there was a signal on each of the two pairs on Friday evening.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
All closed at TP. Ron, any way the EA can close one instead of both and move the SL to break even as per the strategy, please? A trailing stop would then be needed to manage the remaining trade. I would have done it manually but I went out for breakfast.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
when do you think is a good exit point for EurJpy?

--- 帖子 #507 ---
At the close of the daily bar when AO turns green

--- 帖子 #508 ---
thanks ashfx .  a great day

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Which EA are you using?

--- 帖子 #510 ---
i was about to ask thesame thing Ronnie

--- 帖子 #511 ---
More great days to come.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
I woke up this morning to find my two trades GJ and EJ have already hit take profit. Banked over +320 pips in one day!!!!!!!! Now there's a retracement but there could be alot more pips in the next days coming. Thanks again, Ash

Paris

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Hi Ash

Received your EJ signal yesterday. Is there any significance in the purple lines on your chart?

Love the system - it suits my time availablity to trade.

Thanks

fxray

PS: Took the trade and banked 96pips. (real money)

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Wow, another good day

My G/J order touched the TP. + 195 pips and the E/J closed with +87 pips because a set trailing stop at 45 pips.My results since the end of last week:

GPB/CHF ( SELL) closed +59 pips

EUR/AUD (BUY)   running

EUR/CHF (SELL) closed +40 pips.

This week

GBP/JPY (venda) closed +195 pips

EUR/JPY (venda) closed + 87 pips

Accumulated : +381 pips

Excellent system to me !

--- 帖子 #515 ---
I left my gbp/jpy and eur/jpy running, returned from work to find massive retrace have now closed both at total +84 pips hey ho live and learn, still pips up!

What is the veiw on re-entering these trades again tonight, if it all lines up on Ash's system?

I have noticed that AUD/NZD short .........poss for tuesday, subject to AO change any one else see this trade?

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Hi,

eur/usd H4 seems to comply ash rules. Does anyone think it is a short on H4. thanks

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Hi All,

USD/CAD looks a good buy for tues with a bullish candle already

Anybody agree

Paul

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Yes, I'm looking at the CAD as well - possible resistance at 1.0322?

fxray

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Paul,

I agree - looks good. I'm going to wait for end of day.

Freddi

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Ron,

I noticed the same thing on my AskFX EA. Two trades open and closed at the same price. The EA worked well though all winners.

One other thing to look at. If you do not enter a trade on the first day the signal is available or if you reach TP, this EA will re-enter the same trade (if the signal condition is still valid). The EA does not check how many days the valid signal has existed before placing an order.

I observed the re-entry after a TP condition during back tests.

Edit: I forgot to mention that when the EA is modified to let one trade run until the AO changes color it also helps the re-entry problem.

I attached my statement, log files, and the EA I am using (the most recent version) below so you can see my settings.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
hi, sharon, can this template apply on H4 EU?

Ash....how?

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Hi Ash or anybody

I am still unsure about the stochs tales having crossed above /below 50

Is it both stoch lines tales have to be over the 50 as a secondry trade or just the main signal line.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Hi Blackdog

That's a very good question, I'm guessng it would be the faster line. If you wait for the slower line then you could be approaching overbought territory. Perhaps Ash has the answer.

I've only just started using the system myself this past week

fxray

--- 帖子 #524 ---
This is what I was referring to in the question asked in post 103:
http://forexfactory.com/showpost.php...&postcount=103

I am pretty sure it's an issue related to Parabolic SAR conditions.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Looks good to me too

--- 帖子 #526 ---
It is not a simple fix (at least for me) when you consider the SS trades that do not need every condition to be met. The re-entry problem may be solved when the EA leaves one trade open until the AO changes.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
I haven't tested the system on H4, so I really dunno what kind of results you'd expect.

--- 帖子 #528 ---
If EITHER of the Stoch lines are beyond the 50 line, it means it's a SS Trade.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Got my first ASH Signal Last night...Closed this morning for many pips (110 ) I think.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Ok guys, here is an update on today's trades so far.

GBP/JPY: First position hit TP - closed it for 123 pips profit; moved SL to BE, leaving remaining position open till AO closes as green.

EUR/JPY: First position hit TP - closed it for 97 pips profit; moved SL to BE, leaving remaining position open till AO closes as green.

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Hi Ash

AO or AC?

That would make a great difference

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Is there a trade on USD/CAD. Any one going to take it

--- 帖子 #533 ---
The code in my EA is designed to manage two trades. One trade is for the regular take profit. The other trade is for the opposite AO. Entering during a 'stale' signal is a problem. I just need to add some "one-function-is-not-true-for-previous-bar" function to sort that out. Do you think you can pull one together?

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Hi,

Seems like usdcad is going to be a long, anyone in the trade already. I was waiting for today's close but seems like it is very bullish. Any comments. Thanks

--- 帖子 #535 ---
I believe it's too close to it's resistance for a good RR ratio, looking for opportunities on the downside seems more favourable - what does everyone else think?

Trino

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Anyone taking the USD/CAD trade? Paris

--- 帖子 #537 ---
I've been analysing the CAD and will not trade it personally for no other logical reason than I don't get a good feeling about what I see!

fxray

Observation: 1hr & 4hr stocks are both in overbought territory - PT1 would be around 10362 above the 10322 resistance area...

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Apologies, my mistake. Till AO closes as green.

I have rectified the error in my post.

Thanks Howard.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Guys, even though the USD/CAD fulfills the conditions of a valid long, I personally am not going to trade it.

Resistance is strong, and the SL at swing low is much larger than the TP would be if it reversed at resistance (which is where I would probably place my TP if I did enter).

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Hi Ash,

What is your opinion on the usd/cad pair pls. Thank you

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Don't take it for reasons explained above.

(Remember, just because the system gives a signal doesn't mean we have to take it).

--- 帖子 #542 ---
I'm out of this trade also, the risk is high because of the bullish and resistance.

So, i'm no trades to me today using this excellent system

--- 帖子 #543 ---
SS Trade if anybody interested

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Apear here to me too

Looks good to few pips i will try

Put my initial TP at 50 pips and better set the stop at 1.2685 .

Anyone confirm and like that?

--- 帖子 #545 ---
AO is still red for me, so no trade.

--- 帖子 #546 ---
The AUD/NZD is indeed a SS short setup, but I don't usually trade this pair due to its high spread.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
The only problem point wich i see here is the 2 high news for today.

4:30  AUD http://www.forexfactory.com/images/m...mpact_high.gif  Cash Rate

4:30  AUD http://www.forexfactory.com/images/m...mpact_high.gif  RBA Rate Statement

GMT based timezone.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
I was looking at that too aud/nzd, was hoping to short at 1.2600 if seen, if rba does not hike we can see 1.22 since this pair is long due for correction.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
I just got in AUD/NZD. Will see how it goes. My spread is 8 pips.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Hopefully GBP/JPY (and EUR/JPY) will resume it's downtrend after that horrible retrace...

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Hi Ash,

With tankan today do you think we will see a rally if it is bad. Thanks

--- 帖子 #552 ---
hi

what GMT  time , the first candle of the day start with FXDD

--- 帖子 #553 ---
hi ashfx

do you see any  possible trade for today ?

thanks

imad

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Ash is using FXDD which begins a new candle at 5:00 PM EST.

I use FXDD too and they don't stop hunt or spike. A good fair brokerage. Paris

--- 帖子 #555 ---
My AO on USD/CAD is red! No trade!

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Went long on USD/CAD (SST). Is this the correct setup Ash? I know the AO doesn't agree but I think your rules allow this.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
FXDD is GMT+3. So first candle would start at 21:00 GMT of the previous day.

--- 帖子 #558 ---
hi acfxtrader

why u say AO do not agree , it s green , and ac green , and we have the dot of psr under the daily candle of yesterday . ? so obviously it is a long . or maybe i am missing something . ashfx could you please check the setting of acfxtrader please on fxdd and odl AO is green

thanks

--- 帖子 #559 ---
The signal candle is 1 left of the current candle. The AO was red.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
lcfxtrader

yes you are right , i enter it live already . i forget the previous candle . hope will be ok

imad

--- 帖子 #561 ---
It looks like a buy to me on the Daily using another system which is in agreement with observations here. The resistance at 1.0200 is a source of worry so how about a limit order at 1.0225 to be sure R is broken?

--- 帖子 #562 ---
AskFX. NOT the entry only version.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Hi ASH..

I have tried your system, i think it needs some adjustment. I made money with (daily basis up to 50 pips at the moment, SL & TP as suggested - for safe side normally I SL 150 ~ 200 and TP 160~250, depends on the market movement.

At this very moment im profitting 55 pips. Looking forward to refine your systems with mine. When ready, I will post the result and links for downloads for the forum members to review and comments. I hope you done mind

Cent3nos

--- 帖子 #564 ---
hello ash,

at the very first post you upload the pic, i  want ask few questions regarding that. 1. i think that is a valid signal, why you didnt consider that as the signal?

2. what time frame you usually drawing and knowing support and resistance ?

thank you ash,

best regards

--- 帖子 #565 ---
potential setup on this pair. any comments?

--- 帖子 #566 ---
yes it will be an SS trade if psar flips over with stop above 0.9666

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Account is Looking Strong ATM. . .

--- 帖子 #568 ---
The valid long entry from last week for both the manual system and EA is now at +50 pips. Ash didn't take it because of strong resistance which has now, finally, been broken. Full details in my signature below.

Psar has flipped on my broker IBFT

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Thank you Ash for sharing your system, I have been trading it on a micro acct. with very good results so far. Will continue to test it out.

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Is ibft the same as ibfx, cause i got the psar flip on ibfx, now just have to wait till 8pm New york time, when candle closes to enter trade. If everything stays as is.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
yes i believe we are talking the same

The  EUR/AUD (BUY)  closed . + 79 pips

Accumulated : +460 pips  since last week .

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Setup is correct for a SS Long.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
1. Due to resistance.  Look what happened, it bounced straight off the resistance.

2. Daily.  I don't look at multiple time frames for this system.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Hi All,

Anyone going for Aud Usd short tonight taking into consideration that Aud retail sales are due at 2.30am gmt and building approvals also at 2.30am gmt plus USD Non farm employment change at 1.15pm gmt

We would have to put very tight stops if we go for it

Thanks Paul

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Hi Paul,

I don't see this signal on FXDD. What platform are you using?

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Brave man for taking that lol.  Nice one.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
AUDUSD has no signal (yet). It would have to drop additional 20 pips (or 6 from the low) to bring up a change of PSAR.

Stop rules for this system are set at the high of the candle (for a short position).

(I am making myself sound quite robotic but it's an exercise of discipline, not particularly directed at anyone but me.)

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Well, this is what I see for the A/U.

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Ash has tested and uses the system on FXDD (GMT+3) and advised that it would be better to do so.

In my opinion it is better to have a normalized view and agreement upon charts and signals... but maybe would be also interesting to see how it could perform on other timezones?

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Hi Ash,

I am using ODL

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Hi Ash

Pic for you

--- 帖子 #584 ---
ODL is 2 hours forward on GMT

FXDD is 1 hour behind GMT

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Hmmm, interesting, thanks.

Looks like a decent set up as well.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Thanks Ash.

The only thing that worries me is the AUD retail sales at 2.30am gmt and the USD Nonfarm employment change at 1.15pm gmt

Might keep me out of the trade

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Don't worry too much about that.  If you're gonna enter, then place your stop at the swing high, it's a strong resistance.

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Just a sidetalk. Take a look at this as well.  Thats Fxpro Chart. My question is why do we have great differences in the charts?

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Ok guys, this is NOT an official trade.

However, I am shorting AUD/USD @ 0.9548.  I'm trading smaller lots on this.

SL is 1 pip above swing high which is: 0.9667

1st TP is: 0.9505

2nd TP is when AO closes as green

--- 帖子 #590 ---
The PSAR not apear here yet wich parameters are you using in PSAR ?

However i will use the signals from forexmoments

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Hi,

Gone in at 0.9550 short

T/P = 0/9505

S/L = 0.9668

Fingers crossed and good luck to all

I don't remember luck or crossed fingers as part of the original strategy.

But it's ok on demo accounts.

I love trading but I get emotional sometimes. Not good.

Thanks Ash for a simple strategy that helps me reduce fear and greed.

thanks brazilforex

--- 帖子 #596 ---
welcome

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Ash,

As per your rules, do we not wait for the close of the signal candle and start of new candle b4 we enter the trade?

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Because many different brokers have different starting times, and price feeds as well.

FXDD and FxPro servers are at GMT+3 both, but FXDD doesn't have a sunday candle. Both start the day at 21:00 GMT.

ODL and IBFX are at GMT+0 and start the day at 00:00 GMT.

Alpari is at GMT+1, I think. And so on.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Guys I just got the daily candle on IBFX and the PSAR did not go short...

--- 帖子 #600 ---
What pair are you talking about if it is aud/usd it is short

--- 帖子 #601 ---
OOpps, Sorry about that, yes AUD/USD. Everything else looks good and I know that you're all using FXDD so my signals are diffrent.

I'm going to set a stop order just under the monthly pivot @ .9525 and see how it develops.

Thanks for the great system FX Moments!

--- 帖子 #602 ---
I use both odl and IBFX it is a short on both my friend

--- 帖子 #603 ---
If i'm making a mistake then please correct me, but on the chart below the PSAR is still long.

I'm new here but I think i get the gist of the system.

THX!

--- 帖子 #604 ---
OK, now I'm eating crow! I'm on a different lap top and did not change my PSAR to .03-.02. This does make a difference! I agree, it's a good signal!!

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Now you are on the right track, Cheers friend. Good luck

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Thank You!

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Just discovered this thread, and looks very interesting. I see FXDD is used, but I have a demo and real account with IBFX. Loaded the templates and the EA, and the first trade was made shorting the AUD/USD today, Quite surprised at the difference in entry, exit and TP versus FXDD. My entry was 9543 with a stop of 9592, and a Take Profit of 9494. Not quite sure how the EA got 9494. I think it should be 9641. But, I'm brand new to this system, and undoubtedly others here have the answer. Used to faster trading, but from the looks of it, this system produces some serious pips for those who have the patience and can handle drawdowns of 150 pips. I think the way to handle the potential drawdowns is simply to use money management. All in all, once I catch on to the rules, looks like this is a system that will be very easy, fun, and profitable.

hi all,first of let say a big thank you to forex moment for his wonderful concept,i have been following this thread day by day,i suppose that 1 of the rule in trading forex is that we should beware of news with heavy impact,i dont see why that should jave been ignored,if anyone had gone in one AUD/USD it would have a disaster,gus i think we should always respect THE NEWS.Get ready 4 GBP/USD in a day or two it should e good to go.this is the thread that i found very very interesting.keep up the good work forex moment and everyone else.

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Looks like we are going to have a lot of buys in the short time frame before any good reversal for short. The 1hr R1 has been broken. I'm just wondering if one would need to bail out on this one. Any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #611 ---
based on the trend direction from the daily time frame it is likely to reverse afterall the upward movement was caused by the news which came out at 0.7% against 0.1%,the impact was so high that is moved about +50 pips,the price is overbought so it should be getting ready to drop,use the psar,stoch and channel indicator to the right when the reverse begins and be sure to make at least a +100 pips on the short.

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Hi Ash,

Looks like the Aud/Usd is going against us, iys at minus £57 at present, should we stay in or cut our losses

The PSAR is still red

Thanks

Paul

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Thanks for the input, what do you mean by "use the channel indicator to the right"

I suppose now i am in its best to stay in as the H4 and H1 look overbought

Paul

--- 帖子 #614 ---
On the contrary take a look at the 4hr. The Psar Is just appearing on that one...While the stoch says oversold and upward reversal imminent.

The bad thing about reading the market using Stoch only is that it lags. For example look at GU on the Daily. It is now reading 100. Why hasnt Gu dropped like hiroshima?

Just my thoughts and I hope am wrong b/c am in this trade as well...We might see a good upward move before a major drop. Not bad but then it depends on your acct bal. and risk tolerance

Like I said...just my thoughts

Hi Ash,

Yeo agree with you after i sent the message i thought to myself that in this game you have to stick to your decisions and if your decision is to take a trade then with all the stop losses and T/P in place you shouls have the guts to see it through

After all what was your mindset when you took the trade, you cannot change your mind half way througha trade just because its going wrong, the only way to suceed in this game is to sticks to your trades

Thanks

What was ur reasons for going long?

--- 帖子 #621 ---
cus it did,nt broke the prevuios week low,there was more than one candle supporting 0.9511 on 4hr tf

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Well guys I feel Ash was right on a earlier post, you need to trade at some stage with real money, a small account micro or mini,  it has  puts a different slant on things , as you probably can tell from some of my posts lots of fear and worry, so I now have taken in  what Ash has said, you make your choice  enter the trade and stick with it.
I will now shut up and switch off when trades go against me, and maybe try to stop watching every pip of movement.
lol

--- 帖子 #623 ---
I come back to your short weekly recommendation on EUR/JPY: Plse comment what is going on at 168.40. I went short with 3 trades on 166.01: the lowest point

beware

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Totally agree, we should all pin this post to a board close to our computers, life is full of decisions, right or wrong, and as you say when its real money we all tend to panic a bit but if we look at the charts, S & R lines and TP points then stick with our trade and BELIEVE in our trades thats all we can do

You have to have money to lose and if you lose well its just another lesson into the book of life and learning and you will not maek the same mistake twice.

I expect to lose on the Aud/Usd trade but put it down to experience and move on, we will all win double back what we lose.

I have demoed ASH's system and it works and if i dont go live now i never will but i have spare money to lose, not saying that i want to lose it but its part and parcel of trading, look at the end of July and lets see if we are in profit.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Hi Guys,

Look at eurgbp, seems could be a good long for target 81. Does anyone think this is a signal. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #628 ---
yep looks like it will be a signal to me if everything holds

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Do you consider it a valid trade? What about the PSAR?

--- 帖子 #630 ---
I see the same thing on my IBFX chart....a long trade. Being new to this system, my question is....isn't this a SS trade based on the daily chart of yesterday, with entry today at the start of today's candle? What would change the set up for this pair or any other pair, since the trades are based on the day before?

--- 帖子 #631 ---
On my chart todays candle is the first candle with the psar under it signaling a long with entry at close of today and yes a ss trade because stochs are above the 50

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Eur/gbp has taken out the important resistance at 7955, so if it closes above 7955 today, a good chance that 81 is in play. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Just a thought...... is it worth raising our stop loss a little on the Aud/Usd trade from

0.9669 ? one pip above the high.

At the moment its 0.9624 so 45 pips is not a lot of breathing space for the start of tomorrows daily candle.

Any veiws on this guys?

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Let's wait the nest candle because now he still in the resistence line at 0.7968.

I don't know if this is will be one good trade.

I opened one trade in this par using another system but give me - 107, but today my tp (in this trade) was touched.

And tomorrow will have lot of high impact news.

--- 帖子 #635 ---
I could be missing something,and probably am. As I look at the chart, the EUR/GBP qualifies today as a SS trade, based on the yesterday one day chart. Is there something today that could alter that?

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Ash,

Do you place trades as normal at the start of the day when the NFP report is released?

--- 帖子 #637 ---
I think the best person to answer is Ash. Could you kindly comment on this setup Ash. Thanks

--- 帖子 #638 ---
EUR/GBP is not a valid AshFX signal.

It has to be on a first PSAR appearance.

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Thank's for the official report !

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Hi Ash,

I dont understand, it is on the FIRST PSAR. Why isnt it valid?? Thanks

--- 帖子 #641 ---
wish i could post my chart cause mine is on first psar also

--- 帖子 #642 ---
To me not apear on first .

--- 帖子 #643 ---
No signal on my Eu/Gb FXDD chart

FxRay

--- 帖子 #644 ---
try this

--- 帖子 #645 ---
The earlier chart was from ODL, this is IBFX which also shows the PSAR.

--- 帖子 #646 ---
I use Fxdd and Interbank. (Fxdd for the Ash system) There is a 3 hour difference between the close of the daily candle so this seems to create quite different signals for the system. I beleive Ash uses FXdd?

fxray

3 hour difference between Interbank & fxdd close of candle

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Really confuse now, but my broker is GMT+3 .

--- 帖子 #648 ---
AshFX System recommends FXDD demo for signals.

--- 帖子 #649 ---
I see no regular trades today. The PSAR had not changed direction at the close of the daily bar on any FXDD currency pairs.

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Hi

I use alpari (which is close to FXDD signals) and there was no signal

for the AshFX system.on the EUR/GBP

--- 帖子 #651 ---
Is it at least close?

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Hi Ash,

I think the type of platform we use should not influence the system because the data that is fed is almost the same, what may differ is the time perhaps since the opening and the closing of the candle is different.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
I think it can make a large difference in the daily signals. Having a platform that includes an extra day changes mathematical calculations. Even two platforms with server times of GMT+3 can have different weekly opening and closing times.

I am surprised that everyone  has not downloaded a FXDD platform so their charts will match Ash's. The best way to learn a system is to compare your own trades with the system's author. There have been many posts related to this. I think the thread would be easier to read and understand if only one broker's charts were discussed and posted.

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Hi,

The odl has an extra day but ibfx does not, the signal does appear on both, so I am not sure if the extra day does play a role. Beside the Ash sytem is based on technical setting therefore regardless of what platform it should give the same outcome. It is like even though you use diffrent calculator everyone should give the same answer. Just my two cents.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
Its possible that everyone is not using the same PSAR and settings.

I have been using the Parabolic Sar Color alert post #48, which is not part of the default mt4 indicators. (default settings: step 0.04 max 0.5)

I also added the parabolic SAR that comes with MT4

insert->indicators->Parabolic Sar to display at the same time.

(default settings: step 0.02 max 0.5) I can see both versions of charts that have been displayed by different traders.

Hope this helps

--- 帖子 #656 ---
hello

did any one found a signal today ?

thanks

--- 帖子 #657 ---
PSAR settings reset per post #1. No difference between the PSAR's now. I will use these settings.

Thank you AshFX for this fine system. I am still in the AUD/USD trade

--- 帖子 #658 ---
No signal today.

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Contemplating EG and went in Live conservatively though.

--- 帖子 #660 ---
Please reconcile the above quote with this quote below, from the AshFx PDF document..

"Final Points

Please bear in mind that when entering a trade, it doesn't matter in which order the indicators may line up, eg. the AO and the AC don't have to change colour at the same candle as the first PSAR dot appearing. Or perhaps the AO/AC/Stochs might be compliant before the first PSAR dot appears, or vice versa, and this is fine."

thanks, dave

--- 帖子 #661 ---
That's a good question, but it seems like what would make eur/gbp invalid was the fact that the stoch was well above fifty by the time everything else was in alignment. No?

--- 帖子 #662 ---
On the FXDD charts the stoch signal line was only at 52.8129,the other at 66.1157, both below 80 so should qualify as a SS trade.With all that said though, i'm staying out of that trade for now. We might see a retrace of that last candle. Maybe if the stoch was below 50.......

dave

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Let's cool all the fire here now about EURGBP

1st Rule of the Thumb - Follow Ash's Rule

2nd Rule - Download FXDD MT4 - For your Charts Only, Trade elsewhere.

Ok if am not wrong I used PIP Nailer to confirm if there is a signal for today and yes there is one.. See Attached.

So anyway to conform with Ash Daily lets follow the rules above they are only 2 and simple..

Regards

SmartKenya

--- 帖子 #664 ---
I agree 100% with you!!  It really is very simple...AshDaily calls for the use of FXDD to generate signals..other platforms WILL generate different signals because they use either a different 'start of day' time AND/OR different data feed AND/OR a Sunday candle.

By all means use a different platform if you wish to, but please don't keep posting your "signals" or asking Ash for his comments ...you already know his views...he uses FXDD.

So use FXDD (it's FREE!!) to generate your signals and the broker of your choice for trading.

Thanks,

Freddi

--- 帖子 #666 ---
As a general rule, only if Stochs are above 80, (or below 20 for sell), is the trade invalid.

The reson why EUR/GBP was invalid was because on FXDD, it was not a first PSAR appearance.

--- 帖子 #667 ---
EG still going good for me

--- 帖子 #668 ---
omo kiloun happen u don go live for ashfx? e be like say na im b d tin oo

--- 帖子 #670 ---
I can see clearly now....

--- 帖子 #671 ---
I absolutely agree. I had the same issues with my broker but since I've downloaded the metetrader from fxdd i can follow this system much easyier.

I RECOMMEND all to download from www.fxdd.com for posting on this thread.

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Ash, does this hold true when you are still in a trade and a valid reverse signal is thrown (either 1st or 2nd strength)?  Do you still hold on to the trade or do you close your positions & go the other way?

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Accumulated : +353

Running  AUD/USD (Sell)

--- 帖子 #674 ---
possible signal on this pair anyone confirm with me

--- 帖子 #675 ---
It still holds true.

--- 帖子 #676 ---
Excuse me?

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Ash,

on the Au/Us trade that we are still into, and i think i know what the answer is to this, is do we leave the stop loss at 9668 now it has dropped a bit or do we move stop loss to high of yesterday candle at 9648 as there is now a clear trend line down from yesterdays candle

bet you say leave stop loss at 9668

Thanks

Paul

--- 帖子 #678 ---
There looks like a SS signal on the EUR/AUD for today. Paris

--- 帖子 #679 ---
I dont think so , becouse AO indicator is green.

--- 帖子 #680 ---
The market is ranging alot around that area and will need about a 250 pip stop loss so I may pass on this signal.

--- 帖子 #681 ---
I just can't believe there is a trader called Paris Hilton

Just too funy.   Good for you.

--- 帖子 #682 ---
That's o.k. as this still qualifies it as a signal second strength.

--- 帖子 #683 ---
There's a resistence at 1.6265. I stay out.

Fxmoments; he(Falinowo) his supposed to be talking to me....

--- 帖子 #686 ---
it is a second strenght trade, in this case the AO can be still green as it will change the color on next few bars. but as paris said the stop loss is very high.

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Sorry all here, wrong review since the next bar will start in few minutes.

--- 帖子 #688 ---
Bet you I do too, lol. But this doesn't mean you can't use your own initiative. Remember, this system isn't perfect, far from it. If you feel you have a valid reason to adjust your stop, by all means go for it.

--- 帖子 #689 ---
I se one EUR/AUD valid signal.

Anyone more than me can confirm that?

--- 帖子 #690 ---
Hi Brasil

I've taken it as a demo trade...currency has been a bit range bound but as it's demo...

FxRay

--- 帖子 #691 ---
It seems a valid signal to me as well. Too bad I don't trade that pair because of the 10 pips spread  ...

--- 帖子 #692 ---
That is correct but stop should be around 240 pips away

--- 帖子 #693 ---
Lookin  fibo, one good point to move the Stop is 1.6295.

I'm in the real account but set 45 trailing stop

--- 帖子 #694 ---
I went short on the pair.

Bar open: 1.6351

Price: 1.6350 (due to movement after open)

SL: 1.6537 (previous bar's high / 186 pips)

TP: 1.6165 (Bar open - 186 pips)

I also went long on AUD/NZD although it doesn't follow the rules (AC / AO were both red).  Used swing low since stoch was abobe 50.

Bar open: 1.2686

Price: 1.2694 (due to movement after open)

SL: 1.2534 (swing low / 152 pips)

TP: 1.2838 (Bar open + 152 pips)

--- 帖子 #695 ---
if U can make 100 pips -10 for dpread its not good ?

--- 帖子 #696 ---
AUD/NZD show valid signal to me using another system not this one.

But, good luck

--- 帖子 #697 ---
I wouldn't have done it on a real account but since it's a demo I'm not worried.  A lot can happen in a day's time so we'll see were it goes.

--- 帖子 #698 ---
I have spent the day reading through the entire thread and I have to say I'm inspired to try it.  As for Support and resistance, there seems to be a lot of thought taken with that when a trade is placed or if a trade is placed.  Does anyone know of an indicator for S/R?  Would anyone like to take a moment and share how they apply S/R to a daily chart?  I have read many posts asking this question and many times people get shot down asking it so I apologize in advance.  It just seems that if it's that important to making an additional decision on top of the existing guidelines then maybe we should discuss the technique more?  Maybe something that could be added to an EA when the possible trade is being decided?

I have written a number of EA's over the past 4 years and program by profession.  I would be more than happy to incorporate something into the existing EA or write the EA from scratch.

I'm a newcomer to this thread and I'm not looking to step on anyone's toes.  Just introducing myself and offering my services.

Hey ash,

Nice system you got here.I hope you won't end up like OZFX who is

now charging 250USD PER MONTH for his signal.

keep it up mate.

B

--- 帖子 #702 ---
Yeah;but Ash has clearly said that he will never charge for signals based on his system.

Oz really disappointed his true enthusiasts.How would one charge signals for a system you shared to the world.And to other other side;how would one pay for a system or knowledge you learnt.A System is a System,especially for basically mechanical ones like that of OZs.I wonder what one is paying for again when the calls/signals are based on the system you practised for more than 3 months.

--- 帖子 #703 ---
Thanx Ash for sharing your profitable system!

--- 帖子 #704 ---
My 2 pips only..

OzFX gave us a way to get our own signals the system why say he is doing wrong selling. You already have a way to get the signal. All we have to do is ask RR or someone else knowledgable create a Signal EA with a Dashboard capable of monitoring multiple pair.

As for AshFX I will vouch for him he has Alot to gain for helping others. In life you gain more when you help or give something free to the public.

All I can hope for is that each one of us has subcribed to free signal but also we try to learn the strategies we love and make it a habit to live by the rules....

Thank Ash

Bro,

Millions thanks.Ive following Ozfx since he started the thread in FF.But after he charging it,I made the decision to open (long or short)the post myself.But since AshFX open this thread,I'm using it as my filter.The only differences between this 2 gurus is PSAR and 200SMA.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Guys, let me make this clear. OzFX decided to charge for his signals which he had every right to. I don't want people cussing other people on this thread.

The only thing Oz did wrong was that he went against the forum rules. It's not as if he's done anything illegal.

I wanna be part of this forum forever, so like I have already stated, I will never charge money for AshFX signals. I will simply continue to support this thread.

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Hi Ash,

Do you post your signals here on this thread? I signed up for your emails a while back but havent recieved any yet? Have there been no official signals for over a week?

--- 帖子 #708 ---
Damon123

As far as I am aware, Ash will only post/email what he considers to be 'perfect' setups.

With this system I imagine signals would not be a daily occurence, perhaps only 1 or 2 per currency during a month.

HI friend,

I was actually reading thru this thread to see what's in it when i saw your question. I also read the answer given but wondered if that was helpful enough. I'd tell you something else you could do to get straight to recent posts: you can configure your user cp (control panel at the home page) to recieve instant mails of every new post in a thread you are subscribed to. By clicking on the link in your inbox, you'd be directed to the new page, instead of having to scroll through.

Hope this helps.

alright people after nfp distabilized the market as usual the usd pairs seem to be shaping up, tonight lets get ready

Are you using FXDD, because my chart shows this as a potential long as well but the bar hasn't completed yet.

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Thank you.

--- 帖子 #715 ---
I just opened my FXDD account, it does help with this system. But I only have  limited access to pairs and AUDJPY isn't one of them. Can anyone help me to figure out how to get more pairs to show up.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #716 ---
If you right click on anyone of the pairs in the upper left then you can choose "Show all" and the rest of the pairs will be available.  You can also right click any pair and choose to hide that pair.  Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #717 ---
For those of you who were short on Eur/Aud from last night, then you might like to close half your positions for a profit now, i.e. before market close, and move stop to break even.

--- 帖子 #718 ---
Just wondering if this is a nice tradeable one  or should be ignored. Or am too fast. Any suggestions is welcome.

--- 帖子 #719 ---
OHY yES. That would be a good short signal. Every elements of Ash system is correct. But I will wait for a move up to ca. 1,9850.

--- 帖子 #720 ---
For Sunday trade set ups. GBP/USD is a very good perfect Ashfx signal.

EUR/USD is a good SS signal. Also the AUD/JPY another good SS signal.

The cable is the best signal. Just my opinion. Paris

Kool. We get set to rock and roll then...See you guys on Sunday Night. Please go to church and pay your tithe all. The pips will roll on Monday.

Best of luck trading. (Does God approve of this on a SUNDAY???)

--- 帖子 #723 ---
Hey man take it easy. I just made a statement in a public forum. I did not put anybody's name on it. But Hope that helps your pips

--- 帖子 #724 ---
Well i don't think we should take this as a personal issue here. We have the right to believe whatever we choose as long as it works for us. We cannot see the force of gravity yet whether we believe it or not it works (for those on earth), same way too whether we see the sense in tithing or not, it works anyways (for those who work it).

This forum is not for religious issues, we are all here to make the pips...anyhow man just let's all keep it rolling.

--- 帖子 #725 ---
I see one valid signal to sunday GPB/USD (sell)

and another probable signal to  AUD/JPY (buy) but, need wait the AO has green .

--- 帖子 #726 ---
For the EUR/USD on FXDD the SAR is still under the bar.  Looks like a good short otherwise but the dot hasn't gone to the top yet.  Are you using FXDD?

--- 帖子 #727 ---
I believe the PDF said you could take the buy on the AUD/JPY even if the AO isn't green saying it usually turns in the next bar or two.

--- 帖子 #728 ---
Yes, the EUR/USD is considered a SS signal. Everything is lined up except for the SAR which i believe makes it acceptable as an SS trade. Maybe Ash can comment on this. I believe in the PDF it's not mandatory that the Psar is  in alignment as long as everything else is. That's the way I understand it. Paris

--- 帖子 #729 ---
Then i suppose that for Cable, Open Price 1.9826, TP 31 pips @ low 4/7/08 candle = 1.9795 , SL 21 pips @ high candle = 1.9847.

--- 帖子 #730 ---
That way I undertood the pdf is the PSAR must comply. I think the PSAR is the main trigger.

--- 帖子 #731 ---
Hi

So am I right in thinking G/U stochs have crossed 50 so

not the perfect AshFX setup but an ss trade

--- 帖子 #732 ---
If that's the case then we would never be in the AUD/USD short. But many people here and possibly Ash included have traded the Aud/Usd and it's been discussed in this thread just recently. Paris

--- 帖子 #733 ---
AUDUSD was taken according to the signal at IBFX (see chart in Post 604) and Ash said in post 589 that he was taking it but that it was NOT an official trade. So indeed we would never be in it, if following the rules strictly and using FXDD as charting platform.

--- 帖子 #734 ---
O.k. Thanks for clarifying that. For now on the PSAR must change and that'll be the first thing i look for before considering the signal. Thank you, Paris

--- 帖子 #735 ---
Paris I found the post that Ash made regarding the PSAR (This was post 147):

What this means is, it doesn't matter which order the AO or AC or Stochs line up... So either AO can come before AC, or vice versa, or AC can come before Stochs or vice versa, or AO can come before Stochs or vice versa. It doesn't matter. But as long as they all line up when the PSAR appears it's cool. I.e. they don't all have to change on the same candle.

What DOES matter is that we only take trades upon the close of the first PSAR dot.

Hope this clarifies things, and apologies for the ambuigity.

--- 帖子 #736 ---
Ash. Great method.GBP/U candle is in tight range. Would it be better to use previous candle for stop loss  and target range i.e. 1.9936.Also just a comment,this is one of the cleanest threads around.If it is kept only for trading all will benefit . Kind regards to all.

Hello I notice that you have 2 systems that appear very similar what are the subtle differences between the two ... I think I have become involved with the 2 systems and am / have become a little confused. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #740 ---
Hi,

The two systems are completely different. There are no subtle differences.

Just a couple of examples of CLEAR differences between the systems: AshFX is exclusively for the Daily Timeframe, Pip Nailer can be used on any time frame. AshFX utilises Stochastics, Pip Nailer does not.

If you read the manuals of each system again you will realise the dozens of differences between them.

Thanks.

Guys let's keep this thread clean. I'd rather not have any discussion about religion on this thread. People have the right to believe what they want.

Hi Ash

With the GBP/USD  as we wait for the open would you consider

a Fib from 13/6 low to 1/7 high to keep an eye on price

Thanks

--- 帖子 #743 ---
Guys, upon market opening, I shall be shorting GBP/USD.

SL is at swing high, i.e. 2.0005

Even though our 1st TP is just 25 pips, our 2nd TP will hopefully give us more pips once AO closes as green in a few days time.

--- 帖子 #744 ---
Hi Ash,

Are you still in the Aud/USD trade as the AO has closed green because i am still in as the trend line has not been broken yet and i think it is best to see how it goes in ther next few days before i pull out

Thanks

Paul

--- 帖子 #745 ---
I'm personally still in, but remember this AUD/USD sell wasn't an official AshFX signal, I ws just doing it primarily for test purposes with the IBFX platform, using much smaller lots.

--- 帖子 #746 ---
Ash..sorry just confirming..is 1st TP 25 pips or 31 pips?...

--- 帖子 #747 ---
In addition to this, the Second Strength (SS) refers to the Stochs.  If long and they are above 50 but still below 80 and with short then below 50 but still above 20.

--- 帖子 #748 ---
25.

How did you manage to get 31?

OK Ash,

Thanks for that and will be in with you on the GB/USD short

25.

How did you manage to get 31?

Last Close = 1.9826, Low = 1.9795  = 31 pips....

--- 帖子 #751 ---
You should deduct the close from high of the bar or swing high, in this case it is from high of the bar:

1.9846-1.9821=25 pips

Stop loss at SWING high? I thought it was candle high of 9846, minus low of 9821 for a stop and TP of 25 on the first lot?

--- 帖子 #753 ---
It's all explained in the pdf document.

--- 帖子 #754 ---
Due to the holiday in the US on friday, there was hardly any movement.

--- 帖子 #755 ---
This is a SS Short, since the Stoch has gone past the 50 line.

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Didn't notice that, Ash. Of course, I should have. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #757 ---
I see another signal to NZDUSD only not confirmed by stoch, anyone see same signal in yours brokers?

--- 帖子 #758 ---
Don't think so. The candle is not red.

--- 帖子 #759 ---
You are confused with Long Position. SL for Long  SL = Candel's close - candel´s low

By the way, does anyone here knnow how to attached template file :

AshFX_Daily.tpl and apply it on Metatrader?

I am talking about the tpl file on the first page of this tread:

Do we move stop loss to BE now that we reached take profit on our first position with GBP/USD? Paris

--- 帖子 #766 ---
I am upload my template file already.

Look at the chart now, on EURUSD: everything looks like a sell signal, except for the cross of Stoch is above 50 (good too), however it's crossing position is at least 5 days ago. Does it matter? Does it still counted a sell signal?

--- 帖子 #767 ---
Hi Ash:

Closed out 1st lot at +25 pips.  Should I move s/l on second lot to B/E. Thanks for all your time and an awesome system.

Hi, I am looking at this pair GBPUSD, too. And, from I learned here is that today at the market opening is the right day to open sell position, not yesterday (is the first PSAR dot above). If you read page#6 Msg#83: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...t=91789&page=6

And also, EURUSD is good to sell at tomorrow's market start.

(at least, so far, it looks like that way: the first PSAR dot is above today's bar.)

Am I right? Correct me if not, thanks.

Ok, obviously we hit our first TP of 25 pips very easily, and stop was moved to BE.

Our second lot stands at around 145 pips.

Now, the question is, do we

a) move SL further down to protect our profits?

b) close our position now?

c) just let the system do it's thing with AO?

I know many of you must be thinking it's a good time to close now, or good time to move stop further down, because I know people use my system for entries, yet prefer their own exits, and that's totally fine, it's your trade, and your right to do what you like.

However, for those of you who wanna follow AshFX Daily to the letter, then officially we wait till the AO closes as green.

Yes, it could be that this retraces back up horriby, and we just close for 25 pips profit, but that's the nature of trading.

Well I have now closed my position,gbp/usd  mainly because we have had some heavy retracing on some of our other trades. and I just wanted to lock in some good pips!

Maybe we should trade 3 lots close our first at our T/P point the second lot close if you see some fast retrace,(only good for people that can watch the trade) the third let it run,untill the AO closes green, and if goes aganst us and hits break even........... hey ho!

--- 帖子 #785 ---
Any more retracement to the 50 fib level and I might consider exiting. I was hoping this might drop to 61.8.

Anyway, we'll see.

--- 帖子 #786 ---
Hi Ash,

Got out of GB/US at 1.9686 but read your e mail after i done it and should have stuck with the fib lines but he ho, still learning and enjoying it, fib lines are on my charts now

Thats one six pack to you, i will total it up and meet you to give you your just deserves, thanks a million great system

Also have you checked out the AUD/USD trade we are still in, looks like our patience paid off and it is coming down to what we opened at and could be (but wont be) a short trade on the charts from tommorrow

Thanks

On the Sell signal you got for GBP/USD I got that earlier than you did, also the Sto numbers looked different, it is obviously due to whom you take your data from as they will not all be the same.

Good luck

Anyone can confirm these signals ?

--- 帖子 #791 ---
Hi Ash & everyone:

I'm new to this strategy, new to FXDD, and fairly new to MT4.  I can only trade micros so taking a half lot isn't practical.  I set a too-tight trailing stop on yesterday's suggested enty and got stopped out with a 5 pip profit.  Trading micros it wasn't enough for a cup of coffee but it was profit and I'll get there.

Question: what should a trailing stop have been?  The max?  Will have to trade this way until fall.  Thanks Ash and all, p.

Using fibo retracements

--- 帖子 #809 ---
Well, I have finished writing my EA this past weekend and have been making little tweaks and fixes here and there.  Naturally through the course of testing the EA has been reloaded several time and for the AUD/JPY has bought lower each time I reset after a change.  It's a valid signal but it brings up questions.

Let me first explain the way the EA works...

Settings

Order01LotSize: 0.1 (Size of first trade and has a TP determined by the EA)
Order02LotSize: 0.1 (Size of second trade and has no TP set when placed)Second trade is close by the EA when conditions according to the AshFX system are met.
MaxDiffFromOpen: 10 (Number of pips difference from open price)If buy then price can't be greater than open +10 pipsAnything less is fair to open
If sell then price can't be less than open -10 pipsAnything greater is fair to open
TakeSSTrades: true (allow second strength trades to be opened)

OrderSlippage: 3 (number of pips the price can differ when placing a trade)

EAMagicNumber: 20080706 (day I wrote the EA and used by EA to determine if a trade belongs to the EA)This number can be used on all currencies the EA is attached to but can't be duplicated on the same currency if 2 charts are open for the same currency pair.
Now for the questions...

1) If you buy lower than the open or sell greater than the open should the TP still be determined by the price you bought or sold at?  In other words, If I was supposed to buy at 100.25 with a TP at 100.50 but I actually bought at 100.15 then should my TP still be 100.50 or should it be 100.40.The system bases it's decision upon the close of the last bar/open of the current bar so I'm inclined to set SL and TP based on the numbers they're supposed to be.  If you should happen to get in at a lower price then your TP would be larger and the SL smaller for a long position.  The 'MaxDiffFromOpen' variable was put into place to give you the power to say how far off the price could move and still place a trade.  This way if you started the EA at an off time for whatever reason you wouldn't accidentally place trades on a bar that had all the right signals but had already ran a great deal up into the possible profit.
2) On the attached chart I have added a custom indicator I had from a while back (Support and Resistance (Barry)).  Has anyone used this indicator or feel that it is showing valuable/accurate information?  I need something that can be looked at by the EA without my manual intervention that could determine support/resistance.  This may also be useful for possibly taking a trade but with a lower TP if support/resistance is slightly against your full TP determined by the system.  Maybe a new setting for the EA not to trade for less than X pips to prevent very small trades.

I have also attached a EUR/AUD image showing the S/R.  If I had utilized the indicator then I might have set a lower TP and been out already.  At one point I had roughly 80+ pips and is now riding around -119 pips.  The TP is set for 1.6163 (187 pips) but I might have taken 80+ knowing the S/R levels before placing the trade.

As a side note on the EUR/AUD...  According to the AshFX system all the signals were in line for this trade and the SL is still a ways off.  This could very well still be a good trade or it could have been one of those trades people avoided due to the Support level not allowing for the full TP.  Again this is where validating the Support and Resistance of the indicator shown would be helpful.  Does it look accurate?

--- 帖子 #810 ---
Actually, as I think about it, it's probably better if you can buy lower or sell high to have a TP based on the price you actually bought or sold at.  This way you might have a better chance with the second trade riding the wave since the update to break even would be lower for a long and higher for a short.  This is not to say that I would intentionally try to get in lower or higher but if that happens to be the case then so be it.  I will keep the TP based on where I actually bought or sold.

Example (make believe trade below):

The AshFX system determines a 50 pip TP based on the signals/bar values.

It also suggests you buy at say 100.25 (100.75 would be TP)

However, due to conditions (maybe between close on Friday and open on Sunday or something else) you actually buy at 100.15.  In this case the EA would set the TP to 100.65 (still 50 pips) also making the update to break even on the 2nd position lower (100.15 rather than 100.25).

Thoughts?

--- 帖子 #811 ---
Still few hours before the close of the candles..

Looking @..

EURUSD - Short if Candle Goes RED - Take Care Oversold Closing in..
USDJPY - Long - Take Care OverBought Area Closing in..
AUDUSD - Short
CADUSD - Long

That is my 2 pips only.. Please confirm before taking trade.. Wait for candles to close.

Hi

I may be overlooking something or just not understanding the above text but as a newbie to Metatrader, I am unable to get some of the currency pairs being referred to on some posts.

I have tried right clicking on the any of the pairs on the upper left as in the above text but all this does for me is open up the chart for that currency pair.  I do not see any "show all" option.

Also, as a newbie, I think it only polite.  I have been scalping the FTSE and currencies for a while now and am tired of sitting at my computer waiting for a few pips here and there.  Very time consuming and reward not so great and human element can lead to more mistakes when trading so much.

Ash, I have tried you system out paper trading and it has delivered 90% of the time and I can have a life while earning money.  Thank you.

Also, thanks to all the other contributers on this thread.  Absolutely fantastic community which I am glad to be joining.

--- 帖子 #819 ---
You need to have "Market Watch" open on MT4. Then you right click on the upper left corner, which reads "Symbol" (Of the market Watch window") and you will have the option of "Show All". Hope that helps!

--- 帖子 #820 ---
ASH,

sorry, update on cad/jpy with pic below

--- 帖子 #821 ---
Are you right mouse clicking in the Market Watch(open with Ctrl+M) window?

--- 帖子 #822 ---
Hi Folks:

As of right now I see 3 potential trades if no change of signals.

AUD/USD

CAD/JPY

USD/JPY

Any thoughts from anyone else, especially Ashl?

--- 帖子 #823 ---
Firstly, thank you very much.  Even though personally I don't like to use EA's, I really appreciate your efforts, I'm sure others would like to test it.

Secondly, concerning the question you raised, then to be honest I haven't officially addressed that for AshFX Daily. The system just presumes that the opening price of the candle will always be equal to the close of the previous bar.  As to what one should do - this is something discretionary and up to the trader.

The way you have described it in the imaginary example above would be fine.

--- 帖子 #824 ---
Thank you for the response and the system.  I am hesitant to post the EA just yet since I wrote it just this past weekend.  Once I see it work like it's supposed to then I will absolutely release it to whoever would like to try it.

--- 帖子 #825 ---
No probs. Just bear in mind the results will not always be as amazing as they have been so far. There will be tough times. By it's very definition, Forex is tough.

Welcome on board dude.

--- 帖子 #826 ---
Ok guys, tonight's update for potential entries.

Looking at EUR/JPY, it seems to be ranging too much for my liking, and so I will not be entering that.

AUD/USD - Although I am already in this (due to me testing an IBFX signal), now's a good time to enter into it if you haven't already done so. Stochs are pointing down and are just about crossing. I personally am not re-entering.

USD/JPY & CAD/JPY.  These are both SS Longs, and I will be buying these in around 10 minutes time. Stop Losses are at their respective swing low's.

I hope everyone is familiar with the rules by now. If you're new to this thread/system, please read the PDF manual on the first post, and don't hesistate to ask any questions if you're still not sure.

--- 帖子 #827 ---
I trade

CADJPY LONG

EURCHF LONG

Possible USDJPY could be trade, but stoch is too high. Especially red line of stoch in USDJPY is too high.

--- 帖子 #828 ---
As with all other systems, i'd assume fundamentals or sudden news events or news or announcements can go against this strategy right? Or since we're trading based on dailys, it would warn us before it goes bonkers?

I have read the document for your daily signal ...and have everything set up like it says... the only thing I still am unsure about is the only settings not in the document are the ones for the parabolic sar colour alert which I have

as follows

ALERTS ENABLED : TRUE

STEP :  0.02

MAXIMUM :0.2

PRECISION :7

Maybe its this thats getting me the wrong info .......... THANKS

--- 帖子 #852 ---
Sould be 0.03, 0.20. Use the tpl file in the first post.

In fact the first post mentions the settings. not sure what the precision parameter does though

--- 帖子 #853 ---
No, the step should be 0.03. Maximum is fine at 0.2, but I'm not sure what you mean by "precision". I do not see that on my platform.

--- 帖子 #854 ---
cheers for that ... the indicator was one that I downloaded from here somewhere... it was posted on one of the threads......... Will see if I can find a version that does not have that on it ..

Thanks for the help

--- 帖子 #855 ---
When I double click on the MQ to add to the tpl file there you can change parameters .... the precision is one of the parameters you can change.... thefile was download from this page ... and was added to here at 8.28 today with a file called ashloadedfx daily.tpl

First of all, thank you for your sharing.

I checked it (AUD/USD) on the chart, it is a good signal to me.

Can you tell us:

1. How do you decide your TP?

2. Why is that the CAD/JPY pair has SL: 103.11, my is 104.60 (previous day low)?

--- 帖子 #857 ---
This is a Second Strength trade. The Stochs were above 50.

--- 帖子 #858 ---
Dont see it as fitting the rules ......... obvioulsly differences in data ?

--- 帖子 #859 ---
Does anyone think that USD/JPY is a good BUY signal for today's market?

--- 帖子 #860 ---
if you look back thru a few months it looks like anytime the stoch gets that high,it means prices will fall for at least a few days.

As i see it anyway. ( i do need new glasses though)

my 2 pips worth

dave

--- 帖子 #861 ---
The TP is outlined in the PDF.  If long then Close - Low of signal bar and if Short then High - Close.

CAD/JPY is 103.11 (swing low) because it's a second strength trade.  The Stoch was over 50 and below 80.  If it were below the 50 then the SL would have been the Low of the bar that signaled the trade (104.60).  You have the wrong SL set.

--- 帖子 #862 ---
It's a good buy for long term.IMHO...got it locked since may..

--- 帖子 #863 ---
You're not using the FXDD Demo, you're using ODL.  That's why your data feed is different.  Thats one problem.  You're also not using the standard PSAR indicator that comes with MetaTrader.  This is also a problem.  Check out the PSAR in Ash screenshots, then look at yours.

So, get FXDD, install it, and load the template from page 1 of this thread.  Don't do anything other than that.

If you're using FXDD with the standard indicators that come with it then you will get exactly the same charts and signals as Ash.  This is because you will be getting the same data feed (FXDD) as he is with the same indicators(STANDARD) as he is.

Hope this helps.

Here is the EA for anyone who would like to test it.  Remember I only wrote it this past weekend and may not have all the bugs worked out.  It's also programmed to only run on demo accounts for right now and I would strongly suggest using FXDD since other brokers vary so much.

mtaboneweb....

Thanks for the EA....testing it now on my FXDD demo.

I have never been a big fan of EA's but I think they have a better chance for success with a cut-and-dry system such as ASH FX's.

Looking forward to testing this out and thanks again for your efforts.

Anyone else ever make the mistake of accidentally submitting a market order for 5 lots when you intended '0.5' ? I just did and please excuse me while I sweat bullets!

This is the thing I'd like to know:

The cross we should look at, is it the one few days past, or is it the one happening ?

Has anyone else noticed a long signal on the USD/CHF for IBFX, just curious. Stochastics are approaching the 80 mark but it has not hit it yet.

--- 帖子 #871 ---
Ronald,

I know this statement is from long time ago, but I had to go through each posting of this thread. I found out something needs to correct here:

SELL:AC Red AO Red PSAR Below Price --------> PSAR Above Price Did you put it in your EA already?

--- 帖子 #872 ---
Hi,

Thanks for the hard work you are putting in on this, i am sure we will all benefit but i seem to have a problem with downloading the EA

It is in a EX4 code and i usually have success when i download a MQ4 EA, when i trid to save this it just comes up with EX4 when i open metaeditor and nothing happens when i try to load on to my charts, ANY HELP

Thanks

Paul

--- 帖子 #873 ---
Again we have someone complementing the efforts of Ron. My thumbs up for you guys

hi

thnaks for your ea .

did you backtest it with a special pair  ?? and what results have you got ?

thanks for sharing it

imad

--- 帖子 #875 ---
It sort of does and confirms what I suspected. Only problem is that I dont really want to change accounts etc.....

This fundementally appears to be a really really good system ......... I will have to see if I can tweak the system to fit my data ... etc............. thank you

--- 帖子 #876 ---
It leapt in to action for a short cable. Full details in my signature. Currently open for 24 pips.

--- 帖子 #877 ---
EX4 is the compiled code. You won't be able to read it in Metaeditor.

You just have to copy the file to the "experts" folder (or "experts>indicators" if it is an indicator instead of an EA), close and restart MT4, and you will be then able to find the EA in the Navigator window under "Expert Advisors".

ljr,

Which pair you are talking about here?

The USDJPY cross (days ago) is at 20.

trader8686

--- 帖子 #880 ---
Sorry I was talking about CADJPY

--- 帖子 #881 ---
lrj,

I don't see AUDUSD or CADJPY or USDJPY as secondary signal.

Which pair was the secondary signal entry?

--- 帖子 #882 ---
mtaboneweb,

Thanks, first of all.

=============

My testing report

=============

I will need to give you my feed back for testing this EA:

Everytime, I close FXDD trading station and open it again, this EA will open another 2 new trades (on the same pair: CADJPY for me.

This is demo account otherwise it would have been overloaded.

You may need to do some checking to make sure if one pair has been opened, then don't need to open it, again.

Now, the EA has just closed out all trades by itself, at 104.60 (CADJPY), not 103.11.

--- 帖子 #883 ---
hi, the EA opened 4 orders on AUDUSD pair at same time, please checking, thanks!

--- 帖子 #884 ---
Hi All,

New to this forum/thread and new to Forex. Just wanted to say hello and looking forward to participating in the group.

Started looking at Ash's system at the back end of last week and demo traded the cable trade yesterday (out for a total of 167 pips using a fib level to exit the second part of the trade) and am currently in AUD/USD, CAD/JPY and EUR/USD. All but CAD/JPY showing good profits so I am excited by the method.

I have read through the thread and wondered if anybody had done any backtesting that they would like to share. I intend to do some myself and will post the results but if anyone else has done any it would be useful to know the outcome.

Good luck to all.

James

--- 帖子 #885 ---
Mr. forexmoments,

I have been reading your thread since the first page.

I have a very basic question here, and I believe that other people may want to hear this clear, too.

In your AshFX_Daily.pdf file:

When you said, "Sell: When you see the first PSAR dot above the candle, AND the AO is red, AND the AC is red, AND Stochs are crossing down but are not below the 50 line"

Is it only the main line (blue line) not to go below the 50 line? OR

Is it for main line (blue line)and signal line (red dot line) to both not to go below the 50 line?

trader8686
---------------------------
Just like to learn it better!

--- 帖子 #886 ---
For 'short' trade, both lines should be abv 50.

It would be second strength trade if one/both lines r below 50 but abv 20.

--- 帖子 #887 ---
I don't put any faith in backtesting even if 90% modeling quality.  I was recently backtesting another EA which is the first I had done in a long time and thought I would try it again.  What I found was that the strategy tester has some huge flaws.  I would run thru the visual mode as slow as I could handle watching and found that stop losses and take profits weren't always honored.  If the price went 1 pip past but didn't actually land on the TP or SL then it was ignored.  This is a big problem and something that can throw a big monkey wrench into your testing.  At least with live trading you would hope the broker honors your TPs and SLs and closes them when they should even if the price doesn't land directly on your target.  To each his/her own.  I just don't believe backtesting is accurate enough to put any stock into it.

--- 帖子 #888 ---
Thanks for that catch. I went over the code again and it's all correct. No updates needed.

--- 帖子 #889 ---
The EA does more than just open trades.  You have to leave it open or it won't work right.  The EA manages the trades once they are placed.

1) Update to break even on second position once TP of first is hit.

2) Close 2nd trade once AO changes color.

No EA can do this if it's not running any more than a computer can do a virus scan if it's powered off.

The EA sets a boolean (True/False) variable to true once the trades are placed and looks to make sure it doesn't duplicate trades on the same day.  If you close the EA then all variables would revert back to their default values and the EA thinks it needs to do something.  I can write extra code to check for live trades first but this shouldn't happen if you leave it running.  Besides, once it passes the initial trigger date then it wouldn't see a trade anymore but it still needs to be running.

The idea of running an Expert adviser is that it handles the trades so you don't have to but you need to let it do it's job.

I'm perhaps stressing this more than need be but so many people still don't understand how an EA really works and they really need to if they intend to use them.  Please don't take it the wrong way.

--- 帖子 #890 ---
My EA Shorted on the cable yesterday?  Your statement shows a completed trade on the cable but not 2 like my EA would have placed.  Besides that it shouldn't have traded that since the signal bar was 2 days ago.  If it truly did this then it was in error and didn't do that on my demo.  Are you running FXDD because that could have given a signal on another broker.

--- 帖子 #891 ---
Thanks a lot, Ron.

Did you happened to have setting manuel some where?

I need to parameters for :

MagicNumber

SignalMail

EachTickMod

etc

Thanks again!

--- 帖子 #892 ---
Hey guys,

Nice signals today, thanks alot! I think they all turned a profit? Well mine did  I dont always stick to the take profit/stop loss rules as ive found taking some profit when i see it works best, or if its touching SL and long term still looks like it might go back up, i just leave it. Its worked for me very well so far. Too often the SL kicks in just before the price recovers to a much better exit point. Anyway, thanks for this ashfx and everyone else! Looking forward to the next signal.

--- 帖子 #893 ---
MagicNumber: The unique trade identification number for this EA. This allows the EA to figure out which trades it is supposed to manage.

SignalMail: If you set up metatrader for e-mail, it will send e-mails to you whenever a trade occurs.

EachTickMode: If set to true, the EA will look for a trade every tick, and place the trade as soon as the signal appears. If set to false, the EA will look for a trade ONLY AT THE CLOSE OF A BAR.

--- 帖子 #894 ---
You will notice a balance of $49,964.00.  This is because of trades I closed manually while making some changes yesterday before I posted the EA here.  I didn't reset the account because I would have lost the AUD/JPY trades from the day before and the EA wouldn't replace them because the signal had passed the day before.

I am not seeing double trades or any other problems right now like others but I have not shut down the EA/platform and am leaving it run like it should.  You will also notice the 2nd orders have the TP as their comment whereas the 1st order is Order1.  This is how the EA distinguishes the trades.  The 2nd order with no TP looks at it's comment to see it the SL should be moved to break even.

--- 帖子 #895 ---
im new tho this thread, i have a question... do the ash signals come to our email whenever there is one or it just gets posted in here?

--- 帖子 #896 ---
Am together with BoneWeb...

The best way to test an EA is Forward Testing.. Demo Account r free and what I would do myself Download an EA of interest... Get a Demo account from a broker that the EA / Strategy Developer recommends, Load the recommended TF and Pairs.. Let it RUN for like a month or 2.

I will tell you why backtesting might not work. Yesterdays Data is not Todays Data and Forex is 1 volatile and ever changing market. What would happen during Fundie???

Well lets put to task all the EA let them run and lets give our ever had working EA developers result, critism, congrats and everything they need to make the EA worth it.

Just my 2 pips

Do you guys think aud/usd has some more legs? It seems to have alot of support at 9520 level, or do you guys feel 9400 is on the cards? Thanks in advance,

--- 帖子 #898 ---
Hello mtaboneweb,

what if you insert an arrow shape and write some parameters on its description (this is not shown) that would tell the EA that this trade is already taken?

Cheers!

Rafa.

--- 帖子 #899 ---
Just to add on:

Metatrader's Backtesting system is incredibly inaccurate when predicting profitability. Instead, use it in visual mode to determine order entry

accuracy.

--- 帖子 #900 ---
Sometimes I have 1 sometimes 2. No idea why. In my signature statement below you obviously missed the statement at the top of the page and in the title that I am using an FXDD account.

The EA will be on all this week.

--- 帖子 #901 ---
Yeah.  I'm using Oanda live for placing the trades, but use the FXDD charts for this system.  Annoying, but hey, I'll try anything to get those pesky little pips.  You can also run several copies of MetaTrader at the same time too.  I've got ODL, Alpari,  and FXDD running on my main PC for charting various systems.  Then I have Oanda running on a laptop for placing trades.  Mainly got it set up this way just in case the power goes out.

current AshFX trades:

GBPUSD +136 pips (first lot closed, second lot open)

AUDUSD +30 pips (both lots open)

CADJPY -16 pips (both lots open)

USDJPY +28 pips (both lots open)

Perhaps, we could have a short on AUDUSD tomorrow? Would grateful if someone could confirm this.

I have missed long on $Yen and $Swiss because of my uncertainty of the OB line on stoch.

--- 帖子 #905 ---
I just check it on my FXDD MT4 Chart, I agree with you.

Anyone else?

--- 帖子 #906 ---
Sorry for spamming...but forget to put eurusd. Possible for short tomorrow?

--- 帖子 #907 ---
According to the AshFX system this would not be valid.  The first PSAR dot was above several bars ago and the bar was up rather than down.  These 2 items make this an invalid trade according to the rules.  As a side not it would have been a good short even though the signal bar was up.

--- 帖子 #908 ---
If you were using FXDD you would already be short on the AUD/USD.  Even the Interbank screen shot the PSAR happened several bars ago.

The AshFX system works when the dot first changes sides on that closed bar.  You would enter on the next bar if the conditions are in line.

--- 帖子 #909 ---
The AUDUSD was already AshFX FXDD ready a fair while ago.  Might be risky to take it now using these rules as the trade was supposed to be opened almost 20 hours ago now.

--- 帖子 #910 ---
Hi mtaboneweb,

I noticed that the Support and Resistance (Barry) is in line with the fractals. Knowing this may help you in coding. See the attached pic.

Thanks to you and RR for doing so much work to create the EA. Also thanks to Ash for sharing and assisting us in learning this strategy.

I'm looking forward to testing and being involved with the discussion.

pd

--- 帖子 #911 ---
mtaboneweb,

Did you say, since yesterday's bar was up and the first dot of PSAR is not on yesterday's bar, this is an invalid Sell signal?

mtaboneweb, can you please post your S/R Barry indicator here?
Thanks much!

--- 帖子 #912 ---
Thanks for checking.  Now I just need to figure out how it's useful.  S/R may change at any new bar but it doesn't appear to repaint.  It may also pass thru a S/R level and sometimes be restrained by it.  Even if the S/R is far off from where you start it could be constrained on a later bar if an adjustment happens.

Example: Going for long (50 pips?) and resistance is 150+pips above and has been for days.  No telling on the next bar/day or two the Resistance wont move down due to lower prices and maybe below your original TP.

Anyone have a suggestion on how to use it?

--- 帖子 #913 ---
For the EUR/USD, what I meant is that 2 bars ago was the signal bar and everything considered would have been a good second strength trade (stochs below 50 but still above 20).  What canceled it being a signal was that the bar was an up bar.  But it looks like it may have made some money on a short position.

--- 帖子 #914 ---
Right.

I just noticed that: The PSAR dot on today's bar is the 2nd dot, so we were supposed to open this Sell position yesterday's market opening.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #915 ---
Looks like the EUR/CHF would be a good second strength trade if the Stoch ends under 80.  Right now it's just peeping over the 80 mark which would prevent the EA from taking the trade just like the USD/JPY yesterday.  Other than that I didn't see any new signals for today.

It has also broken through the resistance.

Anyone else?

--- 帖子 #916 ---
I wonder why, if the entry has to be placed at the close of the daily candle, almost everybody is trying to "forecast" what will the signals be for tomorrow, several hours before the effective closing time. I find it can be confusing for newcomers to the thread.

Just remember that "Here I present to you my new System, AshFX Daily. It's excellent for traders who work a full-time job, and/or can't/don't want to spend hours and hours staring at the screen."

Should be one of the goals, IMHO.

--- 帖子 #917 ---
Is there an EA for this system????

--- 帖子 #918 ---
It's really just to alert people to a possible setup and what they should look for and which pairs.  It's meant to be helpful rather than harmful.  If you feel we shouldn't do it then personally I'll stop but speaking for myself, I'm just trying to help.

--- 帖子 #919 ---
Why the differences of charts are so big?.. On ibfx the doji bar was a bull candle but on fxdd the doji bar was a bear candle. I'm using ibfx and would say that i've missed a lot of opportunity. Would it be wise to use fxdd charts but put order on ibfx?

--- 帖子 #920 ---
If that's the way you want to handle it then yes but I would use FXDD for your signals.  IBFX has a Sunday bar and this is why things are so different from FXDD.

--- 帖子 #921 ---
Still, the AshFx system should come up with good setups on any broker, just a little different maybe?

Cheers.

Rafa.

--- 帖子 #922 ---
This could be true but the thread is based on using certain settings (PSAR, 0.03, 0.02 and FXDD) which would most likely need to be different for IBFX because of the extra Sunday bars (which is also not a full day's data).  The extra bars are 100% guaranteed to give different signals and maybe never a match to FXDD at the same time anyways.

That being said, We may find that IBFX gives good signals because of the extra bars but I will personally stay with FXDD for now since that's what the system is based on using.

--- 帖子 #923 ---
Just a good reminder(read Page 54)

Stoch is almost above 80, this indicating a big retracement is on its way.

Why don't you set a lower entry price for a pending order to be a better trade?

Any other openion?

--- 帖子 #924 ---
Have you  read any of the thread?

--- 帖子 #925 ---
Order of the day:

Ok the reason people mention what pair they might be trading is a way of giving other traders Trade Signal. In short if I say now:

I might be going Long on EURCHF it is a watchout call for that pair don't trade it until the bar closes and yes THE RULES ARE MET. Sometimes it is impossible for us to watch all pairs so we try to help each other. Sometime a late signal cannot be a signal TRUE? so see ATTACHED on the EURCHF maybe also check it and wait see where the bar closes watch out the OB Area on the Stochs.

About other brokers.. ASHFX has it rules lets stick to them and avoid confusing newcomers. So FXDD for ASHFX only. If someone can comeup with a setup for other brokers well and good we have alot of traders that would appreciate.

Good Trades to ALL

BEFORE I GO : THE RULES PLEASE - FOLLOW THEM....

Regards

SmartKenya

--- 帖子 #926 ---
No problem.

Just to be clear so you don't open on the wrong candle in any future trades.  The AUDUSD trade should have been opened on the 8th of July at 00:00 as reported by FXDD in the Market Watch window.  i.e. the open of the July 8 candle.

--- 帖子 #927 ---
Hello, sorry to bother you guys with this. I can't load "AskFX Entry Only.mq4" and "AskFX.mq4" scripts, neither as EAs or indicators. The journal gives me the messages "loaded successfully" and "removed" immediately.

Any clues?

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #928 ---
They're not scripts. They're expert advisors.

Ash, would you be possible setting this system for the use of any broker? not only stick to fxdd ... yours are good & interesting...but it would good if other trader using other broker beside fxdd could benefit from it...

--- 帖子 #932 ---
Have you enabled EAs under the Options screen?

--- 帖子 #933 ---
Hi,

Maybe it's a stupid question but I need help.

How to setup ASHFX in my IBFX MT4? Is it just copy and paste in the expert advisor folder or something more?

I am also using AutoPilot. Anyone have any experience with that?

--- 帖子 #934 ---
Thank you Mathew, the problem was I didn't save it right on the experts folder.

Cheers!

Rafa.

--- 帖子 #935 ---
Exactly, and to be quite frank, as of right now, I don't really have the time nor the inclination to start testing this system on another broker.

Guys, you do not need to open a live account with FXDD.  You just need to open a DEMO account with them.  (Yes, it's free).

Then all you do is enter the trade on any of your live accounts.

--- 帖子 #936 ---
Ash, is EUR/CHF a valid signal for today? It looks like it's going into the overbought area. What do you think? Paris

Ash, I am waiting for tonight's update for potential entries!

--- 帖子 #938 ---
Hi everyone:            Does everyone agree USD/CHF getting ready to go long if the signal stays, I'm using FXDD?Jim

--- 帖子 #939 ---
No, the stochs with Swissie are in overbought and should invalidate the signal. Paris

--- 帖子 #940 ---
Thanks for the quick reply. The signal line is at 70.6382, does this make this signal still qualify, Ash?Jim

--- 帖子 #941 ---
My opinion: It is not a valid AshFx_Daily signal. As Paris said it's going into the overbought area. Personally I wont trade this pair.

--- 帖子 #942 ---
I had signal on EURCHF yesterday, but on North Finance broker. I don't- know why...

--- 帖子 #943 ---
From I distance I stand and watch, let the profits go, let the loses go..

I believe that Signal wouldn't suffice as a trade to me too risky.

Just took a on SHORT CHFJPY

Regards

SmartKenya

--- 帖子 #944 ---
I see the two eventual LONG signals on Swissy (EUR/CHF and USD/CHF) are both on overbought area (above 80) so I wouldn't take any of those either.

There is a SHORT signal on CHF/JPY that "could" be a second strength trade (stochs are below 50). However as it involves the same currency as the other two above, I think I'll stay out as well.

--- 帖子 #945 ---
The EA placed no new trades today...

CHF/JPY (Short) - AC not red

EUR/CHF (Long) - Stoch too high (over 80)

USD/CHF (Long) - Stoch too high (over 80)

--- 帖子 #946 ---
AC is red on my FXDD chart for CHF/JPY.

http://i47.photobucket.com/albums/f2...e/chfjpy-1.gif

--- 帖子 #947 ---
AC is not green although it is red on the new bar unless price moves up a bit.  Anyway you look at the signal bar it's not 100%.  According to AshFX system the AC must be red for short (the AO can be green which should change).

--- 帖子 #948 ---
Take a 2nd look at your chart.  The first PSAR above, the AC is green on that bar (the signal bar).  It's not valid.

--- 帖子 #949 ---
I see short signal on GOLD  It could be good trade for 250-350 pips, becouse generaly trend is LONG.

--- 帖子 #950 ---
Also, both of these are invalid because Stoch is over 80.

"Support and Resistance (Barry)"

Side note: EUR/CHF has broken the resistance and USD/CHF has plenty of room.  Of course resistance could be lowered in a day or two based on the fact it's been high for a while.

--- 帖子 #951 ---
Woooooow! How about this!

Can we tread Gold using this AshFX system?

--- 帖子 #952 ---
You are absolutely right.

I guess I'm going daltonic, as I was convinced that both were red even after posting and seeing the chart several times.

:oops: Sorry for the mistake.

Sorry for the late response guys.

You better not to short it, read the above messages.

It was an invalid signal bar, AC was green, yesterday.

--- 帖子 #957 ---
Here is the indicator, SmartKenya.

--- 帖子 #958 ---
Tell you what guys, this DOES look like a good short.

Yes, this is a valid SS Sell for Gold!

--- 帖子 #959 ---
Thanks for reply Ash. Was USD/CHF invalid because one of the stoch was over 80? Do they both have to be under 80? I believed that as long as the signal line was under 80 it was valid.  Thanks for all you do.Jim

--- 帖子 #960 ---
The bars play tricks with everyone's eyes and everyone wants to see a good trade setup so we're all anxious for that.  That's why I like EAs to an extent because once programmed right they make the decision you told it to make.  I have looked at my charts several times saying there must be a trade and something didn't work...  Can't there please be a trade...  Bottom line is the EA is a robot and doesn't get excited.  It just trades like you say.

One downside is I may have taken certain trades out of excitement like the USD/JPY a day or two ago.  Other people seemed to jump on it even though the Stoch was over 80.  It makes a person wonder about loosening the decision (maybe not over 82.59634???, kidding) but the truth is that it's not the rules of the system.  Those rules may vary over time and through trading but for now I stick to the system rules.

That's why I wont manually take the CHF/JPY, EUR/CHF, or the USD/JPY today.  I may regret that decision in a couple of days but I'd rather wait for the right signal which is still not a guaranteed win either.

Who knows?

Noticed that AUD/USD closed first position and didn't update the 2nd to break even.  I have corrected the problem and also added support to check for opne trades first before placing new ones.  This way when you shut down MT4 and reopen after copying the new EA it will not replace new trades.

It is still important to leave MT4, the charts, and the attached EA running 24/7 because it does the trading for you.  It requires the software to be running for this to happen.

Should be safe for anyone running the old EA to replace with new one.

1) Close MT4

2) Copy new EA to Expert directory

3) Open MT4

Comment on chart should read "AshFX AutoTrader v1.0c"

Great info on your open positions..... just curious about why you post your PC specs.... like we would give a hoot about it or maybe it makes you feel more powerful or something...weird.... Dude? does all that processor and ram figure in to better trade decisions and managemnet somehow??

--- 帖子 #979 ---
mataboneweb, thanks for your ea too.

What's the difference between your's and ronald rayguns?

Thanks,

Hey guys lets do some party today. Will try to scalp few pairs and afterwards head to Mcdonald. I need to show them some GU pips. Maybe as u guys think I will try and add gold, oil, silver, medallion,diamond, bronze,etc to my Ash pairs to trade. My broker has more than 500 tradable instruments including Iranian dollar. I dont know where he got them. Will look at them for sure.

For now guys no daily trades. Get some beer today

--- 帖子 #981 ---
Thanks......

...but I'll be ignoring this.  It's a sig dude, not a post.

--- 帖子 #982 ---
Hey Mate

Looks like I cant use your EA.  After installing it I get this statement on my chart....This version can only work with Demos and specified accounts. How is that? I mean what does it mean?

Thanks for your efforts, though.

--- 帖子 #983 ---
I gave two hoots, but that's just me.

You cannot use the EA on a live account

Wooah, that was one perfect setup on AshFX Daily for Oil!

Yeah, Yen. Good to see you again on FF. As always, your posts are a HOOT!

--- 帖子 #993 ---
It shouldn't. All of my EAs will work on live and demo accounts. It's possible that the broker you're using doesn't allow EAs.

And just so I can say "Mine is better"

I don't have Oil on FXDD to see the setup.  At least, I don't see the symbol.  Do I need to use a different server, or do all of FXDD's servers carry the same instruments?

What's the per-pip value on spot gold on a full contract?  I don't have XAU/USD on my demo, and I'd rather not 'find out' using my live account.

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #995 ---
If its Metatrader too, right click on market watch tab and click show all. Alternatively you can click symbols and choose the ones you want to display. I only found this out a few months back, didnt really bother me cos it showed all the main pairs. But with ODL I now see gold, oil and a few other commodities too. I can even see the stock market indices and shares, though i cant trade them with my account.

--- 帖子 #996 ---
It means the EA has determined your trying to run it on a live account.  I don't believe at this point the EA is ready for a live account.  When all have agreed it's ready then I'll be more than happy to release a version that works on live accounts.

I don't wish to be responsible for erroneous code costing someone real money and people should be shy to use it live just yet anyways.

--- 帖子 #997 ---
It should show v1.0c.  Could you try it again?

Don't close any charts.  Just the platform (MT4).  Overwrite the old EA with the new and reopen MT4.

--- 帖子 #998 ---
Not yet...  I will post one when we feel the EA is bug free.  There's not much to this EA but I would rather people don't use it on a real account for now.

--- 帖子 #999 ---
Let me clear things up.

I specifically programmed the EA so it will not work on live accounts.  It's being tested right now and it has nothing to do with your broker.  When it looks good then I will release a live/demo version.  A perfect example is the recent update I just posted.  I reposted the EA due to a bug I found.  It was not updating to break even (noticed on AUD/USD).  It's a good thing it wasn't live since I noticed the AUD/USD got stopped out a break even today after I updated the EA.  While I tested the changes I also manually changed the SL on the 2nd AUD/USD like it should have been if things were working right.  Once the change was made I reset the SL back and watched for the conditions to be met again and made sure the EA did what it's supposed to do.

Now where would a live account be if the EA hadn't updated the trade to break even like it should have.  You may have been in a live trade now with negative pips when it should have stopped at 0 because the first order took its profit.  And if that were the case the posts from everyone would be on a more angry note because real money is at stake.

Does anyone really think this is a bad approach, to test and get it bug free before throwing it blindly onto a live account with real money?  I believe it should be done that way.

--- 帖子 #1000 ---
Can anyone else confirm this?  I will repost the EA if others are having the same issue.

--- 帖子 #1001 ---
I am showing the same error:

I had v1.0b version showing on all my charts, therefore I redownloaded your newer ex4 file again. Replaced on my older ex4 file, copied it to my expert advisor folder, removed older ex4 file on each chart, reattached it, rerun it.

All showed v1.0b version.

--- 帖子 #1002 ---
Oh man, now I'm jealous.  Oh.......Oh.....Oh....Oh..AAAHHHH.....lol.

Back OT, can I use the EA on a different TF or will there need to be a change in code.

--- 帖子 #1003 ---
It repaints...

See below the AUD/JPY daily charts.  Use the buy arrow on the chart to see where the resistance was when I bought and were it is today.  How is this helpful if it changes its mind after the fact?  If it was valid at that point then it should never change.

When someone looks at a chart with this attached it would be easy to say "I should trade based on these signals".  After all it looks so perfect.  Sell when it hits the red and buy when it hits the green.  Or maybe working on a breakout.

I just don't know if it's useful anymore.

I only downloaded the last version posted.

Curiously the comment doesn't state any version number, it only shows "AshFX_ Autotrader"...

BTW, I absolutely agree that an EA shouldn't be used in a live account, especially if not yet fully tested and corrected, and anyway not after a thorough demo forward testing. Too risky.

--- 帖子 #1006 ---
My apologies. Try this one. I have closed and reopened my MT4 platform to confirn right now.

Thank you.

I agree with you Julio, but we have to wait until the close of the candle.

--- 帖子 #1010 ---
EUR/CAD is looking good too for tomorrow.  Stochs close to 20 though.

--- 帖子 #1011 ---
Here's where I'm at.

Started by closing some trades when I was working out the bugs initially so when all was said and done I was - $36.00.

Balance should be $50,065.92.

AUD/USD 1st trade: $69.00 / - $1.54 swap

AUD/USD 1st trade: $0.00 / - $1.54 swap (break even)

Couldn't get the EA done in time to catch the earlier GBP/USD or that would have been more profit to add.

--- 帖子 #1012 ---
Please do keep in mind that I also have a pair of EAs that I coded for this system.

http://www.forexfactory.com/images/attach/mq4.gif AskFX Entry Only.mq4
http://www.forexfactory.com/images/attach/mq4.gif AskFX.mq4

These EAs are completely unlocked and free to be placed on live accounts. I just ask that the end user have some common sense to not blindly throw EAs onto live account. Those that do will quickly learn a very sharp and painful, but necessary lesson.

--- 帖子 #1013 ---
Ronald,

I ask that you please don't look at me like competition because that's not my intent here.  Because I'm a programmer I would always choose to do things for myself when I can.  I think anyone with time and knowledge would like to know they had accomplished something that they know inside and out and exactly what to expect.  When I program my own EA (because I can) I know exactly what to expect and if something shouldn't happen the way I thought it should have then I know exactly where to look in the code to determine the fix.  I'm a methodical person when it comes to programming and I just prefer to use something I wrote when I can.  I am not asking anyone to use mine over yours and I, in all sincerity, would ask that you not view it that way.  We are all here to accomplish a single goal together and I view us all as a team and not individuals.

It would make no difference to me if 50 people had already written an EA for this system because I would still write my own.  The only reason I added it in the first place is because it was done (why waste it on myself only).

If others feel this is confusing then I can certainly understand that.  I have viewed more than a few of these threads and can see where a lot of people get confused over these things and I have been confused as well at times.

I would think some might find it a benefit to run both EAs and decide which one they like better.  Demo accounts are free and you can install MT4 as many times as you like.  If you look below, all you have to do is give it a unique directory each time you reinstall it and change the latest shortcut to something unique so it doesn't get replaced on the next install.  Why not test both?  Either way I will still use mine because it's mine.  Not because I don't like anyone here, it's just mine.

Thanks for working on and posting an EA for this system.

It would be nice if you posted the source code at some point  so we all could look at it and know exactly what to expect. It makes it easier to test an EA if you can look at the code to see the cause of any anomalies.

--- 帖子 #1017 ---
I agree to an extent but having written several of these already I have seen more often where people take what I've written, make their own changes, repost and then you have several copies of what started as the same EA.  Which one should I use?  This one does this, that one does that...  And not all of those changes (in fact a majority) modified by people who don't fully understand programming and how their changes may affect an EA that worked in the first place to add some new feature.

I have also seen on 2 specific occasions where a particular member (same person both times) takes my code, makes his own changes and starts posting compiled code thus cutting me out of the loop.  Is that fair?  Once bitten...  I'm not holding anything but source code back and fully intend to share the EA as it progresses and will not eventually start charging for it.  I'm just protective of my code.  A number of these EAs end up on eBay and the people profiting from them didn't even write them.  People on this thread have openly shared their thoughts and opinions/ideas and I feel I'm doing the same thing.  It's hard for me to release something I've spent time on.

BoneWeb...

I believe RR comments was just a way of reminding people about his work not seeking competition. Also because some people here are adrenaline freaks would like to have some ea on their live accounts Like for example I wouldn't mind having PIPNailer on my live account after seeing continous profits over losses or even Jarroos DIBS EA.

About source code people will still sell your products irrespective of it being ex4ed or not.. We have potential customers online and yes the will buy.

Most of us love to see what is behind the scene and where we can amend, append or update.. I believe your code is a perfect as is and I support you protecting it I would do the same but still I won't mind sharing my work to the world if am not willing to turn it to profits afterall I am in profits in trading itself why waste my time selling an application then have alot of time wasted on support bugs and the rest..

That's just my 2 pips.

So back to AshFX what potentials are we seeing tonight?

USDCAD - Short

EURCAD - OB Watchout - Short

Great work Mtaboneweb, Great work Ronald Raygun

To be fair, this is something that people accustomed to forums concerning PC games often do. They'll have a detailed spec of their PC in their signature.  It's nothing to do with showing off or anything like that. It's just general information relevant to PC forums (I know, since I used to be active in those types of forums).

All that's happened is he's carried it over.

--- 帖子 #1023 ---
I don't see EUR/USD (PSAR completely wrong) but I do see:

GBP/CHF long (warning : stochs close to overbought)

USD/CAD short (looks great)

EUR/CAD short (warning : stochs close to oversold)

wait for the new candle of course.

Exactly.  I still do PC building/programming/3d graphics/tweaking/overclocking etc...  It's common to sig the specs.  Not trying to upset anyone.  Just habit I guess.  I always enjoy seeing other people's setups, even if they're better or worst.  It's amazing what some people can do with their hardware.  To be honest it's the first time anyone ever had any comment whatsoever about my sig.  My systems not exactly classed as new either, although the A/V side is pretty nice.  It doubles as a home theater if I can drag wifey off the soapies.

If my sig is a sticking point then I will remove it though as I'm not interested in ruining this thread.

BTW, thanks for a great system.  I'm currently forward testing on different timeframes, and will also test on different brokers at a later date.  Will post any positive findings here.

--- 帖子 #1024 ---
hey guys,

im still trying to catch up on this great system...

have a question.. if you look at my pic, on the 7th May ..was that a good trigger signal?  i thought it was and i would have entered on the next signal ie.., on the 8th may I would have sold around 1.0014 with SL high of the previous signal i.e. trigger signal so at 1.0149 but then the price went all the way upto 1.015 then on the 8th may or even 9th may ... it went down again in my direction...

but my SL would have hit isn't it ? but if i had sold on the 8th or 9th may i surely would have bagged a big pot....

am i right abt the trigger signal or am i missing something?

also should my SL have been the high of the candle previous to the trigger signal candle ie. arnd 1.0196 - high of 5/5/08?

thx in advance

--- 帖子 #1025 ---
great attitude buddy !

--- 帖子 #1026 ---
PipNailer doesn't have an EA?  Is the first post still what the whole system is based on or has it been changed/modified along the way?  If it's similar then writing an EA would be a piece of cake.  Obviously the rules are different from AshFX but it looks like the indicators used are the same which I've already coded for here.  Some change in the logic and I could probably post it tomorrow

There are ways to prevent an ex4 from being used on just any live account.  I've heard it's possible to decompile the code although I've also heard it's hard to read after doing this as well.  Anything someone can make then there's someone else capable of breaking it.

This really went further than intended.  I just wanted Ronald to know I'm not trying to screw him over and it can be hard to tell in plain text how someone is feeling when your reading what they wrote, if that makes sense.  Like someone who types with caps but never intended the other person to think they were yelling.

And besides all other things... I didn't come up with the system.  I just wrote an EA based on someone else's hard work.  I'm not saying no one has but the focus of our thanks should always go to forexmoments and I feel we all have so far.

"The Pip Nailer". Any time frame, any pair.

My apologies for not reading that thread before I ask but maybe someone could tell me if the rules are still from the first post or has it changed along the way?

Apologies again.  This is my last post here concerning another system that has it's own thread.  I was just hoping for a quick answer since it came up here.

--- 帖子 #1030 ---

--- 帖子 #1031 ---
SmartKenya, be careful EUR/AUD is not valid for long.  Both AC and AO are red here.

I think it's possible to hack .ex4's by using a hex editor and looking for the tell-tale signature bytes.  Not much point though, as with most EA's the booty is often not worth the effort.  Of course yours would be good because AshFX system works nicely, but most EA's as we all know just blow your account.

--- 帖子 #1032 ---
Guys, my advice would be NOT to take USD/CAD.  Look at USD/CAD on a Daily. It's been ranging horribly over the past few days. In addition, todays red candle is way too long meaning the initial TP would be just as long.

So yes, even though it qualifies for a signal, I always look at recent price action (and this is where discretion comes into trading).

--- 帖子 #1033 ---
Naah I think your sigi is cool. I'm a graphics card nut as well (well, used to be). I remember when the first GeForce came out and everyone thought, "wooah this is gonna blow 3dfx out of the water."

Decompilers do exist, and they generally work accurately--from what I've seen.

I've tried to put in defenses against a decompiler, but nothing's worked so far...(Mixed functions, unnecessary variables, extra functions, copyright "blackbox", code bombs, etc.) nothing's worked so far.

--- 帖子 #1037 ---
Yeah.  A lot of that wow factor has gone these days.  I remember seeing an Amiga 500 running Dungeon Master in the local store, and that was the biggest wow for me.  Of course next week I blew my whole months pay on an A500, 1/2 meg expansion and DM of course.  I remember this vividly because when I got home and set up, I found the miggy had a dodgy disk drive.  I still had to wait yet another whole 24 hours for a replacement.  You don't want to know how many times I tried to load the game in that time.

Thanks for the heads up about USD/CAD.  I see what you mean, and will study more closely in future.

--- 帖子 #1038 ---
Hmm did you say wait; according to AshFX; you might be catching a late bus.

--- 帖子 #1039 ---
I noticed that as well, so I'm glad you mentioned it.  I'm contemplating a short at 50% retracement of that strong bearish candle... but that's probably a discussion for another thread as it has nothing to do with the rules here.

Hi Ash,

Would I be correct to say that all of the above are SS trades due to stochs values for each? If so our stop loss should be the swing high or low appropriately?

BTW your system is showing great results for me demo trading this week. Many thanks!

James

--- 帖子 #1042 ---
Absolutely correct mate. They are all SS trades.

--- 帖子 #1048 ---
Hi All

Just looking at the AUDCAD chart and this pair has been in an uptrend since Nov/Dec last year and is currently near the bottom of the up channel so shorting may be risky.

This is just my opinion and Ash's system has been doing great but thought I should point this out. Ash do you see this as a problem at all?

Ljr

--- 帖子 #1049 ---
SS means "Second Strength" (explained in the manual), hence you place your stop at the "swing low" or "swing high".  By swing, we mean the last major turning point.

Look at my pics, the blue line is where the Swing Low or Swing High is, i.e. where I have placed my stops.

Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #1053 ---
Yeah, I know it's uptrending, but I gathered since the initial TP would be around 35 pips, we'd make that. The system has taken these types of signals before and has come out trumps.

Hi Ash

Thanks for pips gained so far, only in eur/cad as i spreadbet so spread too high on GB/ch & Aud/cad

I noticed that you quoted 35 pip T/P on above, just as a matter of interest that works out on open minus close = 35pips, am i right

Thanks

paul

--- 帖子 #1057 ---
Why don't you trade USDCAD short ?

--- 帖子 #1058 ---
Actually it's the high minus the close. So it's equal to 0.9727 - 0.9679 = 48pips. (not 35)

There's one thing that I'm noticing from looking at Ash's charts.  The last major upswing or downswing candle is calculated by the open and close only, not including the high/low.  The stop is then placed at this candle's high/low + spread.

Is that correct?

I'm looking specifically at the blue line on Ash's EUR/CAD chart.  If this wasn't the case then the stop loss would have been placed on the high of the 8th July.

--- 帖子 #1066 ---
The swing high/low should be the high/low not the open/close. The blue line on the first chart isn't correct but the other two are correct.

--- 帖子 #1067 ---
Okay. Thanks.  It means GBP/CHF stop is at 2.0107 minus spread.

hi

AO  on uj turned red . do we keep this poistion since we didnt take the first lot yet . or we close it .i mean is the AO  changing color is a sign to exit the position at anytime .

thanks

imad

--- 帖子 #1069 ---
I'm not sure about this either.  If the candle closes and the AO is still red and there's been no TP, then I think both positions are left to run until there's a TP or both positions hit the SL.

I do know we have to wait for the candle to close with the AO red though, so we're okay until tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #1075 ---
I think that on GBPCHF Ash is taking the last swing at the low of the july 08 candle; IMO about 170 pips can be considered a swing (from the high of the july 3 candle to that low).

Maybe it was indeed a mistake but this is the possible explanation I see there.

--- 帖子 #1076 ---
Is chf/jpy even a qualified signal?

Both EA: (AskFX and AskFX Entry Only) opened this pair and it looks like making profit so far.

--- 帖子 #1077 ---
I've got

EUR/CAD SL=1.6180 TP=1.58356

GBP/CHF SL =2.0107 TP=2.05089

but depending on how you interpret the chart of Ash's you may want to set SL for GBP/CHF at 2.0208

I never took the AUD/CAD because it's not on Oanda.

Nope.  Short signal, but Green AC.  I've noticed some weirdness with this EA too.  I caught it opening a single trade with no SL or TP, but this was on a five minute TF, so I assumed that was the problem.

--- 帖子 #1078 ---
Correct.

The reason why I had the blue line (i.e. SL) on the GBP/CHF chart at that point was because it's a very strong Support point stretching back into mid May, therefore we can use this to our advantage.

Take a look:

--- 帖子 #1079 ---
If we're not in profit, then we let our positions run till they either hit our original SL, or our first TP.  If our first TP is hit and the AO is already the opposite colour (in this case red), then we close all our positions for a profit.

--- 帖子 #1080 ---
forexmoments,

According to Ashly system: This pair is consider the SS trade or not?

I need your opinion about the cross of the Stochs here:
Is the Stochs crossed below 50 or not?

(It looked to me at the opening of today, the Stochs has gone up to over 80. Does it matter?)

My AC was not green. The trade would be opened depending on the the stoch settings and the stoch logic as well as the psar interpretation.

--- 帖子 #1083 ---
But, we are on the 3rd PSAR dot bar today. Why open a trade?

According to the Ashly System: we open a trade at the next day of the first PSAR dot bar.

--- 帖子 #1084 ---
CHF/JPY on the daily with green AC.

From the manual:

Sell: When you see the first PSAR dot above the candle, AND the AO is red, and the AC is red, etc..

--- 帖子 #1085 ---
I am not saying it should take the trade. My point was the AC was red yesterday and if you look at the EA's logic it sees a valid signal because it does not check if it is the first day of the signal.  The trade would also depend on your stoch settings.

--- 帖子 #1086 ---
Understood.

that's a bit of a worry...

--- 帖子 #1087 ---
Yes, but the Stochs is below 50....... (or maybe I was wrong about this?)

Do you look at the crossed point (it's a few days before the first PSAR dot, and it was above 50), right?

--- 帖子 #1088 ---
With my account it doesn't look like some of those were valid trades to take.

--- 帖子 #1089 ---
Ronald Raygun

Your ea is fantastic. One question and I apologize if I have glanced over this. Does your ea take in account swing trades? I seem to have orders opening when stochastics are below or above and all other signals are valid, but the stop loss only account for the previous candle.

--- 帖子 #1090 ---
Yeah, everything is fine, just the EA is not taking the first PSAR.  There are a number of other rules it's not following too.  Must be repairable though.

--- 帖子 #1091 ---
I agreed with you, I saw none valid trades, today.

--- 帖子 #1092 ---
So: kenshin,

Do you think this pair: CHF/JPY is a SS trade or Qualified trade?

Trader8686

-------------------------
Just like to learn it better!

--- 帖子 #1093 ---
Are you using FXDD because I personally checked up on the EA to make sure they were all valid.

--- 帖子 #1094 ---
Neither...

For qualified everything needs to be red on the first PSAR.

For SS, then only AO can be green.  Because the AC is green on first PSAR then it isn't SS either.

Doesn't matter where Stochs are.  It's already broken the AC rules for both types of entry.  On qualified it breaks the AC rule, and on SS it breaks the AC rule.  Only AO can be green for SS trade.

Don't get me wrong, I'm just looking at what the manual says.

--- 帖子 #1095 ---
Yes I am. Sorry I only just saw 1 false trade. I didn't look at today's trades but here is what was wrong.

7/7 AUD/JPY Should not have bought AO was red. It looked like you went in too early when the Awesome Oscillator was probably green but switched over, or maybe you put the trade in yourself.

It looks like at least one of your CAD/JPY orders should have closed with 77 pip profit too.

--- 帖子 #1096 ---
Some initial testing has been skewed fixing bugs along the way but they are close the were they should be.  Remember that for a second strength trade the AO does not have to agree color wise.  Only the dot, the bar direction, the AC, and stochs really count for an SS trade and then only if the stochs haven't moved to far (over 80 or under 20).

--- 帖子 #1097 ---
Also, whenever a trade is entered it's determined by the completed bar before it and that shouldn't change which is why we wait for the bar to be completed.

--- 帖子 #1098 ---
I didn't realize your system was designed for second strength trades too. It's unfortunate the results are so so at the moment. Please keep us updated with how your trades are doing.

Also, everyone else going by the system, ea or not, please keep us posted if your in in the positive or in the red.

Thanks,

Current manual AshFX situation:

CAD/JPY second trade hit stop loss and broke even

USD/JPY long +12 pips SL 104.950 TP 107.662 (both trades open)

EUR/CAD short +37 pips SL 1.61860 TP 1.58356 (both trades open)

GBP/CHF long +2 pips SL 2.02010 TP 2.05089 (both trades open)

Keep in mind my SL's include Oanda spread.

Possible trades for tomorrow:

GBP/JPY long SS (caution: lot's of doji, possible reversal,  but maybe we will get a PSAR signal if there's a small rise in price, uptrend since 18th March.  I'll probably stay out of this one even if there is a signal.  Too much indecision over the last month.)

GBPCHF; AUDCAD Running...

Ash, what is going to happen in the next few hours?

--- 帖子 #1113 ---
All three trades from last night are down. However, you need to look at these trades in context with the other profitable trades that this system has so far produced. No system is 100% correct all of the time. The thing I am looking for is a system that is profitable on a monthly basis taking into account the winners and losers.

One thing I would say is that the stop loss, specially on these SS trades, is large. That does concern me a little.

Also, quite often after "banking" the first TP the trades retrace to the BE SL.

--- 帖子 #1114 ---

My crystal ball is foggy...swami says to watch

--- 帖子 #1117 ---
Got to agree with you there. Looking back, Ash decided not to take the USD/CAD trade because it looked to be in a range (and because of the long daily candle) and if anything GBP/CHF looks to be in a tighter range than that.

Personally, I would prefer just to take the trade rather than have to rely on the recent price action but I guess thats not a particularly "intelligent" way to go. It does add a level of subjectivity to trade selection though.

Second part of that trade hit the revised stop on my system - so out for a total of +71 pips!

--- 帖子 #1119 ---
Hi Ash or anybody,

I am sure that i am right tha the T/P for Eur/Cad is 1.5840 =

high of previous candle = 1.6005 minus

close of previous candle = 1.5922 = 83 pips

Open price = 1.5924 minus 83 pips = 1.5841

Thanks

Paul

--- 帖子 #1120 ---
Yes I agree...I always look at trend lines and general price movement too. Best way really. That and couple it with another system like Ozfx  If both point to the same pair movement...its definately worth a shot!

USD/CAD was an Oz signal, but aud/cad wasnt... USD/CAD pair going the right way, maybe aud/cad will follow soon...I hope

Aud/CAD long term is a bit tricky...its got a double top resistance level at 9800...but long term trend is up. Now its a case of whats stronger. Weekly chart looks like it might come down a bit in the future, but I dont like holding pairs like aud/cad for long because of the swap...itll kill you in interest payments just to stay in the position.

Ashfx whats your take on aud/cad and gbp/chf?

Cheers

--- 帖子 #1121 ---
AUD/JPY's first order closed with TP last night and 2nd order was set to break even.  I think there was a question about whether this was a valid trade in the first place?

Bar was up

Dot changed to below

Stochs under 80

AC green

As far as I see it was a second strength trade.  AO doesn't have to agree in this situation as the pdf explains it will most likely change in the next bar or two.

A side note: The EA I wrote has a setting that can be changed to False which prevents the EA from taking second strength trades.  The default is true so it will take them unless changed.

--- 帖子 #1122 ---
We'll be right, just stick to the plan.  The only one which is a bit of a worry is GBP/CHF, but it looks like it might be on the way back up now hopefully.

However, I think I'll be confirming with another system in future too, like OZ or Rads MTF HAS.

I didn't take AUD/USD sell.  Take a look at the candle of the 7th which is the one which determined whether you took it.  On this candle the Stoch signal line is 55.53, while the blue line is 68.17.  i.e., on the important candle blue is above red which is actually a buy signal.  I don't care what the stoch is on the following candle, as when the trade was taken that candle would have been only a few minutes old.  Anyone else see this???

I know I like to be able to see possible trades as well, but absolutely everything must be correct otherwise I'll just sit patiently and watch.

--- 帖子 #1123 ---

Paul

--- 帖子 #1125 ---
I don't see where stoch doesn't confirm a sell on FXDD.  It is close but as you can see on the left of my screen shot the Stoch is 58.7973 and the signal is 59.0973.  Main was below the signal and on top of that I made money on this trade.  I agree it has moved up but I bagged 69 pips and the second trade stopped at break even.  Barely made the 69 as you can see from the chart but it did work and it was a valid signal on that bar for FXDD.

As I posted this I noticed we may have a second strength buy today on this as well.

--- 帖子 #1126 ---
kenshin,

This is very good point, and it worth to double check from now on!

The signal candle is red, can't be a buy signal anyway. However, the Stochs line the blue and the red was a crossing UP, that is a signal against the Ashly system. Cause, for you to Sell, it has to be a crossing DOWN.

How is that?

--- 帖子 #1130 ---
No valid signal on FXDD!

--- 帖子 #1131 ---
Yes, I'm using FXDD but it seems that you get different values from stoch depending on how much you have expanded the chart horizontally.  Here's one with full expansion which confirms what you've said, but it's so close.

The following chart is FXDD with the default expansion and when I hover the mouse on the stoch values then I get what I originally said.

Sorry for any confusion, but I still feel it's way to close.  They might as well be touching. Maybe we should only take it when stochs are showing a definite pattern like // or \\.

Oh yeah, the EA did a number on my demo account. lol.  It definitely does not follow the sl/tp rules or the first psar rule, but I shall let it continue to play.

--- 帖子 #1132 ---
I am taking the trade, eur/usd I will add if lower is seen, looking at the charts the trend is up and it also conforms with Ozfx system.

Hi sharon_gpl,

The numbers are the numbers.  They should not change depending on your zoom on the chart.  I agree they were close but if you're going to make a decision then you should open your data window for the close of the bar values.  Never trust to where you hover your mouse on the chart.

Couple things: What's wrong with the SL/TP on my EAs?

Which EA?

--- 帖子 #1141 ---
AskFX.ex4

SL is not always at the bottom/top of the swing on SS.  Also, its not always taking the trade at the open of the 2nd PSAR.  I also had it open a trade with no SL/TP set on one occasion.  Maybe I've got something set up wrong though, as I'm getting tired.  Square eyes from too many charts.  I am testing it on 15 minute TF, purely for evaluation.  This could be the problem.  I asked about whether a different TF would cause problems previously, but you probably missed it.

--- 帖子 #1142 ---
I didn't code in secondary trades. My EAs only go for the primary trades.

--- 帖子 #1143 ---
Guys, even though today has not been a pip-ridden day for AshFX Daily, bear in mind the nature of this system is that often you have to let the market play out for a few days to see the end picture. We're not stopped out on any of last nights trades, which means we haven't closed anything for a loss. The "beauty" of FX is you never know which trades will run for hundreds of pips, and which trades will stop you out.

Maybe the system has spoilt some of you, especially after seeing the initial and immediate success of it, because as we know there have been so many previous amazing days which turned very fast into profits. Be warned, there will be bad patches. (And I don't consider today to be a bad patch).

You do not have to do what I do of course, but personally, I'm staying in till I hit my TP or my SL.  That's just the stubborn individual in me (and it's kept me in good stead for over a year).

Ash

--- 帖子 #1144 ---
RR,

However, your EA had opened 1 trade for me on FXDD:

It looked like the secondary trades, and is in mistake: Sell CHF/JPY.

(It is a mistake for the secondary trades, if the AO is a green bar, not the AC is a green bar.)

Thanks for the reassurance Ash. I agree wholeheartedly that any system has to be viewed over a longer period than a day or two. Even with the current situation with open trades the system is in positive territory for the week and thats good.

Just been following the system since the start of this week and I am impressed so far. Two things that concern me are:

1. The large stop loss (generally) for SS trades.

2. The method for taking profits on the second part of the trade. 3 of 4 completed trades this week have retraced to the revised SL. I wonder if there is anything that can help with that?

Anyway, thanks for the great work - looking forward to some more profitable trades and to trade live at some point.

James

--- 帖子 #1150 ---
I'm not worried about anything and agree with you fully.  Looking back at some of the past trades you can see some heavy movement in the wrong direction that eventually did what they were supposed to do.  I'm on board with trading the rules win or lose.  Thanks for the system.

Forgive me to interrupt you both: the GBPCHF SL = 2.0107. (not 2.0208)

MTA,

Thanks for your work on the EA.  I have a couple of requests.

Right now it won't take no for an answer.  I exercise discretion in

my trades due to price action or s+r.  I don't go with every pair that fits

the system parameters.  If I close a pair the EA has executed and then

switch the platform on and off (sometimes necessary) the EA will buy

the pair again. Costly.

There are also times I want to exit or TP or scale out contrary to the

system guidelines.

Right now it trades and manages every qualifying pair.

Can you set an option to trade only and an option to manage only?

And of course an option to do it all.

I trade this baby of yours on many pairs on different platforms.

If I want to tweak one of the inputs I have to physically make the

change on every pair on every platform.  Cumbersome.

I there a fix for this?  I'd like to be able to change the lot size

on one pair and have it change on all pairs on that platform.

I appreciate anything you might be able to do with these.

Thanks,

Jim

--- 帖子 #1174 ---
Agreed.  Be interesting to see how it plays out

I was only screwing around there though.

I'm staying out all the same, as it looks like we'd only get approx 50 pips before we hit the top.  We still got the other 3 pairs running so it's not all boring.  I was hoping to wake up and see at least one in profit, but oh well.  It's all a waiting game.  My average profit over the last week was almost 1.5% per day, so I'm not complaining.

--- 帖子 #1175 ---
Thats why it is a Second strength trade!

Freddi

--- 帖子 #1176 ---
First, thanks for your support.

I agree and am currently looking for a possible indicator that the EA could look at for S/R values and determine if trade should still be made.  I have expressed this earlier in the thread.

The EA looks for the right signal and if found makes the trade.  That trade could happen at any time during the whole daily bar.  Of course there is a value (10 by default) that prevents the EA from buying too high from the open or selling too low.  Once a trade is made then it knows it's done it's job and keeps that in memory as long as it remains running.  If you then close the trade manually and reopen the system then of course it's going to want to trade again.  A suggestion would be to turn off live trading on the EA if you don't want it to trade that day but your kind of wanting to mix manual decisions with an automated system.  An S/R indicator would help if it's reliable.

Keep in mind you can also tell the EA not to trade Second Strength trades in the settings.

Perhaps you should trade these manually.  This EA is not closed to discussion for enhancements but it was originally written to follow the system rules at least for now.  Sounds like you may make decisions on-the-fly based on what you "feel" at that time.  These types of things can be very complicated for EA's since a "human" on-the-fly decision can be more complicated than some people realize and then it all needs to be "hard coded" into the EA.

Any pair you open a chart for and attach the EA to it.

Trade only is possible but not manage only.  Well, it can be but I'm not interested in the work to manage only.  When an EA doesn't place it's own trades it has no idea which trades it should/shouldn't manage.  It may end up altering trades you didn't intend it to manage.  Things can be done with comments (EA tracks down trades with specific comments) but it gets sloppy.  When an EA is programmed correctly the programmer gives the orders a magic number value.  That value is the looked for when looping through the trades along with the symbol and maybe even a specific comment for the order.  When you place a manual order you can't give it a magic number.

If you want everything the exact same then you can get one chart set exactly how you want it and then save it as a template.  You can then apply that template to any of your other charts.  You will have to set the initial template for each MT4 install or copy the template file to the other locations.

So would I but the I can see potential problems with that as well, especially if your running various other EAs that you may not want changed as well.  As far as I know there is no way to do this.

Thanks for your quick and detailed reply.

I know nothing about mq4 or EA's and what

they can/can't do but I have been able to

exercise similar options with the EA attached below.

I imagine your code is too complex for options

like that to be applied.

I make my own trading decisions following Ash's system

while applying discretion just as Ash did here:

I would like a robot to manage the trade...without any discretion

at all.

My purpose here is to be helpful for me and also others as well.  To fine tune and yet remain as simple as possible.  I'm not mentally shutting you out just offering back information about some of the complexities that really do or at least can surround an EA.  I will take a look at what you posted and see if I can dissect the inner workings.

If you could perhaps define in great detail some of your decision makeing on these trades and what tools you use to make those decisions then something may be doable.

Any thoughts/suggestions are always very welcome.  Forgive me if I'm quick to shoot certain things down but I only do so when I've already been down a certain road but that doesn't mean someone could not offer something I haven't thought of or a different approach and you don't have to be a programmer to do that.

Thanks again.

Hi Matt

I have been on the look out for a Fib indicator. It doesn't seem to be supplied in the  basic MT4 indicators, unless I am mistaken. Would you be so kind as to let me know where I could find the Fib indicator you are using in this post?

Thanks. . .

Hi mtaboneweb

I have come across a script that will allow one to attach a magic number to a manual trade. I don't know if it works properly as I have never had cause to test it. Since it was provided on public thread such as this I assume it may be shared.

The reason I bring this up is I read a couple of posts back that it may not possible to attach a magic number to a manual trade but I think this script may make it possible. Please let me know if you would find it of any use and I will post it.

Good Trading. . .

mtaboneweb,

My fault for not making myself clear.

Your EA appears to do two things very well:

1.  It executes trades in line with Ash's system.

2.  It manages trades in line with Ash's system.

I have absolutely no desire to change that or to

introduce any discretion into the EA.

I would like to be able to choose for the EA to do both

of the above tasks or just #1 or just #2.

A trader could use your tool to execute and manage

(as it does now), or just execute trades and the trader

will manage, or just manage the trades that the trader

executes himself.

I appreciate the time you have taken to look at this

and I won't take any more of your time except to answer

your direct questions.

Thanks,

Jim

--- 帖子 #1187 ---
What I meant is that while placing the trade manually you can't enter a magic number.  Through an EA I can put magic numbers on open trades/pending trades all day long.  My point was that you would still need a way to distinguish which trades should actually be hijacked by the EA.  You may not want it to grab all but only certain ones.  One way would be to enter a unique comment and then have the EA look for that as it loops through the trades but I feel that can have it's own problems.

I'm not saying it would happen but if someone forgot to add the comment, mistyped the comment, etc. then they could end up in trouble because the EA might not find the right match.  I have used comments as a way to monitor/manage trades and in fact I do that with this EA.  Second order's comment is the TP of the first.  This way if the EA is interrupted or the first order stops out, etc. I can still get the information needed to know when to update to break even.  But in my EA I know exactly what to expect in the comment and it also has the symbol and magic number confirming I have the right trade.  The EA will not mistype my comment.

I know it seems like I'm going on but I feel it's important for us all to understand at least a bit.  This is also not meant to discourage or say something can't be done.  If I can enlighten some on the mysteries behind an EA than they may also be able to translate to me what they want and how they think it may work.

I always read more into what people may ask of me because I'm used to digging for what they really want.  If someone asks me for a donut then I can guess that they'll also want coffee (2 creams / 1 sugar), a plate, spoon, napkin, etc.  At this point I need you (whoever) to be as specific as possible.  Seeing the whole picture initially reduce fixes, work arounds, kinks, etc.

--- 帖子 #1188 ---
Jim,

Thanks for the support.

Making the EA execute the trades only is not a problem.  A simple if "manage == true" then also manage.

Grabbing trades that were placed manually I feel is a bigger deal and here's what I'm thinking when you ask. Based on the system's current rules without turning the EA into something else entirely...

What if more than 2 trades are placed (how is that handled?)

How can I effectively grab the right trades (what would I need the end user to do?)

Does EA set TP / if they have do I replace or let it stand

Does EA set SL / if they have do I replace or let it stand

Tailing stops...

Break even...

etc...

Will I need to allow for user to set their own SL, TP, BE, Trailing stop, etc.

Do you want the option to manage but not trade as a way for you to make the decision which trades you really want to take?  Because I personally feel if it's because someone wants more analysis into whether a trade should be placed above what is there then we should go in that direction.  I would only ask that we don't pile a mountain of indicators on the decision making. That's not the AshFX system anymore and that's why we're all here.  I believe S/R would be a good addition and even forexmoments uses this although it isn't part of his PDF other than to say it's important.  We could have 3 levels of trading.

Take SS trades: risky

Original: mid risk

with S/R: less risk

S/R is something I've been asking about for a while on this thread.  Is there such a thing as a good S/R indicator.  If I could get an indicator or know better the rules of S/R then I could program the EA to consider those if selected in the settings.

What I'm getting at is if more refinement on when trades are taken would make people sleep easier then that's were we should focus our attention if possible.

Please don't feel this way.  I'm configured to think this way because I program for a living.  It's not your fault.  I honestly appreciate your feedback and feel we're all here for a common goal.  Speak up anytime you feel like it and especially if you think I'm getting out of line.

--- 帖子 #1189 ---
There is an easier way to let the EA manage the trades but with discretionary open: use the "ask manual confirmation" box below the "allow live trade" box.

That way, you can have both (manual confirmation unchecked), or just number 1 (manage trades= false) or just number 2 (manual confirmation checked).

--- 帖子 #1190 ---
Good point.  Although I fear you would be buried in confirmations because the EA will try with each tick of the chart to open trades as long as the conditions are met.  I've never tried it though.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1191 ---
Hi Ash:

I am really impressed with your thread. Nice work, keep it up.Just wondering is it possible, when you post a trade, can you please quote your entry price also? That will be really helpfull.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1192 ---
I don't know yet if there is another S/R indicator better than the "Support/Resistance (Barry)" which I think you already got, which is based on fractals (I haven't seen it repainting the past, as it starts both sides from the first fractal it encounters and continues to draw a point until a new fractal is formed, etc...)

The "problem" would be that support/resistance is more an "area" than a specific price level, so the indicator would have to define a certain range for both specs.

Here's a basic link about S/R:

I've been following this thread with good interest, because I'm also developing my own EA.

Don't know how can any good trades be made without S/R levels! Here's a script which generate Monthly, Weekly, and Daily Pivots, and Daily S/R Levels.

Hello mtaboneweb

By using the script that I am refering to one may place an order manually and assign a magic number to the order. Then the trader could assign any EA which has magic number capabilities to manage the trade. This would be best done only if the EA could be set to 'manage only' so it wouldn't buy or sell additional orders.

Whether or not you wish to modify your EA to have a 'manage only' mode is totally up to you of course, I just thought I would share the fact that it is possible to manually enter a trade and assign a magic number.

I have tested this script and it seems to work. I entered a buy, lot size, and magic number. I then attached an EA with the same magic number set to manage trades only. There are two other open trades on the account but the EA is only seeing the one that the magic number was assigned to using the script.

Attached File(s)   OpenMagic.mq4

To use this script place it in your experts/scripts folder. To manually open a trade with a magic number just double click on the script then choose buy or sell, lot size, and assign a magic number.

Happy trading. . .

Thank you.

I do feel like a dough-head as it was there all along! Couldn't see the forest for the trees I guess. I do appreciate the straight answer.

I use your EA and I don't want to unnecessarily complicate  it.  If you can add some flexibility without compromising   reliability then it could be a good thing.

Hi mtaboneweb,

I would like to offer some help re. identifying possible S/R Zones.

There are a number of papers available free on the net re. Drummond Geometry. One of the aspects of this system is the identification of potential S/R Zones through the use of MTF 3 Moving Averages High, Low, & Typical Price.

Currently I'm using the attached #MTF_Moving Average indicator as follows;

Whatever time frame you choose to trade, attach three MTF 3 MA's (High, Low, & Typical Price) for each time frame greater than the one you have chosen to trade - My preference is to skip the next higher TF.

For example;

Trading H1: Open MTF 3 MA's (High, Low, & Typical Price) for each Daily (1440), Weekly (10080) & Monthly (43200)
Trading H4: Open MTF 3 MA's (High, Low, & Typical Price) for each Weekly (10080) & Monthly (43200)
Trading D: Open MTF 3 MA's (High, Low, & Typical Price) for Monthly (43200), this indicator will not show Quarterly so I have to be manually calculate them - If someone can fix this Great!!!

For visual reasons, I'm using an easy to follow colour coding system for each, e.g. High - Red, Low - Blue, & Typical Price - White. I also use different line styles or thickness for each TF.

These MTF MA's identify Possible S/R Zones, obviously there may be some slippage either side of the line.

Hope this helps

Possibillity trade on monday :-

EURUSD  - LONG

Could anyone please confirm these?

--- 帖子 #1209 ---
Agree with you on gbp/usd and usd/chf but the eur/usd and nzd could be weaker longs.

--- 帖子 #1210 ---
This is not a bad idea except your still using an EA to place the order and giving it a magic number at the same time just like mine and many others do.  But then you have to remove this EA from the chart and then Add mine back to it because you can't have multiple EAs attached to the same chart.  You couple have multiple charts each having their own EAs but that could end up being a lot of charts.

Like I said earlier.  I believe making the EA better informed on which trades to place in the first place would be a better approach.  Then there's no switching and worrying about did I switch digging through charts, etc.  It adds work to a process that should be simple which is what an EA is supposed to do (make things simple for the trader).  We could also possibly add extra exit strategies as well.  I just don't want to take much away from the original idea of this system.

--- 帖子 #1211 ---
The point of an EA is to augment or even replace a trader. So what if there are multiple charts? Just make sure your core charts are in the front and you won't have to worry about the others.

--- 帖子 #1212 ---
I'll agree with that whole heartedly.  I'll start the new thread today and post the link if the people agree with that.  Besides I could still post results from the EA here.  Or would we rather keep it out of the picture entirely?  I'm not here to cause waves but agree that's probably what's happening right now.

Then I could focus on my own thread and peoples suggestions right there.

Actually, here it is...

--- 帖子 #1213 ---
Excellent idea! As a veteran of the OzFX thread, I saw it evolve from great daily discussions of OzFX trades to endless requests for customized and modified adaptations of the EA. Even though I was a proponent of using the EA, I would have to admit that the OzFX thread became totally bogged down with EA minutae.

I know your efforts are well-intended, so best wishes on the new thread. One word of caution, though: On the OzFX thread, the EA creator was besieged not only with requests for modifying the EA, but also with a barrage of criticism every time there was a string of losing trades. Traders somehow seemed to forget that the EA was simply implementing the rules of the system, and was no better or worse than the system itself. It finally reached a point where the EA programmer said "Adios . . . you're on your own from now on".

Hopefully, you have a thick skin, but be prepared. Have fun with the new thread. I, for one, will be following along closely.

Another way to prevent clutter;

Agree with you on: USDCHF only.

As for GBPUSD: (A second s trader, imo)

The main line (blue line) of the Stochs is at 70 which is too high for Long.

The signal line (red line) of the Stochs is under 50,though.

(Does it have to be both line under 50 to make a quilified signal, or just red line under 50 is OK?)

Hi jcllosag

Looking at the GBP/CHF as the stochs were over the 50 line when you took the trade it would have been an ss trade so the stop is set at the swing low(2.0107 ) so you would still be in the trade.

Folks,

Didn't the week start well - good, profitable trades. However, the last part has been poor with EUR/CAD, GBP/CHF and AUD/CAD showing heavy losses.

Glad I am just paper trading the system at the moment as these three trades would take me into a serious loss (from 4% up to 5% down). A little down-hearted I must admit!

Well, time to take a deep breath and enjoy the weekend before re-commencing next week. Hope for some more profitable trades then.

Hope you all have a great weekend!

I wanted more information on the PSAR. Thought I would share it.   Big E

Parabolic SAR
Parabolic SAR provides a useful tool for catching new trends early, offering excellent buy and sell signals.
Overview <LI class=EducationIndexTXT>The Parabolic SAR (stop and reverse) is a trend-following system that sets "stop-losses." <LI class=EducationIndexTXT>It works well in trending markets, but tends to whipsaw during non-trending, sideways phases. <LI class=EducationIndexTXT>A parabola below the price is generally bullish. A parabola above the price is generally bearish. http://www.chartfilter.com/reports/c31_files/c31-1.gifThe Parabolic System, developed by Welles Wilder who also developed the Relative Strength Index (RSI), is usually referred to as the Parabolic "SAR" (stop-and-reverse). Mr Wilder designed this indicator to supplement the other trend-following systems.

The Parabolic SAR is a "stop-loss" system used to set trailing price stops. The name of the system is derived from its parabolic shape, which follows the price movements in the form of a dotted line. When the parabola follows along below the price, the trader should be buying or going long. A parabola above the price suggests selling or going short.

The particular value of the Parabolic SAR is that it allows traders to catch new trends relatively early. If the new trend fails, the parabola quickly switches from one side of the price to the other, thus generating the stop and reverse signal.

Mr. Wilder built an acceleration factor into the Parabolic system. To allow the trend time to become established, the movement of the indicator starts off slowly - with the dots close together. As acceleration increases, the parabola move faster (with the dots further apart) until it catches up to the price action.

As with most indicators, Parabolic SAR performs best in trending markets, and is less reliable during sideways or congestive phases.
Signals

The Parabolic SAR is an outstanding indicator for providing exit points - offering sell signals when the parabola moves above the price. Buy signals are generated when the parabola falls below the price. Of course, these signals need to be confirmed by the price action itself and other, complementary indicators.

It is always useful to examine different time periods; using daily, weekly and monthly charts.
Combining Parabolic SAR with DMI

John Murphy, author of Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets, recommends using a filter to complement the Parabolic system. He suggests using the Directional Movement Index (DMI) to help eliminate whipsaws and false signals in the more sensitive Parabolic system. As a simple rule of thumb, he observes that the DMI and Parabolic SAR indicators can complement one another as follows: "When the +DI line is above the -DI line, all Parabolic sell signals can be ignored." We can see the effectiveness of this strategy below. (The ADX line is essentially the smoothed difference between the +DI and -DI lines.)http://www.chartfilter.com/reports/c31_files/c31-2.gif

Paul,   My adx is set on 4.  Make the + green and the minus red. I added a 1 & 3 Moving average. When the lines cross on the MA put your cross hair on it, look down at the ADX. If it's a green line coming up, it's a buy signal, if a red line crosses the green and coming up, it's a sell signal. Adds proof of strength to your Ash signals. Came from a thread by ExpatX. Good on all time frames. Big E

I got a little excited and tried to create threads for my other EAs as well since I felt doing this was a great way of separating the EA from the systems.  I just did too many in a short time and...  It was suggested here that I do this and I agree with it.

Things are now straight so please post any EA specific things on this thread...

Hi Ash & Everybody on the thread:

Can some one please tell me around what time frame the trade calls/signals are posted on this thread every day? I was thinking that it would be GMT + 3 Hours, as per FXDD. Not sure though.

Thanks.

Happy Trading all.

--- 帖子 #1274 ---
The purpose of this thread is to learn to trade Ash's system not to follow someone's signals. There is a PDF in the first post that will explain the system. You can learn the information by reading that PDF and the thread. There are usually people discussing what trades they see around the start of the new day on FXDD.

--- 帖子 #1275 ---
Personally I dont usually take sunday's trade;also i think we all shouldnt be too dependent on Ash to be spoon-fed

@forexxer; he usually takes trades as soon as he feels the system's criteria are all meet mixed with some judgement calls. But i dont know why he has not been around for today though.At least to give more light to our views.

Well I decided to stay out of these trades, and at the moment all 3 trades are going against us.
after last weeks trades and now last nights trade indications it seems the Ash system is going through a bad patch, is there any reasons for this?

can we improve the system in any way that will help our decision to take the trade or to stay out?

--- 帖子 #1278 ---
Thanks for your comments. I do wonder though why you are on this forum if you do indeed follow your own advice and trade independently (in which case you wouldn't need or want to be here).

However, we are all learning, aren't we? This is Ash's system and I am merely interested to know how he operates it profitably for himself. This is why I asked the question I did.

Just my two penn'orth (as we say in the UK).

--- 帖子 #1279 ---
Yeah i seel those signals too. However, problem with trading the daily time frame imo is that you just can't go in anytime of the day expecting it to go your direction.

For me, I drill down to the hourly time frame and using fibo retracement + trendlines to approx my entry.

Currently I'm monitoring the USD/JPY, USD/CHF, and EUR/USD. I think for the past few hours since opening its probably doing a retracement. U can draw trendlines on it right now and you'd probably see a bull flag or a wedge. How I'm planning to trade these pairs is to wait till they break out of the trendlines (wedge or flags) in the direction of the overall daily direction.

--- 帖子 #1280 ---
So, you look for daily signals from Ash's system and then trade hourly using your own - is that correct?

--- 帖子 #1281 ---
Fonzie approves...

--- 帖子 #1282 ---
Yup. I'm using a 6SMA/23SMA cross + Parabolic SAR.

So far that has worked out for me pretty well although I'm still quite a newbie in trading.

Do check out my blog, I've got some examples there.

--- 帖子 #1283 ---
Hi All,

I think we should all give Ash a collective round of appluase for his system, if you look at the EUR/CAD now it is working itself down from its highs on Friday

I point you all to the quote he gave us previously

"if were not in profit, then we let our positions run till they either hit our original SL or our first TP"

I was in major panic Friday when it seemed to be going up without stoppng but now i will STICK TO THE RULES NO MATTER WHAT and not say anything until the FAT LADY SINGS as they say

Thanks

Hello everyone!

I have followed this thread for weeks and receive Ash's alerts. I see that there are some that let their emotions get the best of them and stay out of the game. I have read a lot on the technichal and fundamentals of trading and the biggest thing that I have taken from all of it is no matter how good a system is, it comes down to your emotions. I have taken many trades and as soon as it moved against me, I would get nervous and exit the trade to find out hours later it went my way!

So, I would suggest reading about the mental state of trading and possibly looking at finding a time frame that works best for your trading style. I also drill down to smaller time frames for entry and comfirmation along with using  Fibs, and candle recognition.

I took the GBP/USD long trade.

Happy trading

--- 帖子 #1285 ---
And, you can also wait for to get in to Buy/Sell, after the retracement is done, either on 4H or 1H (the bigger time frame the better). That can be judged by looking at Stochs (OB/OS) line, and I am looking for more education in this area, the Stochs. Does anyone here know where I can receive more educaton on the Stochs?

I ended up taking 2 of the 4 trades the GU and UC, both came within 5 pips of my initial profit target so I closed half the positions and moved the other half to BE, hopefully we will catch a nice little trend.

USD/JPY - Open with ~+50pips

Personally I don't really like to use the 4H time frame. To me big time frames give a good indication of the overal direction, but smaller time frames gives you an earlier entry/exit point.  IMHO http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #1299 ---
I don't think you were late on the entry. Are you talking about your own modifications to the system?

With the PSAR flipping today, the current daily bar would be the first possible signal bar. The AshFX Daily trade would be placed at the start of tomorrow's bar if the trade parameters are met.

Good to see that you are in profit though. It looks like you have caught a nice move.

I can't seem to track down the thread that referred to how news seems to affect this system by Ash...

But..

This week is a big week for Forex related news with many in the markets expecting a trend/direction to be established for the coming weeks after all the news has been priced into the market towards the end of the week.

My personal approach has been to close all my trades this morning esp. those involving, GBP, USD and EUR using this strategy by Ash in my Demo account.  This is mainly due to the fact that I am used to intraday trading and by habit avoid trading half an hour before or after important news.  It has worked for so far in intraday strategies as, although I may not be making money at those times, but I'm preserving my capital and not exposing it to more risk than I need to.

Is the rolling daily strategy less susceptible to news (in whatever direction) than intraday trading?  I know some trader who only trade long term and they never pay attention to news unless there is some sort of major tragedy or disaster.

What are other people doing trading Ash's daily system?  What are noticing about any effects of news on this system and their trades, live or demo?

(I'm off to enjoy the time off I have now with all the imminent news )

--- 帖子 #1304 ---
I let it running on demo, so I will give it a try for aotumatic close trades.

Hi everyone.

Apologies I haven't posted for a couple of days. Good to see people continuing on the thread in my absence, and most importantly, making pips.

I have been getting many emails recently, from people asking me loads of questions about the system, and also to provide daily signals on this thread with my exact specifications of entries and potential exits. Whilst I appreciate that this will help relative newcomers to forex, sometimes I'm just not around, or am busy, so it's kinda hard for me to answer every question. I don't look at this forum 24/7, and this thread seems to move rather fast.  However, I'd really appreciate if other AshFX "veterans" (umm even though this was only released last month!) could help me out in answering some of the questions other newcomers may pose.

Many thanks.

--- 帖子 #1325 ---
Guys, sometimes even though there may be a lot of setups, you don't have to necessarily trade each one.  Look at the ones that aren't near S/R points, and/or the ones which aren't ranging, and then make a decision.

--- 帖子 #1326 ---
Hi, these were all SS trades (I think) - I can't work out how your EA calculated the first TP.

Could you point me in the right direction. Ash's document says for a long, to calculate the pips as the previous days candle high minus close. Is this the candle with the first PSAR?

Hope you can help.

--- 帖子 #1327 ---
hi ash fx

witch is the best set up for today ?

thanks

--- 帖子 #1328 ---
That would be for a short (high - close).  Long is close - high of the signal bar (previous bar).

--- 帖子 #1329 ---
Many thanks - I had it the other way around!

--- 帖子 #1330 ---
Ok guys, this is my recommendation for tonight, and what trades I am taking:

Short - Eur/Gbp (FIRST STRENGTH TRADE).

Enter @ 0.7933, SL @ 0.7983, TP1 @ 0.7883, TP2 @ AO turns green.

My advice is not to short Eur/Chf, the candle is relatively long, and there's strong imminent support.  Same goes for Eur/Aud. Also, Aud/Cad has way too much resistance, so I'm not trading that.

Concerning Eur/Jpy and Gbp/Jpy, (not only are the candles too long), in fact I am short since market open on Eur/Jpy & Gbp/Jpy, and now may be too late to enter.

E/A

thanks

--- 帖子 #1332 ---
Good decision.

--- 帖子 #1333 ---
To ASH's point just entering a trade because all the indicators line up is risky without other considerations. With that said if you are mechanically trading this way or on auto with an EA your win lose ratio will be marginal. Trader discretion considering candle patterns, support and resistance as well as fundamentals are all worth considering before taking a postion. Knowing when not to trade is a discipline that takes time and patience to master. If it were as easy as just jumping in and setting SL and TP this would be the holy grail and we would not need anything else. There is no Holy Grail but your own ability to master the space between your ears and develop your individual trading style that works for you. Thanks Ash again for Pipnailer and the Daily system which by using I have gotten alot farther down the road in becoming successfull at this.

--- 帖子 #1334 ---
forexmoments,

I am FXDD as yours.

My EA had entered (TakeSSTrade=false) First Signal Trades only:

EURGBP and EURJPY.

My judgement is: EURGBP, EURJPY, GBPJPY are all First Signal Trades.

Can I ask you, why is that candle too long is not good? It can be a strong force of downtrend, imho.

--- 帖子 #1335 ---
I don't see how your beginning of the week short EURJPY trade had anything to do with your AshFX Daily system. Was this just a trade you took based on another trading setup? Other than the candle being to long for you to enter a real trade, the EURJPY signaled yesterday for a full AshFX Daily trade today. At least the way I see it.

--- 帖子 #1336 ---
From a technical point of view the GBPJPY 's Stoch main had reading of 48.37 for yesterdays bar. So an EA would not take the trade as a first strength trade. Forgive me for being picky just pointing that out before I continue.

A couple of questions for anyone;

Would we still be in the GBPJPY trade from Monday? Therefore no trade today.

Disregarding the length of the bar,

Should we consider a trade on GBPJPY based on a signal bar where Monday's trade closed at TP. Should we re-enter trades in the same direction when there was a TP on a prior bar? Without the AO changing colors in between?

I'm not picking on you Trader8686. I just like your viewpoint. You also post your comments in a way I understand so I can agree or disagree. I don't usually post if I agree. Cheers

--- 帖子 #1337 ---
The Stoch was below 50 for GBP/JPY.  Therefore it was a 2nd strength trade.

nvwine,

I think he meant, he opened his trades at the beginning of today's market. And, that has been hours ago, so it is kind of late for us, he thinks. (Well, to be honest with you, I don't think it's been too late. As long as it is a good trade and the entry price is better than hours ago while market just opened, it is ok to get in. imho.)

The EA checks many things but it doesn't change the fact that it was a 2nd strength trade according to the rules of the AshFX system.  The stoch position is one of the major factors in deciding 1st or 2nd strength and the EA doesn't look at shades of 50.  It's either above or below.

sorry, newbie asking here, why you concern the lenght of the candle? some people say it shows the trend, do you mind explain that, thanks a bunch .

--- 帖子 #1347 ---
I'm curious what your first TP was on these 2 trades. Based on the standard AshFX rules as I understand it, the first TP for EJ would be over 200 pips and over 150 pips for UJ. While both these trades are in profit currently, they're nowhere near those targets.

Hi Anyone,

Something is really bugging me and i need an answer so i can go forward with more confidence when placing trades.

When Ash says that it is a first strength trade that is because the STOCHS have not crossed the 50 line

Now what i would like to know is which line is the signal line that determines a first strength trade

As you can see from the chart attached the red line has not crossed the 50 line as of 2nd cnadle so am i right in assuming that this is the line that Ash refers to when he says that it is a first strength trade becuase this red line has not crossed the 50 line

Also what does the blue line represent

Thanks

Paul

--- 帖子 #1352 ---
The signal bar would be yesterday's bar. Both the Stoch main line and Stoch signal line are above the 50 level on that bar. I opened the data window to confirm. That is why Ash identified it as a first strength trade. In the PDF Ash speaks of the Stochs in a plural tense so both lines would have to be above 50.

If you are talking about the blue line on the Stoch that is the Stoch main line with the red line being the Stoch signal line. If you are talking about the blue line on your main chart, I would guess it is a moving average. We don't have that line on the default template so I don't know. If you press Ctrl+I or right-mouse-click on your chart and select 'indicator list' from the drop down menu you will be able to determine what the chart blue line is.

--- 帖子 #1353 ---
You make some very valid comments and I hope you don't take this the wrong way. However, can you justify the wording I have emboldened above? Have you back tested the system to prove that just taking the signals is or is not profitable?

I know that Ash advocates checking S/R levels, candle sizes etc. which is sensible but I just wonder if this system is capable of making a profit with an EA that takes the signals only without any subjective judgements.

Just a thought from a total novice!

--- 帖子 #1354 ---
Thanks

So what you basically did was before the chart moved to a new candle you checked the stochs reading on the data panel to see if they were above 50, which they were and i assume you did that at 9.55 to 9.59pm before the candle cahnged at 10 pm on the FXDD charts

Could you share your tamplate, please? It looks amazing! Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1358 ---
Greetings . . . this is my first full week of experimenting with AshFX.

OzFX did exceptionally well with the use of the EA or manually for about 2-3 months. After that, though, my results were spotty to say the least on both 4H and Daily trades. I was intrigued by the multiple confirmations used in the AshFx system to validate a trade, so it seemed worth a serious look. So far, so good.

OzFX was my first experience using an EA, and I would be hesitant to try it again with this system. Ash has addressed the need to be aware of S & R before entering a trade, and I agree completely. An EA only determines that the rules of the system have been met, and that may be enough at times, but I personally believe that adding trader discretion to a good system will enhance it even further.

That's a turnabout from what I often said on the OzFX thread, but I learned a valuable lesson over time that an EA may work well, even for extended periods, but it does not and should not replace the trader completely.

With a system based on Daily charts, such as AshFX, trading manually should not be a major issue anyway. That's just my view . . . for those who want to try an EA with this system, I hope it works well for you.

--- 帖子 #1359 ---
That's my question is on page 80 msg 1339.

I think I know the answer, for Sell entry we check the red line, Buy entry we check the blue line.

Everyone pls correct me here if I were wrong.

--- 帖子 #1360 ---
Thanks a lot for the comments yen.

It is true that discretion plays a great role in trading, I have never used EAs and will never do, in fact my trading platform is not MT4 to use EAs; even in my previous post I was referring to the Indicator as opposed to the EA.

I am glad you are happy with your new experiment and wish you all the best, I too believe that this one has more merits.

Hi friend, just attached the print of this trade

Hi guys,

I had something that I needed to get perfectly clear, that's caused me some needless losses because I was mistaken.

In Ash's .pdf manual it says, concerning the exit rules for First Strength Trades:

"As for taking profit, then there are two methods of exiting that should be used together. The first TP is equivalent to the same number of pips as the SL. So, for example, if your SL is 100 pips, then your first TP would also be 100 pips. Once this TP is hit you will close half your position AND you set your SL to breakeven."

The problem I have had on some of the trades is that I was stopped out early when I shouldn't have been. One thing I did wrong on a trade was that I set the initial TP at 100 pips from the entry price when the SL was about 200 pips away. Then I moved the SL to breakeven and the price promptly retraced and stopped me out. (For some reason the number 100 stuck in my mind  ) From now on I'll set the inital TP at the same pips as the SL.

About moving the SL to breakeven after the first TP is hit, I understand that. But what is the best way to proceed after that? Is it best to leave it there until the AO changes color, (the exit price) or would it be safer to trail it down behind some level like the high (low) of the previous day's candle to lock in profits in the event that price makes a strong retracement against you?

What is anyone's thoughts on this?

Thanks.

I'm sure with practice you do not need to use the data window. I used it to make a point. You can always use the data window to check the settings on a previous bar if you do not trust your eyes or want to know why an EA traded the way it did.

The key is you are checking the signal bar and if there is a valid signal, and you think it would be a good trade, you would open it close to the beginning of a new FXDD daily bar.

--- 帖子 #1373 ---
I have decided to stick to the system.

Of course for the TP2 you can use trailing stops to fibo levels, but...Ill let AshFx_Daily do its work.

--- 帖子 #1374 ---
I'm all for robots and mechanically trading. I would love not to spend any more time in front of monitors that i already do. If you can post a winning record after 6 months of robot EA trading or just blindly following indicators without any discretion I will be the first to employ the EA on MT4 and let it run unattended. The proof is over time. These are great methods(thanks ASH) and have a high success ratio when the trades are monitored and managed. Since trying all different TF combinations and pairs over time on the Pipnailer EA I'm just not convinced that Robot trading will be profitable over time in all market conditions. I would love to see results over an extended period of time to prove me wrong if someone would post them unadultered from a live account risking real money. This is what makes these forums great.... the exchange of ideas and methods and the trial and error and results posted by it's participants. Thanks

--- 帖子 #1375 ---
Dude those are some excellent results.

Hi Guys,

Brasilforex,

How are you calculating your gains? Are you taking the gains from the first exit and adding it to the second exit? Or are you taking the gains from the highest earning trade of the two? For example, you take a long on Eur/Usd

You close for a gain on first half of trade:  +75 pips

You close second half for a gain: +105

Do you record it as a gain of +180 or a gain of just 105 total for the entire trade

Further, are you recording it as two wins or one?

I guess this is more directed to the entire forum. I can never get anyone to answer this. Brasilforex, I am not accusing out inflating results but I would guess some "traders" out there do this and "we" need to be aware of this.

Pete

--- 帖子 #1381 ---
Hi, i not uderstant much your question (sorry my english is very poor), i still using this system+ fibo retracements to take my trailing stop and sometimes my target also.

This last trade   EUR/GPB (sell) Closed at +33 was the unique wich i closed manuality.

I only open one trade for pair

Can check my daily trades using this system

--- 帖子 #1382 ---
AUD/JPY was looking good, but this retracement isn't helping...

--- 帖子 #1383 ---
WHYYYYYYYYYY, after looking soooo gooood it now seeds doubt in my mind.

but there might be around 50 pips from open to 50% fib level if it closes around its open but the 50% fib could cause support

Dont know but we will see

Paul

--- 帖子 #1384 ---
looking at it again it has been bouncing off the 28ema since July 1st and if it does not close tonight below the 28ema i MIGHT wait until we get a clear close below 28ema

What do you think ASH or am i talking B-----ks????????

Paul

--- 帖子 #1385 ---
I wont trade this pair!

Juan Carlos

--- 帖子 #1386 ---
I like the way you have fitted the ma to the price action

do you eyeball each chart then just keep putting up different emas

to fit

thanks

--- 帖子 #1387 ---
Hi Guys

At FXDD platform, the parabolic don´t confirm SELL trade.

What do you think about this?

Thanks

Julio

--- 帖子 #1388 ---
Looks like a first strength trade according to Ash's system to me. Obviously, other factors now have to be judged such as S/R, recent price action etc.

--- 帖子 #1389 ---
The retracement is good, help us to set a higher SE price.

Why is that "this retracement isn't helping....."?

--- 帖子 #1390 ---
Lol, because if it retraces too much it might turn into a bull/green candle, meaning a NO TRADE.

--- 帖子 #1391 ---
So, if it closes red/bearish, would it be a FS signal? Thanks Ash.

--- 帖子 #1392 ---
Agree with you, here's not apear too .

But i see one signal to CAD/JPY(Sell)

--- 帖子 #1393 ---
Hi,

no i just have a 28 ema & 200 sma, these i use just for support & resistance and to give an overall view like the Aud/Jpy bouncing around

I wouldnt rely on them 100% but they do give you that little extra edge when its comes to making decisions

Paul

--- 帖子 #1394 ---
Yep, it is a Full Strength Sell.

I am in this.

--- 帖子 #1395 ---
HEllo

How can I get the latest version of EA FOR REAL ACC.

thanks

--- 帖子 #1396 ---
See AUD/NZD (sell) signal too

I'm in these two orders today

AUD/NZD (sell) SL:106.20

CAD/JPY(Sell) SL:1.2774

--- 帖子 #1397 ---
Ash,

SL: 102.89

TP1:102.05

Right?

--- 帖子 #1398 ---
AudNzd - Psar flipped days ago. Did you enter today?

CadJpy - Candle is green so not a valid short

Those entry figures you quote cant be correct either.

--- 帖子 #1399 ---
BrasilForex, can you post an image, showing how you set this? I understand fibo action, but not you method

Thanks!

Demian

--- 帖子 #1400 ---
Ok so am i, your experience cahnged my mind plus its a first strength trade plus the first tp & sl is 42 pips and more importantly the first T/P is above the 28ema

Gone in at 102.43

s/l 102.85

t/p 102.01

2nd trade

open 102.01

s/loss B/E (102.43)

T/P - till AO goes green

Good luck to all else who are in

Paul

--- 帖子 #1401 ---
To me these two trades apear good

--- 帖子 #1402 ---
Hi,

Signal candle is a green bull on the Cad/Jpy so not a signal in my book and by the rules - be carefull

Paul

--- 帖子 #1403 ---
Apologies regarding AudNzd I was looking at hourly chart by mistake so PSAR was completely different, however looking at the daily now the only problem I see is AC is green so this invalidates the trade as far as I understand.

--- 帖子 #1404 ---
Hope this help you

--- 帖子 #1405 ---
How you can see in the image above, not red to me

--- 帖子 #1406 ---
On my screen and in the image you posted for AudNzd the AC is green for the signal candle (first candle where PSAR flipped).  For a short trade AC must be red.

--- 帖子 #1407 ---
As I understand the guidelines the open and sl of the 1st and 2nd lots should be the same.  At 1st lot tp move 2nd lot to b/e and wait for ao to go green.

Jim

--- 帖子 #1408 ---
Hi Ash,

Just a quick question when you have time to answer - do you draw your fib lines from top to bottom or bottom to top

Anybody else who wants to answer are welcome because it would be interesting to see the answers

Paul

--- 帖子 #1409 ---
Uderstand your question now, today AudNzd candle has green ok?

But, i will try few pips

--- 帖子 #1410 ---
The way I have learnt is:

Uptrend - Draw from swing low to swing high

Downtrend - Draw from swing high to swing low.

--- 帖子 #1411 ---
can someone tell me what are the official trades for today , i cant fine ashfx post ,

thanks

--- 帖子 #1412 ---
Thanks.

Never knew that, i just draw them from botom to top in uptrend or downtrend, hmmm interesting

Anybody else ????????

paul

--- 帖子 #1413 ---
Todays candle is not the issue and is not important. Your decision should be based on the candle where the first PSAR changed.

For AudNzd for candle of 16/07:

PSAR flipped to top - Good for short trade

Candle is red - Good for short trade

Stochs above 50 - Good for First Strength trade

AC is green - NOT Good for short trade

AO is red - Good for short trade

Only problem is AC is the wrong colour. When todays candle opened it doesn't matter what colour it is and will probably change many times as price fluctuates. Your decision should be based on the candle where the PSAR first flipped. Obviously you may want to watch the price action on the new day to make your final decision.

This is my understanding of the rules.

--- 帖子 #1414 ---
38.2% and 61.8% (basic reversal points) are symmetric. 50% will always be 50% either way.

So really it shouldn't matter how do you draw it, and many always take the 0% for swing low and 100% for swing high points, independently if we are evaluating the possible pullback from a rise or a fall.

And even "logically",  you can see it both ways: for example, if price rises from, say, 1.9800 to 1.9900 and pulls back to 1.9862, it will have pulled back 38% of the total 100 pips move. So we draw it from low to high. But, it will also be at 62% of the total move, and thus we can draw it from high to low. It will depend on how you usually handle the data.

I prefer the first option (measuring from the START of the move to the END of the move), and if we want to use additional values I find it is more accurate, but I've been getting accustomed to draw it like in the second one (always the same, swing low 0% and swing high 100%) because it is much faster. Because in the end, what matters is the area where it will probably reach tp or reverse, independently of the number or name we assign to it.

--- 帖子 #1415 ---
Agree with you, Paul. It is a green candle, how can you Sell? Careful, pls.

--- 帖子 #1416 ---
No one answered this question I had from earlier:

About moving the SL to breakeven after the first TP is hit, I understand that. But what is the best way to proceed after that?

Is it best to leave it there until the AO changes color, (the exit price) or would it be safer to trail it down behind some level like the high (low) of the previous day's candle to lock in profits in the event that price makes a strong retracement against you?

For example, it could be possible expecially with volitile exotic crosses like GBPJPY to have moves of 500+ pip moves on the daily charts. Does it seem reasonable to leave the stop set at breakeven when the AO changes as slowly as it does?

How about it Ash?

Not criticizing the strategy, but just wondering if anyone has any thoughts on that idea.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1417 ---
Thank you very much BrasilForex!! Now, I know!

Hi Ash,

What is your stop loss on aud/jpy today?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1419 ---
hello, the AUD/NZD insnt valid trade right? there is resistance, CMIIW

--- 帖子 #1420 ---
AUD/JPY...Short.

Looks like you have to take time to read the threads where you stopped earlier and not just the last page

My 2 pips

--- 帖子 #1421 ---
question abt stoch. inside the templae we see 2 colours for stoch. May i know which cross is for sell and which cross is for buy?

--- 帖子 #1422 ---
Hi Dave,

Once first T/P is hit you have a number of options where to place your stop  loss

1. when AO changes colour and then close at end of candle

2. nearest support or resistance points

3. nearest fib levels

4 nearest swing high or low

I suggest you google Baby Pips or any of the above and then get to understand what your money risk is to what you are prepared to lose to win in the end

By the way i would not trade GB/JP - too volatile for me

Paul

--- 帖子 #1423 ---
so whose aud/jpy short hit their SL today?

c'mon guys you can't just post when you win. that's too biased, making every system look good. you gotta post your losses too.

--- 帖子 #1424 ---
My SL hit

--- 帖子 #1425 ---
Is anyone keeping a record of the ashfx system? Like every trade taken based on its rules, with SL/TP by the rules too?

--- 帖子 #1426 ---
Aud/Jpy

I am still in and raised my stop loss 103.42

looking to see what happens at the fib 81.8% around the 103.00 mark

Anyone think thats a wise thing to do?

--- 帖子 #1427 ---
Yep, me too!

Question is - is this just one of those losing trades that are unavoidable (i.e. no system is perfect)? Or, with hindsight, can we deduce why this trade failed?

New to trading and this system, but looking back to the signal candle - could this be a hammer signalling rejection of a fall? Just a thought.

--- 帖子 #1428 ---
AUD/JPY

If everybody has played by Ashs rules then we have all  been stopped out.

but as he has said you cant win them all just move on.

--- 帖子 #1429 ---
I am attempting to do this but only started last week so don't have any results just yet.

However, it would appear that the consensus is that just blindly following the signals would not provide a profitable system (see previous posts). Trader discretion is needed to avoid support and resistance, trend lines, fibs etc.

--- 帖子 #1430 ---
Time will tell! 103.42 I guess is the last swing high which you are hoping provides resistance? Hope it does....good luck!

--- 帖子 #1431 ---
That i disagree; if you look at the trend it has been ranging.I didn't personally pull that trigger because of this.

--- 帖子 #1432 ---
I see what you are saying. Looks like a range since 26 June for the past 3 weeks. Interesting that Ash has rejected possible trades recently due to ranging but took this one.

Ash - if you read this do you have any insights you could give use...thanks.

--- 帖子 #1433 ---
yeah; i am glad you are seeing it now;

Good judgement calls are so so important in this art

--- 帖子 #1434 ---
anyone like to help with this question?

--- 帖子 #1435 ---
The reason i didn't take the AudJpy short is it had bounced off the ascending trend line with a good Pin bar so I figured it would be going up before comming down. That trend line has been on my chart for sometime and when it touched it almost to the pip it showed as good support

--- 帖子 #1436 ---
Excellent analysis, thanks. Just wish I had seen that before placing the trade!

--- 帖子 #1437 ---
Yeh, how come I haven't thought about it? It was a big pin bar.

--- 帖子 #1438 ---
Also my SL hit...

--- 帖子 #1439 ---
Yep, Sl hit .

But, you can't win them all .

--- 帖子 #1440 ---
Well guys my Aud/Nzd hit the stop loss

and it looks like my Aud/jpy is going to hit my raised S/L at 103.42

I had a run of not picking winning trades of late!

--- 帖子 #1441 ---
AUD/JPY not heading in the right direction but still got 20 pips or so to go to hit your SL. All is not lost yet.

--- 帖子 #1442 ---
Yep my stop loss hit as well on aud/jpy, but my eur/gbp is still in profit ----------JUST

paul

--- 帖子 #1443 ---
Here my results. I quite stick to the system and generally enter trades late,

between 3 and 5am GMT. 00.00 GMT is 7am for me, not a time to wake up !

I don't use the EA coz daily trades are easy to check once a day.

I am running AshFx on a ODL MT4 demo. Might take a few trades live soon.

It seems that this system is working quite well at the moment . Hope it will last. Btw , a big thanks to Ash for sharing this system.

nice results u gat there Airx3000

--- 帖子 #1445 ---
If you look at Ash's screen shots in the first post and the PDF I think you will figure it out. When the blue Stoch main line crosses above the red Stoch signal line it would be a buy condition. When the blue line crosses below the red line it would create a sell condition.

--- 帖子 #1446 ---
Thank you for sharing, and this is exactly what I need to learn: the exit strategy.

So, correct me if I were wrong, pls:

You first set up a 50 pipis trailing stop, as soon as you open the first new opened trade, and let it hit the tp. Then you set up a 25 pips trailing stop for the second half of the trade.

--- 帖子 #1447 ---
I don't know if anyone see any trades for tonite except maybe for GBPCHF which i personally wont take; but i think we might have to wait till next week before we get any good entry again.

--- 帖子 #1448 ---
I saw the same trade. If you dont mind me asking, why would'nt you take the trade??? Myself personally, I am hesitant because it has been somewhat ranging, but the overall trade is down. I dont really like taking trades that arent going with the trend.

--- 帖子 #1449 ---
Yeah i personally wld not take the trade because my ADX says the pair is ranging.Its in a danger zone.

.

--- 帖子 #1450 ---
hi all,

2 for tonight maybe

Gb/jpy tooo close for to resistance

Paul

--- 帖子 #1451 ---
Hi

I see the ADX is currently around 80 gb/chf, is that arnaging figure and what adx would make you go into trade

Thanks

Paul

--- 帖子 #1452 ---
Guys I took the AUD/JPY because I felt as though it would at least hit the first TP, albeit I knew it was a risk due to recent ranging. Anyway, 43 x 2 pips lost there.

--- 帖子 #1453 ---
Aud /Nzd now stopped out

at 1.2744

--- 帖子 #1454 ---
It's already been pointed out, but keep in mind that this trade was contrary to AshFX rules in the first place. The AC was green when you entered the short trade, so it was strictly a personal decision to enter, rather than a loss created by AshFX rules.

--- 帖子 #1455 ---
Ash,

no need to apolodise, we all have our own minds and we are stilll in profit on the Eur/Gb trade

Bring on the next trade i say

Hi guys

Good signs to trade GBPCHF. I think

--- 帖子 #1457 ---
Yeah sorry i didn't see it well on my Alpari platform but i would not still take the trade as it was ranging for the past few days too.

--- 帖子 #1458 ---
i would not also have any cause blame anybody who trades the GBPCHF as it perfectly obeys Ash's rules

Also i observed that the psar has been showing a down up trend too for the past few weeks;but with what i see is about to happen.I think its about to take an uptrend after a short trend.

--- 帖子 #1459 ---
As I see it...

AUD/JPY - Long - SS trade

CAD/JPY - Long - SS trade

GBP/CHF - Long - SS trade

Just on the strength of the rules of Ash's system.

Any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #1460 ---
I would advice not taken the GBPCHF trade because now the candle is now even turning Red.The trade is still looking so dodgy.I dont know what others take on this though???

--- 帖子 #1461 ---
Yes, You are right I will not trade GBPCHF

--- 帖子 #1462 ---
i don't see any new strong trades today based on ash daily

anyone concur?

Yes.  All the possibilities had "issues".

Jim

--- 帖子 #1464 ---
Hey sorry to sound ignorant right now, but what is an ADX??? I checked my indicators on MT4 to see if I can learn how to use it and I couldnt find it.

--- 帖子 #1465 ---
Average Directional Movement Index:

http://www.metaquotes.net/techanalys...ional_movement

It is located under Menu > Insert > Indicators > Trend.

Asking questions doesn't show any ignorance, much the contrary.

Smart people DO ask.

--- 帖子 #1466 ---
the adx is called average directional movement index in mt4. I dont know much about it but it measures the strength of a trend.  The blue line or solid line lets you know how strong the trend is by how high it is, and the dotted lines let you know what direction the trend is going.

--- 帖子 #1467 ---
Cool, thanks for the link and the direction on how to locate it.

--- 帖子 #1468 ---
Makes sense, it is something I will look into and add to charts for sure. Thanks for the response

--- 帖子 #1469 ---
Any result updates on the SS trades taken for today???

--- 帖子 #1470 ---
Ok, I found it, is the default setting fine? (period=14)

--- 帖子 #1471 ---
I have read in another forum that in general the longer the timescale the lower the ADX period. As for any other indicator, I think this is a setting you might experiment with and analyze which period is better or more accurate.

The                              +DI indicates the up average.
The                              -DI indicates the down average.
The                              ADX, average directional movement index, shows                              whether a trend is in effect by smoothing the                              difference between the +DI and -DI. It shows the momentum over the last "x" bars of the timescale in view.

An ADX of 14 periods will be taking into account the last 14 bars, be it days, hours or minutes.

CADJPY    +68 pips both trades open

--- 帖子 #1474 ---
Hi,

I am not able to find CADJPY at my MT4, please advise?

--- 帖子 #1475 ---
Here is how I trade AshFx :

I use the low/high of the signal candle as Stop Loss (SL)

Use the same number of pips as "virtual" Take Profit (TP)

If this SL/TP is more than 150 pips I use 150 pips

I put a Trailing Stop (TS) of 50 pips when i enter the trade.

(better safe than sorry, i hate to see my trade go +50 pips to finally hit my SL )

At half the TP i close half of the trade and let the other part run until it reach TS or...

When it reach TP i change my TS to 25 pips and let it run until it close by itself.

Also I do not care much about the stoch level as soon as it is in the same way as the trade

I use MT4 alerts to know when Half TP or TP is reached.

For the moment it has been working quite good:

Today I entered a buy for

GBPCHF       GBPJPY       AUDJPY       CADJPY

One of these wasn't a valid AshFx signal (AUDJPY i think)  but I realised that too late.

GBPCHF +2 (hit TS)

GBPJPY +28 (hit TS)

CADJPY closed half at +57

Still running are

CADJPY part 2 down to +45 for now

AUDJPY +26

Hope this helps...

I have a signal on EURJPY on FXDD chart. What do you think about?

--- 帖子 #1477 ---
no go, AO is still red?

--- 帖子 #1478 ---
Thanks so very very much. Indeed, exit is a very important lesson.
Do you set TS manually or automatically? And,
How do you set alert on MT4? As you said,I use MT4 alerts to know when Half TP or TP is reached.

Thanks, again.

--- 帖子 #1479 ---
Highlight market watch and view the symbols of currency pairs. Right click on any of the pairs and select SHOW ALL.

I hope you understand what I mean. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #1480 ---
Yes, you are right!!!

--- 帖子 #1481 ---
I see one CAD/CHF (Buy) Signal for sunday, anyone can confirm that ?

No CADCHF cross on FXDD platform...

Hi Guys

How can i configure slow stochastic for the period 5 , 7, 13?

Thanks

Julio Bento

--- 帖子 #1484 ---
If you do not see the pair after following Safive's advice.

Not all brokers have the same pairs. For example IBFX does not have that pair.

--- 帖子 #1485 ---
You can change the settings on the parameter's tab in the Stoch's property box. You can bring up the properties box several ways. One way would be to right mouse click on your chart and select 'indicators list' from the drop down menu. Select the Stochastic Oscillator  from the indicators list and press edit. You can also change the setting when you attach an indicator to the chart or sometimes by right clicking on the indicator.

--- 帖子 #1486 ---
Thanks very much

But what i went to now is how can i find indicator Slow stochastic in metatrader

Thanks

Julio

--- 帖子 #1487 ---
Go to MT4 trading station, find Indicators folder (under Accounts), open it.

Find Scochastic Oscillator, double click it, set your numbers on it, it will attach itself to the chart window.

Very easy, so good luck!

Oh! you want to be able to tell which is indicator Slow stochastic:

(Check it out, I hope this one is going to help you.)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_oscillator

--- 帖子 #1488 ---
Also note that the indicator is set to slowing by default so all u need do is alter the periods in the parameter tab.Click ok and your are done.

Hope it works for you

--- 帖子 #1489 ---
Except for EURJPY (which is an SS trade)i dont see any trades for next week.

What's your take guys???

--- 帖子 #1490 ---
Right.

Does anyone still have EURGBP trade opened in the market?

(Remember that we opened this trade on July 16 at market open.)

--- 帖子 #1491 ---
I had personally close the EURGBP short trade since on the 16th with about 12+ pips..

--- 帖子 #1492 ---
Hi,

I am still in and i intend to stick to the system rules no matter what, as i have jumped out before.

The thing is if we dont stick to the system how do we know that it works unless you use it for signal entries, which is fine

Thanks

Paul

--- 帖子 #1493 ---
Great! Count me in.

--- 帖子 #1494 ---
I saw some traders in OzFx are in AshFX Daily as well.

Can anyone update for me what is the main focus of this thread OzFx? Trading rules, and so on. They are almost 10,000 messages already, you know. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1495 ---
The very first post in the OzFX thread gives you all the rules.

--- 帖子 #1496 ---
yes got it and done

--- 帖子 #1497 ---
Good to see your doing well. I haven't really incorporated a Trailing Stop into the system officially, but it's something I'm looking into. Appreciate the update.

--- 帖子 #1498 ---
Hi Ron,

Are you here around?

Can you come up with a simple script for us to set the TS (Trailing Stop) on each pair? For sometimes, it is midnight when the first half TP closed.

--- 帖子 #1499 ---
Right click on the trade

Click Trailing Stop

Set the trailling stop...

Or use the trailing stop function in my EAs.

If you want an independent trailing stop EA: http://www.forexfactory.com/images/attach/zip.gif Swiss Army EA's.zip

--- 帖子 #1500 ---
hello, the GBPCHF has a resistance, doesnt it?

--- 帖子 #1501 ---
Why the GBPCHF trade??? Its the 2nd PSAR running already...On what basis please???

--- 帖子 #1502 ---
Thanks much, Ron.

But to be honest with you, both EAs for Ashly system you gave me before doesn't have TS input in it.

Maybe that was a wrong version, and the name is AskFX and AskFX_Entry_Only. (Ask is close enough to Ash,  )

Not sure if I got the right one or not?

--- 帖子 #1503 ---
Yes,the "Ask" part was a typo

AskFX_Entry_Only should have a trailing stop function built in. If you don't see it, go into the code, and add "extern" next to a line without "extern" next to it. All the extern variables are placed together at the top of the code and should be easy enough to find.

--- 帖子 #1504 ---
Hi mates,The house is quiet unusually. We are very close to the start of another trading week. What are the trades for monday. I am yet to search but I am sure there might be one or two. Ash and all, what sayeth thou?

--- 帖子 #1505 ---
Doesn't look like any possibilities to me!

--- 帖子 #1506 ---
I also do not see any possible trades. Iam just going to be patient to see what devlops this week.

--- 帖子 #1507 ---
I take that back, for anyone using IBFX there is a long signal on NZD/JPY. I may not take it, because it has been ranging lately. I attached a picture of the chart, Iam not sure if it will come through, this is the first time I am trying to post with a picture.

--- 帖子 #1508 ---
Interesting. I implemented MTABONEWEB's EA today on all the pairs in FXDD to see how it worked and whether it would be any use to me. It has initiated trades for EUR/JPY and CHF/JPY (both long). I had eyeballed these earlier and rejected them because they both had AO at red and stochs above 50. Those 2 in combination I thought would make the trades invalid.

So, it will be interesting to see how they go!

--- 帖子 #1509 ---
The scenario you're describing (Stoch above 50 and the AO not necessarily conforming) fits in the definition of an AshFX SS trade, so those would be valid trades for the EA.

--- 帖子 #1510 ---
I think you are correct. I suppose I just put my own spin on the rules and thought the two in combination may be a no no.

Not sure I would have taken either of these trades live as both look to be in consolidation after an upwards trend.

--- 帖子 #1511 ---
If you're trading manually instead of using an EA, I agree with you completely. I passed on both trades due to the strong resistance.

Both currencies are also at or near all-time highs, so neither seemed to be a great trade opportunity IMO.

--- 帖子 #1512 ---
They were both SS trades but you can also set TakeSSTrades to false and it wont trade SS signals.

--- 帖子 #1513 ---
I perfectly agree with you yen44x

--- 帖子 #1514 ---
Guys I'm not in anything today (with AshFX Daily).

--- 帖子 #1515 ---
Ash, what did you think about the two trades initiated by the EA (EUR/JPY and CHF/JPY)? They were considered second strength due to AO being red AND the stochs being above 50. Can these still be considered as second strength given those two factors?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1516 ---
Aren't we reviewing any trades today??

I can only see USDJPY(Canlde still red and Stoch above 50) and maybe EURCHF (Stoch crossed 50 and AO still red )both as Long SS trades.

What are your opinions too????????

--- 帖子 #1517 ---
Still holding EUR/GBP from 07/16, don't quite feel it is a winning trade at the end.

Now, it's -20 pips on each position.

--- 帖子 #1518 ---
2 more hours for the new daily candle

--- 帖子 #1519 ---
Mind to share?

Anyone still holding this pair?

--- 帖子 #1520 ---
Me too, looks like we have to watch it hit stop loss soon

Paul

--- 帖子 #1521 ---
USD/JPY - stoch currently sitting above 84 with signal at 64. Unless something changes in the next hour or so I guess this trade would be invalid.

Doesn't appear to be anything else setting up.

--- 帖子 #1522 ---
I think NZDUSD is in good position to trade. Certainly LONG

--- 帖子 #1523 ---
Hi Ventor,

Thats a 1H chart. Be carefull.

Juan Carlos

--- 帖子 #1524 ---
Any other trade?

--- 帖子 #1525 ---
You are right ! I'm tired

--- 帖子 #1526 ---
Basically, I think that this pair: EUR/GBP is crazy and undecisive, it is not quite sure where to go, up or down?

--- 帖子 #1527 ---
You are sooooo right, it's doing my head in, i know if i pull out it will go down but if i stay with it it will go up

Something about murphys law, i am sticking with it - do or die i say

Paul

--- 帖子 #1528 ---
You funny, even I lost money I am happy here!

--- 帖子 #1529 ---
Paul,

The truth is that I only pick up the FS to trade, not even give it a chance to the SS trades. Why we are still stopped out by the S/L, like AUD/JPY stopped out on 07/17, like this pair: EUR/GBP who knows?

The reason I figured out is, we are trading against the trend, both pairs are above 200 SMA, and we are in Sell trading.

I just received a good advice from yen44, target a smaller TP for this kind of trades (when trading against the trend).

Hope this will help us all.

--- 帖子 #1530 ---
Hi,

Yes i agree, only go for Full Strength trades, watch the 200 sma, and even then go for T/P at low or high of nearest candle. or the swing low or high if its close to entry that is

If you look at Eur/GB, we entered on 16/7 and the nearest low was on candle of 7/7, if i would have done that it shows the candle of 16/7 hit the low of same candle on 7/7

Now i know what i am going to do in future, you know my father always said ( bless his cotton socks) that the only way to gain experience is to lose hard earned money or worse still get a smack in the face with a cold wet fish, you never forget that feeling - although so far have not had an experience with a cold wet fish yet and dont intend to

i think todays candle is going to hit 0.7976 0.7986 and the stochs are crossing up

Paul

--- 帖子 #1531 ---
Is that right? It may be a good way to TP. Thanks for sharing!

--- 帖子 #1532 ---
Hi Ash thanks for this great contribution. It really helps me a lot because I'm still new on forex.

I have a question for you, which do you prefer in taking profits: Set your TP as the same to your SL or wait for AO to change into opposite color. Please give your insights. Thanks

Cheers,

Vanz

--- 帖子 #1533 ---
same question here.

--- 帖子 #1534 ---
Hi I'm still new at this stuff. May I know the dangers that 1H chart pose. Which TF do you usually use?

--- 帖子 #1535 ---
Its is callled daily(hint) there is a PDF. The first post of threads usually contain the system specifics. There sometimes are PDF's or word doc's summarizing. Hope it helps. Good Luck.

All the signals for this system depend on a series of indicators in agreement on the daily chart(ONLY)

There is a similiar system for multiple time frames called Pipnailer as well and a thread.

--- 帖子 #1536 ---
Got this new alerts maybe someone could check..

--- 帖子 #1537 ---
me too..

Confirmed

--- 帖子 #1538 ---
I use both for AshFX Daily.  Close half position on each of the TPs.

--- 帖子 #1539 ---
Hey Ash what is your take on the USDCAD trade setup??

--- 帖子 #1540 ---
Ash, we are waiting for tonights alerts? Thanks.

Personally I dont see any signal.

Juan Carlos

--- 帖子 #1541 ---
Personally the USDCAD IMHO looks ok...except that the candle might be a lil bit long...

--- 帖子 #1542 ---
Best setup tonight for me is USD/CAD...

--- 帖子 #1543 ---
... by the way EUR/GBP has turned in profit. need to be patient on this one, but stick to the rules and it will be good.

--- 帖子 #1544 ---
punggi wat are you going in at for USDCAD??

--- 帖子 #1545 ---
already in @ 1.0089...(still on DEMO-Account) because swap is positive, otherwise i would entered in 5 minutes..

--- 帖子 #1546 ---
EUR/USD appears to meet the AshFX criteria for a Short trade.

--- 帖子 #1547 ---
i think stoch has crossed below already....IMHO though

--- 帖子 #1548 ---
It has crossed below 50, so it would be an SS trade.

--- 帖子 #1549 ---
Yeah i know but i just seem to always prefer FS trades ...

--- 帖子 #1550 ---
I am in...seems to be a nice short trade!

Ash, what do you think?

--- 帖子 #1551 ---
Darn, my friend, I'll try to do a better job of remembering your preferences in the future.

--- 帖子 #1552 ---
yen; lets see how it goes

--- 帖子 #1553 ---
I'm just having fun, femzy; it wasn't meant to be a challenge.

I don't want to hang my manhood on this one trade.Actually, I don't want to hang my manhood anywhere . . . too many laws against that sort of thing.

--- 帖子 #1554 ---
me too either yen44x lol

--- 帖子 #1555 ---
USDCAD & EURUSD looking good

Maybe i should have taken the EURUSD trade...

--- 帖子 #1556 ---
yen44x u surely beat me to this one...

--- 帖子 #1557 ---
EU trade hit tp(50)

second lot running 8+

--- 帖子 #1558 ---
USDCAD 33+

--- 帖子 #1559 ---
Hi,

Presumably you use a different strategy for TP. The first TP for AshFx daily for this trade would be 157 pips not 50.

--- 帖子 #1560 ---
You are correct edeyj999;i dont use Ash's MM.I just simply take my profit in 50s

--- 帖子 #1561 ---
Hi Ash,

Apologies to you, i feel really bad

This system really works, i was downhearted on the Eur/Gbp trade as it was talnk sooo lond to drop and then it was going up, wow i was wondering if i was going to make any money, but now its hit first T/P and i have now commited myself to this system and will never ever run it down again

Just one thought that i have been struggling with lately, the 200 sma, do you take it into account when you look at trades because it does put me off when i am going short and the signal is above the 200 sma

One word from you, yes or no, and i will take it off my charts and not have sleepless nights anymore

Thanks

This must come from Oz´s system .

Hello, i am new here and i live in Germany (-> reason for my bad english). I m a trader beginner and i was one of the happy "signal receiver" from Oz. I hope it´s ok if i speak here about this, Ash.

When i wanted to start with real money, he went "exclusive"

So i was looking for another trader giving free signals and found Ash.

I haven´t learned Oz method, because i m working a lot.

Ash´s method is better described with pictures and so.

What i wanted to ask:

There are surely people who tried both.
can somebody tell which are the differences, are they similar? is one better than the other?
I have heard that Oz signals are not so succesfull anymore. The paying people are not happy

--- 帖子 #1563 ---
Hi Trader, sorry for the late answer

I set my TS automatically on MT4 :

Right click on the trade then you'll see "trailing stop"

For Alerts click on the "alert" tab a the bottom of MT4

Then right click anywhere , then "create". The rest is self explanatory.

--- 帖子 #1564 ---
So, what happened to Ash yesterday?

No one makes calls on this thread anymore?

Can we have a small group of people (at least 3) that will go through each chart everyday market open time (FXDD) and post the FS/SS pairs?

This is in order to provide a good assistance to Ash, so these people needs to be consistant and responsible.

People who wants to be in this group, just:

1. type in Title line: Post on (market date & time)
2. must type FF/SS/None in Message.

Please give it a try, everyone, you will like it!

--- 帖子 #1565 ---
As for me i would recommend you try this system for a while then you can judge yourself.A system could work and still not fit your trading style.

But in my own opinion; this sytem works way better than OZs.

--- 帖子 #1566 ---
funny enuf i hv just started trading this method on my live account and that is when people stopped....

I just thank God that i hv gained so far....Except that i try to back out with whatever profit i have when important news events arise.

--- 帖子 #1567 ---
AshFX is not derived from OzFx system.They are 'cousins' if you will. They both apply bill williams-type indicators.

Oz signals used to catch moderate 10-20 bar market swings. The thing is those same market swings last 3-10 bars. That why a lot of people are suddenly not making money with the system. They don't understand that the market changed.

I see the first TP is right on the fib 50 and also the swing low

once 1st  TP is met will you tighten up the SL on the 2nd lot

untill it clears that support

Has the PSAR changed on your AUD/CAD chart, femzy? It hasn't on mine yet, although it's looking like it could any day now.

--- 帖子 #1576 ---
Using the 200 SMA is something I would like to test. It is possible / probable that the system might work even better with the 200SMA.

If you do use it, i'd appreciate it if you can keep us updated.

Thanks.

Ash

--- 帖子 #1577 ---
Lol, soz dude. I have mentioned before that I can't be here posting signals every evening.  I will try to as often as I can, but I trust that people on this thread will continue to inform each other as well.

--- 帖子 #1578 ---
yen44x it has changed on mine (Alpari)

--- 帖子 #1579 ---
Ash you really need to put more input to this thread ; you started it; i think you should always be the one to finish because we see you as a leader and the teacher of this system.

So simple it might be but its obvious you have the better experience using this system

--- 帖子 #1580 ---
Lol, just to clarify guys, RR is referring to the SYSTEMs, not the two individuals being "cousins".

The difference is Oz's system isn't working any more and mine is.

--- 帖子 #1581 ---
I disagree. This is a pretty straightforward system . . . it's either a signal or it's not, there's either strong S & R or there's not, etc., so it shouldn't require spoon feeding from the thread author on a daily basis.

Ash laid out the rules in the very first post, so a trader should be able to hit the ground running with this system and see how it goes. It either works or it doesn't.

Oz made the mistake of developing groupies who never tried to learn the system, instead depending on him for months on end to tell them what to trade. Even babies get weaned eventually. Traders need to learn to trade.

Just my 2 pips worth.

--- 帖子 #1582 ---
I'm smarter than my cousin too.

Oh wait, you said you and Oz weren't actually cousins.

--- 帖子 #1583 ---
Good idea, if we all do it then we will have a majority decision to either do or not do a trade and then nobody can moan when it goes bad

Lets call it the ASHFX Democratic System, at least 10 have to post and the majority wins

Bring it on

i'm testing this strategies and am seeing good results..

just wondering normally when we have a good signal & open a position how many days roughly are we looking at before we exit? i mean how long does the trend last if i may say... before we close the position & reopen another one in opposite dir? ... from what i have been seeing it looks like once in.. u stay in for atleast 4-5 days (i'm not complaining though) which does produce good results....

second thing, if you wanted to run a back test, is there a way to do this automatically in MT4? i'm using IBFX demo.

thx,

Pret

--- 帖子 #1588 ---
What happens if it's a tie?

--- 帖子 #1589 ---
Then there's no majority =D

--- 帖子 #1590 ---
Exactly.

With that in mind, I think I'll stick to your EA or my own decisions. I don't want to blame or credit anyone else at the end of a trade.

--- 帖子 #1591 ---
Why would anyone need signals called for them?

The rules are pretty straightforward.....a trade is either signaled or it isn't.

There are other factors that may influence your decision to trade... S/R, pivots, moon phase, the price of tea in China, etc. But if you are simply following the system to the letter, the EA's do fine.

--- 帖子 #1592 ---
All right, orion70, who gave you my trading secret??!!

Drat . . . I thought I was the only one making trade decisions based on the price of tea in China.

Actually, I look at both the price of tea and rice. If prices look like they will go up, I trade "ooLONG". If they appear to be headed down, I trade "SHORT" grain.

Ouch, I can't believe I wrote that. Off to siesta.

--- 帖子 #1601 ---
yeah Dolphin ;

i was thinking of staying out of the trade because of that and i watch out so as not to take trades which are affected by the news calender too.

--- 帖子 #1602 ---
I'm inclined to take this trade and just set my first TP at the trend line, especially if it retraces a little more.

--- 帖子 #1603 ---
I have to leave the house prior to the new Daily candle, but I will be taking the aud/usd short. I'm hoping the previous support area will win out over the trend line, but we'll see.

Update on trades from yesterday:

eur/usd short: 1 lot closed at +100; 1 lot now at +93

usd/cad long: 2 lots at +19

The eur/usd TP was not per AshFX rules. I was already in another eur/usd short trade using discretionary trading, and that trade was already up 100+ pips when the AshFX signal came, so I decided to reduce the TP on the AshFX trade.

--- 帖子 #1604 ---
AUD/USD has to turn back round at some point, just don't think this time is it!

In addition the Stochs are decelerating.

AUD/USD Short Trade Update:

I closed my first lot on this Short trade at 45 pips. That's not much, but this was a real counter-trend trade. You can also see in the attachment that price had just hit the trend line, which also happened to be just below the 50% fib line. Anyway, all that was enough to keep me content with a reasonable target, and hopefully the second lot will head down to the support line.

--- 帖子 #1616 ---
Oh ok, got ya. Didn't realise you were talking about Alpari.

--- 帖子 #1617 ---
cool, i think you gain very fast an overview

--- 帖子 #1618 ---
I guess I did drew my trend line incorrectly because I had it at .9566. I'm now at 40 pips and I think I will join you on the first lot. Nice to see that you migrated over here from OzFX. I'm finding this system to be much more consistent. Let me throw something out there for comment. What would you think if you always took the first PSar in the appropriate direction (it seems to me you would win many more times then not). Close this position out just before the start of the new candle, then followed Ash rules with the issue of the second Candle.

--- 帖子 #1619 ---
Your trend line may very well have been correct. It was around 2 am in the morning when I closed that first lot, and I was definitely ready for bed, so my eyes may have been playing some tricks on me.

At any rate, it appears that aud/usd has dipped some more in the last few minutes, so your first lot may be closing any minute now depending on your target. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #1620 ---
USD/CAD Trade Update:

I just closed my first lot on the usd/cad long trade at +50 pips. The actual AshFX TP rules would have called for 88 pips as an initial target, but I guess I developed the habit of banking 50 pips after several months on the OzFX thread.

Here's a summary of all my open trades:

aud/usd short: 1 lot closed at +45; 2nd lot at +68

usd/cad long: 1 lot closed at +50; 2nd lot at +58

eur/usd short: 1 lot closed at +100; 2nd lot at +129

So far, so good.

Hi all.

I have been reading this thread for a while now and must say how impressed i am by the work done and the results achieved. I would also confess however that i could not read the entire stuff, but would desperately need clarification on a certain point. Please don't send a reply asking me to 'read post .....' Please.

Ash insists that entry must only be done after the first valid signal has closed, ie, after we find a new Psar on the reverse side of a trend, supported by the right colors for both AC and AO, right? I really would like to know why this must be so. In doing a visual backtest, i find that everytime the Psar appears on the reverse side of an existing trend, at the open of a new daily candle, and both AO, AC and Stoch are in allignment, that candle usually goes in the expected direction for a good number of pips. So, why can't we enter in at the begining of that candle? Or does a sort of "re-painting" occur that makes visual backtests look so beautiful and immediate entry risky?

I'd be glad if someone can help me here. I'm trying to demo this idea, but would like to hear from the more experienced. I may not need to bother after that.

Thanks.

Yen,

Remember me??

Who could forget the one and only creator of the Sonic System!

Good to hear from you. How goes the trading?

--- 帖子 #1624 ---
Remember that all indicators' values are based on the price. As the current bar's price is constantly changing, so is the value of the indicator for that bar. What you see in visual backtesting is the final value of the indicator at the close of a bar, you don't know what that indicator looked like at the start of the bar.

--- 帖子 #1625 ---
I remembered your gr8 help in Oz thread when I am starting out the system...

and Ronald too, for helping me the first EA....

Now..Am thinking of setting up my system in "system session"...rather than jornal session!!!

to bring in more crowd...and coders too...

so that, the signal and EA coding can be improved...

what do ya guys think??

sonic

--- 帖子 #1626 ---
Ah, Thanks man. What would we do without the guidiance of the experienced? Thanks again man.

--- 帖子 #1627 ---
RR gave you a good idea of why you need to wait until the candle is complete to determine where the PSAR dot will stay for sure.

In regard to why it may be better to wait and follow the AshFX rules, the idea of a system like this is to allow you to get into the “meat” of a trend, that is, when the trend has picked up some steam and you can still enjoy some good returns.

A number of other trading systems will try to identify the breakout of a trend right from the start, but you will probably find that your win/loss percentage is much lower on systems like that. It’s easy to look back at AshFX signals and say “I could have gotten even more pips”, but you will generally find that your trade signals are more reliable and profitable on a system like this.

--- 帖子 #1628 ---
Man, Sonic, I love trading, but I am totally challenged when it comes to "tech talk". I have no idea what a "system session" or a "journal session" is, but I'm sure it will have Ronald all excited.

I'll let you guys do all the heavy lifting and then just dumb it down for me. Then, I'll claim it was my idea all along.

--- 帖子 #1629 ---
Sure did.

ok, today i got these two alerts both pointing down..

AUDCAD

GBPUSD

--- 帖子 #1631 ---
AUDCAD is going in the wrong direction right now, so I think this one we could exclude easely

--- 帖子 #1632 ---
yeah punggi i would advice you not to go with the AUDCAD trade.Even the candle is looking so suspicious

--- 帖子 #1633 ---
Wrong coloured candle at the moment for a short. Also looks to be bouncing off the upward trendline to me.

--- 帖子 #1634 ---
Second strength trade possible. Any thoughts anyone?

--- 帖子 #1635 ---
I'm going to pass on gbp/usd for four reasons:

1. Price backed off the trend line and failed to close below it.

2. As a Second Strength trade, it would require a large stop loss for a currency pair that has been pretty indecisive lately.

3. The 3 trades I did take this week all did well, so there's not much inclination to add an "iffy" trade.

4. I want a 3-day weekend, so I'm off in search of a cold Cerveza Pacifico.

Hi,

Hope thats a demo trade as YEN said, it's bounced off its trend line and you would really wnat to see the candle close below the trend line PLUS 3 important news announcements tomorrow

--- 帖子 #1638 ---
Thank you Paul and Yen for your advice.

Everyone who is playing LIVE with this should pay attention, for me i still on demo, need to "feel" the whole thing.

--- 帖子 #1639 ---
I may still be confused on this point, but I thought the last swing high was actually the 7/15 candle with a high of 2.0156, which would make for an even more challenging R:R ratio.

Either way, it's a HUGE stop loss, but good luck if you took the trade!

--- 帖子 #1640 ---
Hello all, I have been lurking around this forum for quite  some time now.  I have tried many "systems" on demo accounts with very little luck.  In fact, no luck.  When I stumbled accross this thread, I very quickly understood the rules and decided to give it a try.  I got in on the USD/CAD and have to say I am impressed so far.  I have all my charts up with the template and am patiently awaiting another signal.

In the past I have never really understood why a "system" would fail me because I thought I was following the rules.  This system seem so simple and so far I completely understand why some of these signals should not be taken (support and resistence, trend lines etc.)

I would like to thank you so much for sharing this strategy and thank everyone who is so helpful in ensuring the rest of us understand.

--- 帖子 #1644 ---
Well, those are all valid points, and I hope you score some major pips. Then, you can buy me that beer that I wanted more than this trade. Deal?

--- 帖子 #1645 ---
So if this candle were to close well below that trendline, would anyone consider taking the signal?  Or is the stoch too close to 20?

Just trying to learn...........thanks

Larry

--- 帖子 #1646 ---
I probably still wouldn't have taken this trade personally, but the stoch being too close to 20 wouldn't have been the deciding factor. If a short trade such as this really gets moving, it can stay around or below 20 for days and still be a very profitable trade.

Since I live in Mexico, I'll use usd/mxn as an example if you have that on your charts. The stoch been below 20 for days, and yet price has continued to free fall, which means my U.S. dollars are buying less and less here every day.

--- 帖子 #1647 ---
I guess the smart thing to do would be to wait for the buy signal and follow the trend instead of hope it will continue down against the trendline. I don't have usd/mxn on my platform but I see what your saying.

--- 帖子 #1648 ---
Hi,  Check what has happened to this chart since 15 july when it has bounced around the 200 sma Because its been bouncing around the 200 sma IMO i would wait until the GB - GDP comea out tomorrow at 9.30 gmt, if thats good then GB will spike up, markets are spiking recently on good or bad news due to volatile traders Then the Core Durable goods & New home sales are dua at 1.30 & 3.30pm gmt, again USA volatile so could see spikes either way I am not knocking your expertise or trade, i just think taht it being a friday tomorrow and 3 bits of news coming out its not worth trading

There will be plenty other days to trade

BUT if you are right come back to me tomorrow and i will buy you a beer also and publically apologise on this site

Paul

--- 帖子 #1649 ---
Paul, let's not even wait until the end of this trade . . . I'll buy you a beer if you buy me one, ok?

Hi pbalfe@tisca

I see this as all of us trying to learn together

Ash states that he does not pay much attention   to news due to daily charts

if you look at a bigger picture (bring up about a year on the daily)

and you will see a 200sma curving down in decline there will be a spike on news but with the big S/L because this is a SS trade

we hope to ride it out.

just my thoughts

but keeping a lookout for a uk exporter to Mexico

--- 帖子 #1652 ---
If you'd like an update to the EA I wrote you can find it here along with revision notes.

--- 帖子 #1653 ---
If you need the exporter just to deliver my beer after you collect your profits, DHL delivers straight from the UK to my door. I hate to be picky, but please have them keep it refrigerated . . . none of those warm suds you're famous for over there if you please.

--- 帖子 #1654 ---
Lol, you guys crack me up.

--- 帖子 #1655 ---
I say old chap we have have some of the finest real ales in the world

complete with suds. Anyway I would just send back your own Cerveza

all they do with it here is stick a piece of lemon in the neck of the bottle

and charge you £3.50 hehehe.

GBP/USD still unable to break that trend line

--- 帖子 #1656 ---
USDCAD is still running +100 pips just now

--- 帖子 #1657 ---
The UK may indeed have some of the finest ales in the world, but the refrigerator was invented over 100 years ago! On a hot summer day, there's nothing like a COLD cerveza. On the other hand, I just watched the British Open (brrr!), so perhaps you don't have many hot summer days, eh?

Before you ship my cerveza back home, try it with a lime. Using a lemon must be another British custom. Once you try a lime, you'll be asking for more cervezas.

Now, finally, on to business. In regard to GBP/USD, take a look at the candles over the last several days. This pair has been alternating red and green candles since the 15th . . . just totally indecisive at this point.

One thing I did notice this morning, though, is the ascending channel . . . higher highs, higher lows. It will be interesting to see what happens when this pair finally makes up its mind.

In the meantime, blackdog, stick that cerveza in the fridge, run to the store and get a fresh lime, wait 3 hours, drink that cerveza COLD with the lime added and you'll be telling me in fluent Spanish . . . "mas cerveza, mi amigo, gracias."

--- 帖子 #1658 ---
This has turned into a nice trade.  I'm also just over 100 pips at this point.

USD/CAD just climbed to a trend line also today. I'll be curious to see if this pair can muscle past it before day's end or early next week. If so, we may be good for another 50 pips or so up to the next resistance area.

--- 帖子 #1659 ---
You were spot on with your call for GBP/USD YEN44X - well done.

You know the old saying . . . "even a blind squirrel finds an acorn once in a while". I had a 50/50 chance of being right, and the coin came up heads. Lucky for me.

A good weekend to everyone and then get your coins out on Monday . . . there's trade decisions to be made.

--- 帖子 #1661 ---
That's what I get for mixing metaphors . . . it just occurred to me that a blind squirrel wouldn't have any idea whether the coin came up heads or tails .

Regardless, have a good weekend.

Doing based on Daily or H4 TF??

--- 帖子 #1663 ---
Well, full-time in the sense that I don't do much else here in Mexico, other than sightseeing and enjoying the area and doing volunteer work. But, it's not my sole source of income if that's what you're asking. Did you forget I left the U.S. after robbing all those banks? Of course, if I had known what was going to happen to the U.S. dollar, I would have demanded euros.

Right now, I'm taking a look at trades with the AshFX Daily charts. However, much like I did with OzFX, if the Daily trades show promise, I will also take a good look at 4H chart trades.

Keep up the good work

--- 帖子 #1669 ---
You speak Spanish Yen?

--- 帖子 #1670 ---
I'm actually a U.S. expatriate living in Guanajuato, Mexico. I speak passable Spanish, but I'm far from fluent. Any attempts, though, to speak Spanish here are warmly received by the residents, so I'm slowly adding to the vocabulary.

Thanks for taking the time to create this thread. I was a wholehearted supporter of the OzFX system and did really well with it for several months, but things seemed to change overnight and the results became much more hit and miss.

As Ronald Raygun noted, for those of us who traded OzFX, your system seems somewhat like a "cousin". There's some definite similarities, but I like the additional safeguards built into AshFX to prevent getting into questionable trades. And, you've been honest enough to stress the need to take a good look at S & R before entering a trade, which will help traders to actually learn to trade instead of blindly following every signal. Your suggested MM, in my opinion, is also a vast improvement over the OzFX system.

So far, I've been very impressed with the AshFX system, so thanks again, or perhaps I should say "Muchisimas gracias. Lo agredezco.

Hi Everyone,

Looks like EUR/CAD is set up for a long albeit the stochs just push it into a second strength trade. Nearest resistance looks to be at approx 1.6180 and the current price is 1.6004.

Any thoughts anyone?

--- 帖子 #1676 ---
Im with you on this one. It has ranged a little bit lately but overall in a strong uptrend. I have my initial TP set at +103 pips and like you said the next resistance level is 1.6180 so there is plenty room to hit the target.

--- 帖子 #1677 ---
Just thought I'd offer what I'm seeing on this pair. . .

As you can see the EA has taken the long position. That aside, I'd just like to point out what I see as a possible resistance level that one might consider on this trade if it was being considered for a manual trade.

By applying trendlines for the month of July I am seeing that we are at the top the of the most recent trend down, indicating to go short not long.

I think that this pair may see some upside here or maybe even a break out to the upside but IMHO more likely will be a continued downtrend.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I just want to offer another angle to look at when considering S/R

--- 帖子 #1678 ---
I am fairly new to the forum.  I don't have eur/cad on my platform.  I am using alpari.  Is there another one I can use to see more pairs?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1679 ---
Not all that bright here, I figured it out.

--- 帖子 #1680 ---
Thanks for your perspective on this trade. Here is what I was looking at on this trade. I took the trade at 1.6004. I like seeing two different angles on this, thats why I joined this forum. Hopefully, it will see enough upside to hit the initial profit target so I can close 1 and move to break even on the other.

--- 帖子 #1681 ---
I think that both perspectives hold some value. . . the only difference may be the time frame involved. For instance your trendline is drawn back to May and mine is only July. The funny thing is, over some time both analysis may prove to be winners at some point. With gives rise to the argument that it may not be so much the entries that matter the most but rather the exits.

Best of luck on your trade whether demo or live

--- 帖子 #1682 ---
I agree with you 100%, this is why trading forex becomes complex at certain times, its not necessarily when you get in, but rather when you get out. I look forward to seeing more analysis on trades to come.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1687 ---
This may change before the new daily candle, but right now the stoch is too low (18 on the FXDD chart) for cad/jpy to be a valid AshFX signal.

--- 帖子 #1688 ---
Hit TP1 beautifully after breaking out of the channel. I'm glad the ea took that for me cause I probably would have talked myself out of it!

--- 帖子 #1689 ---
The eur/cad long proved to be a great signal. I've got one lot closed and the second lot is currently up 117 pips on that trade.

Another signal that is still moving nicely is the usd/cad long from 7/23. The first lot closed and the second is up 159 pips. We're now in a previous resistance area (around 1.0240). If price can punch through that, we could be good for another 75 pips or so up to the next resistance area of 1.0320. A very nice trade indeed.

--- 帖子 #1690 ---
stoch is slow but IMHO i feel its still looking good for an SS trade;i might not look back at it if it comes out valid.

--- 帖子 #1691 ---
You very well may be right, femzy. The stoch could stay below 20 for days and you could still have a very nice trade going. I just wanted to note the stoch reading for those who may just be joining the thread and wondering about whether this trade would conform exactly to AshFX system rules.

--- 帖子 #1692 ---
Hi.

Is there anyone who took the GBP/USD of Friday July 25th on Alpari UK? Accoerding to the rules that was supposed to be the signal, but as it is, i am still on negative, more than two days after, though it hasn't hit stoploss yet. or did i do something wrong?

Advice anyone?

Ok. Another thing; what are the loopholes to avoid when playing by the rules of this system? I have only read the success stories; any losses?

--- 帖子 #1693 ---
i tot we all agreed to stay out of the trade basically cos of the the news attached to that day.That pair really went wild that day.

--- 帖子 #1694 ---
There were a number of posts regarding this signal starting at #1634. Some took this trade; I personally did not and posted my reasons at the time, so take a look back at those posts.

The loophole would be blindly following every signal. Ash has stated, and every trader should know, that S & R is king. It can't be ignored when you're considering whether or not to take a signal. I also look at trend lines and how price reacts around them, as I noted in the post regarding the gpb/usd trade you asked about.

--- 帖子 #1695 ---
hmmmm; what more can one say

U said it all pal

--- 帖子 #1696 ---
I'm not sure which trade you're referring to, my friend, but I personally never make a group decision on a trade. I want only myself to blame if I'm wrong.

--- 帖子 #1697 ---
On the other hand, if you make some great trading decisions and end up getting rich, here's some investment advice I received today:

"Here's a little retirement info for you: If you had purchased $1,000.00 of Delta Air Lines stock one year ago, you would have $49.00 left.

With Enron, you'd have had $16.50 left of the original $1, 000.00.

With WorldCom, you'd have had less than $5.00 left.

But... if you had purchased $1,000.00 worth of beer, one year ago,drank all the beer and then turned in the cans for the aluminum recycling REFUND, you'd have $214.00.

Based on the above, the best current investment advice is to drink heavily and recycle. It's called the 401-Keg."

The ironic part is I actually drink a beer maybe once a month at most. For some reason, I enjoy posting about it much more than actually drinking.

Well, getting the drugs across the border can be tricky at times, but otherwise it's great.Oh-oh, I'm in enough hot water over the beer posts . . . now I've crossed the line. I assure one and all I'm not actually a drug runner.

This part of Mexico is awesome. Guanajuato was named a United Nations World Heritage City in recognition of its uniqueness and history. It's a beautiful city with warmhearted, hospitable residents. If you or anyone is ever thinking of a trip to Mexico, by all means include this area in your plans. You won't be disappointed.

I totally agree with you Ash on the mm of OZ.I remembered many of us didn't agree with it back then but even the aside that the system takes alot of false trades.Or maybe the market has really changed as some suppose.Trading systems might change but the trader must not change.

Anyone up for the CAD/JPY SS trade?

Stochs perilously close to 20, however may be enough distance before resistance at the upward trendline.

(Sorry, need to work out how to embed an image of the chart!)

--- 帖子 #1711 ---
For those of you who went long on the USD/CAD on the 23rd of July, then I would recommend you exit now, (even though the AO is still green). Why? There is strong resistance as can be seen.  Price has bounced off this area several times over the few months.

--- 帖子 #1712 ---
I actually shorted this at last night's market open.

Stochs are very close to 20. I think it will keep going down some more during this week, but not too sure if you'd get a good r:r return.

The current PSAR can change its position during the course of a trading day, which is why trading decisions are made when the daily candle is complete. Once a daily candle is complete, though, the PSAR dot remains as it was.

Agree with you not one perfect signal based on AsfX book.

But without risk, no gain! Agree ?

--- 帖子 #1729 ---
You got it.

--- 帖子 #1730 ---
Just to clarify: The signal to enter this trade was based on the PSAR, AC, AO, and stoch readings from the 7/28 candle that just closed. Based on those readings, you would have entered the trade at the start of the 7/29 candle that you noted. That's probably exactly what you meant by your question, but just to make sure.

I lived  in Guanajuato 30 years ago and studied in La Preparatoria de la Universidad. Really nice city.

--- 帖子 #1735 ---
Wow . . . it's a small world. I agree, it's a very nice city with some great people.

If you were here 30 years ago, we must be in the same age range, and therefore you have my sympathy.

In regard to the aud/cad chart, it appears you are not using FXDD charts, which is what the AshFX system rules recommends.

Take a look at the attached FXDD chart. The PSAR has not shifted yet, so it's definitely not a signal at this time.

Even if you choose to use the chart you attached, it appears that the AO is still red on the day that the PSAR shifted. So, again, that would not be a valid long signal per AshFX rules.

The other factor that would probably keep me out of this trade even if there were a valid signal is the significant resistance just above today's candle that has held for almost 7 weeks now.

--- 帖子 #1736 ---
Reconfigure your Parabolic SAR to (0.03, 0.2). Not (0.3, 0.2)

Very, very soon it would be a very nice LONG trade. I am sure it will be confirmed by AshFx_Daily.

What do you all think?

--- 帖子 #1737 ---
This is not a long trade I would take at current price levels for a couple of reasons:

1. Significant resistance at around 0.9840 that has held for the last few weeks. We both marked an uptrend line on our charts, but price action has definitely stalled at the resistance area.

2. This pair is at a record high. The Momentum indicator is not part of the AshFX system, but I do take a look at it, and we're clearly seeing evidence of reduced momentum on both Daily and Weekly charts.

The really nice long trade opportunities began several months ago at the start of 2008. Since then, price has climbed about 1200 pips. Now that I'm seeing a lot of resistance, I'm not sure I want to jump on a Long signal just in hopes that the pair will continue to climb.

The one factor that would probably cause me to enter this trade, and it would be based on technical trading rather than AshFX rules, would be if I saw a significant break of the resistance area. If that happened, I would look for a retrace back to the previous resistance area and then place a Long trade with a fairly tight stop loss assuming that this area would now become a support zone.

That's my take on how I would handle it. That's the great thing about trading. It's like looking at art . . . everyone has a slightly different perspective on what they're seeing. If a signal comes, and you decide to take the trade, good luck and I'll be cheering you on from the sidelines. On the other hand, if a valid short signal shows up soon on this pair, I'll be all over that. The retracement possibilities look sweet.

Has any one got an indicator that loads these to our charts

--- 帖子 #1739 ---
Here's some indicators for S & R, but be forewarned: I've never used this type of indicator, and don't know anything about how reliable they are. I find it easier to scan the charts quickly, but let me know if you find them helpful.

Check out the search function on FF for more info on this type of indicator. I found all these within a few minutes.

why "timezone based"?, isn´t a broker working for 24/5 (day and night)?

Is this Liteforex good for me who lives in central Europe?
Or would you advise me another one?
It must not be in my language, english is ok.My broker doesn´t have some pairs like CAD/JPY or CAD/CHF... unfortunately.
So i will open a account in another one.

Nice place here and good jobs from the people, especially the "expatriated" all day [fresh]beer drinker from Mexico and Ash of course.
I m happy to be here. Oz can get ... with his exclusive service.

PS: Bavarian beer (south Germany) belongs to the best of the world (i heard)

cheers!

Interesting point of view. Thanks yen44x to share your comments.

Un abrazo.

--- 帖子 #1742 ---
Thanks for those, will run and let you know how they preform

--- 帖子 #1743 ---
Same here. S/R indicators don't do it for me. My advice would be learn to draw them yourself. This way you can go back many months, being able to see multiple re-tests. This is a definite edge.

--- 帖子 #1744 ---
Hey blackdog . . . your gpb/usd short is looking MUCH better today, eh? Congrats to you.

And, lest I forget, a nice warm beer toast as well. I'll still stick to cold beer, thank you very much, but a toast nonetheless.

--- 帖子 #1745 ---
yen44x, whats your opinion about CADJPY short?

--- 帖子 #1746 ---
I took the trade because I thought it would at least make it to the current trend line. So far, I'm down about 50 pips on the trade, so we'll see.

--- 帖子 #1747 ---
I won’t be taking any new AshFX trades today, but here’s an update on my current trades:Eur/usd short: 1 lot closed at +100 pips; 2nd lot at +218 Usd/cad long: 1 lot closed at +50; 2nd lot is at +175 Cad/jpy short: 2 lots at -49 The eur/usd short opened on 7/23, and dipped very nicely today to over 200 pips profit. We’re now at about the 61 fib from the 6/13 candle, so I will tighten the stop loss, but if price can continue to move south we could head down another 250 pips or so to the strong support area around 1.5300.

The usd/cad long also opened on 7/23, and I’m 26 pips from my target of 1.0279. However, I’ve tightened the stop loss to 1.0229, so I’ve got 150 pips profit locked in for sure on this trade.

The cad/jpy short is the only trade not doing well, but I have hopes that it will make it down to the trend line before I close it out.

I’m up 92 pips on a technical-based short trade on eur/jpy, and it appears that will be an AshFX signal soon as well.

CLOSED TRADE:Eur/cad long: 1 lot at +50; 2nd lot at +1 All in all, a very good day for AshFX trades.

Alright, I'm off to the gym for some torture.

--- 帖子 #1748 ---
Hi Yen

yes its behaving now +127 on the 1st lot and hope that the 2nd lot runs to

about 19695 in line with 61.8 fibs and 9th july lows.

2 whole days of sunshine so a nicer pint of cold cider cheers

hi yen or anyone else..

pls can you help me here...

when you saw the eur/usd & cable signal using Ash's strategy & took those short trades, the market definetly went in your direction i.e. acted accoridng to Ash's predictions....

now my question is .. did that happen because everyone was expecting a short in these ccy's or ... ?

i mean is this really a self fulfilling prophesy?

sorry to ask dumb questions like this .. but ..

regards,

Pret

--- 帖子 #1751 ---
Looks like a quiet period for AshFx trades, folks. Nothing showing on my charts. Time to take a breather perhaps.

--- 帖子 #1752 ---
Guys is this fine to execute the trade? Please advice me ASAP.

--- 帖子 #1753 ---
Have you read the PDF in the first post?

--- 帖子 #1754 ---
Just want to be sure my friend. I'm just a beginner, hope u understand.

--- 帖子 #1755 ---
No, I don't think these trades were a self-fulfilling prophecy.

I think Ash would be the first to admit (well, the second, I guess, since I 'm the first right now) that an AshFX signal, powerful as it might be, is not enough to move the entire market.

The signal is a reflection of price action i.e. what the market is doing, rather than the other way around.

Either way, though, would it really matter, as long as the signal is correct?

--- 帖子 #1756 ---
Well, in the pair the PSAR dot is not the second of a serie-row, even though the ac and ao are in red. Also the stoch is so lower than 50,  almost 20.   So for me it is not a signal. Hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #1757 ---
I don't see a signal there. Explain why you think this is a signal and will see if I can help. Also go over the pdf again as it does explain the basics.

--- 帖子 #1758 ---
thanks bro you help me a lot.

--- 帖子 #1759 ---
Yes yen44x, it was not a signal if using a FXDD chart.  And also yes, the top resistance is strong and price is now going down. Amazing how different broker charts can affect the signals. Now I am using the FXDD charts. Thank you.

Hello jcllosag, thank you for your advice, but the PSAR in my chart is 0.03-0.2.   In week TF this pair –AUDCAD-, has being stopping at this resistance for 9 weeks, but also is in a up triangle formation that could break up.

You must get a great 'kick-back' for suppling all the Burros. . .Not to mention the double-duty that the burros are doing

--- 帖子 #1762 ---
From what I've heard he gets more than a great kickback from those furry cuties

--- 帖子 #1763 ---
What can I say . . . those burros can work all day and well into the night. It's amazing how much weight they can carry, if you catch my drift. I had a friend visiting from Illinois recently who wanted to take one for a "test drive", and that burro somehow managed to give him a good ride. (Sorry to give away your secret, Scotty.)

Right now, we're headed to the Oasis to see what's new and watch a little TV.

(For those who are wondering what in the world we're talking about, andante9 and Siam are good trading friends of mine, and they find it funny to kid me about burros since I live in Mexico. Come to think of it, I find it pretty funny too.)

--- 帖子 #1764 ---
I just closed my usd/cad long trade at +158 pips. Along with the first lot that was closed at +50, the total gain on the trade was 208 pips.

I was tempted to hang on to see if 1.0300 would be reached again, but the stoch has turned over and we have had six consecutive green candles, only the third time that's happened this year with this pair, so I felt like I would be pushing my luck to keep the trade going any longer.

--- 帖子 #1765 ---
Thanks Ash

--- 帖子 #1766 ---
looks like the CADJPY trade doesn't know where to go ...

--- 帖子 #1767 ---
This one is really interesting, at first I thought it is ready to place a trade in front of a computer monitor

Yeah, if I could teach that burro to trade successfully, I would head to the beach and just cash the checks.

Thx nvwine, I felt lost.     Sorry, I had to do a post like that to bring up memories of the oz thread.  I did place a hint on the post ....... the wink at the top.

--- 帖子 #1774 ---
You are probably right. The burro comment should have given me a clue.

--- 帖子 #1775 ---
Yeah he was kidding.

Burros can't trade, silly.  No way to right-click!

--- 帖子 #1776 ---
Trader_Not,

The best time for you to trade, in my estimation, would be in the middle of the night. Try to remain at the computer from around midnight to 8 a.m. because signals can literally appear out of nowhere when you least expect it. Whatever you do during that 8-hour period, DO NOT leave your computer area. You very well could miss out on the trade of a lifetime.

In regard to burros, I think a burro could actually enhance your trading. However,  training must start at a very young age. Luckily, I run a burro export service. Feel free to inquire if you would like more information and pricing.

Yours with tongue embedded firmly in cheek,

Your Friend Yen

P.S. Indeed, your post did bring up fond(?) reminders of the OzFX thread.

--- 帖子 #1777 ---
Way to go, Trader_Scott . . . this thread can remain inactive for hours, but bring up a burro and traders from around the world are happy to help.

--- 帖子 #1778 ---
I am still holding cad/jpy

Its About -66 pips at the mo anyone got any veiws on this trade?

--- 帖子 #1779 ---
Yen - in regards to your burro export business.......where is the burro I ordered two weeks ago?  Andante told me he received three burro's, but only ordered two.  Now I hope you didn't send him bonita.

--- 帖子 #1780 ---

In regard to Andante, he ordered during our "Buy Two Burros, Get One Free" special. Unfortunately, that special offer expired 2 minutes ago.

Thank you for inquiring about your order. We're always pleased to have another satisfied customer.

--- 帖子 #1782 ---
If it makes you feel any better, I'm at -73. My only reason for optimism is the strong resistance that's held for 2 months now. I'm hoping that will eventually get this trade down to breakeven or better.

On the other hand, I could have spared myself this trade my listening to Ash's advice. Oh well, live and learn.

On a much more positive note, the second lot on the eur/usd short trade is at +193 after closing out the first lot at +100. I also closed the usd/cad long earlier today with 1 lot at +50 and the second lot at +158. So, all in all, a very positive week for AshFX trades.

--- 帖子 #1783 ---
Basically,the Problem With The Trade Was That It Was Kind Way Too Oversold.next Time I Think One Should Pay Close Attention To That...

I Totally Agree With You On The Strong Resistance Line...i Hope Some Turn Around Comes As It Seems The Pair Doesn't Know Where To go; Or Should We Rent that Burrow To Pull It down???...let See

--- 帖子 #1784 ---
Im on real account on CADJPY. Im just following Ash advice. Let see where it ends.

Ash, which is your SL for this trade?

--- 帖子 #1785 ---
Check back on the previous posts. Ash's advice actually was that it was probably too late to take this trade when the signal came. He had recommended this trade over the weekend on his forexmoments subscriber list, but that was prior to the AshFX signal.

--- 帖子 #1786 ---
I checked back on the post myself and I stand partially corrected. Here's what Ash actually said:

"I actually shorted this at last night's market open.

Stochs are very close to 20. I think it will keep going down some more during this week, but not too sure if you'd get a good r:r return."

Here's the link: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...postcount=1714

So, he didn't say not to take the trade, but didn't strongly endorse it either.

Thanks

I didn't use the AshFX Daily System for this CAD/JPY short.

I actually entered at market open, closed half my position on Monday night, moved SL to BE, but the darn thing stopped out my other half  today.

I'm completely out.

--- 帖子 #1793 ---
Lol that's better than me!  Well done.

--- 帖子 #1794 ---
Ash do you think the pair will go down???Looks like its floating now and doesn't know where to go!!

--- 帖子 #1795 ---
It would interest me too, for AUDCAD, because i don´t have the other pair. Ash is offline, may be Yen can answer this when he is back from his ride on the burro .

--- 帖子 #1796 ---
What pair don't you have???

--- 帖子 #1797 ---
AUD/NZD.

I have a account in Marketiva ($5 offered for every new subscriber).

But.. not very much pairs. I was also missing CAD/JPY and others

I should go to another broker.

--- 帖子 #1798 ---
There's nothing quite like a burro ride followed by a siesta.

The aud/cad short had its first PSAR dot on the 24th on FXDD charts. The AC and AO agreed, but the candle did not, so it was not a valid AshFX trade IMHO. Obviously, if you had taken the signal back then, you'd be up on the trade right now, but that's the way it goes when you're trading a system. There's always the next trade.

--- 帖子 #1799 ---
thanks yen,

so today there is no signal with AUD/CAD... ?

you forgot to mention the fresh beers between

--- 帖子 #1800 ---
I think you and yen are talking about 2 different trades.Yen is talking about the last week trade and i suppose you are talking about today's trade...

--- 帖子 #1801 ---
morning,

i see of my fxdd-chart audcad,audnz,euryen short.

grüße aus Berlin Kittiman

--- 帖子 #1802 ---
PSAR hasn't crossed on FXDD and for the queen it's a totally wrong signal according to Ash's rules

--- 帖子 #1803 ---
I don't think we're talking about two different trades. The only short signal I see was on 7/24, but was not valid per AshFX rules. The signal hasn't changed since, so there's no new signal today.

--- 帖子 #1804 ---
I don't see any of these signals on FXDD charts today. Would you mind posting your charts, because I'm curious why we're seeing different things. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1805 ---
Here are the charts for aud/nzd and eur/jpy, and I already posted the aud/cad chart. I don't see a signal on these charts. Are yours different?

--- 帖子 #1806 ---
Hey Yen, I know there is not a signal on FXDD, but there is one on IBFX. Maybe that is what Ricki72 is talking about.

--- 帖子 #1807 ---
Yeah you know the broker time variance caused all these;is it that we agree to lookup for signals only from FXDD and take the trades elsewhere(we like)???

Cause basically; i use Alpari which is an hour after FXDD.

--- 帖子 #1808 ---
TraderJSS and Yen; Ricki says he uses Marketiva if i can recollect.

--- 帖子 #1809 ---
I am not familiar with that broker or the time frame they use. IBFX is on GMT if I am correct.

--- 帖子 #1810 ---
Your right on IBFX there was a signal today, but it did not fulfill the candlestick entry rule.  The candlestick was two bars ago.

--- 帖子 #1811 ---
IBFX's new daily bars start at 7:00 p.m cdt (cst before daylight savings)

--- 帖子 #1812 ---
How do you mean it didnt fufil the candlestick rule please??

--- 帖子 #1813 ---
I am not sure what the candlestick rule is. The signal met all of systems rules. I did not take the trade only because it is in a strong uptrend and there immediate support at .9633. I did notice it looks like it may have broken the trend line though, so I hope I am not kicking myself later for not taking the trade.

--- 帖子 #1814 ---
I've been testing a couple of filters for the signal candle to try and block bad trades:

1) Don't take doji candle signals. i.e short signal candle body equals no trade.

2) If the distance between the signal psar and the signal candle wick is greater than the candles high-low, then don't take that either.  This will help to remove a lot of the trades where the stop is going to be substantially larger than the target profit.

These modifications will block a few good trades too, but they will block many more false signals where you are either getting whipsawed or taking huge risk for a possibly small profit.

3) I've also been using MTF HAS on a 15 min chart.  It shows 15m, 30m, 1hr, and 4hr.  If going long, then after the signal candle wait for the 15m and 30m HAS to close green.   Wait for reds for a short.   This is a way of getting in at a better time after the retracement that often occurs following the signal candle.  That's if you've got time to keep an eye on it.

--- 帖子 #1815 ---
Opps, I reread ash's rules, and all it says it that it needs to be a bearish candle for a short (ie: a red candle for a short).  Sorry guys.  At first I took that as it needs to be a "bearish" candlestick sign such as a reversal sign like the dark cloud cover two days ago.

--- 帖子 #1816 ---
hmmm i had to use the GDP news to escape with that CADJPY trade....

i went out with -22

--- 帖子 #1817 ---
Hey Gang,   FXDD is offering a signing bonus for opening a new live account. I opened a new one yesterday, only $1,500 and got $120.00 added free (about 8% I think). Not sure how long the promotion goes. This may be of interest to Ricki on here. Give them an email or call for details. I'll probably donate the money to the burro travel fund so he/she can buy more suds... lol. Hope this post helps someone looking for a new account + free $$$$$.

Where are all the new trades ???? Geez wizz... gotto put that bonus to work!  Eric

Unless something changes in the next few hours, aud/nzd is showing a potential short SS signal.

The aussie has been getting hammered by other currencies the last few days, so maybe it's kiwi's turn to do some hammering now.

Thank you ,

i will have a look now.

BTW i asked the support of Marketiva today, what timeframe they use (GMT or...). They said it´s the time of my location. I don´t know how it works with others, but with Marketiva people have to download a streamster (client application). I had to enter some settings and the time shown is my time. Someone from China or Australia will see his time in the streamster.

Did i understand it right, or did you mean something else?

--- 帖子 #1822 ---
Grüße zurück aus München, Kollege!

--- 帖子 #1823 ---
so, to understand it right for a beginner,

the chart of the pair AUD/CAD is looking good for a short, but it is not a signal, because the AC was not red when the first PSAR dot was above the candle yesterday, right?

It was not even a SS-signal..., right? (only AO can be green)

unfortunately (the chart looks good, always moving down).

--- 帖子 #1824 ---
Yeah; it wasn't a signal on FXDD but it was valid on my platform as i earlier said and still trending down.

--- 帖子 #1825 ---
What broker are you using, ricki72? Your aud/cad chart is different than my FXDD chart, so I was just curious.

--- 帖子 #1826 ---
i just used MT4...

because on Marketiva (where i have money) there is no AC and AO.

Or i didn´t find them.

Wow, as i can see on your picture, it was a valid Ash-signal yesterday!

why not on MT4?

--- 帖子 #1827 ---
Valid SS signal on AUD/NZD.

Upward trendline could be a problem though.

Any thoughts anyone?

--- 帖子 #1828 ---
I am a newbie, but it seems like it has been in a very strong uptrend for a long time.  I think I will wait until we get a long signal and ride it that way.

The last few shorts have been short lived it seems to me.

Larry

--- 帖子 #1829 ---

It was a very good week for AshFX trades. I'm running the demo as a micro-lot account, so the profit total doesn't appear that impressive, but closed trades netted a total of 412 pips.

Good going Yen....you da man

--- 帖子 #1838 ---
Hi Eric, my name is Erik too (with "k", like the viking), so your father was a soldier placed in Munich during the cold war? Do you have memories of the city?

To all:

i am ready to open a mini account in FXDD. As i saw most of you guys trade on FXDD.

the costumer agreement is a never ending book, i would need 1 week to read and understand all, i guess you all didn´t read it completely. I found at the end that the limit of a mini account is $500. This is ok for me.

Now my questions:

- Does FXDD offer many pairs to trade? at least all the onces you were talking about in the last weeks?

- Untill august 8 i get 8% additionally on my account fund.

It´s written:

"The bonus credit to the account is effective when the new deposit is credited and is subject to the client completing at least 150 full lot closed trades on or before the close of business (4 p.m. EDT) on Friday, October 31, 2008."

I don´t understand it right.

Do i need after funding my account to make 150 full lot closed trades to receive the 8%?

- If i don´t trade, or not 150 full lots, then i receive the 8% bonus on october 31?

- as i understood, a full lot is for a standard account (min. $5000) $100.000.

for a mini account ($500) it is $10.000, right?

Finally i saw there are 4 different trading platforms:

- Meta trader

- FXDD trader

- FXDD Auto

- Power trader (min, $50.000, ok forget it )

- when a have a account and money, can i always choose the platform and switch?

or shall i decide before?

- which one do you use?

Sorry, questions over questions, i am a beginner.

Thank you for your time and help

--- 帖子 #1839 ---
The limit for starting your account is $500.00. After opening your account, you can add funds whenever you like with no limit. If your account is going to have $500.00 or less, I would really suggest you trade micro-lots rather than mini-lots. FXDD can arrange that for you. Just contact them in advance.

FXDD has 20 currency pairs, which should include most of what you've seen discussed on the thread.

Check with FXDD. When I funded my account a few months ago, they just wanted to see 150 trades in whatever type of account you opened (standard, mini, or micro).

I use MetaTrader. I'm not sure why you would want to switch platforms each time you trade, but my suggestion would be to contact FXDD with that question.

--- 帖子 #1840 ---
thank you Yen,

no, not each time i trade, but may be one day i decide tu change from metatrader to FXDD platform, because there are some advantages for me, f. ex.

But i guess, if i use metatrader, i can use these EAs, right? with FXDD may be i cannot?

yes that s what i want. Micro-lots means 1000 $ ?

That´s the advantage of marketiva. It´s very good for beginners. You can trade with 1$ if you want. Marketiva offers you 5$ when you open a account.

I knew a guy, a forex-beginner who started with the offered 5$ and made over 200$ with trading in one month, he took the money and left 20$ to do it again. But then it didn´t work out so well for him.

Now he is trading "quietly" making 5-15% per month.

Marketiva has 17 currency pairs

--- 帖子 #1842 ---
What does "quietly" mean? He won't teach you? Currently that is what I am looking for, a method to make about 10% average return on investment per month.

Does anyone believe ASHFX can make 10% a month. I see people say it makes a lot of pips, but that does not mean much until you figure in the risk/reward ratio.

--- 帖子 #1843 ---
Quietly means... how can you make 200$ with 5$? only with full risk on any trade. And he had a f... good luck. Now he s following the standard rules i think, not taking to much risks.... how it should be.

I cannot tell more. Last time i had contact with him was 1 year ago, in a HYIP-forum that doesn´t exist anymore.

He is still a beginner in my opinion so i didn´t want to ask him how he trades. May be he is not trading anymore, who knows, he s a student.

I can only say i will try ashfx-method and the signals posted here and see by myself

May be it makes 10%, or 100% a month, it depends with which leverage you trade.

Anyway i am happy an thankfull that Ash showed his system and about all the people working together here.

Hi All

I see the following trades on FXDD:

1. EURJPY Short (SS trade)

Stop: 16995 (252 pips)

Entry ~ 16743

TP1: 16646 (97 pips)

2. GBPJPY Short (FS trade)

Stop: 21412 (152 pips)

Entry ~ 21260

TP1: 21108 (152 pips)

GBPJPY looks to be the better option as the RR is more favourable and it is a First Strength trade.

The above figures are based on Fridays close so will change by the time the Monday candle opens but it what I will be looking at tomorrow night.

Any comments?

--- 帖子 #1845 ---
Might make more depending on how the market trends.I n very ranging markets might not be too helpful though..

--- 帖子 #1846 ---
Ijr... your entry and TP ARE THE SAME.

1. EURJPY Short (SS trade)

Stop: 16995 (252 pips)

Entry ~ 16743

TP1: 16743 (97 pips)

Thanks for spotting that. I had written it down on paper correctly but typed it in incorrectly.

I have edited the post.

--- 帖子 #1848 ---
Anyone here seen GBP/JPY as good short?

I saw it on FXDD MT4, and I think it's a FS.

SL:152 pips. (SL=Candle's high - Candel's close)

--- 帖子 #1849 ---
Apparently . . . it was noted 4 posts before yours.

--- 帖子 #1850 ---
I am asking from purely a realistic moneymanagement point of view, ie. 2% risk based on the stoploss and a 1:1 or beter risk/reward.

I am also glad that Ash has shared this method.

--- 帖子 #1851 ---
I'm not saying this is a losing system or anything (in fact it should be quite profitable) but since we are on the topic of people posting their pips and all, I will say this: I've noticed on forexfactory no one likes to brag about their losses, everyone always brags about how many pips they make. FF members rarely post when they lose. so just remember that when you read any thread on the internet, you are getting a very biased view.. The people who lost money a) don't goto the forum anymore, or b) just don't post. think about it.

who wants to brag about losing money? so of course on every single thread here you will only see positive comments (mostly) saying how they made X pips today or this week.. but a few months later you don't see them anymore.

btw, thanks ash for this system

anyway everyone should test it out for themselves.

--- 帖子 #1852 ---
10% a month is an unrealistic goal, you are on your path to failure with that kind of thinking.

try 1-5% (heck try anything above 0 for that matter!).. for a consistent 6 months......... forex.. don't quit your day job!

--- 帖子 #1853 ---
once again, please.

does everybody advise me tu use metatrader as the platform on FXDD?

i have already MT4 for analysis and demo trades. It´s even in german.

--- 帖子 #1854 ---
Of the two choices I use their MetaTrader platform. The other platform is Java based. I try to keep Java based applications to a minimum since they sometimes conflict on my computer. If you aren't sure I think you should try a demo of the Java based FXDD Trader platform. It is a free download. I think most people on this forum who have an account with FXDD use their MT4 platform so we might be biased. If you plan to enter or manage trades with EAs you would need the MT4 platform. You might also check with FXDD to see if you can trade micro lots with the FXDD Trader platform. I know you can with the MT4 platform if you request it.

--- 帖子 #1855 ---
Ash has stated many times in this thread that he uses Metatrader demo on FXDD for his signals so it would be advisable to do the same as it looks like most others posting here are also using FXDD. It just makes it easier if we are all looking at the same data.

I am sure this system will be just as effective on any other feed but then makes it difficult to ask others their opinion about signals.

--- 帖子 #1856 ---
ok thank you,

i think i ll take the metatrader

--- 帖子 #1857 ---
it is not the first PSAR dot above the candle that gives the signal, so acc. to Ash´s rules, it is not a signal ... in my opinion. Or is also the second PSAR dot valid?

On the first PSAR dot above the candle the AC is green -> so no signal.

--- 帖子 #1858 ---
It looks fine on my chart. MT4 & FXDD.

Are you looking at the Daily chart?

Note my screen says North Finance but this is the FXDD feed. Its just that I originally download MT4 from North Finance

--- 帖子 #1859 ---
strange... i use the demo version of MT4

why is it different?

--- 帖子 #1860 ---
may be because of the time zone..

i live in Germany and there it is not a signal !!!

--- 帖子 #1861 ---
What broker are you going through? Ash has based this system on FXDD where the new daily candle opens at 22h00 UK time (GMT+1). You will see differences if you use another time frame or broker.

Also are you using the template from the first post?

--- 帖子 #1862 ---
i don´t know... i downloaded MT4 some months ago just to see, i don´t have an account on FXDD but i will have soon.

you mean the PDF?

yes i do.

But you see how a signal can be suddenly not a signal depending on the time frame??

This is not logic somehow...

--- 帖子 #1863 ---
No. You should apply the template (.tpl file) from the first post to ensure you have the correct setting for the indicators.

I think it is logical as the indicators are working on different data. On one feed there could have been a big move and will show on the current candle but on another feed ( with diff timezone ) that same move will be included in the next candle

--- 帖子 #1864 ---
You need to download a MT4 demo from FXDD. Save the template file (AshFX_Daily.tpl) from the first post to the template folder. Then after re-starting MT4 apply the template file to your charts. Brokers that have a Sunday bar or different opening times will show different signals. Having a Sunday bar creates a 6 day week with one day showing very little movement. This can effect mathimatical calculations. Since Ash created and tested his system on FXDD it is a good idea to learn the system on that demo. It also helps so you can compare trades with others in the thread. You can have MT4 platforms from more than one broker on your computer. If you compare a couple of them every day you will see the difference. It is always possible that another platform with modified parameters may work just as well or better. Time will tell.

--- 帖子 #1865 ---
Hi,

My chart is showing the same as yours because the setting of the PSAR is at 0.03/0.2.

I have tested it by changing the setting to 0.02/0.2 and I get the entry signal.

So what is the official setting for PSAR?

--- 帖子 #1866 ---
A specific broker's server times are the same in every country. An FXDD account will have the same server time and the chart will display the same everywhere in the world. The PSAR settings are in the first post. "Parabolic Stop and Reverse (PSAR, 0.03, 0.2)"

--- 帖子 #1867 ---
Thanks for the advise, but I believe that is a very narrow minded view of what can be achieved. If it works for you then by all means keep the faith.

--- 帖子 #1868 ---
Hi Everyone,

Interesting to see that there has been some talk about the profitability of this system and the money management aspect. I would like to throw in my thoughts and I am interested what others think.

I have monitored the system rigorously during July and, if the rules were strictly adhered to, then the system is in loss. Looking at the trades I believe the reason for this is the risk to reward for second strength trades. Have a look back to 9th July at GBP/CHF and AUD/CAD and also 15th July to EUR/CHF, EUR/JPY and USD/JPY to see heavily losing trades. Those trades alone could have lost in excess of 1200 pips and indeed you would double that for the two lots that the system suggests are risked for each trade - 2400+ pips!

Now, if winning trades, massively outnumber those that lose and the second part of the trade runs on to a big win then that may not be a problem. However, quite often the second trade reverts to the break even stop loss. So, the profit is the first lot only which generally is a lot less than the risk.

Now, it may be that July is not a representative month. And, I should add, I have not given up on the system because of July's results. However, I am adopting a more conservative money management strategy for the second strength trades (see the post by AIRX3000 for further details earlier in the thread) whilst still monitoring the trades against the system that Ash designed. It could be that future months may be fine.

One final thing I would add is that I wouldn't rely on any of the EA's results just yet. As far as I am aware none of them have been tested enough to suggest that they are error free and, as such, I don't think anyone should be basing their trading strategy on them (apologies to those guys writing the EA's - I am sure that they will be of great benefit in the future).

Just my thoughts, I may not be infallible with my analysis but I thought I would put my point of view for discussion.

--- 帖子 #1869 ---
Your post, IMHO, nicely illustrates the danger of taking any system and putting it on auto-pilot. This system was not meant to totally replace trader discretion. If you look back at previous posts, you will see a number of examples where Ash, the system creator, passed on a trade due to strong support or resistance.

Signals are merely that . . . a signal for each trader to take a look at a currency pair and then make a decision as to whether it's a trade they feel comfortable with. I have only been tracking results for the last couple of weeks, but in that time I have probably taken only about 50% of the AshFX signals. Blending the signal with some discretion has allowed me to earn about 550 pips in that time.

--- 帖子 #1870 ---
Henry Ford said it best: “If you think you can…. or if you think you can’t…you’re right!”

60 years ago, running a 4-minute mile was an "unrealistic goal". 50 years ago, getting a man to the moon was an "unrealistic goal", and so it goes throughout history.

Will you achieve a 10% monthly return? Maybe . . . maybe not. But I think your chances are better if you believe it can be done versus calling it an "unrealistic goal."

--- 帖子 #1871 ---
There is nothing more powerfull than positive thinking!

Nice one Yen.

--- 帖子 #1872 ---
You are correct Yen. Couldn't agree more about trader discretion. However, the risk/reward for some trades is not advantageous regardless of whether the individual thinks the trades will be successful.

If you don't mind me asking, do you use the money management from the scheme, or one of your own for the trades you take?

--- 帖子 #1873 ---
I agree completely, and that tends to be the trades I stay away from.

I'm using a blend of the two. I tend to take profits on the first lot a little earlier than the rules state. For example, if my first target is 175 pips, I'm usually more than content to put my first lot to bed at 100 pips. By the same token, though, I think it's ill-advised to close out the first lot at 25-30 pips, which I've seen done at times, simply because a system based on Daily charts should be able to generate far more profit that that if it's worthwhile at all.

Likewise, on the second lot, I'm not going to sit by and watch the profits disappear on a trade that's up considerably. At some point, I will cash in on the winnings prior to seeing the trade return to breakeven. For example, on the recent eur/usd short, I was up on the second lot over 200 pips. Price then retraced over 175 pips, and I decided to close the second lot at +100. It has since moved back down, but it ended the day at a previous S & R level, so I'm content with my decision.

--- 帖子 #1874 ---
Im just going to throw my 2 cents in here. Its good read both your points of view, and both of you are on the money. From what I have learned by using the system since July is this 1. If you look at the indicators to tell you when to buy and when to sell, in the long run you will probably end up loosing. I dont look at the indicators to tell me when to trade, I look at it as an invitation to look more into the price action of the pair, such as support, resistance, trends etc.. this is where it becomes discretionary. 2. I have seen all my trades in July hit the profit target on the first lot, only to have all the second lot close at break even. This is where I will listen to Yen's advice and adjust to taking profits on my second trade, whether it is by a trailing stop or just adjusting my stop loss when I am in the green, either way I dont want to be up 200 pips and see it break even 2 days later, that hurts. I had a great month in July, but it would have been that much better if I would have taken profits on the second trade.

I backtested this system for myself over the weekend, on one of the pairs I tested since 2005 out of over 100 trades, only one kept going on the second trade without breaking even first, it made +589 pips. Every other second trade either broke even or closed at very little. Those are not good odds.

Sorry not trying to hijack your conversation, just wanted to share my information.

--- 帖子 #1875 ---
Hey Gang,

I love the Ash System and it usually makes a profit. That being said, I am retired as a Contractor of 30 years. I love spending the day on my charts every day. I don't use the Ash take profit rules. I exit while in profit and use a predetermined stop that is different for each trade depending upon what I see on the chart, support and resistance, fib., etc. I don't take many losses in any of my trades. By the way, I have seen many posts here where people report any losses... not just profit... but then I read the posts every day. Unless it's mandatory to be away from your computer (i.e.JOB), You shouldn't suffer many losses if your on your charts and know how to read what they are telling you.. If I was gone I would lower my TP in the trade and use a shorter stop loss of about 30 pips. When I'm on the chart and take a 10 pip loss out of existing profit, I'm usually out at that point. If it reverses, it's easy enough for me to get back in and I enjoy the extra pips I saved.  Just my thoughts and strategy. Keep up the good work and posts gang and thanks again Ash.   Eric

--- 帖子 #1876 ---
Many thanks for the feedback from all. Helps to hear other traders experiences.

Now back to the two potentials - EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY. Both look tempting - worth a go, do you think?

--- 帖子 #1877 ---
puuh...

lots of long posts with much forex-science and know how!

if it was in german it would be easyer for me.

But i follow half the way some how.

To the last one, Eric from Munich:

Did i understand it right?

You close the trade when for ex. the chart goes 10 pips in the wrong direction?

If i set my stop loss to 30 pips before i leave to work, then it would nearly always reach the stop loss. The waves always go up and down.

--- 帖子 #1878 ---
Marketiva has these 2 pairs, so i will do these trades with a little money and see.

But as you know i m a beginner, trying to loose his money

Edit: if you look in the 5 min or 15 min charts, they are both going up since friday.

I would wait.

Im in both of these trades, so far so good, nice call.

--- 帖子 #1884 ---
Not true. The "rigorous" rules include Support and Resistance which can and DO affect SL & TP, and entry / exit decisions.

--- 帖子 #1885 ---
ASH's system is an entry option. It is up to the trader to use discretion. These are high probability entries because they are off of the daily. With that said if you follow blindly and do not have the ability to manage and adapt as the trade progresses it is a craps game and you are rolling the dice....some examples; S/R, price spikes, price action, momentum, doji's, reversals and other candle patterns that develop you should just trade a robot and see if a mechanical method works better for you. You need to be an effective trader to trade the system not a blind follower of the indicators presented. This is a great method as is Pipnailer if traded using one's trading intuition and ability. Don't blame ASH if you have a succession of losers with this. Analyse how you managed the trade. There is always a nailed candle aound the corner for an opportunity to do better or just get on the thread and whine because it did not work out. ASH does not throw junk out there that he dosen't feel confident in trading himself. If you spent countless of hours on these forums and read his post you would have known that by now. Good luck on the next nailed one!

--- 帖子 #1886 ---
It was really the burro that got into the beer, and I had to go bail him out of jail, as you can see in the picture.

Actually, I was out and about all afternoon, so missed the start of the Monday candle. I was planning to take the gbp/jpy short, but price had already moved down about 30 pips by the time I got home, so I have a sell limit order set if price climbs back to 212.60. Otherwise, I'll just catch the next trade.

I chose not to take the eur/jpy signal, but good luck to those who did.

--- 帖子 #1887 ---
FXDD new daily candles come at 2pm PST right?

--- 帖子 #1888 ---
Yes.

--- 帖子 #1889 ---
CAUTION EVERYONE.... I screwed up. On the chart tonight on eur/usd doing some scalping. I always have the order window open on my chart when scalping and check the pair listed. Well this happened twice before I figured it out. I was on FXDD. The order window registered EUR/USD. While waiting for the next candle I scrolled the chart back an hour or so and only looked at the info for 30 seconds at the most... then scrolled back to where the active trade was registering. I saw the buy entry on the chart and took it. about 10 minutes later I closed the trade. I had made about 12 pips. When I went to the History tab... I had lost about 14 Pips. What the hell is going on the burro said...no suds doing this! When I scrolled back to check the chart... it changed the pair on the order window because I was scrolling. I didn't know it would do that... $140 lesson...Ouch! Won't make that mistake again.

Ricki...If I'm on the charts and I'm down 10 pips on an Ash trade... I get out and watch. When and if it turns around I get back in for the rest of the ride. Often saving me 40-60 pips. But remember I'm always monitoring the charts.  Sometimes when I leave the house I'll put a stop loss of 30 pips. And yes, most times I get stopped out. Over the last couple of days... if I leave the house I just close the trade. There is always the next trade coming and it saves me 30 pips loss when I do it that way... I'm not suggesting anyone else do it the same way... but it works for me.

I hope no one looses any pips by screwing up the way I did. Tell the burro I won't do that any more.

Just wanted to post this to help others.   Eric

--- 帖子 #1890 ---
Apologies Ash - you are correct. However, I was just trying to point out that if anyone were to take all the entry signals then the system is in loss for July. Upon re-reading your .pdf you do state, at the end, that S/R, fibs etc. should be taken into account. Maybe that needs to be highlighted a bit stronger in your paper - just a thought.

I am not "whining" as some other posters seem to think. Just adding some thought to the debate, which is what I thought these forums were for. Maybe they are just for people to brag about their pip gains!

--- 帖子 #1891 ---
thanks, -70 pips actually.. i pushed the stop loss up.

Why didn´t you want to take it?

gbp/jpy still around 0

--- 帖子 #1892 ---
The EUR/JPY short may yet prove to be a good trade, but I just didn't like the setup for a couple of reasons:

1. The huge stop loss required made for an unattractive R:R IMO. I'm not sure why you needed to push the stop loss up when you were at only -70, because the stop loss on this SS trade needed to be about 252 pips (using the swing high of 7/23).

2. I also took a look at how price behaved around the trend line on 8/1. Although we had a nice move down, it failed to push past the trend line. Combined with the large stop loss, that was enough to convince me to stay out.

Again, this may prove to be a decent trade, but I just didn't feel comfortable with it. If I was going to take this trade, I would look to enter when price re-tests the 170 area, or at some point when my stop loss could be around 100 pips or so. Then, it would look like a much more attractive trade to me.

--- 帖子 #1893 ---
My response to your earlier post was more of a compliment for illustrating the need to look at other factors in addition to the AshFX signal. Your post inspired some debate, which is a healthy part of any thread, but in re-reading the other posts that followed yours, I can't find a single instance of anyone who even hinted that you were "whining".

Did I miss something?

As an addendum, I will mention this: When you end this post with the statement that maybe the forums  "are just for people to brag about their pip gains!", that does smack of whining in my opinion.

--- 帖子 #1894 ---
252 pips!!!

on the PDF it´s written

"so to calculate the number of pips your SL would be for a short, then the formula would be SL= candle´s high - candle´s close."

This would be here :

(from Marketiva) 1.6842 - 1.6768 = 74 pips

For SS trades, "when going short, the initial SL would be at the swing high"

May be i don´t understand.. what does this mean?

Edit: ok true, i forgot eur/jpy was a SS signal

--- 帖子 #1895 ---
Yen I wasn't having a go at you - apologies if it appeared that way.

However, see post http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...postcount=1888 for the reference to whining.

I am not whining about people posting their wins, far from it. I wouldn't do it myself but then everybody has a right to post what they wish. Just that as soon as someone questions something then there appears to be a defensive post that attacks that individual. Maybe I am being too sensitive.

--- 帖子 #1896 ---
yes, would be good for beginners like me.

i don´t even know what S/R, fibs etc. are.

Well for S/R i have an idea. Acc. to one post of Yen with a picture, i understood the resistance is a straight line combining the tops of the chart during some months. So the chart doesn´t seem to be able to break threw this line.

The support is the line that combines the bottoms of the chart, right?

Can somebody explain to me in short words or give me a link?

--- 帖子 #1897 ---
EJ @ -106

--- 帖子 #1898 ---
Fair enough, James. I didn't think you were attacking me but it did appear you were upset at some of the other posts. You've been a regular contributor to this thread and I always enjoy your contributions. I did think you were being a tad sensitive on this issue, but then again we all put up our defenses if we feel the need. I feel posting wins and losses is an integral part of the thread, because it gives us all an idea of how the system is working for others, lets us analyze trades we might have avoided, and so forth.

Good luck on your trades. Keep on posting.

--- 帖子 #1899 ---
My suggestion would be to do some additional research on "swing high" and "swing low" on this forum or google the subject, because it's an important part of this system. But, in brief, here's a description:

Take a look at www.babypips.com

I think I'm allowed to post a link to another site. If not, my apologies to the powers that be. Babypips does a nice job of covering the basics of forex trading.

Here's a link regarding S & R, but I would really suggest you do more research on it, because it's an absolute key to trading this system or any other.

Hey . . . what about me and the burros? We're thirsty too.

--- 帖子 #1903 ---
Didn't take either of these.

EURJPY - Too much risk for only small reward.  Also, even though it looks a bit sideways I feel it's against the trend.  The psar over the last two weeks has primarily been saying long, not short.

GBPJPY - I didn't like the look of the candle lineup from 30/6 to 11/7.  I wanted to see a close below the bodies of these on the signal candle for a short.

A bit picky I guess, but at least I'll sleep well.

EURGBP looks okay for tomorrow though.

--- 帖子 #1904 ---
I've had some very nice trades using both the Daily and 4 Hour time frames.  I recently opened the EA to allow for any time frame and have posted my results on the thread below for anyone interested.

AshFX Daily (EA - MTaboneWeb)

--- 帖子 #1905 ---
I'm in the GBP/JPY short trade, but you may very well be right. I was hoping for a low today that would be under Friday's low of 211.99. We came within 7 pips, but didn't quite make it as of yet. I'm currently up 29 pips on this trade, but that's nothing on gbp/jpy, and I would have been much more comfortable if price had reached a new low.

However, it does appear that the closing price will be slightly under Friday's close unless something changes in the next 3 hours,  so who knows. Time will tell.

--- 帖子 #1906 ---
yen, which are your SL and TP for GBPJPY, please?

thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #1907 ---
i closed both. eur/jpy with 90 pips loss, gbp/jpy with around 30 pips loss. Then i went long for both, to take back may be what i lost and because i m on holiday, i have some time for scalping. Both are in +.

Yen, go to your fridge and take some, call the burros, i opened my corona. Cheers from south bavaria (with many cows and goats, but no burros).

--- 帖子 #1908 ---
It was a full-strength trade, so I just went with the SL per AshFX rules, which if I figured right was 152 pips. I was looking for a target of 100 pips on the first lot, which would have put me just slightly within the channel that existed in early July, and looked to be an obvious initial support area. If I reach that, I'll let the second lot run, because it looks like the next support zone would be around 209.

Right now, that's all speculation, since this trade didn't do much at all today.

On a brighter note, the AUD/NZD short from 8/1 is doing well. The first lot is closed, and I'm at +94 on the second lot. If this trade falls to some of the fib lines, it would turn out to be a sweet trade.

--- 帖子 #1909 ---
Good luck with it.  Hope it works out for you.  I'm probably being a bit too wary and will miss a heap of pips.

With the EURGBP long.  The big problem I can see here is the high impact news in about 13 hours from now:

GBP manufacturing Production m/m Previous -0.5% Forecast 0.1%

I can see any long attempt going negative shortly after this.  Think I'll be twiddling my thumbs again.  Maybe I'll enter after the fallout.

--- 帖子 #1910 ---
I think I'm probably going to pass on EUR/GPB as well. The euro had a very good day today versus a lot of currencies, eur/gpb included, but price stalled at a point that has been a real resistance area the past few weeks.

As it stands right now, this trade would require a stop loss of 59 pips. Considering that each pip is worth almost double on this pair, that may be a little more risk than I care to take with this setup.

Hi

This is my first post, been following the thread for long time, it would be great if seniors here comment on the expected ashfx daily short trade coming on gbp/chf

nisha

--- 帖子 #1912 ---
Well, I don't know if I'm a senior, but I'll volunteer if it means a discount at the restaurant. Anyway, here's my two pips worth: First, that trade is not showing up yet on FXDD charts. It appears you're using ODL, which figures in a Sunday candle (unlike FXDD) and a later starting time for the daily candle, and can result in far different trade signals.

If it was a short signal on FXDD, I would definitely take the trade as it appears on your charts. The pair has been stuck in a 600-pip channel for over 3 months, so I would keep trading the tops and bottoms of the channel until it's broken one way or another. But, I wouldn't take this trade based on ODL charts.

--- 帖子 #1913 ---
On both FXDD and Alpari i use here ;GBPCHF doesn't stand valid.

Please what broker is that??

--- 帖子 #1914 ---
Hi Yen

thanks for your reply, nice to get from you, been seeing your replies here and its interesting.

I have been using ODL itself for all the signals, as i have a live a/c with them, so i already took a small mini lot short with Stop above 2.0850  hope with the BOE rate decision, the TP gets hit and not the SL

--- 帖子 #1915 ---
Thx for pointing this out.

--- 帖子 #1916 ---
Well, you should be safe with that SL unless the channel finally breaks. Good luck!

One suggestion: Even if your live account is with ODL, you would probably benefit from a demo account with FXDD just so your signals are accurate per the system rules.

--- 帖子 #1917 ---
[quote=yen44x;2144545]The EUR/JPY short may yet prove to be a good trade, but I just didn't like the setup for a couple of reasons:

1. The huge stop loss required made for an unattractive R:R IMO. I'm not sure why you needed to push the stop loss up when you were at only -70, because the stop loss on this SS trade needed to be about 252 pips (using the swing high of 7/23).

Yen,

Wouldn't this qualify as a full strength trade:

First PSar pointing down

AO & AC Red

Bear Candlestick

SToch crossed moving downward

Would you then follow Ash's formula for SL & TP

I didn't take the trade because the RSI (my own addition) has been stuck in  45-55 area, not showing any real strength up or down.

--- 帖子 #1918 ---
Everything you pointed out is true, but what made it an SS trade is that the stoch reading was around 31 on the day of the signal. Anything below 50 for a short trade qualifies it as an SS trade.

--- 帖子 #1919 ---
Thanks Yen, totally missed that. Appreciate your help.

--- 帖子 #1920 ---
Pardon me but I have to disagree with you on the gbp/chf trade. If it does not appear on FXDD I dont think it negates the trade I feel ODL gives an earlier signal as compared to FXDD and in most cases FXdd shows the signal one day after ODL and from what i have been observing if you take signals based on ODL more pips can be made and gbp/chf is a short also on ozfx system. Good trades pal

--- 帖子 #1921 ---
Based on technicals gbp/chf is a valid short but the risk of BOE is there.

--- 帖子 #1922 ---
No pardon required; you can feel free to disagree with me any time you like.

Please keep in mind that my reply was to a trader who was making his very first post. I wasn't sure he knew that Ash suggests the use of FXDD, and felt I should point it out.

If you've been doing well with ODL, more power to you, pal.

--- 帖子 #1923 ---
Based on technical trading, without regard to AshFX, this trade probably should have been taken at the top of the channel. If that was done, a trader would be up over 200 pips at this point with profit locked in well before BOE.

--- 帖子 #1924 ---
any signal today ?

--- 帖子 #1925 ---
Agree with you on that, I shorted at 2.790, and closed half of it still holding half for sub 2.04xx. good trades and your inputs are appreciated

--- 帖子 #1926 ---
Very nice trade, mi amigo.

At that entry, you could have had a very small stop loss with potential gain of hundreds of pips. Nicely done.

--- 帖子 #1927 ---
Thanks a lot friend.

--- 帖子 #1928 ---
yen, que piensas sobre el EURGBP?

una entrada SS valida.

estoy en ella!

gracias por tus comentarios amigo.

yo entiendo bien el ingles pero mas facil escribo el español...para ti debe ser al reves, no?

juan carlos

--- 帖子 #1929 ---
tu puedes mirar en el texto #1913 una pagina antes que Yen no quieres entrar en el EURGBP, porque algunas rasones que yo no comprendo, porque mi ingles no eres sufisamente bueno.

Pero Yen vas a responder presto so no es ahora burracho con sus cervecas frescas y sus amigos los burros

PS: estoy en ella tambien, pero haciendo "scalping"

--- 帖子 #1930 ---
thanks & cheers!

--- 帖子 #1931 ---
To help keep a positive tone in this thread I will share that most of my trades are winners just like the title trade, still open at 360 pips, and my home currency NZDUSD sell, still open at 300 pips, as our friend who trades from a lovely part of Mexico has suggested, some trades set earlier than the Ash  system allows, but with a short stop, low risk, they regularly turn into big winners, control losses and let profit happen, it all takes time and patience.

My contribution today from down under where beer is only drunk cold.

--- 帖子 #1932 ---
CONGRATS, I saw the euraud yrade and did not take it should have though. Well done dude.

--- 帖子 #1933 ---
Cuidado, mi amigo, que dice???? Soy un "gringo", pero entiendo unas palabras de espanol. No soy borracho hasta las siete. Ay, que hora es, tengo empezar ahorita.

Es dificil para explicar en espanol, pero me no gusta eur/gpb porque hay mucha resistencia en la area del intercambio. Entiende?

--- 帖子 #1934 ---
Hey guys

I heard that some of u are planning to long EUR/GBP. Please dont try that I and my friends are already short for 40 pips...

--- 帖子 #1935 ---
Sí, está bien. My pensamiento sobre eur/gpb está aquí: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...postcount=1913

Entiende mi español muy pobre?

--- 帖子 #1936 ---
Nice trades, my kiwi friend.

Now the secret is out . . . the first step in becoming a skilled trader is to drink your beer COLD. It's amazing to me that Ash and so many other Brits have overcome the serious handicap of drinking warm beer and still managed to become good traders.

--- 帖子 #1937 ---
I didn't take this trade, but how in the world are you and your friends down 40 pips?

EUR/GPB ended yesterday's trading at .7938 and is now at .7937. I'm missing how you could be down that far unless you have 39 friends and you're all down 1 pip for a group total of 40 pips.

--- 帖子 #1938 ---
Muchas gracias mano

--- 帖子 #1939 ---
Ok the second candle has backed up a little, but this trade has the pertentual of 100 pips with out going beyond the sideways channel that its been in, however it may become frustrating though because the buys have been slower than the sells recently

--- 帖子 #1940 ---
Hi Yen

I totally agree with your point here.

This account was only 5000 equity when I started Running the EA on it in mid July. Current Equtiy is over 6000 so it can be done.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

These trades were all automatic but could have easily been duplicated manually.

--- 帖子 #1941 ---
Guess we all should be smiling now trades taken on Sunday went right this morning   Bring the burrow and let me buy him all the Hieniken beer and lets get drunk....ehehehehe

--- 帖子 #1942 ---
I meant that we already took a short...we sold.. But Ok was just kidding. The pair seems to have gone high enough for a good retrace. Personally didnt think it was worth the risk.. But thats my opinion anyway

--- 帖子 #1943 ---
Hola andante9,

Way to go! That's a great report.

--- 帖子 #1944 ---
hasta las siete en la man~ana?

--- 帖子 #1945 ---
No importa . . . la manana y la noche esta bien.

--- 帖子 #1946 ---
Both trades I'm in (aud/nzd short & gpb/jpy short) have done well over the last few hours, but I'm watching closely now to see if gbp/jpy can get through the long-term trend line it's sitting on right now. If it does, the next possible target would be around 209, which served as long-term resistance when the pair was in an uptrend, and could likely became a support zone on the way down.

--- 帖子 #1947 ---
10% a month consistently is pretty good going I'd say. Obviously it all depends on what drawdown your prepared to take...

--- 帖子 #1948 ---
Right with you on this trade, Yen. I have been willing it to breakthrough that trendline - attempted 3 times today. Here's hoping!

--- 帖子 #1949 ---
Maybe we need to do a "group chant" to get it to break through that stubborn trend line. Price retraced considerably while I was out of the house, but I'm going to hang in there on this trade for a while. There's a lot of potential upside to the downside, if you follow me.

--- 帖子 #1950 ---
for tomorrow I dont see any trade.

what do you think?

jc

--- 帖子 #1951 ---
I didn't see any new trades today on FXDD charts.

The two trades I have open are still doing well:

GBP/JPY Short: 1 lot closed; 2nd lot at +88

AUD/NZD Short: 1 lot closed; 2nd lot at +240

--- 帖子 #1952 ---
Agree, no new trades.

--- 帖子 #1953 ---
yeah no trades

--- 帖子 #1954 ---
OK, it's unanimous then . . . let's head to the burro barn then and swap lies about our best trades.

What about the cool beers, have one for me

--- 帖子 #1956 ---
Consider it done! And, if there's any traders from the UK online, we have some nice warm beer for you too.

--- 帖子 #1957 ---
Rather unusual and worrisome. I hope we are not mis-reading the charts. I better check a few less well known brokers like Beaverhead Financial so I can talk about the 4 possible trades you guys missed.

--- 帖子 #1958 ---
hahhaha,,,, going to have the last beer (warm one) before I get to bed.

hi everyone,

Im glad that i ad finish reading this thread and i think i have enough knowledge to trade with this method ad.

Wow it has been a tiring job to read thorugh this thread cause it got 131 pages and i just came back from melbourne last month without trading quite a long time.

Hopefully i can contribute to this thread in the future.

cheers,

stan88

--- 帖子 #1962 ---
You would have had about 20 pages less to read if that one darn guy would quit posting about beers and burros. Oh wait, that's me.

Welcome to the land of AshFX.

--- 帖子 #1963 ---
May be tonight this trade will get past the 500 pips for me

--- 帖子 #1964 ---
It looks like you don't have far to go. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #1965 ---
Thanks. The Burro stayed on the right side of the bars yesterday, I love the pictures, what are your day temperatures at present?. which coast are you on?.

--- 帖子 #1966 ---
I live in the central highlands of Mexico at about 6500 feet (a. 2000 meters), and so I'm about 7-8 hours from the nearest coast. As a result, though, there's no humidity to speak of at all and the weather is pretty much eternal spring, with daytime temperatures of about 75-80 degrees (24-26 celsius) year-round.

Back to biz . . . it looks like your eur/aud trade must have come extremely close to the +500 pip mark. My aud/nzd short trade basically treaded water since the new daily candle, and the gbp/jpy short has continued to retrace slightly, but is still hanging on by its fingernails.

--- 帖子 #1967 ---
i have a question:

When i open a order in Marketiva, there is a spread of 8 pips!

when i close, there is no spread i think.

This a lot, isn´t it?

--- 帖子 #1968 ---
Which currency pair? 8 for eur/usd is a lot; 8 for gpb/jpy is about right.

--- 帖子 #1969 ---
i think it was for AUD/CAD

--- 帖子 #1970 ---
Hi Yen - looks like the GBP/JPY will have hit the stop on the second lot. Managed to get out overnight at 21202 myself as I set my SL at that after looking at the charts. So took a little bit of profit.

Shame - was really hoping that one would track down to 20900. Maybe next time!

--- 帖子 #1977 ---
Well, you were smarter than me. I decided to ride it out to the bitter end and closed the second lot at +1. Ouch!

In hindsight, I would have been far smarter to close the second lot at the trend line, which also corresponded with the strong support back in early July. That's easy to see now, but I guess that's how hindsight works.

I closed my second lot of the aud/nzd short trade at +178, so at least the day wasn't a total wash.

I didn't see any new AshFX trades for today, so I have nothing going for now on the AshFX system.

--- 帖子 #1978 ---
Just curious if anyone else is in this trade besides me... Its currently down right now, but hopefully it will continue its bounce of the 200sma.

Yen44x, you mentioned you were in the trade, are you still hangin on??

--- 帖子 #1979 ---
Check back . . . what I actually said was I did not take the trade, but good luck on it. It never appeared as an FXDD signal, but traders who use other brokers mentioned that there was a short signal on their charts.

--- 帖子 #1980 ---
Yep you're right. Sorry about that. I use IBFX, which is why I got the signal. Hopefully it takes off.

--- 帖子 #1981 ---
No problema, amigo. It if follows the pattern established over the past few months, it may eventually head south to the bottom of the channel. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #1982 ---
anyone can attach the latest AshFX Daily EA,since i cant find it for downloading.

Thank You

lee

--- 帖子 #1983 ---
Well, it was more by good luck than good management really. Pretty new to this stuff but I am trying to trail my stops by looking at S/R, fibs etc. and thought I saw something.

With hindsight though that trendline and the fact that the price rejected it 3 times did sort of suggest that it should have been time to get out. Always easy when you look back!

Nice profit on that AUD/NZD trade - good going!

No AshFX dailies for me either. I have been looking at the Pipnailer system which appears to be worth investigating. Do you trade any other systems Yen?

--- 帖子 #1984 ---

--- 帖子 #1986 ---
Yes, just realised that the EA has been withdrawn by Matt. If you do a search you may be able to find another which has been programmed by Ronald Raygun.

hi mate

can you give the link .Thanks

Hey Ade mo wa pa ooo..

Yeah i hv been using this signals for my live accounts for like a month now but i don't take all the signals blindly oooo.But i must confess its been very challenging and interesting..

--- 帖子 #1993 ---
Just looking at the FXDD charts and I see EUR/CHF sell as a possible trade for tomorrow, what do you think guys?

--- 帖子 #1994 ---
yeah valid

--- 帖子 #1995 ---
do you get your signal on GMT META TRADER,THEN APPLY IT TO ALPARI?

I NOTICE SOMETHING ON ALPARI,

1.FOR EVERY FIRST PARABOLIC SAR POINT,ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE IS A CHANGE IN TREND ON THE PREVIOUS CANDLE,IT ALWAYS COMPLY AND GIVE GOOD TRADE DESPITE THE AC AND OC HAVE NOT CHANGED. I ALWAYS WIN A TRADE AHEAD OF OTHER PLATFORM WITH THIS.

WHAT DO YOU THINK?

YOU CAN BACK TEST IT.

--- 帖子 #1996 ---
EUR/CHF looks realy good for a short, what do u gays think?

--- 帖子 #1997 ---
IMHO just in a doubt as my trendline depicts an upward trend and the pair has been ranging recently  but still looks like a definite setup.

--- 帖子 #1998 ---
Depends how you look at it - could be a double top 19 May and 31 July?

Hi yen44x

This pair has only a 63 pip daily average I have noticed the 68.1% on the fib at around 1.6222 is only 57 pips away from the current price, I was thinking maybe............

1.6222 would be a good place to t/p what do you think?

--- 帖子 #2001 ---
Sounds good to me as an initial target. Based on AshFX rules, your first TP would be around 60 pips, depending on your broker, so that's just about right.

--- 帖子 #2002 ---
Hi guys,I have been and am still following this system very closely. I have understood the basics clearly; it's the delicate analysis - seeing and being able to interprete the signals beyond the basics, incorporating warning signs and all that. As i read the posts daily, i am seeing how and why signals are or are not taken.I really appreciate you guys for your "open-ness". I am learning from you all, especially yen. I hope you'd stay here long enough. By the way, where's Ash?

--- 帖子 #2003 ---
Lol, I'm right here. Good to hear you're learning.

Eur/Chf looks like a decent short.

yeah looking good so far

--- 帖子 #2006 ---
Welcome!

--- 帖子 #2007 ---
Hello everybody,

Some people were complaining that everybody posts only good results and not bad ones, so i will make them lie

I posted here quiet good results on this thread for july.

I tested this system on demo in July ang got around +1500.

So here are my result as for august 1 til today

AUD/CAD -77

EUR/JPY  -160

CHF/JPY -90

GBPCHF -153

No one single positive trade since august 1

And guess what ? it just happen when I decided to go live with this system in regards to my July test.

Anyway nobody to blame here but me. I didn't look much at the SR levels when taking the trades and just thought "might get one looser but will get 2 or 3 winners" WRONG !

I think the system is still good and the month is not over anyway.

It 's just stupid overconfidence from me and I should look a bit more at the chart when taking a trade.

Also i often enter the trades late around 5 gmt instead of 00 GmT but it also saved me from a few bad trades.

Well, not bashing anybody or the system but just pointing out that there is no magic or miracle things, trade carefully.....

And thanks again Ash for sharing this system

--- 帖子 #2008 ---
Hi airx3000,

don´t worry, if trading was so easy, nobody would go to work for a salary.

I also started this month with real money, because i doubled my demo account, but what does it bring to me?

Now i am deep in minus, because i had holiday this week and i tried scalping, short trades with thrust on my feeling... well it was not such a good idea (more lost than wins).

I also made orders according to Ash´s Signals and closed them after some hours because they went in the wrong direction.

I (as a bginner with some months demo) think -patience- is the most important. There are periods everything goes against you. No system works and the trend seems to be your ennemy. That´s why 80% of the traders lose (as a friend and succesfull stock daytrader told me).

I knew a forex trader from Switzerland, a top man, doing this all his life long. He learned as a "runner" on the stock exchanges, before Internet existed, he was in wall street, europe, all the biggest ones. When i met him he had a own capital investment company, additionanlly he offered managed accounts and had millionaires as clients, but he also offered m.a. for little people, starting with $5000. I would have given him all what i head...

The problem was.. i didn´t have anything.

Good for me, because one year later he became insolvent, many millions were lost....

Just to see in which area we are moving! There are sharks all around you.

Don´t worry, perhaps the rest of this month will turn like in July, or september will.

I hope you are not risking more than 2 or 3% of your account with the trades. Then it doesn´t hurt so much if you lose some trades.

Look, AUD/CAD moved 100 pips down in the last hours!

So this must be positive in your list now!

@all: tomorrow i will leave for 2 weeks. I will travel to the south and have no internet (holidays). So i don´t bother you anymore with cartoons and stupid questions .

But as Schwarzenegger said... "i´ll be back"

Good bye and thank you for your help and funny times, good luck and lots of pips with your trades.

I ended up closing the first lot at +50 but will go ahead and leave the second lot open and see what happens next week.

Nice trading, femzy.

--- 帖子 #2014 ---
I'm not too sure about that. Both swissie and euro got battered against just about every other currency today, so at this point I'm not sure which is weaker. I guess I'll find out next week.

It's a deal.

--- 帖子 #2015 ---
Trade Update:eur/chf short: 1 lot closed at +50; 2nd lot is now at +39. If this trade can get moving, there's some potential for a decent trade. The lows have been getting lower since 5/9. If you run a fib from 3/17 to the high, the trend line corresponds just about exactly with a 38.2% fib retracement. If you instead run the fib from 4/10 to the high, the trend line corresponds with the 61.8% fib retracement.

Either way, that would bring us to a price of about 1.5975, which would be a cool 300 pips on this trade. Of course, it has a long way to go to hit that target, and both currencies really got clobbered against virtually all other currencies today, so it will be interesting to see if it drops.

I don't see any new AshFX trades that I'm excited about, so it looks like eur/chf will be my only trade going into next week.

--- 帖子 #2016 ---
Appreciate the update dude. Sorry to hear about the bad trades and glad to see your honesty in sharing them, since it's true, some people (not necessarily on this thread) just wanna boast about their winning trades.

This shows how important Support and Resistance is. In fact, I know a trader that trades EXCLUSIVELY off S/R lines.  No kidding.

Keep working at your trading. Tough nut to crack, but never give up. I know I could have given up many months ago, but kept at it.

--- 帖子 #2017 ---
Hey Airx, did you not take the Eur/Chf short?

--- 帖子 #2018 ---
Excellent analysis Yen, lets make this happen. Lost -150 pips on the Gbp/Chf trade, need to make it up somehow, hahaha

--- 帖子 #2019 ---
Well, to use a baseball analogy, aim for singles and just let the home runs happen. One pip at a time. I know most of the civilized world prefers soccer (football), but I have no idea how to translate that analogy.

--- 帖子 #2020 ---
Keep playing the short simple passes, and the goals will come.

--- 帖子 #2021 ---
Thank you! I knew Ash would come through in the ninth inning. Oh darn, I'm back to baseball analogies again.

--- 帖子 #2022 ---
You're testing me now Yen, sent me the wrong way.

--- 帖子 #2023 ---
Sorry, that last one came out of left field . . . oh, phooey, I did it again. No more baseball analogies.

Anyway, it was a good week for the AshFX system. I didn't take a lot of trades, but the ones I did take returned a profit of 244 pips. I'll gladly take that any week.

The one trade I still have open is the eur/chf short. I closed the first lot at +50 and the second lot ended the day at +46.

Here's a summary of this week's trades:

--- 帖子 #2024 ---
I just checked on airx3000 trades. Correct me if I am wrong. Aud/Cad Short Trade ,second strength as stock below 50.Entry.9724 Stop at swing high .9840 TP1 at .9653.. Stop never reached(highest candle.9812)TP1 hit on July 30.Eur/Jpy Short Trade, second strength as stock below 50. Entry at 167.43 Stop at a69.95 (swing high)Tp1 at 166.  ( Stop not reached high candle 169.46) Tp1 reached on 8/8. @nd lot toB/E. Chf/Yen not a trade as candle is bullish.Gbp/Chf 15 july trade a 199pip lossx2. 17th July in profit.

--- 帖子 #2025 ---
I think you're correct in every example you mentioned.

Of the four trades you noted, two should never have been taken per AshFX rules. That includes the CHF/JPY trade you mentioned, as well as the AUD/CAD trade. Both were short signals, but each had a bullish signal candle, so neither trade was valid.

If the stop loss rules for a Second Strength trade had been followed, the EUR/JPY trade would not have been stopped out just as you noted. The first lot would have closed at +97 and the second lot would now be about 190 pips up.

The other trade you mentioned was the GBP/CHF short. However, this was never a signal on FXDD charts, which is what Ash recommends for this system (http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&postcount=648), so this trade also would not have been taken had that suggestion been heeded.

This isn't meant to cast stones at airx3000 because it's easy to forget details in the heat of trading, but it does illustrate the importance of following the AshFX rules and recommendations to the letter for best results. In this case, it would have prevented some substantial losses.

Hi all

I know this thread is about manual trades and that there is a seperate thread for EA but it seems to me that maybe we should have a look at the two methods side by side for a second

I am mostly seeing bad reports for this system here on the 'manual' thread.

Meanwhile on my demo account which has no manual trading decsisions there has been positive results.

Very nice trading, andante.

One final thought before I get to bed because it's 1 a.m. here in Mexico. Come to think of it, what am I doing on FF at 1 am on a non-trading day? Note to self: Get a life.

Anyway, back to my final thought. Baseball's my favorite game, and I got kind of caught up in baseball cliches earlier, but this question really applies to any sport: Don't you just hate it when well-paid players dog it?

Good night and good trading!

You are so right except for Gbp/Chf on my FXDD platform shows Psar down,candle red,ac/ao red ,stock between 20-50.  Could you recheck for me please. I never would have taken this trade as too close to lower trend line. I would suggest to all to use a check list to clarify trades. As you can see it is easy to overlook  little details. Waterflame has given  us a remarkable method ,used with trendlines and discrection works wonders. http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

--- 帖子 #2033 ---
You are correct regarding the 7/15 trade. However, I believe airx3000 was referring to a different trade, because his post is commenting on his results since 8/1. I think the GBP/CHF short trade he was referring to was on 8/4 (check this link: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...postcount=1914).

However, that short signal never occurred on the FXDD chart. Apparently the signal appeared at some  brokers, but not on FXDD, which as noted before is the broker Ash recommends for AshFX signals. If FXDD signals had been used instead, the last signal on GBP/CHF was on 7/17, a long trade that proved to be profitable as shown on the attached chart.

Have you looked at www.babypips.com? They do a nice job of explaining trading basics. Here's a couple of their links that discuss support and resistance as well as Fibonacci:

http://www.babypips.com/school/suppo...esistance.html

Once you develop an eye for it, you should be able to note significant S & R on any chart with just a quick glance.

Good luck with it.

--- 帖子 #2036 ---
Thanks for clearing that up. Much better if every one used Fxdd. By the way  if you read this Ash my apoligies for  calling you Waterflame. Only other thread I use .http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon14.gif

--- 帖子 #2037 ---
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PROMPT REPLY, YEN. PLEASE I STILLL NEED TO CLARIFY SOME THING.

LIKE TAKING ACTIONFOREX PIVOT POINT AS AN EXAMPLE.

THEY GIVE PIVOT POINTS AS WELL AS FIRONACCI FIGURES.

ASSUMING THAT YOU ARE LIKELY TO GET THE TREND DIRECTION CORRECT,

DOES THAT MEANS THAT WHEN EVER THE FIGURES REACH OR CLOSE TO FIBONACCI POINTS, ITS LIKELY FOR RETRACEMENT TO OCCUR?

THAT IS WHAT I AM NOT RELY CLEAR ABOUT.

--- 帖子 #2038 ---
You're asking about a specific company, and I know nothing about them, so I don't feel comfortable answering that question, adeforex.

I will tell you my experience. I did not do well at all trading with pivot points. That doesn't mean there's not any merit to them; I just never felt confident using them. Other traders, conversely, swear by pivot points. You need to find the "shoe" that's comfortable for you. In other words, find a style of trading that fits you and that you will feel comfortable with.

In regard to fib points, my suggestion to you would be to practice and observe how price reacts around the various fib lines, and then incorporate that into your trading style.

In general, I do much better not relying on information provided by outside sources, but that's just my personal opinion. The things I look at in deciding on a trade are strong support and resistance areas, as well as fib and trend lines. I don't make it a lot more complicated than that.

--- 帖子 #2039 ---
thank you yen.i really appreciate your assistance.sorry to bother you one more time.i am trying to build my system and not depend on anyone as you have said.i have read babypips on related subjectmy trouble is  how can i use fibonacci tools on metatrader to know what to plot as you traders are doin it by supporting it with support and resistance level.please am sorry if this is not a good question to ask but am still learning and i want to make more money

--- 帖子 #2040 ---
Adeforex, to be honest, you're asking this question in the wrong thread.  I do encourage everyone to study S/R and Fibs, and I applaud you for your efforts to learn it, but I think that is beyond the scope of this thread.

Please don't take this in the wrong way, but maybe you can ask in the rookie section?

--- 帖子 #2041 ---
Evening All

I see the below trades for tomorrow.

EurGbp - Short

EurJpy - Short

EurCad - Short

These are all SS trades and the stop loss on the first two will be quite big. I prefer the EurCad trade.

What do you guys think?

--- 帖子 #2042 ---
I see all of these too. With regard to EUR/CAD - it would appear to be just above the long term trend line (since Oct 2007) which makes me nervous.

All of them have cons against them in terms of S/R too. Still thinking whether to trade any of them TBH!

--- 帖子 #2043 ---
Hi Guys,

As i try to get used to this system and apply it correctly, i would require assistance from ye noble and wise men. I would like to get your opinions to decide if my interpretations of what i see are consistent with the system.

As we await the opening of a new trading week (FXDD Brokers), i think i see the following, for which i humbly ask your sincere evaluation:

Eur/Jpy: New Psar Dot appeared on the top of the 080808 candle, candle in question closed short, stoch below 50 line but not at the 20 line, AO & AC are in red. Isn't this what the system refered to as a SS entry signal? Is it a valid one by the rules, or are there other things i am not noticing?

Eur/Cad & Chf/Jpy: Psar above candle. Candle closed short, stochs are down, but the Ac and Ao are not in full agreement; do these also qualify?

Please give me your sincere evaluations. ASH, YEN, i hope you are there? ... and of course, everyone else.

--- 帖子 #2044 ---
I see what you mean, although there is also strong resistance in the 16200 area which is forming a tight wedge. Its got to break either way. I think I favour down as the Euro is under pressure currently.

--- 帖子 #2045 ---
Correct on EUR/JPY and also see EUR/GBP - similar set up. EUR/CAD is correct too as AO is still green but qualifies as SS. CHF/JPY not acceptable as AC is green.

--- 帖子 #2046 ---
You are correct about Eur/Jpy and EurCad but according to the rules its only AO that doesn't have to be compliant so as far as i know Chf/Jpy would not be a trade based on this system

--- 帖子 #2047 ---
All three SS trades have gapped down at the open increasing risk, decreasing reward.   Most noticeable on EUR/CAD & EUR/JPY.  I'm staying out, hope something better turns up tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #2048 ---
Think you are correct. Still have the EUR/CHF trade from last week to keep my interest!

--- 帖子 #2049 ---
Yes i see EurCad has gapped about 100 pips!! I think it will retrace first. I won't be entering this now. Will wait to see how far it retraces

--- 帖子 #2050 ---
I was just preparing for the week ahead and noticed that at 22:00 GMT Sunday 10 August, the EUR price gapped down it opened massively below previous closes on several pairs.

I was looking at SS trades on several EUR pairs using this system but, although I am a beginner, I believe that gapping isn't good when about to place a trade.  I am staying out of any trades.

Am I right or wrong to be so cautious?

--- 帖子 #2051 ---
Maybe you can wait until a retrace back to at least last weeks close, then enter.  I'll probably miss it coz I gotta get some sleep.  I stayed up just so I could witness this debacle.  lol.  Oh well, good luck all.

On second thoughts I'd probably still stay out even with a retrace.

--- 帖子 #2052 ---
You are perfectly correct. Best to stay out if you are not sure. I'm going to watch for a while before doing anything. I think there is going to be a lot of volatility especially with what has been going on this weekend in Georgia

Great trade for anyone that took it, but looking back we managed to talk ourselves out of it.

Have a look from http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...postcount=1635 forward for a few pages and you will see why! (Sorry Yen, not pointing out your post specifically just that it was the start of the discussion about this trade).

I think we rejected it for all the right reasons but this time those reasons didn't work out. Tough luck but good luck to anyone who had the foresight to take it.

If long was taken somedays back;IMHO long could still be valid upto test fib price at 2.0806

--- 帖子 #2072 ---
Regarding GBP/CHF, you're right, femzy, that was a long signal back on July 17. The exit, per AshFX rules, would have been on 8/5 when AO turned red.

--- 帖子 #2073 ---
No problem, James. I try not to dwell on the trades I don't take. Like you, I thought my reasoning was sound at the time, so I'll try not to beat myself up too bad. One thing that makes it easier is that the AshFX trades I have decided to take over the last few weeks have generally worked out well.

--- 帖子 #2074 ---
Precisely, if you didn't think a trade was worth the risk at the time due to valid reasons that have kept you successful so far, then it's all good.

--- 帖子 #2075 ---
Hi Ash

While there is a quiet moment you mentioned before about

the MM side of the trade being about £1 x  2 lots and There seems to be

at least 1 trade  a week with a MM of 3% loss acceptable  would that

require a pot of around £15000  .

--- 帖子 #2076 ---
thanks yen, and ashfx, others:i think i understand how to use support and resistance with fibonacci retracement. also how to plot them on my chat now. thanks again.you challenged me to learn it and i got into it.

keep this thread active so that we can keep learning from your analysis.

--- 帖子 #2077 ---
Ok, this is my personal opinion. Others can mention theirs if they wish...

£15k is decent is you're trading part-time and have a job. Heck, any amount is fine if you've got a job. (As long as you don't risk a large % of your equity on each trade of course.)

If you want to quit work and trade full-time, FOR A LIVING, then I would recommend £20,000 initial capital. And this £20k has to be money you can afford to lose.

3% risk is relatively high. Try to lower it to 2%.

Freddi

--- 帖子 #2080 ---
Not sure what price it would need to get to to change AC to red (I'll take your word for it at 2.0595). However, I don't think the AO will change at that level. If AC changes alone then it's a SS trade....I think.

--- 帖子 #2081 ---
It's not valid....yet.

No valid trades for today in my opinion.

--- 帖子 #2092 ---
What broker are you taking your setup from?

--- 帖子 #2093 ---
I might be wrong on my GBPCHF short judgement call as i didnt see that the psar has crossed since yesterday

--- 帖子 #2094 ---
am using FXDD.

ALSO MY ALPARI CONFIRM IT.

I ENTERED IMMEDIATLY I SAW THE PSAR CHANGING DIRECTION

--- 帖子 #2095 ---
Thanks Ash

--- 帖子 #2096 ---
My PSAR switched on yesterday's bar. The AC had not changed to short yet and the Stoch had not crossed from a technical point of view.

--- 帖子 #2097 ---
Femzy,

As to whether these are valid trades and not if we plan to take them;

What do you think about the candle on the USDJPY? Is it in the wrong direction?

Also will the Stoch make the GBPCHF trade a SS trade?

It may be a bit early for me to look at the trades but I happen to be playing at the moment.

--- 帖子 #2098 ---
What do you think about the candle on the USDJPY? Is it in the wrong direction?

Yes i think it is the wrong direction as it is bullish..

Also will the Stoch make the GBPCHF trade a SS trade?

I wont trade as it might be late already IMHO.The candle is too long and might be looking for a retracement.Also the trade doesn't satisfy the rules too.

--- 帖子 #2099 ---
Hi guys, would the USD/JPY signal still be considered a valid one if the candle closes long? Also, I don't know what you think, but hasn't the GBP/CHF taken a long nose-dive? wouldn't this mean a downward thrust may be exhausting?

--- 帖子 #2100 ---
Hi guys,

EUR/GBP seems a valid signal according to Ash's rules, but the signal candle has shot out way too high for one day; wouldn't this mean caution?

--- 帖子 #2101 ---
The candle is long (green) at the moment which is the problem. If it closes red then it would be a valid signal.

Even if it did close red I won't take it as it looks like it has broken through resistance at around 10840 and come back to test that level and got rejected so is now providing strong support.

--- 帖子 #2102 ---
The USDJPY trade would not be valid. In the PDF file Ash states for a short trade we need a bearish candle. As far as the other two trades I was discussing them from a technical point of view. I am usually wrong when I try to predict if a trend will continue. I agree with you that the GBPCHF has moved a long way.

--- 帖子 #2103 ---
Hi,

sorry for my english

the trades for today I am type headache.

usyen-stoch too high, 1day-4h-1h bullish;

gbchf-psar yesterday changed, moving too strong;

eurgb movement too much, possibly entry by 0.7937.

I will probably not act.

--- 帖子 #2104 ---
USDJPY is not a valid signal.

EURGBP is valid. My overall view is that it is above 200sma and if it breaks the flag it is in, the move will be huge. The size of the pole.

GBPCHF is not a valid signal, and is at the trendline. If it breaks and retraces, and another signal, it will be significant, It is below 200sma.

LR

--- 帖子 #2105 ---
so you are giong long GBPCHF or not.

--- 帖子 #2106 ---
GBPCHF I mentioned is not a valid signal. How can I go long or short?

One needs to look at price action as a whole and look for the overall trend direction with S/R and when valid Ashfx signals present then enter the trade.

S/R: trendlines, S/R areas( Use weekly charts for daily charts and draw them ), fibonacci, pivots, 20,50,100,200sma/ema are all valid S/R .Whatever the individual trader feels comfortable !

Do your analysis of price action on the higher timeframe and enter on the lower timeframe. Even exit on a timeframe lower than theone you entered.

Many good exit strategies have been mentioned throughout the thread. A simple one is draw a trendline in the direction of the trade entered and exit when price breaks that trendline.

Hope this helps.

LR

With all due respect dude, that is one crap broker.

I have drawn my PRICE ACTON lines on the WEEKLY chart and then  moved to  a DAILY chart ;one can see the weekly PRICE ACTION lines plus added a simple fibonanci study. I have drawn an eclipse area showing a STRONG area of SUPPORT at the confluence of 61.8% retracement of the whole recent uptrend,100 & 200 MA  and recent Resistance turn support. One would therefore expect that the potential price should find support in the zone of the eclipse.

If it goes through that then of couuse one is expecting the price to reach the uptrendline .

BROKERS: I have been informed that ALpari(UK) do not have a SUNDAY candle. I have not yet compared the ASHFX signals receive from FXDD (recommended for ASHFX) to see whether they are the same on alpari(UK).

Alpari(UK) seem to have P/L compared to IBFX, not sure about FXDD as yet.Alpari(UK) allow micro and mini accounts and trade in several major curriencies other than USD. Some see this as advantageous as EURO is the currency of the future. Major banks are moving their reserves from US$ to euro and gold. We also read than IRAn for the past year or so want OIL to be quoted in EURO's nor US$. So the  international pressures go on like a dug-a -war and domination of the US$ in the future.

US$ INDEX and gold relationship is inverse: This means that because gold is correcting at present the US$ is moving up (TEMPORARILY??). This is reflecting the USD based currencires too.

Alpari(UK) have shown to give BETTER P/L than IBFX feeds.

Attached is my price analysis of weekly chart and daily chart.

Weekly chart shows  the current signal on daily chart as a retracement of the downtrend when it hit the 61.8% retracement of uptrend + an area of strong support.

Daily chart shows a valid Ashfx signal of this retracement. I have drawn a simple retracement study of current trend. At around 61.8% retracement of this  daily downtrend there seems to be some cluster of resistence.

a)Near weekly downtrend and

b)daily resistant zone.

Plenty of room for this trade to move UP. Watch the stochastics when it is in the OB zone and where price hits the fibonanci lines. (I woiuld exit there)

I have done my price action analysis on weekly and daily charts.

I have attached 3 charts: a) longterm weekly the way I see it.

b) weekly chart c) daily chart.

Weekly chart: downtrend, retraced at the 38.2% and now currently resumes its downtrend. Broken the uptrendline.(corrective wave UP). I see  HEADS & SHOULDER (H&S)PATTERN and done some fib expansion and fib extension studies for potential profit targets. THE very longterm P/T coincies with the H&S target projection of ~$75.00-$77.00. Let us see what happens. P/T cluster of FExpansion(61.8%) and FExtension(161.8%) of ~$90.00 is shown.

Daily chart: The AshFX  SS signal is a retracement of the downtrend. The R:R and resistance seen does not indicate a good trade.

Comments welcome,

Question about stops:

One part of the PDF says use the candle's high/low as the stop, another part says use the swing lo/swing hi as the stop, these are potentially two different price points, so which do we use?

--- 帖子 #2139 ---
If you read the manual again the answer is there. There are two kinds of trades and each has a different stoploss . There is plenty of post in this thread that explains it.

If still cannnot work  it out, ask again.I am only trying to promote better self learning not trying to be difficult.

--- 帖子 #2140 ---
Ah alright, that was what I thought but I wasn't sure because using 2 different stop losses seems kind of strange.  In any case I will manually backtest this system and suit it to my own needs before trading it.

well,it appears to be ss trade, but if you have the got, you may hang in till new candle opens.the market has been ranging from 8th of aug, but it was able to move down by around 50pips before retracing,in a couple of days ahead, i think it can still go down by 300pips.(just think so)
due to strong support clustering around fibo 61.0

please ,let the analyst do their work.

I have done some price analysis on wkly and daily charts. I personally would wait to follow the Ashfx rules and see the candle at the EOD.Price has bounced off(down) from the resistance we see on the weekly. The next day or so will tell it all. I agree with your Cluster of support zone.

USDCHF will soon be back at 1.20 levels, and as far as i know it will become a carry trade in Q2 of 2009, so keep trading and making lots of $$$

hey guys,

what do you think of NZD/USD. Still valid to take a long?

--- 帖子 #2158 ---
what is ASH SS?

--- 帖子 #2159 ---
Hi

Dont forget when the psar forms above the candle it has to be bearish not bullish candle as in your chart.

--- 帖子 #2160 ---
thats what i mean, i shall wait for new candle and see.it should be ss trade for ashrule if its whot trading.few hours from now will tell

--- 帖子 #2161 ---
Before I backtest this system, does anyone have a rough figure of what the max drawdown has been in backtests?

--- 帖子 #2162 ---
i understand. the candle is bearish in the chat.look at it well.check your fxdd, then the stoch is crossing down,iao red, ac, red. so it follows ashrule,

the next candle will tell if it is going to be ss trade

--- 帖子 #2163 ---
You are wrong Ade as the candle on FXDD is green(bullish);that makes it invalid according to Ash FX rule.Either as an FS or SS trade.

You don't need to force the trade.Just let it pass;another one will always come.

I am in a small long cadjpy will add lower as I feel 106 is ver likely

Can you share your PRICE ACTION ANALYSIS in a chart to show your reason why you think CADJPY will reach 106.00.

Also your reason for 1.2000 and USDCHF and eurusd at the 1.4000 zone.

Thanks,

--- 帖子 #2175 ---
did anyone compile a record of trades, winners/losers since they started trading this system ?

--- 帖子 #2176 ---
There is some performance results through the thread. However, while the entry signals are clearly used and discussed for entry, many traders use different exit strategies. It is best you do your own performance  forward testing and perhaps share on the forum with exact details you use in terms of rules.

Feedback welcome.

--- 帖子 #2181 ---
No i disagree as PSAR changed last night with a bullish candle!

--- 帖子 #2182 ---
I think you should test the system yourself. If you are thinking of trading the system live you will need the practice. I'm sure you don't want to trade real money on a system based on what other people say.

I doubt you will find more than a couple of members that would agree 100% on every trade. (We may come to a consensus by discussing a trade on this thread) The rules look straight forward at first glance until you consider we take support and resistance into the trade decision. There can also be a different view on FS and SS trades. A cross on the stoch can look like a FS trade just viewing it. It can dictate a SS by a small amount if you use the data window to determine the stoch and signal level. Some members even use different brokers like Alpari or IBFX. They will end up with different trades and results. Perhaps with testing they may find a way to more profitable taking the signal from a broker with a day that starts closer to 00:00 GMT. I don't know. I use FXDD because it is the default broker the system was started on.

It is important to trade the system in a way that has proved profitable to you in your forward testing.

--- 帖子 #2183 ---
I agree.

Would it be a valid trade if the AC had just changed even if the PSAR had changed several days ago? I am asking based on what Ash said in the Final Points section of the PDF. Where he says 'it does not matter in which order the indicators may line up'.

I also saw no new trades today.

--- 帖子 #2184 ---
Hey Guys,   Need your help.  In post 1 there are several attachments. If it's a pdf it will open for me, otherwise I get a box that says Windows Can't Open this. What do I need to do or install on my computer so I can read or download the information. I got that post the other day here for the Chart Timer and couldn't open it either. Need your help. Please give me the link or what I need to do. Thanks  Eric  BigE/Oregon

--- 帖子 #2185 ---
I totally agree with you. While the strategy looks mechanical and there are several people who have programmed EA's for the strategy, there is definitely a large degree of TRADER"S DISCRETION whether one places the trade or not. This is the S& R zones that traders use which is open for variation. EA's do not pick this up but certainly a great tool to alert you of a possible trade.
Money management is an area too which comes under TRADER"S DISCRETION too.(TRAILING STOPS: USE PSAR TO TRAIL, OR FIXED NUMBER OF PIPS TO TRAIL, FIXED STOPLOSS to give a few variations).

If you are talking about the *.tpl file, that is a template file. It is used by MetaQuotes' Metatrader 4. It is a trading platform that is available for free as a demo platform.

You do not open the *.tpl file. Just save it to your computer. Save it to the c:\program files\FXDD - Metatrader4\templates folder. Re-start the platform and right mouse click on your chart and select template and choose the file you saved. (This is one of several ways to apply a template.)

The chart timer is an indicator file you would save it to the c:\program files\FXDD - Metatrader4\experts\indicators folder. You can attach it to the chart from the MT4 navigator window or other ways.

Note: your folder name will vary if you do not use FXDD for your demo account or if you install the MT4 program to a non-standard directory.

--- 帖子 #2187 ---
FOREXMOMENTS: Please confirm the above  scenario whether it is  a valid signal . My understanding was that PSAR is the final indicator that had to line up with bullish/bearish candle, AO&AC& STOCHASTICS. The trade entered on the next candle after PSAR flips when the rest of the indicators line up(These indicators can line up in any order).

THANKS,

it seems to me that there are going to be a buy oppertunity in eur/usd, do anybody think so? Ac and Ao are green and stoch crossed! we just need parabolicsar's and candels's closing ! is it right?

--- 帖子 #2190 ---
Yes Sir!

--- 帖子 #2191 ---
If trading daily charts, this is a counter trend trade to weekly downtrend.

It has given a LONG signal on the 4h charts already. The AO also shows a great bullish divergence. There is confluence of support around the 23% and 38% fib retracement zone on daily charts . Area to watch for P/T when the Psar flips on the daily chart.

because i only have 12 :|

I have 19 pairs without counting metals and mex.  See post #:2178  for info on how to add more. See the pairs you should have below.

--- 帖子 #2196 ---
Thanks for pointing me to the correct previous post ljr on the clarification.

It is clear that I had the correct understanding. It just re-reforced my learning.

I joined this thread recently and spent several days reading all the posts. It takes a while to understand everything in the manual correctly.

Many traders are using this strategy with their own trading style (TRADER"S DISCRETION) and so am I.

It is a great daily strategy ,easy to implement when trading with the higher timeframe prespective in mind. I mean looking at higher tF trend, S&R and entry on daily.

Thanks again.

LR

--- 帖子 #2197 ---
I agree,  I am watching to see how the trade pans out.Regular  bullish divergence as seen on te 4h chart is  only indicating change in trend. The pipnailerFX and ASHFX and my own strategy have all given the entry signal on the 4h charts.

I am more inclined to enter of a daily chart signal and exit when possible on 4h chart exit signal, if I am around. Other wise just even exit on the daily signal.

I like to trail my stops at valleys in LONG positions and viceversa on SHORTS.

The initial stoploss  as per manual is good.

What to you use in your trading?

Personally guys, I am not gonna take the Eur/Chf trade (I actually went long on market open on Sunday night). There are strong trend-lines resistances on H1 and H4.

I actually anticipate some ranging, and possibly bearish movement for the remainder of the week.

Your long EUR/CHF trade is based on what?

He was anticipating that the PSAR would flip. It didn't, however.

What you guys think?

--- 帖子 #2214 ---
I agree with the items you list. The current candle is barely positive at the moment. Since we make our judgment off the closed daily candle it is hard to say what the candle direction and PSAR will look like in 14 hours.

--- 帖子 #2215 ---
Will be valid at the start of the next candle????

Needs a green candle.

Coming off trendline and minor support.

Also at 23.6 and 38.2 Fibs.

Very oversold on weekly.

Worth watching?

Gbp/Usd  looks like coming into an ASH trade.

At 61.8 Fib.  retracement .

Could see a good pullback towards 200ma.

Any thoughts on this???

yes, only thing needed right now for it to be a valid signal is for the PSAR to be below the candle

yeah but you should have waited for Candle's close IMHO

All are valid for Ash's trades.

As oil soars up by $5 in the past 2and  half weeks and USD loosing strength.Those calls should definitely win at least on the short term.

A good call.

I would take all these trades at candles close...Till then...Lets see

--- 帖子 #2224 ---
i think there are many pairs close to ash rules trade potentially. but we must strictly let all of them be 100% valid signals according to ash rules so that we can access the performance of this thread. for those that have entered one trading or the order, without ash rules need not post them here,as they may be using other trading methods to execute a trade:we need not cconfuse those that are new to the thread. just a suggestion

Irathi -  Where did you get the software for the info on the right side of your charts?   Thanks,  Eric

--- 帖子 #2231 ---
What I got from the PDF was that we only exit at the CLOSE of a candle, correct?  Has anyone tested this system where you place the break-even stop even during the middle of the candle, or is everything always done at the close?

--- 帖子 #2232 ---
I see the same trade possibilities as Femzy112.

Eelfranz, I believe Irathi has creatively used the description field of the MT4 fib tool to get those number.

BBPI_fxtrader, No need to apologize here. I think we have all posted early at times and I have certainly been wrong or jumped into a trade too soon.

--- 帖子 #2233 ---
Correct. This system is based upon the closing of a candle (unless TP or SL is hit before that of course).  I haven't tested what you suggested.

--- 帖子 #2234 ---
And probably USDCAD shortAsh and others whats the analysis on each of these pairs. All looks good to me. The cable will probably join tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #2235 ---
So if the first TP is hit during the middle of the day, then price retraces under it, I still shouldn't put a stop on breakeven, but rather wait for price to form a daily close above TP?

--- 帖子 #2236 ---
Ahh right, I see what you're getting at.

As soon as the first TP is hit, then you move the SL to BE.

Hope that clarifies.

--- 帖子 #2237 ---
Yes it does, thank you.

--- 帖子 #2238 ---
There is no signal for USD/CAD.

--- 帖子 #2239 ---
Are you refering to the clock? It is an indicator of which is available under the attachment(Paperclip) of the thread.

If referring to the detail of the fib tool. After you draw a fib  line study,in the FIB LEVELS tab.....Go to the description area... after eg.0.0 type in @%$. If you want to tpye anything else like I have (MONTH<WEEK<DAILY...),this is where you can do so! GREAT feature!.

Hope this helps.

If you are referring to me as "analyst in the house". I am only a student of forex. I like the TOP DOWN Approach.

Please feel free to comment and share your thoughts too. I am a believer the fibonanci studies. ( For those interested to learn I suggest google NEAL HUGHES/fibmaster).

Yes USDJPY is in an UPTREND channel. WeeKly shows a strong resistance at 61.8% retracement . See chart.

On the DAILY CHART: Yes there is a valid ASHFX signal and *pipnailerfx signal (on FXDD feed). There is a R:R=1:1.34. If those traders think this is OK, there os ~190pips in the trade using my cluster of support shown on the chart.

*Please note this pipnailer signal on FDXX feed which is not the recommended broker for pipnailer signals, IBFX feed is recommended. Also, I know this is the forum to discuss ASHFX signals. Apologise if I offend by mentioning pipnailfx signals on this forum. The creator for both is the same and I look at both pipnailer and ashfx signals if they synchronise (perhaps in the believe of a higher probability trade)

Greetings  OZ Chuckb,

You are welcome with info. I see what you mean now about 23% and 38% and trendline. One is from Weekly chart and the other from daily TF.

I find these fib clusters so predictable as S&R zones.

Thought I would add my dollar index price analysis on weekly and daily charts in relation to ASHFX signals.

One can see why the USD based currencies are doing what they are doing. $79.00 seems to be a strong resistance.

--- 帖子 #2256 ---
Hi,

I suppose UsdChf should be a 2nd strength trade, where u shouldn't stop out yet?

--- 帖子 #2257 ---
GBPUSD is still  not a valid trade on FXDD platform(recommended broker as it does not have a SUNDAY CANDLE). Should not have entered the trade.

The rest are all SS trades. The direction of EURUSD,AUDUSD,GBPUSD is UP,  USDCHF and USDJPY is SHORT.

Depending on your leverage and account balance, if your account can handle it lower or higher your stops. The trades should make profit. Yes the drawdown is high because it is the daily TF.

If either of the stochastic lines are above or below 50 line it is considered an SS trade.( This is my understanding). STOPLOSS placement according to manual.

LR

--- 帖子 #2258 ---
You are right, but with all these trades the weekly charts are the reverse, so we are counter trend trading,

--- 帖子 #2259 ---
Perfectly correct, They are all countertrend trades for the weekly TF. Being daily charts and most of these moves were large, these particular countertrends are expected to at least 38% retracement of the move. Even maybe 50% or 61.8% retracement.Therefore for the aggressive trader, these will translate into many pips.

Some traders trade countertrends, others will trade lower timeframes eg. swingtraders will look at the daily charts for the trend and trade 1h/30m charts in the direction of the daily trend.

It depends on the trading plan for the individual trader and the TF they choose to trade.

Ashfx signals work best on daily TF but will translate to pips in the lower TF.

Several traders use Ashfx as signals with other filters.

Hi all here..

I like this system becuse it is so easy and clear ..

it is very profitabel BUT it's foulse signels killed trader..

So i think we have to work hard to get filter in order to avoide that killer signal..

I hope to find that filter.

Thanks all Here

--- 帖子 #2261 ---
Hi All,

I am also in very high negative pips with the Aud/Usd & Eur/Usd so lets see what happens next week

Talking about filters what about one that i nicked from another forum and if i would have had this indicator on both the Au/us & Eu/Us i would not have taken the trade

Open up an RSI indicator window with default settings then darg the willaims percentage indicator on top of the RSI window again with default settings

Make sure that the williams % is applied to previuous indicators data and thats it

When the willaims % range crossing over and above the RSI then go long and visa versa, obviosly usibg R/S & trendlines etc

I am trying it this next couple of weeks to see what it does

Thanks

--- 帖子 #2262 ---
please i want to know ,does AC and AO repaints. iam bactesting some pairs and i just want to be sure

--- 帖子 #2263 ---
no it does not

--- 帖子 #2264 ---
The easiest filter would have been to use the weekly as the trend, this being the case all these trades were just a little early for the imminent trend change via the weekly, in saying that all the trades will come right as long as one can tolerate the back up for a while.

--- 帖子 #2265 ---
AC Repaints . Forget that one. AO is better. Does not repaint quickly

--- 帖子 #2266 ---
This was borderline for me as I place my trades 2hrs before candle close.

Actually, none of them repaint.

--- 帖子 #2268 ---
Why take every trade.  Some stood out and some to me were high risk. This is not the holy grail.The markets will go up down or sideways at any time.  Ash's method gives us the likelyhood of a trend change,nothing more.

Are you risking too much capital .

Personaly if I was to take all of those I would be in at 5% max.

I lost less than 1% on the UsdChf

http://img301.imageshack.us/img301/3...dusddh0.th.gif

if you would have taken the trade on the 23 of july(upper yellow line) - was an ash signal, and would have closed the trade on 20 august, when the downtrend lost steam, and a new signal was about to be formed you would have:

sold at: 0.9719

closed at: 0.8729

and made 990 pips profit, and that's just one pair.

quit your whining, be a man, accept the loss, and i hope you learned that proper money management is essential.

i also lost on those trades(although i did not close them yet, will see tomorrow), but i use proper money management, so i don't care if i lose some, i will always come back.

you have to understand that forex is not a get rich quick system.

if you use proper money management, you will not get rich quick, but then again you will also not go broke . give it time by using mm and you will see how nicely it compounds

--- 帖子 #2270 ---
Actualy this looks interesting. Looking back it certainly filters  out a lot  trades both good and bad.

I will forward test this over a few months  as back testing  is not the same as what you see at the end of the day.

Why dont you try it and share your results on the forum!

Eur/Chf SS Long.

I Agree,  in addition to your reasons above (TICKS IN THE BOX FOR NO TRADE)the weekly stochastics is down, it has been trading in a range for a while on the daily. I would wait to break the range either way before entering a trade on the daily TF. The weekly trendline is down at present.

That Eur/Chf mail you got from me was last weeks call. I.e. last Sunday was a perfect time to go long on it. Would have made decent pips. The SS Trade you're seeing now is kinda risky with a large stop.

--- 帖子 #2285 ---
GBPUSD seems to be signaling a short entry. but then again, there is holiday today in the uk and low volatility expected...

--- 帖子 #2286 ---
Currently at strong support.

A short at this time high risk.

A long signal would be nice.http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon7.gif

I agree, at strong support.  Wkly stochastic is oversold.

--- 帖子 #2289 ---
GBPUSD would not have been a good trade. would one have entered it, he/she would have been at around -100 pips by now

--- 帖子 #2290 ---
anyone else keeping an eye on these ?

EURAUD

AUDJPY

NZDUSD

AUDNZD

--- 帖子 #2291 ---
Had a look just now.

Aud Nz so far looks good.

Look at the weekly for the others .

--- 帖子 #2292 ---
Eur Aud at resistance

Nz Usd at support

--- 帖子 #2293 ---
I agree.

LR

--- 帖子 #2294 ---
Aud Nz  should continue on uptrend...Has potential.

Others  would look good with an opposite signal?

--- 帖子 #2295 ---
I made a manual backtest.

1. I entered every signal without looking at S/R

2. I calculated the spread and 3 pips of slippage for every trade

3. I considered only primary exchanges

4. I made 2 backtests: the first one is without any filter and the second with a 200SMA filter (above the 200 only long and below only short)

Here are the (interesting) results:

There are 2 trades still pending (USD/JPY and NZD/USD)

P.s. sorry for my english (I'm italian)

--- 帖子 #2296 ---
yes interesting results. Thanks.

How do you interpret the major diffeence in results between USDCHF and EURUSD knowing that normally these pairs are highly correlated?

And by the way if you want to add results from different pairs you need to first transform the pips in $ or € because the pip values are different depending on the pair and you cannot add pips.

Hello.

Is PSAR indicator repaints???

1 minute after midnight psar dot was below price.

Now is above

Sorry about my bad english.

PS

Take a look on screenshot.

--- 帖子 #2298 ---
The PSAR does not re-paint.

I'm not sure what broker's chart you are showing but it does not look like a new day has started. The psar dot can change back and forth until the day closes. The server/chart time on any broker's MT4 platform will only agree with the local time in one time zone of the world. For example FXDD the default MT4 charts we use in this thread will not start a new day for another 2 hours and 15 minutes from the time of this post. Which is GMT +3. Until then the dot, along with the AC, AO, and Stoch may continue to change.

--- 帖子 #2299 ---
psar does not repaint. However, if the range of the bar is big enough in each direction, thats just the way it is.

--- 帖子 #2300 ---
Hi

The PSAR will change during the day but will not change after the daily candle is finished. The daily candle will only finish at 21h00 GMT on FXDD which is still 2 hours to go.

--- 帖子 #2301 ---
Hi all. Do you still think in favor of AUD/NZD? The candle seems to be pushing it's way down more and more

--- 帖子 #2302 ---
I see these probable signals today, and will put here to discuss.

--- 帖子 #2303 ---
I wanted to post this trade I took using this system. I am up over 1400 pips-- real money.

--- 帖子 #2304 ---
Happy for you on this good trade. You have presented your own glory but nothing more. However, in terms of Ashfx,

1. Where did you enter?

2. I notice this is ibfx and not fdxx? Did you use fdxx signal and enter on IBFX? Where on the chart? Please place vertical line.

3. When are you planning to exit? According to Ashfx rules this was a few days ago on the fxdd platform.

4. What is your exit rule since you are not using Ashfx rules.

5. Traders on this forum are trying to learn the Ashfx trades and variations others use for a two way learning experience.

Thanks,

LR

--- 帖子 #2305 ---
It has been mentioned several times on this thread that different broker feeds results in different signals. Also that fxdd feed is the one to enter as this is the recommended broker feed. You have put your SIG charts up before, and so what comments are you expecting from Ashfx traders of the forum? You have not placed any of your own analysis and with a different broker feed, what discussion do you expect?

What do you think? Are these trades good, bad, indifferent? The method says use Supprt and resistance lines to decided R:R (GOOD OR BAD TRADES)? I see no  attempt of support and resistance lines on your charts nor R:R ratios.

WHERE IS THE ATTEMPT TO FOLLOW RULES?

WHERE IS THE ATTEMPT FOR SELF LEARNING?

WHY ASK OTHERS FOR COMMENTS WHEN YOU HAVE NOT PROVIDED YOURS IN THE FIRST PLACE TO INITIATE A discussion?

WHAT ARE YOUR EXPECTATIONS OF THE FORUM?

FROM MY POINT OF VIEW.... PROVIDE FXDD CHARTS AND INITIATE DISCUSSION WITH YOUR COMMENTS.

THANKS,

LR

Take a look at the weekly chart, everything there keeps you out of this trade.

Take it easy. I was posting it as accolades to Ash. Here are the answers to your questions.

1. You can see from the chart.

2. Yes

3. This is where I change the system slightly. I exit the first half per system. The second half is exit by moving the SL everyday to the high/low of the previous bar.

4. See answer above

5. Relax forex is a job. If you do not have fun at your job find another job.

Thanks for the answers. I am not a mind reader. Your original chart shows entry many candles after the Ashfx signal and no clear exit rules. I think your response to N0.5 is sarcastic and not appreciated.

LR

--- 帖子 #2314 ---
I rate your response 1/10. No answers to my other questions.

It seems you want to make very little effort in initiating a discussion and wait to pick others brains.

LR

--- 帖子 #2315 ---
what is with the tone ?

in all your responses you seemed, hm, angry. chill

--- 帖子 #2316 ---
lol, better you find one real job or buy on beer and relax.

Why are you so angry?

--- 帖子 #2317 ---
Not angry just disappointed that some traders contribute so much to the forum and others sit back and happy to enjoy the friuts.

LR

--- 帖子 #2318 ---
Angry: NO

Disappointment: Yes.

LR

--- 帖子 #2319 ---
First, better read all posts before judge anyone here.

Second, if you use fibos to predice trades using this system, read many posts ago and see who introduced

There's one topic to discuss , if you not interested in discuss sit ,relax, get one beer, watch tv or ignore theys

--- 帖子 #2320 ---
I think we are all enjoying the fruits of Ash's hard work.

Think about all the people that have tried the system without making any posts. There is no reason to be disappointed in anyone that has made a post here. Everyone participates in their own way. Sometimes I get frustrated with certain posts but that is part of the interaction on a public forum. I'm sure I've made posts that were annoying to other members. If people ask a poorly worded question or if you think people are trying to pick your brain just don't answer. Someone else will usually jump into the discussion.

--- 帖子 #2321 ---
FINAL POINTS:
Also,look out for key Support and Resistance points. In my humble opinion,S/R should be part of every trader's arsenal, as should fibonacci. If you don't really comprehend S/R & fibs. then my advice would be to educate yourselves on these vital cogs of trading- they will make your decisions that much more powerful, ......

I feel in the longer term, there is more down movement to meet primary uptrendline (see wkly charts)

Chuckb: What is the multiple timeframe indicator on your charts? TRO COMPASS? Any restrictions for sharing on forum?

EURUSD, GBPUSD,AUDUSD seems to have hit major support too.(RETRACEMENTS due) . I like chfjpy for long tomorrow if ASHFX signal all continue to line up.

Hello party people

i m back from my beautifull holiday in south France!

I even saw burros on the way, i wanted to make photos, but the camera was behind.

Where is Yen by the way?

Ok, so let´s make good trades now for the rest of this year with Ash´s System!

Grüße aus München

ricki

--- 帖子 #2340 ---
Welcome back from your holiday.

Yen's computer had a melt down. The Burro's are busy trying to fix it.

AshFx is currently in a drawdown if you take all signals. ie. I use the EA and it takes all signals FS and SS with out consideration to S+R. This being said, my demo is currently up since I started at the right time.

Party on Ricky!!!!. . .

--- 帖子 #2341 ---
THanks, Do you use the MA-trend at 34? or any other setting?

Ashfx signal for chfjpy : no trade. I think it will hit the trendline and a weekly 61% retracement @ approx $99.00  before the turn up. The RSI/% R also has not crossed up.

LR

--- 帖子 #2342 ---
I keep it at 34.  Mainly for  short term trades.

RSI  seems like a good filter.

If you get bored check out the weekly charts with these indicators. Some incredible moves  of 1000 and 2000 pips.

--- 帖子 #2343 ---
Do you mean RSI and %R crossover?

Good combination by our kiwi neighbour  coffeebuff.

Chf Yen  lining up as well but  main trend is up ,at double bottom and trend line resistance.

--- 帖子 #2347 ---
For those using the EA can you explain what EveryTickMode is and if it should be used?

Also I backtested the EA (with all possible settings) and the profit is always going down and never goes up...

--- 帖子 #2348 ---
EachTickMode when set to "True" will have the EA looking for signals every tick

When set to "False" the EA will only look for signals at the end of a bar.

As for the backtesting...what data are you using?

--- 帖子 #2349 ---
Sold Cad/Yen

Would have bought Aud/Cad.Not on  my broker.

Usd/Cad not  for me . At 61% fib resist.

--- 帖子 #2350 ---
I agree on all your trades.

What broker do you use?

LR

--- 帖子 #2351 ---
I use Oanda but am going to fund Alpari as well.

Oanda spreads out of hours too big.

--- 帖子 #2352 ---
My broker doesn´t have Cad/Yen, so i bought Aud/Cad for you .

I started with 0.9104

EURCAD is a valid ashfx signal. I am giving it a miss. Reasons: weekly looks bearish to me. Will enter when it presents a short signal.

Weekly has a reversal candle at support.

I am still in with my second lot, as I am using Fib expansion to exit.

I brushed up some fib revision on the weekend. Some revision is alwys refreshing.

LR

--- 帖子 #2364 ---
Never used Fib Expansion .   How cool.

By the way the boys on top seem very quite?

IR would your FE  100 be around 99.15?

--- 帖子 #2366 ---
FE100=99.73

Attached is a chart with handles left on for you to see.

FE 100 is also confluence of wkly 61.8% retracement and daily Fext 127.2.

ie very srong support fib cluster. (NOT shown on chart as it will clutter the FE study.

I love Fibonacci as a tool for S&R. MORE so to find clusters.

Congratulations! AUD/CAD lost

- 100 pips ...

i m not so convinced of this system, to tell the truth..

It´s true that the Ash signals are in a drawdown since long.

And there are very few people now writing here, since some days i see only 2.

--- 帖子 #2369 ---
Ricki,

This is a great system with a few tweaks. I think the lack of volume is attributable to the system being a daily one and signals are a little less frequent than a scalping system.

Pete

--- 帖子 #2370 ---
Pete,

Perhaps you could let us know what "tweaks" you have employed with the system to make it profitable.

--- 帖子 #2371 ---
Yes! please share your "tweaks"

--- 帖子 #2372 ---
I don't think congratulations is in order for anyone losing pips.

If you can't take a loss then you should not be trading because losses are inevitable.

The only reason I do not post here regularly (the number of people posting does not indicate a successful system) is that I am testing this system by EA.

It was suggested that EA users go to a different thread. That being said I will show that the system is currently up by at least 10% in a very short period by posting my EA results to date.

Make of it what you will.

--- 帖子 #2373 ---
1. Personally I would not have entered the this trade. WHY? What is the overall trend? UP or DOWN? DOWN. What tells me this? a) LOWER LOWS and LOWER HIGHS. b) 200 SMA c) weekly charts shows downtrend. d) RSI & % R indicators show downtrend clearly on the weekly chart. Boarder line on the daily chart the day ASHFX showed a buy signal.

2. ASHFX  are signals NOT a trading SYSTEM.  In the manual: several traders on the thread fail to understand/ignore the FINAL POINTS section and find they are taking bad trades. It has been discussed recently on this thread.

3. Just based on my reasons above for this AUDCAD you can see that traders have been telling you the filters they are using to enter sucessful trades.

I have been mentioning trading with the weekly trend for daily signals with all my price analysis charts for several weeks now. Coffeebuff suggested the RSI &%R crossover indicator to check trend status. All my charts have the 200SMA & 100SMAon them. Chuckb has shared his template on the this thread and his personal indicators.

CHUCKB has mentioned /suggested if traders could give their reasons for ENTRY and EXIT, this would help others learn.

If I may ask you what were your reasons for entry for this trade? Just the line up of askfx signals? Then after all the tweaks mentioned on the thread  already you ask for more! and say that ASHFX is not good!

PLEASE re-read this thread and you may find your answers.

HAPPY TRADING!

LR

This method just provides an option. Like any opportunity it is how it is handled by the one accepting or rejecting it. There are alot of considerations when looking at a setup on the Daily. So just blindly entering when the indicators meet the criteria... is like playing craps in the back alley. Use it to learn when not to trade and minimize risk. Next time before anyone claims the method sucks first evaluate what went into the thought process before during and when exiting the trade. You might find yourself evaluating your decisions and not being critical of the method. This self reflection can only make one a better trader in the long run. Both ASh Daily and Pipnailer are excellent tools but one must always be carefull when swinging that hammer.

--- 帖子 #2375 ---
Could anyone let me know what are the best pairs to trade using this strategy and/or which additional "tweaks" are best? I just really don't want to read through endless pages just to find this general information.

--- 帖子 #2377 ---
You  know I have 8yrs and a rough estimate of 10,000 hrs studying this market.

I STILL READ EVERYTHING I CAN.

Ashes signals are one of the most simplistic I have come across , however you still have to qualify the trade.

Support and resistance  and fibs give vital clues  if a trade should  be taken or not.

As IR has stated the weekly gives a good picture of what the currency may do.

If  I trade 15min   I  use  higher time frames  and pivots to  see what is happening.

As is always said trade with the trend.

Chuckb shows not only intelligence, but also wisdom+ humility+ and respect for the ever changing forex market . He knows like many of us that LEARNING DOES NOT STOP .Learning  continues from the minute we enter this world till we leave it .

Ronald all I can say, with that comment above and several others posts from you which I am reading in other forums that  you have been blessed with intelligence, but  still lots to learn in many other areas of life.

Humility and respect and wisdom when combined with intelligence propels growth as a person and success many fold.

--- 帖子 #2381 ---
It's not that I won't go back and read through all the wealth of information in this thread, its just that I would rather try out the system and see if it's for me first and know what to expect rather than reading through the entire thread and then deciding that this system isn't for me.

--- 帖子 #2382 ---
Read the PDF file in the first post about 5 times to start with. Then try it.

--- 帖子 #2383 ---
What you're saying is probably true. I haven't lived long enough to go through such experiences.

I agree that forex is a life-long learning experience. There's an old saying for this game I used to play:

"It takes a minute to learn, but a lifetime to master".

I see forex in the same light. It takes a relatively short time to learn the fundamentals of the market, a little longer to capitalize on those learned fundamentals, but it takes a lifetime to master it.

I'll make the blind assumption that ChuckB is considerably older than I am (working age or thereabouts) and does not have as much time left as I do to invest in forex. It brings to mind another question: "What do you do with a dead horse?"

Do you:Get a bigger whip Appoint a committee to ascertain the 'deadness' of the horse. Get off the horse If ChuckB's goal is truly to make a career out of forex and it's taken him this long and yet he's seemingly gone nowhere profitability-wise, I think I'd get off this dead horse and invest my time elsewhere. Trading takes three things:Bucks Brains Balls ChuckB seems to have the bucks and balls, but does he have the brains? Simply knowing the facts, text-book fundamentals and definitions is all good and well, but if you can't apply them, what use is it? I  could read every textbook, forum, e-book, newsletter, vlog, newspaper, magazine, blog I want in an effort to become an actress (yes, ACTRESS). Does that mean I will achieve that goal? No. Does it make me stupid? No. Does it make me any worse than my neighbor? No. It simply means that I am not fit to be an actress. I may have more luck trying to become an actor, and that's what I'm suggesting for ChuckB.

Forex may not be cut out for him, what about commodities? Derivatives? Stock? Real Estate? Futures? There are scores of other secuirities to trade.

Ok, my rant is finished.

--- 帖子 #2384 ---
What do you mean by funny? I see you edited this post of yours from "I believe in totality" to "very funny"! Very vague to me!

I see a comment of ignorance from a young person who is blessed with intelligence but still lots to learn. Many medical students (RONALD)show alot more wisdom by hiding their ignorance.

LR

--- 帖子 #2385 ---
My young trader mate, Chuckb is intellegent enough and mature enough to make his own trader decisions as to what market he prefers to trade, without suggestions from you.  The sensitivity in your interpretation of his post shows through that you have missed the main point he was try to make in the first place.You assume he has no brains because you are a medical student. and think only medical student have the most brains. WRONG.There are many professions that need more intelligence than being a doctor. Settle down! and grow up! You assume he is not making money in the forex market. Maybe he is trying to make more money by learning new and innovative systems and add to his arsenal of trading tools. Maybe trying to trade a new timeframe due to change in lifestyle?Many reasons!!!

With your expression and language above which is a repeat of one of your other posts shows crudeness and lack of refinement. I find it off putting in a public forum like this. I certainly would not come to you for medical treatment!

The difference in age shows you know many things in theory but not in practice and experience and therefore lack of full understanding but keen to show  off the little theory you have learnt. In my opinion, if had more wisdom, you would assume less and work on that inflated ego!

Peace!

LR

--- 帖子 #2386 ---
First of all, where did you get the idea I'm a medical student? I'm taking up Business finance. Get it right. Stop making assumptions about me or my character if you intend to challenge it.

Also note that I readily admit that the assumptions I made are blind ones. I know not much about ChuckB except that he has been studying Forex for 8 years with seemingly little success. I appreciate the effort that he has put in, but from my perspective it like trying to count all the grains of sand in the world. It's impossible. You could spend years making the effort to do that, but ultimately you'll fail.

After all is said and done, I'm quite content in knowing that I am among the 5% of traders who regularly make money in the FX market. You may or may not be a member of that club, and that is good and well. Call me arrogant, crude, whatever. You are entitled to your opinion on this forum as am I. I gave my opinion, you disagree with it and you gave yours, that's fine. If you start making this personal, then I'll have a problem with that.

If you want to continue this debate, let's take it off-forum. I don't want to continue to fill Ash's thread with this nonsense.

--- 帖子 #2387 ---
IMHO start at the beginning not at the end! You will know if this system is for you by starting at the beginning.Invest time and effort before making decisions. You have confirmed you are trying to take shortcuts and trying to decide on a system.

--- 帖子 #2388 ---
Looking at your personal information on the thread it says INTERN. IN Australia this is referred to MEDICAL STUDENTS not finance students.

Another assumption  above about Chuckb you assume because he has been studying forex for 8 years he is seemingly doing so without success.

You  have been personal with your comments about chubkb and not kind either who I  happen know off the forum. Seems to me  that you like to dish out personal opinions to others but dont like it when it is dished back at you!

Congratulations on your 5% club! My intentions is to spend time trading and learning  not being caught up with growing up issues of 18 years old. I did take offense with your comments about a mate and so I viewed my opinions.

I hope it is clear now.

PEACE!

Somebody seems to have selective reading.

Note my entire profile:

Associations: RBS Greenwich Capital

A quick google search shows that it's a  fixed-income capital markets firm. For someone as thorough as you, I'm surprised you missed that.

Here's the original quote:

I do not explicitly say anything against ChuckB, this is merely a suggestion. I apologize if you misinterpreted what I wrote.

--- 帖子 #2390 ---
I accept your apology Ronald, even though you did not explicitly say things against Chuckb your assumptions /tones /language suggested/said it all.

You assume again, I would google to find out about greenwich Capital. No interest to me to waste my time. I must admit I did read  it and was confused . I am thorough on things I consider important to spend time on. I consider trading important not finding out your associations.

The term INTERN conveyed the message I was looking for. No reason to place further importance on one trader's details. Shows how different terms means different things in different countries.

How very quiet it is here....I wonder why?

Anyway, signal on the above but seeing pivotal S/R around 1.5250/1.5200 and as it's a SS trade a poor RR. Also a bullish candle on the 4 hour chart.

Therefore, I am going to pass on this one.

Anyone got any alternative thoughts?

I traded this one on demo and it is currently up over 40 pips. Thats not to say the trade will end up a winner following the exit rules but it is nice to know one can grab 10,20,30 or more pips on these trades.

I totally see the SR you are referring to. If it does break through to the downside it could be a sweet ride for the shorts.

--- 帖子 #2393 ---
I entered  this trade short.

reasons: weekly trend down. I was waiting for the retracement which occured at 38.2%  on the daily chart. Daily chart below 200MA. this confirms downtrend, along with rsi/%R corssover on the downside.

exits: I use fib expansions. Entered 2 lots with position size management according to my acocunt balance. First trade exit at FE 61.8% the second at FE 100%.

I consider this a ASHFX SS trade. Option exit according to ASHFX exit.

You know I wasn't going to respond to you, however  others have  so here it is.

Fair comment , 8yrs is a long time but I am very patient.

I  looked a one of your postings  where you said you lost over 2 trillion over 3yrs  paper trading. That sounds like a lot of learning to me.  So you started trading at 15?

As to your other comments, not welcome.

So you are in the 5% of traders who make money , how about some analysis on the  Ash setups.

Enough from me.

My thanks to the supportive response from  other posters.

--- 帖子 #2395 ---
I have been reading this thread since the beginning and choose last week to start trading live after some time on paper. I picked a good week to start.

Forexmoments hasn't posted here in quite some time. Are you still trading this system??

Hello Irathi,

i wanted to answer you this question some times ago, because it was hanging in my mind, but i was very busy.

here is the answer:

Nobody wrote he wouldn t enter this trade, neither you...

That´s why i did it.

Ok, you didn´t have to

Sorry i didn´t check it myself. I am a beginner, i am working a lot and have few or no time left. I don´t know "fibonacci" or any S&R analysis. But i will apply your tipps now, like looking to the weekly trend, and learning fibonacci and these things... when i have time.

Your last tip looks good, i´m in. Let´s see.

@Ash, sorry for my critic, i don´t mean it.

(i was angry because i lost a lot with scalping when i was in holidays end august)

--- 帖子 #2397 ---
Thanks for your reply.

We are all busy and all trying to be successful traders too. I personally feel do not trade with real money till you see yourself consistently making money in your demo.

ASHFX manual has mentioned FINAL POiNTS  which is not taken seriously or ignored. This is very very important to trade successfully plus with the line up of ASHFX indicators. Trading alone with line up of indicators is not enough.

There is alot of discretion in trading S&R and exits. ASHFX has asked new traders to learn this for themselves.

Traders on forums can give their opinions, but if you yourself are not sure to confirm  their reasons and enter a trade based on their analysis blindly is not good.

Please do not depend blindly on others traders opinions, these are just guidelines and pointers. Finally please learn fibonacci S&R ,drawing of trendlines properly etc. and trade with the higher timeframe. USE ASHFX signals to enter after price analysis.

I am happy to give pointers and help those who want help . I learnt by fibonaci from NEAL HUGHES .

Caution needed on signals generated in the next few days.

Most  currencies have gapped  up or down at open anywhere from 50 to 430 pips.

This will give false signals as the market does tend to fill in these gaps.

--- 帖子 #2399 ---
thanks for this,

just done some revision on the theory of gaps.

for those interested:

There are four basic kinds of gaps:

1.common gaps

2.breakaway gaps

3.runaway gaps

4.exhaustion gaps

If you ever wondered what causes gaps in price charts and what they mean?

Although a ton of PSAR signals have flipped with the gaps, as of right now, none of them are showing signs of taking action. They are all going opposite the PSAR signal.

I was in 5 at the market open yesterday.

CAD/JPY triggered my SL only netting me the 1st position and BE on the 2nd. It is now back down below the SL. (

The other 4 have now come to within a couple pips of being back on the positive track as a collective.

I sold EUR/GBP last night as a standard trade. Anybody else get in it?

--- 帖子 #2403 ---
Irathi will tell you that the weekly trend goes up. So he wouldn´t not do this trade. Am i right?

I went in, just to see.

--- 帖子 #2404 ---
I took the EUR/AUD trade.

It was barely negative, which was in the direction of the PSAR flip.

The AC and AO both flipped from green to red and the Stoch is above 50 and declining.

All good sell signals.

On top of that the stop loss and the first take profit are pretty shallow. Not a ton of risk on the table.

--- 帖子 #2405 ---
Sticking to my trading rules I trade LONG when price above 200MA on daily TF. and vice versa.

I did not go SHORT. I may miss a few pips in some trades but in the longterm I gain by sticking to my rules.

What I see in price action

Bearish divergence (trend weakening) on both wkly and dly charts.

If your trading plan  allows you to go short,do so. Watch for support at the red down trend line and then at the green uptrendline.

--- 帖子 #2410 ---
I entered 2xlots for eurcad. First lot exited at 61.8 FE and second lot still open at 180+pips profit.

CADJPY opened 2xlots and exits for expected profit at 61.8% and 100% FE levels. For this trade waiting to re-enter .

I entered chfjpy on the ASHFX signal of 29.8.08. This trade is 320+ pips in profit.

There are so many trades at the moment, why go for low probabilty trades.

--- 帖子 #2413 ---
are the valid daily signals usually posted here, or shall i look every day by myself the 20 pairs?

The last ones run good

--- 帖子 #2414 ---
I was not aware this was a daily signal service . It is my understanding it is a forum to discuss valid signals following the ashfx method. Why dont you look daily, put up your charts explaining your entry and exit and s/l figures for forums members to discuss?

AM I missing something?

LR

--- 帖子 #2415 ---
I am trading the straight up plan put forth by Forexmoments in message #1.

My platform is GFT Forex.

M&M

--- 帖子 #2416 ---
The recommended broker for Ashfx is fxdd metatrader4. It seems the sunday candle is the cause of several discrepancies in signals. I am not sure whether GFT has a sunday candle. Just be alerted that signals on this forum will may differ to your signals.

Further I hope you have read the final points of the manual as this seems to have caused some misunderstandings in the recent past from other traders.

Also, it was suggested and accepted as a good idea that traders upload their charts with their reasons for entry, possible exits and s/l initially when they think there is a posiible trade to initiate discussion. This way there is a two-way learning experience for all traders on the forum. This includes Support and resistance levels in their decision whether they think it is a gook R:R ratio.

S&R maybe trendlines, eyeballing this levels,fibo levels,pivots etc.

Thanks,

LR

it is the one on first page.

--- 帖子 #2419 ---
LR is quite right ,this is a forum for members views on ash setups.

Page one has all the info with the exception of  the RSI  that  some of us are trialing.

You need to find the signals yourself and post questions if unsure. Generally someone will reply.

Weekly in over sold,stock has crossed,at 50% fib.

Daily  Ash signals all good, rsi crossed, bounced off 200MA, breaking though trend line. Good to go  if  it holds next candle.??

--- 帖子 #2422 ---
All the ticks in the box for a long that you mention based solely on the daily TF. A few pips to be made.

However, I will stand aside for a LONG on this if the candle holds. My reasons:

1. The weekly is still looking bearish(LL).This to me is a retracement. Prefer to enter as a short when it turns around again.( My trading rules are that I trade with the weekly trend)

2.This signal candle is very long so expect a retracement tomorrow.Also there is resistance at ~1.2370ish.

i think he is referring the post 1 of this thread

btw, where is Ash ?

--- 帖子 #2425 ---
No no.

I wished all the valid signals were posted ans discussed here. But there are fewer people writing here now and i think when you or ChuckB find good signals without any doubt, you don´t post them here. Why should everybody search for hisself when 2 or 3 people can do it for the others? Why i don´t look daily? Because i am busy and it takes some time. But i will.

Thank you for your answers. I still need to learn a lot.

You both are good teachers.

--- 帖子 #2426 ---
Hi Ricki72,

Thanks for your compliments that I am a good teacher, but.......

We all wish all signals were posted here and discussed here. We are all busy and we all find the time to look at charts  if we decide we want to earn extra money. That is a choice we make. Goodwill from traders like myself and perhaps chuckb  soon realise that traders like yourself  who expect only 2-3 people to do it for others soon dries up and more and more traders read  on forums and  fewer and fewer not share.

I am amazed how selfish/self-centred  some traders are and they expect FREE service from others without a conscience of contributing  something back to forums like this one. Very one-sided attitide!

I can see why experienced traders start charging for their experience to others like yourself .

I am not impressed. I rather teacher the poor and underpreviledged who understand /have a conscience of  two-way traffic.

Yes I agree you have alot to learn other than forex.

--- 帖子 #2429 ---
@Irathi,

i understand, and i would also pay for signals, but not $250 like for Oz. On Ashs web page it s written he is giving signals, that´s why i came here (before i was in OzFXdaily, untill he went exclusive and very expensive). Ash gave some signals with e-mails, but very rarely and not anymore.

PS: Yen is really gone it seems . It´s a pity.

--- 帖子 #2430 ---
it is not that a few people are contributing to this forum, personally, if there is a clear ashfx signal ,i contribute, i dont see any reason why  someone needs to post when there is no good signal so that confusion will not set in. most of the pairs are ranging, and the few onea that are not did not apply to ashrules

--- 帖子 #2431 ---
So now you depend on other traders on Ashfx forum to give you good signals without you contributing because you are busy??!! Do you think others are not busy?

IMHO, if you do not apply the rules you learn yourself by putting up charts on forum's and depending on others you will not be an independant trader.

I rather learn and put the effort into learning without taking others for granted and helping them too!

I generally do not like your attitude . Why should everybody search for hisself when 2 or 3 people can do it for the others? There are many paid services(other than OZFX) available for signals if you are so busy!!

I will not be putting up any more of my charts for your benefit. If others contribute their effort they  are free  to PM myself if they want to.

LR

--- 帖子 #2432 ---
yes i want to try this system it is the only one tpl ?

--- 帖子 #2433 ---
Take it easy pal. So many signals posted here, some works some dont. So if anyone follows it they are doing at their own risks. So the harm is only to them if they do it without research. Cool friend.

--- 帖子 #2434 ---
It certainly puts a bad taste in my mouth when traders such as RICK72 exploit the goodwill of others in these forums  because he is BUSY. More like ........( I shall hold my tongue).

I rather have a small group of like minded traders using the same/similar strategy who are prepared to bounce off each other and help each other in a WIN:WIN situaton.

Any traders on this forum who are interested my email address is:

Strange guy...

you know that the whole world can read this forum without even having an account?

... Lol

But the bad ricki72 ("i", not "y") just wants to exploit the work of the good people here and nobody else would do that!

Do what you want!

You really understand nothing, or just what you want. Where are you from?

I said i will look for the signals by myself and learn all the other things, Fibonacci and so. But i´would  EVENTUALLY be happy to get signals, like i did from Oz AND FROM ASH FOR FREE!

I am learning another method now anyway. I ll see then.

For the rest, no comment.

bye.

PS: i am also someone who is able to give- even more than others

i won´t write here anymore

Morphs into a strage guy when being truly honest....wow 20 charts to click through at least 10 seconds per chart to see if a signal is there and if so a few minutes to evaluate valid setups for the 1 or 2 valid entries present....or if you just follow signals blindly just enter the dam trade. There will always be those looking for a hand out at the soup kitchen...good luck with finding a signal service... your contributions and efforts you brought to this fine thread will be sorely missed. Even the Burro has to stop and take a dump once and awhile. Now back to staying in positive PIPS with ASH's great method.

Here's a "Profile" for AshFx Daily with 15 charts all set.

I thought I would share as it allows to have a global look of all 15 pairs and spot easily the probable setups in a glance, then maximize the ones that meet the conditions for a further analysis and decision.

It usually takes me 2-5 minutes at a maximum, daily.

I know that setting up so many pairs can be a boring task so it's nice if it can be of help to others.

15 Pairs :

EURUSD       EURGBP       GBPUSD

USDJPY       USDCHF       USDCAD

AUDUSD AUDJPY CHFJPY

GBPJPY GBPCHF CADJPY

EURJPY NZDUSD EURCHF

Just place the complete folder in the "Profiles" folder of your MT4.

--- 帖子 #2441 ---
Wow!  Thanks for posting that profile... I have been using Metatrader for a couple of years and have never used or saved a profile...  Here's what my 1 minute scan revealed... a good ASH Long signal for the Cable... I have not taken more time with the chart yet in order to decide to take the trade.

--- 帖子 #2442 ---

great system!  keep it coming

--- 帖子 #2444 ---
What other pairs work with this system?  In my 3 year backtest, EURUSD and GBPUSD performed excellently (though somewhat erratically individually, but combined they were solid).  I'm looking to add another 2-3 pairs to the system.  USDCAD doesn't seem to work so well, neither does USDCHF, any ideas?

Which EA are you using?

Is there a smilie face in the right hand upper corner of your charts.

The EA may not take a trade for several days.

Indicators should not have to be applied to the chart as far as I know.

Can you post a screen shot?

--- 帖子 #2454 ---
To andante9:

I manually trade and just shorted the cable with a 100 pip SL & TP; we shall see how it goes.

edit: woke up this morning with +100 pips. E=1.8308, TP=1.8208(hit), SL=1.8408  And i had a godd nights sleep too!

--- 帖子 #2455 ---
What is going on here? Why someone paying to provide free service?

--- 帖子 #2456 ---
Free losing signals. Paid winning signals.

--- 帖子 #2457 ---
I guess the reason is lack of interaction between traders on the thread.

Also, if you read back there was some pretty "bad blood" between some traders because of questions asked and comments made. There was no need for some of the more "robust" postings that were made. This sort of thing puts people off, IMO.

Interesting to see your EA results. I tried the EA some months back and it produced significant losses. I guess timing may be the issue. On reflection, some of the trades the EA takes are countertrend, up against significant SR etc. etc. There are many postings on this thread that suggest that an EA is not the way to go because of the inherent limitations in this regard.

Best wishes with your future trades!

Hi All

Here is an EA by RonaldRaygun that has been making money on this demo account. Even in these rough times for traders. . .

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #2460 ---
I know someone will ask so here is the preset file I am using on the chart you see in the picture above.

Be advised that the amount I am using for SL and TS vary on each chart. Other than that the inputs are the same across the pairs. I believe that when I set up the account I used about 2times the 4hrATR(100) for SL and TS. Note that there is no TP! Only SL and TS. I am using 3 different demo EA's at the current time using this basic setup for taking profits that are all currently in profit. I am trying to limit the losses and not the profits .

RR has given us a good EA here to test for free. Thanks Ronald!

I think that both this system and EA are worth looking into further and that everyone should really give them a fair chance.

Appreciate the defence mate. This system works, even the EA has proven this. Yes it's important to implement Support and Resistance into your trading, but even without that, you can make a fair amount of pips if you pick the stronger setups.

The problem is people want to be spoon-fed. I'm not naming any names, but I've had countless emails asking me to provide specific signals for AshFX Daily. Guys, I'm not going to sacrifice my time, effort and energy by posting my signals EVERY DAY FOR FREE and then if there are some bad ones (which will and do happen) I get slaughtered for it.

Exactly...

--- 帖子 #2462 ---
They're actually not paying, because someone got free credit.

--- 帖子 #2463 ---
Nice catch of about 150 pips and still going

--- 帖子 #2464 ---
Among dozens of systems I have come across, this one is the simplest, easiest, most effective and reliable.

No need to buy expensive "Black box" systems.    No need to fret about complicated patterns, set ups or calculations.    Just download Meta Trader Platform from FXDD (Live or Demo), and insert the prescribed indicators.

No need to Sit in front of monitor all day, putting unnecessary stress on your blood pressure.    From Sunday to Thursday, around 16.30 to 17.30 pm EST, just scan your favourite Pairs (or all the pairs available on FXDD) and note down the likely candidates for Full Strength as well as Secondary Strength potential Trades.    Prefer Full Strength Trades and enter.

Be patient.    If there is no trade one day, don't push your luck.    Wait for another day.    Simply enter the trade, when all conditions are literally met and there is reasonable room for the pair to move in the direction of your trade (before price hits some major Support or Resistance).

This routine of minimum effort, easy to follow system and simple discipline of not taking any "Weak" trades, will, in time, bring you impressive profits without too much heartache and panic attacks.

Good Luck and Good Trading.

--- 帖子 #2465 ---
My EA tests, IMO, agree totally with your analysis in this post. There is only one thing I must point out from my point of reference - my EA is set to take both FS and SS trades. I have not (yet) tested using  TakeSStraders=False in any accounts but I think I is worth looking into.

--- 帖子 #2466 ---
I have been using AshFx for the past month. I have had some bad trades and some good ones but as of right now, I am up from a month ago.

Has anybody looked at using this system outside Forex? Say on index funds or commodities?

--- 帖子 #2467 ---
I have the hard copy of Ash's formula to enter the SL TP and such

but is there an indicator that would show it visually. I'm fairly new to this been trading demo and some live for 6 months now. I agree ASH's system is soooo easy. I bought his EA but I use it to signal me for manual trades. The ease of the system doesn't warrant use of the EA only. I use it as a guide and then manually confirm the trade. I've had the EA do a few trades that didn't look like it followed the buy / sell formula. If I can find the examples I'll post them

Thanks ASH

PS I need help understanding the second strength trade

Before I help you on SS trades, can I ask...

Who did you buy this EA off?

--- 帖子 #2469 ---
My members would beg to differ. My free short call on the Eur/Jpy last weekend generated around a 1000 pips, thank you very much. And I am not selling any paid signals either. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #2470 ---
I'm glad that people are appreciating the system. Too many just try it for a bit, then if they get a couple of bad trades, whammo, they move on to a different system.

"System Hoppers" would do well to take the advice of "minortrader".

--- 帖子 #2471 ---
I think MTABoneweb was the one selling the EA.

--- 帖子 #2472 ---
As we roll through what will probably be one of the worst economic upheavels in our lifetime, you should expect some losses (and hopefully some wins). With US stock market swings of +/- 10% per day, people are going to run too and from currencies like changes in wind direction.

As for the EA for this system. Why would you want to use an EA? Manual trading takes about 5 minutes a day (some days 30 minutes, some days 1 minute) and will keep you out of weak feeling signals.

Just my 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #2473 ---
I don't think so. He was kind enough to email me and seek permission as to whether he can sell any EA based off my systems (such as Pip Nailer / AshFX). I said to him I want Pip Nailer / AshFX and any signals/documentation/programming/etc related to these two systems to remain totally free. And he agreed and promised me he wouldn't sell them.

Just trying to figure out who it could be, perhaps someone on eBay?

--- 帖子 #2474 ---
It was a "package deal" You got the ash fx EAs as a 'free bonus' if you bought his other EAs.

I'll look for the website, it may still be up.

--- 帖子 #2475 ---
He sells 'AshFX ea' for $30.

--- 帖子 #2476 ---
Nice catch guys. So he is selling the EA's based off my systems after all.

I'm not happy about this in the slightest.

--- 帖子 #2477 ---
Best we can do is depose the guy. Spread the word that there is a free EA available (Mine are still here =D).

--- 帖子 #2478 ---
Yeah, and yours are better! Lol.

I'm not bothered that he's selling EAs, it's his life, he can do what he wants. Maybe he used this forum to advertise, maybe he genuinely changed his mind, I don't really care. But what I'm bothered about is that he's selling an EA based off MY system for which he has NO permission.

--- 帖子 #2479 ---
The problem is that you don't hold a copyright, and even if you did, it's damn near impossible to enforce without significant resources (lotsa money)

I sent an e-mail to the webprovider for the forum to try and remove it. Do you have some hardcopy proof that you developed the system before August 7?

--- 帖子 #2480 ---
I don't need to prove it, Mtaboneweb openly admits I developed it.

--- 帖子 #2481 ---
EA selling is always happen in the forum. Have no way to block this to happen. A thread I join in earlier provided a free public EA for all. But still there is ppl selling the EA on ebay, and more worse is, there is ppl who buying it without knowing there is a free version in the public forum...

Not really happy to see ppl copy other idea and selling the EA on their own. Haiz.

Nvr mind, next time you tell me, I go sell it. LOL.....

I still remember you help me up in a thing, I guess is a open trade EA. Can I take there and sell for USD 100, I ask permission in advance.

Dunno it sounds joke or not, cause I not a good english-er. Juz to remind, juz say for fun.... Hehe

--- 帖子 #2485 ---
My main concern isn't whether or not my EAs are good enough to sell.

It's more that certain A-holes have the temerity to blatantly take and sell my EA. The only reason why I'm interested in finding sellers, is to make sure that I can tell potential buyers to come here instead. This does two things:  Increase membership at FF 'Robs' the seller of any ill-gotten gain.

Hey Everyone,

andante9, I've just got a question about Ronald's AskFX Entry EA, I see your running it at the moment. Could you post your settings? I'm interested, how do you know when to take your profit, are you using the ''CloseOnOppositeSignal'' option or TS? Also are you using the previous closed candle to determine the SL for each pair?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #2490 ---
Hi All

Xirtam. . .Here is the set file for EURCAD I am using ATM. . .

Regarding when to 'take your profit', I do not use the 'close on oppposite signal option'. I use TS and SL only, this is 'tailored' to each pair I am running. By using only a SL and TS I am only deciding how much to risk on each trade and NOT limiting the profit by using a set TP.

No, I do not use previous candle to determine SL and TP for each pair. What I used when I set up this account is Average True Range (ATR). For each pair I included on each 4hr chart the ATR(100). I then used a SL and TS ABOUT 2 times the the 4hrATR(100). All other inputs for each pair is the same as the above preset file. When I originally setup the SL and TS I intended to redifine the TS and SL on a weekly basis but I have fallen behind on this intention. However I can say that I find most pairs will show up in the range of 150 to 250 pips range for the TP and SL.

Thanks to Ash and RR for the great system and EA.

Thanks Twee for your quick action to reduce the size of that oversize chart. I love to send you emails complaining about things.

For any new people on this thread, please review the size of charts you post. It makes it hard to read the thread when a huge chart is posted. There are ways to post a large chart. Just check how it looks in the thread.

--- 帖子 #2492 ---
Thanks andante9 for this great detail, I'm going to give your idea a try and see how it goes!

--- 帖子 #2493 ---
After looking at the system I see an opportunity on EUR/CHF charts today.

I just wanted to see if my TP is at the right level.  The AshFX rule for a second strength TP is the previous candle's close minus it's low for a long.  Therefore, the candle I circled in blue I should measure it's close minus it's low for the TP.  It closed around .7786 and the low was .7710, giving a 72 pip 1st target.  Can someone let me know if I did this correctly?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #2494 ---
Good luck to you. Please know that my trading is in the experimental stage.

--- 帖子 #2495 ---
Is it me or has then been almost no signals for long or shorts in the daily

on most pairs

--- 帖子 #2496 ---
Considering the jittery market as of late, it's understandable.

--- 帖子 #2497 ---
i just took the long signal in my chart above for EUR/GBP today and it just hit TP1 for about 50 pips.  Took profit on half the position and set my SL to breakeven.

--- 帖子 #2498 ---
The AO bar was red on my chart when the psar flipped. That is not in the rules was it red on your chart if so what broker I'm with FxDD

Thanks

--- 帖子 #2499 ---
I entered a Buy @02:59 GMT on Eur/GBP @.7902 and hit +51 TP @ .7953, 11:13 GMT. FXDD, manual entry.  Should have entered a TS as I have missed a bunch of plus pips.  Still +51 is better than my shorter TFs this morning, mostly small losses.  Thanks Ash

--- 帖子 #2500 ---
I'm also using FXDD.

You can still take a trade if the AO isn't compliant.  You can see on my chart that AO was red when the PSAR dot switched to a long, but ash said it usually changes to green within the next few candles..and you can see that it did in fact change to green on the next candle making this a second strength trade.

Can anyone confirm that the TP1 for a second strength long trade is the candle before the signal candle's close minus it's low??  I'm getting the candle before the signal candle with a close of .7786 and a low of .7710 for a 76 pip TP1.  Someone please confirm.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #2501 ---
Hi

I just checked the AshFx PDF on page1 and it appears to me that you have the TP1 correctly calculated according to the SS rules.

--- 帖子 #2502 ---
Thanks a lot for the help.  Just wanted to be sure I'm using the system properly.

Anyone see a potential short on USD/CHF??  Is anyone planning on taking it if it closes as a signal?

--- 帖子 #2503 ---
Although it didn't close as a signal, it still might turn out good. However, did you take the FS short prior to this one? Could have made a few pips there.

--- 帖子 #2504 ---
EDIT: Deleted.

--- 帖子 #2505 ---
Ash,

I just started using your system about a week ago and that signal was before I started using it.

I really love the system though and took my first SS trade using it last week on EUR/GBP and made some pips off of it... I entered a little late and my first TP was hit, but I was stopped out for a break even on the second half of my position.

Just wondering, how did you go about backtesting this system (how long, which pairs, win ratio, etc)?

Thanks again for everything!

Scott

--- 帖子 #2506 ---
Good to hear you made some pips Scott. I did around a years worth of backtesting on pretty much every pair FXDD had to offer. The win to loss ratio was easily over 65%. As for reward:risk ratio, as an average, you're definitely looking at least 1:1.

--- 帖子 #2507 ---
From what I see there looks like a lot of opportunity at today’s close for some plays AUD/NZD AUD/CAD NZD/USD CHF/JPY USD/JPY GBP/USD GBP/JPY EUR/JPY

Not sure about GBP/CHF
Anyone else confirm these possibilities with me
Thanks
Dave

--- 帖子 #2508 ---
A lot of pairs flipped the PSAR Dot today.  GBP/CHF looks like a second strength trade to me because the stochastics are trending up but above 50, and the AO is not green yet.

Also, does anyone know if there are two opportunites such as GBP/USD, EUR/USD, and USD/JPY what the rules are as to which ones to take?  I recall reading something about not taking another trade when both pairs with signals are like XXX/USD.

--- 帖子 #2509 ---
Took long signals on EUR/USD and CHF/JPY.  Other pairs with signals had stops that would have been too large for me.

--- 帖子 #2510 ---
Took long on      price             S/L      T/P

NZDUSD            .6197            .6146     .6236

AUDUSD            .6974            .6934     .6990

GBPCHF            1.9793         1.9691    1.9879

AUDCAD           .8114             .8088     .8121

I think I did the S/L T/P correctly

--- 帖子 #2511 ---
I'm pretty sure some of these are second strength trades because the stochastics are above 50 which would set the stop loss at the most recent swing low.  Also, my AUD/USD chart closed as a bear candle which invalidates that signal for me.

I think for GBP/CHF and AUD/CAD the swing low (red line) should be your stop and the white is your entry yesterday.

--- 帖子 #2512 ---
i think almost every single signal failed from yesterday. in fact if we had taken the opposite trades from what AshFX Daily told us we would have won almost every single trade.

but anyway before going into the trade the candle formation wasn't looking good for most of the pairs.

a bad day for the system, just another point proving that you cannot trade this system blindly, you need human intervention.

--- 帖子 #2513 ---
The long trades I took (EUR/USD and CHF/JPY) are still open.  They both had stops around 340 pips and neither have hit the stops yet so you can't call them a failure yet.  Keep in mind that these are both second strength trades (stochastics above 50) which is why I used the swing low for my stops.

I'm not feeling optimistic about them but I think its too early to call them failures as long as the proper stops are used.

--- 帖子 #2514 ---
Took a beating didn't follow the rules Stochastic above 50 in all cases

market news not good today either

How much equity is (or was) in your account?  You should only be risking 3% max per trade.  If you have $5000 in your account you should risk no more than $150 on each trade.

--- 帖子 #2516 ---
I know that I was just feeling out the system and placing 1.o lot orders

trying to learn the T/P and S/L and signals

--- 帖子 #2517 ---
Shorted NZD/USD yesterday @ .5929 (got in a little late)

Second strength trade, SL .6265; TP .5592

My last 2 trades were Long EUR/USD and CHF/JPY were both stopped out about -330 pips each

--- 帖子 #2518 ---
How did you get stopped out of Chf/Jpy? I am up over 400 pips on that one.

--- 帖子 #2519 ---
Did you take the last signal (it was a short) on Eur/Usd?

I've pocketed almost 1000 pips.

--- 帖子 #2520 ---
I didn't take the last two signals on Eur/Usd though.

Yep, you would have been stopped out on the long, but you would have made that up on the next short...

Did you take this Scott?

--- 帖子 #2521 ---
hi ash do you close position on the stoch croos ,or wiat for AC to change the color.  thanks

--- 帖子 #2522 ---
No, this system doesn't use AC to close position, rather it uses AO to close position.

--- 帖子 #2523 ---
Guys,

It has come to my attention that my system, "AshFX Daily" is being repackaged under a different name, called "Forex Payload" and is being sold across the internet:

http://www.zimbio.com/Forex+Trading+...Payload+Review

Absolutely ridiculous. Others are selling EA's based on my systems as well.

What is the point of releasing systems for free when ******** like these take the piss.

I've had enough.

--- 帖子 #2524 ---
Hi Ash

i know you are upset, but "KARMA" will always even things out.

This GUy is selling your system and hard work,BUT he will lose more in the end of day.

Your heart is in the right place mate,You are helping your fellow traders,so i hope you dont stop now.

Take care

baz

--- 帖子 #2525 ---
Consider this: we know it's free. There is a free EA in this thread, just distribute that along-side the commercial EAs. =D

--- 帖子 #2526 ---
I didn't take that signal because I wasnt trading your system at the time

--- 帖子 #2527 ---
I took the long EUR/USD.  However, the short signal came while I was still in the long trade so I wasn't sure if I should have taken it.  The next day I got stopped out of the long. Same thing happened to me on my CHF/JPY long.  I was long and a short signal came while my long was open.  -700 pips combined.  I'm glad I stuck to my money management.

In hindsight I'm guessing if a short signal comes while I'm still long I should cut my long losses and open a short?

Better news, the NZD/USD short played out great for me.  +330 pips.

--- 帖子 #2528 ---
Ash,

What do you think of these signals?

I'm not too confident in the EUR/AUD signal but the others seem pretty good.  I'll probably take the AUD/USD trade.

--- 帖子 #2529 ---
It was a long trade and I got stopped out.  If you took the long signal you had to have been stopped out...

--- 帖子 #2530 ---
My advice would be to take none of them, especially the AUS/NZD. Look how choppy the Stochs are.

Also, in this climate I prefer to take First Strength Signals. That means AO and AC same colour, Stochs not having trespassed the 50 line.

--- 帖子 #2531 ---
If you are not having luck with the system then reread the directions, you must be doing something wrong.

I have been trading live on this system since Sept 1 on 19 pairs with GFTForex.

- I pay little attention to the stoch.

- The AC has to be in favor of the trade

- The color of the reversal day bar has to be as well

- The AO can go either way, but I feel better if everything lines up.

- S/L and T/P are per the system except I move S/L as the PSAR moves, no sense leaving money on the table.

Since Sept 1, my account value is up 66%. I take my positions with 3% of the account value.

The standard deviation has been huge over the last 2 month. About a month ago every position went against me and then we issued a $700B bailout package (thank you Uncle Sam).

Currently in 11 positions with all having taken the first TP. Friday was an interesting day with some serious retrace on a bunch of pairs.

Ash, I hate to hear that somebody is profiting on your work. That is the challenege with the public domain. From me-to-you though, thanks for the system.

--- 帖子 #2532 ---
I heard news of a possible rate cut which would be bad for USD strength and some of these trades.  Thanks for getting back to me.  Do you have any other suggestions for filtering valid signals other than support/resistance, fibs, or choppy stocs?

Also, when the candle closes on Friday, should we open the position when our broker opens on Sunday?  My broker opens 3:00PM on Sunday so I'm not sure if I should wait to take a signal or take the Friday right when my broker opens Sunday.

edit: I was wondering, if I have a long open that is losing pips and I get a short signal, should I cut the losses on the long and open a short?

--- 帖子 #2533 ---
What do you mean by the color of the reversal day bar?  Also, can you explain how you move the S/L based on the PSAR dot.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #2534 ---
One other change I have made is I set all S/L like a primary trade.

- The color of the reversal day bar has to be as well - If PSAR says buy then bar must have closed higher then open and opposite if PSAR says sell.

I entered three more positions at today's open, AUD/USD, AUD/NZD, and EUR/AUD.

--- 帖子 #2535 ---
Aren't you supposed to avoid having positions opened on the same pairs with AUD as the base currency?

For example if you get a signal on AUD/USD and AUD/NZD, you only take one of them because you don't want to have two pairs such as AUD/XXX

Ash could you clarify this?

--- 帖子 #2536 ---
It's personal preference. Nothing against the rules.

If I'm taking both trades, then I would lessen the risk.

--- 帖子 #2537 ---
I agree with Ash, take whatever trades you are comfortable.

It can go either way. When a currency moves, typically all of the cross-pairs move.

If they are going negative, you have SL for a reason.

If they all move positive, then life is good.

Scott, I sense this is new to you, if not please disregard the following comments. I highly recommend you paper trade it until you can do it in your sleep. Also, read all you can on forex, a good place to start is the online training on babypips.

--- 帖子 #2538 ---
I'm not new to trading, just new to the system.  I want to be sure I know it in and out.

Could either you or Ash give me your opinion on what to do when you:

Take a long signal that turns out to be losing pips,

You then get a short signal while the losing long is still open (SL isnt reached yet).

Do you think it is best to cut the loss on the long and open the short or just ignore the short signal and let the long play out?

--- 帖子 #2539 ---
Sounds like you are talking about secondary trades per the rules. Why do I say that?

You will never have a reversal of the PSAR and still be in a position unless you have your stop set higher/lower then the first bar of a new reversal. Take a look at the rules and formula behind the PSAR.

I set all stops at the high/low of the initial bar (per the rules, first trades).

--- 帖子 #2540 ---
Take a look at this chart, I was actually trading this live.  I had a Second Strength long signal which I took (first pink line on left).  My stop, as per the rules, was the swing low (red line that says long stop).  While in the long trade, a short signal came up and I was still not stopped out of the long.  I ignored the short signal and my long got stopped out the next day.

Obviously in hindsight it would have made sense to cut the loss on the long and open up a short.  Can you or Ash comment on this?  Do you guys think it makes sense if you are in a losing trade (ie my long) and get an opposite signal (ie the short signal I got) to close the loser and open up a position according to the new signal?

--- 帖子 #2541 ---
I can't speak for anyone else, but if I get a signal to go short and I'm currently long, I reverse the trade.

--- 帖子 #2542 ---
Thats probably what I'm going to do now.  If I had done that on my past EUR/USD long signal I would have made back my loss and then some...

--- 帖子 #2543 ---
I agree with you 100%. If you weren't in the position at all, what would you do? Then do it.

Looking at your EUR/USD chart, is your setting on the PSAR correct. Probably different platforms, I did not get the buy signal until the next bar so luckily missed out on it.

By my own rules variation, had I gotten that signal, I would have set my SL at the bottom of the signal bar. Even following the rules, AC/AO are green and the Stoch is just barely above 50 and both are climbing, probably good to set at low of signal bar.

--- 帖子 #2544 ---
I'm using a feed from FXDD which is recommended for this system.  Unfortunately it produced that short signal while I was in a long trade and I didn't know what to do at the time.

So you are saying that since the stochs were barely above 50 it was almost good enough for a primary trade, thus the stop at the daily candle low?  What other variations have you made because I'm making a couple modifications myself

--- 帖子 #2545 ---
Scott, if one was long, and the system signalled short, then one has a number of options. There are no hard & fast rules for AshFX Daily. One could either:

a) Quit the long, and go short.

b) Stay long, but go short as well (essentially hedging to an extent)

c) Ignore the long signal, and stay short.

d) Exit the long, and don't go short.

Now, depending on the circumstances, EITHER ONE of those could be a good decision, especially the last one - remember, you don't have to always be in a trade. This is not a stop and reverse system.

Having said that however, generally speaking, options a) and b) are the most viable.

--- 帖子 #2546 ---
Hi

It looks great method especially to any one hasn't enogh time to trade during the day.

Is this apply to any daily candle? on other words should we follow a specific time for daily closing? because the daily close vary from broker to another, some broker close the day at 00:00 gmt others at 21:00 gmt and so many.

Good luck

--- 帖子 #2547 ---
Anyone take any signals today?  There were a bunch of second strength trades and one first strength on CAD/JPY.

However, the long signal on CAD/JPY seems like it is right at the 50% fib retracement on the downtrend.  Anyone have any comments on this?

--- 帖子 #2548 ---
I don't take signals that are counter-trend. I only take signals according the 200SMA.

--- 帖子 #2549 ---
Hi Scott

At what time the daily candle closed?

Thx

--- 帖子 #2550 ---
The daily candles close at 5:00PM EST.  The CAD/JPY was at the 50% fib retracement so I was concerned the downtrend was going to resume but it looks like the trade is somewhat going in favor of the signal.  Here's what my chart looked like.

I also like to ignore signals that are counter-trend.  Does anyone else have any input on filtering signals?

--- 帖子 #2551 ---
sorry, english isn't my native language.

Hi all,

I'm reading the thread for the last days, i'm stay in the page 89 (1300 post readed) and i have some questions.

1) The pdf says: to calculate SL do: candle_high-candle_low and next TP = SL. But... if i do a secondary strenght trade, i need use swing high (or low) to SL. The question is, in SS is  TP=SL or TP=candle_high-candle_low

2) I'm only see expert advisors programed, i dont like it, because i dont like automatic trading. i can found in the nexts pages of post some indicator likes pipsnailer for this method.

Best Regards,

Best Trades,

Hi All,

I was read all of the thread! I was make a litle indicator to the signals of this system, can you try & test this?

Looking the graph:

the (1) signals are trades,

the (2) signals are Second Strength Trades

the (3) i don't know if it's valid or not, ¿can you confirm? it's a mix of the type a and b of the SS.

Just got a signal on USD/CHF for today...

Not sure if I'm going to take it though.  Is anyone taking it?

--- 帖子 #2556 ---
Yes I've got it because is according to the 200SMA

--- 帖子 #2557 ---
It looks pretty good to me.. I think the AO is going to turn green the next candle.  Where did you put your stop?

edit: I think I'm going to put my stop at the low of today's candle...around 1.1466 for a 282 pip stop.

--- 帖子 #2558 ---
I put it at 11203

I made a few trades on this system which I started using about a month ago.  After a big hit I decided to start filtering the signals using 150 SMA and only taking trades according to the overall trend.

Trading Record

Second strength long EUR/GBP on 10/8/08 good for +365 pips.  My first half was closed out at +365 pips and my stop that was set for breakeven was hit.

Second strength long on 10/14/08 EUR/USD I was stopped out for -373 pips.  I blindly followed the rules of the system and took a long signal in a massive downtrend which was against my better judgement.

Second strength long on 10/14/08 CHF/JPY I was stopped out for -330 pips.  Again, this long was against the trend and against my better judgement.

After these two losses I decided that I would try to only take first strength trades following the trend due to the economic crisis around the world.

11/03/08 - Long signal for USD/CHF.  The 150 SMA was trending up and there was no major resistance so I took the long.  I set the stop to the day's low at -282.  I'm currently up +111 pips with a first target of 282.

So over a month I took four trades

Long EUR/GBP  +362

Long EUR/USD -373

Long CHF/JPY -330

Long USD/CHF +111 (still open, will be +282 if I win)

So right now I am -230 pips over a month of trading.

If I win the USD/CHF that is still open I will be at -59 pips.

Keep in mind this is taking 2 second strength trades that were against the trend and my better judgement.  I was impatient and couldn't wait to make trades which is why I took these signals and went long in a massive downtrend.  If I had filtered these 2 signals with the 150SMA I would be +362 and +111 for a total of +473 at this time, +644 if I win the open USD/CHF.

I really like the system, but you need to use common sense to filter out the signals and you will be profitable.  I'm not sure if blindly following the signals makes you profitable.  Could someone clarify this?

--- 帖子 #2562 ---
I'm interested in this, although I prefer to manually filter my signals it would be nice to have an EA alert me to valid signals.

I have heard a lot of talk on this AshFX, however I have a few questions I’m looking forward for them to be answered in a timely manner. A friend of mine says that he had much better profits using it on 15m time frame, isn’t it supposed to be used on a daily basis?. Is it true it can only be used with FXDD platform? I know they are not registered on the NFA or CTFA

--- 帖子 #2568 ---
I don't know why you said "in a timely manner". Your not paying for the system. People reply when they get around to it and if they want to.

Note the name of the thread. It is a daily system as originally presented. If your friend has better results on a 15 minute chart you should talk to him and decide on your own how to trade the system. Some people have used it on a 4 hour chart.

The system was originally tested on FXDD. That is the main reason to use FXDD for the signals. The other reason (in my mind) was so we could compare signals in the thread. If you like the system I would suggest running it on 3 MT4 platforms with different server times. Compare the results. Just because Ash originally tested and developed it on FXDD does not necessarly mean that is the best platform for the daily signal.

FXDD's status with the regulators is harder to define. FXDD has a 'pending' status with the NFA. I don't know if they will complete.  NFA ID: 0397435 if you want to go to the NFA site and look up the principals. http://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet/...d=0397435&rn=N

The important thing to remember is that you do not need to trade this system with a FXDD live account. You can use a demo FXDD account to get the daily signals and then use your broker of choice. One that you feel is safe, secure, and fair.

--- 帖子 #2572 ---
Thanks for the info, I am just going to test it on my tradeview platform as well as I do it on my FXDD demo account to compare the daily signals, I understand it is a daily system I noticed it as soon as I got into this thread, however as I said and you also said It may be implemented on different time frames, I was just looking for some experiences with it. Regarding the registration on the NFA, is not my first concern right now, indeed I was told they are registered with CTFA which is enough for me.

[ Ver_1_Build_03 - Nov 14, 2008:spread filter implemented to avoid trades when spread is too high implemented the possibily to select the type of of trades: only normal trade, only second strength trade or both Attachment [/quote]

can U pl. explain how to setup the inputs for Build_03 thanks

--- 帖子 #2575 ---
I haven’t heard anything like that before. I assume it is more useful when you are trading on a short term way. Sounds cool, however I couldn’t figure out how to get it downloaded. I would also like to know about how spread varies depending on the pair, so maybe that’s the point on getting this spread filter.

--- 帖子 #2576 ---
The Spread is the difference between Ask/Bid for a given pair. For example if you examine the XAUUSD on FXDD the spread is 85 pips, this means when you enter the Trade on this pair you start with -85 pips.

--- 帖子 #2577 ---
I am aware of what a spread is, I mean with the difference between Ask/Bid. My point is when it comes to using this spread filter, it seems you will only trade if the spread is low by using this filter, so it depends on the pair somehow, as well as some other factors that may have affected the trend.

Atfx,

Thanks for your EA . I tested it on a 1 Hour timeframe on Alpari to check how it works.

Would have taken days on a daily timeframe.

It gave me many signals but took only one trade (on 22 pairs) since monday when it should have taken many.

Am I doing something wrong ? i attached the preset for you to look at

if you ve got some time.

--- 帖子 #2579 ---
can anybody tell me wich system is better the ASH or OZFX

--- 帖子 #2580 ---
A short signal came up today on EUR/CHF.  Since the pair is in a downtrend I took the trade.

I treated this as a first strength trade since the stoch line was barely past 50...

Enter short @ 1.5202

SL - 1.5432

TP1 - 1.4976

Opinions on this trade anyone?

--- 帖子 #2581 ---
My vote is for Ash. I have had good results (demo) using it on 4hr charts. Be sure to practice on demo first and keep your lot sizes very low. This system produces large SL's and TP's. So you must manage your risk or you could get killed fast.

--- 帖子 #2582 ---
And tried the recommended Daily TF?

Thanks

I had a computer "expert" help me install a new HD and OS - all screwed up and it will be a couple of weeks before I can get everything corrected.  I cannot download Ash's AO template/indicator.  I have successfully loaded  stochs and the AC from the Bill Williams indicator list.  But the AO on that list when put on to the chart has both the red nd green bars hanging down from a Zero (0) line like icicles and not up for green, down for red.  What settings do I use to correct this within the indicator?  Much appreciate the help as I would like to demo this on the Daily per post #1. p.

--- 帖子 #2584 ---
My results have been best with 4hr. Yes I've tried daily as well.

--- 帖子 #2585 ---
Hi all pippers,

I have been looking through this site and other similar sites which also use the same indicators (which look very promising). On viewing other trading systems i believe this thread would benifit a great deal with this indicator i am about to tell you about (due to the lack of time i am unable to provide pics ) it is known as centre of gravity also Arps Hurst Bands also Belkayate Bands. Basically they have a number of outter Bands and a central Middle Line , When prices reach these Outter bands there is meant to be 70% to 90% probability of bouncing back towards the middle line. Hence if we only trade at these pionts eg await for the price to touch them then await your Setup of AO,AC & Parabolic you should be in a more profitable trade.

A discription of the Arps can be found at :

http://www.esignalcentral.com/univer...arps/hurst.asp

Plus try googling !!!

Hope this can help some one out there.

Long Setup on AUD/JPY

My 150SMA is pointing down, but this looks like a pretty good setup...I have drawn a triangle which price seems to have broken to the upside...

Anyone have any comments on this setup?

--- 帖子 #2587 ---
No need to buy this....If you dig FF, you will find one for free.....

--- 帖子 #2588 ---
Hi ANTO,

Sorry Anto you have miss-understood me , my intention was to tell other pippers that this indicator is the most important i have used , which can be used on any system along with your own trusted timing indicators. This indicator is available FREE of charge on the FF, and once again i would advise people to look at or search FF for COG ( center of gravity )  Note : I am not trying to sell any body an indicator !!!!!!!! just trying to be of help.

nightpipper.

--- 帖子 #2589 ---
Center of Gravity repaints big time.

--- 帖子 #2590 ---
Ash,

Under the rules for second strength trades, you say that you can take a long trade if a) stochastics are above 50 (but below 80) or b) the AO is red, because it will usually turn green in the next few candles.

Can you take a long trade if the stochastics are above 50 AND the AO is red? I have attached an example.  Let me know your opinion on taking a trade like this.

--- 帖子 #2591 ---
hi nightpipper

do you have an indi for this?

--- 帖子 #2592 ---
Looks like we have a long set up on GBP/CHF. However, its been in a downtrend and personally I won't be taking the trade.

My charting package is FXPro.

--- 帖子 #2593 ---
GBP is trending down against all the majors, USD, EUR, JPY and CHF. I wouldn't take a long on it either. Your indicators show a difference between FXPro and FXDD. FXDD shows on Jan 2, 2009 a short (red) candle, PSAR above, and red AO.

--- 帖子 #2594 ---
Hindsight is 20/20, but this would have been a nice trade. Currently up over 450 pips...

--- 帖子 #2595 ---
Looks like the following possible trades are setting up:

GBP/USD (long)

CHF/JPY (short)

Agreed?

--- 帖子 #2596 ---
They both seem like decent second strength setups.  The candle that formed the signal on GBP/USD looks bullish but I'm not so sure that the downtrend is over.

CHF/JPY short looks good also.  Take a look at this weekly chart there is a nice pin bar that formed at the 50% fib retracement of the downtrend.

I'm a little worried with second strength trades because it seems like lately a lot of them aren't working out...

--- 帖子 #2597 ---
Cable seems to be a winner if someone took it.

--- 帖子 #2598 ---
Yep, up nicely on it at the moment. And the CHF/JPY is working its way back in my direction.

--- 帖子 #2599 ---
I closed out the GBP/USD trade at +279 and the CHF/JPY is up +15 at the moment. It's been against me most of the day.

Yes, I understand that I closed the GBP/USD early compared to the authors rules.

--- 帖子 #2600 ---
Nice one lholcomb. Keep it up...

--- 帖子 #2601 ---
hi everyone

i found that usdjpy has a good setup for short. anyone agree?

--- 帖子 #2602 ---
EDIT: see attachment below

I'm not sure about this one.

Good - Pair is in a downtrend, ash's indicators line up nicely except AO is still green.

Bad - Price hit the 50% fib I drew and seems to be retracing up.  White areas were previous resitance and now may represent support.

Opinions??

--- 帖子 #2603 ---
.

--- 帖子 #2604 ---
hi thank you for your post

this is good for my style. since I enter the next day only if a retracement on the 61.8 of the daily signal candle occurs. My exit will be at a Price of 90.

--- 帖子 #2605 ---
So you are waiting to enter on a retracement to the white line (61.8 fib @ 92.16) with a target of the green line (90.00)??  Where are you placing your stop and how did you come up with that target?  It seems like a good idea because I've noticed that there are usually retracements right after the signal candle so waiting doesn't seem like a bad idea.

--- 帖子 #2606 ---
Just a reminder, NFP is tomorrow. I will be watching from the sidelines.

--- 帖子 #2607 ---
Well, i picked up this somewhere else in this forum (i think in the 4h macd strategy).

I draw fib the opposite side. But only the body!

So the trade goes from 61.8 (91.74) to 161.8(90.25 not 90.00 sorry)

Look at the pictures and see how often the daily candle retrace to this point....(pic2 and3)

The fibs from pic2 seemed to be significant days later(but thats not the point, just interesting..)

Yesterday it failed but it came very close...(pic4)

--- 帖子 #2608 ---
Interesting strategy.  So do you always wait for a 61.8% retrace of the signal candle to enter or do you use other fibs?

--- 帖子 #2609 ---
if i want to reduce my risk,.. yes.

something that can be done is to enter 1. trade immediately after the signal and the 2. trade at the 61.8 retrace. So you catch the trade but limit your risk.

--- 帖子 #2610 ---
you may have noticed that the usdjpy failed to touch the 61.8 fib just for 10 pips...

--- 帖子 #2611 ---
this could be a good one tonight..

--- 帖子 #2612 ---
I Agree, good for second strenght trade, will watch out for it later

--- 帖子 #2613 ---
It turns out to be a winner also

--- 帖子 #2614 ---
Good Call Pungy.

If you were able to enter at around the open things are looking up. (actually down but you know what I mean ;-)

We are currently at .5524 -- anyone know of any significant S+R zones in the area?

--- 帖子 #2615 ---
For me, i will just wait for the AO to turn green then i will close the second lot. I'll stick with the system's exit rule

--- 帖子 #2616 ---
I'm sticking with the rules too for now.

They generally haven't let us down so far ... if it ain't broke I'm not gonna try to fix it :-)

I was just overzeleous because I just went live with the system and we're coming up on my first (live) closing.

--- 帖子 #2617 ---
I'm new to this thread and from what I've seen so far, it looks like a very promising system. I admit that I have not read the entire thread yet, but perhaps someone could shed some light on the EAs.  I think there are 3 or 4 EAs for this system.  First of all, do they work? - and - Why is AshFX_Daily_EA being sold for 100 Euros?  Is it worth the money?  I don't mean to show disrespect, I'm just trying to figure out why some are free and this one is being sold.

--- 帖子 #2618 ---
Simple, there was a programmer called MTA4BoneWeb, came on, started releasing EAs, saw that he had a lot of downloads, and proceeded to sell the EA. Ash got angry and left.

I'm another programmer who has left the code open for everyone to look at.

--- 帖子 #2619 ---
It seems the other EA which is for sale has with it some 'modifications' to the original strategy... These modifications are outlined on the seller's website.

It also seems far too many have simply chopped and changed the rules to the point that the system never worked for them.... amazing how the story of why the turtles' returns varied during the experiment holds true to this day.

Spent most of today trying to code it (in order to learn) but with enough bugs to make me grow grey hair... It seems to work well on the lower timeframes as well based on a manual test...

--- 帖子 #2620 ---
RR hit the nail on the head.

But it wasn't just him, it was others who were selling my system on eBay, other websites, clickbank, and you'll even find it on youtube apparently.

--- 帖子 #2621 ---
His "modifications" are simply cosmetic, and an afterthought to counteract any claims of fraud, in addition to being able to claim his version is unique.

Sorry, I couldn't keep quiet on this matter.

--- 帖子 #2622 ---
Anyway, moving on...

Some people have been asking me to continue support for this thread due to it's dying nature. I haven't posted anything here for a while, but hopefully things will get moving again.

I have however been continuing support for the system over at the forum on my website; but nevertheless, there is a lot of valuable information here, and a lot of beneficial contribution from respected members, that it would be a shame for the thread to end up in the dungeons...

--- 帖子 #2623 ---
Hi Ash, nice to have you back - although I like your other forum (and the goodies there....).

I only wish, you would update the "pipnailer" as well - for good or for bad.

All the best

Forex37

--- 帖子 #2624 ---
Hey 37, thanks for the comments.

As for the Pip Nailer, we'll see in the future what can be done with it. Also, I'm in the process of finalising some tweaks to the AshFX System.

--- 帖子 #2625 ---
I have been a follower of Ash systems and got very sad when some people started sending me private messages to buy so called Advanced AshDaily and stuff like that. This made me stop even posting results or comments..  Quite sick some people are anyway it is good to have Ash back..  Regards  SmartKenya

--- 帖子 #2626 ---
I didn't even know these fraudsters were actually private messaging people! God, how low some people are. Thanks for bringing that to my attention dude.

It's good to be back. Many thanks for everyone's support whilst I was away.

I'll be releasing an updated version of AshFX Daily at the start of next week.

--- 帖子 #2627 ---
Ok, this could be a good short for Monday, if it closes as bearish today.

--- 帖子 #2628 ---
Nice to see you back, Ash.

While I'm new to this site and have spent most of mine time reading and absorbing the information, AshFxDaily was the first system I used during demo trading, with decent success. Just abou the time I was getting the hang of it was when you found out about the scumbags selling your system to others and you left, which is completely understandable to me. Welcome back mate, and thank you for your efforts. I like the daily system.

--- 帖子 #2629 ---
Which it never.

--- 帖子 #2630 ---
Hey Zal,

I'm glad to hear that I made a difference in helping new traders to improve their trading. And many thanks for your support, really appreciated.

AshFX is still being used by many traders, but just wait for the updated version... hehe.

--- 帖子 #2631 ---
I would like to see the updated version, Ash.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #2644 ---
Hi all, is there anybody who currently use this system ?

is it working now?

--- 帖子 #2645 ---
I've tried out many, many systems (same as all the other 'would be traders' out there :-) and I always come back to this one because of its ease of use and its 'set and forget' characteristics. Must confess that I've found it somewhere else on the internet (without the stochastics, only the AC, AO and PSAR) and added a MACD to it. It's one of a few systems that seem to give consistent, longer term profits, although only since a couple of months; might have to do, for the bigger part, with my own improved trading abilities, but you should still give it a try.

Before I open any trades, I look at correlated pairs and after getting some idea of overall trend I look for entries on the H4 charts (retracements - also use the MT4 Fibonacci retracements tool for this). Be aware of support/resistance area's on your charts (zoom out, as to view several days at the time) and don't get in too quick - don't be one of the herd, who gets tricked in to false breakouts by the market makers...). The 'round numbers' area's are of special importance too and I avoid getting into a trade when price hovers around them, up and down 20 or so pips.

Don't know if you're new to trading, but thought I'd give this general advice for all new traders who might come across this thread...

Cheers and good luck!

--- 帖子 #2646 ---
i will try this strategy, thank you, forexmoments
