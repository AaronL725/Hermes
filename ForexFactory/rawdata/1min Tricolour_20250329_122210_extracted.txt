This is another system I use I have only 3 or 4 that I use through out the day Dredding pivot system on 5min The 1min triangle breakout and this more mechanical system uses 1 chart on the 1min time frame On the chart we place Price in candle form I then have a 21,34 and 55 Exponential Ma's these are Fibonacci numbers I then multiply by 3 to give me the trend on a 3 min chart we end up with 63 .. 102 .. 165 exponential ma's on our 1min chart This gives us a trend direction 63 above 102 above 165 we look for longs 63 below 102 below 165 we look for short We then need pull back on a larger time frame than the 1min............ and we need a pull back on the 1min time frame for our entry For this we set up 2 stochastic The fast or entry stoch is set to 15.3.9 low/high The slow or pull back is set to 30.6.18 low high We set OB OS on the fast/entry at 20 80 We set OB OS on the long term pull back 10 90..we want confirmation of a strong deep pull back or a sharp strong rally We use the stochastic colour so it visually shows us when the parameters are meet for a trade And i scale my ma thin thicker and thick to visually see when they are lined up correctly. The chart shows examples of Friday For a long we need ma in correct order Long term stoch green indicating longer term pull back Short term stoch green indicating 1min pull back These must be green at the same time. The price must pull back into the space between the blue and green area We eneter on Tick up of fast stoch with green candle For a short we need ma in correct order Long term stoch red indicating longer term rally Short term stoch red indicating 1min rally These must be red at the same time. The price must rally into the space between the blue and green area We eneter on Tick down of fast stoch with red candle Stop loss 1 pip above below Hi or low of recent candle Risk a % of your account on each trade For me that's 5% so if my entry to my SL is 8 pips I calculate 5% of my account and buy contracts My TP is 10% gain on account so in this example that will be 16 pips of movement Therefore my risk is 5% my TP is 10% my risk reward will always be 2;1 Start at London Open close as your preference P UPDATE Please follow link to go to page 96 for details on Tricolor V2 - http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...71#post5274371 Please fllow link to go to page for details of 5min exit http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...36#post5356236

wonderful concept why dont we add pivot lines (1 min extremely reacts to it) and filter Trade time to market opens (London, NY) may be can use atr5/25 so after making 2% we can quit for the day, hang around with kids, family, GFs set daily target at 2% make 40% a month lets give this a demo try but more filters needed

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Hi Paulus, it seem a nice system. Thanks for sharing! I'd like to know why ( in your last image) didn't you take the trade before your first win (there were the some contidion of stochastic oversold) and the trade immediately after the lost (there was divergency too)? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #4 ---
The stoch filters very well dont forget both green at the same time Friday 9 signals made well over your 2% .. more like 60 % This is simple clean to the eye..I dont want to use pivots here on the 1min the whole concept is to take advantage of 1 min movement at any area in the market Cheers

Thanks![/quote Sorry my fault 1st Point Any signal that triggers above the blue and green for a long does not qualify we need a strong pull back Same reasons for a short we need the trade to pull back into the blue and green trade area That trade did not so not trade 2nd Point If you look at the trade after the failure as you suggest you will see the 3 mas not lined up correctly..this pull back is to strong Have now added this to 1st page Hope that helps P

--- 帖子 #6 ---
[quote=Paulus;5128701] That's all clearer now, thanks! Btw, i've loaded your template, and now I can see better what you say.... How do you manage such fast trades in 1 min Tf? You have to fastly calculate pips for Sl (plus spread?) &amp; TP (plus spread?) and decide the size of lots accordingly for you 5% risk. I want to say: 3 instead of 4 pips and there's already a big difference in lot size..... Do you use a trade management EA with MM?

--- 帖子 #7 ---
thks Paulus, i always check out all the systems u post

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Hi Paulus... In your first post, first picture, the second trade (long entry) comes well below the blue/green zone. What makes you take the long trade here, the fact that the MAs are still in order for a long or the fact that the stochs are oversold?

--- 帖子 #9 ---
maybe the weakness of this system is WAITING!! you have to wait every single minute until you get the signal live trading is a magnitude difficult than back-test with this patience is the key i hope we have an alert for this

--- 帖子 #10 ---
I like this. Very clean. Very simple. Excellent.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Paulus, in your description you list both stoc as low/high. In the attached charts the slow stoc is set at close/close. Which is correct, please? Thanks......

--- 帖子 #12 ---
I don't know if this trading system will work out in real market environment, and i don't really like this trading style, nor the money management.. But meh, this stuff makes 100% sense.. kudos to you Paulus!!

--- 帖子 #13 ---
20% today...

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Here is a quick 5 pip trade using Paulus's set up. MA lined up for short, Stochs overbought. Rejection at resistance level. Could have stayed in this for another 4-5 pips.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Great morning here (US West Coast) .....

--- 帖子 #16 ---
I'm keeping track of the trades, i don't think i will ever trade this system live, but i really like the idea behind it. I will start a forward test tomorrow, AvaFX broker, from 0800 GMT+1 to about 1830. Good looking chart today, as we are in a good trending day. Today's trades so far:

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Hi SteMahg.. Don't mean to be rude here...but...If you don't plan on ever trading this methodology live why bother with it at all. Seems like you're wasting your time here.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
I hope Paulus doesn't mind me showing a divergence counter trend trade I just took. I know he hasn't covered this yet.We have a nice down move going and we get another thrust that makes a lower low. The fast Stoch is showing divergence with the new price level. Wait for an up candle to be formed and bang..a quick 15 pips with little risk.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Because now by now i'm working on hourly charts, and i get bored really fast, and forward testing a system (that i really like) is a good way to fill up my free time As i said i really like the system and the idea behind it, but my experience tells me that a system like this cannot last in a live environment, due to spread (or fees), slippage, stop-haunting, volatility spikes etc.. I hope to be wrong, and if i will i'm ready to fund a small live side-account. Time will tell [EDIT] Another +10% in the meantime Will post chart at 18/18.30 GMT+1

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hi Paulus, Could you post the mq4 file of the StochasticColor indy? My Mt4 crashes everytime I load the indicator. Many thanks. julai

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Mine also crashes. Tried two different MT4 providers.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Yes, that struck me as well! According to your rules is is a condition that price pulls back into the blue / green zone ... but in that example price exceeded that zone ... In that context ... the same example in post 1 ... the 2 arrows showing "Fail 5 %" and "10 %" .. I cannot see any trades in that area or to what are the 2 arrows refering to ? Thanks a lot!

--- 帖子 #23 ---
As said i'm posting the EOD chart, from 08 'till 18 GMT+1. Trending day, we have 6 trades, 4 positive and 2 negative, a virtual +30% increase. Tomorrow i will start my forward test, see you!

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Some of your losers I won on because I waited for the short stoch to cross back down over the 80 line as opposed to taking it while still in overbought territory.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
I just traded according the to the allignment of the three moving averages. As long as they were in proper order for a short or for a long, I just took trades in that direction, regardless of where the pullback came to.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Cl / Cl sorry p

--- 帖子 #27 ---
I dump things in FF that are in my head and Ive had good results with if you use just 1 part or it gives an idea then you have gained from reading the post ..we have to shre ideas The % method is good when trading across 2 or 3 pairs as the $/pip value is different Ie make 30 pips on a $1/ pip and lose 15 pips on a $2 pip pair and your break even on the day Risk 5% or 1% of bank on each and your in the black Plus I see guys stating they take 100pips a day out of the market but thier account doesnt grow..when I see 10% gain on each winner and 5% loss on each loser I feel good .. P

--- 帖子 #28 ---
here u go P

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Thanks Paulus. Then that would make all the charts and results listed so far in this thread unrepresentative of your method. I believe the template download uses close/close for the slow stoc. Suppose we should change that for accurate recults.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
yes you can do this gets you in later but may give a better chance of winning due to the fact that the stoch is moving down past OB now and not just down ticking above 80 meaning possible upward movement still What ever you feel comfortable with P

--- 帖子 #31 ---
set to show market open times in your own time zone Cheers

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hi Paulus ! Thanks for sharing your trading idea By the way what settings do you recommend on the 5min charts ? Regards Bernhard

--- 帖子 #33 ---
I havnt looked at 5min with this..I do trade on the 5min with another system but use the 1min with this while waiting for signals on that cheers P

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Makes sense Started my forward test on EU, GU, EJ, UC, however i will see if i'm able to follow all those pairs together on the 1min

--- 帖子 #35 ---
A question Paulus, it's really important: how do you manage the spread? 1st trade stopped by spread.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Here is a EUR long trade I took for 8 pips. I know, not a big trade but I'm still learning too. On the first chart we can see the EUR has come down to a support level. The MAs are still in line for an up trade but look ready to cross to the downside. Now most of the time I would wait until the MAs are lined up with a bit more slope to the upside but in this case we have a nice rejection off the support area. The stochs are in oversold land and we get a nice bullish candle.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Are you still using the 123 countertrend method on the M5 charts?

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Sorry been away for a while I use spread betters dont forget so my calculation is quick when the trade is setting up Some times I mis calculate and get 7% other times I get 11 or 12 % in the end it is approx 10% Ive been having great success with this method A couple of changes I made which helped Taking the trade when the quicker Stoch comes up through 20 for a long and down 80 for a short If you look at the example of 2 nice signals the longer term was or had been green on this cycle The ma's were correctly lined up fast stoch went grey from green And the days signals for Friday If you got them all 35% ROC P

--- 帖子 #39 ---
for both the fast and slow stochs to be of the same colour at the o/b, o/s levels occurs only rarely. i only see about 3 entries on my chart where both were of the same colour. unless there is a fault with the stoch indi. so how on earth you wait for them to be of the same colour before taking trades is beyond me. you will be wasting hours, just to gain a few pips. tbh, there are far better ways of making pips and on that too on the 1m.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Its not the ip count that interested me its the amount of % I gain Each winning trade I get is 10% of my account balance each loser is 5% of my account balance On 5 days if I gain 10% of each that a 50% gain on my account the chart shows 35% ROC ..'Return on account'..so it you had 10k that's a gain on that day of £3,500 Your account will double every 2 weeks if you make 10% per day...for me thats 1 winning trade If I take a trade and the SL is 5 pips my TP is going to be 10 pips...that just 10 pips to most but because of my money management that's 10% gain for me if I win ..........5% loss if I lose that's a risk reward of 2;1 So many traders trade and win 100 pips but what is the relation ship between that and their account Dont think pips think risk reward and money management I dont see what so difficult looking at a chart saying to your self long term stoch is way above the zero line so no trade setting up..lets chill and wait we then see the stoch hit 10 and the ma's line up and then we look for trade entry...why why why do people want to trade every few minutes I trade the 5min using pivots and swing counts I can now also trade the 1min in a highly effective great risk to reward way Guys that scalp 4 pips often see trade go 20 pips against them to me you may as well throw your money down the drain this business is all about patients, risk to reward and money management On the 5min system in that thread I posted all my trades for quite a while and proved by using % not pips was the way to build account p

--- 帖子 #41 ---
look at this trade SL is 4 pips therefore TP is 8 pips Most people getting a 4 pip win would think great £40 win ! I think 10k account 5% risk = £500 / 4 pips stop loss = £125 per pip using spread betting account I win 8 pips which is a 10% return in this case I make 8 x £125 = £1000 Big difference from £40 because my risk reward is linked to my % gain Think % NOT pips

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Ya ever let the profits run or always have a predetermined take profit? thank you

--- 帖子 #43 ---
I completely agree.... I see so many methods here where you have to use 20 - 30 pip stop losses... the reason for that is because the entry is so imprecise. I'd rather use a 5-6 pip stop loss on a precision entry, get stopped out, and then re-enter at the correct location - instead of just entering randomly in the middle of a move and watch price dance around. I've been trading this with great success as well Paulus, solely on EU and AU. I have also included a 5,3,3 stochastic as well as a 9 and 18 EMA to catch trades in a really fast move. So as long as the very fast stoch pulls back into OB/OS, and the other two stochs aren't showing any color, I wait for the color to go away on the short stoch and take the trade. Sort of a "floor trader stochastic slingshot" I've also found that your short stoch combined with the 5,3,3 short stoch can be traded very well together (i.e. when they are both showing color) as long as the long stoch isn't showing any colour (i.e. not overbought or oversold) Anyway, thanks for the method, I think you are right in waiting for the quick stoch to leave the OB/OS area. One question... it looks like you switched the settings on the quick stoch... how come?

--- 帖子 #44 ---
hi. is there any reason to try it on those. all 4 are correlated esp as U/J hardly moves. e.g. EU,GU,EJ move the same direction. UC moves the same way, but on the opposite direction, and Eurocad hardly moves thru the year(range is not high imo) validating my point i would try it eu, au, ea, ec, gold perhaps. these all have low spread ECN broker. hi paulus this looks promising system.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Au works very well, even more so than Eu in my several weeks trading this. spread isn't as good, for me, however, but not really an issue as you're looking for 10 pips at a minimum usually. The indications come at different times (for au and eu), but I won't take a trade in one or the other if i'm already in a trade on the other.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
hi jm the broker u should change to is pepperstone .com only 0.5 pip for au duringy london comission only 7.50 round turn

--- 帖子 #47 ---
I needed it to react quicker as I was now using the move from below 20 or above 80 going through the line This got me in a candle sooner and worked allot better P

--- 帖子 #48 ---
I've been trading this on my TD account where the bad spreads are. Its sort of my "trial account". I'll be moving this sytem to my trading on my Interactive Brokers account shortly as its been working very well for me. IB has .5 spread commissioned trades as well - $5 per round trip. Thank you for the advice though - I'm not sure if pepperstone is only spot forex. Both TD and IB allow me to trade pretty much any security I want which is something I do take advantage of.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Do you wait for the color to go away, i.e. for the green to go away when coming out of overbought, or are you just eyeballing the 20 level to take the trade?\ EDIT: I'm going to trade with a 15,2,9 short stoch tonight. It doesn't look as messy as the 15,1,9 but looks to be a bar sooner than the 15,3,9

--- 帖子 #50 ---
up through 20 Green to grey Down through 80 red to grey we seem to get some very nice signals in the session London closes..Sydney opens and before Tokyo opens P

--- 帖子 #51 ---
yes there was a clear winner there good pips asian session thats why if u want to be full time trader u need to be alert all sessions sleep cycle permitting . if no signal just keep the screen open but read a book nearby. e.g. im sydney so i should be trading sydney, frankfurt, and london open 1st hr, and new york afternoon to close

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Hi, Paulus. Great threads! If it`s not a secret - what broker do you use? I guess it has to be the broker with extremely low spreads and ultra fast execution? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Interesting approach, JM Could you show an example or two of how you implement your trade using the additional indies? Thanks much, Cliff

--- 帖子 #54 ---
long eu @ 1.34368 edit: the moment, I posted it: S/L hit.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
long eu @ 1.34351

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Forget m1 charts... use Range Bar charts, much better... I'm using something very similar to this. Instead I'm using 100 ema, 50 ema combined with 100/1/1 stochastic above or below 50 level for trend. Stochastic 14/1/1 80/20 for pull back, RSI 5 above below 50 level for entry.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
long eu: target hit: 1 win, 1 loss, so overall win until now. (post 54 + 55)

--- 帖子 #58 ---
long gu @ 1.56095 EDIT!!!!! I made a mistake: the the 63 ema was already between the other MA's.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
As I made a mistake at the gu long (MA's not in order), I closed the trade early with a small win. Edit: nevertheless, it would have been a full win!

--- 帖子 #60 ---
nice system could u post ure .tpl im interested in having a look. i see range bar charts on nexas's thread i know how to use

--- 帖子 #61 ---
short gu @ 1.56254

--- 帖子 #62 ---
post 61: I have to calm down. Again , made a mistake with the MA's. Closed with a small win.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
hi price not too bad for short. level is medium. trend is trendless -ranging.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Nice I am trying this system now, but this will only work with a high leverage right? With my 1:50 and 1000USD I will not make enough money per pip I guess, since I can trade 1 Lot max.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Tried two trades on demo account, both times everything seemed fine but it turned out badly.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Hi BobbyJ. I'm learning too. But I will give you my opinion. Even though this is a more mechanical system, we have to add a little bit experience. jmflukeiii (post 24) and Paulus (read posts 30, 38 and 50) said to wait with the entry, until the fast stochastic passes through the 20 or 80 line, changing colour to grey. This would have helped you stay out of the GBPUSD trade. For the AUDUSD trade: jmflukeiii said in another scalping thread, that he always looks at higher TF's too. So, I think, that minimum the next higher TF has to agree with your entry. See the attached charts. On the 1m chart there are marked 3 possible entries with vertical lines (where your trade failed). At this moment, price has broken above 3 previous swing highs (the line at 1.0262). The 3 SH's ran against this line or small zone (=resistance). So price broke above a resistance line (warning!). Now look at the higher TF, the 5m chart: just before the 3 vertical lines (the possible entries from 1m), there are 2 strong momentum bars and these 2 bars erase the down move from the 8 bars before. Momentum is up at this moment (see also 5m stoch's). If we see that, we stay out. I never traded the 1m chart before and all is very quick here. I have to quicken my thinking and situation-judging and that requires a certain experience, I think.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
counter trend trades risky when AUD is in bullish bias past 2 weeks. counter trend higher % closer to 1.0295 handle

--- 帖子 #68 ---
hello Paulus thanks for sharing your system. may I know how long you are using this system and what is your strike rate? thanks

--- 帖子 #69 ---
i am in... lets see... thanks kader

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Musashi, Would you please to share further your idea? Thanks, Anton

--- 帖子 #71 ---
I will my friend, just not yet.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
4 entries today. 3 winers, 1 loos. I still learning this system, so thats why my RR is 1:1. SL=TP=1%. Within few days i am going to incrase RR to win 2-3% per trade.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
paulus could you please clarify whaT the settings are on the colour stochs ?? each time you load a chart, it has a different setting on ! also, it appears the ma's are not really needed. you can just take the trades off the colour stochs, the success rate that way is higher.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
I totally agree with you Paulus, about thinking in terms of %'s and not pips. (Actually I think in terms of units. In your case 1 unit is 5%). However, there are 2 things about this. 1) If you are targeting 8 pips to return 10%, that is appx 1.25% per pip, which may be above the maximum possible on the account depending on the margin requirement of the broker, (Who do you use?) 2) Beware of slippage unless you have guaranteed SL, which will cost you pips and may not be able to be set 6 pips or less from the market price. At 1.25% per pip, a 40 pip slipped exit could be very damaging to an account and mentally. (Of course, this is all broker dependant, but the past months movement on EURUSD has shown whopping big moves). Just a couple of thoughts. G-Man

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Two profit trades. RR=1,5. The third one i didnt take because of moving averages in wrong order.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Three trades. Many times i see that 10 pips profit is optimal.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
you only had 3 trades today ? why would you enter the third trade there, the price hadnt cross below the ma's yet ??

--- 帖子 #78 ---
candle do not have to cross MA's. MA's should be in correct order only. Yes, only three trades today because of lack of time. Can you show me your trades today taken on this system?

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Hope we've seen the same signals

--- 帖子 #80 ---
If I had traded about 2 PM I would have SL like you (the first trade on your chart). No holly grail on the world.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
hi i have my own scalping system i trade. i use the tricolour system as an added filter...nothing else. i only aim for 6 pips per trade with sl at last swing low or 6 pips whichever is lower. i only scalp 1 min when i feel like it. otherwise iam a swing trader...long term. today i made on scalp: 6 pips, 4 pips, 6 pips, -6pips, -3 pips, 5 pips, 6 pips, 8 pips, 6 pips, 5 pips, 4 pips. total = 41 pips. on your chart entries, do you enter immediately when the price moves back down the ma's ? whats your criteria ...

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Hi Paulus and thanks for sharing. I use a similar method off the 1min tf. Those who said its a waste of time trying to grab few pips on the 1mi tf don't probably know how to use the time frame in question. From experience, if say EurUsd moves 50pips, I usually make 80pips or more. How you may ask. The reason being that on the 1min tf, a 15pip move affords me the opportunity to grab about 8pips having paid spread. Sometimes, I get more than this. The beauty of the 1min tf is that you profit from almost every meaningful fluctuations (every 20pip move) thus compounding your profit. I will test your system during the weekend on EurUsd and Gold to see what I can benefit from it. Once again, thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Hi Paulus, Can you please explain the rationale behind the parameters you used for your stoch? Am trying to adapt the system to XAUUSD. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Paulus can are you trading this method everyday? Would be appreciated if you would post some charts of previous days trading to reinforce and compare to our own trades. Thx, Todd

--- 帖子 #85 ---
I enter when both stochs cross overbought levels (80 and 90) for Short and oversell (20 and 10) for longs. I have not changed any Paulus rules. But i have observed that for Longs the shortest MA shouldn't turned down (without crossing others MA's yet) to enter trade. For Shorts vice versa.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Is there a particular script that you guys use to enter the trade and that calculates the percentage and pips, etc?

--- 帖子 #87 ---
i was talking about the entries on your charts above. why did you decide to enter at those particular points ? they dont seem to tally up with the rules.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
they dont seem to tally up with the rules. Why? I entered for rules from post no.1 from page no.1.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Hi Todd I have been trading this system .. along side version 2 which to me is more accurate and profitable I have also been working with an Ea coder re an indicator but these things take such a long time and you wouldn't believe the amount of questions and queries you get... . Tricolor V2 has tried to address a few problems It gives a few more signals as one of the criteria is for the long term stoch which is based on a 5min chart to be either oversold or overbought. If this doesnt give green or red no matter how good the setup is the signal will not be valid as the rules stand Aslo the 102ma ( Blue) can remove alot of good signals as it moves up and down through the red and green ma's as price is pulling back hard or rallying hard By the way it is 102 because on the 3min chart its a 34ma and on the 5 min chart its a 21ma both Fibonacci numbers 1,1,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89, The red is a 63ma because on the 3min chart its a 21ma and on the 5min chart its a 13ma - Fib numbers The green is 165ma because on the 3min chart its a 55ma and on the 5min chart its a 34 ma - Fib numbers I gain allot of 5% wins using version 2 over version 1 as it gets around the long term stoch We also noticed that 2 or 3 trades with nice price action..ie nice steps up or down often run for alot of % I now use a Stop loss as before but with a fib tool marked at 5% ,10%,20%,30% etc etc when I enter an trade and it hits 5% i move stop to the close of the entry candle If I hi 10% level I move stop to 5% level if I hit 15% level i move stop to 10% level etc etc yest on GU I had a trade that hit 30%..I will post details later prob on new tread linked to this one..you guys may not like it but I think it gives more opportunities during the day with a possibility of a nice % win. All we are doing here is identifying long term trend and entering on a strong rally or retracement, We are also now trying to improve on the risk reward although that was set a a ratio of 2:1 which is good in my opinion Also guys that keep better records than me may well find out that taking 10% with a fixed stop of 5% produces better results than larger wins but also larger amounts of 0% wins But I will post the system and let people compare Cheers P

--- 帖子 #90 ---
here is an example from 1 of the swaps I trade UsdChf The black arrow is a normal Tricolor signal which hits 10% V2 also captures this signal and using its moving stop at sliding increments also gets 10% The red signal is a V2 signal and by chance this gets taken out at 0%,V1 doesnt trigger as the longer term stoch is not over sold With a fixed 5% sl and fixed 10% win this would of gained 10% Giving a return of 20% on your account over 2 trades P

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Thanks for working on this, I really liked this system from the getgo. Are these Versions you talk about EAs you're making? I'd prefer to just trade it manually... what is different in V2 than V1?

--- 帖子 #92 ---
I will try and post tomorrow but have family here A good example of the difference between the 2 system is that after London Close ( A period I do not trade) we had a decent signal which the original system would not of picked up as the longer stoch was not OS enough The V2 picked it P

Interesting... looking forward to hearing more. My biggest problem was the lack of opportunities following the rules exactly. I love trading reversals though especially in the direction of a 5 minute trend so I'm excited to see the modifications you've come up with. Currently I'm just using a 50 SMA on a 5 minute chart and then looking on a tick chart for CCI oversold or overbought levels to get in with the direction of the 50 SMA.

Happy new year guys I'm a newbie, i don't know why my stop loss gets hit every time with this strategy. Here's a chart, i'm simulating with a broker with a large spread, but i marked the stop loss with the red line as if it was a broker with a tight spread.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
So it looks like you got rid of the longer stochastic and maybe the 102 MA, but put in place put some sort of MA +- a certain number of pips or a Keltner channel as the secondary filter to use alongside the shorter stochastic? Looks like a 63 (or shorter) period Keltner, no 102 MA, just the short and long EMAs,.. if the EMA's are in order and the stochastic is ob/os, and price is still within or on the correct side of the keltner, that's a trade? Is that close? Lots more trades that way, which I'd like. Or maybe its no 63, just the two long EMAs and the Keltner takes the place of the 63 as well as the long stoch.

Sorry for the huge delay here is the V2 Regards

--- 帖子 #97 ---
The man is back! How goes it? Too busy making a killing on this never ending downtrend?? In a strong downtrend, do you trade any other stochastic overbought even if the envelope hasn't pulled back up to above the other MAs? And do you still use V1 at all or have you switched solely to this? Thanks for the update and the work, excited to take a look at it

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Hi I dont use V1 at all although will look to make sure V2 is picking out more signals.. No Im guided by the envelopes.. if a trend is weak and goes down all day without a signal thats the way it goes...if you change to start taking weak pull backs on a normal day with a normal volatilty day you could get burnt on several trades dur to the fact the market will carry on against you untill those bands come above the ma's...of course we will always lose on some trades we have to cheers P

--- 帖子 #99 ---
I only see one trade today on this pair per the V2 rules. Is that correct?

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Simple, yet elegant. A high probability, and a high R:R. Absolutely beautiful man. I look forward to forward testing your method. I particularly like V2's Fibo tool use for a manual trailing stop. Well done!

--- 帖子 #101 ---
correct - last 2 days have shown very weak rallies and retracements But it made 25% ROC for a 5% risk cheers P

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Thanks Most things that have a chance of working are simple..this is not the holy grail but if it helps or you can use parts of it in another system or on another time frame then we have succeeded in our quest ...To help others and to receive help ourselves p

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Thanks Paulus. It has potentials on 5 min as well. I see it can pick up trades where the freebie system fails and vice versa.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Cheers for your new system Good work mate.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
First of all Paulus, thanks for your brillant simple approach. Tried V1 on the Dayly time frame and YES, it works also. I use OANDA as my broker, so I can adjust my "lot size" everytime exactly to my 1% risk. The smallest "lot" on their plattform is literally 1 Euro, (they will take such an order.) On the Dayly, you get very few opportunities, maybe 1 or 2 a week on 50 pairs... Interestingly though, with V2, I will try on any time frame (smaller charts on busy trading hours..London/N. York)...AND , instead of your 1 R Stop (5% in your case), I will simply put a trailing stop of 1 R, (which is not exactly the same, spikes could kick you out) but close enough, and gives me a chance to : open my computer any time, look for a trade (5 min, 15 min, Hour, etc..) put the order and go do something else..!! I will let you all guys know what happened after the first week of testing with real money.. Paulus thanks again..

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Look forward to it all we need is an edge...... 51% winners with 2:1 RR will do it Cheers

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Entered at 10.24, now moved SL to the level of original entry point.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Same trade different broker.. 2:1 rr hit.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
another 3 trades, 2 winners 1 loser

--- 帖子 #110 ---
2nd attempt on this EU trade.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Last 2 of the day for me.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Great Entry. As always good MM crutial.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
2xLong entry

--- 帖子 #114 ---
long signal. SL reached.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Short trade.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
I have found three signals during last minutes.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
U/CH Long TP taken at 5% level.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
I haven't taken this short because London is closed, and market is extremally oversold.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
I think it would be lossing trade.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Good morning guys! Thanks for sharing Paulus, this system looks really good and i will start with demo-trading on monday.. Is anyone of you already trading this system live? How do you guys handle news events? stop trading 30min before for example?! I also have to look for a new broker.. my ECN-broker allows a leverage of 1:200 and i guess that i need a higher leverage with my account size.. It's also good to know that this system is jmflukeiii-proofed - good to see you here.. Have a nice day! Mathias

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Paulus i have found three loss trades in a row. Tell me, did you take this trades? If not , why you didnt? Maybe all three signal bars are to close to each other and it should be better to give up in trading all signals? Fourth trade is a winning one with hugh profit.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
great job... i am trying something different... if i find this useful then i will post it here... thanks kader

--- 帖子 #123 ---
So close to have entry signal but "not all lights was green". What a pitty it would be great trade.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
1 trade per day with 5% TP is enough for me. How much it is per month?

--- 帖子 #125 ---
I think trades 1 and 2 where against the rules cause they were touching the MA!!!! Here´s a copy of the rules on a LONG SIGNAL (from Paulus´PDF): Price below bottom MA Entry candle below bottom MA

--- 帖子 #126 ---
That kind of performance would make you a millionare soon (compounding!!) This is my calculation: 100 Trades a month (that´s 5 a day.) 65 loosers/35 winners..(very conservative) Take profit on 2 R (2% for me, I risk 1%). 70 -65=5 5 % a month. Now, risking 2% it´s 10% a month. 10% a month starting with 1000 Euros, compound, makes a million in roughly 6 years.1,2 miilion if you compound weekly! Remember I´m talking about "only" 35 winners out of 100!! All possible, provided the sweet Tobin Tax doesn´t pass, and you don´t live in Germany (myself), or France....

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Does anyone of you have a recommendation for a low-spread forex broker with high leverage (1:400 or 1:500)? I have to find a new broker to trade this strategy .. I would love to find one without the virtual dealer plugin OR ECN but ECN with such a high leverage is not very realistic..

--- 帖子 #128 ---
I think you are right. It means that all candle (from low to its high) must be below MA. So , entry No1 and 2 are against Paulus's rules.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
First trades for today.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Dear truchtzero Can you name or post the red dotted indicator? Thanks so much!

--- 帖子 #131 ---
It is Envelopes. You can find it in your MT4. Navigator- indicators.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Is it valid or invalid signal for Short? I am not sure. Edit. It is not valid signal for short, because MAs are not in correct order. My mistake. I am still learning this great system.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Maybe somebody else can post signals, trades? I fill so alone in posting. If Paulus can post sth it would be great. Cheers

--- 帖子 #134 ---
I have found this setup too risky to enter.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Lets see what will happen

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Screenshot of great trade and...on next screen one question to you Paulus. Would you like to answer , it is very important to me to deeply understand this great system.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Thanks Paulus for this interesting system. I was little afraid, that the spread on 1min TF would slowly kill me, because the trades often are as big asi 3-4 pips, so I manualy backetested the January, starting on the 3th using 5min TF. Obeying the rules we have 8 wins and 8 loss. If we change the request for the candle and band to be below the lower (green) MA for longs, with the rule for candle and band to be below the red MA only, we got 16W and 17 L. So w/l ration is about 50% in both cases.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Hello First of all I want to thank Paulus for sharing this system. Seems very easy and a good complement to Hmaoui's system. Also thank you jmflukeii for let me know about this thread. Well, my question is about stochastic colour. Does it sometimes repaint the prevous bar? Thank You, Dragon

--- 帖子 #139 ---
It does not!!!!

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Thank you paulus for your another interesting method of trading! as always simple and profitable! cheers

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Lets start new day.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Lets see what happen

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Loss trade.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Win trade. I remark that many times i am not able to hold open trade till 10 or 15% level. Thats why i close trade at 5%level. It is a bit flustrating when after that price is going further to next level. I know that problem is in my mind. I affraid of turn wining trade to loss trade. I have to work about it . I need time to trust this system.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
the price moves sideways today.. no chance to get the really strong moves at the moment

--- 帖子 #146 ---
I am not talking about today market conditions. I am talking about general problems in my trading. If i want to gain 5-10% (what is much more than enough for me) per day i have to change my attitude.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Hello truchtzero, I've been there. What I do, is move SL to open price as the system dictates, and then you are on a free trade, i.e the worst thing can happen is close the trade with $0 in gains So once you are on a free trade you have nothing to worry about. Hope be helpful. Regards, Dragon

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Yes, you are right. I know that it is very usefull method. It sounds very easy and resonable. But.... when my open trade is ,lets say +7% it makes me very sad when it is closed on BE. I fell like looser who dont know how to manage open trades. I know it has no sense. But it is result of my many loose trades from past. It is hard to me to fully trust any system. But now i am learning to trust this system because i like it very much. If anyone can post some charts with trades it would be nice.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Perfect move with Frankfurt open this morning: Attached Image (click to enlarge) 30% trade! 9% yesterday.. so far: simply perfect! Have a successful day guys!

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Bravo. Perfect trade. It is early morning and you can turn off computer. On your screen i can see 5 pips spread on EU. Is it true value? I have 1,1-1,4 spread.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Thanks truchtzero, this system is so powerful! 30% reward for 5% risk.. @spread: 0,5pip because it's a 5-digit broker. Regards Mathias

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Do you have to pay any commision? It is very low spread. What broker is it?

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Commission is a little bit higher than 7USD/round turn but the spread is really good. The name of the broker is Pepperstone .. Regards Mathias

--- 帖子 #154 ---
7$ per lot (100,000) or minilot (10,000)? If it is 7$ per lot that means your transaction costs are: 7$+5$(spread)= 12$ per lot. I have no commision and spread is 1,1-1,4 pips = 11-14$ per lot. So it is more or less the same.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Per Lot (100,000) Mathias

--- 帖子 #156 ---
what broker do you use?

--- 帖子 #157 ---
fxpro

--- 帖子 #158 ---
BUT I don't have a conflict of interest with my ECN broker (at least I hope so). I would never trade such a strategy (2-5 pips SL for example) with a Market Maker. I have been with FxPro for 6 months last year and they are definitely not world's best broker (in my opinion).. But of course, everyone has to decide for himself/herself which broker is the best one for his/her trading style. The advantage of Pepperstone is that they offer an ECN-account with a high leverage (up to 1:400). kind regards Mathias

--- 帖子 #159 ---
How long do your trade with peperstone? i would prefer ecn-account too..

--- 帖子 #160 ---
You are right. I didnt say they are best. I only compare transaction costs.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
I'm demoing since yesterday.. There is also a Pepperstone Thread on FF ( http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...ht=pepperstone ) Some reported connection problems but my demo-experience is good so far.. @truchtzero right! It was not against you, rather against their ads.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Paulus, thanks for sharing!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #163 ---
are these 2 trade on eu right?

--- 帖子 #164 ---
right according to the rules but it's very hard to go long these minutes because of fundamentals. So i guess the bad EU-news are the reason for the down-trend this morning.. Regards Mathias

--- 帖子 #165 ---
3 loss signals in a row. I didnt take the third one because MA's were too close to each other (almost crossed)

--- 帖子 #166 ---
one more loss on eu... after we get a signal, the price often turns in the other direction and goes against us... maybe we should use a buffer of 1-2 pips before we take a trade? what do you think about it guys?

--- 帖子 #167 ---
When? Can you post chart?

--- 帖子 #168 ---
of course..

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Different broker, different data.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
This give u a good signal P/S: Paulus, first of all thank you very much for sharing with us your system. 2ndly, what I posted is a bit different from your original strategy, but the idea is from you. I hope you don't mind I post the chart. Let me know if u want me to take it out. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #171 ---
I just browse through the chart, I find lots of good signal with: - Envelopes + Stoch. The original idea is from Paulus. Thanks again Paulus.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
looks good.. range bars? .. 5 pips? 8 pips? Which EMAs do you use combined with the range bars? 165/63? Regards Mathias

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Yes, pic 1 - range bar, 5 pips. U can try 8 pips or 10 pips. I am applying Paulus's template to range bar. but, check out the 2nd pic - no EMA, just Envelopes + Stoch , even more good signal...

--- 帖子 #174 ---
can you please post the indicator?

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Maxximuz have you try your version of system on M1 TF? I am asking because we haven't M2 charts on MT4.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
all the indicators are available in this thread at Post 1, posted by Paulus. Even the rules are the same, but there are 2 versions: Pic 1, use exactly the same template posted by Paulus. Pic 2, I just remove the EMA, and solely based on Envelopes + Stoch, As for range bar setup, am using a paid licensed copy, which I can't post it up. Hope you understand. Do a google search, I think you shd be able to find a free version range bar indi/ea/scripts. Hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
For pic 1, if on M1, it is original Paulus system. For pic 2, I didn't try on M1 chart, but you can try to check it out. Look for candle that move outside the band and when it move inside the band again, check out Stoch to confirm the entry, wait till the candle close end enter at the next opening. P/S: To be frank, I am not trading this system at the moment, I am trading my own system at the moment, when I came across Paulus 1min Tricolor System, I just apply it on range bar chart and I find it very good so far.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
ok, I re-look on the chart (Pic 2) there are few more trades which I missed out. Some +ve and some -ve trades. But, no worry it is part of the game, furthermore the +ve trades are far bigger then the -ve trade. Profitable trading to all.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
okay, thanks! of course i understand this ;-)

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Retracment curious strategy,,, very interesting thanks

--- 帖子 #181 ---
http://www.box.com/shared/e3yikga4yzm0ljjjtirz Free version of Range bars for MT4

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Hy porfirio, i don't want to hijack this thread but could you please explain your Retracment curious strategy? Maybe in a new thread? THANKS! Mathias

--- 帖子 #183 ---
thank you!

--- 帖子 #184 ---
hi cyrus new thread? not necessary ema's 63 to 165 enelopes 8 everything exactly the same pdf v2 the only difference I see is always a gear higher tf before making a decision: m30 ... ma 63&gt; ma165 .......... oversold .... shape of the candle after go down tf looking envelopes retracment under the ema´s &lt;==&gt; ma63&gt;ma165 to be honest, I have not read the whole thread ... only pdf v2

--- 帖子 #185 ---
i downloaded the range bar indicator but it does not do anything when I try to plug it into the chart...am I missing something? I have it installed in the indicators folders, should it be a script instead?

--- 帖子 #186 ---
thanks for the explanation about your way of tuning Paulus system, porfirio! So you're trading this system on the M5-Chart with the confirmation of M30? Regards Mathias

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Read explanation. http://www.system-forex.info/2011/08...up-in-mt4.html The only problem with this indicator is it stop displaing new bars after few minutes. One have to delate script from chart and next add it again.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
here is two more that I found, I yet to try it, not sure is there any problem or not. copy to your /expert folder and drop it to M1 chart, then open offline chart accordingly.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
cyrus... forex for me is not an exact science for example I just made another entry ... m30-m1 (not M5) saludos

--- 帖子 #190 ---
cyrus..I'm testing the strategy for the first time ... obviously the first inning was more secure than the second because both TF is in the same direction in the latter case m1 goes against trend m30 ...see what happens

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Thank you! I will take a look on M30 in the future, it makes sense.. Saludos.. Mathias

--- 帖子 #192 ---
good strategy ... perfectly met retracment paulus have done a great job

--- 帖子 #193 ---
I have to say that it is my first experience with range bars. I set it to 5 pips range. I wonder where should i put SL level, on the last swing low/high or on extreme of previous bar. I have to check it. Looks interesting and easy to take 2 trades per day with 5% TP each.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
for me, my SL is always at the last swing high/low. And I will trail the order with the outer band.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
oooo, that is interesting. For o 2 weeks i try so hard to learn to move SL in a sequence: -5%, BE, 5%, 10%.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
The second one works very good.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Thank You

--- 帖子 #198 ---
How about trading today? Now i have opened two charts: 1. original Paulus 2. range bars I try to compare signals. I have to say that range bars are very interesting.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Where could I get range bars? Or its paid version available only?

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Are you joking? See previous page.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
When do you move SL from last swing to outer band?

--- 帖子 #202 ---
New day, new trade: I know that the entry was not 100% correct because the entry was already on the MA but i was confident because the trade was in the direction of the current trend - anyway, 20%. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Have a nice day guys, Mathias

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Wow. Bravo. I entered in the same time. TP-5%.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Piece of cake. TP 5%.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
I feel now like complete idiot, sorry )

--- 帖子 #206 ---
congrats truchtzero! @my trade I was a little bit lucky. The closest distance between the price and the 5%-SL was 0,2 pips.. Many good signals in this nice uptrend. Unfortunately I'm too busy today so I can't take every single signal but 20% for the day should be enough. @colombino He is talking about this post: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...76#post5305576 Mathias

--- 帖子 #207 ---
I think so.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Just a little nice trades

--- 帖子 #209 ---
sorry for the late reply. Once I hit 1x SL, I will move SL to BE, and start trailing SL few pips behind outer band. btw, I see you making pips, congrat!

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Hi all, Here is a trade I took today, one of my rules is to wait for the price to come back and touch the 165 ema (green ema) before considering a trade. After that I make sure that the 2 stochastics agree.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
THX for reply. Yes, i try to make few pips a day My daily goal is to make two trades 5% each. During last days i realized that it is possible. Some trades are closed to early because of my fear to loss money, as i written few pages earlier. But i am learning and trying so hard to become fully succesful.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
anybody trading today?

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Ive been having good success with version 2 all this week Its frustrating when trades return 0% only to see it run way but that down to price action and better to be safe then sorry We want the nice signals that run away slowly but surely I used 2 rules from Weds that served me well,yes it does remove some winning trades but it helps greatly taking signals against a trend before the MA's have changed Rule 1 If you look at the chart you will see 3 signals 1 loser at -5% 1 winners at +15% 1 winner at +5% On the 2nd signal we can see that the lower band is above our top ma this could well be saying ' this is going up up and away with a long bias now stop taking short signals EVEN if the ma's are in the right direction' The other 2 signal are perfect Rule 2 Place the stop 1 pip above or below your signal candle not the last swing hi or lo Looking back on allot of my past trades a large quantity of them the hi lo of the signal candle was respected P

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Thats why it is so hard to me to wait to 10% TP. PS Thanks Paulus for your new post in this thread. I thought you have forgotten about this system.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Hi truchtzero; You wait at close of the candle, for your entry ?. Thanks

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Yes, it is very important. 2x5% TP.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Wow. Anybody is still holding this long trade?

--- 帖子 #219 ---
hello all, I wish I had. Do you still use the range bars? it seems very interesting with Paulus new template and the new 2 rules. Thanks

--- 帖子 #220 ---
I have 4 charts on me screen. Paulus v2-e/u, g/u, u/ch and range bars -e/u. It seems to work perfectly for me.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
I hate to sound like a dumbass that can't use the search button, but when searching I found an enormous amount of information that was close but not quite what I wanted. How can you set the fib extension tool to the defaults that we use on this system? (the labels and levels 5%, 10%, etc.) I'm on IBFX MT4, everything I've done makes it reset each time. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Hi;

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Yes, I read that, but nowhere does it say how to SAVE the level settings. At least my MT4 doesn't keep the levels. Is it supposed to automatically?

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Wow - i took my profit at 10% (with 2.5% risk) - looks like i should have held on. I won't complain though - the power of v2 lies in the fact that when the trade is profitable - you have essentially got into the trade very close to the beginning of a new trend. The old adage is that you should be satisfied if you catch half of any move. It is much easier to catch half the move if you are into the trade near the beginning of the trend!

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Hi truchtzero thanks for the chart info, it is helping learn the system I was wonder how do the luktom Visual order Editor work, does it plots line of SL and TP once you input u SL and TP and you should be able to move those lines to change TP and SL thanks Desiboy

--- 帖子 #226 ---
luktom Visual order Editor You can adjust you SL and TP in this EA. Both lines are plotted on chart and what is most important you can move SL and TP levels with your mouse. So it is so easy to manage this levels. You can download EA from here: http://pl.luktom.biz/Page/46/luktom-visual-order-editor . It is free tool. My trades.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Thanks Paulus for sharing your 1Min Tricolor System. Looks like a good opportunity to enter was missed because the 63MA was below 165Ma, even though the StocH and Envelope satisfied the Ver 2 rules. Is my understanding of the rules correct, or could it have been a possible entry? EP

--- 帖子 #228 ---
hello frieds! i just wanna share my morning trade, the chart looks kind of strange but the trade was made of 1m tricolour. have a good one mates!!

--- 帖子 #229 ---
nice trade. congrats

--- 帖子 #230 ---
I have a deep respect for Paulus since over at the 123 thread... This will probably be my one and only post as this is not and will not be my main trading method and well quite frankly trading and working a full time job keep me pretty busy plus I spend time on another forum working with traders that trade my main method... However because of the history Paulus has of offering up some nice methods I decided to give this a shot on my live account. I don't really have a "scalping" method for trading the 1min TF. I loaded up all the indi's on the 1min Oil chart last night and low and behold around 9:30AM my time (right around NY market open) a nice set-up occured. Long story short rode it down trailing the SL and got taken out at 15%. Not bad for my first ever trade on this method. Way to go Paulus easy to understand and implement!

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Ok to prove to myself it wasn't a fluke I have taken another trade (a long on Oil earlier which gave me 5% after hitting 10%)... Here is trade 3 that I will take if the entry triggers. Good stuff here Paulus...

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Hello, Took thhis trade this morning only with stoch. Everything was fine, but only got 2 pips, because I had to leave.It was good for at least 10%. Very good entries with range bars and stoch.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
The trade triggered and hit 5% retraced and took me out at BE... not a fault of the system... bad time of day to take a new trade... Just test driving

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Hi pres78, Just looking at your entry there, and it is very similar to chart in my previous post above. To me it was not a valid entry because the 63Ma, was not above 165Ma as per the rules. Also with your later trades. So, I'm not sure if I understood the rules correctly, or did you decide to take the trade based only on the Stoch. Good work anyway! EP

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Both trades I posted charts for were shorts so the 63 was below the 165 per the V2 rules.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Hi there, Thanks to Paulus fos sharing this method which sounds amazing. I've DL the range bar and installed it into the script folder to compare results between it and candles. Either I do something wrong or it doesn't work, cause I only got the message below : Are you sur to apply the rangebar, blablabla, click on yes, and nothing happen. I also got like a problem with my Fib tool (see pic)..I'm not a mathematicien for sure..Either My SL or my Entry is not at the right place.. Thanks to all

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Sorry. Did not notice your entry on left side of the chart! EP

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Not entirely happy with the use of 5% risk with this system - as it may be teaching noobs bad habits. Then again if i used that level of risk i would have been up 15% last night rather than only 7 ;-)

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Can someone tell me where this 5 P/L indicator is located or what it is called. I see truchtzero recommending a click and move EA but I don't see an EA on anyone elses chart. I would like to have the indicator. Usually all the indicators from a system are in post 1 but I did not see it there and it doesn't appear when I use the template. A gentle shove in the right direction would be appreciated. I have become a believe in the % risk/reward instead of pip counts. Basically if you risk 2-3% of your account balance each trade you could trade for a very long time before blowing an account. I see this as a future key I will use for money management. Thx, ej5

--- 帖子 #240 ---
for that, just modify the Fibo Retracement tool as follow: 0 - SL 1 - EP 2 - 5% 3 - 10% 4 - 15% Pls refer to the V2 doc

--- 帖子 #241 ---
ej5, You seem to be describing the Fib Tool. Place it on the chart from the MT 4 Insert Menu, Fibonnacci, Retracement. Insert it by a click on the Entry point and then drag to SL ( 1 pip from Hi/Lo of Trigger candle). The properties must then be set by editing the Levels : SL=0, Entry=1, and TP levels 2,3,4,5,6. Adding %$ on the Description line will bring up the actual price for each level. EP

--- 帖子 #242 ---
hehe

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Thats all for today. THX

--- 帖子 #244 ---
By the way, to all readers, this position was not a by the rules one. Price should have been below the bottom MA as written in V2. Sorry about that.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Jesus, what a nice R/R !!!!!

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Welcome to Tricoulour world. If you are able to hold trade just to 1st TP (5%) that means you can make 156% return per month.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Yeah, you're right, but psychologically, I personnaly could not support to loose 15% of my account in 11 minutes.(Well, Not yet) No matter which big move after. I'm gonna do some demo and go for 1 or 2% per cent live.Already really better than nothing else in my opinion. Thanks for this great thread I'm gonna vouch for.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Thats OK. You need 2 trades with 2,5% TP1 per day.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
yeah, it's just amazing. I've tried it all day long, and tried to follow the rules... I've lost 2% but if I had taken my profit at TP1, it would have been a nice 3 winners..Waow I'm still wondering how we have to deal with the envelopes. Looks like for a long, the lower band has to be below the EMA's and the upper band above the EMA's in the PDF. (opposite for a short) Is that a rule ? Am I overtrading ? Thanks for your help !

--- 帖子 #250 ---
I have though about it many times and i decided to take TP1 (5%). But in some circumstances i close half on TP1 and watching what will be next. Sometimes second half is closed on 7-9% level, sometimes 1-3% level. So i need only one more winning trade than loosing per day to have profit.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
As Paulus said, you are right. But in my observation many times when both envelope lines cross long term MA it is still good oportunity to trade.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Hello fans of this great system, I try to use a slightly different MM: SL3pips, TP15pips RRR5 / 1, B +1 at 2 / 1 FIBO. Nice morning trade

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Another one, but I did not take this, because London closed.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
I've actually done almost the same.For today,10 trades and 100% winners with Sl:4pips+spread. Profit taken at the first level. You can always risk a little more if its not above or below the previous hi/lo... I wanted to check that settings for the previous days but my simulator hasn't enough data...

--- 帖子 #255 ---
I am attaching a chart of a simulated buy (Not a real signal) at the red line. I placed the fib tool on the chart at that point and then drug it down to what should be just below the previous swing low before the buy. The tool sets my entery point at 100. Is that correct? Then I just change that point in the editor to 0 or entry? The zero line becomes my SL line or is it the 61.8 line that becomes SL? The 161.8 and 261.8 become my TP1 and TP2? I apologize in that I have not used this tool before and could use some pointers. If followers don't want to discuss this here then I understand but would appreciate being pointed to a site or page that would better describe how to set this tool up. ej5

--- 帖子 #256 ---
I just took a long with the version 1 of the system, entry is at 1.3103 and stop at 1.3100, low risk of only 3 pips, let's see how it goes

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Just delete everything and add this level : 0/Sl 1/ Entry 2/ 5% 3/10% 4/ 15% or whatever you want. I advise you to start with less than 5%. Just a thought. Mickael

Still looking good on EURUSD.

I see on few posted charts that some of us stoch is adjusted to HIGH/LOW. It should be CLOSE/CLOSE. It is ranging market today. It is hard to earn some money.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Hi truchtzero You seem to know the parameters of this strategy. Can you tell me the parameters of the envelops? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Thanks a lot ! Actually, that was my case... It even better now.(2 winners and one really dangerous loosing trade cause of the MA's)

--- 帖子 #263 ---

2 good trades for the morning

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Are you sure that they were by the rules ?

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Is there someone trading this method live to know which broker is the best for scalping. Thanks !

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Here is my custom indicator. Hope you guys can find it useful. It will trigger alarm/email when fast ema is above slow ema and price is below slow ema (opposite for sell). It does not put envelope and stoch into consideration, just a simple signal for you guys to be ready for action.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
@MFX Thanks for the additional info on the tool. I got it working now. ej5

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Great system, gonna try it this week, will let you know my results.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Lets start new week.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Hey Trucht, Seems like you've been trading this system for a while now; it's my first live trading week with this system... It seems that you wait for the signal bar to close, is that recommended? How has the system been for you so far? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
careful lads. the tri clour stoch indi does repaint. a lot of fake signals.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
The colour of the stoch doesn't actually come into play on this system i don't think, just the crossing of the 80 and 20 line.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
You are wrong, it doesnt repaint. But if you are sure it does it would be best to show some screenshots. We are waiting.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
...nearing b/e stop. Edit: stopped b/e. I like Paulus' v2.

Hello. Thank you Paulus for sharing this great system. I´ve been testing it only EUR/USD and USD/CHF. Not bad at all....... Trades: 10 Total (2% risk): +2%, +2%, BE, -2%, +2%, +4%, +2%, BE, +10%, BE: + 22% Total (5% risk): +5%, +5%, BE, -5%, +5%, +10%, +5%, BE, +25%, BE: + 50%

--- 帖子 #292 ---
and the other 3 trades.....

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Thanks for sharing your success with us Caillou! This looks great!! Keep it up!

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Thank you but early days, anyway with such R:R, this could be a really profitable system.......

--- 帖子 #295 ---
How many days is that backtest and London Session?

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Hi, As I said 10 trades today, I´ve been testing just today, from 8h00 till 18h00 (Frankfurt time).

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Thanks for sharing your results. Be careful at the 1,3,4,5,10th trades cause they are not really by the rules (look at the envelopes). They could have signified a reversal. And also be careful to choose a broker with a really low spread and commission...

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Thank you for your interest but could you explain what is the problem with envelopes? Lower Band below 165 MA for buys and Higher Band above 165 MA for sells.......... And yes, we need a broker with low spread (less than 1 pip for EUR/USD), low commission, a good IB and really quick execution.......

--- 帖子 #299 ---
I was not focused on the envelopes at the beginning but had some loosers who helped me identifying it. Look at the envelope on pdf and on my attached file, you'll see. The lower is above the EMA's

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Thank you, I´m trading following just Paulus rules: "Higher band above 165ma.. can be both bands "

--- 帖子 #301 ---
You're RIGHT, sorry ! A good point that you've posted your chart today.I'm gonna have a look to this method again.. I just got a question? Both bands can be higher or lower than ema's, that's the rule.So what is the point in having envelopes ? Price is enought, no ?

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Refer to Page 15, Post 214, 2 new rules for v2 from Paulus, Rule 1 If you look at the chart you will see 3 signals 1 loser at -5% 1 winners at +15% 1 winner at +5% On the 2nd signal we can see that the lower band is above our top ma this could well be saying ' this is going up up and away with a long bias now stop taking short signals EVEN if the ma's are in the right direction' The other 2 signal are perfect Rule 2 Place the stop 1 pip above or below your signal candle not the last swing hi or lo Looking back on allot of my past trades a large quantity of them the hi lo of the signal candle was respected

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Yes, maybe envelopes are more visual for the pullback but, it´s better to wait for Paulus´s answer.......

--- 帖子 #304 ---
.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Thank you. So MickaelFX, you are right, the first new rule will be added for my new trades and the second rule too........

--- 帖子 #306 ---
i think we should make a statistics about two cases: 1. only one envelope line above MA's 2. both envelope lines above MA's. Results could be interesting.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Massive trades on EURUSD today. Over 100 pips

--- 帖子 #308 ---
You are right, let´s take on demo all trades with case 2 and see the results.....

--- 帖子 #309 ---
I was almost sure that I read it somewhere

--- 帖子 #310 ---
I've opened a new demo account and registered it on myfxbook. I'll take each trade with only one envelope above MA. I'll let you know the results at the end of february.it would be great that someone else test the method when both envelopes lines are above or below EMA during the same month (february). SL will always be 6 pips,cause its going so fast that I just cant calculate 5% each trade.So 6pips 5%.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
hi guys! is this a good trade?

--- 帖子 #312 ---
What will happen?

--- 帖子 #313 ---
I think it could be reversal on EU and UCh (see charts). So i close GU trade.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Good morning, EUR/USD set up was at 9h08 (Frankfurt time), 8 min after London open, I never trade 15 min before and after a Session opens........ And if we follow new rule nº 1, there is no trade.... Anyway since EUR/USD and USD/CHF are negative correlated (-86.1 daily, -98.8 hourly) it could be a good filter to take the trade in one pair only if stoch has crossed 80/20 level on the other pair. Yesterday, EUR/USD winner at 14h48 and USD/CHF with stoch ok. Today, EUR/USD loser at 10h08 and USD/CHF with stock no ok. I will test it today..........

Yes, the main problem is that usually you have 2 trades at the same time (a really strong signal for now) and you have to be extremelly fast......

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Total: + 22% (risk 2%) Total: + 55% (risk 5%) [/i][/quote] Are these today's totals from Frankfurt open?

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Hello Paulus : Just wanted to thank you again for all your efforts here , I have been trading this method alongside your 5min keltner method , and find them to be a good package . The tricolor catches the trends and the 5keltner catches the retracements , Wonderful...I believe my search for a solid scalping plan is over .. Thanks Much ........

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Are these today's totals from Frankfurt open?[/quote] Yes, just 6 trades, I start at Frankfurt open but today no trades untill US session, we need strong pullbacks.......

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Although, with the ROC we're seeing it's not imperative to trade more than one signal at a time!

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Totally agree, because of spread, better to trade just EUR/USD and have a look at USD/CHF for confirming......

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Easy money. I fill a bit scared trading today. Dont know why.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Agreed. Good plan.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Hey guys, I have been lurking on this system since the beginning. I was wondering how you calculate lot size quickly to determine how to risk a set %. Do you use a spreadsheet or is there an order placing script that will calculate it for you? Also, I am in the USA, so I have a cap at 1:50 for leverage. I don't think I will be able to risk a full 5% on a trade that is as small as 8 pips SL. Is that right, or is my math off?

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Are you from USA? What a pitty. In europe we have 1:400 levarage. To manage lot size try this. Paulus has posted it someday.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Perfect, exactly what I was looking for, thank you.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Just a question: do we wait till the CLOSE of the candle which makes the stoch. change from above to below 80 ? Or we entry in the exact tick that makes it happened? thanks

--- 帖子 #331 ---
You've got to wait for the close, otherwise it could change. This is probably why some guy on here accused the stoch indicator of "repainting".

--- 帖子 #332 ---
I was wondering about this myself cmac, how to 1:50 would affect the risk/reward side - I'll have to test this out.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
At the most it appears I can risk 2% per trade.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Good morning, My first live trade today, EUR/USD, all rules and stoch USD/CHF ok, +0.3% (risk 0.1%)...... - + 6% (risk 2%) - + 15% (risk 5%) Cheers

Hi rohule I'd like to ask you whether it is possible to attach your stoch indicator. Many thanks!

--- 帖子 #343 ---
hi! its not a custom indi, is just a lot of stoch in one window, from 6 to 11 is green, the 12 period is white and from 13 to 22 is red (the other value is 3 3) but if u need the tmp here you go have a good one guys!!

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Hi Guys This week I compared my exit on the 1min with an exit on the 5min I read somewhere quite a time ago that entry on 1 time frame with exit on a longer time frame can pay off as the noise that normally takes you out is smoothed and filtered by the longer time period So if you prefer take an exit on the 5min using the envelopes that are on your 1min chart see the 2 charts below for explanation 1min exit plus 10% 5min exit plus 15%

4 consecutive losses. 20% drawndown on my account

--- 帖子 #354 ---
5% risk a trade may be a bit high. Are you sure they are all valid trades?

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Hi All, this is the 1st I comment in this thread. I've been following this system, trying on real trade and testing back test since middle of Jan. I have to express my thanks and gratitude to Paulus on sharing this system and to Sangmane on sharing his Easy Order script. It really helps my a lot in executing and managing the order. this system works most of the time (around 60:40) if I skipped asian to London session. But when I back test sometimes I encounter losses in a rows. The maximal losses in 9 times in a row, therefore in my opinion 5% of capital bet is too high. I will lose my confident to keep trading on this system if I use that percentage. Good trade to all of you.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
I am trading this system on my real account for 2 weeks. My conclusion is that's impossible to trade this method if you have more than 2pips-spread. I have a 3pip spread, so, if I put my SL 1 pip above/below the Hi/low of recent candle ( which is normally different 2-4 pips from the current price ) I'll need a 12 -18 pips move to get my TP. Normally the price moves 6-8 pips in your direction and after that you get stopped. Big moves like this almost never happen and I get stopped many many times... Even with 1:2 RR this can't be profitable. Was a nice experience but I'll not use this system anymore.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Please post your chart..Thank You

--- 帖子 #358 ---
The stoploss is always 3 pips above. I just put this way to simulate the target. with 1:2 RR.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Thanks , I was also losing trades on 1 min. But am having better results on a longer time frame ,

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Hey, Are you sure that your first Tp is not too far ?? The distance between SL and entry should me the same than entry TP1. I've found a similar trade than yours and it had been a BE, not a loss. Let me know

--- 帖子 #361 ---
I made an EA for this strategy and backtested results (1 year) show that it is a loosing system.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
My SL should be 1 pip below the low of the recent candle. Distance between the entry point and the low of a recent candle is 3 pips. 1:2 RR RISK = (3 + 1)SL + (3)SPREAD : REWARD = (14)TP

--- 帖子 #363 ---
I didn't want to say that your R/R is not right.I just said that the First TP is too far. It's not my opinion, but the rules. on fib, 0=Entry,1=TP1, 2=TP2...TP1 is not equal at RR2.Tp 2 is. When the first TP is reach then you move to BE.(not tp2) On my screenshot the same trade had been a BE one.But I personally think that Spread =3 is too much for such strategy. Green pips to you

--- 帖子 #364 ---
I have been trading this system for about 3 weeks live on a penny account and my M1 EU trades with a 1-2 pip spread are making consistent money. My trades on other currencies with 3-4 pip spreads are really struggling to keep their heads above water. I seem to have to work twice as hard at keeping those trades profitable. The SL are too far back so even though I set them to my chart to my brokers spreads, I will close them out manualy when my real fib tool SL is hit. If I let them go to the real spread SL they would have sank completely by now. In order to trade the higher spread (&gt;2pips) I am looking at trading them on this system now with the M5 and M15 looking for more solid moves. We'll see how this goes. So far I am pleased with the method. -ej5

--- 帖子 #365 ---
You're right, In my opinion the spread is the clue too. Not obvious to manage the trade with spread and to respecte the rules in the same time with 3pips spread. Would you please share your settings on higher timeframe.? Thanks

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Thanks for posting the screenshots. The first trade should have been moved to BE as soon as 1R was reached in my view. You could have filtered out the 3rd and 4th trades by entering the trades at 1 pip beyond the break of the entry candle. I am not suggesting that we optimise the entry necessarily - but entering on the break of the 'entry' candle is a pretty standard variation on the current method of entry.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Did you only trade the London in your testing? I quit trading this each day after 2 or three losses - and dont trade any longer after i have made 1.5-2R+. I have found using this form of trade management keeps the system profitable for me.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
@MickFX At this point I have just started the higher time frames and had planned on using the same settings I have for the M1 and see how it goes unless there is an obvious bad reason for doing so that I have missed. The other thing I want to add is that I dog the trades once they are on. AS soon as trade crosses TP1 I set BE+1, as soon as trade passes TP2 I set stop to TP1. TP3 seems to be a stretch at this time frame so I start whatching the candles for signs of exhaustion and/or stochastics reaching the extreme again and turning against me. I basically try and milk each trade but I don't let a winner ever become a loser. I haven't ever met a positive pip trade I don't like and with this system there are lots of opportunities to jump on board and find the next wave that goes farther than you expected so there is no need to get greedy. -ej5

--- 帖子 #369 ---
You didn't wait for the candles to close with the stoch closing in the gray before you entered, that produced 2 negative trades. On the first one, you should wait till it's trending, don't jump in when the MA's are flipping back and forth.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
If you look only to color you could be mislead. Someone complain before that the indicator repaints. If you consider color it does repaint. It you consider values (thats what matters. right?) it doesn't changes/repaints. Consider the following Stoch alone bellow 20. (Above 80 its the same logic) whenever the Stoch drop bellow 20 on candle close the last line segment becomes red. If the value goes up 20, the last line segment will be gray. But if the next value goes again bellow 20, we'll get another last red segment. (an inverted V with the edge above 20). So color has nothing to do with Joao's entries. I believe he followed the "rules" and at entry time the line was GRAY. When we look back and see a good setup with obviously a gray line going up it was kind of "luck". this time it went up!! It worked!! Whenever Stoch crosses bellow 80 or above 20 and the other indies line up, you have a trigger. It doesn't mean it will work every time. But in this timeframe you can't wait to much. You either pull the trigger or you back off. A lot of discretion is still needed. Like every other system out there if one follow rules blindly it will loose in the end. Ignore color and pay attention to numbers and what is happening in higher tf. Hope it helps. J

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Completely agree

good morning trade

Hey, Paulus, am I wrong or there was not that much signals for a 1 min scalping strategy this week?? Is the market changing ?? Thanks for your help !

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Hello Rohule, may I ask what indicator you use at the bottom of your chart (showing daily, 4h and 1h candle stick time frame) ? Good trading to you

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Hey bro how r u? Here you go http://www.pipware.com/software/mini-charts.html

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Hi Rohule, thanks for the links. Looking forward to attach it since I think I have to analyze the higher timeframe before making decision whether to enter position or not. Regards

--- 帖子 #377 ---
I've been looking at this strategy with great interest - and also some small degree of amazement at some of the deals which have been posted up here!! There have been many examples of deals which don't follow the rules. The most common ones are when [using a short deal for my example] the lower band is above the 165ema and also when the trigger candle isn't FULLY ABOVE the 165ema. If either of the conditions above are true, there is NO TRADE!! However, I have a question for Paulus: On the attached chart from today, there are several stochastic crosses which are invalidated by the trigger candle breaching the 165ema. However, we then get a stoch cross on a candle which DOESN'T breach the 165ema, so would that be a valid trade?

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Actually, I take some of the above comments back!! In one of Paulus's examples, he takes a deal when price HAS breached the 165ema, BUT it still closed on the "correct" side of it it. Paulus - I would appreciate your clarification here please!

--- 帖子 #379 ---

--- 帖子 #289 ---
what i use to enter the trade is the white one (the middle one), when the stoch is getting fat its my heads up for a trade, that means that the trend is running out of fuel, and for entry i need to see the stoch thiner, the thiner the better and better if its going from ob or os. the green is short term and the red is long term. hope that helps

am i missing something here? am i correct that this system ultimately relies on the concept of over bought and over sold. what is over bought/sold? 50 pips, 100 pips, 1000 pips, what? what is the maximum time/pips the price can remain over bought/sold? someone said earlier in this thread they back tested and got 9 losses in a row. i concur with my testing. demo account blown. AUDUSD remained over bought until my account blown. i gave up on the other pairs i was testing as they also looked to remain over something for a long time.

its not just a case of OB OS there are other things to consider.. This is just sticking to tried and testing principles Identify a trend take a trade on a pull back or rally Guys that use Fibonacci use a number to indicate a rally or pul back has moved enough I use stoch.. Yes of course in a strong trend a stoch will stay OB but the oter rules protect you from this For a long we need ma in correct order Long term stoch green indicating longer term pull back Short term stoch green indicating 1min pull back These must be green at the same time. The price must pull back into the space between the blue and green area We eneter on Tick up of fast stoch with green candle For a short we need ma in correct order Long term stoch red indicating longer term rally Short term stoch red indicating 1min rally These must be red at the same time. The price must rally into the space between the blue and green area We eneter on Tick down of fast stoch with red candle The method did adapt and like all threads here on FF Im not a guru or a prophet things are posted to help people ..take what you want from it adapt it change it .....

I'm thinking about taking a short soon, Stoch 15 is overbought, the 3 MAs are in correct order, stoch 30 isn't overbought yet though. Attached Image (click to enlarge) __________________ Forex - Who knows what the tide could bring ?

One of my trades I took yesterday on GU M5 chart. I'm currently testing M5 charts as I might get more space for movement ie SL and TP. What I would also like to suggest is that if a trade goes against you and you followed the rules to the tee, do not enter another trade within the next hour or two. This has helped me recover yesterday as well. I would have had 3 losses in a row, but because I stopped after the first loss I made it up on my second trade 2 hours later. Just a thought...

My last trade for the day on GU M5. Not 100% as per rules, because MA's are mixed, but I had a good feeling about this one. Banked only 30 pips, but there were 120 pips in that trade...
