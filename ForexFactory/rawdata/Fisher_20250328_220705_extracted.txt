This thread has moved to Journals Forum http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=1#post3121170 (NOTE: This is a work in progress. Will post updates as we go. Indies and templates can be found by clicking on the "paper clip" upper right hand corner of the page) Fisher : A high probability trading strategy. The Fisher indicator at the bottom of the chart gives the entry signals . Enter when the indicator crosses the 0 line . Wait for the 2nd bar to confirm the new direction. I'm using 55, default setting is 10. Exiting is based on several considerations, pivot points, the 200ema, trend lines. Initial stop loss is set to around 20 pips, sometimes more sometimes less, again this also depends on other conditions, pivot points, etc... This is a high probability trading strategy. Which means the likelihood of successes out-ways that of losses, as such it is acceptable to sometimes have take a higher risk for the stop than for the limit. An occasional loss can be easily offset by the number of many more successes. Sometimes a large stop is necessary to prevent getting stopped out too early. I always test a new strategy on a demo. Anything else is just throwing money away. I do not guarantee results with this strategy. I am in the process of testing it and welcome insights and suggestions for improvements from the forum traders. An ea would at some point would be fantastic, as it seems like it would lend itself to one fairly easily. I don't know how to code so I don't know for sure how difficult it would be to code it. A snapshot of my template is attached. (I like blue. It helps to keep me a little cooler.) The two charts are the 5m and 15 m. Signals are taken on the 5m, with reference to the 15m helpful for setting stops and limits, identifying trends and support and resistnaces and confirming the strength of the trend on the 5m. A sound alert for the Fisher indi for a cross of the zero line would be first class. One than can be turned off also. Thanks in advance to anyone willing to put it together.... Many pips to you and yours..... Best wishes and all success. jiva34

here's a trade on demo. Fisher seems to have a leading indication... gets into trade before the ema's cross...

Hi Lucing nice, wots you back test resalt? Zuma

--- 帖子 #6 ---
I know. It's looking too good to be true. No back tests. Am only testing on demo during live sessions... taking my breath away so far.... let's make some money, yeehaw...

--- 帖子 #7 ---
checked for a fisher signal on the 15. switched from the 5 min chart to the 15 and moved the limit up

--- 帖子 #8 ---
a retracing, is it a failed attempt at upside? From the looks of the long downside wick on the earlier candle it seems to indicate that upside is stronger at this point... never know for sure.... a rebound to the 200ema is reasonable... that's why I want to open 2 positions for a trade. I could close one early on before any retracing and the risk of reversal and let the other position ride...

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Did you get some bad trades on the 5 min or just want to demo the 15 min now? Brian

--- 帖子 #10 ---
The original trade was on a signal from the 5 m. After it was moveing nicely I checked the 15 minute and saw a Fisher buy signal there too, so I upped the limit and changed from a trade on the 5 m to a trade on the 15 m thinking to try to capture a bigger move. Now I am thinking I should have also checked the 1 minute... that may be how to know when to close the first position, when fisher on the 1m dips below the 0 line. fisher 5 m still positive, 15m still positive. This is what the 1 m looks like

--- 帖子 #11 ---
looks like short term trend in tact...

--- 帖子 #12 ---
testing the 200 ema on the 5m

--- 帖子 #13 ---
hi,it seems a very accurate indi by visual backtesting,my Q: does fisher repaint?,the ema's are 13,25 and 200 to close,right?

--- 帖子 #14 ---
it was a winner, still more to run, but reached the limit on the 15 min

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Loser strategy

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Isn't the reason that Fisher appears to be such an attractive indicator is because it repaints the bars? I may be wrong cause it's been years since I looked at it.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
I have been testing this one for a while now and I have not seen it repaint. Only thing is the bar must close for it to be a signal. While the bar is open it can show a signal and then just before it closes reverse so no signal. That's why I wait until opening of the second bar. Have not seen it repaint once it closes.... Once it closes it's closed...

--- 帖子 #18 ---
ah I searched now... the one that repainted was called FX_Fish.mq4 - it was like the Holy Grail of Indicators lol... at least if you looked at historical data.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
You are right, it repaints. See attached image, I did an EA and backtested for a while and in real time it gets lots of false signals. Check out this thread too http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=16602 , it pretty old. I think it's useless in real trading or at least as bad as other indicators.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
is it the same indicator as where posted others say there are different fisher indicators ?? best regards and also he seems to take trades in real time and it works so far if it repaints you just cant make the backtest. best regards

--- 帖子 #21 ---
It is the indy from this thread. Why can't I make a backtest? Don't you see the image I attached? It is a backtest. Good luck anyway.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
if a indicator repaints you cant make a backtest because you would not get the accourate info because the indicator have repainted. but it can still be used in realtime if it is good best regards

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Are you a programmer? I am. I just backtested it. No more comments.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Will continue to test the fisher indi, I have not had a problem with repaint. If there is repaint it hasn't shown to be significant. If it can produce winning trades like the one outlined in the earlier posts then I will use it. Paint repaint whatever. So far so good.... Thanks for the feedback.....And I will certainly be alert for repaint problems.. jiva34

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Maybe if you reload it once in a while just to get the refreshed value to check if the signal is valid. I am not sure why in realtime (when you let it running for some time) it shows those two color histograms and once you reload it it gets repainted and shows only good signals...

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Yes I've noticed that too. And I do reload it often. Especially if I am considering entering a trade. I doesn't seem like it's the bar length or direction so much as it doesn't fill in the color all the way... Will be watching this more carefully...I'm thinking that once it is reloaded those bars that are reloaded do not get the discoloration again only new bars may get it.... I'm thinking it is more of a discoloration rather than a repainting... jiva34

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Well, when I think about it, it is not exactly "repainting". Repainting indicators show signal and after a couple of bars the indicator repaints itself and the signal is not at that place anymore (if you took the trade, then you're in...). But this one does not repaint. Only if you reload it, it looks a bit different. It would be great if reloading (or just changing timeframe from M15 to M15 and back) would solve this problem.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
What I've been doing is right click on the chart, left click on indicators in the pop up menu. Then click fisher. hit edit and then exit. That brings it up to speed. May get another chance to test this thing in a few minutes. 8:30 data coming our for US. Most of he pairs are sitting there like in limbo right now. Am looking for signal on 5m. I also use pivots. Not on the chart because the indi for pivots I have is "ugly" and won't let me alter the colors. I've tried. Some day I may go into meta and change the colors there. Pivots are like magnets. The pa gravitates to and from them like anything.... Strong support and resistance points.... am attaching the "ugly" pivot indi... and a candle timer... find it useful ro know how long is left till candle closes. jiva34

--- 帖子 #29 ---
testing fisher again. may have got in a little early, data comes in 10 mins, don't usually enter a trade before data. Especially US data like housing and unemployment... But fisher gave a signal... on the 5m. There is that huge wick and the yellow line is the pivot point. On the 30m, this is the top of the range... so it would take a lot for pa to go higher from here even though fisher is positive on the 30m. 2 mins to data..............

--- 帖子 #30 ---
no surprises futures slightly up for open higher in US markets, means USD weakens in trading pa hung at key levels of support and resistance, most notably the pivot point (yellow line).

--- 帖子 #31 ---
testing the 200 ema and the pivot point, fisher is negative....

--- 帖子 #32 ---
What is your TP/SL on 5M? Do you use the indi on 1M chart too?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
initial stop loss is how much I am willing to lose if trade is bad. I take into consideration support levels and pivots, etc ... just the other side of a major support or resistance is always a good place. But far enough away so the pa doesn't spike just to catch my 2 cents... take profit is also dictated by support levels, pivots, trend lines, the 200ema... What I want to get good at is scaling out. Opening more than one position. Closing one after a run and moving the stop loss to break even, then follow the remaining position(s) with a trailing stop. best wishes jiva34

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Thanks for the answer! I will try this indi on demo next week.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
The current test of fisher signals as a strategy for entry is in progress. Fisher long on the 1m, but 5m fisher still short... consolidating for the next move, I have short... we'll probably see significant movement when US market opens 20 mins or so. Probably nap time till then... this could be a bad trade, but I can learn from bad trades even it's only what not to do... if it's a demo I'm spared the pain... spoke too soon, trade was stopped out... maybe the stop loss was too low, or I should have paid more attention to the new fisher long signal on the 30m. Will watch the pa for a while. Try to learn something..... jiva34

--- 帖子 #36 ---
stopped on usdchf, but I think the problem was the stop wasn't far enough away. So back in... after p/a did a little consolidating.... am trading the 5 min with fisher short signal, but will keep an eye on the 15 min to see if a fisher short signal appears there, if so will adjust the tp and trade on the 15 m.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
fisher short signal appeared on 15 min so have adjusted limit for more tp to just above a support line... and will follow pa on the 15m rather than just the 5m and of course be looking to the 30m to see if a fisher short signal shows up... the problem initially was too tight of a stop...

--- 帖子 #38 ---
the start of a fisher sell signal is appearing. But it is necessary to wait for the candle to close and only enter on the open of the next candle. 7 mins till candle end on the 30m.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
closed trade near bottom of the range, even if it does break down furtner there is sure to be significant stalling and consolidating first. Anyway no need to be greedy. I am happy just to be able follow what is happening in the pa and make some good decisions....

--- 帖子 #40 ---
pa continued all the way to the support... a whole 'nother big bear candle... There were favorable short signals on all the time frames, from 1m all the way to the day chart. So what was my problem? Why close early? should have at least waited for a signal on the 1m that there was some retracing about to occur. Dumb. Still a nice trade all things considered. Learned a lot: Don't put stop too close, and check the 1 m before exiting... Now the start of a bear signal is on the weekly. Could be a continuation and really big move down. But it is very important to wait for the signal candle to close and only consider entering at the open of the 2nd candle. So a weekly signal candle means next Monday to trade that time frame. I don't have the patience right now. The more action there is like on the lower time frames the more opportunities I have to learn. best wishes jiva34

--- 帖子 #41 ---
This was pointed out in earlier posts. And yes it does repaint. At first I didn't realize this because most of the signals are fine. The cross of the 0 line is really the only signal I consider and for the most part this is right on. Nothing is going to be perfect all the time, except death Life (on this planet in this atmosphere) is full of imperfections. Like it's an ocean of faults!!!! The usefulness of the fisher indi is far outweighing the repainting issue. best wishes jiva34

--- 帖子 #42 ---
new trade. fisher short signal 2nd bar 5 m. no data releases till 4am est pa dropping just below pivot, yellow line.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
looks good

--- 帖子 #44 ---
good trade about 3 minutes all totaled there was a little repainting but by waiting until the 2nd bar after a signal bar closes it minimizes getting a completely wrong signal... also I am appreciating the benefit of trading only during peak times. 3 minutes....... in and out... am concentrating on getting the entries right. there is a lot more downside to this move in eurusd, but for now let me get the direction and entries right. when that is under control :&gt;)... I want to develop the scaling out strategy for exits by opening more than one position initially, dropping one position early on and letting the rest move protected by trailing stops. for now let me get the fisher entries up and running... hey, $100 in 3 mins is fine... I could do that all day.............................sure could!

--- 帖子 #45 ---
A sound alert for the Fisher indi for a cross of the zero line would be first class. One than can be turned off also. Thanks in advance to anyone willing to put it together.... Many pips to you and yours..... jiva34

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Well done Jiva..i like your style..keep it up.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
okay Fisher is giving the short signal on the 1 hour chart, 2nd bar after cross of zero... pa has broken below support, s1 pivot, looks like lower opens for US equities today and for the next little while... USD strength.. Asian markets weakening little bit could be a significant downside move so let's test Fisher on a higher time frame. Demo means no pain if I'm wrong.... phew...

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Probably boring the forum to tears with all these posts, but it's helping me to stay on track as I try to make this strategy my own. Maybe my notes on mistakes and why as well as successes and why can help someone else. As neophyte as I am there is always someone else more neophyte. Best wishes.. jiva34

--- 帖子 #49 ---
okay the pa is retracing on the 1 m towards the 200ema. Don't want to have the stop loss too close an then get stopped out unnecessarily, if I still believe in the trade.... (short signal on the 1hr) as nerve racking as it could get with drawdown... movining the stop to just above the 200 ema and keeping an eye on the 1 min, looking for resistance at that 200 ema and new 1 m Fisher short signal.....

--- 帖子 #50 ---
I think you are getting in on a late signal there Jiva because when i check my one hour chart the original signal was 8 hours ago but we will see.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
here's what happened on 1m... Fisher did not show a long signal at all, and downtrend resumed.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
I'm using 55 for Fisher... 55 seems to screen out some of the static. I have to wait longer for a signal but they are stronger signals.... 10 is the defaults setting...

--- 帖子 #53 ---
pa sitting on the 200ema, tempted to close. But hey wait this is a demo let me tough it out..... 1 hr is still short signal.....

--- 帖子 #54 ---
I did some research If you look at the code you will see that it re-paints past bars on every new tick. PHP Code: for( int i = 0 ; i &lt; limit ; i ++) The above code statement allows it to re-paint all previous bars. The Loop starts at the current unfinished bar and loops though all history and re-paints them. That’s way when you place it on a chart it looks amazingly accurate not only on the trend direction but the tops and bottoms. To get a more accurate picture of what this indicator can do for you, you should change the for statement in the code to this PHP Code: for( int i = 500 ; i &gt; 0 ; i --) I have not watched this indicator realtime so I cant comment on how well it shows information for the realtime current bar. If you would like to dicuss this please respond Thanks EK http://www.forex-tsd.com/metatrader-4/474-fisher-3.html after I changed the code i see nothing special about it

--- 帖子 #55 ---
my laptop decided to freeze, time out, stop the world... moved stop to next support s3 pa plowed right through s2... keeping and eye on the repaint thing.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Thanks..55 also help you to stay with the trend. will look at this much closer..thanks again .

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Thanks for the time and effort. So far even though Fisher repaints it has given 4 straight wins... I've set it to 55 instead of the default 10 and that seems to screen out some of the jitters.... It has been very useful so far.... will check out the changes in code you have suggested later when the market takes a nap... if you know how to code wouldyou be inclined to set up a sound alert for a cross of the zero line, one with on off function Thanks again for feedback.... jiva34

--- 帖子 #58 ---
retracing on 1m still shows Fisher short signal.. checking out 4h chart to see if the strength of the down move is showing up there... not yet... bar on 4h is snug with zero...

--- 帖子 #59 ---
lot of support here on 30 min chart The strength of the down move is based on the 1 hour Fisher short signal which is still intact.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Okay, that's why lower time frames are better for me. Find signals on the 5 min and if the signal also confirms on the 15m after I'm in the trade great. But like this experiment with the 1h signal showed me. (It's probably a good signal.) But the down move was dramatic, $250 profit in about 5 mins. now it's -$30 retracing... half hour later... Still in the trade it may end up a loss. So what did I learn? Why I like the 5m chart for trading. Catch the dramatic moves and get in and out. Longer in the market with a winning trade the greater the risk the trade can become a loser. If the higher time frames show confirmation of the strength of the signal on a 5 min all the better. But the 1h chart is not where I want to trade. This chart shows why.. I'm cured. No temptation to trade 1hr, or even 30 m. Maybe 15m if I watch it closely for strength of retracements on the 1m. Need to stay on track. Actually I'm not at the point of refining exits. I'm just working on recognizing good entries using Fisher. So far so good. 5 good entries in a row. When I get to the point of refining the exit I want to using scaling out. So a trade like this would be a perfect candidate for scaling out. I would have closed one position at the $250 profit level and moved the stop to break even for the remaining position. (Open 2 lots initially). So let me look at this trade like that. . It would have stopped out the remaining position. And I would be out of the market. Winning trade on one position. breakeven on the other. the possibility was to catch further downside with the remaining position while having no risk. Even so, with the kind of signal Fisher is giving. Trading the swings rather than sitting out a retracement would be better. Might give up the idea of scaling exits and just go with 5m Fisher signals. Quick. In and out. No waiting around..... So I'm getting cured from the temptations to sit in a trade on higher time frames. Hi probablity of success trading. As opposed to low probability of success and high profit. Both are valid. Learn from failures... They are the pillars of success. best wishes jiva34

--- 帖子 #61 ---
this was a winning trade $250 on 5 min tried to trade it on the 1h, and probably still is a good trade on 1h, but I don't like to ride the retracements out.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Fisher's lying, I watched how it works in real time and can say this yesterday, it showed a signal to sell GBPUSD (after the opening of the candle light showed the second white bar) but after I turned off the Computer and soon turned his re-light show for three white bar. That such zagagulina! En Zuma

--- 帖子 #63 ---
there is some repainting. But I am having very good results with Fisher set at 55, the default is 10 and there is a lot of static on 10 setting. I always wait for the 2nd bar after a cross of the 0 line to minimize any repainting. Even with some repainting I am finding this indi very useful. You not gonna find the perfect!! But if it can be useful, what is the harm? Lots of things have to be considered before placing a trade. Resistance and support, pivots, ma's, trend lines, news reports, check higher and lower time frames to where strengths and weaknesses may lie, etc... Not the least of which is risk to reward ratio. Fisher only points to a possible trade. So far Fisher has pointed to 5 out of 5 in demo testing..... Not bad.... Repaint ,reeeshmaint... best wishes and more pips to you jiva34

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Have added cci set to 20 to help identify entry in a trend already under way. Since it may not be possible to catch a trend in the very beginning. Idea is: When Fisher remains above 0, look for a cross of cci above zero as a reentry point. Wait until the bar closes and enter on the 2nd bar if cci remains above 0 and Fisher remains above zero. In an uptrend characterized by Fisher remaining above zero if the the cci dips below zero and then comes back above zero without Fisher ever going below, then pa action has completely a minor retracement and is getting ready for further upside. Reverse would be true for short... That's the idea anyway. That is the set up for this chart 5m. stop is set just below pivot point (yellow line) limit is at r1 (not shown on chart) Might have gotten in a bit late, but went for it anyway. It's demo for goodness sake. I can learn from it even it doesn't work. We shall see.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
wants to go higher. trading above pivot (yellow line) but there is a lot of resistance as this is level which is now level with a recent high further back not shown on chart... this is not so much a test of Fisher signals as it a test of cci and Fisher working together. the initial signal a while back by Fisher to go long and now cci to give the reentry signal after a shallow pullback and consolidation..

--- 帖子 #66 ---
pa has broken below the 200ema on the 1 m and is heading for a retest of the pivot point. Us equity mkt is weakening after a modestly higher open. the eur tends to follow the us mkt, us mkt up eur up. Not always, but a lot of the time.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
that 200 ema is so powerful, on any time frame. pa is just sitting on it this is the 1m, and evrything has gone negative, cci Fisher, 13 25 ma cross... but 5 m everything is in tack for a long position...

--- 帖子 #68 ---
another test of the 200 ema on the 1m. 5 m still in tack...(or is it tact?) oh well...

--- 帖子 #69 ---
sitting on the pivot and the 200 ema on the 5 m, Fisher signal starting to go short... but being tested... near the bottom of a trading range also. I got into this trade a little too late. It still may turn around, but there appears to be no force to push things higher.. And US equities are drifting a little also, not really moving in any particular direction with any conviction. A good way for a trader to lose a lot of money. Trade a drifting market.. Looks like a bad trade. Wanted to study the relationship between cci for reentry and Fisher for prominent trend... Only thing is there really isn't much of a trend here to study.. Love the demo.... no pain... could still turn around... But not my idea of quick in and out....

--- 帖子 #70 ---
yech! at least pa is trading above the pivot point (yellow line and the 200 ema) on the 5m

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Ended up stuck in the consolidation all day. Closed out just before market close with a small profit. Sometimes I think "Why bother to even trade a Friday at all or days when there is very little news or data. " This past week: 1.Entry signals generated by the Fisher have all been very good despite some repainting which can be adjusted for somewhat by using 55 instead of 10 (the default setting) and waiting for the 2nd bar after a 0 cross for entry and reloading Fisher every now and then, especially before considering an entry. 2. Preference for trading is 5 m chart for quick trades. 3. The scaling out strategy is not necessary if I am trading the 5m. Next week: 4. How to identify entries into a trend already underway. 5 Continuie experimenting with cci cross of zero in conjunction with Fisher for entering on a pullback. Not enough market action to give it a fair go today. 6. Allow enough room for the stop so as to avoid stopping out too early. Next week: 6. Explore the use of the 1m Fisher signals to identify pullbacks on the 5m instead of adding the cci to the chart. It appeared that if there was a reversal on the 1m but 5m did not reverse, simply pulled back to 0, then the 1m cross back to the direction of the 5m could be the signal for a reentry to trade the 5m for a continuation of the trend on the 5m. In that case cci would not be needed. It would be preferable to not introduce another indicator. The charts get cluttered and like I've heard it said, "If a person has one clock they know what time it is, if they have two clocks, they're not sure what time it is." 7. Results were exceptionally good with the Fisher. 6 out of 6 good entry signals and winning trades. 8. Continue testing on demo. Not ready for live trading. On the right track. Best wishes. take a break. jiva34

Goals: 1. Develop strategy to complement the initial entry signals given by the Fisher indi to identify entry points in an ongoing trend. a.test silver trend indi for this purpose. Only enter in the direction of Fisher indi. Watch out for any repainting issues with silver trend. Only enter after the signal bar closes on the opening of the 2nd bar. b.experiment with the 1 min for confirmations of pullbacks on the 5m. c. begin to develop the exit strategy. possibilities include use of cci, the 1min chart, tweaked settings of macd. New template with silver trend added...possible entry point are shown by the vertical lines.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
yes silver trend does repaint. tested it out see charts below. How serious this is I'm not sure as the trade was good even with the repaint of silver trend. (the bottom indi)

--- 帖子 #74 ---
it may be better to look for entries in pullbacks by taking the Fisher signal on the 1 mi for trading the 5 min... forget silver trend altogether... didn't capture it in snapshots, but an entry signal disappeared altogether on silver trend and the move was missed. It was decent move. silver trend seems to repaint way more intensely than Fisher...

--- 帖子 #75 ---
for instance, comparing the 5m and 1m fisher indi 5 m approaching 0 crossover to downside 1m approaching 0 corssover to upside. If 5min crosses down, then the downtrend is stronger if 1 min crosses to upside then uptrend is most likely to continue. let's see what happens... most likely downside, US equity mkts headed for lower open which usually means the EUR goes down, plus the big candle at the high on the 5 m are bearish...

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Fisher signal on 5m, so bears win...

--- 帖子 #77 ---
tgt is support at intersection of r1 and 200ema stop is just below recent high..

--- 帖子 #78 ---
So I wonder did I put the stop too close? I do that a lot...

--- 帖子 #79 ---
looks like the stop was too close...

--- 帖子 #80 ---
the trade was good, the fisher signal was good, the stop was too close... SO just getting good signals is not allt here is to it. the trade has to be managed properly with proper stops as well proper position size.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Hi Jiva, I am following the EUR/USD, I see on the 15M a downtrend but 5M a 1M are in blue in the Fisher indicator. Would you have taken those entries on 1 or 5M or just waited for white signals to follow the trend? Thanks

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Am taking entry signals on 5m. It's easy to be always right using hindsight, but the signal for entry I would have considered looking at the charts as they are now would be the one with the vertical line through it. from the looks of thing you would have had a great run.....

--- 帖子 #83 ---
new trade fisher short signal 5m. with a stop far enough way tgt set at intersection of 200 ema and r1 I don't want to get too ahead of myself with trying to find entries on pullbacks when I've had such good success just waiting for the trend change, le t me not get distracted from what has been working nicely it's only the 5m, and the trends on a 5 min change several times per day... If I have to wait, so what. Wait...

--- 帖子 #84 ---
I need to forget about looking for entries on pullbacks. I mean if it were the hourly chart or the daily chart, okay pullbacks, but let me get real here. This is the 5 minute chart!!!

--- 帖子 #85 ---
closed out early, had a quick drop down and probably a little retracing in order. just didn't want to wait. Maybe strategy should be for 10 pips, that's it.. If I got 10 pips in 2 mins everytime I entered a trade, well, what's wrong with that? No hanging around. In and out.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Nice thread and powerful indicator. I will begin using this today in a demo account. I like how no new indicators have been added. Keeps things simple and if ain't broke, don't break it! I do have two quick questions I understand using the 200ema. It's a very powerful moving average on many timeframes. What I don't understand is the use of the other two moving averages. What benefit do they add? From the looks of things, they are not needed if Fisher generates the signals. If you want for Fisher to generate a signal and the other emas to cross, you will have probably missed the move. Can you explain how you use the other two moving averages and if they are truly needed. My second question is, how often do you refresh your chart? From what I've read, Fisher repaints but not badly. From my point of view, it does not seem to be a problem. I honestly could care less if it repaints because when the signal was generated, that's what was happening on that chart at that time. If it's giving good signals, the repainting issue is of no concern? How often do you refresh your chart and have you thought about not refreshing your chart and just letting it run and seeing if the signals still are good?

Great to hear from you. Glad to hear you find the thread helpful. looks like we are on the same page... you're right, the other 2 ma's, the 13 and the 25 are really not needed. I guess it's just an overall visual thing for me. Gives me a kind of orientation for price action. Like trees in the background of a portrait. No signal relevance at all. just a kind of general orientation. Maybe it's a "baby blanky" have tried dumping them but felt uneasy. The repainting for fisher is very minimal. Not coo coo like some other indis. I keep an eye on it, but it has not made 1 iota of difference. And yes, it is a breath of fresh air to not have a zillion indicators going every which way and bells ringing like 4 alarm fires... Catchy little trader saying I heard recently really sticks with me, " If a person has a clock they know what time it is, if they have 2 clocks they're not sure what time it is." Sounds like trader's zen... Although I would like to have a sound alert function for a cross of the zero line. Maybe someone who knows coding will take compassion and put one together. I'm tempted to try to figure out how to do it when it's quiet in the market. about not refreshing the charts in order to compare. The few times I've done that there were very minimal differences. Nothing significant. Not enough to invalidate a signal or even give a false signal. Mostly the coloration differences. That is partly why I use magenta for below zero, so any repainting will show up and I can monitor it. Also because I like magenta... Please keep the thread posted on your efforts. Good and bad, we can learn something... best wishes jiva34 I was considering how real teachers do not charge a fee . That way the knowledge can be passed along without corruption.... If a student is also a customer, there is a conflict of interest.... Whatever I have learned of any value has come from teachers who did not ask anything of me.....except my attention... just a thought. __________________

just as I thought, USDCAD went into consolidation after that move down. it may be that the chart to watch for a signal would be the 15 min. but it would have to be the 2nd bar below 0 and that would be no less than 30 mins away. better to stick with the 5 min chart and just follow several pairs... no signal 5 min no trade. maintain the discipline.... the strategy has proven itself good over and over, learn patience... If it's worth having it's worth waiting for...

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Thanks for answering my questions. I also want to comment on something you said in a previous post. I trade the 5min chart. I always target 10 pips. I know some people will disagree with this but I'm confident in my ability to pull 10 pips out of the market. I'm not as confident when trying to pull 50 or 100. I used to try to hit the homeruns and it killed me. Once I started using proper money management (never risking more then 2% on a trade) and targeting 10 pips per trade, my trading results increased greatly. I made 2 trades today (live account) and walked away with 20 pips, which is equal to 2% of my capital. At one point and time I got sidetracked on why I began trading forex...to make money. If I can get 20 pips out of the market each day (on average) I can live very well. Getting 10 pips on my winners makes me more than happy enough. It allows for stressfree trading.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
You are a wise person. I know the truth of what you are saying.. Now I have to live it. It is funny how I know something to be true but faced with a situation I will go against the true understanding. That somehow this time "The law of gravity will be defied" just for me.. greed, greed, greed. What an amazing phenomenon. A blinding effect, make bad decision, then kicking afterwards. Oh, all my money is gone. .. I am determined to learn discipline. I will learn. I am learning. Thank you. jiva34 The 5 min will easily give 10 pips on a good signal.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
You will get to where you want to be when it comes to being disciplined. It takes time. For me, I just got tired of seeing 10 pip winners turn into losers. Trust me, once you get to the level you want for discipline, you will be rewarded greatly. Like you said, the signals are good. I agree that watching multiple pairs on the 5min is the way to go. I'm not worried about the pullbacks. On a 5min chart, there will be many changes in trend direction for you to capitalize off of. I'm just going to wait for the trend to change and enter. I want my trading to be as simple as possible.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Next trade I post, I post for you. 10 pips. 5min. question: How do you calculate your stop? Is it also 10 pips or do you consider your trades hi probability trades and let your stops be more than 10 pips.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Here is where many people will bash me but I know what works for me. I use a stop loss of 20 pips. This allows me to not get stopped out prematurely on normal market swings. With targeting 10 pips, I'm winning between 70-75% of my trades. I try to have a high hit rate and limit my exposure in the market. In doing so, I'm rarely stopped out for the full 20 pips. As price moves in my favor, I do move my stop to protect profits an minimize my risk.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
That is an acceptable strategy I've heard discussed by professionals. It is called "hi probablity trading". The frequency of successes offsets the larger risk. Makes sense like that. The other type of trading I heard discussed was "hi profitability trading" and the stops are set exactly opposite. Because those trades aim at catching the one really big move, they set the stop seriously close and prepare to take lots of very small losses until they are into that one big trade. Also an acceptable strategy.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Glad you understand. Yes, both strategies are profitable. People who can successfully pull 5 pips out of trade on one standard lot at a 65-70% hit rate would see that they probably can pull 3 pips out of the market with two standard lots at an even higher hit rate.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
got stopped out not right time of day? stop too close? no real trend action, more of consolidation pattern? price action hovering around the 200ema. the original sell signal is now repainting to buy. will be interesting to see if the downside resumes and then the signal repaints again to sell. Glad this still just the demo...

--- 帖子 #101 ---
It happens. The method has been money up until this point. This is just one of those times where the market does not do what you thought it would. Nothing more, nothing less. I will share some advice that was passed on to me. I stop trading at 9am PST. At that point, the moves that were going to make me money are over. At this time, the market usually consolidates until the Asian session, sometimes even longer. Also, think about what you got into trading for. I know I've said it before but it's true. I can only tell you to think about it because I was the same way...trying to take every single signal that came my way. All this led to was me overtrading. That in return led to me becoming greedy and trying to make all the money in the history of this business. Bad connection those two things are! If you work a fulltime job, think if you boss offered you overtime everyday after your shift ended. Would you accept? Probably not. You would maybe work some extra time but you have a life too right??? Treat trading like a job...that's exactly what it is. Pick a time that you will go to work. The signals that present themselves during that time, you take. Once your shift is over, go spend time with your family and enjoy life. The work at the office will be there the next day. You will be amazed at what having a daily goal will do for you and your trading. If you have a compound calculator, start with just $500 and watch what compounding at just 2% daily will do to your money.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
the original sell signal has come back even stronger. meanwhile that's the 3rd trade that I set the stop too low. and was stopped out early.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
What was your stop loss?

--- 帖子 #104 ---
20 pips pa went to 6218 right where I stopped out....

--- 帖子 #105 ---
I've seen that happen several times now: the signal appears on fisher wait for second bar, enter trade, place a stop 20 pips or so away, there is some retracing, signal almost repaints itself away, get stopped out, original signal comes back stronger than before pa moves nicely on the signal... if not being stopped out would have had good trade... it would appear to set a stop more than 20 pips in order to stay in the trade.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
If you are seeing that happen, try and adjust for it. Like you said, try a stop of maybe 23 or 25 pips. You can also try and put your stop 5 pips above the most recent swing high (for short trades). Of course I would still not risk more than 2% on each trade but many times on the 5min chart, you get a retrace to test previous s/r and then the move pushes on. I have a method that I trade that I'm going to adapt with Fisher and demo trade it. I will see how it does. I will have the same setup as you except for the regular candlesticks, I use Heiken Ashi candles.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
makes sense times to trade and times not to trade. I have noticed that around 12 est lunch time east coast, it's like nap time.. also your point about treating trading like a job. how not to over trade, yes yes yes.. your are right right right. I know I am on the right path. I hear you. I have the signal strategy. It works. And I am developing the discipline. Very good. Thank you for your generosity in sharing your hard earned lessons. They do not fall on deaf ears... best wishes jiva34

--- 帖子 #108 ---
No problem. I'm like you, I'm just passing on what I was taught...free of charge. You are dead on about it being nap time at 12est...that's 9am my time and that's when it slows down. You are doing great. You have what it takes. I can tell. It's a struggle for all of us. All the professional traders and ones doing it for a living have went through all the same problems. Just in case you don't have a compounding calculator or excel spreadsheet, if you start with $500 and can average 2% daily growth, you will have over $60k in one year. Most people will say 2% daily is tough, for some it may be, but it's not that hard if you stay disciplined. For me and how I trade, that's two 10 pips winners and I've reached my goal. I did that last night is 1 hour. I believe the method you have will take you to the financial top levels of the game. If you add the discipline and patients with the method you have, you will see the money add up and pour in.

I know it is easy to get information overload, but what I don't use right away I file away for possible future use. Know very little about of HK candles. Am all ears. (or eyes whatever...)

--- 帖子 #112 ---
To be honest with you, I don't knoe the technicals about Heiken Ashi candles. All I know, they work for me and my current method of trading. The reason I like them is they don't show the "noise" that I see from looking at regular candlesticks. Most people use them to see the direction of the trend. Since we are trading on the 5min chart, this is very helpful. When prices are rising, I have blue Heiken Ashi candles. When they are red, price is declining. This also helps with retracements. For example on my two winners last night, price was falling. I did not want to get in on the retracement so I waited for the blue Heiken Ashi candles to appear. When they did, I knew the retracement was happening. I waited for a red Heiken Ashi to tell me prices would fall again. Once the first red Heiken Ashi candle closed, I entered short with a target of 10 pips and a 20 pip stop loss. A few minutes later, my target was hit. I know this is hard to see with no chart. I'm at work and can't post a chart right now but will when I get home to better explain.

Thanks for the Fisher indicator. I've been looking at the levels in the Fisher Indicator. Plot horizontal levels at 1.20, -1.37, and 0. Plot vertical lines when these levels are broken. Load Heiken Ashi candles. Right click on your chart. Go to properties. Go to common. Check, Chart on Foreground. I use bars, I can see them better with Heiken candles behind them. OK. Using the Heiken Ashi entries, that were spoken about earlier, plus the Fisher entries at 1.20, -1.37, and 0 gives you many more entries. I use Stochastics at 8,3,3 for confirmation . All the best, Ro

--- 帖子 #116 ---
I use stochastics at 8,3,3, also. I got that from the method I trade each day.

interesting idea using levels on fisher oooooh.. there's the hk-ashi plot... thanks for the info re:chart on foreground I was looking for something that would help identify entries when a trend was already underway. Did not consider using levels, at first glance the use of levels with fisher looks promising. Thanks ever so much for the input. can you post a screen shot of your template and maybe point out with arrows or whatever for your entry points....(confirmation with stoch means what, just the general direction of the stoch indi or does it need to cross something or other to confirm?) visual trader here... thanks in advance... best wishes jiva34

US equities looking for higher open.. USD weakness expected in forex trades. logged on a little late, the pairs were alread trending to reverse yesterday's moves. slight buy signal on eurjpy, went ahead, going for 10 pips. have added a second fisher, set at the default (10) the first indi set at 55 is for entry signals at the start of trends the 2nd indi set at 10 is to help identify entries into trends already underway.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
the long trade looks okay (entered a little late) for future signals idea is to look for signals on the fisher 10, to identify entries into trends already underway. like the short signal on the chart.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
tgt hit, looking for 10 pips...

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Hey Jiva! Nice thread you have going on here. I think it is was a good idea to add the second fisher. Looks like it can really help you on re-entries as well on a sustained trend. If you get a re-entry due to PA you can look to make sure both Fishers agree. However typically how I trade, my re-entry TP would be less say in this case 5-7 pips because you have no idea how long the trend is going to continue. Also this could help you with countertrend trades as well. And as always I look for a smaller TP on a CT trade should I be poised to take one. I still battle myself in trying not to take them, but hey I am a M1 trader... Anyhow you have a nice system. I will keep on watching. Lohad

--- 帖子 #122 ---
using the fisher 10 to find continuation entry signal might look something like this as it sets up... would look for the buy signal on the 10, and enter on 2nd bar after signal bar.. fisher 55 remaining in strong uptrend. the 10 would show the pullback and continutation. that's the idea anyway... Thank God for demos...

--- 帖子 #123 ---
good point, pullback and continuation can tend to be less of a move than the initial breakout. 10 pips is not a problem for the 5m, on a good breakout signal. Typically I'm seeing not less than 15 pips... nothing worse than setting the limit too high and going into the other room for a minute and missing the target as it slips back....10 is usually reached. I like that 5-7 on a continuation.. Thank you. best wishes jiva34 just starting to play with the continuation thing, we shall see. Whatever repainting fisher does is not causing a significant problem and is well worth tolerating for the early signals.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
which way pa is going? what kind of entry?

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Well being a M1 trader, I have a little different view on repainting indicators. I am trading in the "now" looking for a signal at that particular moment. I could care less about what the indicator looks like 3-4 bars earlier. For me if a repainting indicator gives false signal more times then not, well then it is just as bad as an indicator that does not repaint. If an indicator gives me signals on a higher probability trade, re-painting or not and I am successful with it, then I keep it in the tool box. Lohad

--- 帖子 #126 ---
okay, let's see how this plays out. buy signal on 10 set tgt just below r3, (thought to go for 5-7 pips at first but will try for the resistance line...) stop is just below r2. several times the stop is hit because it is too close, and then the pa turns around and the original trade was good. grrrrrrrr. problem is how much do I want to risk if the signal is not good. So far experience has been the signals are good even if they repaint a little, so I will move the stop a little further away to avoid getting stopped out unnecessarily.. this will be the time the signal wasn't good.... the buy signal has repainted and diappeared, this happens and then the buy signal comes back who knows?

--- 帖子 #127 ---
just what I always wanted, another double top... maybe not, support on 1m at 200ema and r2

--- 帖子 #128 ---
the buy signal has returned stronger than before on the 5 min

--- 帖子 #129 ---
exactly.... what I am seeing with the fisher is that it can give signals that get me into the trade early. haven't had a bad signal yet and getting eatly has been very good. (the trade I'm studying right now is a perfect example. At first it gave the buy signal, on the 2nd bar I went long, then it repainted and the signal disappeared, then it came back again even stronger..., now it is disappearing again... Granted this is not my idea of in and out for quick gains, bit I want to see how this plays out. The last 3 times this happened it had a happy ending...

--- 帖子 #130 ---
okay, I'm glad this is happening on the demo. This is what people complain about with an indi that repaints. They get the signal, get into the trade and then the signal disappears. What kind of an ending this time, the last 3 times it was a happy ending.. The original signal was good... even with all the "waffling" The fluctuating is taking place in the 10, the 55 is remaining above the 0 line...

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Well I do not really follow the AU that much, but it appears that you could be being into a strong area of long term Resistance. Take a look at 1HR chart zoomed out. I could be wrong. As I said, I do not follow this pair. If I am wrong I apologize. Lohad

--- 帖子 #132 ---
from the looks of the last consolidation, this could be a while probably right into the US equities mkt open... so much for quick in and out.... not much data today, so the stock mkts will sway things no doubt.. I see what you mean on the higher time frames. If and when it breaks out it would be a new leg up... only looking for 10 pips, I'll take 5... yawn...

--- 帖子 #133 ---
that is why I was only using the fisher set to 55 . this repainting is greatly reduced, like irrelevant. but set to 55 it only identifies trend changes. On the 10 setting it is more sensitive, so I was hoping the 10 setting could identify the continuations after the pullbacks, but it can make me pull my hair out.... just experimenting with trying to find trend continuations signals, this may not be it.... maybe I am just being impatient.. what else is new???

--- 帖子 #134 ---
got out with 1 pip who knows maybe this is the upside break out trade of the century... It's not my strategy for trading the 5 min.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
these are the signals I want to look for on the 10. the 55 remaining below zero and the 10 dipping and continuing

--- 帖子 #136 ---
gonna have to forget about using the fisher 10. it repaints so much that by the time it shows the entry for a continuation the pa is way out of range. fisher 55 is alright for trend changes, but fisher 10 no go... will continue to try to identify continuation entries by watching the 1 min. pullbacks on the 5m should look like a mini reversal on the 1 min. the strategy will manifest when it's ready. just keep plugging away at it and remain open for ideas. Sure would be nice to have a sound alert for the cross of the 0 line. Anyone out there into coding one? best wishes, jiva34

just had to evacuate my apartment. flooded. The river is overflowing and they came in boats into the parking lot. good thing the motel has wi fi... jiva34 (with webbed feet)

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Hi Jiva, Sorry about your apartment. I have an idea on your fisher. Since setting it at 55 cuts down on the repainting issue open a one minute chart and a 5 minute chart. Have the fisher set to 55 on each. When the one minute changes direction place a trade if 5 minute chart is in agreement. I traded this way the last 24 hours and it works well. You stay in a trade a little longer but you dont get wipsawed. Give it a try.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
I was going to suggest the same thing. I think Jiva34 has a solid method. If he (if Jiva34 is a female, I'm sorry) wants to trade the re-entries, I believe your suggestion will work just fine. I've backtested the same thing and it does work well. I would also suggest that if anybody uses the 1min and 5min, I don't think a ton of multiple pairs would be needed. You would probably miss out by trying to scan all the multiple pairs. I would suggest sticking with no more than 2 pairs so you don't have information overload. By taking the trades off the 1min chart also, you should have enough trades to feed your appetite.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Sorry to hear that. I hope everything is okay.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
thanks for the kind words. really the tv reporters were there and they were taking people out in boats.. in the parking lot!!! it'll be a few days before I can get back. I hate motel rooms... River running through Georgia flooding into Chattanooga...(USA) if I didn't have such a head ache I could have dealt with it a little better.. anyway here's what's important, I've got my laptop and wi-fi... just for the heck of it too this trade (demo of course)

I have family in Decatur, GA. Are you trading that range by just selling the top and buying at the bottom or are you trading it based off Fisher?

--- 帖子 #143 ---
have experimented a bit with that. makes the most sense. say you have had some success? very good. I will try this. next few days should see more trending action more data releases and the fed statement and rates coming out Weds 2:15

--- 帖子 #144 ---
1st of all it's lunch time east coast. 2nd pa is obviously in consolidation thrown off by the flooding and evacuation, I guess. bummed out I missed the best times for trading. the trade isn't even worth following but I will study it anyway. Can learn from everything, even if what not to do. what I really want to do is what CJD suggests, two charts of same pair, 1m and 5m, fisher set to 55 on both, when 1m crosses in the direction of 5m consider that a signal for a continuation entry. Guess I'll have to wait until tomorrow to really test it out. unlikely to get any significant trending action rest of today... best wishes jiva34

--- 帖子 #145 ---
I know Decatur, Ga pretty well, just outside Atlanta. Don't know if that flooding is affecting them, Chattanooga is pretty far north of there. To be honest with you, I just took the trade so I could get back into the pace of trading and get my focus off wet shoes... There was a fisher signal but there is obviously no trend going on. If it closes for a profit it will be more else just luck. Stop is just above range and tgt is at the bottom. Never would I ever do such a trade with real money..... Ordinarily I wouldn't even do it in a demo. Wet shoes....

--- 帖子 #146 ---
The fact that you are so honest and open is going to benefit you so much in your trading. If you know it's a trade you would not take, there is nothing wrong with admitting that. In time, rather than take it, you will just pass on it. You are correct about it being dead, it's past noon your time, which is a time to usually quit. I did not get a chance to trade last night either. Don't feel bad...it happens. You will find that when you are trading with real money, the less you trade, the more successful your trading will be. I'm going to focus on just one pair (E/U) and use both the 1min and 5min charts. I already was using that but just did not trade last night. Stick to being disciplined. There is no need for the Fisher at 10 and I'm glad you got rid of it. Like you said, the method will progress on it's own in due time.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
that's where I think a sound alert would help. Instead of sitting at the screen and staring waiting for a cross of the 0 line, could be baking a bread or reading, etc... since I wouldn't enter until the second bar after the cross there would be 4 or 5 mins to analyze things. have been scouring the web and other forums to try to find such a fisher indi and haven't found one yet. There is actually very little on fisher. most people try to use the 10 setting and got bucked off the horse with the repainting. Have tried to research coding one myself, but I don't know code. I thought if I dug up an indi that does have a sound alert I could study the code on that imdi and maybe figure out how to make one for fisher. But it's way beyond me. Will keep trying to get the sound alert for the fisher. There are some indis that have arrow alerts for fisher but not sound. The more I sit and stare at the screen looking for entries the more likely I am to take a trade just in order to trade. But if I don't monitor the screen I miss good entries. that is why I think the sound alert would be very helpful. I know that focusing on one pair is a very good way to go. Get to know that pair inside and out , and the different pairs do trade differently. I wish I could commit to do that. I'll need to sit with that idea for a while see if I can make it my own. As always your input makes my day.... best wishes jiva34

yawn.. following this trade because I took it. lesson, don't trade just for sake of trading!!!!!!!!!!! Trade to make money.....

--- 帖子 #149 ---
i think the idea of having 55 setting for 1min and 5min is good. is there someone who could convert the fisher into multi-time frame? that way we could have both indis on one chart

--- 帖子 #150 ---
wow.. now there's a great idea. maybe someone who codes will trundle on by and make needed changes. a sound alert for the cross of zero and multi time frame (1m, 5m) on the same chart. That'd be great!

--- 帖子 #151 ---
tomorrow's another day. No floods, the motel is on the side of a ridge... wi fi is good signal. Lots of data tomorrow should be very active day. (the consolidation for this pair could last forever....)

Hello Jiva34 I´m using your system and I think is good and profitable. But I have a problem. The sound alert for the Fisher indi is not working, and I not turned off it. Thanks,

--- 帖子 #153 ---
That's great, you are having some success. I am happy for you. There is no sound alert , that is something I am trying to get for fisher. We need someone to code it and add it to the indi. Sound alert for a cross of zero. We need it. best wishes jiva34

As Siuol has suggested am going to try to control my wander lust, and focus on just one pair today. EURUSD makes sense since it is the most widely traded and is very active, also spreads are usually narrower than most other pairs. benefits are to really focus on how the pair trades, just one pair... All the different pairs have their own peculiarities, advantageous to really get to know how they affect the price action of the pair being monitored... this is going to take some real discipline on my part. I tend to want to watch at least 6 pairs to look for signals, don't want to miss anything what I notice to be honest is that several of the pairs have pretty much the same response to changes in market conditions. Since the majors are all linked to the USD, they more or less will trade tandem at announcements. So Why would it be necessary for me to watch so many, USDCHF is pretty much a mirror image of EURUSD, EURJPY and USDJPY very often trade in a similar manner.... It seems to be more of a distraction than a help. But it something to do. Keeps me jumping from chart to chart. But how productive is it for making money in trading? Siuol wrote something recently, something to think about, "The less a trader trades the more money they make." Just being busy can be counterproductive, but it is addictive... So how to break the addiction... Today I will try. EURUSD it is.... I'll keep 2 charts of EURUSD, the 1m and 5m. (Hey, I'll still have charts to jump back and forth to, just see so not completely cold turkey, just turkey...) look for signals on the 5m for trend changes, and use the 1m to identify pullbacks and reentries. That's the plan. Oh, also to only trade during certain hours. Just before London open, starting at around 1am est or so and not after 12n est.... This is a lot for me all at once. But I know if I want to succeed, and I do, this is what I need to do. Blindly trading on "signals" is not the key to success. best wishes jiva34 Watching the EURUSD.. lot of data out of Europe am, and then of course the FED 2:15pm est..

okay here's the first trade (this is demo, not ready for real money, when I am in the profit demo then I go real money) stop is set with great risk than reward ratio to avoid getting stopped out too early, and this is considered a hi probability trade, which means this type of trading should be more successes than losses , making up for whatever losses there by more good trades. tgt is just above the 200ema generally a very powerful support resistance area...on any time frame.... not to confuse things, hopefully, have added an indicator for trend lines, These lines change as the short term trend changes... trend lines are helpful and breaches of the established trend lines are usually significant for pa direction... looking good..

--- 帖子 #159 ---
at this point I closed the trade. just before reaching the 200 ema the pa bounced. so rather than turn a winner into a loser I closed a little early

--- 帖子 #160 ---
the original tgt was good perhaps a clue to the exit would have been that the fisher indi on the 1m remained neg. perhaps it would have not been necessary to exit as long as the 1m fisher remained below 0. Could have moved the target and stop to try to catch a bigger move. in the past this has not worked out very well, scalping is scalping and to try to turn a hi prob trade into a hi profit trade may not be the best strategy.... anyway a winner is a winner... there was a little more downside...as it now sits very "cutely" on the 200 ema...on the 5m

--- 帖子 #161 ---
okay, back to monitoring the EURUSD for entry signals. but only after a little snack break best wishes jiva34

--- 帖子 #162 ---
data for eur pmi out in 20 m. want to test out value of signals on 1m for pullback and reentry. fisher is neg on 5m, has turned bull on1m and then back to neg. Is this a pullback? enter short and we shall see. stop is 20 pips tgt is just above the pivot point, not shown on 5m. with data coming out in 20mins, how will EURUSD behave? will it move at all, will it whipsaw, ??

--- 帖子 #163 ---
seem to have better results just waiting for a signal on the 5 min. may have entered too soon using the 1 min. better entry would have been as shown, on the 2nd bar after a signal on the 1m. Not sure I want to trade using the 1min at all. Will follow the trade, I took it....even if is just a demo, how can I consider using real money if I cannot become profitable using a demo? so just a demo? if fisher 5m crosses above 0 line I will close. and enter long in 2nd bar after cross. looks like the data release for EUR didn't have much of an effect. GBP bank minutes released in 25 mins, curious to see what affect if any that data might have on EURUSD.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
fisher is still below 0 on 5m, while above 0 on 1m so the trend is still down... pullback still in the cards...

--- 帖子 #165 ---
USD weakness on GBP banks statements? not much of a an effect on EURUSD. looks like Fed statement 2:12pm est is the one everyone is waiting for. if fisher 5m crosses above 0, will enter long on 2nd bar after the cross.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
interesting developments pa appears to be breaking down bottom of the short term range,,hmmmm

--- 帖子 #167 ---
very often pa will test a pivot point once it trades beyond it. It will return to test it before either breaking it and moving beyond it or failing and falling back to reverse the trend.. the tgt is set to just above the pivot point which doesn' t show on the 5m chart. but can be seen on the 15m. pivot point is the yellow line... also there is somewhat of an intersection of the pivot point and the 200 ema, so it can be seen as an area of strong support and resistance... fisher indi also indicates short position, shows below 0 line

--- 帖子 #168 ---
trade moving in favorable direction fisher 5m still below 0 line, short 5min on left, 15 min right maybe for trading the 5min, the 15min chart would be more helpful, rather than the 1 min...

--- 帖子 #169 ---
one more little push and the tgt is hit... I hate to say anything for fear of jinx.... but this makes about 8 straight wins using this indicator..... I might have to start trading real money at this rate..... (in case anyone wants to try this out, the setting for fisher is 55 not the default 10) there is a little repainting, but not a problem if 55 is used and entries are only on the 2nd bar after a signal bar) best wishes jiva34

--- 帖子 #170 ---
this is too much.. another winning trade... am I dreaming..

--- 帖子 #171 ---
It's at this point, when the pa is almost hitting the tgt but hesitating, that I am tempted to close early. Thinking, what if that's as far as it goes? And I miss the goal, and have to either sit through a forever consolidation in the hopes the pa moves again my favor, or risk turning a winner into a loser waiting for it to turn back... in this particular trade, I'm tempted to wait it out, although the pivot point has been just barely reached, the 200 ema sits just below it on the 15 min, a test of the pivot very often overshoots the pivot to really give it a good test. with the 200 ema sitting just below the pivot I'm going to leave the trade on thinking it will reach for that 200ema on the 15 min. All fishers, 5 and 15 are still short indication.. just when things are getting really interesting I have to pack up my laptop. Am at work and the next shift is about to come in the door.... back in a while jiva34

--- 帖子 #172 ---
hey jiva34 ill code the alert for you, should not be a problem question is, do you want to use the 1m for alert too - like 5m just crossed the 0 line, alert only if 1m indicates the same direction?

--- 帖子 #173 ---
GREAT!!!

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Great Thread. Still studying. Wondering why Heiken Ashi isn't part of this since there's no discussion of candle patterns...would see reversals clearer. sorry bout the flood. I live in Peachtree City and went to Sandy Springs to help my son clean up his basement flood. All is fine now. Your honesty is refreshing. Steve

--- 帖子 #175 ---
hit the tgt, right on!!!

--- 帖子 #176 ---
answer to a prayer..... alert I am thinking of is a sound alert just for a cross of the 0 on whatever chart the time frame is set for. But please please please make it with an on off function so it can be turned off too. so 5m time frame, alert for that chart open another time frame chart and the alert could be set for that time separately, whether it was the 15m or the 1m, or whatever. no extra conditions added. Just a simple cross of the 0 for whatever time frame the chart is set for. Don't know your level of expertise or how complicated it would be, but arrows or dots also would be great (with a turn off turn on function?)... (Not asking very much, just everything.) much much thanks whatever you can do...... jiva34...

--- 帖子 #177 ---
There are so many tools for us to use to identify the price action. Whatever you care to share about use of HK-Ashi, or regular candle patterns is more than welcome. It is not something I put much emphasis on in my own trading at this time. Although I do keep a watch for very unusual candles. Like ones with very long wicks, or very obvious reversals like harami... Hk-ashi is whole 'nother planet I haven't visited much yet. The building inspector has to come before the electric can go back on, and the inspectors have a very long list, so it could be a while... Boy does it start to smell bad very quickly after flooding....you know like those clothes that someone forgot to take out of the washer and didn't remember until a day later. phew!!!

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Since the plan for today is trade only the one pair EURUSD I am now back to watching for signals on the 5m after 2 good trades since London (and a lot of time out to play "flood victim".) okay, fisher buy signal 5 min, entered the trade and then some repainting this is not unusual and has not been a problem, even when the signal completely disappears, what happens is the signal comes back even stronger after a few bars... So let's see. stop is just below pivot point and 200 ema tgt may need to be moved, for now it is set at just below an upper trend line resistance in the 15m.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
May be the stop was still too close. Will follow the pa for a while to try to learn something.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
You are doing great! Keep it up. I think you have seen that sticking with the basics (only taking signals on the 5min chart) is working out very nice for you. Just my opinion but if you are not making money (even if it's demo) trading the pullbacks, why bother with them. I will finally get to trade this method tonight (my schedule has been hectic lately). I will trade the 4 majors and watch only the 5min signals. Since this will be an experiment for me, I'm going to change a few things to try and help Jiva34 figure out some other possibilities. I will be using Parobolic SAR to determine my stop loss. I will also be using Heiken Ashi candles I suggested early and I'm comfortable with them because I use them in my everyday trading. Jiva34, can you please post the pivot points indicator you are using as I will be using that also. I will begin trading this method at the start of the Asian session this afternoon. I also will not refresh my charts and see what significance that has on the signals with the very minimal repainting issue.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
this happens a lot. If the stop is too close, get stopped out of the trade before it has a chance to turn around. the fisher buy signal is now coming back, stronger... do I dare enter again? yes stop loss below swing low on 5 min tgt just below trend line resistance on 15 min

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Siuol is on the case!!! Alright. Getting ready to mix things up!!! Not as in "mixed up" but as in "mixing it up" like really getting things going ........ the alert is being worked on moetzger has offered to code it.... phew.... what a blessing that's going to be....

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Yes, I will post my screenshots only if that's okay with you. This is your thread and I don't want to disturb what you have going. I just figure a little spice can't hurt. I'm still using the same indicator with the same settings. I'm just adding P-Sar because I know you are having trouble with when to determine when and were to exit. Hopefully my results will shed some light on some possibilities. Where can I find the pivot point indicator you use on your charts?

--- 帖子 #184 ---
the trade was stopped out again and again the buy signal disappeared. I think I am not paying enough attention to the major trend which can be seen on the 15 min. It is down, has remained down the whole time. Trying to buy the buy signals on the 5m was simply trying to trade counter trend, which is not a good trade since there is so much resistance in that direction, like trying to swim up current... If the 15 is below zero then only short trades should be taken on the 5 min. Let me try to keep that in mind.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
actually, dying to see your setups.... here's the pivot indi I've updated (somewhat) the 1st page of the thread.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
This is what trading is about...going through the ups and downs. It happens to all of us. Your honesty is so refreshing. So many people will just come up with an excuse. I agree with you that trading in the direction of the 15min chart is best. I will actually cut down to 2 pairs rather than the 4 majors. I will trade E/U and U/J. I currently trade E/U and have been for years so I'm very solid with it's be havior. I chose U/J because with my live broker (I'm starting on demo but have no doubt I will see enough to trade it in my live account) it has almost the exact same spread as I get on E/U. Stick with watching the 15min for trend direction and enter on the 5 min chart and you should have less stressful trades. Always remember, the trend is your friend. Counter-trend trading can be profitable but stressful too. For me, it's just not worth the level of stress.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Thanks, I'm dying to post my setups. It's a shame how a J-O-B can get in the way!

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Idea is to get the job out of the way

--- 帖子 #189 ---
this is why those signals for the last 2 trades were not to be taken even though they fit the original requirements, a second bar appeared after a signal bar. the trend was not supporting on the higher time frame. Here it is again. If anything they could be showing the pullback entries I was so keen on trying to find earlier in the forum. So the trade is not a buy on the countertrend buy signal on the 5m but a short when it crosses back below the zero on the 5m because the 15m trend is still down.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
I like that!

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Did you enter on the cross back below?

--- 帖子 #192 ---
then time to enter short that these brief buy signals on the 5 that repaint and disappear are actually the pullback signals and entry points for continuation of the down trend. As such let's check it out. Entered short stop well above the 200 ema on the 5m tgt (very boldy placed) just above 200 ema on the 30 min (doesn't show on charts) that's a frustration with the charts on meta, can't move the plots around to allow for future movements up and down and further into the future than the chart shift function allows for.. It's probably silly to even try to trade at all right now, since it's almost lunch time est, zzzz, and the pairs will mostly tread water until after the Fed speak 2:15 pm est... will follow the trade anyway, educational...

--- 帖子 #193 ---
yes but it's almost lunch time, zzzzz and Fed speak in couple of hours... don't expect anything significant. just for study purposes..

--- 帖子 #194 ---
the price action is sitting on the pivot point and will probably just sit right there for 2 hours.... until Fed speak.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Nothing wrong with educational purposes. This will let you know if it's worth taking trades so close to lunch time in your live account. I suggest to anybody to use a demo account in many ways. It can be very beneficial.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
good one

--- 帖子 #197 ---
question is, is this another brief buy signal on the 5m that is going to disappear and show a pullback and continuation signal like the last signal, which was good.. so I should wait until fisher crosses below 0 again? guess so. of course it is lunchtime est, zzz and Fed speak in 1 1/2 hours...

--- 帖子 #198 ---
waiting for a cross below 0 on 5 min to signal a continuation....

--- 帖子 #199 ---
on the other hand if fisher crosses up over the 0 line on the 15m then that would be enter long..... evidently using the 5m and the 15m is a better combination than trying to use the 1m and the 5m... then again with about an hour until Fed speak, maybe no one going anywhere.. ...

--- 帖子 #200 ---
oh ghee, if I had taken that buy signal on the 5m, just see I could have had a good trade... nada..... still a counter trend trade since, 15m fisher is still below 0. thing about the countertrend signals is that sometimes they can move pretty decently but more often than not they are short little moves. Not worth the risk.... better to wait to see if the reversal is for real by getting buy signal on 15 m. and then only going long on the 2nd bar after the signal and 5m has to still be above 0.....

--- 帖子 #201 ---
I agree with you, more times than not, you will get burned. Here is a piece of advice, don't even comment on the trades that don't follow your rules. For me, when I set my charts up today, I'm trading with the trend only (whatever fisher on the 15min chart is saying). The reason for this is, if you start looking at "what could have been" you will begin to inch closer and closer to trading them. Just look at them as the proper step that must be taken for you to get bac in the market. Be honest and ask yourself these two questions. Your answers will determine a lot for you. Are you okay with taking a trade in line with your rules and having it turn out to be a losing trade? Are you upset about missing out on a trade that did not follow your rules but would have made you a ton of money? Now, out of these two questions, which one bothers you the most. Are you except more on losing on missing out? Think hard on those. I'm curious to see what your answers will be.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
good questions: the more dangerous position it seems to me would be to be upset about missing out on a trade that didn't follow my strategy rules.. If I think like that then I may be tempted to take unnecessary risks outside the rules of my trading strategy. And my trading discipline would become compromised. The worst thing that could happen is I could be successful trading outside my strategy . A bad habit would form and I would be tempted to do it again. So I may get 3 or even 4 good trades, but then my strategy would be pretty much gone and the losses would start to roll in and I'm lost, out in left field, duh? what happened, who am I where am I.... Strategy, what's that, let's flip a coin.... Reminds me of how a thief makes thieving a career, until they are caught. Might start out with small thefts, successful, then go for something bigger, and bigger, and boom in the clinker..... Career finished... But if I have a loser following the rules, and I will, because it happens, the rules of the strategy are guidelines , most of the time they will hold true, sometimes there will be wild cards, that go outside and produce a loss. But if it is a valid strategy the wild cards are extreme cases , like the tail of a probability curve. Most events are inside the curve, a few events will be on the extreme ends. There will be some losses. No one likes it, no one wants it. But losses will be minimal. By sticking to the strategy most trades will fall inside the probability curve. Rate of success will be greater.... Thanks... simple truth that is easily lost in the "passion" of the moment in the market place..... thanks for making my day jiva34

test of the 200ema on 5 min...

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Speaking of the 200ema, it acts as s/r but you can also use it as a filter. Only trade long when price is above and short when price is below the 200ema. Just something else to think about if you would like. Hopefully I'm not giving out information overload and making things worse.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
I guess the best way to get to the point of having faith that the particular system actually works is to practice with it. Wins and losses. Live with it. So then again it's gotta be counterproductive to run after a possible trade outside the system... since the purpose of practicing with the system is to become confident of it and to know it's weaknesses and strengths. Running off down the road after maybe a buck, what's the use? Actually if I think about that that is a strategy. The Run-off-here-and-there-and-maybe-I'll-win ... strategy. The loser strategy!!!!!!!!

favorable winds for you in the Asian mkts...

2nd test of 200 ema 5m possible pullback signal on 5m fisher at it shows just below 0 line. 15 remaining above...

--- 帖子 #212 ---
the pivot point (yellowline) should act as support especially supportive is the intersecting of the pivot point and 200ema on the 15min trading on a news release is always more risky. Looks like it tends to be an extreme event , and may not fall under the rules of a strategy.. For big moves around a news release it may be better to wait for the first pullback.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Me personally, I never trade on NFP or FOMC announcements. That's why I'm waiting until the Asian session. Everything should be back to normal by then. Those two announcements are just two risky for me. Oh and don't believe those signal providers who say they win 80% of the time with NFP and FOMC annoucements. They are lying. What they do is open to demo accounts and play a buy order in one and a sell in the other and they show the results of the winner...pretty sneaky huh!

--- 帖子 #214 ---
With fisher1 ...

--- 帖子 #215 ---
no doubt about it best times to trade are just before London open up until noon est... but for real money, I would need to trade only those times... Eur and GBP data comes out early just before European mkts open, and then USD data comes out just before US markets open. Definitely the best times to trade. for studying and practice purposes am trading at other times. maybe I shouldn't. Maybe this is another pitfall and somehow compromising a strategy for success and developing true discipline. Masquerading as practice and study. Tricky stuff. Tomorrow I will only trade during those times.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Misuse of intelligence to do like that. two accounts pick the winner. monkey business. on this last trade I jumped in on fisher signals, but during extreme events like fomc, etc, fisher is not for that.... that should be part of the strategy, not to trade those events but like you are doing wait for the normal trading patterns and avoid the extremes. bad trading habits...

--- 帖子 #217 ---
You are right, those are the best times to trade. It's demo, so it's no harm and you are just starting out with this method. I would say that at some point though you trade exactly how you will in your live account. This way your transition from demo to live should be smooth. For me, I trade live from Frankfurt Open (11pm PST) and stop at 9am PST. That's enough for me. For instance, I will set my charts up today when I get home but I won't take a trade until Frankfurt begins to open.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
thanks looks like calculates the overall strength of fisher over all the time frames? can you explain a little? jiva34

--- 帖子 #219 ---
yes best times I should do that... Successful trading is obviously more than just buying and selling signals on a chart.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Interesting to follow fisher in M5 and also over more a long period (ex: H1)

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Yes, it's just like running a business. Nothing any different.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
another bad practice is biting the dust right now. the temptation to make the quick kill on extreme moves at news releases. I bought this on signals from Fisher, but new rules apply Fisher signals that appear on news events are to be disregarded. the moves are extreme Fisher is good during normal trading. Not for extreme moves... this would have been huge loss. If I keep shedding all these bad habits there isn't going to be anything left!!! I mean, it'll just be a boring day making money......

--- 帖子 #223 ---
just gives you some overall view? strengthening, weakening?

If fisher M5 crosses 0 and that, example, M30 or H1 &gt; 0 while going up, can indicate a stronger signal ?

Also CCI(55) seems to be giving pretty close signals compared to Fisher(55). And it doesn't repaint. http://i35.tinypic.com/5v2j3t.gif

--- 帖子 #229 ---
does, doesn't it!!! nice observation. Thanks.. may want to use cci instead... there is a multiple value cci indi that can intertwine different values of cci in the same window. worth looking into, maybe more reliable than the fish... same strategy, just more reliable indi... if taking cross of 0 looks like cci gets in same time and sometimes a little later (of course this is in hindsight would be better to test live mkt) where would you take a signal on cci? cross of zero or 100 levels? I would think cross of 0 better.. best wishes jiva34

googled SnakeForce and seems lot of the discussion is about repainting. Fisher repaints too but the repainting has not stopped lots of good trades. will keep an eye on it. thanks for the heads up. lots of good suggestions are being posted. thanks jiva 34 (may the SnakeForce be with you)

--- 帖子 #234 ---
hey there ive finished the indi, sorry for the delay. its a seperate indicator, so you must have fisher1 installed already im no indi coder, so it could be done more easily i think settings should be self-explanatory. arrowShift is used in points, so the default of 20 is for 5-digit brokers. on 4 digits it would be too far away, so use 2 instead, or whatever suits you it looks strange sometimes (two down arrows in a row) because of the repainting of fisher have fun with it - and make some pips!

--- 帖子 #235 ---
looks like EURUSD setting up for long position. long signals are there on 15 min, waiting for entry signals on 5m the 2 window on the bottom are being tested for confirmation of signals and for identifying pullback reentries. the top window is good ole Fisher middle window is cci set to 55 bottom window is SnakeForce let's see where they agree, where they diverge and how they might work together... could enter long at this point as this is supported on the 15 min but waiting for indis on 5min to give the go ahead. specifically the cross up over 100 by cci on 5m. the fish and the snake all say buy... just waiting on cci... another consideration is the resistance at the pivot point, may not break through.... better to wait...

--- 帖子 #236 ---
EURUSD long stop just below swing low on 5 min tgt just below r1 on 15 min (may have entered a little early, cci 5min did not quite cross the 100.., all signals do agree on 15 min..) There are 2 positions showing on the 15, one position is was placed yesterday, the one under consideration here was the one placed at 1.4766

--- 帖子 #237 ---
all systems go

--- 帖子 #238 ---
looks like tgt is gonna get reached... this is where I usually want to close early. Thinking what if pa doesn't reach the tgt, it's close enough now, let me close and take whatever profit is there. I close out and then pa does reach the tgt and beyond. So let me keep this position open and see what happens... The tgt looked readonable to me when I opened the position, there is nothing directly indicating that the move is over,,,

--- 帖子 #239 ---
actually on the 30 min the uptrend shows as just starting, the cross of the 0 line by the cci specifically shows that may be the case while everything else remains positive. US open is indicating ahigher open which supports the EUR and weakens the USD... favorable winds...

--- 帖子 #240 ---
here's where I might find it useful to look in on the 1m Fisher above 0 cci above 0 snakeforce mixed looks like a little pause with the uptrend to be resumed...

--- 帖子 #241 ---
What is your setting of the snake force indi?

--- 帖子 #242 ---
closed early am remembering that at one time I was considering making a set goal of certain number of pips the tgt.. for a 5min chart 10 pips is easy. If I had used that strategy would have reach the 10 pips easily as it was, the pa went for 15 pips then pulled back, is still pulling back closed for 4 pips. will see how to refine the exit strategy...

--- 帖子 #243 ---
the default on the indi...

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Yes, I was also thinking about the cross of 0 with CCI(55).

--- 帖子 #245 ---
looks like the cross of the might show a new trend beginning, and a cross of the 100 strengthening of the trend. a cross up of 100 for long and cross down of 100 for short. good for entry on pullback and continuation... will keep working on this along with the Fisher... best wishes.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
I am following your thread with great interest. Just an idea with the CCI. when there is a signal with 55, look if it matches the direction of 275 (5 times higher TF). On 5min charts, it looks like good probability for 10 pips trades with SL at last swing high/low. Just an idea. http://i37.tinypic.com/59vwqf.gif

--- 帖子 #247 ---
exiting if I think about it 10 pips is very good. easily achieved on a good signal on the 5 min 2 trades a day is a lot of money. to increase profits, increase the lot size. The gains could be very significant that way. bigger lots not more pips per trade.... next trade will be like that 2 lots, look for 10 pips...

watching the EURUSD l ooking for a cross up of 100 on cci 5m continuation signal Fisher is above 0 snakeforce is mixed 15 indis are favorable...

--- 帖子 #249 ---
maybe entered a little too early again read the candle time wrong, in my enthusiasm thought it said 2 seconds left till candle clothes, wrong, 2 mins. so cci crossed up 100, but anything can happen in 2 mins. so maybe too early anyway stop is below swing low on 5 min and just below pivot point tgt is 10 pips. oops was going to open 2 lots, oh well only opened one... next time 2 lots... oh oh forgot to check the calendar... didn't want to trade right around major data reports. 15 mins till US employment report, can be a major mkt mover.. even if the mkt doesn't go anywhere it can whipsaw quite abit... guess I'm trading in mys sleep today. sleep trader...

10 pips unemployment down should ge at least 10 pips

--- 帖子 #254 ---
anemic response to good unemployment data closed early 5pips.. will probably continue on higher, indis all are bullish anyway I closed early total for the day so far 9pips... 2 small profit trades...

--- 帖子 #255 ---
watching 1m, little overbought on 1m pa bumping up against r1. would expect pa on 1m to pull back so cross below 100 on cci, and down to 0 cci then a rebound. would consider that an entry point for long..

--- 帖子 #256 ---
you'll need the indi's too. if you click on the paperclip image at the top of the page it will reveal all the indi's that are posted on this thread...

--- 帖子 #257 ---
entered long again, all indis positive.. tgt 10pips stop just below long bull candle... (there are two trades on the chart the higher priced long is an older trade..) duh, would have been a good idea to check the 1m before jumping in... all the indis there were negative

--- 帖子 #258 ---
kinda like using moving averages and watching where they cross. Only an indi like cci doesn't have as much lag as ma's.

I'm gonna get it right... news releases....grrrr. best to wait until after the news and the new trend is defined. not before news!!!!!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #262 ---
back to using the fisher 10 and the fisher 55 when both are blue buy when both are magenta sell look for 10 pips stop can be 20 pips no trades before news release just trade the one time frame 5m keep it simple... stay focused

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Got really distracted today. like there wasn't even a strategy at all, 3 indis on the chart bouncing from one time frame to another. dizzying back to basics. using the 10 and the 55 makes sense. hope your day was better. no way ready for real money!!! best wishes jiva34

--- 帖子 #264 ---
hi jiva, are you a full time trader? Cheers..

--- 帖子 #265 ---
my goal I'll get there. yu?

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Okay, here is my first screenshot of my chart. I'm going to keep things very basic and simple. I was going to add P-SAR and decided against it. Before worry about how to re-enter, I want to learn to enter correctly. My rules for how I use this method will be very simple. I'm using HA candles instead of the traditional candlesticks. I will target 10 pips on all trades. My stop loss will be 20 pips. I know this is not great MM but it's a demo account and from my view so far, the hit rate seems good enough to offset the MM. For long orders I will wait for Fisher to cross the 0 level. I will do exactly as Jiva34 suggest and wait for the open of the second bar before entering. I will only enter however if my HA candles are in agreement (Blue=Buy...Red=Sell). So if Fisher crosses the 0 level upwards indicating a bullish trend by my current HA candle is still red, I will wait for HA to close on a blue candle and then enter long, as long as Fisher is still bullish. That's it. I'm not going to complicate things anymore than they need be. Also, I will only trade from 9pm-9am Pacific Standard Time. This will give me enough time to make my daily target of 2%. Once my account is positive 2% for that trading day, I will stop trading and go do something else. I am strictly trading this method on a demo account. I also do trade a live account with a different method so I need for this to stay very basic for me so I can still trade my live account. As of now, with this method, I only trade two methods...my live method and this one. Good luck to all those involved and let's see how this goes.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Siuol, Are you using the standard HA or the smoothed version?

--- 帖子 #268 ---
My platform only has one HA indicator so I'm going to assume it's the standard. Sorry for not being specific on that.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
After doing some thinking I will tweak my trading in one way. I will still use a 20 pip stop loss on all trades but I'm going to exit on an opposite signal. This is not what I do with my live trading method as I target 10 pips but I'm going to experiment with this demo for a bit and see what kind of results I can get with exiting on an opposite signal.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
nice. very basic. looks good. I see what you mean about HA candles filtering out a lot of the noise in regular candles. I'll be using 2 fishers 10 and 55. I'm going to try using the HA candles. I like their simplicity... so I will look for a signal to enter when both fisher 10 and fisher 55 are in the same direction. I will enter on the 2nd candle after the signal candle. I'm looking for 10 pips per trade on the 5min and 20 pips for the day. Let's see how it goes. If you want to screenshot and document your trades and your reasons for entering and exiting, please feel free. I can learn something... Pray for me that I can avoid the distraction traps.... Unbelievable how easy it is for me to wander off the main road... Great to see you on the thread.. I think we've got a winner!!!!!!!! jiva34

--- 帖子 #271 ---
After seeing Jiva34 go with the 2 fisher indicators, I like that idea. So, I'm going to borrow it and use that also. Of course, there is another twist. I will use Fisher (55) for my entries and Fisher (10) for my exits. I still will use a 20 pip stop loss. My entry rules are the same as Jiva34 as both Fisher indicators need to be in agreement and my HA candles also. My exit will be when Fisher (10) crosses in the opposite direction that I am trading. My reasoning for this is Fisher (10) from what has been said gives false signals on entries but Fisher (55) does a great job on the entries. So I'm going to see how Fisher (10) will do on the exits and from my quick backtest it seems to cross when the trend either goes sideways or is changing completely. I've attached my updated screenshot. Last change...I swear!!!

--- 帖子 #272 ---
yes it repaints big time

--- 帖子 #273 ---
At the moment my day business its very slow, so its been less than 2 months i've been trading live (mini account), made some, now back to breakeven ... still trying to settle down with 1 system that has good risk/reward with higher win/loss ratio... I know i should demo first, but would like to take that risk, at least i'll learn to control my emotions, which its still a major factor for me...

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Have you tried it on forward trading? I'll start forward trade this system... since it repaints, then i got no choice to try it out at demo account first before live account. Cheers...

--- 帖子 #275 ---
I applaud you for taking the risk. I suggest to anybody testing a system, start it on a live account. It let's you know how your emotions will really be. I will be trading and posting my results from this method using my demo account but every signal, I will also take in my live account. I will just trade it live at 1 penny per pip until I'm comfortable with it. Once again, I applaud you for taking that risk. It will benefit you in the end.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Thanks siuol.... what time will you guys start trading this system? are you guys on any chat room, like msn messenger or skype? Thanks

--- 帖子 #277 ---
I will begin trading at 9pm PST tonight as I'm on my way to work in a few. I'm only on this forum.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Is there an auido alert any where, that we can add to the fisher, when the bars cross the zero line..? Rebel

--- 帖子 #279 ---
There are two coders who have shown some interest in putting the audio alert together, haven't heard from them for a few days. I've scoured the web and several forums to try to find such a thing, no luck.. Not much dialog on the fisher. It would be very helpful. best wishes jiva34

--- 帖子 #280 ---
That you are facing the emotions issue head on means you are aware of the importance of controlling it. Trading has been a very "sobering" experience for me. And still is.. Welcome to the thread. jiva34

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Hello Jiva34, In this moment, could you define SL &amp; TP related to time frame? For example : 20 SL / 10 TP to M5... Thank you....and great job!

--- 帖子 #282 ---
You may want to try this. I believe it to be the same as Fisher but with audio alert.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Is it the same as Fisher, meaning does it react when Fisher crosses the 0 level? I'm just asking because it has a different name so I want to make sure it will react the same as the Fisher indicator we use. A way to find out if you don't know is apply it to a 1min chart since you get more crosses on a 1min chart. Once it crosses if the aleart kicks in, it should be okay to use.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
I saw your question so hopefully you don't mind me answering. Yes, the 10TP/20SL is for the 5 min chart.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
thanks ever so much for the indi the one you have found is much better and yes it is the same fisher just someone gave it another name. on off function , (much appreciated) and a pop up window... 1st class... thanks again... this will be helpful to anyone trying to work this system. Now I don't have to stare holes through the screen!! and still somehow miss the cross...... This is it!!!!!

--- 帖子 #286 ---
INCREDIBLE!!! Thanks for this. You just made a lot of people happy.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
I would like to contribute in this thread, so I did a template with all indicators shown here and others. So, if Jiva34 see any mistake, please post here. Sorry About the english....

--- 帖子 #288 ---
and more indicators and template....rs!

--- 帖子 #289 ---
after closer scrutiny per Siuol's 1 min test, the alert is directional alert. not just a 0 cross. . it alerts when the directions changes. So it is not exactly what I was hoping for since we are more interested in just cross of 0. I will need to check out the other alert I found but which is not up on the thread. As always Siuol is the wise one....

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Good catch. I would have done the test myself but I'm at work so I can't because I don't have access to my platform. I guess we are back on the search again.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
looks like you got it all... glad you're here. We're all learning together. we have decided not to use a lot of the indi's since it was getting too confusing and just went back to the fisher. I am attaching what you would need to trade along with the latest strategy...Others may be using a slight variation but this is what I will be using. I decided to try to keep it simple.... we don't want to make too many changes but from time to time I am sure there be updates and a few changes here and there. So keep checking the thread. Let us know how you are doing or if anyone posting here can help you. The candles on the chart are Heiken-ashi. They are a special type of candle. What I did to get them was: select Heiken-ashi in the indicator section of mt4, then right click on the chart and the menu will appear go to the bottom of the menu and click on properties . for bar up, bar down, bull candle, bear candle,line graph chose none for color , click on common tab and select chart on foreground. Hope that helps if you want to use the Heiken-ashi candles

--- 帖子 #292 ---
okay. Think I was able to change the code from direction alert to cross of 0 line alert. If I did, it was unbelievably simple. Maybe I will look into learning how to code. Might not be that hard to do.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Hi, What are the paremeter settings are? still same. 10 and 55?

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Set up and ready to go with great high power trading system ready for disciplined trading. today's the day.... Enter when either fisher 10 or fisher 55 cross 0 line so that they are both the same color and sloping in the same direction , long if blue, short if magenta tgt 10 pips stop 20 pips follow one pair, EURUSD look for set ups only between Frankfort open and 1/2 hour before noon est. strictly adhere to the rules. count down to Frankfort...

--- 帖子 #295 ---
same... 10 and 55. This is really exciting... I think this is a winner......

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Today's trade for eurusd Anyone took this trade?

--- 帖子 #297 ---
for discipline sake I am not allowed to take any trades until after 2am est. but it looked good...

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Looks like you might have a entry now... I took it... demo of course

--- 帖子 #299 ---
I saw that, but I was considering that both fishers should be sloping in the direction of the trade... stronger signal that way?

--- 帖子 #300 ---
how did you get those mini screen shots?

--- 帖子 #301 ---
wanted to take profit later on, but decided on stick on 10 pips profit... first trade out...

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Thats simple just use paint software then use this tool called 'select', but first you need to print screen then paste it at paint. After clicking at select, now select the area of your choice, then just cut it, (ctrl + c) or edit &gt; cut, then open new paint, paste it on it... done...

--- 帖子 #303 ---
may have made the same oversight as Greenmoney, both fishers shouldbe sloping in the direction of the trade. fisher 10 is divergent didn't look carefully enough, all I could see was a big bear candle..... My situation may be okay since movement on the fisher 10 are usually drawbacks and continuations in relationship to the fisher 55 which I am considering as defining as the more dominant trend of the 2. This is very new to me, to be strict with rules. But I know it is the right thing to do if I ever want to be successful at trading. so stop is 20 pips, tgt is 10. Now I go into the other room.....

--- 帖子 #304 ---
I think I may have entered wrongly on a divergence. Am thinking if the 10 is devergent it may not be a serious as when the 55 is. The 10 can be a shallow retracement, but the 55 is more likely a deeper retracement or even a reversal. I might be lucky this time. Thanks for posting your efforts. We are learning together. best wishes jiva34

--- 帖子 #305 ---
stopped out... sometimes it may necessary to set the stop further away than 20 pips. But for today we stick to the rules hard and fast.... today is an experiment... signal is not all that clear. wanna wait

--- 帖子 #306 ---
earlier posts I was excited about this Fisher indi and how it doesn't repaint... Well it does repaint , just not anywhere near as obviously as the previous one used on the thread. it only repaints a little bit.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
yeah.. it does repaint... notice that too... the previous bar's of fisher its resizing according to the current bar's close... Will continue to forward test this indicator, coz we cant back test this system, only forward test will show us the results... Hopefully everyone that follows this system, will post their results here... Cheers...

--- 帖子 #308 ---
if the follow through on this more downside, I would want to wait for 55 to solidly confirm and the 10 to be sloping in the direction of the trade. just wondering how much the repainting is confusing things... what looks like sloping up now, 5 bars from now might be repainted to look like the perfect entry point with slope down.... yikes...

--- 帖子 #309 ---
signals are there again, going to disregard the divergence issue, since the repainting may be affecting that

--- 帖子 #310 ---
boy do I wanna move that tgt lower.. today is discipline day! this has to be one of the most difficult things I've ever tried to do. Just stay on track!!!! 10 pips. it's not even real money, it's a demo!!!

--- 帖子 #311 ---

3rd loss

--- 帖子 #314 ---
gonna try trading the 1 m ashi candles look real good on the 1m can see a trend pretty nicely try putting it together with fisher and varmov. couldn't be any worse... I'm not sure I understand discipline. There is the aspect of accepting what the market will give, strict discipline is like demanding the market give what I want. Anyway. it's off to the 1m. obviously no way near being ready for real money... following the 1 m would have captured the move

--- 帖子 #315 ---
if varmov and fisher go positive, would look to enter long

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Welcome to the dark side Jiva... Fridays can be tough sometimes. Something to note. When trading M1 you may not always get 10 out of the deal, I personally look for 5-7 on M1 but if PA is going good, I may try to hold on, however It I reach the 5-7- pip goal I will never take a loss. I will exit on BE or +1. I am not trying to tell you how to trade, just letting you know how I do it on M1. Lohad

--- 帖子 #317 ---
coming from you, I give careful attention. no stranger to the dark side, I'm afraid. Just haven't visited here for a while... Thanks for the tips.. best wishes jiva34

--- 帖子 #318 ---
what do you consider a reasonable risk? 10pips? on the 1m

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Typically I will use the last swing low or high as my stop. Now when I do get my signal if I am too far from the last swing l/h, I do not trade. I try to keep the R:R as close 1:1 as possible. I know it is not the best R:R ratio but it seems to work for me! Lohad

--- 帖子 #320 ---
good trade using system 6 pips changed fisher to 10

--- 帖子 #323 ---
trading the 1m goes so quickly that it's a little harder, sometimes impossible to get screenshots of what's going on. have been buying when varmov blue when fisher blue and selling varmov purple when fisher magenta. Technique scalping (fisher by a new name) is set to default 23 varmov is default. working out nicely. 2 to 8 pips...per trade

--- 帖子 #324 ---
kinda jumped the gun on this one. fisher didn't cross below 0 but varmov was giving the signal

--- 帖子 #325 ---
just took 2 pips been like that all morning. 2, 3,5 pips....

--- 帖子 #326 ---
I don't have a chart to show because I placed this trade last night but I rode the ride up to 1.4800 and jumped off the train for a 27 pip profit for 3% of my account and quit for the day. I used the standard Fisher indicator.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
standard meaning 55?

--- 帖子 #328 ---
like from here to here?

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Yes.

--- 帖子 #330 ---
I can't remember what time it was exactly but I know my entry was at 1.4750 and I got out at 1.4777 last night.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
take a look at the technique scalping indi (fisher with alert) set at 23. it looks even better at 23 than at 55...... some day I'll be able to trade like you.(re:Siuol) please post your screenshots when you can. breaktime coming, the weekend... whew...

--- 帖子 #332 ---
maybe I should just trade the dots. I think I will just for the heck of it..

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Why not. You are trying everything else, might as well give it a shot. You may learn something new or be able to make your trading simpler. Remember, simple stress free trading is so boring but so financially rewarding. Yes, I will post screenshots. I feel bad for not having mine from last night. (I have my live account statement if nobody believes I took the trade!!!) I got caught up watching a movie with my girlfriend.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
I sent you a PM Jiva34.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
for which system rules you took the trade? cheers...

--- 帖子 #336 ---
last 3 trades were all wins no visible price action. no stress..... not even ashi candles...

--- 帖子 #337 ---
why not buy signal dot turns blue and fisher 55 is blue exit fisher 10 turns magenta sell signal dot turns magenta and fisher 55 is magenta exit fisher 10 turns blue.. that's all I'm doing anyway even with candles, or ashi's or pivots or ma's whatever. so just get rid of all of them and get rid of the stress of watching the price go up and down... just trade the dots... (Like paint by number) stop and reverse system...

this strategy just manifested a few hours ago. I am using it on the 1m. EURUSD. this is really the results. no doctoring. swear to it. I just got so frustrated with up and down every minute sneeze of a price swing, I just erased everything.. Bingo.. Is it Monday yet? best wishes jiva34

Keep at it. I'm happy you have found something you like. Can you outline your entry and exit rules for us all? I suck at 1min chart trading but I will give it a shot at 1 penny per pip.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
JIVA those 2 and 3 pip trades would not even cover the spread..?

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Interesting find Jiva. I will check it out. I am a littler worried about how clear support and resistance can be read this way. But if it makes the pips then the goal is achieved. I will report my findings. Lohad

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Jiva, I am running a simulator on your setup, of course with my little twist. Albeit I am still learning this method and it is only two trades into it. I am 2-0. I think I am seeing possible re-entries on the chart. I missed it as it is running, but can you see the possible re-entry?? Very interesting. I will continue through the weekend and post my findings. One more thing. I threw the line chart up for my guidance. I feel like I am flying less blind then. Looks like the line chart price cutting back and forth thru the varmov can be a hint. Like I said my review is early but so far it looks good. On my picture you can see a series of vert lines. Yellow = 1 of 3 signals met, Orange = 2 of 3 signals met (get warmer), Red = 3 of 3 signals met (enter trade). I will post more thru the weekend if I have time. Lohad

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Thought I was the only one crazy enough to spend any time on a Saturday with this.... Fisher 10 supplies exit signals when it diverges from the others and entrance signals when all three agree. Varmov and fisher 55 give entries. At least that is what I am going to test initially and what I used on Fri afternoon (of all times!) when I actually test it forward live trading it'll be a little clearer how they all work together. I tried to draw on your chart...LOHAD There is a better Fisher indi, I'm attaching. It has sound alert cross of zero and pop up window. It repaints but not as wildly as the first one. Someone evidently did some work on the indi and then renamed it. Technique scalping...Forex trend Interesting about the line plot crossing back and forth varmov... varmov doesn't repaint. at least I have not seen it do it so it helps for entries along with fisher. How are you running demo so that you get those unique symbols for buy and sell on the chart.Like you see when doing a strategy test of an ea? Did you make this an ea somehow? Thank you for posting your work. We're all learning together. There's more than enough pips to go around for everyone!! It's an ocean of pips...

nice of me to work for the broker like that.... Guess we'll have to go for little more each trade... thanks for pointing that out. kinda slipped by me in all the excitement... on second glance, the posted results were after spread.. so that is realized gain

Hello everyone. I woke up earlier than normal so I figured I would log in and see if anybody was online. Nice to see the thread getting some action. I have converted my charts to the dots but I kept up the line. I did not know that anybody else was doing that but I think it's a great idea. It gives me an idea on what price is doing. I was using the old Fisher, so I will convert to the updated Fisher and see how that goes.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
I went a little radical and trade only with the dots and the price line. It tells me where to place my stop. I like the 1-min charts. I gives you quicker entries and exits. It keeps you in the trade longer and you can get away using a tight stop for a big target. Nice thread.

I sstarted to follow this system last week, and good so far, but the true is that I do not like to risk 20 pips in order to get 3-5 pips, imagone that you have 3 losses in a row, hoa many winners you need in order to get just to break even? So what do I do? I use 15 min charts and I take what market wants to give me, I use an expert advisor that when I get 12 pips profit It moves stop loss to brake even point and then It begins to trail my gains with a 30 pips trailing stop, yes sometimes I got nothing but sometimes I get as much as 80-120 pips so that compensates any losses. I have been trading for many years, I do not use any indicators pure price action but I foundd this topic and I like sometimes indicators when they are simple, also remember and take into consideration pivot points and take a close look at .00 .50 levels, they really work. Also I have found out during many years that a strategy with a poor risk reward ratio will not be successful on the long run, any risk reward ratio less than 1.1 for me It is not worth it, but this is just me, trading is also a personal style. Regards

Jiva34 was risking 20 pips and targeting 10. I'm not sure where you read to risk 20 pips to just target 3-5. The trades that are posted showing 3-5 pip winner are from scalping the 1min chart and I don't believe 20 pips was being risked in those trades. I could be wrong though. Sounds like you have a nice method. If you choose to join in on the topics on this thread, I'm sure you will be sharing some tidbits of wisdom.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
I'm lost and confused on how trading the 1min charts keeps you in the trade longer. Can you clear that up for me please?

--- 帖子 #355 ---
My rule is on three dots. In and out. Stop at the last swing high or low within a reasonable distance, not exactly at the top/bottom of the swing, to avoid double top/bottom situations. In 1 min chart I give 3-5 pips room on my stop. Exit using three dots, same rule. If you take a closer look at 1 min chart, you can get away with 8-10 pips stop and get a nice swing of 30-40 pips. In this particular trade, S/L was 8 pips and I got a nice rundown for 30 pips. Sometimes, I leave some money on the table but is better to write down your rules and stick to them no matter what. I prefer to enter on a pullback against the moving average. Not always perfect but it works. I was using HA candles with line graph. But I think these dots are better IMHO. You can go any timeframe you want, I prefer 1 min because I can use tight stops and manage my trade better. Hope it helps.

WP3VV, Although I am excited that there is another M1 trader on this thread. I am quite skeptical of what you profess as true when it comes to your trade. First off, let me tell you I hope that I am wrong. But it appears that you pointed out a great trade on Saturday on a dead chart. I have to ask, did you really take your trade that you defined? Or are you showing an example on a visual backtest? Because if you did really trade this on a live chart. can you post a pic on the actual trade? It is really easy, just drag the trade on your chart from your trade history to the chart. Something tells me you are seeing good possibilities on a dead chart and putting together a system. Which is great! We all try to put a system together when PA is dead. BUT being a true M1 trader, I know it is a lot tougher to hang on for 30 minutes for 30 pips. I am no pro, so if this really happened, please show. And if it really happened. Please explain to a fellow M1 trader how you have the nerve to scalp that move. I am also looking to learn. Lohad

"but the true is that I do not like to risk 20 pips in order to get 3-5 pips" No one said risk 20 to get 3. "I use an expert advisor that when I get 12 pips profit It moves stop loss to brake even point and then It begins to trail my gains with a 30 pips" That is great...... on M15 "close look at .00 .50 levels, they really work." Actually take a look at the 80/20 levels. Beware at these levels..... this is for M1 and M5 traders. Good Trading! Lohad

on second evaluation: the posted trade results are profit results, spread cost has already been calculated. So that is realized gain............

--- 帖子 #359 ---
I'm going to try to keep pa off the chart, even line graph. (I will follow profit and loss on the positions window. I'm not sure what would be acceptable loss for this system yet as I have to see on live testing the ratio of wins to losses for signals.) Woodie CCI club does a similar exercise when training users of his system, They only have cci on the chart and try to identify Woodie's patterns. Of course I am still just trading demo and am in no hurry to trade live with a system that is still so much in development. Now talk about discipline.... I will follow pa on the positions page to look for profits. When I see profit sufficient I may decide to close early before fisher 10 confirms. No one ever lost money taking a profit... Back testing this briefly I found signals and calculated worst case scenario . In other words I looked at the data window (only for finding values for the back tested data not for live trading) and for the buy signal I assumed to buy at the high and for closing sell at the low. results were: close 1.4674 buy 1.4667 +7 pips close 1.4673 buy 1.4671 +2 pips still open 1.4690 buy 1.4670 +20 pips (There were 2 short signal that I did not take. If I had taken the short signals using same rationale, worst case scenario selling low and buying high for short positions results were -1pip and -6 pips. So overall net including the still open position would be +22 pips) There's plenty of pips for everyone...What is it, trillions of $$$ traded everyday in forex!!!!!

I took the trade and it was just minutes before NY open on Friday Sept 25. I've been trading using 200 moving average (and price) for years. This is somehow different but it works. Actually, I use metatrader as a guide only. I was lurking on this thread and I saw that you guys had this Varmov indicator working. I had this indi on my shelf from some time now so I decided to give it a try of Friday at NY open. Actually, I've been using HA candles on 1 m charts just for a twist. As I said before, I think these dots are better. It is not different that I explained in my last post. I always look for a small risk-high reward trades. In my "official strategy" (200 moving average - price) I look for pullbacks against the moving average with no more than 10 pips S/L . I got the nerve to take those trades because I risk no more than 1/2 percent on each trade, so no biggie if I get stopped. That's the real trick. Besides, I can get back on the saddle again. Of course, everything has limits. Apart for look on how many pips here and there, I see things on % terms. In my head, for instance, If I risk 1/2% to get 2% a day or more, Its a good deal. Sometimes you get more sometimes less. Even 1% is nice. My humble advice, forget about backtesting. It's worthless. Backtesting only serves to give you a false perspective on what to expect in the future. The truth is that markets are like moving sand. You never know. I've been fortunate to make a living out of forex for some years now. Patience and common sense plays a big role. I started to be profitable in this business when I started to incorporate simplicity (1 indicator and price) and placing risk on my comfort level rather than x percentage of capital. 1/2% risk a trade per trading capital is where I situated my comfort level. Good enough for me to make a living. My trades are not based on the dots alone. They're just an indicator. Trade the price in relationship with the dots. You still need to look price in order to place your stops, as I described in my last post. You must keep an eye on PA due many reasons including a sudden burst in volatility. Trading just an indicator could be deceiving in the long run. About PA dead and everything, listen, there's no way I can show you a live chart. I mean, bear with me but I am not savvy on camtasia or any of those fancy programs that shows charts in motion. Simply put, whenever I see the conditions that match my rules, I place a trade. No second guess. If you like it, please try it to see if it works for you. As for the dots, I am in the same boat as you guys.I am just transferring the rules I use for my primary method. It's been good so far. Just in case, I don like metatrader because: 1) execution is slooow. 2) the stupid 5 pips limit rule. My humble apology to jiva if I hijack this thread for some reason. Regards.

welcome... we're all learning and developing strategies together. dynamic.. I do follow price action but not on the chart. I follow it on the positions page. no stop set, but I have a limit I am willing to lose. Not sure what that is yet for this system. Will have to live test. If this system is good more times than not. Since I am looking to scalp. It is the 1m chart..... I will be happy with 3-5 pips profit (after spread) per trade. Let me do 10 of those per day and gradually increase lot size... I will be very happy. Very very happy..............Let me do 5 of those per day.... My temperament is not for holding trade long time... not at this time anyway. glad to see you on thread. thanks for sharing your work.. I find the 200ema very helpful for general orientation also. Thanks for reminding me of my old friend 200ema... keep us posted... best wishes jiva34

--- 帖子 #362 ---
might add the 200 ema. to help define the major trend and avoid taking counter trend trades.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
I want to spend some time researching what, if any, patterns develops on fisher and varmov that coincides with a reversal as opposed to a retracement. Like what would a double top look like in fisher and in varmov? If it is a recognizable pattern? We know that when price action gets very far from the 200 ema there is a good possibility for a significant pullback which could be tradeable even if it is counter trend. Or it could be a reversal, at least in the time frame that is being traded, and also tradeable. So just making a rule no trading short when varmov is above the 200ema is not a practical rule. Some of the best trades are reversals and they begin with what looks like a countertrend. best wishes jiva34

--- 帖子 #364 ---
from what I am seeing just briefly looking at the charts is that a cross of 0 line of the fisher 55 so that fisher 10 and varmov are all in agreement will mark a reversal.... perhaps a hint to not take the long trade would be the angle of the dots. kind of flat, whereas for the 2 short positions the dots were descending steeply. Even to take that long trade would still have been okay, to get out right away. There seems to be a spacing factor, something like what happens with psar. The steeper the decent the wider the space between dots. for comparison sake I put the candles back up...

--- 帖子 #365 ---
I see what happened as far as the unique symbols for buy and sell on your chart. I didn't know there was drag function in mt4 where you bring up trade history click on a trade from the past and drag it onto the chart and it would appear there. Now I do. That will make things a lot easier for discussing trades I mean to try to capture with a screenshot what's going on on a 1m while it is in progress is not at all practical.

--- 帖子 #366 ---

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Good morning from Wisconsin Jiva, Yes this is I would post a trade when trading a M1 chart. trying to do this ad you are trading is too difficult to do while trying to manage your trade. This also shows you where exactly you got in and exited. I use this a lot to review my own trades at the end of the day (both winners and losers). I am constantly trying to make myself disciplined enough to stay in the trade longer and let my winners run longer. Normally I have a set TP area for each trade and then I look to get out. A lot of times I leave a lot of pips on the table. It is a balance of greed and proper execution. Maybe wp3vv can explain some more of his techniques for us. Maybe it is just something that can only be gained with experience. I was not able to run the simulator any more yesterday but I will try to do some more today. Regards, Lohad

--- 帖子 #369 ---
CLick the paperclip on the upper right hand corner (next to the pages). Look for the indicator called varmov. Lohad

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Good morning Lohad and everyone. if time permits, I'll post some of my trades. I look for 1 hour before NY open and I avoid significant news at 8:30 AM. Look for post #360. Hope it helps. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
The simulator runs too fast on 1 min and it wouldn't load 5m so I ran 15m. There may be something to using the Bol bands... Hi, LOHAD, starting to look like our old friend bbmacd.... but it appears that when varmov crosses the 20 and the bands expand we're headed for a significant move. also helps to identify consolidation... stay away.. my first attempt at using the sim, clumsy fingers... this system could lend itself well to automation....

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Here's a trade I took tonight 9/27/2009. Just a couple of lots, light trade. I took the trade (demo) on Metatrader for illustration purpose and on my trading platform. So far is going good. Notice the pullback and the follow-thru. Actually, I am canceling the trade now - 3 dots rule.

the 55 and 10 and varmov have all agreed to the downside, however the bb are tightening which suggest a consolidation, something to be avoided...Would need to see the bb widening....

the bollinger bands are really helpful for this system... this is going into a consolidation for a while so even though fisher 55,fisher 10 and varmov all said go short, the bands said, uh.uh... there's nothing behind such a move right now..

Good morning Jiva, Do you know how to turn the alarm off on the varmov indicator? If so could you let me know? Thanks, Lohad

--- 帖子 #386 ---
should be there in input menu. Right click on chart, click indicators, chose varmov then click on inputs, true or false for sound.... what s'matter, squeeky the mouse getting to ya?

--- 帖子 #387 ---
looks like it was a breakout back to the upside... too bad I had work, missed it...

--- 帖子 #388 ---
looks like more upside bb widening 10, 55, and varmov all agree however without a fresh signal it is hard to know what the risk reward is. Is this towards the end of upside and a retracement is due? Big risk... so better to wait for a fresh signal... it's only the 1m so signals come often enough in an active market...

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Yup I tried that. Still get the alert screen. No the noise does not bother me. It is when I am trading I am always in front of the screen. I do not need the alarm to buzz me to tell me what I am already seeing. Just a little nerve racking when I am going to pull the trigger and then this screen keeps popping up. As you know when trading M1 you need to have full attention and that screen just bugs me. Does any one have the mq4 file so I can modify this and take the alert out? Thanks, Lohad

I took the red support and resistance levels from the 60 minute chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The salmon 20 ema had crossed the pale blue 50 sma, always a good sign. This indi is lovely.

has it's possibilities.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
I've tried to access the code but it is copy written and they have locked everyone out. Unless someone viewing knows how to circumvent being locked out of the code and can post the answer. I slide the window to the edge like way out of sight. I can usually get it so far off the screen that it is pretty much just a little edge of something or other...

--- 帖子 #394 ---
fess up time bad trade.. maybe I did not wait long enough for a real consolidation... got caught in what is know as a "classic head fake". Looks like action is breaking out one way and does for a little bit then goes in the other direction like a rocket. Will have to consider more carefully the bb all the signals were there but bb really hadn't narrowed very much and certainly not for a significant amt of time.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Tricky isn't it but something I noticed about this indi is it doesn't move towards zero and reverse like cci's do. What I mean to say is that if you look at the 15 min chart just before you entered short it was just changing from white to blue, signaling a long. Plus you could say you were shorting into an ascending trendline from the 15 minute chart and also support at 1.4623. Not trying to be clever just my observations. I think it wants to go down but you got in just a bit early. The 20 ema (salmon) crossing back down below the 50 (pale blue) sma on the 5 minute chart might be a good signal to close any long positions and go short. Alternatively just wait for the fisher 55 to drop below zero again along with price action at support and resistance levels. I am really enjoying using this indi, thanks again.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
This will work. Thanks Lohad

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Before I trade real money I want to have as much of these things worked out as possible. This system is based on the fisher, by adding the bands it was becoming all about the bands... Let me stay focused, once again, forget the bands... I am going to take as many signals as I can, some will be good and some will be bad. Let me see how it looks in the end, net... One thing I might do different is keep a 5m chart open on my other computer. I tried having a 1m and 5m split screen on the same computer but it was a little confusing. By having them on different computers it is a little easier to look at them.

I have a feeling that EU may have done most of it moving last night (asian session). There is no real news coming out in the NY session. I am guessing it is going to be choppy PA today. I am trading this system this morning to see how it performs live. So far mixed data. However I was late to the party and not taking a lot of the signals. I am -2 over all so far, but there is time to bounce back..... Still thinking this system is good. I think I would have a hard time with any system. Still getting into the swing of things mentally for me this morning. Lohad.

I just don't have it today. Walking away for the day. I am attaching my set up. I took the fisher 55 off, just going with fisher 10. however I only trade M1. I do not think I would suggest taking fisher 55 for 5 minute traders. attached is a pic of my set up. vert lines are possible entries. I did not take any of them. Not mentally there today. So I will save my money and take the morning off. Actually the first two would have barely gotten me anything, maybe even some losses if I was not quick on my toes. the last two would have hit my TP. Shoulda coulda woulda. Happy trading! Tread lightly would be my advise. Lohad

--- 帖子 #401 ---
thanks probably good idea to take the day off. No data. I expect the downside pressure on the EUR to return when equities take a dip. If you have a minute sometime, could you explain your entry and exit? What is the vertical bar indi? would you post it? thanks

--- 帖子 #402 ---
okay okay so I'm really really crazy.. but look at this!!!!! This is the Heineken-ashi smoothed indi in connection with the fisher indi set at 23. That's wild... I wanna play with this a little see where this goes.

Can you please attach the Heiken Ashi smoothed indicator. I don't seem to have that on my Interbank FX platform. Looks pretty solid. I suck at 1min trading but I'm going to try it today as I have the day off tomorrow so I can really put in some time trading.

Am experimenting with trading without the usual candles, lines or bar graphs. So far has been very good. trading with the ashi smoothed candles interesting... very interesting... I am following price action by the horizontal lines for bid and ask at the bob up and down and also the positions page telling me profit or loss.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Looks good so far... for the new ashi smoothed candles... Goin to try it out, your using the default settings right for the ashi smoothed

--- 帖子 #409 ---
default yes for ashi, for Fisher I have started using 23...., only one window for entry and exit... the price action can be very different from where the ashi candle is... so I keep an eye on the horizontal lines for bid and ask. It's funny sometimes the bid and ask is way above the top of the ashi candle on the 1 min, but way below the last ashi candle on the 5 m. Interesting... But yes, I have been trading this way last few days. I liked the way the ashi candles so clearly mark the trend, and the pull backs. They don't seem to have the same kind of lag a color moving average has. The varmov was a little too choppy. Anyway the Fisher is the king of the thread just trying to find a good match for checks and balance. Good luck, keep us posted on your findings. Am going to try for 5 trades, min 5 pips each, total for day at least 25 pips. Am going to try to do this for several days (make it the norm) in preparation for real money trading.

and going the smoothed ashi candles really highlight the trend... with no noise I just have to be careful to monitor the relaionship between the price action (as seen from the movements of the horizontal bid and ask lines ) and the candles. Sometimes the horizontal bid and ask lines are very far away from the candles... there is sill no exit signal (ashi blue and fisher blue...)

--- 帖子 #413 ---
too nerve racking, counter trend slow and scary.. probably good for more but out with 1 pip profit, better than a loss... (beside I'm at work and at minute the phone can ring, yikes.) probably going to the 200 ema on a retrace. that'll be it for a while, job calls, back into trading again around 7:30am est. goal 25 pips, that's 9...

Good morning Jiva, I threw a PSAR on my chart and I am finding it a good indicator for exits. In the attached picture I have noted entry, possible area for "being on the look out" for exit, and a positive exit signal. I am also noticing when the PSAR dots cross the HA smoothed, it lets me know to keep on the look out for possible exit. I will try to trade this chart this morning. Let me know your thoughts. Lohad

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Hi Jiva, please take this in the spirit it is meant but I cannot help thinking you are making things difficult for yourself. I took a similar entry to yourself this morning using fisher as the trigger, but as with yesterday I use old levels of support and resistance as targets. You can draw these levels on your charts just once and never touch them again add a few trendlines when necessary then use fisher to trade the breaks. 3 trades and 3 winners and 100 ish pips on demo using fisher yesterday. Todays trade was live and I'm done trading for the day. Here are two charts, the 15 minute to show the levels I had drawn before entering the trade, the second is the 1 minute to show how the price reacted at those levels. Still a work in progress but I am finding watching fisher on three timeframes across three screens, the 1, 5 and 15 minute is helping me get a feel for immediate trend direction. I hope this helps some and keep up the great work.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
that's exactly what happened, retraced to 200 ema... which is where the exit signal occurred

--- 帖子 #417 ---
interesting about the psar.. price is a lot of time very far away from the smoothed candles. I am keeping track using the horizontal bid and ask lines, they don't write a trail on the chart but I watch them in relationship to ashi... a lot of time price will come in closer to the candle after a signal and it is a better time to enter, or exit even with a signal. the ashi candles do not move very much, part of why I like them so much. but price does. using psar in relationship to ashi is an interesting idea. in general using psar as a stop and reverse system for swing trading on a regular chart never produced a profit for me. But maybe in relationship to ashi??? keep us posted on your findings. let's meet our goals today....

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Attn Lohad, changed the code in Fisher to stop the alerts. I was so eager to get them a while back, but really that window popping up every 2 seconds is cookee. attached is the indi with code changed, quiet, no pop ups... just make sure when attaching it to chart, that input says alert: false... aaah peace...

--- 帖子 #419 ---
goal is 5 trades 5 pips each total/day 25pips little behind but only 9:00am est total so far 3 trades 13 pips

--- 帖子 #420 ---
little hairy, hedged long and short same time 5 pips and 9 pips = 14 pips so 13 pips + 14 pips = 27 pips somehow made the goal...

--- 帖子 #421 ---
absolutely love the way the ashi candles completely ignore all the volatility and define the trend so perfectly... with the Fisher signals this is great... just have to keep an eye on the horizontal lines for bid and ask.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
this Fisher indi has to be the best kept secret in forex... happy for you that you are getting winning trades. Traders' temperaments are different. There is no way on earth or elsewhere I could trade your chart setups. Just too much going on for me. But for you they make perfect sense. The proof is in the pudding... You have winning trades. I follow what you are sharing in a general way and have to agree with you that reference to trend lines and support and resistance are powerful forces in price action. I use the 200 ema and pivot points. Not so much the standard trend lines, although when there is a reversal, a break of the trend line is a dead giveaway, the trend is reversing. I will try to study in more detail the charts you posted as that is how I learn. We all learn from each other, so thank you for sharing for the benefit of all.... The old saying, many hands make light the work. Traders sharing and working together to "get there" makes all the difference in the world. Very enlivening. best wishes jiva34

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Hi my friend , how are you doing better? With fisher at 55 or at 23? Regards

--- 帖子 #424 ---
23, the one window gives very good entry and exit signals.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Thanks but what do you mean by one window? Regards

--- 帖子 #426 ---
just the one indi, set at 23, while experimetning sometimes there were 2 fishers looking for divergence. not necessary, one indi in one window set at 23 is giving both entry and exit. It's working out very nicely, so we don;t want to change it if it good... see the chart , like that... are you trying the system? any luck?

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Great my friend, just one more thing, how do you deal with the repainting issue? I am asking because I have no confidence in repainting indicators because of past experiences, but you seem to do ok even with an indi that repaints. Thanks for advance for your answer

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Have you tried ema 144? At times market react more to 144 than 200... let me know if i am wrong...

--- 帖子 #429 ---
The Fisher I am using (attached) has had some work done to it to keep it from repainting so violently as the first one we used. It still repaints slightly so yes I have to be careful. So far I have been able to tell pretty much if the signal is strong or not by looking at other factors, such as distance from 200ema (blue line), proximity of a pivot point or s/r line, time of day... 5 m chart... etc.. even by looking at the US equities mkt during US trading session... EURUSD tends to go up when mkts go up. Not always but a lot of the time. Since I am trading the 1m, a little repainting is not a big disturbance. Things can move so fast on the 1m that I may already be in and out with 2 or 3 pips profit before repainting starts. To know if it is good for you try working with it on a demo or the simulator. I just found an mt4 simulator. works great. just like real time trading. (do a paper clip search of the thread. I posted it. instruction manual also...) best wishes let us know your findings.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
okay day 2, yesterday goal was met goal was at least 5 trades with 5 pips each total for day was 27 pips here's the first trade for today.. 3 pips

--- 帖子 #431 ---
There was a bit more to go on the downside. just see how nicely the fisher indi and the ashi smoothed coincide to confirm trend shifts...(white vertical lines) trades not to be taken because there was no agreement between the two indis are outlined in maroon rectangles. only thing is to watch price action, sometimes the actual bid and ask prices are very far away from the ashi smoothed candles. should wait until the prices are reasonable...

--- 帖子 #432 ---
there is some repainting for fisher ashi smoothed do not repaint there was a buy signal on fisher and a buy signal on the ashi. but after 3 or 4 bars the buy signal on fisher disappeared. This can and does happen. What I have doing is leaving the the long posiotion ope and just adding a short. at some point there will be some retracing and I willl take the long off for either a small loss or even sometimes a small gain. The short position is the main position and I will manage it just as if the long wasn't there for now.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
closed the long for 9 pip loss total for day is -6 pips.. the short is staying. the higher time frames all indicate lower so even though I am trading the 1m I am thinking to go with the 5m now that the trade is on. the tgt would then be on 5m 1st tgt would be 200 ema (blue line) at 1.4602 2nd tgt would be the pivot point (yellow line) at 1.4587

--- 帖子 #434 ---
okay hit the tgt at 200ema so total for today after 3 trades is +8 pips goal is 25

--- 帖子 #435 ---
This link has fisher indicator that doesnt re-paint... http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...72&amp;postcount=3 goin to try it... Any suggestion? Cheers

--- 帖子 #436 ---
that one is better than the original one.. it still does repaint a little, but not that much. One thing that is helping me to tell if the repaint will change the validity of the signal is to check the next higher time frame. A signal that repaints is usually showing a small correction rather than a reversal. By checking the higher time frame and seeing the strength of the trend there it can be easier to discern if the signal will repaint or not. Nothing is set in stone even with indis that don't repaint... be sure to have good money management. I have been experimenting with placing an order to open in the opposite direction of the the trade instead of using a stop. A hedge. If trade is stopped it is loss. Finished If instead of stop I place a an order for opposite direction then it has been possible to recoup some of the loss on a retrace later on and very often capture a profit on both directions, especially with EURUSD. Such big swooping trend changes all the time... The fisher that I am using has had a lot of work done to it. Some one renamed it. It's attached to the post if you want to try it. Best wishes

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Good morning Jiva, I am really liking the Fisher indicator. However, I cannot break my old ways and go semi-blind with no candles. So I have incorporated your method with mine and I am getting great results! I look forward to fine tuning this system. I will post my theories as they come about! Keep up the good work Jiva! Lohad

--- 帖子 #438 ---
alright!!! That's what we want. me too... my whole life has changed... Tasting some real success... aleady made my 25 pip quota today... 8:30am est... 4 good trades, 1 blooper.... 28 pips... That's 2 days in a row.... This needs to be the norm... So 3rd day will try for quota again... will use rest of trading day to research and practice... I love having no candles or bars or lines for price action. So stress free. Just keep an eye on the horizontal lines for bid and ask and and the profit or loss figures in the positions window. Wait for a good price to enter and wait for good profit to exit. Can't post my trades since they were done in my Zulu account. Just a ticker tape no charts there... just caught some of the drop in EURUSD

--- 帖子 #439 ---
That's great. I'm very happy for you. Keep doing exactly what you are doing right now. You are making great progess.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
I think that the repainting issue now has a benefit, take a look at the fisher which no repaints and It will give poor entry signals, I think that the so called repaint issue has in fact some benefits as It gives a faster signal, now combining this with the Heiken Ashi , it gives good entry points, the repainted fisher gives faster signals.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
interesting... will watch.. Will be moving to Journal Forum... Your input is helpful. Hope to see you there... best wishes, jiva34...

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Here is a screenshot of the trade I just took in my demo account. I entered long at 1.4627. Let's see what happens. I think price is going to start heading north.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Greeting Siuol, oh brave one... I keep the horizontal lines for bid and ask on the chart. Very often prices are a great distance from the ashi candles. The ashi are fantastic as defining the trend. But the rpices can bounce all over the place. It is a consideration for me where the horizontal lines for bid and ask are in relationship the ashi. If they are very far away I might not take the trade. So I do watch price action, just my attention is focused only on where price is right now, not where it has been in the past. So it is just the price right now and the trend... Also if the horizontal price lines are on the same side as the trend.... It is a little bit different, but what I am seeing is all that really matters is the price action right now in relationship to the trend.. Not where prices have been in all minute detail..... They have been everywhere, really.... Also the pivot points.. How prices are behaving near the pivot. Above? Below? Fisher signals can be just minor retracements. Some of the retracements can be very minor.... Not tradeable... Thank you for experimenting with this...

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Hi Jiva34, Nice thread, and a bold one I must say. Since most of the traders here are reluctant to repainting indies, you keep the thread going. I must salute you oh persistent one . I do agree that even non repainting indi cant predict the market 100%, why bother if a repainting one can't too. And if a repainting one can get you in the market earlier, why not, as long as the success rate is acceptable. Now my question, have you ever considered on trying fisher on higher timeframe, say M15 or H1?? IMHO, in higher TF there'll be less signal thus less false signal, am I making any sense?? Tx &amp; Regards,

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Thank you for input. and kind words. My goal is 5 trades, no less than 5 pips each so 25 per day.. Days 1 nad 2 have met and exceeded. BUT today is day 3, Higher time frames... Yes I consult before trading on 1m. I am trying to compensate for the repainting by referring to other indications, the ashi, pivot points, higher time frames, the relationship of the prices (horizontal lines for bid and ask) in relation to the ashi,... I am thinking that any system with candles, bars, lines or without that can give reliable information about the price in relationship the trend is tradeable. For me not having to visually process all the minute details of up and down over the past is allowing me to focus on the present. The trend accounts for the direction, isn't that basically the information we are looking for in studying all the ups and downs anyway? Where is it going and can I ride with it from this point.... But today is day 3..... best wishes jiva34

Here are the indicators presently being used and the templates. Forex Trend indi (aka Fisher is set to 55) (In mt4 settings you will need to set colors for lines, candles and bars to "none" for them not to appear on the chart.

Jiva, Good luck on day 3. Let's bag them pips!! Lohad

--- 帖子 #449 ---
this is an experimental trade win or loss I will not count it towards my daily goal. I wanted to enter short because fisher is negative although not a fresh cross, ashi is negative, trading is below s1, (a blue line not easily visible in the screen shot) and has recently tested it and fallen back down. Price action (magenta horizontal line) is below pivot point (yellow line) and has not moved very far from the last ashi candle and is just below it. If I were trading live account I would take this trade on a demo just to see...

--- 帖子 #450 ---
retracing and testing the 200 ema on 1m?

--- 帖子 #451 ---
actually I am watching price action like a hawk. I changed the bid and ask line to yellow since it is easier to see. I watch that yellow line. no candles etc, but that yellow says it all. I am thinking it is not at all necessary to have so much detail about all the minute little ups and downs, candles and bars, etc. everything is negative on the higher time frames...

--- 帖子 #452 ---
watching that yellow line

--- 帖子 #453 ---
moved stop to trail moved limit to just above s2

--- 帖子 #454 ---
breaking down the yellow line is the ask price it is not necesarily close to the ashi candle, which simply defines the trend...

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Nice trade Jiva, Nice analysis! Lohad

--- 帖子 #456 ---
the 15 min chart looks like this (watching that yellow line)the yellow brick road

--- 帖子 #457 ---
at work, phones starting to ring, can't follow the trade properly. closed early for 16 pips.. micro demo... there's more downside, can be seen on higher time frames. pretty sure s2 tgt would be hit. Will check back later after work. Best wishes jiva34

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Great Job Jiva! I only caught part of that move. Scalper at heart. Oh Well I am happy with my sliver of the pie. Again, great trade! Lohad

--- 帖子 #459 ---
It went to s2. can expect a bit of bounce here... coincides with strong support of 200 ema on 4hr. gonna take this one, counter trend (not usually a good idea.) and it will count towards my daily goal... 25pips..

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Remember Major Unemployment News coming in about 45 minutes. Could be a little sketchy. Although I will be look for an entry..... Lohad

--- 帖子 #461 ---
counter trends are tricky 4 pips and out will most likely retrace to the 200 ema not worth risking it and it could take a really long time... will check back later to see what happened.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
thanks. this is really new to me. Seeing what is going on like this and being able to see like this can disappear as mysteriously as it came. I'm thinking this trading is actually a mystical science.. Kinda overlooked stating the significant of following price action. When Siuol took the brave step this am to actually try to trade with the set up, I realized I hadn't stated how I do follow price action. The horizontal lines for bid and ask. I actually follow those lines like anything. But I am not interested in the history trail of all the ups and downs and candles and bars, etc., from the past. I watch those horizontal lines with laser vision. But I am only interested in where those lines are at the present moment in relationship to pivots and the trend as identified by ashi and fisher. The trend indis have already recorded the past and shown the direction. That is all the information a trader needs to decide what position to take. The other stuff is just like twitching... Enough to give me nervous breakdown... So far this working out. But it still is day 3. And I only have 4 pips. (not counting the first trade which was an experiment) Big moves possible today. US data out the wazzoo...

--- 帖子 #463 ---
sitting on s2. not much of a response to US data. higher time frames all indicate lower. ask (yellow line) briefly rose to test 200ema. and fell back. has already had a big run down... may get stopped out... yup stopped out enter reverse position. long... tgt intersection s1 and 200 ema on 5 min chart. 1.4583

--- 帖子 #464 ---
buy signals on 5 min logical tgt 200 ema/s1

--- 帖子 #465 ---
just took what was there, never mind fancy targets. 4 pips. total for today -14... day 3, got me nervous but it's early yet more hot US data out in hour.. will know better where everything is going after then...

--- 帖子 #466 ---
did have a little more upside to it...

I'm sure you all know by now, this trade was stopped out on the strong push downwards last night. Good thing it was a demo trade.

straying from my goal. goal is 5 trades, 5 pips each. Somehow I've become the world's foremost authority on price action in EURUSD setting these long range tgts... 3 times now just within the last few minutes the entries were good, there were 5 or more pips right there, all I had to do was click and they were mine. But oh no, I have big target set. Ya well 3 times the 5 pip winners, turned around and became 10 and 20 pip losers. stay on track!! I knew the day 3 was going to be brutal.. it is... so far -23 pips. I can turn this around if I get back on track... I will...

--- 帖子 #469 ---

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Don't sweat it. It has happened to all of us. My day is great. I only placed one trade in my live account this morning and it hit my target of 10 pips and I was out. A quick 1% growth to my account.

some day. Had 2 good days in a row. someday.. smart like you...

--- 帖子 #476 ---
You are doing great. You had two great days and one bad one. It happens. Nobody wins all the time. I think you need to determine some rules, set them in stone and just follow them. Once you get that down, you will be just fine. You have the method, now you just need to control the emotions of trading, which I hate to say, is the toughest part. Took me years to get to where I'm currently at where I have my emotions under control and have removed them from my trading.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
+21 pips, so total down for day is only -39 settings for fisher need to be changed instead of 23, needs to be longer, 55. 55 helps to identify the longer term trend. I want to meditate on putting pips in a bag. The bag will get fuller and fuller. Even 1 pip fills the bag a little more. Some pips will be worth more than others. 2 lots 1 pip is worth more than 1 lot 1 pip. 5 lots 1 pip, 10 lots 1 pip.. it adds up fast that way. But I cannot risk more than 2% of my account. So if I have $5000 I can't risk more than $100 on a trade. 1 lot each pip is worth $10. So I would have to put a stop in 10 pips.. I think I've got the math right. Tomorrow I take good money management into consideration before placing a trade. Not just the technicals on a chart. best wishes jiva34

Be aware that tomorrow is NFP and the market will be a little weird (maybe).

--- 帖子 #479 ---
question: How does different ratios for margin affect the pip cost? $10000 account at 1:500 as opposed to 1:20?

--- 帖子 #480 ---
goal is 5 pips min per trade with 5 trades.. total for day min 25 pips. Will trade the 5m. with Fisher set to 55. New demo account is $10000 no more than 2% risk on a trade means 20 pips stop per lot. Trend reversals identified by Fisher 55 reentries and exits marked by ashi with careful attention given to the position of the horizontal lines showing bid and ask in relationship to s/r, 200 ema and ashi... once a signal has been generated. best wishes jiva34

--- 帖子 #481 ---
would look to short EURUSD should fisher drop below zero line. Entry on 2nd bar after signal. Ashi candles should confirm short.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
instead of Fisher 55 turning down, ashi turned up, so went long for 2 quick trades. +8 pips stops set at 20, limit set at 20 closed early, better to take a profit when it is there.. horizontal lines for bid and ask (thin yellow line is approaching pivot point (thick yellow line) resistance..

--- 帖子 #483 ---
maybe a little late...

--- 帖子 #484 ---
may be in trouble fisher 55 on 15 is positive ashi candles are only neg by 2 bars. price maybe wants to go up to test theintersection of the pivot point and the 200ema. maybe price will drop down briefly before it does...

--- 帖子 #485 ---
little bit little adds up... +12 for the day so far..

--- 帖子 #486 ---
yesterday was a nightmare. I think Fisher indi was on the wrong setting. set at 23 all Fisher did was give the same exact signals as ashi. So what good is that? But with fisher set at 55, a longer range, it gives the 2 indicators the opportunity to show divergences. Fisher going up, ashi going down, no trade.. Fisher going up ashi turning up, continuation entry signal. Always keeping close eye on price action in relationship to s/r, pivot points and the 200ema...even when there is a signal. Checking higher and lower time frames for signals and s/r can help...

--- 帖子 #487 ---
If I am waiting for a setup which looks like it may be ready in the not too distant future and just itching to trade. There is the simulator , or maybe it should be called the pacifier... Just by taking itchy mouse fingers to the simulator can save my account from unnecessary losses. And at the same time let me practice at sharpening my skills. The simulator! The simulator! The simulator!

Way to keep at it Jiva! You are going to have days like yesterday. They just happen. Just keep doing what you are doing and hopefully the week ends profitable. Lohad

--- 帖子 #489 ---
someone has already mentioned watching fisher on the higher timeframes earlier in this thread. I prefer to trade off the daily tf using the h4 for tighter entries so I had already been noticing the significance of the fisher indi crossing zero on those timeframes. I am using fisher set at 23 on the higher timeframes (15 min and above) the signals seem quite good if you are in a clear trend. I had been going through my 4h charts looking for fisher changing colour / crossing zero. Cad Jpy looked interesting with fisher having crossed below zero on the h4, I could see I had missed a great short from 83.70, the break of an ascending trendline on the hourly chart and a perfect fisher cross below zero too. All was not lost because this morning I got a retracement and a perfect short entry using fisher on the 15 minute tf. Net 50 pips banked 82.60 - 82.00 Back on demo with fisher for the moment as I had a few small losses using the 5 min tf, hence moving back to the higher tfs. If you have the indicies charts have a look at wsfut, daxfut, uk100fut using fisher 23 on h4 and d1 tfs, there were some amazing short entries there as well, there are deffinately less false signals on the larger tfs. thanks again guys

as you always say, "Bag them pips..."

--- 帖子 #491 ---
First off, Let me thank Jiva for the idea in this system. I know what everyone is saying about repainting indicators, but the fact is, the fisher is working very well. With Jiva's permission, I am posting a picture of how I am trading the system. What is the same as the current Jiva system: I use the HA Smoothed Indicator. I use the Fisher (55) Indicator - ( I agree with this setting helps on keeping you from swimming with the sharks). What is different from the current system: I trade solely M1 (not sure if this is too different) I use a Max-NonLag MA (mainly for PA indication) I still have the candles on (trying to get the warm fuzzy to remove them) Bollinger Bands - Use this for mainly consolidation purposes. What to look for: The MOST Important thing (indi wise, PA is always king) - Watch the Fisher. If it shows short, only trade shorts. Shows long, only trade longs. The key on getting the trigger finger ready: Max-Non Lag MA crosses through the HA Smoothed indi. Shorts, MAX Non Lag has to be below, Longs the Max Non Lag has to cut through to the top of HA Smoothed. I included two live trades I actually took. One shows a bad entry - did not follow fisher, the next trade shows a valid trade, the stars line up. Got my loss back. This seems to be working for me. If you have any questions, please ask. Go bag them pips! Lohad

--- 帖子 #492 ---
am gonna watch this... anything that will help to confirm the direction of price action is worth investigating... thanks...

--- 帖子 #493 ---
great news that you are getting some benefit. I started posting because even though I am totally neophyte I thought maybe some one will benefit somehow from my struggles. I benefit from other posts. I am truly happy to hear you can use something from here. I am trading lower tf, 1m, 5m. usually. I am finding Fisher set to 55 is giving better signals (set to longer range) for short time frames. But I am making decisions based in part on the divergence if it occurs between the ashi candles and Fisher signals. Keep us posted. Thank you for sharing. Hey, when are you taking us all out to dinner?

--- 帖子 #494 ---
waiting for the turn down bumped up against pivot max is turning down when max crosses below and ashi is white and fisher is white is definite short signa. before entering short see where price is in relation to s/r 200ema. have added using max-nonlag. Lohad's suggested use is very first class. It has filled in the missing piece for my template. Max needs to cross below ashi to help confirm a short and cross above ashi to help confirm a long. am attaching max..

fisher below zero, all systems say short but prica is sitting right at strong resistance which has just become support.. a break down below r1 (maroon line) is needed.

nice looking template. max uses the default I made an update page but now ff won;t let me edit it.. Weird... am attaching max best wishes, keep us posted we're all learning together..

--- 帖子 #508 ---
have been using a Fisher that a coder has done some work on. It has an alert cross of zero and doesn't repaint as much. the coder renamed it, but it is Fisher in disguise.. am attaching, for lower time frames I am finding 55 the best setting...

That's it for the week. Done trading. Friday noon.. After the dust settled, gain was positive for the week (4 days counted) drum roll....... +46 pips Take a break. Get rested and process the week's events. Lessons learned progress made, mistakes not to be repeated (again)... best wishes jiva34

Hello Jiva, I think you have hit the jack pot with this system of yours. Soon this thread is gonna be very crowded like the Edge trade thread (unfortunate for him). Look at the EUR/USD chart. If you were just going for +5 pips you would have made at least 35 pips After NFP news today. Good Job man.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
See some more charts., wow ......!!!! How do you turn off the ALARM on the Forex Trend Farfiz. That thing is a nuisance

--- 帖子 #512 ---
OK, I found out how to turn the alarm off. Look at EU/USD, It just keeps generating pips Even after 2PM eastern. Let us see what happens next week. Have a great weekend Guys.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Way to go Jiva! What a way to end the week. Can't till it starts again! Lohad

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Hey Maxwell, Welcome to the party. Looking forward to trading with you guys next week. I am really happy with this template. I think the template is finally set (for myself, but you never know). Now I will focus on correlation on the crosses. Yes there are some things I have found in the way the Max crosses. I will try to post what I have found over the weekend. Have a good one! Lohad

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Your template looks great!! looks like you've caught up the idea.. You can run trades on the simulator just like in real time and test your skills. Finding the signals on still charts is very different from finding signals on moving price action. The simulator can help to sharpen the skill. Keep us posted. We're all learning together. Best wishes, jiav34

I have had a good week testing your indi Jiva with my existing system and results have been brilliant. I am liking h4 best with fisher set at 23, then using h1 and 15 min for entry off old supp or res then using old supp or res as profit targets. Not really had time to test lohad, max's or your setup but hope to soon. Great work guys and thankyou again jiva. Have a good weekend all.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
chuckle chuckle Crowded thread????? probably not, the system is too simple. The templates aren't crowded with 25 different indicators with all sorts of flashing lights and bells and whistles... too simple... jackpot, that would be nice, very nice....

Happy Weekend fellow Fisher Traders, As I wrote yesterday, I will try to illustrate different crosses of the Max_Non LagMA that give me a sense of confidence when it comes to making a trade with this system. This one I am showing is what I call Consolidation Max Break Out Trade. The attached screen shot show two trades, on a "trending" market (as far as M1 charts go). There are two trades on this chart. The thing I look for when in a consolidated period (illustrated by the Bollinger Bands) is how tight the Max is to the HA Smoothed. At this point I am ready for either direction. However I always reference on a M5 chart to help give me a clue (My M5 chart correlation is a completely different discussion, but helps me immensely). As the Max crosses below, it turns red, the HA Smoothed is Red and then I see the Fisher going red, with the bars on the fisher showing strengthening of a short. Boom, I am in. When the fisher, at the start of the trade is sloped down, I will make my exit be the first bar that closes on the other side of the HA Smoothed. Ok to be honest, I am a scalper, if I am +10 in a trade, I more then likely will exit at the first sign of weakness in the move. But for better traders then myself, this would be the proper exit. On the second trade, we have the same scenario. HOWEVER, the Fisher appears to be flat and bottomed. I will still take this trade. But my exit is the first time the candle closes on the other side of the Max_Non LagMA. This is usually a shorter duration trade, but still a good opportunity with high probability to bag some pips out of the market. I apologize for the length of this post. I will try to post my other examples as well. Also, with permission from Jiva, I may show how I use the M5 chart as confirmation. It also looks like you can use this the same way on higher time frames as well. Lohad

--- 帖子 #519 ---
thanks for the post and the charts lohad, I'm looking forward to having a go with your method. Having fun here with fisher and my trading sumulator, nearly doubled a 10k demo account trading to very strict rules, money management max risk 3% of account per trade. If only I could do that well on my real account. Still it is very promising because I have never traded the simulator this well before. Switched to setting 55 from 23, less false signals. This indi is well worth the effort of mastering.

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Sounds great Jag1966, I am looking forward to trading next week as well. Planning on working on the simulator this weekend as well. It's been a while since I traded with this amount of confidence. I am glad to see that this is working on simulator for you. Lohad

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Thank you for sharing your work on the positions of fisher and the correlations with price action. regular diversions like you find on macd don't seem to hold up on fisher. At least I have not had any success trying to correlate that. It seems that the last bar on fisher is always near the zero, it's like an ever fattening bell curve or series of bell curves. The end is always a tail. It's just that the middle gets fatter and taller until it finally crosses to the other side and starts another bell curve in the other direction. Will keep an eye out for Lohad's observations. Someday (soon) I want to research Mr. Fisher and get the history behind this. I'm almost afraid to, thinking it might spoil things somehow.

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Jiva, I agree with you on finding divergence with the Fisher. I look for divergence on my M5 set up and rely on it for M1 trades. If you would like I can show you the way I use my M5 chart to show me the way on how I trade your system. My M5 chart is different then your system, so I am reluctant on posting it due to the fact that I do not want to create too much distraction from this system for this system is giving me great returns in pips. Lohad

--- 帖子 #523 ---
thank you for considering the possibility of distraction by posting your system. I'm not particularly worried about that. I have picked up too much valuable stuff from your research in the past. Please feel free. We can all benefit. jiva34

Synergy (from the Greek syn-ergos , συνεργός meaning working together) is the term used to describe a situation where different entities cooperate advantageously for a final outcome. Simply defined, it means that the whole is greater than the sum of the individual parts. Although the whole will be greater than each individual part, this is not the concept of synergy. If used in a business application it means that teamwork will produce an overall better result than if each person was working toward the same goal individually. It's getting intense. I close my eyes and I see charts. I dose off to sleep and I calculate pips... While starting to dose Sat. the thought occurred to me that Fisher is a probability indicator. That is why it has to repaint. If a trader knows how to use it it is very valuable. It is not a histogram like the osma which simply shows divergence of 2 moving averages and so lags behind price action. It is a probability indicator which weights the indicator toward predicting future prices. I need to research this a little more to confirm this, but by the way it acts in live trading it sure behaves like it is calculated using a probability formula. If that is the case and I am pretty sure it is then the indicators in this system are very nicely synergized: 1.Fisher for probability (when there is more than a 50% chance of prices reversing it crosses the 0 line), 2.Combined with Max a non lag moving average indicator (showing actual price action with minimized time lag), 3.and Ashi (clearly defining the trend)... I prefer not to have candles, bars or lines tracing the past history of price action the charts. Simply by following the movements of the horizontal lines(thin yellow line and thin gray line) representing bid and ask I can make decisions. Where lohad uses bb to identify consolidation and break out, I prefer to use pivot points, s/r and the 200 ema. these all are the usual areas of consolidation and breakout and will coincide with the bb info. I was using bb but it was making my chart a little busy. I like to keep it as simple as possible. Another benefit I found from using the pivots, s/r and 200 ema is that they not only provided breakout points for entry but also targets for exiting. jag1966 also uses s/r but in the form of trend lines which are very helpful for trading the higher time frames. Am trying to find more info on Fisher indi. best wishes, jiva34

From interview with Mark Fisher (don't know if this is the same Fisher-father of our indi but good to hear anyway) http://www.allbusiness.com/personal-.../658659-1.html FM: If there is one thing your students retain, what should it be? MF: Discipline. FM: You have noted that often the most successful of your interns aren't the ones with the most impressive educational background. Why is that? MF: Because the number one qualification for me is not a high degree of education but a high degree of discipline. To be disciplined, you have to be good at decision making. Decision making is made of four steps. Collecting information, analyzing, deciding and implementing. The faster you can do those four steps the more efficient you are, the better trader you will be.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
In googling for Fisher, I never realized how many Fishers there are in trading. Where did this indi come from, who devised it? Anyone know.. Was it, Mark, Ken, Billy, Irivng? Yikes there about a zillion more Fishers.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
I could guess that this indi uses the Fisher probability calculation from physics.. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_method traders might say, why bother with all of this? I just kinda want to know.... Wouldn't be surprised if whoever put this indi together wasn't named Fisher at all... (Sherlock at work here....)

--- 帖子 #528 ---
chuckle chuckle. Anyway that was fun researching. But there are a lot of posts and threads. And yes it is the Fisher transform that the indi is based on. Using two versions of the transform is interesting. both set at 55. the bar form gives a good signal when there is a cross of 0, but the line form gives good signals when there are peaks and crosses, as well as a cross of zero. Similar to macd only much earlier and much more pronounced. Experimenting with this on the simulator produced several more good scalp trades than just the bar form alone. The indi for the line form is attached.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Monday I start placing real money trades in a micro account. It is not an mt4 broker because mt4 brokers are too slow for these scalp trades. Mt4 is web based and the servers are slow. The broker is all electronic instant fill. So I will monitor the trade on the mt4 chart but actually place it with the electronic broker. Will not be able to send lots of screen shots. But making money is what it is all about in the end. So if one or the other has to go, it's gonna be the screen shots.... will get back to the thread as much as possible. It is definitely a lifeline.. $$$$ Best wishes jiva34

--- 帖子 #530 ---
setting fisher transform (the line indi) to 200 is very interesting. significant changes in price direction really stand out. the Fisher bar indi set to 55 helps to identify the trend over the longer term and ashi shows more short term changes.

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Jiva Thanks for sharing and bringing to my attention the Fisher indicator, what a useful tool this is. My primary strategy is a hybrid Ichimoku system, and Fisher fits in perfectly. My feeling from backtesting is that: Fisher seems to provide a better lead-out than most indicators, even compared to the custom MACDs I've been using. It also appears to be less prone to fake-outs, particularly at higher period settings. The only problem with period settings that are too high is that the lead-out time becomes less effective, and exits become less accurate. I will be forward-testing (experimenting with small trades) on a 89 period setting on a real account this coming week. Let's see how it goes... Thanks again, and cheers Chngster

--- 帖子 #532 ---
JIVA Can you sum up the system? With the new indicators? Thanks

--- 帖子 #533 ---
tried to do an update page but ff won't let me edit if it gets too far back in the thread.. Here's the latest... max non lag (default) heiken ashi smoothed (deafualt) fisher (set at 55) Renamed-forex trend fxfariz by the coder.. pivot points (s/r lines) 200 ema I personally do not use candles, bars or lines on my template but prefer to watch the horizontal bid and ask lines (thin yellow and gray lines) in order to monitor price action. indis attached enter when max crosses ashi in the same direction as fisher crossing 0. watch out for pivots, s/r, and 200 ema. breakouts from these levels help confirm entries and set targets for exits. I am using the system for short scalp trades. With 20 pip stops. It's not as easy at it looks. What else is new? Fisher repaints. It is a probability indi and does not measure what happened but has a calculation in it's formula that gives a reading on the probability of what might happen. That probability changes with every bid and ask. But it is a very useful tool in connection with the other indis since it forecasts fairly accurately rather than simply reading the past. I'm not a mathematician but from what I have read this seems to be the case. best wishes jiva34

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Since fisher has a calculation in its formula for probability I would think it would fill in a missing piece in any trading system. It does repaint but that is natural for a probability indi. used with other indis it can be very helpful. Keep us posted on your findings. I don't see where 89 rather than 55 gets you into the trade sooner. using the simulator is practically speaking the same as live trading in a demo. (the expert (named- training ) can be found by clicking the paper clip at the top right of the page. zip file gives manual) best wishes jiva34

--- 帖子 #535 ---
I've enjoyed reading your posts over the weekend Jiva, very informative and helpful. I have been trading on and off for many years but only about 18 months fulltime. It never ceases to amaze me how all the different systems, methods and indis complement each other. I firmly believe no single method is right or wrong you have to try to learn / understand and test them all and go with what works best for you. Most important tho is, money management and just NEVER GIVE UP. Looking forward to a solid week testing this next week. Thanks again Jiva et al.

hello Jiva, Glad to know that you are getting lots of confidence in this system. I noticed you took 5 trades and got 5pips. Why are you taking 1-pip profits. When you loose just one trade you gonna have to win a lot more 1-pip trades just to get even.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Here is my latest entry. I notice that the EUR/USD may be a very nice pair for this system. I am also checking the others

May be I should exit here. Seems as if the entry was late. I am still working on it.

Just found out a better Fisher indicaor. The Green Fisher in the bottom does not repaint ( I guess since I am still testing. It has been said that this one does not repaint). I changed my settings on Heikenashi. The results look pretty better now

thanks for posting your research. we all learn from each other. successes and failures. support and resistance can help identify where price action is headed. Some traders use trend lines, some use pivot points, and or moving averages. I use pivot points and the 200 ema.. keep us posted. looks like you're hot on the trail. best wishes jiva34

(Note this is just an experiment it is not the system I use) funds haven't credited to the micro acct yet so... experimenting with using 2 max's 25 and 10. (max and maxine?) they really eat up the memory though, must be complicated calculations.

dancing on 200ema, Fisher negative, trading below pivot point, not shown on 1m. oops trading above pivot, ... very often price will drop back to pivot before going higher...

a view of 5m. am watching the horizontal lines that represent bid and ask rather than use candle, bars, etc..

will test this max duo out on the simulator.. trading is consolidating, looks like wants to break out to the upside out of the experiment...

can get a little more info about trend from ashi than from a max duo. the ashi candles are longer when there is more of a move...

--- 帖子 #549 ---
do want to keep template as clear and simple as possible. Everything on the chart should serve a distinct function. Sooooo, have added Fisher transform in the bottom window. 1st trade using the transform was +3 pips for a quick scalp..

--- 帖子 #550 ---
this is could be a good addition to the system. possible entry signals would look like this:

--- 帖子 #551 ---
another demo trade may have gotten in a little too early price (the thin yellow line) is butting up against 200ema, usually like to wait for a clear cross of 200ema or drop down and retest.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
quick scalp trade +7 pips total for day +10

--- 帖子 #553 ---
where can i find the green fisher that is supposed to not repaint ? best regards

--- 帖子 #554 ---
My understanding is that for an indicator like the Fisher which has a probability formula it is necessary for it to repaint. I t is not measuring something in the past that is through and done but forecasting the probability of what might happen going forward. t is different from a moving average convergence and divergence like MACD, etc. in that sense. That is why it can get a trader in earlier to a trade. To compensate for the repainting other indicators are compared. That is my understanding. If I am wrong someone please correct me. Best wishes. jive34...

--- 帖子 #555 ---
agreed the current fisher services a purpose ...many are under the impression that non-repainting means a better signal and it doesnt...remember ALL indi's following price action and price action is ALWAYS subject to change. non repainting indi's are a false security blanket. A non repainting indi will not make you a winner.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
I took this trade in an account other than mt4. learning to read the transform.. it appears that when the transform crosses 0 there is no crossing back right away and that a significant move is underway. Tgt is the 200 ema

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Here's what it looks like on the 1m

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Scalpers don't stay around for very long. I fairly certain it will reach the 200 ema and probably touch the pivot point (thick yellow line) just below. But the transform has not crossed 0 and is hovering just above, it could swing around resume the upward. So +10 pips is fine. Thank you... That makes the total today 3 trades, +20 pips.. best wishes jiva34

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Jiva Just to clarify: my objective in using a higher setting (i.e. 89 vs 55) is to help me get in later rather than earlier....it's my conservative nature. Just a quick question regarding re-painting....how many candles back from the current candle does Fisher repaint? 5? 1? Cheers, Chngster

--- 帖子 #560 ---
traders want to just hit click when a buy or sell signal appears. even robots don't do that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Robots for the most part make decisions based on very often extremely complicated formulas, comparisons and cross comparisons of data. All kinds of mathematical and probability calculations. There is no substitute for analysis!!! Indicators are there to help with the analytical process. They are NOT there to make final decisions for the trader. Don't mean to sound too pedantic... But I see this posted all the time, repaint, reshmaint... These traders do not know how to use indis, repainting ones or otherwise..... Best wishes jiva34

--- 帖子 #561 ---
that short did go to the 200 ema and now the transform has crossed 0 on the 15m. That would indicate a significant down move for the next little while at least to the pivot point (thick yellow line) there will probably be some lingering at the 200 ema (15m) and a little retracing before heading for the pivot... hi impact data out in 1 hour, So it could just sit here for an hour... Looks like the market thinks the data will be bad and the EUR will lose value against the USD. in the 4hr s1 is at 1.4522. If price goes below pivot that would be the next tgt. Just how it looks to me like things are setting up as of the present moment. My mind might have to repaint in a few minutes...

--- 帖子 #562 ---
if you study the fisher bar indi and watch you will see that fisher paints very far back. There is no telling how far back without studying the formula in meta editor. If you have studied anything at all about probability then you know about the bell curve and normal distribution. What we are seeing in fisher bar indi is not like osma or macd... It is not a typical histogram but rather Fisher is drawing probability distribution curves in bar graph form normalized to 0. As the data comes in the distribution will change. The curve will widen, flatten, etc. until the trend changes. Then a new distribution pattern begins. This is entirely different from any other indicator. It is very valuable if you can understand what it is and how to use it. It's beautiful. Absolutely beautiful and whoever put this thing together is a genius... jmho........................... It is not actually repainting ... It calculating probability....... Someone please correct me if I am wrong. But this is my understanding.... best wishes jiva34

on 1 m fisher hasn't crossed 0, hovering (This is demo trading the funds for my live account still haven't posted...) there is a big stop on this 1.4696 tgt is 1.4525 I would never actually place this trade in my live account. I scalp. I want to see how this plays out in higher times frames. So it's gonna be a while... meanwhile on to other things...

-3 pips was a good deal short was the wrong side of the trade......

--- 帖子 #571 ---
still waiting for funds to credit so can trade real account. Hopefully today??? counter trend trade. transform is very helpful to identify retracements.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
2 more trades. Tried to take a counter trend trade again. It really is silly to try to take these. Even if they are good trades they are not much of a move and the risk is huge. Highlights in green, it was a bad trade. The next trade with the trend was good. so -12 pips for bad trade +13 pips good trade. If I had not taken the counter trend trade would have been very nice. so total for today so far +3 pips. (+2 from previous trade) goal is +25 for day have a ways to go yet... These counter trend trades are suicide, Russian roulette or something, like jumping in front of a train just as it's leaving the station and seems to be slowing a little, hoping the train will stop and back up to pick up a few more passengers before heading for the next station. It's madness to try to trade this... But I see some signals on the indicators and there I go again. In front of the train. It's like I am not seeing the whole picture... The indicators can give signals but I have to see them in context... Working on it....

--- 帖子 #573 ---
okay, this was a little different from counter trend trade. the transform crossed well below 0 and all the other indicators signaled a reverse at least on the 1m. Only problem is I got in a little late. So the trade was (is still?) good. The thick maroon lines (horizontal) are pivot resistances. r1 lower and r2 upper. would expect some retracing to r2 and a further drop down to r1 if the transform stays below 0. the actual entry point for a good trade is marked with the white check mark. I got in much too late in my enthusiasm... in other words I shorted at the bottom.....

--- 帖子 #574 ---
here's what it looks like on the 5m (right chart) (1m left chart) prices (thin yellow horizontal line) are at resistance r2 (thick maroon line) the transform is sitting on 0 looking like it wants to go back up... transform would need to break below 0 and prices would need to fail at resistance for a downside move. If it is all wrong, and the trade continue up, what I would do sometimes is keep the short open but place a double order long. And wait for the next pullback to close the longs. Keep the short open and look to minimize loss as it pulls back... works a lot of the time. At best the whole thing is net profit, at worst it is a much smaller loss than stopping out. But it is the same thing all over again, trying to trade counter trend..... I'll get it, eventually!!!!

--- 帖子 #575 ---
am in trouble, but there is strong support at r1 which is also the intersection of 200 ema on the 5 min. Which means there are passengers waiting to get aboard at that location and passengers wanting to get off. Let's see if the train goes to that station...

--- 帖子 #576 ---
bid and ask are resting on the 200 ema 1m and it appears there may be more sellers aboard the train than buyers. No doubt profit taking from the big run up and momentum traders wanting to capture a move if it should go further down. next stop would be r1.. if there are enough sellers aboard... then I can get out to safety...

--- 帖子 #577 ---
1m transform crossing 0 upside? or 5m transform crossing 0 downside?

--- 帖子 #578 ---
all aboard next stop r1. if there a lot of buyers there...

--- 帖子 #579 ---
transform 1m crossing up 0? or transform 5m crossing down 0? r1 and 200 ema on 5 minutes are converging.. seems to indicate that prices will seek to meet them there...

--- 帖子 #580 ---
transform crossed 0 upside 1m but transform 5m remains below 0 waiting game

--- 帖子 #291 ---
what's interesting is that although 1m transform has significantly crossed up the 0 line transform 5m is remaining just below 0 line... which is usually what happens in a retracement. so the short term trend is down? r1 still a viable tgt after the consolidation?

--- 帖子 #292 ---
instead of a stop loss, I placed a hedge order, to offset losses of the 1 lot short should there be a breakout to the upside before dipping to r1, the buy stop is for 2 lots in place of a stop loss.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
hedged position 2 long 1 short when the there is net profit close all positions. transform on 5m eventually crossed up 0 line..

--- 帖子 #294 ---
thank goodness this is a demo... in the direction of the trend. This whole mess started out by me trying to a trade against the trend. first I entered late on a counter trend trade, as if that wasn;t bad enough I tried to avoid a loss by doubling on the break out.. basically what I have done is a double blooper, I sold short at the bottom and to try to fix it I bought double, double yet!!, at the top. Now how's that for strategy!! I'll get it. It's a kind of madness. It'll go. The system is good. This is a discipline problem. Not a strategy problem. psychological... No less important than a good system is good discipline to stay with the system. I'm just gonna leave it as it and make believe it isn't there for now. And concentrate on scalping. best wishes jiva34

--- 帖子 #295 ---
gonna leave this demo account with the super blooper in it running but open another demo. the new demo will be no different than a real account. I will try to build the value with good trades. Avoiding the dreaded counter trend. Sticking with my 5 trades, 5 pips each per day... the cat with ball of yarn needs to go out of my account.... and stay gone...

--- 帖子 #296 ---
I'm starting a new association to help with traders who have difficulty breaking their addiction to counter trend trading... It's a 6 step program. CTA 1. admitting that one cannot control one's addiction to counter trend trading 2. recognizing a greater power that can give strength; 3. examining past errors with the help of a sponsor (experienced member); 4. making amends for these errors; 5. learning to live a new life with a new code of behavior; 6. helping others that suffer from the same addiction to counter trend trading... I will read and recite these 6 steps before every trade.
