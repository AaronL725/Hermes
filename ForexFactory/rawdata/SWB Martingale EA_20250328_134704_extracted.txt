Hi All, Starting this tread to discuss the SWB EA as written by Totom Sukopratmo at the request of a few members so as not to clutter up another great thread by NanningBob. Basically this is a martingale EA. It enters trades on the 5 minute eur usd timeframe using Bollinger bands, stoch and rsi to determine entry. It is set to go 10 levels deep at 0.1 lots at 25 pips per lot. This could result in a draw down of over 5K. However it is rare for the euro to move 215 pips without some small retraces of between 10 and 25 pips and this is where the ea can make a profit. Use on eur usd only. TP is set in money and not pips, in this file it is set at 5 euro. Suggest you run it in some back tests in the 5 min timeframe and only on eur usd and see if it is a winner and if it can be enhanced in any way. And of course a big thank you to Totom for creating and sharing this ea. The code is very professional. Best regards.

Thanks for sharing. However which thread did the idea come from?

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Hi Okehiedon, Just google SWB EA and you will find its origin in the first link to come up. Best regards,

This EA is martingale, so be cautious, especially if live account. Built by Indonesian programmer/trader and it seems that it works pretty good thus far. I already had about 20 trades this Sunday/Monday and positive about 33 pips or so, but of course only w/ Martingal'ing'. Will keep you posted on success..

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Don't know if EA is opening and closing trades properly. The last trade of .02 lots shouldn't have opened .

--- 帖子 #6 ---
We need someone to adjust code to close all open trades instantly at the same price, when profit has been reached. The EA as it is now, is closing trades one at a time at each tic so you're getting each open trade closed at a different price. If price moves against you during this time, you can end up with no profit for the group of trades. Any programmers here? thanks

--- 帖子 #7 ---
how do you get this to work ? I have placed the mq4 file in my meta trader 4 expert folder but don't see it in the list when i want to ad the indicator

--- 帖子 #8 ---
To control the martingale I'm using 8 for max. trades with a multiplier of 2.0. TP set at $5. Lots starting at .05. You'll have to figure lot size for your balance. I haven't seen price go more than 20 pips past level 8 back testing (beware of back testing) 2007,2008, and half of 2009 before it turns around for a TP.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Try it again. If you put it in your expert folder, it should appear in your experts on your platform. Don't forget to close the platform and reopen it.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
i already asked this in the "nanningbob-thread", but didn't get a reply: is this ea for 5-digit broker? if not, which settings do i have to adjust? and to start it with 0.01 lots do i just need to change the lot-size?

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Hi Toothman, Thanks for checking out the ea. I have not seen anything unusual on my demo account with Ava fx so far. I will monitor it for another few days and see if anything unusual happens. Basic understanding of code but not a great coder so can't be help in that area. Aserbfx: Looking at the code in the metaeditor - the ea has a built in routine to determine if it is running on a 5 digit or four digit broker automatically so it looks like you don't have to adjust lot size or stop loss, but suggest you try it on your strategy tester first. I am running it on a 4 digit broker with lot size 0.02 and multiplier 1.5 and tp_in_money of 5, all other settings unchanged and it is doing well. If you want to go down to 0.01 lot size I suggest a tp_in_money of 2.5.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Martingale w/ x2 multiplier every 25 pips. This is a time bomb.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Back tests show it survives each of the last 10 years with the right settings.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
I'm up 60.00 after 2.5 days using .01 (ten cent) lots..... Can I ask you how you are limiting the martingale to x number of entries??

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Right click on the chart that you have EA attached to. Then under expert advisers properties I have changed level from 10 to 7. Have you had any L4 trades close yet? Did you have the same problem I mentioned above?

--- 帖子 #16 ---
.01 (several several several) .02 (many) .04 (4) .08 (2) .16 (1) .32 (1) Thanks, changed to 7 as well!

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Are you having any trades open and close for a loss during the few seconds a level 4 trade is taking profit? That's my problem. I've gotten to L4 , price reverses and hits my $5 target, trades start to close but as they're closing a trade opens and closes for a loss. It's like a flash trade that instantly closes for a loss. Programmers please help.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Hi Toothman, I have not yet seen a level 4 trade but then I changed the settings to a tp figure of 4 for a lot size of 0.02. I have now changed my settings to try to force the ea up to level 4 and higher by increasing the tp to 15 and I will see if I get any odd re-entries. I am also running it on usd cad and usd jpy - making demo pips on these currencies but the ea needs watching and turning off at certain times. Backtesting shows that there are the very occasional runs that do not reverse on these two currencies. Regards,

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Pipernet, Thanks for trying to help. The guy that originally posted this EA on this forum, said it only works well on the EUR/USD. I'm using a maximum level of 7, starting lot size of .05 on a standard account, increment of .05, all other settings stock with a balance of $37500. With these setting this EA survives each of the last 10 years on the back tester with an annual profit anywhere from $4700-$12500. Even gets through the chaos of Oct. 2008. If you come up with a remedy for the flash trade please let me know. thanks It's really strange. L1,2 and 3 trades close without the flash trade but when a L4 starts to close you get the flash trade for a loss.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hi Toothman, No issue on my end, but only had a couple.....

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Pipernet, Your TP is only 4? How is it working for you? I believe I have 30 TP and 30 SL and it is doing OK... I guess I am greedy. So far after 2 full days, I am up EUR/USD of 83.00 using .01 as my starting point for the Martingale. I can survive that to 7 levels no problem. I will try it on other currencies as I wonder if it works as well? Very interested to see your r/r ratio and how it is working for you. Lot more trades I imagine. ---ONE MORE QUESTION, WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE OR HOW DOES IT MATTER ON PROFIT BY $ OR PROFIT BY POINTS? DOES ONE OVERRIDE THE OTHER?

--- 帖子 #22 ---
I am about to try this live with a small account of 3000. Since it did well backtesting 10k with 0.1 lots, I tought 0.03 is alright with my account but I guess its too greedy ? Still trying to find a safe enough proportion, what do you guys think?

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Hi Bluemele, My tp of 4 currency units and is working well. I adjusted the lots on a demo account just to see if i could force it to run up to 4 levels, by cranking up the tp to 50 currency units, to see if it gave any unusual entires after it closed, but no re-entries happened. You have to change use_sl_and_tp to true to use it otherwise it uses tp_in_money as being the one selected. I see also you can change tp_in_money while the ea is running and it will adjust the basket to close the trades at the new tp_in_money amount, handy if you think you are too many levels deep and want to close out for position close to break even. Ray, If you are dividing the starting lot by 3 then might be useful to divide the tp figure also, try a few back tests. Great ea in backtests alright. Regards,

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Just one more thing, I brought the lower RSI figure down to 20 in the EA just to reduce entires, it keeps it out of some moves. The result is that the ea avoids entires in the turmoil of last week. See attached back test. Regards.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Hi Toothman, Ok, I agree with your observation that it makes a re-entry as it closes trades. I cranked it up on Gpb Usd to 9 levels of 3.56 lots and then watched as it retraced to close all trades at profit. However it did make a trade of 0.32 lots as it closed the all the trades - see attached chart. There is some problem in the code it seems, any coder out there that can figure out why it is placing this extra trade just at the point when it is closing all the trades at tp? Best regards &amp; thanks,

--- 帖子 #26 ---
I would do it w/ .01 for a while..... 1 month or so, then scale up!

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Ok, I think I found another bug... It looks like this morning it opened up several orders on USDCAD, EURGBP and on other all at the same time and with much more than 30 pip boundary like all my other orders... We need a programmer on this thread... Please see attached

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Well that is the first time I have seen anything like that happening. I thought an EA could only trade on the currency chart it was attached to unless the programme specified other currencies! Toothman has pm'd me and posted a new version of the EA attached below for all to try. It was modified by EcTrade to ensure that there is not a flash order created as the EA closes a basket of trades - not tested yet so I recommend trying it on demo account first, to see it there are any more odd events. Thanks to ECTRADE. Regards,

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Ok, well, I did have the USDCAD (I am testing on all pairs DEMO) and I figured out what happens I believe. 1. Order is executed when it goes outside of BB, STOCH, RSI. 2. If TP or SL is hit, then the usual business. 2B. IF TP NOR SL is hit and another setup is generated, then it moves the original order's SL &amp; TP to match the new order. .01,.02,.04,.08 For example on USDCAD this morning, I had 4 open orders that all had matching SL/TP's. I didn't understand why, but if you look at the 5M chart on USDCAD, you will find that there were 4 entries that met the criteria! Now, I could see this as a doomsday in a way as if it does this like 10 times. What do you guys think on the possibility that this could make it better or worse. It has now done it two separate times on USDCAD.... And once on another pair...

--- 帖子 #30 ---
bluemele, I haven't had EA open any trades unless EA is on that chart. The version in post#28 should end the flash trade problem but watch it carefully for awhile. It closed a level 3 for me last week with no problems.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Hey Toothman, Yes, EA is on the chart. Do you guys take it off once an order is executed so it can't have multiple orders? I am sure there is an easy way to add that to the EA (I could probably figure that out...) The challenge is, if you are on a currency and the setup occurs 5-6 times but yet keeps moving against you, the drawdown will be substantial!

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hi Everyone, How is your results? I have been doing it on 22 currencies and seeing how it goes. Pretty good, but started it over this week to imitate a demo account more closely. Still trying to hone in the right settings and pairs. http://www.mt4i.com/users/bluemele2 for my results.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Nice results, I just started to forward test it on 6 pairs. It does adjust to 5 digit brokers doesn't it? I'm using Bluemele settings, lets see how it goes...

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hi Everyone, This is a great little EA, but the only downfall i can see is that when for instance the trend is down it will still open up buy orders, it then has difficulty recouping the losses and has big drawdown. It needs another indicator to look at the trend before it opens trades! Anybody else experience the same? Mark

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Interesting EA you got here. I backtested it with real good results.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Yeah, I've notice the same thing. Maybe a moving average...

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Can you share your settings Emanuele?

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Your right! I wish i could code, this EA certainly has legs. Any coders out there willing to take a look? Mark

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Yes.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
How about Heiken Ashi set in reverse? I think it helps a little anyway. Oh, it won't work if you try it in forward.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Just a little heads up on this EA guys. Don't use the first version. It makes a flash trade for a loss as it's closing a multi-level trade. It crashes and burns on any pair I've back tested except the EUR/USD. I limit my lots and limit the levels to 7. Since this Euro story started, I've only traded in the direction of the slope of a 200 MA. I trade on a 5M chart but I look at the slope of the MA on a 1 hour chart. I think programming the EA to only trade with the slope or maybe a 5,8 cross would be a good idea. Today I thought I'd be brave and let the EA trade on the buy side today(EUR/USD) and it promptly went to 6 levels. Have gone back to only sells until things settle down. I don't know if my heart can handle this EA.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Does anyone have the original rules on which the Ea trades? I've tested it today (using the first version...) lots of trades, all counter-trend. I have the new version now. "Oh, it won't work if you try it in forward." What do you mean??? The Ea wont work on forward testing? "I think programming the EA to only trade with the slope or maybe a 5,8 cross would be a good idea." I agree. What pairs are you guys using?

--- 帖子 #43 ---
No, it has to do with the way I set up the indicator. When it gives a buy signal the EA looks to sell. When it gives a sell signal the EA looks to buy, etc. That's because, like you say, all (or most) trades are counter-trend. Now, when the indicator is setup to operate normally (in forward), the EA won't do anything at all. So in that sense it appears to act as a filter ... which, allowed me to extend the backetest another three months, up until today, where before it was crashing in early February. I more or less explain this (and how to set it up) if you follow the link.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Thanks guys, i didnt see the other thread, ill start testing it today Mark

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Only EUR/USD. EA looks to counter trade when on a 5M chart, RSI(12),Stoch.(5,3,3) reach a 30 or 70 extreme. Price also has to touch a Bol. Band(20,2,0).

--- 帖子 #46 ---
blows up! The caution w/ this EA is that it sets a distance level (default of 25) and w/ a sharp trend down it has blown up twice and lost me money. Not a lot, but it does lose. It does however quickly make it back. I would play w/ that setting if anything. Range = 25.00 (default) Seems too small... at least for the crazy days we are dealing w/ now.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
bluemele, Would be interested in your settings if you lost money and made it up quickly. Are you using a stop? I know a loss with my settings would be huge and wouldn't be made up quickly. thanks

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Yesterday I started it on IBFX and Alpari Demo accounts with default settings on EURUSD 5M and suddenly both made 9 levels!! LOL. If I imagine I will run this baby live to risk 1000USD which is minimum (with 100:1 leverage) to trade with, to make 2USD daily.. I dont know... Maybe it needs to find out proper settings for more pairs to have 1000USD profit as soon as possibile before the bad trade... Or allow trades only in the 200SMA direction would be not a bad idea...

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Heh, I tried it yesterday with IBFX demo trading up to 7 pairs at 15M TF and made a hundred bucks with original settings! And, all this time not one trade went higher than level 4. I think it's pretty cool. Of course that doesn't mean it won't blow up later but, we'll see. Oh, I was going to suggest maybe you try a different time frame?

--- 帖子 #50 ---
I wouldn't set levels any higher than 7 and it blows up on any pair I've back tested except EUR/USD over the last 10 years. Of course you need the right combination of starting lot size and balance also.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
I am in the process of backtesting this only on EurUSD as per original post. I have tweaked the RSI to 20 and also to 30. So far have only gone up to level 5 with RSI 20 and level 4 with RSI 30. This was since the beginning on the year. I am now trying from Jan 2009 if my work laptop doesn't crash. Obviously profits will be less but I am just looking for something to tick along earning a reasonable amount of profit. I will post the results

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Ive been testing this EA on various pairs and lot sizes and must say its extremely profitable, im using the latest version with default setting except for 5 as the maximum levels, it seems 0.10 lots has the best and fastest returns, see my stats here http://mstanden.mt4stats.com/ If only this was live!! Mark

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Good returns! Are you planning to go live with it?

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Ummm now thats a good question, i think a live account would need a minimum balance of 5K to give it a chance, it hasnt blown up yet, but i do keep an eye on it! I keep expecting it too! If only it traded with the trend instead of against it, i think it could be even more profitable! Mark

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Wow, that's pretty impressive! What time frame were you using?

--- 帖子 #56 ---
5m, and it seems to work on any pair too.. Im just waiting for the inevitable though!! Mark

--- 帖子 #57 ---
forgot to say, i lowered the take profit to 4.0 instead of 5.0 Mark

--- 帖子 #58 ---
I love this topic. If only one can find an indicator which overbought and oversold readings are more right than wrong and one can start martingale from there, it must be profitable. I also believe that in order to survive in this market you must add to your trade ( double up) if needs be when it goes against you. There is no other way of winning constantly than adding in some or other way. A high probability turning point of price( determined by whatever method) with a martingale ea with build in stops after a certain level MUST be profitable! I wish you luck with this ea. And lots of $ !!

--- 帖子 #59 ---
It also helps if you have lots of money in your account. That way you won't need to wager nearly as much, and still remain relatively profitable. Or, let's say you had $50,000 in your account and made $100 a day trading at 0.1 lot (on mini account). Some of us would be happier than shit!

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Hi Guys, To trade with less risk with this EA - and to survive the drawdown levels you can change the settings to the lowest risk possible: Lots amount to the minimum of 0.01 multiplier to 1.5 and tp_in_money to 1.5 Only on EurUsd 5 minute chart With the above settings 0.01 lot setting then the euro has to run for over 225 pips without a retrace of 45 pips to hit stop loss of €420. But look at the euro chart - it is extremely rare for the euro to run 225 pips without a retrace. That is not to say that it can't happen - it will happen on such occasions as an interest rate change or some other black swan event, so just be careful and use it during the day and it should make some small but steady pips. Also if you want to be really safe then change the RSI settings to figures less than 30 and greater then 70. This will keep the EA out of more trades. All the best.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Yeah, even if it went entirely to hell, it only has to retrace 25 points in order to recover everything. And that would be extremely rare for that not to happen. Oh well, I guess you kind of already said that.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
I have been experimenting with a couple of different setups. The following are all based upon a starting account of £2,000 and are backtested from the beginning of 2010 and have an initial lot size 0.01 and multiplier 2. The target in money is 1. Broker is Alpari UK Live RSI period 12 RSI 30-70 Profit £594 from 1656 trades biggest lot size 0.64 RSI period 12 RSI 25-75 account blown RSI period 12 RSI 20-80 Profit £138 from 394 trades biggest lot size 0.16 RSI period 30 RSI 20-80 Profit £4 from 12 trades biggest lot size 0.04 RSI period 30 RSI 25-75 Profit £22 from 58 trades biggest lot size 0.04 RSI period 30 RSI 30-70 Profit £91 from 252 trades biggest lot size 0.08 It would appear from these tests so far that changing the RSI period helps reduce the number of levels better than keeping it at 12 and changing the other settings to 20-80. I will look to test these for longer time period and see what I come up with. Looks good so far Cheers Paul

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Good point pipernet. I probably wouldn't trade this EA on big news stories days although it survives(on the back tester) all the news clear back to the year 2000. Actually in the last ten years using the settings I posted earlier, the worst DD occurred between 5/4 and 5/10 of this month. It went 7 levels plus another 518 pips before it turned around to TP. If you were trading with the trend (the slope of a 200MA on a 1H chart), you wouldn't have entered that trade.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Hi ewinner, what pairs are you using in the moment? Have you "kicked out" some of them during your test? Do you want to go live? Really impressive stats... Greetings, Olarion

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Hi, ive done alot of strategy testing and found the best pairs to be EURUSD, EURJPY and USDJPY, these seem to be the most consistent. If i was live i think i would use the settings posted by pipernet, they have the least risk! but hey, no risk no reward!! Still on demo for now Mark

--- 帖子 #66 ---
I trade this demo, meaning only take trades in direction of the 200 SMA on the 1 hr chart. Works like a charm so far. Could a coder add this SMA filter to the EA? Also a "trade only between ie. 8.00 to 18.00 GMT" filter would be awesome. Thanks to all for this EA and the work on improving it... BR PC PS : I trade it on the 5 min as usual

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Now that would be awesome!

--- 帖子 #68 ---
So, is anyone using version 4.1.0.6? This is the one that automatically adjusts and sets TP whenever a new level is reached, although it doesn't appear to be that accurate .. slippage when setting the TP's? (i.e., it was a lot more consistent when backtesting). I'm just curious. Am also in the process of updating it so each level is multiplied by a certain percentage (currently 10 %) of the target price. So, if the target is set at $10.00, the first level will close at $1.00, the second level will close at $2.00, the third level will close at $3.00, etc. This way I expect it might reduce some of the risk. If anyone is interested I can post a copy of this.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Yeah, ive been using your latest version since you posted it, but im using the TP in money, set to 4.0 Looking forward to your update Thanks Mark

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hey, that's good to know. Thanks. I'm using the same version too, and so far I've been pretty happy with it.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Hey, if anyone can point me to an EA that this code incorporated, I could probably do it. I just haven't worked much with indicators and setting up EA's to operate at specific times. If anyone has any ideas they can send me a PM. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Ill take a look through my graveyard of EA's and see if i can find anything of use. Thanks for taking the time Mark

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Thats the one I use too BR PC

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Look at this thread : http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=231650 the Ver 7 EAs on post 1 have the only trade in direction of 197 SMA function (must be easy to change to 200) Also it trades only when 197 SMA and 10 SMA agree (1 hr chart), but I think we only need the 200 SMA confirmation.... BR PC

--- 帖子 #75 ---
no risk no reward, lmao!

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Try some of Steve Hopwoods EA's for trading times. I have attached his 2ma macd.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
EC, When EA closes trades, will it only close the trades that it's opened or will it close all open trades even those opened manually? I'd like to trade manually along side this EA but don't want those trades closed by the EA. thanks

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Hey, thanks guys. Unfortunately I'm in the middle of trying to get an update ready and have run into a couple of snags. It might be a little awhile. Probably within the next day or two though.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
That, I'm not sure about? The way it was coded is completely different from the way I do it so, it's hard to tell. I suspect it's based upon the magic number order symbol but, I'm not entirely sure. However, the fact that I have several charts open with orders opening and closing all the time, yet specific to each chart, would suggest this is the case. Of course there's one way to actually find out. Try opening a couple of orders manually and see what happens. That's what I would have to do if I wanted to verify it.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Hi ewinner, I just checked your current stats. What multipliers do you use? I saw that your lots are 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5... Why and how do you make these settings?? Thanks and greetings, Olarion

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Hi Olarion, Im using 1.5 now, ive been changing it to see how it effects the overall performance. 1.5 is definitely safer but, it just went 4 levels deep!! but still came out the other side in profit, times like that you have to walk away!! I can see how this could blow your account at any time. It definitely needs a filter to trade with the trend to turn a buy into a sell. Apart from that im very impressed, as you can see from my stats it is quite profitable. $1182 in profit since the 4th May 2010 Play with it on demo and you'll see Mark

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Wow, what a ride today. I had EA set to only sell so when the EUR/USD went north today, it was off to the races. I saw a level 4 and a level 5 but the EA handled the more than 200 pip( in less than an hour and a half) move pretty well. I was trading a starting .05 lots and ended up with $48.50 for the run.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Your not wrong there, what a ride!! had the same thing on EURJPY, came out the other side though in profit! Don't think my nerves would have held up if i was on a live account! Great EA! Heres my EURUSD

--- 帖子 #84 ---
SL = 60 Hasn't hit it yet because when it hits the "25 range" it adds a new order and moves the SL up/down another 60 pips. Unless your stop is smaller than the range, I don't see how it could hit your SL? I have had multiple accounts now, playing w/ settings, starting over. This EA has legs, but it can be dangerous. I think where you would get hurt is multiple currencies that run alike. Plus the range seems to be small in times like this. I think 30 would be better, but then that screws up the 30 TP and calc on the martingale. Playing with it now, but this is a good EA. I wouldn't put another filter on this as it already has a good one in my opinion. The key is to survive 10 levels as it has hit 7 levels, 5 different times now! It is roughly 1K down on 7 levels starting at .01 lots (10 cent lots). I am going live with 1k next week most likely using penny lots on FXOPEN. We will see how it does and I won't keep resetting my account.. THis thing can make money though. Kind of like Blessings-3 EA

--- 帖子 #85 ---
You will get higher levels.... What is your "Range" setting?

--- 帖子 #86 ---
I had default settings, hit level 7 on EURUSD on forex.com last night. Missed my TP by 2 pips! Damn spreads ! My advice is run this on IAMFX or some other really low ECN Broker.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
If you traded w/ the trend, then you would be trading a trending EA... This is a counter-trending EA. That is WHY it is profitable. If you trade multiple currencies, your chances of blowing up are less likely in my opinion. Also, trade pennies, then you don't need a 5k account.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Hi there I have set up a new test, 50.000 Account : Pairs : EU GU EJ UJ Settings : levels 6 0.5 lot TP 100 USD Step 30 http://www.mt4i.com/users/pipcruiser I will manually check trade direction according to only trade with the 200 SMA (1HR) trend. (until a gentle coder makes it automated ) I have it running on a VPS 24/7. BR PC

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Range setting? What's that, the TP level? No, like I said, I had everything set to original settings. The range says 25 by the way.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
I finally got it updated! ... version 4.1.0.7 As for adding SMA filter and setting trading time, I will look into this over the weekend. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Thats awesome! Regarding the 200 SMA filter, my suggestion that it checks for trade direction every midnight GMT on the 1 HR TF. BR PC As for adding SMA filter and setting trading time, I will look into this over the weekend. Thanks. [/quote]

Hey sorry for me coming with ideas all the time, but I think the following would be a good function also : Emergency Close All : true/false Max loss in % : 25 Meaning, if the account goes to minus ie 25% the EA will close all orders and not trade until re-started. By having this function, one can easily limit its max risk in total.... Just trying to optimize risk control here as it might be hard to calculate total risk exposion when trading many pairs etc... BR PC

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Yes, it's already in the works ... works across all charts or, each chart individually. Also includes global profit target that works across all charts. Yes, looks like a good function. Have incorporated something similar with manual/emergency Close All feature, that suspends all trading until it's reset. In fact I've done most of the coding already. Now all I have to do is get it to work. Definitely! This is what happened to me the last time I got into trouble. Oh, I just calculated how big lot size will get at 10th level when starting out at .01 lots: 1) .01 , 2) .02, 3) .04, 4) .08, 5) .16, 6) .32, 7) .64, 8) 1.28, 9) 2.56, 10) 5.12 ... so everybody watch out!

Don't you mean to say "more likely"

--- 帖子 #96 ---
My advice is don't go higher than 7 levels with the right balance and starting lot size. There is a lot of room after the 7th level for price to run without blowing your account. In the past(on the tester) price usually turns around soon after the 7th level with the E/U. On a few occasions in the last 10 years it did take about a week to TP. Once it ran over 500 pips past L7. That would have been an account blower using a max. level of 8.

Ec, It's great having you on this thread with your ability to code. Don't know if adding this filter is necessary in my opinion but that's up to you. The slope of the 1HR 200SMA doesn't change that quickly so it's easy to just flip to the 1HR chart each day to check it. Then set EA to only go long or only go short according to the slope.

Hi All, Great little EA guys, slowly bringing in the pips, It might also be useful to test after adjusting the settings to nanningbob's 1hour 60x90 strategy (change range to 90 and run on 1 hour chart) as the use of RSI and Stoch could keep us out of certain trades and all we need is a retrace to whatever TP is set. Thanks to Toothman &amp; Ectrade for all the contributions. All the best.

I saw a very interesting post on another forum. Similar concept w/ EA, and a guy recommended making the "RANGE" dynamic. In my opinion, Range is THE biggest determinant of success because if it is too small to handle the run, then too many levels get executed etc.. If we could code it to make the range a dynamic % maybe even reflect the increment then I believe it would run much more smooth. Example: Range = 1.5 (150%) First Range Level = 20 2nd Range Level = 30 3rd Range Level = 45 4th Range Level = (45+22.5) = 68 5th Range Level = (68 *1.5) = 102 .... I don't believe we would want to use 150% now that I think about it as profit would be substantially lower, however I believe this would definitely reduce risk more than any other factor. Or, maybe increment first 3 levels at a %, then 2nd 3 levels @ % etc.. Too complicated in my opinion. KISS. Another thought is to make it ATR based as that is the ultimate reality of current price action. However, when a trend changes hard, it doesn't matter what price was 14 bars back etc.. I guess I am not a fan of MA's as filters as they are only price action delayed... --EDIT: Just thought about it, and this would increase our risk if our stop gets moved with it! I think sometimes we are rebuilding blessings 3...

--- 帖子 #101 ---
hmmm. I guess it depends. It depends on how correlated pairs are. I believe the more you spread it out, the better. Also, you have to accommodate for more $ if you are trading more pairs... That is what I believe. I have known to be wrong 70% of the time, but when I am right, I am right!

--- 帖子 #102 ---
newbie alert so this maybe a stupid idea instead of martingale would it be possible to use another less agressive progressive betting system called the labouchere betting system and i copy paste an explanation. ' unlike the Martingale which is straught forward in nature. You first write down a line of numbers that could be anything within reason. A popular aggressive line would be 1-2-3-4. Let us say that you are betting in dollars. The first bet would be the first and last numbers in that line so 1+4 = $5 and so the bet is $5. If that bet wins then the first and last numbers are cancelled out. This then leaves the 2 and the 3 remaining. This then means that the second bet would also be $5 (2+3). If that bet wins also then the line is cleared and a new line starts with the player being $10 ahead. We then have to explain what happens if a bet loses. In the 1-2-3-4 sequence, if that $5 initial bet loses then the number 5 is added to the line to make 1-2-3-4-5, the next bet is $6 (5+1)…..if that loses then the 6 is added to the line to make 1-2-3-4-5-6 and then next bet is $7. If that wins then the 1 and 7 are cancelled leaving a line of 2-3-4-5 and the next bet is also $7 (2+5) ' No need to start with 1234 though, if you just start with 1 and if it loses write another 1 next to it. Your next bet is 2. If that loses you add a 2 to the line to get 112 and your next bet is 3 (the sum of the outside numbers) If that wins you are back to 1. if it loses you add a 3 to the line now 1123 and your next bet is 4 (the sum of the outside numbers) - etc etc etc - It clearly takes longer to recoup the losses than martingale but would be safer ? I was running the ea on the tester using 0.01 micro lot. and set to level 7 which blew up on 4 feb 2010 - using this strategy instead of 64 microlots on level 7 it would only have 8 microlots in play ? i think dont know if it would work with forex or can be programmed just my 2 cents, a friend of mine went from £10 to £1500 betting on red before he lost it

Does it matter which TF you running this EA? If I run it on 5M do I get different results from 1H? Thanx

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Testing 2008 with 7 levels,starting lots.01, EA makes a trade in july that never comes back. Better known as the death trade. It looks like an 8th level would have TP'd but 8 levels will blow your account in other years.

I don't want to be the party pooper , but its not that rare to have a run up to -400 pips without 10 pips retractment. I am attaching a chart of Renko of box size = 10 pips to judge yourself why people say the EA sucks in 2010. http://i47.tinypic.com/2uf90lj.gif

This is in reference to create the perfect, never blowing up martingale system. I believe that no matter what it is going to blow up. NO MATTER WHAT. I ran it for a week and kaboom on 3 different currencies at 3 different times. I see too many traders thinking that 'no losing' is an option. You are always going to have losses. Please move on from that! The key is how you manage the martingale system while taking money off the table and also limiting your exposure. It blew up 3 times, but I was still ahead for the week! It isn't a matter of when it blows up, it is a matter of how often. Maybe I am being overly critical of comments, but I don't want to fool anyone that this is anything other than 'betting/gambling' and that you are taking huge risks with this capital. A risk that says, "I am willing to part with you forever Mr. Money". Having said that, this is a good system and can make money in my opinion. The key again is taking money off the table, limiting your exposure to something you can afford to lose and if that is 7 levels, 10 levels, whatever levels at whatever price (pip/$) then that is where you need to be.. Blessings 3 has handled all the questions and more and I believe your time would be better spent on that EA if that is the case, but some people like being in the construction business.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
I am confused. You are showing us a graph of RENKO that shows NO RETRACEMENT OF 10 PIPS FROM 7 MAY 2010--&gt; 20 MAY 2010 I want to be clear on that is what I am looking at because my charts are completely different than yours. My renko charts on Ninja Trader are different than yours as well... Hmmm. Very confused. I have never seen a 400 pip move w/o a 10 pip retracement. I guess I am not agreeing w/ your photo and results without further investigation? 1. Maybe FXDD loves ripping you off? 2. Maybe your RENKO charts are not accurate? 3. Maybe my visual review of metatrader and my attached Ninja Chart is completely wrong? Very interested to see how you got that chart?

--- 帖子 #110 ---
I also want to point out that if your SWB is getting in on the pivot at the top for a long, then you have the wrong settings or wrong EA. Getting to 30 pips is a bit harder than 10 and you are right, it can have a substantial run for this. I see plenty of those especially in the last 2 weeks. I think a smart man would not have this SWB running on such 'news-driven' events. And, you would be running it on multiple currencies to counter the bad trades. I had 3 blow-ups thus far, but somehow still profitable.. It is because I limit to 7 levels and I have it on 6-8 different currencies that are not too highly correlated except eurusd and usdchf. I believe like other EA's, if you make the range dynamic, then you have something... Like nanningbob's latest EA along w/ blessing's 3, among others.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Renko charts has no time axis. The 10 pips box can be formed in 2 minutes or 1 hour so ignore the date. Thats a 10 pips box Renko livechart 2.1 I didnt draw the boxes. edit: I have a 420 pips gap at 13 March 2010. But of course you stop it on fridays. But still I can see many long runs of 10 pips boxes. But the point is , the EA takes the trade after many boxes so we are still safe. Can you make an option that the EA takes the trade after min. number of renko boxes? To save up some levels and increase probability of retractment?

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Hey blue, Interesting that you have had three blow ups and still profitable. Can you tell us how you pulled that off. You mentioned "taking money off the table at the right time. Can you discuss how you did that. Can you list the exact settings(all of them) you're using. And can you list the pairs you are trading. thanks much

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Toothman, Great questions. Honestly, I 'nixed' a few of the currencies that were 'scaring me' and/or blew up. I had several that were getting close to blowing up and you know those currencies that 'range' very high without breakouts or have huge spreads . I blew up w/ GBPAUD, EURUSD, and I can't recall the other one as it was earlier on and I changed over my account. I believe it was EURCHF if I am not mistaken which is not a good pair to trade this in my opinion. I am currently trading: AUDUSD, EURGBP, EURJPY, EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDCAD, USDCHF, USDJPY. (GBPJPY spreads are not good on my previous broker, plus a big move is very easy to get on that currency as you know) Now, I was trading 22 pairs, they all worked out well, but w/ 22 pairs testing, it is obvious that there is too much correlation between most of the pairs so I just minimized the count so I didn't have to have as much capital in that account. Plus, FXOPEN and IAMFX both have these currencies for cheap. I had two blow-ups on forex.com due to it missing my TP by like 1-2 pips or just entering me by 1 pip due to LARGE spreads. This will not work on large spread pairs, so you can eliminate most currencies there. Plus, I suggest getting low spread ECN because one pip will kill you! When I get my testing completed, I will share my fxopen info like you guys have and all that. Still squaring away my live accounts as I have moved brokers... My settings are pretty much default and I have not optimized them as I have been so busy w/ blessings 3, nanningbob, epsilon megastar, SZBO, 2 MACD Steve Hopwood, Simple London Breakout, POWERSM, SSS, Scalpel, Stoch MACD, 10 Pt per day etc... In my opinion, here are my ratings of the EA's thus far: 1. Nanningbob's 4HR EA by Zurathrista (sp?) (one w/ stop gap orders) (Martingale) 2. Blessings 3 (Martingale) 3. SWB (Martingale) 4. 2 MACD 5. SZBO 6. Simple London Breakout (Martingale) The rest still need a bit of work and a lot more testing. Too many huge swings. POWERSM seems like a waste of time thus far. Hope this helps. To new experimenter's reading this post, please don't email me about other systems or whatever. I don't have time to talk about them all, but hopefully you find them interesting!

--- 帖子 #114 ---
I agree. My platform shows lots of retracements between May 7th and May 20th of this year. EA would have survived this period without a sweat. There are going to be account blowing trades however like the one in July of 2008. That's why I'm so interested in your settings bluemele. How are you blowing accounts and still being profitable?

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Hi BRB, Yes, thank you for enlightening me on RENKO. My comment was mainly that my charts don't match up with yours regardless of 'time'. I was verifying that this was indeed 2010 that we were discussing as I just couldn't figure out what was going on. It sounds like you figured out something there though. I don't stop my trading on Fridays (my Friday in USA timezone). You are right w/ it being 'rough' as the runs were substantial. I do believe you have to stay in the game all days 24/5 and/or you will miss your retracement! I don't think retracements discreminate against days of week.. haha, but obviously, longer trends tend to happen during TUE/WED/THUR mornings for most pairs (GMT time) so that may be a time that you scale back some. It seems to me, that these are good times to test EA's like this due to the uncertainty of the forex market conditions etc.. GREECE, PIGS, etc... Only invest money you are willing to send towards your FX Masters Degree! Soon we will all have PHD's... Good luck!

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Wow, these are the same ones I'm trading, except mine also includes AUDJPY and EURCHF. Of course these are most of the majors or, at least the ones with the lowest spreads with my broker.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Thanks Blue. First I am not here to criticize the system negatively. Because I like martingale systems. I was just warning you that 17 march a big gap happened that may blow an account and The EA won't be able to intervene. The EU is famous for sunday big gaps. So in my humble opinion ,leaving a trades open before market close is dangerous.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Oh well, I'm beginning to think using this EA is not such a good idea. I still have a couple of ideas though. One is similar to the global kill switch I'm attempting to add, that automatically closes and suspends all trading at set minus point of equity. And here, I'm thinking of a stop loss that does basically the same thing, except you can set it to close out much sooner, and have it automatically resume trading without having to reset it manually. It's probably just a matter of adding the option to where it resumes trading automatically. Also, need to find a way to close everything down lickity split. I have an idea about that too.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Simple. How often does the account blow up? How many levels does it blow up? How much in dollars would that be? How quickly would it take the EA to recover those losses? (depends on when!) etc... I had it set up for about 8-9 pairs at the time, all doing well, making lots of money after 3 days (1500.00 or so) and then I had two blow up exactly at the same time -2000.00 roughly and in that time, I also had profits from the others as the markets were moving hard to recover additional 500.00.... I was surprised as well. Maybe I am not that smart, but I think that the chances that it blows up 10 times in a row is probably not likely. However, there is always room for Equity Protection and other safeguards! If you are going 15 levels and Mutliple of 2.0 +, then it would be the same as what I have if you have that deep of an account. Me, not so much. I trade w/ 2-3k per account, Nano or micro and am basically break-even on all the systems I have been playing around with. I suggest forward testing live on nano for a few weeks to get a feel for it. Shouldn't cost a whole lot to do so, and you can always use MPTM for global EP. (WARNING: You are reading a post from someone who has lost 60K since Oct 2009 in FX from previous 'systems').

I posted my settings a few posts back. Interesting. Well, I guess it all comes down to spreads . It all happened about 23:35 5/23/10 GMT seems like I am undergoing another one! Gotta love it. Only 4 levels, headed to 5 soon on USDCAD and EURUSD Seems like EURUSD is the biggest risk lately. It has kept me much higher than all my others.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
I blew up twice last night. EURUSD/USDCAD... I was just missing TP's... and kaboom. EURUSD has now blown up 3 times. I am almost back at my start from 3 days ago on this demo account. Still down 15% though. Pretty interesting as I think the range needs to be larger or dynamic in some way.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Someone earlier in the thread suggested using this on the 1hr chart and changing the range to 90 to reeflect nanningbobs thread. I tried this and the profits were okay but it also got me thinking about the range value and chart time. I am currently testing the following with good results so far. 5min chart range 5 lot size 0.01 increment 1.5 tp in money 1 max level 10 Cautious I know but I am about half way through a backtest on EURUSD since Jan 2007. I am using a 1,000 balance and have hit level 10 6 times. Mind you level 10 on these setting is 0.62 which looks sustainable. Profit to the end of may 2009 so far is 1,474. I know the profit isn't huge but I am looking to build slowly and even if it generates 40 to 50 a month it will pay for my vps whilst I try out other trading techniques. Just another thought (I haven't tried this out yet so it may be a rubbish idea) but could we look to hedge the trade from a particular level to help stop blowing accounts? Paul

Well, after two blow-ups the other day on 5M chart w/ range of 25, it is already back at pretty much where the account started. Had I taken it out to 10 levels, I would have been successful, but 30 pips @ 10 levels on anything other than a micro account intimidates me! haha Seems recovery is quite quick. So, I think it is a matter of how the market is moving. So, I believe that there may be times where this needs to be shut off. I wonder if putting in stop orders with a gap of say 5 pips would make any difference. If the market is rushing down, then it would make the difference I think in entering. I think the logic would be something like this: Fast moving market (no retraces) are the big problem, so... When Range is hit, add stop order (in proper direction) 5 pips away from current pricing. So, if you wanted a true 25 range, you would put range to 30, and stop gap 5 and that would enter you at 25. Then, add an expiration: IF current price is greater/lower than pending order X by NEXT RANGE (30 pips), THEN cancel/move pending order to current price + stop gap (5 pips) L1 entry is put in at 1.30 L2 Pending order is put in at 1.05 when price is at 1.00 L2 Pending order is moved to .75 IF not executed when price reaches .7 This, plus the ability to cancel pending orders without cancelling the chain is similar to NB's EA. This would be great I think. But, now I am left wondering, why not just put NB's EA on 5 min... hmmm.

Bluemele http://www.myfxbook.com/members/pc8m...u-max-ocm/4439 Look at this guy martingale systems. He goes up to 120 lots! In order to have a big chance to win , you either provide a big capital and don't limit levels. Or you can try with IBFX nano account and start with nano lots. 0.1 micro lots. If you limit the levels , 1 loss will erase 5 wins. Just my 2 cents.

Hey, I hope you guys didn't think I was holding out on you. I've been working on this fix since last Thursday, and had a reasonable facsimile working on Tuesday, before my computer hosed up and I had to do a system restore. And, in the process (not because of system restore specifically) I lost my work. So, I've spent the last couple of days reconstructing and trying to configure. Anyway, I think I have a reasonable copy working now, although it's still a bit buggy. Local-1 and Global-5 Options / Closeall &amp; Suspend, Suspend-No Close, Reset-Suspend The first three options show up at the top of the properties box, and you have the option of selecting 1 or 5. If you select 1 it performs the operations locally. If you select 5 it performs the operations globally (for multiple charts). If you are performing an operation locally (either Closeall &amp; Suspend or Suspend-No Close) and wish to reset it, enter a 0 or 1 in Reset-Suspend. If you are performing it globally, you will need to enter 5. Closeall &amp; Suspend If you select Closeall &amp; Suspend, it does just that, closes all trades and suspends trading until it is reset. It also displays status, either local or global, in comments field, as well as status in Suspend Trade field. Suspend-No Close This will suspend all trading (either locally or globally) without closing any orders. Global Stoploss, Global Kill Switch and Closeall by Price These three options are similar and the first two (Global Stoploss and Global Kill Switch) are basically incorporated as one. Global Stoploss To use this, you have to set percentage to greater than 0 (.01, .25, etc.) and enable it by setting Global_Stoploss_Enable to true . It sets global stoploss at whatever percentage of AccountEquity() and resumes trading (without reset) once it is performed. Global Kill Switch This is nearly the same as Global Stoploss, except you generally set it to higher percentage (keeps from blowing account) and it doesn't reset automatically. To enable it, set Global_Kill_No_Reset to true . It's set to Global_Stoploss by default . It will also display "SL" or "KS" depending on which option you choose. Closeall by Price This is also similar except it serves as Global TakeProfit. To use it set Closeall_Target_Price to greater than 0 (above AccountEquity()) and set Closeall_Target_Enable to true . This is still a bit buggy though, so I can't guarantee it will work. I'm not sure about Kill Switch either, because I haven't had a chance to test it. It's more straight forward in coding though, so there's a better chance it will. Closeall Variable This is at end of comments field and should say either 0, 1 , 2, 3 or "S." 0 means Closeall Global is reset and trading resumed. 1 means manual closeall has been selected, 2 means Kill Switch is selected and hit target, 3 means Close by Price is selected and hit target. If it says "S," it means suspend-no close. Closeall Test Oh yea, if Global Closeall says 4, that means test option is enabled and just hit target. Unfortunately (although it was working the other day) the Closeall Test is currently not working. If you have any questions or, bugs to report, please let me know, okay? Thanks. ETA: Modified to set mini_account_enable to false.

Thanks ecTrade I will load this up tonight and play with the settings. As you may see in my earlier posts I have been running a variety of back tests. Currently running one from 2001 - this is nearly killing my machine as it has been going for over 24 hrs. Anyway with the settings I am using at present I have only hit level 10 (0.62 lot) ten times since 2001. This got me thinking and although I am in work at the moment I will explore this more in my test results tonight. Would it be possible to have a setting that closed all trades at a certain level, say level 7 or 8 and then restart trading at level 1 again immediately. I will look over my results tonight to see how often these levels have been hit. My thoughts are that whilst this will reduce the overall profitablility if they do not occur too frequently it will add considerable protection to the account. I would appreciate your thoughts on this. Cheers Paul

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Ok, here are my stats.. I started over w/ a smaller account on DEMO 2,000.00 using Micro's about a week ago. Here is my stats thus far: http://www.mt4i.com/users/bluemele2 I think the key here is that this thing makes up its losses quite well. Also, if you can do 10 levels, then I do believe you are pretty safe, however, it would wipe out like 75% of your account +. So, I would do nano and give it a go and see. I started this, went up to like 2300.00, then shot down to 1600.00 (USDCAD, EURUSD) and now up to almost 2700.00! Last demo started with 10K, closed it at 11K in one week. Lessons I have learned thus far: 1. More than 7 levels are required if you do not want to lose 2. It has missed my TP by 1 pip like 30 Million times. Forex.com spreads suck! I would run this on ECN, but finding a nano ECN is challenging. 3. EURUSD sucks. It trends too good! 4. Stay out of hard trending market times if possible. I have had 80% of my losses (4/5) during London Open. Only one came during Japan trading time. Enjoy!

Bluemele. Is it possible to run it on several currencies , but limit it to 1 cycle at a time? I mean if there is a trade chance on EU and there is open trades for GU , the EA just won't take it. I'll open a NANO account for this EA one day and I'll make unlimited levels. But remember to spread the money , when you make too many wins transfere the profit from broker to another and continue there.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
I think the more currencies the better your odds... However, if they are all correlated, then obviously not good. Depends on how correlated they are.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Ok, I started backtesting again just to compare currency pairs... So far I can't get the Martingale to work? Any suggestions? It just sits at .01... Just doing that though, I can go through and see how many wins/losses they have and EUR/USD is terrible.... --EDIT: USDJPY works for some reason but only to 6 levels...??? --EDIT: EURUSD works up to 7 levels (which is what I had)....

Hi Brb, Attached is original Blessing system pdf. The Blessing EA that is being developed on forex-tsd don't use hedging.

Yes I know Blessing and I read all the thread on TSD. I am waiting for version 4. But I think it uses hedging.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
I'm still looking for a way to make version 2 work without giving you a heart attack every couple days. Look at this idea and tell me what you think. Turn off the stoch.and Bol. B. filters and only look at the RSI (12). Turn EA on only when you see divergence confirmed with the next candle. It's not going to make you as much money unless you increase your lots but that's more risk. But I think your going to get a much higher % of trades that TP on level 1. You might have to make an adjustment to the RSI levels to get EA to kick in when you see a set up. If only divergence could be coded into an EA. If RonaldRaygun says it can't be done, then it probably can't be done.

I think in Ninjatrader there is a divergence indicator with alarms... So, I think it can be done. I believe anything can be done, but it is a matter of how much freakin brainpower can one give to such a task! Good idea... This does give you a heart attack... I have been experimenting quite a bit, but for some reason backtesting has been fruitless due to errors (most likely on my part) and changing one little thing makes it go haywire. I think I will stick w/ 30/30 SL/TP and see what happens. Take EURUSD out of the mix or any other trending pairs and mix it up w/ less correlation and voila... maybe profitable. I am profitable currently! Up 600.00 on one week even after two 7 level losses in one night! I have a 2.0 set on the multiplier so that is why! --EDIT: PLUS, ALL MY LOSSES EXCEPT ONE HAVE BEEN DURING LONDON OPEN PERIOD.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Yah, I am on there too... Read it, love it thus far, been playing with it for a couple weeks, but just now getting into it a lot. Why wait for 4??? Does it land on the moon on version 4? haha No problem w/ this EA... Love it, but boy is it risky! Look at the link I posted earlier and click on 'risk'. Chance of losing 90% of account... quite high compared to blessing, NanningBob... I am also playing a lot w/ POWERSM as well which I find entertaining, but in the end, I am not sure many people have the cajones to actually go live (in a real tradinga account with more than nano) with one of these. Backtesting does look good! Especially when you limit to 5.00 profit, but when I do 4.00 profit, it blows up, 6.00 blows up...hmmmmm..... Makes me think that is scary.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
For another answer, more clear... I probably don't have your settings. Why don't you post your backtest results w/ set file so we can hone in on what works.... I will do that if I find something interesting. So far, default settings on backtests are the best.... but, for some reason, my "USE SL/TP" with 30 set on each is making me more return but w/ higher drawdown. I think once we get through this 'emotional' levels in the markets it can make a lot of money, however, there will be 'news weeks' again that will crush it like a little juicy bug. The key is did you pull money out in time and replaced your basis with profit so you lose only your profit... EDIT: THE TURTLE TRADERS LIVED WITH UP TO 80% DRAWDOWN WHEN THEY TRADED... COULD YOU DO THAT... SOME OF US HAVE NO CHOICE...HAHA

--- 帖子 #148 ---
I have back tested it ALOT . That is my general settings 1-Works bad on EU and GU , because these are the most prone pairs to the "Black swane" events. 2-Works perfect on A/U 3- RSI 75/25 4- Start lot is either 0.01 or 0.02 5-Multiplier 1.5 6-TP 5 So I don't set SL or TP and most important don't limit levels , you either go big or go zero , limiting the levels is a bad idea. Also I'd never go live on CHF or JPY pairs , because if one these two banks decided to intervene , then good night sweet prince to your account.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
blue, RonaldR. says EA won't know which peaks or valleys to base divergence on. I'll look for that indicator you mentioned . It seems like something should be able to be coded if an indicator can spot divergence. thanks

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Yes, I don't think it is easy. Go to Ninja forums and indicators and under alphabetical 'divergence' or something or rather. It might be under a different name. I use divergence substantially w/ bollinger bands and MACD's when trading TF/ES futures. One of my main ways of trading. It is easy to spot by eye, but tough to program and/or implement in a strategy I think? Good luck..

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Ok.. On Memorial Day weekend, I am backtesting... hmmm Anyways, here is my best data that I have thus far that works on the following pairs w/o loss really: audusd eurgbp eurjpy eurusd gbpusd usdcad usdchf usdjpy I found that the longer timeframes are the best for some reason. Safer if using 7 levels etc... But, I would probably only go to 6 and these settings seem to work w/ 6. Inserted Code extern bool use_daily_target=false; extern double daily_target=100; extern bool trade_in_fri=true; extern int magic=1; extern double start_lot=0.02; extern double range=200.0; //100 extern int level=7; extern bool lot_multiplier=true; extern double multiplier=2; extern double increament=0.01; extern bool use_sl_and_tp=true; extern double sl=600; //240 extern double tp=240; //120 extern double tp_in_money=5000.00; --rest is default It is now like NB 4HR system.... My old settings of 30/30 tp/sl w/ 25 range blows up but is still profitable in my opinion, but I don't know if my heart could take it live. -- I think to make this a better system, you have to use pending orders w/ gap entry as % of bars. Limit your trading times (stay out of London and NY opens if you could somehow). --I think the Blessings system is this on roids', so I think I am going to abandon this one to focus on that and the NB systems as I think they are a bit less risky and more stable with the programming in them already that I need. Good luck to you guys and hope you make lots of pips! Hope this helps anyone.

Thanks Brb, I saw that when I did an internet search but it looks like you have to pay to subscribe to that forum in order to download that EA. ???

--- 帖子 #155 ---
What, for the Blessing EA? No, all you have to do is register ... or, what they call "subscribe." It doesn't cost you anything though.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Ok, just for fun, I manually went back through the last week (EUR/USD) and noted each place where there was 5M RSI(12) divergence followed by a confirmation candle. There was a total of 21 times this happened. So if you waited to turn this EA on until each of these times, you would have had 21 winners with only two level 3 trades and the rest L2's and L1's. I figured I would have been asleep 4 of those signals so would have ended the week with 17 winners. Still looking for that elusive EA that will trade this strategy. I'm going to look back through the chaos of April/May and see how this strategy would have done and give a summary.

No! Its a free forum. http://www.jtatoday.com/get-b3.html Thats the official web site for B3. And its free.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Yah, if you want to be a super-trader, you have to subscribe to their top-secret super classified no foreign intel reps allowed in the room secret compartmented forum threads! if only... The Blessings is in testing phase as well.... It was designed for USDJPY so any other pairs come with greater risk. I went to like 9 levels w/ EURCHF on blessings, so I took that one off the other day. It was in beta anyways. It does basically the same thing (if you want it to), but has a lot more of the functionality built into it for safe trading. Considering though, drawdowns have been pretty low compared to NB4H and of course SWB... I wonder why they don't post B3 on ff..? SWB is a great EA, but it needs 'something'.... I guess I am not smart enough to figure that something out... I feel like we are all on this journey together. All coming to different conclusions at different times, but always coming full circle.. Interesting..

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Ok.. I can do martingale on backtesting w/ some currencies, but others it just does the old .01.... Can someone point me in a direction of why this may be?? EURUSD, and others, no problem GBPUSD, and some others, nope.... If I change it to TP = Money = True, then the Martingale works on GBPUSD... Strange.. Any pointers??? --EDIT: NEVERMIND, I forgot another setting I changed screwed this up... Thanks..

--- 帖子 #161 ---
In my opinion this EA needs a very slick programmer who can program it to only enter a first trade when there is RSI divergence. This really does a good job of eliminating the high level trades.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Yah, I agree..... That would be interesting. Did you check out this post? http://www.forex-tsd.com/setup-quest...dicator-3.html It seems they have divergence indicators, but I didn't see RSI? I just skimmed it though. Here is the Divergence indicator on Ninja... I loaded it a while back, but didn't like it. Can't recall why... http://www.ninjatrader.com/support/f...p=15&amp;keyid=164 Try this I found also: http://www.forex-tsd.com/metatrader-...hart-help.html (I am testing the divergence.mq4 at the moment) This one has a couple http://www.forex-tsd.com/indicators-...ivergence.html rsi divergence indicators.... Ok... just off those posts and the leads to other posts I found at least 5-10 of these things. Good hunting as I think you will find what you need? Seems forex-tsd has more of them than ff. Keep us posted.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Thanks for trying but those two indicators draw some pretty strange lines for divergence. I'm not really looking for an indicator though. I know exactly what set up of divergence I need and can recognize it easily. The thing is getting an EA to recognize the same peaks and valleys that you see as the setup for a trade.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Yah, I figured that maybe we could take one of those guys (unstrange them) and use a slope % or something to get us closer. It is challenging and I guess that is why you don't see it done or maybe only the big guys have stuff like this? hmmm. I figure if it maybe sends out an alert when div gets close, then you turn on the EA etc... Post a pic of exactly the idea situation if you could and see if maybe a wandering programmer could play around with it.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Basically I had to redo this whole option, but yes, it now appears to be working. I haven't done any extensive testing though, because both my demo accounts are currently tied up. I backtested it with one currency pair though and it worked fine. I also got it to close out two currency pairs while forward testing, but this was in the midst of making changes, so I can't be totally certain. Yes, and I also added option where it will suspend trading if you like. If you look in the properties box and scroll down towards the bottom, the option is called maximum_trade_exit. The suspend_after_exit option is right below that. Yes, this is the general idea. Oh, if anyone wants some idea on how the current options work, I've pretty much broken it down in this post here . ETA: Added extra code to insure option won't work unless set to value greater than zero.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Thanks ecTrade. My mega backtest from an earlier post crashed after about 36 hours. I got from 2001 to 2009 with level 10 being hit 15 times. I don't want to tie up my machine with such a big test again but will load this new version and maybe test from 2007. Looks good Paul

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Great. Oh, in order to use the current option, set it to any number other than 0, otherwise it won't work ... which is fine. Also, in case anyone missed it, the most current version is at the bottom of the last page .

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Ok.. I changed my settings while testing and last night for some reason, several currencies wouldn't go past level 4! So, needless to say it crapped out. Interesting why though as they all have the same settings and recompiled. I guess I have to close down MT4 and maybe even reboot to clear any cache. This is on the older version, not the new one.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Ive made so far 4 pairs backtests of swb grid v 4.1 with default settings on 15M TF EU hits twice L8, GU,ChU,AU went deeper JU backtest doesnt work (order send error). Backtest were done via MT4 platform (Alpari but that is not relevant) using Ducascopy 1M history data. Be patient with html files. it takes a while till they open. At least on my computer. Cheers Karel

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Maybe too many orders (trading multiple currencies) and total lots is too high? If it's a newer version (4.1.0.8 or higher) you might want to try deleting global variables in Tools (or using F3).

--- 帖子 #171 ---
ecTrade I have loaded up the latest version but need some help with the settings. I have previously been testing the original version using the following settings lot 0.01 multiplier 1.5 tp in money 1 RSI period 30 range 10 all other setting default. The first screenshot below is the beginning of testing this year and the first couple of trades. I loaded the latest version tonight changed the setting to the above and added an exit at level 6. The second screenshot is the first couple of early trades. As you can see it went up to level 6 straight away unlike the first test. It then correctly? closed the trades and started again at level 1. These trades didn't close so I manually stopped the test and the result is in screen shot 3. What I am looking for is to use my settings as outlined above but simply to close all and start again if it goes to a certain level (in this test level 6). I am probably just having one of those dumb days but can't figure out what I have done wrong. Also it looks like after resetting the ea doesn't know when to close the trades or perhaps thats just because I haven't set it up right. YOur help would really be appreciated. Many thanks Paul

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Did you download the latest mod? I had to correct it. I said it wasn't supposed to do anything unless you set it to a value greater than zero. However, I forgot to incorporate it into the code. Of course I don't know if this is going to address the issue or not. Oh, and what do you mean by this? It sounds like you're saying at first it's working (closing all trades at level 6), and then it's not? Yes, this is what I thought I understood you wanted. It should be closing all trades out as you describe. If it's not doing that then it's not working (although it seemed to work fine when backtesting).

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Try running it with all the settings just the way they are (default), except change it to the exit level you want, and see if that makes a difference. If it works, then obviously something else is going on and it gives us a place to start. Oh, I just backtested it again it seems to work fine. Although as soon as it closed out the first four orders (this is what I had it set to), it immediately opened up two more, because it was still in range. Maybe this is what you're looking at, I don't know? You may have also noticed it doesn't (or it shouldn't) close at the exit level you are asking, but at the threshold where the next trade is supposed to open. I figured there's no point in opening a trade and immediately closing it again. At least that way you don't have to pay for the spread. Of course this may not be the optimal setting either. If you have some other ideas let me know.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
ecTrade I am in the middle of another backtest at the moment so will try again tomorrow. What I meant in my last post was that the new version at the beginning of the year went straight to level 6 whereas the original version went to level 2 then closed the trade (see first and second screenshot). Is this wrong?? When it went to level6 it then did close correctly ( I am initially querying why it went to level 6 when the original didn't). Having closed after level 6 the next series of trades opened but didn't close for my take profit im money target of 1, instead it went on until I manually stopped the backtest, albeit it closed for significant profit I am not sure when it would have closed if I had left it. What I had originally wanted was for the level 6 trades to close then a new cycle to start aiming for a target in money of 1, unless you feel that the way it is coded is better - perhaps I just didn't let the test run long enough. Paul

--- 帖子 #175 ---
No, that doesn't make any sense. Have you tried running the original test with earlier version to see if it's closing the same way? Also, you might want to make a note of the spread (if possible) and see if it's the same, as that can make a difference. You might want to go back and check the original input parameters between both versions and see if they're the same. It's possible I may have changed them and didn't set them back to the original. Yes, I understand you are looking to repeat the same cycle each time it closes out. If it's not doing that, something is wrong.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
You can't trust this EA to shut trades down at TP fast enough to be in profit. Today when a L7 TP'd, by the time L1 was closed I lost more than $360 trading 50 cents a pip. If price goes against you while trades are closing, you're screwed. This is why I was asking for a change in the code to close all trades at the same price at exactly the same time. I think I'm done with this one.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Have you tried alt_closeall_tp in version 4.1.06? (although 4.1.0.7 is probably better). Anyway, have you seen this? I might have to modify it a bit but, it does work. And no, there's no need to have two separate charts open, just one. You just won't be able to access properties box (although possibly by changing to higher time frame) when running. Of course if I set it up so all you need to do is input the magic number, chances are that won't be necessary.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
I've been running version 4.1.0.3 on an Alpari US demo since May 14. The starting balance was $2901 and the current balance is $4394. All but about $200 of the profit is from the SWB EA. It has never gone beyond level 4 in the time I've been using it. I am using the following settings on E/U, 5m time frame: Start Lot: 0.1 Range: 25 Level: 7 Multiplier: 2 TP in money: 5 All other settings are default. I don't know why others are blowing up, but I have only been using it on EUR/USD. I put it on a live IBFX mini acct last night at 2 cents/pip and set the TP in money at .50. It took 1 trade for a 50 cent profit, but I turned it off since I am working out of town this week and can't leave my laptop running in the hotel while I'm working. Will run it live when I get home next week. Details as they develop. Ed

--- 帖子 #179 ---
They have the US Employment news coming up on Friday anyway ... not unless you feel like doing something daring. I just set mine up (my own version) on IBFX mini account too but, will probably shut it down tomorrow night or, suspend all trading.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Why? they are expensive, lower middle of the range in my opinion

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Yah, 5.00 is safer (or .50 cents.) It should win, but backtesting showed it could still blow up a few times w/ 7 levels. This is an easy one to backtest. The thing that concerns me is 5.00 is perfect on backtest, but 4.00 or 6.00 sucks? Why is that so magical... I also tested and USDCAD and EURUSD were my worst pairs doing demo forward and backtest. I was going for 30 pips though instead of 5.00

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Who do you recommend. So far I don't like any of them except ECN's...

--- 帖子 #183 ---
It's the ratio I think, that determines what size the TP is set. If it's too large, then it has to go further in order to retrace, meaning it will require more levels. If it's too small, then you aren't making enough money to sustain you, in the event that it does go to a higher level. Of course if you have enough money in your account already (many of us don't), then it shouldn't be an issue.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Please help me, Im testing eur/usd on 1m, when lot goes to 1.60 I have an error, how can I do order limit, for example 5 order by martingale if SL on 5th order, EA should buy from 0.1 lot again, Sorry for my bad English)))))

Hi.. I have been testing this EA 1 week.. I started only on eur/usd, and next I included eur/jpy.. Today, I saw in my demo account and I am really impressed :-)) look at it ! I do want same on my live acount cheers sumax

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Yes, if I were a scalper, I would be looking at them as well. I scalp futures (moves much better in my opinion and more readable from indicators) and trade forex a bit longer term on 4H typically. I like Ducascopy, ATC Brokers (currently with them), and MB Trading. I like Iamfx as well so far demo.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
ECTrade, I started forward testing on 8 pairs. 25th May 2010. Account grew from 3000 to 6433. All very good. however,just yesterday, there is open trade for NZDUSD is -2011 . 6th level. Can u modify the EA to look at the angle of decline or ascend of first 4 levels and stop just this ONE trade to prevent trade from blowout!! Stop trade if angle more than 60deg to the horizon. I prefer keep trades to just max 4th level, and having slightly less trades than a blowout. Steep declines/ascend usually mean taking trades to higher levels. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Sounds like you're trying to base it on the moving average, I guess? Unfortunately I don't know enough of about working with indicators and really can't help you there. Sorry.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
@ ecTrade.. can you help please? I tried to test how this EA behaves with Global_SL.. I put 10%, G_SL= true but ea didn't close all trades and account got 80% dd. Maybe, I used wrog seting for test. Can you please attach your settings ? Appreciate your help sumax

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Oh well, I guess that's what I get for not taking the time out to test it. And yes, your settings appear to be correct. I can only tell it's working correctly with one pair (locally) while backtesting though, and will have to wait until I can forward test it to see if it works globally. The global kill switch also seems to be working as well. Oh, once you've enabled it, in order disable it, you have to set percentage to 0, and set stop loss enable to true. ETA: Had to modify and set global_stoploss_enable to false , which is default setting.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Thanks a lot ecTrade. Now, it works pretty good :-).. anyway, I have done some backtest, and conlusion is: too small G_SL giving us too many lost. However, I can not imagine use this EA without SL. Seems to be sense, if everybody optimize G_SL to his own preferable level. In my opinion, levels 6-7 requires G_SL=40%. It allows EA to recover and same time protect our accounts . Cheers sumax

--- 帖子 #193 ---
If you have a larger account it's probably okay to set G_SL lower. However, 40% seems pretty drastic for any account. It's better than blowing it all at once though.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
You're right. Yeah.. 40% of SL really good "killer" :-).. I think, it's better to combine with range &amp; lot_mulitpier.. btw: can You take a look into last version (9.1) please. I tried to optimize following parameters : range - lot_multiplier - tp_in_money but EA opens all trades with default settings : 25-2-5. Also in backtesting not available to change them. Thanks sumax

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Yes, these are the default settings, and you should be able to modify them, either way in properties box. Yes, you can. Just click on "Expert Properties" and "Input" tab before running test.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
@ ecTrade ... I know :-) I changed them but EA opens trade with default settings.. don't know why. Have you tried?

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Did you know that the strategy tester has its own properties box? I use it all the time and I'm always changing the settings. Sometimes it's good to hit reset before loading the new settings (especially after modifying an EA). Have you tried that?

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Hi ecTrade.. sorry to bother You but all can be changed/modified except of tp_in_money.. edit: I meant, tp_in_money is 5, even if changed to 10.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Really? I just checked myself and it appears to be working fine. If you are using version 9.1, it will tell you which value you put in at top of display. You can also tell if the value is bigger if TP indicator line (distance) has increased.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
damned.. i give up .. I entered tp_in_money=10.. see my chart below.. today EA opened trade on e/u and took 5 .. 2010.06.07 08:00:22 '910218': order #16090048 sell 0.10 EURUSD at 1.1947 was modified -&gt; sl: 0.0000 tp: 1.1942 anyone, who uses this version has same problem or it's only me ? rgds sumax

--- 帖子 #201 ---
hi folks, I've been using the 4.1.0.3 version for 5 weeks now and have tried several settings and I think that I have found the right combination now with extremely low risk. But first the addition of a hedge feature must be implemented into this EA. I've been using this hegde system manually for 3 years now and it has proved to be very successful. EC could you work this out? If yes, just tell me and I will send you an exact explanation of what I mean per PM. Happy Trading Raph

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Ralph why don't you explain your hedge feature in detail here so everyone can see? I can modify the code.. . In fact I made the following changes to the buy/sell signal function. - Dynamic range using 100 period H1 ATR, now works with all currencies except JPY (don't use JPY pairs they are too volatile) - Trade based on 100 period daily moving average (only buy when 100 period dialy ATR is above the MA likewise for only sell). This usually indicates strong trend and you don't have the likely scenario of price trying to touch the MA if its within the daily range. - Use MACD (50/100/9) on the H1. Trade buy when MACD is rising and sell when it is falling. - Use RSI (2)... 10/90 levels Using this I am forward testing.. today I made about $150 on a $5000 account on 10 currencies. I trade starting at 0.1 lots and max was level 3 (0.4 lots). I also only trade one set at a time so if one currency has a condition it only enters if theres no other trade. I will upload it after some more testing. Jag

--- 帖子 #203 ---
I would like to test, upload pleas

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Give it a few days... test may fail... but I think turning off during news... sticking to LONDON/NYSE hours and maybe taking an SL when fourth level hits may do the trick... I would not want to use a fourth or fifth level of multiplying leverage by twice each time. R:R would not let you win over the long run. On the 6th or 7th level if you decide to take the hit you would need 100-200 trades to make up that loss... not worth it. With a fourth level hit you need 10-20 which is not bad.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Even setting SL at point where L4 starts would result in twice the money lost as profited looking at this year. 97 winners for $2442 with 26 losers for-$4875. Each SL hit would be worth -$187. Thats trading .05 lots with a 2 multiplier. TP set at $6. Have you come up with settings using a SL that ends up in profit? thank you

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Hi Jag, my hedging system that I've used very successfully until now works as follows: Depending on your risk management you start hedging at a level you choose. I.e. if you choose to start at the 4th level (0.8) and you are in a buy trade then you would hedge by selling half your amount (0.4). If your original trade (buy) continues to run against you and reaches the next level (0.16) then you cash in you hedging trade (sell 0.4) and start immediately to hedge half the next level (sell 0.8). This way you increase your balance every time you cash in your hedge until your original trade comes back and you are in profit. Of course when it comes back it has to run a few pips more than before to be really profitable because you also have to consider the hedge that goes against you. As my experience by using this system manually in the last 3 years has shown you make a lot of money just from hedging until your original trade comes back. Most of the time when the original trade comes back to be in your favor it runs very strong in your direction so there will never be a problem to get the extra 10 to whatever pip amount you need to be profitable despite the hedge. So you can see that way you would profit both ways. But the most important fact about this strategy is that its very difficult to get a margin call because the closed hedging positions add all the time cash to your balance. I hope you understood my explanation and you will be able to modify a code for this. Raph

Hey just for the record, here are my results so far for the last 19 days trading only with the trend only (200 SMA on the 1 hr chart).... http://www.mt4i.com/users/pipcruiser/stats I had a few bad days last week 3-4 june, but that was only because i tried to put in a SL, didnt work out...... (dont fix it if it aint broke, yeah i know ha ha) With the hedge function just suggested and the above filter used, I think we have a winner BR PC

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Thanks foe EA, but I cant understand what is SL??????

--- 帖子 #210 ---
LoL I 99% doubt we have a winner anytime you are dealing SLless martingale you are asking for a margin call. I see in your statement you already have a few 5 level trades. A little broker manipulation and some bad luck and you may have 6 or 7 levels and boom your test is done. Yes a 200 SMA works well but price tends to do crazy things around the MA so that is why you will get margin called at price in your favor of the MA but too close to it (maybe news or big players). In reality you have to hope for an occasional level 3 or 4 trade but never more... if you are getting a level 4 trade once every 10-20 trade sets it may be ok but not any more. Thats why I added more filters and the moving average... actually in backtesting the EA doesnt trade for most of 2007, which may cause for a boring EA. But thats the way to play if you are risking a large percentage for a small gain. I think manually if you are in a trade and it goes your way you can let your profits run with the trend line to support you. This may be the thing to actually turn the EA into a winner. Letting it run as is... would be wasting yours and everyone elses time by giving false hope. The EA only took one trade today on EURCAD 2 levels. Jag

This is more like a grid set up then. Thanks for describing it... I will do some tests. Interesting but I have to think about it more. What is the worsed case? What kind of situation is bad and what are the chances of you getting into a situation that will cause high drawdown? Jag

--- 帖子 #212 ---
I did some quick math and I get about 25% decreased drawdown doing this. My test criteria: -10 point interval -Place opposite position half size at second level(after first loss) -Stop at level 10 By calculating the drawdown without using hedging and with using hedging I calculate a percent of decreased drawdown. The actual drawdown decreases each level such that as f(x) approaches +infinity the drawdown with and without hedging is equal (no difference to hedge). This probably won't be a factor since we will never see passed say level 20 with the smallest lots, so I can conclude that hedging does decrease drawdown. However looking at the downside we can say it increases the chance of getting into a higher drawdown situation because of the extra pips needed to travel to get your desired profit. So we need to weigh the downside vs upside risks and see if its a good thing to hedge... probably short term it may seem like it but you keep doing it and you will see that you have gotten yourself into a mess that without hedging would have never happened lol Anyways just to put it into perspective... I will still program it and see how it does. Probably for our tests it will be the same result... since jumping a level increases drawdown exponentially and we only maintain a 25% decrease in drawdown per level... the risk of margin call is still roughly the same with a normal sized account balance. Jag

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Program something that will get you to 12 levels and in my opinion, you will be happy. 12 levels with profit @ BE worst case.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Jag, Did you post this EA? Or manual settings as well?

--- 帖子 #215 ---
hi Jag, let me explain my idea. My experience with this ea shows that 80% of the trades are closed in profit within the first 2 levels. Therefore depending on the account balance I would not start hedging before the 6th level. Remember, the only goal of this kind of hedging is to prevent us from a margin call. My backtest of the last 11 years shows that with the original settings the 12th level would have been reached just 3 times (considering no trading on Fridays). So it would be great if you could implement this kind of hedging into this ea.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Hi jag appreciate your input... Bear in mind, that if I was to trade this EA with real money, I would be on the sideline on all "red" news and other big events. My test has run 24/7 through all news NFP etc... Lets see where it ends, anyway its an interesting project BR PC

--- 帖子 #217 ---
I'd be willing to do this if I felt up to it. I'm kind of tied up right now. It would have to wait until the weekend probably, before I could get started on it.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Thanks a lot ec, I appreciate your efforts. Is it possible to implement the hedging feature into the 4.1.0.3 version? I'm using just this version because its kept simple, its stable and is easy to handle. I'm using a 1m time frame where only bb (20/2/0) is enabled in order to generate as many trades as possible (remember 80% of the closed trades are 1st and 2nd level, here's where you make the money). Therefore to minimize the risk I start with a multiplier of 2 (starting size 0.02) and then change it manually when it reaches the 3rd level (0.08) to 1.5. This way the next level opens at 0.12 instead of 0.16. Do you think there is a possibility to code it into the ea too? Currently I need to sit in front of my pc all day long and do it manually. I believe if all these modifications can be done this ea could be a real money machine with low risk. raph

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Complete Newbie Here, Can someone please point me towards a thread (or explain here) describing the follwing variables of this EA? Also, which version is simple and stable to work with? What is the daily target? The default is 100 but set to false. Will it stop trading for the day after $100 dollars is profited (if set to true)? Or after 100 cumulative pips? Trade_in_Friday If set to false will close all trades out even if at major losses (level 7 or more)? I understand multiplier, but what is increment? Is this the increment by which the multiplier multiplies. Wouldn't the multiplier simply multiply by the last amount opened? sl default is 60. What does this mean? All trades will close out after $60 dollar loss? 60 pip loss? 60% loss? tp default is 30. Does this mean that when a pair is up $30 it will take that profit and close all trades at that profit. tp_in_money_ default is 5. If tp is 30 then how can another tp = 5. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Did somebody say hedge? Anyway, this is basically what you're looking for Ralph ... I think. It was kind of a bear to get it to work and I had to modify the original code more than I have previously. Everything seems to work okay, except there seems to be a problems when it gets to level 7 (on hedge). It won't open next non-hedge order, but closes out old hedge and opens new hedge at higher lot level. It continues to do this and will stay at level 7, but opens (and closes) new hedges as the price goes up. Have no idea why? Oh well, I thought you might want to take a look. (I actually thought I was finished.) I also added the auto-lot change you requested. Basically I set everything up to parameters you suggested (although adjustable), so all you have to do is set the hedge option to true. ETA: Forgot to set hedge option to false (default) ...

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Okay, I think I know what happened. The lots total got too high, so it wouldn't open the next order or 8th level. In fact I went back and retested it, after doubling the initial deposit, and it had no problem placing the 8th order. So, this is just something to be mindful of, I guess.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Thanks a lot Ec, fantastic work. I will try it tonight when the session starts. So far it looks very good. I will report tomorrow how it works. If everything works well I'm planning to go live next week.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Okay, now it's doing it at level 8. But, basically since I doubled the lot size, from level 7 to level 8, that would make sense. And, in fact when I checked the journal, that's what it said, "not enough money." Will have to try it with different settings I guess.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Hey, I didn't see this! ... must be straining too much in front of the computer. Oh, and you're welcome. Good luck!

Hi EcTrade, Just running some tests on your latest version with hedging and I just want to say it looks teriffic. For the tests I extended the range to 60 on GBPUSD and ran the EA on the 1 hour chart. It looks like it is the closest thing to an EA where you can set it and let it collect the pips with a very managable low draw down. Very impressive, many thanks indeed. Aidan.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Of course now all you have to do is find an account that will allow you to hedge ... at least in the States. Also, it wasn't my idea. It was raph19's. I just implemented it.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Hello ecTrade. I intend to go live with hedge swb after demo this I WOULD LIKE TO FORWARD test but I need to know what every cloumn does.. There are 2 things which I am uncertain: What does increament mean and what SL TP means? Do You think we do not need any shirt protection in SWB Hedge version? Of course I can use MPTM, but I intend to set SL for each pair individualy which would be dificult with MPTM. Many thanks and big respect to you Regards Karel

--- 帖子 #228 ---
I have no idea what these are? I basically use the default settings, except I might set the range and tp_in_money values (and possibly lot ratio) differently. Shirt protection, what's that? I prefer not use SL settings myself, and opt to find more "creative" ways of closing out.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Increment will be used when the multiplier is set to false. i.e. if start lot is 0.01 then an increment of 0.02 will mean that the next lot will be 0.03 (0.01+0.02) and the next 0.05 (0.03+0.02) and so on. Regards.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Thanks for reply. If I understand well there is an option to trade the grid with SL and after SL is hit new trade is executed with bigger size level- That way I do not carry over 1 regular lot in 10th level but only 5.12, right? Thank You guys and let there pips be with you.. K.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Sorry about offtopic. Do You know any broker who allows to trade 100 and less of base currency units, have at least 1:100 or better leverage, uses MT4 and allows to hedge? try to google it but havent find it...

--- 帖子 #232 ---
You can try posting a thread in the brokers section . Although I heard DeltaStock was supposed to be pretty good, although they are located in Bulgaria I believe. They have their own platform which is kind of funky though, but you do have the option (if you look for it) to download MT4 platform by itself.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Thanks.. They offer minimum lot size 1.000 currency units (0.1USD on EU) which is too much. Ideal brooker for this EA is no minimum or 10 units minimum lot size, 1:500 leverage, no maximum lot size, Allow hedge, and have no limitations of opening orders and MT4 of course.. But it seems that doesnt exist such a brooker.. But I will ask on brooker discussion. Thanx

--- 帖子 #234 ---
I have a martingale strategy which is a bit different from the one discussed here. I need someone to make an EA for it. I have been using it for some time now and are making constant profits. The problem is i have to place a lot of pending orders per day on 4 different accounts and it is killing me. If anyone is interested to write an EA please pm me. It is not the holy grail, but if you apply money management it produces constant profits. Profit taking is not automated . You do it manually whenever you feel so.

Odd, I have the lot multiplier set to "true" and the multiplier set to 2.0. The increament (which I'm assuming means imcrement) is set to 1.0 but should be overriden by the multiplier being set to "true". I have this running on the GBPUSD on a five minute and I'm level 3. I bought .10, then .20, then .30. Shouldn't that 3rd level have been .40? Also, two quick questions......can anyone tell me if the "use_sl_and_tp" is set to true, does that override the tp_in_money? And if so, the defaults are 60.0 and 30.0. Are those dollars for the batch? And lastly, on the heding portion at the bottom, can someone please tell me what those inputs are for. I'm assuming that hedge_start means that a hedge will be put on when level 4 is hit. So if .1, then .2, then .4 are already on, when .8 goes on it will simultaneoulsy trigger a hedge of half the size of the fourth level if that number is set to .5. Is this correct? Then if the lot_multiplier_2 is set to 1.5, it should multiply that hedge amount by 1.5 when the next level is hit. How do you decide when the next level of hedge gets traded? What is h_tp_factor? and what is lot_multi_2_level? Sorry for being so long winded. An answer to these would be soooooooo much appreciated. Thanks

--- 帖子 #238 ---
I too have these questions, just haven't had time to sit down and test this EA fully, planning on setting up test to optimize over the weekend, (just got a new Quad processor today), so answers to these questions would sure help. Of course I will be sharing my optimization results on this thread. Any help much appreciated.

Shirt protection, what's that? [/quote] I think he means the equivilant of your global kill switch. It means an emergency stop to close all orders and keep you from "losing your shirt". Probably a Hopwood term. Has anyone thought about opening on 3 or 4 pairs at the same time, not too closely correlated, of course, and closing all trades at once when there is acceptable profit over loss? You would be accepting a lot of losers too early and leaving some money on the table. But, should be able to get an overall steady profit. Of course, this would mean managing it rather than the hands off approach. Just a thought. Shakey

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Oh, these are the options I created for setting up the hedge. Yes. Yes, this is correct. Actually this is a separate function entirely (requested by Raph19) and has nothing to do with the hedge. Please see this post . The h_tp_factor is a percentage of the range, that specifies TP value. So, if it is set to 1 (default), it means 100% of whatever you set the range. If you set it to 2, that means 200%, if you set it to 0.5, that's 50%, etc. This is part of the lot_multiplier_2 function and is the level at which it changes from the initially specified value.

This is the same as the closeall_target_price in version 9.1. Of course it's been awhile since I've even looked at it, so I can't be certain that it works. It seemed like it was at the time though.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Thanks, ec, I will give it a look see. I have been trading live with the original version on my little account I use for experimenting Lot 0.01 up to 5 levels multiplication of 2. all other set default (I think). Have been keeping an eye on it in my spare time. Made about 3% on the account balance on this last week. Maybe 1% so far on this week. At 5 levels, on an account this small, will probably blow it sooner or later. Have been turning off the EA when retrace looks to be strong, and manageing manually from there: closing when happy with profit. One thought I had was... Let's say you reached level 5. The retrace in in, and now level five is in profit. Later, when level 4 is reached and now it is in profit, set all trades stop losses to the entry of level 5. When Level 3 turns to profit, move the stops again to the level 4 entrance, and so on. Let it roll out and see how far it goes. Haven't tried it, and doubt it is an original idea. Probably have a lot of small losses or break evens, but once in a while, would probably score a huge one. Probably a flaw in my thinking. Shakey

Im playing with this system for a while and let it run on IBFX demo account for a week with 1000 USD deposit on all pairs that have less than 8 pips spread. I have 22 pairs setup and Im up 200 USD which is 20% in a week. This is quite impressive but there is no plan how to get out of bad trade which can easily whip out your account with all profits in a day or two. Im trading all dangerous pairs with the system. One option is to set global kill to 50USD. But I think SL in martingale based system is not good solution. The hedge seems to be good idea but according my backtest with AUDUSD where it went 15 levels without a retrace (august 2002) hedge seems to be only an option that holds you in a trade a bit longer but it is not a solution. Still learning a testing...

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Had similar results on IBFX backtest. $500 balance and tended to double balance about every 6 months on the EU. the AU seems to work very smooth as well. Yen crosses tend to crash it at some point. Shakey

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Surely another way to help reduce losses would be to close each losing trade as the next one opens. So for instance we start with a buy with lot size 0.01 (or 0.1 if this is your starting point). If the market moves against us and we open a level two trade at 0.02, then close the level one trade. If it still moves against us open level three at 0.04 and close level two. This combines with the hedge function should help. I have tested this over many weeks trying to get the right setup. I have been getting smoother results with an rsi period of 30, however since 2007 there is still an occasional blow out on some pairs. I have no coding experience but imagine the above shouldn't prevent much difficulty to some of the superb talent on ff Paul

PHP Code Quote : Then if the lot_multiplier_2 is set to 1.5 , it should multiply that hedge amount by 1.5 when the next level is hit . Actually this is a separate function entirely ( requested by Raph19 ) and has nothing to do with the hedge . Please see this post . So this is why my trades went from .1 to .2 to .3 (instead of .4) to .5 to .8 ? If I just want to keep doubling I should set lot_multiplier_2 at 2 or lot_multi_2_level at 100 or more ? PHP Code Quote : How do you decide when the next level of hedge gets traded ? What is h_tp_factor ? The h_tp_factor is a percentage of the range , that specifies TP value . So , if it is set to 1 (default), it means 100 % of whatever you set the range . If you set it to 2 , that means 200 %, if you set it to 0.5 , that 's 50%, etc. So at the default of 100%, if the range is 25, then every 25 pips the hedge will take it's profit and open a new trade when the next level of regular martingale trade gets executed ? If I want the hedge to remain open and double up I could set the h_tp_factor at 200 so I can get two levels of hedge simultaneously (or 300 for 3 levels, 400 for 4 levels, etc.)?

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Yes. Yes, I believe it should work either way. Also, if you set lot_multiplier_2 to 0, it will disable it, and effectively does the same thing. Yes. Actually, it holds the original hedge value (lot size) and effectively doubles, triples and quadruples the range size. And, now that I think about it, it's kind of pointless, because all you're doing is re-specifying the range with the hedge set at 100%. Originally I tried setting it up so you could close the hedge out early but, this is what it wound up doing.

I think this is a great idea for Martingale system. Thanks... Any coder willing to apply this idea to next SWB version?

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Sorry but its not a good idea. Its all about PROBABILITY.This way has an advantige to have minimum drawdown and dramaticaly less need of margin. But on the other side you will need to have significantly more positive pips to reach the TP than with the "hold trades martingale". So You increase the pobability of a need to have more levels to get Your TP. F.E. by original SWB to reach 0.5 USD TP (default with cents 0.01) from L2 Youll need only 25 pips retrace (the price goes back to L1 where L1 is @ 0 and L2 has 25 pips x 0.02lots =50cents) With Your Idea on L2 im already -25cents (L1 hit SL) and then I will need reatrace from L2 with 37.5 pips to get 50cents profit (37.5 x 0.02lots = 0.75-0.25=0.50) Probability here to get a bad trade is increased with this system.. And definitely this is NOT a solution how to avoid or get out of a bad trade.. --------------------------------------------------- What Im thinking about is some kind of Time filter which closes trade before important news.. But I think this would not help 100%. So my solution right now (which will forward test for 3 monts) is to trade as many pairs as possible (idealy with less than 5pips spread), with as many trades as possibile (1m time frame with Stoch turned OFF) and have a global kill swith for each pair separately set to 45 USD (or few pips before L7 point) , and one global kill switch set @ 80USD youll need to have well funded account (at least 4000USD). Then Youll pray to the following events: -the kill swith will trigger max once a week.. -News wont hurt you by triggering kill swith.. -Platform must not die (unexpected error) -Connection must not fail (Youll need solid internet access) -As youll start gain 100 USD a week Broker can harm you by disconeting your account from your platform. Youll never find out if it was an accident or their purpose.. I think I would sleep much worse with this "Fear Factors" I have learned from a very wise man named NanningBob two things: -If price goes Up must go down and vice versa (this is good for SWB) -before Im going to open a trade I have a perfect plan for every event that may happend during a trade. Im sorry but with SWB I have not solution how to avoid or get out of a bad trade.. Thats why I cant trade it live at least for now...

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Carolco Fair point. But as you mention it would reduce the potential for a margin call. If we then just accept that there will be less profit for a trade that goes past level 1 then it could still work. ie still close level two trade at 25 pips. In your example it would then simply give 25 cents profit instead of 50. I am only thinking along these lines as no matter what backtests I have done there is always at least obe big blowup. I have seen on backtests that trading 0.01 lots it may work for two years but then suddenly wipeout entire bank. I understand that you culd cream of the profit each year but you would still end up losing. Running any sort of martingale system requires balls as you can get cleaned out very easily very quickly so unless you are sitting in front of computer 24 hours a day you need to build some sort of protection. Your idea sounds fine about multiple currencies but I don't know if 3 months is a long enough test. Good luck Paul

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Yes! Exactly! I think the point is to double the account as soon as possibile. By reducing gain by 1/2 youll double time to reach 100% of your Deposit.. So if I will have a 100 a week (I definitely would not hold trades during Weekend due gaps which may cause disaster) with 1000USD deposit I will need 10 weeks of praying or proper global SL set.. There is no time period to test martingale. You can start right now. Youll never know when the bad trade comes, so it doesnt matter how long youll test. What does matter by testing is to verify your average daily income and facing potencial problems that may come (bad trade, platform crash etc.) and youll find out an optimal global SL protection. I noticed from backtests that a bad trade often comes during summer holidays mostly in range between 15th July to 15th September on some currencies..But it may happend any time. My idea would be turn off SWB in that time period.. Anyway im still not convinced about reliabilty of martingale. It will help you if you know how to reduce risk (f.e. trading 3 Levels only), but it can also kill You, so my forwardtests are helping me to find out proper settings and mainly if it is worth trading live..

Hi Pipcruiser, Are you using the 200SMA visually? or have you coded it in? Regards Mark

I went out 9 levels on the USD/CAD. The hedge came on so it seemed to allow buy me a few extra levels. Just curious though......as the USD/CAD was going up it kept doubling up my sell. Then when the hedge came on it would give me a red "take profit" line. When that line got hit it would take the profit. Shouldnt it leave that hedge on and then place a second bigger hedge if the original trade was still doubling every 25 pips. In other words.......there is only one hedge trade at any given time. It doesn't add on trades so there are two or more hedge trades. Another issue...... why doesn't a red take profit line show up with the initial trade. The hedge trade generates a red take profit line. I never know where the original trade has to retrace to in order for the batch to close. So anyway, I went 9 levels on the USD/CAD and was really sweating it (only on demo though) On a $100,000 demo it drew down to about $80,000. It then turned around and the account was as high as $110,000. When is this thing supposed to close out and take profits. I don't like having 25.60 lots + 12.80 + 6.4+ 3.2 + etc, etc...... Shouldn't this thing have taken its profits and closed everything out. I went from $100,000 to about $80,000 to about $110,000 and now I'm sitting at $104,000. If it weren't a demo I would have closed it out manually by now.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Yes, that is correct, although I believe this is what Raph19 specified. I could be mistaken though. And yes, if you made the hedge progressive as you suggest, it should help to extend the trading to the next level. Although you'll have to go that much further (probably not much further) in order to catch the retrace. Regardless it's probably worth a look, and probably won't require much to upgrade. I might take a look in the next day or two. No, that doesn't make any sense. Although it could actually be there if you have set the tp_in_money value too high. In which case you won't see it unless you zoom out on the screen.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Oh, on this particular version (03_h, which is closest to the original), the close-out price is averaged out and doesn't set the TP values. You will have to go with version 06 if you want it to do this, although it's not setup to hedge.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Hey I sue it visually so its not 100% accurate, but I try to update the settings every midnight... BR PC

--- 帖子 #259 ---
So my demo account goes from $100,000 and with 9 levels of USD/CAD it goes down to about $80,000. Then there's a retrace and the account actually went as high as $110,000. But it never closed out. And I just woke up and I'm back at about $74,000. My tp_in_money is set at the default of 5. Anybody know why I never took the profit and closed out? I do have other charts trading but they were only trading a few levels deep. And they shouldn't have any bearing on other charts, right? They're all independent I assume. Because of that red TP line not appearing I didn't know where it was supposed to retrace to. Isn't it suppose to close everything out on any given pair when that pair show a profit of 5 (based on the default settings)? Any advice would be MUCHO appreciated.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
That I'm not sure about. It has to be designed in. If not, and the close out price is based upon the Account Equity, you're liable to get faulty readings, which might explain why you're having problems. Oh, it's a pain-in-the-ass trying to design it in. At least it was for me, when working on a similar EA.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Did you have a different magic number for each instance of SWB running, otherwise it wont know which trades are which.. Hope you get it sorted Mark

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Actually that shouldn't make any difference, so long as there isn't more than one instance of the same pair. Or I believe this is how it sorts the orders (both Symbol and magic number) when closing them out.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
See, now the USD/CAD retraced a bunch and my account is at almost $108,000. How much profit does this pair have to make in order to close out those 9 levels? That's why it would be great if there were a red line. It's definitely made more that the TP_in_Money of 5.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Actually I tried adding the hedge to version 6 when you first mentioned it (which closes everything out by TP) but, it was a little more involved than I thought. Maybe later?

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Have you tried doing this with one pair alone? If you do and it works, then it means it's not setup to handle multiple pairs.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Hi ecTrade, Without using hedge, when I set use_sl_and_tp false , hedge EA makes sell and buy orders but when I set use_sl_and_tp true , hedge EA makes sell orders only. I would appreciate very much if you could fix it.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
It's not a bug. The fix was designed to work only when use_sl_and_tp is set to false. Sorry. If you are trying to set it to use "dynamic" TP values, you will need to go with version 4.1.0.6 or greater, although these are not setup to hedge. Currently I am trying to add hedge to version 4.1.0.6, but am having difficulties. It may take awhile. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Okay, I think I may have figured out the problem or, at least this is what I noticed when backtesting with one pair. You can only go so many levels high before the total lot size gets too high and it won't place any new trades (non_hedge) because you don't have enough money in your account. If you look in your journal it will probably says this. Also, it will continue placing hedging trades because you are actually reducing the total lots (net lots), and it will continue to do so until it can only go so far and finally crashes. In the meantime it keeps going up level by level but, without placing any of the trades you are trying to offset. So, the close-out target gets further and further away (very quickly). Oh, when you say your account was almost at $108,000, is this based on the Account Profit figure you see in the comments display? If so, then you're getting a wrong reading. It's supposed to tell you how much profit is/was in your account, as it goes up and down (vs. the starting balance), not the actual target price for each trade. I also tried adding a second figure to the right that updated each time balance reached a new high, to serve as a reference point. Otherwise it's not too helpful and is kind of confusing, as it appears in your case. Unfortunately I couldn't get it to work (I have done something similar before) and just left it as is. Of course I just now figured out what's wrong, which is what this new update fixes. Hopefully it won't be nearly as confusing. Good luck! ETA: Had to switch lot multiplier setting back to default ... to 2.0.

Oh, I originally tried backtesting with starting balance of $3,000 and 0.1 lot size, and everything worked fine. However, when I changed the balance to $1,000 I started having this problem. So, it's probably good to be sure you have enough money in your account.

Hi ecTrade, Thank you for your time and effort to make this EA better and better. I am looking forward to 4.1.0.6 hedge version.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
No, it was not doubling up on sell trades. One was the sell and the other was the hedge. Or, at least that's how it's supposed to work, where both open at the same time. And yes, the red TP line is for the hedge. Neither will it open a new sell trade until the hedge trade closes. At which point again, it opens a new sell and a hedge trade. Actually, when the old hedge closes and the new one opens, the new one will be larger, based upon the higher lot size of current level and multiplier. So in that sense it's still progressive. Also, if you increase lot factor of the hedge (h_lot_factor), say to 0.7 or 1.0 even, it will probably behave a littler bit closer to the way you're talking. Oh, I don't know if anyone noticed, but I did make a couple of mods on the previous update .

Pipernet, been trialing your SWB 0.3 version. Many thanks to all who have contributed. However it seems we are leaving pips on the table by taking profit at 5. How about taking profit for half of your lots at 5 with a trailing stop, moving SL at entry?? What is your opinion?? Ron

Ive been on 60x90 NanningBob thread where NannigBob presented similar concept of Martingale strategy. I ve been playing with the settings similar to his and I would like to know if his recorvery system to get out the bad trade does work. Could You EC implement this to SWB? The rules are: We trade only 3 levels. If were deeper than L3 we want to get out of the trade. So the price went against us we are on 3L trade: L1 0.01 L2 0.02 L3 0.04 Now as the price still goes against us it will open L4 trade with only 0.02 lots. In the same time we are closing L1 trade for a loss. Now there is L2 0.02lots ,L3 0.04lots and fresh L4 with 0.02 lots opened which we want to close @ BE If the price still goes agains us we open L5 with 0.04 lots and in the same time we close L2 for a loss. L6 would be 0.02 (with L3 close for a loss) so the recorvery line repeats 2.4.2.4.2.4.2.4... till we are @BE. This recorvery is designed for larger ranges (100+) It should be managed manulaly to make a decision if the market is strong enough to cover losses from previously closed trades. From Nannigs personal experience with 2.4.2 he did not go deeper than L5 with recorvery.. The reason why I request is that I backtested GBP/USD @ 4H TF from 08Jan2001 till 30March2010 (Dicascopy 90% mq) with range 100 TP50 BB and Stoch set to false and RSI @21 with lower 49 higher51 to have as much trades as possibile. stop trade on friday = True I got about 2000 trades from which two were 9L trades in 2008, three of each 6L, 7L trades in 2003,2006, 2008 and about 40 L4, L5 trades. The rest went up to L3. I think the 2.4.2 Nannings recorvery could help me to protect account equity and make me sleep better. Great thing is that you can start with 500 USD with nanolots (1pip=1cent) without fear of loosing all in an hour..

--- 帖子 #274 ---
I don't know about NanningBob (don't really have time to look at it now), but I have added a couple of mods that might tighten things up a bit. Basically there are three things: alternate hedge (hedge_alt), stop loss by level (stop_loss_by_level), and break even feature (break_even_set), which works together with stop loss by level. Instead of setting hedge by level, the alternate hedge totals all non-hedge lots and multiplies it by hedge lot factor (h_lot_factor) and sets hedge accordingly. It's a little more progressive. The stop loss by level allows you to set a progress stop loss, beginning at a specific level, deductible by increments in money. If you leave it set at 0 (default) it won't start, while increments are set with sl_increment_money. The break even feature works with stop loss which, when set to true, sets stop loss one level early and sl to break even point. This way it will break even instead of losing money when it goes to the next level. If you set it to true, it displays earlier stop loss level plus "/ BE" in comments field. Otherwise it displays the stop loss level setting (where it starts). Currently it's only setup to work (correctly) with one pair, as account profit is based on AccountEquity(), which will likely vary and give faulty readings when using more than one pair. This was also probably part of Mr. Options problems (I just now realized this) but it was being used as indicator only and not used for closing trades. But, now that I'm using it for closing trades, will have to see if I can find a better way to do it. Oh, here are some settings you might like to try to get an idea on how these mods work. Leave all other settings to default. start_lot=0.25; level=20; multiplier=1.2; tp_in_money=10.0; hedge=true; hedge_alt=true; hedge_start=2; stop_loss_by_level=7; sl_increment_money=7.0; break_even_set=true; initial account balance=1,000; Thanks. ETA: Forgot to add hedge_start level = 2.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Oh, I forgot to add hedge_start level, which should be set at 2. I also added hedge =true, although it is set as default. It's just that hedge_alt option won't work unless it is set to true. Also, no need to re-download just yet.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Just tinkering around a bit with settings here. The main thing I did was bring lot size down to 0.1 and set range to 40. Also set stop loss level to 10 which, so far doesn't seem to pose a problem. Got it as high as L13 before without crashing. I expect it can go even higher than that now. So far it's closing out a lot earlier and not reaching the stop loss, while using same TP value of !0. Looks pretty good! The changes are shown in bold. start_lot= 0.1 ; range= 40 ; level=20; multiplier= 1.25 ; tp_in_money=10.0; hedge=true; hedge_alt=true; hedge_start=2; h_lot_factor= 0.35 ; stop_loss_by_level= 10 ; sl_increment_money= 4.0 ; break_even_set=true; initial account balance=1,000;

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Oh well, I started backtest with EUR/USD on 6/17/2009 and it crashed on 12/17/2009. There were only two instances where it reached level 10 or higher before crashing though. Am not sure at what level it crashed? Will try again with range set at 25 and stop loss increment set at 3. I think I will leave it set at 4 to begin with though.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Okay, that time it crashed on 1/19/2010 at L15. Which isn't too bad I guess, considering I reduced the range to 25. I also left stop loss increment set at 4. I suppose I will try one more time with it set at 3. I think I will also try reducing tp_in_money to 7.

I have ordersend error 131 by hedge. The whole trade closes only when Hedge TP is reached.. so when the price goes against hedge order but in favor with "original countertrend trade" it wont close and error 131 is in the journal.. I dint change hedge settings except start hedge level (6) and orignal multiplier is at 2 TP in money is 10 Any thoughts? Thank you anyway it looks promising. but I think It cant be used on nano accounts (1pip = 1 cent) because almost every broker has limitation of maximum opening lots... So it can be used on regular account but there youll need huge capital... Which I do not have..

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Which error is that? ... "Not enough money?" I don't know, I don't work with the error codes a lot, although I do look at the journal from to time. Yes, this is part of the problem ... or, is the main problem. The lot sizes multiply so quickly. This is why I set multiplier to 1.2 in the first instance above. It seems fairly effective when hedge_alt is set to true. But still, like you say, it probably requires more startup capital. Although it might help if you tried extending the range, to say 100, or something like that. You can also try reducing the lot size to .05 and tp_in_money to 3.00.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
OrderSend Error 131 is a very popular problem that is usually encountered when testing MT4 expert advisors . What causes this error? It’s called ERR_INVALID_TRADE_VOLUME in the MT4 code. That means that your expert advisor is trying to send an order with invalid trade volume. On the absolute majority of the MT4 brokers setting some EA to open an order 0.123 lots will generate this error. But sometimes it’s generated when the EA, created for mini or micro accounts, is used on the standard account. If you stumble on OrderSend Error 131 during your testing, you can quickly find out the wrong settings of your EA — find the standard init() function inside your EA’s code and insert these lines of code there: Print(MarketInfo(Symbol(), MODE_LOTSIZE)); Print(MarketInfo(Symbol(), MODE_MINLOT)); Print(MarketInfo(Symbol(), MODE_LOTSTEP)); Print(MarketInfo(Symbol(), MODE_MAXLOT)); The first line will give you the information regarding how many units one lot holds when you trade in this account (100000 would mean a standard-sized lot). Remember, that in your expert advisor’s log this line will be first starting from down to up, not vice versa. The second line will tell you the minimum amount of lots you can trade (this is the most usual error; you’ll probably just need to fix the amount of lots your EA trades from 0.1 to 1). The third one will give the minimum step for the trade volume in lots. The fourth line will tell you the maximum amount of lots that your EA can trade. For example, demo account at FXOpen generates this info when I insert those lines into the code: 2008.07.10 15:13:37MACD Sample EURUSD, H1: 10000 2008.07.10 15:13:37MACD Sample EURUSD, H1: 0.01 2008.07.10 15:13:37MACD Sample EURUSD, H1: 0.01 2008.07.10 15:13:37MACD Sample EURUSD, H1: 100000 That means that 1 lot is 100,000 units (a standard size), minimum trade volume is 0.01 lot (so, one can trade starting from $10 on 1 position in a dollar-based currency pair), minimum trade volume step is also 0.01 lot (one can trade 0.33, 0.4 or 1.25 lot volumes, but can’t send orders with 0.333 lot size) and the maximum volume one can use to open a position is 10,000 lots. You can incorporate the MarketInfo() function at a more complex level into your EA, so it could automatically check the allowed values and correct its settings. But if you don’t want to code much, you can just use the code above to find out the right values and correct the settings manually.

as i read this i think my testing platform would cause the problem (Alpari UK)

Wow! How someone can keep track of all this stuff is beyond me? I tend to pick up bits and pieces as I go, while focusing on those things I'm more familiar which, for the most gets the job done. There's almost always something that comes up that's got me scratching my head though. It could be. I'm using IBFX 4 digit mini account for most of my testing. So yes, micro lots are still very much in the picture here.

I just got through running test with settings below. Started on 6/17/2009 (mini account limitations) and ran until 5/6/2010 when the big crashed occurred. It looked like it was about ready to pull out, but crashed at level 15. The account balance was up to $975 before it crashed. There were also three instances between December and February where it got up between L9 and L12. start_lot=0.05; range=40; level=20; multiplier=1.2; tp_in_money=3.5; hedge=true; hedge_alt=true; hedge_start=2; h_lot_factor=0.35; stop_loss_by_level=7; sl_increment_money=2.50; break_even_set=true; initial account balance=500; Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Oh, I had to modify EA, because it wasn't calling out correct parameters for sl_increment_money variable. I specified an integer instead of a decimal value, so I couldn't break it down at .50 cent level. ETA: Updated to include Break Even mod referred to below.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Okay, I re-ran the test with better results changing variables in bold below. Of course it didn't yield nearly as much money (less than $400), but did manage to squeeze by, especially around may 19th, when it reached level 12 with range set at 60 (over 700 points). start_lot=0.05; range= 60 ; level=20; multiplier= 1.25 ; tp_in_money=3.5; hedge=true; hedge_alt=true; hedge_start=2; h_lot_factor=0.35; stop_loss_by_level=7; sl_increment_money= 3.0 ; break_even_set=true; initial account balance=500; Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Just to let you konw, I updated the break even feature so it's now customizable, and you can specify it to start at whatever level you want. So, if you set it to level 6, and the stop loss to level 10, that means levels 6 thru 9 will close out at the break even point, before the stop loss kicks in at level 10. I think it's a good idea, since the point is to get out of the trade at your earliest convenience. Also, if you are hedging, it would probably be better to set it at least one or two levels after the hedge. That way you will realize any hedge profits above and beyond the target profit. Here is the latest test I ran with the settings below. It was doing pretty well until it crashed on May 6th at L10 but, I had also gotten more aggressive with my settings. I had about $620.00 in profit ($1,120.00 total) before it crashed. start_lot=0.05; range= 40 ; level=20; multiplier= 1.4 ; tp_in_money= 5.0 ; hedge=true; hedge_alt=true; hedge_start= 3 ; h_lot_factor= 0.4 ; stop_loss_by_level= 10 ; sl_increment_money= 4.0 ; break_even_level= 6 ; initial account balance=500; Attached Image (click to enlarge) Oh, I've included the update in the post above .

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Hopefully May 6th won't happen again - it was not a 'normal' market move - see attached for details, so I guess if you can get past May 6th you are certainly on the right track.

my forward test: start_lot=1; range= 25 ; level=10; multiplier=1.2; tp_in_money=50.0; initial account balance=10,000; period : 6 june 2010 till 20 june 2010 profit 86.94% (8 694) max level 5 = 2.0 lot suggested money management: use only 20% of investmentcapital f.e. when you have 50k use only 10K for trading and 40K in a non traded subaccount. recalculate every week the balance and transfer 80% of profit to subaccount.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Can't figure out why you had level 12 on 19 may. Didn't you had a gap in your data from the broker. I tried backtests on ALPARI and MIG and both has gaps, so backtests are useless on that way. There were gaps of 3-4 month's with over 1 000 pips difference.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Gaps? Really? Although I noticed there was a gap in April, that kind of messed things up. It looked like it occurred over the weekend though, so I figured it had something to do with broker opening times. If so, there's not much you can do about it. I didn't notice any gaps around may 19th though. No, I haven't noticed anything like this. But you're right, if these things happen, then backtesting isn't very useful for testing an EA's performance.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Indeed the data must be compleet otherwise a backtest is not reliable. 3 years ago the data of ALPARI was the best in the industry, but now I see they have gaps also. Anyone knows an MT broker with complete data for backtesting?

Ive been playing with the ECs SWB 4.1.0.3.2_h.. I backtested it on GU and EU from 8/jan 2001 to 30/Mar 2010 with no crash - 90%Modelling quality! It was backtested under regular account condition so 0.1lot=1USD with 200.000 USD start capital (on nano lots would be only 2000 USD) settings were lot start 0.1 Range 50 (GU), 40 (EU) Multiplier 3 - this is big point TP 20 BB false Stoch False (to have as much trades as possibile) RSI 21, 45/55 TF 15min allow trade on friday True Hedge false GU made 445.197 USD net for 10 years EU made 385.948 USD net for 10 years The deepest level for both pairs were L7 (14x by GU, 16x by EU in 10year period) which is in term of opening lots almost equal for L10 with multiplier 2. The big point is that with Multiplier 3 Youll need less points to hit the target by retrace than by multiplier 2. Multiplier 3 will blow your account faster But in term of probability it is "safer" than multiplier 2. I cant upload the statement since Im running new tests.. it takes about 24hours!!!

I am wondering if some one is already using this EA in live account? how much profit it gots in period of time? I am planning to use this on live with 10000€ I think I can get a good profit every month. Any comments??? Please be free to contest my thoughts, we can learn a lot with this... and get a lot of money without being too grid cheers Carlos

I do not suggest you to trade this baby live. At least with the settings You have provided.. You will probably loose all 10.000€... Try visual backtest through 2008 and you will see if your nerves and account would survive such a drawdown...

Hi Carolco, I don´t like the historic behind 2009, actually all historic you have from the day you start, is the one that is good, because the historic from the brokers are completly different. I like to back test with the data that I already have, that for sure is good. I understand for trying to backtest from 2000 till now but the problem is if you have some big and rapid trend without retracements over 200 pips, for example in 2005 your back test will not be affected because you are collecting without withrawing that so you always se your account going up. I don´t want to go live until I am sure that settings are really safe for me, I'm still testing in my demo account I will still posting to update my tests here. cheers Carlos

--- 帖子 #306 ---
I know that every historical data will be inadequate from broker to broker, and may vary from reality. Why i do my backtests through 10 years is that I have an idea what may SWB go through.. How to set up SWB to survive huge movements.. And doesnt matter how adequate is your data. What I think is that 10 year period of "some" historical data will give you better idea whats going on than 6 month sample of real data from your broker. Kill trade may come once a year with some settings or once in 4 year period with another setting. The point is Youll never know when it comes.. I do not care of origin and quality of historical data, because even the best backtest with 100% modelling quality of your prefered broker with whom youll trade this strategy will not gurantee that your perfect setup will work in the future by live trading... So what Im trying to do is to find a setting with good result which means Double the account as soon as possible with minimal drawdown and to have a lot of room for additional levels which may come in future.. If I made a backtests with multiplier 3 during 10 year period GU and EU would survive with 2000USD deposit on nanolots. I know that Im not willing to risk more than 2000USD, so this setting (even if it were succesful in the past) does not suit me as I do not have enough money for another 3-5 levels which could come in the future... I already lost 800 USD with martingale on nano lots as a newbie on forex so I really know what may come in reality...

--- 帖子 #307 ---
EC...? Would you be so kind to add reverse variable parameter to decide if I want counter-trend or trend martingale? I am watching visual backtest all the time and I think trend martingaleing could do better according to my settings... Thanx anyway...

I guess? Am not sure what you mean. How would you set it up?

Hi Carolco, I don't want you to be mad at me, I am trying to get the best of this, that means money and I am testing a lot of other EAs, like piplite, blessing 3, martingalexpert, and etc... to see if I can get one reasonable good to start trade, and like you I already lost some money with other EA, but because of my lack of knowledge. Now I am trying to reach the best EA even if I know that I can have only a 10% per month. By the way I am testing this EA from begining of june, piplite I am testing from march and the new blessing 3 recently, I am expecting to take some good news soon. I always test the EAs on forward tests, I do backtesting only to se in time if its good or so. I hope you don't think I was desrespecting you, I was not cheers. Carlos

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Oh Im sorry if I sounded to be mad at You, I didnt mean that way.. Im sorry. Perhaps its due my English which is not my native language and I do not have sense for it. I tried to explain my point and I do not want to be mad or arrogant to anyone in this community.. I think we are on the same boat and I would love to hear about your thoughts and ideas. We all are learing every day.. Looking forward to your results. My promising setup crashed few minutes ago afte 12 hour test in 2004..:-)

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Im sorry I didnt write it clearly... What im testing now is tighter range (10-15) TP 3 (3pips) and Multipler 1 Multiplier_2 = 1.5 from level 15 - 20 (im testing the best option) By this setting I am applying fibo 50 retracement:-) and I use multiplier 2 to get out of the trade when it is clear that TP will not be reached in the short time period (till 48 hours) that happend when the price reached L10-L20. The main gain is from price ranging and I think there would be a lot of more gains if the input position will be placed according the trend not against the trend (which is right now). So I would like to try this settings (20 levels with multiplier 1 and all the rest levels with multiplier 1.5) with trades to be placed according the trend which is in my case determined with RSI only (I dont use Stoch nor the BB) I have setup RSI to be my trend detector (21, levels 55/45) Original SWB place a trade according RSI: IF RSI value is more than 55 Sell trade is opened IF RSI value is less than 45 Buy trade is opened I need this to be reversed: IF RSI value is more than 55 BUY trade is opened IF RSI value is less than 45 SELL trade is opened So simply I would like to have a switch in SWB to have a counter trend EA or TREND EA

--- 帖子 #312 ---
I totally agree, This EA looks like it would be very good if it trades WITH the trend with the RSI cross as mentioned by Carlco. Again Trade with the Trend instead of against it. If that works, I have another trend indicator that I would like to incorporate that 80% of the time picks me up 100+ pips when the trend changes. I am manually trading something similar to this now, would love to have this EA change parameters to catch the trend vs OB and OS levels as it is trying to do now. May need to start another thread to discuss this EA so it doesn't interfere with this one. I have no programming skills so would be willing to test and share with all if someone were able to write such a EA.

Sorry I don't know enough about RSI filter to know which part to "switch?" What settings/options are you talking about that specifically need to be switched? I don't see anything in properties box that specifically says "Buy" or "Sell?" It's probably not that much trouble to do, I just need to know how to set it up.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Simple. Instead if Buy trade send Sell trade and vice versa.. I am no programer but I think the simpliest method to do it is to change Buy to SELL and Sell to Buy and compile to new SWB TREND GRID. For me RSi value determines a trend IF RSI21 is Above 55 we are in up trend (original SWB place SELL and i need to change it to BUY to be placed, IF below 45 we are in down trend (original SWB place Buy and I need a SELL to be placed) IF it is between 45-55 we are in ranging market.. Hope it helps... As i am no programmer at all... C.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Okay, you can try this. I just switched lower and upper settings, which are currently set at 30 and 70. Is this something you adjust to get the settings you are talking about? (45 and 55). Otherwise, no, I don't see anywhere in the code where it mentions these numbers specifically.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Okay, I set it up this way also. I switched Buy and Sell conditions and specified that rsi_switch==true. Let me know which or if either version works, okay? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Oh well, it doesn't appear to work in either case. Sorry.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Yes. v4.1.0.3.3.1_h doesnt work like it suposed to be but when you turn rsi switch true, there are Buy and sell orders opened at the same time (hedge).. So there is little progress.. Keep on swimming... And Thanx anyway...

around trade 5500 you certainly had a lag in your data, because the equity jumps up suddenly

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Yes, that is correct- As i wrote earlier. I do not consider this test as something relevant. I only need an idea how it works and how it looks like when the boat are going down...

--- 帖子 #321 ---
hi guys, I have backtested the original swb grid 4.1 as Carolco suggested and seems pretty good. I just saw 2 entries at 25 lots with no problem. you should see the setting in the file that I've attached. any comment please send it. I will be happy to see if my tests are good or no. cheers Carlos

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Yes, but this gaps can sink your "boat" when in reality it shouldn't.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Absolutely correct. welcome in forex..

I've been doing some extensive back tests using just the standard 4.1.0.3 ea on eurusd 5min TF. Starting with a £5000 account, at the start of each year since 2000. The best setup I have found so far is: Start Lots .25 Range 23 Level 6 Lot multip False Increament .1 TP in money 10 Rest default. These settings have been showing good results on the tests without any big blow-outs. The one thing I noticed though is that because I have capped the levels at 6, to keep the max lots relativity low (.75) you occasionally get some trades which stay open for many days, and once or twice a month or two before retracing enough to close for profit. What I was thinking was to incorporate a option to close out all trades at a given time each week - say 8pm gmt on a Friday night. Now of course with this you will get a larger then normal loss but thinking about this, if that trade had stayed open for several days it would be preventing any other trades opening. At an average of around 10 to 12 trades a day this loss could be recouped before the original trade had closed if it had been left open. If I was trading this live it wouldn't be a problem as I would just manually close out everything on a Friday night. But for testing purposes could you please add in a bit of code that would do this automatically so I can really see just what difference this would make. Many thanks for all the work that has been put into this so far. Daz

Set trade on friday to false and if your trades has "shorter term setup", there will be no gaps to hurt your equity...

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Setting it not to trade on fridays wont actually close any trades. It just prevents any from opening. If a level 6 trade opened on say wedensday but had not yet retraced enough by friday it could remain open indefinitely, preventing any future trades opening. I would like to test if by cutting any losses at the end of every week and starting a fresh the following would make a difference. Daz

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Cant get the hedge function working. Any help??? Ron

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Yes. Thats why I wrote shorter term setup, which means that 95% of trades wont last longer than 4 hours to close. That way fridays should be "clean" without trades and gaps wont hurt You so much..

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Its not working properly for me too, and because my broker doesnt allow hedge i dont use it anymore with my tests.. Try another demo from different broker with minilots.. It should be working fine.

Hi guys, I did a back test month by month in 2008 and the worst month was october, so I made a optimization on that month and belive me or not the performance for the others months were better than before. I've tried for 20k€ accounts and 6k€. the profit was very good, I used the EU pair and 5M as the orginal. perhaps if others in this thread try to do the same and at the end share the results to see if it was the same as me. Actually in this moment I have for a 6k€ account a month profit of 7795.73 daily target is 10 start lot is 0.25 with 676 trades in one month(october 2008). Please can others try to do the same test and see the results and post also? Carlos

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Hi, whats the point of backtesting so far back? the market has changed so much even in the last 6 months, you should concentrate your testing and optimisation for the last 6 months only! Ive done extensive testing on this EA and come to the conclusion you cant stop it taking the death trade unless you babysit the EA and stop out any losses asap. Although one way is to set the EA for manual confirmation so you can decide whether or not to take each trade but obviously your tied to the screen.... not good! Ive also tried coding in a 200 EMA so it only trades with the trend, but this dramatically decreases the amount of trades it takes but does increases the win lose ratio! Its hard to find a happy medium! Regards Mark

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Hi Mark, I was suggested by Carolco to see the year of 2008, worst year for EU, I backt tested month by month, because if you test the all year will encrease your profit and you dont know for example in 2008 the worst month is october... I optimized on this month and tried already in 2010 and as I said the performance was better than the original. actually I dont believe in long back tests as a year I prefer to do month by month. Cheers Carlos

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Hi when I read abt 20 levels (or even more) - I can not take it seriously.. if we start 0.01 lot, increasment=2 then level 20=5242 lots!!, if increasment is 1.5, level 20= 22 lots. Come on :-) Please remember, that it would happen - next "crazy dealer" fm Wall Street will mix "zeros" and 6th of May 2010 will clear your account. I think, max levels acceptable is 5-6. Then, we can combine with ranges. What do you think if we can count range every day, based on ATR. Every pair has own volality , so would be good to define range separatly for this pair, depends on ATR.. f.e this EA works fine with G/J - range 100, tp_in_money=20.. edit: I was not clear.. I meant : lotmultiplier=1,5 or 2 ... not increasment, which for my sample = 0.01

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Hi, Try setting increament to 0.01 or 0.02, and range to 100 for EU this is far more acceptable.. Cheers Mark

--- 帖子 #337 ---
If I set the starting lots to .01, with an increment of .01, the mulitplier does not work. All of the trades are entered at .01 lots. This is with the multiplier at 1.4. I'm running a test with .04 starting lots, and a mulitplier of 1.5, and the lot size is incementing properly. Is this a mulitplier issue? Rob

--- 帖子 #338 ---
@ ewinner Thanks for reply. I wanna be sure: You suggest : lotmuliplier=1, increasment=0.01, right ?

--- 帖子 #339 ---
well.. min lotmultiplier has to be min 1.5.. otherwise , you get: 0.01 x 1.4 = 0.014.. so EA opens next trade: 0.01. EA does it such way: takes last open lotsize x lotmultipier.. so if you take: LM=1.4 &gt; EA always open only 0.01

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Hi, I use 0.1 start lot, multiplier to false and then increament to 0.01 or 0.02 Cheers Mark

--- 帖子 #341 ---
ok - thnx. Will test it soon. take care sumax

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Thanks, Sumax. Strange that the multiplier has to be 1.5, min. Blessing will increment perfectly all the way down to 1.3. Rob

--- 帖子 #343 ---
I have something similar in my mind. Atr based range would have better effect than hard defined range.. And I think there is no need to have periodical range.. F.e. range between 2 trades (0.01 and 0.02) could be 30 and the third trade would be opened 40 pips above/below the last trade... But how we define the specific range at the specific time?. The answer is S/R based on hi/lo of 4H candles or daily candles? I do not know... I have not clear define it yet. Still Im watching majors behavior..

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Hi Rob... no, that is not strange. It's mathematical round :-) 0.14 round to 0.1. 0.15 lots round to 0.2. Lots multipier has to be min 1.5 if you starts with 0.1 lots. I think - if you start with 0.2 lot, then lotmultiplier=1.4 gives you 0.28, so EA opens 0.3 lots rgds sumax

--- 帖子 #345 ---
I have read most of this thread cause the "martingale" caught my eye and just have a few comments. All the tinkering and tweaking to get this EA to work well on back tests is academic. Trading this live is inevitable suicide. I have used all kinds of EA's before and never will let a program trade for me again. I would assume the point would be to let it run on it's own and make you money, but letting any EA run without supervision is guaranteed to wipe you out. Guaranteed in my view. The day will come when the market will not do what it has been doing and take all the money you made back. I spent at least a year testing and tweaking and looking for that magic EA or magic setting to make them work, up late nights programming and thinking and reading. My bottom line? None of them work without you monitoring them so what is the point? Why don't you just trade and monitor yourself since you need to monitor anyways? My formula for success? Clear your chart....of everything. Turn off everything and watch and trade on demo for six months of profitability. I am no millionaire but I have made 2% of my balance every single trading day for about a year, with zero days of losses. Lost trades yes but no days in the red. Six months on demo, six months live since the exact day I took everything off my charts and used nothing but myself to trade. All systems work till they don't, then they take your money back. The only effective and fully adaptable system is you, able to see what is going and why and adapt. The best EA is you (with enough experience).

--- 帖子 #346 ---
I try this on 1min charts on EU and GU, back tested the some really chaos period 08-10, it survived and make constant profit with consecutive settings, while it won't make overnight millinaires but it will grow and safe, would like to take any comments. try 1 min charts, account bal. $5000 lot 0.1 mutiplier 1.5 range 25 (i donot know what this is for, can someone explain it?) Level 3 (donot go beyond that) set SL 75 - 80 TP in money 35 - 45 very important, set both indis 5 and 95 or even 4 and 96 with this settings, this EA will take 2-3 trades almost everyday and make constant profit, it will take a dive once or twice or none each month if the market doesnot go crazy, but the drawdonw will not take all your profit because of the SL setting. i believe this is perfectly safe and can make profit in the long run, 50% / yr without compounding during the worst period. thx

Where can i find explanation of the input settings for this EA?? What they mean. What they do. Why would i change. What does it screw up if i change. What do the little colored tabs at left mean. Is there a tutorial for most EAs? Many thanks, Ron

--- 帖子 #349 ---
I don't know if there are any original settings or an explanation for it to be honest, not unless it's at the beginning of the thread? Unless noted otherwise, I think most everyone is working with the default settings.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
How many points there are between each level or the next trade.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Good point. Well Im still stupid enough to believe there is a setandforget pipmachine out there...

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Is it possible to add a feature to the EA so that it is possible to use only a part of the balance, let's say 10 or 20%. On this way this 20% can be traded to max level 5 and gives about 40-50% profit a week. Around once in 7 weeks the account will blow (the part that is used).

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Yes, I believe I have it set up here as the global kill switch. So it's just a matter of setting what percentage of account you want to close all trades and adjust lot size to fit within that range. Of course I haven't spent a lot of time testing it but, the last time I checked it was working.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Hi ecTrade I can't open the indicator you have send swb grid 4.1.0.9.1.mq4 . please send it again and also the EA . Thank you

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Indicator? No, there was no indicator attached to this version. While here is the last update on this particular thread . If it doesn't work, then I guess I can't help. Sorry.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
That is the EA. It is not an indicator.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Any chance of getting a version of the EA opening stop orders rather than market orders? I've found stop orders more profitable when using a martingale strategy as it doesn't open as many orders while moving through the multiple levels. Thanks, Bioquim

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Heh heh heh ... shame on you! I got something like this to work on a similar EA. I also tried doing it with this EA, but there's too many possible open and close configurations that it's hard to keep track of it all. I wound up getting bogged down with too many loose ends. That isn't to say it can't be done, however. Oh, if you set the offset high enough, like you say, it will bypass that level altogether (often several in a row) and catch it back on the retrace.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Hi guys, perhaps if this EA gets a equity protection that can be good for the losses that I've seen during the backtests... can one of you coders do that? place a equity protection set to 50% as default? Isaw this in others EAs and work just fine, actually when they lose they don't lose all money....as this...

--- 帖子 #360 ---
This is basically what Chunnel was asking about above, I believe.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Robo, The range is the number of pips between trade entries. What did you have the bol. band setting at for your back tests? What was your increment setting? How far back did you back test. Did it survive through 2008? thank you

--- 帖子 #362 ---
thanks, I will test it and let you know.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
maybe it's simpler to use a MA for it? Or do I see it too simple

--- 帖子 #364 ---
indeed

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Do you mean when and if to determine whether to open a market order? Possibly. Although when I use buystops or sellstops it gives me a definite opening price that allows me to count which level it's at. So far, it's easier to count it that way.

Hi guys, I don't know if you guys alreday thought on what I'm going to write here. But since I have talking to other traders and asking for their knowledge, came to me the hedging to protect the equity if the price goes more than, and this is an example, 30% of the account. with this I guess you can protect your account, not taking one loss for stop loss, insted use this tho protect your acount. this position will be close when the price reachs the open position of this hedging. as I said before I don't know if you guys already posted something like this, is yes I'm sorry put some noise, but I don't come here to often so I don't read all posts....

Hay guys, can someone explain the function of these input settings::: increment default 0.1 sl default 60.0 tp default 30 tp_in_money default 10.0 Please explain how increment applies here. If input -- use sl and tp set to true, and sl is 60.0, is this stop loss 60 pips, dollars, or what. And is the sl for the whole basket of orders or just the last order?? same for tp - take profit for the whole basket or just the last order?? And if tp in the money set at 10.0, is that pips, dollars, and is that in the money for the basket of orders or just the last order?. Many thanks for your help in advance. Ron

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Is there any way to set this EA so that when it opens level 1 the TP is set to 15, when level 2 opens the TP goes to 10, level 3 TP goes to 5, level 4 TP goes to 3, level 6 TP goes to 0. When using the hedge feature it seems that as you go deeper into the levels it needs to retrace much more. Heck, maybe when it hits level 7 you can set TP at a loss of 10. That could save an awful lot of people from having heart attacks. :-)

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Hi Mroptions, Good question, I have noticed that you can change the take profit amount when the EA is running. Say you start the EA off with TP of 15 then after it opens level 2 you can open the EA properties box and change TP to 10 and it will recalculate for the new TP. When the profit reaches that new TP level it will close all the trades. Also for example if it is in a profit of say 2 and you change the TP to 1 then it will recalculate and close the positions. Kind Regards.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Hi, How about if i have another ea running beside swb grid is Tp going to effect on another ea or it will work for only swb grid? Because i have another ea runing with it on demo it does not take tp as it does in back test that is very good on back test For Mroptions Decreasing tp 5 pips is not good idea because of spead and commisionon each level Decreasing tp 1 pip for each level may work well Thanks

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Hi, The case I was using was where the take profit is in money, $ or € depending on your account, not pips, so use_sl_and_tp is set to false. I haven't used two different EAs on the same currency on the same account so I cannot say if that situation would have an effect on the EA when it makes its take profit calculation. Regards.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
I admit to not being too experienced with EAs so, would ask whether somebody can help me with a few issues. I've attached the trade page from my Alpari demo account and, as you will see, the TP figures increase as the EA goes up the levels. The ones that have the correct TP I edited, manually. I have "use sl and tp" set to False but, tp, in money, as 2.5. Despite the fact that the 2.5 tp has been reached, no trades are closing. I've, obviously, made a mistake somewhere with the settings. Ignore GBP/USD; I loaded it without changing the setting to 0.01!! If connection is lost, do all trades close automatically? This would be a nightmare scenario if, at 7+ level, a disconnect occurs. Lastly, I tried to close all trades by changing Global Kill to "True" but, nothing happened. I assume there must be another way to close all trades quickly.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
I've been forward testing this since week with different settings and a multitude of currencies. http://www.mt4i.com/users/leo26 This account will be tested with other EA's in the future, so keep that in mind. Key elements of SWB to look for are the 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 lot increments. A good number of currencies blew the profitability. USD:MXN/PLN/DKK/CZK I'm not sure how the SL/TP works. I've set levels to 4 And SL to 40, but that doesn't seem to trigger (after the trade has already passed 40)

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Pls specify indis fields to modify

--- 帖子 #378 ---
I'm not surprised you blew the profitability trading those pairs, especially by limiting the levels to 4!! The orginal EA was designed to trade EUR/USD or USD/JPY, from what I remember. I trade with it, successfully, every day, but, limit my trading to just 5 pairs with a low spread (AU, EU etc). I can't help you with the technicalities of the settings not getting triggered. A friend of mine esperienced similar problems when he tried to activate certain settings. I use the default setting of 5 for "tp in money", Levels =7 and don't interfere with the rest of it, apart from Local or Global close all and/or suspend This is a very good EA, although it's obvious that it does have issues when some settings get changed. It's a great pity that this thread has dried up because, there were some good questions raised that were never fully answered.

From what I remember, that was a day when news about the Euro was very negative. There are times when you have to suspend the EA and stay out of the market. Despite the original concept of this EA, you do need to manage it, manually, once you move up the levels.This may mean placing a hedge to limit the damage or. getting out at BE, on occasions. Better to take a 300 pip loss than blow the account. At times, you may have to do this. As this is a high risk, countertrend system, it pays to avoid some of the Red data releases. You'll often find that a move of 100 pts will occur. I suspend the grid until that is out of the way and then activate it. This EA is capable of making £200+ per day, starting @ 1 mini lot (0.1). However, you cannot set it and forget it.

Optimal settings would be to set max level = 4 And enable the SL to 30-60 pips (although this seems to disable the bot).

I don't know which version you are using, but if you are trading more than one pair, that might account for this. I don't know if any of the versions are setup to calculate the correct price in this regard. I do know that while backtesting, after the changes I made, I was only testing with one pair (per backtester limitations), and it only occurred to me later, after someone else mentioned having problems, that this might be an issue. On top of that, it might not even function correctly when trading with one pair. I never really looked at it that closely ... although I did check and verify the closing prices were basically in the ball park after adding the auto-TP set function. I didn't check beyond the first one or two levels though.

I think in order for martingale to be truly effective it is important to have a strategy in place that is already quite successful. The strategy itself should test for very low consecutive losses.

Situation Well this sunday (07/29/10), the Japan Interest rate news release blew up my demo account with the default settings and 19 IBFXm pairs. In which case, I changed applied the following changes, backtested, and it survived to live another day. Settings Lot 0.1 -&gt; 0.01 --&gt; then 0.02 - this is a must when running with 19 currencies, obviously Range = 50 - less likely to give a margin call when opening new level Level = 6 - at range = 50, its rare for a pair to move past L5. - at range = 25, you should expect level 7 during a breakout x 19 pairs TP_in_money = 0.5 --&gt; 1.0 - lot 0.01 = 0.5, lot 0.02 = 1.0 Conclusion As Bluemele previously mentioned (few months back), Range needs to be a factor of an indicator. Perhaps, Average True Range (ATR), Standard deviation (STDEV). Anything that might keep the range small during low movements, but amp it up during a breakout. This is a great bot, with immense potential, but needs a few more calculated tweaks.

I can't agree with your first short entry level. On my charts, I got the first entry @ 1.2731. Irrespective of that, when you get to these levels, if you were short more than a couple of Euro pairs, nerves of steel and prayers to your chosen God would have been a must!!!

Depending on your available margin, it's important to modify the range. This reduces overall DD, by decreasing the # of levels, preventing the bot from imploding. I think Fridays and Sundays are the most dangerous for this bot on the JPY pairs specifically. GBPJPY tested all the way to level 7 for August @ range = 50. Im preparing an Excel to show the data collected from testing these pairs.

I still think it is a good idea.. Take the ATR of the daily or 4HR to assess or even 1HR....

Have you guys tried buy/sell stops with a trail? I have been MIA on this thread for a couple months, but just curious if you have tried this or not? That way, if price moves big time, then you won't get entered. Something like this: Distance between orders = 50 Price moves outside BB a few times, you are already at L4! It moves outside and normally would trigger again, this time you enter a sell stop and the price just keeps on movin on without you UPPPPPP!!! Well, the Sell stop could either: A) cancel after so many pips B) followup after it with a stop gap = x.... Just an idea, I use it on my other EA.... Works very well in fast moving markets...

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Yeah, sounds like the EA I'm working on currently ... or, different versions of it over the past six months or so. And by "trail," you mean the stop moves up and down with the price, until it finally retraces enough to cover the "gap" and open the trade, right? That's kind of nifty how it works. I basically tried it with buy/sell stops on this EA (without the trail), but there are too many loose ends that make it hard to work with. That doesn't mean it can't be done though.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
EA got killed again with over-margining due to the US non-farm news release. As mentioned before, turning it off during a news release would be a great idea. BTW, does anyone know how to prevent the EA from automatically closing orders during a margin-call or a certain %DD? None of the options seem to work. Edit : Nvm. Apparently, while I knew that there was a global stop-loss in place, I didn't know how to disable it because the on-chart text wasn't updating. Anyways, enabling global stop-loss % to 0.3 (risk) would have allowed the robot to survive the massive retrace.

Here is an excellent indicator of market breakout based on the ATR. http://www.jeremywhittaker.com/2010/...out-indicator/ What this indicator does is as follows: Takes the range(high-low) the last x bars. Averages the range of the last x bars. Displays as a histogram the percentage of change from the average. Takes an average of the percentage of change from the average. Allows you to set a horizontal line at your preference so you can see when the average is breaking out. This indicator has 3 inputs: “ATRPeriod” which allows you to specify the amount of bars to average out for the Average True Range of that period “WVBIAverage” is a setting that allows you to specify the amount of bars to which will be the average of the percentage of the ATR. The last setting is pretty straightforward it is “TooFar”. This simply will draw a horizontal line across the indicator so that you can visually see where the percentage is in comparison to other bars. Its purpose is to simply put things in perspective. Attached is Todays (09/03/10) USD/JPY breakout using ATR.

Profit Maximization I tested the variable TP_in_money to determine the %DD vs. Profit. Well it seems there is a magic TP_in_money At least for USDJPY. Mini-account.

You could be curve fitting here... I think if I were to reevaluate after testing a lot of systems over the last 6 months the things I would change about this EA. (NOTE: I haven't run this in a while so it could have some of these...) Just my 2 cents: 1. Put in a trailing stop gap entry. 2. Put in a dynamic exponential distance between each level. (much like blessings does) where the 1st level is x, the 2nd level is x * 1.05, 3rd = x * 1.15 etc.. 3. Put in a qualifier. Like NanningBob does with the 6th indicator. Basically just a long term stochastic which keeps him out of a lot of trouble. 4. Evaluate pairs more betta... Meaning, only take on pairs that truly are ranging to a certain degree. I have come to realize just about anything GBP has good range or back&amp;forth. Anything EUR/AUD/NZD and CHF just trend way too well without retrace.... USD is a smoother, JPY is an extender. For example, GBPJPY is turbulant but you will always get a retrace, just at a larger scale. EURJPY you may never get one for many many pips. For example: USDJPY, GBPUSD to me are the best pairs for things like this. But the distances have to be mapped. Other good ones would be EURGBP, AUDCAD, CHFJPY, etc... 5. Range multiplier dependent upon ATR like discussed before.

Yah, exactly. Here is my code: Inserted Code //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ void PendingOrderTrail() //+------------------------------------------------------------------+ //when a pending order is open, this function lets it trail at "StopGap" { int in, pendingsopen=0; //the number of open pending orders for this symbol for(in=0;in&lt;OrdersTotal();in++) //cycle throug the open market orders { if (OrderSelect(in, SELECT_BY_POS, MODE_TRADES)) { if (OrderSymbol()==Symbol() &amp;&amp; OrderMagicNumber() == MagicNumber) { if (OrderType() == OP_BUYSTOP) { if ((OrderOpenPrice() - (StopGap*Point)) &gt; Ask) //if ask price moved further from pending order open price { OrderModify(OrderTicket(),(Ask + (StopGap*Point)), sl,tp, 0,PendingArrowsColor); } } if (OrderType() == OP_SELLSTOP) { if ((OrderOpenPrice() + (StopGap*Point)) &lt; Bid) //if bid price moved further away from pending order open price { OrderModify(OrderTicket(), (Bid - (StopGap*Point)), sl,tp, 0,PendingArrowsColor); } } } } } }

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Yeah, this was something I figured out on my own, although I'm sure other folks must know about it. It's pretty useful for determining a position prior to opening a trade. In fact I've had the price swing up and down a 100 points or more, before it finally opened the trade.

Hi bluemele, thanks you try to change in SWB 4 10 3 3 3h ea I have lot of ideas about this ea When you make changes, Please Could you put Macd, ADM, indicators with option true or false, Secure profit, how many trades a day, and at least two time filter option to open a trade These are some ideas and sorry I may be asking to much i have some more ideas for opening trades when go against good one for any market, may be later Another thing I used headge system in back test and working no bad. but when used for forward test did not work as it work in back test please can you check bug in ea

Hi, I don't have time to do any programming for this EA. Unfortunately, I am spending it making money (Pips). One concept I just thought about was.... Usually if it breaks the BB, it will run up it a tiny bit, then pull back. I don't know if you discussed this at all, but something I am doing with Blessings is to create very small 'baskets' of trades at $5.00, 10, 20, 50, 100 Normally a Basket for Blessings is 200.00, but I have found that most times it doesn't go beyond 10.00 in drawdown. Usually, my blessings nets me 30.00 per day (20 currencies) or 1.5 per day per currency. So, if the average currency I trade blows up less than x times over the course of a month, then I am profitable. For example, for a 10.00 setting. If out of 20 pairs, they only have 20 blow ups (one per day == -400.00) then I am typically profitable (+200.00) Now, with a smaller basket Stop Loss, I could add more weight onto each trade so instead of trading .01 lots, I may trade .1 lots instead. So, with the same account, I would make 2,000.00 off the same amount instead of risking all my money. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Hi Bluemele, Sounds facinating, please explain a little more so I can get my head around the concept. i.e. how do you make up a basket of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100? - Are you starting with .01 pips and what would the range and multiplier be between re-entries? Does the re-entry value vairy from pair to pair? Also are you saying to accept a stop loss at the $20 draw down point in a currency pair? Best regards &amp; thanks, pipernet.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
You can set your basket threshold at any $ stop amount you want. Or you could have several to diversify. Basket 1: Stop = $5.00 Basket 2: Stop = $10.00 Basket 3: Stop = $30.00 Now, you let it rock-n-roll If it blows up on the 5.00, then it may not blow up your 10.00 basket or it may not blow up your 20.00 basket. Basically, you have to find a nice medium with lot size, and other settings to where IF IT IS A RUNNER ON THE BB BAND, then you are out of that trade and on with the next one. Different pairs will work differently. Some follow strict adherence, while others do not. Obviously, no news trading.. Starting lot: .01 lots = 1 penny per lot on a mini server called a Nano-lot. Next entry is .02 lots, next .03, next .05 (1.5 multiplier or whatever you want). By the time it gets to Level 5 let's say, the basket blows up. The most you can be out is X pips... Now, you have to have it blow up less times than your baskets profit total exceeds that amount! Let's say you run it for 10 days (1/2 month). Out of those 10 days, EURUSD blows up on a $5.00 basket 20 times. However, it actually profits $120.00, so your net is $20.00 for the month. Not a lot, but no worrying about martingale draining your account.... NOW, the key is that instead of just doing this with .01 lots, now that you have a stop and you are consistent with this currency, then you know you can start with .05 lots so your hit is actually $25.00 ||||| OR, you are now able to trade 5 more currencies diversifying your risk... If you trade 5 currencies on the above model @ 20.00 profit per pair, your profit is now $100.00 on a 1,000.00 account = 10%. Not 200%, but not broke either... The key is identifying how many levels it typically doesn't exceed to a point where statistically it will make more than it loses. Now, you could have a bad month, hence multiple currencies (more work on research and testing). Make sense??

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Any idea's on how you do that bluemele? Running a martingale gets scary v quickly. Running these numbers at a multiplier of 1.667 with no stop and you get to the puke point for almost any a/c size in no time. Entry Lots Cumulative 1 0.1 0.1 2 0.2 0.3 3 0.3 1 4 0.5 1 5 0.8 2 6 1.3 3 7 2.1 5 8 3.6 9 9 6 15 10 10 25 11 16.7 42 12 28 69 13 46 116 14 77 193 15 129 322 16 215 536 17 358 894 18 597 1491 19 994 2485 20 1658 4143 21 2764 6907 22 4607 11513 23 7680 19193 24 12802 31995 31995 lots open by level 24 starting at 0.1 lots. Ouch.

Hello Bluemele, You are the master sorry i did not understand your concept Because I am not master but that is ok you donot need to explain again i wil try again reading it. I am using blessing 3_v3.7.6 But cant find a basket option 1) Which bessing are you using? and if you don't mind could you share set file with us please 2) That is ok if you do not have time to program SWB martingale, Do you know any good good programmer that help to modify and how much they uselly charge to program? I found some good one through discussion forums I try to use their ea's that don't work with every broker and if any ea work always have some error in journal Please help Thank Sorry about my bad english

--- 帖子 #417 ---
An original thinker - I like your style. I've run 100s of Blessing demos, including many with 4-20 pairs. What I learned is that there is no real "buffer effect" from the additional pairs. It goes in waves. Even with non-correlated pairs, it's just a matter of time before several go into simultaneous DD. The other problem is that there usually isn't sufficient balance for each pair, so EP hits are more frequent. But, I do like your strategy. It's all about keeping the account alive, so it can trade another day. Rob

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Hey Rob, Yes, I have read many of your posts on the other forum. My theory is that if you have different sized baskets on different currencies, then you are correct, some will hit at different levels, while others won't. I am doing some basic testing and wondering like you said if the account survives another day. I have a few tests on myfxbook.com as well under bluemele. I am thinking if a 10.00 (nano) basket blows up, then it will be with the trend. Usually currencies trend for so long and then retrace, sometimes dependent upon conditions they trend longer/better than others. My theory that I am testing is this on blessings 3: 10.00 basket 20.00 basket 50.00 basket 100.00 basket Let them ride until they make it to the next basket level size. For instance the 10.00 basket if it has losses will start blowing up sooner and sooner as it could have a bad spate and end up being at like 5.00! But, if the currencies are trending hard, then they will make money because now they will be in the right direction....Maybe a 5.00 basket is the way to go on Nano or 50.00 on micro, etc... haha So, that one I would leave at minimum 10.00 unless significant testing is done. My guess is the worst you are going to do is slightly negative, not blow your whole account! As the baskets grow, the 10.00 basket will grow into a 17.87, 19.20, or whatever it ends up growing and you just let that basket grow. After you have some form of profit and the margin possible, you add another 10.00 account and let it grow. If it bleeds, you fill it back up with some credits... The other concept is that you keep them all at their respective levels and you start new baskets at different times a few days apart. As I am sure you know, you will find many many times a currency will make a killing while if you would have started it 1 hr earlier, it would have hit EP! As you mentioned, the whole concept is to eek out a little bit of profit using EP without the HUGE hit of a 50% EP HIT that would panic most people and cause them to move the EP or quit trading etc... I think with this EA, you will find that it runs on BB bands, but you have to figure out how often and when. I do believe that some currencies can be matched very easily if you spend the time to do historicals. Of course it won't always work that way....

--- 帖子 #419 ---
You know, I think blessings is better than this EA. It has a better support/programming community and it can do what this EA does... Why recreate something that already works. Plus, you can manually change the blessings to match this EA pretty closely. I know, I did it. I had a really good test going on the 1M chart using BB bands and the backtests were really good with little drawdown. Funny thing is, I got too busy and gave up! And, I can't remember my settings as I had millions of tests going... I really don't like forex-tsd.com for some reason, so I avoid it. I don't see why those guys couldn't port it to this forum as well? I get strange energy from that site... PS: I am definitely no master. Just an honest person trying to make some pips like everyone else....

--- 帖子 #420 ---
I think this has some merit, as I believe it will create a "stabilizing effect" on the overall balance. Anyone who has traded Blessing knows that start time can be a "make or break" scenario. Too bad you're not comfortable with TSD - it does have its fair share of idiots, but it also has some valuable contributors. Rob

--- 帖子 #421 ---
No doubt.... No insult to forex-tsd, but people seem to be a bit more aggressive to me from that thread. Life is good, share it love it live it... I am doing some tests now with a 10.00 basket, 50 and 100... I will report how it goes ... So far so good. I tried changing it to more aggressive settings and I had a blow up on the 10 and 50, but the 100 was ok. However, I changed it back, started over and they are much better now. Oh, and I think 3.8 has a few bugs.... I will stick w/ 3.7 for my larger account. I really shouldn't post this on this thread.. haha... Anyways, the concept of creating mini-baskets is a possibility with this EA if you guys want it! https://www.myfxbook.com/portfolio/b...0-basket/48632 10.00 basket

Guys, I'm still using the 4.1 version at 5m chart. I have 3 demo accounts in different brokers, Alpari, Ava Fx and ITFX. two with 10000€ and Ava with 100000€. I use this settings for 100000€ Ava, tp_in_money 150 and 3.0 Lots. ITFX with 10000€, tp_in_money 15 and 0.3Lots. Alpari with 10000€, tp_in_money10 and 0.3Lots, this one appears to be more reasonable. I am getting around 25000 per month on Ava, getting around 2500 on ITFX and around 1800 on Alpari. This is running for about 6/7 months and still didn't blow up any account. I did the same tests with 3000€ demo accounts and those didn't work out, went down when the Euro had a fast strenght over dollar. I've reallized that can be the best setup for this EA... I want your comments please. Carlos

--- 帖子 #424 ---
One of the key factors to running SWB, successfully, is, undoubtedly, trying to manage the risk without restricting the potential to make good profits. I've tried various combinations but, what seems to work for most pairs is to use a multiplier of 2 with a range of 25. TP of 25-30 pips. The real killer for the system is when you have several correlated pairs moving, rapidly, against you. When this happens, the open P/L gets quite scary. I'm currently experimenting with going no higher than L3. The reason being is that most of your wins will occur between L1-L3. A loss at L3 is 275 pips and the average win between L1 and L3 is 65 pips (30 pip target). From my own observation, it seems that successful closed trades at the L1-L3 level outnumber the L4, and above, successful closes by more than 5:1.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Just wondering if anyone is trading this on a live account? or demo and if so, how are the results? I ran a few test with V4.1, changing just "tp_in_money" to 25 all other settings default. And seems very promising. I started a demo with Alpari UK this week and will post results on Friday.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Hi Tommy, I have running this EA for a long time, and it is very good, of course you need to got money in your account to absorve the impact of continues direction. But as we know it always a retracement, if is not in 20 or 40 pips, will be soon, you don't get 150 pips in one direction without a retracement, it is very unusual, so for my money manangement I see the probability to go more than 100 without retracement it is one in 20 , if this happens the EA will open 4 positions, if you have the standard settings it will open at 0.1 after 25p it will open a second position with 0.2 after 25 more it will open another positon with 0.4 and the last one after more 25p the position will be 0.8... For me and this is my idea, if I use the standard settings I need to have &gt;5000€ in my account. This will make confortable to make money and not blowing up your account. Of course if I use these settings I will got around 700€ per month, so it is a question of sum...if I want more money, example: +- 2000€ per month I have to deposit 20000€. This is what I'm intent to do soon. Cheer Carlos

--- 帖子 #427 ---
It's good to know that this thread is still alive &amp; kicking. Tommy; you may find that a 25 setting is too high for day trading. You will make more money by using a setting of 5-10. If, indeed, you wish to day trade. I have been using SWB, both live and demo, for several weeks. What I like about this EA is it's simplicity. There are other EAs out there that have a similar approach but, the unnecessary complexity of their settings is daunting. By the time you decide which one of the 400+ entry criteria you want to select, plus portion control, drawdown %, max draw down %, you will start to wonder why you are trading in the first place. With a $5,000 account, it's not that difficult to make $2-300 per day, with this EA. However, you may have to adjust TPs, from L2 and above, manually. The EA has a lot of quirks and could do with a programming makeover but, it makes money. As this is a Martingale strategy, risk management is vital. My advice, fwiw, is not to let the grid go upwards and onwards to the L4 and above. This is where danger lies. Having come close to a complete account blow out (L7), I know that it is better to close all trades, once the Open P/L goes to -$200, rather than hope that you might get a turnaround by L6/7. You will have plenty of +$2/300 days to make this a sensible money management strategy.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Errr, no it's not. Martingales will always kill you soon enough.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
So tell if you´ve tried this EA and which amount you have used, when this happened, what was your settings to blow up your account?? or you only saing that because you've read this in some other forum, site or blog????

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Yes, they will if not controlled. If you read the posts that I made recently, I have explained how I use this EA and how risk needs to be managed. Dismissing SWB because it incorporates a Martingale staking progression is a mistake. This is a good EA, which used with sensible money management, can be very successful.

All these factors can have a bearing on the overall success of using this EA.[/quote] Hi, first of all I must say I am using the 4.1 version, I use only on EURUSD at 5 m, and I didn't cutted the levels, I left as the standard version. the problem is with 3000€ if you have 0.2lots and tp as 10€. the sum os the loss of 0.2 plus 0..4 plus 0.8 when cames 1.6 and still loosing the account came down. So for my thoughts I think if you have 10000, 3 times more than this demo account you will survive to the 4th or 5th level. it is almost impossible to this pair to go more than 150pip without retracement. And because this EA works whem the signal is overbought or oversold means that you already had some retracement or so.

I can't say that I'm making money in the long run with this EA as, I've only been using it for 3 months.

Hi Al, for me the most promisse EA it is this on, I did a lot of tests with others, like Blessing 3, Piplite, Phoenix, The Master Mind some from Forex World Contests and the results never were like swb Grid 4.1 from is creator without modifications in the original strategy. Actually I am making new tests with this EA in different brokers to see what with another pair, I am testing also with different profits, lower profits to see if is good for someone who wants to do little investmensts like &gt;1500€ and if is better than the money in the bank. I will soon post all my tests. But so far my demo tests are very promissing, I did a lot of tests that blowed up accounts but was because I test to extreme... I'm stil testing because is not only 2 or 3 or even 6 months that certifies me that this EA is good, but so far it is one of the best EAs that I tested until today. cheers Carlos

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Yes, I'm still using it looking for a way to avoid a Level 7 blow out. I tried limiting the EA to no higher than L3 but, this reduced the profit too much. I've experimented with a Hedging strategy as well. To be honest, that was a waste of time. The key to making money with this is all about lot size to account size. Accept that the occasional pair will blow up. As long as this doesn't, also, blow your account; no problem.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
I wonder what happened. I made a backtest for 2008 and the EA just crashed. Eventhough the initial investment is 30K$, beggining lot is 0.1 and the profit in money is 10$ but still crashed. Any idea why did it crash so badly?? See attachement please.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Thank you Alan and Carlos. I will continue to poke along with a demo and some settings I made yesterday on GBPUSD, with or without the Hedge on M5 and M1. The tests look OK on my dukas tick data for the past year. I just need confidence that the EA will do what my settings want, and then see if I need changes as I go along. A couple of weeks on demo will be enough for me to decide. Meanwhile, I've started reading about Blessing, which seems to be well-organized and supported, with ongoing development by good people, so we'll see how that goes. Al

Hello Justin. You went to 8 levels, so you got a crash. It's all in your settings. If you had a $10M account with a proportionally similar lot size, it would do the same thing. So you must find settings and lot size to get past the difficult area, with an account balance that is in harmony. Such is martingale trading, and it's very risky. Al

--- 帖子 #451 ---
I assume "crash" is referring to an account blow out? Most of us who have used this, for any length of time, are aware that the TP is all over the place. Once the EA fires trades in at Level 2 and above, it's unable to calculate the correct TP. There's a few other quirks as well and, therefore, a good chance that your backtesting was distorted by the EA's inability to take profits at the right time.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Just wonder what settings others are using? This EA seems to be great, so far I am running it on DEMO for just over 1 month. I am using default settings and only changed TP_IN_MONEY to 25. Check out my MT4live statement. Using v4.1

--- 帖子 #453 ---
In order to increase the profit potential of this EA, you might consider adding another pair or even more.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Absolutely, the account just blew out. Reading through Carlos replies, he suggests that an account of 10K$ should be sufficient to withstand the worst scenarios using EURUSD. But my back testing for 2008 which is supposed to be the worst year and with a 30K$ account still it could not withstand the higher levels and simply went down the drain. Surprisingly I had a look at the back test done by Carlos for the same year (2008) and he managed to get excellent results with a 10K account. That is why I raised my concern. I am seriously considering going live with this EA for a 30K investment but I was put off after seeing the back test for 2008. Carlos, I would appreciate your comments here please.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Hi Justin, first 10$ for 0.1Lot is too much, should be 5$. second backtest is good for getting the idea of what could happen, but I don't trusth on backtests, I prefer the forward tests and I can tell you that we already had some situations like 2008 and didn't blow up. We had situations with &gt;150pips moves and didn't make any bad. I guess the problem with backtests is, you never have the right historic. you have the time and how the candlestick closes but never the right movement of that candlestick, in my tests I use 5M timeframe and believe me in 5 minutes you have a lot of moves sometimes... and that doesn't appear on your historic. Truth is I am making tests with this EA since I've noticed by this thread and so far I have good forward tests results... I have different brokers, because not only the spread they have but to see the differents real time candlesticks. I have different amounts and some different Pairs, but my majority is on EURUSD. I've started testing with lower amount again, 3000€ but using 0.03lot and a profit of 1.5€ I guess with this I can get around 400€ per month. But I will present my results at the end of one month test. cheers Carlos

Naxz, Chart looks grate. How did you make it? would you please post you settings. What pair? Time frame? Thanks

--- 帖子 #458 ---
I may have missed this in the all the posts but how can you set this to close all trades once your in a profit. eg if it drops to the 4 level and rebounds up to the 3rd level and overall your in profit, how can I get it to close out everything?

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Hi Shripsfx, Good to see this little EA still going well, although I think it needs supervision and maybe turning off during news events. It all depends on your trading style. The easiest way to close a bunch of trades when in profit is to open EA properties box and set the USE SL &amp; TP to false and then change the TP in money to an amount that is less than the profit you have. The EA will then close the trades on that currency. I usually run it with the USE SL &amp; TP box set to false and use the TP in money setting. Pipernet

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Care to post your SET file? Or share settings? I am using v.41 and everything is default except for tp_in_money I changed to 25. Seems to be working out quite well, even though such a high number using 0.1.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
i have test this ea from 2 month .... my question is .... top of risk is 6,40 .... ( start 0,10 ... 0.20 ... 0.40 ... 0,80 .... 1.60 ... 3.20 ... 6.40 ) .... someone has gone over? what is the minimum investment or risk the entire share capital?

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Hi Yu1976, I left all the levels and it never wents more than the 7th level on EURUSD, but for that I still say it is necessary to have a good account, 10000€/$/£ or more, of course you must know your leverage also...

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Hi piper, For me a system that is based on Martingale should not really have a fixed dollar amount for TP. I think that what I suggested in my prior post is a good return for risk. Martingales can blow your account so you should expect high returns. Need someone to code this if possible. Eg if price hits level 4 then close all trades if prices rebound to L3. In this case you will be profitable Cheers

--- 帖子 #464 ---
I was searching on my files that I saved to get a historic on my demos and on my demo account with 10000€, Lot 0.2, TP at 10€ I've got a maximum of 3.2 lots didn't pass this level yet. This is on an Alpari account. I have another account on Ava Fx with 100000€ demo, my Lot size is 1.5 and my TP is 150€ , its reached to 48 lots twice (you must see the propotion of the amount). Ava has 3pips spread and Alpari is around 1.5 pips spread...

Well done Carlos This is what I have been waiting for. I will do some analysis for each month before jumping in with real money. A quick scan through the attachment gives the impression that this EA is quite promising provided you get the right combination of starting lot size and TP-in-money. Carlos, can you please share the complete details of your settings? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
It's not really about how well it does in backtesting. The key is getting the balance right between account size, levels, lot size, number of pairs traded, range,TP and multiplier. If your account size can take it, the more pairs you can trade, the better.

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Alan, What you’ve said is absolutely true and that is what I believe Carlos has tried to do in his backtest. Just have a look at the attached image which is a summary of Carlos backtest for 22 months. With an investment of 3000$, an initial lot size of 0.03 and TP of 5$ on EUR/USD the account survived very well for 22 months without blowing out. It has made a return of 134% during 2009 and so far in 2010 a return of 85%. These figures are quite encouraging and give an indication of how the account may behave in the forward test.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
[quote=tommycz;4171977] It worked, Thanks!

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Did you try in 2007/2008? If there is a short term eexit strategy like exit end of day with minimal loss then it may work... but that may stop it from being profitable in the first place. When I modified the code it always found a way to crash during the high range days... it may be back to those days soon. So just wondering if anyone has tested for the that... not 2009/2010 which has been good so far.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Hi CCanadas, Temmycz, I read all your information and your blogs Thank you for your live useful information If I will open demo FXOpen 500$ cent account, what is the balance has display in this account balance and fxopen has allow minimum lot size is 0.1, can you give more details, ea setting please CCanadas! I an very thank full for your info Have a Blessed day to U bye ajentha

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Hi ajentha, with a low account like you want you don't get any settings to fit on it. you should have around 1000$ to get at minimum of 50cents per entry for a 0.01lot... Remember you will get around 100$ per month with this amount... cheers Carlos

Hi Please any one out there who can code TStop , TStep, BE, Lot multiply when we hit stop loss and increment TP for each lot when market go against us in Swb Grid With these code this ea can be very profitable but code must be good should not have any error when back test it Thanks every one

Hi CCanadas, I think, if deposit 500$ fxopen broker micro account, it display 50,000 balance for account, I'm not sure?, so that I ask for your advice So I can use EURUSD, EURGBP, GBPUSD all has minimum lot size of 0.1 lot, TP is 5, these can low risk and per month we can get profit 10$ (1000 cent) please can you give for more advice Thanks CCanadas bye ajentha

Hey folks, I have a new version of swb stealth . It's setup to use multiple time frames on RSI and you have the option between market orders and pending orders. Feel free to test and discuss the results here if you like or, in the other thread. Whichever you prefer. Thanks. ETA: Getting faulty sell signal on M15 TF ... changed code. Also added indicator. Plus fixed bug due to incompatibility with original code. If download says 15.0 KB, it should be most current.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
If anyone has downloaded the EA in last post and attempted to get it to work, I was getting a faulty sell signal on M15 time frame and had to change code so, you might want to try downloading it again. It should work better now.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Hi, Thank you

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Hi guys, as you know I'm still using the original swb GRID and yesteday EURUSD was sold for about 7 hours and swb GRID didn't blow up any of my demo accounts. actually I was affraid about my AVAFx demo account because it is one of the brokers with 3 pips/spread, but it opened 7 positions, because I have 400:1 leverage and the retracement at the end of 237pips make this EA winner. swb GRID opened fist position 70 pips after the fall this meas it had to work with 167pips fall. The good thing is AVAFx has 400:1 and let me open 10 levels if I have 10000€ and 0.2lot and 10€ in profit, I started test more agressively,but nevertheless it only opened 7 levels . In other way on ITFX in which I have 100:1 leverage opened to the 6th level, on this one, my setups are 0.3lots to 15€ profit for 10000€ account. as we see when we have a big fall we will have a good retracement and that it was make this EA a good winner. I already watch EURUSD fall down in a matter of minutes, 90 pips and the retracement as almost the same, at this moment EURUSD is going down and already opened 3 levels and seems to me that it will stop for now on Daily Support 1. I still testing this EA in different ways and pairs I want to stay on tests for more 6 month or so, at the end I will do a statement of my work. Cheers Carlos

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Thank you ccanadas, You are correct, see my attachment, I will deside very shortly go to live cent account, can you give about this EA up and downs Minimum anount and lot ratio, please bye ajentha

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Hi ajentha, if you choose to have a nano account you should have attention that will give you peanuts... but again you should know if your broker has a nano or micro account, that means if you use a nano account as instatrader do you should see that 1 lot there it is the same of a 0.1lot in a standard account and that also means that if you use a 0.01lot on insta you really are using as 0.001lot on standard and that doesn't exist on those accounts. So if you want to open a 500$ account your profit in mney should be 0.5 and your 0.01lot on standard accounts. Becarful again with which broker you will use. cheers, Carlos

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Hi carls ok, I will check and confirm why am I asking about this EA, you only give more confidence about this EA, it has move with in 10 level it will return back, so 10 000$ account can enough for trading for all market condition So that I will check in cent account, from starting to till date your EA going well thanks ajentha

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Hi ajentha, I forgot to tell about the leverage, you must know how much it is your leverage broker, if it is 100:1 it is good enough, but if you have 50:1 or less this could be a failure. for this EA you must have at least 100:1. cheers Carlos

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Thank for your comment, My Broker is 500:1 leverage, is it ok? for cent account! Then I am looking for more time, TP is 5, so in the volatile market time, if TP is reach 5, EA start close all martingale order, but that time price has changed, so final profit is negative, this is not all time but in volatile time only, Can add in this EA, Steve manage trade technique has add in this EA, So Break even has 5$ if pair has move in favorable jumping stop has move, increase the profit Please suggest bye ajentha

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Hi ecTrade, Thank you for the new version. I am trying to figure out variables by backtesting swb stealth for a few days but I don't fully understand them. Would you explain the variables?

--- 帖子 #490 ---
If you follow the link and read posts 65, 70 and 74, that pretty much explains it. Also, I hadn't quite figured out the issue with the "suspended" trades, although I thought I had fixed it. It's hard to tell, because once a major trend occurs, it may take a long time for conditions to reoccur (RSI-D1 rises to "52"), where it will place a trade in the opposite direction (at least while backtesting). This ultimately needs to be addressed. The problem was occurring when deleting the secondary or tier 2 pending orders when they were out of range, which it would do. But, it wouldn't reopen them, once the signal occurs telling them to do so. While basically the same mechanism exists on the primary or tier 1 pending orders (initial orders), and it works just fine. Anyway, come to find out I had to add a separate reset for the secondary orders, similar to the one on the primary orders. I thought I could use the same one for both, but no, they are triggered at different levels. Here is the updated version attached. It appears to have fixed this problem anyway, although it's still necessary to come up with a better exit strategy ... which is in the works. ETA: Fixed problem where rsi_tier_2 wasn't deselected after set to false ... separate issue.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Here is a picture of my latest backtest on the EURUSD. I performed a similar backtest here , although I made a few modifications (which have yet to be released) and changed a few settings. Basically it crapped out in early December 09, and didn't place any new trades until April, when it placed a few, and finally picked up again in July when it fully recovered, only to completely crap out in mid August. At least it shows the former "reset" issue is resolved, because there was nothing during this recovery period before.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Hey, the picture is not as bad as it looks. As I already said, it initially crapped out in early December, and it began to recover in early July. And, since there were only a few trades between these two periods, they basically show up on the same place on the chart. This is just part of the limitations of the results when bactesting. So yeah, the price did fall, and continued to do so for nearly seven months (almost 2000 points altogether), until the D1 trend finally reversed, and a flurry of trading resumed thereafter.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Here's another test which ran from 6-17-2009 to 12-02-2010. Ultimately it didn't crap out at all, although it was down by nearly 1200 points (from initial or top trade) at the end of the test. Of course this is something you can't tell while baktesting, unless it closes out a trade during the test. While it had been nearly a month, since 11-09-2010, when the last trade closed out. This is another drawback while backtesting. However, I didn't blow the whole account or get a margin this time, and this is working with 50:1 leverage. Last time, when working with 100:1 (several months ago), I couldn't get past May before blowing the whole account. So, that's a little encouraging.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Hi, Which version Back test was margin call? Stealth mode SWB is very slow, I stooped testing bye ajentha

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Guys, once again, this EA didn't blew up my demo accounts, I still believe these kind of days are the worst cases that we have in our trading days. I don't know what you guys are doing with the modified version, did you guys got good entry yesterday? Cheers Carlos

--- 帖子 #496 ---
yes, you are correct, Modified is not good thank you bye ajentha

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Based on my calculations with the following assumptions: Leverage = 400 Initial Lot size = 0.01 Distance between trades = 30 pips a 5K account will take you upto level 10 as you can see in the attached image. I have done extensive experiments for the past 3 years data and the maximum level reached was level 8 with TP-in-money of 5$. I must say I was only testing EUR/USD and nothing else.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Here is my monopoly money experiment. Pure martingale. I haven't traded it everyday. It would have been over $500 000 if i traded it fulltime. With a balance of $300 000 as it is now , i belief one cannot lose anymore.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
hi all, spend some time reading and want to share some thoughts. am i the only one who thinks is a crime to collect only fraction of a pip on a trade who take sometimes days and levels around 10 ?!? i really thing that to show his potential Martingale needs TP IN multiplayer!!!the best way to do IMO is a simple rule in the code wish says "when TP in pounds is hit wait for x(custom) number of more pips to close the trade". I would like see simplest version of SWB 4.1 with added: 1..above said TP multiplayer. 2..delay in seconds(custom) before opening new level. 3..new filter--trade in direction of a MA(custom)wish can collect data from different time frame. you can call that babe "SWB MPM"(money printing mashine) english is not my native so enjoyed special thanks to ecTrade! open to critics

--- 帖子 #500 ---
hi, new to trying this one out. anybody know what is the best time frame and settings to use for this? thanks

--- 帖子 #501 ---
It depends on your appetite for risk. The more pairs you have the EA running on, the more money you will make. However, the more chance you have of coming up against a pair that trends all day and makes a large hole in your account. If you look at Justin's table (post # 497), this will give you an idea of what can happen. I ran the EA for several months, on a 5 min tf. using a 25 pt range. It worked fine during the summer months when there wasn't a lot of trend. Since then, I have run into several pairs that went into a trend, without a retracement, and suffered the consequences. I have now stopped using the EA.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
have you had any luck changing the settings

--- 帖子 #503 ---
The excessive risk remains whether you use a 10 pip or a 100 pip range.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
This morning's huge drop in Sterling is a perfect example of how your account can get killed using this EA, especially if you were trading multiple pairs with £. Your long counter trend trades were triggered well before the GDP data. This is an occasion where staying out of the market, just before news releases, wouldn't have been relevant.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Hi everyone, I am still using this EA, the original, 4.1 and still very profitable. I only using with good results on EURUSD, I have tested on EURGBP, GBPCHF and blowed up the accounts, I used on GBPUSD but the results weren't so good as EURUSD. I have backtested from 2007 to dec. of 2010 every month and the results were very good, I have on demo from june, and different brokers with different leverages, and still very good, max level that is opened was 7. for that you have to get a good leverage, and I mean that you must have over 100:1, for me the best should be 400:1, I have tests on AVA, Alpari and Forex.com now, and so far still running well, of course I did some brutallities with this EA, for example using 10000$ for 0.3 lots and 15 for TP_IN_MONEY, and that blowed up the account. I still feel the same about this EA, as I posted before, it is very good for EURUSD, and you must use 0.1 lot with 5 tp_in_money for 10000$ and 5m TF. Of course is up to you if you must use this on real or not.... cheers

Hi Carlos, I am new to forex and reading this thread decided to try this Ea today (10am gmt) on the original setting of 4.1. eur/usd tf 5mm. So far no trades open on my demo, have I done something wrong?. I have read your comments on this thread with interest, thank you for your advice. Peter 19.21,19.25 Just opened 2 winning buy trades.!!!!!.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
I have been demoing various versions of this ea on and off for some months now. However in the meantime I have also devised my own strategy which I have been trading manually. I don't want to hijack this thread and therefore wil be happy to open a new thread if I can get the help I need to finish the ea coding. I have got a basic ea based on a MACD strategy which manually has worked very well. Having conducted visual backtests I reckon it could work on most timeframes. However like any strategy despite the signals a trade will start to go wrong. I think this could benefit from the martingale approach with this ea (albeit with a slight tweak). Anyway, apologies for going off subject but if there are any coders out there who think they could help pm me and I will send you the details. If we can get the ea to work right we can setup a seperate thread. Many thanks Paul

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Hi Paul, Sounds interesting, especially if your strategy can help make this martingale EA a little safer to trade. Please post details of how you trade manually with MACD and where you would martingale in your startegy. Regards, Pipernet

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Pipernet I have attached the basic EA which I built. The strategy is fairly simple. A buy trade is opened provided 1. MACD value is negative on the current candle, and 2. MACD value of previous candle was greater (closer to 0) than the MACD signal, and 3. MACD value of 2 candles back is less than MACD signal The EA attached has a stop loss feature, however it defaults to false although this could be used as an emergency stop loss. Similarly the trailing stop feature may not be needed. A sell trade is simply the opposite of the above. Take profit can depend upon which timeframe you use. I used this manually on GU for about a month on the one minute chart during working hours here in the UK and it was successful. When trading manualy I used a recovery system based on Nanningbobs recovery process which involved placing trades about 150 pips away. This got me thinking rather than randomly entering trades xx pips away, why not simply enter a martingale trade when the next trade setup appears. On the smaller timeframes this may mean several trades close together but upon examining various charts they would certainly get you out of the trades. On the 1 min charts I was using a tp of 5 pips. With regards to combining it with SWB I like the fact that we can set our own increments, stealth features and the take profit in money. Another add on might be a start and end time for trading. I hope what I haev said above makes sense as my children keep running about distracting me. Hopefully you can help, like i said this looks profitable on visual backtests but it would be great if we could put it into an EA to see what the maximal dd is. Thanks Paul

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Hi Paul, Ok here you go. This EA has your MACD strategy plugged in to the body of the SWB EA. Just a first draft, but doing the job. I have used one of ecTrades versions of SWB - his version with the hedge option built in. He has done some great additional work on the original SWB. Just leave hedge set to false to run it normally. I have run a few quick back tests on EU &amp; GU on 1H frame (1Nov to today) with the range set to 90. The tests show that there are a few occasions when the EA can still get caught in a big drawdown when it is activated by a small down dip in the MACD and then followed by a strong up trend. But then again there are times when all EAs need to be managed. Interesting strategy, maybe you have some ideas on how to refine it further? Enjoy the kids. Regards, Pipernet.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Hi Peter, sorry to reply just now, I was out for a while. I have tested in some brokers that for some reason the EAs doesn't work well. For example, in InstaTrader only open a few times and looking for other brokers it is obvious that doesn't work with other EAs or even some particular codes... I've tested in Ava Fx, Alpari, FXCM and still working well. I hope this can halp you. another thing, see if you didn't change any indicator value in the EA config box, but if you not sure, reset the config box. Cheers, Carlos

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Hi Paul, I have been carrying out more tests using your strategy - using 25 range and 90 range on EU and GU on 5min and 1H back tests. Some tests look good. I see a problem when the MACD is close to zero and just swinging between positive and negative in periods of low volatility. I have added a filter so that EA will only look for setups above or below a certain MACD level. Level can be set in inputs tabs but needs to be set at a suitable level for each pair and timeframe traded. Just doing it visually at the moment. I have to fess up and say I just know enough programming to be dangerous, more a cut and paste man myself, maybe some of the very talanted programmers we have here could work out how to automate the levels for the MACD as per the sixths EA so that once the MACD is in the upper sixth of the MACD screen it will start to look for sells as per your rules and do the the opposite for the times that the MACD is in the lower sixth of the screen. Thanks for your idea, let's see how it goes. Pipernet

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Hi Pipernet Thanks for your help so far, I didn't expect it to be done so quick. I got a chance in work today to run a couple of backtests. I found the 1 min chart using 0.01 lots with a 10 k account produced over a six month period a return of about 12% with drawdown of about 6.4% this was using a range of 20. I had thought about a minimum value which can be changed depending on the chart. At the moment using a range seems to be working fine but I was also wondering if we could simply add increasing trades as and when a new signal is given. This may not be as good as the range setting so might be one to revisit later. The sixths idea would be fantastic so hopefully someone can pick that idea up and run with it. I am useless at coding so certainly doing something complex is best left to the experts. I will get more of a chance to run some backtests tonight using the new version. Once again thanks for all your help - maybe this one will be a runner.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Hi Paul, I note your point about the EA only adding a subsequent trade if the conditions are the same as for the 1st level i.e. the MACD again dipping or rising according to your criteria. So here is an EA for testing using above strategy. Basically it still uses Range (I have range =40 in this example) but combined with a check on the MACD for each level. After the price has moved a certain Range from the first entry trade, then the code checks the MACD for a confirming signal before entering a second and subsequent level. Result is less draw down. Working well on GbpUsd 15 min backtested over the last six months. It can be set up to trade more aggressively by changing the Upper &amp; Lower MCAD filters. Testing of course required. On to something here for relaxed and stress free trading if set up correctly. Cheers, Pipernet

Pipernet Thats for that. I have run some backtests on the last version on daily timeframe with a range of 200. Results were good for GU, EU, USDCHF however GBPJPY blew up. I will hopefully get testing this version more over the weekend and report next week. Paul

Pipernet I am hoping we are on to something here. I have managed to do various backtests on everything from 1 min chart up to daily. I have found some decent settings however there is more often than not one bad trade lurking. I am running tests from 2007 to look at the long term potential. I have two suggestions which I hope will get around the odd bad trade if you have time to consider them. 1. To close all trades upon an opposite signal.. It may be an idea to have a min macd value for this or have it user defined. The reason I suggest this is that some trades may trmain open long since the initial trade trigger and the momentum may have changed. This will obviously result in the odd loss but at least we can get out and move on to the next hopefully profitable trade. 2. When using the daily charts, I have had to set the range quite high to prevent the ea placing second and third trades on the same candle. Is it possible to adjust the code so that subsequent trades can't be on the same candle. The problem I have noticed is that a second signal may only be 30 or 40 pips higher, however if we were able to take the second trade there would be sufficient movement in our favour to close out the trades for profit, yet if the range is set at a much higher setting say 200 it never takes the second trade and we end up going more into drawdown. Ideally I would use as small a range as possible but if I do that at present it simplly places lots of trades on the same candle (saying that it was still profitable). I hope you can make these changes as you have been a great help so far and I don't think we are too far off. I will keep testing with these changes and post the results for various timeframes if it looks like we have something. Thanks for your help Paul

This version only uses the MACD minimum filter on the first trade. It then palces subsequent trades at reentry points without reference to the min filter. So far in backtests it seems to be able to close out some of the longer trades quicker for less drawdown. So far finding good settings on 1 min chart - see attached set file

Pipernet- I found this SWB while doing research on grid trading and I find it remarkable, right before it hits the "death trade." I know there are a ton of much smarter people than me on this forum, but I think I have a simple solution to make the original SWB function the way everyone wants it to. This will make it the "holy grail" that everyone says doesn't exist. I can only think there MUST be a reason nobody has thought of it yet. It is to add a hedge trade, but not the way the ectrade hedge version does it. Here is how it should work. Options to be added on the EA: Allow_hedging = 0/1 (or true/false) Activate_hedging_level = 4 (level at which to being the hedge trade) Hedge_pip_lockin = 1 (amount of pips to lock in profit the hedge trade) Hedge_lockin_after = 10 (amount of pips to go before the lockin is activated) Hedge_stop_loss = 5 (amount of pips for the stop loss – just in case the hedge trade is activated, but not enough to lock in. The idea isn’t to make money off the hedge by using a take profit or a trailing stop on the hedge trade, it is just for big loss minimization. The last hedge trade version took profit at each level and kept adding levels. Here is how it will work. Example - The EA is has fired it's level 3 trade and drops another 25 pips. Instead of firing the usual 4 level martingale trade, hedge trade activates at the same lot size a normal 5 level would be (skipping 4). After 10 pips, the hedge lockin of 1 pip is activated, which also moves the hedge stop loss to the lockin value. The hedge trade will close 1 of 2 ways. 1) if the hedge trade makes the required pips to cover the other 3 levels (25 pips or so), then it closes all of them, just like it would do if the price did it's 25 pip retrace. 2) or if the price retreats activating either the stop loss or the lockin of the hedge trade. If the price continues to retrace, the EA will close the other 3 levels like normal operation. If the price reverses and all of the criteria is met again, then the hedge trade will activate again. And repeat…… If someone wanted to activate the hedge trade after the level 2, then it would skip level 3 and the lot size for the hedge would be a level 4. This would be VERY low draw down. I think you can't lose doing this, but I can't program this in to test it. You win regardless of which way the price moves while keeping your draw down low. Also, since you are stopping at a much smaller level, you can start with bigger lot sizes. What do you think? Can you add this for me/everyone? Or do you know anyone that can? I think everyone is afraid of martingale, but this is like having "martingale insurance" on the "death trade".

Hi guys, long time I don't post anything here, but that doesn't mean that I left the tests or this wonderful EA, and I keep it the original. As you can see in other posts I have managed a few different brokers demo accounts with this EA. I must say I took it to the limit. Some of those accounts blowed up but others still working after 8 months testing everyday. I must say I have two PCs only working on this kind of stuff. Of course with different EAs also. I must say the accounts that blowed up were the ones that I started with 3000€ with the standard settings. the one still open and running for about september 2010, is the one I have tested with the standard settings for 10000€. Saddly some of the demo accounts expired but this one on AVA Fx still up and still running well. I got my break even this month after started in september. I started with &lt; 82000€ beucause other EAS left this 100000€ account on that level. right now I got &gt;182000€, I am sad because this is not real money, lol. I still believe with an brker that gives you over 400.1 with the standard settings (0.1 lot; tp_in_money 5; account with 10000) still very nice to work with. I never saw this EA goes over 7th level, the ugliest days passed in November with &gt;230 pips down, didn't blowed up. Pay attention that I am using this on EURUSD only. I tested other currencies but didn't get the good results that I have with this one. The good thing of this EA it is that works on oversold/overbought, and that means only after 60/70 pips after any movement it gives the signal to buy or sell. so you have a pillow of almost 70 pips with out trading in any direction. So if we have a direction with 250 pips without retracement you will get on this EA a direction of 180 pips agains't to you, and this gives you 7 levels. I know that it is a little bit scary but, truth is you always have 90% of the time only one level, on other times is going almost only to 4th level. I guess it is good to try toget this ea less scary but, so far what I see it is only a few backtests and nothing on forward tests. For me this EA it is good as it is. Cheers

Okay, I'm looking at this and see one problem: Once the lockin point is set and price swings back to close hedge at lockin point, what's to keep it from opening new hedge when it drops to point where first hedge opened? (1 point lower?) If that happens, and it goes on to retrace with new hedge open, it won't do any good. I suppose you could specify a reset point after so many pips but, if you don't reach it and the price reverses, you're still going to find yourself vulnerable.

--- 帖子 #522 ---
You might have heard of the Blessing EA, which is probably the best free grid trading EA available, hedging is included as an option in this but nobody has found settings that work, and there are quite a lot of people working on it. Hedging sounds good but difficult to make work. And locking in 1 point and stop loss at 5 points as suggested by the guy above, which broker is going to allow you to do that. Anyway take a look at Blessing there might be some code you can use for your EA. http://www.jtatoday.info/forum/

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Hi ecTrade, I see your point re reset of the hedge if it closes at a 1 pip hidden take profit point. Maybe consider case where we include the spread of 2 pips then the price will be 3 pips above the previous buy point. Might be worth looking at not having the next attempt at a hedge start a trade until the price has moved say +10 pips above the first trigger point. So if we are stepping at 25 per trade and hedging after three levels, hedge kicks in at 100 pips of a loss and 2x the last lot size, hedge locks in and closes out for 1 pip profit, market reverses and we want another hedge, so next attempt at hedging will be at the 110 pips loss. Problem of course is if the market is just bouncing around and opens and closes a series of these trades then the hedge trade could just get too far away from the first three levels to be useful? Regards, Pipernet.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Or, maybe have it open a new hedge at 10 pips above, like you say, with a reset point 10 pips below, so it opens new hedge at original level? That might be do-able. Yes.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Okay, this is a revised version of the original SWB. I restructured ordering process to make it easier to modify. It should maintain same functionality, however. Although you folks might want to check it out to see if it works to your satisfaction. It also includes previous version of hedge, plus h_top_level , which allows you to select level to shut hedge off. It may actually come in handy with this other idea we're talking about.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Ectrade- The idea of stepping the entry of the hedge I think is a good idea. Is it doing that now? From what I can see during the backtest, although it seems to be working fine, it is not what I had in mind. I was thinking that when the hedge trade pulled enough pips to break even, it closed all of the trades at the same time. The way it is currently running creates a ton of draw down and it seems to be working just like the other hedge version works. You should only need 1 hedge trade, and that is the last one. Here you can see 5 hedge trades were fired while keeping the original BUY trades open. (I have it set to only 7 levels deep, so that is why it didn't fire anymore) I do think your way will make more actually money, but I am getting some huge draw down spikes. If I am running this on 10 different charts I think the less draw down will be very important. Let me know what you think. See screenshot. http://i368.photobucket.com/albums/o...ge_example.jpg

Pudsey- Yes - I have heard of Blessed, and I agree it has some serious math involved. It is extremely impressive. However, in my tests it still has the dreaded death trade on some currencies. Here are some backtests using the Blessed EA: The USDJPY looks good with default settings: http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...djpy-2year.jpg EURUSD, Not so much with default settings: http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...rusd-2year.jpg EURUSD, using the same settings found on the website: http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...SETTINGS-1.jpg This SWB grid I believe has the potential to run great on all currencies if we can implement this hedge feature. (at least on paper it should work)

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Domino, I hope you are successful with your hedging work. I was merely pointing out that hedging is available in Blessing but not been succesful upto now, though the guys are still working on it. And yes it does have some serious code in it. I don't think any EA will overcome the death trade including Blessing, but its how you manage it, and Blessing has options to prevent total blow out and protect some of your account. Anyway this thread is not about blessing and I wish you well with your work on your EA. And if your hedging works maybe the Blessing group can also learn something.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
No, as I said in previous post , I just restructured ordering process so it was easier to modify. And, since I intend to use it to implement this new hedge idea (am still working on it), I thought folks might want to check it out to make sure it works correctly. And yeah, it has basically the same functionality as the original SWB, with the hedge.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Hey, I tried your idea with the initial 5 point SL, but I kept hitting it so many times (one right after the other) while backtesting that all it did was erode my balance, in no time. So I tried testing it without it and set SL to break even point (OrderOpenPrice()) after 5 point positive swing with much better results. Of course if break even point doesn't get set, and price swings the wrong way, you start losing money as a result of the hedge. In which case I suggest making the hedge lots equal to the total non-hedge lots. So, now all you have to do is try to find a way to get out of the hedge. Of course this isn't always easy either but, if the majority of trades closeout at level 3 (with hedge set at level 4), you are still making a profit and closing out the hedge (once set) may not need to be quite so exact? I also think you should open the hedge at same point as last level (without skipping a level), because the longer you wait to hedge, the bigger the drawdown gets. One thing that might help (which I am trying) is to trigger hedge using rsi filter, to ensure it has momentum to get past break even point. Or, maybe there are better filters here? Another thing I think would only help is to add a trailing stop to hedge, to help insure you get some profit out of it. Then, after hedge closes out, via break even, trailing stop or, TP, it should be set and ready to open a new hedge, via rsi settings. That, I think, should pretty much cover all the bases. Except of course if break even point doesn't get set and price swings the wrong way. But, maybe we could try something similar (with rsi filter) here?

--- 帖子 #531 ---
EC- Have you tried opening the gap up a little bit? Meaning....when the hedge fires (say level 4), it put a 15 pip stop loss (instead of 5) in case of emergencies. Then if it goes the right direction, maybe you could trail it up to break even. Or once it hits a 5/10 positive swing, it moves it to break even. But, that way you aren't left open. I haven't seen any indicators that seem to call it right. The RVI seems ok, but it has flaws. I was checking to see if there was a cross after level 3, it could be the signal to enter, but it doesn't look that good. Maybe the RSI if it is above/below 80/20 after the 3rd level or something. That seems like it actually might work. It would probably work as an exit also. If the RSI crosses below/above 70/30 then exit hedge trade. Do you think you can make the hedge trade a multiplier option? That way we could backtest it and see if keeping the same or bumping it up would work better. Maybe something like: Hedge_multiplier =1 (1 means it will fire the total of non-hedge lots as default. Then we could test 1.5x 2x, 2.5x etc) As for the trailing stop, I guess we can try it. I haven't had very good luck with them though. I usually get closed out on a retrace, then the price continues and I am not in! Would the hedge trade fire again at that point? My original thought was so it would never go more than 4-5 levels deep (instead of 7-10). The hedge trade wasn't really designed to take profit. It is designed to protect the account from the "death trade". I thought it would just go enough pips to make your "tp_in_money" over the other level losses and close all of the other previous level trades. The bigger the hedge trade lot size, the fewer pips you have to grab to make your "tp_in_money" and you move on. You would be out of the trade and you don't have to worry about the potential level 10 scenario. That way I would feel comfortable using much bigger lot sizes from the start if I knew I couldn't get closed out due to lack of margin. If the hedge trade takes a small loss because it got stopped out, maybe we take a little more pips to make up for it when the other 3 levels close out? If somehow you could tie that math together or something.....that would be nice! Obviously, the bigger the hedge trade lot size loss is, there is no way it can be made up for. But if you lost 15 pips on a .16 lot (level 5 on micro) = ~$24, then $24 + "tp_in_money" would be when the other 3 levels will close, instead of standard "tp_in_money". That might have to be an option so we can test it to see if it works. (Makeup_hedge_loss = True/False) If it's too much to make up on the remaining 3 levels, maybe the next trade makes it up or something. We can try the trailing stop as an option, that way we can test what works best. I am open for ideas.... Thanks a bunch!

Okay, this is just preliminary, I just thought folks might want to see what I've been up to the last day or two, and give them a chance to tweak around a bit. Boy, this was a pain in the butt! Instead of trailing stops, TP's, SL's and break-even points, I've decided to open and close hedge using RSI filter. So far so good! ... albeit it's far from perfect. It's a step in the right direction though. Currently hedge is set to level 3, start lot set to .25, tp_in_money set to $15.00 and hedge factor ( h_factor ) set to 35% of total non-hedge lots. Am also testing with 15M TF and $2,500 initial deposit. The opening RSI settings are 65 high and 35 low on 5M TF (internally), and closing settings are 40 low and 60 high. Currently these are not adjustable, but I will try and incorporate that within the next day or so. Am also using multi-TF RSI indicator which you will need to download below ... and save to indicator folder. domino , I will try and address some of your points later. Right now I need to get some sleep! Thanks. ETA: Added TP mod per post below.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Okay, I just added TP settings to EA. It's set to 120 pips default, although it's variable (between 30 pips and 120 pips), depending on RSI strength. I think it's kind of neat! If you downloaded EA earlier, you need to download it again if it was before edit stamp on post above. Oh, I set hedge factor (h_factor) to 70% this time. You can change it back if you like. I also changed RSI entry settings to 60 high and 40 low, as it was opening too many trades right towards end of spike. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
I'm new to this forum and I've been trying to get a good trending Ea but with limited success. Has anyone tried a Trending martingale? I have been manually trading a indicator with re-entrys an actual case study, I'm still in it at 12:00 noon EST-GBPUSD 1m chart . 1. Enter on Trend 10:53 Sht- 1.6186 - 0.01 2. enter again 11:18 1.6165 - 0.01 3. enter again 11:13 1.6165 - 0.01 4. Out 11:42 1.6118 +162 pips 5. Enter Trend Rev 11:42 LG- 1.6118 - 0.01 6. enter again 11:46 1.6165 - 0.01 7. enter again 11:47 1.6165 - 0.01 8. OUT 12:02 1.6165 +7 I hope this explains the thought. I'm not a programmer, does anyone have the ability to help program this EA. Thank You Ray

Traderduke- When you trade with the trend, it is called Anti-Martingale. This is when you add lots to your winning position instead of doubling down on a losing position, known as the martingale. However, you are not actually doing a martingale unless you double each lot size as you enter. Trading an anti-martingale can become risky because you can get in with your biggest lot size at the worst price and take the biggest loss, wiping out all of your other gains. I would check other threads regarding anti-martingale's, they might have something posted already. This thread is specifically about SWB Grid.

--- 帖子 #536 ---
EC- How is the hedge trade exiting the trade? Is it just variable TP or the closing of all of the trades? One or the other? As you see here, I think maybe if it had a RSI exit in addition to the TP exit, it could be much more effective. The 3 lines on the RSI are 60, 50 &amp; 40. I think if the entry was above 80 (it was about 83 in this picture at the point of entry) and the exit was a 60 cross, it would be pretty effective. It seems to exit with all of the other trades along with this hedge. The problem with this trade is all of the big winnings from the last sell trade are completely wiped out by the hedge trade closing at the same time. If the hedge trade would have closed sooner, it would have been a winner. I think if the hedge trades hits the TP line it should close all of the other trades with it. If it hits the RSI exit criteria, then only the hedge closes and the others remain open to close like normal. http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...e-example1.jpg The other huge issue is this one. I am sure you are working on it, but I am just bringing it up. The account ended up at zero because it kept firing hedge trades for 2 months and never closing the original buy trades. The hedge trade wins will have to be tied to the closing of the original trades after the "tp_in_money" it reached. As you can see here, the hedges made WAY more than the other trades open. If fact it more than doubled the account, but still ended up at zero because it was about a 1200 pip move over 2 two months. http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...ro-balance.jpg P.S. - I ran it with 7 levels and started the hedging at level 7 also. The default 4 was not enough. It would open trades and just continually fire hedge trades, similar to what ended the account in the above picture. Looking good.....almost there. Thanks, Domino

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Primarily I'm focusing on closing out the hedge, in an attempt to "pad" the profit, although it will fluctuate relative to the position of the hedge and where it closes out ... sometimes at a loss, because I've set a -10 point threshold (invisible SL), which is set after price rises above hedge open price and hits RSI cross on the way back down. Or else you can be in for a long wait if there's a 200-300 gap between the hedge open price and last non-hedge open price. This is basically the problem we have now. So, we have to try and find a way to minimize the gap or, at least close out the hedge when it is retracing. Also, so long as tp_in_money target is not reached, it will only close out the hedge trades. But, once tp_in_money is reached, it closes out all the trades and starts over again. One thing you can do you here, is allocate a certain percentage of hedge profit to be set aside, and not applied to tp_in_money, say, 25%? so, once everything does close out, you will realize that above and beyond the tp_in_money ... which could be a sizable chunk of change! So, you were not just sitting around waiting for nothing all this time. Oh, hedge is currently existing with both TP and RSI settings. If you set TP to 0, it will exit with RSI settings only. What I need to do is make user-definable inputs for RSI entry and exists, which I'm in the process of doing. That way, maybe you can try some of the things you're talking about above. Another thing to consider, which might be the real cincher here, is set it up to hedge 1 to 1, and treat both sides with same dynamics as the one side we are treating currently. That way you can close out whichever side peaks, and you don't have to wait forever for the price to swing back up and down. Heck, if we could do that, we might not even need the Martingale! We'll see.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
I think there may be bug here. Here you can see where it closes 7 levels deep on the original version. http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...EVEL-CLOSE.jpg Here is the hedge version starting 7 levels deep and it doesn't close the original trades. http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...EL-NOCLOSE.jpg Any idea why this would happen?

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Try seeing what happens if you turn the hedge off. If hedge is set to open at level 7, and it does, it probably won't close anything out until after hedge closes and it retraces. If that's not the problem, although I think it is, it could be because spread changed between backtests. That could potentially effect it as well.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
I will turn hedging off and let you know. It can't be the spread because there are at least 30 pips in there it could have closed on. I am running another backtest now so give me a couple hours. If that IS the case, then I think that would need to be changed. If the standard set of 7 trades are ready to close, there is no need for the hedge trade anymore. The hedge trade should close with them. UPDATE: Yes - if I turn off the hedging then it functions like the original. So, that means it needs to close with the rest of the trades as mentioned above.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
It's not going to go anywhere unless the tp_in_money target is reached. And if the hedge is open, it's going to offset that further. It still has to retrace so many points after opening level 7, and if you open the hedge at the same time, like I said, it's going to offset that further. This is one reason why the RSI should prove helpful (if we find the right setting? ), because it will delay opening the hedge if there's not enough momentum. That will all depend on the size of the hedge. If it were 1 to 1 or greater, it won't close at all.

--- 帖子 #542 ---
I see your point here, but this seems to only go one way. (I think) Meaning, if the hedge trade is activated (like in the previous example) then the location where it would normally be "tp_in_money" is now much lower due to the hedge trade. I can see that now. However, why does it not see it the other way. If the hedge trade is activated and hit the TP line and closes while leaving the other trades still open. I guess it depends on the hedge multiplier. Are you saying if the hedge trades make enough, maybe 2 or 3 trades with a low multiplier and the price hasn't gone too far, it will close the other trades with tp_in_money made? Is it possible I just haven't seen it yet and that is how it works? I don't think this is how it works because of my picture of the account hitting zero. I think it would need to "get last trade info" and keep adding up the hedge trades and when tp_in_money is hit, it closes all of the other ones. Then again, the price moved 1200 pips and maybe the hedge multiplier was too low to catch it. I will play with the RSI settings for a while when you make that configurable. UPDATE: Also, please make the time frame configurable. We may need it faster than 20. :-)

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Working with hedging is pretty tricky business. A lot of folks will argue that it can't be done or, it's of little or no use. This is basically why it's no longer allowed in the United States. Make the time frame configurable? Yeah, I suppose I can do that. Sounds like you might know a bit more about it than me though. I've pretty much learned how to access them, but don't fully understand how they work.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
The hedge TP line is static, while the tp_in_money target is dynamic. Plus, it has everything to do with how large the gap is between each side of hedge. The larger the gap, the more it goes against the tp_in_money. Ideally it's best to open the hedge with a minimum gap as possible (or within a range) and close it out when it looks like it's peaked, and hopefully you get a significant enough retrace to bridge the gap, at least towards the tp_in_money target anyway.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Yeah. The actual RSI math is tricky, but that isn't what this is. The 20 is just a rolling average (of that tricky math) of the last 20 bars. That might be a little too lagging for what we want . Maybe a 5-7 might be more accurate. But, if you make it too fast, it can be too jumpy. I would probably start with 10 and try to optimize from there.

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Okay, it looks like I have something workable here: Basically there are 7 configurable periods (TF_h_1 to TF_h_7), 3 for hedge entry, 3 for hedge exit, and 1 for RSI TP hedge exit. TF_h_1 to TF_h_7 basically correspond to the RSI "20" value you are talking about, plus there's a configurable time frame for each one of these ... 1M, 5M, 15M, etc. There's also the offset values which correspond to the number of points above and below the median, which is 50 (non-adjustable). For example, with an offset of 17, you get 67 high and 33 low. Am not sure if it's necessary or not? but you are allowed to use up to 3 periods on both hedge entry and hedge exit (TP) options. It appears to work on the hedge entry side, although only one period is selected currently (5M), but not on the hedge exit side. I don't know what's wrong here? So, temporarily I'm getting the signal from the RSI TP exit which is set to 5M. You might want to take that into account before adjusting it. As for the RSI TP settings, set rsi_tp to true, it you want to use them. While there are 4 adjustable TP settings and 4 correspondent offset settings to trigger them (rtp_off_1 to rtp_off_4). The top level TP can be found under the hedge settings. I hope this is not too confusing? Oh, don't be too surprised if there are one or two other bugs. ETA: Disabled feature that wasn't working ...

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Okay, that makes sense. Thanks. So, should I reset everything to 10 then?

--- 帖子 #548 ---
What if you make a tp_in_hedge_money? So- If we are running .01 lots and it fired 3 sell trades. You have a .01, .02 &amp; .04 open and 75 pips down. Then the hedge trade fires at level 4 and has a instantly puts a stop loss of 13 pips. (half the distance of the 25 pip levels) If it hits the stop loss, the hedge trade closes out and hopefully 20 minutes later the rest of the trades close, hitting your tp_in_money. Now the fun part come in......when it fires the hedge trade, it automatically calculates how big your lot size needs to be and how many pips it needs to go to reach your "tp_in_hedge_money"....and that is where it places it's TP. It will take into consideration all of the previous trades and it closes them all when hit. If the price reverses after the hedge trade hits the stop loss, it fires the hedge trade again and repeats. I think it may too hard to figure out the math to now make up for that loss in the new "tp_in_hedge_money" number, so we just live with that small loss for now. What do you think? Will that solve the problems?

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Not right now - let me take a look at what you have. I know how to change it if it is not configurable yet.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Oops! It looks like you'll have to redownload it . I was working on something else that was messing things up and forgot to disable it. Sorry.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
WOW - I think I am pretty confused. I misspoke earlier when I said "timeframe". I really meant the "period" only. But....I think I am getting it the longer I look at it.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Yeah, that's not too big where it's not recoverable, even if it happened two or three times in a row. It already has a stoploss built into it by the way (sl_threshold) which is currently set at 10 points. So, maybe if I set it up so RSI hedge entry is optional, and the hedge opens immediately after 4th trade is placed, that would accomplish it? In fact, I could probably knock that out in real short order here. Oh, so long as the gap is minimal, to say, less than 50 points? (accrued), the price wouldn't have to retrace too far in order to recover. Meaning we may not have to sustain a loss. Of course I'm just guessing. We'll have to try it out to see how it actually works.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Okay, it looks like the bug is still there. It's not working properly now. Will need some time to figure it out.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Take a look at my settings... I am not sure if this is a bug or not, but it didn't close my hedge trade the way I think it should. Here are my settings: http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...I-SETTINGS.jpg Here is where I think it should have closed. http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...OR-NOCLOSE.jpg Do I have them set right? I am just using the 1st time frame. Do I need to zero out the others?

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Why do you have offsett_1 set to 30? It should be set to 10 if you want it to cross at 40 and 60. The only thing you need to zero out are h_entry_2 and h_entry_3, if you don't intend to use them. But, they are already set to zero by default.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
I have it set to 30 on the entry, so it will fire above 80 or below 20. I have it set to 10 on the exit, so it closes if loses steam and crosses 60 &amp; 40. Is that not right? The entry was correct - I was more concerned about why it didn't close on the 40 with the 10 offset.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
It may be a long shot, but maybe that constant modifying the TP every second is hogging up all the bandwidth so when it goes to fire a trade, it's busy. I have seen a couple other places where it should work, because it did earlier, but it didn't fire the trade. How do we turn that off to test this theory?

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Okay, you're right. But no, I don't know why it's not working? Although I noticed when I change time frames on the charts (typically I have it set at 15M) this will affect the signal. So, maybe this has something to do with that? I didn't think it was supposed to do that with this particular indicator but, apparently it does.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Other EA's I have seen have a "timeframe=0" setting, where 0 means it just changes to whatever chart you have it on. So, when you change timeframes, it generates a new set of signals. Then if you want to lock it in, you change it to 5, 15, 30 etc....then it doesn't matter if you change the chart. It will still fire off the locked settings regardless of what chart it is on. (I know that doesn't help you) But, the multiple does have it's advantages. There have been plenty of time where I used the signals from the 15M for entry and the 5M for exit. So, it's nice to have that option.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
It looks like we may have to go with another indicator here. Either that or adjust accordingly. By the way, what indicator is this that displays the crossover points in red numbers here? It looks like it would be pretty handy to have. Can you post a copy? Thanks! http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...OR-NOCLOSE.jpg

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Okay, it looks like I have something workable now. I think I was trying to do too much at once and basically made matters worse when trying to fix the bug(s) I mentioned earlier. So I scrapped the multiple time frame options for now. Also, for whatever reason, I can't get the RSI TP exit to work or, for that matter, the regular TP. This will be the next thing on the list to fix. I re-uploaded the EA's to this post .

--- 帖子 #562 ---
I have some good news - I will post screen shots in a couple hours. I have it working almost exactly like I intended, making it much simpler. But not using the RSI stuff or the variable TP. Basically, I start the hedge at level 5 and put a TP of 25 on it using a hedge multiplier of 2.5. When it pulls the hedge TP after 25 pips it closes all of the other trades also. (Because the tp_in_money was hit also) The only thing that doesn't seem to work is the internal stop loss of the hedge trade. If it is set to 10, it is not working. (I think it should be 15 - something before the 25 pip level) If the hedge trade is closed before the retrace of the others, then they should close like normal because the hedge trade will be closed already.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
That would be a cool indicator.....if it existed. I added those numbers to make the screen shot more clear. Sorry....

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Hey, sounds good! That's because it's setup to work with the RSI filter. I was just using the -10 points as the RSI cutoff point. So, would it be better to have the option to set it externally? I was just getting ready to do that anyway. It's funny, but I just set it up the way you're talking about, but set to level 3 instead. And, with the external SL set (between 10-15) it keeps taking big chunks of change out of my balance? It shouldn't be doing that?

--- 帖子 #565 ---
I think you are getting all of those losses by using level 3 for the hedge. Since most trades close 1-4, I think hedge on 5 is the best. It seems that once it hits 5, it usually also goes to 6 or higher. Did something change in the RSI in the new version? It doesn't seem to be working the same. Here is a good trade on the older version. http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...with-hedge.jpg Another good trade on the older version. http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...good-trade.jpg Here is the latest version. http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...exit-hedge.jpg Here are all of my settings, to make sure I have it set correct. http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...-latest-02.jpg

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Is there a reason you are not using the built in RSI, which is the same one the EA is already using? It may work better on the entry and exit than this MTF modified version....

--- 帖子 #567 ---
guys.. a quick question here. Surely better results are assured with a longer time frame?

--- 帖子 #568 ---
It was designed to trade on the 5min EURUSD, and backtests have proven it to work great on the 5M. It gets in and out based on pips, so timeframe doesn't really matter. As for the signals, it is very effective on the 5M because it is a counter trend trader. We are just trying to add an effective hedge trade in as protection, just in case it were to drop more than 250 pips with no retrace. It may only happen once a year, but some protection would be nice.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
The thing is, it's closing out all the trades before the tp_in_money is hit, and I don't think it's supposed to do that? I understand what you're saying, although it shouldn't matter if it wasn't closing out prematurely. Maybe there's something else about the old program I'm unaware of? Or, maybe I just botched up my mod somewhere, I don't know? Of course when you go with a smaller hedge size it seems negligible and you don't notice it. I may just wind up gutting the old code that's supposed to handle this and implement something a little more straight forward. That isn't to say the old code isn't straight forward, just that I don't fully understand what they're trying to do with it and, I have my own ideas. I was dinkering around with the old settings a bit, so that might explain it. You'll have to look at the older version to compare the differences.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
The main idea was to look at the price over two or three time frames in an attempt to smooth out some of the spikes, so the hedge doesn't fire too late -- especially -- and immediately turn around and retrace 100-200 points. Because that really sucks! Of course if we could get it to work, like you're saying, where only one hedge is fired, and everything closes out either way or, a new hedge is fired at the same point (with minimum gap), then none of this secondary hedging is necessary. So, what do you think about the multi-time frame bit? According what you're telling Viv108, it sounds like it may not be necessary? at least for this particular EA.

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Or, maybe what we could do is limit the hedge to one entry point, and set it at say, 150% and, if the price really starts to trend, we try stretching it out as far as we can using RSI settings. And, if it doesn't reach tp_in_money target, it won't have to retrace very far to closeout on the rebound. Or, maybe closeout at break even point? I guess maybe that would depend on the RSI settings. Or, maybe if the initial (hedge) trend is strong enough, let it continue, way beyond the tp_in_money even, and closeout when it looks like it's starting to die. Or, you can even use tp_in_money (once it goes beyond it) as a stoploss.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Okay, I see what the problem is here. I'm just watching the balance go up and down on the backtesting chart when, in fact the original orders are still in tact and it hasn't done a closeall yet. As soon as it does, however, it rectifies itself. So, there is nothing wrong with the code. Although, come to find out, I already implemented my own.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
If I understand the original program correctly, the settings just run off whatever chart you have open. The RSI, Stoch &amp; BB are all off the 5m if you are running the 5M charts. As soon as you change the chart to 15M, all of the indicators adjust to the 15M settings and will start to enter based on that criteria. The MTF just allows you to show a different timeframe that you are currently on. It does not average them all together or anything or give you any insight into anything. Now, if we are running on the H1, but wanted to make sure it was oversold/overbought on the 5M, 15M &amp; 30M before we enter a trade, that would be a reason to use it. Making sure all align before making a trade. However, we don't need that on this one I don't think. I think the standard one will do. Can you put that one in and see if makes a difference? That way we can remove a bunch of options and it might run cleaner. Just make some separate RSI hedge settings exactly the same as the ones that it uses on the other trades. But, I do think we need separate ones for the Entry and Exit.

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Yeah, that's the way I understood it too. Yes, I think this is a good idea and I will go ahead and get started on it. Yes. Are you saying accessing it the same but, determine our own entry and exit points per what you're saying below? Yes.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Yes - Let's try these options so we can try to backtest and optimize. http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...w-settings.jpg I guess make the hedge stop loss (h_sl) work if the RSI Hedge Exit is false. That way we can pick which way we want to exit. Using the RSI, or a designated pip number.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
What if you set the rsi_period to 12 on the MTF indicator? Do you think it would give you a more accurate reading? Not that I'm saying I won't try the standard RSI, it's just that I'm still trying to implement it. If I try implementing it the way it's written in the code, I'm not sure it will work? There's something about "PRICE_CLOSE" which, I don't know anything about?

--- 帖子 #577 ---
I was running it with the period set to 10 instead of the default 20. I don't think changing it to 12 will make it start closing on the exit. About PRICE_CLOSE, I would guess that has to do with at what point do you want the math to calculate. PRICE_CLOSE would be the close of the candle, which is what you want. As you can see here, you can have it calculate off the high of the candle or the open price also. http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...ings-close.jpg I am not a programmer, but that would be my guess.... Usually you have these as options, so 0 would be close, 1 would be open, 2 would be High...etc. The weighted close might be more accurate for what we are doing. That means the closer the candle to the current price, the more weight it carries in the calculation. It's better for catching moves.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Well, I wasn't having much luck trying to access it the way it was written in the code so, I tried it the way I normally do and got it to work on the buy side, but not the sell side. So basically I'm going to start all over again (beginning with version 2) and do it one step at a time.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Come to find out I didn't remove the presets (when testing) and forgot to include the inputs options. It should work more dynamically now. ETA: Changed integers to doubles (with floating point) on indicator signals.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
OK - now the RSI seems to be working the way it is supposed to. SO, I noticed something else in addition to the hedge exit issue. When I have the hedge set to 5, it also stops firing regular levels also. I do like the RSI filter on the hedge but I think the hedge level should only "activate the hedge", but not fire it unless the RSI is hit. Meaning it will continue to add normal levels up to the max. So, the hedge trade would be (in this case) "5 or above", not just stop at 5. In this case 7 levels would have fired, but no hedge because the trend wasn't strong enough. I think this is actually safer because if you backtest with only 5 levels, it is not deep enough and you can be waiting for months for the price to come back. http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...level-stop.jpg

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Can you explain how the RSI-TP works again? I don't understand what they do, so I don't know how to set them. http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...si-tp-exit.jpg

--- 帖子 #582 ---
It's all based on momentum, when accelerating (or decelerating), and will post a higher or lower TP depending on that. It's a little extra insurance, in case it begins to lose momentum, but not enough to trigger RSI exit. So, if it sets a TP within range, that is, if you have it tweaked right, it's better to closeout there, than to have it drop further. Of course there appears to be a bug right now so, I guess it doesn't make much difference. Also, if you don't want to place secondary hedges, you probably don't want to use it.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Except of course for the accuracy part, right? Of course I just now realized I should probably use doubles (with floating point) instead of integers on indicator signals. I just now re-uploaded it so, you might want to check it out.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Yes, I did this on purpose, because you made it sound as if the hedge should be the final say-so before everything closed out. But no, this can be changed. Yeah, sounds like a plan. Several months? No, we don't want any of that! Of course this why I came up with the secondary hedging, because it will always be active ... although unless you really nail the timing, you're pretty much stuck in the same boat.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
ec- I just had an epiphany while driving to work. Grrr... You know how the normal operation works...it is counter trend using bb, stoch, and rsi. On the martingale, all of those signals are thrown out and it is just based on 25 pip levels..... Well...using our RSI signal for the hedge....why don't we just use it to add to the levels. I noticed that when I am looking for a hedge trade outside the 80 RSI, it retraces after that, which will pop us out of the hedge and causes all of the problems. It looks like a 20-30 pip retrace after it hits 80/20 RSI. That may be enough to get us out of all of them. Well - what if we place a compounded trade in the same direction as the others that is based on the RSI. (reverse hedge) This will compound our chances of getting out of the original set with a profit and it gets rid of all of the exit problems with the hedge. It should be easy enough to throw an option on there to reverse the hedge so we can test the theory.....

--- 帖子 #586 ---
I believe I attempted something similar to that here ... albeit without the hedge. And yes, this was one of my epiphany moments too!

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Hey look at this. This was for three months with hedge set a level 2, 125%, 1.0 lot size and $2500 deposit. I made a profit of $1448. Of course I'm thinking I should have tested it at 150%, which I'm doing right now but, I think that probably works better when trading at level three. Also, there are some other mods I've made since the last revision in order to do this. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Okay, here it is at 150% for the same period. I made a profit of $1326, although it had peaked to about $1500 two or three weeks prior to that, when it crapped out. If it wasn't for that, it probably would have been closer to $2000. Oh, I set tp_in_money to $40 in both instances here. I think I'll try it around $10 and see whether it's more responsive or not. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Is this the "hedge reverse" option? If it can make it through Feb, 2010 then it should make it through anything. More specifically Feb 2-3 and Feb 17-18.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Hedge reverse option? No, it's similar to what you're describing here , except I'm using RSI with Entry and Exist. I also have a regular stoploss set to 40 I believe. Also, I'm not sure what you mean by hedge reverse option? I guess I can try extending the test out this far to see what happens?

--- 帖子 #591 ---
The "hedge reverse" option was in my "epiphany" post this morning ( here ) (you said it was similar to your stealth, but not the same) So, which stoploss are you setting? The "h_sl" setting? I can't get that one to work. Or did you get the RSI exit to start working?

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Hey, these results are from ideal, by the way. Sometimes you might miss when you're closing out (or close out more than 3 or 4 times in a row on the wrong side of a hedge) and then you're screwed. So, there's probably times when you have to be prepared to take a substantial loss, in order to get out of it. This is all pretty much preliminary as far as I'm concerned.

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Actually, I kind of had a hard time understanding what you're saying here? Maybe we can discuss it later? My mind can only go in so many directions at once and, right now it's about time I took a break. Here is version 3. Both TP and SL settings are working now. I've also included a hedge offset ( h_offset ) which ties hedge and defines entry range with last trade. And yes, the RSI exit is working too, but not the TP exits ... or, at least I don't think? ETA: Added level_limit mod per Domino's request below ... Added hedge_loss_factor per post #603 ... Forgot to zero out hedge_loss_factor before uploading ...

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Oh, I changed (RSI) sl_threshold so it's activated only after specified number of points below the last order open price. In other words, since it's set to activate at -10, that means hedge should close out somewhere between -10 and -40 points, with standard SL. Oh, the test I was running that was supposed to end in February? It just crashed in October!

--- 帖子 #595 ---
OK - great! I will run some tests and get back to you. Can you post a different version that keeps firing the standard levels and doesn't stop at the hedge level also? I want to see if that makes it worse or better. Thx-

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Hello Master ec Trade... i newbie, now follower your thread... where the last version for Ea SWB? regards

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Hey, BP58, try the post you responded to ... Thanks.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Okay, I re-uploaded it in post above . It also includes level_limit option, which you should leave set to false, if you want it to continue firing standard levels.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Thanks EC- Was it working for you? Maybe I need to double check my settings or something. I have the hedge set to 5 and the levels set to 10. I got confirmation with the RSI after level 5 and it didn't jump in. http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...hedge-fire.jpg You got it to work? (not that I needed it on this trade..... )

--- 帖子 #600 ---
I took this screenshot earlier today while running a backtest on the "original non level" version. Hedge is set to 5 levels deep. I think if we are to ever make this hedge version work we will need to implement a "trade recovery" part of the program after a hedge loss. In this screenshot, the hedge fired right on queue. However, it retraced and took a loss. Right after that 4 of the 5 trades could have closed out with a profit but they didn't because the didn't hit the tp_in_money after the hedge loss. After the second hedge loss, the price shot up way past the original entry but still didn't make enough to cover the hedge loss, so they still didn't close. Is there a way to say....."If last closed hedge trade was &lt; 0, then tp_in_money applies to each trade"? (not as a basket of trades) Not sure if we would want to wait 3 days for the last one to close though. Maybe if there was a "get's within 5 pips, then close it automatically" or something. http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...ual-trades.jpg Granted, I had the hedge trade at 300%, but that was so it would pull a small amount of pips and close all quickly. Clearly backfired in this case! Or I guess, if you don't think this will work, we just have to make sure we (I) use much smaller hedge trade sizes.....

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Yes, I did get the hedge to work on level 5. I also got it to work on successive levels after setting hedge level to 2 or 3. So, maybe it's a problem with the accuracy of the indicator? I did try getting it to work with the standard indicator by the way, with the way it's called out in the original code and, how I normally call it out, through iCustom() but, so far no luck. I guess I can try dinkering around with it some more and see if I can't come up with something?

--- 帖子 #602 ---
I could tell it not to count the hedge profit when it's in the negative, so it closes out where it normally does without hedge. Of course that means taking a loss from the hedge but, maybe this would be the best time to take a loss? I'll see if I can set up something real quick here.

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Okay, I decided to take the trickier route and created a hedge loss factor ( h_Loss_factor ). Basically you set it anywhere between 0 and 1 (in fractions), where 1 is equal to 100% of hedge profit that won't count towards tp_in_money. So, if you set it to 0.25, it's only 25%. Unfortunately I'm having a problem doing the math, and it's either all or nothing. It's either 0% or 100% and I cannot figure it out. You can still use it though, although I think 100% is too high. In which case it's probably better left set at 0 for now. Oh, the 100% may work better at higher hedge levels. Right now I have it set at hedge level 1. You can re-download EA here .

--- 帖子 #604 ---
This actually is the way I originally planned on it working. Meaning, if the hedge didn't work and it popped out on stop loss, then the rest of the trades would "close normally". I am running some tests now, so I will take a look at what you came up with in a bit. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Okay, that's fine I guess. Except I uploaded it and forgot to set h_loss_factor back to 0 so, it's going to work that way whether you like it or not. So you might want to re-download it. Also, I changed something else, figuring it wouldn't affect anything, but then I started getting a bunch of secondary hedges so, I decided to change it back. I hope that fixed it. Here is the link again. I also set h_sl to 25, because RSI exit didn't appear to be working. Will have to look into that later.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Great! I have it set to 1 right now, which I believe means don't count any of the hedge profit, to see how it works. It seems to be working as I intended. Although right now it seems to be a losing idea. As you can see here, I hit my hedge stop loss of 25, but this was after a 40 pip move. Can you get it to move the hedge stop loss (h_sl) to break even or +2 pips to cover the spread after a positive move? (say 15?) http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...break-even.jpg

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Okay, it's done! I haven't had a chance to test it though. Okay, that was just preliminary. I think I have it working properly now. ETA: Break even point wouldn't stay set ... Setup standard RSI to work with h_entry and h_exit ... per post #618 . Added P Target indicator ... per post #621 . Forgot set hedge level default to level 5.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
You are the man! I'll test it. I was looking this one a little closer, and shouldn't it have popped out of the trade using the RSI exit because of the offset at 10? (median 50) Then it would be like double protection. It should close by either, the RSI exit or the SL, whichever ones comes first. http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...edge-close.jpg

--- 帖子 #609 ---
As I said in a couple of posts above, I'm not sure the RSI exit is working now. This is why I set the h_sl to 25 instead of 40. Will need to look at this a little more closely. Also, the hedge break even wasn't working quite right. It wouldn't stay set. It seems to work okay now though.

--- 帖子 #610 ---
ok - I seemed to think you got it working. It must have just been the RSI level entry working on both sides that you fixed. Take a look at this these: This one worked perfect - it locked in the break even and fired again, also breaking even. Then it fired another level and closed out. Nice! http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...ood-trade1.jpg However, this one broke even the first trade, then fired another hedge. This hedge was UP 92 pips and still didn't close out the rest of the trades at a 200% hedge. When it closed out the hedge, then it fired 3 more levels to finally close it out. (limit levels - false) Wouldn't that be enough room to close the rest? What if it continued to fire the levels while the hedge is open, thus lowering the cost basis? Would that help? http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...x/no-close.jpg

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Actually - disregard my last post. I had my hedge TP set at 150 thinking, it would just calculate the tp_in_money before that and close out. Obviously, that is not the case. I set my hedge tp to 40 and it closed out quick, added the other levels, and came out great. I don't think you need to change it because adding more levels while the hedge is open only makes it worse. http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...x/ok-hedge.jpg

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Actually it seems to work well when closing out with h_tp set 40. Because you have just bumped everything up by one level (or more) and, at the same time, if hedge is over 100%, you have just decreased your drawdown. So, if the next level opens when the hedge closes (it should), then it shouldn't have to travel far at all (maybe a few points?) for the required retrace. I don't know? Or, how about a trailing stop that kicks in at 25 points (or, maybe even 15) and starts at +5 points over break even? That might be doable. Oh, okay. I didn't actually read this until after I finished my post. Actually, I think it should have closed out with to tp_in_money. Not unless there is something wrong or, it just didn't travel far enough. I'm not sure? Yeah, now we seem to be on the page, regarding setting hedge TP to 40 anyway.

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Ironic how tax day April 15th, not only kills us (in the U.S.), it killed the hedge also. I actually plan on running it after level 7 anyway and an account protector, that's it. But, on level 5, it won't work. I have run backtests for 2 years on level 7 and had been fine. I just want to stop it after that. http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...il15-death.jpg We can try the trailing stop to see how it works.

Here you can see exactly what this is designed for. I have the hedge at 7 levels. First hedge, broke even. Second hedge, broke even. Third hedge, closed all of them at about 28 pips, which is before the TP of 40. The only thing is...I am not quite sure why the hedges fired in the first place. The RSI is not below 25, like I have in the settings.... Hmmm The RSI wouldn't changed based on a 4 or 5 digit broker would it? http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...ect-almost.jpg

--- 帖子 #616 ---
No, as far as I know, you can't. Although I've heard you might be able to hedge with some of the banks, like CitiBank.

--- 帖子 #617 ---
By the way, are there any offshore brokers that will accept US accounts? I had a GoMarkets account until just recently, when all this new legislation was passed, then they copped out.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Hey, I got standard RSI to work with h_entry and h_exit setups. Hurray! The thing that was causing the problem, I think, was the double versus integer issue I mentioned earlier. I also had to change some of the inputs to get it to work but, I don't think this was the real problem. Anyway, this looks like it might be the way to go. Here is the previous link to download.

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Great - I will take a look! Can you take a look at the tp_in_money for the hedge trade? Here you can see there is no way these BUY trades should have not been tp_in_money. All of these trades should have closed out. http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/.../close-bug.jpg Also, its seems that when the limit_level set to true, it also only fires 1 hedge trade. Shouldn't it continue to fire hedge trades until the tp_in_money is hit?

--- 帖子 #620 ---
EC- Disregard this post - it looks like the new version you uploaded corrected it.

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Oh well, take a look at this mod. I just added P Target (in upper left-hand corner) that should help you determine how far away you are from hitting tp_in_money mark. I probably would have added it anyway at some point. Again, here is the download .

--- 帖子 #622 ---
OK- Now that I think we have the bugs worked out..... I have thought of a way to get out of the trade if the hedge goes immediately against us right after it gets in. You don't want to hit a hedge stop loss because that will wipe out a huge chuck of your balance. We add LEVELS to the HEDGE trade also! I think this can be done and we have enough margin if we use a 1.5 multiplier on the regular levels instead of 2. And the earlier we start this (level 3 or 4), not 8-9 then it shouldn't be bad. Also, if we use a hedge multiplier of 1, so the 1st hedge level is not doubled all of the other lot sizes. So, if the hedge goes negative, it will add 2 or 3 levels to recover and close out all trades. If the hedge goes positive, then it closes out all of the trades when it hits tp_in_money. (meaning the hedge trade has made up the loss of the other trades) http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...dge-levels.jpg What do you think?

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Sweet! The more info on chart the better for me. I also wouldn't mind putting some of the key settings on the chart also. When I running it on multiple charts that have different settings, it makes it much easier to see instead of digging into the settings on each chart. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Another example of why I think the option to use "hedge levels" is the key to making this thing bulletproof. http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...leves-must.jpg

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Yeah, I mentioned something like this earlier, except instead of adding additional levels to the hedge, I suggested balancing both sides out at 100%. So, it can sit there all day for all you care, and you don't have to worry about losing anything, except perhaps the swap. Then it's simply a matter of waiting for a trend to develop and, when it gets strong enough, close out the side it's trending against and let it run, that is, until it begins to lose momentum or starts to reverse, and set the hedge again at 100%. And you keep doing this, on either side, until ultimately it closes "the gap." Also, for that matter, if it's done correctly, you shouldn't even need multiple levels (or a Martingale). In which case guess what? You can increase the lot size by a factor of 10 (at least) and, make 10 times as much money. I'm also beginning to think this is something the Big Boys already know about and, in fact do all the time, which is probably why they made it illegal for all us little folks to hedge in the United States. Well, let's just say I wouldn't be surprised.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
I believe this is EXACTLY why the rule was put in place. The "average Joe's" found a way to actually make money, so they have to take that away from us. Don't get me started on that one, I can rant for days! I also heard they may try to get all leverage dropped to no higher than 50:1.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
I have played with the settings enough to where this current version works great, except for those days I sent screen shots to where the levels would close all and both sides would pull tp_in_money. I like the way it closes pulling less pips on the hedge and I also like the way any small loss is made up in the tp_in_money on the original trades. So I think we can try the hedge levels first, since it will close out the trades pretty quick and you don't need to wait for very long. If this idea turns out to be a bust, then I am all for your idea about just matching it and playing the waiting game.

--- 帖子 #628 ---
EC- I actually got past that day easily by just using 40 pip levels instead of 25. In fact, the hedge wasn't needed in either trade. I will test the rest of the year and let you know how it works. http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...x/hedge-40.jpg

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Not that it is really a problem, I am just wondering why it happened. This BUY trade went down and closed at break even. I don't think should happen based on the current program rules. http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...reak-even2.jpg Any ideas?

--- 帖子 #630 ---
great job on the ea ,i know its using rsi ,bb,stoch to enter 1st trade how about using rsi,bb,stoch to enter 2nd trade in case 1st trade lost.just a newbie question

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Looks like it had something to do with the SELL closing out. Did the Sell close out when it hit the TP? If so, maybe it was that close to hitting tp_in_money mark so, when the Buy opened, it was just enough to edge it over or, maybe it opened at the same time the closeall was initiated but hadn't been implemented yet? I guess so long as it doesn't happen too frequently, it shouldn't pose a problem.

--- 帖子 #632 ---
James- This is a counter trend EA. When a trade doesn't hit the TP, the price is now starting to trend. It then starts a series of levels to recover itself using a martingale technique. The reason why it does not use the same signals and uses levels is because your account would hit zero probably on the first trade that started to trend. There would be too many levels compounding too fast. As you can see here, if the EA fired as you said there would be 7 trades instead of 3. http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...indicators.jpg Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Yes - the SELL trade hit its TP. Hmm - very strange. I don't see it happening that often. Maybe it's just a fluke.

--- 帖子 #634 ---
It seems like I've noticed this happening too, at least when the hedge hits the TP, and it does a closesall almost immediately (at least on the backtest). Plus, since the standard level trade is set to open anytime after the price goes past the range (so long as there is no hedge), it only stands to reason that it would open immediately after the hedge closes out.

--- 帖子 #635 ---
thanks domino is there manual for for these setting .ex h_factor or h_loss factor .do u have set file thanks again

--- 帖子 #636 ---
I see that too. Did you see this? I believe this is what you are talking about. It's a rapid succession of trades of after the close and then it opens again after that. We need some kind of "reset to normal" after the hedge close all? http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...2-4x/rapid.jpg

--- 帖子 #637 ---
No - we are still testing it.

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Yeah, I've seen that too, but I'm not sure this is what I'm talking about ... or, maybe it is? And, as annoying as it is (really!), I noticed it didn't effect the balance. This is the main reason why I haven't said anything about it. Plus, I really haven't noticed it since changing indicators, and thought maybe that had something to do with it? But, apparently not, because I'm looking at your screenshot and can see the last indicator (P Target) up at the top. And no, I don't understand exactly what's happening so, I don't know what to do about it? And yeah, a "reset to normal" sounds like it might work, except I don't know what I'm setting it to ... or, from?

--- 帖子 #639 ---
I have tested it on 2 different brokers, one with commissions and one without. These rapid trades are getting out at break even. If you are not being charged commission, then this isn't that big of deal. On the broker that charges commissions, these were a ton of $1.00 losses, which could get rather annoying. If you can't find it, I sure as heck can't find how to fix it. How does the normal one reset after it closes?

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Hey, I just noticed the same thing happening on another test on an older version (with old indicator) but, without the hedge. Hmm ... It appears to be some sort of closeout issue though. Also, it appears to be happening when it switches over from a BUY to a SELL, and vice versa. Or, maybe the price is just ranging at that point? ... but, then again, I'm not using the indicator?

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Yeah, this is what it looks like on the graph ... i.e., the three flat areas. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Actually, since it occurs on the primary trade, I think know where to look. Will let you know ...

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Nope. It still does it. It's just as well, because I didn't want to have to remove the feature I added. It was inhibiting access to the first trade indicator(s), so it only accessed it when trade count was set to zero. I figured that would help reduce the bandwidth, especially when running multiple charts. Oh well, at least I have something to think about anyway.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
While you are still thinking about the other "issue"..... I thought of some more info that would be beneficial to be on the top left of the chart. While running a live demo on multiple charts, I noticed that one of my charts only had 2 levels fired, but it was way down. So much that there should have been 2 more levels fired but it didn't. I can only think that maybe I didn't have enough margin at the time. Now I have been babysitting the trade manually trying to get it back in the money. Is there way that you can put the size of the next trade going to fire and if there is enough margin to handle it? Maybe something like: Amt of next trade: .16 || Able to trade: YES || Amt of margin left: $xxxxx I know different brokers allow different amounts, so I don't know if there is a command to pull that info from the broker or not. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #644 ---
ecTrade I have swb v04 running 2 ways - 1 with the hedge on and 1 with it off. I get the same trades on both. Is that the way it should be most or less of the time? Should the RSI tp and RSI sl be on or off using hedge or not? I sure had good results on v02 and v03. Hope 04 is the same. As far as using a US broker in the US, my broker is checking into it as I told him the EA with the hedge works fine on a demo account and he says it should work live also but is checking into as why it works to see if its ok. I'l post the results when I get them from him. Thanks gene

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Yeah, there are two or three command prompts regarding account margin and free margin? And no, I don't think it matters which broker you use. Am not sure what calculation you would use to determine if you have enough margin for the next trade though?

--- 帖子 #646 ---
This is my Brokers response to question about hedge trading SWB. As far as I can tell you are not hedging in that account so you should be fine. gene

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Really? Which broker is this?

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Hey, take a look at this! Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) This is what happened when I backtested the latest version. Am not sure if it does this on earlier versions or not? I tried it on version 4, and it didn't seem to do quite bad, but I'm not sure I had it on the same settings? The two main settings are: h_level=2 and h_rsi_entry=false . I think level_limit was also set to true ... except I just tried it and it does it whether it's set to true or not. Okay, basically it does the same thing with version 4.

--- 帖子 #649 ---
ecTrader Here was his 1st email. Hi Eugene, The demo and live environment share the same rules for executing trades. If it works in demo it will work in live, but you state that it hedges, and our demo environment should not allow hedging. Can you give me your account number so I can check why it is hedging? So I sent him a copy of the EA and he then sent this hours later so he must have checked it out?Also gave my acct. number. His reply: As far as I can tell you are not hedging in that account so you should be fine The Broker is: Ramon H. Valenzuela | Branch Supervisor | MB Trading 1926 E.

--- 帖子 #650 ---
My experience has been that you want to use the regular program as much as possible. Meaning if most trades close between 1-4, start hedging after that. (sometimes 6-7) I think you only want to hedge when a huge trend is going on. Otherwise, the RSI exit on the hedge will eat away your balance because it will constantly keep trying to correct after it gets in. I think you could hedge earlier if we actually did put in the hedge level option.

--- 帖子 #651 ---
Hey, you know what? My broker is IBFX and I have no problem at all hedging while backtesting but, as soon as I try forward testing it, it basically tells me I can't do it, I think? It's been quite awhile since I've tried it. So, were you forward testing or backtesting on the demo?

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Actually I ran a test just yesterday I believe? with hedge set at 1, but also using RSI entry, and it ran all the way out to May, 2010 (it started in June, 2009), before it finally crashed.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
I was forward testing. Ya know ecTrader - I was getting great results on either v02 or v03 using the hedge. I was checking both. But quit when I thought I couldn't use the hedge. Just thought I would let you know that and maybe I will test them again? It was about 79% wins on 12 pairs. The Swb Grid 4.1 did 52% at the same time. I have a spread sheet but it doesn't say what version it was. I can email it if you want it? All I put for its title was: Swb Revised, no version. (not smart) I willl send to you both if you want it. Can't see much good tho? ern@ameritech.net gene

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Okay, here are all the versions I've created so far (except for MTF indicator). I went ahead and modified them so they all include the version in the title block. There were also two version 2's. The first one, version 2-A, didn't have the version in the title block, but the second one did, as did versions 3 and 4. So we are talking about version 2-A or earlier. The other three would have shown up in your test results. Anyway, you might want to consider retesting?

--- 帖子 #655 ---
EC- OK - I think you talked me into it! These kinds of trades have to stop. Trying to fire 5 hedge trades that do nothing except lose is not going to work. Not to mention waiting 5 days for it to close. (These are RSI exits) I am on board with your hedge "1:1" idea! What were you thinking? After the first level, it fires a double lot buy and sell at the same time? The hedge trade at total lots (combining level 1 with level 2) and the level 2 at regular martingale. So in this below example, the hedge BUY trade would ride up and take profit at 25pips. The both opposite trades fire again at level 3, with the TP hitting again on the hedge trade. Both trades fire again at level 4, but this time the price retreats and closes all. The last buy trade closes with a small loss, but after the other 2 banked 50 pips, it still hits tp_in_money?....Maybe? We hope? Actually, I don't think that will work because the last win will never close because of the open last hedge trade. (maybe we alternate levels on the hedge or something) If the price goes against the hedge, does it start hedging the other way? Then it starts to sound like my "hedge levels" idea....... Speaking of.....at least on this trade, the "hedge levels" idea would have worked closing all trades around 9:30 on the 2nd. (3 days earlier than it did) It would place a second buy on the level 3 sell trade, so when it went back up it would hit tp_in_money, closing all trades. http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...4x/5-hedge.jpg

--- 帖子 #656 ---
hi ectrade can you show me how to modify ea to enter trade using signal on every trade ex 1st trade 2nd trade and so on

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Hey, I figured it would be just as easy to do it myself, which I did, than try to explain it to you. Unfortunately I can't get it to work? It's a good idea, but I need to think about it some more.

--- 帖子 #658 ---
This may work if you use a low multiplier. As shown in my previous post, http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=632 , if you are doubling each trade it can get real deep fast. Of course if you are not doubling, then it will take more pips to hit the tp_in_money and exit. Should be interesting to test..... I think you will need some other kind of filter/pause in there to prevent this from happening on a big run. I think this is why it uses levels. http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...12-candles.jpg

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Hey, nice picture! Oh, sorry if I haven't been too responsive over the last day or two. I've been getting tired and having a hard time concentrating. I'm having a hard time implementing any of my own ideas, let alone anyone else's. I guess I'm saying I need a break ... unless of course someone has something "simpler" in mind? Oh, I've been working on a single level hedge, where you open the first order with RSI towards tp_in_money mark ... which, if it doesn't reach, after the price starts to reverse, it opens 100% hedge in opposite direction. So, you wait until a trend starts to develop and you say, Okay, fine, I'm going to setup a flag, noting this has happened, and wait for the trend to peak and, as soon as it begins to reverse (and establishes a pivot point?), and builds up enough momentum in the opposite direction, closeout the trade at the top and ride the profits all the way down. Well, it sounds great in theory anyway. I have the basic hedge working right now, but am far from figuring out the rest of it.

--- 帖子 #660 ---
Ummm - HUH? I will wait to watch it backtest to see what you mean. You deserve a break, I know you have been working very hard on these. You need to focus on one thing at a time and when that idea is done and if it doesn't work, then move to the next. I still think the hedge levels will work, but I can wait until you are done with this idea if you want. Thanks again for all of your hard work!

--- 帖子 #662 ---
EC - I have a "cleanup" suggestion whenever you get a chance..... Can you add close arrows to the chart to show where the trades close? It does it in backtesting but it doesn't do it live because MT4 is closing the trade via take profit and stop loss lines, not the EA. (I believe) Attached is a script that I have to drop on each chart to see where the trades close. But, I am constantly doing it on all charts so it gets a little annoying. If you can look at it and figure out how to incorporate it into the EA, it would be fantastic! Like I said, very low priority. Thanks a ton!

--- 帖子 #663 ---
i think having time filter and dayofweek can eliminate a lot of bad trades

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Can anyone tell me what is the best version till now ? Want to test on a mini 1:400 Thanks !!

--- 帖子 #665 ---
I personally think version 4 is the best, since it is the most advanced. As for which one performs the best, it's kind of hard to say? Oh, for anyone who downloaded the most recent copy of version 4, you might want to re-download it. I forgot to reset defaults after I tested it. If you try setting it up with the current defaults, you will get this . ETA: Added end_cycle mod to address issue in post #667 below.

--- 帖子 #666 ---
You might like to try this (version 04_A). I haven't had a chance to test it though, although it worked on the EA I borrowed it from. You have to save the two include files (day_time_header.mqh and day_time_function.mqh) in your include folder. ETA: Modified so it doesn't call up day_time_function include unless use_trading_sessions is specified. Added end_cycle mod to address issue below.

--- 帖子 #667 ---
Also, the issue where it opens several successive orders after closeout on page 43 (posts #631-642) really needs to be addressed. As I already said, it does this whether the hedge is set or not. In fact, I have a similar version running right now, where I cut out the hedge function entirely, and it still does it. While it seems to occur between the transition between Buy and Sell cycles, that is, as soon as a Buy cycle closes out and a Sell cycle opens immediately afterwards, etc. Anyway, if anyone is considering going live with this, I would at least wait until this is fixed before you do.

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Okay, I think I fixed it or, at least it appears to work in the version where I removed the hedge function. What I did was add a 2 tick delay at the end of each closeout to give whatever it is that needs to be reset a chance to reset. If I only go with 1 tick, however, it won't work. So, hopefully two ticks should cover it. Of course this is more of a quick fix, because I still don't know exactly what's not being reset. This should suffice for now though. I've incorporated mod in the last two uploads (posts #665-666) and, if anyone still notices it happening, please let me know. Okay? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #669 ---
If I can set it up as an include file, I might be able to get it to work.

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Okay, I added the TradePlot includes and it appears to be doing something on the backtest (mostly flashing lights) but, maybe it works better when forward testing? In order to use, open properties box and under Additional, set use_TradePlot to true. And let me know how it works. I added includes and incorporated into version 04_A in post above .

--- 帖子 #671 ---
Isn't the version 04_A the version where you changed the martingale to use the signals instead of levels, with the added time filter and trade plot function? If so, can you add it to the original "martingale level" version?

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Okay, I didn't like that. I created a separate version, 04_B. It sill includes 04_A mods though, which will work so long as you download both includes (and save to include folder). ETA: Please go to this post for most current versions of EA's and includes. I uploaded wrong versions of includes and neither 04_A nor 04_B were working.

Hello EcTrade What is the point of the Increament setting? Is there a pdf or something that explains settings? Thanks Rich

--- 帖子 #674 ---
Is there a way to automatically increase lots size as the account grows, eg 0.01 lots every $100 increase in capital?

--- 帖子 #675 ---
What's that, RSI Stealth? No, it's not. Which is the "original?" Oh, and did you get a chance to see of the TradePlot works?

--- 帖子 #676 ---
When lotmultiplier is set to false, it defaults to your increment setting which, by default is 0.1. So, on each successive level it adds 0.1 to lot size. So, first trade is 0.1, second trade is 0.2, third trade is 0.3, etc. And no, there is no pdf manual I'm aware of?

--- 帖子 #677 ---
No - I haven't looked at it yet. I just thought the version 04_A was a response to James, which he was requesting that the program be changed to using RSI, BB &amp; stoch instead of using 25 pip levels. I thought that is why he wanted the time filter to get his version to work - to avoid big runs to where his version would enter on every candle for 12 straight candles. That is what I meant. The "original version" I was talking about would be the hedge version we have been working on for the past couple weeks, not the "new version" I thought you made James. Sorry for the confusion.

--- 帖子 #678 ---
Hi I have converted TradePlot script into an indicator if you want: save it in experts/indicators rather than experts/scripts, load the indicator on your charts just once, and it will automatically track any new trades/closure. (and it will remove all displayed trades when you remove it from the chart, which is not the case for the script). I had coded long ago a similar indicator, i have attached it here also (SQ_showTrades.mq4). This one will also show global trades stats as well as individual trade outcome in pips. Sq

--- 帖子 #679 ---
No, not at this time, but I suppose I can always add it later?

--- 帖子 #680 ---
No, it was in response to this post ...

--- 帖子 #681 ---
I agree - this would be a good addition. Something like: for every 10% account increase, increase start lot .01 or something like that. (obviously making the two numbers options)

Okay, as near as I can tell it looks like it's working. I'm seeing the same indicator arrows I see when using squalou's indicator. In case anyone missed it, here is the download .

--- 帖子 #685 ---
In case people were wondering about what the colors mean while using the tradeplot script; if the trades takes a loss, it has white line connecting the arrows. If it takes a profit, then the line connecting the arrows is the same color as the trade arrows. When going back and looking at trades, it's pretty nice.

Okay, it's been brought to my attention that the includes aren't installing properly. And sure enough, after I checked, I had the wrong versions uploaded. When I first uploaded version 04_A and the two includes it was correct. But then I modified both and apparently didn't upload the most recent versions of the includes. The same thing happened to version 04_B too I think, because it's not installing the includes either. Anyone willing to try again? Oh, when you save the includes, save them in the include folder, but don't compile them. Do a "Save As." Also, go back and check to see if they have the .mqh extension (not .mq4), otherwise they won't work that way either.

What's that, signal only on all levels? Like I said before, I couldn't get that to work. So, neither of these versions contain that. At the same time, I don't see why it shouldn't work, it just doesn't like the way I laid out the code. I may look into it later. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #697 ---
Okay, here is version 05. Basically I added power lots feature, that scales up lot size as account equity increases. Just set power_lots to true. It's all automatic after that. I also removed RSI TP Exit feature and substituted it with RSI TP Override. And here, when specified RSI values are reached, meaning the trend is strong enough, it will override hedge TP, in the event that it will closeout at a higher price ... so long as h_rsi_exit is set accordingly. And, although TP Override appears to work, I find I get better results just by setting h_tp to 0 ... or, maybe 80? Of course it all may vary depending on how everything else is configured. I also set it up so h_rsi_exit works when hedge is making a profit, which it wasn't doing. Before it was set to work below the order open price, to help minimize hedge losses. Instead, I set h_sl to 25 ... or, it was already set there? It may still be necessary to have an RSI exit below the order open price, depending on the size of hedge you are using. Currently I have it set at 110%, and with h_sl st to 25, it doesn't seem to adversely affect it. So, that's about it, I guess. You will still need to download the four include files (.mqh) from post #694 above. Also, current settings seem to work best (at least for me) with 5M time frame. ETA: Forgot to include code for includes. Sorry! Also set h_level default to level 3.

--- 帖子 #698 ---
ectrade thanks for the new version ! Is there any version with a time set ?

--- 帖子 #699 ---
EC- This thing rocks! The rsi exit with profit is the way to go! I have thrown every bad day at it hedging at level 3 and it seems to be solid so far!

--- 帖子 #700 ---
Could you post your BT?

--- 帖子 #701 ---
Oh, I guess I forgot to set the hedge back to level 5. I meant to, but I was too busy running a test and forgot. So, what do you think would be a good default setting? Or, should I just leave it set at level 1? I also meant to say if you start hedging at a lower level, even level 1, you are less likely to crash and can start with a smaller deposit. Plus, since the hedge doesn't fire each time anyway, only when there appears to be enough momentum to get past the break even point, then maybe it's not that big of an issue?

--- 帖子 #702 ---
giving it a go. will update. backtest on GU and EU look superb tho. trying on live acc on small lots for the whole week next week. if this work.. imma buy everyone champagne.

--- 帖子 #703 ---
I think level 1 is too early. I think level 3 should be a good safe level, without going overboard.

--- 帖子 #704 ---
Are you talking about trading sessions, like Asian, European and New York? If so, then yes. The last three versions, 04_A, 04_B and 05, contain this as part of the includes. Oops! It looks like I forgot the code for the includes in version 05. Actually I did once, but messed the code up somewhere, so I had to revert to an earlier version and start over again. Hopefully I didn't miss anything else! You'll have to re-download if you want to include the trading sessions and TradePlot script ... although it's only necessary to download the EA, not the includes if you already have. Sorry!

--- 帖子 #705 ---
EC- It looks like the program is running exactly as it should. However, there are times when it could get into trouble. This is an example of why we need to keep the hedge multiplier close to 1. Here you can see I have it at 1.25 (125%). When the second hedge is triggered, it is the lot size equivalent of a 10 level trade ! Even though I am hedging after level 4, you can see it added 4 more levels and we could get into trouble real quick. I am wondering if it would work if the second hedge was the same lot size as the first hedge? Obviously, it would not match the lot sizes of all of the other trades, but would it work and be safer? Maybe it would just help the other trades hit the tp_in_money faster when it retraces, and not made to close it out if there are more levels added. http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...evel-hedge.jpg Thoughts?

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Actually, so long as your broker allows you to hedge, it shouldn't make any difference. Everything is balanced out so that it is "even," in fact, the margin will even reflects this or, whatever the current balance is with no trades showing ... I believe?

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Well - I need to figure out what is happening then. There should be no way that a 12k account can be wiped out using .02 lots, hedging on level 4. http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...ktest-fail.jpg The original can make it through using .05 lots with 10k. The hedge version is supposed to be safer, not riskier.

--- 帖子 #708 ---
hi ectrade on version .05 i cant open it plus it still doesn't have asian,ny ,euro time setting option thanks

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Except of course if you double the lot size at each level, the standard lot total (without hedge) at 8 levels (per your first post) would be 5.1. I don't know about a 12k account, but for anything less than that it might be enough to wipe it out. Now if you placed a 125% hedge, that's 6.375 - 5.1 or 1.275 lots total, which seems negligible ... that is, until you drop the hedge and the price swings the other way, then you might have a problem. But, it's not the hedge causing the problem, it's the lack of a hedge. In other words the maximum trade level is set too high. Or, are you saying the hedge is still open and that when the price swings against it, this could pose a problem? I suppose I can add a maximum lot limit for the hedge. That would be easy enough.

--- 帖子 #710 ---
That's probably because I forgot to add the code for the includes. In which case you'll have to re-download it. You also have to make sure you have the correct includes, because I got that mixed up too. These are on post #694 .

--- 帖子 #711 ---
Yeah, I noticed it doesn't help me out much either when set to anything greater than level 3. This is why I think it's better employed the earlier the better. Of course I'm also testing it with a US broker with 50:1 margin, and it won't go nearly as far without a margin call, although when they occur now, they are not nearly as devastating (ususally). I figure if I can get past the majority of the margin calls that didn't use to occur, then I've accomplished something. But, then again, maybe we are just wasting our time? Although I suspect it would perform a lot better on an "unregulated" account.

--- 帖子 #712 ---
I am testing it on a 500:1 account with hedging. I was thinking the same thing, however so far, level 3 &amp; 4 have zeroed out the account during a 2 year backtest. This is mainly due to a 400 pip run on 3/19/09. With the 3 and 4 level hedge, it is not firing the regular levels. So when the hedge closes out with a decrease in RSI, it's too far behind and can't recover. The hedge trade wasn't enough to close out the trades due to the low hedge multiplier. When 2 more levels are fired it keeps going up and doesn't retrace, the acct is done. Level 5 is looking good so far. It's gets past that day ok.

Make sure you are using the include files from http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...26#post4444926 . Overwrite your other ones. (and of course make sure they are in the "include" folder under the experts folder.)

--- 帖子 #715 ---
hi. I hve just done that... I have saved those files in the include folder - they are all .mqh - and I even downloaded the revised_05 EA again... still same message!!! I wonder what could be the reason... ignore me... it is working! THANK YOU!

my broker does not allow hedging. Is there hope for me with this EA? All back tests for the past few years have crashed.

--- 帖子 #717 ---
You can use the original version of this on page 1 of this thread if you have enough money. You need at least 2k on .01 microlots and it should be fine. It does not hedge.

Okay James, this one's for you. There are no includes to download, just the EA itself.

--- 帖子 #721 ---
thank you ectrade for your time this version work great

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Just thought I would try this. Basically it's the same as version 05_A, except I added forward_trend option using RSI filter, just to see difference in overall success rate. So far it looks pretty good. You folks are free to test and compare results if you like. I also added a forward trend TP ( fwd_tp ) on first trade which, if you don't want to use, set it to 0. Also, I'm considering adding an SMA filter but am not sure what settings to use. Any ideas? ... Domino? Thanks. ETA: Changed b_even_level to 10 ... per post #741 . Normalized hedge lots ... per post #745 .

--- 帖子 #723 ---
This is an RMI indicator and maybe its better than RSI. Inside the mq4 file is a description how it works.

--- 帖子 #724 ---
this set file for usdcad 5m starting balance 3000

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Very interesting! So, if I am seeing this right.....instead of automatically jumping in with a counter trend trade, it will check the RSI first. If the RSI is downward favorable, then instead of firing a normal BUY it will fire a SELL instead with a tp of 20. That could be a great way to get some extra pips instead of firing levels. I will have to check it long term. I did notice that it is not firing the hedge when this "forward trend" is turned on. I also noticed that it is stopping at 6 levels deep, even though I have 10 set. Are these done intentional? As for the SMA, it depends on how you want to use it. I found a real nice indicator years ago that I use instead of SMA. It was designed with the algorithm taken from the book "Cybernetics analysis for stock and futures" by John Ehlers called two pole super smoother filter. It is MUCH more accurate ("tight") to the price action than SMAs. You could put 2 of these on with different time frames and use the cross as the signal. I just don't quite know how you plan to use it yet, but for starters you can try a 5 and a 20 cross as a filter. Heck, maybe if you are in a couple sell trades and you get a two pole cross, and RSI (or RMI) 50 cross, then it fires the hedge then? And not have it dependent on levels? Take a look to see if you like it. You don't have to use it. The RMI that E2u suggested does appear to be much smoother than the RSI. It may filter out bad signals. OR - maybe with this filter idea, we bail on the hedge idea all together? Based on my backtests it actually seems that the hedge is not as safe as the original. With this new way of entering, we don't get caught in big runs the wrong way and we don't need to hedge......?

--- 帖子 #726 ---
No, it is set up to operate on RSI only. Am using it on 5M time frame. Actually, it's not working too great on short term, although I set forward TP to 40 instead of 20, and at least it's not crapping out right away. The problem is it does great so long as it's trending, but it doesn't know when to pull out when it loses momentum and begins to reverse? Maybe if I put an RSI exit filter on it like the hedge? Plus setting a break even level? Try upper 72 and lower 28 on RSI exit ... or lower. Not enough money perhaps? Mine cuts out at level 5, with $2,500 balance. Will take a look when I get time. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #727 ---
nice system...i modified scalping + martiangle but allways daytrade.... this is sample my trading : http://compactfx.mt4stats.com/

--- 帖子 #728 ---
If you are using the RSI only, then isn't this basically just "reverse trading" the original? I mean, the original will SELL when the RSI gets above 70, this fires a BUY....and if it is not right, then it starts using the levels? Is this just so you are not caught the wrong way when it starts to trend? I do think what make this such a good EA and take as many wins as it does is because it IS counter trend, but I will test them both to see. Apparently, the forex only trends 30% of the time last I read. My earlier post didn't make sense, I now realize. You couldn't confirm with the RSI as a filter because the RSI was part of the signal that fired. I have done a month so far, and it is still looking good. I bet if you have enough money, it could be fine.

--- 帖子 #729 ---
This would be an interesting experiment..... What if...instead of TP of 20, you added anti-martingale levels in the positive direction, then used the an RSI exit filter like the hedge, plus a break even level. That way, if is down, it martingales to make up, if it is trending up, it anti-martingales adding to the position, maybe always locking in the first level, when you fire the second level? Hmmmm

Sorry English is not perfect, use google translator !! 1 ° to ensure that the take profit remains constant, ie: if you set it to 20 pips, 20 pips from stays at each position, hours and shifts by setting the take of all open positions at 20 pips from 'Last open. 2 ° with reverse buy sell and vice versa, so that the opposite works (in trend and not controtrend) and opportunity 'to make it work on constant currency on a different graph, changing the magic number. thanks Kand

--- 帖子 #731 ---
Thanks for all members in this thread, its really vary good EA, whats mean 'power_lots' ? If anyone can provide this thread with documentation Special thanks to ecTrade

--- 帖子 #732 ---
Forget this idea - I'm an idiot! With only a 25 pip retrace you will loose all of the gains.

--- 帖子 #733 ---
i got that end drop as well. is that supposed to be smthing to worried?

--- 帖子 #734 ---
Power lots increases your start lot size as your account increases. I don't know the exact %, but I believe every 5% growth it adds a .01 on to your start lot size. It keeps your same pips you were taking before so it also adjusts your tp_in_money accordingly. very effective and highly recommended. We will post all of the settings when we get it complete.

--- 帖子 #735 ---
So far, my 2 year backtest have failed with the hedge version on level 3, 4 &amp; 5. I haven't tried the others. We are still trying to modify it to where it has less draw down and safer than the original. However, if you are not greedy &amp; use micro lots the original way seems to be the safest for now. Actually, using the latest rev 05 with the hedge turned off and using power lots is the best way. But, we are trying to improve it so you don't have to set your start lot size so low allowing room for a 10 level trade an any moment.

--- 帖子 #736 ---
thanks. will cont to try the best setting.

--- 帖子 #737 ---
I too am trying to figure out the power lots. I've been starting all my tests with a £1000 balance, £5 TP and a starting lot .1. It seems to be adding .01 every £100 increase. The test Im currently on is up to £2832 which opened with .28 lots and will be looking for a TP around £14.30. I believe the current risk is still equal to the starting risk back at £1000, £5tp and .1 lots. Which would be 10%

--- 帖子 #738 ---
Got it now. I would appear power lots are based on two percentages set on your initial inputs. Hence in my previous post the relationship between the starting balance 1000 and lot size .1 remain the same, so its true that 2800 balance would equal .28 lots and second the relationship between balance and start lot will remain constant. So percentage of risk is not hard set, its what ever you want it to be based on your initial inputs.

--- 帖子 #739 ---
can anyone explain what the hedge setting are? what it does like h_factor thanks

--- 帖子 #740 ---
Yeah, it's all based upon the ratio between initial lot size and initial equity, which is maintained throughout by multiplying it by current equity ... i.e., (lots/initial equity) x current equity. This is how I came up with the original calculation anyway. If you look at the code on the EA, it's not quite the same, but it effectively does the same thing.

--- 帖子 #741 ---
I just noticed I had the break even level ( b_even_set ) set at 15. You might want to try setting it to 10. You will probably get better results.

--- 帖子 #742 ---
hedge factor is a multiplier of the hedge trade. So, a hedge factor of 1 means it will fire a hedge trade 100% of the current lots in the opposite direction. That means if the hedge is after level 4 on .01 lots, you will have a .01, .02, .04 &amp; .08 open. The hedge trade will be .15. If you set it to 1.25 then it will be 125% of the total current lots.

--- 帖子 #743 ---
EC- are you sure the hedging is working on this 05 version? (this is the reg 05, not A or B version) Here you can see it was supposed to fire a hedge after level 3 and didn't. http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...x/no-hdege.jpg Here are my settings - it was below the 25. http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...e-settings.jpg I am trying this on a different broker, since my other one is busy. However, this one also allows hedging, so I wouldn't think that would be the issue. (unless....maybe the 1.1 hedge is putting on a lot size that the broker can't handle. The min on this broker is .1, so the hedge trade might be getting rejected from the broker if the lot size isn't rounding to the nearest .1) Will it do that?

--- 帖子 #744 ---
It was working when I backtested it, although I didn't actually check when the hedges fired. Was it in range? that is, within 20 points specified by h_offset? I'm not sure I even said anything about this before, but it's there. I put it there to allow some flexibility on the hedge, but still keep it tied to the last trade.

--- 帖子 #745 ---
That could be. This was something I hadn't considered before. Although if this was 1.1 times the combined total of all the other trades, I don't see how that could pose a problem. One thing I could do is try normalizing it, which rounds it off to the nearest decimal point specified. In fact it already has something like this setup for the standard orders, and I guess that's why it's there.

--- 帖子 #746 ---
Does the hedge offset mean that it the hedge needs to be within 20 pips of the level it is activated on, or after 20 pips after the level?

--- 帖子 #747 ---
I have multiple EAs that automatically detect what lot sizes the broker allows and adjusts accordingly. If you don't know how to do that it could just be a option added. (hedge_multiplier_roundto = .1) This HAS to be it because a .1 + .2 + .4 = .7*1.1 = .77 lot , which would get rejected. It would need to be either .8 or .7.

--- 帖子 #748 ---
Okay, I just to set it up to normalize hedge lots on version 05_B . Supposedly it sets it up automatically (per original code) based on the account type, so long as it's specified. It's worth a try anyway.

--- 帖子 #749 ---
hi ectrade why hedge trade only fire about 3 times and after it close ,it won't hedge anymore and let the open trade run till account blown . how do i set the option to make ea opening more hedging trade.thanks

--- 帖子 #750 ---
That worked! Thanks....

--- 帖子 #751 ---
20 pips after the level it's activated on. So, if you open a standard Sell at 1.4625, and the RSI criteria is met, it will open a Buy hedge anywhere between 1.4625 and 1.4645.

--- 帖子 #752 ---
That's because these last versions of the hedge are set to open using RSI settings. They won't always open unless it detects a strong enough trend. What time frame are you using? Or, try changing h_rsi_entry settings, i.e., lower_2 and upper_2 , to 30 and 70 and see if that works.

--- 帖子 #753 ---
James- lower your entry criteria on the hedge. It is set to only enter if the RSI is below 25 or above 75. If you want more change it to 40/60. However, it may fire when you don't really want it to with it set that low. As long as the RSI criteria is met, it should continue to fire the hedge trades.

--- 帖子 #754 ---
Great! ...

--- 帖子 #755 ---
anyone tested the original version with other pairs ?

--- 帖子 #756 ---
I see the best version at now swb grid 4.1_revised_04_A ,with Headging false any one can edit this version to close all opened positions on Specified Level, i think this is vary good idea I hope any one can do it Really i am vary glad to see all members cooperate to produce a successful system

--- 帖子 #757 ---
ok, im gettin confused. i did not donload the included file. is the chart supposed to look like this or no?

--- 帖子 #758 ---
For the most part....yes. If you get the include files you will have close arrows on the trades that have closed. I also changed my RSI on the hedge to 12 instead of the default 14, so it matches the rest of the program. Why are you confused?

--- 帖子 #759 ---
Why would you want to do this? You would be taking huge losses. The program closes all the trades when it hits your profit target. (tp_in_money)

--- 帖子 #760 ---
Because in backtest 80% of trades success from 1st level, then we close all opened positions when arrive to leve 3 or 4 and we can test on other range

--- 帖子 #761 ---
ec- I thought of a way to ensure protection on really big moves. It's another indicator that you may like to use as another filter, or instead of the RSI. It is a velocity indicator. I was thinking....people could use 2 ways. 1) Use the hedge on huge moves only, like a multiple hundred pips fast move. You could use this as filter to say "fire the hedge when velocity is greater than 13." (speed up the period in indicator to be 10 instead of 14). That way the hedge could be based on velocity, not on levels. or 2) Maybe we would want to increase the hedge_factor when the velocity is larger than 13. That way the hedge trade can overcome the other losses faster on a fast run. This would allow us to NOT have to go 10 levels deep to catch up on a fast move. OR...maybe you have a better idea? http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...ity-filter.jpg Play around with the idea and let me know what you think?

--- 帖子 #762 ---
Velocity? Yeah, that might better, except that's kind of what I thought the RSI was supposed to do. Maybe not?

--- 帖子 #763 ---
No - not really. RSI is really just used to determine overbought and oversold conditions.

--- 帖子 #764 ---
Overbought and oversold? I have heard this before, but no, I'm not sure what it means?

--- 帖子 #765 ---
Okay, I've added a range multiplier, similar to the lot multiplier. And here, I set the default to 1.5, and set lot multiplier default to 2.5. I initially tried it in forward_trend mode, and it makes a big difference. So, I figure it would make even more difference in counter trend mode. So far that appears to be the case. I also created the optional tp_by_level , which allows you to set a TP at each level. Tp_1 is for the first trade, and tp_2 is for each level after that. I suppose you could go with a TP multiplier option as well, but you don't want it set too high, otherwise it requires too much for a retrace. Not unless you specify a maximum TP value which, is kind of what tp_2 does anyway. Oh, if you want to use one TP setting but not the other, set the other one to 0. I also bumped up the period on the forward trend to 20, and added a couple of limiters to the upper and lower settings, to try and keep it from placing trades at the end of a spike. If you don't want to use it, set upper_max to 100 and lower_max 0. Currently it's set up to work with forward_trend but, I suggest you try it either way. ETA: Meant to set forward_trend default to true .... Addressed closeall reset issue ... was closing out orders on reboot. Added velocity indicator option ... per post #770 .

--- 帖子 #766 ---
It looks it works better with lot_multiplier set to 2.0, at least for forward_trend. It's probably okay for counter trend mode though. It might also be a good idea to set a maximum range, so you don't wind up in no-man's land without a retrace. Either that or have a cutoff level, similar to the hedge? before it goes into extended range?

--- 帖子 #767 ---
I'll take a look at this when I get time. Right now I have to address this issue you brought up via PM. It sounds like a good idea though.

--- 帖子 #768 ---
i think its best to use signal to enter every level to avoid a lot of bad trade open or try this method you get to choose what you want to input each level .thanks // Secondary Trade extern bool UseTrade2 = true; extern int EnterWhenDown2 = 30; extern double TakeProfit2 = 5; extern double StopLoss2 = 100; extern double LotMult2 = 2.0; // Third Trade extern bool UseTrade3 = true; extern int EnterWhenDown3 = 80; extern double TakeProfit3 = 15; extern double StopLoss3 = 100; extern double LotMult3 = 4.0; // Forth Trade extern bool UseTrade4 = true; extern int EnterWhenDown4 = 120; extern double TakeProfit4 = 15; extern double StopLoss4 = 100; extern double LotMult4 = 8.0;

--- 帖子 #769 ---
never mind i don't think my idea work

--- 帖子 #770 ---
I just added h_velocity indicator option which, if you set to true, overrides h_rsi_entry settings. It's just preliminary, but I thought you might like to see it and try it out. It's incorporated as part of version 05_C download .

--- 帖子 #771 ---
Does it still work on levels? or just velocity? you have the levels to start hedging at 100....

--- 帖子 #772 ---
It works on levels. Do you think it would be a good idea to have it fire on velocity alone? I suppose we could try it. At one point I did, but now I just have h_top_level set to 100 (it's not the same), which really doesn't mean anything at this point.

--- 帖子 #773 ---
Yeah - I assumed that h_top_level is the max amount of hedges to fire. In this case, you actually had both level and top_level set to 100. So I just wanted to make sure. I was thinking we could fire on velocity alone. That way if you want to "hedge late" like 4-6 levels deep, you don't miss the fast action before it "turns on the hedge" using the levels. We could test it I guess. The vel_offset where the point where you want to trades to start right?

--- 帖子 #774 ---
Okay, here is version 05_D. It should fire anytime after first trade. Also, if you set h_velocity to false, it should work with h_rsi_entry as well ... just for comparison. Yes. Oh, there's also a velocity indicator in upper left-hand corner. ETA: Modified per post #776 below. Standardized h_rsi_entry and made h_velocity optional ... per p ost #781 . Also removed h_loss_factor as it didn't appear to be used and it wasn't working right. Also modified closeall code to include tp_by_level profit, which it wasn't counting. Added velocity indicator option to forward_trend ... per post #782 .

--- 帖子 #775 ---
Appears to be working like a champ! I will run some tests..... Thanks!!

--- 帖子 #776 ---
Okay, I had to modify it a bit. Before, it was still tied to each trade from the last level. Meaning it was just like having the hedge set to level 1, and firing at each successive level if criteria was met. I've now changed it so it fires anytime (approximately) after the level 2 trade is placed, so don't be surprised if a lot of hedges fire right at level 2, although the rest can fire anytime after that.

In backtest for 2010 on EUSUSD and GBPUSD, I see the Max DD in 11 September week and Christmas New Year , then we can avoid this times by making time filter such like this code : Inserted Code extern string S5="---------------- Time Filter"; extern bool NoSept11Week=false; extern bool NoThanksgivingWeek=false; extern bool NoEndOfQuarterWeek=false; extern bool NoChristmasNewYear=true; extern bool NoJuly4week=false; extern bool NoSundayTrade=true; extern bool NoMondayTrade=false; extern bool NoThursdayTrade=false; extern bool NoFridayTrade=true; if((NoSept11Week&amp;&amp;DayOfYear()&gt;=252&amp;&amp;DayOfYear()&lt;=257)||(NoThanksgivingWeek&amp;&amp;DayOfYear()&gt;=322&amp;&amp;DayOfYear()&lt;=332)||(NoEndOfQuarterWeek&amp;&amp;DayOfYear()&gt;=85&amp;&amp;DayOfYear()&lt;=95)||(NoEndOfQuarterWeek&amp;&amp;DayOfYear()&gt;=268&amp;&amp;DayOfYear()&lt;=278)||(DayOfYear()==344&amp;&amp;DayOfWeek()==1)||(DayOfYear()==169&amp;&amp;DayOfWeek()==1)||(NoChristmasNewYear&amp;&amp;DayOfYear()&gt;=345&amp;&amp;DayOfYear()&lt;=366)||(NoChristmasNewYear&amp;&amp;DayOfYear()&gt;=1&amp;&amp;DayOfYear()&lt;=10)||(NoJuly4week&amp;&amp;DayOfYear()&gt;=170&amp;&amp;DayOfYear()&lt;=195)||(NoSundayTrade&amp;&amp;DayOfWeek()==0)||(NoMondayTrade&amp;&amp;DayOfWeek()==1)||(NoThursdayTrade&amp;&amp;DayOfWeek()==4)||(NoFridayTrade&amp;&amp;DayOfWeek()==5)) { Comment("nstop trading in times."); return(0); } Dear ecTrade please review this code and add it to system , i think this will avoid many bad trades. sorry for my English

EC- Shouldn't the h_tp override the RSI exit if it hits it first? This hedge should have exited at 50 pips, but it went to 125 instead. http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...x/hedge-tp.jpg

--- 帖子 #779 ---
Sounds like it's working right. If override RSI is strong enough at the time it's supposed to closeout on TP, it will bypass TP in order to continue the trend. It also means the signal isn't anywhere "weak" enough to closeout using RSI exit, which is set to 50 both ways I believe. And by "50," this is the RSI setting, not the TP setting.

--- 帖子 #780 ---
Gotcha - no problem. I was trying to test if I shut down the hedge sooner, would it help? No need to change the program. I can just test this with RSI exit false.

--- 帖子 #781 ---
Okay, I made a few mods to version 05_D ... First, I standardized h_rsi_entry and made h_velocity optional ... although to use either, h_rsi_entry should be set true. Or, if it's set to false, the hedge won't work. That's just the way it's set up currently. To use h_velocity , set it to true. If you want to use rsi settings instead, but with velocity "idea," set use_h_rsi to true. Another thing I did was remove h_loss_factor, as it didn't appear to be used and wasn't working right. Plus, I modified closeall process to include tp_by_level profit, which it wasn't counting. Again, here is the download .

--- 帖子 #782 ---
Okay, I just added velocity indicator to forward_trend . To use, set use_velocity to true and, you might want shut the hedge off. I'm also not sure which period or offset settings are the best so, you'll have to experiment. Also make sure forward_trend is set to true. Again, here is the download .

--- 帖子 #783 ---
What do you mean by forward trend?

--- 帖子 #784 ---
when set forward trend to true i get error 2011.03.08 16:49:572010.08.23 14:46 Cannot open file 'C rogram Files (x86)Go Trader MT4expertsindicatorsJ_TPO_Velocity.ex4' on the USDCAD,M5

--- 帖子 #785 ---
This is a term others have used when describing an EA that opens orders while following the trend. While they describe the way this EA typically operates as counter trend ... although I think it may be more a matter of establishing a pivot point. I don't know for sure?

--- 帖子 #786 ---
Oops! Sorry. You will need to download this and put it in your indicator folder.

Hey, this test ran all the way from 6-17-09 to 3-19-10, although there's a big chunk of data missing between 9-28-09 and 12-01-09. That's because I'm testing it on a mini account and I am unable to get the data from MetaQuotes. I was mainly concerned with what happened between December and March anyway (on EURUSD). I started out with $2,500 balance and made $975 profit. I think the settings may a bit too low though. Also, if the data wasn't missing (that is, if it didn't fail), I could probably add another $300 to that.

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Oh well, it finally crapped out on May 10, 2010 ... with $1,500 profit.

--- 帖子 #789 ---
Hi, the system works great. Hats off to the coder. I only have one request, can this EA implement a increment on lot based on risk %? Meaning if i started with a balance of 1000 and first lot open is 1. after that it will adjust the lot based on maximum risk i am willing to take. example, 3% from current balance. so the next one, will scale accordingly? Is that too much to ask? thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #790 ---
EC- I don't believe the hedge multiplier is working right. I think it is stuck at 1. Here you can see I have it set to 2, but it is using 1. http://i1084.photobucket.com/albums/...multiplier.jpg Am I missing something?

--- 帖子 #791 ---
FYI - to use this system you need to start with either a lot of money or very small lot sizes. If you were to try to start with 1 on the first lot, your account would hit zero in the first week. You need to start with .01 lot sizes and have at least 2000 to do that. You want to make sure it can go 9 levels deep and only be maybe 50% of your account at that. (Preferably 15%) The "power lots" option does scale accordingly with your account balance. There are a lot of factors you can adjust depending on your risk level that can drastically change how much risk you take. 1) multiplier 2) hedge multiplier 3) start lot size 4) how many levels you want to go deep 5) the amount of pips as take profit on your hedge 6) the size of the levels - if you increase the 25 to 40 it will be less levels, but harder to recoup. As you can see - it isn't as easy as most EA's where you can just say 5% risk and away you go.

--- 帖子 #792 ---
This is kind of like what the power lots setting is supposed to do. You decide what's an acceptable lot to account size risk initially, and it will increment everything based upon that ratio (lots/initial balance). So, if you started out with a balance of $2,500 at .1 lots, by the time it gets to $5,000, the lot size will be .2 lots. That's the same ratio.

--- 帖子 #793 ---
tq for the clarification. I will optimise the settin then. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #794 ---
You're right. I created a special function just to calculate hedge lots but, I forgot to include the h_factor. Oh well, since I can no longer modify version 05_D, I guess we'll have to go with version 05_E. I haven't actually tested it yet, so I'd appreciate it if you let me know how it works, okay? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #795 ---
I do not use hedge, so no problem with me. But can someone try this setting and give comment/feedback? just rename the ext from txt to set. Cheers

--- 帖子 #796 ---
Okay, what folder are you supposed to save it into? And how do you load it afterwards?

--- 帖子 #797 ---
Rename it to .set, then you can put it anywhere. The default folder is the tester folder under the root install. But, you can browse anywhere to get it. In the expert properties dialog box, hit LOAD then browse to pick the file. I can tell already the start lot of 1.5 is not going to work unless you have 100,000!

--- 帖子 #798 ---
yup. the trade stopped at 3. ++ lot. not enuff money. i have adjust it to 0.5

--- 帖子 #799 ---
Hey, thanks! Oh, he's using increments set at 0.3 instead of lot multiplier, so 1.5 lots sounds like it might be okay, although it still seems a bit high. I also noticed he had range multiplier set to 3.0, which will probably put you out of range after the second or third trade. I'm thinking you probably don't want it much higher than 1.5 or, possibly 2.0.

--- 帖子 #800 ---
i got this error. 2011.03.09 21:44:47TestGenerator: unmatched data error (volume limit 379 at 2010.12.10 12:00 exceeded)

--- 帖子 #801 ---
Yeah, it almost always does that, right at the start of the test. It usually keeps running after that though. Aside from that, I tend to get a lot of order modify errors but, it still doesn't keep the EA from functioning the way intended. It probably wouldn't hurt if I figured out what some of these errors meant though.

--- 帖子 #802 ---
So, which version were you using here anyway?

--- 帖子 #803 ---
the D revise version. well, i had modified it back. i notice with one pair and bigger lots and no hedge, it cud be a disaster if the trade when more than -40 pips away. so now, i did 0.5 lot, with power lots on and hedge on. one thing i notice, with power lots on, u dont need bigger lots. but consistent daily small profit compounded to you risk %. all is good i think. still scratching my head to use the E version, wont place any trade but more error.

--- 帖子 #804 ---
That could be a problem I guess, especially if you've modified it three or four times in the same post, unless of course it was the most recent update? It sounds like you've got it figured out anyway, so I think I'll just skip on it for now. Are you forward testing it or backtesting it? It seems to work okay while I'm backtesting it, but I haven't tried forward testing it yet.

--- 帖子 #805 ---
4.1 revise 05 D version. because i could not use the E version.

--- 帖子 #806 ---
I also was not getting any trades after changing a bunch of settings. Sorry I didn't save the settings, but I had to hit RESET and start changing things 1 at a time and it started working again. There must be a certain combo of settings that don't work together. Sorry I can't be more help - just letting you know that freqzz was not the only one.

--- 帖子 #807 ---
HI ALL i testing this ea but i found for long time the floating loss is very large. whenever open level up 2 the level 1 maybe loss 50-70pips if the markets not change direction hit One-way market 200pips up price the level 2 also loss 50pips up and not stop loss .in 5m markets Highly volatile so i think can make the ea According to markets Direction to open level 2/3 trade? ex add in ma144 to Reference direction Or other methods As far as possible to reduce floating loss Avoid the encounter markets change direction . sor my poor english

--- 帖子 #808 ---
So, did it work straight out of the box, so to speak? Like I said, it seemed to work fine when I was backesting it. While I just opened it up to forward test it and the journal said it was loaded successfully. Of course I also said to set forward_trend to true and shut hedge off, which I just did, and rebooted, and it still says it loaded successfully. Although I guess it doesn't guarantee it will place any trades?

--- 帖子 #809 ---
hi everyone after month of testing this ea it is getting better by day. it is so precise on taking trades .ex hedge entry ,hedge exit ,power lot ,forward trend so many option that would make this ea perfect . except tiny problem is it blindly open up 2,3,4,5,6......which make account blown. just my thought

--- 帖子 #810 ---
Have you seen this? I think it might be more along the lines of what you're talking about.

--- 帖子 #811 ---
Yes - it was working, but after messing with so many true/false options it stopped working. So, there is a certain combination of settings that cause it to not work. (couldn't tell you which ones at this point) I hit RESET back to your default settings to get it work again. It loaded fine, so that isn't the problem. An example would be something like while using velocity true, rsi entry needs to be set to true also......that kind of thing.

--- 帖子 #812 ---
Okay, that's fine. My questions were actually directed more towards freqzz, who really didn't say much, except there was an error? ...

--- 帖子 #813 ---
Hey, I just noticed if you set power_lots to false it won't work. That's because power lots factor (pl_factor) needs to be set to 1 by default, which I wasn't calling out. And, since I am multiplying tp_in_money by this and, unless I specify 1 as a default, basically it's multiplying it by 0. So ...

--- 帖子 #814 ---
Hello, Which version is the best to use? I want to try it on IBFX micro account starting with $100 with leverage of 1:400

--- 帖子 #816 ---
The best version is the latest one - Rev E. If you don't want to use the hedge, just turn it to false. I might also suggest NOT to trade this system if all you have is $100. It will not perform the way it is supposed to. You will run out of margin so fast adding levels. It may only go 2 deep and stop firing the levels, drastically increasing your chances of wiping out the account. I would either wait until you have more money, or use a different EA. Just my 2 cents....

--- 帖子 #817 ---
Been running some test on this E.A. on a demo account. The best I can come up with in the optimization strategy tester is. profit - 2293.56, number of trades -216, profit factor - 1.40, expected payoff - 10.62, drawdown dollar - 6643.60, drawdown % - 59.88%. start_lot=0.9 range=82 daily_target=100 magic=22 r_multiplier=1.5 level=10 l_multiplier=2 increment=0.1 tp_1=25 tp_2=0 sl_std=60 tp_std=30 tp_in_money=5 h_level=3 h_top_level=100 h_tp=80 h_sl=25 b_even_set=10 h_offset=20 h_factor=1.05 bb_period=20 bb_deviation=2 bb_shift=0 k=5 d=3 slowing=3 price_field=0 stoch_shift=0 lo_level=30 up_level=70 rsi_period=12 rsi_shift=0 lower=30 upper=70 rsi_period_1=30 rsi_shift_1=0 lower_min=35 lower_max=33 upper_min=65 upper_max=67 fv_period=10 fv_offset=20 First trade it took was on january 27, 2011, even though I had that date set back january 1 2010. Last trade was on march 9 2011.

--- 帖子 #818 ---
just an addition. the key to profit is with this EA is. 1) small lots. 2) one pair. 3) small risk 4) small hedging level. And all is fine. But try it on demo first. cheers.

--- 帖子 #819 ---
ecTrade thank you for your work. I'm new to the EA thing, I'm trying to learn how they are working... I'm testing now, SWB Grid 4.1 revised 05 e. (I'm back testing on different periods from the last 6 yrs) it seems to work fine on EURUSD M5 2000$ capital, 0,01 starting lot, hedge off which settings should I try to adjust, how do they modify the ea-s nature? (or where can I find a little more info on it?)

--- 帖子 #820 ---
it would have failed 2011 jan 5-6... but there is no hedge at IBFX, so I don't know how to make it work "safely"

--- 帖子 #821 ---
Firstly I would like to express my admiration to all that worked on this very promising EA. I am using the e version with hedge set on true. As you can see from the image the hedge fires on level 4 with set TP and SL. After it hits TP and the price turns upwards when it reaches the Hedge level it fires again...and it goes on reaching the Hedge SL. Is there any way that we can make the hedge fire only when the price comes from one direction. If the hedge trade is a Sell then to open only when price comes down to the Hedge Level and if we are on a Buy Hedge then the hedge will fire when price goes upwards. I don know if I make my self clear plus the fact that I am code illiterate I don't really know if that is feasible at all. Thank you again especially EC for all the work you have done here.

--- 帖子 #822 ---
hey, i got some ordermodify errors in journal tab (1 and sometimes 130), but backtesting works fine. cheers, derox

--- 帖子 #823 ---
Error 1, mean no error returned from server and/or error is unknown, I dont worry about this error. Error 130, means invalid stops. In back testing you don't have STOPLEVEL control therefore it work fine, But in forward testing if your StopLoss is less than you STOPLEVEL it becomes an invalid Stop and you receive error 130. Hope it helps

--- 帖子 #826 ---
Dear EcTrader.. I am test n runn SWB ver 5... hedging is running well done.. Dear EcTRADER ... if you can help to modify or give the settings as below ... SWB version 5 now,,, when appropriate indicator to open buy position ... SWB new version 5 contra i need .. when appropriate indicator to open sell position (so contra to current version) I would like attempting to run 2 versions of the joint .. but can also be run differently when we want to do is turn on the ea new hedging version. above help him many thanks

--- 帖子 #827 ---
Can someone tell me if you can set the initial lot size to 0.01 (micro lot?) Thanks Rory

--- 帖子 #828 ---
as there are some brokers who has minimum lot 0.1 but minimum step 0.01 I'd do this change in rounding precision calculation: double lotstep = MarketInfo(Symbol(),MODE_LOTSTEP); if(lotstep==0.01){ prec=2; std=10.0; } if(lotstep==0.1) { prec=1; std=1.0; } btw, variable std id not used anywhere in code. EDIT And there is a bug with Daily target - I have DT 50, tp in money is 2. after opening 4 and more levels by my settings EA closing orders at TP reached: Order 1 +97.31 Order 2 +11.22 Order 3 -38.66 Order 4 -65.39 ------------------ sum is 4.48 but EA has closed trading for rest of day as order 1 had profit of 97 EDIT 2 solved by changing dailyprofit function from: if(TimeDay(OrderOpenTime())==day) res+=OrderProfit(); to: if(TimeDay(OrderCloseTime())==day) res+=OrderProfit(); //we are counting closed profit today, no matter when order has been opened EDIT 3 There is a problem with dailytarget, but most probalby it is caused by hedge or specific its settings - if daily target is reached by closing hedge orders, EA closing all open orders on second day open, even with huge floating loss. EDIT 4 I have no trades at any TF if forward_trend is set to true

--- 帖子 #829 ---
Since this is a martingale system and prone to blowing up accounts I think it would be great if someone could add a email alert to this to alert you when your account dropped below a certain percentage. That way you could possible cut your loss before blowing up your account and starting over. Otherwise this EA works very good, and can make up losses very quickly. Hope someone will give this some thought as I'm definitely not a programmer. Rory

--- 帖子 #830 ---
could anyone provide me a .set file. Because there is no trades since I added this EA to my chart... Thanks With regards

i checked the EA in back and forward test and it work very nice. but it have a some problem. for example when we run it on the chart, it don't print any thing in the chart and u can not check what it is doing. i thing it is necessary to print something in the chart that show the inputs value and the doing parameters.

Guys Having some joy with this ea, however it can come unstuck if there is a strong move against it, either during the day (UK) and especially during news. I am no good at coding but perhaps someone could add either a news filter and or a trading times filter. Think ea could be very good catching small moves during asian session. Paul

Hi All, Can you modify little bit of alteration, If lot multiplier option is ok, But I want TP and SL limit order option with martingale option Example 1st lot : 0.01 (array in lot size: 0.01/0.02/0.4/0.05/0.8/ optional is our choice) Multiplier: 2 ( our wish option: 2/3/4/5...) Step: 40 pip ( array option in steps pips: 40/70/100/90/120 our wish able steps level size) Tp: 50 ( same array method ) SL : 50 ( same array method ) if 0.01 lot is reach SL, then when it reach -40 pip, So 0.01 lot has closed, and open another 0.02 lot with SL and TP, lot: 0.02 Direction: same direction or reverse ( if direction = reverse, the buy order(0.01) is reach SL, another martigale order 0.02 is sell order wit SL and TP) ( if direction = same direction, the buy order(0.01) is reach Stop loss, another martingale order is buy (0.02)) is sell) can you add with your best EA, please bye ajentha

I have created a new EA using some of the ideas of this swbGrid. Instead of opening every 25 pips, it will open over a different algorithm that will look in the chart and choose the time to entry can be 25, 30 or more pips, it is a kind of neural network to find a S&amp;R patterns. you can check on: http://www.myfxbook.com/members/pfinancial I did a few modifications over the months, I still testing taking this to the limit. I am also using on my real account and it is on the link that I posted above. Is not so aggressive, the DD is lower and it is between 10% to 30% effective on profit. I am using in different pairs, and for now the best pairs are EURUSD, USDCAD, GBPUSD and USDJPY, the ones that I will never trade with this strategy are GBPCHF, EURGBP and EURCHF, these ones are too "trendy" and with almost no retracements.

Is it possible to modify the EA to increase the levels range size after it reach level 5 for example, to a higher range, let's say the double of what you are using from level 1 to 5, it will help a lot to avoid or delay the death trade. Sometimes the market move 50, 80 pips very quickly without reversing, but it is very rare that moves 150, 200 pips without reversing few pips to close at +$5.00 or at breakeven. Even if after increasing the range size the price keeps moving in only one direction without reversing at all, we can choose to close instead of +$5, to a negative value, like close everything when it reverse and the profit in money is -$20, -$40, -$50, etc. instead of closing everything at a stoploss and taking a big loss. Is anybody following this thread or interested in doing those changes to the EA? I would like to see those changes done on the original version, the 4.1.

--- 帖子 #863 ---
I've been using version 4.1.0.3 for more than a year, because of it is simple , to live trading. All I wish now if the EA able to automatically initiate : 1. Trailing Stop 2. Start lot size entry with relative to Balance/Equity, say x/10000 will be fine 3. Increase the range for higher level entry, say at a rate of 10% All this while I've been doing all that manually, and it increases my equity, especially at higher levels when the market is trending, get some pips (bigger lot size ) from pullback/retrace before the trend continues. . I trade Eur/Usd, and you all know how the pair moves now... Please help, anyone with programming expertise, very much appreciated

--- 帖子 #864 ---
Hi Ditto, you said you have been using this Ea for more than a year now, please if you can tell me how many times have you reach your max. level amount and what have you done in that case? It happen to me once, it reach the 10 level and I closed everything at that point with a big loss, to realize that few candles later the price went down and if I waited I could have closed with a profit. I think that increasing the range after a certain level will help a lot to give time to the market to retrace after a big move so we can close at least at breakeven. I hope someone can add this to the ea. Please, let me know your experiences with this ea, I like it a lot, but I think needs few modifications. Thanks

--- 帖子 #865 ---
This is a very good idea, I traded live with this EA in 2010 and all was going well until the GBP started to get beaten up. One week it went to L8 (vs USD), without a 25 pip retrace and the following week it reached L11 against CHF. The EA has the potential to make very good profits but, in it's present form, it can do serious damage to your account.

--- 帖子 #866 ---
Yes, it happened to me using original setting and a few times on modified settings. Burnt my accounts on the original and some of the earlier modified ones. Then I stopped using it, going back to my usual manual trading while keep testing the EA on demos, until I got the current setting which I use since last year. Main points in my setting are Start Lot size, Take Profit, Multiplier, Range, the use of Trailing Stop and the Time Frame which is 1 minute . I'll explain later...brb...

To Alpiberi: I am not a programmer but I managed to do those changes to the EA. You will see now 2 tp_in_money parameters. Tp_in_money1 is for level 1, and Tp_in_money2 is for the rest of the levels. Is set up at $25 (the same size of the range) and $5, if level 1 don't reach tp_in_money1, the Ea will close all open positions starting from level 2 as soon as it gets $5.00 in profit. You can modify those settings if you wish. Even though this modification improve the ea a little bit, the most important modification that needs to be done is the option of increasing the range as soon as the EA start open too many countertrend positions. Let's say level 1 and 2 at 25 range, level 3 at 35, level 4 at 40, level 5 at 50, etc. and this is just an example, it could be different range settings. I am surprised that those changes where not done when ectrade was working on this EA a year ago despite several people requested it. The hedging feature he coded in another version is a very good feature, but still with a fixed range, this EA will keep crashing soon or later. I will take a look again to see if I can manage to ad this feature to the EA, but it seems difficult. I hope some programmer in this forum pass by this thread and help us to modify it. To Ditto: Thanks for your reply. Please, share your settings when you have time so I can try them and see.

The overnight Yen move is a prime example of how this EA can blow your account, if you're running it 24 hours a day. EJ went up approx 300 pips, before any hint of a retrace. If this type of account wrecking price action can be countered, then the EA would be a world beater.

--- 帖子 #869 ---
I use the followings on 1 minute time frame : Start Lot : 1/10000 of Balance/Equity (maximum). My accounts are of non-standard (1 lot size = $1/pip value). Meaning that if I have $1000 in the account, my start lot will be 0.10 . Normally I use 1/20000 Range : Minimum 50. This is where I do it manually after a new entry is opened. I refer to support/resistance level to set it, but not too far away except at higher levels where the range may be more than 100 Multiplier : 1.5 tp_in_money : 10 pips value . Meaning that if 1 pip = $1 , set it to 10.0 Trailing Stop : I initiate it for every levels after L1, using the 15 points (150 points for 5-digit platform). This is where I wish someone could incorporate it in the EA because sometimes I missed doing it. The reason is the price might not retrace so much ( I got thousands of 1 pip misses) and then move away again. By using the trailing stop I can catch some pips to increase my equity especially at higher levels... That's all folks..thank you.

--- 帖子 #870 ---
Thanks Ditto, your settings are very close to the ones I was using except for the range that was smaller, but I knew that in order to survive the market with this EA the range had to be bigger, but at the same time, the bigger the range, the longer it takes to close trades and it take too little trades also, that's what I was talking about the feature of the adaptive range according to the levels. The good news is that I almost figure it out how to change that, I am doing some modifications to the EA and after I test it, I will post it for you guys so you can try it out. The feature of the trailing stop I will have to see later on if I can add it, but for now you can use this trailing stop ea so you don't need to do it manually, just add it to other chart and it will trail all your positions.

--- 帖子 #871 ---
Here is the EA with the feature for changing range values for different levels. Please, test it and play with different settings and let me know

--- 帖子 #872 ---
Someone uses this EA on a live account?

--- 帖子 #873 ---
Thanks for Trailing Stop EA Yes, the problem is with the range. That's why I opt for bigger range and manually setting it with reference to support/resistance levels. Since I make my living with this now, I rather wait longer for the trade to close than....you know what...!! Basically I use it sort of scalping the market, that is 10 pips profits. I usually got substantial closing trades before it got stuck where then the range settings and trailing stops come to play. One thing that I would like to suggest is to set the indicators at a longer period especially the stochastic.

--- 帖子 #874 ---
Thanks again . Surely will try it.

--- 帖子 #875 ---
Yes, I use it on most of my accounts.

I am just throwing this out there. I don't intend to change the subject of the thread. Here is a betting scheme that I usually use playing blackjack, and can also be used this with loss recovery with trading systems. I found this on the internet a long time ago, but have never heard a name for it. If you have ever heard of Oscar's Grind betting strat, this isn't it. I works a little different. As i said, I usually use this to gamble at blackjack. It can be quite long and tedious, but always gets me back above breakeven. This is with Blackjack, the odds are with the house. That's not to say I always win big, but I nearly always come out steadily ahead. With a trade system, that produces 60-70% wins, it is pretty unbeatable. As with martingale, need fairly deep pockets, and start with reasonable lot sizes. I have often wondered how this would work in the place of the martingale with an EA such as this. Drawdown might be pretty big, but this system can overcome long runs of losses, since the base lot size isn't increased on those losses. I thought one of the threads coders might want to put it into the swb in place of the martingale, or add it as an option. According to what I have read, only one in 1200 cycles will bankrupt you in blackjack. In trading, I keep track of the trades for each pair, and run this to offset losses. I have always been interested in betting strats and martingale especially, so I just thought someone here might be interested. Check the spreadsheet on the attached PDF and the chart below, if interested. BETTING SEQUENCE; BET ONE BASE LOT UNTIL THE FIRST LOSS CYCLE STARTS WITH FIRST LOSS BET ONE BASE LOT IF LOSE BET ONE BASE IF WIN BET 2 BASE LOT IF WIN BET 3 BASE LOT IF LOSE BET ONE BASE LOT IF WIN BET 4 BASE LOT continue until in profit, (usually 2 successive wins will do it) HERE IS A LONGER SCENARIO; CYCLE STARS WITH FIRST LOSS BET ONE BASE LOT IF LOSE NEXT BET= ONE BASE LOT IF LOSE NEXT BET= ONE BASE LOT IF WIN NEXT BET= TWO BASE LOT IF LOSE NEXT BET= ONE BASE LOT IF LOSE NEXT BET= ONE BASE LOT IF WIN NEXT BET= THREE BASE LOT IF LOSE NEXT BET= ONE BASE LOT IF WIN NEXT BET= 4 BASE LOT KEEP GOING RETURNING TO BASE LOT WITH LOSSES, AND INCREASING BY ONE BASE LOT WHEN WINNING UNTIL ACCT BALANCE IS GREATER THAN WHEN CYCLE STARTED. THEN RETURN TO BASE LOT UNTIL THE NEXT FIRST LOSS OCCURS... THEN RESTART CYCLE edit; sorry, I got the math wrong on 19th trade on the PDF. This should be a WIN, but you get the idea, I hope Thanks for reading, Shake

I think the probability of what you wrote here to happen is only the scenario that you made to work, is not secure, is not safe. It is mathematicaly a run to ruin. I forex some gambling technics are working as martingale, but even martingale has some rules on forex to works well. Not all pairs are good for that because some are very trendy or too sensitive to news... A few days ago all pairs with CHF reached a 1000 pips in minutes... I think is good to discuss some technics but some are not good for this market or markets...

--- 帖子 #878 ---
as you know swb grid works with stochastic oscillator, opens buy when reaches the level of 20 and opens sell when reaches 80. I was thinking if is not possible to open entries when it leaves the overbought or oversold areas??? With this you have margin and the direction to get profit without opening too many levels. I will wait for comments

Stellar results. Can you provide your setfile? Greatly appreciated. Rob

--- 帖子 #885 ---
Sorry for late reply. I found it here http://www.blackjackforumonline.com/...ack_System.htm a long time ago. If twee is reading, this a forum NOT A COMMERCIAL SITE and I have no affiliation what so ever. REMEMBER. A cycle can take a VERY long time, and can be quite tedious. I have always wondered what it would do with an EA with a reasonable win loss ratio. REMEMBER, YOU STILL NEED DEEP POCKETS, AND SOME NERVES TO USE THIS. There are times cycle takes so long, that I go ahead and leave the casino with a small loss, or end the cycle at near break even or small loss. I use this with my trading by keeping track of the lot on the system I use (simple buy at support sell at resistance). I merely start with a rather small lot size, keep track of the losses, follow the system with each successive trade. (I think this is a little similar to Nanning's recovery method on some of his EA's, but I am not sure). I have always wondered how this would do with a firebird, or martingale type EA. But mostly idle wonder and curiosity. When using it in Blackjack, you have an expectancy of winning about 45% with GOOD basic strategy. In trading, you have to have a good system, and still have good trading habits. Don't think you can get careless in your trading system. I used it once with roulette as well, with good result. I see someone here is working on that. Interesting to see how that goes. The hardest thing about using this is keeping up with where you are at. With a manual trade system, especially, where you are trading different pairs, you almost have to keep track of the pairs and run the system on each. Especially, since you are taking various amounts of profit with each trade. If you are good with spreadsheets, this is easy to do. I have included a PDF with a sample of what my spreadsheet looks like, except it has several more currency pairs than this. Also, I have attached my template which is in Open Office .org format. I have converted it to Excell, but don't know if it will open or not. Sorry, I don't have excell or office. open office is FREE on the internet and very similar to excell. BETTER, I think. Hope you enjoy playing around with this, Shake

Understand your concerns, and agree with you on one point; if you use this system, or any gamble system with a coin flip mentality it probably would be big-time destined to fail. I am not suggesting at all that this should just be plugged into any old EA, and expect it to work. I am simply pointing out that with an EA that is near 50/50, it might be interesting to see what happens. Supposedly, Mathematically, only one cycle out of 5000 will wipe you out. However, as I stated in previous post, I use this with my manual trading. BUT, I have a win rate of around 70% and it is not at all unusual for me to have 5 to 10 straight wins. I also always use 1:1 or better risk reward ratios. I have only had two times in two years, that I had the system go too deep on one pair that I just gave it up. However, the recent profits with the other pairs gave me profit enough to prevent this one cycle from damaging my account. As for the CHF, I agree that one could easily be wiped out. However, if you are in any trade with CHF at all at that time (I wasn't) the spread can bounce around by 50 or 100 pips. That happened to me in some years ago when the GPB made a move like that. It hurts bad. Shake

Hi, I set RSI to FALSE but I do some changes to BB and Stoch as follows: BB : I set it to False for not so volatile pairs such as EurGbp or NzdUsd. For more volatile ones, I set the period to 21, other settings unchanged. Stoch : k=21, d=13, slowing=3, field=0, shift=0, lo_level=20, up_level=80 Positions : I set the EA to trade with the trend that I refer to daily time frame using the above Stoch setup as guidance. *** Latest : I start to trade EurGbp again for the last two days Positions : Long Only Thank you

a casual reference to something off topic is fine, but if you want to conduct a full bore discussion please start your own thread, bear in mind this is a forex forum. perhaps going to a gambling forum would be worthwhile. im not trying to be antagonistic, just saying that if people click on a thread for a particular EA thats the information they want to see, and too much digression occludes good information about the particular topic/ea of the thread. peace.

No i didn't change anything but remember i started the day with a bigger amount and my trade went to .80 or level 5 -- .15 .20 .30 .50 .80 also my leverage i am using is 500 to 1, with a smaller amount and less leverage maybe your results will be different, i believe i started the day with $2984

--- 帖子 #901 ---
Thanks for that info. I was one of the early users of SWB and, in fact, had it recoded to take profit in pips and not money. Also, to make it more stable. It's the best trading system, ever, until you get that unexpected, Central Bank intervention or bad financial news. I traded it, as recommended by the developer, using a 25 pip range. I put a trade limit on of 7 levels. A pair had to go 200 pips, without a 25 pip retrace, in order to lose. This happened to me twice within 8 trading days!! It is scary and you can lose.

--- 帖子 #902 ---
Hello fellow trades and griddies, I am experimenting with SWB a lot, and I would have one idea to reduce dd a lot. The entry check for a trade is only performed once, a the first trade. After that it stupidly opens the recovery trades at the grid levels. What about modding it (which i sadly can't) to the following : If a grid level is reached, do the same BB / stoch / RSI check for this trade and only THEN open the next trade. It may go down a lot more into DD, but after a turnpoint it is way more likely to go into favoured direction again. This would reduce DD a lot, and match exactly my trading style... Blessing EA trades exactly that way, but has a very bad trend checking routine (MA only) which I also cannot modify... Regards, George

--- 帖子 #903 ---
don't worry, ur betting strategy is greatly appreciated. the betting strategy is much more reliable than the martingale. just pathetic losers don't understand the martingale's destined failure and yelled at you for "distraction"......

--- 帖子 #904 ---
Hi Alan, this is the worst part of the grid, you can't leave it working on those days that you know it will happen important news. About the VivaLasVegas ( I know is off topic) doesn't have any kind of entry rules, simply enter in one position with the same TP and SL and if it wins it will open again (no indicators to make entries) if it loose it will open in double next. I always open posistions doesn't matter the trend or signals, just open!

--- 帖子 #905 ---
Demo crashed here are the final results, prior to crashing it did have an 85% growth from $2000 to $3700 that was closed before catching the death spiral sell trade that saw it open 6 positions up to 1.20 lots. http://pastehtml.com/view/bf08i8nns.html Testing other variations that did not crash this week and so far has a 20% in crease this week. I started it this week $2000 it is now at $2429. This demos is following DittoDaliss recomendations from the thread http://pastehtml.com/view/bf09jv93c.html

--- 帖子 #906 ---
I think that an initial lot of 0.20 to an account of $2000 is too high. As I understand DittoDaliss posts he uses nini lots, so for an account of $2000 the ininitial lot is 0.20 mini lot, or 0.02 lot.

Hi guys, I've been testing different configuration because I was watching other systems and so on, and because of what I see with bmfx system, which is a manual trading, and this gave me an idea for swb grid and goes different from the settings that I know from the first one, 4.1. Ibeen tested on that one only, I love the first one even whit a big DD and some demos ripped off I think this has a potential and I didn't quit looking for a good settings. So you should use the swb grid 4.1 on TF H1 and the billinger bands should be, 12, 3, 0, the stochastic at 4, 2, 3 and the rsi you can leave it at it is. Range 30, levels 4, tp in money 45, if some one can code it with money management it will be great, and instead 45 usd can be 45 pips always. I've tested with 3000 and was great performance. Can you guys try it also and tell me what you think??? Cheers,

--- 帖子 #912 ---
What is the point of using both RSI and Stochastic? They are both momentum indicators and, therefore, one of them can be made redundant. There is nothing to be gained by adopting a multi collinearity approach with any system.

--- 帖子 #913 ---
Sincerly I don't like RSI, and I have the same though but because I'm not a coder I just use the swb grid for my strategy. If I could take RSI I would . But nevertheless it is good even with RSI.

Don't sweat it guys, I agree with Charvo, that I had was not wrong in presenting, and I also agree with the other guy that I might have pushed the boundary a little bit away from the SWB. By the way, the Viva Las Vegas EA does NOT include the one I pitched. It includes Oscar' GRIND. THIS is a different one. I agree that the martingale has great great risks, and you are playing with fire. It is possible to play with fire. I know a of guy that has traded with a martingale EA for years, and it has worked. He doesnt' run it 24 hours a day. He turns it on and off under certain signals and situations. Thanks, Shake

--- 帖子 #916 ---
Could you post your set file for this demo? Thanks

--- 帖子 #917 ---
I can tell that martingale can be you scape for your possible loss. I have trading for a long my own strategy and it includes martingale and the some patterns that I recognise, I am using in manual, I am using with my customers and so far never lost at the end. Yesterday was a great day for me, I made 5% in one day trade, I always make an average of 1% per day. So I must say for me martingale is a friend. You can use different strategies with martingale, some more agressive others less, and the money management is very important here actually it is 75% of the strategy for me.

hey guys, i'm using the adaptive range version of swb 4.1 here are my account size is about 110K (demo) my settings are the same as mcdxxx sometimes it is only getting 1 pip, is that right? i think vimel46 wrote that tp in money 1, and 2 were set to 3 and 1.5 respectively but starting lot size is .01 does this need to be multiplied respectively according to lot size?

--- 帖子 #921 ---
I think that you starting lot size is very small. I am running the same version of the Ea in a demo $10,000 account with starting lot o.10 tp in money 1 and 2 set to 3 and 1.5 and trade fridays false and from november 25 to december 8 I have won 1400 demo dollars.

Hi guys, Here are my trades: sell 1.0 eurusd at 1.30071 , close at 1.30066 sell 1.00 eurusd at 1.30047 , close at 1.30043 with my settings TP in Money 1 at 3.0 , and TP in MOney 2 at 1.5 Start LOT is equal to 1.0 shouldn't I be getting 3 PIP and looking for $30 profit. Is the Ea using the 5th decimal as the TP ? so should I change to 30 and 15 respectively? any help appreciated. i posted my set file earlier.

--- 帖子 #930 ---
yes this range settings have confusion, my range is not changing it stick on 40 pips cause i used $4 tp in money, 2nd and 3rd orders not opening in range it all in fixed 40 pips gap.

--- 帖子 #931 ---
I think all, that I set the tp in money 1 and 2 to 15 and 10 respectively and it seems to be working a little better....

Hello fellow gridders, I discovered a big bug in the SWB 4.1 with adaptive range. I hade a trade running with 3 levels, and because of my settings the 3rd level was closed due to TP. So far, so good. After that it opened 5 trades at once when it reached level 3 again ... and that took me into deep DD and busted the demo account. Be warned ... hopefully one can fix that. Cheers, George

Whoever let the ea ran would hv devastating results. Mine opened 5 buy orders and i manually closed them all, on demo acct. This ea does ok in NON major news period. Just remember to shut EA before news, during and after news 15mins to avoid breakouts, unless u are trading BO strategies. However, this EA would be more perfect, if we can set the operating time frames. Cheers.

I am the guy behind the modified version of SWB (with autolot and news filter- called Cescobot) and I did it in my early days on Forex. I can guarantee you: IT IS A TIME BOMB Stay away from any martingale. If you like that style of trading but you want to go for something that's less risky, try GridMeUp, using the SmartLot option (and at least 400 Eur Capital Good Luck with your trading Francesco

--- 帖子 #966 ---
What do you mean TIME BOMB? in some way it can blow up your account? Is that it? We can go around that with money management, low level and smartness...

--- 帖子 #967 ---
Yes, a time bomb. Depending on balance, leverage, lot-size, etc., the death-trade will come. Could take days, weeks, months, or more. Grid/martingales can never work over the long haul. Trust me on this one. Rob

--- 帖子 #968 ---
What kind of a statement is this? Or More? OR, just you wait and see, it will happen to you? Prior to the expiry on my VPS running out, I showed 2 accounts (FF trade Explorers) trading SWB using increment with a few modifications to the code and triggering on the original version of SWB produce over 300% gains in under 6 months, and run this same bitch live. (Sorry, I don't post my personal account info) Just because you haven't found what you are looking for, don't mean it doesn't exist. And that eventuality, is the same patience is as required for live trading and market success. Proper MM and some concept of market movements is key, but off of the simplicity in SWB, 100% automation is easier achieved than you would believe.

--- 帖子 #969 ---
is here any master in programming on mql4? i have a good idea for a change in positioning in swb to not to fall in very deep market movement if so please contact me or reply here

--- 帖子 #970 ---
Hi Soltan, Do describe your proposal here and if it is not too complicated I may be able to help. Good trading, Pipernet.

--- 帖子 #971 ---
hi pipernet swb takes it positions in a 20pips array for example 1)1.2040 2)1.2020 3)1.2000 . . but i want to change it in an irregular manner like 1)1.2040 2)1.2035 3)1.2025 4)1.2010 . . it could be define a range scale that difference between positions are not a unique distance (in top range scale is arithmethic and range is 5 so difference between positons is 5 10 15 20 .... as the swb default 20 20 20 20 ...) the distance increases as the price goes far from 1st position so if market moves slowly we reach our targets faster and if marget moves fast we get our positions far it decrease risk if it is possibe i have a better idea for series of steps (pardon for my english)

--- 帖子 #972 ---
Hi Soltan, That variation was already done by Fxmaps, see post 871 for the download of his version of the EA with variable spacing and good luck with the testing. Pipernet.

Running a martingale on a live account for six months doesn't mean much, bro. You're just lucky you haven't been caught in a big counter-trend move, yet. Run it for two years and report back. It doesn't matter how many modifications you make to the code - the core logic of adding to losing positions remains the same.

--- 帖子 #974 ---
if we know the dead trade will come... we can act accordingly... We can separete the wins for, lets say... two a three months, and start using this money in a new account... Create two or three separete accounts with the martingale system, when you loose completly you only loose one account... I guess this is money management.

--- 帖子 #975 ---
That has been one of the challenges working with SWB. In itself, it is looking for a trend change for a couple quick bucks, rather than playing with the trend for a couple more. 6 months, however, unless we see a complete market exodus again is a very fair trial. If you stand still in market long enough, price will pass you buy several times, so really, adding a position in trend to a losing position actually becomes a viable strategy. Now, the whole multiplier aspect of SWB is a bit of a pickle to be sure, but again, I add on increment rather than multiply. With profits streaming steady, and with my initial investment already covered and pulled, in all honesty, I really don't give a shit if things go for spins. We are entering into summer session, or trading the east direction where market range will probably not offer a lot of grand change. In these conditions a bot like SWB in its original form stands a pretty good chance of not blowing up. Now, I certainly ain't about to tell anybody what to do, nor how to do it. I spent my time in trades, spent my time working with others and now I spend my time enjoying a cold beer watching for the occasional trade and enjoying the sun... It's summer brother. Time to kick back, relax and enjoy the ride. I started with SWB (as well as a couple of others), in October of last year, not knowing shit about MQ4, or programming in general. With a little persistence and a lot of perseverance, I have learned a little more about market and enough about coding to make this a "so far", viable venture. Best of luck in your own quests.

Im exactly in your "october" last year... but im c0der kind of guy...

You've done well in a short amount of time. I come from a background of trading Blessing, live, for over two years. Blessing is probably one of the best, if not the best, grid/martingale EAs, due to its extreme flexibility. Before, and during the time I ran the EA live, I ran more than 300 backtests and 100 live demos. Even though I had the EA dialed-in, with respect to starting balance, starting lots, leverage, etc., I still ended up in a pickle when usdjpy went countertrend and Blessing hit 12 levels. I ended up closing the trades manually, and left the table at break even. Had I let the EA continue, it would have taken an equity protection hit equal to 50 precent of the balance. At that point, I decided to leave the world of grid/martingales to those willing to live more dangerously than I. Rob

--- 帖子 #978 ---
That's the thing I want to think about. I've always heard people saying "this grid/martingle system is safe if you start with XYZ $ and trad with 0.01" having XYZ as a big number. Now, given that there is no guarantee on the fact that starting with a big amount of money you'll save you account you still live with the certitude of a very SMALL gain compared to your balance. The final question is: are you really willing to risk 10.000$ to gain 1$? You still have more than 1/10.000 chances to blow your account up. To me the risk/reward ratio does not make sense, I would never accept such a bet. Traders running martingale/grid system with big accounts and small lot, in my opinion, are just accepting that bet, with the idea that there is no way the market can act so irrationally. Now, the bad news, my friend, is that the market can stay "irrational" longer than you can stay liquid. I've learned the lesson well, the hard way. Good Luck, and keep enjoy your trade. Francesco

--- 帖子 #979 ---
yeah, good 4 u, rob blessing is purely crap, and funny thing is that the few developers think they can sell them to make money, haha.

--- 帖子 #980 ---
Bob even mentioned: 'My belief is that all EAs use indicators and all indicators do not predict news stories or strong fundamentals and need monitoring or human intervention. No matter what indicators we use sooner or later the market will move in a way that will defeat them. Having some knowledge of fundamentals is important to Forex trading . For example, If Greece files bankruptcy or the USA and China get into a pissing match over exchange rates, no indicator can predict the outcome or change of direction either when or how much. Indicators have limitations and if you understand those limitations they are valuable tools in trading. For example, if Greece goes bankrupt sell Euros no matter what the indicators are saying.' Please don't set and forget your EA! I don't like grid/martingale EA too..., but I cannot found a stable profit non-martingale EA in now.... If you have found ,I would appreciate that you could give me suggestion.

Hi, i am looking to some one add daily and weekly pivot s/r indicator for bouncing price not for breakout in this swb ea and need two time filter Example if price touch resistence open sell and if price touch support then open buys if we have sell and price go against us upward then second open on another resistance or pivot what ever come first and if price donot go that high then open at price turning back crossing 3MA so on Note: between every and each trade should be 10 or what ever we select pip difference. it shuld not open any trade if any Resistance or pivot or 3ma crossing back come with in 10 or selected pip range and instead of multiply each trade we should use different calculations thanks

use_sl_and_tp=true does not work. It will not make any trades with metatrader 4 and Oanda . I am hoping that the tp_in_money=5.0 works even though that does not work. Is there a way to fix this? Can you delay the tp and sl modifications to a trade until after you placed a trade? I am currently also using Autostop EA to put sl and tp, but the whole setting would be useless if tp_in_money does not work. This might be because the EA is making the trades too quickly or something similar to that. I do not know, but again, it does not work with Oanda if I set that to true.

This thread has been dead for a while but I have been using the basic 4.1.0.3 with some decent results. The problem as with all martingale systems is that is does blow up. I am thinking if I can work round some timing sessions it may be more consistent, so I am wondering if someone out there would be so kind as to add an option of start and end times to the EA for back testing. Its probably relatively easy if you know how.

--- 帖子 #989 ---
Try this setting on EU : start_lot=0.01/range=38/tp_in_money=0.5/Capital about $450/the rest ootb I back tested it Sep 11 to Aug 12, looks safe &amp; did not blow up. Profit $420 which is about 90-100%. Drawdown $144. Maximum lots 0.16 happened only twice in 12 months. Of course there is a chance it will hit death trade. It has not happened in last 12 months, so u have to ascertain what this risk level mean to u &amp; decide whether u want to stomach this risk. To further reduce risk, u can switch off during announcements or NFP days. Although martingale is known for blowing up accounts, sometimes the demise could be due to missing historical data or lot size to capital is overstretched. So if your back test blows up, u might want to check the transactions or increase your capital. Take note if u increase the lots, u must also increase the TP money &amp; capital proportionately &amp; simultaneously. I think it is pointless to restrict the trading hours as there is no assurance that the trades can be closed before london closes. Hope this helps

--- 帖子 #990 ---
Hi all, I admit that for once I didn't read the thread from the very beginning, hope you'll forgive that. I know a little bit this EA and would like it to be modified a little bit.. Its a SWB grid with an hedging function in order to preserve our account from the death run. Let say that we're trading in a downtrend (to buy) with a 10 levels grid. At the level10, the buy order is triggered and the hedge sell order as well. Cause we're most probably in a downtrend rather then in an uptrend, the sell order is a lot more heavier. If the price goes up again , as the sell hedge trade is heavier than I'll close this set at the same time, when the Buy orders will close. It'll be then a loss, but : 1: There's no strategy without some losing trades,and there is not that much death run... 2 : You gave yourself another chance to still be in profit by going with the trend by hedging the entire position 2: it's a loss but it's always better than a death run. We can always minimise them by starting to hedge when there's more probability that the trend is going the other side.The more levels are against us, the more probability the trend is strong. We all could backtest this strategy with different levels... If the price goes down , I'd like the EA be able to close all the orders (10buy+the hedge trade) as soon as it has reached "x"$ TP. At the moment, It doesn't work exactly like that (either you set a tp for the hedge trade and close it manually, or you'r gonna hedge the hedge till the price reverse again....) Not my kind of trading.You just don't have to be greedy and don't forget the goal of this hedge trade : to secure the account, not to earn money from. Hope it make sense, and above all Hope A CODER will give a try, there's probably just few lines to add.

Martingale is very dangerous strategy because there is very high chances that we trade against the trend.It can blow your account. Here is another indicator that is built on buy/sell strategy. FOR EXAMPLE I Buy at================= 1.3000 TP ======================50 pips SL======================100 If price moves down then there is sell trade I tried this strategy and it is very successfull, I tried this on very complex market conditions" 2008-2014". But the main drawback is profit is very low.If we increase the profit then we also will increase the lot sizes too.You can check this EA. EA SETTING : =================== Deposit 2000 Stoploss : 100 TP=====: 50 martin_koeff 1 : 1 Martin_Koeff 2 : 3 Distance 0 to 9 = 100 pips

Hi everyone, SWB was quite popular in its early versions, but the weak entry logic makes it oftenly trade against waves (just like Ilan and AutoProfit that are already much better eas from my point of view) The thing most people don't understand about martingale is that all the bullshit you find for free is always a compounding of 1 sided entries (go full LONG if first entry was LONG and full SHORT if signal in the first time was SHORT) but the people out there that really use (limited) martingales as money management use it as a complement to good entries, and not as a strategy itself. Hence all the accounts out there making loads claiming they're just using martingales are actually a deeper thing. First you guys should find a short term strategy that has proven its efficiency (&gt;50% result with &gt;1/1 risk reward, or at least that gives no more than 6 loss in a row at MOST) then you can look into martingales to improve (at the cost of risk) your results through loss recovery. Cheers

Hi I have little changed the functionality of your EA SWB Martingale and made it as a Multicurrency Robot. Its running live in my account on 10 different currency charts and showing very good results. Uptil now it made 10% of Equity value in two days. I have also put Money Management in a different way. Attached is the Ex4 File.

I am getting constant OrderModify Error 1 while backtesting: " " OrderModify attempts to replace the values already set with the same values. One or more values must be changed, then modification attempt can be repeated." As a result of that (i guess) the trades are not closed at TP. It has most likely something to do with your changes, as it is the only version of SWB showing this issue.

Hi there, Given that this is a Grid based martingale, what would "opposite signal" mean in your case?

Thank you for your reply. I think this ea is an excellent way to fade into oversold/bought conditions, but on long runs you kinda easily gets locked in a position even though it is no longer oversold/bought any more. Through this grid base ea, I enter short/long on oversold/overbought conditions defined by bollinger or rsi or Both. If prices retracts from overbought to oversold I would like the ea to exit shorts and switch to long, even though the Take Profit criteria not has been met. In such case it would function as &amp;quot;semi&amp;quot; SL or early profit trigger.

Alright I understand your point, fair enough. I'm just afraid your grid triggers will get unvalidated way too often before you can recover from the grid re-entries, you should maybe look more into a pure RSI entry based martingale

Thank you for your input Edoranta. I would consider a pure RSI martingale if I knew where to find one Still the SWB is such a powerful EA, and with a small modification, i believe it will be even better ...

I also have this issue, the ordermodify fonction reset each time the price changed. This makes the journal overloaded and not working properly.

Hi, my name is shyam Can any one add moving average in this swb grid 4.1.mq4 ea Thanks

This EA has made many victims due to the multiplicity of parameters that determine overfitting. If the martingale is not well organised, with well calibrated spacing, it can be fatal!

Hello. Suggestions for this EA which would make it much more efficient- Have a set TP in pips in addition to a TP in a dollar amount. One order per candle only function A step lot instead of martingale (.01, .02, .03, .04, .05) I believe these additions would greatly help. I will gladly demo this and report my results here.
