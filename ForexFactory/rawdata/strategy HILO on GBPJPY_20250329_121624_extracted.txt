Hi, i give my strategy ... You need : on chart £Y UT240 : EMA8, SMA21 HIGH, SMA21 LOW, ADX 14,( gray),+DI (green), -DI (red) Strategy : Long : EM8 cross SMA21H at open next candle if ADX going up and +DI&gt;-DI&gt;15 Short : EM8 cross SMA21L at open next candle if ADX going up and -DI&gt;+DI&gt;15 this strategy is very cool and profitable ... Look on a month !!! the chart ut240 http://bp3.blogger.com/_6pkR1sG_7lc/...april+2007.gif

Hi Thank you for sharing. What are the TP and SL targets that you take? Simon

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Strategy looks good...wish you continued success

--- 帖子 #4 ---
hi Long : i put my stop 10 pips under SMA21 LOW reverse if short ... I haven't a target ... I stay in the trade as long as em8 is out off sma21 HI LO ( it's very hard if you haven't a strong psy ... because £Y has a big volatity ) and the signal is to exit is when adx begin to go down or the cross +DI and -DI or price cross ema8 regards

--- 帖子 #5 ---
looks good but I think adx 14 gives the signal too late did u try lower nomber

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Yes, when you stop? Thx.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
hi thank you for your quick response. But i have one more question when you write &gt; 15 is it the ADX line or the DI line Thanks again, Simon

--- 帖子 #8 ---
This is a newbie question Is there a significance in level 15? Senbanda

--- 帖子 #9 ---
for almeezan, adx14 1is too late ... you can use adx8 , i think , it's ok too ... for senbanda line15 AND 20 when +DI ans -DI are under this is a ragne period ans it will be better to be flat . About adx (gray line ) i m flat when it go down under line 40 ... and i tahe a trade when it go up ! bzh

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Now , i give you others informations about my stratégy ... To mesure the volatility , i use Standard deviation 13 with levels 0,003 and 0,0015 for gbp/chf ut240 ( i determine the level with my feeling ) To mesure the trend , i use sma55 ... Look at my chart ! BZH

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Hi BZH What pairs do you trade with this strategy? So far I have seen GBPJPY and GBPCHF which are the most volatile pairs, are these what you trade?

--- 帖子 #12 ---
hi Howard ! I trade £$, £Y,£F,$Y,$F ans sometimes €$,€F,€Y...only on UT 4H . I think my strategy is ok with alls pairs ... about volatilty , my favorite is £Y !!! ... but i must repeat ( it's very hard if you haven't a strong psy ... because £Y has a big volatity) you must have a strict money management ! regards ...

--- 帖子 #13 ---
I noticed a EA running on one of your charts, is it for your system or sonething else?

--- 帖子 #14 ---
scuse me EA running ??? i don't understand ... regards BZH

--- 帖子 #15 ---
On the first chart you posted it shows in the upper right corner that the chart has a EA attached to it. Is that EA this system? or something else

--- 帖子 #16 ---
ok, ... it is an expert.You can found it on Link Removed . But i have tested it and i found that it'snt very well.. So i don't use it now ... regards ...

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Thanx for the system, seems very promising. However (as anybody brings his own ideas), I backtested it for one month and found some good trades that could have been taken when ADX was lower than 14, actually flat and very low. I noticed that u take trades only when ADX is above 40, but if you look at the last few days, when ADX was above 40 level, the GY pair was flat, topping. Also, I will try to see how it works on 1h chart, because I cant deal with such big stops - on 4h chart u need at least 200 pips stop if u place them under 21 SMAs. I cant handle more than 50 pips for a stop

--- 帖子 #18 ---
According to BZH the ADX should be rising as an entry condition, no matter from what level; one of the exit rules is when ADX falls below 40 level. I find the system very simple and profitable if adhered to and with proper MM. Thanks BZH.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
hi , i will show you my next trade on £Y ... on the chart , you can see that it'snt the time to trade ... ema8 is in the HILO (sma21) and price is on sma55... volatility and ADX turn up. now i must wait two things to take a short : - Price will be down sma55 - ema8 cross sma21 low ans sma55 ... bzh ps for gagiul ... About stop ! Long :stop on sma 21 low short : stop on sma 21 high

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hi The chart which you posted is for GBPCHF. How do you use Standard Dev for your trades?

--- 帖子 #21 ---
yes, in this moment i use gbp/chf because gbp/jpy is not ready for a trade ... About gbp/chf : we have almost the conditions to take a short ! Adx is going up stdev is going up and above 0.003 we must wait the next candle ! If em8 cross sma21 low at the open of the next candle (in 135 mn ) . i 'll take a short trade at the open regards ps ; gbp/chf or gbp/jpy is for similar to trade and il like these

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Are you using the same settings for StDev on GBPJPY

--- 帖子 #23 ---
no , the level for StdDev(13) is different ... gbp/jpy ==&gt; 0.5 and 0.25 gbp/chf ==&gt;0.003 and 0.0015 i found them with my feeling ... regards ...

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Thank you

--- 帖子 #25 ---
the new stay me that it's not the time to go short now ! gbp/chf regards ...

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Is it because 8ema has not yet crossed the lower channel? Your 4hr bar closes at 13 GMT, could you tell me which broker are you using and in what time zone are you located, my 4hr bar closes at 14GMT, so it will close in about 30 minutes.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
hi my brooker is fxlite. i have'nt taken the because because ema8 has'nt crossed sma21low... Lool , why you must be wait the cross ... chart so no trade ... regards bzh

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Hi briezhfx, What is your avg. pips per month with this system? I hope I'm not being to forward; thanks in advance....

--- 帖子 #29 ---
hi , my system is very profitable on £Y or £F . the average is about 900 pips ou more per month ... I repeat , you must have a strong mental if you want to do this performance !!!! ... bzh

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Looks interesting, I think I'll check it out sometime, Thanks! M256.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
For the sake of those traders that do not know the currency pair signs, let's consider using the currency pair designations as they should be listed.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
£= GBP $= USD F= CHF E= EUR Y= JPY

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Hi Are these 900 or more pips per month related to 2 pairs only : GBP/JPY and GBP/CHF and for 1 lot traded on each?

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Only on £Y ... bzh

--- 帖子 #35 ---
GBP/CHF is taken long now. Isn't it ?

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Thanks Howard but message was directed to breizhfx that is still making these errors. Currency pairs should be abbreviated correctly so new traders can understand.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
In my humble opinion, I think u dont need much education to understand what is GY or UF. The Forex slang is much more complicated than this, so I suppose every1 can figure himself the meanings of these abbreviations like I did.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
I didn't take it because difference btwn +DI &amp; -DI is less than 15... I'll wait.. breizhfx What is the rule for a long? +DI &gt; -DI and +DI &gt; 15 ? or +DI &gt; -DI and +DI - (-DI) &gt; 15 ? I have backtested the last one (by sight) and it seems like it prevents from entering on false signals ...

--- 帖子 #39 ---
hi, the important thing is adx must going up, if adx +di ou -di &lt;15 i stay flat ... but sometimes wh +di cross-di under level 15 it's perhaps a begin ag a new goog long ... This the experience and the moneu management which say to you ( "its ok to go long ) .... regards .... bzh ...

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Good luck with your strategy... How's life in Brittany?

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Hello, this strategy is damn good. At least for strong trending times, like these days. The sad part is that I missed the last signal and Im missing all this wonderful upside action. You are right, with a strong MM, u can do very well with this strategy alone in the long term. Keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Hi am am new to this thread but so far it looks like an incredible system what about when the market ranges have you still had success when there is no trend and the market is moving sideways? Thanks, CLiff

--- 帖子 #43 ---
So your saying that we should wait until it breaks through the 50 sma before making the trade that we are sure that the trend is changing to down? Thanks, Cliff

--- 帖子 #44 ---
On my charts both pairs have been below 55 sma for a while now

--- 帖子 #45 ---
hi look at my charts gbp/jpy and gbp/chf and technical analyse, i think the trend up isn't finish ! regards bzh

--- 帖子 #46 ---
So are you saying that you reccommend using the 55 sma to determine trend and as long as the 4hr chart remains above 55 sma the trend is up? Here is my 1 hr chart... Thanks Cliff

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hi, about the trend , i look only UT240, but if you want to scalp ! you can use UT30 ... I think this ut is good for to scalp GBP/JPY ... But becareful, scalp only with the trend UT240 ... BZH

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Bonjour, bzh, and thanks for sharing a very effective, simple approach. Are you including the 20 DMI level to give yourself a little more flexibility, or are you fairly strict about the 15 level, please ? J.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
you said that you can scalp on the 30 min chart. But you also said to only trade with the trend. So are you using the sma 55 from the 30 min chart to determine the trend or are you using the sma 55 from the 4hr chart to dertermine trend trading with the 30 min chart. Cliff

--- 帖子 #50 ---
HELLO i scalp on 30mn chart with the trend on 240mn chart !!! this my rules ... bzh ... today i show you a new chart for trading this currencie ...

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Ok now let me ask you another thing what is the best way to filter out the ranges with this system? and What about the news do you still take the trades if the cross gives the signal even if there is news coming out? Thanks, Cliff

--- 帖子 #52 ---
hello ,about the news , when i trade with UT240 i forget the news and follow the trend ..; On ut 30 , i wait that price take the trend ... about range I have to things , adx and sdt ... I repeat to take a trade adx and sdt must going up ... regards bzh

--- 帖子 #53 ---
When you say ADX must go up do you mean it has to go up above 20 or above 40? thanks, CS

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Also I watch the EUR/JPY also and I see that a cross just formed on the 4hr chart do think that this is a good signal to trade? Here is my chart... Thanks CS

--- 帖子 #55 ---
hi , yes i think ,you the conditions adx is going up and wma8 is crossing sma21high, but you must wait the open of the next candle and take the trade if wma8 has crossedth sma21 ... regards bzh

--- 帖子 #56 ---
I am confused on how I use ADX can you explain again what I am looking for with ADX please... Thanks, Cliff

--- 帖子 #57 ---
hi , on your chart , adx is the line blue ... the dotline is +DI and -DI ... To take a trade ,adx must be going up ... when adx hook you can exit the position ... regards bzh

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Well I guess we got a good trade on Eur Jpy today. I bought at 161.75, ADX just jumped above 20 level. Im up 80 pips already. For GY no trades as ADX is still down and its dangerous.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
when you say adx must be going up when we get the cross do you mean ADX must be above 20, 30 when the new candle open? Thanks, CLiff

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Dear trader, I think the creator of this strategy states clearly enough how he uses the ADX in the first page. Please look and read carefully again, because your continous questions about how to use ADX are becoming annoying and prevent us from improving this strategy more. Thank you for understanding.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
hi , about adx ! in this moment, it is under 20 and going down. I m flat since the 19 april for a long trade ( my last trade was a buy the 24 april (scalp trade )) ... the chart is attached about it , i ve added 2 indics bollinger band (20,2) en stochactic ( 8,3,3) and changed wma8 by a hull moving average 8 ( yellow) bzh

--- 帖子 #62 ---
HELLO? Ii 'll give the EA stratégie (mt4) 4h for gbpjpy and gbpchf next week ... i'll tell you soon ... bzh

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Hi ,I like this system it's great(almost) just what i looking for . I noticed that cross on +DI and -DI makes good early confirming signal for exit or possible entry,very early signal which is really great(it means BEWARE - something is going on).I hope it helps someone .I use only 4H thats ok with me. P.S - Sorry for my bad english --------------------------------- Regards

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Yes...it is good to have a bit of a warning ...sometimes you get too busy watching other signals to be aware of the +Di and -DI and what they are showing. Good point. Welcome to FF!!!! Your english is fine btw

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Your right, if you can figure it out, anyone can....lol

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Instead of jumping on this guy for no reason, it would be easier to help him out and answer his questions. That is what this forum is all about.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Yeah, you are so right, thats why I suggested it in the first place I think we might have a sell trigger soon on both GBP/JPY and Eur/Jpy.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Hello , here is my chart ! for we have the first signal for short ( adx up 20 and -di&gt;+di ) . Now, we must wait two others signals ( std &gt;0.3 and ema8 cross down sma21low) ... regards ps on the top and right of the chart , you can see the EA ... contact me if you want the EA system

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Hi, thank you for sharing your system. I believe we have a short signal on USD/CHF. Please confirm.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hi traders, about mahilosystem, it's good now to start it ! if you want to trade in manual ; you can see resistance (blue) and support (orange ) I don't tell you what you do if price cross them !! usdchf , i confirm , there's a short signal ! regards

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Did you guys take the short signal around 238.50? I guess the setup is perfect this time, ADX and DI- look very strong, so I really hope it will go down for a while. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
nope, i didn't take that short signal coz when i see on Daily charts , there's a strong support at 238.33. so does on 4H charts, there's a strong resistance at 238.80. so the price now beetween them. i just wait whether it's break up or break down. then i'll take the trade. hmm ... maybe yes, maybe no.. can't wait what will happen

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Can you tell me what helps us StdDev and can you define StdDev levels for others currency pairs .(I like this system a lot ,but for now i don't use this indicator. ADX tells me almost everything EARLY - almost , but i think the system needs something else too for times when price just bouncing up and down over 55SMA). THANX

--- 帖子 #74 ---
HI ! ok here , there the differents mahilosystem in attached files ! regards bzh

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Can you please tell us your StDev parametres for each pairs? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #76 ---
the others ...

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Are parametres of the indicators for all of this pairs the same? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #78 ---
no, i gave you the differents EAsytem for UT240mn only . You can see the parameters ... if you want to trade on another UT , you must change the parameters ! regards bzh

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Thanks for sharing! But I'm interesting in manual trading. Can you post parameters for majors and crosses for your indicators? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #80 ---
the system can trade in semi auto ... bzh

--- 帖子 #81 ---
I know, thank you! Can you post your parameters or it's your commercial secret? Thank you anyway!

--- 帖子 #82 ---
And... how do you use StDev? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #83 ---

--- 帖子 #84 ---
These are EAs, they should be placed in Expert Advisors folder

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Do you mean : C:\Program Files\MetaTrader 4\experts\indicators\ or C:\Program Files\MetaTrader 4\experts\ or ? btw, thx Howard

--- 帖子 #86 ---

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Hey breizhfx, I would like to test the EA on 4H GBPJPY, but as I see it, the EA for this pair is not posted? Could you please clarify the settings or post this EA also, thanks in advance, Pipcruiser

--- 帖子 #90 ---
4h

--- 帖子 #91 ---
I know, thank you! Can you post your parameters for all pairs you prefer to trade or it's your commercial secret? Thank you anyway!

--- 帖子 #92 ---
hi, pipcruiser and traders! if you want to try it ! £Y is in attached file !!! rem : this system is updated , now ema8 is out ! i ve puting sma5close and sma6open , it's better to follow the trade and exit it ! regards bzh ps : soon, i'll have a new version for you ...

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Thank's buddy

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Hi Breizhfx, Many thanks to u, i got a lot of pips from u'r latest method. Now i'll will try using sma5 close and sma6 open. i'll forward test this, and i'll post the results and of course hope it works btw, can't wait to see new version of Hi Lo Strategy... Happy Trading Breizhfx and all taders in this forum ...

--- 帖子 #95 ---
What's the meaning of niveaustd and slippage at the parameter? Regards

--- 帖子 #96 ---
When u used sma5 close &amp; sma6 open, did u still use sma21 high &amp; 21sma low as entry ? or just sma5 close &amp; sma6 open to determine u'r entry ... thx ...

--- 帖子 #97 ---
is this thread dead or something ??

--- 帖子 #98 ---
hi, sorry , i ve nothing to say about it ... the system is for me ok ... I trade with it ... only on GBPJPY ans GBPCHF ... because the results are better ... I work on another system and i test it at this moment ... regards ... bzh

--- 帖子 #99 ---
actually i've got some question to ask.... since you put out 8EMA and replace it w/ sma5 &amp; 6 do we enter the trade if both sma5 &amp; 6 cross sma21 H/L ?? and btw u said you have a new version is it still the same strategy w/ improvement or it will be different ?? i'm still trying to test this on demo acct

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Nothing more to say the system is perfect. you may put 5SMA 6SMA and 8EMA and as you see 5SMA and 8EMA have almost same behavior at entry point. you can use cross between 5SMA and 6SMA as exit(or possible re-entry) confirmation and ,when DI+ and DI- has cross too the signal is very strong. Regards

--- 帖子 #101 ---
ok thanx i'll try it

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Hi Breizhf could you please tells what is the most up to date method and what is the best time frame i have read all the thread but a bit lost it would really help if you or someone could post a template of the lastest method please. With thanks David-T

--- 帖子 #103 ---
hi, myxi79 i agree , my system isn't perfect ... sm6 &amp; sma5 is like ema8 , but i prefer these sma to manage the trade ...

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Hi traders , look at my trade ! i ve taken this trade a little late, because i ve benn waited that standard deviation cross 0.3 bzh

--- 帖子 #105 ---
i'm in this trade too .GBP/JPY +220 pips so far open at 21.05 AND GBP/USD +100 pips open at 23.05 GREAT SYSTEM !!! P.S. I still don't use StdDev and i can't understand why to use it ,but you know everything that no harms us helps !!! Regards

--- 帖子 #106 ---
hi, myxi, my trade isn't closed yet. I see you are entering at the signal ! Good ium happy for you ! beautiful trade !!! About StdDev, this indicator is like Bollinger bands, but i prefere it to detect volatility and confirm the trend with adx ! this is the reason that my position was taken late than yours , because i have waited the levelcross and the confirm of the breakout of the resistance ... About EA, i use it in semiauto ... I prefere for this time ... BZH

--- 帖子 #107 ---
do you think we have a trade setup here I see a cross and adx is up? What should we wait for now? Thanks, Cliff

--- 帖子 #108 ---
hi, you have'nt the same indicator ... Sdt where is it ? lok at my first thread ... I also say that you are the only responsable of the decision ... my hilo sytstem dont' use macd and sto ... i think there too much indicators ... regards bzh

--- 帖子 #109 ---
re... this my chart , for this currencie, i wait the level cross of sdt ans the breakline red bzh

--- 帖子 #110 ---
having trouble setting up standard deviation what settings do I need and how do I setup this indicator? Thanks, CLiff

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Ok I think I got it now... so you say the best time to have entered this trade was when standard deviation crossed the 0.3 level at the break of support? or do you also reccommend entering a trade if just ADX give us the signal?

--- 帖子 #112 ---
I'm still demoing this strategy so what would we need right now for conditions for a long entry? Cs

--- 帖子 #113 ---
hi with your chart, yo don't go long because adx says short ! So you have a mistake , parameter Adx is 8 not 14 ... I put my chart , i m in the trade ... bzh

--- 帖子 #114 ---
so you say the best time to have entered this trade was when standard deviation crossed the 0.3 level? or do you also reccommend entering a trade if just ADX give us the signal?

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Hi, adx 8 is a very soon signal , i must recommend a confirmation like (ma5 cross sma21H &amp; sdt levelcross 0,3 for £Y ! regards bzh

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Look at my chart ! at the second vertical line dimgray ,+di cross -di very soon but adx go down. On this candle , ma5 has just beginning to cross sma21h ... And the best entry is the open of the next candle , because , +di crossed -di, sdt &gt;0.3, adx &amp; adx is going up !... bzh

--- 帖子 #117 ---
so your saying that we should not use EMA 8 anymore and even if we have the crossover signal if adx has not gone up yet we should wait until it does then enter the trade? CS

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Hi ,yes , you must have 4 signals, for a buy ( adx go up &amp; &gt;20, sdt &gt;à.3, +di&gt;-di , ma5 cross sma21h ) &amp; reverse for a short ... bzh

--- 帖子 #119 ---
should the best signal be when ADX is above 40 and when std cross over .3? Thanks, Cliff

--- 帖子 #120 ---
about SMA 5 it must be applyied to Close or to Low? And can you now please rewrite your setup because on first pos you have EMA 8

--- 帖子 #121 ---
For the Standard Deviation, what Method (Simple, Exponential, Smoothed, etc) do you use in the settings, and what do you "Apply to (Open, High, Lo, Close, etc.)?"

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Please confirm a Short entry: adx go up &amp; &gt;20, sdt &gt;.3, -di&gt;+di , ma5 cross going down below the sma21L

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Please confirm, this would have been a valid short entry: Attached Image

--- 帖子 #124 ---
IS this a long? This would have turned into a losing trade. Any suggestions? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi, yes it 's the good entry ! BZH

--- 帖子 #127 ---
should the best signal be when ADX is above 40 and when std cross over .3? Thanks, Cliff

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Could this be a possible short entry starting to form? should the best signal be when ADX is above 40 and when std cross over .3? Thanks, Cliff

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Cliff, Would you mind posting thr indicator that counts down until the candle close. The one you have running on your chart? Thanks

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Could this be a possible short entry? should the best signal be when ADX is above 40 and when std cross over .3? Thanks, Cliff

I had this indicator. I thought yours had countdown timer function.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
hi, traders Look at my chart ! I ve taken a long ( I know , i ve anticipated the signal , but , i think , it' the good way ! ! bzh

--- 帖子 #134 ---
I add a zoom chart !

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Hello BZH, I have and followed this with interest - I did a search for ADX and came up with your thread, which sounds brilliant! I am new to using EA's, and had loaded it up on the MT4 platform on my memory stick. I opened it up yesterday to do some study at work on the set up , only to realize at the end of the day when my broker sent me a statement that I was entered into a position in my live account! Well, it entered long - on the top of the same leg you entered at 241.22. It went up a bit, then sank, getting to within 1 pip of my stop! I see there is a 100 pip stop and 300 pip target. I decided to leave it on and watch it - use it as a learning experience. Right now, I'm just below breakeven, so I am glad of the 100 pip stop (I trade the GBPJPY, so know you need that large a stop) I am just amazed that it held! What I would appreciate (and many others following this thread) is some guidance on the use of the EA. I did see any of the bars and data that is on the right side of your last chart - I think I was expecting to see that - is that not a part of the EA? It looks like a radar shot of what is happening across the timeframes, and a good visual to evaluate a position. I take it the daily average is the ATR? What period do you use? Your explanations would go a long way to helping me and others embrace this strategy and your EA. You say you use it on semi- auto; which bits do you do manually and where do you allow the EA to take over or start? Many thanks for this brilliant strategy mac18

--- 帖子 #136 ---
hi, traders ! thanks mac18, Now i give you my method about a good entry 1 ° you look adx on 4H chart When it' ok 2° you look on 30mn chart to choose the best entry Like my chart attached my technical analys

--- 帖子 #137 ---
ok sounds good for the entry but what about the exit what is the best way to exit the winning trade? Cliff

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Hi again, BZH I thought you would be flat - since you trade in the direction of the 240 min trend, as determined by the 55 SMA, which is currently below price, indicating it is still in an uptrend, but you entered into a short position on the 30 min chart. I see that the 5 SMA had crossed the 21 L on the 240 chart, but the short trend had not been fully established. Are you using another set of rules? A tighter stop and limit perhaps? Thanks, mac 18

Hi, i often trade on 30 mn chart to take some pips ... I i show you my technical intraday ... bzh

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Hi BZH, Thanks for the charts. Looking at the 30 min chart, you seem to have posted your entries (red dotted vertical lines) once the 56sma have crossed correctly, but it still had not crossed the 21 low sma. Is this an adjustment for the scalp trade, but using the original rules for the main 240 trade? It might help to give us your 30 min scalp rules - I thought it was about the same as the 240 min one, but it may not be. Thanks for your replies, mac 18

--- 帖子 #141 ---
hi, mac next week i try to give my scalp rules in 30 mn ... on my blog ...

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Could this be a possible long entry soon? Adx 40 Almost at the cross? Cliff

--- 帖子 #143 ---
ok we got entry from original rule, but the price is down now, so any opinion from others?

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Heriyadi - the way I understand it, we don't have a long entry till the 55 SMA - white on your chart- is BELOW price action. The 5sma needs to have crossed ABOVE the 21H, and the other factors (rising ADX, SD &gt;0.3 etc) It looks like BZH may use the 30 min to scalp, but I still am not sure of his criteria, since he says to follow the 240 trend (as defined by the 55 sma), which was still short as of your chart, and seems to be satisfied with the 5/5 sma cross, not waiting for it to cross the 21 H/L. Perhaps he will elaborate? Some recent charts he posted were not strictly following his original rules as I read them - there are daily charts now in the mix. There seems to be some 'early' entries, before all the original criteria are satisfied, esp the trend part, so I think that one must be aware that it may not be a strong entry, might even reverse, and manage it accordingly. Hope that helps, mac 18

Hi traders ! I must sayt to you some things about the rules ! I ALWAYS trade with the trend ! but i have two technical : trade with 4H chart or scalping in 30mn chart. when i trade on 4H chart , i take a trade in the same direction of daily and weekly and PRICE with MM55 ( above long , under short) on 4H chart !!! when i trade 30 mn , i take a trade in the same direction of 4H and daily and PRICE with MM55 ( above long , under short) For founding the trend , i use the cross of DI ... look at the chart ! bzh

--- 帖子 #146 ---
I must be missing somethig about the various entry criteria: I thought trend was determined solely by the position of price in relation the the 55 SMA. I'm not sure how the DI plays into it, by which I assume you mean the DI+ and DI- crosses (components of the ADX) Looking at the daily chart, there is the beginnings of a cross of the 5 sma above the 6 today, but it has not crossed the 21 H. The 55 SMA is below price, so is that indicating an updtrend? The 4 hr chart shows the 5/6 SMA cross had occured 11 June, but the 5 sma did not cross the 21 H till 21 June at 8 am EST, BUT, price is still below the 55 SMA! At which point would you have entered a long position for the 4 hr trade? Will you wait for price to rise above the 55 SMA on the 4 hr chart or not, thus using the long price position from the daily? and would you wait for the 5 sma to cross the 21 H or not (or should that be a cross of the 21 L)? For the 30 min scalps, if we traded in the direction of the daily, that would be long for quite a while back. If we use the 4 hr trend, it was mainly short from 7 June till early today if I am still using the 55 sma as the trend guide. I suppose my question is, if you have the correct 5/5 sma cross, and adx is rising, you can enter a scalp trade on the 30 min without waiting for crosses of the 21 H/L? Love this trade idea, but seem to be getting confused on the various entry criteria lately. Please help! mac 18

i don't know if breizhfx invented this system or copied it from somewhere else, but making it public attracts my gratitude! i made my own ea based on his system and i'm testing it for about a week and i say it is very very promising! i'll test it for a while, and if everything's ok, i'll go live and from first profit i'll donate breizhfx a good portion of it! and then i'll begin managing accounts , but that's another business.... again, thanks for the system and you will hear from me in the near future!

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Hi MM, Mind telling us what your parameters are? I think I understand them, them something turns up and I am left wondering. I would like to know what seems to work out in your testing - I'm assuming you use both the 4 hr and 30min (to scalp) timeframes? Any chance we could access your EA? mac 18

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Hi, thks marketMaker ! I invented this system. It is the consequence of long searches(researches). i ' gave this system because I consider that everybody has to have a part of this magnificent cake on this market of the FOREX... Other thing, EA is not perfect !. I made it by means of a site of assistance for the programmation .because I am not a programmer mq4. If somebody nice could help me to make this automatic system more perfect it would be superl! excuse me about my english , im french ! BZH

Did you go long breizhfx vbmenu_register("postmenu_1468260", true); after the market croseed the 55 ma and if so how did you determine your entry? Thanks. Cliff

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Hi, cliff, scuse me , if you short , you haven't understood my system ... the best entry was about 241 , 00 . If you haven't taken this trade you are late about 400 pips !!! now it' s too late to take a long position on 4H chart . The only possibility is to try to catch the trend on 30 mn chart !!!! regards bzh my technical analys

--- 帖子 #152 ---
the 30 mn chart ! for Cliff ! bzh

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Thanks so when you took that trade at 241.00 long on the 4 hr chart you just waited for the 55 ma to be on the long side and adx to be up? Also on the 30 min you are waiting until adx goes above 40 and ma 55 above market? Thanks. Cliff

--- 帖子 #154 ---
yes cliff , you have understood ! but about adx must to be &gt;&gt; 20 . If adx &gt; 40 and going up it's better bzh

--- 帖子 #155 ---
in the future can you start to possibly post your trade entries when you reccommend taking them? Thanks, CLIff

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Yes ! ipost my futur entries ! hi traders , Somethings about standard deviation indicator ... The chances of success of the trade are very good when standard deviation indicator is &gt;0.5 or more . i' ve determined that 0.3 is good , but look at the chart ! when it's &gt;0.5 ... marvellous !!! Other things, I decided to delete the ma55 and to take trades in the direction of the weekly and daily , always when ma5 cross the hilo.I considere that the entris are much bette ! bzh

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Do you think that the eur/jpy could be a possible buy soon if standard deviation rises above 3 and adx goes back up above to 40? Thanks, Cliff

--- 帖子 #158 ---

--- 帖子 #160 ---
I return to the thread and study it .. now I found that chart over 55 sma so I will not go short yet if it cross 55 sma I'll go short under 1.3360 or if it cross 21 sma hi agin i'll go long over 1.3420 what do u think ?

today the second week of testing is ending. i tested the method on three accounts with different pairs on each account, with 1/5 of equity used on each trade, thus compounding with every rise in equity. does anybody guess how well those accounts went?? one 5 times starting balance, one 6 times and last one 3 times !!!!!! and that in just 2 weeks! don't you believe me? look at them. in account history they have "adx" or "adx trend" comment. i use my own ea based on this system, and at the beggining of testing, not knowing exactly when to allow live trading, there were a few unjustified loosing trades, but after that all went well. anyway, next week i go live, and as i promised, i'll donate breizfx a portion of first profits as father of this system... here are the accounts and investor passwords to check the last 2 weeks trades. thanks for reading and i wait for your comments. 1483659 bo0shvr 1495105 rngk6cs 1497593 aad0mnd they all are at interbankfx

here is a question because I wasn't sure about this if the market is above the high low on the 4hr chart for gbp/jpy and adx is going down and then the market remains above the high low and then adx rises back up again do you think we should take that trade? Thanks, Cliff

--- 帖子 #167 ---

so can u send or post here?

--- 帖子 #169 ---
This is very similar to Joe Ross's Camelback technique. About the only difference is he uses different period MAs, only one MA outside the High/Low channel, and no other indicators. For those interested, Click Here (PDF document).

--- 帖子 #192 ---
HI CLIFF , diamani is an Indicator to measure the volatility. With my first test , i think that it is better than standard deviation ...Especially in the beginning of the crossing of the green and white line ... but there is a red line , and i don't know, for the moment, the meaning .. bzh

--- 帖子 #193 ---
The red line is NO TRADE zone when green line is below white line, you can see the NO TRADE wording on the indicator as well

ok here is a question if you have an adx going up signal on 4 hr but then check 30 min for entry and adx is going down when do you enter? see pic for detail.. Thanks, CLiff

--- 帖子 #196 ---
hi, you must wait when adx cross up 40 on 30 mn chart ... bzh http://breizh-forex-trading.over-blog.fr/

--- 帖子 #197 ---
but adx was above 40on the 30 min chart what do you mean? Thanks Cliff

--- 帖子 #198 ---
I was demo trading this strategy I thought the best entry is when we have a long cross 21ma signal on the 4 hr chart adx is going up 40. Then I thought we are supposed to enter at the open of the next 4 hr candle as long as adx is rising. So what then does the 30 min have to do if we are trading off the 4 hr? maybe Im confused... Thanks, Cliff

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Sorry , cliff, i don't often use the 30 chart ;I use it sometimes , only if I missed the signal of 4 hours . The cross of hilo is the good signal . Yesterday , the signal was very good post #189 (155 pips in the pocket !! , very cool ) bzh

Hi bzh nice trade I was not up for this one what is the best way to alert yourself when the gpy/jpy breaks important support or resistance levels becuase I was looking at 249 as a break of resistance. Also how is the damini indicator going? Thanks, CLiff

--- 帖子 #210 ---
But when i shoul take positions??? When ma5 cross Ma 21 High???

--- 帖子 #211 ---
hi cliff , i explain , the yellow dot line of left to right : the 1 st line shows a hook of adx line, it 's riskly to take a position in this bullish move on 4 hours chart , but it's possible to take it on 30 mn or 1h charts because we are in the trend of weekly . the 2nd line shows diamani says not trade and you can confirm with the standard deviation which less than 0.3. the 3rd line shows the cross of ma5 &amp; ma6 , adx going up std is going to cross 0.3 , and diamani says trade ! and you buy at the open of the candle which is after the third line ..

--- 帖子 #212 ---
No , it' s only a signal , you need a confirmation, look at my first post i explain the technic ...

Hi BZH, I was under the impression that the 21ma's were simple, but it appears that's incorrect, and it should be smoothed? Plotting it like that, my 55SMA now falls in between the 21h and 21l (currently touching the 21l) Please confirm that is correct. Thanks again, mac18

Hi BZH when u take a trade on a 30 min chart after you have a cross of 21 ma and adx going up when do you enter on the 30 min on the open of next candle after the cross? Cliff

Hello BZH what is your new trade reccommendation for gbp/jpy? Cliff

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Hi all! I am quite new to the MT4 software, only has a demo account for it (interbank), and I am using it to try and get a feel for BZH's system. So, I applied the experts he posted to the relevant 4H charts. GBPCHF recently fired off a buy order, and I am rather puzzled. I mean of course the pair is in an uptrend, but using the default setup described here (with 5MA and 6MA instead of the 8MA), I cant see any cross for the fresh 4H bar. Anyone got the alert too, or I am doing something seriously wrong?

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Hi BZH could this be a possible long soon? Cliff

--- 帖子 #253 ---
hi , look at my blog about the new setting. About EA , i use it only to have a signal , but i don't trade in auto ... ans i tested a new version £Y mahilo-v4.00, but i m not happy about it for the moment ...

--- 帖子 #254 ---
yes , it could be LONG possible ! but you must wait and see the next candle &amp; go to look my blog , ive put an analys to the 4H chart ...

--- 帖子 #255 ---
I would never have enough guts to let a script handle my real money, so like you, I intend to use these EAs as signal-alert only. But I am afraid my French has failed me: could someone please provide me a link to the part of the blog where I can find the new settings? Thank you!

I think not: ema5 is not crossing smm21L, at least on my chart.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Isnt that true that its short signal if yellow ema 5 is crossing below the ema6 blue nad adx is up +DI&lt;15&lt;-DI and DAMINI says Trade and std is above .3 Thanks

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Breizhfx just recently summarized entry rules for me, you can find them at the top of this page.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
hi traders , here your have perhaps a signal at the next candle ... sdt is ok , but ema5 are in the hilo &amp; adx is going down , you must be flat !!! about diamani , after more check, i dont use diamani on 4 hours chart, i use it only on 15 30 or 1 h ... ps ; becarefull price are near 248.40 , a breakdown perhaps !!!

--- 帖子 #266 ---
hi , again ... look at the daily chart since the beginning of the year , today this the fourth red candle ! perhaps a presignal of a big bearish move ... for me long is not possible today because weekly and daily are bearish ... i m looking only for a short trade .... and i tell you my entry ...

--- 帖子 #267 ---
hi , Now that you are used to read adx &amp; sdt, it is possible to put them on the same window. and with this configuration , the level of standard deviation is 20... look the chart ....

--- 帖子 #273 ---

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Hello BZH, Great work tweaking this - and great trading! Could you just clarify a point here - you mentioned that the trend of both the daily and 4 hrs was the direction of your trade ie short. When I pulled up my daily chart with your new settings, the price was still firmly above the smma89, but was below on the 4 hour. Are you really still using that smma89 to determine trend, or something else (maybe the signal bar indicator on your chart?) mac18

--- 帖子 #295 ---
hi , the weekly &amp; daily trend up is not finish but we can ask question . To detremine the trend for the day i use ema 5 &amp; ema6 ans the candle... Look the week 25 02 2007 there was a big bearish candle like this week .. so we must be carefull. but if daily price go under smm89 i think the bullish trend long term will be finish ....

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Hi BZH, Do you use the default settings, or use some other settings for this indicator, such as for the Sto and MACD. If you do, the settings you use would be appreciated. mac18 Great trading

yes cliff , it's true , but if you are connected on the account You noticed that I changed the orders LONG to SHORT !!!! and 110pips in the pocket ...

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Hi BZH, Your system rocks - I'm still trying to pinpoint entries, and think you use a combination of 4hr 1hr and 30min charts. I see that if you are awaiting a trade on the 4 hr, you can switch down to lower time frames to see if it has 'fired'. My question is - do you use all the criteria for the lower timeframes, or just the correct 5/6 ema cross? I think that, if you are close to satisfying all the conditions on the 4 hr, all you need is the 5/6 cross. Or should I also make sure the hilo, adx and sd conditions are met? Next question - I think you have an ea (or someone does) out there, and would like to use it as an alert, not to place the trade. I did download one in the past, but it entered me into a trade, which I did not want. How do I just get the alerts and not activate the EA? Last question - how to connect to your demo a/c. I think I need to download the demo too? Thanks again, mac18

hi traders who are connected on my account were seen the break of the highest of the day ...

I have tried to seek for financial help to fund but did not work,so i have decided to give this system out to the world to use make money,if this is how i will help humanity,then i have contribution system introduction this trade strategy uses smooth ma, r.s.i and platform scale measurement.it trades maximum of 5-6 a month ,its same setting for 1 and 4 hr chart . Strategy entry parameters 1 10 smoothed ma 2 4 smoothed ma shift -1 3 rsi 14 mark 55 and 45 4 vertical scale line f-f ( friday to friday) working operation when the 4 ma crosses over 10 ma then wait for rsi to move either below 45 to 43 to the sell. Then sell;.at a valid scale when that also happens to the buy and rsi above 55 to 57 then buy at a valid scale valid scale the f-f( friday to friday ) scale is said to be valid when distance between the swing low of previous scale to the point where the ma made the cross over is up to 400 pips,or distance between the last swing low to point of ma cross over is up to 500 pips,then all parameters are valid to place a sell order.vice versa for a buy scale measurement. This strategy has what i call a neutralize order whereby a lost turns back ur money if the trade turns against u. If this happens u just leave the trade for a longer time max 10 days to trade itself in the main order setting tp=200 pip sl=450 pip neutralizer tp= 450 tp= 450 i have to simplify this by attaching a recent platform page,make the money and remember this fellow ,thank u peace.
