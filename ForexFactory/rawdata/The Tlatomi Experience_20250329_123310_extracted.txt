Hi tlatomi fans ! I think we had come to a point in this thread, where the evolution of Tlatomi has reached a quite good level regarding the technical points ( chart setup, entry, exit... ) So my proposal would be to open a separate Tlatomi Thread, in which all the participants can put in their actual trades for accelarating the success curve. [img]images/smilies/smile.gif[/img] Each posted item should contain : 1. Image of the chart with all the mentioned indicators 2. Entry marking 3. Exit marking 4. Short comment I hope that from now on it will be worth in words and bucks [img]images/smilies/smile.gif[/img] Happy Trading

Here is this morning's trades on M30 of GBP. http://www.pianopeople.net/images/Tlatomi.jpg

--- 帖子 #3 ---
hi tortoies.. is that green line &amp; red line are 5 ema &amp; 9 sma?

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Aren't those dots the SHI Silver Trend that repaints the past?

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Well I'm new to the Tatlomi experience and finally have it up and running. Will add my graphs and information as I go forward. Thanks for being a great group Rich

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Yes, repaint the past. In the thread you can find other indicator SHI silver that not repaints the past, buy i don't like it. In the system, Shi Silver is not very important. Coyan

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Yes, I put the MAs on to see the angle that they cross. You can get the new indicator that puts the arrows on at the forum.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Yes they do repaint. In fact make sure you refresh your chart before a trade. I just switch time frames back and forth. You want those dots to change. Once the FX Sniper starts the cross and the MAs start to cross the dot will stop moving. Wait for the right order of set up.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Tortoise, what MAs you using? Isn't the system supposed to be for h4? What is the settings for indicators for M30? Could you post an indicator what drows arrows please. Thank you

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Here are 2 indicators that may help. To address the MA angle issue. I cannot respond to technical questions as I am not technical. My first attached files! Here is an indicator that many might find useful. Use it as a filter with EMA and LSMA as the MA types. It might also work with other MA types&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; The following parameters can use the values shown.&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; MA_Type &lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; 0=SMA, 1=EMA, 2=SMMA, 3=LWMA, 4=LSMA&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; MA_AppliedPrice&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; 0=close&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; 1=open&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; 2=high&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; 3=low&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; 4=median(high+low)/2&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; 5=typical(high+low+close)/3&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt; 6=weighted(high+low+close+close)/4&lt;o &gt;&lt;/o &gt;

--- 帖子 #11 ---
The MA's are 5 EMA and 9 SMA This was contributed by OrangeRoshan. He has the file on The Tlatomi Method thread on page 11 #159. It's called 5&amp;9 MA Crossover Signal. Sorry, I am not knowledgeable enough here to know how to add a zip file. Just go there and you can download it. The system is for any time frame that works. H4 is very safe and I saw it mentioned that it was tried on daily and weekly. I went down as low as I thought I could go. M15 seems too low. I day trade and I am able to watch the markets when ever I want. So I wanted to see if this would work on a M30. So far so good. I am only in my 1st week of watching the results so I will keep you posted how it does on a M30

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Thank you, Tortoise. I've found an indicator. Will look at M30 now. H4 seem too slow for me.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Guys, the preferred picture size is 600 X 600. Let's stick to that. Yes, it helps when you print them, too! Oh, with that said, I like the bright background color on tortoise's chart. Good job! http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...ead.php?t=2671

--- 帖子 #14 ---
AGREED! This size makes it difficult to even read the posts. But what fantastically clear charts and annotation! Great tortoise! So much better than black backgrounds, for old eyes.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
This was the first time I posted a graphic. I didn't realize it would come out so large. Sorry. I tried putting a smaller chart on the web site I have it but it didn't change the size. Is there a moderator here that could help me reload that graphic? I will make it smaller if I can change my original post.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Don't worry, next page wil be ok. ... Oups...it's already next page

--- 帖子 #17 ---
You can see were I sold today but the market didn't move much. I put in to take a 20 pip profit and had to leave the house for 2 hours. When I got back I had missed my exit by 3 pips. The market went flat so I didn't take any mote signals. I like watching the 14 ATR. If it drops below 12 on the GBP I know that volatility is dropping and it is better not to trade. The market is going flat. Go catch up on your reading, or mow the lawn. http://pianopeople.net/images/Tlatomi3.jpg

--- 帖子 #18 ---
For some reason the chart size was corrected. Now that looks better. Just had to update from my web site.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
On this charts we can see that cross 5EMA-9SMA is later like ADX, it can also help us on 30min, its necessary test it,

--- 帖子 #20 ---
are you all using the default setting for FX Sniper and Shi_silvertrend ?

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Where do You put Your Stop-Loss? Thanks in advance! Dan.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
yes its the same, SL maybe previous higher or lower bj

--- 帖子 #23 ---
You are suppose to change the FX Sniper to: pq=4 pr=8 ps=5 trigger=4

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Stop Loss Good question, Dan. The answer is yes, maybe, I don't know. I have been testing the Tlatomi for a week now. I won't give you a pat answer that I have gotten out of the 100's of books I read or what I have seen on the Tlatomi forum already. 2:1 or 3:1. You have to test this system. I haven't played with MT4 enough yet to know how to stop it from doing this. I want to look at trades in the past data on the chart but when ever I scroll back as soon as new data comes in, the chart jumps to the beginning (end?) again. I was able to do historical testing over last weekend when the market was closed. The chart doesn't move then. Maybe there is a setting I can find to do some testing during the week. I'll look. In the mean time, my first idea is a cross in the MA in the other direction. Be careful with this because if the market goes flat briefly you can get a false cross. I don't like an arbitrary number like 30 pips. I like the market to tell me where to put the stop. If you are uncomfortable with the stop the market gives you then pass up the trade or wait to see if there is a place to get in at a smaller risk. For instance if I come to the conclusion that a good stop for this system is a close above the high I am selling or low I am buying then wait to see if the market goes against the system's signal a little and then get in. Your risk will be lower. Stops are important and I have to do more research to tell where to put them. Check back.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
There's a button on the menu bar that you can toggle on and off that will turn chart auto-scroll on and off so you can keep it from scrolling when a new tick comes in.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
I am confused which lines you are looking at on your ADX that are crossing before the MA. I feel the MA cross pretty quick. Sometimes in 2 or 3 bars. You don't want to jump the gun on a trade because the dot will keep repainting. I have only seen the dot repaint once after the MA cross, so far.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Thanks. I think. [img]images/icons/icon9.gif[/img] Now I have to work all day researching. Just kidding.

--- 帖子 #29 ---

Hi, I close all my trades now because i didn't pay my phone bill this month and the phone company will cut my line today until tomorrow. Total for yesterday and today : 543 PIPS (Tiga-Tlatomi trades only). JudeX.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Hi, Glad to see you again. I haven't notice many post on the other forum. Since you are the expert of Tlatomi I have a question for you. I notice that almost always when you get a signal in GBP there is also signals in EUR, CHF, JPY etc. This is mainly because all of these currencies are paired up with USD. There is a very strong correlation between these pairs so it makes sense that a signal in one will give a signal in the other. I was paper trading the M30 in 4 pairs. They almost all worked the same. The GBP and JPY are a little more volatile than the CHF and EUR. So here is my question: You put 0.2 lots on each trade. Why not go with just GBP or EUR and put 0.8 lots on one? I would say the GBP is the better choice. Here is my observation for over 1 1/2 years of watching the Forex. The GBP, EUR and CHF have very strong correlation. The JPY and CAD sometimes can correlate but they also can go off on their own. There is no testing here yet but my guess would be if you are trading a M30 to trade GBP in Europe session and USA session, 2:00 to 16:00 EST. Markets can go dead from 16:00 to 19:00 until the Asian market opens. So I would trade JPY in the evening. Just watch out for JPY reports. It can move JPY. Very few Europe reports move GBP. Only a handful UK reports move GBP which are usually at 4:30 EST. The GBP/JPY is it's own pair so that could be traded separately. Have you notice signals the same time with GBP/JPY and GBP/USD? One last questions. What is your spread on GBP/JPY? I see 10 pips with my broker but today I saw 6.5. High spreads may make a difference with using a M30 time frame to trade.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
thx for your quick answer, SMA is simple, yes? bj

--- 帖子 #35 ---
No, 5 is exponential. 9 is simple

--- 帖子 #36 ---
That's right. SMA = Simple moving average EMA : Exponential moving average JudeX.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
thx!!!!

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Is this right? 1) Blue Dot appears. 2) 5 EMA corsses the 9 SMA upward. 3) FX Sniper is in a buy sinal. ( Under - 200 % ) Could You trade if the FX Sniper is not under - 200 % ? 4) Take Profit when 5 EMA crosses the 9 SMA downward. Is it true that You have to refresh Your Charts every 30 min. So You would see if a blue/red dot appears? And is it true that those dots can move in other places, like if there is a high, and there is a blue dot on that high, and then, a higher high formed. Will the blue dot from the previous high move to the new higher high? Thanks. Dan.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hi tortoise,

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Hi Dan,

--- 帖子 #41 ---
You know, You give such great advice ! This is the best thread I have ever seen! Five Questions though. 1 ) How do You know when the dot will stop reapainting itself? Like, knowing when red dots will stop repainting themself in an uptrend. How do You know when it will be the last dot in the trend? 2 ) When do You usually take profit? 3 ) What is Paper Trading? 4 ) When You said that trading GBP/JPY on M30 for You is too risky, then, what timeframe do You trade on GBP/JPY? 5 ) What does Slippage mean? I attached a Chart of GBP/USD M30, is this right? Thanks soooo much. Dan.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Hope this helps !

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Trades in M30 / 16/08/2006 Short GBP/USD @ 1.8978 - T/P @ 1.8968 Long USD/CHF @ 1.2286 - T/P @ 1.2296 Short EUR/USD @ 1.2851 - T/P @ 1.2841 The three trades are now closed - each one with 10 pips profit. http://www.tlatomi.com/blog/images/ff/Triple1.gif

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Of Course it helped ! There is just a couple more things I just couldnt understand. 1 ) Do you ONLY trade 2 pairs ( GBP/USD, and GBP/JPY ) ? 2 ) Do You trade H4, or M30, or both? Or even H1? 3 ) Do You take profit when You see a double ( top, bottom ), or do You take Profit when, for example, Your Stop was 10 pips, are You going to take Profit at 10 pips, or 20 pips, or 30 pips ? Thanks sooooo much !!! Dan.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
JudeX.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
So You exit at 10 pips on M30. On H4, Do You take profit when You see any kind of Candle-stick Formation? Or only Double ( top, bottoms), and chart patterns? Thanks soooo much !!! Dan.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hi, Sorry my mistake - " when I see a double top, bottom etc...". By etc, I mean any kind of formations, tops or patterns. JudeX.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
It happens......So, I think I know everything about this method. Trading on 30M 1 ) Blue Dot appears 2 ) FX Signal in Buy mode 3 ) 5 EMA crosses 9 SMA upward 4 ) Stop : 30 pips away from entry 5 ) Limit : + 10 pips Trading on 4H 1 ) Blue Dot appears 2 ) FX Signal in Buy mode. 3 ) 5 EMA crosses 9 SMA upward 4 ) Stop : 30 pips away from entry 5 ) Limit : Double Top or Bullish Formation Limit. ( Whichever is earlier ). If everything is right here, I will test this method on 4H and 30M about 30 times, trading on GBP/USD, GBP/JPY, and USD/JPY. Thanks for all the GREAT advice !!! Dan.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Hey, do You want to post eachother trades that we are about to do? Like, for example, the MA's are about to cross ( about 30 min. left ). How long have You been trading, and struggling with the market? Do You trade any other markets other than Forex ? Could threads ever expire ? Thanks, Dan.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Hi, Just a precision. Personaly i think that 30 pips in 4H is not enough. In general, i put my stops at the lower or higher of the previous bar before the entry.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
There, I think I know everything there is to this method, and I am looking forward into testing it tomorrow on 30M and 4H on GBP/USD, USD/JPY, and GBP/JPY.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
As you mention in your post above this you take a profit of 10 pips on a M30 chart. I do this too. I will post a spreadsheet in a few days once the work is done that taking a profit on a 4H chart is also better. At first you see very larger moves can happen and taking a profit too soon makes you feel like you missed out. But in the long run you make out better. I only have 20 trades so far in the GBP but right now 80 pips gives the best profit for all trades. I know this is curve fitting to an extent but I will document it and post the file soon.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Sorry I forgot to ask about "Tiga". What does that mean? Has the Tlatomi been modified besides the 5 and 9 MA?

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Hi,

--- 帖子 #55 ---
When You will be away on Thursday, and Tuesday, I will post the trades that happend on the currencies : GBP/USD, EUR/USD, and GBP/JPY, ok ? Thanks, Dan.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi tortoise, "TIGA ABDUL (t-ga up-dol) TIGA means 3. The reason is because im using a third MA..." You can go to the post #144 of OrangeRoshan for the rest of the explanation and post #158 for the pdf of Tiga ABdul - Tlatomi method I haven't done any modifications beside the MA (a contribution from OrangeRoshan - thanks again). I only add the Ma_crossover indicator to see more easily the cross. Bye

--- 帖子 #57 ---
I will be away from tomorrow at 12 h am to tuesday morning. Thanks - Be my guest !

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Everybody !! Get ready to go long on USD/JPY. Blue Dot on 30M. FX Sniper in Buy mode, and 5 EMA is about to cross 9 SMA upward. Hurry !!!!!!! You have about 18 minutes left !!!! On USD/JPY Attached Chart.......

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Everybody !! Get ready to go short on GBP/USD. Red Dot on 30M. FX Sniper in Sell mode, and 5 EMA is crossing the 9 SMA downward.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
That is Impressive. One of my Trading team who have been trading well over 20yrs saw this post. He was speechless for about 30seconds, turned to me and said, "Could I take a look at the PDF you send me last week?" These guys made pips, but consecutive wins like that is not normal. But I guess it is with 3A Tilatomi.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Hey... Where do You put Your Limit on H4?

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Hi, It's with 3A Tlatomi and for that, i really thank you and everyone on the forum who contribute to this thread Don't worry, it's exceptional for me too in one day. In my trading plan, i set a monthly goal of 500 pips so making that in one day = i'm living a dream ! Thanks again !

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Relax! The Japs are still having their sushi. Lets see after the japanese finish their lunch break.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
What do You mean when you say after the japanese finish thier lunch break? Does it mean that we should wait after JPY opens. Please tell me when YOU exit?

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Until the next dot appear! or 10PIPS!. It also depends on when my wife give me another signal!

--- 帖子 #66 ---
ok. Thanks !!!

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Do you wait until the next dot appears on 30M too? Or just 4H. If just 4H, then when do You exit on M30?

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Look at the JPY time, its lunch break!

--- 帖子 #69 ---
I dont trade on M30 unless the 3line break system on the M1 confirms it. My advice trading on the M30 is to exit 10pips because trend can change suddenly, unless the 1hr &amp; 4hr shows solid similar trend. Whenthe M60 &amp; M240 show the same trend, then switch to M60 and follow M60's dot as your exit point. Or move your SL every 10pips. Hope that helps!

--- 帖子 #70 ---
With all of these advices. And You guys helpin me out. I feel sooo good. Like, like, i'm about to cry. I have been struggling with forex for 2 years.

When I check the method in the history, how will I know if the market had a red/blue dot there and there, because, You said that dots repaint themself.

I dont have that kind of money that I can afford. I am in huge financial problems, $ 15, 000. Can You please answer my other questions?

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Dan... Did you refresh your SilverTrend? I dont have a blue dot to go long. I believe you can modify the code so you don't have to refresh your chart, as the indicator won't repaint itself. mrLogik.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
You can't know that - that's why backtesting with this method is not very reliable.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Use the SHI Indicator! regarding the 3line break system, Its an old system use by many but im nto ready to explain it here now because 3AT is already sufficient enough. Regarding moving your stop loss to every 5-10pips (long): Say you profit is 10pips (Price 1.8810), then adjust your Sl to 5pips (price 1.8805) When it moves to 15pips (Price 1.8815), adjust Sl to 1.8810 and so on. This way, when the trend changes, loss is almost impossible. Dont cry everytime when it exited your trade when the trend changes because your sl is too close. The future is unknown, its better to keep +ve pips than keeping -ve pips.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Press The periodically betwen the different time frame to get the latest dot repainted. Its not the primary signal, so it doesnt matter when it repainted itself.

When I plot the NonLagMa it is only yellow. I have read previous posting about this. I tried the template that gave me no NonLagMa. I tried the different setting listed and line was straight and blue. Ant idea how to ifc this? Doc

--- 帖子 #85 ---
The Tlatomi now uses a 5EMA and 9SMA as the signal and replaces the NonLagMA. You can find the file at #159 The NonLagMA are as follows if you still want to see it work. Price=0 Length=9 Displace=0 Filter=20 Color=1 ColorBarBack=0 Deviation=0.0

--- 帖子 #86 ---
One more thought why you line was straight and blue. What time frame are you at? Higher time frames work better. Don't go below M30

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Short @ 1.8971 - T/P @ 1.8961 = +10 PIPS If you followed the advice of OrangeRoshan about the USD/JPY, you didn't loose any money. In case you traded anyway, you loose more/less 10 pips.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
When the MA's cross, do You wait for the close of the bar?

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Dan want to everybody to sell. Here is what happened. This method is not fool proof. M30 is a riskier time frame. Not all trades win. http://www.pianopeople.net/images/GBPM30.jpg http://www.pianopeople.net/images/GBPM31.jpg

Trade 01 :

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Good Dan. I recommended watching the ATR in another post and did not take my own advise. The market whipped me tonight. It is about 3:00 a.m. EST http://www.pianopeople.net/images/GBPM31a.jpg

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Wasn't trading there. ATR was under 12 %.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Do You have any progress of all these weeks? I mean, a 30 pips Stop and 10 Pip limit? Do YOU wait for a close after the cross of the MA's ?

--- 帖子 #94 ---
I will be looking at the M30 trade more in the next few days. It has been less than a week since I started following this system. I have learn to wait for the up or down arrow of the MA to be painted before you enter and then get in on the open of teh next bar. I have jumped too soon and the market came all the way back and the MA never crossed. Wait. Like you said, watch out for too small of a trading range. ATR helps. I set reference line at .0012 on the GBP. Eur=.0010 JPY=.09 CHF=.0008 AUD=.0008 CAD=.0008 What do you think of these numbers as not trading if ATR is below? On the other forum "Tlatomii Method" there is a good post about using Weekly and Monthly Pivots. The indicators are there for downloading. Looks like another great idea.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Hi All Right now possible short on EURJPY , signals seems to be all confirmed (red dot painted, fx cci more than 200 with cross, 5-9cross should be done on next bar) I will wait until next bar will start then i enter with a short trade.

FYI -ATR is not a percentage but is mesurared in pips. FYI for those who are interested. TR or true range is essentially the range of the bar (High - Low) with the execption that if the close of the previous bar is outside the range of the current bar it the becomes the extreme of the range (i.e. if previous bar close is higher than the high, then True Range = Previous close - Low) Average True Range is the moving average of this TR value.

I think a good stop would be above or below the weekly or monthly pivots depending on whether you are going long or short.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Yes MissForex that could be a good idea, actually i'd put my stoploss on higher value looking 3-4 bar before my entry point. I guess it should be a quite good resistance level

The tlatomi method can be combined on the same chart with sidius method ? ... two very good methods in one ...

Im trading off the 1H and the EUR/JPY FX Sniper has given a good buy signal. So I am LONG 148.53, SL 1.4823, TP await exit signal or 149.03 Id also like to say that having a 3:1 Risk:Reward is a surefire way NOT to win in the long run.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Hey tortoise, I know that you dont' have to view the sniper FX CCI below the -200 cross to go long, but going long when the cross is close to 0... Isn't that a little dangerous? I have found statistically speaking that for a long you want at least &lt; -75, at least. Yes, there are good trades when it crosses above that point, but the probability is much less. Let the market come to you and you'll do better (in my opinion. What do you think? mrLogik

--- 帖子 #105 ---
When I start putting real money down I will wait for better trades. What I didn't like about that trade was the market going flat. Dan7974 made a good point about ATR being under 12. I have put ATR on my charts and that is another indicator to watch. However, it may be that if the Sniper FX CCI is below -200 or even -75 the ATR will be above 12. There are no losers, only lessons to help you win.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Can you please better explain it? long - weekly pivots stop short- monthly- stop- ? for inst. today on erujpn- short et 148,44- SL monthly pivots 149,49??- ist correct? thx

--- 帖子 #107 ---
After posting may last post, I looked at some charts. The Sniper FX CCi can get over 200 or under -200 with a low ATR. Also, this criteria of ATR above 12 on the GBP only would apply to a M30 chart.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
GBP/JPY 30 min chart....This is just an example. Today at 1300 (Eastern Interbank FX time) we had a red dot then at 1500, we had the arrow and the Sniper cross.All three conditions were met to enter the trade. I would not enter the trade until the price penetrated the monthly pivot at 218.64. I would set the stop at 219.06(daily pivot since it is the closest pivot to my entry point but far enough away to not get stopped out so soon on a potentially good trade) I would begin to scale out when the pair began to stall at the weekly pivot of 218.48. I should mention that it wouldnt be a good idea to trade the GBP/JPY from the 30 min charts. I was just using it as an example because of the two secondary and the primary signals all in line. MissForex

What is E-12 ?

--- 帖子 #110 ---
I will be checking this method today! A lot !

--- 帖子 #111 ---
How did you filter out the other times there were dots and crosses? I think I see three of them. It seems like you would get whipsawed quite a bit with this method.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
A quick post before i leave - I hope you take the trades Short GBP/USD @ 1.8944 - Initial S/L @ 1.9008 (Breakeven now)- T/P @ 1.8855 Short AUD/USD @ 0.7638 - Initial S/L @ 0.7677 (Breakeven now)- T/P @ 0.7584 I have to go now - i'm closing both trade for security GBP/USD : 0.2 Lots @ +17 PIPS AUD/USD : 0.2 Lots @ +49 PIPS

Too bad you had to go Judex. I entered on 4H Short GBP/USD @ 1.8902. Still in trade and current price is 1.8827. I was trading the M30 and watching 4H because we were close to a trade. M30 was short so I jump on the 4H. 5/9 should cross on this current bar. Time now is 1400 EST. So anybody have any ideas how to get out? I have 70 pips so far. Broke daily support at 1.8844. Weekly pivots at 1.8813 and 1.8701

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Hello Tortoise, I'm looking at the 4H GBPUSD chart right now and don't see an entry arrow. Am I wrong? best, forexpips

--- 帖子 #115 ---
REVERSE NOW!

--- 帖子 #116 ---
I see a red sell bar, the FX Trigger is short, with great angle, and the MA's are crossed over. Is this not a classic short signal? regards, forexpips

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Usually we wait for the 5/9 to cross but today the GBP, EUR &amp; JPY has done their range. However this is an exception and where Price Analysis come to play, Very high percentage they will retrace. Its 4am here, im off to sleep in 1hr. Happy Trading!

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Hi Roshan (or anyone else), Please clarify for me the TIGA - TLATOMI setup. TIGA means 3, referring to the Moving Averages, but in all of the posts I have seen, I only the 5 and 9 MA's being used. What is the THIRD MA used? Thanks forexpips

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Ihave different levels of pivot see pictures? whats problem? bj

--- 帖子 #120 ---
I am not sure why your chart is different. Check or setting or refesh chart by switching back and forth between time frames. I was trading a M30 on EUR which was near the weekly pivot of 1.2866. Aug.16 this was resistence and today it was support. When EUR started breaking this support I saw the 5/9 on GBP 4H starting to cross. Market was dropping and I am a ready,fire, aim person so I jumped in. Also I saw GBP moving away from the weekly pivot of 1.8978 and S1 was at 1.8813, so there was lots of room to sell at 1.8902. I at least had a M30 going for me in GBP also so I didn't feel I was breaking all the rules. It turn into a great trade and gave me 60 pips. http://www.pianopeople.net/images/GBP4H.jpg

--- 帖子 #121 ---
No, not really.....I do lose, yes, that's true. Listen to these wise words that I am about to tell You....An old guy told me this....He is trading for already almost 35 years ! " Let the Stop be really small compared to the Limit ". For example : Stop = 20 Pips. Limit = 200 Pips When this happens, You will be a rich man. Thanks, Dan.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
This was a whipsaw. Sorry...not yet....the market almost closed Your postion. There was 1 pips left to go !!! Attached a chart .

Hey..

Tlatomi Method thread post # 48. I'm sure you read it? Right? Jim

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Hey Dan, My chart is different from yours. How do I post it here without attaching it so that I can show you what I mean. forexpips

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Use the TEXT button, and save it, then just attach it. Thanks, Dan.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
I didn't understand, but here's the attached picture. I have already entered the trade. Do you still not have an entry signal? That is very odd isn't it? best, forexpips

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Why have You enterd the trade ? You have to wait for the close of the MA cross. ( it has not closed yet ). it will in about 30 minutes. Oh..and sorry..I didn't get what You meant....I do now..to attach a picture right here, You have to save the Chart Picture on the file called " Windows picture and fax viewer ". How long have you been trading? How do you trade the tiga-tlatomi method with the MACD? Thanks, Dan.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Different brokers have different starting time, that's why. Matsu

--- 帖子 #132 ---
On my tradestation (IBFX) on the 4H USDJPY the MA crossover candle has ALREADY closed. I use the MACD to confirm the movement of the MA's and the CCI trigger. I have been using this method for less than 24 hours so I'm just tweaking it and still really trying to understand it and see if it is successful for me or not. best, forexpips

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Thanks, Dan.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
To be honest, i'm not sure how the macd will help, if at all, but i think it may be useful in exiting longer term trades. As I say, i'm very very new to this method, so I'm really just testing it today for the first time. forexpips

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Oh... Well thanks, Dan.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
On the USDJPY 4H I now have a red dot. Does that mean that my long trade is over? Please help. This can't be right. forexpips

--- 帖子 #137 ---
If I were to buy USD/JPY, I would exit now. Red dot on 4H. And FX Sniper is in sell signal.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Maybe i'm applying this method incorrectly, but this trade was a joke. The most i was up is about 4 pips, right now i'm down about 7, and the entry arrow was followed by a red dot to exit!!! What was the point of that? Please help me understand. Also, for anyone trading this method live, or in a realtime demo (not back/forward testing), what is the success ratio? best, forexpips

--- 帖子 #139 ---
When a red dot appeared, You shold have closed position. An example of the LIVE trading. I will show You an example of my trading method in a few moments...

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Like this... Stop is 30 pips from entry, Limit is + 10 Pips. I win more than 90 % of the time.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
dan so all your entries are 30 min based, do u wait for bar close, or take the entry as soon as u have a signal. Also do you mind posting your template for mt4. thanks

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Hey Dan, Great work and I think you are doing a nice job. BTW, there seems to be so much interest in this method and so many people would want to be trading this at the same time. Just a suggestion, would anyone be willing to join up in a seperate trading room on Paltalk?? It would be excellent means to get everyone in the same room trading togather. Also all the confusion can be cleared. And its free. I know that many of the threads which have a large following already have their own dedicated Paltalk rooms. We could trade this real time instead of posting and waiting for a reply. Let me know what you guys think. Personally I think its a great idea. If there is one already, please let me know, I am not aware of it yet. Happy pipping

--- 帖子 #143 ---
I wait for the close.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Why go to a new thread when we can stay here?

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Thread?????? I think I was talking about live chat on Paltalk!!

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Oh.....sorry...my mistake.. I dont know..lets wait what the other guys think about this...

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Check this out..!!!! Stop = 1.8878 Entry = 1.8848 Limit = 1.8838 1 ) Red Dot 2 ) MA Cross 3 ) FX Sniper is in Sell mode.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
I exited with + 10 pips under 30 Minutes !!!

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Check this out...!!! 16 Minutes left !!! Right now is 3:17 AM EST

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Check this out...!!!

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Dan, Great job again, I took that trade too, but for 24pips. Only trading the gbp presently. How many pairs do you trade ??

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Paltalk has a gazillion spybot. I wouldnt recommend it.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Orange, I have been using Paltalk for last 6months. Not had a problem ever till now. Naturally its advisable not to download anything there or from any chat without scanning for malware or spyware. But it does have a seperate Daytraders section and you will see many familiar faces from these forums there. Would love to have you there but I can understand your concerns. But I am sure that many guys here will vouch for paltalk. I find it more better than msn or yahoo. Anyway, looking for some more followup, lets see how it goes. If more people are interested, we could start Monday. Looking forward for comments Cheers

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Why 24 pips ? I trade the following : GBP/JPY GBP/USD USD/JPY

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Hi Dan, Would you mind posting the pair you're trading with the chart you're posting? Chart seems too small to see the details...Hope I'm not asking too much...Thanks!

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Hi Dan..great stuff that you are trading and Im glad its going well. The method is great and Im having good success trading it, however a 3:1 Risk Reward is not good imho. It relies too much on you havng a large Win: Loss ratio. Personally, I trade a 1:3 R:R as this means that I can afford to be wrong 3 out of 4 trades and still be no worse than break even. Given that even if I traded randomly, I'd have a 50% chance of making pips, statistically Im pretty much guaranteed at least a 25% return. Knowing that after a winning trade, I can afford to get the next 3 wrong and still be at breakeven leads to stress free trading! Not a criticism of your work, just my 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
hi all, just wanted to say thx to tortoise. this system helped me to improve my system on 30mins and 4 hrs

--- 帖子 #158 ---
you combine dynamit and tlatomi? how? can you describe it? or irina and tlatomi? you are very exper. trader, give us please your knowledges thx bj

--- 帖子 #159 ---
I am trying to use the tlatomi with MetaQuote version 4 with interbankfx I place the indicators and the the Silvertrendsig does not seem to up date unless I close the program and then opening it back up. AN idea what is happening? Thanks Doc

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Hi Dan OrangeRoshan and all others ! First of all I'm overwhelmed by the reaction after opening this thread This gives me a great satisfaction, that FF is absolut the best in town Dan, it's impressive to read your statement regarding your success ratio Which pairs do you prefer to trade ? In what time frames are you trading ? Volatility plays a big role in trading and therefore it would be easier only to trade the ones with the highest volatility. I mean you can install several monitors to watch 6 or more monkeys simultaneously to grab a maximum of profit per day. It's a question to all of you : Is it an advantage to trade a whole bunch of monkeys simultaneously or is it more effective to concentrate on max. 3 pairs with the highest volatility ? What is your opinion ? Best wishes and carry on boys and girls Bernhard

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Well, this strategy is awesome if you are patient and only trade the good signals. I have been using it on 6 pairs (not g/j because yen pairs are pathetic and cause for loss). I made 200% in the last 2 days. After practicing for a week, and found that not 1 trade has lost. I decided to use my leverage and there you go. 4 trades 200% 2 days. Aud/usd 113 pips. eur/usd 50 pips u/chf 43 pips eur/chf 20 pips

--- 帖子 #162 ---
You need to refesh your chart. You can do it by change the TF and back to the original TF, then it will update the dot.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
avici4x, are you serious this indicator does not up date in real time. I am surprised. I have read so much about how great this system is Am I missing some thing Doesn't every one use the Dot to trade? How can you trade with this it is does not up date in real time? What am I missing? Doc

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Hi, Congrats on the great results. What timeframes were your trades made in? Thanks, forexpips

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Were you trading the 4 hour charts?

--- 帖子 #166 ---
It only works on 4h. I did some testing on 30m and it was trash. Too annoying. 4hour signals are pretty much 100% if you know how to identify when to get out. I held alot of them to -15 pips before i got the profit. Was very close to margin call.. Hoorah for leverage

--- 帖子 #167 ---
I was playing around with this last night on the 4 hour charts and it seemed pretty reliable. I'll have to do some demo testing next week. I also thought the 30 minute would have more problems than the 4 hour.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
to brain jt. still fixing it brain, as soon will be ready i will post it. but it's for the dynamite 30mins i like that fx sniper and the shi silver trend

--- 帖子 #169 ---
found also that the best signals are on the 4 hrs chart i use only the cross of 5wma, 9 sma shi silver fx sniper

--- 帖子 #170 ---
IMHO, the fact that the SilverTrend signal repaints should not preclude someone writing an EA to backtest this puppy - after all, you would have traded on the first signal that appeared regardless of what happened a bar or two later. I'm not very experienced with EAs (only written indicators thus far) but perhaps I'll give it a try after I spend some time doing real-time testing.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Sorry to imform you but you are talking hypothetical. I have read that theory on many trading manuals and books. It sounds great, makes sense, even logical but it is not real life. Show me a system that you know what your profit is going to be each time. The market gives you what you get. That's it. I don't know what I will make with each trade. Yes I am taking 10 pips on a M30 but on a H4 I let the market tell me what I should be happy with. And really the same applies to stops. Picking an arbitrary pip amount for a stop loss is a newbie's mind set. The market has to tell you went to get out. See you in the real trading world.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
100:1 is a two edge sword. My account has gone down to 0 several times. It is finally on a big upswing and I have added more funds. I am with a broker now that limits me to 50:1 That is fine because I don't push my account to the limit. You don't have to double your money every month to get rich. I will start trading Tlatomi next week with real money. I will stay under 10% of my avaiable funds.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
You can trade down to the M30. The Tlatomi works on all time frames, not just H4. It works on H1, D1 too. The orginal person that posted this method was using a H4, so every one started on that. Since then, the system has improved, 5/9 MA and Pivots. I use to trade a scalping method that worked well only under right market conditions. It was a little hard to tell when conditions were right. You have to be an experienced trade. Going down to the M30 is the same thing. Market conditions have to be right. You have to be experienced at seeing what the market is doing. I have added ATR to my M30 and maket sure that it is over 12 on the GBP before I trade. Use Pivots!!! Also trading in good trading sessions helps, i.e. US morning. Trading is not for mind numb robots. Develop your trading skills.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
I am surprised. I have read so much about how great this system is The Silver Trend sig, the dots dont update in real time so how do you use the system to trade? What am I missing? Doc&lt;!-- / message --&gt;

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Thanks for writing. I trade only GBP/USD, GBP/JPY, and USD/JPY. 30M, and 4H. Mostly 4H because of Volitility. Thanks, Dan.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
I think the thing about the indicator is that it just may not update by itself right away. Sometimes, you see a dot only after changing the TF to update. It may bother you but you may want to consider the following: It is not the only signal to get in a trade - if other indicators tell you it's time pull the trigger and this one has not, you know what to do...just change the TF and update. I may be wrong but by the time other indicators tell you to pull the trigger, it should usually have updated already. Before getting in a trade, you should check the charts in other TF to see and interpret what is going on in detail - thereby changing TF. I think these are the reasons why other people are not complaining about the indicator. I hope that helps...

--- 帖子 #177 ---
I just discovered something tonight. I was helping my brother learn the system. I have MT4 from Interbankfx. You have to renew your demo every 30 days. I found StrategyBuilderFX that gives you a demo that doesn't expire. . So I told my brother to download that one. As we were talking we realized the data feeds are different and you get the dot and arrows sometimes on a different bar. This has already happened in this forum where one person made a trade and another person is scratching their head saying "I don't see the arrow yet." Why don't we list where we can get MT4 other than the two I mentioned above.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Just in case anyone doesn't know this, the data you are looking at is not the real Forex market. Brokers make it up. That is why it is free. Depending on where they are from, they will use an average of quotes they get from banks in their area. Also they will spike the market on a news report or if they see a lot of orders, (stops or limits) at a certain price. They can do this because almost all brokers have dealing desk. They want your money. Yesterday I was watching three data sources when I was in a trade The Philadelphia Fed Index report came out and the market from eSignal and my broker spiked down 15 pips instantly and came back up in 1 minute. MT4 hardly move 4 pips and the other charts came right back. I had a limit order in to get out of a short position and was filled to my surprise because my eye was on MT4 at the time. Overall I do not feel different data sources will affect this method, especially on a H4 TF. Just be aware when we are talking to each other we may be on different data sources.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
I Quit forex starting now. No point of it! Just wated my time! 4 years of nothing ! Loss of money ! Dont want to lose anymore trading LIVE.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Dan, Be patient relex your mind take a rest for couple of week or month. Investigate why you loss is it because of alot of method? Professional trader only stick to one method! The simple the method is the best! REMEMBER THIS, EVERY TRADER SHOULD : 1. PATIENT 2. FOCUS 3. DESCIPLINE 4. CONFIDENT "EMOTIONLESS KEY OF SUCCESS"

--- 帖子 #181 ---
I dont have success. 30 pips stop and 10 pips limit? Have You traded this method LIVE? Do You have success? Thank You, Dan.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Dan, Go back to the H4 time frame and stay there until your account gets back up. Also, I would start to educate yourself on more trading skills and money management. I haven't looked around this forum enough yet but I am sure there are good discussions on money mangement. I have mentioned before that high leverage is a two edge sword. Why do you think brokers will give you as high as 400:1 leverage. They know that will take away your money. I have been trading over 25 years but only found the Forex 1 1/2 years ago. I have never been in a trading situation where the broker wanted you to lose your money. If you don't know this you better get wise. Most brokers are "bucket shops". They have dealing desk and it is to their advantage that you lose your money. It is not just the spread, "commission", that they are after. There is a lot of money to be made trading. Do you think it is as easy as following the little bouncing dot. If it is, then every one would be rich. Market forces are at play here and if you are going to be successful at trading the forex your better get good. You are competing against the world, and now your broker.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Hey tortoise I've been trading 11 years so I'd like to think Im in the real world! As I said in the post, it wasn't a criticism, but more my observation so Im not sure the rudeness was warranted. If a 3:1 Risk Reward works for you then great, Im happy. Oh, and by the way..if you study the price action on the pairs you'll know where to place stops and there's nothing arbitary (or newbie) about it. Good trading to you mon ami.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Tortoise, do you want to say that brokers always play against us and it's virtualy impossible to make money on Forex because they'll do everything to make us lose? Sounds scary... Do we learning and trying for nothing? Also you mentioned that what brokers feed us is not real Forex data. What about live accounts? Hope it's not that bad...

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Actually it's exactly the opposite. The 4hr bars/candles may be completely different because different MT4 brokers use different times for their data feed. Some of them are on EDT, others use GMT, others GMT+1, or GMT+2 and so on. As a result on a 4hr system you get different signals because those bars start and end at a different time. For instance one chart has the 4hr bar from 8 AM to noon GMT, while another one has it from 9 AM to 1 PM GMT. Same thing with dailies. Only the smaller time frames are similar (there can be a small difference of course, but only a few pips).

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Sorry you took this as rudeness. It was not. Reading emails and post like this does not allow you to hear the persons voice inflections and expressions on their face, so my apologies if you felt I was rude. First I agree with your point where to place a stop. "...if you study the price action on the pairs you'll know where to place stops..." Okay we agree that market tells you so you may not be able to make the trade if that stop is too large or just trade less of a positon. So my point here is that people on this method are looking for how much to risk. That is an individual decision. If market sets the stops then just adjust the size of your trade, not the number of pips. Second part of the ratio is the profit. Like I said in my post, most times the market gives me what I get and I am happy with that. Do you set a limit on how much you will make? There are ways to project expected market movements, like Fib nos. and pivots. I find don't find it necessary to do the math. I have just learn to know when I am wrong and get out. Here is my clue, I'm losing money!!!

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Most people lose there money when trading. I have heard as high as 90%. That doesn't scare me because there are plenty of other occupations that the odds of being successful are just as low. As I am typing this post there is an ad on the left side of my browser of a broker that says, "No Dealing Desk". Do you know what that means? If not, go read about Forex brokers.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Good point on the H4 time frame. I didn't thiink of that. I just saw the bars looked different and the dot was at a different place on two different MT4 charts from different sources. However I will say that I have had 3 different chart programs up at the same time. All have different data sources and all look different. It is more that a few pips but I will not begrudge the point. Just wanted to point out to the forum that if one person sees a trade signal on one bar and the other person doesn't then check your source of data.

No Dan my position is still in place and stop loss was not hit, i think i will left trade opened until a new cross 5-9 will pop up. Actually i'm -16 pips float.

Can anyone tell me how to put NonLagMaV4,shi_silvertrendsig, and fx sniper ergodiccci trigger indicators on the Metatrader 4 platform. Please keep in mind that I'm not real computer savey. Thank you.

Most of your beginning questions on how to trade this system are already answered in this forum. I will direct you to the posts to get your answer. For this question Read #92 Page 7 in the Tlatomi Method

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Hey tortoise..as you said..posting words makes the inflections difficult to read, so lets just put it down to misunderstanding. I agree with everything you said, however my original point was that Dan was taking his profit after 10 pips and not allowing them to run. He was also risking 3x more than his TP and hence putting pressure on himself by needing to have a high win ratio. It goes without saying that if he had 2 losers in a row, he'd have to have 6 straight winners just to break even..a recipe for blowing out an account! I mainly trade Cable and the 100+ daily range (which occurs over 75% of the time) provides for 1:2 or 1:3 Risk:Reward Trades. when I place a trade, Im looking at where I will put my stop (beyond the lows of the previous bars, pivots, Fibs, Vegas etc) and where I am likely to start to scale out (again, Fibs, pivots, Donchian cHannels, MTF or whatever). I then do a quick R:R calculation to see if there's at least a probability of 1:2 trade. If not, I'll stand aside and wait for what I believe will be a more profitable trade. So, my original point was that rather than Dan taking 10 pips..he should scale out his trades use Fibs, PP etc in order to maximise his winners.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
This system has had good contributions to the method. Anyone can see many profitable trades on the charts. Your point here is well taken. A good system will not be profitable unless there is a good plan for money management. What are your thoughts on size of trade with relation to your account size? I have read people on this forum putting their max lots on there trades. This is also a recipe for blowing out an account.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
ok... can anyone here change the code in the fx sniper to do this: when the indictor lines slope changes to &lt; (a certain amount) color the lines a different color. i.e. when the blue line flattens out before heading and crossing over the signal line, color it a different color. kinda of like a neutral zone. i think this would help to identify tops and bottoms.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
I may be speaking in ignorance, but I am sure the FX_Sniper came from a list of indicators for MT4. There is a zip file your can download with about 450 of these custom indicators. Not sure if anyone here does that kind of code writing except for modifying the properties. Look at Post #2 . The cross is pretty clear and you are really waiting for the MA cross with the arrow to initiate the trade. I use the CCI to show a better set up, i.e above 200 or below -200. Of course I want to see a cross after the dot and before or on the MA cross.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Do YOU take profit at 10 pips for this method on M30? Or do You take more? Thanks !!! Thank You, Dan.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Dan, Read what Zuke says iin Post #194. Unless you get very skillful at reading market conditions and knowing when is a good time to trade the M30 I would stay away from M30 time frame. Your timing has to be perfect to limit your risk to what you are making. I would trade higher time frames. Even H1 is better. Use other analysis to select the good trades and let questionable ones go.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Yes....but....when do YOU ( personally ) take profit on M30, H1, and H4? Thanks soo much !!! ~Thank You~ ~Dan~

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Why did it happen? News announcements? I just feel soo bad for not getting that kind of money. I bet a lot of people knew that was going to happen. Its just so crazy !!!

--- 帖子 #202 ---
my chart did not show that spike.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Thats wierd.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
In theory it should be 1%, but a lot of people's accounts are not big enough to make this feasible. As this system has such a high win rate, I risk no more than 3% of my account per trade. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Hi Dan, I have to agree with tortoise, trading off the 30min is high risk stuff on Cable, due to the dreaded whipsaw. Why not trade off the hourly? Less whips, but more frequent signals than the 4H. If you really do feel that the 30 min is for you, I would advise you not taking a trade until both secondary and primary positions are in place. As for taking profit, the point that Tortoise was very correctly making is that this should not be an arbitary 2x times stop or 60 pips or whatever. You should let the market TELL you when to get out. As a guide: 1. Trade 3 lots (irrespective of size) 2. Place your stop beneath the recent lows (say the last 4 bars on the 30 min) or major support areas. You should also ensure that you are below importnat pivot levels if applicable. 3. Start to scale out (1 lot) at a level you are comfortable, in your case this is 10 pips, personally I would make this at first Fib line for the 30 min (21). 4. Scale out the next lot at the next Fib line or pivot point (for the 30 min this would be 34) 5. When you do (4) move your stop to break even and relax...this is now a free trade! 6. Let the final lot run until you get a signal to close (CCI Sniper cross or MA Cross) Just my ideas and not a recommendation of course. Happy pippin!

--- 帖子 #206 ---
After using this methode for 3 days in demo account in TF M30. I think it is better that we take the same signal as provide by the TF H4. Suppose that the TF H4 is down trend then we trade when in M30 also shown the down trend. Regards, Avici

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Very good point Avici. Its never good to trade against the major trend unless one is "scalping"

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Hi, Since we are supposed to be taking trades on the close of a bar I wandering if there is a way to have some display on a chart of the number minutes left to a bars completion. I hope someone can also explain to me why on my H4 chart it displays the latest bars completion time as 12:00 when it is now 15:46? Previous 2 bars time was 4:00 &amp; 0:00 Thanks Naj

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Here's an indicator that shows time left in current bar. Wackena

--- 帖子 #210 ---
I'm a novice coder and I have put together an EA based the tiatomi method. I''m not sure how well it perform over time, but it did place the first order in the correct entry point. I used 2 SMA lines instead of the NonLagMA_v4 indicator. I could not get a workable code signal from this indicator. Attached is Bogie_tiatomi_v1.0 EA and SHI_SilverTrendSIG red/blue dot indicator. Also attach to chart two SMA indicators. Set 1 for red and period=5 and one for white and period=9. I use white, instead of blue, for 9 SMA line as for me it is easier to see on black background chart. H4 chart - right now only tested on gbp/usd. Can not backtest as timer for when Bar closes only works when EA is attached to chart. Order sequence Buy 1. SHI_SilverTrendSig indicator red dot appears. 2. Then after 1, EA waits until MA 5 cross above MA 9 3. Then after 1 &amp; 2, EA waits until current Bar closes. Close Buy when red dot is replaced by next blue dot. Sell 1. SHI_SilverTrendSig indicator blue dot appears. 2. Then after 1, EA waits until MA 5 cross below MA 9 3. Then after 1 &amp; 2, EA waits until current Bar closes. Close Sell when blue dot is replaced by next red dot. I may add when MA crosses back as part of close code. Dot color change or MA reverse cross. Either one would close order. But I think the dot color change always come first. The UD = 1 is for red dot and UD = -1 is for blue dot. I may take this out as you can see when the red or blue dot appears. Wackena

This method has not proven itself over time yet and personally I think it is too soon to make a judgement on which is better, taking a set profit or letting the market run. Dan, come on, this method is less than 3 weeks old. We are still developing it here. I am still getting use to when to trade it and when to not trade it especially on the M30. My first chart I posted (Post #2) had great trades where you could get 20 pips on a M30. That is hard to do most other times. I did a small back test, about 4 months, on GBP on the 4H and found 80 pips gave the most profit as oppose to getting out when MA turned. Taking 10 pips on a H4 gave 100 % profit but over all made less money. 80 pips was about 75% profitable. There is no right answer here. Like I said in previous post, a person trading, especially with high leverage, needs to have developed trading skills. This will help you to know when to take profit. (As far as your spike, it may be a bad tick. It is on none of my charts. Who provides your data service?)

--- 帖子 #215 ---
The Tlatomi uses the the 5 EMA and 9 SMA. Make sure your 5 MA is exponential. NonLag MA is not used and I think the forum has come to the conclusion that the 5/9 is a better entry signal. (see PDF on Post #157 ) It is not a good idea to close when dot appears. As we all have found out, it repaints when you refresh the chart. I would use a cross of the FX Sniper or a reverse signal.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Thanks. Dan.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
I am currently at 1.5% of available funds. I consider this method still in a trial stage but I have advanced to trading real money. Once I see my personal track record growing I will slowly increase my percent of funds used, maybe as high as 7%. I have not determined my average stop loss on a 4H. I monitor the trades except when I go to sleep for 6 hours. I am in a position tonight so I will probably set my stop at 80 pips. That will be about 1.2% risk in current postion. If I see the H4 reverse I will not wait for my stop to be hit. Once I have traded this method on a 4H long enough I will have an average of what my losses are. That will help me determine how high I can raise my percent of avaiable funds to trade. Maybe I can get the risk:reward ratio over 1:3 like you suggested.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
As I said on above post, I want to risk about 1.2%. That means if a 4H trade comes up and the 1.2% risk is not in a good spot, i.e below a pivot, trend line or other likely spot that will tell me I'm wrong, I will skip the trade. I will get out even if my stop is not hit if the market looks bad. Bad could mean new signal in the other direction. Just to make your procedure above clear, I liked to reverse steps 2 and 3. Have FX Sniper cross in buy mode and then 5/9 cross. Here is a Tip: Crosses should have good angles. If FX Sniper is giving a flatten out cross that is usually a market that is trading in a range. Skip trade.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Thank You, Dan.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
No problem on the EMA change. I will repost EA with change. But with using the FX Sniper or reverse cross of the 5/9 MA to close orders, there is quite often reverse cross too early to take max profit on the trend. The EA uses it own code to calculate dot value, which is value 1 or -1. So, refresh to the chart will have no effect on EA. The chart paints dots from the attached SHI-SilverTrendSIG indicator. I will look at other possible reverse signals. Any suggestions is appreciated. Wackena

Here is what happened with my GBP/JPY short trade last night. Entered according to the signals, the price went the oppsite direction, which is not unexpected. However, what confused me a quite bit is that the opposite dot of the trend reversal (i.e. red in my case) had never showed up i.e. even after 100 pips from my entry point (i.e. my entry was at 219.67, and the price went up all the way to 220.67). Could please someone explain this phenomena? Thank you in advance

--- 帖子 #226 ---
The GBP/JPY is a very volitile pair. It does not respect Pivots, fibs or s and r the way other pairs do.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Thanks a lot for your respond, MissForex, but my question was about the algorithm the script functions by, not this particular pair. What I am curious about is how come such huge move ended up undetected/ignored by the script i.e. didn't trigger the opposite dot, indicating the trend reversal, to show up.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
how about using zerolagstoch to close position?

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Here is my chart that does not show the dot and cross that you took. I was in a trade the other day and I swore I was trading a signal but when I came back my stop was hit and I couldn't figure out why I got in. I will take pics of charts on each trade now to make sure I do not imagine something. My chart may look different because the data come from InterbankFX. Where does your data come from? http://www.pianopeople.net/pics/GBPJPY.jpg

i was following also gbpjpy and i got that trade. the dots moved. I was following it all the time for all day yesterday. i trade with fxdd platform mt4. i send u screenshot. i had the cross and the dot that u see now on the screenshot is no the first dot I saw. the dot I saw and made me enter short was 3 bars before, right on the cross(where is arrow green, there was dot) which then changed

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Can anybody explain why do my pivots look like this? I'm confused: 1. In the first case the pivots are too close, so they are don't really helpfull. 2. In the second case they change in one or two candles, so I don't know which one to pick in the trade time, and If I have to change the SL and TP based on pivots, when a pivot line changes direction. The name of the indicator is simply "pivot" (included in the package od 250 or 450 indicators, that I've found on FF) Under TF options of the indicator I've selecet "all timeframes" mostly, because If i choose a single timeframe, there are no pivots on the chart, or simply only the names of the pivot lines appear, but there are no lines. Hope I make it clear. Thank you

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Hi opti, Use this one instead, I have found it to be much clearer. I must tell you that you should really look at FIBS as resistance and support. They are much better (for me) than pivots. I've attached both indicators for your use. For more info on how to use the Vegas FIBS, you can go to the downloads section of this website: www.tunneltrading.com Hope this helps, and all the best, forexpips

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Here are attached GBP/JPY on two TimeFrames (H4 &amp; H1). The red dot on H1 is below the visual zone, but it is there. The longer is watch/test this method the more I am convinced that trading from dot to dot would be the most efficient way to trade it. Stop loss 10 pips above/below the highest/lovest bar of the previous move. Here is a question to Wakena. How should I change the code to do just that? btw, until now I never trusted any automated trading EA, this is the very first one, that I trust enough to test while trading in the real environment. THANK YOU, ORANGE ROSHAN! THANK YOU, WAKENA!

--- 帖子 #236 ---
lietuve, To use your StopLoss concept make these changes. In the Order Open Routine section. Just under if(Buy1==1) Inserted Code if (StopLossMode==true) StopLossLevel = Ask - StopLoss * Point; else StopLossLevel = 0.0; Change to: Inserted Code if (StopLossMode==true) StopLossLevel = SHMin - StopLoss * Point; else StopLossLevel = 0.0; Just under if(Sell1==1) Inserted Code if (StopLossMode==true) StopLossLevel = Bid + StopLoss * Point; else StopLossLevel = 0.0; Change to: Inserted Code if (StopLossMode==true) StopLossLevel = SHMax + StopLoss * Point; else StopLossLevel = 0.0; StopLossMode needs to be = true Set the input StopLoss = 10 Hope this works OK.

Hey Wackena, I'm trying to attach tlatomi beta 1.0a EA to a chart. Could you tell me how to properly download this EA and then how to get it running on a chart? I can download indicators easily and use them, but i'm having trouble getting EA's up and running. And another thing, does the tlatomi beta 1.0a EA repaint itself in real time when used? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Hi Wackena ! My questions regarding your expert advisor are as follows : 1. Does the EA automatically repaint the dots after the next bar opens ? 2. If you watch the dots carefully you can notice, that the dots don't jump to the next bar on the opening on a new one. The dots stay at their place !! So if the dots don't jump after the opening of a new bar it will be a good indication, that the trend has reached a top / bottom. Can you implement this in your bogie EA ?? Thanks and happy pipping Bernhard

--- 帖子 #240 ---
paddyman, 1. download EA and place in Metatrader 4 Experts folder (not Indicators folder). 2. open EA with MetaEditor and Compile EA. 3. You should now see EA in Expert Advisors folder in the MetaTrader. Drag EA onto chart. Wackena

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Bernhard, 1. The EA has no visible graphics, except for the Comment text in upper left hand corner of charts. The visible grahics come from the SHI_SilverTrendSIG indicator. The EA and Indicator are not connected. They each produce their own data. (and this data is only part of the data the EA uses to determine order entry). 2. The Indicator produced dot only appears once when a reverse trend has been determined. It stays stationary and then the next dot indicates next trend change. 3. I don't understand your concept for EA change. Please post an entry and exit example for your concept. Wackena

--- 帖子 #242 ---
The Silvertrend indicator as coded will not function correctly for currency pairs involving the JPY. The indicator does not compensate for the difference in the value of a pip.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
You may be onto something here A couple of notes of caution. The dots will repaint themselves, so you have to be careful IMO you need to pay attention to the slope of the FX Sinper indicator, if the slope is near zero especially if &gt; 250, the dot can be a good place to get in. If the slope of the FX Sniper indicator is high (pos or negative) then I would wait, refresh the chart see if the dot repaints and look for the slope of the FX Sniper indicator to go towards zero. Then the entry will be more accurate. pay attention to ensure that the crossover happens.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
would someone please post the recent rules, because there it's a bit confusing in here Thank you! Greets mike

--- 帖子 #245 ---
I am using StrategyBuilder which is essentially Metatrader (just can't make Metatrader connect any longer). The data feed server comes from "MoneyTec-Demo - MoneyTec LLC", if it makes any sense. Eventually, the short dot moved 4 bars right and now appears like on your chart. I am not sure what you are trying to say here. I am well aware that on smaller time frames dots appear more frequently, but I am testing the original strategy which states that one should wait till the reverse dot on the 4 hr chart shows up to close the position.

to liutve. i watched 4 hrs chart of gbpjpy all these days constantly and the dots were repainted on it but is not the first time i see them in my chart u see blue for long and red for short(i mean dots) but anyways the dot u have on 4 hrs for the sh came before and then repainted there

just wanted to show u this 4 hr eurchf. the first trade(where i put 1) that was a stop, the second trade(2) was blocked by the red dot on top. we had sniper, blue dot and cross but right away the candle after it was a red dot

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Hi Wackana ! I will describe it in more simple words Before taking action into a trade the following has to appear : 1. Long Trade : - Blue dot appears =&gt; Prepare for going long =&gt; Wait for next bar opening - Next bar is open =&gt; refresh chart =&gt; if blue dot jumps =&gt; Wait for next bar =&gt; if blue dot doesn't jump =&gt; Enter Long Trade !! 2. Short Trade : - Red dot appears =&gt; Prepare for going short =&gt; Wait for next bar opening - Next bar is open =&gt; refresh chart =&gt; if red dot jumps =&gt; Wait for next bar =&gt; if red dot doesn't jump =&gt; Enter Short Trade !! I'd made the experience that if for example a blue dot appears for the first time the price of the currency may go down with the next 3 or 4 bars coming. Every time the blue dot jumps down to adjust itself. But if the moment comes when this blue dot does not jump, if the new bar has opened its time to enter the trade !! Do you agree with it ?? Can you reprogram the expert advisor accordingly ?? I appreciate your reply may it good or bad Happy Pippin

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Here is an idea. Draw a trendline on whatever chart it is that u are using. Only take signals in direction of the trend. that should have kept anyone out of the false signals. I also suggest opening 2 positions and closing the first at 10 pips and setting the other at BE or trail it. just my 2 cents

--- 帖子 #252 ---
behof, I did a quick search and it seems that MetaQuotes doesn't allow refreshing charts to be part of EA code. I read this on the MetaQuotes forum. If anyone knows this not to be true, please advise. The EA and SHI_SilverTrend_SIG indicator calculates the dot position the same way. I'm not sure if this is totally correct, but I think the indicator has current data, and for whatever reason can not update chart automatically to repaint dot. This now needs to be manually updated by refreshing the chart. For a point of reference, the dot appearance value from the EA and indicator is referenced as 1 for RED buy and -1 for BLUE sell. The EA also has current data. and it waits until new bar starts. At that this point, the EA checks to see if the value for dot has just changed and the 5 EMA and 9 SMA has crossed in the correct direction for either buy or sell. I don't think the EA can totally emulate the manually trading. Time will tell in forward testing if it can survive. Attached are 3 backtest results. tlatomi1 - dot appear, start new bar, 5EMA cross 9SMA. tlatomi2 - dot appear only tlatomi3 - dot appear, start new bar If you can trust backtest results, results fairly good.

I am well aware that on smaller time frames dots appear more frequently, but I am testing the original strategy which states that one should wait till the reverse dot on the 4 hr chart shows up to close the position.[/quote]// Manul, I was trying just to be helpful, that's all. Looking at your chart I didn't see the time frame you were trading from neither prices, so I attached 2 time frames (H1 and H4) to my response. Let's forget the H1, and if you looked at H4 with the settings that I use you'd see: the red dot (buy) appeared approximately at 217.7.. , (that's what I count as a begining of a trend) and then the blue dot appeared 18 bars later, the place to close the buy was at 220.4.. What I wanted to say is it is not good to open the trade in the middle of the trend, 'cause you never know how far it would go. On my chart there was never any dots in between those two. You should 've had no les than 250 pips profit on that trade. Check your settings. Good luck

You generous and patient as always . I don't want to mess up a nice trend with my ideas; in one of the postings you reffered to results trading from dot to dot. Can you pm me that code, please. I am trying to do it on my own, but.. you know how it is with beginners Any way I understood that SHMax is the highest/lovest level of SHI silver Trend signal of the trend prior to the recent dot. That's helpful. I should look into SHI silver Trend code to see if it matches the lowest and the highest price in that trend. Anyway, thank you a lot. Good day!

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Hey jtrader01, I'm no expert I've been working on my forex skills for the past 6months, but i've discovered these threads in forex factory which have given me new perspectives. Looking at the sidus thread, tlatomi experience/method etc. Maybe on this chart if we zoom out we can see that the overall trend is side ways on the four hour, so really its not trending and is a bit choppy for the time being. If your worried about these red dots popping up from the SHI trend sig, then be aware that they repaint themselves in real time. If we are not trending and your worried that you should put a stop on based on the red SHI dot then perhaps a stop should be placed just below the high (place this around 1.6805) which we can see just below the red dot on the previous small top on your chart. So if you have just opened your trade at 1.6785 and you close at 1.6805 then you've made 20 pips without sticking with your blood presure fluctuating with the price rising and falling wondering will it get better or worse, will it pick up or is this as good as the price gets... This is just how i read it. What do other people think?

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Hi Wackena ! First of all thank you very much for your reply I've watched the charts for some hours and followed the dots What I discovered is the following : 1. If the slope of the 5 EMA reaches zero whether it's coming from the up- or downside the doesn't move any longer !! 2. So maybe you can change the SHI_Silvertrend Indicator in that way that the dots are only painted, if the slope of the 5 EMA reaches zero !! 3. Then you enter long or short with a stop loss for example 30 pips 3. It's similar to the 8 SMA in the 4h Vegas Tunnel 4. This could be an interesting EA...... Happy Pippin Bernhard

I think Forex trading is all about probabilities. There is no way to predict market all the time 100%. Sometimes losses will occur. The important thing is that profits would cover the loss and still leave some for us. About your chart... let's look at the last four dots that appeared on the chart when the market started to go sideways (we never know in advance when it happens) and what the dots told you. The first blue dot appeared and at the OPEN of the next candle let's say you bought EUR/AUD and held that trade until the next red dot appeared. Then at the OPEN you would've closed the long and went short at the same time. Nice profit isn't it? Now you are short and at the close of the candle the blue dot appeared. So you'd close the short at the OPEN and go long. You had a nice profit, isn't it? Now you are long and the last red dot made you close that long with a nice profit at OPEN and go long at the same time. At this point you are long and the trade is going against you. When it went appr 25 pips above the highest of the previous trend up (previous from blue to red) your S/L should have taken you out. Now wait for the next dot to appear. So you'd have had all together 4 trades in a sideways market. 3 of them were profitable, the 4th was taken out by S/L. You still have a nice profit. And by now you'd realized that this is a sideways market, and MA crossovers on the bigger TF are not the best way to trade it. So either change the method for for now, or just wait until the next dot appears and make your decision what to do then, depending if it is a breakout or still sideways trend. I didn't mean to teach you, I just wanted to tell you how I see the situation on this chart, and I like it. As I said it is all probabilities, but with this method they are not bad at all! Peace.

Hi, Wackena I owe you an appology by misspelling your name Didn't notice in time, sorry.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
to lie.. thx for replying but just 2 things: first i don't trade only accordingly to the dots coming, i wait also for sniper and for cross of ma's, so the second trade u mean(the sh one) was not to be taken if following the rules coz no sniper signal. second if u trade only with the dots would not be such a great way to trade, coz dots repaint and move themselves, but I will check ur idea only to trade with dots. tell u updates after and btw, how u find urself trading with it?

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Actually, as I would have expected, it looks the other way around of what you are saying i.e. the correlation between different data feeds is the closer the longer the time period. Attached the AUDUSD charts from StrategyBuilderFX and InterbankTrader for different time frames: WK, H4, and M1. As you can see, the WK charts look quite close, H4 somewhat close, M1 complitely different.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Probably you didn't understand what I was saying. We are talking about 2 different things. If the brokers use the same time for their datafeed, the 4hr and dailies are indeed similar. But how can they be similar if the time is different? Let's say gpbusd rallies from 1.88 to 1.90 from 8 AM to noon GMT, then drops to 1.89 in the next 2 hours. The broker whose 4hr candle starts at 8 AM GMT will show a big bullish candle on its charts with the opening price 1.88 and close price 1.90. The one whose 4hr starts at 10 AM and ends at 2 PM would have a doji instead with both open and close price around 1.89. As a result the signals given by any indicators or EA can be completely different. Even if the 2 brokers quote the exact same price at the same time, their 4hr charts would look completely different . Something similar happens on the daily charts, which start/end at different times of the day. Even more than that, some brokers even display a candle for Sunday and most of them don't. It is also why people have so many problems with their pivots and cam levels - they use different numbers because the open/close/high/low of the previous day is not the same one. If you are still not convinced I can attach some pictures. Weekly and monthly charts should be identical or close to it (at this level even if you have 5-10 pips difference it won't matter too much, because compared to the size of the candle it's a very small difference). You are right that on smaller time frames there can be some small difference because the quotes are not identical (they cannot be too far away from the interbank feed though). Especially on 1 min charts where every pip means a lot, also on candles at news times.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Thanks for clarification, LazyPawn, gotcha - no need in pictures. Yes, I did misunderstand you. But now I am quite confused on how to properly use this and other time sensitive systems. As already been observed, due to time frame differentials, ppl get different entry/exit signals depending on the way the candles are formed. So whose signals are correct and whose aren't and why? Perphaps, more precise questions would be 1) which time zone gives better signals? 2) is Sunday data to be included in calculation and if yes starting what time, because usually till the London session the market is flat most of the time?

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Excellent questions manul - and they are not strictly related to the tlalomi method. Let me tell you what I think (just my personal opinion). We cannot say that someone's signals are correct or "better" than others'. Important is to always follow the signals from one and the same data provider. On the other hand when analyzing a certain system, especially one that works mostly on 4hr time frame, I think it's imperative that all people posting charts use one and the same MT4 source. Otherwise there is a lot of confusion when somebody has a signal and many others don't because their feed is different. I have tried several MT4 demo platforms and I prefer the ones based on GMT+2 (GMT+3 during the summer) like FXDD or NorthFinance. It doesn't mean that I trade with them, I just use them for charting purposes. There are a few reasons that make this time zone better, even if it's not as popular as GMT for example. Please refer to http://strategybuilderfx.com/showpos...0&amp;postcount=11 for more details.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
I got 2 computers open with StrategyBuilderFX and InterbankTrader. Their quote is difference even in real time...... Not sure because I am using demo account or not... Also I am using 1Hr Tunnel + 5&amp;9 Cross + Tlatomi on a 1hr chat. It give a quite nice result. will do more testing on it..

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Hey guys....i'm back from my vacation...sorry...i forgot to tell You guys...So, how's the trading??? Tnaks guys !!! Thank You, Dan.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Paddyman, What you are saying has inspired me to respond. I have been testing the Tlatomi method for only two days but in that time I have made some key observations. First I must thank Judex001 for introducing us to this method and all other participants who have contributed to make this method a success. In the two days I have tested in demo mode I gained a total of 856 pips with no losses. I consider this phenomenal and have never had such success in this market (I've been trading FX and commodities for a while now). That being said, I have found what you are saying about trending is important to trading in general and this method in particular. If the overall trend is down, a buy signal will not gain as many pips as a sell signal going with the trend. If the trend is strong enough, I may not play contrary at all and wait for a signal that goes with the trend. If the trend is sideways, I find it less stressful to just wait for the pair to start moving. To help me better recognize the trend in the 4hr time frame, I borrowed from Kolachi's method and added a 200 ema with fibo lines and a 100 ema. This way I can clearly see what the long term trend is. In addition, I found I had to put aside the idea of a 30 pip stop. I am not suggesting anyone else do this but here's why; I have not had luck with any other time frame but the original 4hr. I am thinking because this is such a long block of time, the trade needs more breathing space to gather steam. My first trade was +200 pip but was first down -80 pips before it took off. I was mentally prepared to go to -100 but it didn't happen and besides, it's much easier to wait when it's demo money . Once it hit +200, I cashed out. I know we're supposed to wait for reversal dot to close but 200 looked too good to pass up and in fact the price did eventually reverse close to there. So that's where I am with my testing. I try to stick as close to the rules as possible, pay attention to the trend and in this case, use liberal money management to give the trade a chance to develop. I am curious to know if anyone else is working the money management portion of the Tlatomi method the same way. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Hi, I think OrangeRoshan, was the first to introduce this method. If I am wrong, sorry! Good day!

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Hi lietuve, I believe judex001 introduced the method with a thread titled "The Tlatomi Method". OrangeRoshan enhanced the method by introducing some nice innovations. In any event, let this be a lesson to anyone interested; in my usual quest to make money faster veered off testing the method to test other indicators, methods etc. and guess what? I not only wiped out my gains with the Tlatomi method but dug an additional $500 hole in my demo account. This is really a personal turning point for me. Perhaps there is something about having the patience to wait for a 4hr method to play itself out that really suits me better than trying to snipe a few pips on a 5min chart. It is the temptation to bag pips in shorter time frames that eventually causes me to lose seemingly no matter what method I apply. I think for me anyway this temptation in part derives from the quickness of the trade. I can't tell you how many times I've sweated a copper or coffee commodity trade just waiting for a floor execution wheras Forex is a blink of an eye. I plan to stick with the Tlatomi Method in demo mode from this point forward to see how far I can take it. I will update here with my progress and observations.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Hello to all... I am new in the tlatomi method. Please let me know how i can set the 5EMA and 9SMA moving averages on the MT4 platform. All other indicators set except these Thanks

--- 帖子 #275 ---
The simpliest way is to click on Insert (on the top), then Indicators, the Moving Average and it will pop a small window where you can set the parameters (click on them, so you'll see the options). Was that your question? Good day!

--- 帖子 #276 ---
yes lietuve... thanks and the numbers before them stand for the periods ? Is it posible to write for me the complete setings for both moving averages ? Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #277 ---
5 period Exponential MA, 9 period Simple MA, usually, by default, if nothing else is mentioned, at Close price.

Any one having nice profits with bogie Tlatomi?. Which versions are you guys use. I been using the V1.0f. But I dont have any trades it all in a demo account. If I Have many EA running in one demo account, Is it going to affect my demo trades? And what happend with EA when I shut down my PC? Is it going to be new trades? Thank you guys.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Hello Roshan....sorry if my question is so late to U, cos I am seeing this post now... ....what is the 3 line break system that you mentioned above? Could you please explain that to me, or if may, Could you please give the indicator if you have it. Thanks Roshan. All helps will be deeply appreciated! Warmest Regards

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Greetings; I did read the entire first thread on the tlatomi, and everywhere it said that the 4h was the only profitable timeframe. Have you switched to the 30M timeframe? If so, are the indicators still the same? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
What about the aligators?

--- 帖子 #282 ---
What about the Vegas indicators, as it says in the updated PDF?

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Greetings everyone, It is interesting to me that with all the talk of entries and exits, not one post on here mentions aligators (to help eliminate false signals) or Vegas indicators (to take profits). This is interesting to me because the PDF about this trading method clearly mentions these indicators as helping us get in and out of the trades. Does anyone trade according to the rules in the PDF or have we all developed our own personal style?

--- 帖子 #284 ---
I have some problem with SHI SilverTrendSig indicator. I attached this indicator to several charts but new dots dont apear . I have to switch between timeframes to apear new dots. Can somone please explain to me why ??

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Hi, I am fallowing the tlatomi method for 1-1,5 month and it's really wonderfull method. i have planing to use it in live acc. but i have a problem. when i see dot, then croos of cci then ma cross alert and when nonlog turns yellow, i'm waiting for bar close, but when bar closed, the opposite dot appears. and i cannot decide to trade. also, i can't exit immediately because the dot repaints! what should i do? Anybody help me...

--- 帖子 #286 ---
I am trading original tlatomi method live for three weeks now and it is a little bit different to trade it live or backtest it manually... One of the reasons for that is opposite dot which appears after the yellow line signal (I also didnt know what to do at first), but from my experience, you should ignore it because it usually moves from last bar to curent when closed. You can consider some other signal for getting out of the trade, Sniper crossing for example. My target is 10 pips for each trade with sl 100 pips (for now, about 40 winning trades in a row...).

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Yes, repaint the past. In the thread you can find other indicator SHI silver that not repaints the past, buy i don't like it. In the system, Shi Silver is not very important. Coyan To Coyan or anyone else that would know this answer. You said there are shi silver dots that do not repaint the past, where can I get those? Can someone send them to me or post them on the forum? Another question is, if they dont repaint the past, then why isnt everyone useing them? It seems logical that everyone would want a predictive shi silver indicator to tell what the high or the low is. Anyways, yes I am new to this method of trading so please take that into consideration when responding back to my questions, thanks in advance&lt;!-- / message --&gt;

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Totally agree that "Shi Silver is not very important". Actually, I even find it quite misleading and therefore don't use it at all.

Hi guys

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Wackena: Brilliant EA. Do I understand that version F trades only from MA cross to MA cross, without stops, and is always in the market? Thanks. Glenn

--- 帖子 #291 ---
EA has 2 filters and 1 time point to trigger order calls. 1st filter (UseDots) is up or down trends based on SHI_SilverTrendSig indicator type signals. 2nd filter (UseCross) is the 5&amp;9 EMA cross. 3rd time point (UseStartNewBar) is to wait till start of new Bar. They can only be used in sequence such as: UseDots=true, UseCross=false, UseStartNewBar=false. Dots only. UseDots=true, UseCross=true, UseStartNewBar=false. Dots and Cross. UseDots=true, UseCross=true, UseStartNewBar=true. Dots and Cross and UseStartNewBar. If UseCloseSignal=true, no tp or sl. Close signal is reverse of trend as indicated by Dots. If UseCloseSignal-false, uses input tp and sl to close order. TrailingStop works in both UseCloseSignal modes. If UseHedge=true, hedge order call is triggered after 1st order if close of previous Bar-3 is higher or lower than current Bar. Attached is latest f version. Wackena

Glenn, Look in the Expert and Journal tabs in the Terminal window. If there is a trading error, it will be reported here. Also Click on Help and then click About.... Here you see Version and build number. Verify if it is build 200. These settings look OK. If UseMM=true, the EA disregards Lots setting and auto calculates Lot size based on Risk % of account equity. Wackena

Our good friend, Wackena graciously provided the following: Glenn, There may be one thing that could effect trading. Recently MetaQuote made obsolete some programming language. One term that is in this EA is CurTime(). It has been changed to TimeCurrent(). Open the EA with MetaEditor and then Ctrl-f to bring up the Find window. Type in CurTime() and click find. Change this to TimeCurrent() and then compile EA. I'm not sure this is the problem. If it is an EA problem including this one above, these errors will be posted in Journal and Expert tabs in terminal window.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Something interesting again! The 5ema crossed below the 9sma. EA opened a "BUY" order!!

--- 帖子 #302 ---
I made that change in metaeditor, but demo did not trade subsequently, even though dot and arrow were present. I will look at the code to see if I can determine if the buy/sell parts are reversed! NorthFinance.com is unwilling to assist with autotrader problems. Thanks, Wilson.

--- 帖子 #303 ---

--- 帖子 #305 ---
winsteadglenn and wilson1668, I reviewed the code this weekend and found a program flaw. Attached is the fixed EA - tlatomi-v1.0fb. I apologize for posting a non working EA. After resolving the problem, I backtested the EA and was not satisfied with the results. It worked OK on eurusd, but not on gbpusd, usdchf, usdjpy. I have to admit to feeling quilty about the previous EA not working. I just don't like these types of mistakes on my part. So in attempt to redeem myself, I spent some time in studying the backtest results and found what might be a point of interest. The 5ema and 9sma cross in generating a trade signal may not be what is needed. I've added these new vairables. pd1=0; // Period for 1st MA indicator ma1-0; // Moving Average for 1st indicator - 0=SMA, 1=EMA, 2=SMMA, 3=LWMA pc1=0; // Price Method for 1st indicator - 0=close, 1-open, 2=high, 3=low, 4=median, 5=typical, 6=weighted close pd2=0; // Period for 2nd MA indicator ma2=0; // Moing Average for 2nd indicator - 0=SMA, 1=EMA, 2=SMMA, 3=LWMA pc2=0; // Price Method for 2nd indicator - 0=close, 1-open, 2=high, 3=low, 4=median, 5=typical, 6=weighted close I found that different currency pairs works better in tlatomi-v1.0fb with different settings for the above variables. The correct MA cross settings is currency pair specific. It depends if the pair is moderate to strong trending or slow rangeing. Using a fix MA set, like 5ema-9sma may cross too fast or too slow for for that specific pair. Attached are 6 months Strategy Tester results and set files for the 4 majors developed by the Optimization tests on the above variables. I used Alpari data, downloaded on 2006.12.13 The currency pair set, in the attached zip file, must be loaded to its corresponding chart. I don't know if demo or live results will be the same, but these results were quite good. Wackena

The wife and kids are running through the house screaming with joy. The dog is barking happiness. When I lean out the window, I can hear Wilson and his family screaming with joy in Hong Kong (sound travels well in Montana). You are a genius, a gentleman, my hero, and my friend. Thank you. Glenn. It is my birthday/ nice present.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Hello Wackena, No apologize at all. You are great guy! I should say thanks to your effort in stead. Wilson

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Hi again and sorry for bothering you, I am forward testing with the original concept (5EMA/9SMA). See attached picture, the order opened while the MAs have not crossed each other.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
The pound worked flawlessly. The Euro fired off a little before the 9/5 cross. The franc and the yen were right on time, but gave me a buy where it meant to sell. Cool idea to optimize your system. I have all those mods embedded, now. Thanks. We are knocking on the door of success! Glenn

--- 帖子 #310 ---
If you are using v1.0fb, the MA cross is reversed. It you want standard 5ema/9sma cross, then use these settings: pd1=9; ma1=0; pc1=0; pd2=5; ma2=1; pc2=0; If another tlatomi EA version, let me know which one and I will check it out. Wackena

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Glenn, MA indicators of 5EMA and 9SMA on charts will not show trigger crosses for tlatomi v1.ofb. As I responded to Wilson, this version of MA cross is reversed and the MA chart indicator needs to be set to same values as used on pair chart. Wackena

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Hi Wackena, I am trying v1.0fb, will try again according to your recommendations. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Thanks, Wackena. Do those settings apply to all four major currency pairs? $/pound;$/Yen;$/Euro; $/Franc. I presume that will negate the changes I made that were currency pair specific? Looking good. Thanks again, Amigo.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Wackena, Can v1.0fb run with another EA on the same account? If not, can you please add a magic number to it? Thx.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Somehow the USD/CHF has opened a position in the oposite direction of the trend: LONG, instead of short. I am using the latest version with the correct .set file attached to the pair. Any idea why this is happening?

--- 帖子 #316 ---
same trade opened here.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
What's the progression of the trail stop on this? I see it's set for 30, but it's not moving with price. How are the steps incremented?

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Even though I'm using the individual .set files, the comments on every chart still say ema 5 and sma 9. And when I do a backtest, the parameters also say pd1 is 5 and pd2 is 9, even though the EA's parameters are different. I generally don't do backtests so not realy sure if there's another change I have to make. Just not sure why the parameters are not showing in the backtest report.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Yes, that is my mistake. I forgot to change comment line in v1.0fb. It does not effect trading, it's just a visible reference. I will fix. If you backtest, you should put set files in the tester folder. Then in Strategy Tester, open Expert Properties window. Then click Load and input appropriate set file into tester. To avoid confusion, I should have set all of these values in the EA to =0. That way if the new values were not inputed from set files, the EA would not place orders. The 5 an 9 values were a carryover from previous version. I've coded another version to have values for different pairs hard coded in EA. I will try to get it posted this week. Wackena

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Wackena, What do you think about this trade mentioned here. It looks like it was in the opposite direction. Any ideas why? Was it actually correct at the time.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Unfortunately tlatomi v1.0fb does not know if it is a the beginning of a trend, in the middle or near the end. It only confirms that trigger conditions are met. For a long, it is UD = 1 (-1 for short) and MA1 &gt; MA2. In the version you are using, you see 5 EMA and 9 SMA values, but you can see in attached chart, that entry conditions were correct. Just not good entry point timing. Wackena

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Makes sense. So when will it exit the trade? Is there something that will allow it to exit before the 100 pip stop loss?

--- 帖子 #323 ---
If UseCloseSignal=true, then only exit is the next reverse trade signal. No tp or sl is used. If = false, tp and sl settings are used. Wackena

--- 帖子 #324 ---
OrangeRoshan has argued that it is better to wait for the 9/5 cross, than it is to trade on the Shi_Silvertrend dot. Looking back, on the 1 hr. charts, it appears that the dot always nails the apex and nadir of a move. There is often a significant loss of pips, while waiting for the cross. Since the repainting of the dot issue is presumably fixed in the EA by our friend Wackena, does it not make sense to pivot the trade on the dot? Would not a trailing stop loss of 30 pips or so be sufficient protection? Glenn

I found this post # 67 under Channel Trading at Forex-TSD.com by newdigital Administrator Igorad created the second version of NonLagZigZag indicator (attached). He wrote to me the following: Quote:It's first ZigZag which is connected with Moving Average and should be very useful for detection of pivot points. This ZZ is workable for any TimeFrame and has not winding sections. I think it'll good replacement of SHI indicators for some systems like Tlatomi for example.

TimeCur() is obsolete term being replaced with TimeCurrent(), but presently TimeCur() still works in all MT4 platform versions. Two ways to fix. 1. Upgrade MT4 platform to build 201. This version recognizes TimeCurrent() term. 2. Open EA in MetaTrader, then ctrl-F and find each TimeCurrent() and change to TimeCur(). After all changes are complete, click Compile button in upper menu bar. Wackena

Greatings for all, I have just finished reading this thread, and I have a couple of questions, but first I'd like to thank Wackena for his precise ansewers earlier on this thread, they helped me a lot. How does the MM option works in Talatomi? If risk is set to 10, does it mean that I am risking 10% of my equity each trade? How many trades can be set simultaneously? I've just saw the new NonLag Zigzag Igorad have created. Should we replace the NonLagMA with this one? Did anyone forward tested it? Thanks in anticipation, CRE

Can Someone please refer me to an explanation of how does the NonLagMA works, or maybe even its definition? I've searched for it today, but couldn't find it.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
http://www.forexfactory.com/forexfor...ead.php?t=6922 check first page of Tlatomi Method Thread for pictures of nonlag MA.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
I've seen the pictures, read the thread and the PDF. They all tell me how to use it, it does not tell me WHAT it is. I seek to understand WHY the indicatour is acting like that, For that I need to know how it is calculated. Can anyone help me?

This method is bueno, I'm really excited to continue studying it. Im just curious what people think are the best pairs on the 4hour time frame. I believe I saw Dan only trades the GBP combo's, some people trade a lot of pairs, so what do the wise folks at the forum feel are the best? p.s. I'm 23 I studied the U.S. Stock market for a long time, about 18 months ago I heard about the Forex, and I have just recently came to financial position where I am ready to get dedicated to trading for a career. Furthermore, I have learned more at this forum in the past 6 months, then I ever knew about the stock market or the prior year I studied the forex. So thanks a million pips Aaron

Availdollars, Tlatomi is very good and profitable method and suitable for trending market. For eg, yesterday I bagged 200pips with GDP/JPY using tlatomi method. I just use a basic tlatomi methos...5ema &amp; 9sma cross and the nonlagMA v4. It's all available in early of this thread. Just be patient to wait for the right time. Use only 4hr or daily time frame. Hope that helps..

CAN SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP ME INCREASE THE WIdTH OF THE DOT when i go into properties n change width it works but as soon as i change the TF it returns to it;s original size, also can it be made to rest on top of the candlestick shadow (H/L). The reason: when the FX Siner window is open in the chart the signal remian below the chart n cannot be seen in similar way when the price is on the top edge of the chart window the signal remains hidden maybe genuis Judex001 or Wackena can help me God bless you

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Look in the code for the number 159; Replace it with 108 , and then compile, for a juicy, fat dot. (Data from former Wackena post).

hi, was interested in this thread because I also use a strategy which incorporates the nonlagMA. I noticed that the EA developed has substituted 2 MA's for the nonlagMA - so I have a question or two. do the 2 MA's in the EA developed replicate that movement of the nonlagMA ? has anyone been able to develop an EA based around the nonlagMA ? (I think that it would be awesome if someone did !! ) Cheers, AJ

When I'm writing this, I want to give a little bit of background about me. I'm trading demo since mid 2005. Started live in Jan 2006. Blew up 2k on 2 micro account. Started developing my own ADX/Standard Deviation based system for last few months till I found Tlatomi, I've stopped working on that instead I integrated my system with Tlatomi. Nothing much just the standard deviation thing. Its a good indicator of trend strength. I'll post my template and all variables in few days. Just wanted to share something, its not a perfect system. On H4 if you follow Tlatomi and enter with 5/9 cross... you can count on it. I've made 1087 pips in last two weeks on GBP/JPY. Thats enough for me to stick to Tlatomi till I don't find anything sent from the heavens itself. Great work guys!

Hi everybody. Can somebody expand the program for the ma crossover to give a sound signal as well, it should have 2 signals, one for each arrow. If possible i would like to use an external sound clip, not the normal doorbell stuff. I wouldn't have a clue how to do this - can somebody help please? regards.

TO, Is this thread closed ?

--- 帖子 #347 ---
anyone still following tlatomi?

--- 帖子 #348 ---
I am still following it... practicing it on demo.. i like it..simple and profitable, what i really like about it is u only need a small S/L.. If you follow the signals strictly the moment u enter a trade u will start to see profit rolling de... Just my 0.02

hi , i have read this thread as well as the other tlatlomi thread. I am watching the 4H chart and the 30M chart. I have one question here. on the 4H chart, we wait for the dot first, then the FXI trigger, then the non LAG indicator, then we enter when the 5and 9 MA cross. ok here is the question: on the 30M chart, it seems that the 5 and 9 MAs cross before the nonlag MA turns yellow. So, on the 30M chart, we wait for the DOT, then the FXI trigger, then the 5and 9 MAs to cross and we enter as they cross. WHAT IS THE POINT IN THE NON LAG ON THE 30M chart, if we have already entered before it has turned yellow? I know we need the non lag on the 4h chart, but we dont need it on the 30 M chart? is this correct? thanks 1

GU is up now, does any one notice this ?

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Any1 here still trading tlatomi?

--- 帖子 #352 ---
well, i just laid my hands on, so I will start testing it from next week. how bout u? at least we can share trades together, if there is no one else on the thread probably they all got rich trading tlatomi method, so they should be on holiday or shopping now. Anyone using a fixed stop loss for GU or GY in this method, or stick to the old rulez? Thanx

--- 帖子 #353 ---
I would love to know if anyone is having success with the Wackena EA for Tlatomi.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Hi, is anybody still testing Tlatomi? How do you like it so far?

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Hello I currently trade, Tlat with some minor modifications, I use 4 hour TF and am having good results.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Hello Winsteadglenn Please let me have a copy of the EA and I'll let you know, personally I'm sceptical as I see the Talatomi system as a method based sytem not a box system. this is the main reason i have not tried to come up with an EA.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Hi, Money Magnet: I think the last posted EA version is here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...latomi&amp;page=21 It performed best on the four hour window, and Wackena had optimized it for a few pairs. Then the thread just died. Good system. My current interest is the Supernova Thread, which I think will also be very good, perhaps best on the one hour TF. Wackena went on to make a new EA, which he is renting out by the month. He used it in this year's automated trading championship, and placed second. Glenn

Hello Gnat I think it is dead, because traders are fickle and are alway searching for an easy way, the holy Grail. They are not prepared to lean the paitence and discipline in trading. I know of one other person and my self who have modified this system and trade it daily sucessfully. I today alone using this sytem have made more than 50 pips. My Modified TLat is as follows: Indicators: SHI_silver NonLagMA_v5 Gann_Hilo_Activator set to 3 Fx_sniper (4 8 5 4) SMI4hr (5 3 3 3) I trade it mailny on the 4hr with stops varing from 50-100 pips with traing stop implemented at 50 pip profit with target of 150 pips and from time on 30 min with stop of 30 target of 30, bad RRR. good luck

Hi Money Magnet, Please, help me ? What is the SMI4hr (5 3 3 3) ? Maybe, can You attach your indicators (and template) ? Thanks a lot, Viatoris

Hi Viatoris SMI4hr is just a modification to SMI, I have saved different ones for different TF's regards Frank

--- 帖子 #239 ---
so many indicators. It's not original tlatomi anymore. How do you trade it? can you give us some example? thanx

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Well, it seems i'm also attracted to the tlatomi, i've been reading and collecting opinions about it for a week, testing for 3 market days. Being honest im veeeery suspicious of trading systems, but this is changing already. Right now i just went long on cable, look at my D1 chart, the sttings i am using are those of the first post on tlatomi method thread (made by Judex) and the Tiga Abdul 5/9 MA crosses (tough im so temped to use the 5/8). I am hoping to hold to this trade quite a while, moving 10% of my acc, on a 50:1 leverage, with a stop loss on the low of the previous few days. Let's see what time brings us. also i have some questions: 01) Hey Judex, do you mind if i use that malaysian saying "Orang tamak selalu rugi" on my forum signature? i really liked it =) 02) Why is it tiga abdul? isnt only two MA's there, maybe "Dua Abdul"? heheh 03) Are there some staticitians on the thread? I'd like to discuss some tests we could try, or some refinements for the method as well as extending it to another pairs and the things regarding the whipsaws at small time frames. Thank you guys for sharing this, and let's work! http://img405.imageshack.us/img405/244/tgtmn4.gif

Hello Ronfis No it is not the original Tlatomi, in my opinion, it is improved and maybe a new thread started for it. In my opinion it is better, I have tested with trying various MA's, I have played with 5 and 50 Ma cross on the 30 min shows a better / stronger move on the 4hr and turn 5/50 on 4hr will show a bigger move on the daily. I have now moved Ma's out of it and have replaced it with Gann-hilo with parameters set to 3, this works for me and gives me oppertunities to still enter the trade if a siginal has heppened in my timezone overnight I attach the image of a 30min chart, I only take trades where fxsniper is above or below 200, with my stop set at the high of the candle prior to crossing Gann-hilo witha target of 30 pips Finally a 4hr chart, in my mind this is a clean chart and as to how to trade it, well if you know the original Tlatomi, you should have no problem adapting using my template. Good luck to you with what ever methods you go with. MM

I've ever backtested original tlatomi. And if I followed every signal that occurs, it produces negative expectancy. Not good for me. I'm just looking some filter for it. Btw, thanx moneymagnet.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Hi, how many signals did you use to calculate the expectancy? was it on the H4 timeframe?. And where is the non-original tlatomi? is it the one mixed with tiga-abdul? thank you

--- 帖子 #244 ---
I backtested tlatomi with nonlagMa_v4 in H4 EURUSD and USDYEN. Tigaabdul is just MA crossover. My opinion, nonlagMa is better than tigaabdul. Because in sideways, nonlagma doesn't change color, instead tigaabdul crossover is swirling around. I backtested it using traditional method, that's by testing hours and take note on paper every trade. I'm just very curious about this system. because it can catch very big move with low risk, but if I'm taking every signal, it's total loss. If I add filters, it will miss some big moves. Problematic. Now, I don't trade this system, just sometimes I'm watching it. Maybe someday I can get the edge to improve this system. regards

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Hello ... does someone control tlatomi??? It(he,she) wanted to speak with people who controls this system to comment on a few doubts .... I can share other systems that work or pay well. Thank you for your attention and I wait for your response pedromejor@hotmail.com

--- 帖子 #246 ---
This method does not work? What I am trying since January 2008 and so far everything is going to perfecction, but was lately are increasing losses, can someone help me? My stoop this loss to 40 pips and the use of tables in 4 hours. Thank you for your collaboration.
