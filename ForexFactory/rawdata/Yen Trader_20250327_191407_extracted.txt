*** UPDATE July 25th, 2016 ***

*** Starting from post#528 Yen Trader evolved into Cross Trader

*** where system idea is applied to all crosses, not only yen crosses

Attached Image

Pairs : XXXJPY, where XXX is one of the major currencies (except USD which will be used as a reference currency).

Time Frames : H1, H4, D1

Simple MethodIf XXXUSD is UP and USDJPY is UP --> BUY XXXJPY. EXIT when either XXXUSD is DOWN or USDJPY is DOWN. If XXXUSD is DOWN and USDJPY is DOWN --> SELL XXXJPY. EXIT when either XXXUSD is UP or USDJPY is UP. IF USDXXX is UP and USDJPY is DOWN --> SELL XXXJPY. EXIT when either USDXXX is DOWN or USDJPY is UP. IF USDXXX is DOWN and USDJPY is UP --> BUY XXXJPY. EXIT when either USDXXX is UP or USDJPY is DOWN. One way to define UP and DOWN on H1 time frame (as an example):Pair is UP if current price is greater than where it was 24 hours ago. Greater by a min of x pips. where x is H1 ATR(24). Pair is DOWN if current price is less than where it was 24 hours ago. Less by a min of x pips. where x is H1 ATR(24). Similar approaches can be applied to H4 and D1, so for H4 we can compare current price to a week ago, and for D1 to a month ago.

BUY Example on NZDJPY H1 (live) - Simple Method

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Initial Stop : when price hits the Red Line on Either Chart.

SL Loss can be trailed by last 24 hour price on both charts (Major and USDJPY).

EDIT : edited for corrected chart.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
The above example worked very well (live).

--- 帖子 #4 ---
it worked also with eurusd +usdjpy = eurjpy or gbpusd + usdjpy = gbpjpy. Am I  right ?

interesting approach.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Of course, XXX in XXXJPY from 1st post, refers to EUR,GBP,AUD,NZD,CHF and CAD.

NZD was just an example.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Hey abokwaik i dont know if i understand Your method.

In this example below can i buy here?

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Sorry for the late reply.

Actually your entry would be a bit late.

The best entry will be at the switch time.

For example &quot;If NZDUSD is UP and USDJPY is DOWN:For a BUY we wait for USDJPY to turn UP while NZDUSD is still UP. For a Sell we wait for NZDUSD to turn DOWN while USDJPY is still down.  If NZDUSD is DOWN and USDJPY is UP:For a BUY we wait for NZDUSD to turn UP while USDJPY   is still UP. For a Sell we wait for USDJPY   to turn DOWN while NZDUSD  is still down.  The method actually utilizes the JPY and USD Strength and Weakness.

If both are weak but JPY is weaker than USD we buy XXXJPY.

If both are strong but JPY is stronger than USD we sell XXXJPY.

I hope its clear.

I developed a couple of EAs to test the method, and I will post shortly.

However no many opportunities on higher time frames.

We will have more opportunities on lower time frame (some sort of scalping).

And of course it can be applied to multiple pairs.

No. On and Off as my time permits.

The EA is till running on EURJPY/M5 chart, where the trades from previous post were closed at trailing stop. And new ones opened

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Interesting strategy abokwaik.

But how do you backtest such an EA? I thought it was impossible in MT4, because you can't backtest multiple currency pairs (which are needed if you want to look where XXXUSD and USDJPY are heading, right)

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Minor Bug with trailing stops, sometimes it doesnt trail properly

--- 帖子 #15 ---
​Sorry,where do you take profit?

--- 帖子 #16 ---
In mt4 it is not possible to backtest an EA that TRADES multiple pairs, but it is always possible to READ multiple pairs data.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
By fixed TP or trailing stop as you activate/deactivate in input settings

--- 帖子 #18 ---
I will check and fix.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Interesting idea abokwait.

Could you develop also a dashboard ( or an indicator ) providing for each pair up or down 24 h earlier according your rules ?

--- 帖子 #20 ---
It crossed my mind but I am very lazy now a days so I left it for later.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
No problem I understand

It's just to give permanently the situation of each pair compared to USDJPY.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
​I agree with madscalp,any coders out there willing to take the job on please? :-)

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Currently forward testing eurusd + usdjpy --> eurjpy on ecn demo account.

No positions were opened the last 4 hours (since I started it). Trends were at least once in favor of EA.

Anyone experiencing the same? Interesting strategy!

​I got the same results ,piphunter7, looks like a good strategy to me ! :]

--- 帖子 #25 ---
do you have the 'loop back bars' set to 2?

This is an updated version (3) with fixed bugs posted by Soros (although the bug does not affect the results as it was modifying the stop with the same values).

Also I added description to inputs.

Note that the EA is still using a very simple (naive) method of identifying major pair and UJ pair directions.

Many other options can be tested :Indicator based : RSI,  CCI, HA , MA ... etc. Higher Time Frames.

I noticed through backtesting that the less number of loop back bars the better the results. This makes sense as usually USDJPY and XXXUSD are inversely correlated. So we are basically trading the divergence in this negative correlation which is translated to a short term trend in XXXJPY.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
abokwaik thanks for posting the bugfixed version. can i ask if you have settled on any particular times / session yet?

blam

got the same results... i am trying on GJ and NJ too. will update if we have something promising.. thanks a ton Khalil..

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Hi abokwait

Could you explain why you use M5 for the EA ?

--- 帖子 #32 ---
wrote you a pm

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Good Question : You mean why I am setting the EA to trade H1 time frame but attach it to M5.

Well, initially it was by mistake, but then I thought it could be good to have a higher Signal TF and a lower Entry TF, where we spread the position intended for the higher TF into multiple smaller trades on the lower time frame (in case you set Max Orders > 1).

However, it is not optimized yet. I mean for example with H1/M5 combination it will enter a new trade every 5 miniutes within the current H1.

Ways to optimize the lower TF entry include:Additional Entries only if price is moving in our direction (pyramiding) Additional Entries only if price is moving against our direction (averaging) In the H1/M5 example, re-check the Signal every 5 Minutes, the signal in this case will be on the last 12 M5 bars instead of the last H1 bar, (i.e. sort of dynamic signal re-checking).

--- 帖子 #34 ---
​@abokwaik,whats the best xxxJPY pair to trade with?

--- 帖子 #35 ---
GBP JPY

--- 帖子 #36 ---
This is a really nice EA - i like the idea.

one thing i would test is to restrict the max. distance in pips to the daily trend EMA, an overshot is usually rejected fast.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
This is a very interesting strategy.

But I am wondering where shall we put our SL after BUY/SELL?

Is it at the price 24 periods ago?

Or just put SL at last swing high/low.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
The initial idea was to not use a stop loss or take profit, and close the position when signal pairs are out of sync.

However I found it better to have a stop loss and a trailing stop, and allow for trades to open in both directions when signaled, while running trades can be closed at SL or trailing, as long as SL/Trailing are relatively far enough based on the time frame used.

Having the initial SL at swing high/low is not a bad idea as long as it is far enough to allow for price noise. Also sops can be trailed by last high/low.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Yes thodie, Adding a filter on the traded pair should be tested, using standard deviation maybe.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Let us think for a while : Why JPY crosses trend in a specific direction ? why they range for a while? and when do they reverse ?

This is the key to the Yen Trader system!

--- 帖子 #41 ---
So, you are saying the EA hedges? If so, no way to run with US broker.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
No problem, this can be an option to be enabled/disabled.

Currently you can set Max Order to 1, and you're done.

The EA was ONLY made to test the system, NOT to TRADE it.

Trading the system using an EA will come later when system profitability is proved.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
So why GBPJPY trend UP ?

1. GBP is stronger than JPY.

2. USD is stronger than JPY, and USD is weaker than GBP.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
2 Scenarios :

1. GBPUSD trends UP first, and then followed by USDJPY.

2. USDJPY trends UP first, and then followed by GBPUSD.

Which is better for GBPJPY ?

In which scenario GBPJPY will trend UP longer ?

--- 帖子 #45 ---
These questions and MANY others need to be answered before we have a good system.

We are just starting!

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Thanks for the clarification. Will set Max Order to 1 and see how it does when the green flag drops.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
What about the opposite system :

Trading the Major Pair and USDJPY based on the Yen Cross.

So if GBPJPY is trending UP, buy both GBPUSD and USDJPY, wouldn't that be safer ?

--- 帖子 #48 ---
hi, bro, this EA seems working fine since 2016.

but seems losing before 2016.

do you know why?

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Be sure to have the right datas in your platform for the other related pairs. That's important for this EA because it isn't a single pair calculation.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Definitely, if you are backtesting GBPJPY you will need history data also for GBPUSD and USDJPY.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
How far do you want to go back ?

Anyway, please post your testing results, specially the losing ones.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Yes that was my point.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
does strategy tester support multiple-pair trading ?

previously, i remember strategy tester in mt4 is not able to get multiple pair bid and ask

--- 帖子 #54 ---
This EA isn't trading multiple pairs ... It is just using datas from multiple pairs and trade the current pair ... which is fine with backtester.

That was already discussed earlier in the thread ...

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Buying both GBP/USD and USD/JPY is the same thing as buying GBP/JPY..with twice the spread cost.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
This sounds very interesting and worth looking into.

I love FerruFx multi info Indicator. Could this be added if OK with FerruFX

Example =

NZD/USD Strong Up

USD/JPY Strong Up

NZD/JPY Strong Up

So we buy NZD/JPY

Etc Etc. Will try it manually but have little time at the moment.

Awesome idea though.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
More spread but Less risk.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Anyway, for the time being we'll stick to thread main idea : Trading XXXJPY cross based on XXXUSD/USDXXX and USDJPY.

Edit : re-uploaded the EA (MA was not coded).

--- 帖子 #60 ---
I like concepts like these.  Will run some tests.  Thanks Abokwaik

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Look at all the mismatched chart errors, these make your backtests invalid.

Download the correct data set and history in regards to the period you would like to perform the backtest on, otherwise you can keep getting invalid data that either seems great but isn't or the other way around you get backtest results that seem negative but could be profitable.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
I will be going for a 2-week vacation starting tomorrow, so I might not be able to correspond as frequent.

It would be very nice if you guys can run some back/forward tests with different options, on different JPY crosses.

All the best and wish you all consistent profits.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
I know, I am hopeless

I''ll leave the testing for you guys

--- 帖子 #64 ---
This concept is also applicable in other contexts, for example Dow/dollar indexes and forex dollar pairs.  Just a thought....

--- 帖子 #65 ---
True, Good point. This why I left the pair codes selectable. For example you can use it to trade EURAUD based on EURGBP + GBPAUD.  So it can be used as a generic Cross Trader not only a Yen Trader.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
First test, has potential IMO (signal TF 4H)

--- 帖子 #67 ---
One more and then off to dinner. Will test more later. Looks better on high TF, not surprising (signal TF daily). Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Thank You.

No, you need only the Traded Pair (i.e. EURJPY).

Make sure you feed in the Symbol codes as they appear in Terminal's Market Watch (with any prefix/suffix).

Another one, slightly different settings CCI true Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #77 ---
One gets a much higher win rate with the trailing stop of course. As seen here, adding RVI reduces trades somewhat but improves the PF, other tests on CCI indicate it doesn't help too much on this TF anyway. I am seeing consistent decent results with various settings, which is the sign of a sound strategy. Want to test on some other TF and other windows

--- 帖子 #83 ---
General observations thus far on 4H.   Results seem better when using the signal of the current TF (others may try to scalp with this but I think that may be very difficult).  If one does not use a TS you get a much higher PF (lower win rate), but a greater draw down (the indicators may help here somewhat, have to test more, but I am concerned about curve fitting with the indicators - I like systems with only a few variables).  With the TS, the win rate is very high, with a lower DD, at the expense of profits (but easier to trade from an emotional standpoint).  Need to test more on the daily to see how that looks, but I suspect it will look good.  On the 4H, I could see trading this on lower lots across maybe two or three uncorrelated pairs.  Will post more test results if everyone wants, keeping in mind that these back tests do not really mean too much. I only back test to confirm the concept on different samples.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Implemented Abokwaiks trigger section into "my" expert base as it contains already many additions and different exit variants so it was easier to add and test his trigger section.

This is basically the Abokwaik YEN-Trader Verison 3.

addition to his trigger i added the daily trend EMA 288 on 5min chart as entry filter (see post#36 as reference), the price must be in a defined area near the EMA to trigger.

Exit is a bit different:

If there is only one position open it is trailed until stop hit or a counter signal appears.

If 2 or more positions are open the expert exits on "the other side of the EMA.

not fully finished yet but did some tests with averaging, semi martingale and finally got this mix, please note, it will also close with a loss when conditions are met.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Very Interesting System!

My brain is at full speed, I thing I will also code this system...

--- 帖子 #86 ---
if you backtest from 2012 - 2016, you will find it's always losing until late 2015.

I am pretty sure i have the complete data sets.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
It's fascinating to watch this EA in visual mode. I've attached some screen-shots that show extremely accurate

entries, but I wonder if there isn't something else going on, here. The fact that I'm not getting very many stop-outs

makes me wonder if my backtests are flawed. Modelling is 90%, so, perhaps, that's why my tests don't mimic

what I've seen from nonlinear's results.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Been playing around with not using the TS - using the indicators does reduce the DD.  Really not too bad for 3% risk.  Will load some older data to test on these settings later.  Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #89 ---
I'm using v.03, which doesn't have indicator options. I ran a bunch of backtests with, and without, a TS, and

the tests run with a TS were far superior. YMMV.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
What are your thoughts on max orders?  Better to use more orders with less lots or less orders with more lots?  I have been using max of one primarily because of US brokers.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
I have tested both max orders 10 and max orders 1. For max orders 1, I just multiply the lots by 10 so each trade is .1 instead of .01. Either one returns about the exact performance and draw down

I ran a bunch of test from the period jan 1 2015 thru current (aprox 1.5 years).  I have run on 1 hour and 5 minute charts. Have not done 4 hour charts yet. Its late so Im not going to post all the reports but in summary: None of the indicator options work very well. They all hurt performance except using the MA option which does not improve or hurt performance more than a few $ over the test.

Trailing stop: Hurts performance by quite a bit in almost all the tests I ran.  It does reduce the draw downs a bit but IMO its not worth it. The highest was DD was 16% not using the trailing stop. Using the trailing, the DD was usually around 6-10%  but returns were sometimes 50% lower so not worth it.  I can post up some of the tests tomorrow but one of the best was on 1 hour chart using no trailing stop. 38% gain with a max DD of 12%. Modding quality on my tester is around 90% so not sure how accurate all the test really are.

The base settings for tp and sl are pretty good and yielded  good results. I tried higher and lower tp/sl settings and none were better than the original EA settings. One other thing I noticed was 2016 has been good.  Early 2015 is when most of the DD took place but from late 2015 into this year this ea really made hay. So it may be worthwhile to run tests on past years or longer time frames to see just how good it is.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
I cut max orders to 5, due to margin percentage hitting pretty low numbers during trades. My demos did great last night, which yielded around 10% return.

However, that was with max orders at 10, which pushed margin way too hard. So far, I'm liking what I'm seeing.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Agree on this. I am not going to bail on the TS yet. With fixed TP targets it might only do well when the pair is trending.  Also, using the indicators reduces profits because it is taking less trades, but those trade look like better entries.  That is why it may make sense to trade with the indicators on multiple uncorrelated pairs, which will make for more trades and hopefully balance out returns as well.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Congratulation abokwaik , very good EA.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
it is a trader preference, but RSI and/or RVI true, less trade, better entries. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Ran it on 2014-2015 with basic 1:3 RR on 4H no TS -- it still made decent gains. Same settings on AUDCAD 4H not so great PF .93 with only 19 trades

Not bad for one day.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
how are you trading that Rob?  5M with TS?  What is your trigger TF?

--- 帖子 #100 ---
H1 EA input, on a M5 chart, with TS. Pretty much OOTB, except LookBackBars=2, and MaxOrders=5.

I'm a U.S. trader, so the 50:1 leverage is something that has to be carefully considered, with regard

to margin. I also had to cut my lot size from .1 to .05. This is probably still too aggressive for 50:1,

$2000 balance.

I thank nonlinear  & ChicagoRob for sharing their tests, maybe they can help with that.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
I am still running a few tests on current history on different TF's and will look at older data later. I suspect that the TP and SL levels will require some adjustment based on the current conditions (ATR), but that is difficult and time-consuming to analyze with so many variables. Fixed stop and take profit levels can be problematic. As for now, I am trying to settle on a desired TF, desired WR and RR, and range of MA that work well, without curve fitting too much.

Currently, I am liking 5 min, hour trigger, SL range 1750-2250, TP range 2000-3000, TS range 1000-1500, SMA range 60-100 ish, with everything set such that the TS is less pips than the SL, and the TP is more pips than the SL. I am still testing though and its is slow going. Of course, there are many ways to trade this system, depending on your frame of mind. I personally shoot for RR over 1.1 and WR above 55, but that is not easy to maintain.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Hi, Abokwaik,

Sorry by the question. Some guys do that, but thank you for share!

I'm testing here and later I'll post the results. My broker is (pepperstone) and I'm trying to test from dates before 2016 using a 1 hour timeframe but the strategy tester only loads M5 and M1 data from 2016. Can someone help me to get more quotes? The metaquotes.net data is trustworthy?

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Further to my last post, if my testing pans out, then I might be interested in modifying the EA to include the following option (this change would basically make the TP, SL, and TS levels responsive to current market conditions, while also being testable in MT4).

1.  Track ATR at a user input TF and user input period (e.g., daily ATR at 14).

2.  User sets the desired range for four ATR Bins.  For example:

ATR Bin 1 if ATR < 2

ATR Bin 2 if ATR between 2-3

ATR Bin 3 if ATR between 3-4

ATR Bin 4 is ATR > 4

3.  The expert can then determines which bin the current ATR falls in

4.  Then the expert sets the SL, TP, and TS based on the determined Bin as follows:

5.  User inputs a bin multiplier for each Bin:

Bin 1: multplierB1

Bin 2: multiplierB2

Bin 3: multiplierB3

Bin 4: multiplierB4

6.  Expert sets the SL pips according to the bin multiplier:

SL = ATR *  multiplerB1
6.  Expert sets the TP pips and TS pips according to the calculated SL pips and a user input TPmultipler and user input TSmultiplier:

TP = SL pips * SLmultipler  TS = SL pips * TSmultipler

The above allows the expert to trade at a desired RR that adjusts to current market conditions (roughly).  I am not yet certain if the above makes sense for this system, but plan to evaluate it -- my gut reaction is that the SL/TP/TS levels for when the daily Geppy ATR is below 2 should be different than, for example, when it is above 4.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
imho backtest are just to verify if the trigger is sufficient, as soon as you start with TP / SL optimizing you are just curve fitting which means in a defined period the results gets better in other periods they get worse. This won´t work in long term.

To me it would make more sense to focus on entry and exit trigger sharpening of this really good basic trigger.

Rob, are you getting any errors in your fxcm logs when the TS kicks in?

Good question, nonlinear. I'll take a look at my journal when I get home from work.

Help needed. I have read all seven pages. Twice
no one else seems to be complaining, so it must be me.
I have loaded the EA yen-trader-04 into the expert folder.
I have closed down by mt 4 and reloaded it.
I have put the EA on GBPJPY 5M chart and I've got a happy face.
Trouble is, it does not open any trades.
Any help much appreciated.
THANK YOU

redfan, you have the indicators all true - it takes a rare and special set of events for an entry signal to occur on the H1 with those settings.  If you let it run long enough then it should eventually take a trade.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Thank you.
I have turned them all to false. I will give that a try.
Once I get it working. I can start testing it and can catch up to you guys

Ok, the TS is not working properly for me, so I am not testing with that feature anymore.  Basic system with 1:3 RR over two years, no filters.

Hi,

I am still a bit uncertain about the actual signal of the EA...

Look back bars # : This determines what the EA compares the current price against for all three pairs?

i.e; 2 look back bars on D1 test compares current price against price 2 days ago? And this should be the same as 48 look back bars on 1H test?

In this post, you refer to a switch point. How does the EA actually determine this switch point?

Very promising tho!

Im wondering if this has something to do with JPY pairs (sort of risk-on / risk-off) or is general just between major / crosses

Best,

--- 帖子 #145 ---

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Did you read post #125?

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Very nice test Rob.  Have you had any fifo/hedge issues (opposite signal while a trade is open - I am in the US like you)?  Also, did you have a chance to check the journal for TS errors?  I have my first trade open on the 4H.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Ok, I read.  Thank you

--- 帖子 #149 ---
No fifo/hedge issues as of late. Also, haven't seen any journal errors

nice EA with very smart aproach.

but have some bugs in some conditions.trailing doesnt work properly even if the double of pips have been made TS was set to 1000 points,some orders are closed at BE.

also i hope many of you here know that all this ''tester'' results are just dreams.the only can say more about is to add it in a demo and let it run few weeks at least in ''real market'' to open and close trades.mt4 tester is a crap and say VERY different things comparing with real market conditions same as mt4 at some point.

cheers!

--- 帖子 #151 ---
I have been testing over some older time frames and the expert does not do so well with setting that work on today's markets, as others have observed.  Of course this is expected, but trying to figure out when and why is very difficult....

It seems that on few occasions the stop is not trailed after break even points where those trades get closed at BE wasting huge profits. I will check the code and update for next week, probably with ATR levels included as well.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Suppose you want to trade EURJPY cross,  you attach the EA to EURJPY   chart on the time frame that you like to trade (entry timeframe) which could be equal or less than the signal timeframe input, then you set the major pair as EURUSD and the UJ pair as USDJPY and the cross pair as EURJPY. With adding any prefix/suffix as appear in your market watch.Then you setup other inputs SL, TP ,,, etc as you wish.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Yes, I'm in the same position two days and it's not open one trade.
I have copied  the EA yen-trader-4 into my expert folder.
I have closed my MT4.
I have opened it and pulled yen-trader-4 onto my chart.
I have clicked allow auto trading and gotten happy face on my chart.
I have changed some of the settings from true to false. And it still doesn't work.
The question I have do you put the EA on all three charts.
Thank you.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Best is, you make a screenshot of your properties, expert tab and journal tab, else nobody can help you properly

--- 帖子 #164 ---
1. Make sure pair names are exactly as they appear in you terminal. 2. EA will open trades only when all conditions set in the inputs are met.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Sorry. Edited.  Yes got some trades.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
There are no pending stop/limit orders, only market orders on one chart for the traded pair (e.g. GBPJBY,EURJPY, AUDJPY. . etc.)

--- 帖子 #167 ---
redfan if your broker uses a suffix (for example USDJPYtt instead of just USDJPY), then you have to include the suffix in the inputs to the expert

you have turned on EMA filter which might reduce trade frequency

--- 帖子 #171 ---
How do I turn it off. Where do I find it?

--- 帖子 #172 ---
If your ecn does not allow setting stops/targets simultaneously with market orders, that could be the reason.

Some ecn terminals allow that and some don't allow.

The current EA was made just to test the trading system, and was not meant for live trading.

Now I can see the potential, so I am going to develop a professional version, which will include:

1. Validation of user inputs.

2. Information Display.

3. ECN account option.

4. Slippage and Spread controls.

5. Error Handling with friendly messages.

6. Hedging Option.

7. Additional oprions (ATR based levels, traded pair filters ... etc).

My deep thanks and appreciation goes to all who participated in this thread, specially nonlinear and ChicagoRob.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
You can turn off the MA filter by setting its period to 0

Is this possible?

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Yes, it is possible, but the above results are "tricky". Why?

The initial deposit was $100 while the maximum ABSOLUTE DD was $251.96, which means that if you had started the backtest on the day of the max. DD, the backtest would have resulted in a total loss of the $100 account on the very first day.

In other words: when fixed lots are used in backtests, the absolute DD is much more informative than the relative (%) DD.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
. It's all temporary and relative. Try it in 2012 when volume dropped

--- 帖子 #183 ---
But absolute DD was $8.25. It's "Rebaixamento absoluto" field. $251.96 was relative DD. It's "Rebaixamento relativo" field.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
I understand this system in page 1

I not understand how EA work,

my question, at result  backtest why DD avarage big DD,

in running backtest i look , some open position long time for closing position.

will better please system make DD low. and change system for hold running position.

I am sorry just ny suggest, I not understand about coding, and how work inside EA

--- 帖子 #185 ---
The $8.25 absolute DD refers to the DD from the initial $100 deposit, which means only that the equity has not dropped below $91.75.

Looking at the numbers closer, the "Rebaixamento absoluto", i.e. the Absolute DD was $324 which means that it was about 3.2x larger than the initial $100 deposit. In other words, it was only due to "lucky timing" of the backtested period that the accumulated profits managed buffer the $324 DD and so a total loss was avoided.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Yes. You're rigth. But look at the low investiment. One can try spending $100 two or three times. Due to this if one have $1000 this can come true. What do u think?

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Well no system will work in all market types I guess. Any clues as to how / when it performs well and when it perform bad?

If we could identify this it can easily be filtered out right?

Best,

--- 帖子 #188 ---
I had some spare time, so I ran this backtest just for shits and giggles. $2K to $62K in three months.

M15 signal on M1 chart. Latest version with fixed TS. Completely insane to watch in visual mode.

25% is the best MT4 can normally do on M1, so I'm sure the test would be a lot different on 99% data,

But, what the hell, we can dream, can't we?

--- 帖子 #189 ---
I bet you can't wait to forward test this next week Rob

--- 帖子 #190 ---
You read my mind. Forward test begins at market open, Sunday. I expect total failure, but demos are

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Hi Rob,

Tried your settings on AUDJPY:

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Not bad - good to see a test on 99%. Can you run the same test on the default pairs?

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Theoretically everything is possible, however, using M15 for backtests gives very inaccurate results (not to mention higher timeframes) as MT4 just makes "intelligent guesses" for entry/exit prices within each 15 minutes candle, and as we know many very different price movement combinations can happen within even similarly shaped M15 candles.

So to get the closest estimates for what an EA would have done in the past is running it on M1 timeframe and for the longest possible periods (3-4 years at least).

This was a PM from bishopdotun:

my comments in Red.

Hi Abokwaik,

Thank you for all the work on Yen Trader. This is a smart EA indeed.

Here is my request:
- Add Breakeven at Y pips (e.g BE at 20pips in profit) ---> OK
- Add Breakeven + Xpips option ( i.e At BE lock Xpips) ---> Would this be different from Trailing Stop ?

* Please I need a clarification. The exit criteria described in the first post. Is it still valid in the V4 or has it changed? ---> No it is not used. Exit is now by SL,TS or TP.

* Please explain how the Trailing Stop works in the EA
- Trailing Stop: 200 (At 20 pips, the trailing stop is activated and price is moved to BE)
- Trailing Stop Shift: 10 (The stop will now trail the price by every pip movement in trade direction keeping a 20 pips distance)

Is my explanation of the trailing sop logic correct? This is what I expect it to do. ---> Correct.

You can reply this in the thread if you like but I don't want to clog the thread with unnecessary questions. Looking forward to your response. Thank you very much.

Regards.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
System's  basic idea is as described in post 1 except for exit when XXXUSD and USDJPY change direction which was replaced by a hedge.  Modifications were added as with any system, including optional filtering.

EDIT: as for DD, it can be controlled by lot size, SL,TS and max orders.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
We agree that XXXJPY trends while XXXUSD and USDJPY move in same direction.  Does XXXJPY range  while XXXUSD and USDJPY move in opposite direction ? My guess is yes. Would that period be suitable for a ranging system using BB or an oscillator buying low and selling high ? My guess is also yes. We'll come to that later.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Add Breakeven + Xpips option ( i.e At BE lock Xpips) ---> Would this be different from Trailing Stop ?

Yes. This is different.

This works if I don't want to trail the price but I just want to lock Xpips and let the price run till TP or hit the BE point.

Addition:

* No Hedge option: If buy trades are running and a sell signal is generated, let EA close all open buy trades and open the new sell trade.

If set to true, system will close all opposing trades before opening a counter trade. If set to false then the EA will hedge trades.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
* profit lock ---> OK.* Hedging Option ---> Already scheduled for next release.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
that no hedge option is really a close on opposite option.  No hedge would mean do not take an opposite order until the current trade(s) in the other direction are closed.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Not too big a fan of a TS, but it works sometimes. One can see how the early part of this test would have benefited from different TP/SL settings likely. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

My test was run with the 34MA set to 0(deactivated). Would you mind running one more without the 34MA, just to see if there is an overall improvement?

I know my results are not very realistic with 90% modeling, but I'm going to test it out, anyway.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Thanks. However inputs and period are not the same.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
OK, 34MA = 0 and period extended 1 day to match original.

Only diference should be that I'm using spread=10 and comm=5.23 instead of the original spread 20.

Same but for 15 months instead of 3 months:

I'm trying different settings but nothing that give good results so far.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Thanks for taking the time to run these tests. It's apparent my settings don't work out very well on 99% data. I'm going

to run a demo for M15 signal/M1 chart and compare to my current H1 signal/M5-15 demos(which are doing very well).

--- 帖子 #208 ---
I dont understand entry...

EURUSD is up, USDJPY is up then buy EURJPY... but there can come correction..

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Hi ChicagoRob.  Under entry type input what did you chose : Pyramiding , Averaging or Both?... Entry on M1 tf will create too many transactions that make the spread/commissions hard to overcome.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
I tested on M1 as well.  The account usually hits 0. But i don't trust MT4 on M1.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Hi Guys here's my backtest to add to the mix

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Hi, abokwaik. I used "Both" for the input. I noticed, though, that Pyramiding yielded less profits, but had lower DD.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Hi I am reading your methods and I understand that if USD JPY AND GBP USD IF BOTH IS GOING UP THAT MEANS THAT GBP JPY WILL ALSO GO UP BUT PLEASE EXPLAIN IN DETAILS THE TIMING WHEN IF BOTH IS GOING UP SHOULD I ENTER THE TRADE

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Usually GBPUSD and USDJPY move in different directions.Entry time is the time when they both move in same direction  on the Signal time frame using one or combination of directional methods (previous number of bars, moving average, RSI .. etc.).

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Version 5 (with all discussed options except info.display ) is almost complete. I will run few validation tests and hopefully post today.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
what do you mean by saying previous numbers of bars  as I understand you need to look on current  bars  not previous because previous is something in the past please explain with arrows and chart

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Previous number of bars is the value you enter in Loop Back Bars input. Current price is compared to the price that was at previous number of bars to determine if current price is up or down. In Version 4 the current price must be higher/lower than the highest/lowest price within previous number of bars (i.e. breakout). In version 5 I provided a selectable option to either use high/low price (as in v4) or simply use the Close Price (new in v5).

I played a little bit with the settings of YEN Trader. M15 signal on M1 chart. This is the test result for the last 6 weeks with variable lots as 2 % of balance: It starts with 500 $ to 1 million. I know this is not so realistic, but it looks very good. I think YEN trader has a lot of potential, but realistic results are only with forward testing feasible.

Thx

--- 帖子 #260 ---
What implemented for variable lot size is a balance percentage not risk percentage. The equation uses the required margin which depends on leverage. So if your leverage is high the calculated lot size will be high. I didn't implement risk based MM because SL is optional. I will have a second look at MM in future releases.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
I don't understand this combination : GBPUSD,GBPAUD,GBPJPY  ???

--- 帖子 #262 ---
XYZ Trader is on the way. ☺

--- 帖子 #263 ---
With regard to your martingale question : the system provides three re-entry options : Pyramiding (antimartingale ), Averaging (martingale ) or both (every bar). But this only applicable when Trading TF is less than Signal TF AND entry signal from signal pairs is still valid AND open trades is less than max orders.

Version 05 is very cool! Started testing. Seeing OrderModify error 130 when using ATR option, but I have to play with the settings more to see where the issue might lie.  EDIT:  I believe the issue was my fault as I did not have enough history for the ATR calculation.  My bad.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Question: Am I correct that if close on opposite is set true, then the expert will (i) close the current trade AND (ii) then open the opposite trade?

Question: If we use the ATR multiplier, should we set the TP to 0?  And if we do not want to use the ATR on the TS, BE or PL functions, can we just set those to 0 in the ATR variables?

Yes.

If you chose to enable ATR levels then pip levels are not used, so it is not necessary to make them 0.

I will also check once I get back home.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
But what is the pip basis for the multipliers?  The input SL in pips?

--- 帖子 #276 ---
350 points at least seems OK for GJ. However TS highly depends on the time frame.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
That's awesome - maybe I should go for a straight TP and forget the TS.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
One thought:  If this version with ATR is multiplying off the raw ATR, then than will occasionally result in abnormally large SL and TP levels, which is not desirable.  ts good to have dynamic SL TP levels, but they have to controlled within a reasonable range.  We may need the bins to avoid this, but I will look at it further.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
It's good to test both.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
as your analysis, will USD/JPY drop till below 100 soon?

--- 帖子 #281 ---
No. It uses the ATR on the ATR time frame and period selected. So for example your signal TF could be H1 and trading tf M15 while your ATR tf is on H4. So suppose H4 ATR (21) = 650 points. If you set SL ATR to 2 then your SL will be 1300 points (130 pips), same concept applies for other levels (TP, TS, BE ... etc) using the multiplier you enter for each level.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
One more thing.  For some systems(perhaps this one), it can be critical to allow the trade to continue until it hits the full SL or the full TP.  The close on opposite function prevents that from happening.  Is there some combination of settings that will ignore new opposite entry signals until an existing trade is closed out?

--- 帖子 #283 ---
No body is doing any analysis here. It's pure mechanical trading using recent price action on multiple pairs.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Yes. Set close on opposite to false and set hedging to false.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Thanks, nice work here!

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Hi there. Nice work!

I am also testing.

I have a question:

How to prevent multiple orders almost same price level.

Is there any other option than change MAX ORDER input.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
looking for; Max open trades; just change it from default at 10 to the number you want.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Thanks for your reply but my question is: Is there any other option than change MAX ORDER input?

--- 帖子 #289 ---
"Min distance between orders" input to be added in next release.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Yes, trade on a higher TF.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Quick test, not sure what is going on with shorts. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Yep, no shorts.   Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Opps !!

--- 帖子 #294 ---
It will be great.

Thank you!

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Yes, it seems to not take shorts unless close on opposite is true.  But decent results for only taking longs, potential here.   Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #296 ---
This is one option but it will not prevent it for sure.

The best option is to add input "Min distance between orders" as abokwaik reply.

Thank you!

--- 帖子 #297 ---
On this input, can we used a fixed minimum and fixed maximum for the ATR - I think that would address my concern.  For example, the current ATR for GJ is skewed too high because of the brexit move.  If we base trades off that ATR, then the SL and TP will be way too large.

--- 帖子 #298 ---

Has anybody test the strategy using only the first rulesIf XXXUSD is UP and USDJPY is UP --> BUY XXXJPY. EXIT when either XXXUSD is DOWN or USDJPY is DOWN. If XXXUSD is DOWN and USDJPY is DOWN --> SELL XXXJPY. EXIT when either XXXUSD is UP or USDJPY is UP without using the ATR rule and with out the 24 hours back rule?.

i check it with a few trade s and goes really good .

I am gona check it using excel .

Agreed.

Hi, I do not think the SL is working, i set to 10, and it does not get activated.

Thank you all for testing the Yen Trader.

It would be easier and quicker for me to fix any found errors if you post the following:EA version Input Settings (an image of settings or the set file). Note to post the set file, choose save on the inputs screen and enter a file name, then compress the file using winrar/winzip or change the file extention to .txt instead of .set which is not uploadable on FF.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Dear nonlinear,

The minimum for "Loop Back Bars" in v5 is 2 (was 1 in v4 and earlier).

This change was made as we are actually comparing the price at x loop back bars with closed price (i.e. previous bar which is bar 1), so it was meaningless to compare the a bar with itself.

This change is what made the EA in your test to open only buy trades, as you set loop back bars to 1, in which case buy and sell are set to true, but since you allowed only 1 order at a time by setting max orders to 1, and since buy is called before sell order, the EA executed buy orders only.

I will add a validation on this input in future releases.

Thank you for all your efforts in developing this system.

All the best,

Khalil

--- 帖子 #311 ---
ahh, that explains it.  Thanks Khalil, back to more testing.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Thanks.

This is not the latest version posted (which is Yen_Trader_05).

This is probably Yen_Trader_04 or Yen_Trader_04_TS.

Are you using an ECN account ? because versions prior to 5 do not have an ECN option.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Helo Abokwaik,

today i have started a forward test on YEN Trader 0.5 with James T setting m1 chart - M15 signal trading on these pairs: GBPJPY,EURJPY AUDJPY; CHFJPY, EURAUD, EURCHF, EURGBP.

955 pips is more then i hoped for.

This ea can build profit very fast, also down the road is a open trades issue with negative value, i see one solution for this that after making some % on account, all open trades be closed if profit is bigger then a dd and call it for a day.

I have a question. If i use for all the pairs i trade a same magic number will that affect a closing trades mechanism or logic?

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Unbelievable !   that's over 60% in one day !

No its OK, you can use same magic on different pairs, but not  on the same pair.

If you want to trade the EA on same pair with different settings, different time frame , you need  to give it a new magic number, otherwise its OK.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
I am a bit surprised since ea was scalping very fast. I am eager to see what will happen with open orders during the night. Anyway good work Abokwaik, it was a pleasure watching ea taking profits...almost as ILAN ea is resurrected and started being profitable

It would be interesting in some of next versions to have an options to choose a pair which we want to trade in a settings, and ea would automatically set a combination of a other two pairs in settings(i know its a long shot)...Some dashboard version for the guys who like to trade with bigger number of pairs would be more then appreciated.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Keep in mind, on M1 if you are shooting for 5000 TP, then the EA is still looking for relatively big moves and performance will vary accordingly. It will be very interesting to see how the EA works truly scalping on M1 with smaller targets (a few pips over the spread).

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Hi Abokwaik,

Today test on YEN Trader 0.4 with M1 chart - M15 signal trading real cent account on these pairs: GBPJPY, GBPUSD, AUDJPY, NZDUSD, EURUSD. USDJPY.

Today was a easy day for this kind EA. Market stayed hard in same direction.

See set file and detailed statement.

Hi, a question

What is the best time frame on which to work this EA?

--- 帖子 #322 ---
The settings you shared was of version 4 not 5. Anyway since you have ECN account, Enable the ECN option in v5 by setting it to true and you'll be fine.

Using it for forward testing on ICMarkets Demo server now.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
So if I wanted to trade .. let's say EUR/JPY, do I just need to open up EURJPY and place the EA there, OR do I need to open Eur/usd, USD/JPY AND EUR/JPY. (Same with all other yen pairs)?

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Hi Rob,

would you mind if you can link your a/c to myfxbook or fxblue so we can monitor and compare the forward testing?

That would help all traders here.

Thank you

--- 帖子 #330 ---
I have found the same issue, and running on same broker, make sure that you select ECN=True if your account is ECN.

But i do suspect that SL is not working.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
I am focused on higher TF for now and am just testing the basic features. Here is the core system over four years compounding just using the ATR based SL and TP. There is a window here that would have been difficult to trade (on 3%). Back to testing. EDIT, I don't think the ATR-based TS, BE, and PL are working properly as my test results are nearly identical with and without using those features.  Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #332 ---

Thanks Isam. I believe the Signal time frame is H1 and trading frame M5, right ?

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Thanks for sharing this useful EA.

I have a short query whether selection TF will make a difference for EA to place an order.

In demo account, there is most likely the same in opening orders (around 11-12 GMT) for both M1 chart/ M5 signals for EJ + CHFJPY and M5 chart/H1 signals for GJ + NJ.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
hi can you post your setting?

--- 帖子 #338 ---
I never look for a get-rich formula in forex.

Let's get realistic.

20% monthly roi is more than I hope for with any mechanical trading system.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Entry tf makes a difference if you set max orders > 1.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Thank you nonlinear for your testing on the 4hr TF...  While you are applying the EA to the 4hr chart, in the EA settings what Signal timeframe have you set?  4 hrs?

--- 帖子 #341 ---
This is another concept for another day and I am talking out loud here, but to really scalp with this, it might work well where the SL/TP are based on the spread at entry (e.g., spread is 3, and SL and TP are thus 6 or something like that), the price deviation between the primary pairs, and the hour of day.  Would run the expert on a week of live M1 (or preferably smaller) bars on the three pairs, analyze the price deviations, analyze every potential entry at different tight SL/TP levels based on the spread, track the hour of day) and then trade off those results while the expert continues to analyze live ticks to repeat the process.  Just a another complicated scalping thought for another day and not meant for Mt4, sigh  lol

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Yup I've selected that too. I even played around w some other settings but the SL still doesnt work so I've reverted back to version 4 for the forward testing for now.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Yes, all 4H.  Keep in mind that this approach still need some tweaking and will likely be safer and have better results after we set the max and min ATR levels.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
I have the same problem. only tp is ok. not sure what is the matter.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Very well said, 20% to 30% monthly roi is enough... unless your broker is fully STP/ECN. TRUE. Not self proclaimed.

if your broker found that you are very profitable, they will probably hate you ... then be ready to possible freezed of your withdrawal request etc.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Please post your settings and I will look into the issue.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
You are using a 1 pip stop?  Try 10 pips (100).

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Thanks for your fantastic work on this ea, Khalil!

I've seen a pretty hefty DD forward testing 1 min/15 min (-$420 with 0.1 lot size, RVI filter on, max open trades = 1).

I'm wondering if we could test a version which requires an even higher TF to be in alignment in order for a signal to be generated,

such as perhaps the 1 hour alignment necessary for the 1 min/15 min?

Whether this is practical to be included or not, don't know. Just a thought.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
redfan, you have the expert on the wrong chart.  You have to load it on GJ to trade GJ.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
I noticed that he ended pair codes with a comma, which is not part of pair names

Looking at our friend(s) got loss in real account, I wonder whether this EA opens trade only when there is a big spike.

Hi fredrick,

What pair did you use to backtest? Can you post/pm the set file? Thanks

--- 帖子 #382 ---
I would highly suggest you to not do so. That's not a good idea to go LIVE with an EA in developement.

Forward DEMO is the way to go until EA is confirmed working correctly.

I did not plan in jumping into a live real account. what i meant was Demo Live!!!

Balance.  See post 261.Close all on Max Drawdown % input can be added.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
hi fred, can you post your myfxbook link?

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Wish I could but I didn't save that setting. Been battling to get it right since last ngiht

--- 帖子 #394 ---
One neat trick I did was to turn on ATR and used default which is 1 Day. One Day was good but when I tested 1month,fewer trades but my oh my.

I try to remember some but turn of Hedging, Set ATR to true(1 DAT), Look Back Pip (20), Signal TF (M15) and run on M1 gbpjpy. That's all I remember.

But I will be sure to post the setting when I get it right

--- 帖子 #395 ---
I see, ok that works fine when you have 1 pair to trade but its creating a mess when you trade more then 1. For example i have put a full throttle on the forward account just to see what damage reckless investing could do.

Balance jumped in one day from 300 to 800. But equity was on 300 on some moment. Ea was opening 0.08 lots of orders which was a pure suicide at that moment.

I had to intervene and kill some biggest lot size orders.

From this reason i think that its much safer for account that ea reads equity instead of balance.

Close on All on % DD is also good option.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Balance is better for Pyramiding, Equity is better for Averaging option.

Variable lot size  is suitable for testing.

In real life I prefer fixed lot size, which can be manually  increased when balance (with no open orders) reach certain level(s).

--- 帖子 #397 ---
I don't know about you guys, but I would never trade such a system on M1, with max order enabled.

Transaction cost on M1 can kill best systems. so be aware.

Even M5 is dangerous imho.

The minimum I can think of is M15 as an entry tf.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
abokwaik

i think you are right, I am demoing on M5 but only 1000 point TP, but i think the signal would be more consistent on higher TF.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Hi thodie,  I linked you TE of Yen Trader to the thread this morning. However  30% a day is much more than I can handle :o.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
I think unifying the SL/TS when multiple trades are running would be a good option to minimise the risk.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Encountered no errors so far. Lot size is high, but imho thats what demo forward is for. Testing the borders.

Here is the setfile:

--- 帖子 #402 ---
I think that is a excellent idea , with 7 trading pairs usually there is a 30 + orders open. Controlling all of them together if the same magic number is involved is good solution

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Me too. I did some tests here increasing manually and it's fine!

--- 帖子 #404 ---
I see TE closed @49% daily return !

In real life I would call it a day,  a week or even a month , pack my bags and go on vacation.

You are a superstar when it comes to coding.

Nice having you here in this thread.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
true, excellent result but we should not forget it was during GBP news event - which was an advantage for the trailing stop close, exit was near the high.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Of course.  Did you stop the EA as I don't see any new open trades ?

--- 帖子 #408 ---
no intervention from my side, if it doesn´t open a trade it´s due to the set file.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Dumb luck or not, two winners on the core system and the account is up 6.2% for the week on this 4H test of v4. After Khalil releases the next version, I will begin testing out of sample windows and different pairs. I see many here want to test on lower TF, but I favor higher TF, less orders, larger order size, and more pairs, if possible. The streaks up (and down) on lower TF will be more dramatic, but maybe I will look at that closer after settling on higher TF. Attached Image

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Great. That what I wanted to hear.

GBPUSD + USDJPY = GBPJPY right.

Also ...

GBPAUD + AUDJPY = GBPJPY

GBPNZD + NZDJPY = GBPJPY

GBPCAD + CADJPY = GBPJPY

GBPCHF + CHFJPY = GBPJPY

GBPEUR  + EURJPY = GBPJPY

so why trade GBPJPY by looking at only 2 pairs , while we can trade it based on 12 pairs ?!

Same approach can be applied to any pair.

Generalising that,

GBPJPY = GBPXXX + XXXJPY . where XXX represents any/all other currencies.

Generalising that further,

XZ = XY + YZ. where X,Y,Z represents any currency.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
I started live trading on a small real $ account.

I am using ea version Yen_Trader_04_TS on NZD/JPY today.

Looks good so far....

The 3 sell orders have triggered within the last 2 hours

ea placed on 30 minute chart, 1 hour signal time frame

Major Pair Code NZD/USD

Dollar Yen Pair Code USD/JPY

Yen Cross Pair Code NZD/JPY

3 max orders

1000 Stop loss ( which is really 100)

3000 TP (which is really 300)

Trailing stop 300

Trail Stop Shift 30

--- 帖子 #417 ---
looking at 12 pair could be interesting - but i am worried how we action if half of 12 pairs says buy buy half says sell.

basically, 12 pair might contradict with each other..

need to think about..

--- 帖子 #418 ---
I think adding a currency meter as signal filter will be good too.

In cases: NZDUSD,USDJPY,NZDJPY.

For buy: NZD is strong

USD is weak

JPY is strong

Means we NZDUSD is ranging, USDJPY is ranging too, automatically means JPY is strong too. So we buy NZDJPY.

Correct me if I'm wrong even though their is no trusted currency meter out there.

Secondly Abokwaik, could you please make the ea autocalculate the lowest lot size to be used if we  decide to use the Variable lot function. This would help us not to test till we find the right risk setting. Thanks

Also,great ea and great concept.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Because GJ is driven overwhelmingly by two primary currencies (pairs) as are most crosses, which is why the "divergence" if you will of the primary pairs might give the edge we hope to see here. The other crosses are just following along with their primary pairs (usually). Not discouraging it, but if you start adding in every G and J pair, you might get the equivalent of currency strength, which has proven difficult to trade an edge off of, for some at least here and on other forums. I am more intrigued, for example, trading UJ off of other primary drivers, like dollar index and nikkei index, or S&P/DJ and nikkei.  Edit: Easy to get the historical data, but just asked fxcm if I can even get the feeds for indices and commodities to trade this theory in the US.  All of you outside the US are lucky lol

My previous post was actually a strength meter.

If all GX are up and all XJ are up, G is the strongest and J is the weakest.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Hi Abokwaik,

Thank you for your sharing.

I had just back tested the 05_1 version on GJ.

TF was 15M, and I used your default setting (haven't changed anything yet).

I received the "Order move to BE Modify Error: invalid stops" error repeatedly.

Could you give me a hint? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
1. I'm willing to guess lower trade frequency, the logic will need a lot of stuff to line up before trading..but you could probably compensate by trading several pairs simultaneously and not only GJ.

2. Higher Latency, You might be getting in much later than youre doing now; though I'm not sure if that is necessarily a bad thing...except when the EA gets in just before price reverses the other way.

i made today real money 550 0.1 lot

--- 帖子 #424 ---
What do you guys think is a good account size for this expert for .01 lot ?

--- 帖子 #425 ---
hi abokwaik, i think of an idea. total profit lock function, for example just lock 1 USD of all orders, in case the price reverse back and hit the sl. can you add this to the ea?

sorry for my bad eaglish but i hope you understand what i mean.

i mean the float number in the bottom right corner of mt4. if it below 1 usd, close all order. useful?

now i think that is not a good idea.

Hi there

Could anyone help me,

I have had this EA on my chart for over 24 hours.

It as not open any trades whatsoever.

I got a smiley face on the chart and everything is ticked for auto trade,

Please  have a look at the video. If you can see anything wrong

Can you please tell me. Thank you,

Would you please share your set file and which time-frame that you are using now?

Thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #429 ---
My idea was to trade a pair based on related 12 pairs. I didnt define entry/exit rules yet. Sure, waiting for all pairs to line up would be late specially on short tfs. Different alternatives need to be tested.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Hi,

What TF you're using in the demo?

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Abokwaik. I once tried to code similar thought process.

The basic idea was: For any timeframe if GJ up by X pips, GBPj = +X pips, also for GBPNZD if down by Y pips GBPn = -Y pips and so on for all the major currency pairs. Then I sum all the GBPx and get a Pip Value (pip strength). This is done for all currency pairs. I didn't test the logic in strategy tester though (unaware if other pair data could be used).

The coding is crude (a software was used) the EA does not trade, it only shows the strengths. I will post it with your permission or I can email to you.

P.S: I forgot to include forward demo a/c details:

Of course my friend,  you can share any thing related to the subject.The account you shared is it for Yen Trader or something else ?

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Yes it is for Yen Trader.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
True, besides, higher latency might yield better signal quality...more pips per signal. Experimentation is key to progress.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Great job.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Redfan, I could not see any errors and it could be that a signal has not occurred yet on the H1.  Just to confirm, you must use the exact name of the pair as identified in market watch in mt4 (Ctrl +m).  If you just want to see if it trades, try a lower TF like M15.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Wonderful results.

Which time-frame do you attache the EA to? 1M, 15M ... etc.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
will give it a try

USD/JPY 15M  + GBP/USD 15M   =   GBP/JPY 5M

So it should look like this.

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
look at the trade explorer - it almost lost everything gained yesterday -

this is why i am saying the backtest shows a very mixed result.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Could somebody explain how to use (major direction) when do i make R and when L

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Yes indeed. I saw it reach 75% return yesterday ( in 2 days). A better profit protecting method should be used. Anyway, TE is in its 3rd day which is a too short period to judge, and thodie is using a high leverage, but as he said, this is what testing is for, testing the borders. So lets see how bad it can get.

A very nice H&S though on the TE "return by trade graph"

JamesT.   your work very hard i wil try your set in nextweek -

Thank very much

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Today i tried a new approach, ditching EUCHF, EURAUD, EURGBP from the forward test and focusing only on the yen pairs. I also used a fix lot sizeof 0.01.

Concept which i will try to enforce is to close all trades at the end of us session max. Also i would like to add GBP pairs when i find right combinations. Please note that DD is 20% because i used script to close all orders first orders in loss then orders in profit so that created this relative DD. So far these are the results for today:

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Great work, James T. When a forward test is a direct match to a backtest, there is still hope.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Which version of EA is used in trade explorer?

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Sharing the system's source code:

There were many requests directly on this thread or through private messages for sharing the mq4 source of the system.

The 2 main reasons that stop me from doing that are:Bad experience on previously shared source of my other systems I usually loose interest in further development after I share the system's source The system idea is simple, and continuous enhancements are being discussed openly in this thread. I don't think replicating the code will be an issue for any coder.

And who knows, maybe at the end I will share the mq4 file in the thread as I did with other systems.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
No issue at all. You are already doing a great work in providing us with a free of charge EA.

I prefer that all developments are done by one person rather than having several EAs coded differently.

I fully support your argument Khalil.

But no matter what you do please don't put a time restriction on the EA.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Version 5

--- 帖子 #452 ---
is very important to have hours in the EA

--- 帖子 #453 ---
I've been running an H1/M5 demo for nine days and thought it would be interesting to compare forward performance

with backtested performance over the same time period. Although there are differences in trade stats in specific areas,

the overall results are very close.

Total profit and profit factor are virtually identical, but DD is better going forward.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Hi Rob, also great work, this looks very good, thanks.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Hi Abokwaik,

I have some queries which need to be clarified:

1. If I set true for ATR including TP/SL, which one will the EA take, TP/SL in general (i.e.5000 and 1000) or TP/SL as set in ATR?

2. Is it OK if both signal and chart lower than H1, but SL is 1000 ? Is it considered reversal than correction?

3. What is your view if I run this EA in demo next week with the same pair and the same TF but with difference magic number, one for buy only and other for sell only. Can be profitable or may lead to the double loss?

--- 帖子 #456 ---
ATR levels, See post # 274.

The EA wont say no.

The EA doesn't care.

You can achieve the same by setting "close on reversal" to false, and "hedging| to true.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
You don't have to justify yourself for non sharing it. You are the sole owner of your code and the decision is yours and should be respected.

Keep up the great work you are doing here

--- 帖子 #458 ---
as stated in post #36 i would recommend a filter to prevent the expert from selling bottoms / buying tops

you can see in the pictures - the higher the distance the higher the odds for a losing trade.

//+---------------------------------------------------------------------+

double DT=iMA(NULL,PERIOD_M5,288,0,MODE_EMA,PRICE_CLOSE,0);

if(Buy* && Ask >= DT && Ask <= (DT+20*pt)) return(buy);

if(Sell* && Bid <= DT && Bid >= (DT-20*pt)) return(sell);
*your trigger;  "20*pt" = 20xPoint

//+---------------------------------------------------------------------+

sure this will cause far less trades, probably a better solution is a dynamic distance to the DT EMA based on average daily range or something other that

isnt static.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Thank you my friend, and thanks for being around.

. I agree wholeheartedly.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Right thodie, I forgot to include that in v5. I will surely have it in v6.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
it's good to see these back tests that correspond with the forward tests.  That said I have not seen a lower TF test that survived long term.  Perhaps this system might walk forward; most systems don't, but maybe this one will.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
I think Ocsag meant an expiry date of the EA itself, not a trading restriction on the hours traded?

guys, i have set up fxbook link : https://www.myfxbook.com/portfolio/mt4-2050812/1709191

starting from friday - using 15M signal on 1 m chart - EA version 5.1

it's thodie's setfile.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Thank you cj.

But there would be no added value in running the same test as thodie.

I suggest these options for you:

1. Running a different set file.

2. Running thodie's set on different pair(s).

3. Wait for v6 to forward test this week.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
yep - i will upgrade to v6 and your new setfile once you released it ;-)

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Its not about how many trades u bank a day but also about consistency. I see Thodie made a lot last week but now equity is down to +$20,000.

Keyword here is: CONSISTENCY

--- 帖子 #468 ---
True. Thats why we forward test /enhance before committing real money on the system, bearing in mind that after all, we may end up with a false call.

Hat=In the ring!

Some pretty kewl ideas floating around here, dude.

Figured I'd whoop up a little something for my own personal testing...will see how it goes and maybe we can mill a few ideas together.

First - I have to make sure it trades.

Second - Verify triggering to pairs in trade...

After...maybe a share?

TE Link ->HERE

12 pairs in trade along the lines of post 1.

EURJPY

GBPJPY

AUDJPY

NZDJPY

EURCAD

GBPCAD

AUDCAD

NZDCAD

EURCHF

GBPCHF

AUDCHF

NZDCHF

With this many pairs, I am bound to see a little action.

Good to see you here, Magix. Looking forward to your contributions.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
I've tried a couple of correlation traders in past that were fucking terrible.

Different methodology...

Different filtering...

Won't be expecting much, but maybe a little more to build on.

Will look forward to seeing what else the thread has to offer.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
I, and others, have had success with the EA, but not for a long enough time to

validate consistency.

--- 帖子 #473 ---
I'd have to test the thread version and have a better look under the hood to see what and where I might be able to add, but ultimately speaking, like Abokwaik said, given the simplicity, anybody with code experience should be able to replicate...

And really, why replicate if we add in a touch of our own whimsical flair?

Will giver a whirl anyways...a few snippets here n there can always be added or removed.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
This method is similar to that used in roulette. I'll try here with risk management 1 to 3

--- 帖子 #475 ---
I want to put this EA on a USDJPY chart, I'm confused as to which combination should I use?

GBPUSD

GBPJPY

USDJPY

I this correct?  Or it's not possible?

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Among the different combinations available to trade USDJPY you can use 1 of these 2:

1. USDCAD + CADJPY = USDJPY

2. USDCHF + CHFJPY = USDJPY

the are 4 more combinations, but these are the straight forward sets.

The Explorer Posted is one of my own creations that combines the ideas posted in this thread by Abokwaik with a little of my own personal trade logic.

It's running on an M1 chart, but filters through the day and daily trend.

How are we going to salvage this great idea?

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Markets change. One has to identify why the expert did poorly and well during certain windows and adjust the expert accordingly (e.g., the requested hour filters and other filters, etc). Or, more likely, for lower TF's, the settings will have to be adjusted to market conditions repeatedly. So you choose settings that work over a past window (e.g., a year) and then trade those forward over a smaller window (e.g. a month), and then repeat the process each month. The hard part is (i) choosing settings that are not overly curve fit and (ii) choosing the size of the test and forward windows. These issues are open to debate by some and the best approach may be to try different ones of (i) and (ii) and see which work best over a long period of time (a time consuming process and exposing the limits of MT4). Even then, on lower TF, it has a solid chance of not walking forward profitably. A losing a expert in the hands one trader can be a profitable expert in the hands of another trader and vice versa IMO

--- 帖子 #515 ---
my observation of V5 was: it gets killed in tight range market, and shows a good performance when the market moves.

Consequence - look to avoid buying peaks and selling dips.

I already made my suggestion, Abokwaiks time is limited, i´m sure he will publish V6 when he find the time and it is ready.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Somewhat expected that it will do well outside of tight ranges for those seeking 1:5 RR with a 5000 target, stacking multiple trades, etc.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
as the trail was active RR was not the problem in my test.

I´m talking about this if we can avoid! trades like this... profit factor would be most likely better.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Good afternoon,  unfortunately I didn't have any chance to access my computer for the whole week. I will get back home on Sunday and I will do my best to do v6 before markets open.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
good day,

Just reverse the code. there is a 20 pip opportunity. Sell instead of buy and vice versa. Divergence is what this is based on. Divergence should not be an opportunity to trade in the divergence direction - rather the opposite?

--- 帖子 #520 ---
this is Abokwaiks_Yentrader_V3 in reverse mode - quick & dirty backtest.

Agree on the divergence. Please see post #28. As I replied to your request on the reverse option it will be supported in v6.Thank you

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Take your time, you are very generous.  Thank you!

--- 帖子 #523 ---
best could be "auto learning bot"...

need only few parameters at start, and calculate best parameters each month, month after month, with always 12 months backtest...

weekly calculation could be good during week end too...

So the bot could maintain best parameters as possible if it seams working sometime and not always !

Include only more parameters later, because more parameters need more calculation time to optimize...

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Hi,

Finally I had the chance to work on Yen Trader.

I managed to perform a major surgery operation on Yen Trader and converted it to Cross Trader.

Inputs were minimized. Removed inputs were set to best defaults and their functionality is still in the code.

Cross Trader is designed to work on any Major Cross pair (total of 21 pairs).

Once placed on a cross pair chart, it  detects its component pairs including any prefix/suffix.

Most of the options that were planned for Yen Trader 6 were added to Cross Trader 6, which is the natural evolution of Yen Trader.

Soon I will post the EA along with few tests and more details.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Thanks man!I think the older versions will remain working it's right?

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Nicely done, man!

My first week trial on this came up a lot better than previous versions, in that it actually lasted the week.

Still room for improvements.

I've thrown together a few more ideas and into my Lost Sock logic (made available for public testing) and am going to run this side by for the week vs the previous version.  I have a wussy out close enabled which was the source of the Draws last week...fortunately, the gains still bailed out the losers.  The new version, will let it run without the wussy and see if it's comparable.

Look forward to seeing them perform along side yours.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Yes of course.  Cross Trader is a continuation of Yen Trader. It offers all the features of Yen Trader plus additional features.  The name change was necessary as the new expert can trade all crosses not only yen crosses. It does that in a simple and neat way where you don't have to care about pair names, prefixes and currency code position in each pair name.

Hi Abokwaik,

Allow me just to comment that from the battery of tests that result in post #517 (500% profit in 6 months with only 25% relative DD (1jan to 9jul 2016), the following settings were best at 0 or false:

Break even

Profit lock

Loop back bars

RSI

RVI

CCI

Close on opposite signal

Hedge on opposite signal

I hope it helps!

The tests you posted are from v5_1, where any loop back bars number < 2 is not used.

The minimum is 2 because we are comparing the last close price (bar1) with at least bar2 price

setting it to 0 (or 1) means disabling it.

Anyway I brought it back to be able to disable it if one likes to use the MA only. (I will re-upload it in post # 535)

Strat test is working now with 6.1. Don't know what happened.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
The Maximum Distance to the Moving Average for opening a trade in terms of ATR multipliers. This was added to avoid opening a buy trade at the top  or a sell trade at the bottom where reversal is possible.

So for example, if price is 1.2250, ATR is 20 pips, MA is 1.2150, and you set  "Max ATR multiplies to MA" to 3 which is translated to 3x20=60 pips, the EA will ignore the buy signal at this price because its 100 pips away from the MA.

Such a filter was suggested by thodie , see post # 36 and post # 461.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
I am terribly sorry, must be lack of sleep, the 6.1 version posted has Hedging Enabled and max orders set to 2 as I was testing, while they should be defaulted to False and 1 respectivly.

This 6.2 with these re-defaulted to their original values.

I am off to sleep, have a good night.

Can someone share a setfile for the Cross Trader 06.2 ?, tried to input some values but EA doesn't working.

Are MA period and ATR period both off of the daily or the current TF?

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Current.

I noticed the erratic nature of ATR values on short time frames, so I will apply the square root formula suggested by GoldeTheHun in ATR Break Out thread:

ATRforTimeFrame = DailyATR(30) /sqrt(1440 / TradingTimeFrame)

--- 帖子 #556 ---
While doing further tests, I discovered few issues regrading Trailing Stop, Break Even Stop and Profit Lock. I am working on it and will post shortly.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
I have to say that TP and SL in pips will be missed, frequently (in other EAs) tests give better results with fixed values.

And why TF disappeared? My best backtest of Yen Trader was M1 (chart) / M5 (EA)...

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Pip values vary by time frame, ATR gives better generalization and more objective testing.

Same template can be applied to multiple pairs/multiple time frames without the need to modify values. of SL/TP/BE/PL ... etc.

As for using different Signal and an Entry time frame, I found it risky, specially if you set max orders to a high number on a short entry time frame.

Input screen was so crowded with too many variables which make back/forward testing more like a puzzle, and can lead to curve fitting.

Anyway, I am open minded, and the code is maintained in CT6 and can be activated anytime.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
No. It's coded as Normalized value on the traded time frame.

Instead of taking the actual ATR of the traded time frame, we are using a normalized value of the traded time frame using higher time frame.

Example 1: GBPJPY traded time frame = M30, ATR(21) on M30 is 26 pips, ATR(21) on Daily is 332 Pips.

Version 6.2 was using the 26 Pips when traded on M30.

Version 6.3 is using atr=332/sqrt(1440/30) = 47 pips.

Example 2: GBPJPY traded time frame = H4, ATR(21) on H4 is 102 pips, ATR(21) on Monthly is 1070 Pips.

Version 6.2 was using the 102 Pips when traded on M30.

Version 6.3 is using atr=1070/sqrt(43200/240) = 80 pips.

OK. These are the inputs defaulted in v6

1;//Max Open Trades

false;//Close on Opposite Signal

false;//Hedge on Opposite Signal

Both;//Entry Type when Entry TF < Signal TF
High/Low Price of Previous Bars;//Price Type of Loop Back Bars

It could be the price type, if your v5 test was using Close instead of High/Low

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Do you also have an input for max distance ATR in v6?  Or is that a typo (it is actually the max)

--- 帖子 #582 ---
No it is not a typo, the min_pip_dist and min_atr_dist are used between consecutive orders when you set max orders > 1, so that open trades are far enough from each other. Those were not needed in Cross Trader as we have only one order per pair.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
I see, so you don't have ATR max distance in Yen trader v6?

Will run some more tests on v6.3.  Have to go now and will check back later.  Thanks for all your effort on this, Kahlil!

--- 帖子 #584 ---
No. It was not coded yet.

Here are the test passes on CT6.3 with ATR Max Dist varying from 0 (disabled) to 10.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Hmm, that looks really odd (as ATR max increased the results should have approached it disabled).  I will look at 6.3 further and see if it works over the tougher years like v5 did. Keep in mind that some of the filters you had in 5 worked well, at least on GJ (greatly limited number of trades, but that might work great on multiple pairs).

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Probably I'll never use / develop this code but anyway have to thank the generosity that you show!

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Thank you so much!!!

--- 帖子 #588 ---
0 (=disabled) is the max (infinity) as the validation is not activated, 1 is the minimum.

So the EA will trade at any distance from the MA, hence it has the max trades.

The complete code of YT5 is still encapsulated inside CT6, if you guys insist I can bring all the input options back.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
I guess i was confused on the ATR settings?  I have always thought that the ATR SL and TP levels should be dynamic but within reason (have a maximum and minimum ATR level).  That is, if ATR is extremely high (like after brexit), then the expert will use so user input maximum ATR value or threshold if you will.  Same for minimum if the ATR drops crazy low.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Would be interested in seeing v6 with the min max ATR input.  Not sure I follow on what changed in the core system (hi-low vs open close maybe), but v6 looked trade-able as it was on 4H, except for TP/SL levels based on current historically most extreme ATR levels. Don't want to clutter your thread, if interested I will PM.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Can you explain what this means?——“Greater by a min of x pips. where x is H1 ATR(24)”

thanks

--- 帖子 #595 ---
The Oridinal Idea was for example to Buy GBPJPY when GBPUSD is UP and USDJPY is UP, and Sell GBPJPY when GBPUSD is DOWN and USDJPY is DOWN.

UP and DOWN can be defined in so many ways:UP :Close > Open Close > Moving Average RSI > 50 MACD > 0 HA is green . ... etc  DOWNClose < Open Close < Moving Average RSI < 50 MACD < 0 HA is red ... etc  So one way (the simplest) was to use Close vs Open prices.

Greater by a min of x pips. where x is H1 ATR(24)

So if we are trading GBPJPY on H1 time frame, we check the ATR indicator on a specific period, 24 hours in the example, on GBPUSD and USDJPY.

Suppose it was 20 pips on GBPUSD and 15 pips on USDJPY

Now we consider GBPUSD is UP if the current price is greater than the price 24 hours ago by 20 pips, and we consider USDJPY is up if the current price is greater than the price 24 hours ago by 15 pips. If both conditions are OK we buy GBPJPY at current price. Same method will be applied on DOWN for selling GBPJPY.

Notes on my forward testing:

My FT is not on VPS, I run it only while in work which coincides with London Session. After that I close the PC and leave any open trades to their destiny, either SL or last trailed SL (as TP is usually too far).

Although the EA is running on 20 pairs, so far only GBPJPY trades were triggered. That could be due to frequent internet disconnection at my work. In next post will share missed trades since account started (last 2 days).

--- 帖子 #620 ---

No Majors, EURUSD is one of the majors.

If you attached the EA to a major pair chart, or to non-supported pairs (Gold, EURRUB, EURZAR,  NOKJPY ... etc). it will print a messages of "INVALID PAIRS" in the expert log and remove itself from the chart.

No need to change the magic number on different pairs.

You need to change the magic number only if you are attaching the EA to the same pair (different settings, different tf).

Thank you nonlinear for all the effort you're putting in back testing the system.

I was just wondering :

We know that automated systems do not last long, as market conditions change.

Edges appear and disappear after a while, they don't last forever.

Do we need to go back so far in history to test an edge that appeared recently ?

--- 帖子 #654 ---
That question is forever debated it seems.  First, my personal view is that I want to see the conditions under which the expert does not do well so I know when to shut it down.  Everyone wants to look at the good results but the learning is in the poor results.  Second, again my personal view, I think its fine to back test on a shorter window so long as the number of trade is statistically significant, but one must be very careful not to overly curve fit.  If one takes that approach, one must keenly choose settings that are not greedy. When a return looks unrealistic its usually is not sustainable.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
I agree. Do your thing and enlight us.

--- 帖子 #661 ---
So we know that GJ was trending up over most of my test window.  Lets try a test over the last year when it was trending down and see what happens to the win % for shorts versus longs.  Short win rate goes up of course, but long win rate is still high.  Begs the question, why does this system do so well with long trades, even in a down trending market?

will add magic numbers to my tester and use different magic numbers for long and short, this might give us some edge.

hello Folks

abo kwaik i would suggest using the HA hekins as the previos day candle direction that indicates the next coming day

so if the day is red lest say so the next day is also red and so

this could solve it

of cores till the direction change

now if u back to the daily chart and count the Heikans as true or faults according to this methology ull find ur self as 75% to 80% of the time in the right direction as the end of the day

Hi rammer,

You're referring to old versions where you had to enter the pair names and direction.

Versions 6.0 and above do this automatically for you.

All you need is to attach the EA to the cross pair you want to trade and the EA decides on component pairs and direction of each component

Latest versions are : Cross_Trader_6.3 (with minimized inputs), and Cross_Trader_6.4 (Fully Loaded).

Would be interesting to test this with no TP, just a trailing stop based on the ATR -- should work well to get some runners witha  really high RR but lower WR in pairs that trend.   Will try later

hi abokwaik

if we backtest the EA on EURGBP,  is it true that we only need data for EURUSD, EURGBP and GBPUSD?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #686 ---
Yes.

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Its because you are using Cross pair EA on major pair charts like EURUSD, USDJPY, GBPUSD but this EA only works on Cross pairs like GBPJPY, GBPAUD etc...

--- 帖子 #688 ---
Hi Isam,

The EA (version 6 and above , Cross Trader), can be traded on Major Crosses ONLY, those are 21 crosses as below:

EURGBP, EURAUD, EURNZD, EURCAD, EURCHF, EURJPY

GBPAUD, GBPNZD, GBPCAD, GBPCHF, GBPJPY

AUDNZD, AUDCAD, AUDCHF, AUDJPY

NZDCAD, NZDCHF, NZDJPY

CADCHF, CADJPY

CHFJPY

If you attach the EA to a major pair chart, or to non-supported pairs (Gold, EURRUB, EURZAR, NOKJPY ... etc). it will print a messages of "INVALID PAIRS" in the expert log and remove itself from the chart.

Have been running forward tests on Dragon. Switched to reverse with the 6.4 version. minute charts taking signals off 30 min. Small TP. 400 pip SL. Also included EURGBP on last 2.

This is what I have so far.

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Thanks for sharing.

My forward test on H1 , although running on 20 pairs, made only 3 trades in a week (specially since it's runnig part time) which makes it inappropriate to evaluate in a reasonable period, so I am gonna switch to lower time frame next week in order to have more trades.

--- 帖子 #696 ---
Thats with reverse?! Whats your TP?

--- 帖子 #697 ---
Only 30 pips on Dragon. I saw a pattern and I'm testing that. May implode.

So far - go good.

--- 帖子 #698 ---
hi mate, in the EA, all the parameters are in the unit of Point, is it true?

for example, max spread = 100, which is 10 pips, right?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #699 ---
Depends on your broker, if it's 5-digits, you enter it in points. If it's 4-digit broker, you enter it in pips.

Mine is 5-digits, so my shared settings are in points.

100 point = 10 pips.

Btw, if you now backtest the past week, are you able to reproduce your trades in your TE?

Here at my side, it seems very hard to reproduce the same trades.

--- 帖子 #704 ---
Okay so after some testing on multiple pairs, I must say that this EA is very pair dependent and it is highly unlikely that one setting or even range will work across multiple pairs.  Of course, this is typical, hence the labor in trying to trade multiple pairs profitably.   Thus, I am going to focus on trying to just trade one pair for now, although I do think there is serious potential to trade fx off of indexes with this technique, even scalping.  One day at a time...

--- 帖子 #705 ---
job weldone .... really nice job ...... your strategy helps alot and made complete sense

--- 帖子 #706 ---
I also noticed that the best performing pair was GBPJPY, although ATR settings are generic.

On the other hand, I found reversal option works good on ranging pairs, specially when used with low profit settings.

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Let't go back to the basics.

We buy EURGBP when EURUSD is up and GBPUSD is down.

This is situation is rare and does not last long, as both pairs (EU and GU) are positively correlated.

UNLESS we catch the start of EURGBP swing up. But how to do that ?

We know EG is affected by EU & GU but at a certain time which pair affects it more ?

This is the EG H1 chart  of this Thursday:

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Apparently GU had more effect on EG on this day.

--- 帖子 #708 ---
This is another perspective of the above charts using SMA3 and 8.

While SMA3 > SMA8 on both EU and GU we don't trade.

Once SMA3 crosses down SMA8 on GU while still above SMA8 on EU and EG we open Long.

We close when either SMA3 crosses down on EU, or UP on GU.

Spread gets too high on end of day, so I think its better to close the trades which are in loss an hour or so before end of day.

Last night example on GBPCHF, spread over 30 pips and position got stopped.

--- 帖子 #719 ---
You are absolutely right Khalil. The worst trade/spread which is opened at the end of Friday market close. Maybe time filter would improve EA trading if we prohibit end of day (before night spread widening) entries especially on Fridays.

Another situation when the deal is already opened and spread widening time comes soon and the deal in some loss you may reset SL to zero value and control average (Bid+Ask)/2 price to know how much is real loss independently from spread and if this loss is increasing over some threshold value EA would close the deal by market. I use this method in some my EAs.

Hey there,

Forgive my ignorance, i'm a little confused on installing the EA. I have been through a majority of the posts in this thread and have downloaded the latest EA abokwaik.

Am I understanding correctly on how to install? Looking at your above results, you have installed the EA on the 15m charts, using 1hr signal in the input settings?

Also, you install on the cross pair GBPJPY for example.

Just wanted to clarify if that's correct?

Thanks for everyone's efforts.

So far I have only attested with GBPJPY. Can you give any tips on the SL / TP values to start testing with other JPY pairs?

Thank you

--- 帖子 #738 ---
Nevermind, I see your scanner settings are different. Oops :-)

--- 帖子 #739 ---
There are many methods for this:SL below Swing Low for Long, above Sqing High for Short, TP with reward to risk >= 1:1 SL x times the ATR value, TP with reward to risk >= 1:1, where x can range from 1 to 10 depending on the traded tf. SL & TP when either of the component pars changes direction. MA reverse cross on the traded pair. .... etc.

--- 帖子 #740 ---
Excuse me,

I refer to input values in strategy tester for others pairs.

--- 帖子 #741 ---
Sorry, I thought you were asking about manual trading.

For the EA different settings were tested and shared by me and other members.

On the trade explorer I am using the settings shared in post # 718 on all pairs.

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Thank you!

And I've tested and choosed to continue the tests with manual lot increment. It's possible to create two input to EA increment the lot size in an account balance step?

Let me be more clear giving an example: When the account balance grow 100% the EA increment lot size by 100% or 50% or so based on input values. The current option constantly increments the lot size.

--- 帖子 #743 ---
Yes. It is possible, and from my experiments with other systems it is better to increase/decrease the lot size based on account return pre-set milestone percentages.

I will implement this feature in next release.

Thanks

Hello Abo

Why the EA didn't take that trade?

Because of added filters.

Hi abokwaik,

I have one short question: I use ct 6.41 on different pairs, but all pairs with the same settings (rolled out via template). I use variable lotsize always with 1.5 % of balance (fixed lotsize is 0).

At the moment I have two open positions: One in EURGBP (0.06 lot) and one in GBPCHF (0.01 lot). Do you have an idea, where the difference in lotsize comes from?

Thanks and best regards

siero

--- 帖子 #758 ---
Yes, dear siero.

That is due to Margin Requirements on CHF pairs, which is usually higher by 2 or more times that other pairs. Mainly because SNB is known for its interference in the spot market.

Your broker has even a higher margin on CHF pairs, could be 4 times standard margin. To overcome that you need to increase the lot size percentage on the CHF pairs in order to cover for the higher margin requirements.

All the best,

Khalil

Hi Khakil,

I traded foreward test ct 641 with your set file, but I found no trailing stop.

I have something wrong?

--- 帖子 #764 ---
There is a Trailing stop of 500 points (50 pips).

I checked the code and found the system checks for ATR Trailing Stop input to be > 0 to activate the Trailing. This input in my settings was 2, so that wouldn't be a problem.

However, if you changed this input to 0, yes, trailing stop will not work.

My recommendation for now is to leave all ATR values > 0 and just set the  "Enable ATR-based levels" input to false if you want to use the pip values.

In next release I will have different checks for ATR and Pip levels.

Thank you for raising that up.

--- 帖子 #765 ---
Hi Khalil Abokwaik,

Much respect to your hard work over here. I am reading the thread and should be caught up by this weekend. I installed the EA (6.41) on 11 pairs just to get my feet wet.

Wondering if the EA will keep opening positions if requirements are met. If so maybe set a max amount of trades at one time so margin doesn't come into play and we can load the EA on all 21 pairs and not worry about such things. Just something to think about.

Will be contributing more as I get more accumulated to the EA. Thanks again for everything.

--- 帖子 #766 ---
Hello TrueStoryfx

You can already chose the max number of trades.

One more question: the ATR time frame is 4h.... shouldn't it be 1h ?

Thank you  again Abokwaik for those manual tradings.... i still trade manually and like it...

--- 帖子 #767 ---
Hi abokwaik,

I set the "Max Open Trades" to values above 1 and the EA opens just an order in 6.41 version. Do you disabled this option? Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #768 ---
No. It is enabled. But it depends on the filters selected.

--- 帖子 #769 ---
Thanks.

We already have a max order input for each pair, but I know that you mean max orders on all pairs.

Well I was thinking of either turn the EA into a multi-cross trader OR add a management EA.

I prefer the second option which gives the us the flexibility in setting different parameters for each pair, while a Trade Manager takes care of all pairs.

Looking at your charts Khalil, i see that opened positons reaches maximum profit within 10 to 20 hours after opening. Maybe it would be useful to control opened trade profit during this period and close deal when our profit hits some defined value (from 50 to 100 pips). Larry Williams used closing trades by exact time in bars and succeeded. Of course This way we are cutting our potential rising profits but do not allow to fall them into loss or BE. Maybe it would give some advantade in long term, needs more live statistics or backtesting.

--- 帖子 #779 ---
---------------------------- Finished Editing ------------------------------

Hi Abokwaik

Nice EA and system although I just keep one eye on it for now through the results of others here I wanted to suggest something to consider. I will test the system once I have some spare time,maybe over Christmas in a couple of months.

Regarding the missed pips.....

You want to be able to take advantage of the average profit scenario ie. the most common profit reached before becoming a loss.You want to take a partial profit there and then either reduce SL to same value as the profit taken or put SL at BE and then you can further scale out of the rest of the position as it move further in your direction or get stopped out at BE bearing in mind that it wont always go to a big win that is just how it is so one needs to plan for it.Some times we just need to take what we can can and see what happens to the rest of the position that is left open, that way your first TP can try and make up for the losses and keep you kinda at BE in account balance and then you can wait for the big movers to give your account a nice boost.

So as per you trades posted :

From what I see

* EUR / NZD TP 1 could have been at +30 for half the postion size and then your loss was about - 55 pips that would give negative of -25 pips at half the size

* GBP / NZD (First Trade / Long ) TP 1 could have been + 40 and then - the loss of say 70 pips it would give you - 30 at half the size

* GBP / NZD ( Second Trade / Short ) TP 1 at +40( 0.08 ) and half of TP2 at +80 (0.04 so has same value as TP 1 ) , rest at BE or trailing SL

* EUR / GBP TP 1 at +40 and the BE for the rest

* GBP / JPY TP1 at +60 and TP2 at like 90 or waht ever and rest at BE

- This all depends on the average ranges and volatility and I'm sure one can use an average of it to measure it and keep it relevant to whats has happened in the pair in recent weeks. Using ADR of the last 20 daily candles or something of the sort and then calculate how much the pair has already moved in the day and calculate TP 1 at the at the level where the daily range would be reached and then one can try and see what can happen from there as it does break it some of the time.

This would have decreased the loss outcome significantly or might have even given you a slight profit depending on how you calculate what.I know it seems easy after the fact but partial profits is definitely a good option so that you can at least get some of it when it does go your way.

Sorry for the hurried reply and the less than neat  work but I have to run.

Great idea and great work and really hope that this can culminate into something really nice as the principal of it is very nice and there are plenty of traders who look at the market similarly but in a manual way.This is nice and solid logic for all to have the same idea and analysis

All the best for now

PS - Please disregard anything I have said if it has been said before or not apart of what your vision is for the EA as I don't like to impose my views to much as you put in the work to get this far fine without my input or opinion

--- 帖子 #780 ---

Its OK. Still testing, no hurry. Basket reached > 2% today, but my target was 4%.

All trades (4) are still a live, 2 of them already at BE.

I agree though that target might be too high, since the EA is trading on M5.

Thanks for dropping by.

--- 帖子 #790 ---
Hi abokwaik,

What do you think about a jumping R TP? i.e. determine TP as the same distance to SL (i.e. 1R). Then if price reaches this hidden TP level SL is moved to BE and TP is moved up 1R. This process continues. Could be combined with a close on an opposite signal?

Keep up the good work,

--- 帖子 #791 ---
I do like the cross correlation filtering.

Adding this to an M1 logic that is currently running has slowed down the trading, but on a Cost Average trader, has also minimized the draw.

Not absolute perfection, but enough for me to start working with other pairs I wouldn't normally trade...

Reasonable expectation and multiple forms of triggering and exit logic to allow for consistent profit while allowing a cut loss if/when the proverbial shit hits the fan.

Yes. But for this week Signal Time Frame is M30 and Trading Time Frame M5.

As for Close_all_trades it depends on previous loss on the day, I initially put it at 2%, if some trades closed in loss before target reached I increase the target.

Today I took 2 manual trades based on the indicator (chfjpy 0.15 and cadjpy 0.15) which fired before the EA (using same settings) but I closed them manually in small loss because the EA opened similar trades later.

While I am playing around with Cross Trader, my swing dollar short trades hit TP.  I need to test Cross Trader more often! lol

--- 帖子 #810 ---
shouldn't you lower TP settings with 5mn TF?

--- 帖子 #811 ---
This should solve the profit lock issue.

--- 帖子 #812 ---
Hi Abokwaik,

What are the factors that affect the open position for this EA ?

I have attached EA in 2 different brokers. But, 1 broker never opens any single position since I attach this EA in late last week.

I use version 6.4.1 with default setting (incl M5 & M30) and set file as provided by you.

Thanks

In testing, when the profit should lock in at 1000 points, it sets the SL to BE

2016.08.09 11:08:27.597    2012.01.13 10:21  Cross_Trader_06.43 AUDCAD,M15: modify #1 buy 0.30 AUDCAD at 1.04352 sl: 1.04352 tp: 0.00000 ok

--- 帖子 #814 ---
You need to enable the trailing stop. So that the SL is trailed until it reached the Profit Lock, after that it stops trailing.

--- 帖子 #815 ---
Ahh, yes that works now! Now we can get some runners. Seem to get some errors when trying to use the ATR version, but will work on the fixed TP SL for now.

Re ATR inputs, what is the trailing stop shift?

Seeing a ton of these: Cross_Trader_06.43 AUDCAD,M15: Order SL Modify Error: no error, trade conditions not changed

--- 帖子 #816 ---
Hello Abo

I don't understand why yin your forward test you set TP to 2000. Isn't it to far for a 5mn TF?

Tx

S

--- 帖子 #817 ---
Hi S,

I am sure you know this in points, 2000 points = 200 pips. Still it might be far on M5.

Actually the TP/SL settings were initially set on H1, but I didn't change them for the previous week when I change the testing on M15, and this week when I changed the testing on M5. The main reason is that the system doesn't generate so many signals, so signals are precious although they are coming from M5.

I am using  a trade manager to close when the whole basket reaches certain profit, so setting TP high is similar to disabling it.

--- 帖子 #818 ---
Hi aboak,

Good day to you, May i ask if you run this EA on M5 chart? from 1H you change it to _5m? and also may i know if the preset inputs are default?

--- 帖子 #819 ---
Hello Everyone,

I am still manual trading, and I must say the results are great.

I use ATR for stop Loss and TP now which can adapt to the volatility.

I will test the EA next week with ATR Settings.

--- 帖子 #820 ---
Great!

Are you using the indicator, or you're doing it completely manual. It must be hard unless your trading few pairs only.

--- 帖子 #821 ---
I share changes in the setting at the beginning of each week.

Please Check post # 787.

--- 帖子 #822 ---
I also started a forward test with M5 and M30 as signal tf.

will keep you posted about results.

--- 帖子 #823 ---
Thanks, Did you also attached the profit basket ea to managed the orders?

--- 帖子 #824 ---
Hey  abokwaik   . but you can make a general closure on the percentage of the whole basket? In the fourth version of the robot. Thank you for your great work!

--- 帖子 #825 ---
Excellent recovery by the EA . I'm curious on what Change you made sir to cause the recovery? In any case I'm extremely impressed so far and would like to you know when you Expect to go live

--- 帖子 #826 ---
It seems configuration changes need to be made in areas where the equity curves goes down for recovery. Please verify  if you just let it run or you needed to manually intervene with human input

--- 帖子 #827 ---
I only intend to use on gbpjpy at 15 min level on a trending market condition. If it can at least handle that without human , starting point to creating God system.

--- 帖子 #828 ---
Which are the top pairs with lowest spread? I plan to go live in a few weeks and wish to know the best pairs to begin testing with according to their volatility to make most profit. Thanks in advance, BoHanna

--- 帖子 #829 ---
Unsurprisingly top 3  performers so far  are yen crosses:

1. GBPJPY

2. AUDJPY

3. CADJPY

Thank u very much Abokwaik! Your fast response is very much appreciated! I will begin testing today.

Хай.

Хотелось бы продолжение поста 713.

Я именно так себе и представлял входы-выходы по данной стратегии.

Если 2 младшие МА находятся выше старшей МА1, то моментом , констатирующим рост , является пересечение более быстрой МА3 вверх менее быстрой МА2.

Выход - на обратном пересечении МА3 вниз МА2. Для обоих мажоров. В этом случае профит можно не задавать. Впрочем , можно и стоп-лосс не фиксировать , если вести его по МА2 или ( лучше ) по сужающейся ФИФО.

Задавать в советнике конкретные цели ( стопы , профиты и пр. ) - неблагодарное дело. Это всегда пападание пальцем в небо.

Спасибо. Простите за прекрасный английский от Google .

Hi.

It would be a continuation of the post 713.

I'm just so imagined inputs and outputs for this strategy.

If 2 junior MA are above senior MA1, the moment, says the growth is the intersection faster MA3 MA2 up less quickly.

Exit - to reverse the intersection of MA3 MA2 down. For both majors. In this case, the profit may be omitted. However, you can and stop-loss is not to fix, if its conduct on MA2 or (better) by narrowing the FIFO.

Ask the advisor to the specific objectives (of the foot, profits, etc.) - A thankless job. It is always motor fuels finger to the sky.

Thank you. Sorry for the beautiful English from Google.

--- 帖子 #832 ---
Indeed , "beautiful English from Google" .

@abok

Hi Sir! thank you for your replied, I have a follow up question in the trade manager EA, in what percentage or amount you set the EA to closed all the market orders? Can i have your preset file for that? if you don't mind i don't wanna missed the right settings because i plan to attached your CROSS EA to my Live account.

Thank you in advanced,

--- 帖子 #838 ---
This is a bet tricky.

There's is no fixed setting for the trade manager because that will depend on the number of open trades, and lot size which depends on your account leverage and margin requirements.

On Cross Trader I am using 1% of balance for each position, My account leverage is 1:200, (margin req. is 5%). For accounts with higher leverage the lot size will be more, and for accounts with lower leverage the lost size will be less.

So on my current account the lot size is ranging from 0.15  to 0.25 depending on the cross traded.

And I have it attached to 14 pairs.

On Average I have 3 trades open.

On the trade manager I set the profit target around 2% ($200 on a $10,000 account). Which on average gives 30-40 pips profit per each cross.

You can override the lot size issue by using the Fixed Lot Size.

If your are trading one cross it will be easy to calculate the desired profit percentage or amount.

But it gets complicated if you trade a basket, because you don't know in advance how many trades are going to open.

A guide would be for example to have 1% profit target for every 2 trades opened.

So if you have 6 trades open you change it to 3%, and so on.

If you are planning to use the basket profit, it would be better to disable the SL/TP on Cross Trader, and let the trade manager close at basket TP or SL.

--- 帖子 #839 ---
Maybe in next versions it is better to add Profit/Loss Percentage and Amount close on the Cross Trade it self, with options on current traded cross or the whole basket.

--- 帖子 #840 ---

Младший MA выше старшего MA ....

Да , тут забралась ошибка. Имелось ввиду , что более быстрая МА3 пересекает менее быструю МА2 вверх ( при этом обе находятся выше ( или некритически ниже ) медленной МА1 ).

Уж не знаю какие-такие ассоциации вызвала данная фраза , но рад , что ВАМ было весело.

===

Относительно фразы "пальцем в небо" - это исключительно русская фраза. Боюсь , что Google опять начудит и вывернет смысл в неведомом направлении. Тем не менее постараюсь в 2-х словах объяснить.

Когда ты с завязанными глазами решил подстрелить летящий Boinge , то вероятность попадания есть , хоть и гипотетическая. Все зависит от высоты , на которой летит жертва , калибра твоего орудия , направления ветра , удачного залегания в окопе,  от того , что ты употреблял сегодня ночью и пр..... Вообщем , попасть можно.

П.С.

Спасибо за наводку на MA_CROSS_WT . обязательно посмотрю. В любом случае , хотелось бы реализации вашего поста 713 в данном советнике.

=======

Junior MA above the older MA ....

Yes, there is a bug crawled. There was a view that the faster crosses MA3 MA2 less fast up (in this case, both are above (or below uncritically) slow MA1).

I do not know any such association brought the phrase, but I'm glad you had fun.

===

Regarding the phrase "попасть пальцем в небо" - it's only Russian phrase. I fear that Google will turn again nachudil and meaning in an unknown direction. Nevertheless, I will try in 2 words to explain.

When you're blindfolded decided to shoot flying Boinge, then the probability of getting there, though hypothetical. It all depends on the height at which the victim is flying, fire your gun, the wind direction, the successful deposition in the trenches, from what you tried last night and so on ..... In general, you can get there.

PS

Thanks for the tip on MA_CROSS_WT. be sure to take a look. In any case, I would like to exercise your post 713 in this EA.

Hello Khalil and everyone :-)

I just wondered What time of day est are you running the cross trader at the moment and what settings are we using for the 5 min chat as 5000 TP seems very large on my settings so I got stopped out on a AUD/JPY trade last night that would have been profitable with a smaller SL. My price was 77.389 so seems the same decimal places as you're using Khalil :-)

Thanks

Reubsonline

--- 帖子 #844 ---
Well. I am still using the same settings when I started the forward testing. I only changed the Signal time frame to M30 and attached it to M5 time frame since beginning of last week. I didn't change any thing this week.

The TP is too far for an M5 trader, I agree. It is like there is actually no TP. What I do is that I attached a trade manager "Close_All_Trades", you can find it on post 721, and set profit target percentage (2% or so, depending on number of open trades.). The reason for that is I am attaching the EA to multiple pairs (basket).

If you want to use the direct TP feature in the Cross Trader, I suggest using something like 500 points (50 pips).

--- 帖子 #845 ---
Khalil,

What do you think about we have an input like "Min Bars Between Orders"?

--- 帖子 #850 ---
Thanks Khalil :-)

So if you add the trading manager as well as the EA on every asset it will close groups of

trades together from different assets st the same time at a set percentage profit? I

guess you think this works better than just a

low set tp?

Thank

Reubs :-)

--- 帖子 #851 ---
You need to put the  trading manager (Close_All_Trades)  only on one chart that does not have any other EA on it.

It handles the trades on the account level wither they were opened by an EA or manual.

Its a simple closing EA, nothing fancy.

I am planning to develop a full-feature account manager in the near future.

I always believed in trading a basket of pairs, so yes I think it works better.

Hi, what pair, what version EA, what parametres for ea? thx

--- 帖子 #861 ---
If you are planning to run the CrossTrader on multiple pairs, you need to be aware of correlation issues.

For example if you run it on all Yen crosses, it is possible that the EA will open trades on some or all Yen Crosses, and so your account exposure to the Yen will be high.

So you need to EITHER distribute the risk among these crosses OR limit trading max 2 Yen Cross.

Same concept should be applied to other Crosses.

For scalping, its better to use commission-based accounts with low spread. In this context spread + commission should be around 3 pips on GBPJPY.

If I will trade one pair with CrossTrader my first choice will always be GBPJPY.

Safe Trading,

Hello to all,

abokwaik thank you for this great TS and EA, and thank you for all users of this thread.

sorry for my bad english, i had installed only the indicator, on eur/Jpy but no signal, no movement, nothing...

why?? i had installed on a demo mt4 fxpro.

i think have to change set, so.. wich set for the indicator? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #871 ---
In response to PipCruiser:

"Trade tf : 1 HR
High tf: Daily

is this right and shall it still be placed on 5 min with these settings?"

Yes, that is right. The 1HR and Daily are simply the signal timeframes. Feel free to test different signal time frames as well as chart timeframes which is what I will be doing as well.

--- 帖子 #872 ---
Thanks BoHanna,

so the attached settings with EA placed on 5 min chart should be pretty much these settings or am I missing something?

Thx

PC

--- 帖子 #873 ---
Yes, that's how I began. I'm gonna further test by reducing the spread to 20 and 30 max. Then test signal times all the way down to 5min while keeping higher signal one or two steps above primary signal time (make sense?). That's all there is to it. Optimize, then test and re-test. Good luck! Keep me posted.

--- 帖子 #874 ---
Hi guys :-)

I wondered if any one could help...

Its appears the cad/jpy two trades today in Khalil's cross trader were comfortable winners however I thought I was running the same EA on 30 min signal on a 5 min chart the same as Khalil however both my trades were losing trades! (see attached image) Does anyone know what's going on?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #875 ---
It looks like the trade was supposed to be taken six hours ago but my ea took the trade 1 hour/30 min ago! Don't know why!? :-s

--- 帖子 #876 ---
Hi,

Your SL is 20 (200 points)pips, mine is 50 pips (500 points).

Mine opened 1 trade only on CADJPY but survived the drawdown before going its way, then I closed 1/2 of the deal at 1%.

This why it may appear as 2 trades in TE.

I hope this is clear.

--- 帖子 #877 ---
It depends on the time you activate it. If a signal is still valid (although late) it will open a trade.

--- 帖子 #878 ---
Thanks for the reply mate :-)

Thanks for the clear explanation too.

My EA and MT4 has been on all day so I can't work out why it took the trade so late. The only thing I can think is I was running it on a VPS but the VPS has to be AWFUL to make a trade 5 hours later!? Really confused!

--- 帖子 #879 ---
Also my SL looks like it's on 500 not 200 so not sure what's going on there either... (see pic)

--- 帖子 #880 ---
Would it maybe be possible to post a screen shot of your full MT4 EA trading settings box like mine above but yours as this hasn't been shown in this feed for a long time?

Based on your settings, you have the ATR-based levels "Enabled" which in turn "Disable" the Pip-levels.

--- 帖子 #882 ---
Actually the EA is running at my PC at work (so I am running it during work hours only as I mentioned earlier in the thread).

However, I will setup one here at my laptop and post it.

Just give me 5 minutes.

--- 帖子 #883 ---
This from my memory, I downloaded the settings from post # 718

with modifications of few settings (which I think I mentioned on weekly basis).

btw, last and this week I increased the variable lot size % to 2% instead of 1%.

As you see, I don't have a final satisfying settings yet, I am just forward testing and evaluate on weekly basis.

The objective is to get reasonable number of trades with reasonable RR.

I wish that you guys do the same and share your findings.

All the best,

As per my continuous  observations, the Cross Trader is "ungenerous", even when running on 14 pairs on M5 time frame.

Very few trades in the week.

This comes by nature, because we are looking for a correlation divergence which rarely happens, on major moves.
I am stopping my self from testing in on M15/M1, with small TP, as a scalper, although very tempting. But I think the spread will kill it.

I am also still very interested in the complement of the cross trader idea, "the Majors Trader".
Where for example we trade EURUSD & USDJPY based on EURJPY movement.
If EURJPY is UP we by both EURUSD & USDJPY.

--- 帖子 #888 ---
definitely  has potential

--- 帖子 #889 ---
I dont know if the logic behind this idea will hold, if the EURJPY is up it is because of 1 of two things..
a. JPY is strong EUR is weak or sleeping,
b. EUR is strong JPY is weak or sleeping.

So if for instance it is the EUR that is asleep or weak, buying the EURUSD might prove unwise.

I was thinking of finding a way to determine which currency is in control in any selected pair:

My idea is: When (EURUSD -- up & GBPUSD -- up) USD is weak & in control, so we check if this is occurring > (EURJPY -- dn & GBPJPY -- dn) JPY is strong & in control

If both happen, we SELL USDJPY asap.

Just thinking out loud

--- 帖子 #890 ---
Your idea is based on currency's strength/weakness, and to work properly it is better to get applied to all pairs related to our pair.

For example, to Sell USDJPY, All other JPY pairs should be down, AND (EURUSD, GBPUSD, AUDUSD, NZDUSD) should be up and (USDCAD, USDCHF) should be down.

Which is the basic concept of buying the strongest against the weakest, or selling the weakest against the strongest. Many indicators and systems were built around this concept.

The major drawback is the LATE entry.

I am also thinking out loud !

--- 帖子 #891 ---
by Buying both EURUSD and USDJPY in my example, we are hedging USD.

With TIMED entry and PROPER Money Management we can catch the true mover.

--- 帖子 #895 ---
Ooops .

No it should be M30 not H1.

So this is why it didn't open many trades.

I will fix the template now.

Thanks for the heads up.

--- 帖子 #896 ---
No probs mate! :-)

so is the signal 30 mins and the higher time frame is 1 hour still? :-)

--- 帖子 #897 ---
Yes.

--- 帖子 #898 ---
Hi abokwaik

How many trades do you have by week on GBPJPY 5 mn ?

Regards.

--- 帖子 #899 ---
3 trades.

Noting that it runs < 8 hours a day, and Signal Time Frame is M30, trading TF M5 and Max Orders 1.

With these settings (max order 1) it is actually trading the M30 not M5 because it opens 1 trade only on M5 which is = 1 trade on M30.

This feature is useful if you for example are having the Daily as a Signal TF, and you Attach it to H4 and allow 3-6 Max Orders.

--- 帖子 #900 ---
OK thanks

--- 帖子 #901 ---
Hi Khalil,

I am still trying to grasp the logic of the EA entirely. Forgive me if you have explained this before but I dont recall:

If you are essentially trading the 30M TF, what is the benefit of running it on the 5M?

Best,

--- 帖子 #902 ---
Main Signal Type : Long or Short depends on the Signal Time Frame, where the EA evaluates the Component Pairs, for example if we are trading GBPJPY the Signal will be derived from GBPUSD and USDJPY on the SIGNAL TIME FRAME.

While (1.) Entry Timing (2.) Entry Frequency depends on the TRADING TIME FRAME (the tf the EA is attached to).

Because some filters depends on the Traded Pair time frame (those start with Cross Pair ... in the EA Inputs).

For example :

If Signal TF is set to M30, and EA is attached to M5.

AND

GBPUSD is UP and USDJPY is UP (based on number of bars, other enabled indicators (RSI, CCI ... etc))

THEN we have a LONG Signal coming from the COMPONENT PAIRS

NOW

Should we take it or not, DEPENDS on what other filters are enabled on the CROSS PAIR,

For example if you enabled : "Cross Pair MA Period (0 to disable)" input and set it to 26, and "Max Pips/Points to MA, 0 to disable" to 200 points (20 pips)

NOW

Suppose at the start of the M30 candle which gave the signal, the price was over 20 pips above MA26.

Accordingly the EA will DISREGARD the SIGNAL and not take the BUY.

SUPPOSE after the 3rd M5 Candle on GBPJPY the price went below MA26

THEN the EA will take the BUY (because we are still under the same M30 Candle that gave the Long Signal)

SO instead of taking the BUY on the start of M30 when the price was far from the MA we took it after 15 minutes when the price retraced a bit.

I hope this clear,

Khalil

--- 帖子 #903 ---
That was about (1.) ENTRY TIMING

Now to (2.) ENTRY FREQUENCY

Entry Frequency will be activated if you set the "Max Open Trades" larger that 1.

SUPPOSE in the previous example we set it to 2.

We opened the first BUY on the 4th M5 candle,

NOW if the price is still < 20 pips from the MA26,

DEPENDING on the "Entry Type" :Averaging : the EA will open the second BUY on the 5th Candle if the its open price is less that the first BUY open price Pyramiding:the EA will open the second BUY on the 5th Candle if the its open price is higher that the first BUY open price Both : the EA will open the second BUY on the 5th Candle regardless

--- 帖子 #904 ---
Hey @tibovwh , Are you following ?

--- 帖子 #905 ---
Hehe, thx for the detailed post. I think I am following.

But with the .set template: There is no CROSS filters nor "Max Open Trades" ?

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Therefor, it should be the same if it is run on 5M or on 30M? The Signal will be taken from the 30M Majors and entry taken on the open of the next 30M (Which is also the open of the next 5M after a signal?)

One more quick question: "Trailing Stop ATR Multiplier" only kicks in after it has moved ATR multiplier in favor and not immediatly. Is this intentional?

--- 帖子 #907 ---
Correct. In these specific settings, it doesn't make a difference.

--- 帖子 #908 ---
Hi Khalil,If I trade on the pair GBP / JPY with EA Yen_Trader_04_TS, I have set EA on all three pairs GBP / JPY, USD / JPY, GBP / JPY or one GBP / JPY?not deal with installing.

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #909 ---
If you enable "ATR-Based Levels", suppose ATR was 30 pips. And you set "Trailing Stop ATR Multiplier"  to 2, "Trailing Stop Shift" to 50 points (5 pips).

When price moves 65 (30x2+5) in your favor the Stop Loss is moved to open price.

When price reaches 70 pips in your favor, the Stop Loss will be moved 5 pips above open price.

When price reaches 85 pips in your favor, the Stop Loss will be moved 20 pips above open price.

And so on ...

--- 帖子 #910 ---
So the actual Signal is based on a price comparison for 2 majors. I know of two ways to calculate Momentum:

Eighter you use a lookback bars or you compare against a moving average.

How does the EA handle the input of both these settings?

Attached Image

furthermore:

High/Low Price means it takes the average of the High and Low 2 days ago and compares it with the average of the High and Low today?

Appreciate the information!

Best,

--- 帖子 #911 ---
Aah ok so the Shift parameter from the pips-based settings works for the ATR enabled too.

Will do some more testing. I want to try to focus a bit more on higher timeframes. Most people seem to be focused on scalping and shorter TF setups...

What do you personally think? Will D1 give enough opportunities?

--- 帖子 #912 ---
1. Loop Back bars, suppose its set to 2 on D1, on GBPJPY, and we are trading today (Wednesday):Close Price :LONG if GBPUSD Tuesday Closing Price is Higher than Monday Closing Price AND USDJPY Tuesday Closing Price is Higher than Monday Closing Price SHORT if GBPUSD Tuesday Closing Price is Lower than Monday Closing Price AND USDJPY Tuesday Closing Price is Lower than Monday Closing Price  High/LowLONG if GBPUSD Tuesday Closing Price is Higher than Monday High Price AND USDJPY Tuesday Closing Price is Higher than Monday High Price SHORT if GBPUSD Tuesday Closing Price is Lower than Monday Low Price AND USDJPY Tuesday Closing Price is Lower than Monday Low Price

2. Moving Average : Suppose we set to D1, SMA20, on GBPJPY and we are trading today (Wednesday):LONG if both (GBPUSD and USDJPY) Tuesday Closed above their respective D1/SMA20 SHORT if both (GBPUSD and USDJPY) Tuesday Closed below their respective D1/SMA20

one on GBP / JPY only.

Hi Khalil,

Enabling ATR based TP and SL seems to disable multiple orders per signal. Can somebody confirm that this is the case? Or am I doing smt wrong?

Best,

--- 帖子 #915 ---
You need to set also the "Min distance (ATR multiples) between orders" input.

--- 帖子 #916 ---
I tried multiple variations for this parameter but seemed to have no succes. Will test further tho

--- 帖子 #917 ---
Looking at the code, it seems that I didn't complete the development of this feature  (Max Orders + ATR_levels Enabled).

I will update the EA and post it.

--- 帖子 #918 ---
Here it is:

--- 帖子 #919 ---
Regarding the High/Low. It makes a lot of sense for 2 as input. Simply give a signal if Close[1] is > or < the High[2] / Low[2] for both pairs.

Suppose we set the input parameter higher to 5.

Now the EA will give a signal if Close[1] is > or < the High[5] / Low[5]. Is this correct? Problem is that this is pretty arbitrary I think?

Maybe a better rule would be if Close[1] is > or > the Highest[2-5] / Low[2-5] ? (= Both pairs breakout)

Let me know what you think

Best,

--- 帖子 #920 ---
Thanks so much. Very fast

--- 帖子 #921 ---
Hi abokwaik,

Just to confirm

you using the settings posted in the 889 post for attached explorer ?

and do use a trade manager ea ?, setting your risk to 2% daily for profits and losses ?

--- 帖子 #922 ---
When you set it to High/Low, the EA will work like this:
LONG if Close[1] is > the Highest[2-5] , SHORT if  Close[1] < Low[2-5]  (= Both pairs breakout)

--- 帖子 #923 ---
The set file is in post 892. But you will need to change the Signal Time Frame to M30 instead of H1.

This is not the usual risk%, it is only the percentage of balance used to calculate the variable lot size.

In the EA inputs it is called "Variable Lots as % of Balance".

Calculated lot size depends on account Balance & Required Margin. (SL is not considered).

--- 帖子 #924 ---
Aha ok great to know! Its pretty hard to infer this from the Strategy Tester as I dont see the actual Majors... From your post I just assumed... But this is perfect thx

Btw, I hope you dont mind I'm kind of spamming the thread but if I don't post this stuff immediatly I tend to move on and forget

Regards,

--- 帖子 #925 ---
You're welcome ...

I think such a Q&A is beneficial for understanding how the system/EA is working, specially for new comers

--- 帖子 #926 ---
I do agree with you, however, I have tested scalping with pips today on M1 and the results exceeded my expectations and initial ATR test on M5 by approx $600 (over $1400 profit in 4 months) with only $200 investment. My next test will be on M5 with pip settings and then I will be convinced that this is as great as I hoped it would be. My goal was to find a solid EA that could help small investors like me gradually turn a little money ($200-$500) into big money in a slow, steady, and consistant way. Opposed to the thinking that it takes big money to make money (big or small amounts). And THAT is why I am very much looking forward to the upgrades to the Close-All EA. I want to trade/scalp 2-3 pairs in a basket or 1% to close daily inorder to limit exposure. I think scalping might be (for me) the quickest way to get in and out very quickly.

And speaking of upgrades....I noticed you upgraded Cross Trader today. Should I do my tests again with the new update or does it not matter? And how soon can we expect the upgraded Close-All if u choose to do it?  Thanks Abokwaik!

BoHanna

--- 帖子 #927 ---
Sounds great Bohanna :-)

what setting did you use for the min charts for scalping that worked really well? :-)

--- 帖子 #928 ---
Khalil,

I've back tested Yen Trades in the past and posted here some results.

But now I'm with doubts how to back test Cross Trader.

Let's say for GBPJPY, for what pairs do I need to have historical data?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #929 ---
Hi kilion,

Cross Traded is an Expanded version of Yen Trader.

Yen Trader trades the 6 major yen crosses (eurjpy, gbpjpy, audjpy, nzdjpy, cadjpy and chfjpy)

while Cross Trader trades 21 major crosses including the yen crosses.

So it works the same way, it trades the cross pair based on the cross major currencies against USD.

Accordingly, to back test the Cross Trader on GBPJPY you will need history data for GBPJPY and GBPUSD and USDJPY.

--- 帖子 #930 ---
Upgrade to 6.44 if you want to enable ATR based levels and Max Orders > 1.

As for close-all-trades, what modifications are you expecting?

--- 帖子 #931 ---
Here are the settings. BUT please note the modeling quality is at 25% for M1 but when I test on M5 with same settings the quality improved to 90% which is not shown here. Test for yourself, this is why I understand where Khalil is coming from...I don't totally trust M1 tf for this pair for scalping but the results seemed amazing. In live trading I will most likely choose M5 because of modeling quality. I'd be happy with $900 bucks from just one pair than $1400 with questionable one ;-)

As far as modifications go......you mentioned on another post that you were gonna create a professional grade manager in near future or possibly integrate trade manager into Crosstrader itself (something to that affect). I personally would like to have added "No Trades on Friday" option (or any day of week) and the ability to hide SL and TP from broker. Or anything else that a broker could use to gain an edge on us "budget challenged" traders. Sorry I can't pinpoint past posts like u can but i think you get the gist of it. Hmmm...while I'm at it, a simple grid option to activate without hedging (optional, I'm USA remember) would be interesting. Thanks Khalil!

BoHanna

--- 帖子 #933 ---
Somebody will probably yell at me for this, but what does "modeling quality" mean?

Okay.  I just googled it and there's a bunch of stuff to read, so I'll do that...

--- 帖子 #934 ---
Whenever u optimize an EA you will also see modeling quality in statement. Another member always gets 99.9% quality. It's as close to live trading as u can get. look up his past testing posts. He is called nonliner

Gotta re-run test with latest version and re-download history to make sure I had this data before posting previous tests. I suggest u all do the same. Don't just take someone else word for it. Test, test, and re-test until YOU are satisfied with desired results. Only you know what you seek. And seek until you find it... Thanks for the reminder Abokwaik.

BoHanna

--- 帖子 #938 ---
I appreciate the help, BoHanna.

--- 帖子 #939 ---
Thanks for the reply :-)

Do you use signal 30 min and higher time frame 1 hour as well on your tests? Also have you found 300 pips SL and 700 pips TP the best results after testing different ones?

Thanks

Reubs :-)

--- 帖子 #940 ---
Yes. I make a point to test 1M to 1HR signals as well as higher timeframe signals (up to Daily) when I optimize. Surprisingly, 1HR signal is usually the winner. I look at largest profit, lowest DD, and lowest profit factor. And also, the number of trades because I want to fill the basket (daily target) with a few pairs within hours, not days. I like this EA because of its low DD and you can make money on almost any signal timeframe. It's a matter of personal preference as to how much you want to make and your level of patience. I'm still new to the game but after three years of practicing I'll never forget the advice of a software vendor who said "Don't get greedy". Hope that answered your question. Have a great weekend!

BoHanna

Your welcome, anytime

I've been back testing Cross Trader at 99,9% quality (for what is worth).

I manage great results in 2016, but continue without finding settings that work for 2015.

As there is no way to say that conditions in the next months won't be similar to 2015, it's a too great risk to use this EA live (at least until someone finds better settings or EA is tweaked).

--- 帖子 #943 ---
Thanks kilion.

With regard to using it live, I prefer forward testing over back testing.

I didn't use it live yet, and will need to complete a 3-months forward test with 300 trades at least.

--- 帖子 #944 ---
Thanks a lot for the replies, you're very helpful :-)

so I guess my last question is are you using the trade manager along side the cross trader to close all trades at a certain trade profit or just set pips and individual closes?

Thanks again

Reubs

--- 帖子 #945 ---
For now just set pips and individual closes. I will start using trade manager with two or three pairs next week. I will test with EURCHF next. Something tells me there's a gold mine in there. I will let u know which pairs meet my daily target the fastest. I'm not greedy, just seeking a certain level of consistency.

--- 帖子 #946 ---
Your work and kindness to share are truly appreciated!

I'm just impressed, one more time, at how this Forex thing is complicated.

You had a great idea and put it working at Cross Trader.

But the back test results are what they are (again for what they are worth, that is never clear).

Just worried that if back test results are reliable and your 3 month tests get conditions like 1st half of 2016, but them conditions change to similar to 2015 when going live, it will be unfortunate.

His there any way to analyse and categorize conditions? What changed in market behavior?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #947 ---
IMO, it is a system that should be adjusted for current conditions.  Settings and possibly even TF's should adapt monthly.  I stopped trying to find settings that perform well over long periods of time (5 years), and instead focus on settings that work now but are not overly curve fit.  Not easy to do, a ton of work.

--- 帖子 #948 ---
BT with settings from your post, on M5 chart / M30 signal, that for what I understand is similar to your present TE:

2014

Forex IS complicated.

When you open a Pizza restaurant you're competing with the restaurants in your block.

When you trade forex you're competing with the Whole World.

No automated system can prosper in all market conditions on the long run.

So we have to adapt to current market conditions as fast as we can.

Yes, a live run may fail. For this, there should be a max allowed draw down before shutting off the system.

Sometimes, the fruit lies not in the system tested,, but in the experience gained.

I can not tell you how much I benefited from Yen and Cross Traders, which opened the way for more systems to come.

Had to restore my computer to a previous date tonight. No fault to Abokwaiks latest download. I just didn't know what was going on this past week. I will download it again after this mess is cleared up. I think my protection software was fighting each other and I ended up losing with system freezes/crashes from their latest updates. Either that or my broker could see the progress I was making with Abokwaiks EA and got jealous. LOL. Maybe my broker crashed me? (who knows)! I gotta call them tomorrow to verify some info so I can get back up running and testing. Good night and good trading...ABOKWAIK, you are STILL THE MAN! Keep up the great work!

Hey Khalil,

how are things going?

Your trade explorer is looking good, want to understand how you are closing your trades. I am running the same settings but 24x7 full auto and see that we are having different results.

Are you closing manually and I remeber you saying you were only running it during the day, can you please give me some more insight into how you running the MT4 attached to this account?

thanks allot.

--- 帖子 #963 ---
Hello Sir, Abokwaik!

My question for you is....

Is it possible to add chart timeframes (M1 to Daily) to EA for optimazation or do we have to set individual chart timeframe for each optimization? For example, I set my chart at M1 and begin optimization with M1 to Daily signals and higher timeframe signals as well. Is it necessary to start next optimization on M5 chart and changing upper timeframe settings? Or is it best to change chart timeframes with best settings beginning at M1 optimization? Hope that makes sense.

BoHanna

I'm back up and testing. Here is a modest result from my recent pip test on v6.43. I will download latest v6.44 again and expect to get same results but will focus on ATR settings since it is fixed now. This pair trades a few times a week but is steady. Scalping would probably be better with the majors but the residual of Khalil's 21 pairs from the majors should be pretty consistent. You might have to increase deposit to trade more pairs inorder to make more money. My settings below are a good start for anyone to resume testing. Good Luck!

Unfortunately no, because time frames do not come with a fixed step size (1, 5, 15, 30 ...) so the variance (step) between tfs is variable (4, 10, 15 ... etc) which can not be mapped into the tester as "Step".

My terminal tester spread is set to 30 and my pre-set spread is set to 80 for future forward testing. Dont use current spread, instead use 30. It tells the EA not to trade above 30. In forward demo it means not to trade higher than 80 spread. I may just decrease that to 40 myself. It's worth another test....but I hope you get the idea.

--- 帖子 #983 ---
By the way, when I post graphs and reports...that's all there is. Nothing else to report. Just try to copy exactly what is reported. I use a 5 digit broker. If that makes a difference then Abokwaik would be more qualified to answer that question. And my timeframe is GMT-5. I'm just throwing darts right now because I know my settings work for me and I want them to work for you too.

Welcome back, I was trying to help cjtylor. Any suggestions? Oh, and the coffee is on the house

--- 帖子 #985 ---
That is my open orders from this morning.

--- 帖子 #986 ---
Since you're looking for suggestions, nonlinear mentioned something about looking for the most adverse conditions under which the EA performs badly that way one can record when the EA is out of its limits and intervene and also look for remedies to its weakness (es).

This should be the real aim of backtesting IMHO. Optimizing is for the short term.

In short look for adverse conditions where the EA is consistently bad. Post screen shots of the trades taken and let the brilliant minds here use their creativity in abokwaiks terms

--- 帖子 #987 ---
Hi Sinqua,

Just not sure I follow you. I backtest and optimize to eliminate the adverse conditions or at least minimize them. That's what the tester is for. A screenshot is worth a thousand words when the question may be as simple as "Are you trading on a pair while the spread is at 200 but your set is at 50?" Hmmm...

--- 帖子 #988 ---
In other words...a chart screenshot is not enough information to diagnose the problem. My settings are for GJ only so you can imagine that it takes time to test all 21 pairs. That's why everyone's input/testing is encouraged. Hope that made sense.

BoHanna

--- 帖子 #991 ---
To Botan626,

It is not a stupid question. Just wish I remembered the post to refer you to because, honestly, people get tired of answering these types of questions. NEVER BE AFFRAID TO ASK.

I trust you already downloaded the EA. The next step is to put it in the MQL expert folder in your Data Folder file in MT4. Place, copy/or drag it into data folder. Now, close the MetaTrader and re-open it. You should see the downloaded EA in navigator list. Next step is to drag/or double click onto chart you want to trade. Hope that helped. If you already did this, then I suggest being patient. If you are testing GBPJPY like most of us then you will find that it only trades a few times a day depending on your timeframe settings. It can get complicated but the important thing is that you are up and running and can begin testing/learning. Good luck!

Are you using pip or ATR settings? Sounds like too many variables. If u are using default settings then you might want to cut them in half or quarters. Also, try 30mn with 1hr htf. And always try to appeal to Abokwaik first. This man is a genius in my book.

Do you still use the close all trades ea?

Let it ride and learn from this experience.

--- 帖子 #1002 ---
May be you do not follow, it is good to backtest but EA's no matter how optimized will fail at some point...that is what you want to look for? People normally look for rising equity curves and optimize to achieve that, it gives a sense of success but a business focuses on cutting its losses more so backtest

search nonlinear's post here's a quote

"That question is forever debated it seems. First, my personal view is that I want to see the conditions under which the expert does not do well so I know when to shut it down. Everyone wants to look at the good results but the learning is in the poor results."

And I said "Let it ride and learn from this experience."

I apologize for such short response because I had an experience a few months ago whereas I was trapped in a loss for over a week that would take a good chunk of my previous months profits and I was concerned about a stop out. So I asked for advice similar to yours because I wanted to know if I should close trades, cut losses, and start over. Two wise people agreed that "if you got the balls to wait it out" it should correct itself and that closing the trades and starting over should be the last resort. So "I let it ride" and waited it out. A week later it closed in profit and made up for all previous losses. Wish u good trading Veslup.

At the moment is very well. But my observation is that this bot running well in London sesion. Every time in red news hit the SL. So my opinion is to start LO and close NY open and before strong news as well. 270 dolars for few hours is very very good for me.

Hi giangiforex

as per Abokwaik we have to trade only 14 pair. I am starting from 01.09.2016 with 1000 USD but still not positiv balance.

--- 帖子 #1024 ---
i don't know why you have not positive balance

i'm starting from 22 juli with firt version yen trader

with yen trader i have not positive balance

but with cross trader I recovered the losses

--- 帖子 #1025 ---
All the time during impact news I think 3 time's after positive hit all stop loss. Do you EA trade 24 hr ?

--- 帖子 #1026 ---
veslup,

In the post #548 Abokwaik talks about 21 cross pairs.

Could you show me the post where it's said about 14 pairs?

--- 帖子 #1027 ---
Can you see here on the top CT6.43 14-pairs M30/M5 2%risk | Demo Account XXXXXXX80

--- 帖子 #1028 ---
Yes, I saw that. But where did he specify them?

If you click on Trade Report, you will see 16 pairs as Instruments.

Other settings the same.

I also reduced the pairs to 14 instead of 20.

I'm just curious.....when a person is ready to go live and use real money, are they actually able to invest the amounts they are using in their Demo accounts; ie, $5-$10,000 or more? I'm seriously gonna continue to invest up to only $500 bucks. That's why I demo/test with only small amounts. Is this true for anyone else? Or is it just a fun hobby? Or maybe u actually have thousands you can afford to lose? Like I said, I'm Just curious... afterall, anyone of us in this forum could already be a millionaire  Trade well,

Removed EUR/GBP, CAD/CHF and CHF/JPY in Demotest as this are the worst performing pairs.

--- 帖子 #1045 ---
Perhaps please consider to make a version of your tool that uses the USD rather than the Yen. Having both may offer very high probability trades. For example if Usd is strong against the Yen Plus all or most other pairs and Pound is Weak against the Usd et. al. Pretty simple idea really, but since USD is a benchmark perhaps it should be far superior in performance, considering both sides of the whole picture.  Seekin goportunities for trading cross pairs would be the goal.  for example GJ, EJ etc.. It would be like the double gap on seroids.  Just an idea. Thanks

Will update next Thursday again

Was thinking of running the EA just in the london session ?

Abokwaik mention he runs the EA during his working hours...

--- 帖子 #1049 ---
my thought was the opposite. To trade the EJ based on eu and uj plus overall strength, or trade gj, once condidition of  gu and uj Plus overall strength is obtained... I'm sure you know this but correlation is not strength... drives me crazy when people use that term loosely. Correlation simply measures the amount of togetherness, not how strng its moving.  Forgive my pet peeve, but adding some sort of actual correlation, wither positive or negative,  in addition to strength as a second condition of trading is an idea to consider., that has been around a long while. FWIW

--- 帖子 #1050 ---
Another nice EA from Abok. EA is not something that you set and forget. It needs manual intervention all the time in order to make most out of it.

I am testing this EA since some time and analysing result daily and weekly. It's impressive result so far.

1) I am seeing draw down because of high impact news (ISM,NFP) like other reported too. I have two deeper dips because of ISM and NFP.

2) No Trade before 9am on Monday and After 12 on Friday would make difference too.

All filter it needs when not to trade now and manage during news time or stay out of it.

I am running on VPS and added same account on phone mt4 with push notification on. Once at work don't have access to VPS. Is it possible for you to split this EA into two please if you could?

First Split EA:

Same as now but only add Monday start time and Friday end time with One Global variable - Trading (this trading variable can be set false from other EA). Once time filter is in this EA then you can backtest with time as well.

Second Split EA: Close_at_News (open source)

This EA have ff calendar alert before 30min with push alert. it set Trading Global variable = false and disable that trading before/after news 30mins. Why open source? because i can add some more function like when i open DAX micro sell order from mobile then it close all open order. So it becomes like semi-auto EA. Trade open from VPS and manage from mobile basically

I would like to dig deeper and deeper in this EA until it shows consistent result with your help.

Thanks again - AK

--- 帖子 #1051 ---
yeah i also think that it would be even more powerful if there were two versions running, the yen version + the usd version... then perhaps we'd really see more of the true strength of the market, since usd is benchmark & the yen ea of the thread gives strength measurement from a second angle, namely using the yen as the benchmark really a great idea but potentially would be really better to develop it further

2 cents

a double gap with yen as benchmark + a double gap with usd as benchmark =multiplied probability of a good trade

no

--- 帖子 #1052 ---
The above mentioned idea's are good. I would still like to see "No trades on Friday" option and "no trade on news" as well....

But the main reason for my post tonight is to share new settings with you all. I've found another setting that appears very consistent (it works on M1 as well) but the results are basically the same (give or take a few bucks). This test was just over 4 1/2 months and the payoff is relatively small using small deposit. But since I know most of you will be trading up to 14 pairs and using deposits from $1-$10K, I thought you might find this useful. Instead of $20/trade profit you would probably make $100+/per trade with just this one pair as long as the spread remains reasonable. Just increase/decrease the TP to find what works best for you. I'm done testing this one for a while. I will use different scalping methods/EA's for Abokwaik's suggested 14-21 pairs. Hope this helps...

Any one have traded Yen and Gold in correlation.  I get fair results during past 2 months. During this time market was ranging not trending may be that's why I get fair results. Can any one guide me how to trade them.

--- 帖子 #1054 ---
What I meant is adjust the lot size from .01 to .1 and you will see a %100 increase in profit. Approx. $200 per trade on $10K account.

Hi BoHanna,

Please share your .set file

--- 帖子 #1058 ---
Cross Trader is using the Majors (USD pairs) to trade the Minors (non-USD pairs).

For example when the EA is attached to EURGBP (minor) it will trade it based on both EURUSD and GBPUSD (majors), when EURUSD is UP and GBPUSD is DOWN a Buy is triggered, when EURUSD is DOWN and GBPUSD is UP a Sell is triggered, when both are UP or DOWN no trade is taken.

Don't get confused by the first EA and Thread name  (Yen Trader). The original versions (named Yen Trader) are using the same concept but were limited to Yen Crosses, while the later versions (named Cross Trader) trade all crosses including Yen crosses.

--- 帖子 #1059 ---
Actually the Major Trader will not be easy to implement.

For example if we want to trade GBPUSD, which crosses should we consider ?

All GBP Crosses : EURGBP, GBPJPY, GBPAUD, GBPCAD, GBPCHF, GBPNZD.

and All USD Crosses (which happen to be majors themselves) : EURUSD, USDJPY, AUDUSD, NZDUSD, USDCAD, USDCHF

Now should we compare each related crosses : EURGBP x EURUSD, GBPJPY x USDJPY ... etc.

or we take the whole currency basket ?

both options will require a smart scoring system.

it is very interesting to test, but requires a lot of work.

--- 帖子 #1060 ---
I totally agree with your 2 notes, specially the news filter.

As one thing leads to another, the news filter let me dig deeper into news trading, which deviated my interest from the cross trader at least until I finish the news expert which I believe will be extraordinary.

--- 帖子 #1061 ---
Such a good EA

--- 帖子 #1062 ---
It can work, however should be excluded when major news come out and during Asian session.

--- 帖子 #1063 ---
You can download the text file posted on page 49. Same page that u quoted me from. As I said before the trades are not frequent but since most are trading so many pairs it shouldn't matter because when it trades it usually wins. Consider it a bonus for your patience

--- 帖子 #1064 ---
" ... etc. or we take the whole currency basket ? both options will require a smart scoring system." That's where u come in  A smart guy to figure out a smart scoring system. Take your time and simply tell yourself before you go to bed at night to find a viable solution (like a silent prayer) and let your subconscience take over. Then one day soon you will wake up from a pleasant dream and say "AHAA! I got it!". Just try to keep a pen and paper on the nightstand or laptop nearby because it happens very unexpectantly (epifany). By the way... Good to see you again.

One major pitfall of CrossTrader is profit taking.

Yesterday trades reached a profit peak of 10% before going down to -2%.

--- 帖子 #1067 ---
I've been working on a new profit taking technique that I plan to apply to my systems including the CrossTrader.

Profit Taking Techniques (applies to all EAs).

1. Single Pair : Take partial profit on each new low break (for sell trades) and on each new high break (for buy trades).

This technique assumes that each new low/new high could become support.

Highs and Lows will be determined using ZigZag indicator.

Number of profit taking levels can be set as input parameter, along with the starting point of profit taking (i.e. on 1:1 RR).

So for example if we set the levels to 10, and the lot size was 0.65, and SL is 50 Pips.

The EA will start to take partial profits after the price moves over 50 pips in our favor.

1st close : 1 tenth of the original lot size (0.06).

2nd close :1 tenth of the remaining lot size. (i.e. remaining lot size = 0.65 - 0.06 = 0.59) so 0.06 will be closed (rounded).

3rd close :1 tenth of the remaining lot size. (i.e. remaining lot size = 0.59 - 0.06 = 0.53) so 0.05 will be closed (rounded).

4th close :1 tenth of the remaining lot size. (i.e. remaining lot size = 0.53 - 0.05 = 0.48) so 0.05 will be closed (rounded).

5th close :1 tenth of the remaining lot size. (i.e. remaining lot size = 0.48 - 0.05 = 0.43) so 0.04 will be closed (rounded).

And so on ...

At the end of the profit taking levels, the remaining position can be trailed until stop.

Partial Profit is taken When price breaks the previous zigzag low (for sell) or high (for buy) .

By using ZigZag as profit taking trigger the EA will be closer to Price Action and utilize dynamic profit levels instead of rigid ones.

--- 帖子 #1068 ---
Profit Taking Techniques (applies to all EAs).

2. Basket :

This is a bit complicated.

In Basket profit taking, some trades could be in loss while other trades are in profit.

So do we close partial positions from both types, or profit ones only ?

What about treating the basket as one pair ?

I choose to treat the basket as one pair.

Issues with basket profit taking:

1. Trades are opened at different times, and continue to open regardless wither the basket is in profit or loss.

2. No chart for the basket to apply indicators like zigzag.

Basket profit taking can start when we reach 1:1 RR on the whole basket (regardless of individual trades).

Then we start to track peaks and valleys on current P/L, something similar to zigzag.

For the basket we will not use individual trades TP/SL. For this method the EA should be running 24H.

For example, if the calculated basket 1:1 RR is 5%. Note that with each new order opened this value will change.

We wait until 5% is reached, and we start to track fluctuations on profit %. Suppose we set partial profit on each additional 1% increase on profit up to 10 levels.

So once profit reaches 6% we close 1 tenth of all positions (regardless in  profit or loss).

We continue to do that on each 1% increase on equity.

The last remaining positions , after 10 levels are completed, can be trailed at 1%.

--- 帖子 #1069 ---
Sounds like a plan to me. Go for it. A lil profit here and there instead of waiting for entire closure couldn't hurt.

BoHanna (sleep on it)

--- 帖子 #1070 ---
Same story repeated yesterday where profit reached 8.5% before retreating to -4%.

Clrealy the EA has a very good max return to max draw down. The edge would be on the exit.

--- 帖子 #1071 ---
@abokwaik 8.5% profits reached... do you compare that % to your account size ?

if so, for the cross trader ea can you add a trade manager function  in to close all trades at a certain % profits or losses ?

--- 帖子 #1072 ---
Yes 8.5% return on account size.

I was using a trade manager and things were good, then recently I let the EA run alone to see how good/bad it can get, which will give an indication on suitable closure % in profit or loss to be used in the trade manager, OR, use dynamic profit taking as I posted earlier.

--- 帖子 #1073 ---
I'm running the ea on a live cent account and 80% + of the trades will run nicely into profits , but then turn into losers.

Running the trade manager will be a good addition ,but like you said its just finding the correct % to use.

Assalamuallaikum Khalil, sorry maybe this post is out of topic, I want to ask you about your Big Candle EA, are you still welcome for new idea on that EA?

--- 帖子 #1077 ---
Alaikumossalam Hirangan,

Why not. I am always open to new ideas.

Kindly post your thoughts directly on the Big Candle thread, and I will see you there.

--- 帖子 #1078 ---
Thank you for coding it. You have always encouraged good ideas

It's a very interesting tool to do forward-testing. I will use micro-lots to test your EA on 14 pairs and find out which of the pairs can really hit it big with brokers offering leverage of 1:888 (Chinese lucky numbers) .

Micro-lot traders can get up to 800 pips for each $1 equity - calculated based on 888 leverage offered by a few brokers and deducting from it minimum initial margin amount and minimum distance for placing TP or SL . Some brokers open account for as less as $5 deposit.

Micro-lot account will facilitate testing position sizing methods .

I am sharing here my drawdown management system which can be used as a "set and forget" trading strategy for one planning with deep pockets (whether in cents or dollars).

So the tool will have two roles to play - trader and risk manager.

I request you to code a drawdown management tool to work on similar lines that of the attached indicator.  I hope it does not take much of your time for it has been re-coded by a veteran programmer-cum-trader Igor.

If it is modified as an indicator then it can work with this EA on the same chart and can show the progress both for the trade and risk management in real-time and quite graphically.

My selection of trade and drawdown management is presently done manually:

1. (a) Risk factor: I normally put trading margin as 150% of the pip distance (between the extreme high and low of the 120-day period ) chosen by me by using immediate lookback period or the one linked to particular dates and years in the past.

(a) Selection of symbol: I will use multi-currency dashboard to find out high low points of 20 weekly bars back. Depending on the buffer margin I can afford I will chose the symbol if it shows regular range-trading pattern or seasonal pattern.

if I think say from October USD/CAD will turn bullish because of less oil demand in the winter I will check last 10 years October to December pattern and establish a seasonal pattern. If 80% of the 10 years, the pair has moved up during this period, I will go for this trade.

Selection requires study. Good indicators are there to help you out in saving time. I am a discretionary trader.

(b) Selection of distance of pips between the high and low of the period based on my capital affordability , trading strategy and risk management. How much can I afford to lose, is the main criteria for my trading. How much can I make is not on my mind. So TP is not fixed. As and when depending on the volatility, news event and directional view, I take profit.

(c) I only plan plan for handling losses because I never use stop loss. So adverse trade management is the critical component of my trading plan.

(d) For risk management, I only use constant lot , averaged at a distance of (high-low of 120 days/divided by 8) to reduce break-even. I have always trade two currency pairs - EURUSD and GBPJPY. In both cases maximum time taken for the constant lot position to reduce breakeven level has been 60 days. If I can have buffer margin to handle 60 days volatility I am doing alright.

Now I want to try using progressive lots so that the breakeven point can be reduced in faster time. With progressive lots it will be easier to break even if 50% Fibo level is considered. In such a case the breakeven or profit can be achieved by using varying lots.

2. Show me the average entry indicator ( attached) gives me a visual picture by showing on the chart Average Buy Entry, Market Entry and Sell Entry and the profit or loss in pips/percentage as a shadow. This indicator has been re-coded by veteran trader Igor.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

3. If you can modify the indicator or (develop an EA) by incorporating additional inputs and Chart printing capability, it will be a good simple trade and margin management tool.

(a) Total pips to be used for trading: Example: 1000

(b) No of lots to use: example 10

(c) Constant lot or Varying (not necessarily progressive) Lot:

(d) If select constant lot, the risk factor selected will be 1.

(e) If select Varying Lot risk factor will vary and so risk factor has to be input for each lot.

If no of lots selected is 10 then show 10 risk factor inputs

(f) Stop loss: pips input by user - Stop loss limit order will be executed in trading account .

All stop limit orders generated (for constant lot or progressive lot) and for Stop Loss will be shown on the chart.

(g) Breakeven Profit : Input for Pips or % to be added to cumulative breakeven point.

Averaging Entries linked to Market Entry will be shown with a shadow on the chart just like the indicator shows.

(d) Average Buy Entry

(e) Market Entry

(f) Sell Entry

Profit Mode input in the indicator shows: 0 (No figure) 1 for pips 2 for percentage.

If the indicator can print Breakeven Profit line (which will move with the shadow) it will be excellent.

This visual tool will provide a real-time emotional and risk management tester. Micro lot account will be ideal for testing.

i wish to compliment you for helping out traders here. I hope you will find some time for me too.

--- 帖子 #1083 ---
ok, i got it. thank you very much.

Does "Close at News" mean the same as "No trades during News"? In other words...will it close trades whether in loss/profit when news hits or will it simply not open any new trades til after news while leaving current trade open? If so, is there a timeframe included to stop/resume trading before or after news? I haven't downloaded the EA yet, just wanted to know before I do. Thanks!

Why Close_at_News EA Plug in? - I am running EA on VPS and nowhere nearby my laptop at trading working hours. Still i want to manage from mobile mt4 like i am in front of PC. I am trying to be clever here.

Abok added trading hours and Global Variable for me and i am using same Global variable/ Magic no in Close_at_News Plug-in.

1) All button are self-explanatory. Start/Pause/Close all - if you are in front of PC

2) Sell UK100 (any lot size) and it will close all open trades including loss/profit and including UK100 opened trade and disable trading until next day.

3) Buy UK100 (any lot size) and it will resume trading again after closing uk100 buy order.

I add alarm for red news on mobile and sell uk100 microlot before 30min and it will close all open trades and disable trading on server. After red news 30min, i buy uk100 microlot and it will resume trading. i do this from mobile manually and it can be automated using FFCAL and other news indicator and it can be integrated straight in EA. It serve my purpose at this moment but that is plan to integrate news in near future as time permit, unless someone do it before me.

Abok can use this Plug-in EA for two way communication for his any upcoming EA for giving some of control to user without disclosing code. FF Community can extend this Plug-in by adding extra feature as needed and can be used with any EA. Most of code used in this Plug-in is from Abok's other EA.

--- 帖子 #1087 ---
Thanks AK, I don't use mobile at this time but I see how it can be very useful. My thinking was to have no NEW trades open up to 2hrs before news and resume trades up to 30m-1hr afterwards as I am away from my PC as well and only trade a few pairs at a time. I kinda like to see how they "ride out the storm" so to speak without the hassle of new open trades and possible false signals. My losses are usually small unless I get "trapped" and we all know that sucks. Thanks again, AK!

You're my new Idol man! such a talented coder and fx lover! I'm new for this game but highly interested in your idea and the EA in this thread even though it does not generate much signals.

Could you pls give me the source code of v.6.45 in order to dig it in a little more? I'm not a professional coder but I just want to tweak it a bit to see what more can this EA do if you don't mind. It's just for personal use and your credits will be fully respected.
