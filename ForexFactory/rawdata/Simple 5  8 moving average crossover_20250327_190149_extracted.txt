I have been using a strategy for a few months now. It is very simple and I have followed the rules exactly. Its certainly not holy grail but it has made me some nice pips over the last few months.

I use the 5 EMA and 8 EMA crossover on the daily chart. For the stop loss I use the low or high for the previous day (depending on if we are or short). Alternatively if this is too close or too far away, so the risk/reward ratio would be too low, I draw fib lines on the daily chart and trendlines to try and pickout important support and resistance points and place the stops at these. I always give priority to points where the market has bounced previous. I usually place the stop just above or below these points.

I have used it on these pairs: NZD/JPY, GBP/JPY and GBP/USD. It has worked best on these pairs in the past.

For the take profit, I trail it, usually by 50 pips on nzd/jpy , 100 on GBP/JPY and 50 on GBP. It loves trending markets but doesnt work to well in ranging markets, however as I used strategic stops and tps, The losses have been very small when the market ranges, sometimes even a small profit. On the plus side it has picked up and rode some nice trends. I picked up the first part of the major carry unwinding on gbp/jpy and nzd/jpy for some very very nice pips, A nice gain on equity whilst not risking too much. I had the sell signal on GBP/USD but that one got stopped out at +2 pips.

ive used 5/8 for about 4yrs..works great..you should try with channels ..and force/snakewithborders indi..you can find quite a few indicators to help with trending and stoplosses

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Here're the indicators:

--- 帖子 #4 ---
oops forgot to mention...8open 5close  is what you really want to set it at.. JMA/Jaimo is even better at those settings than EMA

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Great, nice to hear someone else having success with it. Do you use channels for stops and take profit ?

I am starting to believe even very simple strategies can work nicely in the longer term if applied with tight risk management.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Thanks so much for those banzai.. very helpful indeed :-)

--- 帖子 #7 ---
What time frame do you use?

--- 帖子 #8 ---
daily time frame

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Thanks.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
I agree, simplicity sometimes is the best solution. A lot of people keep trading smaller time frames and keep getting burned.

Longer time frames are the best. No wonder most professional traders use only daily charts. I know that UBS traders do that for example. I work at UBS (not as a trader and not in Forex) and sometimes I talk over the phone with top forex people at the company in Zurich. They only work with daily charts, support and resistance levels and a few more indicators. Nothing fancy, basic simple stuff.

The 5/8 emas work very well when it trends, less when it ranges. But what indicator works well on ranging markets anyways, right ? If the markets were always trending we would all be filthy rich by now. The problem with trading, no matter what (stocks, commodities. forex etc.) is when the market ranges, period. That's when most profit obtained while it was trending are burned and the you start all over again.

Funny how most new threads here promising for the best system yet last a few months until they all start to realize that 'hey, in the long run it will not work.' Why ? 'Cause of the ranging times...

Hopefully everybody gets to understand that and stop hoping for the holy grail.

Even trading news has its "ranging" moments: that's when a news does not move the currency in the expected direction. How many times that has happened, and people go all crazy saying things like "well, it is going down because you see, the news was good, but not as good as it was expected and plus yesterday John Doe said that this and this therefore I think that people were hoping for......blah blah blah"

It is all BS, all pure BS. Systems come and go (look at Vegas) and people still look for the next best thing. When will they learn ?

Keep it simple and you might have a chance at it, but you will never, EVER become filthy rich at it, especially when you start with little capital.

I might sound mean and negative but we all know it is the truth, otherwise we wouldn't be here looking for new magical systems all the times.

If, after realizing that, you still want to play with it, then enjoy the ride and have fun ! Only when you eliminate all that financial pressure you can really have fun at it and see charts in a different way.

your negativity sucks.  sorry to hear you LOST at the game of Forex.  maybe something else would be better for you

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Looks like you are a great reader...

I am actually having a great time trading and I've been enjoying it even more since taking the "realistic approach" and abandoning the "holy grail exist" one.

You may wanna read things a couple times more before you start replying, just a suggestion...

Mr. Future

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Well MrFuture, for what its worth, I tend to agree with you as regards the simplistic outlook on trading. In all my years of intimacy with the markets, and the numerous systems, and courses, methodologies, complex or whatever... I always seem to go back to the second method I ever used (one MA and stochs) which, incidentally, has been the most successful overall FOR ME. Still is. I usually use it to confirm other methods.

But this will not stop me from prowling these forums because I really enjoy checking out other peoples' efforts and there are some good ones here.

So in a nutshell, yes I agree with you and I'm in the 'simple' camp. But because I read these and other systems, it doesn't make me a loser.

Btw nice post

Dave

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Dave,

I would never, ever suggest that who reads FF is a loser. For starters, I am a reader, at least once a week and enjoy reading about other people's approaches.

The only thing I do not like is to see over an over the same old story of people getting excited about the next holy grail and then see the same pattern all the times where the thread starts losing posts as people realize that, on ranging times, the system does not perform well. I have been there, done that.

All I am suggesting is to keep it simple and change the attitide: if you are hoping a system will make you rich, you will only get stressed out and lose money.

If you realize a system can only help out and give you some extra cash DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH YOUR STARTING BALANCE IS, then you will be good at it and have fun.

Reality is, 90% of people in here are hoping to get rich quick and therefore hate reading posts like mine and get all defensive, and I know that 'cause not too long ago I was exactly in their same shoes.

As time goes by they will realize that I was not THAT wrong after all....

Mr. Future

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Yes, I fully agree with this. This is why there is no holy grail strategy and never will be. With this kind of strategy and any strategy really, is to keep losses small and let the profits run, so we have a consistant long term edge.

I understand what you mean about short time frames. I traded these at first, but it was very labour intensive and I did a lot more trades than I do now which meant a lot more spreads to the broker, meaning I had to have a much bigger win ratio just to break even. People do make money on this kind of trading, but it just doesn't suit me.

I must also agree that fx is not a get rich quick scheme, this kind of approach is potentially dangerous in my view. However, with strict discipline and risk management and a good strategy, it is possible to make above average returns on your money, not without some degree of risk though. I am more conservative than many traders, I trade with very low leverage, I aim for 2-3% per month. If I get to 4% I stop trading for the month so not to risk losing it.

Currently I am waiting for a signal on GBP/USD, it may come today, it may come in a few days, I will wait. Last trade on this pair was the cross on the 24th August. Entry was 2.0040. It got very close to my stop which was below support at the time, then price changed in favour of my position and hit 2.0191 and my trailing stop was activated at 2.0141 for +101 pips. Patience and discipline, I am getting there!

--- 帖子 #17 ---
PeterM, good thread. Thanks for sharing your experience. I'm currently long GBP/USD with a few pips locked in and will follow your daily signal and hop on short too, if it materialises and the R:R looks OK.

Thanks again and good trading to you.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Hi im a novice but i been following the cross over method qutie some time and from all my experiments its been one of the most simple and most effective

i have a couple of questions

1) how would u define a ranging market

2) being a laggard the MA do you place the order at market once the EMAs cross each other?

thanks guys

--- 帖子 #19 ---
tx for the indicators banzai

and yes PeterM, despite what others may say... MA crosses is one of the simplets and most effective methods that I came accross.

wrt. ranging markets, I ussally stay out of trouble with MTF and trading on the daillies or 4hr.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
It took me a while but now I'm a simplicity zealot.

For those who find 2 moving averages devilishly complicated why not try my method of using only 1?

I now use just a 10ema (5 or 8 is just as good). When it cuts through price you have a signal.

If the ema line is flat I wait for a bit of slope but other than that its just eyeball and a bit of candle patterns.

It is also less frustrating than moving average crosses as there are numerous opportunities to get in so I don't fret if I miss one. With a very tight stoploss it works very well.

I have used it from 1 minute up to 1 hour with good returns.

Good luck to all

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Hi tooloud,

my problem with this is that I use to get to many false signals, that is why I think the 5MA is good, lagging a bit to eliminate some bad signals, but it works for you and will probably for others... just my 2pips :-)

--- 帖子 #22 ---
I think we all see things a little differently so that is why even the best methods fail for some.

I'm a bit the other way in that I try to trade as little as possible so often miss trades.

The key point though, is that simple methods often tell us more than complicated ones.

Regards,

ps, I always wait for close of candle.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Forgot to say that I only trade the GBP/USD and EUR/JPY and keep out of the news.

I have also spent many many hours watching them so have started to understand some of the nuances.

Regards

--- 帖子 #24 ---
1) I would define a ranging market where there is no clear trend

2) I generally wait until we have the closed candle then look at the charts and see if there is a good trade

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Great.. That is exactly what I am doing too :-)

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hello I am new to this forex have beenwatching and have tryied some other trading systems which have got me confused with all different indicators..This one looks simple and looks like a long term trading. Which I think would be good for me since I work about 10 - 11 hours a day.. I this one will work for me.. any other help would  be great..thank you and hope to be on this thread alot more...

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Hi and thanks Peter,

I have been using a similar method in my repertoire for quite a while now and would just like to add that it is best to wait for the price to retrace to the 5 ema before entering. This will reduce the drawdown considerably and keep you out of some potentially losing trades.

Mike

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Is there any indicator that show JMA crossover signal??...I think using JMA is better than EMA

Profit 30 Pips yesterday on EU.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Do you wait a bit after they cross to get in? and have you tried them on smaller time frames?

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Yeah, thats the thing I like about trading daily charts, the labour requirements are often much lower than intraday!

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Thanks for the post.. That does sound very interesting. Do you get many signals that way?

--- 帖子 #32 ---
What is JMA ?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Waiting for a cross on nzd/usd to the upside.. It could be coming early next week. we will se.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
I am also waiting for a cross on the eur/usd.. Might be coming in the next hour... I have been using the 1hr chart...seems to work good for me... I made about 40 pips yesterday with it... I like this system alot, nice and simple to use... talk later

Happy piping

--- 帖子 #35 ---
I use similar stuff and this is a great strategy... I use 8 EMA. When the EMA slopes upwards I buy and trail the SL below the previous bar low. I also use multiple TPS for price targets. Say that the weekly ATR is 300 pips I take 5 units divide by 5 is 60 pips and put 5 TPS at 60, 120, 180 so on.  Complete exit when the EMA starts to slope downwards or when the SL is hit below the previous bar.. Usually I pay attention so the win/loss ratio should be always more tha 2:1...

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Hi Peter........

Thanks for starting this thread, I also have been using a simple MA strategy for quite a while now, I posted the following link in another thread, it basicly sums up my approach to this..... http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...3&postcount=81

The buety of this simple approach is it can be used in ANY tme frame by simly adjusting the TPs & SLs to the time frame.....shorter TF tighter TP & SL so in this way even a rangeing market can be traded.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
5/8 EMA applied to what price mode? which TF best suit with this setup? how do you deal with side moving market?

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Great, I've not tried it on the smaller timeframes, let us know of your progress

--- 帖子 #39 ---
It seems to be working good for me.. the 1 day chart works good to I think for lnger trends.. I seem to miss the cross on the 1 day since I don't have much time to watch it..The 1 hour gives me alittle more time to watch and get in if there is a cross... I wish I was home today... The Eur/Usd jumped up around 90pips... I got in before I left for work but only set my TP at 20pips.. I am fine with that.. This system really works for me Thanks for sharing it Peter...I will keep you intouch about the 1 hour charts

--- 帖子 #40 ---
I personally use the daily chart but slkosier seems to be doing well with currently with the hourly charts. I have never tried that as I only trade daily and weekly charts personally.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
thanks for the post.. Maybe shorter time frames would be a better option when the daily charts are ranging, I will have to look into that.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
OK.... let me know what you come up with.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
I am thinking with this strategy, whilst it has given me some very good signals, and I done well with it for a few months now, with some consistency. I have been stopped out quite a few times. I am thinking it may be better to open half the position as I am currently am doing and perhaps the other half at a support area. The second position running the risk of not being triggered, but also a much more favorable R/R.

--- 帖子 #44 ---

I like this simple system

What if you add the 4 hour 5/8 for buy & sell signs

use the day for trend.

Peter

How long have you rode a trade out on the daily signals (average)?

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Figured I'd try this out.

I put up 5 orders with this system on the 1 hr charts, buying/selling according to the signals.  Lost about 20 pips on each right now so far...with no signal change yet.

I'm losing on every single one of them...so I don't know what I did wrong...or it was just bad timing....lol.

Only using penny lots just to test it.  Might have to move to daily.

I'm using Bonzai's  Indicators on page 1.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Hi Peter,

Sorry for taking so long to get back but I've been away for a while.

What I was meaning by letting the price retrace back to the 5ma was this:

You get the usual cross, in your case the 5 crossing the 8, but sometimes the bar (or candle) that caused the cross has closed a long way from the 5ma due to a large price movement. If you go back over your charts you will find that after such a move the price will most often retrace back to the 5ma (or near to it) before turning back into the intended direction. If you wait for the retrace before entering you will potentially turn a losing trade into a winning one.

Hope this helps

Mike

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Hi Saint Berzer,

Perhaps what I just wrote about the retrace may have helped those trades.

Also on the smaller time frames the price can turn back on you rather quickly.

Try it on the daily chart and close the trade in profit a few hours later if you don't want to be in the market too long.

Mike

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Hi All

I can vouch for MA crosses, its been working great for me for the last 6 months, the only problem, because they lag, is the smaller TF. I personally do not use them on anything smaller that 4hr's.

If you want to trade smaller TF, use a third MA, in this case something like the 13MA and only trade in the direction of the "trend".

I personally use EMA's

Happy trading to all

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Glad to hear you are doing well with it too. I also use EMAs. I only use them on daily timeframes and like you say they do lag a bit. EMAs are better than SMAs though in my experience.  Though no strategy is perfect, if there was no lag it would be holy grail and that does not exist but I definately think we have a strategy that can give us an edge in the longer term which is what I am always looking to do.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
One hour is way way to short for this type of system

also you will not be right every time!!

My NZD/USD long has just gone nicely into profit +45 pips at the moment, it was a nice 5/8 cross.. I moved the stop to break even now so it is risk free. Theres a 23.6 fib around 0.7120. Big NZD news later retail sales and rate decision, lets see how that affects things..

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Moving averages are powerful tools but IMHO they are not enough alone. I would use an oscillator like MACD or RSI or Stochastics with it and add to the toolset trendlines, support resistance, fibo levels and pivot points for starters. Plus use MM. Things like if I have such profit I move to breakeven. I use multiple SLs, targets and so on... That would be more or less the complete picture. Oh yes. and a lot of "screentime" just to get feelings about price action/behoviour.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Maybe candlestick patterns like dojis and so on.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
long trends rocks.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
I have been doing good with the 1 hour charts.. Made another 45pips today.. I have also been using the MACD, RSI, and the Stochastic with it to help confirm.. I have got used to the system that way since I only have a short amount of time to be in front of the computer.. It is good for shorter trends.. But I think I am going to try the 1day chart like you all are using and just wait for the right time to get in to go for the longer trends... I love this system alot.. Works great....

See ya all later

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Does anyone think the NZD will go higher than it is at now?  Still has the cross

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hi Slkosier, this is just my Opinion, but with this MA x Systems, Choose your TF and rather wait for a new cross or look at another Currency, than to jump in a trade after a cross has been established for a while.

Then again, with Oscillators you could probable confirm the trend and join if you want.

In This case with the NZDUSD on the dailies, take an RSI14, if that cross the 50 line, then yes, you might have a LONG, and same goes for NZDJPY Dailies. On both the Dailies are up and Weeklies are down, So If I were not in at the beginning then I'll rather stick with Option one above.

The Dailies does not take a long time to Analise with this method and there are plenty currencies to observer and take you pips for the day.

Thanks for the post. I do agree that they are not enough alone. Support and resistance points are very important especially for entries and profit targets.

Personally I am not a fan of indicators, but if they work for you that is cool!

--- 帖子 #74 ---
I am still long too.. I have a similar target, the swing high near that area. Although I am around +120 pips or so and I also have a 50 pip trailing stop, I dont want to risk ending the trade at break even now its so nicely up

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Heh you have the point I am not fan of them too. But sometimes they are useful. I have 3 no indicators strategies and 1 with indicators. Just for fun.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
My trailing stop activated. +91 pips.. I waited patiently for the right entry and only risked 25 pips. Time to sit out now and wait for more good signals.

Hello MrFuture. Looks like you have a great system... in my opinion, all you need is an indicator that shows you if a market is trending or is going sideways. I'm a relatively a starting trader (i like it a lot, and maybe i'm still looking for the "holy grail"), since i've been doing it for about five months, and i have the same problem as you have.

After a lot of reading, i found that you can use indicators that tells you when a market is in trending mode, and when it's going sideways. If you find an indicator that tells you an entry point when the market is going sideways, then you can let it roll on when the trend begins, and the best of all, you are getting an early entry, better than the entry point that tells you the trending indicator. If the market doesn't trend, then you exit when the sideways indicator tells you to do so.

I know it can sound easy, and i also know that it isn't, but it's my 2 pip contribution to the forum... lol.

"That's when most profit obtained while it was trending are burned and the you start all over again."

I hate to read this..., thats why i needed to write about it. Maybe its not the "holy grail":, but with your system, and my humble contribution, i think you can get pretty close...

Happy and profitable trading

Hi there PeterM,

Looks like today there's a short signal for gbp/usd.

Just wondering, would you take this signal since today is friday?

Once the 5/8 ema crossed, where exactly to enter position?

Tq..

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Yes, but I would wait until monday though and sell at a resistance point. I might trade it if we get a retracement so I only have to risk a smaller number of pips/equity. I am always very patient, sometimes I miss opportunities as I stay out when I don't have an optimal entry. I much prefer this though, I prefer to be out of the market than have a bad entry every time! No entry means no risk of loss, a bad entry means a high risk of loss.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
I have been reading the thread and I was wondering what SL you are using for this system. It seems after reading the posts and lookin at the charts at can be quite large SL's

Eric

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Read the first post, he uses the previous days high or low depending if long or short. Also offers alternative methods if the high or low is too large of a stop.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Good for you  , always take what others say, but make your own analysis... (referring to my own post regarding if you should go long or not  )

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Nice trading! I only had the 1 techincal trade last week on nzd/usd for +91 after it hit my trailing stop. I am over 5% up in equity for the month currently so I am staying out unless a good setup arises. I setup a new carry trade hedge too.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Another questions from me PeterM,

Do you have any TP in any trade or just based on the trail-stop?

What are other pairs which you have been trading the system?

My broker gave me 10 pips spread for gbp/jpy...fuuh..that's a lot man.

Peace.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
1. Usually, I use a TP, When the trade is in profit I move the stop to break even, if it goes well into profit I use a trailing stop. So it if this happens it will either hit the trailing stop or the TP.

2. NZD/JPY NZD/USD GBP/USD GBP/JPY.. It would probably work well on many other pairs, I just like the volatility of these.

3. that is quite high, there are brokers with small spreads, but if the execution is good where u are, it might not be worth moving.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Just a quick basic question that may or may not have been answered...

Does this "system" method work only on the DAY the cross over is occuring?

Or is he system simply saying that when the 5day, at any time, is below the 8day,its a short position... and when its above it, its a long position (regardless of when the "cross over" happened)?

--- 帖子 #90 ---
I know low time frames are shunned apon...but just to throw an idea out there

30 min or 1 hr time frame (And D1 timeframe)

5 and 8 EMA

RSI 14

Stochs 5,3,3

ATR 100

Long entry:

D1 Timeframe shows long trend (5 over 8 ema and rsi above 50...could also use like h4 or h8 timeframe...havent really looked into those though)

5 EMA>8EMA on closed candle on 30 min (or 1hr) TF

RSI >50

Stochs are not over bought (over 80) and Slow%K>Slow%D

TP 25% (or 50%...still havent fully tested) ATR

SL 15% (or 25%) ATR

You can also try it with ATR at 14..which would cause a bigger SL and TP

Opposite for Short (Stochs under 20 for over sold)....

Just throwing out an idea...and it could probably be used on bigger time frames...Trades can be re entered as many times as they arise. Also..there is room to add management so that if your position is still in profit maybe you can leave part of it open...such as Close 75% of trade at TP and leave the rest....and close it when stochs are over bought and cross down (if long) or oversold and cross up (if short)

As you can see, you are only entering trades of the daily trend.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
[quote=WizardPip;1592311]" As jacko says in his post .... if the price starts in the lower left and ends in the top right .... the trend is UP, if it starts in the top left and ends in the botom right ....the trend is down,  if you still can't figure it out print it off and show the chart to any 5 year old .... he will get it right everytime.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
How would you you determine the TP/SL percentage of ATR?

Would you explained a bit?

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Depending on what the ATR read...

so for example the ATR(100) on the 30 minute chart of EURJPY is 0.2417

that means the average range of 1 30 minute bar is about 24 pips (Since /jpy pairs only have two decimal places).

So 50% ATR would mean a TP of 12 pips

25% of ATR would mean a SL of 6 pips...etc

I prefer to wait until we have the close candle before using it as a signal. You can use it as soon as they cross but I have found it to be a less reliable signal

--- 帖子 #95 ---
interesting idea, could be worth trying on a demo for a while. Have you ever tried it ?

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Havent officially tried it...I was mostly stating it for brainstorming purposes...even though today, with that idea as well as some of my own, I am trying to develop a system that I might seriously test.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
NipthePips,

Isn't your earlier post close to the trading system from effilang in his 25-50EMA system?

--- 帖子 #98 ---
So just to confirm...

Youre looking at the daily chart... and when you see the cross occur in the MA... you wait till the days candle is over...Meaning the following day is when you take your position (@9am)

Correct?

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Went short on the GBP/USD at 2.0047 and took profit at 2.0007 for 30 pips this morning.... I love this system... I am going to sit out now and wait to see if I can find another signal...Happy trading everyone...

--- 帖子 #100 ---
hello slkosier, wat other indicators u use besides sma5/8 ...and the settings...thanx in advance ..  ps- which pair and tf do u trade?

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Sounds good, let us know how it goes :-)

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Yes, I use the daily chart, sometimes I enter at midnight server time, other times I use limit orders at support/resistance points. Depending on the charts. I never like to risk too many pips.

Slkosier seems to be doing very well with the smaller timeframes, so that may be worth a try. I have only ever tried it on the daily charts though. If you had used the GBP/USD short signal on the daily and entered at midnight, your position would be nicely up now and you could make it risk free by trailing it and/or using a b/e stop.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Thats great, you seem to be doing well with your strategy so far.. well done :-)

What are you using for your tp's and stops ?

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Hmm i guess you can say that....but on second thought, most EMA crossover systems are very similar. Didnt realize that it matched pretty close though.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
I have been using it with an RSI, MACD, & Slow Stochastic indicators and have been using them on the 1 day chart to try and get a longer trend...

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I have been setting me a TP limit of 25pips if I am going to leave the computer to be safe... And a SL of 40 pips when at the computer or more if I am gone..... I have gon to the daily charts know to try and get a better profit...

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Interesting.. Do you pay any attention to support/resistance or not ?

--- 帖子 #108 ---
I haven't yet.. I have only been doing this for about  7 months.. I have done ok so far learned a bit.. tried different systems, but this one seems to be the easiest for me right now.. I want to learn more about S & R and Pivots and all that but I don't want to start to confuse myself with learning to many things at one time.. Do you know any good places for learning S & R?

Talk to you later..

I entered last night at 2.0048 and took profit at 2.0025 for 23 pips. This was my first demo trade with this system. I guess I have learned that I should wait until retracement to 5-EMA I could have had an easy 100 pips if had done better with the entry.

Is this the case with this system, is het better to wait entering if and when the price is closer to the 5-EMA?

I use the 5 and 8 Ema crosses on the daily charts only, but confirm entry on the 4 hour. The GBPUSD short was a perfect setup. Try using pivot points. They are very powerful particularly if there is a confluence of events on different time frames.

1.On the daily there is a very clean cross with good separation and angle.

2. Price has broken a major trend line.

3. Price then falls through the monthly pivot point

4. On the 4 hour chart price has broken through the weekly pivot point

5. Solid trend down on the H4.

Pull the trigger!!

I plot the monthly pivots to show up on the daily charts and the weekly pivots to show on the H4. If you look back at some of the big moves you'll be amazed at how often price breaks though both the weekly and monthly pivots at the same time as the ema cross leading to lots of pips.

I don't use TP's. How do I know how far the market will go? I exit when I see signs of a reversal or a reverse cross. Why are people only taking 20 or 30 pips when trading the daily time frame. The good crosses don't come often. If you only take small profits you won't be able to compensate for the losses. Some of these trades can go 1000 pips. Remember the old saying, cut your losses short and let your profits run"

I entered GBPUSD at 2.0082 and I'm currently up 180 pips.

Also went short on EURCAD at 1.435 and now 125 pips in profit. Can't lose on either trade as both SL's are are at break even. For SL I either use the low or high of the previous day as PeterM suggested or 70% ATR.

I don't and won't use any other indicators.  Been there already. Price action and support and resistance are the best tools.

I really like crossing MA's. I used to trade the one hour charts using a 9 and 30 EMA with an entry confirmation the other side of a Tom Demark trend line break and also taking pivots into account. I recently decided that I didn't want to stare at a screen all day and opted for the daily charts.  BTW I don't think the 5 and 8 work very well on the one hour. Too many false signals.

Some people say that this system doesn't work well in a ranging market. Here's what you do.

1. Establish that the market is ranging or in a channel.

2. Switch off the computer.

3. Go to the beach.

4. Establish that the market is trending again.

5. Start trading.

Glad to contribute my 2 cents worth and good trading to everybody.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Here's the EURCAD trade. It's hitting some major support if you look at the weekly chart. May get out sooner rather than later.

Don't forgot to look at the 4 hour. Trend lines are important too. You can often get a better entry by waiting for a retracement to a trend line or fib level.  I find the Demark trendline trader useful because it draws trend lines automatically. Good for lazy people like me.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Is anyone in the EURCAD. Note the weekly is stalling to the downside.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Yes, it can be, but you will get fewer signals. It may be better to do this on the smaller timeframes.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Thanks for the insight slushfund. Pivots are definitely very important in S/R. The market nearly always bounces to some degree at them.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Thank you very much for your contribution. One may well have a life and still trade. Please post your indicators or template e.g monthly, weekly pivot etc.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Here are the indicators I use.  The weekly and monthly pivots. I've also included the Demark trendline manager.

Just thinking about time frames. Trading the daily charts allows you to have a life as you say Aelimian. I used to trade stocks and then options based on end of day data, so I was trading the daily charts. When I discovered forex a year ago I suddenly had free access to 1 minute charts. I was like a kid with a new toy. It's exciting to trade intraday and make 20 pips in 10 minutes which is easily done on the yen pairs. Problem is I found I was giving back 20 pips just as easily. The timeframe encouraged me to "overtrade". I was getting hyper and undisciplined. I started to get depressed at weekends when the market was closed. I just wanted to trade all the time.

The daily charts force you to become patient and disciplined because you might have to wait a few days for a good signal.  From the accounts I've read, it seems that most succesful traders say that trading the higher time frames are more profitable in the long run.

Decided to close the GBPUSD trade for 130 pips profit. Felt too nervous about the interest rate statement due in 2 hours time.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Wow grabbed 80pips on that report..... But I had lost 70pips earlier from jumping the gun and not listening to the rules of this system when the ema's cross... I guess you learn from your mistakes....

I got lucky with that report coming out.. I think I learned to wait for a little longer cross or like some other have talked about waiting for a close of the candle after the cross

--- 帖子 #119 ---
That was a good.. cable jumped around 150 pips.. The bigger reduction in rates than expected sure produced a great opportunity..  I got in at 2.0060 and trailed it for +55 pips. I often trade the nfp and surprise interest rate decisions when they come up as well as the ema crosses.. did any of u guys trade it ?

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Thats good.. well done.. making a mistake is ok, as long as we learn from them

--- 帖子 #121 ---
We have a 5/8 cross on GBP/JPY

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Will the report for the JPY Interest Rate Announcement  have any effect on the cross getting ready to start?

--- 帖子 #123 ---
well that news release will affect the yen.. It might go with your position it might go against, unfortunately there is no way of knowing.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
I am in on GBP/JPY and up about 40pips right now and moved S/L to +10 pips..Going to see what this might goto tonite....

--- 帖子 #125 ---
The GBP/JPY is extremely volatile. A 10 pip SL is very tight. Can go 10 pips either way in the blink of an eye. Being extremely conservative, yes we have a cross, but it's hugging that pivot point too much for my liking. Looks good on the 4 hour but going sideways on the daily. It's not what I would call a "cross with conviction". Let's see what happens after the retracement.

Glad I got out of that short GBPUSD trade. I'm in Asia so I was asleep during that interest rate announcement.  Anyway I never trade the news.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
SlushFund,

Thank you for your methodology and indicators.

Eric

--- 帖子 #127 ---
GBPJPY cross.

Might be safer to wait until price breaks resistance at 234.80 and breaks the trend line. Note that the weekly is trending down. You can't just blindly take every cross.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Someone PM'd me for the percentage of ATR indicator. Here it is.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Oops. Sent the wrong file combination.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
I obviously misread. I assume you mean your SL is 10 pips above breakeven not 10 pips below price. What SL are you using for the 1 hour chart.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Yeah I moved it to +10pips after my trade went 40pips +.. I am using the day chart now and trying to find a SL that works for me with out risking to much..That trade went up higher moved my SL to +20pips and went to sleep adn when I woke up it hit my SL, But thats ok I am fine as long as I am in the +++...

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Not sure what you mean by adjusting SL to what you are willing to risk. You should adjust the lot size to stay within your risk not, I repeat not the SL. A good place for the SL on the daily is either at the low or high of the previous daily bar or if the previous bar is enormous then 70% of the daily range works well. It's a bit discretionary. Sometimes there's a clear resistance or support level to place the SL.

Money management is the key. My personal rule is that I won't expose myself to a loss that is more than 2% of my account. MM is the most important thing I have learnt about trading.

I'm sure you understand this but let me spell it out anyway. So let's say my account is 10,000 dollars. I want to go long GBPUSD which is 10 bucks a pip on one full lot size. Quick intraday trade on the 15 minute chart for maybe 20 or 30 pip profit. My trade determines I need a SL of 20. Possible loss is $200 if I get stopped out. That's 2% of my account - so I can buy one lot.

Now I'm on the daily chart. Bigger SL's apply. These trades need room to breath. I've worked out I need an SL of 100.  Same risk of 2%. Possible loss if I got stopped out on one lot would be $1,000. Can only afford $200 loss which means I buy one fifth of a lot which is 2 mini lots. (0.2 lots) to keep within my 2% exposure. I could have 10 losses in a row and still have 80% of my account intact. Ignore this at your peril!!

So on the one hand you make less per pip on the daily charts for the same risk, but you are looking to harvest many more pips than you would on a 15 minute chart. That's why you don't just grab 20 pips on a daily chart and call it a day.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
I really could not agree more with this statement. Personally I only risk 0.5%, but I am naturally very conservative in my trading. Many of my trades get stopped out for a profit by using a trailing stop.  My winners on average earn about 1.2%.

I think MM is one of the biggest factors that separates the winners from the losers in the long term.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Thanks for the files, very useful :-)

I bought gbp/jpy just above the 23.6 fib at 231.80..

nevermind, I got stopped out at break even this time.. Time to wait for another signal.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Just try to see if I got this right..  Is there a cross starting on the USD/JPY & GPB/JPY?

--- 帖子 #138 ---
PeterM, your thread for beginners is by far the best information I have read relating to the forex market. I thank you sir for taking the time too put this together and share!!

--- 帖子 #139 ---
yes, those were a cross, would have been a nice trade.. GBP/JPY really shot up :-)

--- 帖子 #140 ---
thank you for your kind words, I hope you have some success with the strategy.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Looks like we have a cross on the GBP/USD...

--- 帖子 #142 ---
up 10 pips so far on GBP/USD..Going to sleep in a bit hope to see more pips...see ya all later

--- 帖子 #143 ---
I am also long.. entry 2.0204.. maybe the chance to move the stop to b/e soon.. we will see.. 0.5% of equity risked.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Yes I agree on moving the SL to B/E... I got in at 2.0205..

--- 帖子 #145 ---
well, that was all over quicker than expected, and it ended quite nicely, my trailing stop activated at 2.0268. +64 pips, which equates to just over 1% in equity on my account. Good month for me so far.. I am +8% now. Main priority is to remain risk adverse and stay out until a good opportunity comes along.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
grabbed 95 pips on GBD/JPY... there is a cross on the USD/JPY started too..hope some off you join us..

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Looks like a cross on the USD/CAD...Check it out...

Sorry wrong time frame..It was on my 4H chart

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Nice.. did you use a trailing stop?

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Yeah I used a trailing stop... I was using oanda,but before that I still have an account open with InterbanFx and they have trailing stops and oanda does not offer them..I went back to Interbank to use them and they also offer alot more stuff to use on there charts..trailing stops help since I can't be here for a long amount of time..Sure wish I could..talk to you  later....

--- 帖子 #150 ---
setting your trades and going away is sometimes a good thing.. no chance of micro management..

Looks Like we have a cross on the GBP/USD for a short on the daily chart..

Where has everyone gone? seems like not tomany people here lately... Thats ok I like this system and will keep posting here anyways....Talk to you later Pete

Looks like a cross for a Long on the AUD/NZD too ont the daily... Double check to make sure I am right

Looks like a cross might happen on the EUR/GBP...keep an eye on that one

--- 帖子 #156 ---
ah yeah.. I see it.. I don't trade that pair with it.. It can range for a long time.. though lately the euro has been stronger.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
you might want to keep an eye on the EUR/USD.......it looks as though it may be in transition to go south for a bit, will see in another day or two..

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Yes.. it certainly could be due some sort of correction, it does seem very overbought.. The pair gave some of the gains back today.. need to be patient and see if just a small retracement or a more substantial one over the coming days and wait for the right signals.

Pete

--- 帖子 #159 ---
I am also watching the EUR/USD.. It is getting close to the cross.. But we also have alot of big reports coming out tomorrow...

Peter --

After you have your cross when do you decide to get in? do you wait for some retrace ?  Just trying to figure out a better time to enter and not have as much going - before going to TP...

Slkosier

--- 帖子 #160 ---
I often enter at the close if it a good cross...Its a very nice euro cross this time.. break even stop if 1.4063 is broken.. as this is a 23.6% fib on my daily chart.. should be support here

--- 帖子 #161 ---
How are people doing here...don't lose faith , we are in a bit of a retracement with the EUR/USD.....

--- 帖子 #162 ---
I had a short that got stopped out this time.. -30 pips.. 0.5% of equity.. Going to look for good setups next week.

Hello from Cornflowerland.  I have been following this thread off and on.  It's nice to see a return to simplicity.  For the scalpers in the house, this is a great way to nab pips on the EURUSD using a 5-min chart.  With a 0.9 spread on Oanda, there really isn't any excuse not to make money.  Here is one way of implementing this strategy:

1) Wait for a clear cross.  Not one of these half-baked sorta looks like a cross but is really two strings tangled together in a cat's paw kinda crosses.  A real cross, with price rising above/below the 5 EMA with a certain authority.

2) On the next candle, wait for the price to touch the 5 EMA.  Enter immediately.  If price goes against you by 5 pips, exit for a loss.  Otherwise, hold until the candle is fully outside the 5 EMA.

3) Exit.  This is scalping.  Take your pips and run for the exit.  You can always re-enter on the next pullback if it's clear that the trend is strong.

4) Repeat.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
I have been using this sytem for a few weeks now with some good results.. I also use Oanda and I use InterbankFx... I have a co-worker That uses Oanda and I have showed him this system and he trade mainly on the Eur/Usd and has been doing the same thing with the 5 min scalping with the crossover.. He has had good results.... Between 20-40pips a day(while at work).... I am glad you have been getting good results.. Happy pippin

Slkosier

--- 帖子 #165 ---
sounds very interesting.. I have not tried it on the 5 minute charts.. only daily.. I imagine u would do a lot of trades if u do the 5 min charts.. Where would u set your stops and tp ?

Sounds like oanda has really good spreads.. I have never used them.. Are they happy for you to scalp? I know a lot of retail brokers hate it.

Pete

--- 帖子 #166 ---
I have used for awhile now.. I have been scalping with them on another system(alot different)... In the EBook the trader uses Oanda for scalping...They let you go down to pipettes.. The only thing I don't like is that you are stuck with the indicators that they have and that is it and a couple of hours before they open and close for the week the spread jump big time...Eur/Usd goes from .9 to 10 and some go higher... But is a very simple broker system to use...

Slkosier

--- 帖子 #167 ---
sounds good.. I have just downloaded an oanda demo.. I will give it a try next week

--- 帖子 #175 ---
yep.. I see it.. Could be a nice one. Going to try the small time frames today. Do you trade them between the news?

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Hi, just to let you know I am following with interest, is there a particular set of pairs you trade on the Daily time frame.  I also look at the 4 hour time frame.  Having already had a look through a few examples for sure i will enter on a pullack to the 5 with a stop above the previous bars high/low, if the trade doesnt kick in then let it go, if it does the r:r is usually > 2:1.  With this type of trade I then like to take off some position, a third at equal r:r.

Am thinking, currently that second half will be at 2 to 1 and then the third maybe on a 5 bar trailing.

Am currently considering 1 or 2 indicators to complement the strategy (ADX in particular for trend) but to be honest, I love keep it simple.

Hope you dont mind me joining in the forward testing and look forward to your replies.

Cheers,

W.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
OK, I already have a point worthy of discussion, I think so anyway. EUR at present is giving a Sell signal on the Daily, actually, this kicked in earlier but with the rules of entering on a pullback to the 5ema (which is at about 14105) the 240 has now triggered a Buy signal (which would kick in at around 14069) on a pullback to the 240 5ema.  One thing that would probs pursuade me to take the short side would be that the adx (8,8) on 240 is red above blue, i.e. still on the short side.

Wondered if anyone had any thoughts on this one.

Thanks in advance, all.

I had pick up about 80 pips so far this morning with the cross... I was trying a MA Crossover alert  on the 1 hour chart and only going for 10pips at a time(going for smaller amounts to try something out) and made 8 trades when the alert signaled them..

oh really? I don't see that on my chart. My charts are GMT+3 I think, there are no sunday candles, perhaps that is why..

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Hi guys,

I trade a similar method to this using a 50 100 EMA and reading your thread here and looking at it on my charts I can see how this simple method can produce nice pips. One thing I noticed is that there is no filter to keep you out of the ranging times. Now not wanting to start putting all kinds of indicators on the charts or try and change the method as I like simple, but I use a filter to stay out of trades that is quite simple and yet effective.

Put an RSI on your charts set at 14 and put 2 levels on it a 56 and a 44. when you get a downward cross wait for the RSI to cross below the 44 for a buy cross wait for the RSI to go above the 56 .. when the RSI is between these two levels the market is basically ranging and your more likely to enter just to get stopped out..

I'd post a chart but can't seem to figure out how.

Like I said not wanting to change the trading method but thought I might be able to help with what I use to stay out of more of the bad trades.

Hi peterM & all,

Thanks for your system and all other inputs. I will try to use this on 5mins and 1 hour to see if this can help my entries and exits. I have been a follower of Phillip Neil's M5 (& 4Hr to some extent) and Lever70's Cornflower (Thx Phillip & Lever70) for the past few months. I trust yours will also be very helpful.

As a newbie full time trader for a few hours daily Mon to Fri, I have the struggle whether to trade more lots looking for less pips on a intraday basis or less lots looking for more pips on a bigger timeframe. Now I tend to trade on smaller timeframes and look for confirmations with bigger timeframes.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Well looks like that cross on the NZD/USD for a short is worth 100pips from where I got in a .7512 ....Hope you did good on this one too PeteM

HJ

--- 帖子 #214 ---
I missed this trade , but when the RSI cross 44 , i'll enter

stop loss would be @ 117.18

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Hi there.. I don't use the RSI personally, but it might be useful for confirmation of signals. Have you used it with 5/8 crossover, how did it go?

--- 帖子 #216 ---
That's great! 300 pips in a week. Just be careful now and only take on the best setups to try preserve your nice gains, at least that is what I would do. Once I am nicely in profit for a month, I become ultra conservative as I really hate to give back gains. Glad you liked the site, I have big plans for it, I'll be writing a lot more content in the coming weeks.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Hi , this system is fantatic !!!!!!

regarding RSI the good thing is that protect you from choppy market , but the bad is that ,to waiting , you can loose a good entry and maybe make just a few pips.

Anyway as confort , now , i look at H4 rsi ,just to have an idea and also as filter i look also at QQE indicator and  Gann hilo activator.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
hey.. glad you like it.. I have learned that this is often the problem with using several indicators, you can lose a good entry. This is why I try to keep things simple and just try and ride a trend.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Yes I agree with you on being careful now.. It is getting to the end of the week and will be very careful to trade or maybe not trade and study the charts some more for the next 2 days...

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Good morning guys

closed my long Euro at 1.4265 due to triling stop with + 29 pips gain.....

anyway i have a doubt if i am using wrong triling parqameters....

--- 帖子 #221 ---
at least you locked in some pips.. always better than having a winner turn into a loser. Maybe you need to play with your stops and see what works best for you.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
enjoice....

i dont usually take the 5/8cross as my main trigger.

it becomes my confirmation only.

i trade using fozzy method + stoch as main indicator + new one - QQE

the 5/8 is my confirmation

usually, the stoch n rsi moves first, followed by 5/8

i know why this thread is not so popular...because the signal is not usual...

but nevermind....keep contribute

PeterM...good job

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Thanks for the info Bujal38.. I did'nt do much trading today... I was happy with what I made this week....Hope everyone had a nice trading week...Talk to you all later....

Thanks for sharing your trades.. How is this working for you?

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Great to hear. I like to hear people locking in their profits, it's so easy to give them back.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
I am watching AUD/USD for a Short cross on the daily...

Lets hope this brings another good week...

my trade right now...as at 0:00GMT

E/Y up 199 pip -move SL, lock 100 pip

G/Y up 370 pip - move SL, lock 200 pip

U/Y up 234 pip - move SL, lock 100 pip

Aus/Usd up 4 pip - SL not move yet

hehe....i play safe,...but 400 pip for this month is now confirmed.

just 2 pips of me...

QQE + stoch moves first, when RSI cross the 70 lines/EMA ...that is the trigger.

5/8 is the confirmation whether u want to ride it as long as you want / you take all the profit.

to trade the daily chart.... MM is important. put 2% of your account only on risk.(SL for all the trade u take). if u take 4 trades at one time, devide it 2% / 4....

if u dont have usd30,000.00 then u can always play with usd3000 (it is equal to 300,000 cent...)

then lets play real money....

u can take trade as simple as 15minutes per day to monitor the price.in my case, i look for the chart in the morning (0600 hr Malaysia time, 2200hr GMT) and thats it....

after that, i go to work ( i m currently work as underwater engineer for multinational O&G)

forex is just my part time....and want to keep it as part time.part time that can create as much money than my saving can give dividend (currently the saving gives me return of 9% annually). if forex gives me 30-50% or extremely 100% yearly with this little work, i m more than satisfied.

let say like this...

starting ...usd 3000 (300,000 cent)...at 100% return compoundly...

3000,6000,12000,24000,48000,96000,192K,384K,768K,1.536M

silently we become a millionaire in 9-10 years. with 300 000 cents as a starting? goshhh.... that where MM play a big role.

Peter M, do you have any programmer member who can EA my method? the system is so easy to EA. no head ache.look at my chart setup.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
actually, the Aus/Usd is suitably short 3 days ago. i also late on entry...not monitor this daily since busy playing with EA....hehe

forgot to monitor the routine in the morning....

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Bujal, do you apply your system to all the pairs?

--- 帖子 #230 ---
did you get in? AUD/USD crashed down

--- 帖子 #231 ---
nice trading.. seeing some very nice movees on the yen pairs at the moment

--- 帖子 #232 ---
up 936 pips!!

my GBP/yen hit my SL then move down again....goshh... i always hate this..... they re moving down to 1000 pips easily.....just look out.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
bujal,

Glad to hear you're getting great returns! One question: what indicators are you using? Seems like more than just the 5/8 crossovers. Ok, 2 questions: what timeframes are you using.  Direct me to a post if it is easier than re-typing.

thanks for the info,

HJ

--- 帖子 #234 ---
AAAAgh.  I just saw bujal38's post back a few that explains my last question.

Sorry.

HJ

--- 帖子 #235 ---
right now..play on 9 pairs....

pls demo it 1st..when u re familiar with it...then jump on micro 1st....after comfortable, n capital permitted....go mini,then standard account.

daily is so easy n very comfortable.

look at my chart. clean enough. this is my trade right now...

--- 帖子 #236 ---
to all members,

i believe this thread can be successfull.

the only way to make it successful is not to make the signal/trigger to complicated....remember..this is daily....

it moves slowly but sure.

this thread also can be a place where we can know when to enter.. the intraday also can know which way to go...short or long (based on our entry)...but our SL is higher up or lowerdown than theirs.

hmmm..maybe i should open my own thread anyway?

--- 帖子 #237 ---
indicator? just take a glare at my SS....u ll know. stoch (my baby), QQE, RSI fozzy syle n of course 5/8

enough to know where to go.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Not sure there is a more simple strategy than a 5/8 cross and stops below the previous days high/low.

I like simplicity.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
I have to agree with PeteM.. I like to keep it simple...

To many different indicators and things added can have you looking at to many thing to try and confirm... That is just me though.. BUJAL38 You may be use to your trading strategy..Which looks like it work well for you and that is good to see.. I like to see people making pips & and thanks for any help you can give us here..

--- 帖子 #240 ---
peoples,

Are we always looking at the daily TF for the 5/8 crossovers?  Do we ever go down to the 4H or 1H TF?

thanks,

HJ

--- 帖子 #241 ---
There has been times I do that just to try and pick up smaller amount of pips..

Slkosier

--- 帖子 #242 ---
please dont get me wrong.....my word is not to condemn any of you here. please apologise me if there are any of my word that hurt u guys....

i also like to keep it simple.

that is why i come into this thread.

together we collect pips...

can we share, on average...just by using this method (PeterM method of 5/8) how many pips that u all gain every month.

as myself.....i look for 400pips min for 20 trade. (average 20 pips perday). this month i got more.(cover for 2 month + )

please post here. we share the info eh...hehe

--- 帖子 #243 ---
You did'nt say anything wrong...maybe It just came out wrong from me...I like to hear what you have done with your trading too...We can learn from all of us on here....I was just saying me myself don't like to use to many indicators...everyone finds something that works for them... PeterM's strategy has really helped me... I have tried others and this one helped me alot with this forex trading.. I have only been doing this for about 1 year and have been learning everything from this site...

I am sorry if it may have came out wrong... I liked the way yours & PeterM's charts look..they look very clean and not cluttered with alot of things on it like I have seen on others..

That is great 400 pips... I think last week has been my best so far with 300pips...Right now this week I am up around 180pips...I have to take it easy now don't want to get greedy.. you know how easy that can be in this forex....

Talk to you later

Great stuff. You guys are doing better than me. I haven't made a trade yet this week, at least this way i can't lose

--- 帖子 #245 ---
I have been trying to go back on the 1hr an 4hr chart to make some small tades while waiting for a daily cross..Seems to be working.. I like to thank you again for posting this strategy PeterM..

Slkosier

talk to you all later..Got to goto work...

--- 帖子 #246 ---
guys,

I've been looking at the 4H TF this week and only added the QQE indicator. The QQE seems to cross first and than I wait for the 5/8 cross. I'm looking across 12 pairs. GU,UJ,EJ,NJ,GJ,EU,UCHF,UCAD,ECHF,AU,GCHF,and EA. maybe that's too many, many not on the 4H TF.

Yesterday I made 6 trades for winners; BUT, I only look to initially gain 15-20 pips. Some of the trades just made to 20, and others blew right thru to +50.

I believe this will work for me as long as I don't get greedy.  10-15 pips a day is really all I need.

Also, I have limited time to trade.  I get about 2 hours in the morning (5-7 USA east coast) and maybe three at night (8-11).

Question: with my trading time frame I find myself checking the computer and finding trades that have triggered 3,4, etc bars ago. How long or how many bars will you let go by before you DON'T take the trade? Any thoughts? I'm looking at 3 bars back I don't take the trade. On the 4H TF.

later,

HJ

--- 帖子 #247 ---
You are welcome, I am glad u are doing well with it.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
I only trade it on the daily. I either enter the trade at midnight (GMT+2) or leave an order at a trend line.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
hmmmm... i ve to reveal it here...the biggest secret trading the MA.

the simple trigger is when daily price cross both 5/8....that is your trigger. how to know it? turn the graph to line..u ll see it....

happy trading

but of course it is not holy grail

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Hello all... How did everyone do with their trading today? I made around 100 pips.. I haven't added everything up yet... Been a long day at work... Talk later hope everyone did good..

--- 帖子 #251 ---
great result .....did u using only MA cross 5 & 8 crossed?

--- 帖子 #252 ---
I made about 75 pips today using the 5/8 crossover along with QQE on the 4H TF. I traded pairs EJ, GJ, EU and AU. I could have made alot more but I try to keep greed in check.

Hello all....Yesterday has been a real slow day for me..Haven't really seen to much to get into.. Looks like the NZD/USD might have a crossing on the daily chart going up in another day or so... this might the end for me for this week...I want to lock in my pips now.. I work today until 5pm and I don't trade on fridays...

I am also watching NZD/USD. Could be a nice opportunity here. Good plan to lock in your pips. If you can just make a few pips each week, you will come out on top.

Peter,

If you have to put your trade and go to work, what would determine your S/L in a daily TF?

Roche.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
I have found the ATR is a good indicator for stop sizes......just my 2 pips

--- 帖子 #267 ---
great stuff.. always good to lock in pips

--- 帖子 #268 ---
I either use the previous days low/high, a major swing low/high or a trend line support/resistance point. Whichever allows me to keep the risk down. I like johndoes idea of using the ATR.. I have never used this indicator, what is it actually telling us john?

--- 帖子 #269 ---
I have had a great week with this system.. I made 30 trades with 25 wins and 5 loss for a total of 521pips...

PeterM -- Have you tried to use the Laguerre Indicator?

I look at it when 15 and facing up to go long and when 85 and facing down to go short... I found this on anither thread for scalping.. But seeing if it would help with this system..Going to watch it for a few weeks and see how it works..Talk later

I have used the 1hr and 4hr charts to help me get alot of small amount of pips onmy trades..It has been working goo for me right now...The Laguerre indicator is used on the thread a Simple way of scalping the GPB/JPY and is one of the main indicators they use...Not to sure what is measures...Have been looking for a description...

Ok thanks! I'm trying to get an idea of what my rules will be WHEN I decide it's time to make this real.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Great stuff guys. Glad to hear you are doing well. I am currently long on a few pairs, NZD/USD, NZD/JPY and AUD/JPY, AUD/USD. Some of these are fairly well correlated so I chose my position sizes accordingly. Currently have around 140 pips or so locked in.. I'm going to hold these over the weekend and see what next week brings. I had been patient all week waiting for the right setups, it certainly paid off. Patience and discipline.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
I am long on the NZD/USD right now too.... I know I said I try not to trade on fridays but just can't help it sometime....

Hi you are using H1 and also i don't understand why you went short using just 1 ma ???

--- 帖子 #293 ---
thats right i am using 1H TF.  i used 1 ma cos i find that 1 ma does not have that many unnecessary crossover using 2 ma.  one thing i noticed is that when i used 1 ma and the price closed below the ma line, that is about the same time the 2 ma will have a crossover as well.

am i right to say that? pls correct me if i am wrong as i am still a newie in this field.  thank you.

Hi Wilddream,

I'm not sure how you got the trade for a short..This is what I got for my 1hr chart...

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Hi Slkosier , agree with you .

May be next week on GBPJPY Daily and EURJPY Daily we'll have a long signal.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Yes I agree with that too..I will also be watching for a long on those pairs too...Lets hope they can bring us some good pips...

Slkosier

--- 帖子 #299 ---
hi slkosier,

thank you very much for your reply.  can i clarify some points with you?

1)  do you only use the cross over of 5 and 8 ma for a signal?

2)  how do you set your sl and profit target?

3)  what is your exit signal?  is it the crossover of the 5 and 8 ma again?

once again, thanx.

nothing....just to share.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
I have been setting SL like PeterM Has posted in his 1 post on here and trying a couple of other indicators to helpme confirm my trade...

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Hey Slkosier I'm impressed with the results you've been getting on the H1 timeframe. Good work! I prefer the Daily because the H1 is a bit choppy for my liking, but nevertheless I've started dabbling on a one hour but on a demo account. I guess you inspired me.

On the subject of indicators to confirm a trade, I use the RSI. I don't trade a 5/8 cross if it is against the higher timeframe trend. This is my rule. If I get a cross to go long on the daily, I will only take it if the RSI is above 50 on both the daily and the weekly. Likewise If I'm trading the H4, then RSI must be above 50 on the H4 and the Daily.

If you think about it there are only 2 trading scenarios. Either a MA cross is telling you that you have reached the top or bottom of a major long term trend and you're picking up the reversal which is rare on a daily, or more often, and this is what I like to trade - price is in an established trend and there is a pullback. This retracement often hits a fib level and then continues on its way giving you the cross.

Last weeks AUDUSD is a perfect example which I traded. Currently up +155 pips with SL at B/E and more to go this week I think. As you can see I wouldn't have taken the first cross to the downside as RSI was above 50 showing we are in an uptrend. The second cross which I traded was in sync with the daily and weekly trend and in fact was a retracement of the uptrend.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Hello Bujal38. I guess we're trading in the same time zone. You're just next door to me. I'm in Phuket, Thailand and I'm a Brit.

How far do you think the AUDUSD will go?

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Thanks for posting. How long have you been trading these setups and how is it going for you?

Pete

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Hi Pete

Not that long actually. Only about 2 months with the 5/8. But these trend rules evolved from a system I was trading previously on the hourly charts with good success using a crossing 9 and 30 Ema, but because of more market noise on the H1 the trade was confirmed with a Tom Demark trend line break after the cross and above 50 level on the RSI, above 100 on Momentum and MACD above the waterline for a bullish signal - and confirmed again on the H4.

I decided I wanted less screen time in my life and moved to the daily charts. I came across the 5/8 somewhere else in my travels can't remember where. Because trends are generally smoother on the daily I decided RSI was enough.

I first got into forex about a year ago. Before that I traded options and stocks. I got Peter Bain's Forexmentor course which is really focussed on capturing the big moves during the London session. Works best on the 15 min charts. The best thing I got from that course was the importance of top down trading. In other words always look at the trend on the higher time frames for market flow and work down. Oh and pivots.

I have an issue with profit targets. I don't use them.  It was appropriate to use TP's when I was trading the EURUSD on an M15 chart at the opening of the London session when I knew that the average daily range was 80 pips. But on the daily with the 5/8 I'm not sure.

Look at this trade on the EurCad which resulted in a 529 pip profit.

I entered short at 1.4351. SL was the high of the previous bar at 1.4422. Note that it had moved decisively through the monthly pivot point. After 2 days I moved the SL to B/E and never moved it again. That's the other issue. If I had moved the stop down each day to the previous bar high I would have been stopped out at 1.4234 giving a profit of only 117 pips. You are bound to get retracement at some point. And if I had a TP for some meaningless number like 50 or 100 pips I would be exiting the trade prematurely. On these time frames I take the view that the time to exit is when the market tells you to. In this case price had run into a boring sideways channel but I could have waited for a reverse cross to exit. The bottom line is as long as I see good angle and separation of the EMA's as each day of the trade progresses I see no need to exit or take any profits. On the contrary, if the trend really starts to go and maybe breaks through another support or resistance level, there may be a case to add to the position. I don't think it's possible to make a profit long term with this system on the daily timeframe if you only take 30 pips or follow with a tight trailing stop. I think you have to accept more losses but catch the big moves. That may mean staying in a trade for a month. I know its boring. We are all itching to press those by and sell buttons

But have to confess I haven't done a proper backtest comparing the different approaches. Maybe if I have time I'll do one this week on one currency pair and post the results here.

As a complement to you and the thread you started you should know this is the only thread on any forex forum I have ever been tempted to post to. Keep it pure. Too many threads here end up with 25 indicators by the time it gets to page 20. LOL.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Yes I like using the RSI to help confirm my trade..I use level setting at 56 and 44...above 56 for a buy and below 44 for a sell and between for a ranging market..It knida the same that you use with your RSI 50 above and 50 below...

Slkosier

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Hi SlushFund, I'm a Brit in Bangkok.

I trade something similar to the 5/8 (but actually highlight 5 & 12) with RSI confirmation.

I've attached a typical chart, it's somewhat busier than the charts elsewhere on this thread, but I like to use Guppy MAs as a visual, and the Tunnel to confirm which side of the trend I'm on.

I also use a 21 MA of the RSI itself; I find it offers good confirmation either when RSI crosses 50, when it crosses the MA or better yet when in crossing the 50 it also crosses the MA.

oh, plus SpeedLines, the lazyman's Fib levels

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Hi Rathcoole. Hope you're not getting the rain and flooding we're getting in the south.

That 21 ma on the RSI. Looks a bit like the fozzy indicator. Have you come across it? The difference is the fozzy is an 8 MA on an 8 RSI.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
sounds a bit short for trading dailies ? I've just had a quick look at 8+8ma. At first glance it seems to give more signals earlier but with the potential for far many more whipsaws.

Also, it seems to actually occur before the MA cross-over so it would mean turning the method on it's head and using the MA-x as confirmation of the RSI signal. Not too comfy with that, as I say, it seems to have the potential to throw up whipsaws.

I guess everyone has their own settings, I know of traders who swear by RSI 14. I just know what suits me.

And, no, no rain for a week. I've even had to start watering the plants !

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Well said ! A great trade !

by the way, do you use this mthod on anything else but forex ?

It's given me great signals on gold, oil and the soyas lately too.

No I'm just trading forex now. Funny, when I was trading options on futures commodities, I was happy with the daily charts then when I got into forex I was seduced into the excitement of scalping on 5 minute charts. Now I've come back full circle and decided that the daily charts are more profitable in the long term - and it takes up less of your time.

Problem is for a lot of people once you've got used to the adrenaline buzz of short term intraday trades for 10 or 20 pips it becomes psychologically difficult to avoid the temptation of cashing in quickly if you're 100 pips up on the daily chart. That's a big mistake.

Hello all,

Thanks PeterM for this great system. I think the system will suit me well and I'll start demo trading tomorrow. I use ema 5 apply to close and ema 8 apply to open as automatedtrader has advised, trendlines and RSI with levels 44 and 56 also. I wont put trailing stop all the time further, just to breakeven when it is possible, that way I try to catch the whole big move and ride with the wave. 5/8 ema's crossover to the opposite way, trendlines etc. will tell me when the trend could change and jump off the trade.

Many pips to all! Keep it simple.

See one of my chart as attachement. If you entered long somewhere at 1.1430 you would possible still be at that trade imo. Btw my first post here. http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif

8 over 8 (Fozzy) is great for Daily and 4 hour charts. Take a look at combining these two strategies, you might like what you see..........

Peter,

Nice simple system you have here..seems like it has sparked interest from the small time frame traders as well, which is great. I haven't read the entire post but got the jist of it. I too trade primarily daily and 4hr TF's using something very familiar to your 8/5 cross over, which does work great in trending markets..to filter the ranging times I simply use a larger TF to give me an overall trend direction..only trade that direction and also employ a cci 14 (qqe works great too). If it is not in sync with the cross, meaning going long crossing the 0 line from below at the same time as the MA's then I stand aside until the "stars" align..Again, it's not the holy grail, but it is simple and produces. Thanks for sharing.

Can you provide the basis behind the indicator, will it work on the 4 hr/1hr charts? can you provide info on the channels and forec/snakewith borders that was refered to in a reply to your post as well as the JMA/Jaime abbreviations??

I am going to try my Laguerre indicator next couple of days to see how it works on giving me an entry.... I am trying it on the EUR/JPY right now and it is pointing above .15 on it for a buy.. I am going to try a small trade and I'll let you guys know how it works out....

Can someone confirm that these are the correct EMA settings and what the default colors are?

I appreciate it guys, I read the entire thread and it's never actually stated.

Thanks for all the great info

Thanks for your comments guys. Slushfund, glad to hear u are doing so well. When using the strategy with the smaller time frames, using a confirmation indicator such as RSI could be a great idea as like you said, there is a lot of random noise. Regarding the 5/8 on the daily, I have done well with it, but youe ar right, I would be unlikely to catch a big move with it as I will inevitably have the trailing stop activated early for a smaller profit. Small pips are ok with me though.. it's the consistency I try to focus on.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
You are welcome

It's certainly not holy grail, but that really doesn't exist. I do believe it does give us a great chance to succeed in the long term though. It's great to hear people doing well here with the strategy and similar strategies. Going with the trend on the bigger time frames, I like that idea. I am a big fan of going with the trend.

I am going to try the system on the 4 hour charts on demo, along with trading it live on the daily charts that I have done for a few months now.

It had already crossed a few day ago for a long on my charts

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Take a look at EURAUD. There's been a cross after a pullback but its now sitting on a major support line at 1.5630. Wait to see if it punches through or bounces before taking it. Chances are it will as there's also a strong trend line in place on the H4 which hasn't been violated for the past 7 days.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
BB,

after SF's recommendation I went away and researched Fozzy. Came across a great pdf summary prepared, with Fozzy's blessing, by The Bhoy. Setting aside obvious sporting differences , i found it a great presentation.

I've got enough on my plate right now to start tracking 8/8 opportunities but I've got a mate, a wee bit of a protege, to whom I've forwarded the pdf doc in the hope that he can start to make use of the ideas therein.

many thanks guys for this lead :-)

Peke, I reckon I might have got stopped out on my first attempt at 1430, but that's where experience and confidence in the method should kick in to give one the confidence to try again, 'cos the 2nd attempt was certainly a winner

Hello DaTrader - Sabai Di Mai Khrap?

EMA settings are 5 and 8 exponential on the closing price. You can use whatever colours you like.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Hi BB

Read the whole of the Fozzy thread a while back and particularly enjoyed your very insightful posts. I was demo trading it for a while with variable results. I then came across the Synergy method which uses an indicator called the Dynamic Traders Index. Its fozzy but with additional filtering. I felt it was more accurate than fozzy but at the risk of offending you as someone I know from your posts as a backtesting nut - and quite rightly so - I didn't do an extensive backtest comparison. I mention this because I'm currently forward testing Synergy on a demo account. Sorry this is a bit off topic.

BB,

just a quick snap of a comparison between the Fozzy 8/8 and the 21/21 period I've been using. There doesn't, at first glance, appear to be too much difference, but i will certainly investigate further and will observe the signals it (8/8) generates.

cheers

don't know, i'm probably the only person who's never used Metatrader

prorealtime are ok, the EOD data is all foc and they cover a lot of instruments - commodities, fx, right thru to individual italian stocks.

The realtime data is good, standard charges.

I'm quite pleased with them. I also have a subscription with Stockcharts.com but I don't think I'll be renewing with them, apart from the daily John Murphy newsletter.

Glad to see this thread really going

--- 帖子 #343 ---
been a good few days for me.. My longs on 4 pairs, NZD/USD NZD/JPY AUD/JPY and AUD/USD all did well, the trailing stops all got hit for a net 223 pips. Around 3% in equity on my account. Risk was 0.33% per trade, a total of 1.33%. I used lower risk per trade than I often do as many of the pairs are very closely correlated. I am around 6.2% up for the month, so I am going to close the month here unless a very good setup arises.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
That is awesome PeterM..Looks like lots of people are doing great with this system... I have not done to good until I have tried this 5/8 crossing..Almost gave up on trading.. It is a nice and simple system to use..

Hi ,I am tryng to put the chart ,but dasn't permit ...may be they limited me and i don't know why ????

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Where has the EMA50 come from? It's not part of this system. There's a clear 5/8 cross on the daily.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Yes, I also like to keep things simple. I don't use indicators personally, the thing with them is they are lagged and can often make you chase the market. However, some people do well with them, so they clearly can be useful.

Thanks for your kind words folks, It is much appreciated. I am glad so many of you are doing well with the system. Well done slkosier! 964 pips is awesome. What is that in terms of account equity? I made 340 pips in total which this month equates to around +6.23%. I have closed the month so that is a hard result, I don't want to risk giving back a single pip this month.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
thanks for your comments. I would be careful with spread betting, some brokers have high spreads that make is very difficult. Many of them don't guarantee stops even in quiet market conditions unless you pay a big premium. I was thinking about trying the 5/8 crosses on gold. I have a northfinance demo that has MT4 and offers gold. Also, are you trading live? I know most spread bet brokers don't have demo accounts, It may be best to trade on demo for a while if u keep losing money on your live account.

Pete

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Peter, there was a 5/8 cross on the daily on Gold futures on 31 Aug which has taken us all the way from 675 to 800, still in play for those with enough patience

(btw, the 5/8 cross was also confirmed by my favourite TA signal, a move of the 21RSI above 50 AND through it's own 21MA)

I can't see the 5/8 likely to offer another opportunity to go Long, but the RSI may just dip below it's MA in the next couple of days, offering another buying opportunity

best of luck, Garry

--- 帖子 #365 ---
The cross should be coming today on the USD/JPY... Keep an eye on that... I have used the Laguerre indicator to see if it can help me on entry points and I have entered at 114.68 for a long on USD/JPY & I am up +45pips so far...I keep updated on that indicator..

Hello Peterm, Slkosier, Gioviforex and all others, great thread Peterm. It is very interesting and I really like its simplicity. That is right that the simplicity with good money management are key to a good successful system.

Will follow this thread closely and will share my trades as they come by. This thread, in addition with the 4H MACD of Phillip goes very well together for me.

I am very happy to have found it.

BTW, great website Peterm that you have made about forex

Big thank to you

P.S. I do really like the RSI 14 with level 44 and 56 to remove false signals either in 1H, 4H or Daily timeframe charts. These levels are absolutely great in showing when the pair is ranging and when it is trending.

Sincerely

Shreem

Hi Slkosier , may be this night i'll go long on this one.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Hello Peterm and all, I have a question. This question apply regardless if you use the system on either the 1H, 4H or Daily timeframe. Let's say in an uptrend, if there was already a cross of the 5 EMA over the 8 EMA and the RSI is above 56 and you miss the signal for any reason, do your look to find another opportunity to re-enter in the trend at a later stage even if there is no further up-cross of both EMA?

Like entering on a retracement at a confluence of fibonacci, pivot, round number or key support and resistance areas?

Reason why I ask is that when you have an established strong up-trend like the AUD/USD on the 4H timeframe, the 5 EMA stay above the 8 EMA as long as the trend do not reverse (exemple from the 22-10-07 to the 29-10-07).

Maybe at a re-test of the 5 EMA combined with candle patterns. Just giving some ideas.

Will be happy to hear your comments on this

Thank in advance

Sincerely

Shreem

Be careful when the US announce the possibility of an interest rate cut at 2:15PM EST since it may affect non-USD pairs in one way or another.  If it was I, I would long the USD since I do not believe there will be a cut [a gamble] since news for USD was good today, but be sure its away from the current price before 2:15PM so not get whipsawed.

Article excerpt:

There is optimism in the air on the Street this morning, and U.S. futures are  pointed higher, indicative of a positive open to the regular session of trading.  Fed watchers are widely expecting another rate cute (most likely a  25-basis-point cut) to follow up last month's 50-basis point cut. However, it  seems that those far fetched dreams of another 50-basis point draw down are  fleeting, especially after reports yesterday that the Fed was even considering  no interest-rate cut at all.

Hi Peter

Thanks to you for posting this daily strategy.  Glad you have found success using it these last few months.

I have been following this thread from the beginning and am delighted others look to be using it with success.

I am looking to trade this live soon.

I would not take the cross tho unless it is a clear one.  I would ignore those crosses if the EMAs are tangled or pinched.

Notice you are from UK.  I am too, and am looking for a uk broker as opposed to using a spread betting firm as the spread can be a killer at times.  I was wondering, do you use SB or broker?

Thanks again

Regards

Angie

--- 帖子 #376 ---
That's cool.. Which broker do u use for gold futures?

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Hi there.. Yes, I'm the UK.. I do use a spread betting broker, but not for this strategy. I use CMSFX for this. spread betting firms have their advantages, but like u say, the spreads are too high a lot of the time.

Could u explain me with Chart The use of ATR and how could i get stoploss from it

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Yeah..Thanks for the Info... I got out on the EUR/JPY my Bollinger Bands are to close on the daily chart...

Slkosier

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Hello Slkosier, just wondering, are you entering your trades only based on the daily cross or are you still using the 1H and 4H also for trading?

As for exemple, your USD/JPY was based on which timeframe?

Just trying to learn this great method.

Thank

Shreem

--- 帖子 #389 ---
I play it conservatively. For instance I wouldn't take the USD/JPY right now because I won't know if I have a cross until today's candle closes. You can see a cross now but will it be there tomorrow? Anyway the weekly has been down and is now going sideways.

I've attached the ATR which is set to 70%.

Take the day off tomorrow. It's non-farm payroll. In the wake of the USD interest cut and NFP there will be lots of volatility.

Thx for ur fast reply

but i ttache the ATRPips on my chart an empty window appears

could u explain how could i determine the stoploss?

sorry for my ques

--- 帖子 #392 ---
That's because the colour for the indicator is black. But you have what you need. The ATR number is showing in the pane on your chart which is 64. If you want to see a continuous line you will need to change the colour. BTW change the period from 13 to 14 in the settings. Some peple prefer 21, but I've always used 14.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
ya i get it

so the stoploss now is 64 from the entrypoint?is this right

thx for helping bro

regards

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Correct. If I had a situation where (going long say) the low of the previous days bar was 70 from entry but the ATR was 64, then I'd take the 70 to be cautious. But if the low of yesterday to entry was less than the ATR, I'd use the ATR. In other words I use whatever gives me the bigger SL.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
I'm completely on the opposite side of the fence to you.
USD/JPY Sell Stop @ 114.60
EUR/GBP Buy Stop @ .6985

Of course, my Stop Buy/Sell points will probably not get triggered, at least today, in which case I wish you the best of luck :-)

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Thankyou Shreem ! Finally the one key question has been asked.

Personally I use a dip below 0 of either (or both) Elder Ray and/or CCI20 on the Daily, to enter a Stop Buy above previous closing high.

I'm sure there are dozens of other ways of getting in after the initial break, let's hope your question prompts a flood of responses.

Garry

--- 帖子 #398 ---
probably not the most competitive in terms of fees etc, but since the bulk of trading is in writing options, I tend to use optionsxpress for almost all of my trading, be it options, commodities or FX futures; although I've been looking at other possibilities recently.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Hello Rathcoole, thank very much for your answer to my question about re-entry. It sounds a very interesting approach to it. There is effectively certainely different ways of approching it and that is why the response of the traders most familiar with this method is most than welcome as we can all learn from it.

When a trend develop, either on the 1H, 4H or Daily timeframe, more often than not, there is pullback before the trend resume and I am really wondering how the experienced traders with this method use it to re-enter when there is a pullback if they ever re-enter.

There can be so many ways as there are traders, so any feedback is most welcome.

One way I was thinking about a possible re-entry is when there is a "confluence" of a fibonacci level, key support or resistence level, pullback to the 5 EMA in a strong trend, all can be good ideas to re-enter. Just throwing ideas here.

Sincerely

Good work.  I presume you are trading off the 1 HR with the cross.  Do you wait for price to retrace back to the 5EMA before going in or do you take the signal as soon as the candle completes.

will this strategy work on a 5 minute chart? Provided the settings remain the same? 5Ema close and 8Ema open?

My Tp level will only be around 10 pips.

Regards,

BK

--- 帖子 #420 ---
I am not sure how it will work on the 5 min charts.. I have never tried it. If you try it, let us know how u get on.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Hi there,

I feel stupid in connection with the 5ema close & 8ema open, what are you guys talking about and can u give me some charts to explain as well please

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Did you try this 5/8 crossover strategy on hourly or 4h timeframes?

BK

--- 帖子 #423 ---
when you set up a Moving Average, you have the choice of using a varying set of data to create your average - the average of the Opening prices, Closing, Highs, Lows, median, Weighted etc etc.

Typical default is Closing, ie your average will be based on the prices closed at, over your given period.

I think what these guys are trying to do which may have confused you, is to experiment with various settings other than the default Close.

If I were you I'd just sit back and soak up as much info as you can, let the experienced guys do the experimenting ....

--- 帖子 #424 ---
hi,

i agree thinking about it, thanks

--- 帖子 #425 ---
I have only tried it live on daily charts. I am currently demo testing it on 4h. Some others have tried it on 1 hour and done very well.

Hi good thread, i looked at MA crossovers before with diff. settings but found they had lag(obviously)and much of the trend had already occured and it was almost at the end. But with your settings(5/8) i think they provide a signal in good time. thanx for sharing it. Are u in any open trades now?

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Good morning all.... Hope everyone has a good weekend and ready for some more trading... Looks like we might have a cross soon on

AUS/USD for a short

Slkosier

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Good morning, there could be a possible cross in the AUD/JPY soon.  Check it out.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
If you are trading off of the DAILY charts for AUDUSD and AUDJPY, wouldn't the trade be for tomorrow if the cross happens today?  For the hourlies, the cross has happened 4-5 hours ago.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
That's a good question, ET! I am curious about that too.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Hey Silkosier,

are you still looking at Laguerre? Or are you just sticking to the 5-8 crosses? Do you have an additional filter?

--- 帖子 #432 ---
No, not at the moment. I am just waiting for optimal settings for a trade.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
yes.. though it is mostly range bound at the  moment, if I trade a cross for this one, I would definitely want to wait for a retracement.

--- 帖子 #434 ---
This system looks great! I have not read everything yet, but do we wait for each daily candle to close?

If so, that means on this system trades are only placed at 00:00 GMT?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #435 ---
we have a cross on usd/jpy daily for a short?

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Yes I am still using the Laguerre and I have been usinf the RSI with settings 56 & 44..

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Yeah your right...it is in a ranging right now..this morning I thought it looked alittle closer...

Slkosier

--- 帖子 #438 ---
You can use MACD (5,8,1) to see the crossings easier.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
That looks very interesting..Thanks for the info Banzai..

Good morning guys

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Hey peter and silkosier thanks a lot made my first profit used only laguerre and the 5/8 crossovers. Bought at 2.0820 around 3a.m. GMT time. Made a good profit as i sold at around 25 pips higher.

BK

--- 帖子 #443 ---
I entered this one as well. Up about 35 pips now. ALso entered GBP/CHF a little later for a short. A little move + 5 or so right now

--- 帖子 #444 ---
If conditions remain i'll enter this night on GBP/CHF

--- 帖子 #445 ---
back folks, sorry I've been away a while, my pc blew up. I just bought some bits and built a new one. My spare laptop I was using is barely powerful enough to run MT4!

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Thanks for the thread. Looks very interesting. Can you guys give a summary of the pips that you made trading since using this. And can you add how many winners verses losers. This would be a lot of help. And can you tell me what you guys use as a target?

--- 帖子 #447 ---
I am glad to see lots of you doing well with this system this week so far.. I have taken a bit of a break..I made around 189 trades last month and wanted to take a break..Thats alot of trade being that I work full time and have a side job..Last month I worked on 1hr, 4hr & day charts..this month day chart only for me...Talk to you all later

Welcome back Pete

Green Pips this week

--- 帖子 #449 ---
I'm only trading on the demo for now.. but since i read this post and started using it on 10-25-07 using day chart only

i've made 19 trades. 13 positive 6 negative, of those negative only 3 showed no positive move before a SL, the other 3 I coulda stoped for minimal gains if I was watching.

I tend to protect my pips with modified SL once I'm up a bit, sometimes to my loss of bigger gains, but the 19 trades net me 266 pips. I can live with that I suppose.......

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Nothing else ??????

--- 帖子 #451 ---
I aim for 100 pips per week with it.. some times i get it, some times I dont. Some weeks I don't even place a trade, I only trade when I have an optimal setup. This way my trade is never a bad trade. If I win or lose, it is still a good trade as I stuck firmly to the system.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Peter,

I want to express my thanks for the huge amount of time & effort you put in here to Help the many of us that are working to become successful Forex Traders.

Statements like the above reinforce what I believe to be a logical mindset and have help guide me in the direction of Longer timeframes and simpler set ups.    Everyone reaches their own destination in their own time  but if the masses would read this thread & your beginners help & Jacko's thread they would find getting there much more pleasurable.  (& Profitable)

thanks, Tom

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Hello Pete

could u explain what is ur optimal setup?

regards

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Peter,good system.. the system is ema5 close and ema8 open and wait for the crossing in daily, right?

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Hi, Peter, I had some questions about the strategy. I am using a demo account for SG trader. I go to osicllator box and click moving average of the oscilaltor. A box comes up with a few fill ins. I am not sure exactly what to put in each box. The boxes I have questions for are the fast ema, the slow ema, the macd sma, the fixed minimum and the fixed maximum. I guess i just need to now where to put exactly the five and eight and if I need to put anything else in the other boxes. Also with regard to the strategy Do I just look at the point where the osma is 0 ,thats the crossover point right,and then basically go short or long based on whether the osma is going down or up, factoring in the lastd day trading. Also, the last questions I have is thier is a box in the osma that says close, open, high, low, median price, typical price, weighted price-do I need to choose one of these. Thanks for any help you can offer. I am new to alot of this stuff, I deeply appreciate any help, happy trading,

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Actually I believe Peter uses 5close ema / 8close ema.

The mention of 5close 8open was by another poster.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Hello

it would seem that you are trying to set up a macd indicator which has little to do with this system.if you just look thru your indicator list you should find a moving average .this you need too add to your chart twice ...once for 5ema close and once for 8 ema close.

can i ask if you are demoing and with what platform ...i could then explain better..it may also pay you to click the link at the bottom of peters posts ..this will take you to his excellent site.try to read thru the whole site it will most definetly help you along your way

good reading

Rye

--- 帖子 #458 ---
A cross in a nice trending market. or a retracement to support/resistance in a ranging market. :-)

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Yes, that does sound like a MACD indicator rather than a standard moving average. Are you using MT4?

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Hello Peter and let me first thank you for sharing your experiences and expertise.

I have a question, on the 5 EMA and 8 EMA, are the parameters "simple" or "exponential". I am having difficulty figuring it out.

Thanks!

Ash

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Here we go ...very first post.....

good luck

Rye

p.s.  EMA =Exponential Moving Average

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Thanks!

Believe it or not, I was using SMA but when I read the thread, I was a little confused. I thank you for your assistance.

P.S. I have been have great success with EUR/CAD and GBP/CAD. Minimum of 40 pips on the 1hr and maximum of 160 pips so far. As soon I move into a profit, I move my SL to a positive 1 pip and let it go from there.

Also, Since CAD is highly correlated with OIL, I also keep an eye out on oil prices.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Thanks man..

--- 帖子 #464 ---
another change?

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Dear Mr. Marsden, Hi, my name is Vince.  I had follow up question to your post. It is where am I supposed to put the values 5, 8 in the moving avg box. What I do is I go to indicators then moving avg, then the box pops up saying enter values for period, shift, ma method. I use SG trader  and I think I am supposed to put the values where it says period but I just wanted to check with you for sure.I know that I am not using the MACd box anymore and when I enter the values I have to do it twice, once for 5, once for 8. By the way your website is very cool and informative. Thanks for any help.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
vince,  yes you are correct.

Put a 5 in where it ask for period,

then

where it says ma method select  "Exponential",

then

do not put anything in the shift space.

IF it ask for "Apply To" select "CLOSE"

hit "OK"

Then Repeat all that using 8 in the period .

Then you might want to change one of the ma's colors to make it easier to see the different lines.

you should have 2 moving averages on your chart .

--- 帖子 #467 ---
I have had a slow and almost bad week so far...Got into a trade and went 200and somethine pips negitive and can't even see why I got in it...No cross at all...Maybe my eyes are crossed from the 189 trades last month..Must still be seeing crosses...

Slkosier

--- 帖子 #468 ---
lo. take it easy man.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
hi vince, I am not sure about SG Trader, I use MT4. You need to create two EMAs on your chart. One 5 period EMA and one 8 period EMA.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
parameters are exponential. You can use simple, but the moving averages will be more lagged. Exponential moving averages give a greater bias to recent price action.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
damn.. never deviate from your trading plan. You have done very well when you stuck to it. It took me a long time to be able to trade my strategy like a robot, but it's something we must learn to be consistently successful.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
agree with PeterM.

stick to the rules. do not have too many system in your head. even supercomputer get jammed when there is too many OS in it. hehe

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Hi Peter & all,

Just to let you know i have been very very disciplined this week and although i have been trading on a demo account, my figs for this week are

EURO/GBP = £24

EURO/CHF = £55

GBP/CHF = £60

GBP/EURO = £53

GBP/JPN = £170

USD/JPY = £80

TOTAL = £442.00

I intend to demo trade this system for a couple of weeks yet but i am very happy with my total this week, waiting for RSI crosses at 56 & 44 and waiting for 5 to cross 8 ema and i could have hung in for more profits but i am thinking like its my own money here at risk, rather make £30 than lose £30

Seems to me that nothing really moves until 11.30 gmt and again at 6pm gmt, dont know matbe just me?

Also trading the news, like today on bad GBP trade balance but i do wait a few minutes after results have come out, rather long term gains than short term losses (or Gains)

Thanks Peter for all the info you have shared with us and it is very true

BE DISCIPLINED, BE PATIENT AND ABOVE ALL KEEP IT SIMPLE

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Well I got very lucky.. it came back to where I needed and took 383pip profit...  That is one very important thing to try and do in forex...Stick to your rules and if there is no trade don't try and make one...

Slkosier

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Nice trading, I like your final line :-)

--- 帖子 #476 ---
good that u got lucky, but we don't want to be depending on luck to succeed. Like you say stick to your rules and don't try to make trades when there arn't any. I know it's easier said than done.. only to well!! good luck next week :-)

--- 帖子 #477 ---
If you've ready any of my previous comments you would know that I'm not a big fan of the moving average crossover systems, mainly because they chew up capital while ranging and the losses tend to take an emotional toll on the trader. Having said that, they seem to be very popular with people new to Forex and teach trending quite effectively. For that reason I would like to contribute to this thread.

Peter, I completely agree with you about the difficulty using this system for ranging markets. The $million$ dollar question is... when do we know when the ranging ends and the strong trend commences? The answer.... we don't, not until after the trend begins and we have hindsight. Once it begins do we know when it ends? Is it 5 pips or 350? Once again...... no we don't hence the numerous stop loss and take profit strategies that abound.

I'd like to introduce Fractals at this point. Fractals help solve the entry timing question quite well and show when a pullback occurs. They also reduce losses by forcing a trend confirmation when the pricing is ranging. Quite simply, you do not get a valid fractal when the market is ranging, mostly when it is trending. The downside is that profits can be reduced using fractals because you can miss the start of some trends but losses are significantly reduced through minimal trades in ranging markets.

How many times have we purchased in a trend only to find that it pulls back and we find ourselves waiting nervously for the continuation to begin? I recommend to anybody reading this thread to learn and use fractals to time your entry points. They come standard with MetaTrader but very few people know how to use them and they really help a lot.

If you're not comfortable using fractals or just find them downright confusing then I suggest you add an additional moving average to the 5/8 system... perhaps an EMA of 30. Wait for the trending to pull back near to the EMA 30 before buying. This strategy ensures that you're buying in the money and not paying too much.

Happy pipping.

TrevA

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Hi Trev,

Yes it is difficult to know how far to run with a short or long bet, what i do is set out my supprot & resistance lines through my chart package, then i set out my fibonacci retracement lines, and then set my fibonacci retracement lines.

All this should give you an idea where the price is going but always look at where the nearest high or low point is on your chart also.

The whole point is - What are you happy to make on a particular bet and be happy with that, i have pulled out of longs & shorts only to see it drop or rise further = MOTTO - there is always another day and markets will always be up or down, BE HAPPY WITH TAKING MONEY FROM THE MARKET and not trying to get the optimum amount of profit from every trade

By the way i have put a 30 ema on my chart and i noticed that if you are short and the next candle closes above the 30 ema then get out, or visa versa but then you could reduce your profits, i think mainly to work on your 44 & 56 rsi and then decide yourself through either your own instinct of where the market is going or what profit you are happy with

Anyway thats nmy twopenny worth for the weekend and good trading next week

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Hi Trev , I prefere use Gann hilo line to enter or exit , for me is more  near the market.

Look at the chart , acqua line is 30 ema and blue is Gann.

What do you thing guys ?

--- 帖子 #480 ---
I'm about to get involved with this strategy on a daily basis.  I've read through the thread, but can I get the latest on which pairs are working best with it?  I'd like to keep it down to about 5-6 to actively monitor.

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #481 ---
What does everyone think about that 110.74 low...I hasn't been that low since 5-1-2006 which was 108.97...any thoughts on what it might do?

Slkosier

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Looks like a nice cross on the NZD/USD for a short and on getting ready in the next day on GBP/USD for a short too..

Slkosier

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Thanks for your comments.. Fractals could be a way to improve entries for sure!

--- 帖子 #484 ---
I'm wondering if we could be seeing a carry unwinding. We have just seen a bounce at that 108.97 low you mentioned.. A break is certainly possible this week

--- 帖子 #485 ---
yeah.. i see it.. we may be too late on cable now.. I'm not sure look at it go!

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Hi Pete

Do u mean it's too late to enter GBP/USD Short cos of this fall?

Regards

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Looks like many short crosses today.  Where should we place stops if we enter?  Candles are too long to place stop at previous day.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Is there a EA out there for the MA crossover?  I love the way these indicators trade and would love to trade the 2 AM - 6AM (EST) time.  Since this is the middle of the night for me, I'd love to be able to set a EA to trade at these times.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
it might be, I would wait for a nice retracement as well as a cross in this case.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Pete

I  always wait for retracement to 5EMA but i think in our case now i'll subtract 20 pips from 5EMA

--- 帖子 #491 ---
this month been better than last month.

current update:

1400 pips floating right now.600 pips already lock

--- 帖子 #492 ---
a retracement to the 5ema.. Does that work well for you ?

--- 帖子 #493 ---
nice trading :-)

--- 帖子 #494 ---
For ....../USD better add +20 or - 20 Pip from the 5EMA depends on the order buy/sell  but it work perfect with GBP/JPY / NZD/JPY / AUD/JPY

Regards

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Great - thanks for sharing :-)

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Wow it has gotten quiet in here... Well I have only done 140pips this week so far...but that is fine with me as long as I am not in the red....

--- 帖子 #500 ---
I sold GBP/USD @ 2.0750

Closed it @ 2.0450  +300 Pip

that cos i wait for full retracement for 5EMA

Slkosier,

Do you still use the Laguerre indicator? If so, would you mind telling me the settings? I took the Lag from another thread; however, there's several different settings that were used there. I'm currently trying the combo of two lags: one at gamma .85 and the other at 0.55. Also, are you using this only on the Daily charts? Thanks for the help.

HJJ

--- 帖子 #502 ---
yes I am still playing with that to see how good it works with this system..I am only using 1 Lag at the time...I use it with setting .55..Yes I am currently using it on the Daily chart..Let me know how it has been working for you too...

Slkosier

--- 帖子 #503 ---
can u post a mthod with useing Lag in more detail

--- 帖子 #504 ---
hany,

my feed shows the 5EMA touch at around  2.0696.    If the previous 4h candle wasn't so large wouldn't you be more likely to be entering as close to the 5ema as you could before the entry point could move away from you?   I wasn't watching that candle but I imagine that is just kept going north up and up to the 2.0750 area.

Also, did you take any profit or move your SL at the subsequent 2.0525 -2.0550 resistance area or did you just let the whole thing ride down to your 2.0450 TP area?

nonetheless, awesome pips on that trade

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Hi guys/gals...as a new comer I have posted at least 3 request for help, information or clarifacation of indicators or terms, since none have responded to I assume you are too busy to help....Thanks Anyway and have a HAPPY THANKSGIVING..

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Does the RSI in any way influence you whether to go long or short?

If you wait for price to retrace back to the 5EMA before entering, how do you know it will not go against you?

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Hey SFG7th,

I went back to Nov 1st looking for your requests -- didn't see any. Are you on the right thread? Clue me in too where your requests are.  I'll try to answer them as best I can in a semi-timely manner.

HJJ

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Slkosier,

I find that the double Lag works well with the smaller timeframes. Especially on the USD/JPY, EUR/JPY, GBP/JPY pairs. On the 4H and daily, its looks like the 0.55 gamma Lag is all that you need. I followed the 15M TF rules for trading with the double Lag from the thread "simple method for scalping any pair on 5 min chart". There's plenty of examples of charts on that thread. (thats for 4newbie post 504) . Also note that on the small TF I only shoot for 8-12 pips. I just took 11 pips off of USD/JPY a few minutes ago.

HJJ

Just to let everyone know (especially the newbies) I have a open position on EUR/CAD since 11/07. I am up over 1300 PIPS thanks to Peter's system. It works great. I have incorporated the stategy into all of my longer term trades. Good Luck to everyone!

I jumped in on the Eur/jpy and gbp/jpy....scared of the other 2 right now

Question for the "experts" on the 5/8 cross indicator that bonzai put up here...

I've seen where there will be a green/up arrow, and then a few bars later another green/up arrow...without a red/down arrow between them.

Why is that?  If it hasn't changed to red/down, why would it show another arrow?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Ok folks...get this thread pumpin again!

I added MACD to the 5/8 chart to get verification.

I noticed "headfakes" when arrows came up, and with the default Macd settings, it didn't help any.

So, I changed the MACD settings to 5fast 8slow, but left the sma setting default, and backtesting it looks like a better "helper" than the MACD defaults.

Being somewhat of a NOOB, does this make sense?

--- 帖子 #528 ---

Hi PeterM

Thanks so much for spending so much time sharing your system and for rest of you guys that added your bits and pieces too,I spent this weekend reading through the whole thread and this really looks like a simple and effective system. I am going to give it a try for the next few months or so.

What I like about this method is that one does not have to look at charts all day, so this one may be great for me because of my busy schedule.

I just have a question about the USD/JPY, As I am posting, it looks like the dominent trend on the daily chart is down and looks like there may be a buy in the next few days, Would you take the buy even if the dominent trend is down or would you wait for the following sell signal if there is one because of trend direction?

Current (DEMO) Trades Open

GBP/CHF - BUY - 2.1664

GBP/USD - BUY - 1.9464

EUR/CAD - SELL - 1.4811

Happy Trading

Richrichie

--- 帖子 #533 ---
I have also started doing demo on this method, and so far it looks very good. Last 2 weeks alone I managed to amass about 1200pips doing trades on 3 JPY pairs. And this method has also given me back my life, no more sitting in front of the screen, and enduring the stress...

What I noted also (after 3 weeks of rummaging through the charts), if there has been ranging days, the up/down arrow indicators tend to be very short lived. Also, I use the MACD to confirm convergence.

Back reviewing the charts, the daily charts show a longer term profitable trend. So even if the dominant trend is in the opposite direction to you trade, there is enough pips to be made before a reversal occurs.

I check my trades every morning during the first 3-4 days, just to check on the retracements. After that, the pips are all positive. I set a trailing stop of 200 pips.

That is why I like thie method alot too..You don't have to be at the computer all day.. This method has done really good for me.. Just make sure you follow what the charts say and not your feelings.. I have made that mistake and it really got me bad...

Slkosier

Glad to see people back in here again..Lets keep this thread going

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Yeah, this is the thread that got me started to profitable trading. Thanks to Peter, yourself and everyone else who contributed and answered my questions!

--- 帖子 #536 ---
I agree with you Aman Trebor when you say that you take your life back because of daily charts, but whats driving me nuts is the waiting around for the profit on the dailys, ITS SO SLOW!!!

I am so used to the very low time frames to get in and out of a trade quickly but, to tell you the truth it has not been working for me. Trying to do PC support and trade on the go is a mission.

think its early days for me still with this method and have decided to trade this method for a month or two on demo. There have been countless methods I have tried in the past and they worked for a while but then suddenly turn into loss after loss, trade after trade.

Okay, all three trades I entered on monday morning are now in profit. Dont want to get to excited, I am just going to play the system and try my best to leave emotion out of it. I prefer to manually trail stops because one seems to have more control over the trade. I parked a PSAR on the charts today and plan on using it to show me where to trail my stops every day.

Well done on your 1200pips, Aman Trebor

Here is my current trade status:

LONG - GBP/CHF 70 PIPS - Entry@ 2.1664

LONG - GBP/USD 90 PIPS - Entry@ 1.9464

SHORT - EUR/CAD 70 PIPS - Entry@ 1.4811

Eyeing out the USD/JPY, there is almost a signal to buy, its a counter trend trade though!!!!

Happy pipage

delete:You mean, cross going DOWN?: (sorry I read the wrong chart)

Didn't have this chart on my "radar" so I missed out on an early entry.

Here's how I make my entry:

1. The day the arrow appears is D. The day before is D-1.

2. I will wait for bar on D to close.

3. Run a Fibo line from D-1 to D.

4. Entry is at 50% Fibo.

Of course, the above condition is not always met. I started testing this only 3 weeks ago, so there may well be many other possibilities. But the above is a start.

I noted that RichRichie's entry on the GU is smack at the bottom of the trough. How did you set your entry, Rich?

Note: Made new trades last Friday (8 in all, different pairs), 3 stopped out. Shouldn't have SL on demo trades, it stopped the continuity of observation. I am logging my trades, for future ref.

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Yes, 5-ema had crossed down on 8-ema.

But I will wait until the arrow appears. Got to stick to my "rules". I am testing this.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
I waited for the cross only. When I entered the next session, I was only using the ema cross at the time, I did not have any other indicators on my chart, I have closed all three of my trades now for around 200pips in total(got chicken trading against the trend on the other 2.)

Today I demo traded the GU on a 4 Hour and shorted after the cross only, I must admit that I may have entered a little too soon on 4hour GU and much prefer the daily charts.

I like your entry idea on the lower time frame with fibs entry , Aman Trebor, will give it a try on the next setup.

GBP/USD (4hour)  entry @ 1.9846 short (may loose this one!!!)

The arrows trouble me Aman, I cant set the arrows to the same parameters at my ema's. The arrows show up 1 or 2 candles too late!!!

My EMA's are set as follows:

5 EMA CLOSE

8 EMA OPEN

now I cant seem set my arrow parameters on OPEN or CLOSE price, I can only just set the period value, I am tempted to dump the arrows and only use ema crosses, with RSI and LAGUERRE as secondary confirmation.

Am I missing something or are the arrows supposed to pitch up after an EMA cross?

There she goes guys

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Try setting your ema cross signal to 4 and 7 vs 5 and 8, looks like arrow shows up on the crossing bar and shows up one bar earlier than 5/8 cross. You may get more false signals this way but if you are using other indicators to confirm, this could help to get you in earlier.  I put both on a chart with different color arrows to compare.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Neither can I, unless I have the MQL source code, and I know how to program it.

I am using the same crossover signal posted on this forum. However, I prefer to follow the arrows, as it means that the trend is well underway. I have previously tried to enter on immediate crossover, but it's risky. It's better to miss 100 pips, than to lose 100.

My main aim is to avoid trend changes that are short-lived (e.g. GU 14-24 Sept, 26-30 Nov 07). I don't want to be caught by surprise, since I only check my trade twice a day. To avoid this, I use the "MACD Traditional" indicator. If the fast/slow ema's are on/near the zero-line, I don't trade.

As I said before, there are enough pips to be made (for me, that is) even if I missed a bar.

3 of my current trades:

EU BUY 1.4673

AU BUY 0.8791

GU BUY 1.9767

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Thanks for the pointers guys. Thinking about it, the arrows are a second ema confirmation, as you put it Aman, once the arrows shows up, then its a higher probability that trending action has started

Entered long on the EUR/GBP @ 0.7473 this morning and things are looking good, Also my GBP/USD is now 146pips in profit so far, but I think I am going to abandon to 4Hour Charts and only use dailys.

Have a good weekend traders, chat to you guys next week

Hi, guys,

I try to write some EA for this system, and I'd like to think this is the final one. I tested it with Alpari UK and IBFX demo accounts, and there's some data error in chart. So I doubt the result.

Can you please help me test this with the right data, from as many broker as you can?

Sorry, for now I can only send you .ex4 file for the EA. I'm still not sure with the result using the right data.

Please help.

Thank you.

Thanks for the EA, I'll give it a try

which TP an SL did u use ?

SL = the opposite crossover

TP = only 120 point trailing stop for GBPUSD

Thanks.

Hey Traders

Got a stop loss idea this weekend, sorry if this idea has come up in this thread before, not sure

Place a 20 period SMA and an ATR on your chart, at the end of every daily session , SUBTRACT the ATR value from the SMA value on a long position to get next days stop loss value.

On short positions, ADD the ATR value to the SMA value of the closed day session to get you stop loss.

I got this volatility based trailing stop idea from a stock trader.

Happy Trading

Hi,

this is my first posting on this thread and thanks to Peter for sharing the system and to all those who have posted on it- seems a simple yet powerful system- easy to follow on the dailies too.

I echo a lot of the sentiments expressed on this site in that I have been drawn to intraday trading over the years, with a mixed bag of success- some good runs and some disastrous ones but not really making consistent returns over the long term.

I have never traded daily charts before but am hoping that they make for an easier trading life!

I have a signal short on GBP/JPY-generated on friday- anyone live trading this?

(I decided against it- purely because I dont want to take all the signals to start with but wondered whether anyone had the same signal and if anyone has taken it?)

I am currently long on EUR/GBP at 0.7538

regards,

Mark

Hi Guys been following this forum for a while, hats off to Peter and the rest of the guys, I have been trading on and off for about 18 months bought several indicators, strategies, all singing and dancing alerts, joined trading rooms with up and down success. I have read literally hundreds of forums followed certain criteria and had charts with so many indicators that my head exploded (twice ha ha) My trading now consists alot of trendlines, fibos and using shorter timescales.

But may I say this is by far the best forum I have come across, you guys should be knighted by the queen for all your hard work and persistance.

When I first started trading I read the belony about 95% of traders failing, where do these figures come from, I personally trained myself with the believe that I would not be one of the 95%, but there again I considered the 5% of so called successful traders, what do we deem a successful trader? millionaire trader, not lost all there trading account or maybe someone that makes a nice living out of it, not an all singing and dancing supertrader but an ordinary Joe like us guys who have maybe found a little successful strategy that pays us a nice little profit, all be it not the holy grail, (it dosent exist, anyone who says it does is a fool) but a strategy that wins a bit more than it loses, and I believe that Peter and you guys have found something close. I hope to be a part of this forum now and hopefully you can see I am a very positive guy (even after my multitudes of losses, but thats the cost of my education) Positivity breeds profit and success.

Anyway I have just noticed a possible cross on the hour chart down on the usd/cad, what do you think.

Once again respect to your guys

I took a quick 10 pip profit on this trade, in the testing stage and dont really like placing trades after 15.00pm UK time, brokers are very aware at this time and as we know they all have families and are thoroughly nice people and wouldnt do anything to try and relieve you of your hard earned money. (A broker friend advised me on what great people they were, ha ha)

Nice start though and looking forward to learning and earning.

Me too, almost quit on this one today, but price is climbing again..... YeeeHaaaa!!!  Going to move my stop when the candle closes today for a guaranteed profit

Richrichie

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Yes Ritchie got quite a ring to it, The simplicity of it is the key I think, it's been said in this thread, that the more indicators and signals you have, got to conflict somewhere and the underlying thing about forex is the risk, so I dont care if you have 20 indicators all saying buy/sell, there is still always a bit of risk, thats why no such thing as the holy grail, I also believe in a bit of sixth sense and gut feeling sometimes and of course positivity. Too many indicators can literally talk you out of it.

Respect to you all

Tom(UK)

--- 帖子 #562 ---
I must disagree with you Tom, there is such a thing as a holy grail in trading, ITS YOUR BRAIN!!!  It just requires a little training, thats all.

Took a trade today on the us/jpy, but took it too late, I went long at 107.65, the cross over signal was at about 106.70, my mistake was not looking at the trendline which is very solid at 107.73, writing this as a part of a learning curve, to always check trendlines, I am still in the trade and at time of writing 1.00pm gmt I am about 20 pips down, I am no different to anyone else in that I hate losing but as long as I can learn where I went wrong that is a major benefit, best I can hope for me thinks is a breakeven.

u/j ema`s didnt cross until this morning

surely if they stay crossed today then the buy would be tomorrow?

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Hi Croeses

Yes i actually went off the hourly chart, still trying to work out timescales actually, I guess we must be taking the gmt from 12 midnite to 12 midnite if you get my drift, that 107.73 trendline, resistance did its job, bouncing the price right back down again, if it does break it today, should be a good long.

respect

Tom(UK)

--- 帖子 #575 ---
hihi, newbie here.  a question.  what is the success rate of this cross over method ?

--- 帖子 #576 ---
I cant really comment as I have also only just started this

you need to do this on demo for a few months

or just back test some pairs

--- 帖子 #577 ---
ok. will back test it

this dailly method seems to require a lot of pips as stop loss.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Hi Tom

Another thing you should always check is the range at the time you take the trade,if there has already been a large move,than there is isnt much left in the "tank" to go any further. By the time you took the trade there was already a +100 pips move.You always have the next day

Hope this helps

My advice is try and enter the market between 6.00am to 7.00am Uk time,that really is the time the "big Boys" start trading.

Yeah I am always up early, and sit at my comp at that time, I have come from daytrading to dailies, so trying to get my head around longer timescale, I saw the us/jpy cross this morning and didnt get in there, doh!

Any advice kindly appreciated, have you been trading this way long?

Tom(UK)

--- 帖子 #582 ---
If its worth anything,this was a correct long entry for the way i trade,but i shorted the Euro instead,but did not think it would "tank " the way it did.

Tom always plot the 60ema and the 200 ema as well,on the Daily,4 hr,1hr and 30 mins and observe what the price is doing at these emas

Say u get a signal on the daily,go down on to ur 30 mins,plot the trend lines,support/ressistance etc etc and observe the above mentioned emas ie check the Euro this morning and the price failure to go above this emas,plus the topping candles on the 30 mins

However mu question is to the uk crew.....

Can i ask what platforms your all trading...are you spread betting or mt4 etc..

live or demo....

i,m having probs with my current broker ...seem to get their feeds from another planet cos their nothing like real price at certain times

thanks all

Rye

ps dont want to hijack this thread its excellent ..but just a quickie ..ooh errr missus!!!

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Tom what i mean is the 200/60 ema,do not have to be crossed on the 30 min,the very fact that the price struggled to go above thses emas is a good signal to take short trade.

Check the USD/JPY on the 30 min and in particular the 200 ema,see how it supoorts the price

baz

--- 帖子 #594 ---
personally I`m trading on MT4 with FXDD

demo until end of month then I may go live, results depending

I would recommend not to get involved with spread betting

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Tom if u get a signal to go short,than u have to pull the trigger,my point is these 2 ema seem to be mostly watched,u have to be aware about them.

As for tommorow,there may be sideways action on Euro,watch out for Macd divergence on 60/30 mins if a new low is made first thing am.

If we get a good "FLAG" pattern then yes a short is in play.

Just be careful.

PS PLOT MONTHLY/WEEKLY HIGHS AND LOWS as WELL on YOUR CHARTS

regards

baz

i have to pick my boys now,catch you later

--- 帖子 #596 ---
baz

I thought this system was to keep it simple

2 ema on a daily when they cross pull the trigger

ok we have added 2 more ema 200 & 60

but why are you going down to 30 and 60 min with Macd and watching for flags?

just curious

cheers

--- 帖子 #597 ---
I am really sorry about this.This my way of trading,ie TOP DOWN approach

IE start with the daily,then look at 4 hr,then down to the 30 min to pull the trigger.

If evverything lines up on the charts,i will pull the trigger.My point is these 2 emas act as support/ressistance, and i dont want to be on the wrong side of them if they are acting as pivots on the 30 mins

Ok look at the Cable chart for yesterday on the 60 mins.Now see what happens when it meets the 200 ema.Now if your daily had indicated a short trade,this would be a good place to do it.Check the candlesticks as well,all pointing to a rversal.

Regards

baz

--- 帖子 #598 ---

suppose we have to adapt to these systems

if this works then thats great

Thats right,find a strategy that fits ur trading style.I like to fine tune my entry.I did not short Cable first thing am,as my 5 min system indicated a long.

So i waited untill later to short cable.

Learn about fibonacci,and always keep learning about trading.

Regards to Macd DIVG. How many times traders buy/sell on breaks of new highs or lows only to see prices reverse.

A simple glance to macd on the 4/1 / 30 min charts can save u ££.

If there is Divg,then u wait before rushing in,and possiblly wait for a retest of the Break out point before entering.Just look at the 5 min Cable chart yesterday,a new low,but divergence on Macd !!. So you wait

Thanks Baz for great advice, if you get a chance could you outline your trading method, I can see that ema's are so very useful, its at just what order to view them, its great that this thread started off so simple using 5 and 8 but now with you mentioning 60 and 200 and also using other indicators like macd, can get a little confusing, but the advice is terriffic and I could see all your reasoning behind the 60 and 200, great respect to you.

Hi Darren

Have a look at the 30 min cable chart with Macd plotted below it,and look at the lows made on monday,and then compare the lows made afterwards.Slightly compress the chart to get a better feel.

The point is,it should not put you off taking a trade,but wait until a optium entry point is available.

Macd Divg occurs on all TF,but it is only a tool.So dont be put off in taking trades.

Stick to your plan

--- 帖子 #625 ---
hi guys,

how do you determine when to exit or the target profit ?

when the 5 ema cross back 8 ema again ?

--- 帖子 #626 ---
the euro is now hitting the 60 ema on smaller time frame.

for this system, do we take care whether it will hit 60 ema on which time frame ?  or as baz says  30 mins, H1 etc ?  do we go down further to 5, 15 ?

--- 帖子 #627 ---
when to exit a trade is really down to you

whether you have a pre determine amount

or when the emas cross back

its your call

cheers

--- 帖子 #628 ---
as I mentioned to Baz

this system is worked on the 2 emas crossing each on a daily chart

not 5, 15 or 30 min

but if you like Baz want to add things to the pot and stir them up

who knows what might come out of it

cheers

--- 帖子 #629 ---
The thing regards the lower TF emas,observe the price at this levels.Look at the candle patterns.

Try and take/stay in trade in line with your hgher TF and ur risk tolerance.

At this momment the daily is short,there is indescion on the 4hr but mildly bullish,the 1 hr has turned bullish,and so has the 30 mins as well.

Keep an eye on what happens when the price tests last weeks lows,if they get there.

As for me i stay out until the rate decsion is out and than decide afterwards if i am going to trade or not or just wait next day.

When you enter a trade,you must have a plan,ie stoploss, trailing stoploss or even Targets for profits

darren,for ur learning purpose,check the 60 ema on the 30 min Cable,and see what happened today.

The 7.30am candle was the place to short on a close.I have my own strategy that gives me my trigger point.

--- 帖子 #633 ---
ok, well said!  loss of opportunity is better than loss of capital.

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Daren go over to Euro/yen.Its at its 60 ema on the 30min,and it seems a bearish engulfing candle pattern is taking shape ie 10.30 am candle.

baz

--- 帖子 #635 ---
yeah, it keep testing the resistance of the 60ema on the 30 min cable...

saw the 730min candle.. u are saying u would short there, bcos of the retracing from the 60ema? .

--- 帖子 #636 ---
yeah, saw it, bearing engulfing~ so trending down soon?

jus tested 60ema....

--- 帖子 #637 ---
I trade day only,but i use the higher TF for direction,and take trades in that direction only.BUT the lower time framrs have to play Ball,otherwise i stay aside.

The 200 ema and the 60 ema are the most watched and acted upon by traders.Trend lines can be indvidualised by each trader,but the Emas are unversaly the same on all the traders charts.

As for me the Emas rule.

regards

baz

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Darren please i dont want to confuse you,but at 10.30 close of the candle i would move down to the 5 min chart to fine tune a possible entry point.

Ie break of trend lines, support, 123 formation, break of the 5 mins ema and crossover etc

baz

ps at this momment the 30 min ,60 min,and 4hr are not playing ball !!

the daily is short

--- 帖子 #639 ---

anyway, on the 15 min, euro hitting the 200 ema......

jus closed my Cable for 61 pips....dun

iic...guess to really trade well , really hav to cover all angles....  still got a lot to learn.  be meticulous.

eur/yen dropping

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Hey thats great, now go to the 5 min cable and plot the 5 ema,and check the price of cable regards to it.

You could have waited for a candle close above that.Just a thought for you.

No i dont trade below 30 min, but will use 5 min to fine tune my entry

Baz

--- 帖子 #642 ---
by the way, i added this Fractus indicator. read it in earlier posts.

suppose to help check for pull backs....

now testing if its useful.

now my charts full of indicators , unlike the day from the start of the simple 5 and 8 emas only. haha

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Like i said, these 2 ema are watched on all time frames,and if u learn how to combine Fibos, you have many reasons to pull the trigger.

But tell me we could easily clear 20+ pips on that euro / yen even if the hiher Tf are not playing ball

Yes

My advice,dont use too many indicators,EMAS are a true guide to trend

Take care

baz

Paralysis By Analysis if too many indicators

--- 帖子 #645 ---
hmmm....icic...

anyway,i did check the 5 min, but did'nt reference it to any emas....was looking at the candle something like a morning star..., so i exited...

will take the 5ema into considerations too.

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Rogers and thanks Baz !

--- 帖子 #647 ---
One bit of advice.

Create YOUR OWN tradind system,create aplan, and be diciplened enough to follow it thru" irepective to what "others " are saying.

This will make you successful, i gurantee it

baz

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Regards Fibos,place Fibo levels on Euro/yen from yesterdays swing high to todays low.See where the price stopped....at the 50%.

So you had 50% fibo,rejection at the 60 ema, and bearish engulfinf candles

3 reasons to pull the Trigger if YOU are Scalping.

Pocket money for us to spend !!

baz

--- 帖子 #649 ---
yeah~

saw the 3 now!

Ok mate Good luck for your future trades.I am going off the forum,and focus on the trades after the news.

Hi Mate

Baz is a good guy, great stuff he comes out with I have adopted the 200/60 ema into my setups, works great, the fibos powerful too

Respect

maybe I should have move SL down, but urmmm

too pips on the table

--- 帖子 #655 ---
Greatttttt Trades Mate, can i make a suggestion.U may consider trailing ur stop loss on the 4hr at the 25% fibo levels ie using th lasy swing high,to the lowest swing low if you are short?

Anyway something for u to think about

Well Done with ur Trades,the drinks are on you !!!

baz

--- 帖子 #656 ---
once again the power of the 60 ema can be seen on the 30min charts on the Euro,Cable, Euro/Yen, just take a look at the drops today.

Peters system was already short on the Dailies,so taking shorts on price failure at this 60 ema was all you needed to take intraday trades

best wishes

baz

--- 帖子 #657 ---
thanks for advice will take note

cheers

--- 帖子 #658 ---
What fantastic indicators these are, every time price goes near them, they bounce the price back, best resistance lines I have seen, no wonder all the bank traders use them.

Respect to Baz for info on these, thanks man

Tom(uk)

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Tom

Its great u are using this Emas,but use it in conjuction with other signals to pull the trigger ie a conflunce of indicators at the same point,and than trading with the trend of the higher TFs.

regards

baz

--- 帖子 #660 ---
Thanks Baz, any chance you could outline your strategy, the few points you have mentioned have been really interesting and helpful, now looking at emas alot differently, I use to trade permanently on a 15m chart, using 8,3,3 stochs and taking triggers from ib's and ob's and divergence and convergence, and using a interday fibo, it meant sitting in front of a computer all the time and time now does not always allow it, its great scouring these forums but you can get boggled by all the strategys and info available. Im looking to try and trade now on a longer tf and not be in front of comp so often and use other indicators to access that.

The different timeframes you mentioned and setups coming down off varying tfs is very interesting especially using the ema's.

Could you elaborate

many thanks

respect

Tom(uk)

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Hi TOm

Regards to my strategy, its really difficult to put it down on paper.As i have not mentioned,but i even go down to the 1 min chart for a trigger point.

But lets take the System we have on this Thread ie 5/8 cross.

What you can do is start on the Daily,say you get a cross.

Then go down to the 4 hr to confirm that You have a cross ther as well.

But on the 4hr you need to plot the Fibos,Look for Divergence,place your Trendlines,Support lines etc.

Follow this up with the 200/60 Ema averages.Should you get at least 2/3 conflunces at a Price level on this chart, Zoom down to the 60 min chart.

Check your 200/60 emas, check for candlestick patterns,check for Double tops, etc.

If it looks intresting go down to the 30 min,apply the same test,BUT now look

for a trend line break that you can see easily,or a EMA break.

If you can see the break,THEN make sure if say you were shorting say,that you can also SEE a RESSISTANCE point above.

Ie it could be a higher Time FRame Trend line,or a moving average,or FIbo level,and also another short term fibo level as well.

The more reasons ,the more a LOW RISK,HIGH probability trade can line up.

I am not sure if this helps,but YOU ARE a HUNTER and we wait for the optium

set up to catch the "PREY" or TRADE.

IT may work or it may not.

I use MACD and CC.Thats it.

And another indicator called "common sense" used with Discretion

Peter i am sorry if i have moved this thread into another direction,but if i am able to give "IDEAS" you wont mind.

At the end of the day,Tom, YOU WILL BE SUCCESFUL only when you create something that suits you.

You may agree or disagree with the way i trade,but it is something that FITS

MY PERSONALITY and thats what you shoul do.After that just stick to it and plan your trades,and bring total dicipline to them.You cant fail.

Regards

baz

--- 帖子 #662 ---
What are your settings for macd?

Tom(uk)

--- 帖子 #663 ---
There are 2 MACDS i use.One is my own settings that i use on the 30/5mins,which at this time i am keeping it to my self.THis is the Heart of my strategy and i wont pull the trigger without this in PLACE no matter what direction the trade is moving.

The second MACD settings i use for all other time frames is 13,21,9(8).

Once again i use this on the 30/60 min for my exit.

Regards

baz

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Ok this should be my last EMA.

The 610 ema,plot this as well.Compare this ema on the euro 4hr charts,and see where the price dropped to yesterday and hesitated.

Is this a short bottom,cant tell,but we observe on lower TF for clues.

baz

--- 帖子 #665 ---
I agree with that.. always best to make your own system. Other peoples systems may not work for you, especially if a degree of discretion is involved.

Is this a valid short on USD/CAD daily?

--- 帖子 #667 ---
No, it isn't. I would wait even though (imvho) USD/CAD has turned bearish.

--- 帖子 #668 ---
According to the system this is valid though, correct? You are just saying it isn't valid due to the bullish sentiment (I think you meant bullish instead of bearish).

Just trying to make sure I understand - sill a noob on this system.

--- 帖子 #669 ---
yes you are correct this is a valid short

but just take a look at the data

and make sure that Fridays ema`s have crossed over, first

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Ok, if you say so. I take no responsibility because the EMA's have not crossed over. I've been burnt before in pulling the trigger too early. I would wait until the EMA's cross over. Even the gentleman's indicators do not show the Ema's crossing over.

--- 帖子 #671 ---
I dont trade this pair thats why I cant comment

thats the reason I said take a look at the data if there is a cross on Friday

then its a valid signal

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Hi

If i were you i would wait for more data,there was a sharp decline on friday,there may be a retracement.

Just take a look at what happened to GBP/USD after NFP. You had a similar report on the canadian on friday.

Hi Guys

Regards to all the Ema i pointed out. The 610 ema on the Euro,as u can see how it acted as support,and see at the price action afterwards.

Use the Ema"s as dynamic support and ressistance points.

Chose the direction of your trade,and then watch out for the Ema"s.

These are plotted by most proffesional traders,maybe not all but i bet u at least 2/3 .

The 200 Ema and the 60 ema.Both are FIBO related.

Now the Euro is(probably) going higher,and hence is approaching the 60 ema on the 4hr.

So watch for either topping action or otherwise on the lower TF,and act accordingly.

All the best

Baz

Ps Keep an eye on the Canadian 30 min chart.Its approaching its 60 ema.

Also on the Canadian take a look at the 4hr chart in repect to the 60/200 ema.

There is a 50% fibo retracement,A bearish engulfing candle pattern,and we also have our 2 favourite Emas acting as Ressistance.

--- 帖子 #679 ---
Dear PeterM,

Can we say that the following signal for GBPJPY is a correct sell signal as per your criteria but it failed?

--- 帖子 #680 ---
quite possibly.. I didn't trade last week as I was traveling. It doesn't win 100% of the time, nor does any strategy. It is the long term picture that is going to give you good returns.

--- 帖子 #681 ---
I dont believe in predicting the future by looking in the past.It doesnt make sense.

Sorry whats a Holcombe? Why did you post these Indicators?

--- 帖子 #685 ---
This system has worked great, I just closed 130 pips of profit on the first day, which makes me very happy. Personally I will close all trades and reopen them on new candle day, this is somewhat of an experiment I am trying, but I will most likely lower my lots as the more and more day candles close away from the original cross. Hm...but this system shows a lot of promise, it is so simple that I love it....

Good Luck

TheLegace.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
Hi Legace:

I was wondering if you were still using this system and still profitable.  People get excited about something and then lose interest, even if it's going well.  I've been demoing this for a couple of week and doing o.k. I still make some bonehead moves, but like you said, I like it's simplicity.

Jim

--- 帖子 #687 ---
This system works awesome..Just follow Peter's rules adn what ever you do don't go by any of your feeling, do what the charts are telling you with the rules..I was doing awesome with this thing and did the feeling thing and lost a bunch, but also made alot at this if you look at my postings in here...I took along break but am getting back into this..Peter has an awesome system here...

--- 帖子 #688 ---
Agreed....trusting the method and having patience to trade less but with a higher confidence and a better chance at a positive outcome is a good lesson to learn. Trading the H4 and the dailys with the trend has been a good thing for me. Glad to see you back at it and the thread still kicking.

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Does anyone have a reliable indicator indicator that does the following.

1.  Allows for audible alert.

2.  Allows for selection of various types of moving average

3.  Allows you to specify alert within some range of the cross actually being made.

I trade on the 15 minute charts, and I have a nice indicator downloaded, but it normally is signaling too late.  I'd like to use this to wake me up as signals start in the London session while I'm sleeping in the usa...est.  Often on smaller 10-30 pip moves the current indicator isn't alerting till the move is half over, and i'm half awake.  So I'd like to get alerted in anticipation of the actual cross to give myself 5-10 minutes of review time.  Thanks for any help.  I'm posting on this thread as it is obviously a group of people who are using ma crosses.

--- 帖子 #708 ---
You might take a look at this  Alert FX....... however on the TFs you are trading it would probably drive you crazy as would any other alert on such a short TF.

Hello. I really enjoy your theread. I'm trading using 3,5,8 MA. I'm also using stoch and RSI for confirmation. But generally I'm basing on MA. Today I entered 3 profitable EU longs @ .4770  .4810 and .4870

It's nicely working strategy which I really appreciate.

Maybe we can bring this theread to life and call some good entries. I will post my entries during friday's session on EU pair.

RumiPL,

Great to hear your success!  Could you share how you trade this system...especially how you utilize the three EMA's?

How does your strategy fare on ranging markets?

Many thanks!

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Whoops!  Are you using SMA's or EMA's?

--- 帖子 #715 ---
I will try do describe my strategy. Generally it's very simple. As it's known MA strategie's are not working during horisontal trends.

I'm using 3 MA's 3,5,8. I go long when 3 MA crosses from down 5 and 8 and go short when 8 crosses 3,5 from down.

For confirmation I'm also using stoch and RSI.

I'm using trailling stops. When my position is closed I'm waiting for another direction signal or I'm opening new position. That depends on current market situation.

How are you working on MA strategy?

Mike

P.S I'm using simple MA's

--- 帖子 #716 ---

Hello jgadefelth.

I'm day trader and I'm trading on 15 min and 30 min charts.

My stoch is set on 13,8,5 and it's working fine for me.

I got RSI set on 8 but I don't use it all the time.

I've trading this system for about a month and I earned 60% during that time.

Today's result 190 pip from 3 positions.

I use 20 pip stoploss while opening transaction and I'm using 20 pip trailling stop but I'm also keeping an eye on charts of course.

I'm still working on my system to make it more effective. Do you have any suggestions, I would be glad to hear more experienced traders.

I hope this helps.

Good to hear that i wish u all the best and many pips i am also a beginner and try to find a system and i must say i like this thread alot.

Slkosier    pls tells us more  you are also using a lower timeframe  4 h 1 h ??

best regards

--- 帖子 #723 ---
firstly have you applied moving average to 'CLOSE'?

if 3 MA is above 5 and 8 on 15M do you confirm that with the 30M chart?

Which pairs do you trade this with?

Which session gives you good results?

--- 帖子 #724 ---
Slkosier  and Rumpipl   i have hard to see how you only have such a small stop as 20 pips on 30 min and 15 and can ride those small trends so that you  including the spread and losses still go + pls pls cant you post some charts.

my 2 cent if we use 5ema close and 8ema open it seems that we enter the trade often a candle before  5ema close and 8ema close.

Also what i can see to reduse some bad trades you can wait till in a long position the prise have crossed the high of the signal bar ( the first  bar that on or after the new ema cross)   in a downcross of emas that is the low of the candle.

best regards

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Like RumiPl also said on these smaller time frames you really need to watch the chart more..Unlike when trading the 1 day frame you don't really have to watch it..I use the smaller one when I have the time to watch it..Thats why I like using the 1 Day alot more being that I am limited on the time to watch alot...If I don;t see any crosses on the 1 day thats when I go to smaller time frames to see if I can scalp anything while wait for a cross...

--- 帖子 #726 ---
i see but i got the time to sit in front of the computer all day and ill wnt to make as mutch as possible, but still i having hard time to find a good trend with winning that covers the loss and the spread and the stopploss only at 20 pips    pls cant you post somepics

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

it is up to you if you want to trade lower TF's. I don't like staying at the computer and let the trades run on the Daily TF's. Some people think this is just too simplistic because thier is not a load of indicators. Personally I use the EMA crosover signal with 8 open and 5 close, look at support and resistance as well as candle patterns.. As Peter states it works well with trending pairs. This is a Pip machine which requires patience and holding trades for a period of time. So if you like to get in and out within a few minutes on lower time frames it might not be for you. But many are using on lower TF's with success. It is a matter of developing something that works for you. SIMPLE IS GOOD. SIMPLE CAN MAKE PIPS. THIS IS BOTH AND IT CERTAINLY MAKES PIPS. Trading less minimizes risk exposure and since it is off the daily does not get clobbered by the news as much. Look back over the setups on NZD/USD NZD/JPY GPB/USD GPB/JPY and you will see the potential for PIPS. Happy Trading! Peters first Post is as simple as it gets and explains the essence of it. YES it really is that simplistic.

--- 帖子 #741 ---
Thanks pipsnagger for your post.   Well i dont like a few minutes i like to have 1h or maybe so the wins most makes up for the spread and the losses that can be hard on lower timeframes than that also the hifgher timeframe the better trends (better formations of trends more even  not so many super long bars and somthing like that).  I like to work and sit in front of my computer all day if that is what it takes i loike to make the most of it but like i say the broker i use have a spread of 2 and 3 pips of thwe most common pairs and 7 or more for some. So i must make up for that.    Also i thinking of how to close a trade in profit shall one have a target is that the best option or some indicator (that lags )  or some sort of pattern ?.

It looks verry good but im not sure i can use it on lower timeframes or on 4h i like to have a stoploss of 5pips or 10  it looks good when u look at the 4h bar but i think that the price gose up and down inside that bar make taking out my stoploss. I have a hard time investigating if  thats the fact but i have looked at daily bars the price crosses the opening price several times and therefore make my outbreak strategy useless.   Anyone know how it is  about this ?

best regards

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Yes thats around it..I got in at 1.4202...

I am going to try and start posting my trades to see if you all are seeing th same thing and see what you all think...

--- 帖子 #757 ---
SLkosier,

I read all your post and it is very helpful. One question, when you see the cross, you buy on the open of next bar or you wait for certain price limit you set. Just trying to understand your entry logic after the cross.

what is the stop loss you set?

Please suggest

--- 帖子 #758 ---
Thanks slkosier that would be werryhelpfull for me and others it is werry kind of you.

the first trade we are talking about i can only see it go up to 4269 after that it drops down heavy before it goes over 4269. You sad all you trades was winners for  100 pips or more how did you do with this one or are my software different here from yours in telling the price ?

best regards

--- 帖子 #759 ---
From the trade I got in at 4402 it went up to 4384 before dropping down a bit..what time frame are you looking at? I am on the 1hr

--- 帖子 #760 ---
1h also yes but before that my drop to 4095 before turning up to the point u say

best regards

--- 帖子 #761 ---
i am testing the 5/8 ma crossover with 1M timeframe. And RSI 14 to confirm the signal (when it goes under or above 50, trade).

I made today 74 pips with it. only EUR/USD. SL 10 & TP 20.

--- 帖子 #762 ---
sounds good if not the spread had eaten me alive on that my spread is between 4 and 6 for buy and sell

best regards

--- 帖子 #763 ---
Thats good Artov..keep us informed with your trading...maybe that could be use to scalp some trades while waiting for bigger time frames to come in...How many trades was that to get 74 pips or was that one trade?

--- 帖子 #764 ---
slkosier cant you pls try to show the trades you mentioned before on a picture i still have a hard time to get it because on my chart it went down verry mutch before it went up to the target you mentioned ?

best regards

--- 帖子 #765 ---
I'll try to get it..my platform is'nt working right now..what trade is it you are talking about and which target?

--- 帖子 #766 ---
"Well on my EUR/USD chart I show a good cross on Sept. 17th 1400hr"   this one and in the same thread you say all the trades you made is for 100 pips or more   you told me you buy at 4202 if i dont mistaken and then it go up but on my chart before it gose up it goes down around 100 pips from 4202  how di you do there ?? both my software  show me the same chart with that downswing before it goes up Eur/usd

best regards

--- 帖子 #767 ---
I have it posted here so it won't take up alot of roomon this thread..

--- 帖子 #768 ---
The only way you can ever see a cross is if the current candle moves in that direction, and it closes since it is possible that before the close the cross may not happen.  To trade the cross, you will actually be trading at the close of the current candle.

--- 帖子 #769 ---
Thanks slkosier now it becomes mutch more clear to me hope u see that i have posted some new questions. it is verry intresting to see how you trade and i wish you many pips. And also some wins on the race track

Thats good...I hope I can help you in any way I can..I will try my best... And thanks about the wins..I hope so soon too... I try not to get to greedy on getting alot of pips and set my tades to a certain amount even if it goes higher or lower..as long as I am getting positive trade..

Happy Trading

What do u have as a target ? and as a stopploss ?

best regards

--- 帖子 #773 ---
Hi guys. I've been using the 5/8 for my daytrading on 15 min charts. I played around with filters but gave up on them. I just use support and resistance and a bit of common sense. I take off 2/3 at 1:1 and let the other one run. Stop and TP are 25 pips at the moment. Only trading the E/Y. Anyone else doing 15 mins?

--- 帖子 #774 ---
Are there anyone that use this strategy intraday 1h or so that is intrested in describing his strategy what he buys on what he exit on stopploss etc ??

best regards

--- 帖子 #775 ---
I have been following this thread for a while and am looking forward to start trading it live either tomorrow or Monday, still not clear on value of Sunday trading. I will post my buys to help keep this thread alive and active, I'm planning on daily trades only. I do have one question for all here, which currencies are you trading - are there a specific group that seems to work well, or are you just watching all to find a cross. Appreciate all of you out there, your posting are so helpful!

--- 帖子 #776 ---
Ok, I have made my first two live trades (even though I'm still a bit unsure about Sunday trades):

Sell EURCAD @ 1.5013

Buy CADJPY @ 103.02

Both trades are late, but have confidence I'll get a few pips out of them.

--- 帖子 #777 ---
The chart below will explain it better.

A 5/8 EMA cross [label 1] will only occur upon the close of the candle [label 2].  If the candle [label 2] does not close, there is no guarantee that the 5/8 cross will occur.

You can enter a trade as soon as 5/8 EMA cross occurs at candle [label3].  Ideally, you should wait for a retrace back to the EMAs before entering a trade [label4].

There is no gurantee that the trade will be profitable.  If you look at the cross prior to label1, the cross upwards, that would've been a short-lived long trade.

Trading off of the daily cross only, you need a large S/L or exit on the re-cross in the opposite direction, and enter a trade in the opposite direction.

--- 帖子 #778 ---
This strategy indeed is great. 5 EMA and 10 EMA also works nicely. IT also works pretty well on hourly charts.

--- 帖子 #779 ---
This system is VERY similar to what is recommended by BabyPips. They use 5EMA & 10EMA, daily, RSI(14) to confirm, SL=30. You can see it here: http://www.babypips.com/school/setup...six_steps.html

--- 帖子 #780 ---
You dont mention the stoc an also have they done some backtesting on it ?

best regards

--- 帖子 #781 ---
I do not think Stoch is really necessary, I just use the EMA cross for this system.  If we wait for a trace back to the EMA, I always wonder how one can tell if its not going to cross back the other way [I guess that is why we have S/L].  Actually, I see this EMA cross used on even smaller TFs for many of the systems posted in FF along with other indicators.

--- 帖子 #782 ---
Is anyone still here? Was thinking of posting a new thread wheni came across this, so there  wont be any need for that since its about the same strategy though with a little different approach.

I once traded EJ solely on 15mins too bt still with my filters.  You'll miss some good trades though, bt saves you from lots of bad trades too.

I'll try and keep posting my trades as they come, so i can learn from the veterans av read about here.

Lets keep the thread alive i believe its a good tech.

--- 帖子 #783 ---
Hello all,

Here are the trades for today.

I trade majorly 4 hrs and dailies, bt scalp on 1 hr and aim 30pips (when signal is in line with 4hr trend as shown by my trendlines).

If i have to take a signal that is counter trend to 4hr, i do so when it breaks my price channel and aim for 15-25pips.

1. 2 trades on GJ 1hr tf: 1 by 6:00 candle and the other by 14:00 candle. (Apari UK charts)

I'll post chats and other trades later

http://C:\Users\THE LIBERATORS\Desktop\gj.gif

--- 帖子 #784 ---
hello All,

Today was yet another profitable day. I took only 1 trade but still waiting for the right entry signal on the following pairs  UCHF, EU, EJ, CHFJ.

My only trade so far for today is GU long. Signal was at the close of the 8:00 candle (4HR tf Alpari uk),

Entry: 1.5070

Exit:   1.5207

+137 pips. result

--- 帖子 #785 ---
Hello everyone,

I did not take any new trade today because i was out tending to some other business.

However a GJ trade i'd been in for a while now, finally closed in my favour for 50 pips.

In my next post, i'll give a detailed description of how i use this EMA cross over and a few indicators' settings to spot signals and how i enter a signal.

But I'll like to state here (having seen some probably success hindering assumptions posted here) that while it is good keeping it simple, it's better to know all you can in the world of forex trading- No knowledge is lost they say, and that is absolutely right and applicable to forex.

I'm more of an harmonic trader, i know a lot about chart patterns too, i know about candle stick formations, i know the importance of S/R levels or pivot points, i know wave patterns, i know about the use of fibonacci, and the use of trend lines has been fantastic and revealing to me, i know other things.........

Pls dont get me wrong, am not trying to blow my trumpet or sell myelf here, rather i'm making a point and that is- at a point in time, your knowledge base of forex trading will be your saving grace. PLEASE dont limit yourself to just one simple formular or technique and expect to make it big in forex trading, you'll soon burn out or get frustrated out of the market- Little wonder why some thread fizzle out.

Seek to increase your knowledge base and in the long run you'll see how these things  add up/correlate, there and then will you be able to understand better how the market works and be among the few that's making success out of this business.

So many free qualitatively informative sites abound out there, go seek them out and improve yourself and stop limiting yourself.

YOU CAN MAKE IT. All you need is just a little hard work(studying). Do that for a while and enjoy the fruits-Benefits  thereafter.

Remember, if Obama can, so can you.  Stop searching for the holy grail of forex, you've found it already.

Yes. YOU are the holy grail, go discover yourself and succeed

Good morning all,

I took 2 trades this morning based on the daily TF. But i broke my own rules (indiscipline) and the trade is presently in red.

Let's examine the 2 trades and how i've broken my rules.

1. AUDCAD.

There was a fresh cross of the EMA after the close of yesterday's candle on the daily TF (see first attachment-arrowed candle) and this cross also met my criteria. This would have been ok to trade.

Being an harmonic trader, i zoom down to the next lower TF and see if the candle gives a signal too, then trade.

In this case i should have zoomed down to the 4hr tf which would have held me back from taking this trade at least for now. (The close of the last 4hr candle did not give a signal-see 2nd attachment arrowed candle).

The 2nd trade has 2 mistakes:

The first is has explained on the first trade, the 2nd mistake is that the Ema cross on the daily is not a fresh cross. See attched graphs.

These trades might close in my favour, but it's not a wise thing to break your trade plan, it exposes you to more risk. Let's see how the trade turns out.

But i sure do hope someone learns from these mistakes.

--- 帖子 #787 ---
When there's a fresh cross of the Ema, i look at

1. the difference between the stoch and its signal values, if its up to 10

2. if RSI is at 52 (for long) and 48 (for short)

If these are met, i zoom down to the next lower TF and wait for the candle to close then take trades if the signal is also confirmed.

Like i pointed out earlier, while it is good to keep it simple (and am sure this is simple enough), it is better to know as much as you can. To this effect, i apply other things like the use of TL to further filter my signals.

But so far, zooming down to a lower tf has really been of immense value to me.

A classic example of breaking my lower tf rule is my trades of today.

Well, its 15gmt and my 2 trades are still in red. Looking at the 4hr tf, i would not have entered the daily signals yet as no closed candle in the 4hr tf  is yet to give me a valid short entry signal(so am presently being punished for breaking my rules.)

--- 帖子 #788 ---
How do you cnfirm from lower TF? Same rules as for Daily?

--- 帖子 #789 ---
Hello Dezil,

When i get a signal say on 4hr, i look at 1hr and see if closed candle is also pointing in same direction with my signal. if yes, i trade,if not wait until a closed candle gives you signal on the lower tf then trade.

If by the time i get a signal on the lower tf,the 4 hr tf is no longer in the initial direction of the signal, i wont trade

Yes i apply this to the daily too. A look at my last 2 trades will lay more credence to this- on the 4 hr tf, no signal was given for a short, so i would have stayed out and not be in red as i am now.

--- 帖子 #790 ---
good morning all,

I did not trade y/day, hence my not posting. Mostly i trade 4hrs and dailies, but today, most of the pairs are not looking so good as regards signals, so i would be strict on the 1 hr tf entry today-all conditions must be met before taking entry

My last 2 trades are still in red (the price to pay for not being disciplined).

--- 帖子 #791 ---
D Liberators,

Thanks for your encouragement and explanations. Which moving averages do you actually use? Do you use the same ones on all time frames?

Gila

--- 帖子 #792 ---
I use EmA 5 applied to close  and Ema 8 aplied to open

Stoch 8, 3, 3

RSI 13/14  at 20, 40, 60, 80 levels.

As at now, i have a signal on USDCHF on the 4hr tf, but still waiting for 1hr tf to align.

--- 帖子 #793 ---
1 hr finally confirmed the 4hr signal, but ema cross is not good enough so i go down to 15mins. to view Price Action.

Saved from yet another false signal. Might still turn out good though (which will give a better entry than just jumping into the signal at the close of the cross candle.), but given the time elapsed so far i might just give up on this. Moreso, on the 4hr tf,

stoch is turning the other way

Rsi could not blast past the 60 level mark to show uptrend is strong

and some other reasons not suitable for this thread (let's keep it simple).

so, keep watching.

--- 帖子 #794 ---
Hey just one question!

How do you set your limits?

I mean How do you set your stop lost and your take profit?

Crossing EMAs is really helpful for signal confirmation

but I feel a little uncomfortable if I don’t know how to set a protective stop loss on every trade entered.

--- 帖子 #795 ---
Hi,

I'm sorry for not replying before now, i've been a little bit down and needed to rest my body and brain, thank God i'm back to action now.

I do place my stop loss above/below the cross candle (high/low of cross candle + 10pips + spread)

My initial take profit is 50 pips and then risk to reward ratio of 1:1 after which i break even and allow the trade to run, moving stop loss to S/R levels or high/low of previous 4hr bars.

I'll be posting today's signal and trades as i take them.

--- 帖子 #796 ---
Hello  everyone,

I have  a few signals so far this morning this new month and as usual i'm waiting for the lower tf to bring me in some in the 1hr tf and some in the 15min. tf.

I have cross over that met my criteria on the 4hr tf on the following pairs

AUDUSD, NZDJPY, SGDJPY

AUDUSD>a good cross on the 4hr for a signal, but on the 1hr, i noticed the bar closed as a bullish candle (which signals a retracement up), i then zoom down to 15mins tf and confirmed the retracement, so i wait for the lower tf's to align and i then place my trades and my tp's as earlier explained.

I'll like to state here that i only note my stoploss on my charts, i dont place them on the trades.  I close a bad trade if and when prices close above/below my stop loss level on the 4hr charts. (this is my own way, its not an advice please).

The reason why i do it this way is because, most times you find that price hits your stop loss level but does not close at tht level rather returns in the direction of your trade even up to 400 pips atimes in your direction

--- 帖子 #797 ---
On the daily tf, I have crosses that met my criteria on EURAUD, EURJPY, EURGBP.

I'll be waiting on the 4hr tf to align

--- 帖子 #798 ---
All signals today are in green some already given 100+ pips.

All it takes is patience and discipline. I'll post one of the charts.

My criteria for a good signal are simple.

1. EMA cross must be a minimum of 8pips difference btw ema5 and ema8

2. Stoch must be crossed up/down, and the difference btw the stoch and its signal must not be less than 10 (not 10 pips as in ema but 10 units.)

3. RSI 14 must be 52/48 for long/short signals respectively.

Only 1 exception of any of these 3 criteria is allowed at a particular time. If a signal is failing in 2 of the criteria, i dont trade.

Once i get a good signal on the 4hr tf, i go to 1hr tf and see if all criteria are met, then to 15mins and place trade if/when all criteria are met.

Simple and effective.

Simple and effective.

My coonection is slow, not allowing me to post charts at the moment, so i'll try and explain my criteria without a chart for now.

When you open up a data window, you see a list of all the indicators and their values on your chart.

Take a look at the stoch, you'll see something like

Stoch. (8,3,3)         14.2433

Signal                    14.4052

In a case like this, the soch is crossed down.  The difference btw it and its signal line will be (14.4052-14.2433)=0.1619..... This is not even up to 1, not to talk of 10units.

In the case of the ema difference, you measure in terms of pips (i'm sure we all are familiar with that).

well, got to go now, i'll be posting a little write up on how to draw an effective trend line soon.

I learn this from a good fellow trader (naijaforex) Mike.

keep pipping.

--- 帖子 #800 ---
hello People,

Hoe you are raking in green pips. In line with my promise, please find attached a little write up on drawing an effective trendline.

I believe this is a powerful tool for your success in this business.

Prrices respect TL's a lot and once price breaks a TL, retests it and fail, it in most cases signal a break out and if further confirmed by a good signal (ema cross), you can be 80% of a sucessful trade.

TL's also act as a PRZ (Potential Reversal Zone) and i look out for a good cross at PRZ close to a TL.

So many ways you can use TL in a trade, but most importantly, learn how to draw a good proper TL and watch how price acts at a TL point.

I see a lot of garbagge on the net on how to draw a TL, even by so called professionals and veterans, i didnt know i was doing it wrongly too, until a fellow trader (naijaforex/Mike) mercifully taught me the right way without charging a dime.

So, freely i have received, freely i'm giving it away. Hope this helps someone out there.

Cheers.

--- 帖子 #801 ---
good morning

I realised i did not properly attach the file, so am going to do it again now, sorry for any inconvenience caused.

I got signal on USDCHF, waiting for 15min/5min. to align for me to take entry

Also i'm eagerly watching and waiting for a short signal on the EURCHF. I'm expecting a fall down to 1.5115/1.4942 region. The present 4hr candle might close as a tweezer top and this will further highten my expectation.

--- 帖子 #802 ---
Good morning

I did not trade yesterday, had some other things to attend to, however today trades will be done with uttermost caution.

I have long signal on EU, but not taken yet for 2 reasons: the 1hr lower tf is yet to align. Secondly, my analysis shows EU is at a potential reversal zone (PRZ) of 1.2814 area and if that resistance holds, EU might begin a short trend but with the NFP expected to come out pretty bad today, the resistance stands the chance of being broken, so, i will be exercising caution on this pair.

I'm also looking for a possible short on UCHF and ACHF (signals from yesterday-4hr tf) but lower tf is yet to align.

I cant overstress the need to always go down to a lower tf to confirm and enter signals given on 4hr tf.

I've been trading this way for more than a year (when i learnt the ema cross over from another thread here in this forum- ''the key to the mint'') and it's saved me from lots of false signals, and also given me better entry points.

Wish you all happy trading.

--- 帖子 #803 ---
wow - if you jumped on board the euro-train on the 5th - you should be planning a sweet vacation right about now. who knew???

--- 帖子 #804 ---
Thats the potential of an EMA cross using the right criteria. Did i hear somebody say all indicators lagg?

--- 帖子 #805 ---
nice post,

Peter have you ran the method in a tight sidways market yet?

--- 帖子 #806 ---
Seems Peter has abandoned his thread for now.

Using this method in a sideways market is not advisable.  What you can do in such situation is to go to a lower tf and scalp-assuming the 4hr tf is choppy, you go to say 15mins/5 mins tf to trade. - bt this is not advisable.

Generally i stay off sideways market.

Just my 2 cents

--- 帖子 #807 ---
Or you can add 1 more MA..... a slightly longer tf say 21 period and use it to help with those range decisions.

--- 帖子 #808 ---
just came across this thread and trying out the 5ema close / 8ema open cross on 4hr ( with Alpari ) and found it quite good if i were to..........

1) look for a clear cross of the emas with separation and angle especially after prices had gone up or down quite a lot

2) enter on the close of the 4hr bar after the emas crossed ( entering when price retraced to 5ema gives better profit )

3) stoploss just above / below the high / low of the said 4hr bar ( better if the 4hr swing high / low is really close by )

i tried on eur/usd and gbp/jpy and found it gives a 1:1 reward quite often and more often 2:1 reward if trading in the direction of the 200 ema.

also, i've not taken into account of any trendlines or support / resistance. i just try to avoid ranges.

anyone care to see if my observation is even half-right ? especially those guys that have tried this for the last few months.

--- 帖子 #809 ---
Has anyone tested this system on any other pairs and done fairly well?

--- 帖子 #810 ---
seems that gbp/usd and gbp/jpy did well..................so far i've been observing on the 4hr charts with Alpari

but since different brokers has different 4hr charts, i wonder if there's a big difference with the other brokers...........

anyone looking at 1hr charts ? Oanda has the 3hr charts but just plain 5 and 8 ema ( but no open for 8ema or close for 5ema )

--- 帖子 #811 ---
It works well on all pairs especially when traded in line with the daily trend on lower time frames.

I use RSI 13 and stoch 8,3,3 to filter trades.

--- 帖子 #812 ---
Peter,

Are you or anyone else out there still using the 5ema x 8ema?

Thanks,

Mike

--- 帖子 #813 ---
Hello Mike,

Yes I'm still using the 5/8 EMA cross.

--- 帖子 #814 ---
Hi D liberators,

I've been trading this on the 4hr TF and i use the high or low of previous candle for sl or the atr.  Do you have any suggestions for tp i'm never really sure where to place it.  Appreciate any and all comments,

Thanks,

Mike

--- 帖子 #815 ---
Hi,

I have manually backtested 9 pairs (spread of 5 pips or less) with the 5/8 ma method (+CCI(14)) for the first three weeks of June on 4hr charts. I used a 100 pips SL and TP. Once 50 pips up, I moved SL to BE +10. I had 20 wins and 4 losses for a total of nearly +1400 pips. I know it's not like live trading, but it shows how interesting it can be. I took three trades on demo since monday of this week and I'm +250 pips so far. I moved my SL to BE + 50 pips on one of them when price was almost at TP level, but then it reversed.

You can see an example of my setup on the picture. I use 5ema (close)/8ema (open). The first blue histogram is MACD (5,8,1) to simulate the EMA crossover as proposed by Banzai earlier and the second colored one is MACD (30,48,1) to simulate the crossover for the daily chart.

The rules I follow is to enter a trade when the EMA has crossed on a closed candle, then check if CCI(14) is over 55 for long or under 45 for short and then enter only if compatible with the daily MACD (green over 0 for long, red under 0 for short). I am also considering entering short on dark green daily MACD and long on light RED MACD (see smaller arrows).

Money management can be improved, like closing part of the trade when TP is reached and let run the rest of it with maybe a trailing stop. This is a very simple and promising system.

Regards.

Chamane

P.S.: I need a customizable MACD for close/open price on fast and slow EMA. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #816 ---
Replace CCI(14) by RSI(14) in previous post.

Sorry

Chamane

--- 帖子 #817 ---
Hi Chamane,

Thanks for the reply.  Have you tried using the 2 lot approach yet?

Thanks,

Mike

--- 帖子 #818 ---
No, but I will probably use it soon. Maybe something like cashing in at 2/3 of TP for 1 lot and moving SL to BE with trailing stop of 25 pips for the other. I will have to look at what others think about that keeping in mind the risk to reward ratio.

Regards

Chamane

--- 帖子 #819 ---
I was curious to see how this strategy is profitable on the 4 hr TF in the long run. I manually backtested AUDJPY, AUDUSD, CADJPY, CHFJPY, EURCHF, EURGBP, EURJPY, EURUSD, GBPJPY, GBPUSD, NZDJPY, NZDUSD, USDCHF, USDCAD and USDJPY. Overall, I came up with over 15000 pips since January following the rules in my previous post. The win/loss ratio is around 78%. The pairs with JPY gave the best results and EURCHF (62%) - NZDUSD (67%) the least profitable results. Of course I couldn't have taken them all otherwise I would have gone over 2% of my investement in trades in many occasions.

I used 200 pips as SL and TP instead of 100 pips for GBPUSD and GBPJPY because of their higher volatility. Using 2 X ATR(13) as SL and TP seems to be a good estimation. It looks like the strategy works well with other timeframes. I will have a look at daily charts.

Chamane

--- 帖子 #820 ---
Wow, that's a lot of work!

The 78% success rate is quite appealing.  Whcih are the highest currencies, I may ask?

Also, Although I am not a programmer, this seems like a very easy strategy to program into an EA, as my only problem with the method would be getting sleep!

Anyone know of an EA that could implemnet this?

Michael

--- 帖子 #821 ---
You can have a look at my results in the attached file. I would add that when price was 1/2 TP level, I brought SL to Breakeven + 10 pips. When price reached 3/4 TP level, I brought SL to Breakeven + 1/2 TP. I didn't consider the trades stopped out at BE + 10 pips in my results. There could be some other way to manage money. This is just a start for me to evaluate the system.

Chamane

--- 帖子 #822 ---
have you tried with 5_Ema_Close and 8_SMA_Open??

i'm trying with SMA and using the narrowing of the 2 mas instead of the cross as enter signal.

It seems to work well. I will attach later the indicator I'm using to notice the narrowing

For now, I am only using the cross of ema's but I could use the dark color of histograms (see pic) wich represents the narrowing of the lines as you mention. Those histograms use only close ema's and I am looking for one where you can change the settings for open. When I get a signal from the histograms, I check the ema lines to make sure it's a close/open signal.

I also backtested the daily/weekly charts combo from January and here are the results:

AUDJPY: 3 wins 0 loss +900 pips (SL/TP=300 pips)

AUDUSD: 3 wins 1 loss +450 pips (SL/TP=300 pips

CADJPY: 4 wins 0 loss +1200 pips (SL/TP=300 pips)

CHFJPY: 5 wins 1 loss +1050 pips (SL/TP=300 pips)

EURCHF: 2 wins 0 loss +450 pips (SL/TP=300 pips)

EURGBP: 4 wins 1 loss +450 pips (SL/TP=150 pips)

EURJPY: 4 wins 0 loss +1200 pips (SL/TP=300 pips)

EURUSD: 4 wins 0 loss +1050 pips (SL/TP=300 pips)

GBPJPY: 4 wins 0 loss +1750 pips (SL/TP=500 pips)

GBPUSD: 3 wins 2 losses +200 pips (SL/TP=400pips)

NZDJPY: 3 wins 1 loss +600 pips (SL/TP=300 pips)

NZDUSD: 4 wins 0 loss +800 pips (SL/TP=200 pips)

USDCHF: 1 win 1 loss 0 pips (SL/TP=300 pips)

USDCAD: 3 wins 2 losses +250 pips (SL/TP=250 pips)

USDJPY: 2 wins 2 losses 0 pips (SL/TP=200 pips)

Total: +10350 pips

Slightly less profitable than the 4hr/daily charts combo, but more practical for those who like to sleep...

i modifie macd to have the slow line open i hope its what you want i dont have the macd with color change like your if you send i can modifie

i work since long time now on this cross and its one of the best you can find on 4h see my thread on WPS  http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif

--- 帖子 #826 ---
Thanks a lot! Your indicator seems to be working fine. It signals the ema cross one candle ahead of mine as it should. I enclosed two MACD indicators you can work on for the colors. I personally use the first one that doesn't need the signal line. I am actually looking at shorter timeframes for the strategy. It could be more appropriate for smaller equities.

BTW, what is WPS?

Chamane

--- 帖子 #827 ---
here the modified macd i try in little time frame the best for me seems 2H

Merci mille fois! It looks quite sensible to changes in the narrowing of the cross. I found your thread. Very interesting. Thanks again.

Hi,

maybe this helps to see the rsi<>45/55 more clearly.

--- 帖子 #830 ---
Yes, sometimes you can't tell if RSI is over/under the line or not. That will surely help.

Thanks!

Chamane

--- 帖子 #831 ---
From last week's trades, I had NZDUSD and GBPUSD srill running. They both reached 50% of TP this morning (Monday) so I brought the SL to BE + 10 pips. Now they are over 30 pips and I'm sure it's going to be all winners for last week.

I just took another trade on EURUSD 4hr (see pic). What I find the most reliable is to wait first for the 5/8 emas to cross on the higher timeframe (second histogram). Only then look at the 5/8 emas cross in the same direction on the current timeframe (first histogram). Take the trade if RSI(13) is over55/under45 (last two indicators). I plotted a 10 sma (shifted 2 - HLCC/4) wich shows the same effect as a 5/8 emas cross (see WPS thread).

For the exits, I am still looking for the best solution. For now, I stick to:

SL = 2 X ATR

TP = 2 X ATR

When price reaches 50% TP, bring SL to breakeven + 10 pips.

The win to reward ratio doesn't look that good, but from what I observed, the win/loss ratio is interesting. One solution I like is to trade two 0.5 lots. Once TP reached, close one lot and bring SL of the other one to 50% TP. Then trail stop the price with the three bars technique, i.e. bringing the SL at the lowest/highest of the last three bars in order to catch the big move.

Any idea welcome.

Here are my frist two trades for the week. For EURUSD, I decided to secure my pips this morning and got stopped out at 50% TP, but it appeared to be the right decision.

Vertical lines show all conditions fullfilled for a long entry (first MACD (25close,40open,1)>0, then MACD (5close,8open,1)>0 and RSI(14)>55 for long). Horizontal lines show entry, SL and TP levels. So starting off this week with +150 pips.

Hi,

nice to see that someone optimize his exit strategy. How did your tests on shorter timeframes ended?

--- 帖子 #834 ---
I backtested 30min and 1hr charts for June and got unsteady results. Some pairs showed even negative results overall. But I used the narrowing of the EMA cross (changes of color of MACD (25,40,1)) instead of the cross itself (MACD above/below 0) because I wanted to know if it would give more interesting trading opportunities. Now I'm convinced that it doesn't. Visually, I'm quite sure that shorter TF's like 30min are still interesting if using only the cross of the EMA's and forget the narrowing. I am demoing it right now. 4 hr charts seems to give steady winning results so far.

--- 帖子 #835 ---
I've been working on a set of rules that would allow me to trade a set and forget type of system. I chose the daily charts because it only needs les than an hour of work per day. Here are the rules:

Indicators:

- 3 EMA close

- 5 EMA open

- 30 EMA close

- 50 EMA open

- RSI(3)

- Starc Bands for stop loss (ATR=13; MA=1; KATR=1; Shift=0)

- Starc Bands for take profit (ATR=13; MA=1; KATR=1.5; Shift=0)

Entry long:

- 3 EMA crosses 5EMA upwards (closed candle)

- At the time of the cross RSI(3) is greater than 55. If not wait for next cross

- 30 EMA has to be higher than 50 EMA

Entry short:

- 3 EMA crosses 5EMA downwards (closed candle)

- At the time of the cross RSI(3) is less than 45. If not wait for next cross

- 30 EMA has to be lower than 50 EMA

Stop loss - take profit:

- Stop loss is given by the first Starc Band (1.0 X ATR(13)) and take profit by the second (1.5 X ATR(13)).

I started with the 5/8 EMA cross, but tried 3/5 and found it more sensitive and it gave good results on daily charts (see backtest results). Actually, this is simply a 3/5 EMA cross signal validated on a higher timeframe and with the RSI indicator. Money management is simple and gives a 1.5:1 return. The backtest doesn't take the spread into account, there were around 140 signals for all the pairs evaluated. June was a bad month for the system, I wonder if this was noted for another trading system.

Comments welcome.

Regards.

Hi,

Looks good and I think I will test it beside my main thv system. maybe I'll choose the 15 min tf.

An alarm for the cross would be a nice idea.

--- 帖子 #837 ---
I am curious to see the results of your tests. I would guess that you would have to change the settings somewhat because of the whipsaws of shorter timeframes. Maybe getting back to 5/8 ema? I don't know. Anyway, I enclosed my template and indicators so you can use what fits your needs. There is already an alarm (arrows and sound) for the ema cross.

Chamane

--- 帖子 #838 ---
I have been successfully trading using a system involving a 5/8 EMA cross for nearly a year now.

I manually look for divergence on a higher time frame MACD and/or STOCH and use the 5/8 cross as my trigger.

Out of curiosity I downloaded the alert from post #203 and it is actually giving me good signals.

if you check it out you will find it gives you a large number of alerts but only a few arrows indicating a proper setup.

The audible alerts are nice but there are far more audible than the visual arrows.

The arrows are what i am finding to be more accurate.

I know absolutely nothing about programming so I am not sure what all is written into the script but many of the signals are coinciding with my own manual signals.......hmmmmmm..

Any Ideas.

Is this a similar technique to what you all are using???

i've read thoroughly through the previous posts and i'm not really following the technique so well.

--- 帖子 #839 ---
Wow.. Looks like alot of people have been doing real good with this system. I have been out of it for awhile now. I am going to get back into this system again I might be alittle rusty..lol...

--- 帖子 #840 ---
Looks like a good cross for a buy on the EUR/USD I am up on it right now..

--- 帖子 #841 ---
Yeah, everything set for a good trade from yesterday's cross. This will probably be my real swing trading technique. My backtests convinced me (see post #838). I didn't even try to improve the strategy and I'm sure it can be done. For instance, stop loss could be brought to breakeven + 5 pips when 20-30 pips gains are reached (or like on the picture right now in case price reverses) or closing part of the trade when price reaches 1XATR. I haven't played with those possibilities lately because I was looking for short term strategies. I think most of the times false signals occur when market is ranging. I tried the Bollinger Squeeze indicator to avoid those situations. It helps, but not perfect. I also have Choppiness index, but I don't know what setting to use. Any ideas are welcome.

This weekend, I will backtest July and August 2009 and maybe 2008 so I get better overall picture.

Only a suggestion but do you tried the rainbow to avoid choppy markets?

--- 帖子 #843 ---
But I don't know if it makes sense to use the rainbow and macd.

--- 帖子 #844 ---
I suppose the rainbow is a group of moving averages, right? How do you use them to avoid ranging market?

By the way, my use of the MACD in my chart is only a way to show the cross of EMA. It is not standard setting.

Hi,

you can read the part of this blog which deals with the rainbow to get a short overview. http://www.bustathief.com/earn-money...rend-follower/

--- 帖子 #846 ---
Thanks a lot. I'll have a look. I think that wichever the indicator you use for identifying choppy markets, the first one or two signals of a trading system will always be false before that indicator triggers. I will probably stick to BBSqueeze (BBands + Kertnel channel) for ranging situations.

Chamane

--- 帖子 #847 ---
Yes I think the best is always to use what fits you most (and works )

--- 帖子 #848 ---
To start off i am very new to forex still so dont fall off the deep edge of the pool if some of these questions sound dumb...

1: Is this a good way to trade without sitting infront of the computer all day?

2: what times are you finding your self tradeing the most?

3: At first (post #1 he mentioned using SL from previous day closing) you all still using that?

4: Lastly, If not using SL do you use TS alot in this strategy?

All help would be great for I am starting to use Real money next week after 2 months of demo account, currently using big dog strat and doing well, so far im still ahead . Although colleges starts soon and cant sit in front of computer endlessly till next summer break.

Thanks and hope you all make many many pips!!!

--- 帖子 #849 ---
Hi,

I have only backtested my 5/8 ema crossing strategy wich is post #1 + RSI and higher timeframe filters. But I will try to answer the best I can:

1+2: it's a daily strategy so you don't sit in front of your screen all day. Review all the pairs you trade at the start of the day and enter trades when signals are triggered.

3: I backtested with 1XATR as SL and it proved to be good. But I observed a few times that more space was given by the previous day closing that would have allowed me to stay in a wininng trade instead of being stopped out. My RR ratio would have been different though.

4: I have not used a trailing stop so I can't tell if it would be better.

From my backtests, I can tell that the major constraint with this strategy is choppy markets. I didn't consider them in my tests and took all the signals I got. Although I had positive results overall, some of the pairs were showing many negative results in a row, hence showing more choppiness (see post #838 for best and worst pairs).

Chamane

--- 帖子 #850 ---
Looks like great, but you should add some classic patterns to this system.

--- 帖子 #851 ---
You're right. There are other tools that can be used like support and resistance, but to me adding RSI and checking higher timeframes was already an improvement to the original strat. If you have something in mind, go ahead. I am not familiar with classic patterns. I know how to use harmonic patterns, but not candle patterns. I would certainly benefit of your suggestions.

Hello @ all !

I am not new in this forum and in FX, but this is my first post.

At first: Thank you for this strategy !

But i´m wondering that some people post here picture from the broker oanda.

this software never allowed to put the EMA 8 applied to open and the EMA 5 applied to close.

You can only put any EMA at the closing price. this is a great disadvantage - for the strategy and for the broker (well, i am using oanda, too)

Nobody have to say something ?

Well, my opinion is, that this system works ONLY with this EMA-Changes (open and close shifting)

Anyway.

Looks like we have 5 crosses in Daily chart today:

AUD / USD (Well, the candle is a little to long, so be carefull)

EUR / USD

NZD / USD

USD / CHF

EUR / NZD

Can anybody confirm ?

--- 帖子 #858 ---
The way I trade I would not have entered on any of them because they are not in agreement with the higher timeframe (weekly). Also, except for USDCHF, they show a range situation. I use BBSqueeze indicator for that. And ecxept for AUDUSD, the RSI(8) stands between level 45 and level 55 so not enough momentum for me. But that's just me at the moment of the cross. If you consider only the cross of ema, they all show an entry signal.

I am still new to this system. I have found that following the criteria that Chamane uses a true signal does seem to be rare. However, when you get a good signal it seems to move really well. I was able to catch 400 pips on the EUR/USD trailing my stop by 100 pips. I have not had a signal since.

Chamane where can I find the BBSqueeze indicator because I have been trying to find something to help me identify range bound markets.

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #861 ---
The one I use is this one. Nice trade. If you refer to my post #838, I counted around 140 trades in a 6 month period for 13 currency pairs. There won't be that many trades, but I have more confidence in the signals I get.

Chamane

--- 帖子 #862 ---
Thank you! I like it but not sure how to use it. lol Looking at it I can see the benefits but I am not sure how to use it with this system. I am following the rules you posted earlier in the thread as they have given me the best results.

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #863 ---
Use standard settings. The green dots mean a range situation. You can also use a combination of the kertnel channel (20,1.5) and Bollinger band (20,2). When the Bollinger go inside the Kertnel, it's like having green dots on the BBSqueeze.

Chamane

--- 帖子 #864 ---
Thanks!  I was also looking through the charts and noticed that sometimes you get a cross in the direction on the longer term trend but the other indicators are not giving a signal at the current time. Then later the pair continues in the direction of the the cross and now everything lines up. Do you wait for the next cross or do you go ahead in take the trade now that everything has lined up? Thanks for helping me out! I am excited about his method as it seems very accurate and very laid back. I have a busy schedule and cant watch the charts all day.

--- 帖子 #865 ---
I make sure evrything is lined up when the EMAs cross - longer term trend, RSI >55 or <45, market not ranging. If only one of the criteria is not met, I don't enter. If they all meet a few bars after the cross, it could be good also to enter then, but I didn't backtest that option.

Hi,

I haven't checked the most recent signals. I am not trading it right now, but I will for sure. I am using it as a set ans forget technique so I don't demo to get the feel of it as I do with other strategies. I am confident with the results on daily timeframes. I will just backtest again with more recent data when I am ready to get in just to make sure the market is still offering winning setups.

Right now, I am looking for shorter timeframes strategies with less risk per trade because my equity is limited. Up to now, I have been using EMA crosses of higher timeframes (blue lines) and RSI (5 or 8) as filters to enter. Then I discovered that CCI(14) on the zero level was giving almost the same signals as the 5/8 cross. So for now, I am playing with it and other indicators to come up with appropriate filters on shorter timeframes.

This is really a good strategy .but here i have a question:why not write an EA to do this job ?

For example:

Long: 5 EMA CROSS 8EMA (up) and RSI (14)>50

Short:5 EMA CROSS 8EMA (down) and RSI (14)<50

and we could set like lots, profits,SL,ets..

maybe it can reall work..

I must to disagree on the ability to make tons of money and get filthy rich in Forex or any other security for that matter.

Good money management will make you rich. As a matter of fact, even in the worst year, if you starting with 1,000 USD capital and adjust for compounding, you can reach 100k by December, some elites can do more. Retail traders who consistently lose or break even must still think the world is flat too!

the cross over needs filters. i just watched a cross over get UNCROSSED and continue in the opposite direction right in front of my eyes. on the gpd/usd pair

--- 帖子 #880 ---
Whip-saws are common with a MA cross system . Thats where momentum , trend oscillators are used to confirm direction and momentum.

Look at Chamane's chart a few posts back. If the MACD or Stochastics or RSI ( whichever oscillator you chose to use ) doesnt confirm the Crossover you would pass on the trade and wait for a new set-up where the MA's , RSI , MACD or Stoch all agree .

--- 帖子 #881 ---
Agree with you. I use 5,10 ema's and it's not the holy grail, but it's realistic and it makes $ when you follow your system and stick to your guns. KISS is key. Can't be said enough.

--- 帖子 #882 ---
Listen to EZTrades, he's got the right idea on filtering these

--- 帖子 #883 ---
.

I've been using this cross over for years and its been so good. But it doesnt work well on its own, and one of the best ways of using MA crossovers is to apply them at the close of candle formation and not in the the process of the candle formation.

You can fiddle with some indicators and come out with your own combinations to help filter out bad signals, but i use RSI 14 0r 13 and Stochastic Indicator with a setting of 8,3,3.

Its also good to take crosses in line with a higher time frame's direction.

But if you know you dont have the time to check your system for signals as often as the time frame you use, then i'll advise you run away from this technique and look for something that suites you..

Hope you'll find this simple technique useful.

--- 帖子 #884 ---
Hi,

Thanks for your input on your tweaks of the system.

I wonder what you look for at the Stochs and RSI? Any particular levels, or just the major changes? Have you tested using MACD as well, or do you get the same results with the other two?

It has been mentioned in this thread that it is good to apply thr 8 EMA to the open and the 5 to the close. What is you input on this?

Hi,

Do you trade the daily TF as well? What differences have you seen between SMA and EMA? I think that since the periods are fairly small, the EMA is more responsive, but trading on larger TF's perhaps the differences are smaller.

Archie

--- 帖子 #888 ---
SMMA stands for Smooth moving average.

i use it aplied to median price and for only long term trades.

for short term trades i use 20 sma - breaks above - buy, below - sell.

For daytraders, i suggest using ema close 288 on 5 min tf. Only take long position when price above the ema and vice versa. Why 288? 288 x 5 = 24 hour.

Good morning/ afternoon,

Bill Williams Alligator system is very similar to what's being discussed here.

"the alligator indicator.

The alligator was first

described by Bill Williams

in his book New

Trading Dimensions.

Some software packages

include the alligator

indicator, but if it’s

not available, all you

have to do is take three

smoothed moving averages

using 13, eight, and

five periods and shift them by eight, five, and three bars into the future. The longest

period line is blue (the alligator’s jaw), the middle one is red

(the alligator’s teeth), and the shortest one is green (the

alligator’s lips).

According to Williams, when these three moving averages

are twisted together, it means the alligator indicator rests, and

so we also rest. But the longer the alligator sleeps, the

hungrier it is. So when the alligator awakes after a good, long

rest it is very hungry to hunt for food. And its food is price."

Unfortunately the software I'm using doesn't have a code for a smoothed moving average

But still working on it

--- 帖子 #891 ---
Hi,

Thanks for your input. I havenät used smoothed MA's before. Worth looking into.

What sort of exit strategies do you use, profit levels? Also, how about SL, do you watch previous high/low or previous candle?

I don't want to be negative , but I tried MA crosses on a live account ,and cross over signals will repaint ALOT ,IMO its not the best way to trade and this thread has too many replies because only the simplicity of the method.

--- 帖子 #899 ---
Brb-Fraudin ,

What do you mean MA crosses repaint alot ? MA crosses do NOT repaint. They have whip-saws ( false trend cycles ) but if you filter your trade signals by use of a larger TF and trend/momentum oscillators , this will cut down on alot of losing trades. Also , if you manage your risk , the winners on a MA cross system when you let them run is far greater than  the small losing trades. MA cross systems are probably one of oldest , simplest , most profitable systems out there if you have done the work to research them , study them and get in 100's if not 1000's of hours of screen time to gain the confidence that they do indeed work and are profitable.

RSI, Triple CCI,

MACD

--- 帖子 #902 ---
Is the candle left of signal candle painted over? Is that why we wait 1/2 hour, to avoid some of those?  The EMA signaled a long till next candle.

--- 帖子 #903 ---
What settings do you recommend for 4hr TF with MACD and RSI?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #904 ---
If I may, I would suggest to check RSI(14) on the next 2 higher time frames. For instance, on a cross of 5/8ema long on 4hr chart, be sure that RSI(14) value is over 50 on both daily and weekly charts (candles closed already). Reverse for short.

--- 帖子 #905 ---
Do many carry over the weekends? Short trading Fridays, none Saturday and short Sunday. I don't see many gaps to worry about otherwise.

Hi, to all.

Is it possible to have or change one of the previous indicator in a way that, for example:

If Fast MA crosses the Slow MA, the indicator gives "1" as result and "-1" for the opposite signal.

I need this to integrate in a simple EA that I'm making (trying) and, this way I can simplify it.

Thanks in advance,

PG

--- 帖子 #907 ---
Hi everybody,

I have a big appeal to You - is there  anyone who could, modify this indicator for signal + email alert, when 2lines crossing (on new bar)?

Many thanks.

PS: excuse my bad English pleas.

Here's a little ea that is optomised for the 4hr chart E/U

be kind, it's my first and it ws created using an online ea builder, but no losses (only in backtest) i think as a starting ground its good work!

I'd like to perhaps integrate further entries in the trend perhaps using RSI, but htis is further down the road. Also, feel free to play and experiment.

please find the set file attached also inside the zip with the ea, and strategy test results.

--- 帖子 #909 ---
i try to backtest but it can't run???

--- 帖子 #910 ---
Hmmm, it seems to work fine for me. perhaps try to change the lot size to .1 or .01 - i've tested it across all pairs, but e/u h4 seems the best. the indicators (MA's) - i should've mentioned were added seperately just so i can see when the ea's working, and manually control further entries & exits.

If changing the lot size doesn't work, can you check the journal/experts tab and see if there's any comment.

It shouldn't trade very often at all, mine took its first real trade two days ago and ideally i'd like to let it run for a few more days as it is a long term trade.

Hope this is of some help, but please let me know if you're still having issues and i'll try sort it asap.

--- 帖子 #911 ---
I should also mention -

The settings i run at the moment are no take profit, no stop loss and a trailing stop of 400. I run it on a 5 digit broker also.

The ma's are 19 & 109 - close

--- 帖子 #912 ---
Additionally i should mention that in order to DRASTICALLY reduce the drawdown, i have tested with a very tight (30pip) stop loss, and a 250-300 tp, no TS. i can't remember, i'll post it when i get home from work but it maintained a good increase in equity and kept drawdown well below 5-6%

--- 帖子 #913 ---
i downloaded the ea, placed in exports foldder, restarted MT4. i can see the ea but when i drag it onto the chart, nothing comes up. i expect a popup window so that we can specify the properties etc. i tried to do backtest also, nothing happens

--- 帖子 #914 ---
i've been racking my brain, it works on 3 different brokers i use (alpari UK, nord & fxcm) the only thing i can think of is to compile the mq4 file and restart, pending that im afraid it's something wrong on your side

--- 帖子 #915 ---
My experience is that iamboston is right. This system is best traded on 4 hour bars with a tight original stop loss. I use 30 pips plus the spread. I find it best on the trending pairs like NZD, AUD, and CAD. And it pays to use a defined target plus a move to break even after the price clears the purchase price.

You need avoid consolidation after a strong move even if you get into the trend a little late. It cuts down on whipsaws.

--- 帖子 #916 ---
Hi Chamanel, I was trying out the MACD_OsMA_4ColorH_2LVar_mtf indicator. I found that when I try to do back testing on earlier dates, the indicators are gone. Is there any way to make it appear in earlier dates?

--- 帖子 #917 ---
Just found this thread (and site) when I Googled "EMA crossover", and figured I'd join. I mainly post on hot stock market since I do stocks, but their forex section doesn't get a whole lot of attention. Anyway I set up MT4 with the EMA 5 of the close and EMA 8 of the open, and it looks to be a sound strategy. I looked at the EUR/USD daily chart and by using this system it looks like one could take a lot of pips from the banks. I'm definitely going to be testing this out. I'm also getting into using the Heikin Ashi candles for scalping, and I must say I like them a lot. I don't get shaken out of my positions as easily. Anyway I'm digging this site. Glad to be here.

Hi all: Did anyone get anywhere creating a Jaimo-Jma crossover alert for "lbs"?

i think your late on the short signal on GU. THE SHORT SIGNAL WAS GIVEN TWO DAYS AGO. it may have exhausted now, especially when there is strong support below close by.

check the 1 hour chart, it is showing a buy signal.

also, as you are trading daily TF, i hope your stop loss is large enough ? otherwise you could find yourself being stopped out even on a move of - 100 pips.

I found this EA and put it on a demo account EURAUD H1 and it works.

This EA place an sell order on the opening of the next candle after the second crossover.

You can try it out and see whether it suits your style of trading.

ps You can try setting the 3rd MA to 0, to see whether it works for 2 MA crossover, I have yet to try it out!

--- 帖子 #934 ---
I catched it when it did cross....didn't post until later. I actually have some options going and it looks like the strong move might be down. We shall see.

--- 帖子 #935 ---
Here is a trade snapshot taken 10 minutes ago done by the above EA.

--- 帖子 #936 ---
Another trade by the same EA.

This time the EMA settings are 5, 8, 8. So this is a 2_ema crosses, and on the first chart the trade is executed after the close of the candle related to the crosses of the first two EMA.

For comparision purposes, the second chart is the enlarged version of the previous post. The EMA settings are 5, 8, 12 and the trade is executed after the 5ema crosses the 12ema.

Here is something I just dont get.

People on this thread have said that simple strategies can be the best ones, that they can work.

On the other hand... people often say that eas are not profitable in the long run.

Well, I would assume that a simple crossover strategy could be turned into an ea, and if it doesnt work on the ea, why would it work at all?

--- 帖子 #940 ---
because ea's are temperamental and have a mind of thier own ! so dont always work.....!

--- 帖子 #941 ---
EA's, like back testing, are missing two very important ingredients: Experience, and discretion. Without either one of those one's trading will suffer immensely. I did back test the 5/8 once just for shits and giggles and it was less than impressive, but, when I applied it to my trading and used it with what I already used, I found it to work pretty well. That's because people, unlike computers, have experience and discretion.

I don't use the 5/8 anymore because I've completely revamped my trading style since then, but when I did use it, it did serve as an accurate guide, though not a signal in and of itself.

Hello,

how do you trade this indicator in post 931, please explain to get an idea.

--- 帖子 #943 ---
Hi, just found this forum and it looks good. An other kind of COG seems to be the indicator I attached. I use it on M5 and M15 at the same time and compare the directions. The only thing I do not use is this ZigZag thing as it is awfully repainting. I just set the first color to "none".

Does anybody have an indicator that shows the crossing of 2 MAs as a histogramm with 2 colors in a seperate window? That would be very useful for me. Thanks in advance.

Hi evereybody. I've been on FF for a while, but for some reason never noticed this thread. Looks like I've found some like-minded people. I've been using the 5ema (close) and 8 ema open on and off for a couple of months now and I like it. The last couple of months I've gotten indicator -happy and have been like a bar-fly flitting from this indi to the next. Noe that I've figured out what's what and what's not, I've decided to stick with the 5-8 cross-over. I put an alert on the crosses that has buy and sell arrows, audio and text messages, and email capacity. I also added the SEFC Bulls-Bears indicator which are simply verticle bars of 2 colors that confirm market direction. Below is one of my charts, Nice to have found this thread Good trading everyone.

Hi tradpat. I use a 5-8 close ema crossover alert that has buy and sell arrows. Some times there's a crossover with no arrow. When that happens I pass. I also use 2 indicators as filters. The Robby DSS, which is essentially a Stochastic shown in different color dots, with the EMA setat 8 and the Stochastc signal at 13. And the SEFC Bulls-Bears indicator to confirm market direction. After getting a crossover of the 5 & 8 EMAs I wait for an arrow and the same color signal from the 2 filters. No arrow, no entry. I wait for buy or sell candle to close above or below the cross and enter on the open of the next candle if it's going in the right direction. If not, I wait. I usually won't enter late, say after the 3rd candle, unless there's a pullback and then continues in the original direction. I pay attention to the slope of the 5 EMA and the space between the 2 EMAs. If any one of the indicators changes color or I get an opposite arrow, I get the hell out of Dodge. Experience has taught me that sticking around and hoping it's just a small pullback can be expensive. I pay particular attention to the DSS because that's usually the first to change colors and usually means that the direction will change soon. I trade the H4 TF, and sometimes the H1. Trading this way is correct about 70 % of the time. Sometimes these signals only give you acouple of bars, but that's life. I often use the arrow values for SL or the previous candle high or low. I don't set a TP. I let my signals tell me when to exit.

If you have any questions, PM me. I don't want to hijack Peter's thread even if it is 4 years old and sparsely frequented. I suppose we could keep the thread going by those that are interested. I just don't have the time to moderate a thread.

Good trading everybody. Cheers!

on your charts. The arrows and alerts are excellent to have if you don't want to stare at your monitor a long time waiting for a signal.

Here's what you want. Ideally, for a long you want the DSS starting to ascend and the dot color is the one you designate for a Long position. The Bulls-Bears signal is the same color. You have a 5-8 EMA crossover with a Long colored candle closing above the cross. And you must have a Buy arrow. No arrow, no entry. Just do the opposite for a short position.

If you get a all the signals-Losng DSS, Long Bulls-Bears signal, EMA crossover, Long candle closing above the cross, BUT, the DSS is above the 70 line. Do not enter. The PA may go long but usually not for long. Same with a short. If the DSS is below 30, and you take a short position, don't say I didn't warn you. If you wait for a good set-up, it'll usually be worth the wait.

I was asked whether the DSS repaints, and if it does, how do I deal with it? The DSS is basically a different form of a Stochastic. The Stochastic reflects what price is doing now. Just as the tip of a line Stochastic will change direction according to the PA, the DSS may repaint if the price changes enough before the time for that candle expires. I've only seen it do this once, though it may have happened more often and I just didn't notice it. As far as I know, all of the indicators that reflect current price repaint or change direction. That's their job. How do I deal with it? I don't. The color was correct when I entered. I continue the trade until I get an exit signal, which for me is all the colors have changed. If the signals are matching up, and the DSS is in the right area, I wait for the appropriate arrow. To be honest you don't even need the EMA lines if you use the arrows. I use them because I like to see the slope of the 5 EMA. Hope I answered eveyone's questions. Good trading everyone!

P.S.

Hi,

Does it work on any pairs? May I know if there is an optimal timeframe to use this strategy?

--- 帖子 #952 ---
"Does it work on any pairs?"

I haven't tried every pair of currencies available on the market, but IMHO, yes.

"May I know if there is an optimal timeframe to use this strategy?"

Not to my knowledge.

--- 帖子 #953 ---
have you tried this on smaller time frame

--- 帖子 #954 ---
Do you compare different timeframes before you take the trade with this strategy? I always have this problem when viewing on different timeframe. Sometimes 4hr is a trigger but 15 mins is showing reversal. How do you deal with this?

--- 帖子 #955 ---
It's the same as with any system - the lower the time frame, the more whipsaws there will be.

--- 帖子 #956 ---
Nope. Smaller time frames don't like me, and the feeling is mutual.

--- 帖子 #957 ---
1st of all, don't use TFs smaller than the one you're trading for trade confirmation. Keep that up and you'll need a whole team of shrinks to straighten you out. I trade the H4 and use the daily for directional confirmation. If the daily is trending, I want to take positions on the side of the longer term trend, not the shorter.

I don't look at smaller time frames for an entry on the larger one. I really don't care what the lower time frames look like. The information that you get is different. That M15 is showing reversal because the life of the price bar is shorter and the next one has to show something if the price went down. The H4 bar has a longer life so it only had to move up or down for 4 hours. Remember this. The current price is the same on all the TFs. If you have a Long signal on the H4, why do you care what the M15 is doing? Either trust your signal(s) and trade your plan,or don't. Keep  it simple.

Hello

I am quite new to trading forex and I have just found this thread. I have, up to now read the first eleven pages and think that this is the type of system I will like. Referring to PeterM saying that he trades the day charts, when is the start of the day? I live in England so would it be 8am when London opens?

--- 帖子 #960 ---
Thanks, peterM, for sharing this.

Just came across this method of yours now.  I have been using 5 SIMPLE MA and 8 EMA.   But your 5EMA/8EMA seems to be a bit "smoother."  Testing this out as I type.

Btw, I was wondering, is there a way to close a MANUALLY open trade using this EA by FireDave here - http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=233301?

Your new day is determined by your broker. It doesn't matter where you live. It's the time zone your broker uses. For example, I live in Japan, which only has one time zone, but my broker, Forex.com Japan, uses USA Eastern Standard Time for its scheduling. My trading week begins on Monday at 6 a.m. and ends on Saturday morning at 6 a.m. Right now it's 2:10 a.m. Saturday morning. (The Euro has 3 hours and 50 minutes to poop or get off the pot .) If you hold a position over into the next new day you will either be credited or charged a "swap"/rollover fee which is determined acccording to the interest rate of the central bank of the primary currency that you hold a position on plus the size of your position. Generally speaking, if you're buying the major currency pairs (those paired with the $US), you'll recieve the swap fee, and if you're selling you'll pay it. The USDCAD is the opposite - selling, you get, buying you give. The Japanese yen is the best payout for the carryover becauuse the official interest rate of the Japanese Central Bank is so low, (if you're Long) but right now the Yen (INMHO) is a dog. Some traders, who mainly trade multiple standard lots and hold postions long term (weeks or months), make a decent business out of collecting the carryover fees. Even if you're position is in the red, you can collect the difference in the interest rate between the two currencies.

Hi everybody

I was a follower of this thread, 3 or 4 years back and actually did some contributing to it also at the time, since then I have tried many many strats, used many many indicators and looked for simplicity itself in which to try and trade as successfully as is possible. I have blown up numerous accounts, lost a kings ransom, and the only reason why i am still here is because I am a stubborn bastard, and stubborn bastards dont like grey areas we like simple yes simple black and white, I am also a crime writer so I leave complicated plots to that and need a simple escape, (note the word simple again), Now human nature is a funny thing, some people believe that a system, a formula needs to have alot of indicators, be challenging, difficult, have some kind of magic rule only known to a few, passed down for centuries, a handful of lucky in the know funny handshake individuals able to break the code, to be one of the 5% who know how to make a living, earn some money, pay the bills and have a few quid left over for a few beers forex gurus. Might be true if you believe what you are told, advised, kept in the dark, What amazes me is that there are literally thousands upon thousands of retail traders, trading every day in every country on the planet and seemingly nobody can find a winning formula. Some people have been trading for years unsuccessfully, 5-7-10 years without success, it dosent take that long to become a brain surgeon so why should it take that long to determine the direction of a candlestick. I can only put it down to one thing.....YOU.

So lets break it down, go back to the drawing board, please dont slate me if I missed something, this is just my ranting ideas and my take on things:

1st/ Simplicity, Open a blank screen on Euro/Usd (could be any pair)

2nd/ I don't want to scalp, havn't the patience as you have probably gathered so lets make it a daily chart.

3rd/ Put 2 moving averages on the chart,  5 expo (close) and 8 expo (open)

4th/ Wait for them to cross, lets do an hyperthetical example, they crossed up yesterday at some point, so new candle opened at 12.01am last night which would be todays candle.

5th/ Lets be a little conservative and add a indicator, its ok I am not a witch please don't burn me, we will add the RSI (14) with a 50 median line and so there is our line in the sand if after the cross the price was above the line exactly the same as the cross of the MA'S, then damn it lets go long, yes i know there would probably be a retrace maybe back to the 5ema, maybe even cross back over, its called probability, so I have cited 2 reasons there not to take the trade, 3 if the RSI isnt above 50. There will always be reasons not to trade, its monday, its Friday, big news day, its a counter trend on a monthly chart, i walked under a ladder yesterday.

6th/ Stoploss, Oh! yes a biggie this, so lets make it simple, the high or low of the cross candle, simples

7th/ Take profit, God I hate this one, a recent survey was done asking all forex traders what the most difficult aspect was in trading and this came out top, so where do we take profits, you could ask 100 different traders and get probably a 100 different answers, Fibos, support and resistance trendlines, diagonal trendlines, yesterdays, last weeks, last months high or low, pivot points, 200, 60ema's, now one thing i hate is when somebody on the forum says look at your chart and draw in by hand trendlines support and resistance, train your eyes to see them, yeah right I wear glasses I can't even see when a bus is coming, now before I get slated i know the importance of support and resistance really i do, but you sit 10 traders down and ask them to draw S & R on a chart and I guarantee that you will have 10 different looking charts, so clever clogs Tom what do you do? Me I set a target if i get a cross on a daily chart and a RSI confirmation then I want at least 50 pips, this may seem a bit gung ho but ask yourself this, if you have waited for a cross and got it, and it hits a trendline that only Mr Smith in Australia could see then what was the point in the first place, comprendi. Of course if you do get your 50 pips, then you can trail your stop blah blah blah, sorry that is going into the realms of complicated again.

Well thats my take on things anyway lets recap, what I would do.

1/Open a chart, BLANK

2/ Make it a daily chart

3/ Add 2 EMA'S 5 expo (close) and 8 expo (open)

4/ Add indicator RSI (14) median line 50

5/ Wait for Ema's to cross, wait for close of candle for confirmation

6/ Example Ema's cross up and RSI above 50 Stick your trade on

7/ Stoploss set to low of crossed candle

8/ Take profit 50 pips or down to you as an individual

9/ Do the same again with another pair

Good luck

Now in all seriousness, I may have been a bit flippant there but it's simple, it really is, its not the holy grail, dosent exist honest, I know that people are going to be saying this is what I do, this is what I use, this is what indicator I use, I trade at this time, I walk the dog, I pick the kids up, but that is YOU, so I hope I havn't offended anyone and all replys would be greatly appreciated even if to just call me an arse.

respect to all

Tom

Decided to put my money where my mouth is today so did a trade, Maybe considered a counter trend considering the strong trend in recent days on Aus/Usd, but when looking at longer timeframes a counter trend can be anything from a 50 - 200 pips, over night the Aus had been edging down, I watched the cross over on a 4 hour time frame which was on my 8.00am UK time candle, i waited for the close which was at 12.00, the EMA's were nicely parted and the RSI was dipping below 50, got to have a more than reasonable chance of another leg down, I entered and closed with 30 pips profit, it seems to have hit some resistance around the 1.0436 level, what ever that may be. Now yesterday I wrote and ranted and rambled on about the daily timeframe and taking at least 50 pips profit, I would never advocate going any less than the 4 hr tf, unless you want to stress yourself into a early hole in the ground, Just to add I set my original stop loss at 1.0505, which was the high of the cross trigger candle, there does seem to be a bit of a Usd bullish day today why? I don't know but there is a cross forming on e/u, e/g, u/chf, u/c, NZ/U, all on 4 hr Tframes, might be worth a watch

good luck all

Hello Tom...

I think you summed it all up very well. I have been digging myself an early grave trying to trade the 5 and 15 minute charts the past year with all of the chart watching and stress. So I am going to try the 4 hour and daily charts from here on. Will try out this simple moving avreage cross thing. Thanks for the entertaining read. Good luck to you.

Hi Tony

many thanks for your mail, firstly good luck my friend for your trading, Me personally I think it is as simple as you make it, how you want it to be, I have read hundreds of threads, strats with many many indicators, so many you need a pilots licence to run some of them, on timescale anything less than 4 hrs now scares me, and trading is addicive enough with out putting yourself in the 20 trades a day club, I got a mortgage and kids, my god thats stressful enough, Of all the strats over the years I have read this one does seem to be easy and manageable, it tells you where to get in and where to get out, simples, my problem always use to be money management, I was stubborn if a trade went against me I would think f--k you I am not losing and watch it go hundreds against me in alot of cases, what a dickhead I was, but now, I get the cross, stick the trade on set my stop to cross/trigger candle and a 30 pip for 4 hr and 50 pip for daily take profit, its not perfect and not the holy grail but for my personality its great, keep posting how you are doing and I do hope it works for you.

respect

Hi Tom (Booktimes),

I liked your recent postings and have one question: now that you stick to the simple cross with your profit target set at 50/30 pips and Stop at the cross bar are you now consitently ahead of the game and making money ?

Cheers

Keith

A great believer in the KISS theory!

Hi Heith

many thanks for your mail, I have made 5 trades in the last couple of weeks and had 5 winners, could have had more but not been at comp all the time, yeah I know ,it's not as if 4 hrs and daily arnt big enough time scales, what do I want hey!

What I did was, (I use metatrader for a demo platform like everyone else) I cleared my charts completely of any indicators, made them blank, then just added what I talked about before, started from scratch, it felt good like cleansing ones soul, I use to wake at 6.30am, be sat at my comp by 7, and stay there all day, my wife would work all day, come home and go mad at me, "hey, what have you been doing all day?" but you try and convince someone you have been sitting at a comp all day trading, performed 25 trades, 12 losers and 13 winners and made a fiver profit all day, no to a non trading outsider it didnt add up, all I use to get was "why do it" So i woke up one day and decided not too, now I just look at the charts (if I am home, yeah I go out now) at 8am, 12, 4pm and glance at 8pm, yeah the 4hr timeframes. Now like I said b4, this is ME, to some other folks they may like sitting at their comps all day, kudos to them,

So in the last few days I have performed (yes performed, it is a pantomime) 5 trades, 5 winners for a total of 230 pips, now some may scream, is that all, but I didn't take every trade that crossed, through one reason or another, but I did it with confidence, set my stop and profit and said goodbye.

Respect

Tom

Hi Tom

Thanks for the update I will keep an eye on the 4 Hr & Daily Charts for the signal.

I read this thread over the weekend as I don't mind indicators even though they lag.  But I'm not doing well, I hope this is just another crazy week where any announcement by anybody in Europe sends the price in the opposite direction.  I'm using the arrows, SEFC Bulls-Bears and Robby . . .  I will just have to fine tune the entries better.

Morning guys

I have been doing a bit of demoing and live trading over the last week on this particular simple system, (Theres that word again) especially over the pairs, e/u, a/u and g/u, mainly because of low spreads and these seem to be the most popular pairs.

My simple no nonsence, take it how it is, don't answer me back else you will get a slap verdict was, that this system should be purely for a daily chart and above,

I dropped down a few times to the 4 hr charts and even entered a few trades, getting almost decimated, yes decimated I say on nearly all, admitedly the markets have been pretty choppy since the end of last year and what with the european debt problems, the forth coming U.S elections this year and Germany wanting to take over Europe (again) I feel a longer time frame is the only way, if we consider the 4 hr time frame, which to some people is long enough but compare it with the daily, it is only a 5th of a daily candle hence the whipsaw effect we are getting, whereas once the cross occurs on the daily time frame, it seems to create a trend or a change of trend for a few days at a time, look at the charts for the pairs I have mentioned.

So in my humble, not worth a jot, what does he know anyway opinion, I would say wait for a cross on the daily, before entering, Simples

respect

In my humble (worth 2¢) opinion one needs to drop down to lower time frames and be in serious capital preservation mode when markets are as uncertain as they are. 4hrs requires to large a stop for this mess we are trading these days.

--- 帖子 #979 ---
Guys, how is this method working in the current market conditions?

Any preference on what is the best timeframe?

Thanks

Rob

starting from daily is the best idea to me...

Guys, what do you think of these two:

EUR / CHF ma cross for a short entry

USD / CAD ma cross for a long entry

--- 帖子 #982 ---
Here is a neat little ma xover indie that looks tailor made for this approach..

If you want exponential ma's make the ma method 1 for both ma's.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Hi Tom. Very insightful posts. Thank You!

If you don't mind chatting and you are still enamored with the  5x8, then I would appreciated hearing about any new info you may have  discovered since your last post.

I've done days and months of back & forward testing on various methods. Some from FF, but mostly my ideas.

For instance; My most recent testing done on EU 4hr using a 4x61 ema. SL  55, TP 150. Stop to BE @ +50. Now I tried several variations of TP's,  SL's, BE's and no SL moving, and discovered that this iteration worked  best.

Results for the past 2 years showed an annual 20%+ return. 3 years back  (July 2009 thru June 2010) was basically BE at a 1% loss.

Other extensive testing I've done was on EU one hr using a 3x8 ema. SL  18, TP 43, BE goes to +3 when price has advance 15 pips from entry (not  to be confused with +15). I back tested this for about 8 months and it  normally averaged 8%+ monthly.

I began putting this on an EA. I'd fire it up the hour before London  Open, go to bed (US CST approx 1am) and let it run until 1500 London  time. A month ago it was golden, and then we got into this ranging stuff  and I got squashed by the MA braiding action. Apparently I need to  respect other input.

Hope I haven't put you to sleep with my ramblings. The whole reason for  this is for the sake of research.

Thanks,

Darryl

I am far from a professional trader but I have spent the last year or so backtesting methods, losing money on my micro account, and jumping ship from method to method. (I.E. scalping, swing, to position trading). I have learned a lot from my mistakes and I think I am on the right track to developing the proper habits to perform at a high level in the markets.the #1 thing that became apparent to me is that these mechanical type systems will work if you execute the rules with  cold-blooded consistency. It's not the system - it's the trader.

I have been backtesting a similar strategy to the 5/8 sma cross using different parameters to see what works best in different markets and it works very well - especially in trending/volatile market conditions. The concept has some definite potential. I think it's best to just pick parameters that suit your personality and risk appetite.

After reading through a good amount of the thread it seems to me the original method has been cluttered with indicators and other filtering methods that add unnecessary complexity to the system.

I recently took a couple classes on economic forecasting analysis before I graduated last June ( Class of 2012 Woot Woot! ) , and the one thing my professor stressed to us is your forecast will NEVER  100% accurately predict what's going to happen in the future no matter how much fundamental or technical data you have at your disposal. He also added there is no empirical evidence that shows that COMPLEX SYSTEMS achieve better results than SIMPLE SYSTEMS. That idea really resonated within my brain and made me realize that I needed to change my thought process in terms of trying to predict price movement.

--- 帖子 #985 ---
I love the idea of simplicity when it comes to the MA Crossover method because it's robust and takes the human emotion away from the decision making. In other words, the system can be quantified.

The OP has gone out of his way to make a blueprint via entry and exit. It's not like this method is new. It's been around for years and people have made millions from it. Ask Ed Seykota. He used EMA's. He even said that systems don't change, it's the fact that people hop from system to system and lack consistency because of their inability to stay emotionally disciplined. "Everyone gets what they want out of the markets" ... so he says. I think that was a reference to life in general as well.

Here's an idea....do a quick visual backtest. Notice how the big moves are captured with this method - even moreso if you increase the 8 day MA to an even larger time parameter (I.E. 25 days).

Another poster earlier pointed out that he made more profit when he just set his stop to BE and let his system determine his exit point. When it was in a strong trend or passed a technical barrier he would add to his position...think Reminiscences of a Stock Operator..."E.H. Harriman" . The poster stressed the idea that if he trailed his stop loss at each days previous high (assuming a short position) he would have been easily stopped out causing his profits to be cut short. I thought his points were insightful in how to avoid "leaving pips on the table".

In a nutshell, Jesse Livermore - one of the world's greatest speculators ever - said markets change but human behavior never changes. Jesse Livermore said he didn't play the game for tokens. After he realized his pitfalls in trying to trade the day to day fluctations of the markets he realized his mistake came to the conclusion that the big money was made in sizing up the overall trend with the market and trading with the line of least resistance. After reading various posts from aspiring traders throughout the whole forum  and analyzing my own weaknesses at the start of my journey it seems to me that the so called 95% of traders who are losing just lack the patience and discipline to hold on to their winners when they're right. It's our human nature to be greedy, fearful, and search for instant gratification. Human beings are always looking for easy money when it doesn't exist They become risk averse during times of profit and risk loving when they're hit with a clear loss (Allais Paradox). They micromanage their trades while in the market instead of sticking to a proven, statistically backed trading plan. Traders feel like they need to be in control in everything related to trade when in reality all the trader can do is manage his risk. As a result we are subject to psychological bias that negatively affect our trading (I.E. disposition, anchoring...etc ) and we end up overtrading, being overleveraged, and blowing out a significant portion of ouraccounts instead of managing risk and preserving capital.

There is a fine line between predicting price movement and anticipating based on probabilities. Anyone's effort to predict the market is futile. It can't be done with any consistency. The best we can do is find a robust system with a good expectancy and decent risk management parameters to captures the type of movements we are looking for in a method to execute over and over again. We need to become the casino instead of being the suckers playing slots.

I could give a sh*t if trading is "boring". I don't do it for the inevitable emotional thrill. Trading isn't supposed to be fun. I play the game to build wealth for the future and win. I love winning more than I hate losing. I'll take a string of losses as long as I come out on top with the trophy at the end. It doesn't matter to me. It's a business fellas.I'll have my fun when I'm traveling the world, meeting beautiful women, and the only time I even look at a trading terminal is when I check my positions to enter orders and move my stops.

--- 帖子 #986 ---
That's true, but it would be much more spectacular if the method offered a way to add to the winners.

--- 帖子 #987 ---
Hey Barbosa,

You're right. It would be fantastic if the method could tell you when to add to a winning position. Let me grab my crystal ball...

Lol...I don't mean to be cynical but I think you're asking the wrong questions. Pyramiding is tricky and it's something I've been thinking about for the last few weeks as well. Here are some thoughts that might help you out.

I think the key is to add positions through retracement setups, breaks of support/resistance, or when the market has a lot of momentum. I've been toying with the idea of adding positions every 100 pips up to a predetermined threshold (I.E. 3-5 additional pyramids). Ultimately, it's up to the trader to assess the current market conditions to determine if it's optimal to add to his position. Ed Seykota in his "Trading Tribe" website talks about optimal position sizing and pyramiding techniques and he says the most important thing is to have an optimal position size and stick to the system Micromanaging the positions too much generally leads to problems. Pyramiding is good and does maximize profit while limiting risk but it could lead to overtrading if not managed correctly.

Heres a link

http://www.seykota.com/tribe/risk/

Technically, the proper way to pyramid would be to decrease lots as you add positions in order to lower your risk as the trade goes in your favor but you can also use equal sized lots. Generally speaking, I intend to hold positions for the long haul of weeks to even months so it would be wise to pyramid and take advantage of trends as they go in my favor since they only occur about 15% of the time.

For instance, say I enter at 1.21 for E/U. I would set my stop at 2xATR - say - 200 pips with a 1 lot position size. When it goes to 1.22 I would add another lot and move my previous stop up 100 pips. I would keep adding positions until I hit my maximum line for that trade. In this case, if 1 lot= 1 unit then I could pyramid to a maximum of 4 units for that market. I got this idea from the risk management section of "way of the turtle" by curtis faith. He talks about the turtle method and how Richard dennis would make sure they weren't overleveraged in their positions just in case there was an adverse price shock in which they had no control (I.E. 1987 stock market crash where their positions tanked overnight and moved passed their stops) These are also called "fat tails" or EXTREMELY  low probability events that could decimate a traders account if not guarded against. From another perspective, if you do trade with the trend it mamizes your chances of capturing the price movement of price shocks and could allow for huge gains to your account.

I'm not trying to preach. Take my input with a grain of salt. I'm not a pro...yet. I wish everyone the best of luck in their trading endeavors.

--- 帖子 #988 ---
One more thing,

Barbosa....

try a simple money management solution when doing a manual backtest without adding positions. for instance, say you have a $100,000 account and trade 5% or say 2 lots per trade no matter what. Do a backtest of the last 5 years and see what your profit might have been while leaving a very wide trailing stop and only exiting when the MA's crossed. I think you'll be surprised at how well simplicity works. I sure was....

--- 帖子 #989 ---
I met Ed Seykota and spent some one-on-one time talking to him about trading. He is considered one of the greatest traders ever.

He told me a number of things that I'll never forget.

1. He said that day trading was akin to having a slot machine on your desk and you just end up feeding it all day long.

Plus he said that he had NEVER met a successful long term day trader.

2. He said that he did use moving averages BUT he would not tell me what they were. He told me to find the ones that worked best for me.

But more importantly what he did tell me was that his favorite thing was a certain pattern. He looked for "coils" as he referred to them. He said that coils are like a spring and that the tighter you wind a spring the more force they had when released. Therefore, one of his main tricks was to put on HUGE positions with VERY tight stops just on the other side of the coil.

He said: "I want to be right right now, or I want to be out immediately if I am wrong".

3. He did not add to his positions. He put on his whole trade at the beginning and "unwound" the trade along the way. He was not specific about "how" he did that.

* I also had a friend who was VERY close to him. This friend would tell me when Ed put on a trade. All I can say is that he was wrong a lot, but when he was right, he hit a grand slam (profit-wise).

--- 帖子 #990 ---
Thanks RB. You're very lucky. I'd love to meet him.

Very insightful. For some reason, I'm drawn to the zenlike aura of Ed Seykota. His interviews are always enlightening. It used to seem crazy to me that anyone would trade strictly with technical analysis but it makes a lot of sense to me now.

Anyways, coil patterns are interesting but I'm not too sure what these coil patterns would look like. I'm thinking the idea of a coiling pattern would represent some sort of indecision in price where it has to break out. Could it possibly be some triangle/pennant formations? Or maybe inside bars and outside bars? I'll have to think about it for a while.

In terms of "unwinding" his trades I think what he meant was he moved up his stops as the position went in his direction in order to lock in some profits. I remember him saying that he moves up his stops when the volatility gets crazy in one of his interviews.I don't think he actually scaled out of his trades because mathematically speaking, that would be inefficient. A scaling out strategy would ensure he would suffer his biggest losses when his position was the largest and he would ensure smaller gains when his position size is the smallest. Van Tharp has a section on taking profits and he writes a small excerpt about scaling out and its inefficiencies. He argues that its much better to take a profit in full and scaling out is for traders who need to be right about a position.

Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #991 ---
I would think about price turning up and down for a while in a tight range, like the loops of a coil.

Just a thought.

--- 帖子 #992 ---
Yes, coils are triangle/pennant formations.

I think his strategy of how to play coils was to place entries on both sides of the coil and whichever side got hit first became his entry and the opposite one became his stop.

I just happened to come across this thread, which is quite old but which interests me. Perhaps the fact that this thread seems to have died is indicative of the lack of consistent success in the following years since 2007.

The sample chart featured shows a 5/8 crossover right after a top was made, as if the trader had a "sure-fire" way to determine when and where that top occurs. I can become an instant millionaire, in theory, if I go back over historical charts and pick all the crossovers that happen after a top or bottom have formed. But, of course, the big question is how you determine where the extreme point is, from which you pick your crossover entry. Or do you just keep re-entering and getting stopped out, until finally the valid crossover occurs, which starts the new trend and results in lots of pips?

Is anyone able to comment on this question?

covel aka trendfollowing said he looked at his results in the decade of 90- 00 and he achieved nearly 60% annualized.

I have seen simulations of moving average crossovers that can attain that....but with more than 50% drawdowns....I believe ed views drawdowns very holistically....I once saw on his FAQ that he is tolerant of 50% drawdowns....I believe the coils are just retracements and he puts his market order just under support.

Speaking of Ed Seykota......

There is a good article about him in Traders Magazine Sept 2012 edition, it starts on page 53.

Traders Magazine is an online mag and free, but you do need to register.

Here is a link to the mag.... Hope you enjoy it.

--- 帖子 #998 ---
The reason I think this thread kinda died out is not from the fault of the method but due to the fact that most of the participants here at FF are looking more for instant gratification than actually becoming successful long term traders......

There are many successful systems but most will not and do not have what it takes to be traders, they jump from system to system in search of something that will never happen.... a system that never has a drawdown or multiple losses in a row.

The key to trading is Discipline, Consistency, and Risk Management...... You don't always have to be right but your wins have to be bigger than your losses.

system with a 40% win rate can be extremely profitable, but you have to be able to go through the losing periods.

A bit of additional trading knowledge helps. You don't need to rely solely on the crossover itself, as you can use it in conjunction with chart patterns for example. For instance, if you see a head and shoulders top you can just go short using the traditional criteria, and then use the 5/8 to help you decide when to exit. Not every trade sets up the same, and experience and discretion certainly do help to keep you from jumping on each and every cross. Knowing when to expect consolidation periods will help keep you from doing just that. You can even zoom in and use the 5/8 on lower time frames. Say you're using the weekly chart to position trade and it starts to consolidate within a range. Then you can drill down to the daily and capture smaller moves, and if/when the daily tightens up you can go to the 4 hour. And if that tightens up then just sit out and wait until a trend develops. I've noticed that pullbacks into the 5/8 can be great entries during a trend. Use a MTF moving average so you can see the weekly or daily MA's on the daily or 4 hour charts, respectively, and use whatever other types of indicators you like to use to help you enter. Heiken Ashi bars, stochastics, MACD, etc.

Peter mentions in the first post that for T/P he trails "usually by 50 pips on nzd/jpy, 100 on GBP/JPY and 50 on GBP".

I follow an MA crossover method on D1 but find that even trailing by 1.5 ATR gets me stopped out more often than not.

I have an initial S/L of 1 ATR and move to BE at 1.5 ATR but am thinking of upping it to 2ATR.

HIi Guys.

I am great fan of MA Crossover strategies and using it on Daily TF with SL set to ATR 2.5 60mins.Still testing and will post here.

--- 帖子 #1014 ---
Waheed what do you mean by Stop Loss set to ATR 2.5

--- 帖子 #1015 ---
Put the ATR indicator on a 60 minute chart. Whatever the value is, take that # times 2.5 and use that as your stop-loss.

--- 帖子 #1016 ---
6.5 hrs ago 7am (cdt/us) I put a Buy Stop on the eur/gbp, 4H TF. BS hit @ .8524; SL=8465;TP= .8589. Progress has been slow, hey, it's Monday, but up 4 pips right now. I only look at the 1H TF if I can't find a 4H setup at 7am. There isn't much interest in this thread but I have found if I wait for the candle close to confirm a cross and that cross is at 2 or 4 o'clock, or better, and the RSI is above 55 or below 45 and at a good angle, it is going to be a good trade.

more info: I wanted price to clear prev. minor resis. @ .8521 by 2-3 pips, which it did.

--- 帖子 #1017 ---
I partially closed @ .8558 & then moved my SL to .8531 (BE+7) which was hit later which added  a tad over1% to my acct. I'm a happy camper this morning.

--- 帖子 #1018 ---
Nice

--- 帖子 #1019 ---
I'm also a big beliver that the simpler a system is, usually the more profitable it is too. I think the main problem every trader has though is, how do you avoid a ranging market? I feel i may have found a simple solution to this by using additional indicators.

1) First i make sure price is above the 5 and 8 MA on both H4 and D1 charts

2) I then make sure Stoch, CCI, RSI and MACD are all up on H4, then i make my entry on an H4 chart.

I think the benefit of using 5 and 8 ma's are that they don't lag as much as higher ones.

--- 帖子 #1020 ---
The problem I think if you add more and more indicators you are going to get to point where you will rather not pull the trigger which I think is wrong.

Stoch, CCI, RSI and MACD is at the end of the day just telling you actually the same thing but if it works for you by all means use it. But get something that works for YOU.

I rather use money management to keep my losses small and not over 1R (and also not betting the house on every trade) in ranging periods and I then know my winners will make up for them especially if you just let simple 5/8 run until it says get out.

--- 帖子 #1021 ---
You're right and i agree, it's what works for you as a trader. I have tried to follow various systems from people in the past, but failed to turn over profits, mainly because it wasn't my system to begin with and it's difficult to put someone elses plans into action.

--- 帖子 #1022 ---
My success with this strategy, using mainly the 4H at 7am cdt/us, is looking for a strong cross ie. the ma's pointing at "2" or higher or "4" or lower (clock dial.) I also use rsi with levels of 45 & 55 and yes, I have taken trades where I could see the rsi was above or below the 50 but not yet touching the 45 or 55.

I also have a 100 & 200 ema on the chart just to denote trend; I may peak at the D TF for verification of trend but usually just the 2 emas on the 4H.  I stay away from flat type crosses or where there is no separation or if the 5&10 are "tangled." I don't like little candles or great big ones either. The beauty of this simple strategy is 15 minutes: I look at the calendar to see what happened during the Asian and London plus what is coming up and then it's to the 8 prs I trade during the NY session. If I don't see a good possibility at 7 am I may look at the hourly at 8 am. Then I go about having a life away from the computer.

Hi Guys.

do you have any dashboard for two moving average crossover?

I guess I don't understand; wht would the benefit be?

--- 帖子 #1025 ---
Hi Piprac,

I trade 30 plus pair and in daily chart..Instead of looking at each pair one by one.We can first just look at the dashboard which is having valid cross over.Then we can go to respective chart and decide on the trade.

--- 帖子 #1026 ---
Now I get it. I only trade 8 prs on the 4H so I may look at the D & 1H for trend indications or just see a likely setup on the 4H and pull the trigger. Wow, 30 pr - at least you can probably find one good trade, yesterday I didn't see one so no trades at all.

--- 帖子 #1027 ---
What I have is a 5/8 (or you can actually set the ema's to what you want) crossover indicator that sends a alarm so then I can quickly check those first.

Bedayan - a very interesting dashboard but how does one interpret a pair where on a particular TF, say the 1H, it has 2 red and 1 green arrow. And sometime the order of the colors vary, a green in the middle or a green to the far left or far right. Reminds me of the old saying, the devil is in the details. Thanks for posting, it sure would help for anyone following more than a half dozen pairs. piprac

In what TF are you using 5/12 ema crossover?

--- 帖子 #1036 ---
Personally I use 13 and 21 EMAs (Fib Numbers) look for the break and then wait for the pull back before entering with the trend. Look for the break of inside bars to get into a trade with the trend. Set a SL below/above the setup candle and look to exit at the nearest S/R level make sure you have at least 1:1 RR.

it's as easy or as hard as you want to make it!!

--- 帖子 #1037 ---
Nice one. I am using 5/15 and on lower tf 5/21.

Same principles that have been around for years.

Buy the dips, sell the rallies.

Works 100% ???, no, never.

But with the proper mm and trade management, RR up to 4:1 or more is attainable for each cross.

And yea, of course when it goes into a range, it will kill you. So, try to enter only when the cross leaves some "space" between the MA. Other than that screen time would also give you clues.

Looking at the two charts which one would you rather be trading?

Without waiting for a pull back in the trend you don't know which type of market you are going to be trading.

--- 帖子 #1039 ---
Steve

Can you maybe please elaborate on your quote for setting your Stop Loss above or below the setup candle.

If I look at your first posted chart with the 2 trades, on the first trade after you have entered you do get a lower candle. Would this not have taken out a SL?

I am trading a similar 5/8 EMA system but would like to get the SL placement more optimized as I think mine is very wide (100-300pips on a 4H/Daily timeframe) and RR could be suffering because of this.

--- 帖子 #1040 ---
I have found that on Higher TF especially the daily, SL at the OPEN of the signal candle works good. It gets taken out at times but I am usually trailing my stops behind closed candles or SR levels. Hitting 1:1 using this method works and when you catch a trend..the RR could be great. Then again if your signal candle is too large, you may decide to not take it of put a pending order for a retrace.

There is no guaranteed solution to this. Just use the methid that makes the most sense to your risks appetite.

--- 帖子 #1041 ---
Thank you 45drive45 for your explanation, appreciated.

--- 帖子 #1042 ---
Hi Krypty,

As I was trading inside bars I was looking at the Mother Bar as the setup bar so set my SL above/below this bar. I would not use any more than a 100 pip SL on the H4 TF and then only if the R:R would allow for such a large SL.

I like to have the Daily TF in agreement with the H4 also before taking a trade.

I am using Freebie Candles for my trading because they allow me to read PA but also give the same signals as Heiken Ashi candles so for me it's the best of both worlds.

I'm also using the HG 0001a indicator which i got from here Post# 81, it relates to the SuperTrend and BB MACD Indicators which I was using on anther thread to try and create a mechanical trading system. It works much better, for me, when I use it in conjunction with the 13 and 21 EMAs and I wait for a pull back in the trend rather than jumping straight into a trade.

--- 帖子 #1051 ---
Nice Steve, I am also in this trade but with a StopLoss of about 200 but must also say I will ride it until the cross of the 5/8 on the daily or ATR based stop on the 4H.

--- 帖子 #1052 ---
Hi Krypty,

Personally I'd look for the cross on the daily and then watch the H4 for the first pull back to the MAs to try and reduce my SL.

Could you post a chart showing your entry please.

--- 帖子 #1053 ---
The GBP/USD D1 and H4 charts shows my thought process when looking for trade setups.

I work full time and so this is the best way for me to trade I use an EA for trade management and once I enter a trade I usually let it do it's thing. I move to BE +3 pips once my profit is equal to my SL and then let it either run to my TP or take me out for +3 pips.

I usually find it's better for me NOT to be around to interfere with the trade because once you start to do that then it's something you have to factor into your trading plan. If you start to interfere with a trade, once you have placed it, you need to keep detailed records of how this interference plays out in the long term if you don't how do you know if your helping your trading or hindering it? I know personally I'm better off just letting it run but you have to have your SL TP and where or when you are going to move to BE.

--- 帖子 #1054 ---
Steve here is the screenshot where  I entered.

My thinking behind this trade is the following:

- Cross on the Daily (5/8 cross on my side)

- Entered on 4hour chart after pullback and then entered at the red arrow.

- SL is based on Daily ATR calculation

- TP = I do not have a TP and will only exit when I get break of the ATR.

--- 帖子 #1055 ---
Hi Krypty,

Thanks for taking the time to post a chart, looks like you entered short just before me.

I thought you where entering immediately after the cross of the 5 and 8 EMAs. It's always better to wait for the pull back and then enter in the direction of the trend when you have the PA for confirmation. Entering a trade based  solely on the cross of an EMA is not a good idea; it's great if the market continues but more often not you will get a pull back.

Good luck with the trade, I've been stopped out on mine for (-1%) of my account.

I have cancelled this trade, that is the advantage of using pending orders.

--- 帖子 #1058 ---
Actually pending order is a very good way to avoid loss and whipsaws in most systems even more so in MA based systems

I think the problem for some is that they see all the missed trades or later entries in strong trends and decide not to use them. But when there is cross upon crosses, pendings usually helps you avoid those trades.

The template that you posted is a standard MT4 ADX template (at least thats what it looks like after I downloaded the template and opened it). It is not the template I see in your posts (gold background, filled MAs, etc.).

???

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1072 ---
Hi MidnightRun,

The templates I save on my platform don't show up when I look in the "Program Files" "MyTradingPlatform" "Templates" on my computer; I saved the template I created to the ADX Template on my platform, which does show up in my "Program Files" "MyTradingPlatform" "Templates", the ADX Template on my platform now opens the template I created. I assumed that by uploading the TDX template it would be my template that got uploaded and not the standard TDX Template.

Is anyone else having the same problem and if so does anyone know how to correct it.

--- 帖子 #1073 ---
Yes, same problem here.

When you save the template, give it a name then before you save it, click on the "Desktop" icon on the left side of the screen. Now it will be saved on your desktop with an icon so can be found easily without having to look in different folders.

The "ADX" template you tried to save over is an original template that comes with MT4 platform so cannot be deleted or changed. If you created a different template or loaded a different template then you can change or delete those.

Hi Steve

You are buying at the top of the move resistance level....

Not a high probability trade.I would of waited for retrace then go long again at better number.Sometimes one should ignore "systems" indicators and simply look at the chart.

--- 帖子 #1078 ---
SL hit (-1%) of my account.

Davit has a point some times you should just look at the chart. I took a chance with the resistance above and it didn't pay off there is always going to be some degree of resistance or support when entering a trade after a pull back in the trend.

I'm trying to make my approach to trading as simple as possible, as I said in one of my first posts on this thread it depends how complicated you want you want to make it.

Looking at things a little deeper there could be a good setup materialsing on EUR/USD it's a matter of waiting and seeing where it wants to go

--- 帖子 #1079 ---
Did anyone consider this setup on USD/CHF H4??

Has anyone tested this 5/8 strategy on GBPJPY daily chart? The target is 100 pip but where could be the SL? Has anyone some experience about SL of 5/8 MA?

--- 帖子 #1082 ---
I think I really like this system... seams relatively simple and indicator free. I've started back testing on the EURUSD daily charts with 8 ema (open) and 5 ema (close) and it seems very profitable for the crossovers just this year. Has anyone else back tested this (and on other pairs), and does anyone know the win rate on this system ?

I would love to hone in on a complete strategy using this crossover, to include stop loss, trailing stop distance, and take profit.

I'd love to hear from others using this system, how they  are implementing it, and what kind of success rates they are achieving.

--- 帖子 #1083 ---
I am responding to your post on the 5ema/8ema crossover. I have been trying to use crossovers for a long time, and even had a programmer write me a crossover indicator that alerts visually with arrows and by sound when the crossover actually happens (on the close of the candle). However, I have found it very difficult to consistently use this method, despite variations of the intervals, or in conjunction with MACD and Stochastic readings. I keep getting stopped out too frequently, and if I move the stop-loss out further, the loss becomes even greater. Whatever ideas you have would be welcome. Better yet, if you want to communicate by email we could explore this method in great detail without tying up the thread at this website. Let me know.

Peter

--- 帖子 #1084 ---
Hello everybody,

looks like a very promising system- simple and great! I am wondering whether the original

creator is still using it in the same way and whether it is still that profitable?

Thanks,

Nasko

--- 帖子 #1085 ---
It works better on the Daily charts and also with the 20, 50, 100 and 200 EMA's to give you the stronger sense of direction. Only take bullish signals if the longer term EMA's are bullish or rising, and the opposite when longer period EMA's are bearish or declining.

If longer term EMA's are all entangled and not in an obvious trend, this is a range and which means to stay away from the pair and trade another one where there is an obvious trend.

--- 帖子 #1086 ---
so now we have 5EMA / 8EMA and 20,50,100, 200EMA

I have read this thread and began to trade it in mt4 demo. It seems to work well.

Peter says he is using ema5 close and ema8 close, other people is using ema8 open. Which do you think is most successfull?

Ema8 open gives sooner trades, but more whipsaw i think.

About sideways markets i think rsi and so on is too slow to be confident in ema5 8 trade, i want and indicator which can handle sideways markets.

Trading daily charts.

Appreciate suggestions..

--- 帖子 #1096 ---
Witch tf is the best for this strategie ?

--- 帖子 #1097 ---
I use an ema 5/ 12 crossover alert. The indicator allows you to choose ma types and periods and gives a sound alert and can be set up to send a notification to your cell. I use it on the 4H and only look at the 4H and daily charts. Although I sometimes use the 1H for entry/exit. I have learned that the lower time frames and even the 1H have too much whip saw. With the cell alerts you don't have to babyset charts or be near your computer all the time. It prevents you from missing crossovers. I am in the US and the cell alerts wake me up if needed so I don't miss big moves during the London open.

I only take trades in direction of overall trend. I wait for pullbacks/correction and then wait for the crossover alert to notify me of trend continuation if and when it resumes. The only problem with the indicator is that is only works if MT4 is running on your computer and every time you change tf  or load MT4 it sends new alerts to your phone. I did find a website, alertfx.com, where you can get a free account to send email and cell alerts for various indicators and it is always running.    Here is the indicator I use. I did not create it, I found it to download for free.

--- 帖子 #1098 ---
After suffering countless of large losses, it seems that I have finally turned the corner with the 5/8/20/50 SMA crossover technique, along with confirmation of the MACD and modified Stochastic, courtesy of Dr. Barry Burns. In short, here is what seems to work rather well, for now. I trade the M5 chart because I do not want to get caught in a long term trade when Yellen, Draghi, Obama, et al sneeze and send the markets into a tizzy. My defaults are: ticket size 40,000 units, T/P = 25 pips, S/L - 200 pips and using the MA50 as the trend designator. When MA50 angles down, I wait for a pullback to go short. As soon as I get the MAs to orient as 5<8<20 I take a short position and take my 25 pips of profit with gladness. That is usually the distance the price will move before hitting S/R. By entering as many as 7 positions in different but qualifying currency pairs, and in three trading accounts (two or three per account) I may end up the trading session with several profitable trades that add up to several hundred dollars, without getting stuck over weekends and longer, dangerous times. As long as I have interpreted the trend correctly, over M5, M15, M30, H1, the trades almost always work out, even when they temporarily go against me. If I violate my rules or misinterpret, I lose. For a long position I use the reverse of the above. If any of you try the method, please let me know your results. Thanks.​

Continuing the discussion on 5/8 SMA crossover, it has been the most reliable and consistent profit maker for me, in the context of my total methodology. When the correct orientation of these SMAs exists (in M5, M15, M30) a trade with this trend is almost always a winning position. Since I monitor 23 currency pairs on 4 laptops with auxiliary monitors on each, (4 monitor screens of 6 pairs each), I can select 5 or 6 concurrent trades that are "ripe" and distribute them over 3 live accounts. Diversity ensures that some of these positions are taking profit, when other pairs may be meandering to nowhere at the moment. Since trades were entered on trend agreement in several

fractals, eventually even the slow movers will go to profit or will be closed at small losses. In short, I do not seek the 80 pip run, although I sometimes get it. Rather, I prefer the 25 pip target on several currency pairs, with re-entry, if appropriate, at a pullback. At the end of the day I may have accumulated 80 pips in total, but over several trades.

. I hope that the "brick wall" has courteously responded to your comment.

--- 帖子 #1101 ---
I'm glad that somebody is continuing this thread and actually using the strategy. I'm also trying this method, but unfortunately for me, I don't follow it religiously. And then lose. Maybe i have too many screens open and getting confused. I also keep switching between M5,H1 and M1, M5 timeframes. I also use rsi as confirmation. Anywhere, please keep posting your progress i found t very educational.

--- 帖子 #1102 ---
Hello Everyone,

I am thinking of trying this on the side and was wondering if a 200 smoothed MA would be better for the trend on the 4H and 1D? I noticed that when I put a 200 SMA the MAs cancel out each other a lot (resulting a no trades or very little trades).

Also do you guys wait for the candle to close after the cross and trade on the next candle? Example: candle 2 back 8>5, candle 1 back 5>8, candle 0 back open trade?

Would like to hear your opinions on this.

--- 帖子 #1103 ---
​If you are referring to my post on 5/8 crossover entries, may I say that the MA200 is simply the very long term trend and that is all that I use it for. In fact, you can eliminate it completely and use the MA50 as your long term trend and have all the information that you need. Regarding candle sticks, I pay limited attention to these, except as they might signify a top or a bottom, or if they are very large in a large move, signifying exhaustion. M5 is the time frame in which I trade, for the reasons already mentioned previously. What I look for is trend agreement between M5, M15, M30 and M50 and when I see this, I know that the probability of continuation is in my favor, assuming that there are no obvious S/R levels ahead. There must be at least 30 pips of clear movement ahead for an entry. The S/R level ahead becomes the target T/P. Once you are into a trade because of the mentioned orientation of the 5/8/20/50 MAs, there is no reason to be bouncing back and forth among the fractals. Walk away from the computer and let the trend do its thing. Check back occasionally in case market conditions have changed. Do keep it simple and stick to the rules. Like anyone else, I win if I stick to the rules and lose if I don't.

--- 帖子 #1104 ---
Just curious. Do you trade full time? And, do you trade only 5/8crossover system? Thanks

--- 帖子 #1105 ---
I ever used other MA crossover indicators to trade (5/20/50+RSI, not 5/8 as in this thread), but most of the time I had a bad luck.

The indicators are always repainted when the market has changed the direction and seems MA is not leading indicator. Rather, lagging indicator.

However, I will try to use this 5/8 crossover.

--- 帖子 #1106 ---
yes, Jupiter, I trade full time, and  mostly 5/8 crossovers because (if monitored correctly) that is when the price has pivoted and is resuming trend direction. But other elements  enter the decision making process, not just 5/8 crossovers. I would not short at the bottom of a consolidation channel, simply on a 5/8 crossover, but probably would if it happened at the top of the channel. Remember that the MA50 is my trend line in M5, M15, M30 and H1. If all these time charts agree on the direction of MA50, then I will switch to M5 and look for a pullback and a subsequent crossover.

--- 帖子 #1107 ---
Thanks for your reply. I have few more questions if you don't mind. I've noticed that you're using simple moving averages.

Have you experimented with exponential MA too?

Have you tested the 3/8 crossover instead of 5/8 one?

When you are trying to establish the consolidation channel, what is the time frame that you're looking at?

You've mentioned that your SL is set at 200pips(older post), isn't that a bit too much compared to the profit you take of 25pips? Or do you adjust the SL based on a particular situation?

I found it very difficult to stick with the system and not to overtrade. It's very tempting to enter in anticipation of the cross, because my stop loss would be smaller. How did you managed to stick to the rules?

Thanks in advance for sharing your experience with us.

Regards,

Dimitri

Hi Jupiter13

In answer to your question, yes, I have tried various short term MA combinations such as 3/5 and others and, yes, I have also debated the question of SMA versus EMA. Neither of these topics define the trading system, and are of no significant consequence, so take your pick but remain consistent. Remember that the short MA crossover (whether 3/5 or 5/8) defines the current action of price, whereas the 20/50 MA define the longer term trend within the time frame that you are trading. In my case the trading time frame is M5, whether I am looking for a channel breakout or just a pullback against the trend. Why? because in today's market conditions too many things can and do happen and quite quickly, which can derail the best analysis and projections. I want in and out as quickly as possible with several trades that fulfill my parameters.

In order to enter a trade I must find a pair that is trading in a prolonged and clearly identifiable trend. Up or down. M50 is my long term trend indicator. So a trend is identifiable if MA50 is sloping in the same direction in H1, H4, M30, M15. When I find this condition I will switch to M5 and wait for a pullback, which is defined as the price pulling back to MA20 or more. When this happens I need a trigger signal to enter, and that signal is the 5/8 crossover in the direction of the trend. Prior to entering any trade I need to consult the calendar to ensure that some upcoming news event will not disturb the long term trend with undesirable gyrations. My trading method is a distillation of many people's point of view, from paid trading seminars, from videos on YouTube, from trials and errors, and wins and losses. While it is really quite simple, there are still many other nuances that you must be sensitive to, and that "feel" for the market will only come with experience. Even the most famous and expensive gurus cannot give you a "turnkey" system that will make you rich because trading is largely a complex emotional activity. You must develop your own, after considering the knowledge, experience, and suggestions of others. But you must analyze everything through your own logic.

Why do I want agreement in the MA50 slope in several time frames? Because if I enter wrong or the price goes against me, I am still in the direction of the long term trend and will simply wait it out for a few more hours or days. Eventually I will be vindicated.

I try to avoid trading consolidation channels because they are unpredictable.

What about S/L? You are correct about the upside down P/L ratio of a 200 pip S/L, but I have lost money more frequently on triggered S/Ls than any other market phenomenon. In fact, if my entry has been according to my rules, I often remove the S/L completely. I am not recommending this to you, because I admit being an unorthodox and non conventional trader in many ways. But once the price has moved a profitable distance from my entry point (also considering broker spread widening) I will put a S/L at the entry level to preclude a loss. Price should not be allowed to retrace the entry point. As for overtrading, we are all guilty of this. That is why I have apportioned my capital over 3 accounts, determined a default order size and T/P amount. This allows me no more than 3 trades per account at the most. The rest is a matter of re-reading your trading rules before beginning a trading session, and keeping a weekly log of all your trades with comments as to why you entered and what the results were. I hope that this helps, but realize that there is still much to go before you feel confident in your trading. I fully empathize, being just like you.

Hi Stelpm,

Thank you so much for the great answer to my questions. It's a really thorough explanation of your trading methodology.

I have few more questions though if you don't mind:

As you identify the trend "MA50 is sloping in the same direction in H1, H4, M30, M15", do the time frames MA's have to be in particular order? For example,does M15 has to be below M30,H1 and H4(for a short trade)?

What is your rough average holding time per position(i understand that will vary)?

How crucial role MACD and modified Stockastic play in your decision making before you enter?

Have you tried to automate your system? I personally tried to automate some of my ideas and they worked great when i backtested them, but in real trading it was a disaster.

I've noticed that you're from USA. Do you trade only USA markets day hours?

How often your 200pips SL gets hit? Funnily, when i was trading a strategy without predetermined SL i was more successful.

I will really appreciate it if you can include two or three print screen examples of your entries.

Thank you again in advance for your time and effort to share your profound insights as to your trading methodology.

Regards,

Dimitri

PS I also have noticed that you've subscribed only to this tread. You must be very focused on what you do. Great idea. Less distractions. I think i might try this too.

Hi Dmitri, Here is my reply to your recent questions.

Hi Stelpm,

Thank you so much for the great answer to my questions. It's a really thorough explanation of your trading methodology.

I have few more questions though if you don't mind:

As you identify the trend "MA50 is sloping in the same direction in H1, H4, M30, M15", do the time frames MA's have to be in particular order? For example,does M15 has to be below M30,H1 and H4(for a short trade)?---Yes, the MAs do have to have correct orientation which for bearish trend is MA5<MA8<MA20<MA50 and the reverse for bullish trend.

What is your rough average holding time per position(i understand that will vary)?—It varies according to the way that the market treats me, and whether I have entered correctly or not. The most desirable condition is one where the volatility is good and I can exit a trade within a few minutes or a few hours with my default profit of 25 pips. Otherwise, and if I have entered correctly, I will hold as long as necessary, but if I realize that price is in a channel and I can get out with slight profit or minimal loss I take it, just to free up my margin to use it elsewhere.

How crucial role MACD and modified Stockastic play in your decision making before you enter? ----This is a bit trickier, and the reason that I said that the 5/8 crossover is not the entire system. When the crossover occurs, and the MACD is heading in the direction of the trend, I look for agreement from the Stochastic. To get the entire picture, which is quite elaborate, you might go to www.tradingwithprecision.com and www.topdogtrading.com and get much more information than I can post here. When you have digested that, I can discuss it further with you. You don’t need a paid subscription to get the essentials from these websites.

Have you tried to automate your system? I personally tried to automate some of my ideas and they worked great when i backtested them, but in real trading it was a disaster. ----I do not believe in automated systems. They are the excuse that traders seek when they want to assign the responsibility of their actions to a supposedly higher authority. If I want to trade, I need to become a trader and learn the art of trading, just as one does with any other profession. Glean the best information that you can from everywhere, incorporate it logically if and where it fits, develop your own methodology and then let no one dazzle you with his “allegedly” higher knowledge. That is what my method is all about for me. In summary, my method strives to box me in to a very narrow and precise set of rules which prevent me from making the same mistakes over and over. When adhered to, it rewards me. When I go looking for someone else’s fancy tricks I lose.

I've noticed that you're from USA. Do you trade only USA markets day hours?----I have noticed that some of the best runs happen around midnight Pacific Time, which is my time. Obviously I can’t be awake all the time so I often go to bed by 8:00 and get up around 4:00 A.M. and trade till about 11:00 A.M. After that the market seems to quiet down. Also, I do not usually trade when the market opens on Sunday evening because that seems to be the time for many false moves with reversals.

How often your 200pips SL gets hit? Funnily, when i was trading a strategy without predetermined SL i was more successful. ----As I have stated recently, I seem to have lost more consistently from S/Ls than from any other causes, so I have taken off the default S/L completely. If I have determined and obeyed the trend requirements correctly, I ought to be fairly safe. When I am in profit, I will place a S/L around my entry price. If I have entered entirely counter trend and price is clearly going against me I will take my loss and get out. Of course, major moves such as the Swiss decoupling from the Euro will catch us all by surprise, and we may have to carry a losing position for months, while we try to whittle it down with other profitable trades as we go along, and that is the risk that I take.

I will really appreciate it if you can include two or three print screen examples of your entries. ----I have not been trading during the last two weeks of the year and will start again tomorrow. Will send you some screen shots as I have them, but also a copy of my daily trading record on which I monitor myself as I trade.

Thank you again in advance for your time and effort to share your profound insights as to your trading methodology.----I wish you success (not luck, which is an imaginary thing), as you steadily improve your self-control.

Hi Peter,

Thanks again for your thorough explanation of your strategy. I have to sit down and re-read your posts a few times to properly digest the information you have given us. It's a simple system but as you said "there are still many other nuances that you must be sensitive to".

Also, i will check those two links that you've suggested.

Speak to you soon.

This morning I was blessed with profits totaling $313 on two short trades executed between 4:00 A.M. and 8:00 A.M. That is a very nice start on the New Year, and I will post my activity record form in a few minutes, in case some of you find it worth using. Last week I lost $638 on a 200 pip S/L that I forgot to de-activate, on the AUDSGD, which then turned around and dropped below my entry price. In other words, I would have made a gain, had I not had a S/L in place. This is why I am convinced that trades can be made without S/L, if they are entered correctly according to the MA orientation rules which define the trend. I have eliminated the default S/L. When I post this morning's activity you will see why I take a default T/P of 25 pips. My NZDCAD trade moved to my T/P and then reversed, and will probably give me another entry opportunity. So rather than allow my trade to vacillate between gain and loss, I take the small increments and get back in, if appropriate.

--- 帖子 #1115 ---
Unfortunately the system does not allow me to post my activity form in Word or in Paint. But while I am on this post I notice that NZDCAD has pulled back beyond the MA20 in an established down trend so I am re-entering for 25 pips, no S/L. Let's see what happens.

--- 帖子 #1116 ---
Well done.  I've also made a small profit on the DAX.  Exited too early as I always do.  You can print the Word document as a PDF and post it.  I use a free PDF converter called CuePDF.

Hi Stelpm,

Could you upload the indicators or template please. I would like to begin to look at this. Thank you and much appreciated. Or maybe I missed where they already are please let me know.

Thanks!!

--- 帖子 #1120 ---
Here are the instructions for the CutePDF. Just in case you need it in the future.

Thanks for your trading journal template.

​I have not uploaded my custom indicators, only the details of how such a system works. Someone else is sharing such an indicator and someone is having one coded for free. I have no plan to upload the actual tool because I am then obligated to follow through indefinitely on it use, as well as get negative remarks from those who cannot make it work. I am glad to exchange knowledge and experiences but not the actual indicators.

--- 帖子 #1122 ---
Nice Thread, Keep it original and keep trading.

--- 帖子 #1123 ---
Hi,

By following the thread "trend catching with NonLagDot indicator" it seems to that the NonLagDot indicator can replace the two moving averages 5 and 8.

It's more readable.

--- 帖子 #1124 ---
If "non lag dot" works best for you, clearly that is what you should use. It looks like a blend of an MA with the SAR indicator, an experimental search for something new.

When I discussed 5/8, I made it clear that it was a feature of a system, not the system itself. There are other factors that need to be considered. For me, the method that incorporates the 5/8 as well as MA50 and MA200, along with stochastic  and MACD confirmation is working well and I think that I will stick to it. After all, it produces a lot of positive pips and, once in a long while, a few negative ones due to non observation of the ground rules. But since I use no S/Ls, the negative pips are my choice to close a trade that seems bad.

--- 帖子 #1125 ---
Interesting. Thank You.  Also can you or anyone else please tell me what setting to use for the 5 / 8 Moving AVGS I:E  Set to Close     Open   High   LOW.

--- 帖子 #1126 ---
fxdare,

I used to think that it makes a lot of difference if you use "ema versus sma", "open versus close", and such. It does not! I have realized that success comes from accurately identifying the trend that the market movers have established, in the moment, and then trading with them. Those market movers are the big banks, the hedge funds, insurance companies, governments, the super rich like Soros, Buffet, Icahn, the Koch  brothers and such. If you can identify the trend and go with it, you will make money in spite of yourself, just like a river will pull you downstream no matter what way you thrash in the water. But identifying the trend correctly and getting in at the right time is what most of us spend years trying to discover.  Along the way you will be distracted by a lot of self appointed gurus and experts who believe that they have found the perfect system that they will gladly sell to you for a few hundred or thousand dollars. After you have followed a few of those pied pipers and have lost a lot of money, you may finally understand how the market works and start to make some small profits, at first, and greater ones if you stick with it.  So keep studying the charts and noticing repeating patterns. Then take advantage of those patterns with small orders, correcting your mistakes along the way. Don't flip flop among different methods that different people will dangle before you. Think it out logically.

--- 帖子 #1127 ---
I Agree with you, However I have been following this thread for a short time and decided to investigate the integrity of this system and the claims being made here. I implemented the indicators provided and used a 8 / 21 MA cross. So far my trading log is showing a significant improvement on my personal P&L. Now i would like to try this system on the Daily charts using the originally intended settings. Thats why i want to find the M/A applied to ? Ill attach a screen shot of my charts so you can see i do not use many indicators. With that said i REALY like NOT having the M/A S on the chats at all. The small arrows drawn by these indicators are very accurate and much cleaner. I have never traded on the Daily charts with any consistency nor have i honestly given it a fair shot. This looks good. I have made a commitment to myself not to Style drift a long time ago. If there is no answer to my original question then i will not do it. With that said my intention is to try this for a while and if things go well I will open a live account dedicated to trading ONLY the daily T/Fs. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1129 ---
The second screen shot is what I may implement for the Daily T/Fs. It's working fine on the 5Min and 15 Min. Thus far.  My Time frame of choice is the 1Hrs with 15M Entry. I trade EUR / AUD and GBP / JPY 90% of the time. Its not show and tell as it seems by looking at the charts. NOT a holy grail. In fact I'm 55 / 45  at best. My Strength is in my Money management. I have been a member at FF Factory since 2010 and have posted 11 times or so. I have learned to weed out HYPE. This thread is good IMO. I appreciate the efforts and will post my findings in the future. I suggest to all of you not to give up on this and implement Discipline. Ive found that the best thing that can happen to a trader is a Loosing trade. Every trade anyone takes is what they believe will be a winning trade, But fact is its a 50 / 50 ZERO SUM game. Thats translates to we must put the odds in our favor. turn it into a 55 / 45 ….  60 / 40 even 50 / 50 is good with proper Money Management. In fact 50/50 can be GREAT. EVEN 45 / 55 or less can make you Money.

--- 帖子 #1130 ---
for my trading experience, the price action trade is enough at all..

--- 帖子 #1131 ---
Those are interesting pictures, and it would seem that you get good entry and exit points from them, although there probably is more to know about the system. Where did you come across this? Or, more to the point, what platform are you using to get such color differentiation in the MACD?

--- 帖子 #1132 ---
It's a Standard MT4 Platform. I work with a 27in. I Mac P.C, Likely it's the P.C. giving the sharp contrast. This is my Normal Chart. The one I use everyday. Nothing Special. The Background colors are an indicator I had Programed for me by a professional Coder. The background color change represents a few indicators I like as a background color, Nothing really special. Price action " Divergence " was what most interested me on this chart. I follow price action and implement STRICT money Management. This thread and what is being discussed sparked  my interest in trading the  Daily Time frames. I do not want to change anything, just add the 5/8 properly on my Daily charts and test it out.    Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1133 ---
In the snap shot you may not be able to see the background very well, The darker spots are dark red and the lighter spots are dark green. In any case I mostly do not pay attention to it. I have to remember they are there and then I focus in on it, It's not critical to my trading. Im taking them out. It was a good idea at the time, was super hyped about getting it and now Its junk. LOL.  Im sure most of you guys have been there and done that. Im over it.

--- 帖子 #1134 ---
Can you please expand a little bit on your Strict money management. Thanks

--- 帖子 #1135 ---
Here is an excellent example of what happens when you don't follow the strategy, switch to shorter time frame(M1), get impulsive and let your ego determine what is the trend instead following the MA's system. Do not try at home. LOL

PS Any advice on how to stick to the rules will be appreciate it.

--- 帖子 #1136 ---
This is only a suggestion, Lets say you are looking at a potential trade. All the entry rules are checked off and it is a Go, now you need to figure out where

The Stop Loss is going, ( should be part of the rules ) Say you risk 2% of your account Balance  on any given trade and this trade requires a stop loss that would be at

4% risk. I would simply Cut my Lot size in 1/2. Or NOT TAKE THE TRADE AT ALL. Now hypothetically lets say the trade is going well, I like to take 50% off when Its

50% closer to My target and reduce my stop on the  remaining 50% to +2% Profit Then If I am at the trading terminal and I see my trade is at 75 / 80% + to target

I take another 1/3 off and remove my T/P then move my stop on the remainder of the trade to 50% profit and let the remaining 1/3 run. Now I manually trail the trade

Until the stop is Hit. Its very hard to let a trade work. In my opinion in order to improve ones discipline one should let the trade work over time not take it out when it is

going against you. Let the stop do its job. One of my biggest mistakes was  not letting the strategy prove itself worthy by letting the entire trade do what i

THOUGHT it should do. I haven't found a better way other than to follow the plan to the letter. That includes accepting the loss with as much gratitude as the win.

There is no difference between the two. 50 / 50 Zero sum game. Ive also come to value my losses pretty much more than any other trades. Ive come to realize

That reviewing the losses has been invaluable.  If we log nothing at all I suggest to log and review the lost trades. I always look to see if I missed any of the rules, if not the trade was a good trade.

--- 帖子 #1137 ---
Thank you. I appreciate your answer.

--- 帖子 #1138 ---
Well, have been trading this strategy since 2015-11-18 with 0.2 lots on real account with 7 pairs and doubled the money.

Initial amount 480 usd and now worth around 945 usd. Earlier this day account was around 1016 usd.

Sometimes it's very choppy like eurusd right now but when we got a trend the account increase in value like gbpjpy.

The small losses we will always have if no trend.

I have ema 5 close, ema 8 open lines, no more indicator.

Sometimes i trade more lots on pullback.

--- 帖子 #1139 ---
I've noticed that you use daily charts. How long do you hold your trades for?

Hi Jupiter13!

--- 帖子 #1144 ---
Dear All,

I found this EA attached that works well but i need someone recode it when price cross and close above or below the the Third Ema (Ema 200). Not need to wait that the two Ema 5 and Ema 8 are above or below the Third Ema to enter.

Sorry for my English. I'm a french guy.

Thank you very much for your help.

--- 帖子 #1145 ---
Hi Everyone,

I have a few questions.

What time frames do you use?

What filters do you use?

Do you wait for candle to close before entering?

--- 帖子 #1146 ---
​In answer to your question. I consider all time frames from M5 to W1 to determine trend direction. Once determined, I stick with the M5 frame to trade pullbacks. I don't know what you mean by filters. When my three indicators line up in agreement I take the trade. Does that help?

I have not found much value in considering the opening versus the close of a candle in the M5 time interval, as might be found in the D1 or higher. Nor do I like to stick around for more than a few hours, if the market gives me the choice. Too many loose lips of "experts" and "elite" can utter sheer nonsense that sends the prices in a senseless tizzy. Look at what will happen this Friday, and for how long the nonsense will last, before prices come back to approximately the same place as before. The moment that I see $100 or more in profit I grab it and look for another opportunity.

--- 帖子 #1147 ---
Hi there stelpm,

I'm still new in this trading stuffs.

I would like to ask you a few things here.

These SMA 5/8/50 you are talking about, do i have to put 'open' or 'close', high and low?

I would really like to try this strategy.

And what other indicators that would help this strategy?

Like MACD (which I don't know anything about it), or RSI?

Please help me on this one.

Thank you very much for your time.

--- 帖子 #1148 ---
I think most people use the open or close. Macd is really just a measure of moving averages in relation to each other.

--- 帖子 #1149 ---
Hi there theprofessor, which one should I put the 'open' or 'closed' on 5, 8, and 50?

And by the way, is SMA the same as EMA or MA?

Anyone? Help me please.

Thank you very much.

--- 帖子 #1150 ---
Hey anyone still using the 5/8 ema cross methods? I have backtested it visually and am keen on using it. Hope this thread gets revived and we can discuss more trading ideas regarding the 5/8 cross haha

--- 帖子 #1151 ---
HI guys, Yugenn here, age 14.  Im quite new to trading(just started trading 3 months ago).Today ive come to a new indicator "Non-lag MA". I find it easy to use n profitable, just put Buy/Sell when the colour of the single MA changes. In 15min chart, u can enter market many times(i find it suitable for all timeframes n for more profit, trade GBP/JPY).It work well on trendy markets.Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #1152 ---
Can you pls upload the indicator you are talking about?

I just back-tested the simple SMA5/8 crossover on daily for EURUSD Jan to Oct 2016 with stop loss and take profit settings based on ATR(14) 4 hour and with trailing stops. Lot sizes were based on risk management settings. It's part of my final testing for an EA, fxRulesEngine, that allows traders to configure plans like this without any software programming. The software processes trading rules and instructions in a text file. Okay I used the following to buy (and reverse to sell) on daily settings:SMA(5) crossed up over SMA(8) over the last two closed periods (therefore not current period) Price closed in last period above SMA(5) I also set on a "take the profit and run" setting that stops processing when profit objectives are met (to avoid future profit losses). The attachment finished mid March after achieving preset profit objectives. When run full term, the profit moved around a bit but ended in Oct with $224 (8.4% draw down).

--- 帖子 #1156 ---
You can filter the trades with RSI:

Hi, I tested the amazing cross-over strategy a little time back with fxRulesEngine. The rules differ from those in this threat by using EMAs instead of SMAs, and 60 minute time frame with an RSI cross-over system overlaid. I tried both SMA and EMA in the rules (very easy change in the EA configuration for users) and then used the median for the calculations instead of closing prices (as recommended by the author). Over Jan to Oct 2016 both ways produced losses by the end of the period. However they were profitable at different times showing how different strategies suit different market conditions.

Â

Of course, 5/10 MA cross-over system on a 60 minute chart is well into intraday trading that would only suit traders spending significant time periods in front of the computer. Therefore not so suited to the part-time trader with a full-time job, for example.

Â

I've attached my results for SMAs and EMAs in case of interest.

Â

However, I used the SMA variation on a 4 hour time frame and got a profitable return (see attached). Hope that helps Alex

--- 帖子 #1158 ---
Just to clarify the images in top to bottom order on my previous post are: SMA 60 minutes, EMA 60 minutes, and SMA 4 hour. Thanks Alex

--- 帖子 #1159 ---
Alex, well done.

I have been using this strategy for awhile now and it works well depending on how you tweak it. I'd be interested in discussing how you got your test results.

--- 帖子 #1160 ---
Sure. I'm a professional software programmer with many business clients (companies) for the years. I have found back-testing using Strategy Tester in the MetaTrader very frustrating. Essentially you had to create an Expert Advisor (EA) every time you wanted to test a different strategy. Even tweaking could be tedious and time consuming when you just want to vary some settings like time frames or periods and so on.

Â

So I wrote software (to be released commercially) for the MT4 platform as an EA that would enable traders to test and trade plans without writing software or without hiring or begging a programmer to help. My software, fxRulesEngine, allows traders to configure trading plans as a series of trading rules and instructions to be executed as back testing or forward testing on a demo account or running on a live account as a traditional trading Robot. The difference here with other Robots is that it's your trading plan.

Â

Without boring you with the details at this stage, Rules consist of qualifiers that must be true to trigger. A Rule then executes your instructions, such as opening orders, closing orders, trailing stops, and so on. Qualifiers are essentially indicators like Moving Averages, RSI, CCI, Bollingers, and others. I've programmed in over 40 at this staged that can be combined in many different ways. So many mechanical style strategies are easily configured and more importantly easily tweaked for testing. So the three examples above took me about 15 minutes to complete with testing. The time consuming part was capturing the images for the thread. I've also added solid support for risk management and automatic stop loss and take profit management from ATR calculations.

Â

I'm planning to release fxRulesEngine within three weeks with comprehensive documentation to help traders maximize their use of the software. There will be a free, full functioning version that can be used to forward test on any demo account. However licensing will be needed for back-testing and on a live account. Furthermore I want to set up a separate thread here describing my testing results of popular strategies. All being well that should be later in the week, where I shall also include a pre-release demo copy of fxRulesEngine for experimenting by traders. However any strategies I discuss will be able to traded manually. There would be no locking into my software. So the thread is to add to our body of knowledge on being successful traders.

Â

Again, I appreciate your asking. Alex

hello fellowtraders,

im new to the game of forex.

after reading this thread i got very interested in this strategy, mainly cause of the simplicity.

can somebody please explain to me the exact rules?

i keep missing out on trades, or making wrong decisions according to the trend. it is almost like the market does exactly the opposite of my trade when i take the trade.

thanks in advance,
