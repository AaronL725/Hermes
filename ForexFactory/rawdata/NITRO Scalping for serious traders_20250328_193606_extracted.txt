Nitro Scalping is a trading strategy using RENKO bars instead of candles (although some still use candles). We try to stay focused on PA (price action) instead of relying on indicators, which nearly always lag price. Our goal is to trade pure PA capturing 3-10 pips per trade. Using this "less is more" strategy, many are saying they are making consistent profits in forex for the first time ever. ==================================================== TRADING NITRO A commercial version of the renko bars is recommended, the free version written for MT4 does not work well. UPDATE: some programmers in FF have been working on the free version and now say that it is working. You can visit the Renko Block Chart thread in the Programming Forum to obtain the latest version. To locate the commercial version, do a search for "mql renko bars". Renko bars, invented by the Japanese (of course!) operate 'outside of time'. They only form when a specific number of pip movement has been achieved no matter how long this takes. This makes the charts 'less noisy' and easier to see price movement. They take some getting used to, but most who use them for a week or two greatly prefer them to candles. (also iinvented by the Japanese....) We put up 4 charts of these pairs : EY, GY, AY and either NZD/Y or CAD/Y and then during specific trading times (below) we sit back and watch for CORRELATION in price movement between the 4 pair . USD/JPY can also be watched, but is normally not traded. We are looking for all 4 pairs to be moving in sync . When this correlation is spotted (and it occurs at least once during every trading session) you can take your trade in all pairs or just focus on one or two. Your choice. For indicators, we use the sm trix-colored candles (smC4scalperCandles) to color the renko bars, settings 2,1,1,1, indicator attached below. DX Trade wrote a neat 'dashboard' and some use that, also attached A HMA color line is used as moving average, settings are 8,3,3 or 10,3,3. Some use other settings or you can use the MA in Color with Applied Price . Momentum indicator set to 4 is a standard MT4 indicators. A Trix indicator is also used but it is built into the dashboard &amp; into the candles. And .. Chris_B wrote a Nitro arrow indicator based on momentum that many find useful (and he is still working on improving...) All attached. However as stated above, our goal is to ELIMINATE indicators and learn to trade on pure &amp; naked PA (price action). Those who have learned to do this, since early August 2009, are already seeing consistent profit with a 90% or better win ratio. As to how to do it, you will learn fastest from the charts posted on this thread. Once CORRELATION is noted, we are looking for a ' primer ' which could be trix-colored candles changing color, then a ' trigger ' which could be the moving average cross. The rules are not set in stone as people find their own favorite primers and triggers. The object, once again, is to learn how to 'see' from PA alone where price is going next and then to capture only a fraction of that move. Studying the charts posted in this thread is the best way to learn how to do this successfully. Template is not provided as nearly everyone does it a bit differently. Study the charts!! Best Hours to Trade : just before &amp; during major market opens, i.e. Tokyo-London open or London-US Open. Renko bars can be traded anytime but best PA is during those overlap times. The R:R is not good with this strategy .. that is admitted up front. But the WIN ratio (once you get used to doing this) is spectacular. We are going for 3-10 pip gains, usually 3-5, and do it several times until 2% account growth goal is reached. Rinse &amp; repeat. Stop losses are usually set at 20-30 pips (I told you the RR sucked!) But if you are winning 95% of the time .. do you care? Some traders just wait for correlation, then pick the strongest pair and put a 5 lot trade on that one. 5 pips profit x 5 lots = 25 pips. They are done for the day. This is not a strategy to become a mega-millionaire, just to make a comfortable full time living trading Forex. 25 pips a day trading full lots is $250 per day, 50 pips (two 5 lot trades in the example above) is $500 per day. Most can survive on that. Please use Demo accounts only to start! When you can bank your 3-5 pips consistently without emotion you may be ready for live trading. The method is 25% mechanical .. 75% emotion. You will learn the mechanical part with constant practice. The 75% emotional part means keeping greed in check. The temptation to try for 'just a few more pips' can be an account-killer. NOTE: several traders who have already become skilled at doing this are now finding ways to capture more pips with longer moves. The basic strategy remains the same however, the goal is consistent daily pips, 20 to 30 total and newbies to the method are advised to become very proficient at capturing the smaller pip moves before even considering greater profits. A $1000.00 account, gaining 25 pips per day, 5 days a week, with the power of compounding willl grow to $40k in just one year! Many posters on this thread are already skilled at this and new ones will learn best from studying their posts &amp; charts. Many people are saying they are earning money consistently for the first time ever with this strategy. ***SEE ALSO POST #31, PAGE 3 FOR MORE EXPLANATION ON TRADING NITRO*** And please re-read the above one more time and help us keep the focus in this thread. If you have a favorite indicator or a neat way of using trailing stops .. please post it somewhere else .. thanks!

Thank you, 4xStar, for starting this thread. I hope that the more experienced traders will continue to post here enabling us to learn and earn a bit more.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
i'm in, heres my 2 trades so far today. I do run a 10 pip tp ea. for when the markets moving well, but do also close slower movers at +5

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Just posted this in the C4 thread as well but will post it here as well,2 trades on EJ for +5 each. The GMACD signals on the bottom shows me the overall trend nicely,started using it on Nitro today so cant comment on how usefull it is yet,I personally like it visually. Not sure what settings im going to use on the arrows,still working on that. Nice job on creating a Nitro thread. Edit: Actually its +7 and +5,looks like my EA took the first trade out a bit later. ~Jeroen

--- 帖子 #5 ---
I am now starting to use Nitro, I will post as I go. rough start though. Maybe we should list the indicators used, settings, and method in the first page ?

--- 帖子 #6 ---
4XStar. Thanks for starting up our new home. Look forward to contributing my two pennyworth. Regards Dave W

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Would not enter the trade until the spread on Oanda has returned to normal (after 1 min) , by which time the direction is determined. Did not trade but looking back for interest sake would have been an easy 7 pips.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Thanks 4xstar. I will post here but also waiting for a response from edge on the other thread. hopefully, the drama doesn't follow us so we can get on with our trading. Took a loss today trading the news. Got in a little late. I should know better There comes that 75% thing again Greg

--- 帖子 #9 ---
I am too .. this may be a temporary home, but so far it is free of negativity. Yep .. go for the sure ones, otherwise go to Vegas

--- 帖子 #10 ---
You're right, I will amend the first post and add indicators.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Why are you so restrictive 4xStar ? It could be a complementary method to the swing trade and what do you mean by "for serious traders only" ?

--- 帖子 #12 ---
My thanks also for starting this thread. This method has been good for me, and I think for many others. All of the drama has gotten old - I hope that you will have a heavy finger for those that try to disrupt here. At the end of the day, MOST of us are here to learn, not to play games. Best Regards!

This is a scalping thread, we are not interested in discussing swing trading. There are plenty of other threads for that discussion. Feel free to use this as a 'swing trade' but please do not post results or commentary in here. We want to stay focused. Thanks.

Hello 4xStar, why so fast with opening a new thread? - Lets wait for the final outcoming of the 'edge incident'. He seems to be KB but perhaps FF will allow him to continue his work. If not there will still be time to open a new home of Nitro trading. Tex.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
just was a little sad to see that i am not welcome since i Wannaberich! lol now seriously, enjoy the new house a lot and hope it will have a nice "environment", positive and supportive. good one, 4xstar! good pips to all.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
This may be a temporary home, it can always be dismantled, but I didn't want to risk losing some of the excellent traders contributions over the next few days. Keep the energy going until we know what will happen next.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Oh you can 'wanna be rich' all you want! I'm sure that is ultimately all our goals, just .. no promises. Until just now I was not seeing any correlation on the 4 pairs (I am using NZ-Y as my fourth) .. but as of a few minutes ago .. thar they go!

God i am so impulsive (and greedy, by the way) good trade on CY and then screwd up with a late trade on EY. so long is the road for me. and it could be so easy: just follow (and respect) the signs!

--- 帖子 #21 ---
No doctored screens just 6th day in a row making a profit. The key is price action. Note that I removed everything but the Renko scalper candles and the MA. I have another MA on the chart strictly to help me identify the larger trend. I am only posting the EJ chart as this is all I traded today.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Nice ... I managed to get in too late on GY and EY on the last move up .. should have paid more attention to overall trend. What setting do you use on your longer term MA?

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Just my 1st day on Renko system, very impressed by system, just got to follow the rules..

Hello All, Glad that this thread got started. As you probably know, I was banned from the C4 thread for disagreements with Edge. If you took the time to go back through my posts there (please don't waste your time) you will see that all of my posts had good intentions and that I was simply asking probing questions. I was working very hard to make C4 and Nitro work for me. In the end, I hit a roadblock with Nitro and asked Edge to give another clue to help us along. That's when he went off his rocker - and admittedly so did I for a post or two. In my last post in that thread I stated that I thought Nitro was nothing but vapor. That's because Edge kept dangling the carrot in front of us (and as of this week still was by delaying his Nitro thread another week), and I was beginning to think it might all be some kind of joke. His response indicated to me one of two things: either Nitro would not ever work, or the keys to the system would be eventually offered for sale in the form of an EA by Edge (or an alias). I could figure no other explanation for his response. I feel that I was treated unfairly. I was just trying to contribute. I never criticized the methods negatively, just was asking difficult questions. I gave Edge the benefit of the doubt that his methods were sound. My gut, at the time, told me that something underhanded was going on. So I would not be telling the truth if I said I was not happy to see Edge disappear. I do suspect that there might be a way to make Nitro a powerful scalping method. But keep in mind - the math does not lie. If the TP level is 5 pips and the SL is around 20 pips, we will need a hit rate of over 85% for this to be a comfortably profitable method. I hope that you realize that I can add value here and that you will welcome me back. If not, ban me and I'll just watch from the sidelines. I hope you make some good progress. Doc

I am using the MA in Color_wAppliedPrice(24,3,6). It helps identify the longer term trend.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
These are my trades for today...i was very distracted by the "non trading" posts...and not enough focused on trading...took 2 losses...but the day end with a +1,42%

--- 帖子 #27 ---
OK .. I am trying it with 34 (another fib number) but will put your settings on as well to see which one works better for me. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Can't argue with that!

Hi 4X Which indicator is it for MA MA in Color_wAppliedPrice or HMA_color_nrp ?

--- 帖子 #31 ---
What Do We Know About Nitro? From Edgetrader’s post on the C4 Strategy forum of Sunday, August 02, 2009, 8:58 pm (since removed): His “original” Nitro system backtested on TradeStation including a screenshot of Nitro trades on the EURJPY, supposedly had the following indicators and settings: 1. WMA (16) 2. TRIX (5) 3. Momentum (4) – Primer 4. MA cross with TRIX confirmation is the Trigger Listed the GBPUSD, EURUSD, and USDCHF pairs. However the screenshot and Excel spreadsheet shared was for the EURJPY. Renko blocks were set at 10 pip blocks but it was suggested 5 pip blocks could provide quicker activity. The screenshot showed 10 pip blocks. I have checked the trades in the trade list of the spreadsheet against the screenshot and they do check out. From the C4 Strategy Post #1 updated August 7, 2009, the following was recommended for the NITRO STRATEGY: Commercial Renko charting package is recommended. The following Indicator settings were recommended: 1. HMA color set at 8,3,3,true,2,0. ( MA in Color_wAppliedPrice.mq4 ) 2. SM Super Trix PV4 set at 2,1,1,1. (Keep ONLY the signal arrows on your charts) ( smSuper TRIX_PV_4col.ex4 ). 3. Momentum set at 4 and overlayed within the TRIX indicator box. (Standard MT4 indicator). 4. DXTrade Information C4/Nitro meter (default settings) ( DXTrade C4 Nitro Dashboard.ex4 ) 5. SM Scalper Candles set at 2,1,1,1 overlaid on the Renko bricks. ( smC4Scalper Candles_v3.ex4 ) Best suited pairs listed were the EURJPY, CHFJPY, AUDJPY, and GBPJPY. Substitute GBPJPY with USDJPY if uncomfortable with large spreads and high volatility. 1. Set the Renko brick size to 10 pips 2 - SM Scalper candles turn color as does the HMA color indicator. Momentum crosses the 'zero' level of the TRIX indicator – Primers 3 - TRIX arrow appears – Charge! 4 - Two (2) bombs on the meter that are the same color. – Detonator. TP = 5 pips SL is arbitrary. What is the Nitro Strategy Now? Renko charts – commercial or freebie – your choice. Indicators: · Moving average. WMA 8 to 12 or HMA 8 · TRIX 2 to 6 OR · IndexedMomentumK – 2,10,2,3. · Other indicators per your discretion Entry/Exit: 5 pips TP, SL is discretionary Correlation with other JPY pairs provides confirmation of trend direction. FOCUS ON PRICE ACTION. Price action is best described as how fast the price is moving in the direction of the trend. If it is moving fast enough you can get in and hit your profit target within one to two minutes. This is considered a high-probability trade. The concept of “less is more” applies to indicators, trading goals, risk. Conceivably, a 5 pip profit made with one trade of 5 lots has less risk than 5 – 1 lot trades making 5 pips. Can this strategy be traded profitably? That is for you to decide. A number of people have been forward testing this strategy and are convinced that it is profitable and worth pursuing. I am one of those who believe that. My basic plan has been to trade it for a couple hundred trades in a demo environment, go live with small exposure (1 mini lot) and test it again for a couple hundred trades. From there, go to larger lot sizes (1 to 10 standard lots). Post your thoughts, comments, feedback, critiques, ideas, etc. that you feel will validate and improve the strategy. Please don't post mindless BS, accusations, innuendos, rants, etc. that do not improve the strategy. Thanks

For Nitro we are using Renko charts,I think its posted in the first post where to get a free version. Im not using the free version myself so im not sure how well it works. Edit: actually its in the other Nitro thread,if you want the free version you should look at the second post: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=193547 ~Jeroen

really glad to see i am not the only one! started 2 weeks too. i'll keep fighting along your side, pal! be well Wanna

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Racer and Wannerbe. Guys, was a struggle at first, cant really explain it, it just clicked at some point Was mostly due to not reacting to the indicators. It was waiting for the set up then deciding at that point if i was happy to take the trade. Someone else said something that stuck " When the set up occurs I look for reasons NOT to take the trade rather than reason to take it. If i cant find any then take it" If you post a chart or two of trades taken that didn't work out we will all do our best to help to show how or why we would have kept out. All the talk about the Risk/Reward and Win/Lose needs to be talked over slightly I think....... The overall aim/direction of Nitro was to minimise the exposure in the market as much as possible, and i believe it was going to eventually lead to 1 trade a day. When only looking for that 1 trade a day you can chose the BEST possible set up when everything is good and in your favor. Yes, there is never going to be a 100% system. But being at 7 days in a row without loss i am happy with the numbers. When all 4 pairs are in unison and I am only looking for 1 trade for a pathetic 5 pips which usually takes all of about 15 seconds to get and rarely goes into the red then it is worth it (In my opinion) This system hasn't been around long enough to show what it is going to be like over a longer period of time, however those here are working to wards that and are hopeful. Thanks guys for opening the thread and continuing the system, looking forward to future developments Thanks Waddij

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Today's trade were 50% win and 50% loss. (many negative pips overall) well keep trading this system for a few more days to decide if it is for me or not. still unsure of the indis.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
I really feel for you man. I couldn't do squat with it at first but I spent a lot of hours just sitting and watching the charts. I have begun to recognize Price Action and can identify when to get in and out fairly intuitively. It hasn't been easy. I've only had 6 profitable days straight and each trade is always a risk. But, the more you practice, the better you will become at this. However, I have been averaging 4% to 6% per day on a 10K account (demo right now). You see in my post above that my plan after trading it for a couple hundred trades in demo is to go with mini lots first and then to full lots. I trade the demo as closely as I would trade a live account. (Been trading live for 5 years so I am not a virgin). However, this scalping strategy suits my trading style better than other strategies I have utilized so that is why I am sticking with it. Good luck. Keep at it. You will succeed if you put your mind to it.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
I think it is best to say all comers are welcome so long as we stay on track. The focus here is on the Nitro in its current incarnation. Please see my other posts for additional info.

If you are having trouble look at your charts, E/J specifically, there are patterns that repeat with Renko. How many wins if you would just enter on second brick every time? How many wins if you would just enter on second brick every time in the direction of strength? (just throw MA 50 on your chart for strength direction) How many wins if you would just enter on second brick every time in the direction of strength and at the suggested trading times? How many wins if you would just enter after one brick pullback every time in the direction of strength and at suggested trading times? What does probability trading mean? We heard about it but never really looked into it. Do the work for yourself, the results will at least intrigue you! Q

--- 帖子 #41 ---
I am sure this has been covered in past replys,,,,,But,,,I am sure there has been alot pips left on the table with the "less is more" money management system,,,,If your going to use a 20 pip stop,,,then you need at least 20 pip profit, 40 would be preferable,,,,Especially if your trading the dominant trend,,,,otherwise your just pissing in the wind!!,,,,These jpy pairs move dramatically at prime london/ny sessions,,,Be a little more patient,,,,, try and capture the full potential of these short moves,,,thx

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Absolutely not true. If the system provides 90% wins, then a 5 pip win with a 20 pip SL will make you very wealthy. Your point about being patient and riding for more pips is a good one, it's just not this system. Doc

--- 帖子 #43 ---
I remember your post on C4 about the visual backtest. Post 7545 to be exact. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...61#post2979661 I think everyone interest in Nitro should reread this post. It holds some clues for us all.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
There is another thread " Nitro for open minded traders " that explores other ways of using Nitro including longer term swing trades. On this thread we are focused on the original plan, which has been very well presented above .. taking fast quick pips, maybe even working towards just one high probability trade per day. We are not concerned with RR as the WIN percentage with this strategy, once mastered, is well above the 90% needed for continuous profitability.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Jazzman, why don't you copy &amp; paste that post over here .. it is a good one and that way it will be handy for people to see.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
I agree,,,Nitro can be very profitable,,,,But 9 times 5= 45 ---1 times 20 = 20,,,,,,Thats alot work for 25pips!!!,,,Thats assuming the trader is 90% proficient,,,,Breakeven at 80%?,,,,,Doesnt make sense to me,,,,,My point is ,,,,the potential for additional pips is very worthwhile,,Why not take advantage of it,,,thx

--- 帖子 #48 ---
In the other thread they are open to discussing that variation.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Ok,,,,thx

--- 帖子 #50 ---
I really would like everybody to look at their charts so you can relate. This is a re-post from the C4 thread. Please do you homework, don't just take my word. Just for fun (I'm addicted), I wanted to do a visual backtest of Renko blocks, specifically when there is just one block formed. The results are kind of interesting although I don't know if it means anything. These are all approximations...but pretty close. From August 3rd on EJ there have been 405 changes of direction where at least one 10 tic brick was formed in the opposite direction. Of those 405 direction changes, 123 were only 1 brick which translates to roughly 30%. This means that if you traded the second brick on every direction change you should win 70% of the time. Now this is where it gets interesting. What if you only traded with strength with no other factors involved? No patterns, fibs, no s/r or taking consideration for tops/bottoms etc. I threw MA 48 on my chart and just traded with the trend. I took every trade that was in the direction of the MA. Trading with the trend eliminated 63 trades! That brought the losing percentage down to 15% so now we are at 85% winners taking every trade with the trend on the second brick. This is only theoretical of course because the market is so fickle, but it sound pretty good and you dont need ANY indicators on your chart. Now what if we did the same thing and added momentum the correct trading time and a few other factors like PA. We might be able to get that percentage even higher...at least the probabilities are better. What do you think...food for thought? Q

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Jazz, I did the same sort of test with EJ over a shorter time period and got the same 70% to 75% success rate. I tried filtering in different ways: trading time, only with trend, S/R. I could not improve upon the 75%. I posted this and that is when Edge came down on me and banned me, so I did not get a chance to expand upon it. But I am with you. If what I call the "Base" success rate is 75% (i.e. trade like a monkey), then there has to be a way to improve upon that. I just couldn't figure it out. That is why I am looking forward to the development of this thread. Hoping someone smarter than me can figure it out! Doc

Hi DocPMD: Don't let the rat beat you. "Unless you experience the unpleasant symptoms of being wrong, your brain will never revise its models. Before your neurons can succeed, they must repeatedly fail. There are no shortcuts for this painstaking process." Pg 54 - HOW WE DECIDE "Look, for example, at this elegant little experiment. A rat was put in a T-shaped maze with a few morsels of food placed on either the far right or left side of the enclosure. The placement of the food is randomly determined, but the dice is rigged: over the long run, the food was placed on the left side sixty per cent of the time. How did the rat respond? It quickly realized that the left side was more rewarding. As a result, it always went to the left, which resulted in a sixty percent success rate. The rat didn't strive for perfection. It didn't search for a Unified Theory of the T-shaped maze, or try to decipher the disorder. Instead, it accepted the inherent uncertainty of the reward and learned to settle for the best possible alternative. The experiment was then repeated with Yale undergraduates. Unlike the rat, their swollen brains stubbornly searched for the elusive pattern that determined the placement of the reward. They made predictions and then tried to learn from their prediction errors. The problem was that there was nothing to predict: the randomness was real. Because the students refused to settle for a 60 percent success rate, they ended up with a 52 percent success rate. Although most of the students were convinced they were making progress towards identifying the underlying algorithm, they were actually being outsmarted by a rat." Pg 64 - HOW WE DECIDE "Think about the stock market, which is a classic example of a "random walk," since the past movement of any particular stock cannot be used to predict its future movement. The inherent randomness of the market was first proposed by the economist Eugene Fama, in the early 1960's. Fama looked at decades of stock market data in order to prove that no amount of knowledge or rational analysis could help you figure out what would happen next. All of the esoteric tools used by investors to make sense of the market were pure nonsense. Wall Street was like a slot machine." Pg 67 - HOW WE DECIDE

I agree, BUT...you can engage a strategy to profit from what you expect the market to do while also protecting yourself if it doesn't. this is also know as Money Management. Also, I disagree with the premise above (highlighted in magenta). I think the odds OVERWHELMINGLY favor the fact that if a bar closed red the next one will also (same with green). It's the exception rather than the rule to see every other bar change colors. krly

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Hi krly: That is precisely why the rat will beat you. While you are " expecting " something and " predicting ", the rat is following what the market is doing. It has already been proven.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
I would concur with your observation to a certain degree. I just completed my own and here is what my findings are: Period of observation: 6/25/2009 to 8/25/2009 Number of direction changes: 1100 Number of single bricks: 304 Percentage of single bricks to Direction Change: 27.64% Which means 72.36% of all trades would be profitable on second brick. However, if you add a 48 MA as suggested and only trade the trend, you would still have only 72% profitable trades because half of your direction changes would still be single brick changes. This is contrary to what is stated above. This is because you would be trading only half the trades (uptrend trades eliminate all countertrend trades and vice-versa but it does not eliminate single bar direction changes). Back to the drawing board with this one. Can anyone see how to eliminate the single bar trades?

--- 帖子 #56 ---
I am in full agreement. From the book "Trading in the Zone" the five pillars of success are: Anything can happen. You don't need to know what is going to happen next in order to make money. There is a random distribution between wins and losses for any given set of variables that define an edge. An edge is nothing more than an indication of a higher probability of one thing happening over another. Every moment in the market is unique.

Something that was asked but not answered: This thread is for serious traders. Please be aware that those trading Nitro have done the leg work on C4. If you are new to this thread and have only read this one then please go and read the other C4 thread and if possible the one started by Edgetrader called c4 Scalping. This thread is dedicated to trading NITRO and not much else. If you feel that as an experienced trader you have an indi or some other observation that you feel would benefit this system then test it for a few weeks, record your findings then present them. I feel i can speak for most when i say we no longer wish to add any other indis to our charts......the goal is to remove them. Experienced and new traders are welcome, but please respect the wishes of the thread originator and those that wish to discuss THAT METHOD ONLY here. If you dont understand and are struggeling with your trades then post a screen shot and the problem and we will do what we can to help. If however it is covered in various other indi's, its not a nitro pair and goes against what we do here then please be prepaired to be told to bugger off. With regards to the risk vx reward win vs loss blah blah blah before commenting or judging just try yourself for a few weeks on a demo. At this point i am not planning on having a losing trade with this system so it doesn't really effect me. I am not planning on taking more that 5 pips either, or more than 2% account growth a day as well..... not the normal for most threads and systems so please try to come to terms with it Thanks Guys. Glad we could keep Nitro alive. THanks

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Actually it would be a bit higher as some of the second bricks may have gone all the way to 9 pips before pulling back, you would have been able to get 5 or less pips and win the trade. Hard to tell how many, maybe I'll enable the wicks on Renko and look at it. I don't want to over think it, just need to hit it once a day not every time.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Hi 4xtrader2: I would continue this discussion but afraid I may be told to "buggar off".

--- 帖子 #60 ---
I've been watching from afar for awhile. I'm just about ready to trade live w/Nitro as I been using a demo acct for two weeks to practice. I liked the idea of getting a message on my cell phone when the price went above the 10 lwma. So that's why I've been using the MA Price Cross. I just modified the message to add the symbol as most of us are monitoring more than one pair.

Doc/Jazz How can you test visually with 10 pip Renko blocks? After a block forms and until the next one forms all you know is that price is somewhere in a 30 pip range (not more than 10 pips from the top or 10 pips from the bottom). How does that work with a 5 pip TP 10 pip SL? Anything could have happened within that 30 pip range Also isn't the price used to decide whether to draw a block based on sampling the underlying price say every 1 minute which would mean you miss movement between samples?

I understand. There is a basis for approaching the market, but expecting the market to do anything but produce data to us sets us up for disappointments. All I can say guys, is read the book. Trading in the Zone by Mark Douglas

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Does anyone know of some type of alert that would sound when a new block is formed? My poor eyes are getting tired.....LOL JoeSDF

--- 帖子 #64 ---
It wasn't very scientific just visually counting and looking for patterns. Understood thats why its hard to come up with true percentages, these just worse case scenario so far. They dont account for the "ghost bricks" that you may have won the trade. I go for 5 pips max and never use 10 pip sl, some times I'll take 1 and be happy with it if I'm exposed too long. Someone else will have to answer this, I am a visual trader not a techie.

I ran the test on this in Tradestation. Here are the basic results. 66.87% profitable trades TP = 10 pips SL = 12 pips

Not bad, how about the other end of the spectrum during the suggested time? Appreciate the work! TP=5 SL=30 I see what you are going for on the ratio, but a 12 pip stop on E/J won't do anytime. Q

--- 帖子 #71 ---
You don't even wanna know... It would lose my shorts, my house, my dog, my pickup truck, maybe even my wife... The best results came from a 10 pip profit target and a 6 pip stop loss which gets you out right away.

Hi guys, I'm really interested in the discussion you are having on finding a statistically profitable way to trade renko bars. FYI, I have read every post on the original C4 thread, and have been experimenting with both C4 and Nitro for a couple weeks. I think the easiest TP and SL would depend on the pair you are testing, and your regular spread. For me, a complete brick on EJ means +6 (you can do +5 in case you missed the entry by 1 pip to be conservative). In the other direction, a completed brick is -24 (2 x 10 + spread). I don't see any reason to test with 30 as a stop loss; a new brick is formed in the other direction before that, which would be an obvious signal the trade is a loser. This is the easiest way to visually backtest with Renko bars. Of course, you can use the wicks to test other strategies, as I think 24 might be too big of a stop loss, if you are really going for high momentum moves. I like the idea of looking for patterns in renko bars themselves, and waiting for reversal patterns (2 bars in opposite direction, etc.) I definitely agree trading with the trend should filter some losers. I look forward to finding a statistically significant high probability set up together, in addition to manually trading based on correlation, etc. Thanks! Cory

&gt;&gt; Someone else will have to answer this, I am a visual trader not a techie. You're not interested in how the chart is constructed? Why would you want to trade using something you don't understand - and I'm not talking about the code but the general principal of what price is used to draw it. Using daily prices to construct a Renko chart you would use just the closing price. I'm assuming that on an intraday basis you'd use the price every X minutes. The bigger you make X the more price ticks you ignore. Importantly Renko ignores the range of prices between samples, which you see on bar/candle charts. Be very careful trading using Renko charts because the chart gives a distorted view of reality.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Thanks for your concern, but we have already been through the Renko trials. I think that there is a better thread for you than this if you are going to lecture on Renko...everyone here is using it. Q

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I think your numbers are understaing the potential results. Remember that with each single block the PA may have travelled to the 5 pip take profit point before reversing to form a block in the opposite direction. Assuing 25% make the 5 pip target + spread then that improves your stats. regards Peter

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Meanwhile back at the beach I knew that 134 had a lot of support but price had good momentum coming down...kaboom. I took second trade (not recommended) as price broke through resistance then pulled back a couple of pips then...Kaboom. First trade was a safer trade. Q

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Frank, Seems like I've read the rat experiment a thousand times by now, and I understand the meaning of it. But I'm not sure how it relates to the context of my post. If I were the rat, I would take the Renko reversal every time, because the wins/losses come in random order and you never know which trade will yield the "food". I understand and agree with that. Problem is, in our maze you would only get the food around 70% of the time, and in order to stay fat and happy with a 5 pip target and 20+ pip SL we would need to get food over 85% of the time. So the only solution is to change the maze. How can we change the maze, well I can think of a few of ways: 1. Go for more pips on a win (subject of the other nitro thread); 2. Tolerate fewer pips on a loss (some here are attempting this, but probably not "rat like"); 3. Improve the hit rate by improving the entry signal (a lot of people working on this so we can still act like rats); 4. Other things that I have not thought of. I'm pretty sure that I understand the concepts, please clarify your example if you think I am misinterpreting your post. Doc BTW - My rat captured two +5 wins riding your blue trains earlier today. So I haven't given up on your method.

Back to normality

--- 帖子 #79 ---
The following should be obvious - if Nitro is a profitable system that profitability does not come from using Renko charts. If a sequence down bricks ends and you get an up brick that signifies exactly one thing - that price reversed at least 20 pips from when the last down brick was drawn. Does reversing 20/30/40 pips mean that the next 5 pips will also be in that direction? I don't know - but you don't need Renko charts to test that assertion. Renko charts are a (deliberate?) distraction.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Then Renko Bricks are nonsense? I'm still using C4, but cannot see the difference between Renko Bricks and lines on a regular chart spaced 5 or 10 pips apart. Would someone like to explain the advantage of Renko? Isn't waiting for a new brick to form the same as waiting for price to move 5 pips or 10 pips on a regular chart?

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Renko is a charting method designed to help visualize PA by filtering out the noise. Whether this is an advantage or not, who knows. Edge presented the idea and claimed it could be profitable, all we are trying to do is figure it out. Nothing more, nothing less. In the end, it may not provide an advantage. But for now, the assumption is that it does. Doc

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Many many many years ago I was a member of the Boy Scouts in the UK. We were taught that when we had a long task to complete we mentally broke it down into maneagable pieces. So on a long hike we would concentrate on a landmark a small distance ahead of us to focus on, when we reached it we would pick the next one. In any long taslk we would break it down into sections. Humans do this instinctively, finish this chapter before starting the next one, etc. So with trading. we tend to break down the moves into achievable targets, be it s/r lines, fibs, sweet numbers whatever, as out pea brains can handle that. Renko bars mentally give us a maneagable goal, only one brick and we can take profit. Using lines at 10 pips accomplishes the same thing. If you want to handle it that way that is your choice. So for us pea-brains let us beaver away on our own method and find our way to success. I would say the advantage of Renko bars is that they remove the distractions along the way so that your focus can remain on your target.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
I think this is a question many people have. Renko charts are useful because they take time out of the equation. The forex markets have slow periods and ranging periods, which effect indicators such as moving averages (the price stays at the same price so it flattens out). With Renko bars, you get to see the movement, and remove the time element. Indicators look different when applied to renko charts because it focuses only on the movement. Watching the price with 10 pip lines can have a similar effect, but only if you aren't using indicators on your charts. Either way, Renko is an easy way to isolate price movement. I hope this is helpful. Cory

Can you please post your losing trades? We can all learn from them.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Winning 70%, you will lose money. It's simple math, I did some test and here's result. 1 win would be (1 renko bar size - spread) 1 lose would be (1 renko bar size * SL (appx, 2 or 2.2) + spread) One of tightest spread ECN broker would charge you commission of 0.5 pip lose or bit less or more depending on the size of lot. I tested backward and forward. I did not even includ splipage. total trade: 100 symbol: EUR.USD won: 70 lost: 30 renko bar size: 10 pip spread: 1pip SL: (renko bar size * 2) Commission: 0.5 pip (only for me, I am using an ECN broker) win pips: 70 (win) * 9 (renko bar size - spread) = 630 lost pips: 30 (loss) * 20 (renko bar size * SL) + spread (30) = 630 this is result before the commission. no splipage applied. For me I had to add 50 pip to losing side for commission. My ECN broker offered 0.5 pip, 1.5 or 2pip spread for EUR.USD. So I took average, 1 pip. If I were you guys, I would seriously consider about scalping. In addition to this you need to set 2.1 SL because spread, or some of you win trades become losers. Another fact, splipage would kill your profit, altough you did good mony management. Please, be very cautious doing scalping unless you have a rock solid stregegy of at least 80% winning ratio. You can not ignore spread, it is the secret weapon will wipe out your money. Thank you.

When you use standard candlesticks instead of Renko and price "reverses" 20/30/40 pips, are you sure that next 5pips also will be in that direction ?Does this make a sense ?

--- 帖子 #87 ---
I think another thing to look at is renko block consolidation periods. They seem to range within a 2 to 3 block tunnel. At the breakout it usually runs for a couple blocks. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

A possible way is using 'hi-lo activator' set to '3, 0' and wicks enabled on Renkos. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi, have been giving some thought on avoiding the 1 bar swing change. The thing that has interested me is why use 10 pip bars when chasing 5 pips. What I have done is switch to 5 pip bars and used the MA line set to 5. Basically this doesn't change colour until the 2nd bar starts forming. It seems to work, alright and incidentally should give more trading opportunites. I have taken some one elses template and indicators for this. It seems to work better than anything I could develop. Apologies for not being able to recall who provided it, it is impressive. FOr those trading without indicators I think the inclusion of the MA is still worth considering. Food for thought regards Peter

--- 帖子 #91 ---
It serves as S/R levels indicator. While price is under the red section of the indy I only look for selling, while price is over the green section I look for buying. In most cases 'one brick reversals' are filtered this way. When indicator is changing it's color or price is retracing from the lower or upper level it may be a quick scalp opportunity. Also, when lower level (support) is breached, the newly formed upper section can be considered as an initial SL level. The same is true in the opposite situation. I'm still experimenting with this, Renko is something relatively new in my trading experience. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Wlfx - for the pairs that Nitro uses I don't know. But before trading Nitro I'd certainly want to know that it was true. I find the whole Nitro discussion strange because no-one is sure exactly what the rules are and no-one knows whether it works. All you seem to have is a hope that it works. Its good to see that some people are trying to test it before committing real $$$ because I don't think hope is a viable trading strategy.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Please post this template here so those interested don't have to search forever on the other thread..LOL Oh and if you will post the fx sniper kim IV as well I think I deleted it with other indicators not long ago. thanks Brian

--- 帖子 #94 ---
As far as I can see, almost all trend-following indies provide similar functions Initial question was about filtering out 'one brick reversals' which was not achievable with the tools presented. So I'm suggesting a possible solution based on wicks instead of pure Renko bricks.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Thanks for the good job done here. Pls what is the TF I can use??

--- 帖子 #96 ---
I think if you read through prior posts you'll see it is based on a lot more than hope. We have people starting to make consistent returns using renko PA, some have gone 7 days or more without a single loss. That is why we see such huge potential in this. Many others who are trading this successfully have not yet posted here. Now we are working to refine the method &amp; find the best way to trade it for steady profit. That is why we are not interested in variations on the method in here (i.e. greater profit taking, smaller stops, re-entries, etc). One thing I've noted: when people start to trade with renko they usually lose more than win the first couple of weeks. With consistent practice however sooner or later a lightbulb switches on and one starts to 'see' the PA others are talking about. No short-cuts, I think, although we continue to look for them.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
There is no TF with renko, it is based on # of pips move, not time.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
This is interesting and may be more useful than the HMA, at first glance .. but I don't get why it is important to see the wicks. Do they add something to interpretation of the indicator?

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Mate, 100% agree. Its not about Indi's its about the trader. The indi's for this system are there to prompt to trader to look at the chart and analyze, nothing more. Not one of them is there to say TAKE THE TRADE NOW. When the Trix, and the Ma and the Meter and the Momentum etc..... are all there it is still up to YOU the trader to decide if to take the trade. This decision will be based on all of those mentioned and correlation but MOST IMPORTANTLY the traders understanding of what is happening and belief of what will happen. Don't forget the target is only 5 pips. The visual back testing on Renko wont show how many of the 1 bar formations would have been profitable if taken. Also, there are no rules to say you have to wait until the Renko bar has closed before taking the trade. Aiming for 1 - 4 trades a day at only 5 pips is a TINY amount to get out of the market. YES, is very frustrating to take 5 pips at the start of a 40 pip move...... but to go 40 pips it has to go 5. Why do you need the 40 pips? Is it so you can get more money? If so up your lot size. And Yes i know, bigger lot size bigger loss if the SL is hit...... but by only taking 1 trade at each market overlap there is no pressure to take trade after trade after trade..... If you are happy with what you can see and can be patient to ONLY TAKE THE TRADE WHEN YOU CAN FEEL that it is going to work then the number of losing trades should be inconsequential. That is how i see it and as previously stated without 6 months of trading and the number to show am not going to know if it works out that way. All i know is that 7 days on the trot without losing a trade is very good for me and plan on continuing that way.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Good posting here for sure. Wish all of you the best btw. As you gain proficiency with MT4 Nitro, it has the ability to consistently operate in the 88-92% renge if trading in good volatility times. More than enough for you to survive off of. Also, have no intent of dominating this or any other offshoot thread. Keep plugging forward. The plan is solid. Not all will grasp it as scalping plans are a quandry to many quite often. Just the way it goes. Will wander around for a while.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
This seems to be nothing more than a Parabolic SAR indicator which realistically gives you the same information as the SM Scalper Candles and MA. It might be useful for making trade judgements but realistically we already know we are only going to trade with the trend and single bar counter trends would be losers. MA gives us the trend direction and TRIX or SM Scalper candles give us confirmation.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
It's a small deal but it makes a big difference for me..is momentum. I have very specific rules for the momentum indy 1. I added levels 100.05 and 99.95 for confirmed crosses 100 crosses are not good enough for me 2. I only enter if momentum crossed up or down correctly the same candle as my signal, ie the same renko bar that the trix or dxtrade etc gave an arrow. If it crossed before, even 1 bar before I let the trade go...its about momentum, the momentum has to break my levels at the same time as everything else I am looking at for a trade. Clarification!: On #2, to clarify, I never enter if momentum 4 is already in the correct direction ie above 100.05 or below 99.95 before the signal brick. I only trade if momentum crosses the level on the same as the signal brick or during the entry brick, which is my favorite of the two and usually when I would actually enter the trade. Brian

--- 帖子 #103 ---
It seems that without wicks it looks quite differently. I think in case of plain bricks true highs and lows (which are wicks) aren't saved in the file. Take a look at the picture - it's plain bricks for the same period of time. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Generally speaking I think without wicks we are missing a great portion of market info. But it's just my personal preference. Actually it was me who persuaded Michal (the author of the script) to add that option

Have been trading C4 for some time, but seems there may not be much interest in continuing with C4 on the main thread. Will continue to demo trade it on my own, anyway. Though I'd have a look at Nitro. Can someone who is successfully trading Nitro on MT4 with a free script kindly PM me with a link to where they acquired it? I have Googled for it, but would prefer a recommendation for one in particular. Thanks.

Quick in and out on two trades. Both trades less than a minute in the market. 7th day in a row profitable for the day. If you want to "see" price action focus on the chart. Watch the bars forming and the price on the sideline. The first trade was right after the news. I couldn't even get the profit target set. The second trade was made from the traditional "signal" of price crossing MA, Scalper Candle changing color and closing, and "Boom!" in the trade and out. I set the profit target wrong on the second trade. I was intending 5 pips (which it hit) and then reversed, so I got out with 4 pips.

I don't see any evidence on this thread that there is a statistical edge to the HMA/Trix/Renko combination. A statistical edge would give you better than 66% winners on a 5/10 TP/SL which is what a random entry would give you. There are successful scalpers but what does that tell you about Nitro? If waddij is right and its all about the trader - then there is no system. Bottom line is that if Nitro has an edge it should be possible to demonstrate that on historical data. If being profitable requires trader discretion then Nitro has no edge and you should all head over to Frankenpips thread

--- 帖子 #111 ---
I posted this in the other nitro thread, but with the permission of 4xStar, I am posting it here also: "I am a futures trader and have been looking to venture into forex. I've read most of the C4 thread with a special interest in the use of renko and you guys are definitely on the right track. I just wanted to offer a thought that I hope can be helpful. It seems that you have maximized the utility of indicators within this system, and any more time spent tweaking them or looking for new ones would probably be better spent elsewhere--especially when it comes to renko. Your system relies heavily on a high hit rate to make up for the R:R. Looking at the 4 pairs and the overall momentum of the markets (not the momentum indicator) is a great way to increase the hit rate. The focus should now be on finding high probability setups or patterns within the blocks that will increase your hit rate even more. This is true price action. I took Edgetrader's last chart and marked it to show some examples. Long story short: indicators will not get you to where you want to go and in my opinion, the day you get rid of them is the day your trading takes off (that's just opinion however as I know many like to use them). Your time and community effort would be best spent in trying to achieve the high hit rate by looking at price action alone--or more specifically how and WHY the renko blocks form the way they do. Study and track these formations with statistics/probabilities and you will be successful. That's where the efforts of a community could be put to good use. The devil is now in the details and hard work really will pay off--literally. Keep up the good work. Hope this helps. (I was going to post this in the other Nitro thread but thought it may be more appropriate here, though it would certainly apply there as well.)"

It is called renko. There are a few free indis out there but the commercial one is recommended. A quick google search will lead you there. http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/renkochart.asp

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Hi guys and gals. I thought I would start with a contribution of how my charts are laid out as well as how I will be testing this method. Nothing groundbreaking, just more data for you all to analyze. I'm starting with 10 tic blocks as well as the HMA color line set at 8,3,3. I'm going to be trying out a fixed TP of 10 and SL of 20 for the four pairs I'm using. **Correction I am now trading EUR/JPY, GBP/JPY, AUD/JPY and NZD/JPY** My primer is a contrarian bar, my trigger is a change in color of the HMA. I'm trading live, although my pip values will be low until I achieve the hit rate I am looking for. Oh and I'm using Oanda for now.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Here is a simple example that demonstrates my trade criteria being met. Oh, and 4xStar if I am deviating too much from the original plan just let me know and I'll post this on the other thread. I thought it was relevant enough, but it isn't my thread.

So i have to buy that indi?

--- 帖子 #122 ---
If you want to use the commercial one yes. I have seen a couple of free versions out there but from reading the various threads it seems they do not match the quality of the commercial indi. But you don't have to buy anything to experiment with Nitro.

Would someone post a renko WITH wicks chart ? Thanks.krly

--- 帖子 #124 ---
So instead of looking at a regular charts' up/down movements, you're looking for a new brick to form. So it could be seconds, minutes or hours before you see anything happen at all because a new brick only appears after price has moved a predetermined amount? Bricks mean movement up or down, and sideways fluctuations are not visible. Thanks. That clears things up a little. Will reserve judgement until I've tried it out. Nobody has PM'ed me recommending a free script as I requested, so I'll consider purchasing the commercial one. ...

I've spent another few hours this morning studying a Renko chart for EURJPY. I've tried several momentum indicators to try to filter trades with no luck. I also had a 1 min chart on my other screen so that I could go back and look at PA when a signal would come up in the Renko chart. Have not been able to see any consistent way to filter that way, either. I have to admit that I am a little cross eyed at the moment from looking at charts, so I am going to take a break from this. I hope that the group can continue to work on different ideas. I can't think of anything else to do at this point. Doc

EURJPY...

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Well I'm just beginning so don't take my word. I'm basically waiting till all 4 pairs (EY UY AY ChY) are correlated, the ma is aligned with the candles, and momentum is high in the direction of the trade. then if all the bombs get green... KABOOM!! I'm also using basic PA strategy like the ones outlined by asdf here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...3&amp;postcount=21 Necesarily VERY FEW TRADES per day, but I prefer to be on the conservative side since I'm a newbee. The hardest part seems to be to tie the horses and don't go with the emotions...

--- 帖子 #133 ---
So far it sounds like you have a firm grasp of the essence of this .. it is very very simple and just requires a ton of practice! Ain't that the truth!!!

--- 帖子 #134 ---
I think the 'filter' you are looking for is just your own recognition of price action and that will come only with a lot of practice .. it is what we all had to go through. Took me about 3 weeks of constant trading and I am still not as good as some others in here, although consistently in profit. You just have to decide on your primer, trigger (see post above by bali) and take the trade .. and do it again &amp; again. At a certain point you will begin to 'see' the PA and that will be the filter you are looking for. At least that's the way I see it

5 tic looks smoother &amp; easier to see trend .. but I'd have to look at a lot of charts to be sure.. and with 5 tic, fingers have to be even faster and 2 bars have to complete to get any profit (factoring in spread). I do like those Hi-Lo activator lines .. better than HMA, at least from today's experience.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Definitely! I'm beginning to get the feeling that the 'sixth element' is that sense of the PA 'in the body' where all of a sudden you see it and start riding the wave... Crazy eh? And pretty elusive for a system!! I wonder if I will ever be able to keep that recognition and use it on a daily basis... It's funny how my charts are beginning to have less and less indicators.

Yes and this is why it is so difficult for people to accept .. we have been conditioned to look for indicators, backtests, statistics and 'proof'. With this, it is all right in front of our noses .. just takes the time (and faith) to learn how to recognize it. asdf posted a cool chart on the other thread, I asked him to post it here as well .. great visual of PA in action...

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Actually .. I think you will .. but that is discussion for a metaphysical forum

--- 帖子 #144 ---
This is one of the live trades I took today. Visual backtests look very promising, I examined the last 20-25 eligible trades with each of the 4 pairs I use and the ratio of winners to losers was typically 20:1 or 25:2 give or take... I am eager to see what the forward testing reveals.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
As requested, with the accompanying post. Hope it helps. "Here is one more big picture look at the yuppie. Price never changes direction on a whim. There are always reasons for reversals. In order for buyers to overwhelm sellers or sellers to overwhelm buyers, they must congregate. Renko accentuates these areas. Hope this helps provide food for thought as to why price moves the way it does. If you understand this, then you understand price action."

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Thanks .. I had no idea we could look for patterns like H&amp;S on renko .. but of course it would be logical to do so.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Buddy, nice Idea I love it........ but a inverse head and shoulders stands for a bullish price move normally. and the price came off after it confirmed. you're on the right track.. I hope you did think long when you saw that forming.

Sorry to say but I’m not able to trade with PA only … I was attacked when I dared to post charts with indicators and so I’m insecure what to do and … last bnot least … how to do. Is the future of this thread trading only PA without indis? Or are only certain indis allowed to be discussed? And if it is so – do you decide to explain your way of trading and allow questions of people who are not able to have the ‘sixth sense’? I’m quite confused. This thread has become very strong regulated … if you don’t like persons posting here that have problems to follow at once your thoughts … it’s o.k. for me … than I will lurk from the sideline … perhaps some day my brain bulb will be enlightened. You may think I’m absolutely inexperienced, ignorant or stupid. I have seen that you are strictly banning every indicator. But this is a little cryptic and mystic to me. Yes sir, I’ve heard of H&amp;S and IH&amp;S while trading stocks but – please – how would you forecast where to PA will move? In your charts you ask questions … I’m looking and thinking about answers .. I can’t find any. Can you solve that riddle ... would you please give the answers to your questions? Highest Regards

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Studbiol: There's some answers in the other thread: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=1#post3000206 (I think we should consolidate both threads into one). I don't think there's a problem with your indis, everybody should be free to use whatever they want if it helps their trading...

--- 帖子 #150 ---
I wish we could consolidate, but people need to understand there is space on one thread for people who want 10 indis, people who want 3 indis and people who want no indis and all of us can learn from each other along the way... you never know where the right key for you will come! remember you can ignore anyone who is posting about things you are not interested in if need be!

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Yes, there is another thread called NITRO Variations for Open Minded Traders and there you can post new indicators, new ideas etc. We are all friends and many post to both threads. We are just trying to keep this one focused on 'pure' PA .. which I know to some may sound a bit like some sort of 'magic'. However nearly every day we have new people discovering how to 'see' the PA without need of indicators, so we may be on the right track, at least for some. Maybe others will always need indicators and maybe down the road someone in the other thread will find the perfect indi combo to scalp-trade the renko bars. For the moment, please just post pure PA commentary here. If you have fancy charts or new indicators, or want to go for more pips .. please use the other thread.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Nice Dave... and I think you could remove one or more of the bottom indis and still do as well. Renko bar formation + correlation tells the story.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
So as I'm looking over asdf's charts examining Renko price action along with the commentary (thank you by the way, they are most helpful) I was thinking about a couple of patterns and why they are relevant to future price action. Here is something you might think about if you have not already. Since renko is not time sensitive like other methods of charting then head and shoulder patterns really have a different significance. Or possibly the same significance but for different reasons. It is likely that speculative traders who use renko are in the minority. Therefore most traders do not see the same renko patterns and because of this, do not make trading decisions based off of said patterns. Imagine this example: Using a 10 tic brick, one head and shoulders pattern could take 5 hours to form using renko. That same pattern could then repeat itself in 1 hour... or 30 minutes... The point is that realtime price action might not resemble a head and two shoulders at all. What IS significant is that despite the time it takes to form the renko pattern, support and resistance levels form. Historical S/R levels are not affected by time passing, but rather by recency bias. That is, the impact a particular price point, level, zone (whatever you want to call it) has on the collective trader's psyche. My point is that unless renko traders start to become very common, it might be better to attribute a winning expectancy using a renko pattern to S/R rather than the pattern itself. What do you all think?

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Agree ... this is an area that merits further study. Since patterns on renko are not formed 'in time' but only by price movement .. their S/R impact may, in theory, be greater. Learning how to correctly determine S/R levels in renko may become one of our most valuable trading tools.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
A quick 10 pips, 40 minutes after Frankfurt open. Not difficult is it. The key is to wait for the correlation to kick in on at least 3 pairs.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
That's it!!! same happens all the time @ Tokyo open, London open, NY open. This is at least 3-4 trades (15 - 40 pips). More than enough for one day. Take care, GrZack

aka .. less = more Consistency is the key to long term success. As Edge would say: rinse &amp; repeat...

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Hi DarkDays...I have the commercial version of Renko bars..But do not know how to 'turn the wicks on'.. Thanks in advance..freddi

--- 帖子 #162 ---
You need to re-install your renko on the m1 chart and in the properties there is a "show wicks". set it to true. make sure you have the newest version. If you downloaded it in the last week or so, it is the newest one

--- 帖子 #163 ---
In addition to correlation what I have been seeing the past few days is that one pair often seems to 'lead the way'. The past day or two it has been the AY and also today you can see AY is already breaking out while EY GY and NY are still consolidating .. made +7 on AY.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
4xstar, Would you post your charts please?

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Yep Roto has it, just set the show wicks dropdown box to true when you apply it to the chart.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
First trade of friday, in and out within a couple of minutes. I'm not getting my hopes up, but forward testing is going well so far. 6 wins and 1 loss since yesterday.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Hi, for those who trade specifically at the open of the Tokyo, London/Frankfurt, and New York markets. It isn't gauranteed that a tradeable move will happen at these times, so how long do you watch the charts until you go away and wait for the next open. For example, when trading the New York open (9:30am EST) do you watch charts from 0930-1000, or 0915-0945 etc? I've been looking for trading oppertunities for 30mins after the open, but I'm just wondering what other people are doing? Regards, Matthew

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Another winner...

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Man this seems like such a crazy day. PA gone wild and I have enjoyed playing in it like a kid with a new digger in a sandbox. Ok, yes it looks like I am not following the signals or the rules. Friday two weeks ago was the same way - totally undisciplined. However, the difference today was seeing the price action and not just letting it sit there until the next "signal". Those pips were begging to be picked up off the table. Realistically, I got impatient on some trades and closed them early. One big loser but keep in mind it was a 5 lot as well. The drop today was well correlated between the pairs as well as with the Dow. 9 days in a row profitable. Who says PA is too hard to follow. Today it was like neon signs in Vegas pointing the way. Lose the fear and the rigidity of the rules and flow with it! Mark Douglas calls that Trading in the Zone. I agree.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Congrats on the 9 day streak! I'll be catching up to you shortly Again congrats on a great day. You really were in the zone!

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Congrats man! I was busy today and missed that long ride!

--- 帖子 #172 ---
But got a few pips later (stepped out a little before the 5 pips line because the PA became sluggish, beter safe than dead)

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Hi DarkDays, are you using 10 or 5pip brick Renko chart?

--- 帖子 #174 ---
I'm trying 10 tic bricks for now.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
I usually watch from one hour before open to 2-3 hours after, depending on PA .. if we have a day with lots of movement or news, I'll stick around longer, if a dull day, shorter .. although ya' never know what will happen. But trading past noon New York time is generally pretty dead.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Good for you DD, I took a similar trade on AY as it was leading the others up this morning .. then GY led them down so I took 3 separate shorts on that one, and finally one long .. all paid at least +5 so I am happy to end the week like that. And I know I am the world's worst at posting charts ... I will try to be better.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Another win, just set it and forget it... Can't wait for Monday. Netted 5.6% on my live account over the last two days. Aiming for 2% per day.

DarkDays Some good Renko info here about patterns http://www.forexoma.com/renko-chart-...-renko-charts/ AW

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Only time for one trade today. +5 X 4 lots That's one loss in last 10 days. That loss was my own stupidity. trading around the news AND entering late. The move was over. Just taking one trade a day is working quite well so far. Just watching momentum and waitin for correlation. I traded the aj today because I just liked the setup better. It had a more defined movement and direction. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #181 ---
E/J +5 +5 +5 +6...but you only need one a day to make you happy!

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Hi Dark Days Thanks for your very clear charts. I am not sure exactly when you enter your trades. You indicate that you enter as soon as the MA changes color which shows at the open of the next brick but I find that the MA can have several color changes while the new brick forms. The MA can in fact repaint until the brick is set. The PA for the new brick often moves in the opposite direction (retraces) which means the slope and color of the MA do not change immediately. Do you anticipate the direction of the new brick and go in anyway? Is this as you would/did trade it or is this from back testing - 2 very different scenarios I think. You can look back in the history of renko plots and see this situation many times but I am finding it is not the way it happens live. I am not having a go at you - on the contrary I am keen to know you rationale for taking the trade where you indicate your entry. Thanks Mate Karl

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Hi, I have been working on this chart this past week. Thought I would post it just for fun. I think we need indicators for this. It takes a while to understand PA. These blocks make us do that, eventually. This may be the next evolution of trading. These blocks are available ,really, just because of advances in technology. It is much easier and much cleaner way to watch for PA. Thanks to FrankenPip I finally am getting this posting thing I think. Have a great weekend.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
I am one of the folk who have followed Paulus and Edge from the beginning - and I have learnt a great deal. (I am having fun trading demo but still nervous about taking the plunge with real money!). Many of those who have been there for ages are now split between 'Serious' and 'Open Minded' threads which is terrific that the thinking and learning can continue with both C4 and Nitro. For several weeks now, I have been compelled to read the 5-10 new pages of the old thread every time I turned the computer on. To avoid the withdrawal symptoms, I now have 2 threads to read. I am sure that I am not alone. This post is a request to perhaps find common ground and amalgamate the 2 new terrific threads. Alternatively, rather than the posting to both threads, if the posters limit their contributions to one or other of the threads, it will save duplication. I for one will pick it up as I am now following both threads. I think the respective themes are clearly stated from the outset so where a post goes should not be too confusing. Hope I am not putting anyone's nose out of joint - its certainly not intended. Regards Karl

--- 帖子 #185 ---
My research continues.... Tweaking and tweaking...do I have the 100% indy?? I don't know.... Attached 2 images...1 is relative to yesterday...the brick to trade is the brick after the arrow...so the signal is confirmed and does not disappear...and in this way i can visually backtest what is happened every brick after the arrow... The second image is relative to a more choppy day....quite well i can see... But i wanna be VERY VERY VERY cautious...as always i don't know how the indy that i've used works in real time, i think it could repaint...because every time i see a 100% result is because the indy repaints... But...we will see... I know that you would like to try it...but first i want to see how it works in real time...it could be a BIG ILLUSION!!

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Keep up the good work Chris. Will keep the proverbial fingers crossed and be patient. Thanks for all your efforts Dave W

--- 帖子 #187 ---
No you're absolutely right, the MA can repaint and invalidate my signal. This sometimes turns the trade into a loser. Visual backtesting nets typically nets one or two losses per every 25 trades. Live trading has netted 3 losses out of 13 trades thus far. Certainly not near a large enough sample size to conclude anything. I am trading this method live without taking into consideration correlation between pairs, that is something I will add in later to improve the hit rate. For now I want to see how this simple method works over one hundred trades or so. Then I will have something to tweek. But as it stands, this is a profitable strategy so far. On another note, something that I do take into consideration on a trade using the HMA, is the angle at which it changes direction. The more acute the angle the more confident I am in the trade. Sometimes when a c-brick is painted the angle will be very weak, I usually skip these trades. I still need to do some research on how this HMA works as it is the detonator in my plan. But I will keep you apprised to my live trading and how this plays out. Hope this helps.

DarkDays - The Hull Moving Average was developed by Alan Hull in the UK. The HMA employs weighted moving averages and dampens the smoothing effect (and resulting lag) by using the square root of the period instead of the actual period itself: waverage(2*waverage(close,period/2)-waverage(close,period), SquareRoot(Period) Joe SDF

How do you place SL for this system?

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Hi Chris, looks good so far. May i ask what did you change in your indicator ? All the best, Tex

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Thank you!

--- 帖子 #195 ---
It is discretionary, but the system is based off of a bad R:R and high hit rate. Just as an example I use a 9 pip TP with an 18 pip SL.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
I will be interested to see the outcome, particularly on the single brick reversals. Good luck with it.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
OK boys and girls here is my minor contribution to this thread. When You see a Renko reversal brick there is no way of knowing if it is going to reverse for 1-brick or 2-bricks or many more. So here is my entry technique when I'm fishing for larger moves while trying to not get killed by the whipsaws. This example is for an up move reversing to a down move: As I watch the 1st reversal brick forming I place a Pending Sell Stop Order at the projected brick Close price with a 10 pip + spread SL. If the next or 2nd brick continues in the reversal direction I move the SL to breakeven. If the 3rd brick continues in the reversal direction I change to a different Exit strategy. Here are the possible outcomes: If the 1st reversal brick is reversed you will be stopped out at a loss of 10+ pips. If the 2nd brick is reversed you will be stopped out at breakeven. At the Close of the 3rd brick change to some other Exit strategy of your own choosing and try to ride the move as far as possible. In real trading I experience few 10+ pip losses and a few more breakeven trades but this is a price I am willing to pay as I go fishing for the larger price moves. BTW I'm not scalping for 5 or 10 pips and I only trade the London/NY overlap. Good fishing, Joe SDF

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Thanks Mate - we look forward to hearing (seeing) further results on your strategy. Certainly cleans up the chart! Regards Karl

I have no problem with amalgamation or just dropping this thread and letting the Variations one continue. The objective was to provide a home for those who just want to scalp (as we believed was the original plan with Nitro) and those who want to try other variations .. like taking more profit, re-entries, etc. However keeping people in FF organized this way is like trying to corral cats. Note Joe SDF's post above, he is going for larger profit so should really be posting in the other thread. I will put it as a vote .. if the majority want to drop this thread, I have no problem with it. I will see if I can figure out how to set up a poll ...

--- 帖子 #201 ---
I don't know either .. but I suspect soon you will! Then you can retire to the beach in style :-)))

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Go on. One thread is enough, two is confusing and redundant

--- 帖子 #203 ---
4XStar. I would be sorry indeed to see this thread amalgamated into one of the others. I'm too old to be playing with trains, I gave up trading with pivots when I discovered that the price will bounce off a pivot, apart from the times it doesn't. I have been trading the Renko bars for a couple of weeks and simply using the momentum, correlation and PA we are doing fine thank you very much. The more people who concentrate on fine-tuning this method the better and I can guarantee if we were to move over to another thread we would be bombarded with the usual, R:R is no good, why don't we use 7 different MA's, litter the charts with pending orders to capture a 100 pips per trade, etc., etc. A few of us have, in the short time we have been doing this, become to recognise the PA action and to profit by it. I do not need the distraction of MTF, multiple Pivot lines etc. If Chris manages to tune his latest efforts to give only a 90% hit rate that would be perfect. I would certainly use it in conjunction with my present trading method. Lets continue with this thread as it is a nice place to come home to everyday, to find out what the neighbours are doing and to offer a helping hand where possible. Regards Dave W

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Agreed, except that asdf's coments on PA movement are in the other thread (should be in this one) and people are double posting replies (which is probably against FF rules) and everything is becoming mixed up and redundant

--- 帖子 #205 ---
I agree. You just like the smell of the fresh cookies I keep baking in the oven...

--- 帖子 #206 ---
I've asked asdf to post his PA focused comments here as well. I don't think FF cares how many of the same posts you make on threads as long as you are not spamming and only using one name. We'll see how the votes go but if enough people like it here, we will stay. I am guessing the other thread may grow much bigger and have dozens or even hundreds of people, we may only have 20-30 or so who want to keep focus, but that is enough. I'm going to amend my first post a bit to better explain to newcomers about the two threads.

Chris, keep us updated pal I also work on an EA... Less trade opportunity, but higher hit rate. Let's see how will it work. Good luck &amp; take care, GrZack

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Chris, I am sure you probably already know this, but if your indi does not reference a negative number in any index buffer shift field, it does not repaint when the bar has closed. Repainting happens by using a negative number in the shift field, thus indexing a future date that exists on the left side of the chart, but does not exist on the right side of the chart in a real time scenario.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Hi Smjones, I used to think that this was true, but after seeing the Fisher Transform repaint - when I can't see any negative numbers used for a shift field in index buffers, I changed my mind. Now I distrust any indicatore which processes backwards in time e.g. for(int i=0; i&lt;limit; i++) I put them on a 1 min chart , then put them on again say 60 minutes later and see if the one calculated in real time matches the one just added. If not then it is useless for visual backtesting. Perhaps I am being paranoid, Ian PS I have just been comparing smFisherTransform3nr (which repaints!) with Solar wind clean XXX (by Mladen which does not) and realised that all versions based upon the Yura Prokofiev code process ExtBuffer0[i] backwards in a loop and use both Value1=Value; Fish1=ExtBuffer0[i]; in calculating the next (older) ExtBuffer0[i] which is effectively ExtBuffer0[i+1]. Unfortunately Solar wind clean XXX is (predictably) nowhere near as accurate in hindsight.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
4xStar, Mate, thanks for taking the time to start this new thread which has, as desired, become a follow on for those from the old place to concentrate on the final few steps. I strongly feel that if we were to combine the two this method here would be destroyed and lost in the pit of indi's. They are on to some good things in the other thread but are motivated differently. The people here either understand or are open to try out the RR and Win/Loss stuff and the +5 pips levels. As im sure you know this is something that is very difficult to come to terms with at first. I have been SOOO busy with family and work in the last week so have not been about and been as supportive of this thread and in helping with the progression. I will try harder, promise. It is great to see some of the old group as well as commited new comers to this thread that really appear to have grasped the mechanics and are working on the mental side of things. If all we have is 20 core followers then that would be great. I strongly believe that the work is done and we are there. As DarkDays has descovered the basics are working, the other bits are to move us towards the 90/95% hit rate. We have 4 charts at certain time frames where pa tends to behave the same way. We have a set up that tells us when to pay attention and we have momentum that tells us that accross the 4 pairs the price is likely to keep going in the given direction. As we all have been saying from the begining is that when all we are aiming for is 5 pips then we should be in and out in no time at all. I do believe there is scope for some sort of leveled profit taking, 1/2 at 5. 1/4 at 10 and 1/4 with a 10 trailing stop etc. Not sure if this is the last ditch effort of my inner self to drag me back to the old ways or not. It would at least address the concerns of some. However, i will look into this when i trade at the +5 level and report back at some point. I think the most important thing to do now is for the people that are here and are trading THIS system as it is within their own trading styles to post up some results over the next few weeks. As we know this is the ONLY way we are going to be able to see the validity of this thing. Some have already experienced some winning streaks, i would love it if we all could. Cheers guys, lets keep up the good work. Oh, and thanks Chris B for the continued effort, as with everyone, am very eager to see where it goes. Thanks Waddij

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Yeah, I as just thinking the exact same thing! The level of inteligence here shocks me sometimes !! Thanks guys

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Hi 4xStar, I am nuetral to the idea of combining the two threads as there are pro's and con's both ways. I like the freedom of moving forward and taking Nitro to the next level and I have seen good ideas on both threads which point in that direction. I don't like the idea of maintaining the original rules of Nitro as even they morphed over time from when Nitro was originally previewed. We have committed people on both threads who are passionate about the success of this strategy and it seems the only advantage might be the convenience of tracking one thread instead of two. Here's a thought - PM all the posters of both threads and have the vote yea or nay, then post the results and make a decision. Thank you for your diligence in maintaining this thread as I know it is a thankless job.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
The fisher transform formula is back propagation, by it's nature. the negative is built into the formula There is more to negative shift than just the shift. If the formula has it built in, it will go back and re-evaluate from past data. A good example of this is the Fractal indicator, and that is how it is designed and should be.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
I'm with keeping it focused. Nitro, simple clean charts with no other pivot or fib guess work. I however also believe that after the five pips is reached and locked in, a script is benifical to trail a remaining partial order, as the hard work of entering the market has already been acheived, what follows should be a simple bonus, if any. Regards, Damo.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
IAN, Can you post the Solar wind clean XXX indicator? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
I guess having been party to the request to amalgamate the threads, I should continue to push in that direction. Unfortunately, there are pros and cons which make the issue clouded. I like the idea of focusing on the pure Nitro and just trying to improve the hit rate but on the other hand I am certainly not averse to some new thinking which may result in the other thread - eg the recent posts suggesting C4 and Renko be combined to provide high prob entries. When I cast my vote, it was after some hard thinking. The convenience of having one thread won out - by a whisker! On the other hand the prospect of many red herrings being cast into the water and eventually contaminating our pure stream is worrying. Probably a small dedicated group with a single minded focus can achieve our goal without the introduction of back-biting and sniping which eventually seems to befall most threads in public forums. I am in awe of the skills and ability of many of the contributors to this and other threads and I believe the reference earlier was in the same complimentary tone and certainly not meant to be sarcastic. We are so fortunate in this regard to be tapping into the golden lode of talent and experience from which we can all learn and I for one am so grateful to those people who freely give of their time and skill to help us less talented and far less experienced. Although I have traded many different markets over many years, I am new to FX and I have benefited immensely from this thread and its immediate predecessors so much in the past few short weeks. My fervent hope is that whether we amalgamate or stay as 2 separate threads, the effort to close in on the 'grail' is maintained to the benefit of us all. I will await the outcome of the vote with interest. Best regards Karl

I have voted to keep the threads separate. As I continue to apply the principles taught in the previous thread, I find that following price action is becoming easier and I am relying less and less on the indicators. There are some very intelligent people on this thread with the right idea and I think we are moving in a direction that can make us successful as traders........LESS IS MORE.......

--- 帖子 #220 ---
I have also voted to keep the threads separate. I will stop double posting my results on the other thread. I am finding that less is more. it is about the PA and it gets easier every day. With the help of all the people dedicated to fine tuning this methodology we are still moving forward as a group. Thanks to all those who contribute. I prefer to not have to wade through all the new indy ideas,etc. I will, of course, read the other thread from time to time. But, it tends to throw me off track on trading this method when I read other Ideas. Just my thoughts

--- 帖子 #221 ---
I've read the comments above and appreciate all input. smjones, I am sure waddij's comments were meant to be highly complimentary .. we are all appreciative of the expertise people of greater experience are willing to share! As of this moment we have 16 votes for this remaining a separate thread. My own thought was, a minimum of 20 people and we keep it going .. I think we will get more than that and we already have some really good traders who are in favor of keeping this separate. I think the double posts will gradually cease. The other thread should grow much larger as it is open to all ideas, in here we will probably remain a small but committed group of traders who are just seeking to further perfect something that appears to be working very very well already. I think in the end the value of having a quieter place to meet &amp; keep focus will outweigh the inconvenience of having to check another thread for the occasional post that is relevant here as well. Tokyo is open .. another week begins! Good trading to all!

Sorry guys!! As I thought my new indy is totally useless.. Real time is always another thing...it repaints the previous brick...so if the brick closes in the right direction the arrow stay there, if the brick closes in the wrong direction the arrow disappear... As I said...when I see a 100% profitability I doubt it can be a reality...too good to be true.. Forget about it..

First trade of the week, 5 easy pips in 5'

And here's the re-entry after the little retracement..

--- 帖子 #226 ---
And one more after a retracement...this one took barely a few seconds... Enough for now, momentum is decelerating

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Here's another opportunity...not taken but 3 bricks formed in less then a minute...

Here is the screen grab from Tokyo opening. Have left on the Momentum indicators just for reference. Easy.

Chris B, I don't know why my chart is very different from yours. Does it make that much of a difference that I am on a 4 digit broker and you are on 5 digits? Here is my chart and your chart that you posted earlier. Thanks

--- 帖子 #230 ---
When I see an arrow forming, I set a stop, buy or sell, in the direction of the arrow, take care to allow for the spread, this means I will enter the trade only if the brick completes in the right direction. My 2cents worth.

Hi. Today I wanted to start to test this system. Since they are offline charts my chart is not updating and showing what has happened. is it supposed to be like that? Am I missing something?

--- 帖子 #232 ---
You must keep the m1 chart that generated the Offline chart open as well as the offline chart, because the M1 chart feeds data to the Offline chart. You can minimize the M1 chart though.

Oh.. Thanks

I have just caught up with the 'sister' thread and I am appalled that the same sleuths who put our former leader to the sword are at it again. ASDF has posted a few very interesting posts but his literary style is reminiscent of our fallen intrepid leader so is apparently immediately fair game. I would like to change my vote and keep this thread going until/unless the same over-zealous investigators get into some of our group. Look out guys and gals! They're coming to get you so don't be long winded or post anything of interest. It appears that no-one can be trusted - come to think of it - can I be trusted? I can assure you that I am not Edge- Reincarnate. Beware 4xTrader2!! All humour aside, could I strongly suggest that you jump on anything that is not welcome here. We do not want/need back stabbing nastiness but genuine efforts to contribute to the development of our trading skills and the well being of our trading efforts. Karl (aka scartree).

Hi. I took a trade on AY and lost. Did I do everything right?

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Chris - I also got that GJ trade which I followed with one on the AJ both +5 trades. All of the JPY pairs were in a great down trend for some time and pips were there for the taking. I like your retracement trade but I am too nervous to do that. It appears that the opening of the Asian session is a pretty good trading period. It suits me as it is mid morning here in Australia.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Trader100 - if you hold the mouse over the trade in the Terminal and drop it on the chart before you post it, we can see where your trade was. I can't see why you lost if your TP was 5 pips and you took the trade at the beginning of the 2nd brick after the signal.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
You are late for the party. If anything I would have tried for the second brick right after signal. But your at the bottom of a pretty major move...not a good place to short until after a decent pull back. You are also playing the Trix zero bounce and it looks like Trix divergence too. Q

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Missed Frankfurt. London for +7 pips

I really don't know... Maybe the 4/5 digits make this difference, it seems that your platform missed some data... Or the different data feeds still make these differences... I use the platform on 2 different pc, with 2 different demo accounts but the same broker...and i see the same picture..

Probable trend inversion?? Watching the chart...today we could have a trend inversion... there's a W pattern at the bottom of the trend...and a higher high...if the PA breaks the short trendline...the price can accelerate... Just a possibility...technical analysis is not a perfect science..

Here's the break of the trend line and of the resistence...and the price acceleration... high probability trade...i was waiting...and i was there!!

Chris, Nice trading. Just curious about your spread on GJ? I think the spread I have is normally 8 pips. No way I could scalp that pair. Keep up the good work. Doc

my trade for today waited for correlation and boom +5 Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Arrived late to the trading desk this morning due to some other things going on .. looks like a spectacular down move on the yen crosses which I see several profited from. Now they are consolidating and I am waiting either a significant pullback or reversal of trend confirmation so I can pull the trigger too. I love Correlation!

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Nothing so far, market is consolidating on most pairs... I expected a pullback of AUDJPY, but no

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Just to clarify what I mean by 'focus' in here. I know that most of us are not against finding new &amp; better ways to trade Nitro.. that would be absurd. What we want to avoid is people bringing in new and UNTESTED ideas or indys. Anyone who has been trading Nitro for over 100 trades with a new indicator &amp; seen better success, of course we want to know about it. Ditto for anyone who has found a tried &amp; tested way to take a bit more profit or tighten SL. By 'focus' I mean focus on what works . That means either the original method, which we know works (just requires a lot of practice to learn) OR improvements to the method which have been thoroughly tested in a demo acccount with a printed track record of trades. Since most of us started trading Nitro in early August, I would not expect any enhancements to the method to be offered before October, that is after at least 2 months of testing. If you find something that makes this even better .. and can prove it .. by all means, let us know. And Chris_B, keep working on that indy .. sooner or later you're going to nail it** &amp; when that happens, please remember who your early friends were. **farlo perfetto

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Nice work Chris, i just observed that in your last few charts you are not doing NITRO as originally conceived but instead you are using support and resistance to trade as shown by ASDF. Nothing wrong with that though. Like the idea of using such basic technical analysis tools with renko bars. My question is this: As you take these trades are you still looking for correlation or you simply concentrate in an individual pair and trade it based on the breakout of support/resistance when the momentum takes off? Thanks in advance for your response. Regards

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Hi... to be honest...i'm just trying...but today the original Nitro way would have been much better than support &amp; resistence... I'm having the poorest, most indisciplinated and big losing day from when i started with Nitro... I'm not focused on the method, i'm trying some other things and this is evolving in a big lose today... And you know...when you lose you feel bad, you are less focused, you search for revenge..and you lose again... At the same time i'm doing some trade with the old C4...and trying C4 also on the TOS platform...too musch confusion today in my mind..

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Ahahhahaha so ... you're not interested about my results? (I'm tesing a new indi, with a custom created EA) 100 trades later, I'll be here.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
One thing I noticed today is that Price Action SUCKS! So part of it may be trying to "force" trades that you wouldn't normally take or trying something that you normally don't do. For myself, I usually don't trade the CADJPY and took 3 trades on it today with two losing. So often times sticking to what works and perfecting it is better than trying something new. An alternative is make your real trades on one account and have a second one for your experiments. If you notice today the price is hovering around the whole numbers EJ ~133, GJ ~ 151, AJ ~78 CADJ ~84.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Take a break Chris, The PA is crazy today.. remember it's a patience game I've had 2 winnings on the asian open and that's enough for the day

analda I had the same question a few posts ago, u may find it useful: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...93#post2999593

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Price action as a whole sucks today. EJ provided good trades. I normally don't trade CADJPY but felt the pattern indicated an impending uptrend (highlighted rectangle). However it was delayed and cost me two losing trades. Am done for the day as Price is going nowhere right now.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
I'm your friend too

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Agree, there is no clear direction, however I managed to get a long on the GY that I'm about to cash in. My only trade today so far.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Nice work. Knowing when not to trade is one of the most important skills in this game. "After spending many years in Wall Street and after making and losing millions of dollars I want to tell you this: It never was my thinking that made the big money for me. It always was my sitting. Got that? My sitting tight! It is no trick at all to be right on the market. You always find lots of early bulls in bull markets and early bears in bear markets. I’ve known many men who were right at exactly the right time, and began buying or selling stocks when prices were at the very level which should show the greatest profit. And their experience invariably matched mine that is, they made no real money out of it. Men who can both be right and sit tight are uncommon. I found it one of the hardest things to learn." Jesse Livermore

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Chris, you have been one of the people i have read and studied charts from the old thread. It seem to me that you were on a roll with the NITRO method.. you know second reversal bar, correlation, price action and boom +5 pips. It might be a good idea to continue using something that was working before. It might be one of those days that you are just better off not trading at all. It might be a good time to read or re-read some chapters of trading in the zone, to help you deal with a bad trading day. Best Regards and keep that chin up. JC

--- 帖子 #264 ---
I will post this in both the thread because i think it can be useful both for those who like Nitro variations and for those who like the original version but want to make better the R/R ratio. I was observing the chart with the renko wicks activated...i've noticed something interesting. On EURJPY most of the times when a reversal brick occours...the price retraces before going in the right direction...and retraces often about 10 pips. On GBPJPY the situation is different, when there is a good reversal...the most of the times the price doesn't retrace and goes in the right direction pretty quickly...due to the major volatility. So...an idea can be: On EURJPY: - Don't take the trade if it doesn't retrace - Enter the trade if the price retraces about 10 pips with a TP of 10 pips and a SL of 11 pips + spread On GBPJPY: - Take always the trade (because if the signal is good the price doesn't retraces too much) with a TP of 5 pips and a SL of 11 pips + spread This is just an idea...i don't know how it can do in real trade...i'm sure the hit rate is a little bit lower...but the R/R ratio can be surely better.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
EY, I entered on breakout after PA moved past previous high, 5pips. Correlation + momentum is long on all 4 pairs

--- 帖子 #266 ---
ianf0ster and smJones, I apologies if the above was taken the wrong way, i was in no way sarcastic, fully sincere. Sorry if it came out the wrong way.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Hey Chris I have been messing with the wicks too, but your post made me have one of those hmmm moments. Actually on E/J there is a pattern that occurs quite frequently besides what you have discovered. If the second brick has a very tiny. or better yet. zero retrace wick it almost always makes a 3rd brick. The ONLY time this does not stand true is during congestion. Check it out. Q

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Sounds interesting. It'd be cool to have more data

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Yes...that's true...the same heppens on G/Y... So...are you suggesting to open the trade...and if it retraces...exit the trade with a very small SL??

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Posibly best discussed in the other thread?

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Here is what I am looking for on my Nitro set ups besides correlation and the other rules. The first set up is what most of us are doing I think. Break of MA, Trix and Momentum confirmation and correlation. Reversal brick closes, 2nd brick (forming brick) pulls back 5-10 pips and enter. Wait for the pull back! Don't jump in right after brick forms. If there is no retrace use set up #2 Set up number 2 is when there is no 2nd brick retrace (no wick). This looks like a very consistent set up if we can figure how to trade it. Usually there is a 3rd brick formed when this happens. For a brick to have zero retrace (no wick) it must have some decent momentum in it. You must be focused and quick for this one. My idea, all of the Nitro rules have to be met as well, is set a buy/sell stop on the last pip (#10 on 10 tick bricks) of the forming 2nd brick. TP with all 10 pips of 3rd brick. Keep in mind any time the 2nd brick retraces and starts forming a wick, you need to cancel your order and go back to set up #1. So far looks very promising visually back testing on my live platform.

Another one on EY after reversal, correlated. Just before news. I didn't use a TP on this one, came out on candle/mom reversal

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Noticed that strong V-top reversal in on your gbpjpy chart and had to see what would cause such a strong move away. Great example of a channel. Connect points 1 and 3, draw the parallel line starting at point 2, and then look for a reversal formation at 4. Unfortunately, there was no pullback on your chart and only a slight one on mine. Tough to catch a move like that.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
NY open for +7pips

--- 帖子 #280 ---
asdf, What size renko brick are you using? It looks prrtty small on your chart, is it 1 pip?

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Interesting, I'm learning every day. So there was a +200 pips V-top reversal in the direction of the channel. Pity I didn't catch it earlier... Actually I see GY has been in a down trend since Aug 7th ian: those are the normal renko blocks super compressed so you can see the channel direction.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Oops, should have looked at the time scale

--- 帖子 #283 ---
After yesterday's lousy price action and today price action being poor up until news, I found myself "forcing" trades instead of watching the signals. Thus, an otherwise profitable day was a break even. Once I settled down and traded the signals and the price action, I did OK but as you can see I made one EJ trade that killed my profit for the day (didn't set a stop loss). Discipline, discipline, discipline! Without it profits are like the wind.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Some say it's impossible to know if you'll get a big move or not. Can you know with certainty? Absolutely not, nothing is certain in the markets. Can you know with a high degree of probability? I think that gbpjpy chart speaks for itself. That is my trade philosophy: use a scalper's stop to catch a swinger's profits.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Not only is it impossible to gauge the size of the move, it is also not possible to predict direction. So the answer is to trade what you see. To sneak into the banquet and steal a few crumbs off the table. To jump on and off the tiger's back before he notices. The Nitro set up shows price action and pair correlation in a very clear way. I hope this thread doesn't degenerate into a search for more indis. Already, discussion about chart patterns and S/R levels is drifting away from pure PA. This is scalping not swing or position trading.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Here's the eurjpy. That solid-line channel was drawn with MT4's equidistant channel tool. Very useful. Now I don't have to eyeball the "parallelness."

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Renko brick patterns are pure PA and the patterns repeat infinitely. When you can identify these patterns quickly, it takes Nitro to a whole different level! Q

--- 帖子 #288 ---
If it is impossible to gauge the size of a move, then why set a 5-pip target? By setting a hard target, you are in effect gauging the size of a move. You are essentially saying that if X happens (whatever X may be), then the market will make a move of at least 5 pips. That, by definition, is gauging the size of a move. If it is not possible to predict direction, why would you even enter OR exit the market? An entry or exit setup, regardless of whether it comes from S/R or trix crossovers or watching 4 pairs moving simultaneously, is a prediction about the market's direction. If you buy because you see all four pairs moving up, that, by definition, is predicting direction. My trading principles are no different than yours. I make predictions about market direction and I gauge the strength of moves. And after doing so, I enter and exit accordingly. As for pure price action, it is S/R. Not S/R that comes from calculated formulas, but high and lows. I posted here because some suggested they were welcome here. If they are not, please let me know and I will stop.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
I think your posts are extremely helpful. have been following them on the other thread.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
No it is not. A prediction happens before the event. If you buy because price is moving up, you already know in which direction price is moving. You are just hitching a ride on a trend that is already in play. What you can say about any S/R level or fib level or pivot point is that they are always right. Price will either bounce off it or go through it. Comforting eh? I'm just trying to make the point that price itself is the key indicator in scalping. Why set a target? Trading is a game of probability is it not?

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Assuming you don't wait for a pullback, when you buy as price is moving up, you are effectively at the "top" of the market's immediate move, even if only for an instant. Assuming you don't wait for a popup, if you sell as price is moving down, you are at the bottom of the market's immediate move, even if only for an instant. You are then hoping that price will continue to move in your favor. You are making a prediction about direction. To suggest otherwise means that (1) you can buy in an uptrend at a price cheaper than the going market rate and get filled (again, assuming you're not waiting for a pullback), which is highly improbable, and (2) you would never be stopped out because, as you state, "you already KNOW in which direction price is moving," which is also highly improbable. If you have been stopped out, it is because your prediction about the market's direction was wrong. Trading in general is nothing more than making a prediction about market direction, whether you want to see it as such or not, regardless of whether you are a scalper, swing trader, or position trader. As for probabilities, I agree 100%. This is just a game of probabilities. Doesn't eliminate the fact that setting a hard target and hard stop is gauging the strength of a move. As for S/R, whether price bounces off it or goes through it, both provide extremely valuable pieces of information to use in further predicting the market's direction.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Some share what works for them, some critizize and oppose those who share. Normal forum dynamics. Keep it coming. I'm learning a lot.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
None of your analysis would be out of place if applied to the swing trading I do on one hour charts. I won't even enter a trade if I don't get a specific retracement based on a fib level. Your analysis is very sound. However I don't think scalping for a few pips lends itself to this kind of analysis. You don't even have time to think when price is moving fast. It's down to experience and screen time. I would urge nitro traders to concentrate on the magic moments when there is a brick reversal on the traded pair, together with strong price momentum. This alone is not enough. You wait for the moment when all pairs suddenly dance together in correlation. It's easily missed and doesn't happen often. So strictly observe a one hour window of trading at either London or NY opening. Get one or two trades and stop for the day. Limit your exposure to the market. This is scalping.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
A completely useless remark.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
However I'm finding that BOTH approaches are useful and are DEFINITELY improving my scalping... BOTH PA analysis and 'those magic moments'.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
I guess we'll agree to disagree. I definitely agree that the "magic moment" is key to this system. The purpose of my posts is to hopefully show that, even if you're scalping , some setups are higher probability than others. It doesn't matter how fast the pairs are moving or how magic the moment, if you buy into an area where there is an overwhelming number of sellers, there is a high probability of taking a loss. And vice versa for selling. I can tell you I have bought at the top of a move and sold at the bottom of a move, thinking the magic moment was there, only to take a loss. The other nitro thread has a chart illustrated with examples of someone who bought into resistance and sold into support, and both were losses. My purpose in posting is to hopefully show that you can know with a certain degree of probability where these areas may be. Some will say there is no way to know whether a trade would fail or succeed. And I agree if you're talking in absolutes. There is no 100% certainty on any one trade. I think we all accept that. However, I don't see the benefit of making absolute assertions when referring to a venture that is based on probabilities. To say that you can't know with certainty which direction the market will move is useless because the trader has already accepted that (and hopefully his/her money management reflects this lack of certainty). A more useful approach would be to look at each trade in terms of probabilities. With that in mind, nitro's exit strategy is based on an absolute: the idea that you want to limit exposure to the market because you can never know, etc., so the target was set at 5 pips. However, whether the 5-pip target is met or not is based on probabilities. Because the exit arguably has the greatest impact on a trader's overall profitability, I hope to offer a different perspective as to whether a random pip target based on an absolute trading principle makes mathematical sense when overall success or failure is based on managing probabilities. In other words, if this is a game of probabilities, should it be any different for the exit? If you enter the market in an area that has a certain probability of moving 5 pips, and only a slightly lower probability of moving 50 pips, does taking the 5 pips make mathematical sense? Here are some potential exit strategies that may be more in line with probabilities: (1) a change in the color of the trix candle bars, (2) a three block reversal going the other way, (3) price action getting to the point where it can no longer turn support into resistance or resistance into support, or (4) the reason for entering the trade in the first place no longer exists, or more specifically, the momentum that put you into the trade has subsided. Many can consistently spot the magic moment and the 5-pip target simply works. That's great. For others, it may not be working (as evidenced in the other thread). I hope this may offer some potential for improvement.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
That does actually make some sense. We are entering a trade with the probability that it is going to go 5 pips. What is the probability that it will go more. I believe there was a study posted in the original c4 thread with those actual numbers. If it moves X pips what is the probability that it will move 10 more. 20 more . etc. I will see if I can find it. 5 pips is working well for me, so far. But i can always use more pips if it isn't giving me much more exposure.

--- 帖子 #298 ---

Looks like you guys are making great progress. Due to lack of time to devote to screen time, I'm trading some session breakout methods instead. But I'll be watching all the c4/nitro/renko guys. I hope you all achieve your goals, whatever they may be. And if I can help any of you just let me know.

Here's more price action on the GJ. Some have asked about reliable setups. I highlighted my favorite in yellow (two actually of different sizes--one on the larger fractal and one on the smaller). These setups are everywhere, are good probability setups, and offer good R:R. S to R, R to S. I also noted the confluence in the cyan circle. The idea behind confluence is that there are traders of all variety. S/R traders. TL/Channel traders. Fib traders. Pattern traders. Momentum traders. Breakout traders. Pivot traders. And on and on. The more groups that are interested in the area, the greater the probability of a successful trade. This had at least three groups looking at the same spot. Very high probability, very good R:R. (Note: third trendline touches are good probability plays, beyond that the probability decreases with each subsequent trendline touch.) The magenta circle shows how price will often use trendlines in much the same way as support and resistance. Once price breaks through a trendline, it will often retrace, touch the trendline from the other side before moving in the opposite direction. Again support to resistance, resistance to support, even with trendlines. This is price action.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Interesting. But 3-10 pips? You have to win in about 85 % of deals to make money.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
More price action on the AJ. Good example of large and small triangles, pennants, flags, coils, whatever you want to call them. They are identified by higher lows and lower highs and indicate price is indecisive. Once price picks a direction it usually makes a good move. If the move is with the trend, they are pretty reliable, if the move is against the trend, use caution and be ready to jump out.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Good grief. Somebody please bring back Edge. Whatever he did or didn't do, he was at least focussed. This thread no longer merits the title, Nitro scalping for serious traders. What are you doing asdf? Are you an analyst or a trader. You are writing a very nice textbook on TA. We all have these books. But where are your Nitro trades? I haven't see one of your trades. You are confusing everyone. In a previous post you stated: Many can consistently spot the magic moment and the 5-pip target simply works. That's great. For others, it may not be working (as evidenced in the other thread). I hope this may offer some potential for improvement. If that's the case, these traders who don't get it have not yet succeeded and need more screen time and more practice. What they don't need is your over analysis which as we all know leads to paralysis. Scalping is a skill which takes time to develop. It is clear that you are more comfortable with a vast array of predictive tools. Unfortunately these get in the way of the technique of scalping. I don't think you understand that. This is my last post. I have the tools I need. I sincerely hope those who have a passion to succeed with scalping continue to persevere. If Nitro is not falling into place quite so easily, I would suggest more time with C4, which works extremely well.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Thanks again asdf. It's cool to see PA explained on the same charts I'm currently trading on

I disagree slush .. I think asdf's commentary is taking us to the next level with Nitro. He is not introducing new indicators .. he is point out patterns on renko charts that may be even more predictive than those on candle charts. Most of us are used to working with renko now so we are ready to move to the next level in spotting PA . He's just showing us more ways to spot or confirm PA on renko charts. Glad you have the tools you need to trade successfully .. good trading!

Agree, I saved both charts to my desktop so I can have them handy for study. Excellent analysis.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
By the way, to settle this issue, Edgetrader himself confirmed that the explanations delivered by asdf on this and the other thread, targeted to "have a working understanding of price action" represented a next step in Nitro trading (what he, in his usual extremist manner, termed 'Chernobyl'): http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=3000118

Q

--- 帖子 #323 ---
I don't trade nitro, I think that is clear from my posts. And I have already said that if this is a distraction, or if my posts are a distraction, please let me know and I will stop. As for your assertions, those who are serious traders know how to analyze. Are you implying that the two are mutually exclusive? That you are either an analyst or a trader, but not both? (We're talking retail traders, not divisions of Citigroup or Goldman Sachs.) What I'm showing are the very basics, take no more than 5 minutes to put on a chart, and can even help scalpers. You make reference to scalping (in more than one post) as if it is a trading method unaffected by market forces and immune to fundamental market principles. Trading is trading, regardless of the method. And scalping is speculating, however difficult it may be for you to admit. Serious scalpers plan their trades and trade their plans, pardon the colloquialism. Serious scalpers are very aware of where they are on the trading map, of where the areas of high interest are, of where the market may move next, and when they should jump in and when they should sit out. I don't think you understand that. If you have all the books, then please, offer something of value to the thread--something other than "these traders who don't get it have not yet succeeded and need more screen time and more practice." The benefits of screen time and practice can be greatly enhanced by someone who can provide examples of what a trader should be looking for. Learning to trade can be frustrating, discouraging, or even depressing. Been there, done that, never want to do it again.

This post is in the style of DaveW and I think just shows the power of correlation---unfortunate about the lower low on the GBY chart. Also while I use the 1 min chart to power the bricks its not bad to confirm entries on it using scalper candles and a xma indi which I'm trialing for exits

Some of us don't like wading through 100s of pages of threads that could be much shorter without posts like this . No offense meant, just wanted to point this out so other readers don't start posting unrelated posts or questions. I'm sure you're a great trader and I hope you'll contribute to the development of the NITRO methodology. Thanks for the great info everyone! ASDF, I really enjoy your technical analysis of renko charts.

If anyone knows how to contact twee, it would be nice to eliminate these asdf is edgetrader accusations. I tried pm'ing twee, but it didn't work. Twee, if you read this, would you mind verifying that I am not edgetrader and then make it public in some form. Would you also mind verifying that as of this morning I have disabled pm's and the ability to receive emails on my account, and if possible, will you make the changes permanent? Thanks for your help. asdf

--- 帖子 #346 ---
DaveW (or any others), When you post your charts, would you also mind posting the following: 1) Time the market opened 2) Time of entry 3) Time of exit 4) How much price went against you before reaching your target 5) How much price went beyond your exit before a pullback/popup (this may be difficult to define) You have a good understanding of this system. These details may help give an idea of the dynamics of a successful trade: approximately how long after market open do successful trades take place, approximately how long it takes for a successful trade to play out, and what is a reasonable drawdown expectancy. Number 5 could be useful in optimizing exits and comparing the different market opens (e.g. if you consistently just hit your target at one market open, but consistently see 10 pip runs beyond your target in another market open, it may make sense to have different targets for different opens, or allow for a runner in one, etc.). Any other stats that may help? Also, have you taken a loss yet?

Pips Queak and others - please respect the fact that the thread starter left the other thread and started another one to escape all of this. I understand your position, and it would be best for all, yourself included, to follow the proper legal channels to rectify your situation. Let the learners learn, please!

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Would it be of any concern whatsoever to anyone here who is a supporter of asdf if he is, in fact, Edgetrader? What I'm asking is would that still be OK with you? If it is OK, that's one thing. If you don't want to know because if you found out that he really was it would make you uncomfortable having eagerly followed his posts is understandable too. If this man is not Edge, then Edge has a twin. There are way too many similarities to ignore, coupled with the fact that he just happens to arrive here after the demise of Edge, is a futures trader that just happens to be able to instruct people in the fine arts of forex trading on the premise that trading futures and forex is the same, writes identically to Edge, didn't show what state he was from or any other information on his Bio, and on and on. Just remember that if it looks like a duck, acts like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it really is a duck. If you want, you can wear blinders and pretend he really is not who everyone thinks he is, or you can hide your eyes, or you can just say it doesn't matter. The latter choice I think is very distasteful. PS. TRO wouldn't admit who he really was, either. He even had a supporter or two come on and accuse me of getting Edge and TRO banned (which isn't true). The supporter turned out to be using an alias, also, and has since been banned. If TRO was helping you in your trading, would you get mad if TRO was banned? Actually, there are a few people who followed that thread that ARE mad he was banned, and think I got him banned. TWEE apparently has many ways to find out who's who. It takes some time, but eventually imposters are found out.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Some people might enjoy the drama of the chase - the 'get Edge' saga. Others might find it amusing to follow the play. I personally find it boring and disruptive and wish that those with a vendetta take their grievances elsewhere so that those of us who want to learn can get on with it. I personally do not give a damn if asdf is Edge or Keith Brown or whoever. I have read asdf's posts to this and the other thread and they make a great deal of sense. This person obviously has a great deal of experience from whom I for one can learn. Anyone who tries to use the enthusiasm of the people on this or any other thread, for their own financial agenda will be weeded out by Twee and the administrators of the Forum. Please leave that job to them and let anyone who can offer a useful contribution to the thread be able to do so for our collective benefit without attracting the snide, bitter and spiteful comments from people who offer absolutely nothing to our quest for being better traders. If anyone is taken in by any other person conning them, then they deserve all they get for being stupid and lazy. Anyone letting someone else trade for them gets no sympathy from me. You have successfully detroyed C4 and are now working on wrecking both Nitro threads. I have had a gut full of your crap and am seriously contemplating not wasting my time following these threads and having to plough through the bs offered by Pipsqueak and his band of 'happy chappies' with great chips on their shoulders. Get a life people and leave us alone. In short, PISS OFF!!

Great commentary mandel, a good example of how to post a trade + commentary. Looks like you waited for a strong retrace after the double top, then bought the b/o of the top .. correct? I assume other yen crosses were also headed up at the same time? Can't argue with 12 pips in 10 minutes

Ok....back to Nitro...original plan... The only difference is the brick size for me... Watch my chart...it seems a surgical operation I know...Nitro is with 10ticks per brick But with 5ticks per brick it seems to be more accurate...and very similar to C4 (but with less noise). In fact i was not searching for 2 brick reversals...but for larger movements...watching the Lwma (setted at 10) and watching PA moving... and all this just a couple of minutes after the news times What do you think??

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Here's an update... I took a loss...I was right but now i like cut the losses when i feel something could go wrong... so took only -6 After a big short move...PA has reached a support...and then i was waiting for a reversal pattern in order to watch for longs... You can see a W pattern bottom before the big LONG You can see a 1-2-3 pattern bottom after the big SHORT Who is saying that the technical analysis is useless for scalping??? Another interesting thing: when the SHORT is losing power...you can see the slopes on momentum reducing (they are less larger every time)...it's not law...is only an alert... P.S. Is very difficult to see these formations with 10ticks bricks

--- 帖子 #363 ---
There was a big acceleration today 40' after NY open, I took 2 trades: AY, 10 pips at the end of the trend (I know it's too risky but I had to take it, it was moving so fast). The other one on EY after a reversal past the low line, I took 5 pips and left Both happened in just seconds. All the pairs were correlated.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Another little loss for -3 The trade reached +5 but my updatestop EA was too slow in closing order.. And then another +6

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Since your first post I put up 5 pip charts of GY and EY &amp; I agree patterns are easier to see, and stops can be kept tighter. However I am not sure this is where people should start with renko .. a few weeks ago I also tried the 5 bar charts and got slaughtered I still need to see the 'bigger picture' on the 10 bar especially double/triple tops or bottoms .. but then the 5 bar may be better to time entries and keep exits tighter. Will need to do more testing, but so far this morning, I am liking it.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Yes...the difference between 10ticks and 5ticks bricks is that with 5ticks the strategy is more similar to C4...you search for movements a little bit larger...and stops can be smaller... the most important thing is that you wait for PA to move...just like in C4... With 5ticks the Lwma is more reliable...you can wait a confirmed change of color as a primer... I know that original Nitro is with 10ticks...but we unfortunately don't have the original Nitro TS setup... Let's see next week if it does well.. good weekend.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Hi Chris. Good concept. Have set up a couple of charts and will give it the once over over the weekend. Thanks Dave W

--- 帖子 #368 ---
chris how are you filtering out some of the bad trades? maybe im missing something... http://www.forexfactory.com/attachme...2&amp;d=1252072367

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Hi Chad! As all scalping strategies the only way to be proficient is to understand and watch how the PA is moving...you will never find a scalping strategy with rules setted in stone... The basics of Nitro are in the PA...the Lwma give us an alert...it's telling "ehy...maybe the price is moving"...most of the time...if the price starts to move fast...it's a good trade (not always). When the price is slow and esitates...most of the times is a bad trade (not always). Only spending some time watching the chart during the prime time can give you a good "feel" of this. Anyway...watching the chart...a big UP move started..so i took 2 longs on the retracements...then i took a short and a long because the slope of the peaks at the top was good...then i watched only for shorts after the triple top...and then at the bottom i've watched for some long (the most trouble of the day). As you can see i took also some bad signal...but with that "feel" often you can understand when the PA is not doing what you want...so you can exit with small losses.. I prefer take some more -6 and some less -30... In the image you attached some trades are not plotted correctly because i had to restart my MT4...

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Chris, Your chart is an excellent example of how using price action alone is much more efficient and risk averse than using indicators. I provided a step-by-step analysis of how price actions plays out in real time. It may be helpful to print it, cover it with another piece of paper, and the read the commentary from left to right, as if you were watching the market. At each key area, you may want to ask, did the indicators help clarify what price action was saying? Did the indicators distract from what price action was saying? Also, have you noticed that all three of your indicators signal at the same renko bar -- the third bar after a reversal (maybe that was intentional). Does the potential for distraction outweigh the knowledge that seeing a third renko bar print after a reversal provides the same information? Or can you see it more clearly with price action alone? Hope it helps. asdf (As for the negative comments, there is nothing I can say that will deter them. Their minds are made up. So I will just wait for Twee to resolve it. One way to avoid deception is to question teachings that run contrary to generally accepted principles of an industry. Those who read these things, I hope you question what I write. Don't take my word for them, look around this forum, there are some very wise traders. One of the best is BillyRayValentine's "No Brainer Trades." It is filled with great info and free resources. There is a .pdf file called "BRV S+R Trading" at the bottom of the first post, with sections by BillyRayValentine and Iron-man, both of whom have 10+ vouches. Hopefully you see that the things I've shared are not unique and can benefit traders of all kinds, including scalpers.)

Thanks... now we have this thread to continue to evolve... and it is looking very promising. I am particularly impressed with observations/comments this past week with regards to spotting patterns, and maybe using 5 bar charts alongside the 10 bar ones. I still like the 10 bar for a 'bigger picture' look, but see great potential for limiting stop-losses using the 5 bar.

Scartree, There is no need to leave the thread. That punk Artov claimed I was a scammer on the thread that is in the bin.

asdf, I have decided that I was a little harsh in my criticism of your chart analysis. I have had good results in consistently capturing pips with the 3 elements of market timing, price momentum and correlation. However the concepts you have presented should be an essential part of anyone's trading, and you have presented it very well. So please carry on. I had an interesting week. I only trade the E/J. I thought I would try something different and decided to put the C4 setup alongside the nitro charts for E/J, G/J and A/J. I wanted to experiment with the ability of C4 to get earlier signals, but use the nitro charts to confirm trend and correlation. Sorry if this is getting away from pure nitro, but I did end the week with 9 consecutive wins. I'm a big fan of trendline breaks and only use trend lines which connect magnitude 3 swing points (otherwise known as fractals). If you are familiar with Tom Demark, you will know what I mean. As a general rule, if Trix and the scalper candles give a valid signal, (on C4) and provided you have good price momentum, and a candle has closed on the other side of a TD trend line break, together with being in the same direction as the prevailing trend, and there is pair correlation on nitro- then this is a very high probability setup on the opening of the next 5 minute candle. Do wait for retracement if price starts to run away. And of course, as asdf would agree with, make sure you are not about to hit an obvious S/R level. On that subject my general rule is this. If I am going long and I am below a previous and recent high, traditional TA would say, wait until you can confirm either a respect for or violation of the high. So it will either bounce down and form a double top, or it will punch through and confirm on the candle close. All I would say in scalping terms is that one shouldn't have hard and fast rules. If price is moving slowly with little energy up to the recent high, then I would tend to wait. I am assuming there is no imminent news announcement on the horizon. Obviously the market is hesitant and undecided. But if you can feel price really pumping, my experience tells me to take the trade before it reaches the high because I know in most cases it will go straight through. And if it's got that much upwards energy you can have a tighter stop, so even if it goes against you, you will sustain a small loss. I guess that was the real point I was trying to make before, that analysis is useful, but be prepared to modify it quickly if the situation changes or ignore it completely if the movement of price is telling you something else. I know asdf, you will say that these rules apply to all time frames, but I, as well as many other traders, believe that chart patterns and S/R levels are more robust on higher time frames than lower ones. So on a scalping timeframe I'm more attuned to price movement and momentum. I hope I have been constructive with my comments.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
No worries, Slush. Healthy debate is, in my opinion, a vital part of learning. There is nothing in your post that I disagree with. And you bring up many excellent points that haven't been mentioned. First and foremost, S/R (or anything for that matter) on larger fractals is more important than on smaller fractals. And second, and probably one of the most difficult things for a trader to learn, I highlighted in your post -- adaptability. It takes a lot of practice to get to that true "trade what you see" level where you have no bias and can switch from long to short or short to long as soon as price action dictates. That is something I still struggle with. By the way, great job on the nine straight wins. I would put you in that group with DaveW as ones who could offer some real insight as to how successful scalps play out: how fast are you in and out of the market, how much drawdown (if any) do you typically endure, and what signs do you look for that tell you to get out. You both are quite good at scalping. Thanks again for your contributions. (By the way, I've heard many great things about Demark, though I've never studied his teachings in depth. Maybe I'll bump him up to the top of my list.)

4x and crew, I have followed this group since the origination of Edge's C4 thread. There is so much value that I have recieved from the very beginning that all I have to say is how grateful I am to the people who have moved in a POSITIVE direction to make our trading the best it can be using this method. I have been working it from the start and I am very impressed with the direction this is going in terms of trading. Keep it coming guys!! I am looking forward to next week.

Hello Sir, Nice to see somebody with some experience in the futures markets on here However if I may provide my opinion in relation to your analysis. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Chart One - 5Pip Renko: As the chart Illustrates above, this is how I see it. There is no real "down trend" occuring, it's simply chop and then some news related mess. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Chart Two - 1Min Candles w/ 5Pip Renko overlaid: This is a copy of where your trendlines are placed on the Renko chart. I don't think these can be considered trendlines.. Look at the second one, it's not a trendline it's simply news time mess. They are no indication of anything occuring. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Chart Three - 5Pip Renko vs. 1Min Candles : This chart is the clearest illustration of what happened, sideways chop followed by news time noise, it literally means nothing. No way could you predict with any certainty whatsoever what was going to happen here. Trades should have been only considered after the green ractangle at the very least. Aside from this, there are obviously other MASSIVE problems that occur at times like these - When you are live you get slipped, get requoted, widened spread etc etc. Don't get me wrong, I think PA and SR are the only way this C4 or whatever will work and I have agreed with the majority of what you posted before, just looking for your opinion in relation to these points. Trade well, Jig

Your sig line is from one of my favorite poems .. and the lines I remember often while learning to trade forex these past months are these: If you can make one heap of all your winnings And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, And lose, and start again at your beginnings And never breath a word about your loss; It's probably worth it to show the whole poem for those unfamilar with it .. I think nearly everyone on this thread will find a couple of lines they relate to. IF by Rudyard Kipling If you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you; If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, But make allowance for their doubting too; If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies, Or, being hated, don't give way to hating, And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise; If you can dream - and not make dreams your master; If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim; If you can meet with triumph and disaster And treat those two imposters just the same; If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, Or watch the things you gave your life to broken, And stoop and build 'em up with wornout tools; If you can make one heap of all your winnings And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, And lose, and start again at your beginnings And never breath a word about your loss; If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew To serve your turn long after they are gone, And so hold on when there is nothing in you Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on"; If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, Or walk with kings - nor lose the common touch; If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you; If all men count with you, but none too much; If you can fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds' worth of distance run - Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, And - which is more - you'll be a Man my son!

I think the answer is simply that any kind of technical trading goes out the window during major news events such as NFP and interest rate announcements. That would be true for any trading methodology.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Jigsaw, Thanks for pointing that out. You're absolutely right. I was not following it real time and just assumed that if he made the trades that he made, then it must have been somewhat normal trading conditions. I was also looking at his chart as is. All that stuff goes out the window when trading the news -- that's just a "be quick or be dead" environment. Your analysis is great. If you have any good price action tips or charts, I would be very interested. Thanks again. asdf

Now although what is happening technically on a M1 chart during NFP is pretty meaningless, take a look at the H4 chart. This is where the Big Dogs are. The banks and institutions that have the power to move the markets. They have no interest in a 5 minute chart. We have an interesting confluence of events here. Although there was a big spike on the 4 hour candle during NFP, it still respected the first trendline. Now we have price above the 61.8 level and if it also breaks the second trendline, it is likely that price will continue up. A break of the 61.8 often signals continuation. However, price is now only about 30 pips away from a major supply trendline on the daily chart. As I said before technicals have greater validity on higher time frames. Does this all have an impact if I see a short signal on a M5 chart. Absolutely not. A microtrend of the H4 chart has no real bearing on trading at this level. A good general rule in multi time frame analysis is to disregard any time frame that is more than X4 - X6 time periods away. So if you are trading a M5 chart then 6 periods away is the M30 timeframe. To take trades on the M5 in line with the prevailing trend on the M30 is fine. Trading a M15 and H1 with a X4 time factor also works. But trading a M5 or M15 in the direction of a H4 makes no sense if you are scalping for a few pips. If the tide is slowly going out over a period of hours it doesn't stop you surfing the waves coming in.

Hi Jig and welcome to the thread... Your observations on live trading I think are right...my fear is that in live the executions are not so easy as in demo...that is the big problem (it can depend on what broker you use)... But what you say in the first image is opinable...you say that it was an "untradable" moment... In demo i've traded it...i've not watched trendlines or other...just following what PA was doing and observing the movement of PA...because all happened in about 5 minutes... ona 5M chart yes...it was very untradable but with renko it becomes tradable, and this is a great advantage of renko...but all depends from the broker and speed in executions ... Probably in the next weeks i will try with real money and micro lots...to see if there is a big difference with demo.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
So what are, in your opinion, the best sources to determine news times or periods? Is the FF calendar reliable enough?

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Hey there , Yes indeed it's a great poem. I don't know about putting all my forex winnings on a game of pitch and toss but other than that it's really good . You are correct, it's not a NITRO specific issue it's just a general technical analysis thing. No problems whatsoever I thought thats what happened. I might post some charts later alright. It is indeed, there are only two news items that I care about NFP Fridays and Interest Rate decision days. But then again it is all relative to timeframe also . . . But even 1HR or 4HR traders would want to be flat the market oround these times. Hey there, thanks for the welcome. I actually did not see your chart above his, I thought he was just presenting it as his own analysis, so I was in no shape or form criticising your trading whatsoever, it seems like I was when I read back the "flow of the thread" now but rest assured I was not in anyway I assume you are putting in market orders for your Nitro trades in your chart, the overall problem here is that the brokers are protecting themselves (Which they are fully entitled to do) . A lot of those prices that you got executed at on Demo - chances are that those prices never even existed. I have put in orders in times like this before and if you put in market orders your orders WILL be delayed and you WILL be re-quoted. Widened spreads are a pain in the butt as well, as a 5Min trader spreads are of serious concern to me, I don't want to pay any more spread than I have to as if I had higher spreads to be honest my systems would not be profitable. Even if you do get your orders in theres a good chance your broker will cancel profits and tell you it was under the "price that never existed" rule that you will have to sign up to. Aside from this, I would just be careful at news times, you really have no idea what price will do so no technical analysis applies really. Trading is hard enough without having to trade these times. I don't mean to seem negative here I 100% hope you get on great trading, I am just pointing out what I know from experience. I don't live trade Renko but I know from trading the 5Min that this is a huge concern around these times. Once upon a time news trading was extremely profitable, but that time is long gone and brokers have closed that off completely now, as they were the ones losing out. I am sure some people got EXTREMELY rich from it, unfortunately I was not one of these But either way, see what it's like for yourself live and make up your own mind about it. Take care, Jig

Don't get too paranoid about brokers. There's a lot of misinformation out there. No need to trade the news. Sit on your hands and do nothing. Trade market openings. Trade well behaved markets. Try this little exercise. Scalp 6 pips (net gain) a day. Maybe you have 4 trades. Let's say it goes like this, +10, +5, -13, +4. OK STOP. You have a +6 gain. Maybe you get more, but go for minimum +6. Switch off your machine. Go do something else. Discipline. Start again tomorrow. Based on a 10K account trade one lot each time. 30 pips a week is $300. So your account has grown by 3% in one week. Do the same the following week, but compound it. So 1% of 10,300 enables you to buy 1.01 lots. A 10K account compounded at 3% per week will have a balance of $45,155 after 52 weeks. After 2 years it will be at $210,009. That's just for 6 pips a day. OK it's never going to work out quite like that for all kinds of reasons, but it is achievable. You don't have to bust a gut trying to get 50 pips a day. I think you need a specific daily game plan with scalping because unlike higher time frame trading which generally presents less frequent setups, scalping presents many opportunities during the day. That's both good and bad. For those who are addicted to pressing buy and sell buttons, it's downright dangerous. My plan is just an example, it can be adjusted to suit each individual's risk tolerance, but it's crucial to work to daily targets. If you really need to get it out of your system. get the real money in the bank and then play in your sand box demo account where it's permissable to do silly stuff.

I'm a little bit concerned about the validity of trend lines on Renko. Without the wicks, trend lines aren't giving a true picture of where the swing points are. On the other hand we are not trading the wicks, only the bricks, so maybe it doesn't matter. Not sure really. Any ideas?

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Hi Trend lines and Renko - just an opinion: I think that trend lines are valid with Renko (without the wicks) in fact Renko makes it easier to draw valid trend lines. However you need to keep the structure of renko in mind. So you trend line is really a trend area - and the width of it is 1 Renko Brick. Just my 2c, Ian

Mandel, I have found the calendar on dailyfx a good source for news, it updates on a sunday night and gives the news for the entire week so you can plan your week round these times if you have too, it also has some neat little filters and sort options if your not bothered by low importance news releases or currencies that you don't trade. Hope this helps The Dr. http://www.dailyfx.com/calendar/

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Nice link, thanks!

--- 帖子 #400 ---
All this is very interesting info to me. I would actually like to know your experiences from trading nitro in a live account, since I'm still far from such trading

--- 帖子 #401 ---
I have calmed down and decided to continue as not to do so would be churlish and would be akin to cutting off my nose despite my face!! I just do not like selfish people. Sorry for my dummy spit! I have noticed a strange occurence on my 10 pip EJ renko chart - not the first time - but now and then an earlier bar repaints disturbingly. On the attached chart, the 5th bar back has taken off and seems to be following current PA. Has anyone else experienced this and/or has anyone any ideas. This really causes concern for breakout trades as it can give a false fractal.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Glad to see you back scartree. I have never seen a renko candle repaint that way, however when I enable candle wicks then sometimes when I open charts, the wicks are completely screwy. So I have disabled wicks, seems to cause more problems than not. But no repainting of actual bars like you show.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Thanks 4xStar - on all fronts. I do not have the wicks enabled - but those candles that malform or repaint grow wicks!! Look at the chart - there is an earlier on a couple of bars earlier. Maybe someone else has a clue as to why...? Regards Karl

Do you have the latest version installed? Usually the fix for program problems is to uninstall/re-install.

If you're using the commercial version (s-renko), send a copy of your chart to the author...

Hi Lou The Quik EA is a money management tool which I find easy to use and very effectve. Works on any trade regardless of chart type. I am watching an intersting development on GJ which may be of interest. I am looking at a potential breakout which could go either way. I have stop orders placed at 152.91 (long) and 152.38 (short). I am inclined to favour the short side - momentum is dropping away but the short term trend is still up.... Its a wait and see situation. I am enjoying these breakout trade situations - had an earlier one today which had 16 pip drawdown but eventually made the TP. Not sure I would let the drawdown go that far if trading live - I am on demo. Either trade will be run by the Quik EA - 5 pip TP with 21 pip SL. Karl

--- 帖子 #407 ---
I am going to have to go out so will have to cancel my pending orders. What would be ideal is to be able 'set and forget' in this situation. If either order is filled, the other would be cancelled - the 'OCO' (one cancels other) order as in other markets. The EA would then manage the trade - either stopped at SL or TP for loss or profit. Does anyone have a script that would replicate an OCO order? I trade index futures and this is an order type that I frequently use.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Pleased that I cancelled that trade. My long would have been filled but it would not have given 5 pips before retracing and taking out the SL of 21 pips. Nasty! Other JPY pairs are still trending up so I haven't given up on this happening with the GJ. Waiting for the London open to see some better action. Its a good strategy but NOT perfect!

--- 帖子 #409 ---
There is no such thing as a perfect strategy. It's not the strategy. Take a good look at your charts. It's staring you in the face. Why are you even thinking about trading? You have to be able to identify a choppy market. There is also no pair correlation. Right now it is all over the place. Say this over and over again. Making money is less to do with taking winning trades and more to do with knowing when not to trade.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Nothing wrong with pending orders. I use them when I swing trade one hour charts. But forget about it with scalping. Go in at market and set MT4 to a 1 pip slippage.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Hi Slush - I guess it proved to be a good breakout after all. All it needed was a bit of volatility to light a fire under it!! I think that there was correlation and that is why I thought it could work out OK. If we all saw the same things and interpreted things the same way, then there would be no market!! I was trying to show a trade in real time wih some newbie commentary. I appreciate your input though - thanks. K

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Slush - would you not say that there was correlation between AJ, UJ, NJ and AJ at present? If not, could you define correlation. I am not sure in my own mind how far trends need to go to be correlated. K

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Sorry -my chart didn't copy - upload. Have another go!

--- 帖子 #414 ---
I'm only watching EJ, GJ and AJ on nitro. They did come into correlation a few minutes ago, but I'm also watching the EJ on the M5 and it's very choppy.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
I don't like the look of the market at all today. No trading for me. Tomorrow should be better after the US holiday.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Asia dead today. Took the London trade at 10:24, late getting in and baled out at +1 when it ran out of steam. Whoopee !!! ( would have made the +7 if I had left it). No trading for the rest of the day

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Thank you, this is a very good system!

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Agree .. it is deader than the dodo .. except for occasional strange movements, very low probability today.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
If I see 3 of 4 yen crosses moving in the same direction on renko, I consider that to be correlation. I prefer at least 2 brick renko bars on each in the same direction. If the 4th is a bit off, then I will still take a trade on the strongest pair .. but if 4th is in sync I might go for trading the 2 strongest pairs. Usually I judge strength by speed of movement, i.e. if bricks forming more rapidly on one pair, that for me would be the strongest. The 5 pip bar is very useful for determining strength this way IMO.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Very slow market today... Anyway 2 trades to be done... On the 2nd trade i've been in the market for a while...trying to catch a little bigger movement... I'm experimenting some settings with the multi purpose trade manager... i think it could make the R/R ratio much better...trying to catch the bigger movements without risking more... Unfortunately today it's not the best day to try it..but when the market moves fast...some good movements (40/70 pips) heppens...and with these settings i think is possible to capture a good part of them...

--- 帖子 #421 ---
What is the multi-purpose trade manager? Is that an EA? Has it been posted somewhere, or is it something you are stilll working on?

--- 帖子 #422 ---
It's an EA for money management...i've attached it to this post if you want tray it out... Assuming that in trading the first goal for me is " not lose ", the idea is: SL setted at 20 (or 20+spread) As soon as i have 10 pips it moves the SL to BE+5 (so it becomes a free profit trade) As soon as i have 20 pips it moves the SL to 10... And then it moves the SL every 10 pips using the jumping stop function... With slow market it can be useless but when we have a big and fast move (happens often) without big retracement it can capture 20/30/40 pips...with a low risk If my calculations are right, if we filter the signals, we stay with the trend, and we watch PA moving in the right way, we could have: 20% of the times a loss (20pips or less if we cut the position) 50% of the times a 5pips profit 30% of the times at least a 10pips profit (this means the profit can be also 30/40 pips) These are only suppositions...we can see in real time how it performs...

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Hi Chris, I'm following this thread a little time now, and i like it. Thanks everybody for your all your effort. Just a question about your chart. Are you using a 5 pips renko on this chart? (what anchor value do you use?) And what settings do you use for LWMA? 10? Thanks in advance. Peter

--- 帖子 #424 ---
No...this is a 10 ticks renko... I'm trying both the values...the concept is the same... With 10 ticks renko i'm using a 8 Lwma With 5 ticks renko i'm using a 10 Lwma

--- 帖子 #425 ---
I agree with Ian. I think renko trendlines are valid without the wicks, though the wicks may add more accuracy at the expense of noise (so it's a tradeoff). I also use trendlines in general as guides/areas only. For me, they give an idea of where a reversal formation may take place, so I highlight the area, wait for price to move into that area, and if there is a reversal formation, then I take it. I also want to see S/R or a fib in the reversal area as confirmation. When using trendline breaks, again I wait for price action to confirm that the break was in fact a change of trend. If price is moving down and then breaks thru the trendline, I still wait for a higher low or double bottom to confirm that price has finished its move down. And vice versa if price is moving up. I have, on more than one occasion, been too eager to jump on a trendline break, only to watch the trend continue along the other side of the trendline. In fact, it's not uncommon for price to break thru a trendline and then use the other side of the trendline as support or resistance as it continues in the same direction. In the end, highs and lows and horizontal S/R trump all -- though trendlines are very useful guides along the way.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Consolidation/chop and its "patterns" are every bit as important as reversal and trend continuation patterns. Understanding consolidation decreases expenses, understanding the other two increases revenue. All have a major impact on profitability.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Your idea of allowing for runners is excellent. And moving the stop to breakeven plus x is a great way to increase overall R:R without the psychological angst of watching price retrace against you. Rather than set a fixed pip amount to adjust your stop, price action may provide a more logical (and profitable) method of stop management. I highlighted your previous chart for illustration. Let me know if you have any questions.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Defined range Yes. Chop No. There is a difference. If you are suggesting that the market is available at these choppy times if the patterns within are understood, I would say that's a bad piece of advice. Particularly where spread is a large percentage of these small scalping profits. There is simply no need to be in the market all the time. Wait for the high probablity setups to come. asdf take a look at the charts again during today's European session. Not only was it choppy but price had no momentum behind it. You need to be patient.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Sorry for the miscommunication. I was simply reinforcing the bolded quote from your prior statement. And I used the word patterns in quotation marks because they are not usually patterns per se, though they are identifiable and predictable. No disagreement at all with what you said. And I will repeat a great point you bring up: there is simply no need to be in the market all the time.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
OK gotcha. Sorry for my misunderstanding. Real crap market today.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
I'm learning (albeit slowly) from your posts and have a question. On the attached chart (5 pip Renko) is the best entry point the one marked with the arrow or the following block? Thank you, Lou

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Not good, not so bad... +14 Take care guys, GrZack

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Lou, wait till the brick's close, confirms the arrow's direction. Enter the trade, when the arrow's brick is closed. Regards, GrZack

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Thanks - I think I'm (slowly) getting this...

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Don't give up! A month ago, I was nowhere. Now, I can make profit. Nitro &amp; RENKO are great. Gives new perspective in FX (I think). Take care &amp; keep us posted with your results (these things will move US forward). GrZack

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Hi Gr Interesting the FX Fish indy...what settings you find better?

--- 帖子 #437 ---
It is a great tool, much better than anything else here... Works VERY WELL with RENKO. I'm working on an EA. My settings: 10 0 false true (optional) 6 45 0 3 Chris, this indi is what I was talking about via PM. The indi is repainting! All other indies are useless... +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ except ... another one: +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Big green &amp; big red arrows came from a different indicator... I couldn't believe, but (with the proper settings), gives 100% success rate... Today, it gave 4 signal only on AJ, EJ, CJ, UJ. I cought 3 from these signas, with 100% success. On GJ it gave 5 signals, with 100% success. I mean, the arrows appear right after the brick's close &amp; then 1 brick (10 pip) also formed in the same direction...

--- 帖子 #438 ---
What's the indi that puts up the big green &amp; red arrows .... and with what settings, GrZack?

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Sorry man, first, I want to test it at least during 100 trades. Than, I'll share the results &amp; the indi as well. Don't want to create illusions, before I test it real hard.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Yes I think it's better to test every eventual indy...more than once i have found something that gave me 100% for the past..or for some trade...and then...in real time...the obvious reality... But hope is the last that dies

--- 帖子 #441 ---
This is my motto

--- 帖子 #442 ---
I did an FF search for the FX Fish indy and I'm not sure I found the same one you guys are using but if it is not repanting it sure is giving interesting signals!

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Never mind .. it repaints like crazy!

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Probably repaints too.....interesting signals also......

Whilst everyone is off fishing I continue to earn the grocery money. Usd/Jpy was an oddball at the London strike but that is often the case. London was about a -ve 20 pip drawdown before it turned, about 45 mins before t/p. +7 on each eur/jpy trade

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Lou, sorry for the delayed response. I think this answers your question. If it doesn't, let me know.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Patience has it's own reward - +7 pips on eur/jpy

Nice Dave, I also just made +13 on EY, got it on a pullback so got a few extra pips. Not fishing anymore, the fish keep changing colors.

Hey Dave, Could you tell me what the MI indicator is that you have below each chart?

TpTrading. The MI indicator on my charts is attached here for you. Settings 2,10,2,3

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Hi 4xStar. I am noticing that even though I am making my regular 7 pips the price usually pulls back about 10 or so the minute I hit the button. Have to look at it a little closer as we progress, waiting for the pullback would increase the t/p but how many runaway trades would we lose out on??

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Thanks Dave.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
I'm using the 5 bar renko to decide whether to wait for a pb or not .. in this case the 10 bar was moving up and down but the 5 bar had already formed a down bar so based on the mom indy and overall trend I got in just as 5 pip bar was trying to form another down bar. It didn't succeed, but even if it had, unless there was sudden strong downward momentum, I was already committed to going long &amp; that bar gave me the pb I wanted. As to how many you miss waiting for a pb .. I would guess you would miss out ... but .. then you would be able to get in on strong upward momentum. If the EY had not pulled back there, it would have 'broken out' above it's daily high &amp; that would be another reason to enter a trade, following momentum. Hope that was clear...

--- 帖子 #454 ---
My original plan was to trade the Nitro strategy on a demo account until I was consistently profitable and then switch to a live account and trade mini lots until it proved itself to be as profitable. Having made the move to an existing live account, I want to make some observations that directly affect scalping and use of the Nitro strategy. First some live feed info: Broker 1 - Demo Account (Dealing Desk) Data feed seems to be unfiltered as tick chart shows significant activity during normal trading hours for all currency pairs. EURJPY - normally 1 to 2 pips. Have seen as low as -1 pip and as high as +12 pips during news. GBPJPY - normally 5 to 6 pips. Have seen as low as 3 pips and as high as +15 pips during news. Broker 1 - Live Account (Dealing Desk) Data feed seems to be filtered as tick chart shows significantly less activity during normal trading hours for all currency pairs than the demo account. EURJPY - normally 3 pips. Have never seen it lower than 3 pips and have seen it as high as +35 pips during news. GBPJPY - normally 7 pips. Have never seen it lower than 7 pips and have seen it as high as +70 pips during news. Broker #2 - Demo Account (ECN) Data feed seems to be unfiltered as tick chart shows significant activity during normal trading hours for all currency pairs. EURJPY - normally 1 to 2 pips. Have seen as low as .1 pip and as high as +35 pips during news. GBPJPY - normally 3 to 4.5 pips. Have seen as low as .6 pips and as high as +35 pips during news. Broker #3 - Demo Account (Pass-through to ECN) Data feed seems to be unfiltered as tick chart shows significant activity during normal trading hours for all currency pairs. EURJPY - normally 3 to 4 pips. Have seen as low as 1.1 pip and as high as +27 pips during news. GBPJPY - normally 6 to 9 pips. Have seen as low as 5 pips and as high as +65 pips during news. Broker #3 - Live Account (Pass-through to ECN) Data feed seems to be unfiltered as tick chart shows significant activity during normal trading hours for all currency pairs. EURJPY - normally 3 to 4 pips. Have seen as low as 1.1 pip and as high as +27 pips during news. (Same as Demo Account) GBPJPY - normally 6 to 17 pips. Have seen as low as 5 pips and as high as +65 pips during news. (Same as Demo Account) Broker #4 - Demo Account (ECN) Data feed seems to be unfiltered as tick chart shows significant activity during normal trading hours for all currency pairs. However, as an ECN, the tick activity was significantly less than broker #2 above indicating that their access to the market may be significantly limited by the banking/financial entity they are aligned with. During off European session, this broker's tick activity was almost non-existant with extremely high spreads (GJ averaging 20+ pips) especially during the Asian session. EURJPY - normally 2.6 to 4.5 pips. Have seen as low as 2.1 pip and as high as +46 pips during news. GBPJPY - normally 4.8 to 6.9 pips. Have seen as low as 3 pips and as high as +70 pips during news. How I tested this: Computer #1 was setup to receive Demo account feed (demo account logged in). Computer #2 was setup to receive Live account feed (live account logged in). Both computers had identical MT4 Profile, templates, and indicators. Renko bars was setup with 10 pip bricks. Readings were made throughout the day including NYC, European, and Asian sessions over a period of a week. How does this affect you? If you are scalping, you need adequate price activity to be able to enter trades with confidence. If price activity is limited by the broker to what they want you to see, you may not have significant enough information to successfully enter trades. If spreads are prohibitive, you may not be able to trade pairs you prefer. Of over 2 dozen demo accounts I have tested, brokers with direct market (ECN) access generally have the best price activity. However, I am not making any recommendations here, only suggesting that you do you own due diligence and "Test" your broker's demo and live accounts against each other and against other brokers. Be aware that just because a broker is an IB for another broker that this does not necessarily mean that you get worse data feeds or higher spreads than the originating broker. The bottom line is that not all brokers are keen on scalpers and will make environmental "adjustments" which directly affect your profitability. If you don't believe me, set up both a demo and live account on two seperate computers and trade the same signals. What you will find out is that demo accounts are usually much more profitable than the live accounts.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Thanks for these tests...i'm trying an ECN demo account too...but in demo i can't see big differences between ecn and non-ecn (except for the commission on every trade)...but i think in live account we can have really troubles if we don't have a fast and reliable broker...

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Chris, I agree that a fast and reliable broker is paramount to profitable trading. We probably could start a thread just on this issue but unfortunately as I have found out, live accounts generally don't perform the same as demo accounts. The best advice is read the broker reviews online and thoroughly test your demo account. Open a live account with the broker(s) you feel will provide the best service and again test the live trading against their demo trading. ECN brokers and Dealing Desk brokers are two seperate animals and have distinctly different behavior. Be sure to research the differences as well because they can be significant.

Brokers who look down on scalping are typically doing things away from the "norm" imho. In the case of scalping, you want to be aligned with the broker that has no problem with scalping whatsoever and typically that would be an ECN broker that also charges commission - you bring them more business and commissions since scalping naturally requires many trades. Dealing desk may not at first look down on you at scalping since they dont know if you'll be profitable long term and trade against you, hunt down your stops if they are tight,etc... With spreads progressively getting more competitive across the board - i think its imperative to be aligned with broker that has your best interests in mind. just my 2pips.thx.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Ok, this is an issue of paramount importance. Why don't we open a thread where we can compare live brokers -normal and ECN-, so we can find the best alternative for our (profitable) trading? We can also point out web reviews, wtc. I believe if we do it here we'll be diverting from the original intention of the thread Regards Mandel

--- 帖子 #459 ---
BTW, If you have been a victim of stop hunting with a US broker and you have valid proof, pm me as I know someone who is seriously looking into this issue.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
i've experienced it few times with a broker who kept getting these sudden spikes quite often but they are also one of the worst imo to have a micro account with. solution is simple, go to good broker that has your interests in mind and is on same page as you. i'll leave the invistigations to nfa and such, i dont have time to waste.I think it would be difficult to prove they are doing anything extremely wrong and it might not happen as frequently as people complain, imho [easy to blame broker for loss], but let alone force any type of action since these types of brokers are MarketMakers and they do also provide a service to small retail traders with small accounts - they provide added liquidity - these trades dont go to interbank they stay within the market makers who are a business and operate as such - to generate profits for their business and by also taking statistical advantage that many newly opened accounts opened by inexperienced traders will be losers...you see what i'm saying.

Hi DaveW Is there any advantage in having both the MI and the Momentum indicators of your charts - I would have thought that they gave the same information? Regards Karl

--- 帖子 #462 ---
I cannot trade in a demo account as it is too easy for me to make money there, I need to have real money involved even if a small amount. So I have a micro account with FX Solutions and use MT4 for charting. I enter or exit based on the MT4 renko charts, not on what my broker is showing, usually they are within 1-2 pips of each other. This is working well for me, and I do avoid news trading. I plan to open an account with Baron Forex and maybe one with FX Pro and as I increase position size, then will see who seems the most honest. I use the broker reviews at forex peace army to help pick brokers, although I know many there can be biased. I have a feeling when I am trading full lots, I may have to change brokers every few months as nearly everyone says when you start making serious money, that's when the real problems begin .. I agree maybe more detailed broker discussion could be continued under that forum heading in FF, maybe Brokers for Nitro Traders or some such thread could be started. I'm not going to start it, have enough to do with this one

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Thanks for responding. I know that my questions are elementary - I'm a very good programmer but a poor trader. As far as the "wait for a pullback" suggestion, I probably don't have the stones to do that at this point but I'm sure your suggestion will stay in my brain and take root eventually. I'm just happy to get in at a reasonable place I've begun drawing support/resistance lines on my chart and moving them around to the appropriate places - it helps a lot and I was actually profitable today... Thanks for your help, Lou

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Yes, one of my issues with kb's advice - most people will not trade the same with real money on the line (even $1.00 pips) and this should be an important step in trading education. Trade with real money! Not so much that you can't pay the mortgage but enough so that it gets your attention when you lose... Just my 2 cents, Lou

+7 for breakfast With everything pointing up I waited for the block on the eur/jpy to close at 133.95, then hung back until the retrace to 133.90 put on the buy and within 10 mins was out with a profit of 7 pips. I use the MI indicator to give the trend and the Momentum (4) for the heads up signal. Nothing complicated. I use the gbp/jpy as the leading indicator as once that one starts moving the eur/jpy will follow shortly afterwards. Nothing sophisticated, just simple PA with a little help from the momentum indicators

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Have ditched the usd/jpy so use GBP/AUD/EUR as my correlators. Once they are lined up wait for the retrace on the eur then ride it for +7 pips

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Yes i have dropped the UY pair too. The market is pretty ranging today, isn't? I'd rather play it safe and wait

--- 帖子 #468 ---
It's 3 days that PA is very boring....difficult to scalp

--- 帖子 #469 ---
GY is out of sync with the others and PA is still very lackluster.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Patience finally paid off. No correlation at London time slot but they finally came back together once NY opened. Eur/jpy for +7 pips

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Yes patience pays... Got +10 on AY, 2 shorts and +11 on EY short. Now I am eyeing the EY which is the strongest and looks like it may be testing prior support around 133.60. This gets a bit easier every day.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Well, that went well .. got another +10 from the EY as she began the up-move. This is not rocket science .. *pay attention to charts *watch for correlation *trade the strongest pair with confirming trigger. Note new sig line

--- 帖子 #473 ---
As I see it EY has already made a triple low and the candle is trying to go south (a probability of a 4th low). Right now mom is slow and all other pairs are even more ranging So basically all the signs are saying WAIT ! I could harvest a few pips here but that would be more gambling than trading. I wouldn't trade this pair now, not untill it creates a higher high and possibly would wait for a retracement Any opinion on my analysis would be appreciated Mandel

--- 帖子 #474 ---
4xstar, I'd really appreciate it if you could post your charts with your trading signals

Morning coffee time +7 pips

--- 帖子 #476 ---
+8 pips E/J at 0430 ET. I'm using your setup DaveW. Thanks. It makes things very clear. Nitro requires a lot of patience! Just keep drinking coffee until it all lines up.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Hey Chris B I have been using one I like very much, but would love to test this one out. Would you post a set file with the settings as you suggested already in so I can review the setup? thanks! Brian

LH vertical red line is Frankfurt. The red horizontal line on the eur/jpy chart is the resistance that I had not noticed beforehand, subsequently immediately after hitting the button for the buy it went south. The price dropped to within .3 of the stoploss before recovering. Price never hit the b/e so stopped it out manually at -7 pips (my profit from this morning's Tokyo trade). As I was peeing around with the Frankfurt trade I missed the London trade which is the RH vertical line

--- 帖子 #479 ---
+41 for today! 3 shorts on the EY, the first I was just about to click the button at +7 when she suddenly dropped another 20 pips. Then 2 more on a retrace and testing the Daily S1 from below. Charts are actually attached! I know I am the world's worst for attaching charts, partly because my charts are on my new laptop running Vista &amp; for some reason when I type replies on that computer, the typing slows way down .. I have to press each key very slowly .. or type in Notepad then copy/paste here. Anyone else have this problem &amp; know a fix? Also I'm very verbal (anyone notice??) &amp; get involved with describing what I did rather than just posting a pic.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Guess I am done for today unless something spectacular presents itself. I'll hang around watching charts for another hour, then it is out to do some gardening. I forgot to mention above, as usual I watched for all 4 pairs to decide on a direction, in this case it was down so I picked the EY as showiing the most weakness. If I had been faster, could have grabbed some pips from AY as well .. I was watching it, but did not react as quickly as I should have.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
nicely done 4xSTAR

--- 帖子 #482 ---
FXSTAR, Probably your typing slows down because MT4 is overloading your CPU. I was running MT4 on Windows 7 and it was eating out my CPU too. I had to downgrade to XP (or get a new Comp with bigger processor, the former was cheaper)

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Thanks .. but I am running 2 versions of MT4 on the other computer as well (the one I'm typing on now). It runs XP. The Vista one is loaded with memory, processor speed, etc .. and this is the only place where typing slows down. I will have to try typing in other forums to see if it slows there as well .. or maybe it is a Vista-FF thing. But I would imagine a lot of people on this forum have Vista OK .. I couldn't resist .. took one more +8 on the EY retracement to 133.60. I have another chart I use to determine those retracements and safe re-entries, which I will share in a couple of weeks, want to test it thoroughly first. Now I'm done!

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Thanks .. part of it was luck .. that 20 pip sudden drop in EY helped a bit

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Looking forward to checking your new discoveries Share it now...

--- 帖子 #486 ---
If you want to optimize your MT4 installation, make sure each indicator you place on your charts, if it has a "lookback" or some other functionality to limit the number of bars of calculation, is set to 1000 or less. Set the indicators only on your long term charts to a higher value and place them in a seperate profile. I run 2 copies of MT4 plus Tradestation on Windows Vista. Each installation is showing a minimum of 12 charts and with tradestation I have tabs with 12-20 charts per tab. CPU usage is usually around 35%. Computer is running on an AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core processor 5600 at 2.8ghz. Windows Vista is 32 bit operating system. 4 gb ram. I have dual video cards with 4 monitors. I found that using MT4 requires using Profiles for efficient use. Make a profile for different functionality or different currencies. You may find that will help keep MT4 from hogging your computer resources.

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Thanks 4xTrader, good information! I will do some checking into my MT4 settings this weekend, especially on the Vista computer.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Nice gear... That setup would definitely kill anything less than a dual core processor

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Sorry, I wasn't trying to brag about the gear. The first time I setup MT4 it literally would choke the machine with a dozen charts and no other programs open. I started looking at what was causing the problems and did a lot of research online to find solutions. It took some time but MT4 will hog resources unless you tame it. An addition al thought is once you have a chart setup with the indicators tuned, take and create a template. Then use that template wherever you can. It will help with the tedium of checking indicators.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
4XTrader2 I have found that typing messages, letters are often missed. I type quite quickly but I have to edit after to add the letters missed. I even took the keyboard apart and cleaned it of dust, etc (which it needed anyway!) but that didn't help. It may be the problem you have raised - MT4 eating my resources. I will check also. Thanks for the advice. I run MT4 (6 charts) and Ninjatrader for index futures (with 8 charts) on a pretty powerful computer with 2 screens. Karl

Has anyone had any success with the Fish indi? I found FX_FISH_2MA on another thread and have had a brief look at it. Visually it looks very interesting but I have not had time to do anything with it so far? Chris, I think you said you were working on a Fish indi - there appeared to be a number of them when I Googled for it. The others didn't appear to be worth further study. My apologies if I am out of place introducing another indi here but it has been raised before but if it replicates Trix with advantages over Trix, it may be of interest. Karl

--- 帖子 #492 ---
I will give my results by years end on live account. thank you.

Hello there! I am new to this thread but not in forex trading. I started to read this thread but do not know how to get renko bars on charts. SO, can someone PLEASE explain me what to do and how to get right template and what indicator to use to have everything set for scalping. Next, can someone in short sentences explain how to trade this system. THANKS A LOT!

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Karl, the fish indicator repaints before your very eyes, looks good in retrospect, not so good trying to look forward rgds PEter

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Peterke - thanks Peter - guess I will not waste any time on it then. K

--- 帖子 #496 ---
Agree with the above, it repaints like crazy! All versions that I have found so far. I don't use it.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Renko is a commercial indicator, must be purchased. Information is in the first post on this thread, do a search engine request for mql service and you should find the ea most of us are using.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Hi Pilatus, Non comercial Renko is available on the link below , works a treat -everything of the commercial one except the wick feature and the latest version 2.1 has now been programmed to operate as an indicator not a script (still have to open offline chart to see). Regards Dr S. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...189584&amp;page=14

--- 帖子 #499 ---
That is not true!!! I'm working with the fish indi. Created an EA, which WORKS with the indi... I attached the EA to my charts yesterday 9:00 AM GMT, worked all day, 16 trades, 16 winners. +5 on each trade (avarage). So, please do not say "it is not working", cause I have to assume you did not 'play' with it for long time. Take care guys, GrZack

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Even indi's that do repaint have their place... one of the best I have on my charts the multimeter improved version, the snakeforce. Love it. Can you please post the version you are using (of the fxfish) and your currrent settings you are testing GrZack. I appreciate it and would gladly give some feedback back as well Brian

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Brian, I'm using that one, what Chris attached to the thread some days ago. The settings ... I already shared the settings you'll definitely find them within this thread. BUT, of course I use this with collaborating another indi. Which is a default built in. Sorry for saying this, I have to keep this secret for a while. (83 trades more, as I want to make sure the EA CAN &amp; WILL make profit). the snakeforce? Hmm... sounds interesting. Take care buddy. GrZack

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Checking that out..appreciated Brian

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Thanks buddy. Can you give me indicators and templates which you use please?? Of course if you purchased renko indy then it is ok if you do not want, but if you did not it would be much faster to give me indicators and templates. As I read on first post there is explanation but I do not understand proper set up of indy's although 4xstar said that this system doesn't need any indy. I like trading without indy and need just renko bar beacuse I am support and resistance trader. But it is not surplus if I can set up indy too. Thanks for your help. Appreciate it.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Hi Zack, It really seems you have a different and working Fish indi because like mentioned earlier, the one I have also repaints badly and is late to change its mind when it's in the wrong direction. Doomed to fail with the one I have, using the settings in earlier posts. Could you please post yours so we can have a test at it? Many thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Hello Golden1, Thanks for your comments on the Fx Fish indi and the one you use. Since you seem to have found alternative indis to the Fx Fish, would it be possible for you to post the multimeter improved indi? Many thanks, Kind regards Don

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Hi Pilatus and welcome I'm attaching a template you may find useful. The indis setup are clearly explained on post #1: We put up 4 charts of these pairs: EY, GY, AY and either NZD/Y or CAD/Y and then during specific trading times (below) we sit back and watch for CORRELATION in price movement between the 4 pair. USD/JPY can also be watched, but is normally not traded. We are looking for all 4 pairs to be moving in sync. When this correlation is spotted (and it occurs at least once during every trading session) you can take your trade in all pairs or just focus on one or two. Your choice. For indicators, we use the sm trix-colored candles to color the renko bars, settings 2,1,1,1, indicator attached below. DX Trade wrote a neat 'dashboard' and some use that, also attached A HMA color line is used as moving average, settings are 8,3,3 or 10,3,3. Some use other settings or you can use the MA in Color with Applied Price . Momentum indicator set to 4 is a standard MT4 indicators. A Trix indicator is also used but it is built into the dashboard &amp; into the candles. And .. Chris_B wrote a Nitro arrow indicator based on momentum that many find useful (and he is still working on improving...) All attached.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
" For indicators, we use the sm trix-colored candles to color the renko bars, settings 2,1,1,1, indicator attached below. DX Trade wrote a neat 'dashboard' and some use that, also attached " This is what I do not get. What is sm trix colored???? which indicator is that? I do not see that indy on first post with that name? IF I put al those indicators which are on the first post I still do not have renko bar? Do I need to purchase them and where, or I can find somewhere for free???? Next, It is easy to recognize synchronization, but when to take a trade, which direction, what is trigger? On some rebound from some level, or there is some 1,2,3 pattern, after some pullback?? What is timeframe to take a trade? 1 min or 5 min? Sorry but on first post is mostly math how to enter a trade with 5 lots and make 25 pips. That is what wer all know, I wanted to know right set up, and entry point or trigger. Thanka a lot!

--- 帖子 #508 ---
The sm trix colored candles are actually the smC4scalper v3.1 candles (attached in the 1st post) We normally use the purchased renko bars which are installed according to the instructions you get when you purchase it, and then you attach the template to the offline chart where renko bars are shown. You should always keep the m1 charts renko draws the data from open. I cannot put comercial links on this posts but you can find directions it in the previous post (#497) About entry/exit times, S/R levels etc. I think you should do the effort of reading the whole thread, there's a lot of info there.

I had the same experience with all 3 versions of the indy I tried.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
There may be a brand new free version that works,but as of a couple of weeks ago the free version did not work as it did not use tick data.

Yes .. not sure why the other thread just died out. The poll is set to expire in 2 days, I cant seem to end it earlier.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
I made some minor additions to the first post, but all the information was there. I have further emphasized the fact that people need to study the charts posted in this thread to learn how to determine the tiggers for entry. Nearly everyone has their own setup which is why no template is posted. You can use any trigger you prefer, and only practice will determine that. With enough practice you will learn to 'see' the PA we are talking about. No shortcuts, just practice, practice, practice.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Excellent thread to force people to buy renko bars. Is "mgl service" yours site or your's colegue site? Looks like you do not know much about trading but you are good in fooling people to buy yours products. Otherwise there will be renko bars and templates for free here. Thanks for answers anyway.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Back to trading .. I see 3 pair that made a down move overnight, the NZ/Y did not join the party. I'll watch for a retracement at NY open, not sure if it will just be a pullback or a change of direction, my bias is direction change (but what do I know??)

--- 帖子 #528 ---
sure thing... here you go. The attached one is what I use. YES, I know, it repaints hardly, BUT... if you still interested. Put this on your chart, and watch. Don't do anything, just watch. You won't be disappointed. My screenhours with this indicator is approx 60 or more... till I could decide, what is important. Have a great weekend guys.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Hi, we'll look forward to your trades next week. I don't know if renko can be used with MT4 strategy, I never use that. Maybe some others on the thread have had experience with it.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
You just can't use them alone... they can be great, some of the best indicators ever made people claim are repainting, more like live actual data that updates, but regardless.. you just can't use them alone. You have to have solid confirmation from non mtf non repainting sources, ie price action, ma/lwma color change, stoch, macd, rsi.. etc etc etc Here is the snakeforce multimeter I use, I personally love it for trend confirmation per don c's question earlier. I use the new mtf snakeforce on my regular charts as well (not renko for that one) very nice. Brian Snake MM http://kreslik.com/forums/viewtopic....rce+mutlimeter

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Snakeforce repaints up to 4 bars.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Thanks Brian for the indi! personally, I don't care what happened some time ago, rather than what is happening RIGHTNOW! I think, you also feel the difference --&gt; this is why you also use an indi which is "repainting". Regards, GrZack

--- 帖子 #533 ---
HI 4Xstar... or infact any of the other commercial renko users, is the attached chart a fair reflection of the current ej 5 pip chart? (upto 8.30 gmt approx) Thanks in advance Dr.S

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Your chart is OK. Are you also using the original 10 pips chart?

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Mandel, No is the answer, I posted a 5pip chart because i think a number of people have moved down to that size brick and was just curious whether the free renko measured up to the comercial one after what 4X said. to trade live I have my charts set at the size of my brokers spread ie: 3pip EJ, 2 pip EU etc. just so its clear for me that if I get a signal I know that i only have to get one brick movement before i am into profit. I also don't get that sudden price surge aginst me that so many people have talked about when trading 10 pip blocks and believe me when I was using 10 pips I thought I was jinxed when it kept happening!!. Hope this helps &amp; happy trading. Doc.

--- 帖子 #536 ---
45FXguy Thats a neat presentation of all of the JPY pairs on one chart. Do you find this helps in seeing correlation in real time? Certainly appears to do so as shown. How did you do that? Might be nice to cram a small window on the screen somewhere to keep an eye on the overall action. I have been watching Fish for a few days and I like it but I don't think it could be used in back testing. I am also reluctant to add back wriggly lines having worked so hard to minimise the chart spaghetti!! Regards Karl (PS - 4xStar - "you da man" - pity remarks like that pill made even make it to print but you did the right thing quickly and decisively - well done!).

I learned that little trick from the CatPreacher. Here's some instructions in this post on how to do it, if it isn't enough let me know. http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...5&amp;postcount=60 I haven't used it all that much yet since I just learned how to do it myself. Looks like it should be very a handy tool with this method especially if your like me &amp; have trouble fitting 4 charts into a MT4 screen &amp; still still have room to see what's going on. I see Cat made a typo, here's the correct spelling: http://www.dailyfx.com/ Power charts are the one you want to use, you'll need java installed in your browser to use it. The charts are live &amp; free. If you hit the thumbtack icon top right, it will pop out of your web browser, &amp; the window is resize able, just grab a corner &amp; drag it. Here's a sample chart, sorry not a renko one yet. You can even save the workspace too, so you don't have to set up every time. fyi: 4xstar is, "da Woman!", not da man. lol, think I read someplace woman are actually better traders, think it has something to do with woman's intuition. Too bad I can't get my wife interested in fx yet. In her profile.... Mom of 4 stupendous (now grown) kids and 2 adorable grandchildren.

Good morning. Would someone be able to please share the setting for the fish 2ma indy recently posted. I'm watching it in its default settings. Not game to blindly play with settings so as to not mess with its performance. And if poss a quick explaination of the lines. ta. Regards, D.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Re those fxdaily java charts mentioned above, that may turn out to be a useful tool, I'm going to try it. However when setting up the chart you have to select 'relative to' if you want to see more than 2 currency comparisons. Choosing 'overlay' you can only compare 2. Also I noticed the chart resets itself after a certain amount of time .. or maybe if it is not 'active', so has to be re-setup. With respect to the repainting FX Fish indy, I will try it as well this week. However.. remember ... to stay true to the spirit of this thread, we should not be introducing new indys unless they have been thoroughly forward- tested.

Are the live traders here using de commercial or non commercial version of the renko bars? Thanks, Thierry

--- 帖子 #546 ---
I missed that one!

--- 帖子 #547 ---
I couldn't agree more! Today +7, +8, +6, +7, three on the EY, one on the AY (real money acct). I just checked for correlation, picked the strongest (EY this morning) took 3 trades on it on pullbacks and at one point AY looked stronger so I got that on a pullback as well. No rocket science, just the 3 P's ... patience, practice &amp; price action! Well said! British english is so ... descriptive.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Nearly everyone uses the commercial version. The free MT4 version does not work ..,, however there is one person on this thread who says the new version of it does work. Bottom line, if it's making you money, it works!

--- 帖子 #549 ---
POST YOUR CHARTS PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Yes it does.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Well, I should have said it didn't work ..at least a few weeks ago everyone was saying it did not work. However as I said above if it makes you money .. it is working!

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Any who are interested in this should visit the Renko Block Chart thread in the Programming Forum - it's not a long thread and toward the end you will find the most recent version of LastViking's efforts (v2.1 I believe) which works very well and is easy on cpu cycles. There's no profit motive here - EllisEdi, LastViking (and occasionally myself) have put a good number of hours into this with the goal of sharing it with others. I'm in the process (after many requests) of adding optional wicks to the Renko bars - when I have it working properly I'll post it at the above-mentioned forum. I have also posted an indicator there (RenkoAM_v2.0) that shows the elapsed time needed to form each Renko bar. It is actually quite predictive a good percentage of the time and may help in identifying the best times to get that 5 (or more) pips. Good Trading, Lou

+7 Frankfurt and +7 London

Another hit at London +7

--- 帖子 #555 ---
I can confirm that the last version of the free script is working perfectly...thank you Lou and the others working on this...so everyone can use renko in the future without pay nothing...

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Hello DaveW, What is the MI(2) indi that your using? Don't think I've seen that one before. It also looks like your using a fractal s/r indi &amp; what indi is providing the signal arrows on your charts &amp; how it that working out for you? PS: I'll admit I've only read about 1/2 the thread this weekend sorry if you've already mentioned all of the above just send me to the right post # &amp; I'll read from there. Thanks

--- 帖子 #557 ---
OK, I will amend the first post on this thread to offer the free version as an alternative.

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Twee, if you are about, can you remove the poll from top of this thread, it is no longer relevant. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Hi 45FxGuy. Here is the indicator you requested. The arrows on the chart indicate the cross over on the MI and if of you use them as a trigger in conjunction with the LWMA colour, corellation and time of day they are very accurate. Can get chopped to death if you trade when there is no momentum. Dave W

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Ok, thanks a lot. Think I used it before but don't remember it placing the arrows on the chart, guess my indi folder is too full &amp; having trouble seeing it right now, will have to take some more out of it.

--- 帖子 #561 ---
+7 and so to bed. Good night

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Didn't really take that many pips on my live micro account, but did bank +4% so done for the day, &amp; now time to play more demo. Good night dave, still morning here. lol....

What are the two ma's you have on your 5 tix chart? Brian PS sorry Roto that is

--- 帖子 #564 ---
How is your testing going this week with the fish 2ma and the the secret arrows? Like to hear an update on this week so far.. I will be posting my new setup soon, but keep trading for now Brian

--- 帖子 #565 ---
ma in color w applied price set to 8,3,6 the other one is simply a 21 ema to show general trend. Also extra confirmation for a nice entry when they cross and the color changes on the MA. If they cross and the color changes within a few candles of each other, usually good for some pips if everything else looks good. Greg

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Thanks for responding Greg Yes I have used the 32 but its too smoothing, 21 is good. I have that and the 8 ma in color on my charts Brian

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Hi Brian, thx for the question. I'm working on it. It has a little bug, I think... (not confirmed yet ). I tried several combinations of the settings which means how many trade does it perform per day. On the first day, there was 7 trades. Now, it did 15 winners + 2 loosers / day approx. The "bug" causing the losses, this is not a question, but I still don't know that the fish indi is the main problem, or the condition is not correct/complete yet. Version1 : total failure Version2 : can make consistent profit, with the "BUG". Version3 : not complete yet, BUT I hope it will be done tomorrow. The difference (version2--&gt;verson3) should eliminate the "BUG". Regards, GrZack

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Hi, Just a quick reply to say I use the non commercial one and it does the job. No problem at all...

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Hello, I am using the version Renko live chart 1.6. Where could I find the 2.1 and what format is it? A script, an indic or EA? Thanks

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Here you go. Attach it as an Indi. Working really nice.. Regards. tex

--- 帖子 #571 ---
LouG I hve set up the indi as advised but the last couple of bricks are strange. Have I done something incorrectly? Karl

--- 帖子 #572 ---
The version I have made my station crash as I used it as a script. I'll check it out. Thanks v much.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
I've just looked at it and it seems to give a different picture than the commercial ones. So the millage can vary.

Hi, When I drop the indy on a 1min EUR USD chart and open a 2min offline EUR USD, it opens a USD CHF 5mins??? Anybody would know why? Thanks

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Hello Lou, When you have time can you go into more detail on the use of the RenkoAM indis? If okay by 4star, if not we can take the discussion back to one of the other threads.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
I don't mind your discssing it in here, however it sounds still very 'buggy' so I don't want that discussion to dominate the thread. I still think the commercial version is preferable &amp; usually you do get what you pay for. If the price were prohibitive, I might feel differently but it is only 30 euro, under 50 bucks .. so no big deal. If the discussion gets too technical, maybe better take it to the programming thread.

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Back to trading, I have seen no real correlation ovenight. AY looks the strongest if pairs decide to move back up .. GY the weakest if they coninue down. I noitice DaveW has not posted his usually +7, +8 etc trades so maybe he concurs there has been no clear direction. Last night I got +5 on AY long as it was above its Daily R1 and all 4 were moving upwards together. Right now, AY &amp; NZY want to move up (but no push behind the move as yet) but the other 2 still look weak .. so we shall continue to monitor with great patience.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
I've been waiting for the yen to decide which way it wants to go this morning also. 4star I wasn't talking about the Renko chart scripts but the other indis Lou mentioned last at the bottom of my last posted MT4 chart. Although I did have some trouble with the last posted version free renko script too version 2.1, I think, so went back to using one of the other free ones that usually works pretty well when attached as an ea. Just figured I was trying to run too many charts at the same time &amp; my old pc's cpu couldn't keep up which is why it usually crashes or freezes up mt4 when I try to put too much on it.

Some good old Nitro stuff today...

Hi Chris, are you still on 5 brick Renko? Thanks. Nick

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Renko 10... 5 is really too noisy...

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Let's take all discussion of the free Renko and the RenkoAM to the Renko Block Charts thread. RE: RenkoAM - version 2.0 works with free indy may but may not work correctly with Commercial version. Forget about the MS version - it's not right and I don't have the time to diagnose what the commercial Renko is doing (plus I don't have the source code). Sorry for stepping on your thread, 4xStar...

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Chris, What ma lines are you using? The 5 pip bricks seem to piviot very well around ema 45.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Ok, I'll catch you over there later.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
ema21 and ema50 i don't use them as signals...only to see the trend or the congestions... a cross of mas means nothing...it always lags...

--- 帖子 #586 ---
As already mentioned the corellaton was all over the place. Asian nothing doing. Frankfurt was good for the big drop Then London for the continuation after the GBP/JPY retrace Then New York. Was busy all day so wasn"t able to trade but just wanted to show that even on a day like today the +7's were there for the taking. Dave W

--- 帖子 #587 ---
The only time I've seen that happen was when I inadvertently had more then one Renko running at the same time... Let's take all free Renko discussion to the Renko Block Charts thread on the Programming Forum

To show consideration for the direction of this thread, please post questions (or praise) for RenkoLiveChart and/or Renko_AM on the Renko Block Charts thread in the Programming Discussion Forum. Latest versions http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=225

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Well so much for my previous analysis .. the GY took off north as if propelled by rocket fuel, EY followed and AY was the lagger! Although, as the morning progressed, AY showed the most consistent move upward as GY turned into her usual schizophrenic self and EY kept trying to follow her up &amp; down... I managed to get +14 on EY, +6 and +4 on AY, but I still am not quick enough on the trigger .. could have had better entries and exits &amp; several more trades... Practice, practice.... For charts, see DaveW's charts, above .. mine look the same

--- 帖子 #590 ---
I wouldn't say nothing, looks at your screen shot again, there were some pips to be had after those cross, but that's not what I thought you were doing anyway as big as that cross was. I remember reading early on in the thread about the discussion of the third brick formation continuing in the current direction, or something to that effect, and was wondering if anything ever came of it. Was also wondering if there is anything concrete came from the data, and if a simple indicator could be made to place a probability like a % number somewhere to indicate the likely hood of the next brick being formed in the same direction as the last one? Hope that makes sense. Thanks

--- 帖子 #591 ---
My trade for today. missed the big move...still have to work my real job. waited for the break of the triple top and squeezed out 5 pips x 4 contracts. Finally had some nice correlation after a morning of pairs doing their own thing. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

2nd brick does the trick Q

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Hello Everyone, I was a follower of the original C4 thread, but had to leave once it grew too big to keep up with and a lot of nonsense going on there. Probably been away for a month or two! Then I just saw this thread a couple days ago and finished reading it yesterday...this is GREAT! I'd like to thank 4xStar for starting this. It's exactly what I've been looking for. I'd also like to thank ChrisB for his posts...they are very similiar setups to what I've have come to look for. Keep up the great work everyone. Hopefully I'll be able to add something usefull to the thread soon.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Just made +6 +6 with original Nitro concept... on the right...EURJPY and GBPJPY 10ticks renko on the left...EURJPY and GBPJPY 5ticks renko just an idea...i'm watching if 5tick can let me see if the PA can make or not make another 10ticks brick after a reversal...

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Now THAT would be an indicator! (if it worked...) Programmers .. start your engines.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
+7 pips on the eur/jpy for breakfast

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Not exactly what you're looking for, but this one is pretty accurate predicting changes in trend direction. Numbers 6 &amp; 7 are main trend changes (7 being main changes), 5 is like trend changes within trends. Try it out.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Still new to using Renko charts with wicks, so just noticed with the wick-o-gram indi on a renko charts that the brick with wicks may have better odds of the next brick continuing in the same direction as the last. Or maybe I'm just seeing things. Will have to try keeping an eye on this a while. Has anyone else noticed this? Maybe this could also be used in a renko prob meter of some kind. Or just use the visual info as is? I know we'll have to proof up any new indi's 100 trades or more, but if it doesn't take a lot of space &amp; can leave on chart with what were currently using to observe it in real time forward test, then why not? Just remember to remove or hide the extra test indi's when posting the charts until all results are in. PS: Maybe it has something to do with the slingshot effect. Swapped the colors on the wick-o-gram just now after this screen shot, &amp; it has a bit little more intuitive user affect with the renko bar charts. Notice how the wick-o-gram green three steps down before the brick without a wick is formed, &amp; then trend changes direction?

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Do you have the mq4 of that file? I would love to take a look at it mandel. Also did you have this on live to see its not redrawing these? thanks! Brian

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Ok never mind. thanks for posting so we could check it out though mandel. Moving on... Brian

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Just looking at your chart I can see that's not true. There's a candle with wick every time there's a direction change, the only time what you point seems to work is the example that you point at. Actually in my experience (at least with the paid renkos) the wicks are not very trustworthy, sometimes it renders some weird wick formations.

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Sorry to say your indi repaints. see following screen shots

--- 帖子 #603 ---
I don't have the mq4 file. Do a search on the forum and you may find it. I haven't tested it live for I haven't gone live yet. But it has given me pretty accurate signals (not always of course, is there any indi that's 100% proficient?), i.e. I wouldn't open a position if there's a 7 (or even 6) sign on a candle. Anyway please be aware that my main method continues to be PA action. I would never put my life in the hands of an indi. But it complements ok with PA analysis, since the only way (I know) to predict direction change with PA are s/r and double+ tops/bottoms. Sometimes direction changes happen inadvertedly. So I use it more like a warning sign rahter than a trading sign.

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Was slow of the mark and was unable to close it at +7 so was obliged to take +11.5. Will try better next time. Nothing doing at Frankfurt

--- 帖子 #605 ---
mandel, I was looking a lot further back than just what you can see in that one screen shot. Was just a possible idea, &amp;/or question. Like I said it was my first time using renko charts with the wicks turned on. Thanks to Lou's new free renko ea. By look of the 4hr charts looks like we may soon see more northerly moment today. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Anybody can help me to test this thing? I've spent some hours watching the PA moving and watching renko with wicks.... I know...wicks can be wrong...but real time PA no... As someone else have noticed here...when there is a GOOD reversal...there is a first reversal brick and then a second brick (the one that we have to trade) that has no wick (or very little)...so there is not a retracement... When there is a retracement (more than 10 pips) the reversal is not so GOOD...yes...it can win...but it can lose... Now...we know that Nitro has a poor r/r ratio (5/30)... I was wondering if you agree with me that there is no need to wait and lose 30 pips in the bad reversals... My idea is: ONLY IN PRIME TIME...entry at the very beginning of the 3rd brick...all or nothing, 5 pips TP or 10 pips SL... the r/r ratio becomes 5/10 Yes...I know...the hit rate is lower...but watching the market during prime time...it seems that the hit rate remains high...anyway with this modification you need only 2 winnings to cover a loss (instead of 6) The problem in live trading can only be the broker honesty... I'm not sure of this...but if we make sone test in real time for some day...maybe we can have a "real" hit rate %...

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Yes, renko wicks seem much less reliable when things are consolidation. Lou's RenkoAm indi makes this much easier to see. If it's taking more than 5 mins for a 5 pip brick to form, somethings going on... Amazing how the yen pairs move together even consolidate at the same time around the ema 45 etc...

--- 帖子 #608 ---
I agree with you Chris. I rarely let the losers run to -30 . Just there as an emergency hard stop. will also look at the wick idea in my forward trading and see if it has any validity for better entries Greg

--- 帖子 #609 ---
An interesting concept, but depending on the pair -10 pips is a risky trade, some pairs tend to be more 'jumpy'. Also, in my observations second candles without wicks are no guarantee of trend.. I prefer to wait for second retracements and/or other PA action formations. And my SL is always set at 20

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Well, except for Chris, we seem to be in danger of falling back into the Indy-Envy Swamp of Deception again and if Edge were around he would probably give us all a good thrashing (except for Chris...) However most are saying that raw PA is still the best way to go .. and I am actually attaching a chart! .. what I am finding is raw PA, plenty of practice and some S/R levels may be all that is needed. I have 2 indys on my chart, the MI (momentum index, you can find it under the paperclip) seems pretty good when red line crosses the white &amp; it doesn't repaint. The other one is the latest Fish indy and although it does repaint like crazy, GrZack says to just watch what it is doing at the moment &amp; I will say it can serve as confirmation when PA indicates a new move. Twice I took a trade on EY when the Fish was showing weak buying PA and although it eventually went my way, I experienced some major downtime. Now I do not trade against it, but I also do not use it as any kind of trigger. On the AY chart you will see a purple arrow .. that is where I marked the first appearance of the '7' in the indy that mandle provided (which I only have on that chart as a test) .. the actual trend change occurred one bar later. Not bad, but as he said, it looks like just something to make note of --that maybe something is about to change .. but not to trade off of. But ...note on EY and GY how price bounces off the Daily Pivot .. go back in time &amp; you will see numerous reversals or mini-reverals at daily/weekly even monthly S/R levels. The MA's I have on the chart are 50 and 200 .. for big picture direction only, I don't may much attention to them for trading, however often price will bounce from them as well. Indys can be helpful .. and I think we are gradually locating the ones that are most helpful .. but what I have found is nothing beats PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE using pure PA as the primary trigger, with confirmation from S/R levels and chart patterns.

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Chart not showing .. ?? Trying again... EDIT: this is wierd .. pic not showing up on my computer .. it says it has uploaded, it's not too big and in gif format.

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Think the wicks are part of the PA, just trying help take Nitro to the next level. Don't need edge here, 4star your "da Woman!", with the big Texas bull-whip, aka igi. Whatever you say here goes, your thread.

--- 帖子 #613 ---
And don't forget the thigh-high leather boots ... Back to trading ... Just got +5 on AY, the EY was leading upwards but also approaching the Daily R1 .. AY was strong enough and the Daily R1 was still a long way away. So took that one. EY cleared the DR1 easily enough .. now I am waiting for a re-test from above, then will probably trade it.

--- 帖子 #614 ---
+7 and so to bed.

--- 帖子 #615 ---
A better image of what i'm studing... it's EURJPY...these are the reversal during prime time (green arrows)... all GOOD reversal...there is no brick with a wick bigger than 10 pips... I was watching in real time...wicks are the real market movements...no hidden movements Took a +7 some minutes ago...my SL was -10 (max drawdown during the trade -5 pips) I will watch also GBPJPY that is more volatile...but with EURJPY it seems to work.. EDIT: sorry for my spelling "weak" error in the image :-D EDIT2: On my chart also GBPJPY seems to work at the same way...

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Still don't see your charts yet, think maybe FF servers are still overloaded. Have you noticed if you see that "servers overloaded", screen &amp; just keep hitting refresh it will never take you back to where you were trying to go in the first place, it just keeps showing the FF servers overload message. Guess that's how they temporarily reduce the traffic.

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Another fast +5 on GBPJPY... very little wick... GBPJPY may need a little bit larger stop due to higher spread...but mine was -10...max drawdown during the trade... -5

--- 帖子 #618 ---
I'm not getting this Chris, not sure where or why you are taking the trade... I see no pattern between no wicks, little wicks &amp; reversals... maybe a close up of the few bars involved with more explanation on the chart.. Sorry ... maybe it's just me.

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Sorry forgot about those cowboy boots, just remember, don't use them when you go crawfishing. Ok, must be getting close to lunch time here, that sounds too good right now.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
I'm taking the trades with the original Nitro rules...nothing different... I take the trade when there is a brick reversal...at the start of the third brick...nothing different... I'm just saying that SL can be simply -10 and not -30...because (for me) if after a reversal the price retraces more than 10 pips...it's not a good momentum trade...and there is no need to have a SL more than 10... That's all Wicks are not involved in my trades...I put them in my chart only to "verify" what i'm saying about SL...

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Don't think the awesome oscillator that comes standard with MT4 repaints, have you tried that one? You do need to make it's lines thicker to see it well though. I'll admit I do like sm bar version of fish, it works very well when used with fractal s/r support. No bull-whips please, got enough of that yesterday after mt4 crashed on me &amp; I tried trading without it on my other platform.

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Hi Dave...What settings are you using for the LWMA. Thanks Freddi

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Are there any coders here that can make a simple change to a great HA indicator? I have a system I would like to show here for my version of Nitro, but I need this HA Smoothed Alert to be adjusted so it only alerts on the candle close..ie color change is alerted only when the candle/bar when the change occurs closes... can anyone here help? Brian

--- 帖子 #624 ---
lol, I was just looking at one like it again too. Used with s/r fractals etc, looks near grail stuff. Don't know if this has what your looking for guess you can do a side by side chart comparison to see if one is any better than the other. This one places signal arrows on charts &amp; think it has alerts.

That's because you are actually redirected to a overload.html page so when you refresh it keeps refreshing that page .. you just have to change the url in the input box and delete the /overload.html part to go back to ff root page.

This is getting boring (as it should) Frankfurt +7

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Dave, A few questions about the way you trade Nitro if you don't mind... - Do you enter in the opening of the bar after the vertical line? - The criteria to enter is, sync among the three pairs, MI crossing, HLMA color but all the three should be ok to enter or you only need one or two of them? - About the right time to enter, do you enter around the session opening or you can even enter in the middle of the session if the criterias agrees? - How long do you keep the trade open, till TP or SL or do you have a time or indicators "SL" in some cases? - Which criteria do you use to choose the pair to enter? Thanks a lot for your daily charts Dave, they're really useful! Regards, Fernando.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Hi Freddi The LWMA is actually the HMA Color Nrp. Don't know what the difference is. I imagine they both do the same thing. Settings are:- 8 3 3 True 2 0 Best of Luck Dave W

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Yep, another day, another set of boring ol' charts with those boring, consistent profits... what a bore Dave, which pair do you trade ... the first chart? And do you only correlate 3 pair?

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Hi Fernando. Although I have the HLMA on the chart I don't really use it. However, it does look pretty - all those colours ! I am a simple soul and like a simple life so have decided to go with something that doesn't need a lot of brain power and is pretty much automatic once you recognize the set up. I limit myself to trading when the Stock Markets become active on the basis that when the stocks start moving invariably the currency move also, couldn't care which way as long as they move. I disregard Pivots, Fibs, Ganns, and all the other complicated indicators as they make my head hurt and clutter the charts. The only s/r I might take notice of is the latest high/low as I find that if the market price was rejected an hour ago at a certain level then entering a BUY order 4 pips below that price is not a good bet. So, when the trading window opens, and I have my coffee and taken the dog for a walk I basically just sit and watch the charts. What I am looking for is for either the gbp/jpy or the eur/jpy to complete a brick and cause the Mom(4) to form a peak/trough above the 100.05 or below the 99.95. I then wait for the other pair to do the same. Usually the momentum builds up at that point and if the aud/jpy is following the action and heading the same direction (very rarely will the aud/jpy close its brick at the same time unless the movement is rapid) I take the trade. I trade with Oanda so have a Buy/Sell order on the screen and as soon as the setup is complete and price starts moving in the right direction I hit the button. If I am lucky and the PA is rapid then by the time I get to setting in a t/p the price will have moved in excess of +7 in which case I close it immediately, otherwise I set my +7 t/p and wait. Usually the price will either hit the t/p or miss by the odd pip, retrace for 10 or so pips before it comes back to close the trade. So to answer your specific questions. 1. The red vertical lines on my chart are when the MOM has closed above/below 100.05/99.95 so I enter the trade at the brick following the second red vertical line when the second Mom brick is complete (assuming that the first one to close has not drifted the other way but that in usually not the case). 2. The criteria is indeed the MI crossing (this will have occured if the Mom has closed above/below, the Mom closing below/above and all 3 in synch. As long as the aud/jpy is travelling in the right direction it need not have closed above/below the 100.05/99.95 Mom. The deciding factor before taking the trade is that there is some rapid movement of the PA. I stick with taking the first trade in each session. I realise that there are many other opportunities during the trading day, but a certain phsae comes to mind, "Less is More". I probably manage 2 - 3 trades a day as I have a semi-invalid in the house who needs constant care (or that is what she is always telling me). Trading with a $4,000 account each trade is worth $50 so on a normal day I will make $150, That equates to $36,000 per annum. The few losses that I will have to take are covered by the days when I can do 4 trades. I started trading this method only a few weeks ago and am compounding my account so that in time I will own all the money in the Forex Market, well at least that's what my spreadsheet says. Realistically as we go on I will reduce my risk level and settle on a reasonable daily income that will suffice to keep me in a manner to which I hope to become accustomed. As far as a S/L is concerned I thought real men didn't use stop losses (read that on the FF somewhere). Seriously, I set an initial stoploss of 25 pips so including the spread I stand to lose 28 pips which is 4 times my possible gain. Not great but I have found, through many hours of using this method of trading, that if you stick to the criteria then losses are few and far between. In all the trades I have taken since I started I would not have had one single loss if I had stuck strictly to the method I have laid out above. But of course I know better than the market and I just KNOW that the price will fall so if I just get in before the brick completes I will be able to get an even quicker profit. Do you know something, I am a crappy trader when I do it by guesswork, which is why I have a set of rules and now stick to them. Having said that today I did exactly that. I missed the first setup at London opening and persuaded myself that the price was BOUND to go down only to see it jump up and cost me 28 pips. Bloody thing. So in future, it's stick to the method, even if it becomes boring. Last question was which criteria do I use to decide which pair to trade. I strictly follow the rule, if it is called the eur/jpy I will trade it. The spread varies between 2 and 3 on Oanda so I am happy with that. Even though the action is more pip-heavy on the gbp/jpy it is too volatile. Having said that the gbp/jpy is invaluable for my method of trading, as by monitoring the action on the gbp I know where the eur is likely to go, i.e. in the same direction. One last word on stoplosses. My 25 is an initial s/l I will adjust that a few pips either way to take into account the even xx00 and xx50 levels just in case the price does a quick run up and touch move. Hope this helps you in understanding the charts I keep posting. As they come from my FXDD platform I am unable to put the Oanda trades on them, however, whether I took the trades or not if you look at the setup you will be able to work out the entry and exit points fairly easily and see if my method of trading has merit or not. Regards Dave W

Hi 4xStar. Answer to your question is in my previous post to Behr. I stick with trading the eur/jpy as the spread is low and the action not as volatile as the gbp/jpy. The Aud/jpy is there for re-inforcement so as long as it is heading in the right direction I do not insist on it having crossed the Mom (you cannot trust Aussie anyway). I did start off consulting the usd/jpy as well as the chf/jpy but they were not adding anything to the mix so I ditched them. Regards Dave W

Dave, Great explanation, almost verbatim how I trade also. It does seem to work. Keep it simple, Less IS more. Greg

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Hello Dave, Thank you very much for that very detailed account of your trading method, I hope people who read it understand your point about not over-complicating one's trading. My main problem at the moment is similar to yours in that I will still try to anticipate the market and get in too early; comes with the territory of boring trading I suspect. I wish you and your loved one all the very best and am pleased that you are now finding the success necessary to help make your lives easier. For the last six years I have been caring for my mother while demo trading so I understand how difficult it is to concentrate on the job in hand knowing that one is likely to have to stop what they're doing at the drop of a hat (or anything else for that matter )

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Dave, Many thanks for the explanation on you trading method. Is there a reason why you have your EUR/JPY MI indicator set at 2,10,8,3 and the other pairs set at 2,10,2,3 ?

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Hi Noel. Thanks for pointing that mistake on the MI. I posted the latest charts from my lap-top and somehow I had the wrong setting. DaveW

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Thanks for your very detailed response, it was really helpful! Just one thing, if you can please post the price you entered on a pair of those charts you usually post just to see more or less where you had your entry point. Regards, Fernando.

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Dave I am very impressed by your trading method and your explanation above is really helpful. Can you please confirm that you enter at the start of the brick AFTER the 'red line' brick ? You chastise yourself for sometimes jumping the gun, but surely, if you are confident in the direction and start of the next brick, (and you certainly should be given your record), you could have the order box set and ready to go. I use a simple EA for managing my trades so its a matter of placing the order and the EA takes over. Alternatively, you could have a pending order in the market as you know where the next brick will open. You would not have to sit with finger poised over the 'go' button! If the signal brick does not complete but reverses, then the order can be cancelled. It seems that even with a retracement, the brick comes back to do the right thing anyway. I got caught in Sept 2001 as I had sold naked options on futures and was margined out of existence!! (I know, I know!!). I have a very small capital base so my expectations are very similar to yours. I also have a wife who is very negative about me trading any form of derivatives or futures. Forex is different - isn't it?? (Ha-Ha). Thanks for your help mate, its all good. Regards Karl

Hi Traders Just came across this site and I am very interested in the Nitro system so I thought I would try it out. I purchased the commercial version of the Renko Blocks and have added it to several charts. I do have a question concerning the red line I see on Dave's charts, I haven't seen it on any of my charts yet, is this a setting I have to turn on or is this a different indicator. Also one more question if I may, being new to Forex, why do you use the pairs you do for this system? Also as mentioned in a previous post, it would be nice along with the cahrts being posted that you could tell us what price you got in and out at. Great thread Thanks Gene

--- 帖子 #642 ---
Hi Gene. Welcome to the thread, although it is pretty quiet at the moment. The red lines are simply vertical lines I place on my charts to show where the bricks have closed painting the Mom either below/above the 99.95/100.05 levels. The theory is that when the brick closes on the second of the 2 pairs (gbp/jpy and eur/jpy) and the price is moving with increased momentum it is likely to run far enough to be able to take your profit (I go for +7 pips on each trade). I personally refer to the aud/jpy to see that it is heading in the same direction. Others have the usd/jpy or the chf/jpy. Again the theory is that all the yen crosses move together and as long as they remain correlated then a sudden move by the leader (usually the gbp/jpy) will drag the others along with it. Hope that helps. Dave W Although I am not trading this week (other commitments have left me no time) I have attached the chart from NY today. The aud was the first to close the brick below the Mom 99,95, followed by the gbp then the eur. The trade would have been taken at the opening of the block following the vertical red line on the eur chart at 134.85. The action slowed down but had no difficulty closing the trade at 134.75 (+7 pips with spread of 3)

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Thanks Dave I appreciate your help. Gene

Hi dave, Maybe i missed it, but what is your brick size? 10 with the 3.0 version? I like your chart!

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Looks like your still doing well, congrds on becoming a serious Nitro Fx Rockstar , &amp; appreciate your details description of your trading methodology. I think 4xstar owes you a couple of her's, lol. I still can't see momentum indi you uploaded probably because I don't also have the mq4 file in my indi's folder, &amp;/or can you upload the mq4 file if you have it. Could you please upload your template? That way I'll/we'll still be able to use it even if I/we can't see it in my navigation folder to attach it to charts. Thank you 45

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Hi Thierry. Thats it, 10 brick size anchored at the xxx5. Convenient, as if I enter the trade at the beginning of the brick then +7 with the spread of 3 makes the close of the brick the t/p. I like keeping it simple.

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Ok thank you i also trade now 10 bricks with the 3.0 version.

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Hey DaveW, I temp moved all other indicators from my mt4 indis folder to a temp folder just leaving the nitro ones so they would be easier to find. Seems may have been looking for a "momentum", indi that starts with a 'm', rather than 'i', so was probably part of the reason I was having trouble spotting it. Anyway, how does this template compare to yours? I didn't see any signal arrows yet from the indexedmomentumk indi so put DXtrade dashboard on the chart per post # 1, plus sm's renko signals. Will try it on all three or four yen pairs tomorrow with 10 pip bricks as stated below. Is your bottom momentum indi applied to close?

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Hi guys I'm new to this thread, loving it so far. Love your work guys, thank you. I'm a bit slow, is this the nitro setup? Do you guys (Dave &amp; co) use nitro mom indy v2 for the arrows on the renko? So, 1) MI Crosses (this is the heads up) 2) MOM is in the right location, below for buy, above for sells 3) Arrow comes in, open trade on close of candle Thanks guys Attached Image (click to enlarge)

The original Nitro thread started in the (now ditched to the recycle byn) C4 forum here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...81900&amp;page=155 Beginning on page 155 of that thread, you'll see the transition from C4 into Nitro (it's hundred of pages mind you, full of junk at the end because of the Edgetrader mess, I believe it's enough to read this thread).

Whee .. it's been a busy week, my son &amp; wife came into town and it turned out to be non-stop entertaining them! No time to trade, but I find that when I am forced not to trade but just have time to check the charts a few times a day it reminds me of the bigger picture and how much a role patience plays in all of this. Just waiting for the right setups to occur is 98% of the battle. Ferrari, remember also to factor in CORRELATION. We want to see at least 3 yen crosses moving together, then I always pick what looks like the strongest one. At least 2-3 good setups occur around each major market opening, I usually do Tokyo and NY open, from about 1 hour before until I have my pips or if I am not seeing good setups, I do nothing. But that is rare. It is also rare to lose once you learn how to do this. And although DaveW and some others will contribute their excellent charts as examples, nothing can replace continuous practice .. as we all have found. I look forward to some good trading tomorrow .. Thursdays are often pretty volatile.

--- 帖子 #656 ---
Post #1 of this thread should give you all the information you need to trade it .. the other thread is just past history, however some good things there include the numerous 'pep talks' and often scoldings from Edge, who first introduced us to this lucrative method of trading.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Thanks for your detailed description of how you trade DaveW. What I'm wondering is when you say form a "peak/trough", do you mean it has to form a new low or new high on the Momentum indicator? Or simply another point that is below or above 100.05/99.95. i.e. Let's assume EUR/JPY already has formed a brick (a long while ago) with a momentum reading of less than 99.95. If another brick is formed and the momentum is below 99.95 but not a lower momentum than the previous brick then does this count as an entry signal?

--- 帖子 #658 ---

Hi GrZack, I was wondering how things go with your project. Did you already solved the bug? Regards,

--- 帖子 #662 ---
I came across this post and thought it might benefit Nitro traders. It comes from Clockwork71 and his Silent Service thread (a great thread by the way, very similar to how I trade). This relative strength concept is unique to forex, and one that I had not considered but will definitely incorporate into my own trading. How does this apply to Nitro? Because GJ and EJ are key pairs in this system, when they are both moving in correlation, the EUR/GBP may provide further indication as to which is the strongest of the two. Hope it helps. --------------- "One thing that looks obvious to me now, but not when I started was this: All pairs have a function. Not all are trader-friendly, but they all mean something. Some pairs like EUR/USD are very, very liquid and are great for trading. Low spreads are typical, and it tends to move like an instrument that's traded by everyone. (As you would expect.) However, there are some other pairs that most of us ignore. One that I hardly ever trade is the AUD/NZD pair. However, it is always up on my platform. I find it to be one of the most useful pairs I watch. (I watch, not trade....typically.) I don't like the action on this pair, the spread sucks, and choppy would be putting it mildly. So what do I use it for? Relative Strength. Let's take a common example. Let's say that we are getting a long signal on both the NZD/USD and AUD/USD pair at the same time. This wouldn't be a surprise, as these two pairs tend to move in tandem. (A lot like the XXX/JPY pairs.) They are both driven by similar forces. So which one do you take? Pull up a AUD/NZD chart. It is this chart that will show you which one is stronger. If the AUD is gaining on the NZD, it stands to reason that it should You want to buy the strongest currency, and short the weakest. Of course the NZD/USD could go up as well, but normally will not get as far as the AUD/USD. (In these situations.) Just a thought. CW" ( http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=426 )

Still not trading, busy organising a big event for this weekend. Just watched this mornings action before I left, Once both the gbp and eur closed their blocks below the 99.95 then the eur was good for at least an 18 pip move.

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Pips there for the taking

--- 帖子 #669 ---
There's been a huge (+300 pips) down movement on most the JPY pairs. Anybody knows why?

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Don't know why but should have seen it coming though since I sometimes run backtest at night on ey when the market slows down in the evenings, to one year ago to the date of the next market opening day. I switched to trading usd pairs again this morning since I didn't see much price movement when I opened my yen charts. I think nitro works equally well on those pairs too with correlation so now I almost always have some fx stuff to do.

--- 帖子 #671 ---
I apologise for the absence, had a big event to organise for last weekend, but back trading again. The eur had closed it's block at 131.25 with the MI below 99.95 so waited for the gbp to do the same (aud was following down). When the gbp closed it's block at 142.65 I placed the Sell. On Oanda it went in at 131.20 and took profit at 131.13. Trade lasted 2 min 10 seconds. Price actually only went 10 pips from my entry so quite happy with my "Less is more" +7.

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Hey Dave, love you posts, thanks man. Is there any reason you haven't gone for a 100 mom line? Have you found your setup more benefitial to have it close over 100.05/99.95?

Guys, I'm really amazed with nitro. I am amazed at how quickly the system falls away and one can begin to trade in the zone. I get the feeling a lot of you guys have also touched on this experience with it. This video is talks about the zone, its a great watch just bare with it for the first few minutes. The elements of flow (from wikipedia): Clear goals (expectations and rules are discernible and goals are attainable and align appropriately with one's skill set and abilities). Moreover, the challenge level and skill level should both be high. [2] Concentrating and focusing , a high degree of concentration on a limited field of attention (a person engaged in the activity will have the opportunity to focus and to delve deeply into it). A loss of the feeling of self-consciousness , the merging of action and awareness. Distorted sense of time , one's subjective experience of time is altered. Direct and immediate feedback (successes and failures in the course of the activity are apparent, so that behavior can be adjusted as needed). Balance between ability level and challenge (the activity is neither too easy nor too difficult). A sense of personal control over the situation or activity. The activity is intrinsically rewarding , so there is an effortlessness of action. People become absorbed in their activity, and focus of awareness is narrowed down to the activity itself, action awareness merging . Inserted Video

I haven't posted for a while. Here's a quick 7 pips on E/J right at the London opening. Price stalled a bit and I was being cautious, but it easily got to 10 pips which is what my TP is set to by default. Do I assume that the quietness of the thread means everyone is too busy making money?

BTW, I'm now using Oanda for live trading and just a MT4 demo for charting. Thanks to DaveW for that. I really like Oanda's execution.

Missed the tail end of Frankfurt so had to wait for the Brits to finish their cup of tea but got in at 131.34 and out at 131.27 for +7 pips. Had to work for a whole 8 mins this time - need a nap now. Hi Slushfund. There are still a few of us oldies around. I have been busy for the last week but at it again full time. Oanda might not be the bee's knees if you are trading the News but for our sort of trading it suits me down to the ground. Spread on the eur/jpy is only 2.4 and if you wanted to trade the gbp/jpy (which I don't like) it is only 3.8 pips. The good thing with Oanda is that once you are constanly making succesful trades it is easy to compound, increasing the units you place on a trade to exactly your risk %age. I just made a small spreadsheet which I look at after each trade is complete and fill in the units on the trade box ready for the next one, that way I don't forget. I also leave the t/p and s/l blank so when I do press the button and the action is swift, by the time I pull up the Oanda box it has already run past my +7 and I close it at whatever seems good. if not then I set the t/p and s/l at that time. All the fancy stuff, trailing stops, resetting to B/E, etc. I leave to the experts as I notice that half the time I would have sat for an hour to get out at B/E. I would rather have the "Less" and patiently wait for it to become "More" Best of luck with your trading. Regards Dave W

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Hi Ferrari I have found that often the Mom will dip down to the 99.95 or climb to the 100.05 before retracing. The moves with momentum behind them will cause the Mom to climb/fall above/below these levels and when the block closes with the Mom above/below is the time to trade (if the correlation is good). All down to patience, observation, trial and error and mostly being tuned in to the behaviour of the three (in my case) pairs that I am monitoring. Often the eur will close above/below and you simply wait for the gbp. When that starts moving and completes it's block the momentum usually drags the eur along with it sufficient to get you +7 pips. On the face of it you could possibly write an ea to save you the trouble of having to hit a buy/sell button 4 times a day. However, an ea cannot differentiate between a hesitant move and a positive move, nor decide whether to take profit at +7, +14 or +2 by taking into account the type of PA. A couple of hours a day to make 2-4% doesn't seem much of a hardship. Once you reach the giddy heights of $20,000 in your account you should be making $400 - $800 a day, enough to live on if you keep it simple. You would have enough time to grow your own veggies, keep a couple of cows for their milk and meat and use the manure to power your eco-friendly ferrari (you need a conversion kit). Best of Luck Regards DaveW

Thanks DaveW, Looks great! Think I had everything but how to turn on the signal arrows. Looking forward to using it this evening. The way you set up the second momentum indi is pretty ingenious, signals are as good &amp; match up well or better than a T3 trix, or THV v3 trix. Like the channel zone 100.05 to 99.95 also, it helps you see very clearly when the market is ranging.

--- 帖子 #689 ---
Hey Dave what hours are you trading?

--- 帖子 #690 ---
Not a lot to say, +7 pips

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Hi Ferrari I only trade those times when the Stock Markrts open and the wheelers and Dealers are pushing the prices due, I suppose, to traders having to open and close positions to allow them to trade in the stocks. I therefore trade 9:30 onwards (Tokyo), 3:00 pm (Frankfurt), 4:00 pm (London) and 10:30 (New York), all times Tokyo. Trades can take anywhere between a couple of mins to 1/2 an hour depending on the PA. As I am retired, I am fortunate in that I have the time to do this sort of trading as I have nothing else to do with my time, apart from looking after my spouse who is disabled, taking care of the household chores, looking after the jungle in the back garden, cooking, cleaning, laundry, shopping, taking the dog for innumerable walks, as well as being on the Board of our ex-patriates club here in Yokohama and being responsible for all the events and entertainment for 1,000 or so members. The rest of the time I sit with my feet up and drink coffee. Still, cannot complain, I get to live a reasonable lifestyle and do not have to worry too much about the shenanigans of Obama and Brown though it is sad to see the mess the politicians have created. The price of rice and sushi rolls has come down so there is always a silver lining. Regards Dave W

+8 pips E/J

--- 帖子 #694 ---
Absolutely! In the trade I posted today on E/J, I usually like to wait until the brick after a Trix signal, but in this case there was a sudden strong price movement correlated over the 3 pairs so I took it for 8 pips. Price Action is King and overrules any indicator.

--- 帖子 #695 ---
is this method still working? I notice the drop in thread participation.

--- 帖子 #696 ---
Yeh I was waiting for the candle after the one you traded to close for a momentum signal, but that didn't happen in the end. Those trix signals look very interesting...

--- 帖子 #697 ---
Only you can answer that question by trading it yourself.

--- 帖子 #698 ---
After the initial PA it stalled a bit and got to a maximum drawdown of only 5 pips, but when it got back up to 8 I closed out because it seemed to be faltering. After that as you see it reversed and there is not good correlation now. If I don't get a set up within the next hour I'll call it a day or maybe look at NY later.

--- 帖子 #699 ---
that was not a newbie cry for help SF. I watched the circus that was edge trader's nitro trading for months. as soon as he was banned I noticed that all the master traders making pips after pips day after day just vanished. makes me think he had a lot more then one nick.

How do you figure 8:1 anyway?

--- 帖子 #705 ---
Of course, and don't forget the number of trading opportunities as well. Point is, for anyone who scalps (or just trades) for a living, the mental scars after watching hours (days/weeks) of hard earned pips get eaten up in one bad trade, can be debilitating. And in particular for scalpers as it is a more demanding pursuit. Each to their own, but it's a deal-breaker for me, and something that many don't consider till they're knee-deep, as they're too busy testing and analyzing setups. Been there, done that.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
I have had good days with Nitro....trading in demo mode. But i've experimented that "for me" this kind of scalping is too much stressful in the long run...so now i'm studying and practicing "real" price action on longer time frames...just a personal choice.

No opportunity at Frankfurt and London was a while before it came through. This way of trading may not be everyone's cup of tea but it suits me, pure PA action, the momentum indicators are there as an aid as they give me a heads up as to when the PA is liable to move and present a trading opportunity.

--- 帖子 #715 ---
Hey guys, I've been thinking about this method and really trying to break it down. I scribbled a few notes on my notepad and came up with this diagram which I redrew in paint which I attached below. I'm a firm believer in 2 things, 1. The teachings of Mark Douglas in Trading in the Zone 2. Having a methodolgy based on a market principle (in this case momentum) So we start with a mechanical, systematic and rule based approach and we progress towards trading in the zone. Consistancy and profitability is achieved in the mechanical stage. A lot of the technicals have already been shared, maybe we can share some of the price action charateristics that occur with our profitable trades (and our loosers too.) Maybe we can uncover some discernable patterns? I have read from a lot of people that the best trades occur in the smallest amount of time, you're in and out in less than a minute or so. Ferrari Attached Image

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Ferrari, Have you read the whole thread? There's plenty of top quality PA analysis performed on the nitro charts, particularly from the posts of asdf.

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Hey, I haven't is the short answer, there is so much info on renko, c4, nitro etc and so many posts I am very overwhelmed. My goal is to impliment a mechanical system based on a market principle as my foundation. I'm really looking for a return to simplicity. I read that the secret of renko is that you don't need anything else in the way of indicators, etc! This is the goal, but if I get stuck then I'll need a safety net, ie. a mechanical system. Ferrari

--- 帖子 #718 ---
It's good that you mention Trading in the Zone which is my favourite trading book. But Ferrari, don't get too analytical about this. Everything you need to know is on Page 1 of this thread. We have some basic rules, but it's the exercise of some discretion that is needed to capture pips. And that needs practice. That's all. It's not rocket science. Just sit and wait for the signal and when all pairs are in correlation there will come a moment when all pairs sync and move together. You'll miss it if you blink. The discretion is needed to get the precise timing. The hardest part is to know when to go with the price move or to wait for a retrace first. This is beyond analysis. You just need practice. This method is so boring but it seems to have a very high win probability. But I'm not here to be entertained. This is not my primary method. I trade the H1 charts, but I could see this becoming the way I trade. I think DaveW is already there. I've looked at a lot of scalping systems, but so far, Nitro gets my vote. I'm not a defender of this method. I'm just trying it like others are and I like what I see. I'm not concerned about those who think the R:R sucks or whatever. I tire of those who are always asking about other traders win rates without trying it themselves or criticize the method without even reading the thread. Sorry, I'm ranting. Ferrari, you are asking sensible questions and now you are getting results. That's great.

SlushFund. You hit the nail on the head. This is boring. Frankfurt/London was a 2 hr wait until they trade was there. Ny was a 18 min wait and the trade closed in 14 mins. Once you get the hang of this type of trading it becomes stress free as once the correlation and PA momentum is there together then you can take the trade with confidence. Yes occasionally it isn't going to hit your t/p and you may suffer a loss but literally 9 times out of 10 is is going to do exactly what it did tonight and all the other times I have posted. For those that are trading Forex for the thrill of it all, good luck. Those who wish to make this a way of putting a little jam on the bread and butter then everything you need is in this thread. Good Luck Dave W

How to determine correlation among the pairs? What to look for? - Renko brick forming in the same direction? at the same time? Or once a brick is formed on one pair, wait for it to form in another pair and than take a trade? Can you explain what to look for to determine corelation?

--- 帖子 #724 ---
All of it actually. PA should be in the same directon for all [most] pairs, at a given time. Normally, once a brick is formed on one pair (or better said, once direction is clear and one pair is ahead) you wait for it to move on another pair and then if momentum is high you take the trade. At trader's discretion. Remember you are the one that through observation + intuition, will determine when to enter the trade. There's plenty of info about this subject in this thread, I suggest you read it, re-read it and practise it

Analyst All you need to know about this trading strategy is contained in the pages of this thread. There is no substitute for some concentrated effort on your part if you are interested enough to do it. I assure you it is worth it. But do yourself - and us - a favour and do the hard yards - read the thread please and then ask questions which I'm sure many of the contributors to this thread will be happy to answer.

--- 帖子 #727 ---
I have been sneaking a few extra pips on each trade. If you have tails on the renko bricks, you can observe that in most cases the PA retraces from the opening price of the brick. If the trade is going to be successful, the brick is going to be 10 pips in profit from the open. However, as the PA slips a few pips (you can usually count on 2-3 at least) from the open price, I add this to the 10 of the expected brick and still set my TP at the close of the traded brick ie my TP is 12 pips. If the retracement does not occur, I just pass the trade - I don't chase it. There are plenty more. I set my SL at 21 pips below (above) the open price of the brick. By sneaking a few extra pips, it also reduces the potential loss. I never let it get that far anyway before I pull the plug as it becomes obvious when the trade has gone sour. This has been working quite well - the hit rate on this strategy is fantastic. It does require patience and does not like it if you 'manufacture' the trade. I have also been looking at the USD pairs - EU, GU and AU. There seems to be pretty good correlaton there also and the same rules apply.

keep at it, i scalp and it's a matter of getting your eye in to the new price pace your watching. if this is not compatible with your personality then maybe try a higher time frame? well it's good to see people making pips with this, as in the end it looked to be some kind of set up to rip new traders. good trading all

Think someone recently mentioned the importance of the speed at which renko bricks are forming in regards to nitro trading. Lou mentioned this indi before but unless you visted the programming section on renko charts you probably missed it. RenkoAm shows the length of time it takes for each brick to form, a long bar may indicate a trend change is about to take place. Short bars means tread is moving at a steady clip and not as likely to change anytime soon. Lou mentioned that he thought it was an even better indi for renko than momentum. Which would make sense since indi's follow price action &amp; not the other way around although I haven't tried trading nitro without a momentum indi of some kind on my charts yet, but should be worth a try at least on demo. The other indi I attached was made by Limsylz for FrankenPip's method. Just thought of trying it on renko charts tonight as I was thinking it would be nice if there was an indi to show just about how close a renko bricks was to finishing up &amp; I remembered this one. I've got 5 pip bricks on the chart so a new brick pops out at about 1.1 for those. Haven't tried it on 10 pip bricks yet, but guess they would pop out at near 2.1. Gives a nice numerical visual of what's going on, changes color red if negative pips &amp; blue if positive pips are going into the brick. Anyway not trying to make any major changes to nitro, as it is a pretty solid method as is, just throwing these indi's on the table as they may help traders new to nitro.

--- 帖子 #733 ---
didn't he say later it wasn`t working in commercial renkos? http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=204

--- 帖子 #734 ---
bali2002, Thanks for catching that, I'd forgotten he said that. The indis may need more demo forward testing &amp;/or code work before being used live. That gives me a idea though, wouldn't it be nice to just have a simple indi that displays the number of bricks being formed per, min, 5min, 15 min etc? That probably wouldn't be very hard to code, but don't really know since I don't code yet.

--- 帖子 #735 ---
45, Have you checked the other renko thread, which is more suited for indi traders? http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=193547 I think that may suit your style better. This thread was intended for traders that want to focus mainly on price action, not on indis: As clearly defined on Post 1 of this thread: Nitro Scalping is a trading strategy using RENKO bars instead of candles (although some still use candles). We try to stay focused on PA (price action) instead of relying on indicators, which nearly always lag price. Our goal is to trade pure PA capturing 3-10 pips per trade. Using this "less is more" strategy, many are saying they are making consistent profits in forex for the first time ever.

... a collection of all the graphics on Price Action from both the threads, by asdf...a gem!

--- 帖子 #737 ---
ok, I'll look at it this weekend. Never been one to be accused of using too few indicators before. Often got flames on "C4 for poor traders", for trying to add indis where none were needed. So guess that could be a complement as far a trading nitro style goes. Can't use this one very often because my old pc needs a major upgrade or replacement, but how many indis can you count on this chart? lol

--- 帖子 #738 ---
Yeh man, Edge allued to this too, the answer lies in simplicity. Nitro is a price action system after all. Awesome!

--- 帖子 #739 ---
I've had a week holiday. The EA ran all week. The wins were great, the losses were awful. I'm not sure that "the original Nitro" is/was real, or it will work on the current Metatrader platform. Anyway, the current modified verson 2 (my EA) is much better than version 2 or version 1. I'm having problem programming version 3, which should be "MUCH better" than the other version (crossed fingers). I don't give up, I WON'T give up. Take care, GrZack ps.: Fish repaint couldn't be solved. Main problem: the 'moving' 0 line. If I could find the solution to FIX the 0 line... that would be great.

--- 帖子 #740 ---
Hi asdf Great post What brick size do u use ? 5 or 10 ? smC4 Scalper set to 2 or 3 ? I would like to PM you , but it's not possible . Can u pls contact me. Tks david4u

--- 帖子 #741 ---
Glad it helped. Be sure to see Jigsaw's follow up analysis as it helps clarify what exactly was going on. As for brick size, I've only experimented with 10 pips, though I don't use renko for live trading. I also don't use indicators other than hand-drawn lines. As for PMs, I prefer to keep all contact public. If you have a question, please post it. There are some excellent traders here who can provide some valuable insights.

--- 帖子 #742 ---
I just love renko and scalping, so count me in! I coded a profit_loss protection for this few pips scalping. The problem is that trailing doesnt work with such small TPs, so I made this like a hidden SL and TP. External variables are; extern double TotalStopLoss = -20; This will close all trades if you are in -20$ loss!!! extern double LotMultiplier = 1; For each 0.1 lot multiplier is 1....so if you are playing with 0.2 lots, multiplier will be 2 etc..... extern bool CloseHalfLots = True; You must use round lots like 2.4.6 etc if you want EA to close half of them at CloseHalfAtprofit. It will also put you other lots part into breakeven. extern double CloseHalfAtProfit = 10; Profit level when the CloseHalfLots kicks in. The profit lock work at these levels; if profit &gt;= 3.0 LOCK= 1$ if profit &gt;= 6.0 LOCK= 3$ if profit &gt;= 8.0 LOCK= 4$ if profit &gt;= 10.0 LOCK= 6$ if profit &gt;= 14.0 LOCK= 8$ if profit &gt;= 20.0 LOCK= 12$ if profit &gt;= 30.0 LOCK= 18$ if profit &gt;= 40.0 LOCK= 25$ if profit &gt;= 50.0 LOCK= 35$ if profit &gt;= 60.0 LOCK= 45$ if profit &gt;= 80.0 LOCK= 60$ if profit &gt;=100.0 LOCK= 80$ EA will also give you a text masages about locked profit and closing! ASDF, your explanations comes from experience, and you certainly know how flow works, you hit the nail on the head bro! Keep it up. Ill try to help further with some thoughts in the future. I dont use anything else except renko , but im using multi box sizes to keep a track about stronger SR levels and trends. I also dont use multiple pairs, cos from my experience this wont help you much, It will only overload your brain and keep you out of the things that are realy important! But hey, thats me.......... Regards

--- 帖子 #743 ---
Hi Forexflash Your posting is interesting but I'm afraid there are aspects which I do not understand. First I hope this is not considered wide of the mark on this thread - it is pure Renko (with deviation)! You are proposing a money management EA which is a good idea but I do not understand the chart accompanying it. It apears to be a M5 chart but what size brick are you using. I must say that I have not seen a M5 chart with such regular trending! What are the plots on the right hand side of your chart? Are they significant to the main plot? I would love some explanation of what you are doing - with thanks.

--- 帖子 #744 ---
Forexflash, that's a great multiple timeframe setup. Thanks for posting it. Scartree, it looks like he uses a base chart of 4 pip renko blocks with charts of 8, 16, 32, and 64 pip blocks on the side.

--- 帖子 #745 ---
Something about renko; Say you're using a 5 point box. A green box forms. Go long. Price immediately reverses, confirmation that trend was wrong and a red box appears. You exit. That's 10 points you've lost right? In reality its going to depend upon what time frame your chart is set for. Your charting program is only going to draw boxes based upon the point difference between the closing price of the previous time period and the current one. In other words, if you are using a 10 min. chart, the program will only draw boxes based upon the closing price differences between the 10 min. intervals. Prices may have spiked or dropped significantly during that 10 min. interval, but the closing prices may be close to each other, in which case your charting program is not going to draw boxes illustrating the highest highs or the lowest lows. In addition, its not going to draw those boxes until the 10 min. time frame has elapsed, regardless of how much the market has moved. So, it is possible to lose more than 2* the box size. The only way to have your charting program draw an accurate depiction of the market using Renko boxes is to use a very short time frame . I personaly dont use renko that shows history....I dont trust them. I have a tick renko wich draws bricks only from live price changes, and it is not an ofline version. Do not take my previous chart for granted, cos Im still experimenting, and that is not how I trade. I dont want to hijack this thread cos my style is different form originaln nitro rules a lot! But if somebody is interested, I could drop some thoughts. This is a pic of my original system; Regards

--- 帖子 #746 ---
And would very much appreciate your help. I've started a new thread. I'm trying to find &amp;/or further develop an existing ea to work much better on renko charts.

Please visit it here, &amp; post your ideas &amp;/or comments: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=200152 Thank you, jt in nc PS: Speaking of renko chart, the LastViking, just posted an updated free version 3.1.

Could someone relate a little information about Swingman's Renko Scalper candles? I'm attaching the latest version I could find. What does the inside color indicate? What does the dot indicate? What is the usefulness of the candle? Could you post an example? Thank you. Murph

--- 帖子 #753 ---
I don't know if this will help you. I have been using the C4Scalper Candles_v3.1 The dots indicate a higher close orlower close The colored candles indicate green higher highs and close higher, I use the Fractal indicator to aler me with the swings in the market I also use HMA Color nrp and a close within or out of the MA to indicate change Draw a line at the close of the midnight hourly candle and only take trades going up above the line or take trades going down below the line. Use the Fractal indicator to alert you of the change in direction Watch the Renko candles change color and set up with at least one lower close or higher close set up Some ideas to help Good Luck

--- 帖子 #754 ---
You will notice with the Sm Candles laid over the brincks that you have the smcandles colored, maybe red or green even though you have higher close brick formation. Even though you have a higher or lower close dot and brick the color of the candle inside the brick can and does remain the color of the trend. this can dloes help you ro remember that the move may be a pullback and to wait for a continuation of the intial trend. That can keep you out of trouble going the wrong way.

--- 帖子 #755 ---
If you watch the Renko candles and the smcandles overlaidon the brick The brick changes direction, the smcandle dot show a change, and the dot will indicate say a higher high But, the sm body will remain red in a blue brick at that point wait until you see the sm body of the candle turn blue with a blue dot and close Enter at the close of that candle as the trend is now to continue You could use a lower close to get out or an oscillator like Stochastics to indicate oversold conditions. You can apply all the knowledge you know about trading and knowing, for instance you oscillate in a trend move to help you with the Renko trading style Non of us are market mind readers Keep it simple but use what you need

--- 帖子 #756 ---
SusanD – thank you so much for reactivating the thread. I was afraid it completely died. I’m sure there are a lot of traders trading NITRO successfully up there, including myself. It doesn’t seem possible there’s nobody – out of hundreds of original Edge thread followers – who still trades the system. Please keep posting – it was really weird feeling, that I’m the only one who considers NITRO a profitable system.

--- 帖子 #757 ---
Hey jackal: I just get bored as I trade alone at present. I think the Nitro and Renko have a gret placement in trading. They are pure price That being said, I don't think this means you do not to any indicators or helpful trading supportive "things" with it. At present, I am working on some approaches to using the setup with the nitro along with some other strategy approaches I have learned Coming along nicely I will post things as I see they work with the Nitro approach from Edge mostly Edge was very smart about a lot of trading issues. Too Bad. A lot of people with character and personality issues are still brilliant thinkers. They are different issues. I am at the point of comparaing a lot of traders approaches and MM. Put fractal on your charts make them bigger at 3 or 4 thickness put the Hama Color nrp at 12. Make the MA thick so you can see it and it catches your eye for the markt movement. I put the sm Candles as Edge said, they are vey smart to put on these Renkos

--- 帖子 #758 ---
Sorry for the long disappearing act. At a certain point I felt I just had to back off for a bit from all conversations and re-group internally and figure out exactly what I was doing and why I also began to get pretty upset about the fact that a few people (NOT on this thread) that I would call "whiners, complainers and losers" managed to get Edge kicked off the forum thus depriving hundreds of serious traders of his extensive trading knowledge AND ability to teach others. Before meeting Edge this summer I was an expert chartist .. but I could not make money trading. He taught me HOW to TRADE. And yes, it is almost 100% about money management. But because a tiny group of people felt that he had somehow caused them to lose the immense sums of ... gasp! .. $1500! he needed to be chased off the forum. I've lost THOUSANDS due to following bad advice or in some cases bad people. Do I cry or seek revenge? No, it was I who made the decision to listen to losers so I pay the price .. cost of doing business .. move on &amp; learn from the experience. I'd like to write more about this, but it would be better in another thread more suited to general discussion. As to renko trading, I have switched back to C4 because .. as much as I love renko, until I can afford to trade with TradeStation, I am afraid to trust even the MQL script .. too often I would log in to MT4, see the bars one way, then find that they were not forming properly and not reflecting true price action. This only happened occasionally, but enough that it bothered me. One of many things I learned from Edge is to find a system that fits YOU and then focus &amp; learn it inside &amp; out and stop chasing the latest greatest indicators. So I went back to C4, modified it slightly and have been trading it for I guess about 2 months .. with growing success as I learn all of its nuances. It works like a charm as long as I remember another of Edge's directives: don't ever break (or even bend) your own rules! I'd been told a gazillion times that trading is about discipline, but somehow the ways I was told just never took root .. finally with Edges's "drill sergeant" attitude, I got it .. I understood what 'discipline' meant and more importantly I saw how the lack of it was the cause of my lack of trading success .. even though I could nail the moves as a chartist and double a demo account in 3-4 weeks without half trying! So now I go into the ring every day and do battle with .. myself. My charts are great &amp; show me stellar trade setups several times a day. Whether this translates into real account growth depends entirely on me following my own rules. It's getting better! I'll continue to participate here whenever I have something that may be of value. I agree with SlushFund that most likely many Nitro traders are just quietly &amp; successfully trading now &amp; don't feel much need to talk about it. One thing about Edge's teaching .. when you focus on YOUR system &amp; learn it inside &amp; out there comes a time when you really have nothing more to say about it so by definition a thread like this one will either die out or if enough new people join in, there will be a steady stream of people passing through and hopefully enough old-timers left to guide them. But we miss Edge. I know he's out there somewhere.... Muchas gracias amigo, y vayas con Dios

Hello Everyone: These are just some tradng ideas with Renko and the smcandles. I took a seminar and this one trading used the Fractals They appear on say the 15 TF then you see a candle close in that direction It can be the one with the Fracal or the next one. The sm candles will have the dot appear on the first low close or high close after the fractal You can apply these fractals on the Renkos I also found a Fractal Indicator that put the Fractal from the Daily on down to the 15 min TF in different colors so you can see on one chart if you are trading on the 5 min say if you are trading in the direction of the hour or 15 mikn or whatever you would need. Nifty really. Put on the five minute chart you would always know wher you ar headed. Auslanco used to say that if you traded in the direction of the four hour and the hour matching, you get make up to 500 ish pips. Also try taking the fractal set ups and close in the direction of a line that would indicate what the close of the midnight candle for the this trading was. It will be very interesting to se this I have been using the 15 min with fractals and stochastics main hma 12 to guide me on the renko candles. If I have a cleanr match on the fifteen minute you can see the candle begin to go for the move on the renko. You know that feeling the move is over when you are sure it is starting. They seem like a good match to get you in and out before that

Hi I use the same template on the 15 min chart with the multicolored Fractals. They don't show up the same on the Renko as they do on the regualr tf's The white line is the close number of the 06:00 hour of the day. This line is very important as I trade going up on the Fractal and the higher close above the line and trade down with a down Fractal and lower close candle. Many times the hourly Blue Fractal is pointing down and then take every down red fifteen min fractal that agrees with the stochastics down. The Tudor Girl I use to watch the march up or down the Pivots Just some trading thought and things I am learning.

It is sad that Edge got exposed and ran out of here. There are a lot of newbies who have signed up since he left, who need defrauding- a lot of new sheep for him to sheer. Indeed.

I hope here is the Colored Multi Time Frame Fractal Indi If you trade the tf's included in the indicator they are color coded If you trade: Say the 5m tf, then put the regular Fractal Indicator on your chartand color it say yellow then the other tf's 15, H1H4 and d will be on there as they appear as well. I fyou take all the lower tf fractal from the Blue fractal when it changes - go in the same direction only Trade below the 06:00 line, in the direction of the blue fractal when every red fractal goes down. Try to have Stochastics or Macd or Trix or something to verify. Use the smcandles to help show you the lower close after the fractal or higher Get in after the first change candle

Do you know if the TudorGirl indy repaints?? Thanks Mombone

--- 帖子 #770 ---
I have seen it repaint up to 5 bars several times

--- 帖子 #771 ---
Do not use the Tudor Girl to enter trades. I use it to show a sustained move that matches with Stochastic movement mostly. It is a good visual for the march up and down the Pivot Points. It does repaint, as most indicators do. that is why you need a trend indicator and an oscillator to guide you with your trades as the market moves.

--- 帖子 #772 ---
I was thinking if you want to use the Tudor Girl Watch price begin say to go into a down move. If the Tudor Girl switches color on the chart or on a Renko chart it will alert you to think it will probably have a good change to go to the next pivot or your s or r. Tells you how much movement you will have or have left maybe. That is how I use it.

what's happened here? this used to be the hottest system on FF with 50 new posts a day. every time I came in here it was non stop money making. why as soon as edge goes the thread stops?

It does not matter. Good Luck To Everyone and Have A Great Holiday

--- 帖子 #776 ---
Hi Can somebody explain me the difference between indies please?

--- 帖子 #777 ---
Can you be more specific with exact names of the indicators. I followed the whole C4 thread all the way into the recycle bin &amp; into the newer Nitro threads as they were being written. I have tried &amp; used each &amp; every version of Dxtrade's indicators so think I may be able to help you out. But since he posted about five different version of each indicator I'll need more info to do a proper comparison. In mho, I think most scalping methods are doomed from the get go because of the very bad return on investment, risk verus reward etc. Besides unless you scalp via ea, it's very hard work, &amp; if you trade risking 15 pips just to get 5, &amp; you have one losers, your next 4 trades must be winners just to get back into the black. I think most the original followers of C4/Nitro are still around, just not scalping as much as they used to if still scalping at all. Also think a lot ended up on the MTF Trix thread, a few went to Lou's renko trading threads etc, or just quit posting on FF all together &amp;/or are now full time traders, not thread posters. Who knows, would be nice if there could be a reunion of some of the old C4/Nitro posters here or on one of the other c4/Nitro threads to see what everyone has been up to lately. I've personally been working with Petar_Serbia on a very simple yet effective, non scalping method on his thread, (RTFG), Renko Trading for Gamers . &amp; also started my own thread which has finally helped in the creation of a brand new ea, with a lot of help from a guy name Peter from aud. So don't really think C4/Nitro has died, it has just branched out, &amp; changed as most people &amp; markets tend to do. PS: By the way you'll usually still see this one on my screens shots from time to time. DxTrade added the custom CCI indi at my request, so he attached my ff screen name to it. Think I still prefer it to a lot of the other indis he made, since it is customizable. You can change the ADX period, Trix time frame, etc in it under the input tabs, before or after you attach it to a chart. I usually set the Trix to 60 or 240 mins to see if I'm trading with or against the longer time frames.

Thanks DXtrade Nitro Dashboard, DXTrade Indicator are exact names A little to my self i am scalper and prefer renko last time. a make many small trades per day and win in most cases I tried to use DXtrade indicators, but i can not see the difference between last versions of them

--- 帖子 #779 ---
Can you upload the DXTrade Indicator here? I don't see it under the paper clip, &amp; don't see it in my indi folder. Reason I asked for exact name was because i see about 7 to 9 versions of the DXTrade Info indi, but guess that's not one you wanted to compare anyway.

--- 帖子 #780 ---
I have read C4 complete, this is last version uploaded

--- 帖子 #781 ---
It seems very strange indeed. I was glad at first the thread was reactivated. Then, strangely enough, I read this idiotic "Edge we love you" post and noticed Tudor Girl (Tudor Boy???) indicator being promoted. I have already been banned from this thread for saying that it seems natural that scam artists like Edge should be punished. You can ban me again, 4Star. I don't really want to be part of Edge defending team. Regarding the system, it looks promising if you have your own MM rules. It's simply impossible to make money with the system in it's original form with 6:1 R:R.

NITRO Scalping for serious traders This means i will have to scalp with nitro boost and pre-requisite have to be a serious trader?

--- 帖子 #783 ---
No, pre-requisite is to accept, and not criticize Edgetrader, Tudor Girl and other scam artists.

I do not know them, but looking at screen shots posted here it seems like a difficult system. Maybe have to read all the post here in weekend to understand this strategy.

renko charts 4 pip block size hma 8,3,3 parabolic sar 0.1/0.2 trix entry rules: reverse brick, hma correct color, trix, and par sar dot. usually par sar dot appears last. screenshot attached, the vertical lines do show entries, first 3 were profitable, the next 2 with losses, last one a winner. how could I avoid the 4th and 5th fake-out ? any ideas ? without making the entry rules so lagging that most of the price move will be missed ?

--- 帖子 #786 ---
Sorry to tell you that you can't... I've been part of the original C4 thread and Nitro Thread, I've tried every sort of indy with Renko...but there is no indy that can avoid losses, because you must understand the Renko concept. Renko lags...it shows you what the price have already done... Indicator lags...we all know this!! So..you are using a lagging indy over a lagging price...resulting in a double legging thing...IMHO

--- 帖子 #787 ---
I do agree that no system will give 100% winners.... Just thought if anyone might have a bit better filter.... Maybe Fxfish ???? Will forward test and record it to see how it performs. And I do remember Tudorgirl and her/his statements. Like 20 trades - 18 winners. Phenomenal performance. How did she filter out trades ?

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Probably you don't know...but Tudorgirl was a fake...and her results were a fake too...and I have serious doubts that Edgetrader's Nitro was reality... FxFish repaints the past...is totally useless..but if you want to try it you can do it... Trust me...no indy can filter renko fakes..find an indy that can "predict a 10pips move" and I will pay you to have it

I no longer use renko either, except as a reference but do not trade off of it. It's a useful extra tool and I'm glad I found out about it. Steve Nison has a book, Beyond Candlesticks which explains renko in more detail. I'm sorry there are people who feel Edge scammed them but all I know is, he taught me how to trade and helped flip me from a non-profitable trader to a profitable one! He had much to offer and helped a lot of people last summer. As to TG, she/he fooled all of us! Pretty funny in retrospect. Plenty of people have scammed me or otherwise led me astray .. but I move on &amp; don't look back. The goal of becoming a profitable trader is way too important to waste any time on bemoaning the past!

--- 帖子 #791 ---
This is what seems to be keeping me out of some trouble. TopTrend - 8,2,1.0,1,1,1000,true Trix - 4,EEE,C LWMA - 14(weighted close) LWMA - 5(weighted close) LWMA - 2(weighted close) If Renko block breaks TopTrend only trade in direction of trend, basically 5 LWMA cross of 14 LWMA. Possible reentry 2 LWMA cross of 5 LWMA. Trade only to make 2% of account ( 5-10 pips). The Hardest part was learning patience and not force the trade.

--- 帖子 #792 ---
ff-friend, I hadn't forgotten about your question, kinda busy coming up with a new scalp method for another friend's students. I thought I may be able to answer your question, but after taking another look at both I'm not so sure that I can. I'm not sure what the SMI input settings Period Q, R, S, &amp; signal 3 numbers represent in the DxTrade Nitro indi, but maybe DxTrade will answer himself, I just sent him a pm &amp; he only posted on another thread about 3 hrs ago so maybe we will hear back from him soon on this. later, 45 PS: I know I said I don't like scalping anymore, but it's for them not me.

Hi guys sorry for the late reply... I have a huge problem: My fckuing windows laptop crashed and with him all mq4 files. Normally I'm using a mac. And there I only have the ex4 files left. What I can tell you is the SMI settings which are: 2,10,2,3 Hope that helps... Uli

--- 帖子 #799 ---
SMI, is that Smooth Moving or Swing Man Indi Trix?

--- 帖子 #800 ---
Neither... that's the indi Chris used and changed and was an indexed momentum indicator. Chris_B knows more about this one... just tried to use it to filter the Trix

--- 帖子 #801 ---
I see thanks a lot. Now I'll try to track down Chris too. lol

--- 帖子 #802 ---
Hi... that indy was SMI (Stochastic Momentum Index) but this file contains a bug so you can use IndexedMomentumK...it's the same but it works.. My indy was just calling this indy to put the arrows.. Hope this helps

--- 帖子 #803 ---
Thanks for the quick reply Chris! Just goes to show everyone, no such thing as a dumb question esp if it gets posted in the right thread. A few more quick questions, I think. Does DxTrade Nitro indi need either one or both of these indis in the indis folder to work properly or is the code for them already included and built into the one, "DxTrade Nitro indi"? When you say SMI has a bug, exactly what do you mean? I didn't see any errors or warnings when compiling the SMI code you uploaded. Does that mean the "DxTrade Nitro indi", has a bug in it too? If so, wonder if DXTrade would mind reworking his indi to call for the IndexedMomentumK.ex4 instead? But read his post earlier about his laptop crash so may not be a good time to ask him about that right now. Can someone remind me what Renko brick sizes is supposed to be used when trading Nitro style? &amp; Has anyone tired using ATR to determine renko brick sizes to use yet? Maybe one more thing Chris, would you recommend the defaut SMI settings in DXtrade's nitro dashboard be used in the other indi you posted, &amp; if so on which renko brick size &amp; with or without wicks, would you recommend?

--- 帖子 #804 ---
I will try to recode the Indi... just give me some time. If I remember right the SMI is coded in my indi... but not sure anymore. I just remember that I let the smi away later as it didn't help anything in getting better signals. Bricks are 10 Pips

--- 帖子 #805 ---
No hurry, as you know someone else brought up the original question on the comparison of your two indis which on the surface they look identical, and if one has a bug in it that needs to be fixed probably wouldn't be a bad idea to do so since a lot of new trades maybe trying to use it. PS: Below is another copy of message I sent you via PM. ----- You must already know this since you made the indicator, but I've been trading renko charts pretty much exclusively since last summer &amp; noticed that all the best indis on renko charts give the same entries anyway if the right settings are found for them. So that really only leaves us with ATR &amp; Mom as a filter &amp; perhaps Lou's AM renko indi which gives you an idea about how fast rekno bars are being made if scalping, &amp; Lou's new Renko S/R indi which I think is great for finding open spaces between S/R, and breakouts. I've only recently started to understand the usefulness of ATR with renko and noticed that you placed two ATR periods into your DxTrade info 7 indi. Was wondering if you would please explain why you did this &amp; how to make the most use of it, period setting etc for 5, 10, 15, 20 pip rekno bricks etc. Also was wondering are you still trading on renko charts, &amp; if not why? Later, 45 jt in nc PS: Have a great weekend. I'll attach the indi here so if anyone else wants to see it on their chart they won't have to comb through the old C4 thread etc to find it.

--- 帖子 #806 ---
OK guys, I have a question: why not keep it simple? By that I mean, if you look at any Renko (10) chart, it shows that you could buy anytime you have a blue bar, and sell any time you have a red bar, and make a killing. No other indicators needed, no multiple time-frames, just the renko bars. Now because it looks so simple that usually means I'm missing something. So what am I missing? If you open a 1H GBP/USD and put "RenkoFX" custom indicator on the chart, you see perfect trends (with a few mixed bars) that would net you hundreds and thousands of pips simply by buying blue and selling red. So, who can help a Renko-Newbie understand how these bars are drawn and why it would not make sense to keep it simple?

--- 帖子 #807 ---
Hi guys the problem with the indicators I made last summer is that we had 2 systems... C4 and Nitro. So only the latest of my indicators are making sense on Renko charts as it is a completely different way of coding. I still have most of my templates still on Renko as I like the timeless way of clear candles. And Nitro... fake or not... is in it's basic idea and slightly adapted... still working fine for me. ATR is the best example of the Renko limits: there is no range on renko charts... or, explained differently... the range of a renko candle is the brick size, so always the same. That's why ATR on Renko is useless and is showing always the same value for any ATR. The mentioned indi was still for the guys trading C4. And Dreamliner... you are absolutely right!!!! This is valid for "normal" charts as well btw... the simpler and cleaner a chart the better. I sometimes see charts here in FF where you don't even see the PA anymore and the chart looks like a painting of a drunken Picasso. That is over-analysing at it's best and you will never be able to take a decision as 15 of the 30 indis on the charts are telling you the opposite of the 15 others. Take care guys... Uli

--- 帖子 #808 ---
Hey Dreamliner, I'm not trying to complicate trading on renko charts, I know it can be as simple of trading off of every 2.5 to 3 renko brick if your not trying to scalp, or right after a renko turning point as you said. Guess I'm just trying to fill in a few missing puzzle pieces of the where C4 transitioned in to Nitro. I think if you want to try using the RenkoFx indi on one hour charts etc you may want to look at this short thread if you haven't already. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=100785 I think the main problem with the indi is finding the right brick sizes to best represent the time frame you want to be trading off of with it, but as the thread states best to put it, and that goes for any other renko indi, script, or renko chart generating ea on 1 min chart. So how do you get a good representation of a 1 hr chart off a 1 min chart? Use ATR, or one of DXtrade info indis to display ATR in plain numbers X1. Problem with the ReknoFx indi is that it's input is in points instead of pips. I've &amp; others I'm sure have messed with indi inputs on more than one occasion and has as yet not been able to get an accurate representation as like what we now have as a true renko chart in MT4. I think a point is equal to 100 pips if memory serves, but that didn't seem to help me very much last time I tried the RenkoFx indi. &amp;Now that I know how to get renko charts into a backtest simulator I have even less use for this renko indi, but if you or anyone else manages to get the RenkoFx indi to work properly I'd still like to hear about it. PS: DxTrade your saying ATR stays the same for any two different periods on renko charts right, &amp; thus has no real value on renko charts whatsoever? later, 45

--- 帖子 #809 ---
ATR is "Average True Range" = the candle size of the last x candles. That is to measure the market speed and activity. A Renko candle has always the range you give it... 10 pips in my case. So the range is always 10 whatever period you choose. To measure ATR on a Renko chart you need a different calculation of bricks per 5 minutes or so while calculating the renko brick formation time. Useless in my opinion as you can then use directly normal candles.

--- 帖子 #810 ---
Dreamliner, you are quite riight, all the indicators do in renko is confirm what the blocks are telling you, As an exercise try playing with all the indicators on 1 chart, eg indexed momentum, stochastic, macd, etc, play with the settings and they will all tell show you in the 1 block that the direction has changed and give an entry signal. The key with renko is to confirm that their is intensity ( or momentum) in the direction of the movement. Otherwise you can get lots of false and expensive signals and getting onto the trends is not easy if the market is choppy. This is where I think a volume and time related ratio indicator (against a moving average for the block size) would be better but other than wattarattar (?) which doesn't work well with renko I don't know of a volume / intensity indicator that does this. If anyone knows of an indicator that does this or wants to code something I think I can specify what I think will work. I also think fibs and resistance line may be more relevant with renko for looking for reversal and momentum rgds Peter

--- 帖子 #811 ---
Thank you, I guess I'll just have to watch this live, because looking at the charts you simply cannot go wrong by buying on blue and selling on red. I know there has to be more to it.

--- 帖子 #812 ---
I still don't get it, because looking at the Renko charts you don't need any indicators at all, ever. Buy blue, sell red. Obviously there is more to it than this, I just haven't had a chance to watch them live. Will do that Monday and I'm sure will have a whole different understanding of Renko charts.

--- 帖子 #813 ---
You need to read or test a bit what Renko is. A brick is only red or blue once it is finished... not before. So if you have let's say 5 red bricks down and a 10 pip brick size to get a blue brick PA has to move 20 pips up before it is forming a blue one. If you enter long there you can have another 20 pips down before forming a red brick again and that costs you 20 and some pips. That makes 30 pips range for every brick before it is formed and closed. Lot of stuff. So you need a whatsoever confirmation before deciding in which direction it goes next. And depending on the pair a 20-40 pip move as confirmation can be a lot and may be over fast. You can obviously reduce the brick size... but then you are back to a tick chart after a while. Just food for thought

--- 帖子 #814 ---
---------------------------------- This is how ATR works per MT4 help files: Average True Range Average True Range Technical Indicator (ATR) is an indicator that shows volatility of the market. It was introduced by Welles Wilder in his book "New concepts in technical trading systems". This indicator has been used as a component of numerous other indicators and trading systems ever since. Average True Range can often reach a high value at the bottom of the market after a sheer fall in prices occasioned by panic selling. Low values of the indicator are typical for the periods of sideways movement of long duration which happen at the top of the market and during consolidation. Average True Range can be interpreted according to the same principles as other volatility indicators. The principle of forecasting based on this indicator can be worded the following way: the higher the value of the indicator, the higher the probability of a trend change; the lower the indicator’s value, the weaker the trend’s movement is. Calculation True Range is the greatest of the following three values: difference between the current maximum and minimum (high and low); difference between the previous closing price and the current maximum; difference between the previous closing price and the current minimum. -------------------------- I see some aspect of what your saying ATR is in this definition of ATR, but when I put two totally different ATR indi periods, I'm not seeing getting the current brick size value back on either one, &amp; both show different numbers. Could you look at ATR with two different periods on renko charts again? This screen shot shows what the current ATR value is marked by the red horizontal lines. This is on 15 pip renko brick charts and neither ATR value is 15. If I'm missing something, please let me know DXTrade.

--- 帖子 #815 ---
What Renko do you use? On a "real" renko there is obviously the high-close and low-close always 10 pips on a 10 pip brick! See pic... atr(14) and atr(21) have both the same values of 14... and this value does never change.

--- 帖子 #816 ---
BTW... the above definition is the answer you wanted. What is the max and min of a 10 pip Renko candle? 10 Pips... right?

--- 帖子 #817 ---
The one used in my screen shot is called renkoashi_script, which I think I found some where on the TSD forum. It does a pretty good job of making renko charts for back test etc. Haven't used it that much on forward test yet, but am trying it out more today, but think I've seen same thing on the commercial renko charts too, but maybe your right, the difference could be in the scripts, I just double checked as of right now eurjpy ATR values between atr 4 &amp; 14 are almost exactly the same, but are 26 &amp; not the brick sized value of 15.

--- 帖子 #818 ---
Wonder if ATR can be used to trade on renko charts this way? I know it looks kinda messy though. But maybe one of your DxTrade info indis could help clean up the chart quite a bit though, if it works.

--- 帖子 #819 ---
Well... I put my version 1.7 on the Renko... using a commercial Renko chart. And the values are always the same. Just trust me... ATR on real Renkos doesn't work... ever.

--- 帖子 #820 ---
Seems to work fine on renko_ashi chart script, there must be a major difference in the way they are coded, &amp;/or generate the renko charts. Don't mean to beat a dead horse here, but think you maybe over looking something.

--- 帖子 #821 ---
I will never use a free and "not real" Renko chart for trading. On every Renko chart - Tradestation or others - ATR can not work per definition. An ATR(21) for instance is (high1-low1) + (high2-low2)........ / 21 What's so hard to understand that ATR is the average of x Period candle size, and a renko candle is always the size you give it. If you use a "fake" renko script it is just imitating renkos, but is still taking the data from the real chart behind the script. In this case you can use it... sure. On my Renko chart it is always giving the same value as there is no difference in range.

--- 帖子 #822 ---
Ok, just trying to understand ATR a little better I guess, &amp; was wondering why we were seeing different values for ATR on the same chart. Thanks a lot for your help. Appreciate it more than you know.

--- 帖子 #823 ---
Actually I wasn't really precise. A 10 pip renko brick has not a range of 10 pips. My mistake. The possible range is 28 pips (10 for the brick plus 9 pips up and down) before forming another candle. That's why my indi on a 10 pip renko is showing values between 14 and 16, no matter what ATR period you put as this is the average range. But this is definitely nothing to base a trade on. This would only be possible if you code something including the range and the time of a renko candle. Lot of work for small effect as I can - in this case - just open a normal chart

--- 帖子 #824 ---
I'm saying that my SMI has a bug because it plots the past but doesn't plot right in realtime... IndexedmomentumK works fine and it's the same thing... And then...i'm not suggesting any setting, i did find some setting that seemed to work fine with renko, but i'm not suggesting anything... I'm not trading renko anymore...because, i say it again, is a lagging price indicator... and no indy can be applied to renko..because there is a double lagging issue... lag of renko and lag of indy...this is only my opinion obviously...

--- 帖子 #825 ---
Ok thanks Chris, think I remembered that after trying the indi again recently.

--- 帖子 #826 ---
Would you please just do a version of the attached, taking off the ATR and instead putting Momentum on. I like this version on renko charts best with the cci and other info here but just need the momentum 4 info NOT atr. thanks if you can please help? Brian

well I thought I was rocken the c4 intro stragety until I took 2 SP loss hits in a row and wiped out my demo profits from my first 5 trades. Guess I need more pratice.

--- 帖子 #831 ---
Hi: C4 has great merit, but it is unfinished I think. Trt: Use Heiken Ashi Candles. I color code the candles and the indicators and the MA's to match. Helps the eye catch what you need to. Use Slope Direction LIne2 set at your chart TF Use Magnified Market Price set at 20 Use BarClock - shows how mutch time is left the candles Use PriceB_Clock shows how mutch is left for the broker time and your Bar time in relation to each other. Use DamonsmNonLagMa_v1 Color code to match the candles it will hug the move until it shows yellow and is done. Use ParabolicSAR Color - Alert - Match color with Candles Leave the Yellow change part of the indicator the same Use Gann ZigZag on Light Blue dotted line Use Trend Magic Make colors so you can see the progressions as it changes. This is all on price. Sounds like a lot and it is, but you can read it well. The only indcators at the bottom of your scxreen are: Stochastics Oscillator 533 laid over a SmSuper Trix_PV_4col Use one 5mChart with this template on it ,taking half the screen on the top of the screen you have Put a 15m chart with this template taking the bottom half of your screen right under the 5m chart. You must be able to size your chart As you see the 15 chart change direction with the arrow, match the arrow on the price and take every same arrow change on the 5 min that match the 15m You should make the indicators the same color as the candles and the Ma's should be the same color as the the candles. Make the Stochastics indicator laid over the smal indicator a different color so you can see it well The market will signal on the 15m in the trend of the day for you, then wait for the market to move the other way on the 5m agaisnst your 15mi and then enter when it signals the same move on the 5m that recycles the 15 min has shown. Every time the 15 trend signals on the 5m take the trade as per Edge. I think it is important that you put the charts on top of one another. Different look than if you flip through it. Remember: The longer time fram on the bottom is going much slower in changes then the lower time frame. Match the longer term with the shorter term, do not trade against the 15 m Take every 5m that matches the 15m Know the 1h direction You can trade any two time frames you want this way. Maybe this will help you Good Luch

Soorry I am such a party pooper. Thanks for your help to all of us Freddy. I am just not good at posting this stuff, I try and takes time that I am not successful with it. It takes time from trading and no benefit and i have a medical issue to deal with as far as energy goes. I have been working at this for 10 years. It takes times and it is not easy. Not impossible though. I will keep posting. The stochastic overlaid on the trix indicator is the best you are going to get to show you the cycles of the moves. The Damoni non lag indicator with the Slope Firection Linev2 are very smooth over your candles. Leaving the yellow portion of the Damoni non lag indicator to show change of cycles coming. The moves cycles up and down the pivot lines in the direction of the daily. I will try to show a chart. I concentrate on the 15m time frame with the Daily Pivots on it.

SUSAN !!!!!!!!!!! You little sweet rascal, YOU DID IT !!!!! I am SOOOOO proud of you. You make my 60th birthday now one to ALWAYS remember. I know what you mean about medical issues, they come in time and are not always as easy to manage as they look like. I am still experimenting with Renko and Ichi clouds, at times all trades well, at times it don't, but I think it is more the mentality of this trader then the system. I some day you install Skype and add me to your list, we make a screen connection and I show you that it can be done with less indicators, but far more patience, which I don't seem to have too many of, lol.

--- 帖子 #841 ---
Here is the Daman nonlag indicator, I found it by typing it into search box at top of page. I'm trading very differently now as well although it is definitely based on what I learned last summer from Edgetrader. C4 and Nitro with renko was just too quick for me in the end .. I also prefer 15 min tf. Once my method, which is very simple, is perfected, I will share. In the meantime, Susan's contributions are greatly appreciated, I will try out that Damon indicator &amp; see if it enhances my method.

--- 帖子 #842 ---
The zig zag in invaluable for yuo to see that the market moves upward in a long move and zig zags up and down as it moves up. It is imperative to see the full wave the market is in while it zig zags. You can try the Non Lag Zig Zagv2, @ 0,14,2.0 and a second Non Lag Lig Zagv2 laid on the price with it at 0,1,2.0 and it will show you the major wave and the smaller waves following the price along. If you are trading a wave, say up, wait until the Trix recycles in the opposite direction before you get in with the Stochastic in agreement going long again. You do not need the psar. It is over the top but can help you yeye stay on target until you don't need it anymore. It helps really with stops as the price moves along. One hint: When you start a new move, say down, Look at the previous wave that just completed up. See where the last support was. The market will moves to the point and beyond it. This will help you see at least how far it will move Move along with the market once it completes that support and moves beyond and recycles enter again and go to the next support on the prevous move. If you are moving down you are only concerned with the supports on the previous move. If you can learn to fib, you can fib to the support adn it will give you the number the market will trade to. Good Luck I have Skype

I have extensively tried to conquer the Renko candles. The problem with them is that the candle itself take maybe hours after the setup to complete and finish one candle at a time taking hours or reverse with the news quickly. In other words, timing is very difficult with the Renco Timing is a problem for all of us. At least with a candle or bar you can time the candle and see timing changes as the market moves I think Edge was a great trading coach, but trading naked in the market is very dangerous if you do not have command of the market. The Forex only moves with an event because it is so large. The events are the Red FF news. After you sit in it, it may go the other way, if you don't know what you are doing with the market you might not be sitting there anymore and you loose your money. They are simple and pretty though. But candles cannot tell you how the market moves, only prevous information can do that.

4xStar, Good to see you back. Like you think I've learned a lot for c4/nitro, and come to the conclusion that it's much better to use them together rather than separately, time candles and renko. Since as humans we live in a time based world and can see things on timed charts, such as price action, that is difficult if not impossible to see on renko charts even when you use the wicks on option, but renko's main advantage is that it filters out the noise so we can use it at least to see what the general trend is doing on various renko pip sized charts 10 &amp; up. Looking forward to seeing your new method. later, fx45

Hi Every1 Can someone advise please where to get a commercial version of RENKO. Regards ForexZAK

--- 帖子 #847 ---
use www.google.com Regards Kristjan

--- 帖子 #848 ---
the renko live chart 3.2 ea is as good as the commerical renko. use the forum search to find it.

--- 帖子 #849 ---
The commercial version (sRenko) is better because it allows you to anchor the opening price of the renko brick so your charts will always open in the same position. The other version makes charts look different when you launch MT4. sRenko costs USD30.

Looks like a very successful system. Can anyone post the indicators used in post 838 by Susan.Thanks

--- 帖子 #853 ---
NO ! where do you come from ? .... look the date of the last post ! Game over here ... you didn't understand ? :nerd:

I think you will improve your result if you only trade in the direction of the slope of the MA, my idea here is to use the MA as a filter, and compleatly disregard if price is over or under the MA. only the slope matters, when it's red, only sell when it's green, only buy, or you could use both requirements, only buy when price is above the MA and the MA is also sloping up and is green, and only sell if price is below and the MA is sloping down and is red, this will save you a lot of stopouts I think

Hi all fellow, This thread is dead. Has anyone traded this profitable system for long time?

--- 帖子 #856 ---
I don't think it was ever meant to be profitable. Only for entertainment.

I Think it's nearly impossible to scalp M1 for a long time unless you are a borker or you can see the deep of the market.

Bringing back this thread is like digging up bones in a cemetery. It was a fallout of the Keith Brown scam. Brown was a con man who bilked several members out of thousands of dollars, using the name of expatxxx. He came back several months later as Edgetrader. This time he was accompanied by TudorGirl (a man posing as a woman) and TRO (using several different names). The Edgetrader, TudorGirl, TRO apparatus created several different threads. They gradually were exposed and banned. The thread you're reading now popped up just as Edgetrader was being exposed and banned. It featured his scam system (Nitro) and all of his defenders and allies singing his praises. There is no money here. It is worthwhile reading, only to show you what kind of thing to stay away from.

I know. I was practising my sarcasm

--- 帖子 #860 ---
Yup ,who knows it would be profitable now since all the renko threads are dead. After reading some of the threads, look like it is hardly to backtest with accurate result. Not sure if possible to code renko bar as other type of indicator? Maybe lines, numbers or something in indicator chart window instead of offline main chart window with renko bar only.
