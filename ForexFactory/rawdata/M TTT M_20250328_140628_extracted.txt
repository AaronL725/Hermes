M TTT M [MML TRIPLE TRIANGULATED TRADING METHOD] ************************************************************************************************************** Whilst the trading results of the Thread Ops Real account may not be easily reproducible by the average trader, it is my wish to have at least a few traders follow the MTTTM methodology and produce at least minimal net positive and consistent results ! At the end of the day it is the determination and perserverance of the trader that greatly decides whether success will follow or not. If the market knocks you down, pick yourself up and strive to conquer it. Focus on the goal, set milestones, put your mind into gear, make sense of the market chaos and strive to conquer it. There is no place for losers in this business, either generate profit or throw your money to the wolves. What trader do you want to be ? ************************************************************************************************************** Please apply only the indicators, templates and other tools found in the zip folder.

Please note that the MTTTM trading strategy uses levels based off the MML indicator originally coded in 2004 by Vladislav Goshkov. Entry, Stop Loss and Take Profit levels are also aligned with the MML price lines (13) as per the indicator settings. The MTTTM strategy applies multiple symbols in groups of 3's in a triangulated format using a high reward to risk ratio. At no time does this method apply anything whatsoever to do with the Murrey Math Trading System. It does not apply any of the Murrey Math Trading software in any form whatsoever. It only uses the 13 MML lines as generated by the MML indicator and nothing else. I do reserve the right to modify and manipulate the original indicator as provided by the original author of the code. Such changes I have made to the code include advanced functionality, user choice of 0/8 and 8/8 price levels, MML levels based on fixed End of Day data from metaquotes or any other preferred data feed and numerous other additional features both in mq4 and mq5 format. Other adapted versions of code may also be in C++, Java, Python and MatLab. As always use the provided tools at your own risk and note that such tools are provided to traders as an aid to their trading in an as is condition. Non-commercial software is only provided here so do not expect a perfect and flawless solution in all cases. The Plan for the MTTTM Strategy 1. Start off with trading demo examples of 8 scenarios of M15 TF TS Order 3 setups on an 'almost random ' type approach; [transparent trading approach before the fact, discuss trades, discuss ways to improve strike rate] 2. Trade (on demo ) a specially designed TS Order 3 on the M15 TF with several traded setups; [transparent trading approach before the fact, discuss trades, discuss ways to improve strike rate] 3. Trade (on demo ) higher time frame TS Order 3's (and higher TS Order examples) [transparent trading approach before the fact, discuss trades, discuss ways to improve strike rate] 4. Trade (on live ) carefully designed TS Order 3's (and others). [transparent trading approach before the fact, discuss trades (before, during and after), discuss techniques that attempt to improve the strike rate] The M15/M5 MML template is applied using P=64 and MMP=60 settings across a triangulated format. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Triangulated Set (TS): 1 TS set is comprised of 3 pairs where 2 pairs form a cross pair such as EURUSD and GBPUSD form EURGBP (all 3 pairs are traded in a setup) TS 1 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP ... also referred to as a TS Order 1 2 TS sets would then form 6 pairs TS 1 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 2 = AUDCAD + EURCAD = EURAUD ... also referred to as a 2 TS's 3 TS sets would then form 9 pairs TS 1 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 2 = AUDCAD + EURCAD = EURAUD TS 3 = AUDCHF + GBPCHF = GBPAUD ... also referred to as a TS Order 3 Triple Triangulated Set (TT Set): A triple triangulated set (TT set) is 3 by TS sets so it is comprised of 9 pairs and is also referred too as a TS Order 3. TS 1 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 2 = AUDCAD + EURCAD = EURAUD TS 3 = AUDCHF + GBPCHF = GBPAUD Valid trading TS Order setups are comprised of an odd number of pairs: TS Order 1 would trade 3 pairs TS Order 3 would trade 9 pairs TS Order 5 would trade 15 pairs TS Order 7 would trade 21 pairs Note: Even Order TS's are NOT valid setups in the MTTTM trading strategy! Pure Triple Triangulated Set is a minimum TS Order 3 (9 pairs) or any whole digit multiple of the TS Order 3 structure such as: 2 *TS Order 3 [2*9=18 pairs] 3 *TS Order 3 [3*9=27 pairs] 4 *TS Order 3 [4*9=36 pairs] 5 *TS Order 3 [5*9=45 pairs] ... ... N *TS Order 3 [N*9=9N pairs] where N is any positive whole digit. Note: A TS (a group of 3 triangulated currency pairs) may not be repeated in a TS Order setup UNLESS at least 1 pair's direction is different. Grand TS Order 3's A Grand N*TS Order 3 is the complete tradeable setup comprised of either 9, 18, 27, 36, 45 up to 9*N pairs. TS Order 3 is comprised of TS1 (3 pairs), TS2 (3 pairs) and TS3 (3 pairs) ... each TS is comprised of 3 triangulated pairs ... so a TS Order 3 contains a total of 9 pairs ! TS Order 3 (^2) is comprised of TS1, TS2, TS3, TS4, TS5, TS6, TS7, TS8 and TS9 ... 9 triangulated pairs ... in total 27 pairs ! Most commonly traded TS Set in this thread will be TS Order 3 (9 individual pairs). Smaller account balances should apply the lower order TS’s. Higher account balances have more flexibility and may consider higher order TS’s. Risk per trade and total risk across the account is at the trader’s discretion however, I will outline throughout the thread several examples of how I apply risk management to these setups. Ultimately the trader is responsible for his/her trading decisions be it trade or risk management. Example of a Triangulated Set of Order 1 (1 by 3 pairs): Triangulated Set 1 = 2 short + 1 long or vice versa such as EURUSD (S), GBPUSD (S) + EURGBP (L) Trade #1 = short EURUSD Trade #2 = short GBPUSD Trade #3 = long EURGBP Example of a Triangulated Set of Order 3 (3 by 3 pairs = 9 pairs): Triangulated Set 1 = 2 short + 1 long or vice versa such as EURUSD (S), GBPUSD (S) + EURGBP (L) Triangulated Set 2 = 2 long + 1 short or vice versa such as AUDUSD (L), NZDUSD (L) + AUDNZD (S) Triangulated Set 3 = 2 short + 1 long or vice versa such as GBPJPY (S), GBPCHF (S) + CHFJPY (L) Trade #1 = short EURUSD Trade #2 = short GBPUSD Trade #3 = long EURGBP Trade #4 = long AUDUSD Trade #5 = long NZDUSD Trade #6 = short AUDNZD Trade #7 = short GBPJPY Trade #8 = short GBPCHF Trade #9 = long CHFJPY Other variations to direction are also possible. Higher order triangulated sets simply follow along a similar line of logic. A TS of Order 5 would apply 15 individual trades in the setup A TS of Order 7 would apply 21 individual trades in the setup A TS of Order 9 would apply 27 individual trades in the setup A TS of Order 11 would apply 33 individual trades in the setup Sooner or later a limit is reached in terms of the TS Order applied since the pair offerings from a given broker may not be suitable for a host of different reasons. MT4 (or MT5, cTrader or other platform) will be used in this methodology. MML levels: A minimal understanding of the MML Grid is required. Attached Image (click to enlarge) There are 13 MML lines -2/8 , -1/8 , 0/8 , 1/8 , 2/8 , 3/8 , 4/8 , 5/8 , 6/8 , 7/8 , 8/8 , +1/8 and +2/8 . These 13 MML lines form 12 Octaves The distance in pips between 2 MML lines is also referrred to as the Octave Gap. Multiples of the Octave Gap are used for the SL and also TP (1 Octave Gap_SL : 4 Octave Gap_TP). Note: Typically the SL is projected as a muliple (using up to 2 decimal places) of the octave gap in the range [1 ... 2]. For example, MINIMUM SL = 1*Octave Gap and TP = 4*Octave Gap ... ... SL = 1.1*Ocatve Gap and TP = 4.4*Octave Gap ... ... SL = 1.25*Octave Gap and TP = 5*Octave Gap ... ... SL = 1.5*Ocatve Gap and TP = 6*Octave Gap ... ... MAXIMUM SL = 2*Octave Gap and TP = 8*Octave Gap Direction of trades in a TS: The MML System grid may be used to dictate the direction of pairs or any other defined strategic approach. Short opportunities may be sought from the extreme upper MML zone. Long opportunities may be sought from the extreme lower MML zone. Pair Direction Criteria (PDC): Ultimately PDC is at the discretion of the individual trader and the methods that they choose to apply. I will outline some examples of how the choice of direction can be decided in a TS Order 3 setup but there are many more. Example 1: Lets use the current TS Order 3-#2-S3 as our first example. TS Order 3-#2-S3 TS 1 , TS 2 and TS 3 triangulated pairings have already been chosen and I have outlined this procedure in previous posts. TS 1 : EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 2 : AUDCAD + EURCAD = EURAUD TS 3 : GBPCAD + CADCHF = GBPCHF Next step is to choose a pair direction for each of the 9 pairs (EURUSD ... GBPCHF). a) Pair Correlation Tables (daily, weekly and monthly) The focus was on the weekly correlation table with additional reference to both the daily and monthly correlation tables. Starting at the top row select the maximum positive and maximum negative correlation values for all rows. Like so, Weekly Correlation Table ( Source: myfxbook ) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Bias is favored towards the weekly correlation table in this example due to some historical data which has shown that trades on average remain open for 44 hours (almost 2 days) in an M15 TS Order 3 setup (this trade duration time may vary over time so keep tabs on it). Now its clear to see which pairs move in the same basic direction as other pairs and which pairs move in the opposite directions. This information may be used to determine whether or not 2 pairs in a TS such as TS1 will be traded in the same or opposite directions. b) MML Grid reference The MML Grid M15 [P=64, MMP=60 and StepBack=0] of each pair is then used to find which pair from each TS group is the 'better' choice for a given direction. The most positively correlated pair within the TS1 grouping for example, would then be traded in the opposite direction. Similarly, this procedure is applied across all TS's so in a TS Order 3 (TS 1 , TS 2 and TS 3 ) we now have the directions of 6 pairs out of 9 pairs. Like so, TS 1 : EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 2 : AUDCAD + EURCAD = EURAUD TS 3 : GBPCAD + CADCHF = GBPCHF Now we need to determine the directions of the remaining 3 pairs namely; EURGBP, AUDCAD and CADCHF. By referring back to the correlation tables we note that EGbp more closely follows EUsd therefore we choose the long direction. By referring back to the correlation tables we note that ACad more closely follows ECad therefore we choose the short direction. By referring back to the correlation tables we note that CChf more closely follows GChf therefore we choose the long direction. Note: sometimes the choice is not straightforward and when this is the case always refer to the pairs MML Grid and make the 'best' choice. The final pair directions using this approach are as follows: TS 1 : EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 2 : AUDCAD + EURCAD = EURAUD TS 3 : GBPCAD + CADCHF = GBPCHF It is very important to realize that only a basic approach has been used here to determine pair directions within a triangulated set over a TS Order 3. An intelligent trader would test several variations of this basic approach and attempt to apply the approach which is most likely to yield the higher strike rates. Note: Using such an approach (or any other approach) cannot guarantee success in a trade(s) outcome in the market. Example 2: Another way to choose pair directions is purely selecting pairs which are currently trading in or close to the extreme MML zones. Upper MML zone is in the range 8/8 MML to +2/8 MML in which case a short reversal entry is attempted. Lower MML zone is in the range 0/8 MML to -2/8 MML in which case a long reversal entry is attempted. A triangulated configuration may not be possible or is at least very difficult to achieve for every pair in a TS set and over all TS's that make up the TS Order #. Note: Be careful of being overweight in a given currency as this may add unnecessary risk to the TS Order setup. Example 3: Higher Time Frame Analysis (H4 and D1) Use higher time frame charts such as H4 or D1 using MML settings of P=64. Pair direction may be chosen based on the price action (PA) on a HTF chart. A long direction may be chosen after observing price bouncing off a solid level of support. A short direction may be chosen after observing price bouncing off a solid level of resistance. This requires paitence and continually monitoring where price is within the HTF chart in order to setup an M15 trade or series of trades. Note: It can be frustrating searching for multiple setups which also align with the M15 chart based on TS Order size or total pair count. Choice of Triangulated Sets: This is at the trader’s discretion. Some examples are shown above but there are numerous other triangulated sets that can be traded. A comprehensive list of TS sets (groups of 3 triangulated pairs) should be readily available. The choice can be related to a traders bias on a particular currency or set of currencies at a given point in time. For example, In the case of the following TS Order 3, TS 1 : EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 2 : AUDCAD + EURCAD = EURAUD TS 3 : GBPCAD + CADCHF = GBPCHF 6 Currencies were used to formulate the TS Order 3 namely: 1. AUD 2. CAD 3. CHF 4. EUR 5. GBP and 6. USD A decision might be made to NOT trade a given pair such as CAD due to its expected eratic behavior for the next several months. Other decisions might reject a certain currency inclusion due to typical seasonal trading ranges which may impact TP levels selected. Turtle like pairs might be rejected or volatile pairs rejected based on TS Order# risk profile. These will be outlined in the thread in far more detail. ACCOUNT SIZE: Retail Trading Account funds can be categorized as follows: Very Small &lt; US$500 Small US$500 to US$2000 Medium US$2001 to US$10 000 Large US$10 001 to US$100 000 Very Large &gt; US$100 000 It is recommended that trading funds of at least the Small category are used when trading the MTTTM Strategy. If a Very Small account is to be used then it is suggested that only a TS Order 1 (3 pairs) be traded and not more until Equity reaches 'Small' status. Large funding matched to small exposure typically equates to lower applied risk however, risk must always be actively managed. Time Frame: M15 or M5 is the time frame applied in the earlier part of the thread. Higher TFs will also be traded at a later stage. Entry: The M15/M5 MML System template is used for taking entries. Ideally an entry should be executed from a valid MML price line. Entry either at an allowed MML level or after an M5 candle closes in the direction of TP. Entries can be @ market or pending orders (Buy Stop, Sell Stop, Buy Limit or Sell Limit) depnding on the configuration of the setup. Entries should be made as close as practicable to the relevant MML entry level. If this is not possible then the next MML level must be used. All entries (@ market or pending) must be placed at the same time or within 15 minutes from 1st trade to last trade. Trade entry setup must fit within the confines of the applicable MML Grid for all trades. The choice of SL as a function of the Octave Gap puts limitations on the entry MML level of a given trade. For example, if SL chosen = 1*Octave Gap then the lowest possible entry for a long is at the -1/8 MML since the SL would be placed at the -2/8 MML. If SL = 1.5*Octave Gap then the lowest possible entry for a long setup is from the 0/8 MML level, this is because entry should be taken from an MML level, the SL would be placed mid-point between -1/8 MML and -2/8 MML. No stops or TPs can exceed the bounds of the MML Grid. The Upper and lower bounds of the MML Grid confine the trade setup. All trade setups playout within the relevant MML Grid at the time of planned entry (its important to re-check Octave Gap at entry time since they do update). Long entries – preferred from the lower Extreme MML zone between -2/8 MML to 0/8 MML -2/8, -1/8, 0/8, 1/8, 2/8, 3/8, 4/8, 5/8, and 6/8 only No longs from 7/8, 8/8, +1/8 or +2/8 Short entries - preferred from the upper Extreme MML zone between 8/8 MML to +2/8 MML +2/8, +1/8, 8/8, 7/8, 6/8, 5/8, 4/8, 3/8, and 2/8 only No shorts from 1/8, 0/8, -1/8 or -2/8 Exception : the cross or single pair on 1 side of the triangulated set can trade from any MML (its purpose is to offset some of the risk) Timing of entries into the market is determined by the trader and can be at, before or after any major open. SL: Hard stops always applied (no exceptions) Minimum 1 by octave gap on an M15/M5 MML System Grid Maximum 2 by octave gap on an M15/M5 MML System Grid Extending out the SL also means that the TP will be moved further out so price will have further to go to reach the target. Traders need to make a decision regarding the SL on a case by case basis. However, from a manual trading perspective it is simpler to apply the same choice of SL design to all current trades in the same TS Order setup. An automated system though can handle complex tasks with ease. Additional information: A minimum SL of 1 octave gap up to a maximum of 1.5 octave gaps (for the M15 template); If an entry is taken from an MML level then multiples of the octave gap will produce TPs such as: (i) 1 octave gap SL = 4 octave gap TP (ii) 1.1 octave gap SL = 4.4 octave gap TP (iii) 1.2 octave gap SL = 4.8 octave gap TP (iv) 1.3 octave gap SL = 5.2 octave gap TP (v) 1.4 octave gap SL = 5.6 octave gap TP (vi) 1.5 octave gap SL = 6 octave gap TP and (vii) 2 octave gap SL = 8 octave gap TP Be aware that we trade within the MML Grid. The MML Grid's main trading range is from the 0/8 MML through to 8/8 MML with the 2 extreme zones completing our total trading area. If a short entry is taken from the 8/8 MML then a maximum of 2 octave gaps may be applied for the SL (TP @ 0/8 MML) If a long entry is taken from the 0/8 MML then a maximum of 2 octave gaps may be applied for the SL (TP @ 8/8 MML) The choice of SL in terms of the Octave Gap count therefore dictates where the TP must be placed to ensure a 4 to 1 Reward to risk ratio. Minor modifications of the SL are possible provided the total risk across all trades in the entire TS Order setup is not exceeded. Trailing stops are at the discretion of the trader but be fully aware that the frequency of full TPs being hit will reduce drastically so be aware how the strategies expectancy will change ! TP: 4 times the assigned SL pips to maintain the mandated 4 to 1 reward to risk ratio. Higher TF charts such as D1, W1 or MN can be used to set TPs provided a minimum 4 to 1 R:r is maintained. Nb. MML settings of the HTF charts should all use P=64 unless advised otherwise (there will be some exceptions). Reward to Risk ratio: Always at least 4 to 1 for every entry taken over the entire Triangulated Set. The following chart shows the minimum win rate to BE for a 4 to 1 reward to risk ratio. Strategy theoretical strike rate should then be &gt;= 20.0% (refer chart) for a 4 to 1 reward to risk ratio over the longer term. Strategy practical strike rate should then be &gt;= 22.2% (2/9 winners) for a 4 to 1 reward to risk ratio over the longer term. If the strategy returns 3/10 (30%) winning trades on average over the longer term then the trading system is deemed to be profitable. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) The graph above shows the various outcomes of an account of $10 000 trading a fixed reward to risk ratio of 4 to 1. The red shaded area identifies the case for: (a) all losing trades results in a 9% loss (for a fixed 1% risk per trade) or -$900 and a final TS Order 3 Cycle balance of $9100 and (b) 8 losing trades results in a 4% loss (for a fixed 1% risk per trade) or -$400 and a final TS Order 3 Cycle balance of $9600 Therefore, losing 9 trades in a row produces the worst case situation which is a 9% loss to the trading account ! The blue shaded area identifies the case for: (a) all winning trades results in a 36% gain or +$3600 and a final TS Order 3 Cycle balance of $13600 (b) 8 winning trades results in a 31% gain or +$3100 and a final TS Order 3 Cycle balance of $13100 (c) 7 winning trades results in a 26% gain or +$2600 and a final TS Order 3 Cycle balance of $12600 (d) 6 winning trades results in a 21% gain or +$2100 and a final TS Order 3 Cycle balance of $12100 (e) 5 winning trades results in a 16% gain or +$1600 and a final TS Order 3 Cycle balance of $11600 (f) 4 winning trades results in a 11% gain or +$1100 and a final TS Order 3 Cycle balance of $11100 (g) 3 winning trades results in a 6% gain or +$500 and a final TS Order 3 Cycle balance of $10500 (h) 2 winning trades results in a 1% gain or +$100 and a final TS Order 3 Cycle balance of $10100 Therefore, 2 winners out of 9 trades is all that is needed to generate a positive outcome ! Be careful about drawing any rock solid conclusions about an unfolding strategy in the live market especially if its based on a small sample size. A small sample size may not provide any results of great significance and is mre likely to be of a random type nature. The greater the number of trades that form part of the analysis the better (a trade count of &gt;100-200 might be ideal with higher being better). Note that in this method it might not always be practical to run every trade through to a full SL or full TP especially if price decides to range within the stop and TP levels for a long period of time. Indeed it is highly likely that some trades will be closed out at less than a full stop or less than a full TP. The trader needs to be aware of this issue and how it might affect the significance of the trading results. Trade Management: Set &amp; Forget manual trading approach can be applied. Advisable that all setups are monitored from time to time by the trader. Minimal interference with trades is preferred. Trader has the discretion to modify trades for potentially negative high impact news events or other key events. Risk Management: Maximum risk per trade is at the trader’s discretion but must consider total number of trades in the sequence over the entire trading account. Preferably within the range 0.01% to 2% per trade. A risk per trade in a TS Order 3 (9 pairs) should not exceed 1% since this is implying a total risk across the setup of 9%. If higher Order TS's are traded comprised of many more pairs then risk per trade should be &lt;&lt; 1% per pair (perhaps 0.25% to 0.5%). Total risk across the account is the sum of all current trades SLs running in the market. A TS Order 1 @ 1%_SL per trade would have a total risk of 3% A TS Order 3 @ 1%_SL per trade would have a total risk of 9% A TS Order 5 @ 1%_SL per trade would have a total risk of 15% A TS Order 7 @ 1%_SL per trade would have a total risk of 21% A TS Order 9 @ 1%_SL per trade would have a total risk of 27% A TS Order 11 @ 1%_SL per trade would have a total risk of 33% Variations in applied risk per trade may also depend on the TS being traded. For example, A TS Order 1 comprises 3 trades in total so a 1% risk per trade for a total risk of 3% might be acceptable. A TS Order 3 comprises 9 trades in total so a 1% risk per trade for a total risk of 9% may not be acceptable. For higher order TS’s it might mean reducing the risk applied per trade so that total risk is sensible. Design a plan for the risk management part of the trading strategy: (a) If a completed TS Order setup results in a negative gain consider reducing the risk per trade (b) If a completed TS Order setup results in a positive gain consider increasing the risk per trade Example of a TS Order 3 cycle Assume current risk per trade = 1% If TS Order 3-A (1% risk per trade * 9 trades = 9%) is a net loser ; Then TS Order 3-B (0.8% per trade * 9 trades = 7.2%) applies only 0.8% risk per trade. If TS Order 3-A is a net winner and TS Order 3-B is a net winner either continue at 1% risk per trade or increase risk per trade to 1.2%. However, be very aware that this puts a total risk per TS Order 3 at 1.2%*9 trades which is a possible 13.5% loss if all trades are losers. This type of risk is likely to be unsustainable over the longer term and possibly lead to disastrous results. It is not advisable to keep increasing the risk per trade after a series of winning TS Order 3's since eventually a losing TS Order 3 will occur. The trader is responsible for designing and setting the applied risk per trade but it must be sensible and realistic. The focus should be more aligned with reducing risk on net losing TS Orders and then after positive progress slowly increase the risk back to the initial risk per trade. As the account equity grows seek out methods that minimize the applied risk! Risk Adjustments Generally as account equity increases, less risk should be applied across the account in order to minimize adverse future TS Order outcomes. However, a trader may apply at times instances of calculated risk . An example of calculated risk for a TS Order 3: Start Balance = 10 000 Current Balance = 12 000 Account Equity% gain is +20% Current Risk per trade = 1% (Total Risk over 9 trades is 9%) Next TS Order 3 risk approach Apply Risk per trade = 1.5% (Total Risk over 9 trades is 13.5% ) Note that in theory (not accounting for negative slippage issues) even if all trades were losers (unlikely) the account start balance value is still protected. Within a few short weeks depending on the gain in Equity and the applied risk per trade one of our key focus points is on preserving the initial capital. An Equity Chart (end of day data) on a good trading strategy that is well managed typically shows only minimal drawdowns below initial capital level in the early stages of trading followed by no future drops in equity below initial investment . All future drops in Equity after initial stage are typically much lower than a maximum peak to trough drop of 29% with lower being better. If all trades were losers the account loses -13.5% of equity however, it is +20% up so a worst case scenario would still have a final balance greater than the start balance leading to preservation of funds. There are many ways to play calculated risk but the idea should be to apply it very very sparingly (not all the time even if conditions look right) and only in situations where increased risk will not result in the account balance dropping below start balance. If current balance drops below start balance after the completion of a TS Order# then look to reduce risk per trade. Only apply calculated risk (sparingly) when the account equity% gain is greater than the assumed worst case risk scenario. Additional Entries: At the traders own discretion but current draw down or floating equity should be factored in. Consider how the risk profile across the account may alter as trades are added. Guideline for Optional MTTTM TS Order Strategies: I prefer to provide a list of guidelines instead of referring to them as a set of rules. 1. Trades should run their course hitting SL or TP ( Reward to Risk ratio must be 4 to 1 for every trade ) except when high impact news or W/E gaps; 2. Set a %Equity gain or $ gain closure amount but avoid TPs that result in a less than 1 to 1 R:r; 3. TS's (such as M5, M15 ... HTF TS's N/A) that have run overnight and are net positive can be closed out prior to the planned next TS start time; 4. Pending orders can be deleted if they have not yet triggered same day or after a minimum 4 hours; 5. Keep the R:r constant at 4 to 1 initially. 6. After losing cycles consider reducing risk per trade , but be sure to extend the SLs out using relatively smaller lot sizing ( 2 parameter approach ). 7. After a return to winning cycles (not single trades rather net positive gain over the entire TS Order setup) consider increasing the risk again. 8. Monitor trade stop outs and if the stop outs have reduced and the larger stops appear to be providing a larger buffer then leave the wider stops. 9. Be aware that there is a limit to how large the stops can be and typically in MTTTM this is 2 Octave Gaps and not more (4 to 1 TP !?). 10. TS Order design (same each time, selective, random, partially hedged, box-hedged, pairs at extreme MML zones, etc). 11. Consider higher TF MML Grid (HTF provides the same series of MML lines (13) but typically much larger octaves (12), forcing larger stops). Note: Be aware of the impact to the longer term expectancy if trades are closed out early (end of week closures are one exception). Comments: I'll start off using a demo account and trade it manually and suggest other traders do likewise. Fundamental analysis is limited in this trading strategy in the lower TFs but should be considered in the HTFs. Mostly a mechanical technical approach. The initial setup for the Triangulated Sets is what will be the most time consuming exercise (Lot_Size-MTTTM indicator now posted) but with practise all things become faster and easier. SLs will then need to be allocated noting that on an MML Grid not all pairs exhibit the same octave gap and a given pairs pip value also differs from other pairs. Since the octave gap may differ and the pair choice may differ then the pips assigned to a given trade may also vary. Therefore lot sizes allocated to a given pair will also differ even though risk per trade is the same for all entries of the same TS Order Set. Take note of the following formulas as they will need to be applied for every pair traded. Lot size = $Risk per Trade / [Octave Gap * Pair pip value per lot] ... consider any Octave Gap multiplier being used $Risk per Trade is calculated based on trader assigned risk% per trade eg 0.01%, 0.1%, 1% or 2% Example applying a 1% risk per trade on a 10 000 balance is as follows: Account Balance = 10 000 Risk per trade (trader assigned) = 1% = 1/100*10 000 = 100 Assume Pair = EURUSD Assume Octave Gap = 25 pips Lot size for EURUSD = $Risk per Trade / [Octave Gap*Pair pip value per lot] = 100/(25*10) = 0.4 lots. Check 0.4 lot value by using Lot size * Pip value per lot * Octave Gap [it should equal $Risk per trade … and in this case it does = 100 = 1% risk of 10 000]. ================================================================================= INDICATORS AND TEMPLATES SECTION! ================================================================================= MT4 TOOLS (being phased out over the next several months): Lot-Size-MTTTM indicator &amp; Instrument_Changer-28_pairs-MTTTM indicator Attached Image (click to enlarge) Murrey_Math1-MTTTM_M15 indicator Attached Image (click to enlarge) MML-Fibonacci indicator ... coming soon !

Coming soon ! Note that as soon as the current MT4 demo test runs have been completed there will be a move to MT5 ! ================================================================================= So if trading 3 triangulated sets there will be 9 calculations involved (1 per trade over 9 trades). Always double check the calculations to ensure an identical risk profile is applied throughout. When trades are applied use your mouse to ‘mouse over’ the SL lines to check they are correct. The idea of the MTTTM methodology is to simply allow all trades time to play out. As cycles of trades in TS's complete it is important to evaluate the trading data and seek out ways to improve the strike rate. There will be winners and there will be losers. The win/loss ratio can be rather unimpressive but this is not a concern since the strategy relies on a limited number of winning trades to generate a net gain and this translates into account growth over the longer term. Consider TS Order 1 (3 trades) @ 1% Risk per Trade 1 losing trade (L) = -1% 1 winning trade (W) = +4% 3 losses= 3*(-1%) = -3% 2L + 1W = 2*(-1%) + 1*(4%) = +2% 3W = 3*(4%) = +12% Only 1 winner needed to be net positive (+2% gain) even though you lost 2 trades. As an exercise run through a TS Order 3, then 5, then 7 etc. A TS Order 3 @ 1%SL has a range [ -9% to +36%]. Recall that a TS Order 3 is a set of 9 trades. Not very likely you will get 9/9 winners is it … although possible. Look at it in terms of the minimum winners required to be net positive. 2 winners out of 9 trades is needed to be net positive 1%. 3 winners out of 9 trades is needed to be net positive 6%. 4 winners out of 9 trades is needed to be net positive 11%. And yet 2,3 or 4 winners out of 9 trades is still less than a 50% strike rate ! Small accounts might be better to trade only 1 triangulated setup of 3 pairs (TS Order 1) until the account grows much larger in equity. Larger accounts may trade any Order Triangulated Sets within reason such as: 1 Triangulated Set = 3 pairs 3 Triangulated Sets = 9 pairs 5 Triangulated Sets = 15 pairs 7 Triangulated Sets = 21 pairs 9 Triangulated Sets = 27 pairs 11 Triangulated Sets = 33 pairs 3 Triangulated Sets (9 trades) in a TS Order 3 should be the limit until full confidence in the system is gained and it makes sense to do so. ***************************************************************************************** ADVANCED TRADE MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS 1.

Important: Test the M TTT M methodology using a demo account in the first place. If trading on a live account be aware of the risks involved. The method relies on gaining only a few profitable trades from a group to generate net gain. After a grand cycle of Triangulated trades have completed, evaluate the results, adjust for improvements and repeat the process. Consider the additional risks involved with opening a TS Setup on a Friday and the likely impact of an unfavorable weekend gap. Its meant to be a very simple system provided the risk profile is adhered too. However, the MTTTM strategy can become highly complex very very quickly. For advanced versions and higher Order TS setups a trade management or expert advisor is highly recommended. It is possible that a series of MT5 tools may become available in the future as an assistant to the trader. Remember that the trader is ultimately responsible for supervising the entire process and not the tools being applied. Test it out and post your experiences on the thread ! ALWAYS MANAGE THE RISK !

M TTT M Trading System Post 1 covers the basics of the method so for those interested please start by reading the material. Asking questions is a good way to learn so feel free to ask. Once the basics are understood its meant to be a simple approach. Using a favorable reward to risk ratio that allows only requires a few winners out of many trades to be profitable. Use the template on an M15 or M5 chart. Later I will connect a demo account to a Trade Explorer and go through the steps required to choose the pairs and how they get traded. Try it out on demo first. All the best, Masterrmind............

These are simply examples. There are hundreds of different ways to trade it. Part of the process involves deciding on your own pair configurations. The trader has the discretion to hedge the pairs or not. Take note that at the end of the day what really matters say in the case of an Order 3 TS is to win at least 2 trades out of the 9. Doing so will make the trader net positive ... simple math. Its as simple as that. But is it simple ? Masterrmind..............

Some examples will be outlined tomorrow. I would suggest that traders interested in the method to please read through Post 1. Unfortunately its well past my sleep time so I'm off to rest.

Hi Masterrmind, congrats to your latest threat ... I actually salute all the authors here as it consumes plenty of time to run, manage and supervise a thread. I subscribe even I am still one of the warriors of Quantum and still have to digest murrey. Wish you all the best.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Nope ... not such a good idea in my opinion. You are placing all of your assigned risk into only the 1 short GU trade with double position size. As an exercise you could back test the 3 trade approach versus the single GU trade. Over a large enough sample size I know which setup I would be trading. Its all about spreading the risk ... not concentrating it. Masterrmind........

Welcome Togerhard, Yes its very time consuming to keep a thread going. Yes I still trade Quantum in the background but it needs deep pockets and relatively small position sizes then its a case of syphoning off some of the DD before it has a chance to get too big. Im still to take a 1K account live and drive it to 10K... this still eludes me however, I am examining hybrid type approaches so one day maybe a success story. Good to see you around and I wish you all the best in your continuing quest to master that Quantum beast. Masterrmind.......

The following chart outlines the MMLs where short and long entries can occur. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Notice that short entries stop at the 2/8 MML which is the lowest level that still allows a 4 to 1 entry into the market. No shorts are allowed below this level because such an entry would not yield a 4 to 1 reward to risk ratio within the confines of the MML Grid. Notice the long entries stop at the 6/8 MML which is the highest level that still allows a 4 to 1 entry into the market. No longs are allowed above this level because such an entry would not yield a 4 to 1 reward to risk ratio within the confines of the MML Grid. The MML Grid covers the MMLs from -2/8 at the bottom of the chart up to +2/8 at the top of the chart. We trade within the confines of the current MML Grid of the symbol being traded. If price breaks out beyond the upper section ( +2/8 MML ) then we do not want to be in the trade. If price breaks out below the lower section ( -2/8 MML ) then we do not want to be in the trade. Key Point is to understand that all of our trading decisions occur within the upper and lower boundaries of the MML Grid. Masterrmind.............

--- 帖子 #15 ---
M TTT M - some more information MML Grid: The post above shows the MML Grid feasible trading range. Entries are made only within this MML Grid and not beyond the upper (+2/8) or the lower (-2/8) MMLs. Recall that entries can be made from either an exact MML line price or after the close of an M5 candle in the direction of TP. This goes for all pairs that are traded in any Triangulated Set. If price pushes out beyond the far upper or far lower MML boundary lines then we are not interested in trading it. If price pushes further and futher out then the MML Grid will reset and offer potential entries at a different time. Ideally we are looking for price to move from entry across 4 octaves. An octave is simply the name given to the distance between 2 MML lines. Although the settings can be altered for an MML Grid they will remain fixed at P=64 and MMP=60 until futher notice. The MML levels are determined by specific formulas based on the settings applied so they can change. The distance between 2 MML lines is often referred to as the octave gap. In the next post I will address the Triangulated Sets based on several pairs offered in the market watch of the MT4 platform of one broker. Masterrmind..............

Examples of Triangulated Sets of Pairs Recall that in this thread Triangulated Set(s) will be denoted as TS('s). The TS's are simple to formulate but time consuming. Step 1 Make a list of multiple pairs; Step 2 Choose 2 pairs where either both base currencies are the same and the counters are different or both counters are the same and the base currencies are different; Step 3 From Step 2 above form the third pair (or cross pair); Step 4 Repeat Step 2 and Step 3 until multiple TS's (3 pairs represents 1 TS) have been created; Step 5 Choose the number of TS's based on the order of TS to be traded (if its Order 1 then choose 1 TS ie 3 pairs, Order 3 choose 3 TS ie 9 pairs etc) For example, Lets use AUD as our base currency. Pairs starting with AUD as base currency are: AUDCAD AUDCHF AUDJPY AUDNZD AUDSGD Now add any 2 pairs above to form a cross: AUDCAD + AUDCHF = CADCHF AUDCAD + AUDJPY = CADJPY AUDCAD + AUDNZD = CADNZD AUDCAD + AUDSGD = CADSGD AUDCHF + AUDJPY = CHFJPY AUDCHF + AUDNZD = NZDCHF AUDCHF + AUDSGD = CHFSGD AUDJPY + AUDNZD = NZDJPY AUDJPY + AUDSGD = SGDJPY Now check that the cross exists in the brokerage used to trade. If the cross is ficticious simply delete it out of the possibles. The above shows only some of the examples, there are many more. Now make a list of the TS's for the EUR base currency. Continue for all desired base currencies. You will now have a very large group of TS's. Based on the Order of TS you wish to trade you can now start selecting all the pairs in Triangulated Format. ps. next post will outline an example choice of Order 3. Masterrmind................

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Welcome NaviHH. There is plenty of more material to be posted. I will outline a Triangulated Set of Order 3 very soon. Then maybe give another example so traders start to get the idea. The M TTT M Trading Strategy is unique in the sense that traders get to choose the Triangulated Sets. But the overall concept once leant is actually very simple. Rinse and repeat. Masterrmind.............

--- 帖子 #19 ---
hi mastermind, tnx for the system. i have a couple of questions, first 15 min mml octaves are around 20pips generally, dont you think the sl will be hit too frequently? second, do you open same lotsize for all pairs in the same ts set? the reason i ask is because of different pip values for dif pairs.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Example of a Triangulated Set Order 3 Order 3 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD Order 5 As for Order 3 and add 2 more TS's Order 7 AS for Order 5 and add 2 more TS's Similarly for Orders 9, 11 and higher. I suggest starting with Order 1 or Order 3 and then experimenting with Order 5 and Order 7. Its likely you might be satisfied with trading up to Order 3 but each to their own. Masterrmind...............

--- 帖子 #21 ---
From a probability perspective a smaller stop is more likely to get hit than a much wider stop. However, we only seek a very low strike rate to be profitable. Using a 4 to 1 Reward to Risk ratio we only need to win 2 trades out of every 9 to be profitable. Thats only being right 22.2% of the time ! And wrong 77.8% of the time ! 5/9 winners will yield a 16% gain. Ofcourse I could keep spitting out numbers and ratios and probabilities for a very long time. What I will say though is that this approach can be very easily adapted to the higher TFs such as H1, H4, D1 and beyond. However, for Order 3 TS's on higher TFs it requires deeper pockets in general partly due to bigger stops involved. In Post 1 I outlined the formula for calculating the lot sizes. Yes they will be different for different base currencies due a different pip value even if the octave gap is identical. Then ofcourse lot sizes will clearly be different when octave gaps are different. Masterrmind.............

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Order 3 Setup Our example TS of Order 3 is as follows: Order 3 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD So our pairs are simply: Pair 1 = AUDNZD Octave gap is 15.3 Pair 2 = AUDJPY Octave gap is 19.5 pips Pair 3 = NZDJPY Octave gap is 9.8 pips Pair 4 = EURUSD Octave gap is 15.3 pips Pair 5 = GBPUSD Octave gap is 15.3 pips Pair 6 = EURGBP Octave gap is 7.6 pips Pair 7 = AUDCAD Octave gap is 30.5 pips Pair 8 = GBPCAD Octave gap is 30.5 pips Pair 9 = GBPAUD Octave gap is 61 pips The octave gap is shown on each chart. The octave gap value will be the desired SL in pips. Applying the Lot size formula (Excel is useful here) determine the lot size for each of the 9 pairs. Do not assume that the same Octave gap will produce the same lot size ... it will not if the pip value is different. The pip value can be determined by using the indicator and inputting Lot size = 1.0 and pips = 1 for each of the 9 pairs. Make use of the instrument changer to expedite the process by simply clicking on the appropriate tab for a desired pair. Masterrmind..............

--- 帖子 #23 ---
I'll wait now until some capable trader posts the correct lot sizes. There will be 9 lot sizes, one for each pair. Then the next step "Setting up the entries", can be outlined. The octave gaps can ocassionally vary between brokers. So I would suggest that traders use the data provided by their own brokers. ps. Some capable trader please calculate the lot sizes for a balance of either 1000, 5000 or 10 000 and post it to the thread . Masterrmind.............

Using Baby Pips position size calculator and Account Currency as USD $10,000: AUDNZD (using NZDUSD Bid price = 0.69815) : 0.9362 Lots or... 0.94 Lots AUDJPY (using USDJPY Ask price = 112.386) : 0.5763 Lots or... 0.58 Lots I could keep going but you get the idea...

...using your rule of 1% risk, that is

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Lot Size Formula Lot Size of Pair = $Risk per Trade / [Octave Gap*Pair pip value per lot] $Risk per Trade is obtained from taking the assigned Risk% of the Account Balance Octave Gap is read off the chart for the relative pair Pair pip value per lot is read off the chart (or via contract specifications) as a value representing 1 pip for a volume of 1 lot Now there is enough information to complete all the lot sizes over all the required pairs. Masterrmind.............

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Looks like you are headed in the right direction. The current exchange rate has plenty to say about it since it changes dynamically when the market is moving except EU which remains at 10. For the purposes of these initial calculations clearly they would be applied just prior to a planned entry. It is also wise to monitor the actual SLs of all pairs from time to time to ensure that when mousing over the SL line that every trade is not greater than the assigned risk per pair be it 0.5%, 1% or other value. If it is greater than the assigned $ amount then the trader has the option to drag the SL so that risk per trade falls within the assigned risk setting. Setting out the information (and data) in a neat table or logical order is very useful here. Although calculators are useful and timely it is perhaps better initially to go through the whole process manually. Applying the right bid or ask and considering if a trade is long or short can also be considered. However, in this thread I will be simply applying the pip values per pair as per the indicator provided in the zip in post 1. Most values for 1 pip at 1 lot volume will range somewhere between 5 to 13 so if you get values vastly different to these then do a re-check. Later today I will provide the calculated values for the Triangulated Set of Order 3 for the pairs given in the posts above. Masterrmind...........

--- 帖子 #29 ---
I think an EA is definetly needed for this system. It would take one too much time to figure out proper SL/TP and direction of trade and etc. The more TS' that you have the more complex and timeconsuming it will get. The EA could choose the best option for the combination of pairs to be chosen for a given TS set by determining the best level of entry for buy and sell sets. For example if pairs with Euro as base currencies are at -2/8P than it will use Euro base currencies as buys and etc. You could program the EA to choose best option the closer to -2/8 or 2/8 the better for buy/ sell per each pair.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
I'd suggest running through the method start to finish in manual mode after which an EA could be considered. The trading method is not difficult if applied in an almost random walk approach. In terms of the choice of TS's to trade in your setup a random approach can be used, or only certain base currencies with others or only certain counter currencies with others. The higher the Order of TS traded the greater the options afforded the trader but the greater the complexity. What does the individual trader seek ? I prefer to let the trader decide. This method can indeed become highly complex and complicated when traded in hedge or other advanced formats. Especially in dynamic mode when considering floating DD% and the unfolding equity curve and knowing what pairs at what times and what lot sizes need to be applied to stabilize the account. For this type of purpose an advanced EA would be rather useful. The good news though is that a trader need not get too advanced in the M TTT M Strategy if they do not wish too. Why ? Recall that we only require 2 winners from 9 entries to be profitable when trading a Triangulated Set of Order 3. Any more than 2 winners from the 9 entries and the account is starting to look really good. In any case it does not take that long to decide what total risk to apply across the account, then based on the TS Order# the risk per trade, sub in the octave gap, the pip value per lot into the lot size formula for the 9 entries and you are almost done. Deciding what TS's to trade is at the traders discretion. The choice can be a detailed exercise itself if you want it to be or it can be a very simple approach. For example, a trader could consider the base and counter currency counts in a TS('s) they plan to trade. How many AUD as base ? How many AUD as counter ? How many CAD as base ? How many CAD as counter ? How many GBP as base ? How many GBP as counter ? How many NZD as base ? How many NZD as counter ? What about when a trader uses CHF ? What about when a trader uses EUR ? What about when a trader uses JPY ? What about when a trader uses SGD ? As I said the approach can become rather complex rather quickly if you allow it and this is before trading has even started. Controlling floating DD using base and counter currencies in a dynamic mode is another thing altogether. I am yet to find an EA or indeed a human to determine the best level for an entry. Sure they get it right sometimes but most of the time they are far from being right. The M TTT M Strategy to some extent relies a little bit more on the probability of getting multiple losers and only needing a very poor win loss ratio to be profitable. Use the weekend to study the material, sort out some TS's and the order you wish to trade and next week unleash it in the market in demo mode. Good Trading, Masterrmind.............

If a loss on the setup of -9% is too high then consider reducing the risk per trade to 0.5% then the max loss is -4.5% and a max gain of +18% . Trading TS Order 5 A 1% risk per trade gives a range of -15% to +60% . If a loss on the setup of -15% is too high then consider reducing the risk per trade to 0.5% then the max loss is -7.5% and a max gain of +30% . If a loss of this magnitude is also too much then apply 0.25% risk per trade then the max loss is -3.75% and a max gain of +15% . Perhaps TS Order 1 is more suitable afterall there are only 3 trades to manage and the potential full loss at 1% risk per trade is only -3% . Numbers and statistics will only get you so far. At the end of the day what really counts is the reality of the trade setup. It is the traders choice to decide which risk profile they prefer. Masterrmind.............

Triangulated Set Order 3 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD The Lot sizes are calculated as follows: Pair 1 = AUDNZD Octave gap is 15.3 Pip Value is 7.02 Lot Size = 100/[15.3*7.02] = 0.93 lots Pair 2 = AUDJPY Octave gap is 19.5 pips Pip Value is 8.91 Lot Size = 100/[19.5*8.91] = 0.57 lots Pair 3 = NZDJPY Octave gap is 9.8 pips Pip Value is 8.91 Lot Size = 100/[9.8*8.91] = 1.14 lots Pair 4 = EURUSD Octave gap is 15.3 pips Pip Value is 10 Lot Size = 100/[15.3*10] = 0.65 lots Pair 5 = GBPUSD Octave gap is 15.3 pips Pip Value is 10 Lot Size = 100/[15.3*10] = 0.65 lots Pair 6 = EURGBP Octave gap is 7.6 pips Pip Value is 13.33 Lot Size = 100/[7.6*13.33] = 0.98 lots Pair 7 = AUDCAD Octave gap is 30.5 pips Pip Value is 7.83 Lot Size = 100/[30.5*7.83] = 0.41 lots Pair 8 = GBPCAD Octave gap is 30.5 pips (revised to 61 pips on current chart) Pip Value is 7.83 Lot Size = 100/[61*7.83] = 0.20 lots Pair 9 = GBPAUD Octave gap is 61 pips Pip Value is 7.67 Lot Size = 100/[61*7.67] = 0.21 lots Clearly an MT4 indicator could be created to do the lot size calculations based on a few user inputs !

I'm attempting to introduce the M TTT M Strategy in its most basic form so that traders can understand the method. Then once they show that they have the basics then I will accelerate the learning curve for those interested. Traders are free to trade the method in its most basic form or move onto more advanced formats (yes it can become incredibly complex). By this I mean that deeper thinking can be applied in trading the method. For example, 1. Bias is long AUD (major turning point, sentiment, fundamentals, other technicals or expectations etc) so I'll go long 2 pairs and short the cross. 2. Since I'm now long AU I might use TS's that are correlated a certain way over a certain TF based on my expectation for time in trade. 3. Now I'll consider the impact of trading the other currencies that currently make up the TS in the AUD setup 4. A trader might start with a TS Order 3 but have prepared a possible extention to a TS Order 5 by adding in TS#4 and TS#5 for certain events. 5. A trader may wish to design 2 by TS Order 3 setups with Ts A Order 3 triggered before TS B Order 3 (risk clearly factored in ofcourse) 6. Many more scanarios can be examined and some become rather complex rather quickly. I am more than willing to discuss simple random TS's of any reasonable Order. Initially I'll only discuss the M15 approach to avoid confusion but later I'll take the lid off the higher TFs (H1, H4, D1 etc). Not all complex TS's will suit all traders hence the reason why I'm starting with a basic TS design almost random in nature. Its then up to the trader to decide if they are happy to focus on say a TS Order 1 trading only 3 pairs or to progress to an Order 3 or above. Hedging of TS's is also an interesting area of discussion. Plenty more to come in the M TTT M Strategy. Note that this time of the year is good for discussions since the market becomes less active leading up to the end of the year. I'll still trade TS's though but only on the demo account and I would suggest other traders do the same. Come mid January 2018 there will be plenty of opportunities to trade multiple TS's.

Yes an EA or script that closes out some or all of your trades at a pre-determined Gain in Equity ($ or %) can be used if that's what you want to do. However, by doing this you are effectively scalping the market for perhaps smaller gains depending on what level of gain you set in the EA/script. If you go through the manual part and design a TS of say Order 3 with 9 pairs then you will know in advance what gain follows after X_winners. In fact it is the same gain in equity for any TS Order 3 so the pairs traded are irrelevant to a point. A TS Order 3 in its rawest form stands to lose as much as 9% of the account or gain up to 36% (if 1% risk/trade is used on a 4 to 1 R:r ratio). So assuming you have all the trades in the TS (assuming an Order 3) set with their correct stops and TPs then you could set a %gain in Equity close. But what value would you apply to the Equity gain closure ? 1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% etc Then I'd be asking you why this value ? Why not just let the trades run their course ? The trader has the final say on the matter but I'd tend to be more focussed on what I stand to lose on a TS setup rather than what I might win. Food for thought. Masterrmind.............

I hope several traders have gone through the 'fun' part of determining the appropriate lot size of a given pair in a TS setup. An alert trader would have already realized that the variables that make up the lor size formula could easily be coded into an indicator to make life simpler. Once trades are entered the trader makes a final mouse over of the SL lines on the chart to ensure risk per trade is &lt;= assigned risk. If any trader/coder wants to create such an indicator then by all means but only post mq4 file to the thread unless you PM it to me first and then I'll post an ex4 to the thread. This is so I can check the code before adding it to the M TTT M system. Failing that I may add in some additional code to a current indicator so that the lot sizes are visible for any account balance and any user defined risk per trade or indeed even a total risk per TS setup can be used.

If you ultimately will lose 9% than you might want to set tp at 18%

--- 帖子 #40 ---
You might also want to think about how many currencies your are going long and short. You should not go long for example AUD too many times because if AUD fails to go long you will be losing on all pairs that are long AUD. So for example TS sets use AUD for 1 set NZD for the other and GBP for the third. Also I tried TS of 3 which included 9 pairs. But I made sure all the long trades were close to -2/8 and the short trades were close to 2/8 . 4 trades ended up with SL , 4 ended up with TP and I closed the last trade at profit because its friday. So great result so far. But I must stress I picked my sets according to where the price was in relation to the octaves.

Reducing the risk is always a great idea but the R:r needs to be consistent otherwise over the longer term there is a much higher chance that your account may get eaten alive. You must keep the reward to risk ratio at 4 to 1 and not less. So if you risk 9% on a given TS Order 3 then the gain needs to be a possible 36% when trading in a Triangulated Set format. TS Order 1 total risk (r) is -3% ... total gain (R) is +12% ... R:r = 4 to 1 TS Order 3 total risk (r) is -9% ... total gain (R) is +36% ... R:r = 4 to 1 TS Order 5 total risk (r) is -15% ... total gain (R) is +60% ... R:r = 4 to 1 Not all traders have the same 'loose' risk tolerance as other traders. So the risk applied has to be at the individual traders discretion based on his/her own particular personality for risk tolerance. This is why I always say in FX retail trading never trade with money that you cannot afford to lose! Having said this, it in no way implies that a trader should lose all care about risk ... not at all. I would take a guess and say that the majority of traders would perhaps only be willing to risk about 5% on a trading setup of this design. Often for a single trade the norm in the industry (retail) is to not risk more than 2% on average per trade. Although this figure is reasonable I would not apply this to my strategy or a similar strategy using an average sized account because depending on the configuration of the TS it is highly unlikely to have every trade get stopped out for maximum loss. So I apply risk based on many more factors than a simple single value which does not always tell the whole story. On average I would say that traders are more likely to apply 0.5% per trade on a TS Order 3 (live account) for a total possible loss of 4.5%. Some traders might start off at lower risk (say 0.25%) and as the number of TS's increases slowly build up to say 1% risk per trade. There are many ways to play it. Starting off well under your 'usual' level of risk tolerance is the best approach. As confidence builds up over time slowly start applying a little bit more risk. Later traders will learn how to offset some of the risk by applying the right combinations of TS's at the right time. Traders will also learn how to start with smaller risk initially on a lower Order TS and then add into this TS to create a higher TS. Masterrmind...............

Yes the balance of currencies in a TS is important. A trader who is weighted heavily say to the long side of the AUD currency must have a Plan B in place so that if the strength of AUD reverses then the trader knows exactly which pairs and at what volumes need to be opened. This is trade mangement. As I've mentioned in Post 1 if you can get into a setup closer to the outer boundaries of the MML Grid then you stand a fairly good chance of getting some decent trades and potentially some healthy profit. But if price runs on then of course a trade can be stopped out although the risk per trade is uniform across all entries. You should post your charts to the thread. I'm a big believer in posting setups before the fact and following these trades through to completion with full transparency. This does not mean that I would expect every single trade taken to be posted before the fact and outlined in advance of the fact but at least a few. I would like to see your entries please so if you could post them here that would be great. 4 winners and 4 losers and a close on 1 trade for some profit on Friday (good trade mangement here!) should have yielded over 9%. This is a very good result. Try to think in terms of compounding. Just a small compounding rate over a long period of time is incredibly powerful and potentially very profitable. However, there may be some TS's that are net losers so we need to be aware of this and trade accordingly. What TS's did you trade ? Did you apply a strict 4 to 1 ratio on every trade ? What was the gain% ? What was the DD ? How many hours or days did it take to get this result ? Masterrmind.............

Stop Loss Global Adjustments If you find over time that several trades on the M15 TF template are getting stopped out almost prematurely and price is only just tagging the SL level then you should modify future stops to 1.5 * Octave Gap . The Trader can apply this new SL criteria across all future entries or only on the pairs which present the major issues. Typically the highly volatile pairs such as EN, GN, GJ are the ones that can whip around rather quickly and take out your stops. Ensure reward to risk ratio remains at 4 to 1. Ensure that all SLs and TPs remain within the upper or lower boundaries of the MML Grid. The MML Grid is our trading area and we do not go beyond its limits ! ps. on higher TFs I typically apply 1.5*Octave Gap as the SL but there is no reason why it can't be applied to an M15 Chart too.

Triangulated Set Order 1 (3 Pairs traded) 3 L + 0 W = 3*(-1%) + 0*(+4%) = -3% 2 L + 1 W = 2*(-1%) + 1*(+4%) = +2% 1 L + 2 W = 1*(-1%) + 2*(+4%) = +7% 0 L + 3 W = 0*(-1%) + 3*(+4%) = +12% I like your formula because its easy to code and can be used as MM in any strategy. About correlation hedge is my main manual strategy and I knowed triangular since long time ago but I never saw real utility because its like a limited subset of classic correlation. Then your way open my mind about how play it

Hi MASTERRMIND I like this part of strategy and still continue reading this thread stop loss and take profit only something confuse me for example buy EURUSD / GBPUSD sell EURGBP depends of MML line if entry buy order -2/8 what is the SL and TP ? if entry buy order 6/8 what is the SL and TP ? if entry buy order -2/8 SL is -1/8 is correct ? and TP ? if entry buy order 6/8 SL is 5/8 is correct ? and TP ? SL and TP take bar close the MML line cross ? if 1% risk means $1000 account loss $10 only correct ? lot size how calculate ? Please explain Thanks

Let me take a stab at it… Each important number is color coded so that it is easy to follow where I got it from. Assume acct balance of $5000 1% of $5000 is $ 50 Meaning each trade to hit its SL will lose approximately $50 and (given risk-reward ratio of 1: 4 ) each trade that hits TP will gain approximately $200 TS Order 1 (3 pairs traded) Pairs: GBP/USD GBP/JPY USD/JPY Using M15 charts Pair 1 = GBPUSD Octave gap is 15.2 Pip Value is $ 10 Lot Size for GBPUSD = 50 /[ 15.2 * 10 ] = 0.32 lots SL for GBPUSD = 15.2 pips TP for GBPUSD = ( 15.2 * 4 ) = 60.8 pips Pair 2 = GBPJPY Octave gap is 19.5 Pip Value is 8.87 Lot Size for GBPJPY = 50 /[ 19.5 * 8.87 ] = 0.28 lots SL for GBPJPY = 19.5 pips TP for GBPJPY = ( 19.5 * 4 ) = 78 pips Pair 3 = USDJPY Octave gap is 9.8 Pip Value is 8.87 Lot Size for USDJPY = 50 /[ 9.8 * 8.87 ] = 0.57 lots SL for USDJPY = 9.8 pips TP for USD = ( 9.8 * 4 ) = 39.2 pips The options with this setup would be: Long (GBPUSD and GBPJPY) and short USDJPY OR Short (GBPUSD and GBPJPY) and long USDJPY Does that sound right?

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Same as above but adjusting to a 1.5 times of Octave size for SL maintaining risk:reward ratio at 1:4 (only changes colored) __________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Pair 1 = GBPUSD Octave g ap is 15.2 Pip Value is $ 10 Lot Size for GBPUSD = 50 /[ 15.2 * 10 ] = 0.32 lots SL for GBPUSD = 15.2 * 1.5 = 22.8 pips TP for GBPUSD = ( 22.8 * 4 ) = 91.2 pips Pair 2 = GBPJPY Octave gap is 19.5 Pip Value is 8.87 Lot Size for GBPJPY = 50 /[ 19.5 * 8.87 ] = 0.28 lots SL for GBPJPY = 19.5 * 1.5 = 29.25 pips TP for GBPJPY = ( 29.25 * 4 ) = 117 pips Pair 3 = USDJPY Octave gap is 9.8 Pip Value is 8.87 Lot Size for USDJPY = 50 /[ 9.8 * 8.87 ] = 0.57 lots SL for USDJPY = 9.8 * 1.5 = 14.7 pips TP for USD = ( 14.7 * 4 ) = 58.8 pips

Yes and all this trading falls within the confines of the MML Grid. I suggest testing it out on M15 and then applying the same principles test out the higher time frames. You can test it by choosing random TS's, hedged TS's and other combinations. Money management, trade management and risk management are the keys to successful trading! Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #50 ---
At first there is some information to read and understand to obtain the basic knowledge. Consider entry precisely from an MML line. The SL is 1 octave gap or from 1 MML line to the next MML line. For a long trade the SL is placed on the next lower MML level. For a short trade the SL is placed on the next higher MML level. Attached Image (click to enlarge) No matter the pair the SL is always at least 1 octave gap and the rward to risk ratio is always 4 to 1 not less. Sometimes the entry for the cross might be at an unlikely MML level but to complete the TS the trade either has to be taken (and for all 3 trades) or the whole TS is rejected. If you reject 1 trade from a TS the whole TS is void. Now you must search for another suitable TS or multiple other TS's to trade. I tend to apply the cross pair entry in the correctly defines direction meaning opposite trade1 and 2 no matter where it aligns on the MML Grid. It is afterall a trade to potentially offset some of the risk on the other 2 entries. Calculating the lot sizes has been outlined in the orevious posts please take another look. I will be uploading an Indicator at some stage that does the work for you but best you can do this manually as well. ps. Refer to Post 1 and Post 27. Masterrmind............

Nice work. Well done. Going a bit deeper the TS Order 1 choice of pairs is rather interesting considering the case for going either long or short GBP. One of the reasons I prefer in general to trade TS Order 3 because it gives me plenty more flexibility in TS choice (9 instead of 3 pairs). However, the exercise was not about pair choice but rather the lot size calculations whick look good. A+ contribution of which I am very grateful. Masterrmind...........

Right On! Thanks for the nicely laid out posts. Nice to see a few traders making an attempt but you have nailed it my friend. ps. If you look at the example GU short I posted above its reason enough to start thinking about 1.5*Octave Gap for the SL. Masterrmind............

[quote=Masterrmind;10598687]Which scenario would you choose to trade and why ? Hi Masterrmind, reasonable approach, thanks for sharing. My 2 cents Look at/find out which is 2 of 3 pairs (circle) is has same direction. How i called this - "driver", usually one major pair rise/fall with cross pair relative to another major. Build your LLS/SSL (BBS/SSB) position depends to event like this according to Murray grid levels for each pair async. Sorry for my bad english.

I dont understand in this example which is "left hand" and "right hand". Its maybe AUDNZD ( left ) + AUDJPY ( right )? If left hand pairs are long then right hand cross must be short ! If right hand cross is long then left hand pairs must be short ! Triangulated Set Order 3 Scenario 1 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD

--- 帖子 #57 ---
[quote=deN.;10598792] Yes looking at movements of these pairs on a chart is important especially with respect to the MML Grid lines. If a trader has the time they could put together a long list of TS's. From this long list start with a favored TS (3 pairs) which could be based for a general bias towards say a preferred currencies strength. Then start adding in other TS's and logically build up a 'tradable' TS of Order N. The MML Grid is simply used as a line in the sand here ... to generate our trade entry levels and our trading domain for upper and lower price limits. Clearly the lower TFs such as M15 or even M5 tend to produce faster trade completion rates on average compared to say a H4 or D1 TF and this is simply a function of the width of the Octave Gap which is applied as a minimal SL level in the M TTT M Strategy, the larger the stop whilst maintaining a 4 to 1 reward to risk ratio logically means price has to travel much further when the octaves are bigger. Eventually, I will expand trader options so that higher TFs can be applied which is a logical progression from the lower TF's but a higher balance is better although given the same risk per trade and fixed R:r the choice of TF does not alter the extreme outcomes (max loss and max gain). However, larger TFs offer larger stops so price has more time to play out, harder to get stopped out but also harder to hit max TP. Sooner or later the trader will start to favor one TF over another but not all ytraders will choose the same TF. I offer different TFs (in time) simply because it offers more choice to a trader ! ps. Pair correlation (positive, negative, absolute) can also be factored in using one or many time periods to form a bias on a certain set of pairs. Masterrmind..............

From Post 53 I listed the following 6 TS Order 3 scenarios: Triangulated Set Order 3 Scenario 1 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD Scenario 2 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD Scenario 3 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD Scenario 4 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD Scenario 5 (same as Scenario 3 but not 1 trader spotted it ... ) TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD Scenario 5 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD Then I asked the following questions to which I got no response ! Note 1: Are there any missing combinations in the scenarios above ? Note 2: Which scenario would you choose to trade and why ? Note 1 ANSWER Yes there are more combinations based on 3^2-1 there should be 8 scenarios in total. Scenario 6 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD Scenario 7 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD Scenario 8 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD I will wait for a trader to attempt to answer the question in Note 2.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Who can tell me how many combinations there are in a TS Order 5 ? What about TS Order 7 and TS Order 9 ... how many combinations in these Orders ? Now you can see that the simple little Triangulated Sets can start to become complicated and complex rather quickly. And we haven't even started to look at deeper strategies yet ! In a TS Order 3 we have seen that there are 8 combinations (are there ??) so not only can a trader pick 3 different TS's (each has 3 pairs right!) from a large group of possibles but then they can also arrange the directions (long or short) 8 different ways.

TS Order 3 Attached Image (click to enlarge) TS 1 (AN, AJ, NJ) far left side vertical formation. TS 2 (EU, GU, EG) is central. TS 3 (AC, GC, GA) far right side vertical formation. Being a Monday the action can be slower than other days but this PA today is currently not very exciting for opening trades. When I do enter the trades I will simply apply Scenario 1 which is as follows: Scenario 1 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD This means I will simply trade long all the blue colored pairs and short for the others. No thinking has gone into this TS Order 3 setup I'm simply going to trade the first scenario on the list. Plenty of discussion will follow including an analysis of the trade outcomes (good or bad). Then the next TS Order 3 (if the market does not completely go flat !) will have plenty more thinking hoing into it. I could trade both TS Order 3 setups on separate trading accounts with the same broker and same start balance but not at this early learning phase as it might cause some confusion and I'm trying to avoid that as much as possible.

TS Order 3 (almost random approach) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Check the stops and the TPs to ensure 4 to 1 R:r is maintained throughout. Due to pending orders on many trades there is no immediate guarantee that these trades will trigger today. If price is close enough to an MML line then I enter at market otherwise its a pending order. Masterrmind.............

Simply checked all trade stops by mousing over the SL lines. Adjusted the stops on 2 trades as they were marginally over the 1% assigned limit (or $100 in the case of this account balance). Masterrmind..............

--- 帖子 #67 ---
cannot work, you need larger stop loss for this method, min 20 pips

--- 帖子 #68 ---
That can create an unbalance hedge because you can overlap some Order groups partially making the max risk bigger than theorical. I think that problem is the difficult part of manage this MM. You can take different approaches but I'm not sure if one its enough for cover all possibilities. Maybe depending how many groups have their pairs opened and if they are profitable or not you have use a fixed approach like your pending orders or one more flexible. Im thinking group all partial Order groups in one and work like normal Order group with all his pairs opened

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Perhaps you would be so kind as to elaborate as to exactly why it "cannot work". Saying that the stops need to be a minimum of 20 pips does not really tell me anything. The first TS Order 3 is simply an example and as posted above I mentioned that it was an almost random type approach since all I did was start trading Scenario 1 which has 6 pairs running long and 3 pairs short. Lets wait until this first one completes and then as I also stated above I'll make plenty of comments about it. Masterrmind...........

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Correct ! The first TS Order 3 is to create some discussion. I certainly did not say it would be a good example, nor did I say it would be bad. It is simply 1 example of many. There are many different approaches but there are also some that are generally far better than others. Its great to start talking about the good, the bad, and the ugly about such a 'non-thinking' type TS entry. Remember though that all that is needed to be a successful cycle of TS's in this Order 3 is to have only 2 winning trades. So as soon as 2 trades out of 9 close in profit, I can if I wish simply close out all remaining trades and move onto the next. I can look at all 8 scenarios for this TS Order 3 (with its TS pairings) which I might do very soon and suggest which ones I would favor over others and the reasons why. The current demo account will be the forward test for a few different ones including a different choice of pairs as well. Masterrmind............

Here you go my friend. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Note that the pip value formula also depends on the exchange rate so it does vary a little over a short period of time. What is the denominated currency of your trading account? Not US$ I would say. Octave Gap is 15.3 pips on my broker. Masterrmind...........

I agree but you know when you trading you never can be sure about in the future you will get a bad row of losses. Then when I think about maximize profits I'm doing thinking in get a good bag for cover the future bad moments more that be rich faster. Ideal trading is your bad moments never eat fully your last profits doing your long term profits grow over time. Then when you have market in your favor the first thing you try is maximize profits. About group partial opened groups idea is like this... TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD We can think a group will need a X candles/time range for decide if its a full or partial pair. You dont want trades in one group are opened with a big time shift because that not only create very unbalance hedge. This affect to future trades opened in that TS because you need all pairs are closed in that TS are closed for open that TS again breaking the natural cycle ( market is a variable time cycle of waves ) Then we set a 4 hours max time since first trade opened in one pair for taking it as full TS OPENED PAIRS: TS 1 = AUDNZD ( partial group ) TS 2 = EURUSD, GBPUSD, EURGBP ( full group because all trades opened before 4 hours first pair was opened ) TS 3 = GBPCAD, GBPAUD ( partial group ) As T2 is full you let run it until every pair reach their limits. TS 1/3 can have 2 options: 1) You mix both in one TS ( AUDNZD, GBPCAD, GBPAUD ) and treat them as full group 2) You mix both like above but when group reach sone profit/loss you take individual pair actions. - In case group is green you close the bad trade letting run profitable pairs. - In case group is red you can take different approaches. One can be close bad pairs. Other option is close or not depending if new pairs were added and how are performing. And the last option depends if one partial TS is full over time. Then you can check when a TS is full if have better profit than partial mixed TS for deatach it and take it as normal full TS. I think that can be the simple base of a dynamic TS selection. More complex selection can be later

This system works because the odds are on our side. Consider the probability of having all 9 losses in a row ! Now consider the chances that this repeats itself in the very next cycle of TS's. Then consider the probability of winning 2 trades out of 9 ! Often if you let a trade run on the PA might reverse and you get stopped out unless you close it early. A more complex or should I say a far more thought out TS Order 3 will have its advantages however, a higher TF works better most of the time ! The more you trade these setups the more interesting they become. Its an great system but let the examples pave the way. Over time I'll move towards more thought out TS's but for now lets just show what happens in trading any old setup but always maintaining a 4 to 1 reward to risk ratio and a known %loss per trade. Thanks for the comments they are appreciated. Masterrmind............

About reverse trades when you let run its some problem that use current approach. You never have guarantee price go in one direction will reach limit before turn direction and go opposite. Evidently your formula minimize the probabilities of losses because almost all combinations in one TS are profitable. But I'm not talking about improve the formula because for me the risk is fine. I'm talking about how manage that small combinations are loss for try reduce more the risk. If you have in 9 combination 7 winner and 2 loser we agree risk is very low. But 50/50% probabilites dont means you will get an uniform row of wins/losses. This is a big mistake when people like casino roulette black/red strategy. Martingale suffers same unbalance problem. Then have a favorable win ratio is one part of solution but the safest way is reduce loss probability to 0. Its impossible but closer to that number bigger probabilities to success in long term. Anyway since you exposed your MM idea I agree the base is very good and that is reason I'm interesting in check all weaks. Because as coder I have that defect. I always search the problems for fix it because the strongs never are a problem in systems

Some good points raised here. Yes I'm very big on MM and so I know that part of the method is rock solid. A trader is very likely to have some success even if they trade an almost random approach choosing weird types of TS setups in the MTTTM. I have managed to keep a few key principles very solid. The Money management. The chances of being net profitable by only having very few winning trades is a high probability. Spreading the risk over several trades. Assigning the risk per trade (fixed for the duration of that TS cycle of trades). So yes the strength of the MTTTM Strategy is very evident. There is no martingale in this method at all ... although it could be added if the system was continually dynamic by this I mean as a trade hits loss a new trade entered at higher lot size is immediately added and again applied with 4 to 1 R:r etc. DD management may need addressing in that case unless totla risk across all trades is considered and accounted for. I'm not sure this approach should be adopted but discussion is always welcome. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Questions for discussion: Weaknesses in the system are ??? How to choose pairs in a TS that are more likely to lead to profitable trades ??? Time frame to trade, M15, H1, H4, D1 ??? Successful techniques that can be applied over the longer term to strengthen the method ??? Masterrmind............

Hi Masterrmind, thanks for your help, your are right that my thinking is in Euro and I am too close to Britain as I spend there every year a couple of weeks so I have the rates always in mind, but 1,33 we had some years ago and that confused me. I tested your ideas, but not exactly as I typed some errors, in a 123Bonus live account, terrible conditions ( lot 100,000, min. lot 0.10, next is 0.20, my EAs not operating) but it got the power, the main idea was eur/USD, usd/GBP with the ratio eur/GBP and my favorite small brothers of the Euro, the swissies, and audCad, audUSD, with ratio usdCad, two testing session with those result, this account will expire in two days and I guess I can not blow it in time with this system, incredible, but I am impressed ... anyhow, you did a very good work ... I have to check those MT5 EA if I can get some ideas out of it and bring it to work

--- 帖子 #84 ---
For me weak area are that small loss probabilites in a TS but I think this because I'm seeing how apply in a auto system. Auto systems are silly because all "magic" trader hand dissapear. Even in a fixed rules like your 4:1 system software have an awesome way to always take the worst decision then every small issue in a system can be a big problem in their execution. As manual system I think current risk is very low for a experienced trader and very valid at current state

--- 帖子 #85 ---
One very important point I will mention though is simply this .... there are so many options between trade setups on even the same pairs that for say a TS Order 3 that even if 2 traders were given the identical TS setup (except direction) that both their choose of direction for each pair and their final results may differ wildly. Something has to be left for the trader to decide and believe me this little point about choice is a huge one. Something for traders to think about. How do I choose the best pairs and their directions in a given TS of any Order to beat the next trader at his/her own game. Longer term consistency is what many traders attempt to achieve but very few ever do ! I've presented a part of the method, plenty is not visible but a healthy discussion might help to bring other points to the surface. Although I certainly recommend that keen traders follow along at how I will eventually choose the pairs in the TS set and then try to understand why a big part will be at their own discretion and how they control their MM, trade management and risk management. Its sure to be an interesting journey especially when we start trading live .... next year. Masterrmind............

Thanks for the transparency togerhard and sharing your results. Good work! Masterrmind............

One area that is rather discretionary is for example, in the situation when the TS cycle is net positive and the trader needs to decide whether to let all trades run their complete course to stop out or TP or close out for small profit. I'm sure a rule (or as I like to call them..guidelines) could be applied. Something like the following: If &gt;= 2 trades in a TS Order 3 have been closed out at full TP and current session is NY, if current running trades are net positive then close out all. Food for thought. Masterrmind...........

I would like to add my opinion to the MoneyManagement and for traders who keep positions over night/weekend, in case someone trades with an 10k account, 1 lot and 1 percent SL, the trade gone with 10-15 pips not in the desired direction as we know. Furthermore mind the Spread … my ECN broker of first choice (see my TE) has an average Spread during London/NY Session from 0.6 to 0.8 Pips the currencies I do trade and what I can see. Friday Night at close we had for example AUD/USD 64 Pips EUR/CHF 36 Pips EUR/USD 15 Pips GBP/CHF 137 Pips Similar Spreads have to be paid during high impact News. I run an Expert in a VPS which gives me every certain time my Equity of my account, and it can happen that during Monday opening or red News, I do run a 10 to 15percent DD just because of Spread because of some pending news because of some increasing. Recently I attended a Seminar of one of my three Brokers so I could hear the Brokers voice that a very plenty of accounts stopped out because of suddenly, unexpected high Spreads and over leveraged or position run into SL because of increase of Spread. I questioned one of the full time traders what he is doing to avoid so he told to me, after NY session, he will take out all his stops and pending orders and give in start Tokyo or London session. More Money Management As I typed 12 orders manually and closed them so … in my opinion, you need an EA who does your MM and take the profit/toxic from the table at an certain amount, if manually, in a quick move the winners gone to losers, the broker might increase Spread and the setup gone into the brokers pocket

--- 帖子 #89 ---
sorry, the spread was AUD/USD 6.4 Pips EUR/CHF 3.6 Pips EUR/USD 1.5 Pips GBP/CHF 13.7 Pips

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Maybe some brokers blow out the spread crazy like in your post above. Always better to get out of trades is possible before the end of the week. But sometimes its not possible due to various reasons however, if you can get out then do it. Masterrmind..............

Is everyone clear on the entries I made ? Basically, if price was close to the MML line then I'd enter at market setting 1 octave gap for the stop and 4*Octave gap for the TP Although I only used Buy Stop and Sell Stop orders on this TS Order 3 I may also apply limit orders (Buy limit and Sell limit). In general I would apply a Buy Limit order if price was just a bit above an MML line and I want to enter the trade slightly lower which may or may not involve a TP that could exceed the +2/8 MML line. If TP which currently has to move 4 octaves is at or below the extreme +2/8 MML then I might simply use a Buy Stop for the next MML above current price. Sell Limit similar except I'd be wanting to short from the next MML line up the chart and wanting price to drop of course. Ask questions if you are unsure as to the entries. I may post a few annotated charts after this current TS setup completes since I plan to make plenty of comments in due course. Masterrmind.............

This is the current situation on the account: Attached Image (click to enlarge) If it was a live account I would probably close all the trades out since every trade is positive at this time and it represents almost a 4% gain in equity for the day and it wasn't too hard of a day either. Nevertheless, I'll allow the trades to run on whilst I have some sleep. See you all tomorrow. ps. all trades stops checked and all trades TPs checked. Masterrmind..............

Hi Masterrmind I have placed 9 orders (Set of Order 3) on 15-Dec-2017 For Octive gap of 31 pips lot size 1.0 For Octive gap of 15.3 pips lot size 2.0 For Octive gap of 7.6 pips lot size 4.0 I am trying to get count of the pips gained (assuming pip value constant across pairs) as a basic version. This is current status of these 9 orders. Hope this is correct --Chandan

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Hi chandan655, I would say that your lot sizes have not been calculated correctly since they are all clean digits without decimal placings. The critical part though is not the lot size but the real risk per trade over all trades. Pip Value is NOT constant across all pairs (please read Post 1 again when you have some free time). Look at some of my screenshots on different pairs ... clearly the pip values are different (except a few cases where they are the same). For 9 trades if you assign 1% per trade then every SL must be 1% of the initial balance prior to a planned TS entry. Clearly risking 9% in total on the account for all trades is not favorable to all traders. In this case they should halve the risk applied per trade and use 0.5% per trade (for every trade) which will have a total risk of 4.5%. The trader needs to decide what is appropriate for them in terms of how much they want to risk on a TS setup. There are a few posts previously that explain the Lot size calculation and you should have the Pip_Value indicator to assist. 1. Assign a risk per trade (0.1%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 1%, etc) choose only 1 ofcourse 2. Then based on account balance calculate how many dollars, euros or other currency this equates too. eg 1% * $10 000 = $100 3. Obtain the data for each pair (Octave Gap and pip value) ... lets assume Octave Gap = 25 pips and Pip_Value = $10 4. Input the values into the Lot Size formula Lot size = $Risk per trade /[Octave Gap*Pip_Value] =$100/[25*10] = 100/250 = 0.4 lots Now you know for that particular trade that the position size has to be 0.4 lots. And if the trade hits SL the loss in $ must be 100 which is 1% of your initial account balance. Note 1: When you are planning to set up a new TS use the same initial starting balance for all trade calculations which for the example above it would mean using 10 000 as the balance value. Note 2: Every calculation must be completed prior to trading the TS setup Note 3: Accounting correctly for the risk on every trade is very important so get it right. ps. your results are looking good but what account balance are you trading and what is the assigned risk per trade ?

OK Quick update on my set. The EURGBP short was stopped out. (-0.40) The EURUSD long reached TP for one win. (+1.60) The GBPUSD long is still open and is in positive territory. I could close it now for a smaller win or I can let it run. I can move the SL to somewhere in profit and forget about it. Or I can just forget about it as is and wait for it to stop out or hit TP. Its about 60 pips in profit so I may just close it and run. But even if it did get stopped out, the set is already positive as we have one full TP win which is all that is needed for a TS of order 1 to be net positive.

Sometimes price will charge up very close to your TP. Attached Image (click to enlarge) But then roll over and head back down the chart.

At some point both common sense and some trade management is required. What to do ? 1. Let it run its course. 2. Close it out in profit now 3. Tighten or trail the stop If the trades are allowed to run their full course then the outcome is known in advance. Either the trade loses 1% of the account balance or it adds about 4% to the account balance. If a set of trades has been running over night and there is a net gain on the account and you want to start the next setup say around London Open then perhaps a guideline needs to be posted to Post 1 suggesting that a closure is ok if the setup is net positive. Ultimately this will be at the discretion of the trader. However, there may be little point in allowing the last few trades to run their course over multiple days when the pairs have simply decided to trade in a tight range not hitting the stop and not hitting the TP. Later I will update Post 1 with a set of guidelines for such a case and then add to it if necessary over time. Its like the trades that I have open now, I may close them all out about an hour or so before I plan to tarde the next TS Order 3. I have had 1 winner on NJ which has erased the losses on the first 3 losers but at least 1 more winner would be great. Other points of concern is say when the trades have opened in London or early NY sessions and then hit the slower moving Asian session. The temptation might be to close out all trades if net profit and then reload for the next TS setup! Lets see. Masterrmind.............

What if: Risk per trade = 0.2% =0.2/100*50 000 = 100 SL = -0.2% per trade TP = +0.8% per trade Max Loss = 27*(-0.2%) = -5.4% Max Gain = 27*(+0.8%) = +21.6% Risking up to 5.4% on a TS Order 9 setup might suit more traders however I would recommend comparing this to a TS Order 3. A TS Order 3 applies the risk across 9 pairs and only 2 winners are needed to be in the money. A TS Order 9 applies the risk across 27 pairs but you need 6 winners to be in the money. Consider account balance requirements for both options. A well funded account may not necessarily mean that an Order 9 needs to be traded. Trader choice ! Masterrmind.............

I think this is basically random trading. so if you have almost 0 chance of losing all 27 trades you also have 0 chance of winning all 27. Which means if you lose 6 trades in a row you could win 6 in a row. there is no edge. The best thing about this system is 4 to 1 rr. I used mm lines for direction and 4 to 1 rr tp and it worked better than random ts.

Hi Mastermind Please explain How this trade performed ? The picture show 4 orders touch MML lines triggered so 4 orders continue run without close manually or Close order manually opposite order triggered ? We need wait until SL TP hit (4xorder)? ( Octave gap is 1X 15.3 for SL and Octave gap is 4X15.3 for TP) Please explain how about this 4 orders maintain Thanks

As I use dashboards commonly ( 28 pairs ) I can tell you the pairs have a natural compensation behaviour even your strategy works as individual pairs and not as correlation like your strategy. Then with TS looks very had take the worst scenario. Really is easy fit inside a profitable combination by default. This have a reason when you think pairs never move straight and every wave cycle some pairs compensate partial or fully the losses of others temporally. And from third profitable level ( 9º level ) "19 L + 8 W = 19*(-1%) + 8*(+4%) = +13%" protfis are quite good

--- 帖子 #107 ---
The first TS Order 3 was as stated in earlier posts an almost random setup. I simply chose the 3 by TS's then out of the 8 combinations simply traded the first one. Look how many pairs were long compared to short ? To add another level of randomness I will ask a trader to post which scenario 2 to 8 they want me to trade. The first trader who posts a single number will be the next TS Order 3 that gets traded. Then I will repeat the request for the next TS Order 3. Then a discussion of trading results will be outlined. After this I will choose a TS Order 3 with plenty of thought...trade a few sets and then compare these results to the somewhat random type setups currently being traded. The strategy is not about winning 27 trades in a row. In fact even trading a TS Order 3 with 9 entries it is not about having 9 winners. Rather my M TTT M strategy is all about the minimum number of trades required to achieve a net positive gain whilst maintaining a strict risk management approach. The MML lines as explained in Post 1 are indeed for forming entry levels stop levels and TP levels. Masterrmind.......

The trader decides on the time of planned entry into the market. All entries must be placed as close to the same time as possible however expect a small delay due to manual entry of orders. Higher TS Orders will take longer to enter via a manual approach but all entries should be set as fast as possible and within 15 minutes. In a faster moving market the trader needs to be well prepared and organised with the set of trade entries headed to the market. The planned time of entry into the market could be X-hours before or after any session or at session open times or any other times. All trades are set either at market or pending orders (Buy Stop, Sell Stop or Buy Limit, Sell Limit). Post 1 outlines the MML lines that short and long trades are allowed to be entered. The exception to the rule (guideline) is the single cross or pair on the other side of the equation which can be applied from any MML line. However, it is preferable that such a trade be made as close as possible to an MML line or set as a pending order at the precise MML line. I cannot tell you the performance of the trade because there is no way I can know at what time the entry was made or was planned to be made. A trader can also drop down to an M5 TF and wait for the candle to close in the direction of TP. A long entry would then be made at the close of preferably the first M5 close (bullish only) above the nearest MML line. A short entry would then be made at the close of preferably the first M5 close (bearish only) below the nearest MML line. I hope this answers your question and also offers some additional information regarding trade entries. Masterrmind.............

Once you have all the pairs ready to be sent to the market from your TS Order # setup, all trades must be entered at the same time (whatever time you choose). Yes once the trade is entered into the market (at market or pending order) then you let it run its course, SL or TP is eventual outcome. At this early stage of the M TTT M Strategy trades should be allowed to run their course as much as possible. Later I may introduce additional trade management techniques which relate to the current state of the setup (wins Vs losses etc). Masterrmind............

Certain TS Order sizes may on average produce better results than others. Certain trading systems out there perform very well during periods of highly favorable data but collapse when unfavorable data hits the account. The "more pairs the better" is NOT necessarily relevant here in fact many times less produces more. More pairs offers far more flexibility but if all trades have been entered at the same time it is a far different story than starting with a smaller TS Order and building into it as the PA unfolds . As I've mentioned a few times, what I'm attempting to show initially in this M TTT M Strategy is the power of the MM and a very basic approach, almost a set and forget type approach so that the majority of traders can learn and trade it. If the thread progresses very well and with great interest then I may outline more of the advanced trade management strategies. Yet many traders may not ever need to learn this part of the strategy because it can be highly profitable in the very basic approach. The advanced trade management adds another degree though.

I opened TS3 yesterday at London open EURUSD (S), GBPUSD (S), EURGBP (L) AUDNZD (S), AUDJPY (L), NZDJPY (L) AUDCAD (S), EURCAD (S), EURAUD (L) Used only stop entry orders at closest MML line to desired trade direction. Now I have 5 losers, 1 pending order did not trigger (canceled it after few hours), 1 TP, 3 trades still running. At this time whole TS3 is breakeven. Very interesting idea to explore, thank you for it, but would like to hear more about better pair selection and MM after entries. btw I selected totally random pairs, just did position size calculations. And one small notice: EURAUD gap was like ~15 pips at moment of entry and that is too small stop for volatile pair, hit my SL by a pip and shot to TP

Now its only the basis but I think you have many implementations as colors. Then it will depend of trader

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Although it is your choice to cancel a pending order. In your case I would have allowed the pending order to remain active because you have had 5 losers and only 1 winner with 3 trades still running. Why not give the TS setup a bit more of a chance and allow the pending order time to trigger. If I were you I would reapply the pending order with the original settings and simply let it sit. Once you know you have enough winners to be net positive then this is the time you should delete out the pending order and not before. Perhaps I will add this to the guidelines in Post 1. Thank you for sharing but please provide a few charts if you can ... it makes for easier discussion. Masterrmind..............

Exactly right ! For a TS Order 3 which trades 9 pairs there are 8 combinations of the pair ordering (long short per each TS side etc). So depending on the trader he/she might choose any one of these 8 combinations as a setup. Later I will start to outline some thought out combinations that I would trade. But not just yet since I want to show several (almost random type setups in the first place). Masterrmind.............

I think is not much relevant what TS you will use. Anyway in your TE you dont open all TS pairs at same time ( you use pending orders ) but in your last posts you talked about open all pairs in one TS at same time. Personally I like more not open all pairs at same time but I think you should limit how long a pending trade is waiting because you have GBPAUD 2 days without open creating an unbalanced TS and breaking the main rule about TS need always 3 pairs working

Assume time of entry is planned to be +10 GMT All orders should be placed (not necessarily triggered) within 15 minutes of GMT+10 from 1st to last entry or as close as humanly possible. This means that at market orders will hit the market first and be recorded at similar times. Pending orders will trigger in the market at some later time. However, the pending orders will also be placed in the initial stages but may not trigger in the market at the same time. This is perfectly ok and completely as expected. Pending order cancellation is at the discretion of the trader unless someone can show me that a closure within a certain time offers a benefit. However, if the trader is ok with cancelling the order after say 1 hour or 4 hours or 1 day then that is ok ... it is their choice ! You are correct about an unbalanced TS of which GA is a member. Attached Image However, had I placed an at market trade on GA the result would have been a quick -1% but that's playing with hindsight of course and at the time of planned entry no-one was to know. I'm allowing some degree of flexibility to the approach at this stage unless it is seen to be clearly negative to results. Risk management I am not flexible whatsoever. Trader has the choice to apply only at market orders, only pending orders, or a combination as dictated too by where price sits within the MML Grid. Each approach has its advantages and also disadvantages. So I leave it to the trader to make the choice, as it should be in this case. Masterrmind..............

Well my friend it looks like 2018 is going to be very interesting to say the least.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
This is my first post here and I must say I really missed out on answering the puzzles put out by you MM as I just started reading the thread and am not yet through. I will also mention that this method seems tedious in calculating lot sizes, stop losses etc to the general public since a lot of people don't fancy math related topics including ME (pls don't call us LAZY) so I think an indicator to just automate the process would be good as earlier mentioned in the thread. Now on to the above quoted questions: Weaknesses : 1. High possibility of one or two pairs in a TS not triggering Effects --- In a TS Order 1 that means only one pair is active which nullifies the idea and worse if this trade goes to loss thus ruining the idea. Even if it were a win we can't call it a TS trade anymore and can't be included in performance data. (Using TS orders in place could worsen the problem as it does not guarantee that all sets will be fully engaged. So the more the better doesn't hold here neither does the less the better too). --- Huge Time lag before a TS gets fully engaged in the market (that is, a pair gets triggered but the remaining two are left pending for hours on end) which might in turn reduce largely the prospects of winning or vice versa as prevailing market conditions could have changed. 2. Randomness in picking the order of pairs to trade (Although we are just in the basic testing phase to prove the methods viability) Effects --- Although very low likelihood of all three trades losing, the possibility still exists and as traders we want to reduce the possibiilty of loses to the barest minimum. (This affects mainly the TS Order1). How to choose pairs in a TS that are more likely to lead to profitable trades: 1. Correlation: Inverse Correlation, Direct Correlation 2. Pairs that are already in the Extreme MML Zones after using Correlation to initially choose. Time frame to trade, M15, H1, H4, D1: All Time Frames can be traded profitably even M1 depending on MML setiings, SL and TP goals. My choices/ suggestions though are: M15 with H1 or H4 MML settings H1 with H4 MML settings H4 with D1 MML settings D1 with W1 MML settings. Successful techniques that can be applied over the longer term to strengthen the method: 1. Restriction to only to only the bottom and top four MML levels using the H1 MML settings as usual: The idea behind this sugesstion is that since the MML lines depict our own S&amp;R, I think we should trade only the stronger set of S&amp;R. This will not significantly reduce the number of trades since we have over 28, 56 pairs including Metals. 2. Use H4 MML settings on the M15 charts to give stronger levels. Sometimes H1 and H4 extreme levels do align and it will be to our advantage also. 3. Only take trades that are already at our predefined levels - No pending orders to remove the weaknesses mentioned above. (We can always wait to see all levels reached). Etc, etc, etc. Wao, its really really exhausting to type. I doff my hat to you MM for your postings. I wonder how you do it. regards All, Rapzy Would love to continue reading the thread from where I stopped but am tired.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Yes my friend , indeed it might be. This is my 'intraday' type approach to the MML. However, the MTTTM method draws on minimizing the risk, forcing reward to risk and spreading the risk over several pairs. A novel approach in my opinion but very effective. Lets see what 2018 brings for the MTTTM. With xmas just around the corner I'm not sure that another TS setup is the best idea (might have to wait until early 2018 ... hmmm). ps. D1 Quad-MML will also start off again in early 2018. Masterrmind..............

--- 帖子 #132 ---
All in good time but at this stage the focus should be purely on the M15 template. Traders need to convince me they can outline TS setups in advance of the fact and follow the trades through to completion. Very much like the way I have done. Practice makes perfect ... or in FX retail trading hopefully it makes you just that little bit more consistent. Masterrmind...........

--- 帖子 #133 ---
All traders should be able to determine the correct lot sizes in a manual approach otherwise they do not understand enough about risk in trading. In any case an indicator is being coded in the background and once completed it will be uploaded to the thread for the lazy traders. Pending orders do have the potentially negative effect of not providing the risk offset for which they were designed in a triangulated setup. However, until I see some very convincing evidence that this pending order approach is detrimental to performance then they will remain. TS Order 1 setups should only be traded in very small accounts in my opinion so that smaller accounts can build up equity without creating too many margin issues. Then once the account is large enough, look at trading TS Order 3 as that is the bread winner. In terms of correlation a trade needs to realize that 2 different pairs do not retain identical correlation patterns over time, indeed they tend to oscillate, this occurs across many different time frames. " All Time Frames can be traded profitably even M1 depending on MML setiings, SL and TP goals. My choices/ suggestions though are: M15 with H1 or H4 MML settings H1 with H4 MML settings H4 with D1 MML settings D1 with W1 MML settings. " Would you care to elaborate further on this information, what are the settings for H1, H4, D1 and W1 ? The S&amp;R comments you made regarding H1 and H4 are interesting but why not ust jump straight to a monthly for the S&amp;R. I'd tend to leave this to the trader too. With my approach to the MTTTM Strategy I am more concerned with trading within the ranges of the MML Grid (M15 at this stage) by applying strict risk management. When the time comes to trade the higher TFs (with their own settings) a similar risk management approach will be applied... 4 to 1 solid as a rock. Thank you for your comments. Masterrmind.............

Pending orders at this stage will be left to the traders discretion. Nothing wrong with gaining additional information from HTFs. Anything to do with lagging oscillators is banned from this thread (I will update Post 1 to reflect this). The MTTTM template should be traded as is posted with no additional indicators added unless they are informative. MAs, MACD, RSI and that horrible stochastics must not be posted here. The MTTTM Method trades within the boundaries of the MML Grid as created by the appropriate template for the applicable TF. That is to say, an M15 template to trade on an M15 chart. Other tpls for other TFs in due course. Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #135 ---
I think you are very wrong on this but I also understand your thinking which I believe is as a result of this testing phase where we just pick pairs to trade randomly but its still not completely random. There is a process even in this testing phase. Read post one again. The first thing you should note is that you must have two same Base?Quote currencies in any pair. This alone puts you to work in deciding which to pick and eliminates a huge percentage of randomness at least in choosing pairs. Other elements of randomness would be totally gone when we go live. I wanted to add this as a flaw when I posted about the possible weaknesses in the method but cancelled it because it is NOT a system weakness so to say but a traders responsibility towards due diligence. Selecting pairs more intelligently. Trading in general when not planned out becomes random which is seen as gambling. There is a very thin line between trading and gambling as there is also in other spheres of life. Add randomness to anything and it becomes a gamble but THIS is NOT. Also if you understand this MTTM concept well you will know that you can't lose Three trades in a Row talk Less of Six even in this seemingly random looking testing phase. Cheers.

5th scenario

--- 帖子 #140 ---
I was referring to the quiz on lot sizes and sl you posted where only one person attempted and not that traders won't like to make those calculations to trade. If you must trade this then calculating lot sizes and sl is a must ofcourse. What I meant concerning MML settings for H1,H4 etc was: Normal H1 settings - P=64, MMP=60 but this should be used in the M15 TF; Normal H4 settings - MMP = 240 but applied to M15 or H1 TF I think this will draw the HTF lines on the lower TF which will give stronger rejection areas. I think using MN1 MML lines as S&amp;R will be too wide. All these and previous posts are just thoughts. Cheers.

Nice to see people using MML as I am not megalomaniac I prefer to rename them SRL - Support &amp; Resistance Lines whose name is self-explanatory about Murrey / Gann Support and Resistance Lines 1) Gann first used the division by 8 of the interval between a Low and a High - additional question how to choose the Low and the High 2) Gann / Murrey used a different version of above methodology by using a "fractal version" - 0/1, 0/10, 0/100,0/1000, 0/10.000 etc this version has the advantage to be more "stable" and to allow comparisons between all financial supports fluctuating within the same price range 3) fact is you can use the same methodology with whatever interval because you can "slice" it in 1/100 th

I think you are picking randomly when it comes to trading more than 1 set of TS. That is why I mentioned in my previos posts that instead of picking any TS set we should concentrate on pairs that are close to extreme levels of mml(post#29) I actually mentioned that I am having success with just trading pairs that are at extreme mml levels with 4:1 rr. meaning I am not triangulating but just picking favorable trades. uff Im tired of typing, lol.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Thanks for the settings that you would apply. However, they are very different to the ones that I would apply on higher TFs when trading the MTTTM Strategy. Projected TPs can apply HTF at P=64 settings in general provided a minimum 4 to 1 reward to risk ratio is adhered too. Most traders might find it easier to simply know that for every TP it has to be 4 times as many pips as the stop loss. An MML trader would know that price often hits the next MML lines on HTFs (trading on an M15 TF but TP set off a D1 MML line for example). You are starting to think along the same lines as me in terms of Octave Gaps being too wide ... this is worthy of consideration for sure. There is a trick to the process that I use which considers the stops, TPs and ADRs on a per pair basis and how well it fits within the MML Grid. The PA should be considered and an opinion formed on the likelihood that price will actually hit the TP level. Of course the answer is not known in advance but the trader should apply a reasonable and realistic approach. On higher TFs a trader should have analyzed previous data (historical) to form an expectation of how long a setup might take to complete. Again you never know in advance how long a future setup will take to complete but you can certainly form a pretty good opinion. Looking at the ranges in price that typically occur over a period of time allows a time line to be set (not fixed but expected). On smaller TFs such as M5 and M15 the settings (P=64, MMP=60) I have provided in the template are 'good enough' for most pairs but not for all . So the P=64 and MMP=60 settings are a best fit in general for the majority of pairs on the lower TFs (not the HTFs). Thinking is good as it adds value to the discussions and might even improve parts of the strategy. Masterrmind.............

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Ok but I will make a final volatility (likely) assessment of the market and either open a TS or not. Clearly this is not really the best time to be opening a TS Order 3 in general because the PA is very likely to die out. This would make hitting the TPs a difficult task. The other point is that it will not look very good to have several trades open and price going no where. Yes I am painting a bad picture here and who knows the volatility might remain but I see it as unlikely. What do other traders have to say about this ? Masterrmind............

GBPCAD This is an interesting order in that I am forced to apply a Sell Limit order due to the proximity of price to the lower extreme MML zone. Typically a long entry would be considered from this level in the MML Grid ... but not so when applying this forced Scenario 5. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Effectively I want price to drive up the chart trigger my short entry and then close 4 octaves lower at the -2/8 MML inside MML Grid. There are a few other trades on other pairs that breach the upper limits of the MML Grid (not really preferred) but it is within an octave. Note that the scario I'm being forced to trade is not really suitable to the PA within the MML Grid. But it will be traded nonetheless so hold on tight ! Masterrmind............

NZDJPY This trade was entered long at market close to the 7/8 MML.

So this time we chose any random TS and ended up with some pairs that are at not ideal MML lines. I guess giving a little analysis to select pairs with better current locations on MML grid would put odds a little bit in our favor compared to totally random picking. There's a nice MML grid dashboard indicator to help with that. GBPCAD is extremely unlikely to be profitable, octave gap (=stop loss) is too small to pick exact turning point. Same thing I'm seeing with MML grid on EURAUD. At London open it will be 30 pips or more very quickly.

According to GANN the keypoint is the understanding of the Time Price Relationship in Trading. This is your Scaling which translates in the reality The Time and Price Relationship The division by 8 of an interval of Price mimics the graphical representation of the Fibonacci serie To have a "correct" and efficient scaling whatever Time Unit you use , your Time Frame has ALSO to be divisble by 8 Hereunder the relationship between the Time frame and the Musical Octave

Yes thats the basic idea. Applying the MML Grid and especially trading from the extreme zones is where possible reversals in price occur. But they occur at other MMLs as well and on different TFs. So theyneed to be put into context. What I tend to look for is multiple layers of confluence (more about this in my Quad Candle System thread). The market will drive price wherever it wishes so ultimately as smart traders we need to only allocate a small risk of the account in zones that we view as opportunistic ... if we get it wrong no major harm done to the trading account. Yes I have this MML dash as well. I have not introduced it here since the key idea initially with the MTTTM Strategy was to trade it almost mechanically. As the involvement increases then informative dashes can be implemented ... all good. Masterrmind.............

Provided your trading account remains sufficiently funded it is only reasonable to make judgments after a longer term period. It is ok to make rolling comments as results unfold but not to lose sight of the bigger picture. The MM of the MTTTM Strategy is extremely robust over plenty of data periods if you were to make an analysis. Although its not preferable there are usually a few (or many) early losses at the start of a new TS Order cycle afterall price has further to travel to the TP than the SL. One of the reasons why I have mentioned the win loss table. The win loss table offers some comfort to the trader because it shows that only a minimal number of winning trades is needed to be ent positive. So its almost a feeling of euphoria when the first winning trade is recorded because it carries such a powerful weighting that is it can erase 3 losers immediately and pump up the account equity by a full 1%. It would be nice to achieve 1 to 3 winners in the early stages of the setup. And there is a way of improving a traders chances that this occurs. Simply trade higher time frames such as H1, H4 and D1 since the stops are typically wider offering a greater opportunity to ride through the small annoying PA's that go against your trade(s). The MML Grid settings can be altered on an M15 Chart to produce much larger Octave Gaps. But I'm starting the MTTTM Strategy with a generally good fit for most currency pairs on an M15 TF that typically yields good results. Masterrmind.............

Great post ! There are several parameters that a trader can investigate. Some of them are as follows: 1. The reward to risk ratio; For the MTTTM Strategy this ratio will be fixed at 4 to 1 and I see no point in changing it. 2. Choice of SL distance; The SL distance can certainly be played with since increasing it reduces the chances that the market will take you out thereby buying time. Altering SL distance achieved by settings that increase Ocatve Gap of the MML Grid Applying MML Grid to a much higher time frame with appropriate settings 3. Choice of TP distance; The TP is heavily governed by the SL and simply 4 times the distance in pips, so the focus is on the SL Although chart structure could be considered for projected TPs especially for very large TPs 4. Choice of Triangulated Order makeup; Multiple combinations in terms of pairs, TS Order (#'s) and individual TS direction Huge array of choices but getting the direction correct from the entry point could be made more difficult as the SL pips decrease 5. ADR relationship to the R:r and SL/TP; How likely is the TP to be hit within a daily time period if preferred exit from the market is same day If the TP is not hit the same day and trade runs over night consider lower volatility impact on trades progress for example when a trade opens in London session but remains active after NY close heading into a lower ranging Asian session. 6. Trading start time (random, at major opens, X_Hours before or after Major Open TO,LO,NY start time etc); and 7. Cycle turnover rate Plenty to consider but at the end of the day its a matter of keeping the method as simple as it can be and only modifying those parameters that are seen to have the biggest impact. Biggest impacting parameters in my view are: (i) the applied stops, (ii) R:r; (iii) TS Order makeup Masterrmind............

Going well. Great to hear the feedback and the update. Masterrmind.............

About fixed ratio its normal you dont see any point to change it because you developed this MM with a strategy using fixed distance levels. But im thinking how abstract MM rules for it can be used as generic in any strategy. As many strategies not uses fixed levels then the trick is what entry/exit rules will have a TS. Im not talking about entry/exits in pairs ( that is irrelevant for MM area). Im taking about how first pair entry or exit affects rest of TS pairs because the critic moment is when TS is unbalanced. I think easy rules works better in average then I think put a time limit for create a full TS can be enough because its very difficult can get perfect entries in all pairs in that group. Exits have their own history and needs much brainstorm work...

I always sit up and take notice when you start a thread Masterrmind, TS 3 order closed out for the week, 5 losers and 4 winners,last winner closed early +9% gain over all, thank you Masterrmind !

Yes a little bit biased but I know it works at 4 to 1 so no point fixing what certainly isn't broken. I'm only concerned about its application in the MTTTM Strategy. Once the discussion has been opened up traders will see how it caters for multiple setups all the way from trading only 3 pairs at a time up to many. Then it goes much further and will outline different TFs. The idea here is to offer traders a basic guide that works and then expand into advanced methods for those willing to explore deeper options. Its great to see the discussion and I welcome it. Masterrmind............

Update about current situation on the TS Order 3-S5 The NZDJPY long trade is the last one in progress and currently 3 pips in DD after being active for about a day and a half. It will be closed out very soon but would be nice to close it out for a small gain but time will tell. ps. AUDNZD pending order has just been deleted. Masterrmind...........

Not the most inspiring TS Order 3 for the second setup taken and very reluctantly traded on my part. But the account still shows a positive gain of over 8% even after so many losers but gave back about 3%.

Some additional observations about account progress Trade Report (via TE analytics) Attached Image (click to enlarge) After 2 TS Order 3's the strike rate is only 37.5% with TS Order 3-S5 producing the most losses. Profit Factor is 1.77 Yet the return is very healthy at 8% after only 10 days of trading with very acceptable DD. Trade Outcomes (via TE analytics) Attached Image (click to enlarge) This chart is very useful because it shows how well the account is or is not being managed in terms of individual trade control. Based on the fixed 4 to 1 Reward to risk ratio and an assigned risk per trade of 1% this means that an untouched completed trade will produce either a 1% loss or a 4% gain to the account. TS Order 3-S1 Trades 7 and 8 were closed out manually prior to completion and given enough movement in price its possible to see how these trades outcomes might have changed if simply allowed to run their course. Trade 7 Outcome (if allowed to run its course) AUDCAD Attached Image (click to enlarge) This trade was closed out for about a 0.9% gain If allowed to run its course the result would have been a -1% loss. Trade 8 Outcome (if allowed to run its course) GBPCAD Attached Image (click to enlarge) This trade was closed out for about a 1% gain If allowed to run its course the result would have been a -1% loss. TS Order 3-S5 Trade 16 Outcome (if allowed to run its course) NZDJPY Attached Image (click to enlarge) Risk Control I have assigned a risk per trade of 1%. This suggests that every losing trade should be not more than 1%. In the 2nd TS Order 3-S5 there were 2 trades that breached this risk level. Trade 12 GBPAUD Attached Image (click to enlarge) The loss recorded on this trade was -1.3% so so extra care needs to be taken moving forward to ensure that risk is not greater than 1%. Ofcourse due to negative slippage on exit its difficult to manage this sitaution perfectly but certainly the 1.3% figure is a little excessive here. A few other trades recorded -1.1% losses which might be borderline acceptable but the emphasis must be on minimizing loss. Moving forward I may adopt a technique that simply reduces the lot size applied per trade ever so slightly to keep under the assigned risk per trade. A minor breach here and there of the assigned risk% per trade may not be critical but an accumulating effect could be devastating. Masterrmind............

A Chart showing the win loss progress of each trade per TS Order 3 Attached Image (click to enlarge) TS Order 3-S1 and TS Order 3-S5 are shown and as each successive TS Order 3 set is completed the chart will be updated. This allows fast comparisons and observations between different TS Sets. The pairs are color coded per trade outcome as follows: Green = Full TP Light Green = partial TP Pink = Full SL Light Pink = partial SL Gray = Pair was not traded Note 1: Each TS set shows only 8 trades and this is due to each set having 1 pending order that failed to trigger. Note 2: The symbols font color represents the direction into the market ( blue =long; red =short). Note 3: The 2 charts showing losses and wins for trades does not refer to the ordering of pairs (refer to TE or myfxbook). Masterrmind............

Getting primed for the next stage in the MTTTM Strategy So far a very basic approach has been outlined in the MTTTM Strategy. We learnt that: (a) the same base currencies with different counter (quote) currencies can be used to form TS's (b) the same counter (quote) currencies with different base currencies can be used to form TS's (c) TS Orders are odd numbered such as 1,3,5,7,9,11,13 etc (d) a TS Order 1 applies 3 pairs in a triangulated format (random, hedged or other) (e) a TS Order 3 applies 9 pairs in a triangulated format (random, hedged or other) (f) higher Order TS's are simply mulitiples of 3 to gain pair count (Order 5 = 5*3 = 15 pairs, Order 7=7*3=21 pairs, Order 9=27 pairs etc) (g) smaller funded accounts should consider trading only smaller Order TS setups due to margin requirements and minimal lots available (h) larger accounts have greater flexibility and may trade any Order TS to a point (i) Masterrmind Choice is TS Order 3 and TS Order 9 (TS Order 3(^2)) (j) the higher the TS Order the greater becomes the requirement to apply an Expert Advisor to assist in managing the multiple trades in the setup Using the pairs AUDNZD and AUDJPY we could form NZDJPY Using the pairs EURUSD and GBPUSD we could form EURGBP Using the pairs AUDCAD and GBPCAD we could form GBPAUD Effectively we start with 1 sets of pairs (2 pairs) to make a total of 3 pairs in a TS Order 1 Effectively we start with 3 sets of pairs (6 pairs) to make a total of 9 pairs in a TS Order 3 Effectively we start with 5 sets of pairs (10 pairs) to make a total of 15 pairs in a TS Order 5 Effectively we start with 7 sets of pairs (14 pairs) to make a total of 21 pairs in a TS Order 7 Effectively we start with 9 sets of pairs (18 pairs) to make a total of 27 pairs in a TS Order 9 Note: It is unlikely that very high Orders of TS's (such as greater than Order 9) would ever need to be traded no matter the account balance. Note: Plenty of options are available even in a TS Order 3 including what pairs make up a TS, choice of direction and combinations. Note: Both TS's traded as examples were based on keeping left hand side same direction and right hand side opposite but this can also be changed. For example, In TS Order 3 Scenario 1 I traded: Scenario 1 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD TS1 Left hand side = AUDNZD + AUDJPY Right hand side = NZDJPY TS2 and TS3 follow a similar logic Then in TS Order 3 Scenario 5 (other trader dictated choice from 8 possibles) I traded: Scenario 5 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD TS1 Left hand side = AUDNZD + AUDJPY Right hand side = NZDJPY TS2 and TS3 follow a similar logic So I fixed the direction as follows: If 1 pair on the left was long ( AUDNZD ) then the second pair had to be long ( AUDJPY ) and pair 3 had to be short ( NZDJPY ). If 1 pair on the left was short ( AUDNZD ) then the second pair had to be short ( AUDJPY ) and pair 3 had to be long ( NZDJPY ). In the next Level of the MTTTM Strategy I will look at changing the pair direction so that on the same side the direction may or may not be the same. We use the notation TS to represent a single triangulated set which contains only 3 pairs, TS1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD Triangulated Set Order 3 Scenarios (combinations) Scenario 1 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD Scenario 2 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD Scenario 3 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD Scenario 4 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD Scenario 5 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD Scenario 6 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD Scenario 7 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD Scenario 8 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD Changing the directions of pairs on the same side of the TS pair equation can be shown as follows: (i) TS1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY (ii) TS1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY (iii) TS1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY (iv) TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP (v) TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP (vi) TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP (vii) TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD (viii) TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD (ix) TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD Notice how I started with only 6 pairs and this generated 9 pairs in a TS Order 3 setup. Then by fixing a direction to one side of the TS equation and having the other side opposite this produced 8 combinations. Now imagine the combinations possible by changing out and adding in only combination (i) or (ii) or any number of the (i) through (ix). All of this is possible from a small 6 initial pairs. ps. next post will start exploring hedging in triangulated setups. Masterrmind...........

HEDGING IN MTTTM TRIANGULATED SETUPS Hedging in the FX Retail Market can apply several types of strategies and have a host of slightly different meanings. I am open to healthy discussion in this area so that other traders can outline their own views however only provided that they do not attempt to force their own thinking on other participants of this thread. This is because I have a well planned out strategy to hedge in the MTTTM Trading Strategy based on the guidelines in Post 1. Currency pair hedging: The basic definition of single pair hedging is to open 2 trades on the same pair at about the same time in opposite directions. MTTTM hedging: Triangulated pair hedging in MTTTM may be full or partial and may or may not link between different TS's on the same TS Order setup. The hedging may or may not include the addition of lot multiplying factors to certain pairs in a TS that serve to flatten or offset risk. Although unlikely that single pair hedging will occur it is possible under certain conditions. Hedging may occur between a triangulated set of pairs which may link to other triangulated pairs (eg TS1 and/or TS2 and/or TS3). The degree and extent to which hedging may be applied can therefore vary in the MTTTM Strategy. Positive Correlation Tables (source: myfxbook) There are many sources of data on positive or other types of correlation in currency pairs. In house analysis systems are applied very commonly however, myfxbook is a sufficient source to use in this MTTTM strategy. TS Order 3 TS1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY (or any other ordering of these 3 pairs) TS2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP (or any other ordering of these 3 pairs) TS3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD (or any other ordering of these 3 pairs) Each TS will however only ever contain the same 3 pairs such as: TS1 will always contain the pairs AUDNZD, AUDJPY and NZDJPY TS2 will always contain the pairs EURUSD, GBPUSD and EURGBP TS3 will always contain the pairs AUDCAD, GBPCAD and GBPAUD Note that this is relevant for the testing phase only and when live trading or other future test examples are used they may vary. If the TS Order 3 is going to comprise a different makeup of pairs then it will be clearly outlined in advance.

Applying the correlation to TS Order 3 for D1, W1 and MN TS Order 3 (9 pairs) TS1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD Choosing the pair sequence based on positive correlation for each TS individually we have: TS1 = AUDNZD, AUDJPY, NZDJPY D1: AN correlated to AJ = +37.8% D1: AN correlated to NJ = -19.8% D1: AJ correlated to NJ = +83.2% W1: AN correlated to AJ = +29.9% W1: AN correlated to NJ = -57.8% W1: AJ correlated to NJ = +60.6% MN: AN correlated to AJ = +32.4% MN: AN correlated to NJ = -8.4% MN: AJ correlated to NJ = +91.5% TS2 = EURUSD, GBPUSD, EURGBP D1: EU correlated to GU = +67.8% D1: EU correlated to EG = +25.8% D1: GU correlated to EG = -53.5% W1: EU correlated to GU = +89.0% W1: EU correlated to EG = +83.3% W1: GU correlated to EG = +48.9% MN: EU correlated to GU = +74.1% MN: EU correlated to EG = +17.7% MN: GU correlated to EG = -52.9% TS3 = AUDCAD, GBPCAD, GBPAUD D1: AC correlated to GC = -23.3% D1: AC correlated to GA = -63.7% D1: GC correlated to GA = +89.8% W1: AC correlated to GC = +21.5% W1: AC correlated to GA = -40.9% W1: GC correlated to GA = +80.3% MN: AC correlated to GC = -43.4% MN: AC correlated to GA = -67.3% MN: GC correlated to GA = +95.8% Next is how to interpret the data. Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Now lets take a step further and examine the data on each TS one by one. What we may want to do is group the highest correlated pairs against the weakest pair. Note that there are other ways to group the pairs. TS1 = AUDNZD, AUDJPY, NZDJPY D1: AN correlated to AJ = +37.8% D1: AN correlated to NJ = -19.8% D1: AJ correlated to NJ = +83.2% W1: AN correlated to AJ = +29.9% W1: AN correlated to NJ = -57.8% W1: AJ correlated to NJ = +60.6% MN: AN correlated to AJ = +32.4% MN: AN correlated to NJ = -8.4% MN: AJ correlated to NJ = +91.5% According to the data from myfxbook the following is reasonably clear: AUDNZD and AUDJPY are positively correlated across D1, W1 and MN but not very high. AUDNZD and NZDJPY are negatively correlated across D1, W1 and MN but relatively small except for W1. AUDJPY and NZDJPY are positively correlated across D1, W1 and MN and very strongly. Strongest positive correlation for TS1 is between AUDJPY and NZDJPY Next strongest positive correlation for TS1 is between AUDNZD and AUDJPY Weakest correlation for TS1 is between AUDNZD and NZDJPY Pair Ordering Criteria: For the purposes of this exercise the pair ordering will group the highest positvely correlated pairs against the weakest pair' Pair Order is therefore, AUDJPY + NZDJPY = AUDNZD Or is it ? ps. TS2 and TS3 same procedure and then we need to set the direction of each pair. Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #186 ---
EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP GBPCAD + GBPAUD = AUDCAD is that correct?

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Correct ! I will post TS2 and TS3 later. Next task is to assign direction for each pair of each TS. Have a go at choosing the direction if you wish. Masterrmind.......

--- 帖子 #188 ---
I'm not sure where youre going with correlation. I'm guessing one would want to trade most correlated 2 pairs one long, one short and 3rd (least correlated) does not matter much. That way it's good probability to get at least 1 winner and still decent probability to get 2 wins from 1 set.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Myfxbook not explain what formula is using then I will think is using a simpler pips movement in that range. If 2 pairs move 100 pips in same direction will be 100%. First problem is you need normalize pairs movement taking their volatility because every pair have different speed when moves. Second problem is you will need every pair start movement in exact octave for that movement finish in next level. But as is implemented your strategy this is impossible because: First you cant have 100% correlation always Second your strategy cant guarantee perfect level sync between pairs in one TS Then finally question is what do you want and what you will get really. You have a theoric performance in a TS from -X% to X% if a TS is executed perfectly. As you can't get that you are getting a worst theoric performance. If we think all combinations you exposed in older posts as levels and first level profitable as the pivot you are suffering a shift of your pivot. As your pivot have a positive displacement ( you have more levels profitables than losers) statistically a non compliment of your theoric combinations will make that pivot move negatively making some weak profitable levels in losers. I don't want put examples for dont do this so long. The conclusion is simpler. You have 2 pieces in your system. MM and strategy ( octave levels). First is a scale of strategy risk taking a external reference ( correlation pairs) and second is who apply better or worst that scale depending execution precision. Then change pairs in TS have very litle effect in global performance comparing with strategy changes. Then you have focus how strategy try accomplish the MM requeriments. Try sort pairs in a group using correlation not solve your problem or guarantee you will improve. You can get a small impact % using this approach because you havent way to control strategy execution

Following on from the same logic as TS1 we can arrive at a pair ordering for TS2 and TS3 as follows: TS2 = EURUSD, GBPUSD, EURGBP D1: EU correlated to GU = +67.8% D1: EU correlated to EG = +25.8% D1: GU correlated to EG = -53.5% W1: EU correlated to GU = +89.0% W1: EU correlated to EG = +83.3% W1: GU correlated to EG = +48.9% MN: EU correlated to GU = +74.1% MN: EU correlated to EG = +17.7% MN: GU correlated to EG = -52.9% The pairs EU and GU are highly positively correlated over D1, W1 and MN. The pair EG is more correlated to EU than GU. Pair Ordering is EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS3 = AUDCAD, GBPCAD, GBPAUD D1: AC correlated to GC = -23.3% D1: AC correlated to GA = -63.7% D1: GC correlated to GA = +89.8% W1: AC correlated to GC = +21.5% W1: AC correlated to GA = -40.9% W1: GC correlated to GA = +80.3% MN: AC correlated to GC = -43.4% MN: AC correlated to GA = -67.3% MN: GC correlated to GA = +95.8% The pairs GC and GA are highly positively correlated over D1, W1 and MN. The pair AC is least correlated to GA. Pair Ordering is GBPAUD + GBPCAD = AUDCAD Masterrmind..............

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Since a criteria has been set for the ordering of the pairs in the TS's we now have a far less randomly determined approach. TS Order 3 (positive correlation versus least correlated) TS1 = AUDJPY + NZDJPY = AUDNZD TS2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS3 = GBPAUD + GBPCAD = AUDCAD Direction now has to be decided. How might a trader go about making such a decision ? Masterrmind.............

--- 帖子 #192 ---
According to the correlation table (Im only considering D1) (i) TS1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY is the way to go because Audjpy and nzdjpy are positively correlated and Nzdjpy and Audnzd are negatively correlated. TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP EurGbp and GbpUsd are negatively correlated but EU and GU are positively correlated.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Masterrmind, is there any indi or template.... which is supporting what to decide when?

--- 帖子 #194 ---
You mentioned trading 1 positively correlated pair long and the other short and doesn't matter much about the 3rd pair. (are you sure ??) Masterrmind...........

--- 帖子 #195 ---
If we trade correlated pairs to same direction, it means we are concetrating risk, not spreading it, might as well trade one pair with more lots. But maybe I dont understand.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
I never take 1 data source as the real deal until I've checked them several other sources. The correlation tables used in myfxbook are good enough for use in this strategy. If you have the time you can simply import reliable data into Excel and do the corrlations yourself. I've done this as a simple check for several different periods on multiple pairs. I'm not looking to have 100% correlation. Correlation actually changes over time, more so over shorter time periods than longer. What I'm after is a general behavior for the time frame of interest on the set of pairs I'm planning to trade. Your mention of volatility however, is what I've been waiting to hear because this needs to be considered. Some lot multiplier can be used on slower moving pairs can it not ? What about the distribution of assumed risk within a given TS across the 3 pairs ? If risk per TS is max 3% assuming 1% risk per trade, then how about applying proportionately more risk to the 'slower' moving pair. The next hurdle potentially is the size of the octave gap as in the applied SL. I'm sure that a higher TF with wider stops applying some of these techniques and the same risk profile will work splendidly. I'll certainly be trading several such examples come early January. ps. thanks for your comments. Masterrmind.............

There is a zip folder containing a slightly updated version with the Pip_Value indicator and a Lot size indicator and the template. For whatever reason I keep getting an error when I try to upload them ina zip folder, never happened before. Anyway I will try to get to the bottom of this issue over the enxt few days and upload it. Note that the indicators are informative only, not decision or trade makers, the trader needs to do that work. Keep a watch on Post 1. ps. I am looking into having the 2 indicators I mentioned above joined to form only the 1. Masterrmind..............

Concentrating risk is not what we want to do, if anything we would want to spread it around between other pairs. Have a go at trying to hedge the 3 TS's and see what directions per pair you come up with. Masterrmind..............

--- 帖子 #199 ---
the pairs involved are triangulated thats the edge. if you spread risk it means you are going for perfect hedging no edge there.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Edge, if there is any, is 4:1 rr with decent probability

--- 帖子 #191 ---
I think you didnt understand me You exposed an improvement using correlation for build a TS and I commented you 2 problems I see with this approach and the most probable no positive effect you expect. Im not doubting about if correlation data is good or not ( I only told as I dont know formula I take explained formula as reference ). I'm talking you cant use it without do some corrections because that "raw" correlation not take in consideration difference in pair movement ( ADR or volatility in a generic way ). When you create lot size you use pip value for compensate the difference in pairs values. With correlation is same but you have "normalize" ADR value in those pairs. You cant change lot size for normalize that volatility in pairs as you use for create octaves For me correlation in TS selection can be useful for decide what direction will have every pair in that TS ( removing left hand &amp; right hand rule ) and avoiding force a bad trade by fixed original rule but I dont think will have big effect in results for exposed in above post...

--- 帖子 #192 ---
thats why i only trade mml extreme levels with 4:1 rr and so far its good. i dont use ts. but i have not ruled out using ts. p.s. if there is no edge in using ts than why bother? you can just use 4:1 rr as your edge and use any type of entry method.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
tnks for the input, can you share the template?

--- 帖子 #194 ---
if you used 1% as your risk you could achieve more than 4:1 rr with those entries on your chart and your losers will be less than 1%.

Traders ..... This thread is primarily about the MTTTM Strategy. Any discussion that seeks to enhance and inprove the method is most welcome. For those traders wishing to jump from one trading strategy to the next in a blink of an eye please do this silently without disrupting this thread. I've invested plenty of time in this strategy and clearly not all the bells and whistles have been shown. Once I start trading this method on a live account you will see the strategy in action since real $$'s will be at risk. My trading is typically very transparent showing before, during and after the fact commentary with multiple examples. If you find no value in this approach then I suggest you kindly move along. It is the traders choice afterall ! Good trading, Masterrmind.............

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Basically, I'm examining 3 parameters (others may be added later or by other traders if they wish): 1. pair choice in a given TS over Order 3 setup; 2. effect of a lot size multiplier and 3. any benefit related to changes in the applied SL. Correlation and/or Hedging are simply 2 approaches that can be used to determine: (i) selection of pairs to be used in a given TS (eg TS1, TS2 and TS3 etc); (ii) ordering of pairs within a given TS; (iii) direction of pairs within a TS; (iv) TS risk management to an extent Tweaks here and there can be applied to the strategy but what really matters ultimately is avoiding a premature stop out instead gaining a TP. Just 1 less SL in a given TS cycle of trades has a huge effect on the account equity gain. Recall that the difference between 1 SL being avoided by producing a TP is a 5% difference on average. The main idea here should be to analyze each parameter in turn to some extent and then adopt it or reject it. The ultimate success or failure of the MTTTM Strategy is determined by the longer term average TS Order(#) strike rate. Thinking ahead into the future about when I plan to outline the higher time frame MTTTM setups the larger stops will likely provide an opportunity to remain in the trade longer however at the expense of price having to move much further to hit TP at a fixed reward to risk ratio. Once all is said and done it will be the task of the trader to select the TS Order pair makeup, pair ordering and pair direction and to maintain a strict risk control approach. Good trading, Masterrmind...........

Hi MM, Just finished reading all the pages in the thread. Will now read again. I have used in the past MM lines on a 15m chart with 3Level ZZ Semafor indi to time the entry. I will need to spend some time just looking at the charts with just the MM lines to help with direction of pairs. Looking forward to getting a better understanding on my second read. Congratulations on your great contribution. Regards Rod

Nice to see you around here Eldero. I'll be uploading plenty more material over the coming days and weeks related to the MTTTM Strategy some of which will be available in Post 1. Some specific to the method and some analytical type information useful in forming opinions and expectations about trading performance will also be included especially the use of Excel (I'll try to keep it at a basic level).

Hi Masterrmaind, I have read your thread, but I dont understand where the profit came from(maybe because of my bad English). If you open a hedged positin, the profit is only the arbitrage. When one of the position is not lot "equal" calculated, is not whort to open all of 3 positions. If you use stop loss, when one of the position is closed, the neutrality is over. Please clarify me. Thank you. And if you wannt to see the corelation, I suggest the CCFp indicator, it is based on MA, but if you set on low value it can represent a good picture, but nothing can predict the future, even the price.

The spaghetti indicator has been around for a very long time and yes its just based on MAs. Not much use in the MTTTM Strategy I'm afraid to say. An alert trader would realize that the TS Order # may not be seeking a 'perfect' hedge ! A hedge can be useful in reducing risk, offsetting some of the DD as trading unfolds. Or a TS can be designed to reduce some of the assumed risk prior to a planned entry. As the complexity of the TS Order increases so too the need to eventually make use of an Expert Advisor. In dynamic mode imagine trying to manually adjust and hedge the pairs in a TS Order 5,7,9 or 11. However, the system uses a fixed risk% per trade over a fixed reward to risk ratio ! So would we actually be seeking a fully hedged setup ? We need to take on risk for the opportunity to make a profit. Does it matter what choice of TS we design and the pairs used in each TS1,2,3 ? The future outcome ofcourse is not known in advance but a smart trader can make use of pair correlation and the TS Order # design if they wish. Due to the forced reward to risk ratio the system would benefit greatly by only 1/3 winners per TS1,2,3 for a total of 3 winning trades in a TS Order 3 but this is not needed to be profitable indeed all we need is a minimum of 2 winners from anywhere within a TS Order 3. TS1 and TS2 could produce 6 losing trades and no winners. TS3 could then produce 1 losing trade and 2 winners. 2/9 winners gets the account into positive territory. So a trader needs to do some of his/her own analysis and see if a purely 'random' type TS Order 3 is any less profitable over the longer term than a trader designed TS Order 3 (using correlation and triangulated pairings etc etc). This can be discussed in the thread ofcourse. However, I will continue to trade the remainder of the Scenarios that make up the TS Order 3 (as per the demo account) and then discuss the results both at the end of each TS cycle and after all scenarios have been traded. 2 scenarios (combinations) have already been traded and completed so there are 6 more remaining. The final 6 will be traded (1 at a time) from about mid January (approx) or when the market starts to show some renewed volatility. After these 8 scenarios have been completed then I'll trade my own TS design on a live trading account and again full transparency. Remember that a trader can apply this method in its most basic form or they are free to tweak and design the TS setup as much as they like. ps. I would not use moving averages or a currency meter in this strategy as it is not required. Masterrmind............

2018 So when do we start trading ? A trader could consider the unfolding Daily Ranges (DR's) and compare them to the historical ADRs or look over a previous set of active trading months. The TS Order 3 currently being traded on the demo account includes the pair AUDNZD. AUDNZD daily ranges over the previous few months are as follows: Attached Image (click to enlarge) AUDNZD monthly ranges as follows: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Other pairs of interest can also be analysed in a similar way. Volatility Table (myfxbook) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Comparisons are important! What we are looking for or rather waiting for is a return to 'normal' market volatility that is likely to suit our trading strategy. High spread values can also mean that a little more patience might be the 'better' option. At this stage it is a waiting game however, I'm expecting to fire off the next Scenario either Monday January 8 or Monday January 15. Masterrmind.............

I will be trading the next Scenario in the TS Order 3 setup tomorrow. Keep a watch on the thread as this setup may be traded at any time. Remember I have traded only 2 Scenarios of the TS Order 3 and there are 8 in total so I have 5 more to complete after this next one finishes. Triangulated Set Order 3 Scenarios (combinations) Scenario 1 (traded) TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD Scenario 2 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD Scenario 3 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD Scenario 4 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD Scenario 5 (traded) TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD Scenario 6 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD Scenario 7 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD Scenario 8 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD Masterrmind...........

TS Order 3 (M15 TF) Please refer to Post #222 for the Scenario numbering sequence. Completed Scenarios so far are Scenario 1 and Scenario 5. Third TS cycle to be traded will be as follows: Scenario 2 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD Basic steps: 1. Open all the pairs in MT4 on an M15 TF Chart; 2. Apply the M15 template to all pairs to be traded in the TS Order setup (TS Order 1,3,5,7 etc); 3. Make sure the MML Settings (top left of screen) show P=64, MMP=60 and StepBack=0 (if not modify them); 4. Open up the settings of the Lot_Size-MTTTM indicator and enter the Octave Gap as shown in the MML settings; 5. Enter your choice of values for the Variables "Multiplier (of the Octave Gap)" and "RiskPerTrade (%)"; Attached Image (click to enlarge) 6. Change the settings of the other Variables as per your liking then click 'Ok' and then 'close' the indicators window; 7. Double check the printed information at top center of chart for SL, multiplier, %Risk, Lots and $ to ensure it is correct; Attached Image (click to enlarge) 8. Now repeat Steps 1 though 7 for all other pairs or instruments to be traded. The Lot_Size-MTTTM indicator has an expiry date at the end of this month (if thread participation is ok the expiry will be extended). A template or indicator refresh will cause an alert window to pop up, simply close it to remove the alert (alerts will occur for all charts). Masterrmind............

If your planned setup gives the following warning message: "Lot Size less than Broker allowed .... CHECK YOUR SETTINGS!" Attached Image (click to enlarge) Then you need to re-check your settings (OctaveGap, Multiplier (of the Ocatve Gap) and RiskPerTrade (%) ). The RiskPerTrade (%) = 0.01 creates the warning since the broker does not offer a small enough lot size (min is 0.01 lots) to meet the conditions. The required lot size that does meet the conditions in the indicator settings is clearly less than 0.01 lots. Never rely on indicators, always do a quick check yourself to make sure it all makes sense and that no errors are present. Indicator is a simple tool, the trader needs to make the final call! ps. if you find bugs in the indicator let me know and I'll fix them as soon as I have the free time. Masterrmind............

Scenario 2 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD Now go through and mark on each chart either SHORT or LONG. AUDNZD Attached Image (click to enlarge) AUDJPY Attached Image (click to enlarge) NZDJPY Attached Image (click to enlarge) Similarly for all the other trades in the setup. This is so that you do not inadvertently enter a pair in a direction opposite to your plan. Other methods can be applied at your own discretion. Masterrmind..........

All 9 entries will be made as @market or pending orders (in the case where price is not close to an MML line or other reason such as criteria not met). For this TS Order 3 the planned entry time will be within 1 hour of London Open. The next post will show the entries in the trading terminal. Before entries are made into the market make sure you re-check all the octave gaps of all the planned trades in case they have changed. I have just changed 3 octave gaps in the Lot_Size-MTTTM indicator settings because the octaves have been reset. Once trades have been entered let them run, and if the octaves change after entry time then do not be concerned ... let trades run. Masterrmind...........

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Here are the 9 entries for TS Order 3 (S-2) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Check for any mistakes such as incorrect lot sizes applied, incorrect entry direction etc and fix it. Check that all trades have hard stops applied and TPs are set at 4 to 1. Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Pending orders can be Buy or Sell stops or limit orders. The EURGBP entry is a good example showing a Sell Limit order. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Notice how a 4 to 1 would have exceeded the lower extreme MML level at -2/8 MML. So the correct entry in this case is to place a Sell Limit at the next octave up the chart so that TP coincides with -2/8 MML. In this method we trade within the confines (boundaries) of the MML Grid and not outside it! Masterrmind...........

6 losses in a row so far! 3 trades to go, 1 running and 2 pending. Analysis should be used to find repeating reasons for losses (study the losers very closely and look for repeating events).

Chart does not show a perfect Sinewave - but illustrates the idea in this case Price Action follows more or less a Sinewave this explains and shows visually why SRL (Support and Resistance Line) (4/8) properties are Major Support and Resistance / Center of Gravity (within the parameters) In the first part of the chart you can find better to have an halved scaling where the present (6/8) SRL in red has also the property of being the new (4/8) SRL Center of Gravity within the halved parameters That is the Sinewave which explains the Halving / Doubling of parameters methodology As soon as you have determined the "correct" Octave (which fits to you) you just have to halve or double to stay tuned with the Price Action When you are at the beginning of a new halved or doubled Octave my recommendation is to use both charts, the previous one and the new one because you are in a phase of transition

Exactly...the octaves have plenty to do with it. Next step is to decide ... 1. How many smaller octave setups fail ? Is it a problem or is it just a small percentage that fail? 2. Is there any relationship between the failing trades having a similar octave gap? 3. So a small octave means what in terms of potential trade outcome ? 4. Is there any advantage to be gained by only trading octaves over a certain distance? 5. Does the trade entry timing play a role ? Notice how I said well in advance that I was going to start the cycle within 1 hour of London Open. (a) Was this a wise move do you think ? (b) What usually happens in the Frankfurt session on a very regular basis ? (c) a small octave means a small stop if 1 to 1 is applied so it means higher chance of the trade getting whipped out of the market for a loss. The market moves at different rates most of the time in different sessions. Then there is the over lap in sessions to consider such as Asian-London and London-NY cross-over. How best to minimize the chances of losing trades. Recall that all a trader needs to do in this system is to win 2 out of 9 trades provided the 2 hit a 4 to 1 TP. Certainly in this method we seek a minimum of 2 full TP winners from 9 (in a TS Order 3 having 9 trades) but surely we want more winners. The idea here is then, not to make the perfect entry and obtain a 100% strike rate. Rather to be seeking out ways to put the odds on our side by at least getting rid of the known losing type setups. As these demo trades unfold please consider the rates of success between different speed pairs, octave gaps and their ADR's. The MTTTM Strategy might appear simple at first but there is plenty under the hood for those traders seeking potentially higher strike rates. It is my hope that by the time all of the scenarios have been traded (5 more to go) that certain repeating factors common among losing trades stands out as very obvious. The idea should be to learn from these demo setups before going live otherwise you won't have a clue. Good trading, Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #239 ---
a lot of good questions asked by Mastermind then a lot of research and of work ! one key factor to progress is to use post mortem analysis of trades where I have failed, why , what should I have done ?

--- 帖子 #240 ---
it is very traditional but not bad IMHO it gives you at least an idea of Speed and Acceleration of the Trend and you can follow the variations within the parameters used ( 8 or 12 Octaves Gap)

--- 帖子 #241 ---
The data has a lot to say but as in anything to do with success in trading the market it cannot tell you everything. The plan should be to make small positive improvements in the strike rate so instead of getting 2/9 for a 1% gain, you get 3/9 for a 6% gain. Small difference in winning trade count but massive in terms of gain in Equity. ps. its not really alot of research, its simply looking for the patterns of failure in the losing trades (yes there could be a heap to look at) and weeding out the common losing factor, if it is an obvious one.

Strike rate after 3 scenarios is 28% (won 7 out of 25 trades) but be careful drawing any firm conclusions since only 5 hit full TP . 5 out of 25 is 20% but we also have a few smaller winners that add to the overall gain. Recall the theoretical win rate for a 4 to 1 R:r is 20%. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Also consider the practical aspect when 9 trades are entered ... its not possible to achieve exactly 20% rather its 2/9 being 22.2%. 1 winner from 9 trades is 11.1% ... not good enough! ... = -4% 2 winners from 9 trades is 22.2% ... better than 20% (BE) so we are in the money! ... = +1% 3 winners from 9 trades is 33.3% ... even better! ... = +6% ... and so on The relationship between winners and losers is key (as always and not forgetting about strict MM). Minimizing losses is important to an extent but its not super critical although it has a significant impact on gain in Equity! Having a minimum number of winners from a given number of trades is critical. Is it possible to improve to 3/9 (33.3% strike rate) or 4/9 (44.4% strike rate) or 5/9 (55.5% strike rate) ? Based on the results so far one might argue that it looks unlikely ... but is it ?? Masterrmind...........

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Ok ... no worries at all. Its not the prettiest Equity curve but thats not the point here! Ability to survive numerous losing sequences and look for small ways to improve the strike rate. Small increase in the strike rate provides huge increase in Equity Gain and thats what we seek. In time little pieces of the puzzle will find their way onto this thread (if participation continues). Keep a look out for the small changes I make to the way the next 3 scenarios will be traded. Masterrmind.............

TS Order 1 trades opened in Friday trading (D1 64, TP = 1 Octave, SL = 0.25 Octave. A+B=C, with A and B at Octave and C hedge does not need to be near Octave). Opening balance $1540. 10% up after closing all open trades End of US session. TS order 3 a bit brain numbing but look forward to participating and testing. Challenge is how many of the 9 trades need to be near Octave as per MMM.

Hi Woze, Thanks for posting your results and a very nice gain for the day. This thread has only outlined M15 TF so far with higher TF setups to follow in the future so you are jumping ahead a bit. A few comments if I may: 1. Why close out so soon when using a D1 setup ? (end of week?, happy with %gain?, applying mini-octaves?, other reason ?) 2. Why such a huge difference in the applied lot size of the 3rd pair as shown in the screenshot ? Attached Image (click to enlarge) 3. It appears you traded 27 pairs (similar to a TS Order 9 but perhaps entered as individual TS's) 4. When did you enter the TS's ? (mid-late London or in the NY session or mixed) ? 5. If you could post a chart of your completed trades that would be great (I don't expect all trades to be posted though, a little overkill perhaps) The Plan for the MTTTM Strategy 1. Start off with trading demo examples of 8 scenarios of M15 TF TS Order 3 setups on an 'almost random ' type approach; [transparent trading approach before the fact, discuss trades, discuss ways to improve strike rate] 2. Trade (on demo ) a specially designed TS Order 3 on the M15 TF with several traded setups; [transparent trading approach before the fact, discuss trades, discuss ways to improve strike rate] 3. Trade (on demo ) higher time frame TS Order 3's (and higher TS Order examples) [transparent trading approach before the fact, discuss trades, discuss ways to improve strike rate] 4. Trade carefully designed TS Order 3's (and others) on a LIVE account . [transparent trading approach before the fact, discuss trades (before, during and after), discuss techniques that attempt to improve the strike rate] Traders are then free to choose which TF suits them and either continue to trade on a demo account (which I hate doing) or go live! The more traders that participate the better the journey. ps. I reserve the right to start trading MTTTM live at any time! Masterrmind.............

1. End of week &amp; applying mini-octaves. Used chart with fib levels such that P=64 and MMP=1440, these are long term stronger S/R zone, higher prob to reverse. Traded when price is at 7/8, 6/8, 8/8, +1/8. Then used M15 currency strength for A and B (A+B =C) with C being hedge 2. Miscal error on my part, noted 3. Multiple random TS order 1, to test strike rate vs probability, hence the response to your specific comment in strike rates 4. Mid Asia through to London close, when there is no nearby news 5. Sure, when I get to PC P.S. traded demo

Return by Trade in each of the 3 by TS Order 3 setups Attached Image (click to enlarge) A great place to improve from since strike rate has been reducing after each successive TS Order. Only place worse than current strike rate is 9/9 losers and we do not want this statistic do we ? Consider the details of the 25 completed trades in the 3 TS Orders such as: 1. Trade opening time into the market (relationship to the main session open times) 2. Was the stop too small ? (Would a larger stop have made any major difference) 3. If a specific MML level had of been chose for the entry point of each trade how might this have affected the outcome ? 4. What do you identify as being the main factor(s) for the losing trades ? 5. Other key considerations regarding improvements to the strike rate of a given TS Order 3. Masterrmind............

Thanks for the clarification. You also might like to make use of the Lot_Size-MTTTM indicator (if you are not already) to ensure all lots per pair are correct. The impact of closing trades out earlier than a full stop or full TP is a reduction in the expectancy of the strategy. However, trading must include a number of exceptions, one being a closure by the end of Friday to offset weekend gapping risk. The use of 'stronger' HTF support and resistance levels is a good approach and can be used as a form of confluence in M15 or generally lower time frame setups. A trader could therefore seek out setups from pairs that align and provide confluence between HTF S+R and MML levels. I will expand on this topic in the upcoming posts. Good trading, Masterrmind............

Some observations that can immediately be made from the analytics (over the 4 TS Order 3 setups traded so far) 1. vast majority of trades are losing trades (7 winning trades, 25 losing trades from a total of 32 entries so far); 2. results are progressively getting worse after each consecutive TS Order 3 setup; 3. strike rate is reducing (currently @ 21.9% according to TE trade statistics; so its nearing a critical minimum level); 4. average winning (+3.1%) and average losing trades (-1.0%) shows good risk control (4 to 1 R:r) noting that some TPs were less than full; 5. plus others So what is the bottom line and what can we do as an attempt in turning this account around ? [be sure to realize that there are no guarantees that any changes we make will necessarily lead to an increased gain in equity] Account is currently -4.2% below initial balance Starting Balance = US$10 000 Current Balance = US$9578.60 Since the account equity after previous TS Order closure is now below the starting balance there are a few key risk adjusments that can be made: Parameter Changes 1. Assigned Risk per Trade must now be reduced (instead of using 1% risk per trade, next TS Order 3 will be 0.8% per trade ); and 2. Stops are getting hit rather frequently suggesting they could be too tight, so lets widen SLs slightly and apply 1.5*Octave Gap . The performance of the 9 traded pairs can also be examined. Attached Image (click to enlarge) There are multiple criteria that could be set for the purposes of rejecting a given pair(s) or instrument(s) for example; (a) if Pair X performance &lt; -5% then do not trade this instrument; (b) if Pair X and Pair Y of the same triangulated set are consistently negative performers then reject the triangulated set (all 3 pairs); (c) re-design the TS Order # makeup Performance criteria will not be used at this early stage in the rejection of pairs or TS's but it will certainly be monitored over time. Objective now is to slowly alter some parameters (seen to be key) and analyze the trading results over several completed TS Orders. Changes will therefore be: 1. a reduction in the Risk per Trade (%); and 2. a widening of the applied stops. Note 1: With any strategy it is crucial that minor changes are made to a few parameters as necessary and the outcome analyzed (reject or accept). Note 2: The Reward to Risk ratio is very solid at 4 to 1 however, there is always a 'better' ratio in hindsight that matches a given period of data. Note 3: Unfortunately, we do not have the luxury of being able to trade using hindsight, we can only make a 'best fit' judgement call. Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Now update the parameters in the various indicators. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The template can then be saved and applied across all pairs being traded in the setup. Perform a quick check by calculating for example 0.8% of the current balance to ensure values match. Notice in the Info_Panel-MTTTM indicator that Max Risk% shows 7.2% (0.8% per entry * 9 entries = 7.2%). Notice how I have reduced the risk per trade to 0.8% from originally 1%. This 0.2% reduction is at trader discretion so use what you feel is the right amount (the new value though must be less than the previous). This is all about preserving the trading account so if the account equity is reducing then risk must be reduced not increased ! If the next TS Order 3 results in a return that leads to balance greater than or equal to 10 000 then risk per trade will again be set to 1%. If the next TS Order 3 is a losing setup then the following TS Order 3 will have 0.6% risk per trade assigned and so on. If all the values applied in the parameters are correct then the next TS Order 3 can be traded! Masterrmind...........

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Next TS Order 3 scenario will be the following: TS Order 3-S4 Scenario 5 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD To be traded very very soon! Masterrmind............

Post 1 has been updated with Version 2 of the Lot_Size indicator in its own section (not part of the zip folder at this stage). Updated versions of this indicator will be uploaded to Post 1 as required. Note 1: At some stage (yet to be determined) I will code all the older MT4 indicators into the newer MT5 version. Note 2: This may also include an MT5 Trade management expert specifically for the MTTTM trading strategy as its complexity increases. ps. Please note that the indicator is coded for common currency pairs only so be careful using it on other instruments (commodities, indices etc). pps. If the interest is there I may code the MT5 version to cover any traded instrument. Masterrmind...........

Hello Mastermind! I have been following this thread from the beginning and trading M TTT M with slight modifications since January 11. My modification is: I don't use necessarily triangulated pairs, I choose 9 or 10 pairs which are either at 8/8, +1/8, +2/8 or at 0/8, -1/8 or -2/8. Everything else in the middle is disregarded. Sometimes, I may use 7/8 or 1/8 but not on a regular basis. I hope that this may improve a strike rate and tip the scales in our favor. My account is up 20%. (I started with $5,000.- demo and now is 6,029.-). Of course, this may be a result of pure luck or temporary favorable market conditions. However, it looks promising. One thing is for sure, the period is too short to draw any conclusions. I hope that this is something to think about. This can be one of the ways to improve odds in our favor. I wonder what you (and others) think about it.

One of my other threads goes into great detail about trading off the extreme MML zones. Quad Candle System (which also applies the MML indicator off mostly the D1 TF) https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=668957 In the MTTTM method the choice to use triangulated pairs or not is up to the trader however, the focus of this method is applying TS's. As this thread unfolds the use of triangulated sets and their advantages will be outlined and the reason why they can be useful in offsetting risk. The current demo account is simply a testing tool being used to outline various TS configurations and to provide a reference point to the trades via a rolling commentary about risk control and the key trade management considerations. When I start trading a live account you will see the design of TS that I use and the TF of choice (it will be a TS Order 3 but maybe not M15 TF). Although its early days and certainly too soon to be drawing any solid conclusions your trading results are headed in the right direction. However, what maximum DD did you endure to achieve this return and how sustainable is it likely to be over the longer term ? Being prepared for and surviving a series of nasty negative trade outcomes is critical for longer term consistency. What I'm showing here is the importance of managing the setup dynamically and making any necessary adjustments to key parameters. Sometimes this takes time because a series of TS setups need to play out and be analyzed before changes can be considered. You've mentioned taking the trades from the extreme MMLs and I couldn't agree more. However, you have not mentioned anything about the pairs you traded or when you traded them. A posted chart with the trades shown would be very useful here. A simple idea is to seek out and trade pairs that are in the extreme MML zone and then take it a step further and match up as many TS's as possible within the confines of the chosen TS Order # be it 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 etc and trade these setups. I will get to this later in this thread. Putting the odds in our favor is only 1 part of the puzzle, being able to minimize losses, manage the trades for risk and make timely ongoing adjustments when needed are the key considerations. Thanks for sharing your results. Masterrmind.............

Hi Mastermind! Thanks for your reply and input. I didn't take any screenshots of the trades because I had no intention of posting them here (like I said, it's too early). I changed my mind later as I wanted to inform you of my modifications. However, here are two shots of my trading history on this account. You can see the pairs I traded from the beginning and volume. I can also post my trades in hindsight but it is pointless since MML resets very often and what appeared to be an extreme level then may be just a middle line now... I adjusted the size of my trades to 1% each, so my maximum risk was 9-10% on any given day. However, I never wait for completion of trades. I will close them before 23:00 (GMT+1) since the spread can go wild at that time... and I have to sleep (I live in Europe). Also, if SL is hit on say, 3 trades, I will wait for the rest to make their move. However, if nothing happens in the next few hours, I will cut my losses and kill the rest of the trades. Conversely, if my total gain is up say 10% or more, I will analyze each position and if some important S/R is in the vicinity or ADR is met, I will close all of them. In my experience, the price tends to move certain period of time (part of the Session, whole Session or even two Sessions), but after that it stops and just meanders around that level. After that, there is no point sticking around since nothing is going to happen. New Session can bring an opposite move. Considering all of this, I close my trades (what some may consider) somewhat prematurely. This limits my DD (but also potential profits). Still, this is my way... :-) Therefore, my maximum DD was 2-3 % per day, so far... - First day (last Friday), I had +15%... I ended all trades there (maybe I could have gained more, but I was satisfied with that). - Second day (Monday), as I remember, I was at breakeven. The price meandered up and down for hours and it was obvious that it was going nowhere... I was up 0.5-1.5%, then down 0.5-15% then up again... so I waited until I was in minimum plus and killed all trades. - The next day, few of my trades hit SL and the rest was going nowhere... around breakeven or small plus... so I killed them all (total loss 2.5% or so). - On Wednesday, also, few of my trades hit SL... at some point, the rest were in plus some 6% (so I could have ended that day with 3-4% plus) but... I was greedy and waited for more... then they started to come back and I closed all of them around breakeven. (total loss around 2.5%) - I didn't trade on Thursday (I was busy doing something else) - On Friday, two trades (out of 10) hit my SL but the rest of them gained some 14% so altogether I was in plus some 12%, so I killed all of them (maybe I could have gained more, but I was satisfied with that). As you may notice, I didn't put SL or TP on yesterday's trades. The only reason for that is because, I was in a hurry and I had to travel to another city. I was going to put SL and TP after I come back. (Since this is demo, I can afford to do that. I would never do that on live account.) However, when I came back, I was already significantly in profit, so soon after that, I closed all of the trades. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Thanks for spending the time to post such a long reply. Yes it is early days forsure but at least its showing positive progress. The trading analytics should then be reviewed as an ongoing process with the aim of minimizing any obvious losing factors in the strategy. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Hindsight trades can in fact be posted by using an Historical MML indicator which traces out the precise MML lines for a given number of settings back in history. If you upload a chart showing your completed trades then I can soon tell you at which MML lines those trades were taken over every trade. All that is rquired is the pair, TF and the MML settings applied at the time of trade entry. The trader can come up with his/her own trade management rules and therefore even if 2 traders trade identical pairs at an identical time the end results may be far different. No 2 traders are completely identical afterall, they think differently and trade differently and have different personalities and risk tolerance levels. It appears your plan for closing out trades is logical however longer term expectancy will be damaged due to a not so solid reward to risk ratio. This does not suggest that over the longer term that you won't be profitable, in fact you may very well be profitable. The impact over the longer term of a reducing level of expectancy in the case when the reward to risk ratio on average diminishes over time suggests that a series of losing trades will be far more detrimental to the account. However, the method is applied with an initial 4 to 1 Reward to Risk ratio so for every $100 risked you stand to gain a possible $400. At certain times throughout the trading week it might make perfect logical sense to close out several trades for example, prior to the weekend (to avoid a possible negative impact weekend gap), avoid high impact news, or other major events. A hard stop loss is critical (or it can be under certain unfavorable conditions) so must be applied ... at least you are aware of this error. The demo account should be traded as close as possible to how you would trade a live account so manage the risk the same (very tightly). Unless the purpose of the demo account is to highlight all the things that can go wrong from an educational point of view. Focus on the risk! If for example, $100 is the risk per trade and $400 the potential gain then closing out several trades at 4 to 1, 3 to 1, 2 to 1 or even 1 to 1 is no where as detrimental to the longer term positive expectancy of the trading account as it would be if trades were closed out for less than a 1 to 1 R:r. Less than a 1 to 1 Reward to Risk is where $100 is risked but the trade was closed out for less than $100 in profit such as $50. The situation becomes far worse when scalping type trades are taken UNLESS the win rate REMAINS very very high. A few very large consecutive losses can wipe out the multiple winning trades very quickly and then some. Ofcourse having a high Reward to Risk ratio does not guarantee success either. If every future outcome is a loser then the result is a toasted account. This is why I'm showing multiple examples starting with an M15 Chart and a 4 to 1 R:r so the good, the bad and the ugly are displayed and strategies and changes can be discussed so traders have an idea of how 'best' to manage an account in the times when positive progress may be at an all time low. 1. Keep the R:r constant initially. 2. After losing cycles reduce the risk per trade, but be sure to extend the SLs out using relatively smaller lot sizing ( 2 parameter approach ). 3. After a return to winning cycles (not single trades rather net positive gain over the entire TS Order setup) start increasing the risk again. 4. Monitor trade stop outs and if the stop outs have reduced and the larger stops appear to be providing a larger buffer then leave the wider stops. 5. Be aware that there is a limit to how large the stops can be and typically in MTTTM this is 2 Octave Gaps and not more (4 to 1 TP !?). 6. TS Order design (same each time, selective, random, partially hedged, box-hedged etc). 7. Consider higher TF MML Grid (HTF provides the same series of MML lines but typically much larger octaves, so by default stops are larger). Very good commentary, if only others could do the same .... Masterrmind............

Start of the week account situation is as follows: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Monitoring of the trades will be maintained with the general approach being to simply allow all trades time to play out. Some of the pending orders are far from being triggered but I will leave them all in place and re-visit the situation if current trades have or are about to close out. I may take a closer look at any noticable impact that the untriggered pending orders may be causing. It will simply be a case of comparing the difference between leaving pending orders or trading immediately at market and looking at outcomes. Ofcourse, this is only a small sample size so care needs to be taken when making any decision that changes the strategies approach. One obvious issue though is that for any pending order not triggered there is no offsetting of risk on a given TS. Another issue is that trades entered at market (instead of correctly setting entry, SL and TP within the MML Grid) may not satisfy MML confines. The way the trades are placed now in the case of the pending orders is such that any entry level used at an MML price line will also have the SL and the TP levels within the bounds of the MML Grid meaning no SL exceeds the +2/8 or -2/8 MML and no TP exceeds the +2/8 or -2/8 MML. In effect the individual trade setup lies within the upper and lower domains of the MML Grid. Whether or not this approach is the 'best' on average over the longer term is not easy to say at this stage. Masterrmind............

Trade Management (observation followed by implementation) To minimize losses it appears favorable to move stops to BE+pips after price has moved favorably a minimum of 2 (or 3) octaves. A few recent trades were quite close to hitting TP, only to reverse and continue all the way back to take out the SL. Ofcourse, this may have the effect of reducing total possible TPs but at this stage I think its worthwhile to reduce the losses even though they are only 4 times smaller than the current TPs (4 to 1 R:r). The next TS Order 3 traded may apply this new guideline. Masterrmind............

Summary of TS Order 3-S4 (the fifth setup) 7 trades opened 2 pending orders not triggered Attached Image (click to enlarge) Total setup risk was 7.2%. Only 7 trades from 9 triggered and accounting for timing of open trades the realized risk was much lower than the 7.2% figure. 3 winners @ 3.6%, 3.3% and 2.1%. 4 losers @ 0.8%, 0.8%, 0.8% and 0.8%. Net Cycle (Gain/Loss) = ( 3.6 + 3.3 + 2.1 )% - ( 0.8 + 0.8 + 0.8 + 0.8 )% = 9% - 3.2% = +5.8% (approx). This was a nice recovery from the drawdown and the account balance is again greater than the initial 10K currently @ 10 121.93. +1.22% gain on the account which is certainly far from impressive however, being a demo account it is the adjustments we make that are key. Additional analytics will be presented at month end. Masterrmind............

Quick Guide to setting up the next TS Order setup. 1. Open all pairs to be traded in the TS of your choice; 2. Apply the MTTTM template (Post 1) and make sure MML settings show P=64 and MMP=60 and StepBack=0; 3. Take note of the Octave Gap shown in the upper left corner in the MML Settings area; 4. Open up settings of the Lot_Size-MTTTM indicator and input the same Octave Gap value, then update all the other inputs as required; Attached Image (click to enlarge) 5. Open up settings in Info_Panel-MTTTM indicator and input Risk_Setting_Alert=9.0 (risk per trade*# of trades eg TS Order 3 is 1%*9 trades = 9%); Attached Image (click to enlarge) 6. Apply the steps above for every pair to be traded in the TS Order setup; 7. At time of entry apply at market or pending orders so that all entries remain within the upper and lower boundaries of their respective MML Grid. Recheck all the inputs ensuring lots sizes are all correct, SLs and TPs are at a 4 to 1 ratio and are all correct. Monitor the trades. ps. Note that I have intentionally set the number of lots to be traded in a 3 decimal point format as this helps to highlight the exact lot size value in a situation when minimum lot size required may be less than the broker allowed (typically in the case where it is less than 0.01 lots) however the 3rd decimal place must be ignored when placing the order, for example, 0.301 lots would simply drop the 3rd decimal place and apply 0.30 lots ... do not round up as this may increase risk.

The next TS Order 3 scenario will be traded around London Open. Remember to check settings again just prior to planned entry time especially to see if the Octave Gap has changed. On each chart to be traded write Short or Long for each pair so errors in direction do not occur. Now check where the nearest MML entry level is to current price. Then check that the MML Grid allows for 1.5 Octave Gap for the stop and a 6 Octave Gap for the TP (Reward to Risk = 4 to 1 and 4*1.5 is 6 octaves) If the trade setup fits within the boundaries of the MML Grid (no breaching) then an at market order is applied. If either the SL or the TP breaches the MML Grid boundaries (upper and lower) then a pending order is applied. For example, The GBPAUD entry as shown on the chart would be a pending BUY Limit order since we want price to drop lower with a planned higher TP price. For all the entries planned for London session (in about 30 minutes time) note where price currently sits within the MML Grid. Attached Image (click to enlarge) If the MML Grid does not reset by the time a planned entry is to be made then count 6 octaves down the MML Grid such that in the case of this pair the entry would be from the 4/8 MML, TP @ +2/8 MML and SL midway between 2/8 MML &amp; 3/8 MML (as per screenshot). If the MML Grid does reset then re-assess the entry, the MML Grid will shift so be aware of this and how it might affect your entry level. Masterrmind.............

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Example of GBPUD [M15 Chart] Attached Image (click to enlarge) Notice how an MML Grid reset has now occurred. Now for this long setup notice how price no longer needs to make such a deep pullback in order for the pending order to hit the market. Compare both GA MML Grids from this post and the post above. This is why especially on lower TFs or when price is close to the MML Grid upper and lower limts that a re-check must be conducted close to the time of planned entry. Masterrmind.............

All entries have been checked for direction, SL @ 1% and TP @ 4%. Attached Image (click to enlarge) All trades have hard SLs applied.

Steps and Checks 1. Open all 9 charts on an M15 TF applying the MTTTM template 2. Open the Lot_Size-MTTTM-v3A settings and input the following: (i) OctaveGap (as per MML settings shown Top Left corner of each pairs chart), (ii) OctaveGap Multiplier = 1.5, (iii) RiskPerTrade (%) = 1 and (iv) Reward to Risk Ratio = 4 3. Re-Check at planned entry time that the OctaveGap value (MML indicator settings) has not changed (i) if so adjust any affected values in all the relevant pairs (ii) ensure all values are correct 4. For each pair observe where current price is in relation to the MML Grid (i) 1.5 Octave Gaps per each SL must fit within the upper or lower bounds of the MML Grid (ii) 6 Octave Gaps per each TP must fit within the upper or lower bounds of the MML Grid (iii) If the setup fits without breaching the upper or lower MML Grid boundaries take an entry from the nearest MML level (apply @ market, Buy Stop or Sell Stop so that the entry is taken as close as possible to an MML price line (iv) If the setup does not fit then apply a pending order (Buy Stop, Sell Stop, Buy Limit or Sell Limit) that forces the setup (both SL and TP must not exceed the upper or lower MML Grid boundaries) 5. Place all 9 orders (using the TRADE information shown on the chart of each pair) as appropriate for the given TS Order setup and check direction. 6. After entries have been made do another check to ensure all SL's are correct in terms of % at risk and that TP's coincide with correct RRR. 7. Allow the trades to play out (trader discretion can be applied in closing out, tightening of stops or managing the trades) Masterrmind.............

TS Order 3-S7 is now active. Note 1: A trade entry error has been made on the AUDCAD pair so the trade will be closely monitored with the intention of closing it out preferably at BE or in profit. The trade was entered at market when it should have been entered long from the next lower MML level (human error). Note 2: I could close out the 'error' trade for a small loss now but have decided to let it run temporarily in the hope of minimizing the impact. The TP has been reduced to just above BE levels. Note 3: The correct Buy Limit order for AUDCAD has been placed. Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #312 ---
The screenshot in the post above showing the 9 entries (@ market or pending) allows traders to examine their own trade setups on these same pairs to ensure that entries are correct. Note though that price levels may vary slightly from one broker data feed to the next so some variation may occur. Although in general most trade setups should be very similar. After entries have been made 'mouse-over' the Sl and TP levels of each trade setup over all 9 pairs and check that the risk per trade and the TP per trade is close to the values shown at the Risk and Potential reward values displayed on each respective chart. This checking should be done as close as possible to the trade entry or trade order times! For example, Attached Image (click to enlarge) Based on my Account Balance each SL should be close to $109.12 and each TP close to $436.49. Check that all entries especially the stops are not greater than the assigned Risk per Trade (in this case SL per trade is 1% so TP is 4% for RRR of 4). Masetrrmind............

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Now that all checks have been completed simply allow the trades to run their course. On this demo test account I plan to allow trades to run their course as much as possible and any variations to this will be outlined in this thread. Many of these closing factors have been mentioned several times throughout the thread. Once this current TS Order 3-S7 is closed out there will be 1 last scenario (#8) to be traded. Hopefully this occurs prior to month end but time will tell. A deeper analysis of the scenarios and the trade results will be examined and any relevant changes to future TS setups will be outlined. This process may involve TS substitution, pair removal, risk modification or any number of parameter changes. Remember, we are dealing with limited data at this stage (&lt; 100 trades) so we need to be very careful about drawing any 'solid' conclusions. What we need to be doing is elliminating the obvious flaws in our trading system via a dynamic approach. Masterrmind............

Only 7 trades from 9 triggered and accounting for timing of open trades the realized risk was much lower than the 9% figure. 4 winners @ 3.8%, 4.0%, 3.9% and 0.4%. 3 losers @ -1%, -1% and -1%. Net Cycle (Gain/Loss) = ( 3.8+ 4.0 + 3.9 + 0.4 )% - ( 1.0 + 1.0 + 1.0 )% = 12.1% - 3.0% = +9.1% (approx). Another great cycle and the account balance now stands at $11 914.41. +11.9% gain on the account which is certainly headed in the right direction. Additional analytics will be presented at month end.

TS Order 3-S8 TS 1 = AUDNZD + AUDJPY = NZDJPY TS 2 = EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 3 = AUDCAD + GBPCAD = GBPAUD This cycle will be fired off in the Asian session but since its the last day of the week and trades are likely to run over the weekend the risk per trade has been reduced to 0.8%. An alternative is to not trade the cycle today but wait until next week however, I have decided to run it in the hope that the results may generate commentary.

TS Order 3-S8 trades have now been placed during the first hour after Tokyo Open either at market or pending. Attached Image (click to enlarge) 9 possible entries Risk per Trade set at 0.8% Total assumed risk is 7.2% across the account for this Order 3 setup. If a full cycle loss were to occur the account would still show almost a 10% gain. SL_$ per Trade = $95 Total assumed risk = 9 possible trades x $95 = $855. Masterrmind............

Hi Masterrmind, I have spent few hours yesterday to read whole thread. I like the idea and the learning steps that you are providing. What happend in this week? How did the 8th sewtup performed? Are you still managing this thread? If so, than I have here one question. If you open an order at market price, that this order will not be on any octave, or the propability is very low hit exactly the octave line. Where is that SL and TP. From the open price 1:4 ratio or are the sl and tp than on exact octave lines? Anyway I'm looking forward to hear from you about the analysis of which setup to take. If you come back I may have other questions

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Hi Alop, I am currently on vacation throughout the Asian region. The 8th setup is still running and you can check its progress via TE or myfxbook. I plan to update all results when I return home about mid March. It is likely that all current trades including pending orders may complete their journeys without interference or certainly allowed to run as long as a result is possible. I will continue to manage the thread but only provide worded commentary meaning no screenshots until I return home. Any order opened at market price must be as close as possible to an MML price line but the trader must ensure that both the SL and the TP based on the 4 to 1 Reward to Risk ratio does not create a breach of either the upper or lower MML extreme levels namely; +2/8 &amp; -2/8 MMLs. This means that no SL goes beyond either -2/8 or +2/8. This means that no TP goes beyond either +2/8 or -2/8. If a stop or TP would fall outside these extrenums of the MML Grid then pending orders must be applied so that any trade entry fits within the MML Grid at the time of entry. An octave gap is the standard SL at a 1 to 1 ratio. A trader may apply any octave gap ratio for the SL but best within the range of 1 to 2 otherwise the TP may be difficult to setup within the MML Grid since the TP is 4 times as long as any SL applied. 1 octave gap SL = 4 octave gap TP 1.5 octave gap SL = 6 octave gap TP 2 octave gap SL = 8 octave gap TP TP = octave gap SL * Reward Risk Ratio. Recall the MML Grid contains only 12 octaves and 13 MMLs. So a setup applying 2 octaves as SL covers 10 octaves. Entry level to SL plus Entry level to TP = 2 + 8 = 10 octaves. Based on using a strict 4 to 1 Reward to Risk ratio it is elementary to determine max SL octaves that fit within a max of 12 that also satisfies the TP requirement. If Reward to Risk ratio is fixed at 4 to 1 and an entry is made from an MML price line then the TP will align with another MML price line however, the SL may not. If the octave SL ratio contains a decimal point other than .0 or .5 then TP level will not align with another MML price level. Please perform some simple math calculations to verify this for yourself. Imagine octave SL ratio set at 1.2 RRR = 4 Entry at MML price line SL would be 1.2 octave gaps away from entry price TP would be 1.2*4 being 4.8 octaves away from entry price. In this case only the entry falls on an MML line the SL and the TP do not. It is not critical that a TP or SL falls on an MML price line but rather if the setup is confined within the upper and lower boundaries of the MML Grid. Please check some of my previous posts for examples. It is possible that eventually I will code an MT5 EA for this strategy if participation is good. Masterrmind......

I hope you’re having a great holiday. I am also watching and learning from you. You’re very detailed in your training which I love. Please consider mt4 ea I live in Canada and we are limited to what brokers we can use. Panda is my broker and they have no mt5.

Hi AngelicaMari, Thank you for the kind comments. An MT4 EA may also be coded at some future time. ps. Holiday is fantastic and very much needed. Masterrmind.......

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Thank you for your replay. And I'm glad you are still here I'll try to ask one question per post, so that you can answer it easer. If you decide to open 9 pairs at certain moment, why do you bother to wait for the price to reach one octave line, since the tp and sl as you described can does not have to be exactly on one ocatve line. I unserstand that for manula opening you cant do it immiatelly for 9 pairs, but with ea, you cound do it. Would you then still wait for the price to reach one line. My assumption is that the current open price, tp and sl will fit into the mml grid.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
In a triangular setup you take 2 pair one direction and one pair opposite direction. Your assumption about the pair orders were taken from myfxbook about correlation. But you also said that there can be taken other pair orders, depending on the traders choice. What if I always calculate the best combination (your 8 setups) and a dynamic pair order depending on the price position in the grid. Assume that 1. pair and 3. pair are close to +2/8 and a 2. pair close to -2/8. Would a setup of SELL 1. and 3. pair and BUY 2. pair be valid?

--- 帖子 #334 ---
If current price at time of intended entry is not at an MML line or within a few pips (discretionary part) then a pending order must be applied but make sure that such a trade setup is fully inside the MML Grid for SL and TP. Same approach for manual or EA. Just entry time would be 5 to 10 minutes different based on trader manual entry. Entry must be made from an MML line. Masterrmind.......

--- 帖子 #335 ---
I have not fully outlined how I choose the 3 TS's (9 pairs). Be careful about the current 9 pairs I am trading, there was very little thought involved in their choice. Remember I am trading a demo account and showing the outcomes as they unfold but there is much much more to follow regarding triangulated choice. The trader is ultimately responsible for the pair choice and also their direction and I have provided some ideas that can be used to make such a choice. However, some traders may wish to start in a specific market session trading similarly paced pairs and therefore their TS Order 3 may be very different from another traders. The direction of long or short is decided well before planned entry time into the market. One of the 3 pairs should be in the opposite direction to the other 2 in a given TS. The key criteria here is that every trade enteted has a setup that ensures both the SL and the TP remain within the confines of the MML Grid. There are many ways to choose the pairs but some criteria is fixed in stone and should not be changed for example the RRR. Masterrmind......

--- 帖子 #336 ---
When you talk about TF, like M15. Since the MML Grid is created for TF H1, for what do we need to look exactly at M15 TF? Octave lines are same on every TF, since the MML grid is pinned to H1.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Different TFs applying the same MML settings may offer the same MML Grid for the same currency pair however, not always and indeed when I trade HTFs the parameters may vary. The key MML parameters are P, MMP, and StepBack. The M15 TF currently applies P=64 and MMP = 60 with StepBack = 0. H1 may not apply the same settings. I perform an indepth analysis over several pairs using a certain range of historical data and then narrow down the choice to a 'best fit' that suits most pairs for most of the time. This process should be updated regularly and the settings modified if required but as you will find it is not a critical component. I have found that over a yearly TF there is generally not a lot of difference. To understand this in greater depth requires a full understanding of the relationship between trading ranges and the MML indicator calculations for fractal determination. This is not really a requirement in this strategy but at an advanced level Im more than prepared to outline it is detail to those traders who are more inclined to dig deeper and enhance their knowledge. However, the MT5 EA when coded would automatically do these updated calculations and make the necessary changes to the applicable parameters otherwise it would leave the settings alone. Note that the strength of this strategy is in the RRR in combination with the trading ranges and the octaves generated in the MML Grid and the traders ability to make any small changes that seek to offset any loss factors. Ultimately what we want is a higher strike rate as simple as that! ps. The MML Grid is not necessarily created for H1. Masterrmind..........

--- 帖子 #338 ---
I understand, but since the current setup has MMP=60 it means H1. So it means that I can watch for entry not only on M15, but on any TF. Current price or movement of the price is visible on every TF. What I need to understand is how you determinate the direction and the time of entry. Attached Image Lets take this example above. Is one valid setup to BUY EURGBP, GBPUSD and SELL EURUSD? Since 1:4 ratio is taken into account and we are still inside the MML grid.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
From the template for M15 with 64 and 60 change the period and check the MML price levels over multiple TFs. The TS Order 3 that is currently being traded is an example using an almost random type approach. 9 pairs with 8 different scenarios as posted to the thread. Choice of TS's was almost random like. Choice of direction for each scenario was almost random like. Technically, I am using the word random like when in fact it is not but what Im trying to say is that the direction order has had little thought process and simply a group of 8 combinations have been outlined to cover all possible options and then I have traded them in any ordering apart from the final few. I have not yet outlined my approach to the choice of direction for each pair over a given TS. This will be outlined in the next phase which is after the current setup has completed. The pairs you show can be traded like that but note that EU and GU are heavily positively correlated most of the time but not always. Having EU and GU traded in opposite directions might offset some risk but do some checking of the trades shown in this thread to see some intetesting results. Trading all pair setups within the MML Grid is required since we honor the octaves at the time of trade entry. If price breaks out above or below then an MML grid reset occurs and we do not want to be in a trade running unfavorably in this direction but rather undertake a reassessment for a new trade entry in the newly created MML Grid. Time of entry is by trader choice when using a manual trading approach since the trader needs to be physically at the trading platform. An EA approach is entirely different especially if the platform is open continuously. However, we are not yet at that stage. Im outlining bit by bit in easy to chew bites so traders can understand the basics of the strategy. As time moves forward so too can the complexity but going highly complex in the MTTTM strategy may not be what all traders desire. I have hinted towards the flow of information in Post 1 and elsewhere in the thread and so there is much yet to be told. I appreciate your enthusiasm but direction and timing will be addressed later. Masterrmind.......

I have decided to try M TTT M setup today. I have used same pairs as you. I opened at LO. I looking for a direction, based on the position of the strongest pair, so that I ended up with this setup: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Lotsize does not matter, since it is a first attempt for a prove of concept. I open only limit orders, with sl = 1.5 octaves and tp = 6 octaves. Currently GC and AC have reached SL. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I had some error on EG, so I opened it later as supposed. What is you opinion Masterrmind?

--- 帖子 #341 ---
If you could post an M15 chart of some of your entries showing entry, SL and TP it will make it far easier for me to make comments. Masterrmind........

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Scenarios/Permutation for each order 1 set can be: (Formula = Answer where the formula pairs are both BUY or SELL) A + B = C A + C = B B + C = A 1. Now is it possible to randomly choose any of these and trade. I don't think so, because at the time of choosing to enter trades, if you base your decision on the formula pairs, they are either in the upper or lower octaves meaning a fixed BUT for a pair in lower octaves and fixed SELL for a pair in upper Octaves. 2. For a strategy based on formula pairs, if a pair is on 4/8 linne, it becomes discretionary whether you want to BUY or SELL. Some other criteria can be added to make a decision 3. The fact that formula pairs are both BUY or both SELL, means that the biggest decision is whether the Answer Pair Will track the first or second formula pair. Again some other criteria can be added to make this decision Therefore I would think not all scenarios traded here are valid.

Perhaps I should have mentioned that showing the full MML Grid for each trade setup would be very useful. Im simply wanting to see that all your entries satisfy the MML Grid criteria. Provided that you applied the correct octave gap at the time of entry then all is well and good. However, if a pending order has been placed and has yet to trigger into the market and the MML Grid resets with a different octace gap then it is at your discretion whether or not you decide to delete out that pending order and set a new pending order based on the updated octave. Thanks for posting. Masterrmind.......

Interesting Thread Masterrmind, this also made me go back and read a couple of your other posts which are great as well! Just finished reading it all and will be following along as I am a fan of Math/Stat based strategies. This is a great read about the possibility of making money on a "Perfect Hedge" effectively making money with a net zero position, although it seems that it is unlikely to be able to be profitable with retail brokers due to latency/spread/slippage/commision, it is an interesting concept.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
A few more demo testing runs and some learnings to follow and soon enough a live test run will be commenced. There is good reason to teach this strategy in such a way and that is because a trader needs to be alert in identifying losing factors as they become evident and minimize any forward impact ... a dynamic approach if you will. Plenty more material to learn yet including an automated version. Masterrmind.......

Please be aware that the charts posted above may show different MML Grids to the ones active at time of trade entry. This is due to the updating nature and the internal calculations of the MML Octaves. At the time of trade closure some of the gain % and loss % figures may show differently between on chart indicator and say myfxbook analytics, this is due to the fact that trades are posted much later when the account balance may be different from when myfxbook considers the calculation. Therefore small variations are possible and easily explained. I could have left these final trades out and not bothered to post them however, I prefer completeness and so they were posted. Next post will provide a summary of the TS Order 3-S8 trades. Masterrmind...........

You will need to apply the template in Post 1 as it contains all the other necessary indicators for this MTTTM strategy. Be sure to place tpl files in the template folder, indicators in the indicator folder and be sure to delete out the older version Lot_Size-MTTTM indicator and replace it with the current version. Then save this as a new template (using the same or a different name as you wish). The indicator list should then look like the following: Attached Image Any issues let me know and I'll walk you through the entire process (if necessary). At the beginning of each month there will only need to be 1 indicator replaced and that is the Lot_Size-MTTTM indicator because I have it hard coded to expire at month end.

A shift from 1 octave to 1.5 octaves for the SL's remains a good strategy move at this stage and will remain in force 2. Worst performing pairs are GBPAUD @ -5.3% loss and AUDJPY @ -3.8% loss however, both pairs are only about 1 win away from DD recovery so I do not see this as necessarily critical although further analysis is warranted if they continue to be traded (explained later); 3. Win/Loss sequence best shown in the following chart Attached Image (click to enlarge) Note: The red circles results were not included in the win/loss sequence due to both their minimal magnitude and being applied in error. Although the bar chart shows 2 losing sequences of 10 losses it should be noted that a maximum of 8 losses in any single TS Order setup occurred. Clearly a key dynamic part of the trader is to continually search for possible avenues of reducing losses and maximizing winners. Masterrmind...........

The primary reason is so that traders get to work through trading setups and examples in a manual only type approach and gain from the experience. I plan to code (in MT5 ) the entire trading strategy for MTTTM including all necessary indicators, scripts and an Expert Advisor and any other plug-ins. Very few traders have caught onto the power of this system and how only a very few positive trades can lead to respectable gains with reasonable DD. A key understanding is the relationship between the Reward to Risk ratio and how the trade setups fit within the applicable MML Grid octaves. Notice how the test accounts have been using 1% risk per trade (on 2 occasions 0.8% risk per trade was applied) over a possible 9 trades and yet the maximum DD is recorded as 13.7% (TE) and 15.09% (myfxbook) for a +30% gain in Equity . On a live account risk per trade of 0.5% might be more appropriate but I will leave this decision to the trader. There are multiple levels of competency in this trading strategy. Stage 1 only covered the basic competencies. Stage 2, 3 and 4 lead into more advanced levels of understanding. The highest level is unlikely to be shown here due to its highly sophisticated analytical approach (it uses MATLAB and Python code). The good news though is that a trader only needs the basic competencies to do very well and the higher levels are not really necessary in any case. Although a full understanding allows for timely modifications and an expected improvement in results over the longer term. MT4 You are welcome to develop a script for placing trades as a testing means if you wish. The script needs to get all required trading account data, get user input settings data and the relevant MML Grid settings (P, MMP and StepBack). Then determine the correct Lot size, Entry price, SL price and TP price such that all price levels remain within the domain of the applicable MML Grid. So the upper +2/8 MML and lower -2/8 MML price extremes must be checked to ensure MML Grid criteria is always met at trade entry time. Information provided as a basic guide only. If you need further information please let me know however, I will not be providing a full automated version of this strategy if participation remains low even though I know several traders already applying the method with good results.

Stage 2 TS Order 3 will be as follows: TS1: EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS2: AUDCAD + EURCAD = EURAUD TS3: GBPCAD + CADCHF = GBPCHF Base to Counter as the TS stands now is as follows: AUD - 1 base + 1 counter CAD - 1 base + 3 counter CHF - 0 base + 2 counter EUR - 4 base + 0 counter GBP - 3 base + 1 counter USD - 0 base + 2 counter Check: 9 base + 9 counter = 9 pairs! As the TS stands currency overweight may need to be considered. The CAD related pairs can tend to be wild at times so trade outcome moving forward will be closely monitored and if necessary some of these pairs may be removed and others inserted although triangulation will also be maintained which means that a new TS set (just the 3 pairs) may need to be sought in some cases. If this situation arises I will explain the basics behind any modifications and what it entails. Next post will show the direction of each pair! Masterrmind...........

Pair Direction by trader choice (considering correlations, currency weighting and MML Grid Chart structure) TS Order 3-S1 TS1: EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS2: AUDCAD + EURCAD = EURAUD TS3: GBPCAD + CADCHF = GBPCHF Although the factors listed above have been considered in the direction chosen for each pair it is not always possible to have all pairs in the preferred direction due to having to satisfy the triangulation requirement.

Next Steps ... Open all charts in M15 TF for the pairs listed above in the order TS1 ... TS2 and TS3 Apply the template to all 9 charts ( in a TS Order 3 setup) Change the settings of each chart so that the MML Grid octave gap matches exactly (otherwise your trading values will be wrong) and input multiplier, Risk per trade and the RRR (set=4). Attached Image (click to enlarge) The top 4 variables are the key ones. Based on pair direction type long or short on each of the 9 charts so that trade entry direction errors are minimzed in manual mode! Masterrmind...........

AUDCAD Attached Image (click to enlarge) Incorrect trade entry (wrong lot size applied due to an increase in the OctaveGap size at time of entry). Managed to close it out at $0.00 meaning no damage done. Immediately entered the correct lot size for the updated Octave Gap. Looks like that trade is headed towards the stop rather quickly which is the correct direction in terms of current sentiment. Price has moved about half an octave against that position at this time so I still have a full octave to play with. Lets see! Masterrmind...........

EURGBP Loss trade -1.0% Attached Image (click to enlarge) Not entirely surprising considering such a small octave gap (7.6 pips) generating only 11.4 pips as the stop. Was used due to the cross it creates applying EURUSD and GBPUSD. If it generates another loss in the very next scenario then I'll axe it and split the EURUSD and GBPUSD pairs into separate TS's thereby removing the need to trade the EG pair.

Following the master at work.... Is proximity to news considered, or the fact that hedge trades are taken nullifies this criteria? Do you have analysis of pending/market orders won/lost

Looking at a TS order 1 sometime after next London open. Most likely the E/U, G/U &amp; E/G but open to re-evaluation after I wake up about two hours after London open. This should provide nice and wide MML octaves. Also looking forward to participating more often.

A trader should always be aware of the news (especially anticipated high impact events) and how it typically causes larger than average price swings either side of the data release time. Such swings can prematurely take out your stops or drive price faster to your TP. The Basic Version of the MTTTM strategy does not really delve into the likely impact of news on trade setups. The Basic Version of the MTTTM strategy is more of a set and forget type mechanical approach. The Basic Version of the MTTTM strategy is very robust by design and applies a fixed Reward to Risk ratio and setups that fall within the MML Grid. Although the method is rather rigid and mechanical this does not imply that the trader should be of the same makeup, rather the trader must be very observant, flexible and dynamic. In other words, a good trader will look at the unfolding trading problems, assess them and then attempt to correct or at least minimize the impact of any determined losing factors in a timely manner so that an expectation of a future higher strike rate is maintained as a key objective. In simple terms, the trader should always be searching for ways to minimize losses and increase the strike rate! Clearly the opening of trade setups minutes before NFP might be pushing their luck. Please be aware that I am currently trading on a demo test account so it is not unlikely that I will intentionally trade at least 1 scenario during NFP as a means of generating commentary. Should this occur I will post it well before the fact so all traders are aware. Hedge Trades Never assume that a hedge setup (say in a triangulated format) can protect the account entirely in a high impact news event. Since our stops on the M15 TF (MML Octave Gaps) are relatively small then it is always possible to have all 3 trades stopped out. During such a news event a hedging setup should allow for much larger stops on all pairs in the hedge. The currently applied MML Grid settings on M15 [P=64, MMP=60] is NOT ideal for a typical hedge setup UNLESS the stops are removed and this is NOT an option in the basic version of the MTTTM strategy. Higher TF trading on say H4, D1 with modified settings is far more useful, infact even M15 TF can be traded for better hedge setups by modifying the MML settings basically to generate appropriate octaves (much larger). "Do you have analysis of pending/market orders won/lost" I have all the trading log files in MT4 so an analysis could be undertaken if desired but I do not have the analysis in front of me. A good question being asked here but keep in mind that the significance of this analysis would be based on a sample size of only 64 or so trades so be careful drawing any conclusions at this early stage, nevertheless it would be a great idea to track this over the longer term. There might be some software floating around that could speed up the process so I'll do some checking around and re-visit this again later. Masterrmind.............

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Yes the option is always there to simply wait for an ideal octave gap that fits better with the planned trading session. Its likely that I will add in a few additional guidelines to Post 1 especially in the Octave Gap space as a too small octave leaves the trade no real room to breathe and a very likely stop out (at least statistically speaking). If its on a live account consider starting out with very small risk such as 0.25% or 0.5% per trade. You can always increase the risk on the next TS Order 1. Participation is always welcome! Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Indeed. I am tempted to open it now, but that 7.6 octave on the E/G is too small for that spread right now. Best to wait and see what it looks like after I wake up. Other option is to look into a different TS this evening; something for the Asian/Frankfurt sessions and hopefully a surprise to wake up to. Right now it is dinner time but I will be back after for another hour or two before bedtime. // Oh yes, it is live. I am going for 0.2% risk per trade.

Return by Trade Chart By observing our trading strategy results and in particular the Return by Trade Chart it is possible to make some important risk decisions. Attached Image (click to enlarge) For example, the chart clearly shows the advance and pullback behavior in this trading strategy so we can form an expectation of what is likely to occur in the next TS Order 3 setup (or whatever Order TS the trader is trading). It does not mean and I am not suggesting that this pullback will occur but what I am saying is that we can make an educated guess by simply observing the patterns formed on the chart. The idea here is that if we are reasonably confident that a pullback in the Return by Trade Chart is due to occur then why not consider reducing the Risk per Trade. Instead of using the default 1% (in my case) drop it down to 0.5% Risk per Trade. Ofcourse, if you separate the Return by Trade Chart into individual blocks of TS Order 3's then you'll soon realize that typically 2-3 losses occur at the start of each TS Order 3 setup, a simple explanation for this is that price only has to move 1/4 of the distance to the stop line as it does to the TP line so its expected that more stop outs will occur in the initial stages. As the completed trade count increases overtime from say 100 to 200 to 500 trades then I recommend that this Return by Trade Chart be studied. Remember, the good trader will seek out ways which can minimize future losses and this is one of them. There are several others ! ps. On the current TS Order 3 I did not reduce the risk per trade since I know that the initial 2-3 trades are likely to be stopped out. pps. In the early stages of account building what I am more concerned about is preserving the account and so if a completed TS cycle causes equity to drop below initial invested capital (original balance) then I will immediately reduce the Risk Per Trade on the next TS Order 3. ppps. Another approach is to add additional funds into the trading account if Equity drops below 10% of the initial account balance but the total risk per TS setup needs to be considered. pppps. Example: Trader has 2K to trade, deposit 1K or 1.5K and leave 1K or 0.5K as funds that can be deposited as a 'top up' if needed typically only in the early stages. Often the account balance will dip below the initial deposit amount on some daily close but if the strategy and the trader are any good at all usually the Equity Curve will be managed over the longer term so that future falls below initial deposits does not occur. If the TS Order 3's are producing consecutive net losses one after the other then the strategy should be paused and an analysis undertaken to determine any possible reasons why the continual decline in Equity is occuring and then seek to minimize the impact or remove the losing factors asap. A back of the envelope figure for this might be when 2 or 3 net negative losses occur from completed TS Orders although a %equity decline value can be applied. Good trading, Masterrmind...........

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Looks like you are well organized and your risk per trade is in check. Nice work! ps. If you post your empty charts of the pairs you wish to trade at the time closest to planned entry then I can check that all your entries fit within the MML Grid and meet the required criteria. It is easy to make mistakes (I have made a few incorrect entries at times on the TS Order 3's but you are trading only 3 pairs so it should be somewhat simpler ... hmmm!). Masterrmind...........

I have been lurking and reading this strat for awhile and I am ready to give it a serious try. The only thing that is holding me back is your plan to code an EA on mt5 and not mt4 also. I would love to do some testing and share my results with you but I will never be able to use the EA. In Canada we are limited like the US on the brokers we can use. Oanda which is one of the few brokers I can use doesn't offer mt5 so I am in a bind. If you are willing to also code it in mt4 I am all in. If you are willing to code it in mt4 I am willing to do some live test on a small account with small lot sizes to see how it performs.

--- 帖子 #392 ---
No need to rush in when its on a live account. Rest up and catch you later on. Masterrmind...........

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Yes I hear you well. In any case I am not planning on releasing a basic MT5 version until at least the end of Stage 3 and more likely to those traders who have attempted the manual trading approach. If I have the time at that stage then I may code an MT4 version but understand that this venture is very time consuming. Others are welcome to code up scripts or EA's as they see fit. There is enough information in the thread to allow for an EA capable of automating a basic MTTTM version but not the advanced version. As each stage of the MTTTM Strategy is rolled out the level increases quite sharply, hence my desire to slowly work from 1 stage to the next. Traders only need the basic strategy to do quite well and then they can follow along with the trades I take on the demo test account to gain a better understanding. Hope this is clear.

OK so here is what I am thinking..... AUD/CAD + GBP/CAD = GBP/AUD CAD – 0 base / 2 counter GBP – 2 base / 0 counter AUD – 1 base / 1 counter A/C and G/C – Short G/A then, must go long. (please note the lot calculator on these charts is not properly set yet. I will do that next.) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Above is AUD/CAD... Seems high on the D1 and also in the template. So I want that one to go short. Next is GBP/CAD... Also seems high in the D1 and the template. Short also on this one. Attached Image (click to enlarge) And finally, GBP/AUD. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Because the other two are already short, this one then must go long. Even though, it looks like it should go short as well, it is the least strong short of all three in my opinion. So this one will go long. Please share your thoughts on this when you have a moment. I am not yet 'super-sold' on this TS and willing to re-evaluate and maybe switch it around if necessary.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
The above TS is now live in the market with 0.2% risk per trade. ... and was closed almost immediately as I realized I had taken all three trades in the WRONG DIRECTION. Super genius I am! Because my positions were so small, the damage was negligible. about a dollar or two loss and one was a small win. Let me try to get this going again, this time in the correct direction...... Done. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Yes getting the direction right is key here. I decide the direction and then at time of entry label each pair with long or short in blue or red text so that errors are minimized. Although I enter 9 trade setups and take my time with all the details I usually make an error every so often. Any issues with the lot sizes or entry setup? Masterrmind........

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Lot sizes were rounded-off downward. So instead of 0.045 lots, I went with 0.04 lots. All three were rounded off downward. Also, one of them (G/A long) does have the TP outside of the MML grid, I will note that and will fly with it as is knowing that it falls outside of the rules from that angle. The third thing is that I did not wait for the price to be exactly on the MML lines. I took all three as market orders wherever the price was at the time of entry. All these little things can be smoothed out as time passes and more TS are taken. Now monitoring progress.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Wow you have a few powerful pairs in that TS Order 1. Lets see how it goes for you. Masterrmind.........

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Rounding the lots down is good form. I use 3 decimal places in the lots for clarity but always round down or simply trade 2 decimal places. Make a final check and ensure that SL and TP fit within the MML Grid. Mousing over the stop loss and TP lines is also a good idea to make a final check that risk is at 0.2% usually check the $ values as shown on the indicator and 0.8% for the TP. Masterrmind.........

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Yes, I spent about 1.5 hours looking at different combinations before settling in on this one. I looked at your results and the better pairs and tried to work them into the equation while also keeping all the rules in mind. I also looked at the D1 chars and what that looked like for each pair. This was to help support my view of the direction the pair is likely to go next and seeing if that lined up with the M15/Template charts. All seems to line up better than 90%. I am looking forward to seeing the outcome of this TS!

The GA pair didn't perform that well on the previous 8 scenarios so I axed it from stage 2 setups. Masterrmind.............

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Not too bad except as you say the GA setup is incorrect and should have been from entered from a different MML level. Just monitor it closely up in the extreme MML zone and use your own judgement to close it out if PA stalls and looks like the bears want to come in strong. You can delete out the Bar Timer indicator if you wish as its just an extra for knowing when an M15 candle is nearing closure ... entry timing but not really necessary. Once your trades are up and running and you are happy with everything you can turn off the visibility of the Lot_Size indi to clear up your chart. Also the sessions indi can be removed if you like to make the chart cleaner, its main purpose is so that its easier to show other traders on the thread at which major open the TS Order was opened, other than that its not really necessary. There is a newer template with 2018, I notice your chart reads 12/2017 but if it works the way you like it then its all good otherwise the newer one can be found in Post 1. Very nice to see well presented and posted charts ... excellent! Masterrmind..........

GBPAUD - Example setup that meets the MML Grid criteria. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Price must drop down to the 4/8 MML and trade opened using a pending Buy Limit order in this case with the SL 1.5 Octaves below the entry (2.5/8 MML if you like) and TP is 6 Octaves above entry MML (or +2/8 MML in this setup). So for a long setup you soon realize that if current price (just prior to a planned entry) is just above the 4/8 MML Central Pivot then a Buy Limit order will be used with an entry @ the 4/8 MML, SL 1.5 Octaves below entry level and TP at the +2/8 MML.

Ahh yes, better after cleaning up a bit. No need for anything extra on the charts after the TS is up and going. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Note: MML grid has updated itself in AUD/CAD...

Hi Can you share your system template ?

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Its just a matter of going through several examples of longs and shorts at different MML levels and soon enough the entry setup will be a walk in the park. Lets see how your trades turn out. Small risk to start with is the right approach, later you play with the risk setting values in unison with your Return by Trade and Equity Charts. I refer to this trade management technique as Equity Curve Trace Management or ECTM for short and I'll explain that when the time is right! Masterrmind.............

Cycle closed out in net profit. Net gain was 0.14499 % Attached Image (click to enlarge) However, I did not let it play out. Attached Image (click to enlarge) G/A was up to 135 pips in profit at one point and started retreating. Also, AUDCAD was moving towards SL fast. Closed both trades while the TS was still in net profit. I gambled that things would begin to go against me and closed out. This time it may or may not work out in my favor. However, this is something I need to work on (Not doing!). In my case, it may be better to set these and forget them. As my "monitoring" usually does more harm than good. (case in point). I look forward to getting more of these going.

Masterrmind, I wonder what the difference between taking several individual TS order 1s at random separate times and taking an order 3 TS all at once would be. For example: Day 1 at 8AM, start one TS order 1. Later on that same day you spot another good set of currencies and you start another TS order 1. Now there are two independent TS order 1s going. Next day, its just mid afternoon and both previous TS order 1s are still active. You take a glance at the charts and notice yet another good setup on three pairs and you fire off a third TS order 1. Now you have three, completely independent TS order 1s going which were opened independently at fairly different times. For the sake of argument, the same currency pair is not repeated in any of these TS order 1s. What would be the difference between the above and taking a TS order 3 all at once?

You could certainly test it out on a demo if you wish. In fact what I do is have TS Orders running on a demo whilst I'm actively trading the strategy live. I'm always looking for little subtleties hidden in the testing setups that I can use in a live setup. There are literally an infinite number of ways to trade these TS setups. The main idea here though is to start with something and whilst its working and is net profitable, keep it trading, but as I say be dynamic in nature always hunting for any small changes that lead to a higher strike rate (or minimize losses). The market is a strange beast and we as alert traders need to be aware that the market might simply be feeding us with very good data and we win hand over fist ... we cannot become too complacement and expect the good times to continue to roll on unhindered because there will surely come a time when the market starts spitting out unfavorable data and losses can start to mount. By keeping in close with our trading statistics we can attempt to minimize the negative impacts whether it means swapping out a certain pair with another or reducing risk per trade whilst we weather the storm. The trading method might well be an almost set&amp;forget type approach but we still need to be dynamic and aware of what our trade outcomes are trying to tell us ... and then be super timely in responding. If Risk Per trade is 1%, 1 less loss means +5% gain in Equity ... its a big deal! Trading the TS Order 1 and having only 3 pairs can lead to interesting results, why? If you look at my testing results thus far you will notice an average number of losses that typically occurs at the start of the TS setup. Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #423 ---
In the advanced versions of this strategy there is dynamic feed approach (DFA) . The DFA is a technique that continually looks at slotting into a currently running TS Order# setup with fresh entries as soon as 1 entry has closed. The slotted pair must fit with the makeup of the TS design. Basically, it means that a TS cycle never stops, it continually gets fed with a new pair as other trades close out or until the trader or an automated system pauses or stops it. In manual mode there will be gaps in the 'new' entries because a trader cannot be at the trading terminal 24/5. In auto mode its very active and very efficient but still needs to be actively managed at times. Anyway thats well into the future. Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Yes next week sounds good, no need to open a fresh TS leading into Friday (unless in testing mode). I still have a handful of trades running currently so I'll need to monitor them at times throughout the trading day. Although we are trading off an M15 Chart you'll notice that the average trade duration is rather long meaning that its possible for trades to run over the weekend and be subject to gapping issues. On a live account it might be an option to close out the cycle if it can be done as net positive ... trader choice! Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Hmmm! I like the idea of the DFA. Very interesting concept. I'd love to hear more about it when the time comes. Good evening. It is rest time for me. I will be back in the morning.

If I were to take a TS order 3 right now as the market is (an exercise as the market is obviously closed and such) here is what I would be tempted to take and why. AUD/NZD + EUR/NZD = EUR/AUD AUD/CHF + CAD/CHF = AUD/CAD EUR/CHF + EUR/CAD = CAD/CHF The daily MML lines agree and so do all but one of the H1 MML. I looked at the correlations at the H1, D1 and W1. Strongly correlated pairs* are traded such that the risk is in opposite directions. In other words, spread out as much as possible. One of the three TS order 1 has a highly correlated pair spread out as such. Another one is almost completely non-correlated in its members. And the third is a mixed bag but no strong correlations going in the same direction at all at anytime as best I can tell. You will notice the CAD/CHF pair is short, but it is already low in both the D1 MML and the H1 MML. This is because I want to maintain the long/short balance as shown below. AUD - Long x 2 + Short x 2 NZD - Long x 1 + Short x 1 EUR - Long x 2 + Short x 2 CHF - Long x 2 + Short x 2 CAD - Long x 2 + Short x 2 So, hypothetically speaking if the market were open right now, I think that would be a tempting set to take and that is why. Thoughts? *Strongly correlated means they are either Positive or Negatively correlated at all of the following: The one hour, one day and one week levels. No mixed bags. Using the Oanda Currency Correlation table.

So, basically the edge here is hiding in the smallest unit; the triangulated set of order 1. Three pairs in the following pattern: A/B B/C A/C Each one could be short or long. For a triangulated set we need to keep to the pattern of 2 of one and 1 of the other. Let’s take a few “for instance” scenarios as such: Scenario One A/B - Long B/C - Long A/C - Short Scenario Two A/B - Long B/C – Short A/C - Long Scenario Three A/B - Short B/C - Long A/C - Long Note: Not a complete list. Just an example. You can also do 2 shorts and one long for another set of these. Above is an example of how we can position the sets. Now, the other side of this is what the market does. This will be defined as economies (and as a result their currency) getting stronger or weaker. For each currency or economy (not pair) I would say it can do any of the following: Get Much Stronger Get Slightly Stronger No Change Get Slightly Weaker Get Much Weaker So, let’s take the above scenarios and look at them through several different filters or contexts which the market can throw at us. Context A: Currency “A” gets stronger. Currency B gets weaker and currency “C” is not changed at all. A = Stronger B = Weaker C = No change Under that context, here are the possible results of each scenario: Scenario One A/B – Long + A stronger &amp; B weaker = Likely win. B/C – Long + B weaker &amp; C no change = Likely in DD for a while or loss. A/C – Short + A Stronger &amp; C no change = Likely in DD or loss. Scenario Two A/B – Long + A stronger &amp; B weaker = Likely win. B/C – Short + B weaker and C no change = likely in profit or win. A/C – Long + A Stronger and C no change = likely in profit or win. Scenario Three A/B – Short + A stronger and B weaker = Likely Loss B/C – Long + B weaker and C no change = likely in DD or loss A/C – Long + A stronger and C no change = Likely in profit or a win. OK, now let’s look at another context. Same set of pairs . Context B: Currency “A” gets stronger. Currency B gets Stronger but not as much as “A” and currency “C” is Just a little bit weaker. A = Much Stronger B = Stronger C = Slightly Weaker Under that new context, here are the possible results of each scenario: Scenario One A/B – Long + A Much stronger &amp; B stronger = Likely stalemate or hovering over a small profit. B/C – Long + B Stronger &amp; C slightly weaker = Likely win or in profit at least. A/C – Short + A Much Stronger &amp; C slightly weaker = Likely loss. Scenario Two A/B – Long + A Much stronger &amp; B stronger = Likely Stalemate or in small profit. B/C – Short + B stronger and C slightly weaker = likely loss or in DD A/C – Long + A Much stronger and C slightly weaker = likely win or at least in profit. Scenario Three A/B – Short + A Much stronger and B stronger = Likely stuck in DD or loss. B/C – Long + B Stronger and C slightly weaker = likely a win or in profit. A/C – Long + A Much stronger and C slightly weaker = Likely win or in profit. Let us look at yet a third. Mind you, there are more combinations than those shown here for example only. Context C : Currency “A” gets very weak. Currency B gets much Stronger and currency “C” is Just a little bit stronger. A = Very Weak B = Much Stronger C = Slightly Stronger Under that new context, here are the possible results of each scenario: Scenario One A/B – Long + A Very Weak &amp; B Much Stronger = Likely loss. B/C – Long + B Much Stronger &amp; C Slightly Stronger = Likely in profit. A/C – Short + A Very Weak &amp; C Slightly Stronger = Likely in profit. Scenario Two A/B – Long + A Very Weak &amp; B Much Stronger = Likely loss. B/C – Short + B Much Stronger and C Slightly Stronger = likely in DD. A/C – Long + A Very Weak and C Slightly Stronger = likely in DD. Scenario Three A/B – Short + A Very Weak and B Much Stronger = Likely win. B/C – Long + B Much Stronger and C Slightly Stronger = likely in profit A/C – Long + A Very Weak and C Slightly Stronger = Likely in DD. There are a lot of combinations that the market can throw at us; the above are just a few examples. However, I think the power of this system is in the Triangulated Set of Order 1. Because if you construct this properly, it should have a pretty good chance of getting at least one win under most circumstances (of course, not all ). And if you make a TS order 3 from three well constructed TS order 1s, then your TS order 3 has a better than average chance of getting at least 3 winners, which results in a 6% increase on the account if you measure with the 1% risk per trade metric. Of course, all of this is hypothetical and can be complete horse manure if the market decides that today is your day to pay dues. But having said that, I believe this has a fair chance of being profitable in the live market. We will soon find out.

Correlations (myfxbook) Weekly Attached Image (click to enlarge) Daily Attached Image (click to enlarge) Hourly Attached Image (click to enlarge) Accounting for risk is something I like to read in other traders posts. Correlation risk Currency weighting risk Entry timing risk Risk per trade Reward to Risk Ratio Spread ?? If the market were open now (assume all the setups occur at DO time) when would you time your entries? What session and why? Trading range averages and typical market behavior (PA) in and around time of entry is also useful but with multiple TS entries its not always possible to have all factors align due to having to satisfy the triangulated pairings so what we attempt to do is have most pairs aligned. Its also useful to run a 'planned' TS Order 3 setup on a forward tested demo account (or better still a small live account) to form a basic opinion about how it might run in the live market. At the time of entry on the larger account (real) the market data will be different but at least some form of an expectation of what might occur has been shown. Once the 'specially' designed TS Order # (1,3,5 etc) hits the market, there should be several cycle completions undertaken and over time the key trading analytics must be analyzed. Obvious weaknesses in any part of the TS Order # (pairs, market timing, SL Octave ratio choice, etc) should be identified as soon as there is enough data to support a decision. Under no circumstances should a TS Order# be junked (abandoned) after 1 to 2 scenarios (even if it results in consecutive net losses) because this is NOT enough time to pass judgement! If the trader can determine that a major error occured in the design phase of the TS Order setup then corrections should be made immediately. Otherwise run the TS Order # again and compare the 2 attempts of completed cycles. At the end of the day it is the robust Reward to Risk ratio and the spreading of currency risk that will generally see most TS Order setups weather the worst of storms. In brief, once the TS Order# has been designed, check it and re-check it and once happy then trade it in the market, make notes, keep a track of the trading data and start with the smallest risk initially because risk can be added on the next cycle of trades (eg Risk per Trade set @ 0.1% then 0.2% and so on up to an assigned maximum risk ... this risk per trade must have a maximum level that you personally are aware of and do not ever exceed). TS Order 1 (3 pairs) 1% risk per trade = 3% across the account if all trades open in the market. TS Order 3 (9 pairs) 1% risk per trade = 9% across the account if all trades open in the market. ... ... TS Order N (3N pairs) ........................................................................................................................... Masterrmind...........

Perhaps you might like to give it a try in the market come Monday. Start with relatively low risk per trade especially if using a real account, get the directions and trade setups as per TS plan (label long or short on each chart) and trade it over a minimum of 3 full TS Order 3 setups. Trades could also be entered via a demo account by other interested traders and comparisons made between pair entry SL and TP over all trades. When do you plan to enter this setup? It might also be interesting to see same day , but different session entry times and make comparisons, although to be fair these would need to be run over multiple weeks and months so that any discernible patterns in the data can be validated.

The correlation table that I used is the one from Oanda. I prefer that one because it is more visual and with a quick glance you can see what the correlation story is for a given currency pair vs all other pairs. However, the end result should be the same either way so up to trader's choice. I think correlation of pairs is important because if you're not careful you could start 2 trades in the same direction which are 85% or more the same trade basically. This would not be advisable as it does not spread the risk around. However, trading those same correlated pairs in opposite directions may be a good idea as it sets things up for at least one of those to win. I think correlated pairs can be very good to use, as long as one pays close attention to the direction of the trades, etc. I most certainly am planning on running the TS at my next opportunity. However, the question of when to start the set I think is a very important one and I have not yet given much thought to that. My initial thoughts are that I may want to start the TS just before volatility increases. The idea there being that the trades will progress faster shortly after being started rather than range for a long time after starting. As you mentioned, this will have to be tested in order to fine tune it based on actual result data. But to start with, I think I might start the set just before bed which for me is about 7:30PM to 8:00PM Mountain time (about 1:30 to 2:00AM GMT). This would give me plenty of time after arriving home from my day job to build the TS. After making the TS active in the market, I can go to bed and give the markets time to unfold. Frankfurt and LO take place while I am resting. When I wake up and check sometime after LO, my hopes are that the market has moved a good bit and trades are either closed or well on their way. Also, I am pondering the pros/cons of starting a TS order 3 all at once or just starting various TS order 1s as the market presents the best opportunities to enter such. Right now, I am leaning towards starting a TS order 1 and then starting subsequent TS order 1s as the setups appear. This would be subject to opportunity (in other words, if I find a TS-order 3 all ready to go and looking good from all angles, then of course I am going for it.) Again, worth testing with a larger sample size. I also agree that a pair should not be discarded without a fair amount of evidence. Besides, we are Triangulating. To me, in this context, that implies that there will be a loss or two for each TS order 1 which is fine as long as there is also one win that comes along with that.

Correlation data is plentiful so up to trader choice. I see nothing wrong with starting with 1 by TS Order 1 and as opportunity arises add into it with another TS Order 1. Personally, if the account can handle the risk per trade of a TS Order 3 then I'd always be trading this configuration because it distributes the risk over a possible 9 pairs not just 3 and recall that we use pending orders here which means with a TS Order 1 its possible that only 1 trade might be running in the market with 2 dormant orders waiting to be triggered. However, I'll leave this decision to the trader at this stage and he/she can make up their own mind after several completed setups. The other option is to NOT apply pending orders on a TS Order 1 but rather set all enties at market. TS Order market entry timing is an interesting beast. What you don't want to be doing is planting the TS right in front of 'known' high impact news, that's just asking to be stopped out. Entries an hour or so either side of a major market session (TO, LO or NY) appear to work well but you'll notice that some pending orders placed at the time do not trigger until market activity builds up and volatility triggers these orders sometimes hours later (except when price races away against trigger levels of course). I am still working on whether or not its more advantageous to apply all valid entries at market price (no pending orders). Ofcourse all of the pending trades would need to be replaced with other valid at market trades since the pending setups are NOT valid at the time of setup hence the reason they are pending. Market price needs to move a certain direction before they become valid within the confines of the relevant MML Grid. So its not easy to test since the TS Order 3 makeup would necessarily be different. I suppose all I could do is forward test multiple TS Order 3's where every pair entry aligns with a valid at market price execution and compare these results side by side with the approach I currently take. Yet another issue that certainly would arise would be of non triangulated compliance because its difficult to get a TS (only 3 triangulated pairs) that are all in a location that allows all 3 enties to be made at market. A comprehensive Dashboard that can monitor valid TS setups quickly comes to mind! Discarding a pair could be performed many different ways including a temporary barring where its NOt used for 1 calendar month after which it gets another attempt. Main reason behind discarding a pair is typically due to poor performance, no point trading it if it continually leads to loss after loss but other factors should be considered too including if the Sls are seen to be too tight or other trade setup rational.

Trade setups look ok as far as I can tell. AN pair appears to have a slightly wider stop than 1.5*Octave but maybe its just my view. Lot sizes were truncated at the 2 decimal point so all good. And I'm assuming you checked your risk per trade over all 3 trades and the TPs align with a 4 to 1 reward to risk ratio. If so, all good. Lets see how they play out but remember that only 3 pairs are currently in action meaning only 1 full TP winner required for the cycle to be net positive. Assumed max risk over 3 trades is 0.3%. Assumed max gain over 3 trades is 1.2%. Masterrmind.............

Hello Mastermind, Interesting thread and strategy you're talking here. I like to share my thoughts also with you if i can and you deside if are of some value or not. This weekend i have gone throught the whole thread and see that your method has a lot of potencial,i like a lot also that one of your main concerns is how to control risk which is a key factor to maintain a profitable strategy in the long run. I agree that 4 to 1 risk reward and the different lot sizing to make sure that always risking a fixed % of capital that a trader has desided to be confortable with are the strong parts of the strategy. Also your thought proccess and keeping statistics of every TS will help you easy see what are the parts of the strategy that need to be ''fixed''. In my opinion this has to do with the statement you made at #436 post: '' Yet another issue that certainly would arise would be of non triangulated compliance because its difficult to get a TS (only 3 triangulated pairs) that are all in a location that allows all 3 enties to be made at market.'' I'm sure that you have already discover from your tests and statistics that when you enter the market some of the setups are way from the MMP lines and some the orders have to be pending and waiting to be filled,as your last TS with 3 orders waiting,they may be filled in the future which will be good for the strategy,thay may not which is bad for the strategy in a senario that you after 1 win to offset the previous losses or add +4 to already +1 to gain some profits. Anyway i hope you get my point. There were some posters here that do not follow the triangulated pairs and just take random pairs which they have been in the upper or lower bands,reporting some good profits,i do not know if they continue to trade that way to offer some information about the tests to the thread. From your previous tests picking almost random direction for the pairs and mix and match them in multiple ways was profitable so far,that was what intrigued me to read all the way to the end this thread as i was firm believer that no way with this approach you gonna have any positive results.You have proove that this is possible due the strong parts of the strategy. Now i have started also to put some tests for this strategy and see if i can come up with some good results. I'm using your last TS3 pairs from post #377 TS1: EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS2: AUDCAD + EURCAD = EURAUD TS3: GBPCAD + CADCHF = GBPCHF I'm planning also to pick some random pairs that are at the extreme bands and trade them and see what i can come up with. I will pay attention to the daily weekly monthly trend so not to make bad trades as sell at support and such. Thank you for your sharing and time here in the tread. Keep it up!!

Welcome to my M TTT M thread Epsilo I hope you will find the information useful. A very informative post which is appreciated. Test out as many TS Order# setups as you wish and please post results to this thread. Once you decide to start trading them live you'll need to choose your favorite TS Order # (1, 3, 5 etc), start with very low risk (increase it slowly over time as Equity% gain rises) and monitor the results over time making timely changes when required. I look forward to your results and please feel free to link your account to a TE and myfxbook to 'better' track your performance. Good trading, Masterrmind.............

Risk was set low so no major damage done. Take it for what it is (a small learning loss) and move onto the next TS setup. I don't want to put any dampeners on your progress but I do need to be realistic here and from my testing so far I have had 10 losing trades in a row and this has happened twice although not since the SL's were increased from 1*octave to 1.5*octave. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I am confident that over time your Equity will grow nicely. ps. Two of my biggest test pairs EU and GU were both losers this time around as well but the account continues to march forward! pps. I know that my strategy is robust, has a solid RRR and there will be losses along the way but it should do very well over the longer term. Masterrmind...........

I knew that there would be more losers than winners when I started. Hence the small risk %. I am tired and not seeing anything in the charts inspiring right now. Going to rest and will be back 2.5 or so hours past LO. Give the markets time to move around a bit.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
It appears you are planning on trading different TS setups after each one completes. Trading the same TS Order setup at least 3 times would give you a feel for whats working and perhaps what is not working so well. Ofcourse I think it will be an interesting journey choosing different TS Order 1 setups each time so I look forward to your progress. Masterrmind..........

Summary of TS Order 3-#2-S1 (the first setup) TS Order 3-#2-S1 TS1: EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS2: AUDCAD + EURCAD = EURAUD TS3: GBPCAD + CADCHF = GBPCHF 6 trades opened 3 pending orders not triggered Attached Image (click to enlarge) Total setup risk was 9%. 6 trades from 9 triggered and accounting for timing of open trades the realized risk was much lower than the 9% figure. 2 winners @ 4% and 2.9%. 4 losers @ -1%, -1%, -1% and -1%. Net Cycle (Gain/Loss) = ( 4 + 2.9 )% - ( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 )% = 6.9% - 4% = +2.9% (approx). Not an impressive cycle however, the account balance increased and now stands at $13 381.86. +33.8% gain on the account. Masterrmind............

Direction of each pair in the next scenario are as follows: TS Order 3-#2-S2 TS1: EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS2: AUDCAD + EURCAD = EURAUD TS3: GBPCAD + CADCHF = GBPCHF Risk per Trade set @ 1.2% (assumed max risk for this TS Order 3 is approximately 10.8%) SL set at 1.5*Octave Gap On each successive net positive cycle gain risk may be increased by a factor of +0.2 up to a maximum of 2% per trade. Should a cycle return a negative net gain then risk per trade will be dramatically reduced such as 0.8% (1.2% down to 0.8% risk per trade). Other calculations may be taken into account when determining applied risk per trade. Trades will be executed shortly! Masterrmind.............

I had a EURCAD -1,and EURUSD +4 orders which are closed. 3 running right now and 2 pending far from entry which they will not fill and i will kill them. Also tried to enter at the market on CADCHF and the platform didn't let me,i do not know why and now i'm missing another +4 So far a +3 to the account and i will wait until Friday for the opened orders to see how they developed. Next week i will open the next TS3 which you have already run, i'm running after you

Looking at the charts now it appears both those trades may not have faired well. The EU short I took turned into disappointment because it headed out of the gates nicely only to reverse about 30 pips or so from TP. Unfortunately this happens and there will be times when the reverse situation occurs as price misses the stop and runs on to hit TP. Taking the good with the bad is part of the business of trading! The focus should be on longer term outcomes. Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #469 ---
The only time I allow pending orders to sit longer in the market is when at least 1 running trade remains active or if I plan to start the next TS Order setup several days later (for example, its a Thursday or Friday currently and I want to start the next TS on the following Monday or Tuesday). Keep a watch over the spead and how it might impact on your trades ... clearly entries at NY session close or high impact news (*spread* widening events) should be avoided although in other cases where a brokerage firm typically has a large spread on an exotic pair then this may not necessarily play havoc on your trades progress, for one thing typical TPs are rather long in the MTTTM strategy such as 40 pips to 180 pips but if we were scalping for a few pips then ofcourse the situation would be very different. We do not scalp for pips in the MTTTM strategy so in general slightly wider *spread(s)* are NOT such a big issue but certainly need monitoring. I look forward to seeing some posted charts of TS cycles you have taken or ones you are about to take. Masterrmind.............

TS Order 3-#2-S3 Same pairs will be traded in this TS Order 3 setup however directions may vary. Correlation data for monthly, weekly and daily (myfxbook) Monthly Attached Image (click to enlarge) Weekly Attached Image (click to enlarge) Daily Attached Image (click to enlarge) Use the 3 charts to form an opinion on which pairs are more closely correlated (positive or negative). Trading an M15 chart might be intraday trading to some but consider average trade duration, SL and TP distances and how correlation relates. Weighting of currencies and directions need to be considered. Although all these factors are considered the market can still whip around and take out the stops so all we can do is make the best choices from the available information and manage the risk. Observation of each pairs current price with respect to the MML Grid levels will be considered for the final choice of direction of each of the 9 pairs. The plan will be to trade this TS Order 3 right through to the end of the week and then close it out if the cycle of trades are in net profit. This is so that end of month data analysis is cleaner (no open trades in progress). Final choice will be shown in the next post! Masterrmind............

Risk per Trade = 1.4% SL = 1.5*Octave Gap If this TS Order setup yields a net positive outcome then Risk per Trade on the next TS Order 3 will increase to 1.6%.

Hello, Thank you for your comments. I find why i cannot open positions at the market,the account has a 1:50 leverage,so i was trying to open positions beyond that,my bad.Actually i have started a new TS3,same as your last one today,and then i realise that with the leverage. Next time i will reduse single position at 0,5% or 0,2% and i will be fine,nice opportunity to treate this demo account as a live one . i have opened also a MyFXbook account to track performance too https://www.myfxbook.com/portfolio/ts3-test/2469605 up until now 2 losses and 2 opened positions slight in profit. To be continued...

--- 帖子 #486 ---
From my first TS3 8 of 9 have hit SL, last order hovering around BE, meaning a net loss for this order no matter what. Will probably close this last one just so that I can open a new TS3. (Please ignore the couple of trades at the start of the graph Attached Image (click to enlarge) ) Masterrmind, would you mind explaining a bit what you look for in correlations and how it helps choose the order? Do you choose closely/inversely correlated pairs and trade them opposite/same direction? Also do you think for the next month's indicator you change the notification about expiry to be in the log instead? Or perhaps as text on the chart? It pops up every time I change an instrument, which when flipping between 9 charts multiple times can get a bit annoying

--- 帖子 #487 ---

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Keep the risk low, observe some of the setups I take and think of this as longer term outcome. Yes I'll modify the alert so it is minimized in the next version of the indicator. In a future post I will outline how I apply correlation and MML Grid criteria to the final choice of pair direction in a TS Order setup. There are many ways to do this but eventually a trader will need to decide which approach he/she prefers and then use it or modify it as the need arises, if in fact it needs modifying as it very well may not.

Pair Direction Criteria (PDC) Ultimately PDC is at the discretion of the individual trader and the methods that are applied. I will outline some examples of how the choice of direction can be decided in a TS Order 3 setup but there are many more. Example 1: Lets use the current TS Order 3-#2-S3 as our first example. TS Order 3-#2-S3 TS 1 , TS 2 and TS 3 triangulated pairings have already been chosen and I have outlined this procedure in previous posts. TS 1 : EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 2 : AUDCAD + EURCAD = EURAUD TS 3 : GBPCAD + CADCHF = GBPCHF Next step is to choose a pair direction for each of the 9 pairs (EURUSD ... GBPCHF). Method I applied for this current TS Order 3-#2-S3 setup: a) Pair Correlation Tables (daily, weekly and monthly) The focus was on the weekly correlation table with additional reference to both the daily and monthly correlation tables. Starting at the top row (or left column) select the maximum positive and maximum negative correlation values for all rows (or columns). Like so, My bias is towards the weekly correlation table simply because my trades on average remain open for 44 hours (almost 2 days). Attached Image (click to enlarge) Now its clear to see which pairs move in the same basic direction as other pairs and which pairs move in the opposite directions. This information may be used to determine whether or not 2 pairs in a TS such as TS1 will be traded in the same or opposite directions. b) MML Grid reference The MML Grid [M15; P=64, MMP=60 and StepBack=0] of each pair is then used to find which pair from each TS group is the 'better' choice for a given direction. The most positively correlated pair within the TS1 grouping for example, would then be traded in the opposite direction. Similarly, this procedure is applied across all TS's so in a TS Order 3 (TS 1 , TS 2 and TS 3 ) we have now the directions of 6 pairs out of 9 pairs Like so, TS 1 : EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 2 : AUDCAD + EURCAD = EURAUD TS 3 : GBPCAD + CADCHF = GBPCHF Now we need to determine the directions of the remaining 3 pairs namely; EURGBP, AUDCAD and CADCHF. By referring back to the correlation tables we note that EGbp more closely follows EUsd therefore we choose the long direction. By referring back to the correlation tables we note that ACad more closely follows ECad therefore we choose the short direction. By referring back to the correlation tables we note that CChf more closely follows GChf therefore we choose the long direction. Note: sometimes the choice is not straightforward and when this is the case always refer to the pairs MML Grid and make the 'best' choice. The final pair directions using this approach are as follows: TS 1 : EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS 2 : AUDCAD + EURCAD = EURAUD TS 3 : GBPCAD + CADCHF = GBPCHF It is very important to realize that only a basic approach has been used here to determine pair directions within a triangulated set over a TS Order 3. Using such an approach (or any other approach) cannot gurantee success in a trade(s) outcome in the market. Example 2: Another way to choose pair directions is purely selecting pairs which are currently trading in or close to the extreme MML zones. Upper MML zone is in the range 8/8 MML to +2/8 MML Lower MML zone is in the range 0/8 MML to -2/8 MML. In other words a triangulated configuration may not be possible or is at least very difficult to achieve. In this situation you must be aware of all the currency weightings and their directions otherwise being overweight a currency adds to account risk. Example 3: Use higher time frame charts such as H4 or D1 using MML settings of P=64. Pair direction may be chosen based on the price action (PA) on a HTF chart. A long direction may be chosen after observing price bouncing off a solid level of support. Attached Image (click to enlarge) A short direction may be chosen after observing price bouncing off a solid level of resistance. Attached Image (click to enlarge) This requires paitence and continually monitoring where price is within the HTF chart in order to setup an M15 trade. It can be frustrating searching for multiple setups which also align on the M15 chart based on TS Order size or total pair count. End of Examples Higher Time Frame MTTTM Strategy I am yet to start trading the MTTTM strategy on higher time frames. HTF MTTTM trading opens up a whole world of opportunities especially since octaves are typically much larger, so stops are much wider, allowing for greater trade durations and the possibility to ride out any 'minor' sentimental pullbacks against positions. One drawback to this HTF MTTTM approach is the need for a larger account balance since the stops are much larger. A trader only needs to look at the typical octave gaps on say a D1 chart using P=64 (note that H1 and H4 apply different settings). I may post a simple formula or a table showing the typical account balance size required to trade a H1, H4 or D1 TF using a variation of SLs (SLs ranging between 1 and 2 times the octave gap. Smaller funded accounts should consider lower order TS setups on lower TFs such as M15, grow the account before moving onto HTF's. Large funded accounts (as always) have a multitude of options available and may trade any number of MTTTM TF strategies if desired. I will cover the larger funded accounts in the not too distant future however, the M15 TF approach is still a ways to go before it is completed. All in good time. Masterrmind............

Great to see input into the management of trades and taking responsibility for your actions. On a live account you have to make adjustments at times, even though the idea here is to allow trades to run their course there is no point doing so IF its very clear that the account will likely fair better if some trades are closed out or other trades are modified. Trader discretion is a difficult beast to master! Masterrmind............

Ideally what you might be wanting to look for in a setup is confluence across a range of factors. For example, completion of a bearish Gartley in the upper MML extreme zone just under a big psychological number and monthly resistance. Ofcourse bullish harmonic setups would also work but from the lower extreme MML zone. Other useful harmonic patterns are the bat, butterfly, shark and simpler ones such as ABCD and AB=CD. The ABCD pattern is simple to apply and highly effective in all TFs as 1 to 1 completions occur across a variety of symbols and TFs all the time. Harmonic setups in these confluent zones are the cream of the crop but occur far less frequently than ABCD completions. This is the main reason why I use ABCD pattern and awareness of the 127.2 potential exhaustion levels in price movement for reversal setups. Masterrmind............

Nice result Platanero. As a series of trades complete over several TS Order setups I'm seeing that an Equity% closure value might be useful. Obtaining a suitable Equity% closure value is the only hurdle. There are positive and negative implications of applying an Equity% close on a set of trades. For one thing the longer term expectancy of the system is being attacked as several trades will not be allowed to reach full TP (trades cut short). If the Equity% closure value is set too low then its possible that some trades may not be given the opportunity to hit the market or hit TP. On a positive note it does lock in realized profit then and there! I may spend some time analyzing an Equity% closure approach and see if there is any clear advantage. I have already noticed several opportunities to close with rather nice Equity% gain for example the current TS Order 3-#2-S3 offered an opportunity to close at least 7% gain in equity (clearly evident at the time on the Info_Panel-MTTTM indicator. This would initially be based on a trade sample size of 85 already generated from the current demo account. Posts will follow with additional information once some Equity% closure analysis has been conducted. Masterrmind............

The following chart shows the Floating P&amp;L (hourly) Versus Time (Source: FXBlue) for the currently traded demo account (MTTTM-Test 1). Attached Image (click to enlarge) At least it provides some basic information. An expectation could be formed here allowing an Equity% closure value to be compared with historical trading results. It should be noted that a 'better' chart would be one in which the instantaneous P&amp;L (%) Vs Time is used and selecting individual TS Order 3 cycles. However, this is not currently available so all we have is a rough approxiamation approach. From an instantaneous P&amp;L Plot of the available account data I would then slice this into dt (delta time) sections for each completed TS Order 3. It would then be simple enough to compare the cycle Equity% gain to the potential Equity% gain shown on the Equity curve at the time. From each TS Order 3 sectioned area it would be possible to determine the minimum Equity, maximum Equity and the average Equity as a %. Then a simple matter of assigning an average expected Equity% gain . As the sample size continues to grow additional sectioned-off TS Order 3 zones could be further analyzed and then modifications to the assigned average Equity%gain made if deemed necessary, basically a dynamic process which could be controlled by an Expert Advisor or a specially designed Equity analysis plug-in. I'm only after an approximate value at this stage so I will work with the hourly data knwoing full well its limitations including the very real possibility that Equity jumps can be significant within a 1 hour time frame in the FX market. Therefore, I will determine on an Equity curve (hourly period data) only the potential maximum Equity% gain per completed TS Order 3 cycle over all completed cycles and suggest a simple average of these maximas. By observing the gaps between the Balance and Equity lines on the Equity Chart it becomes obvious that as trades close out for profit or loss a closure at a maximum Balance to Equity gap may not provide the best outcome. Equity Charts (Hourly data) TS Order 3 setups: 1st &amp; 2nd Attached Image (click to enlarge) 3rd &amp; 4th Attached Image (click to enlarge) 5th, 6th &amp; 7th Attached Image (click to enlarge) 8th, 9th &amp; 10th Attached Image (click to enlarge) 11th (not yet completed; 2 trades still running) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Note: there are some errors in the plotted Equity curves particularly in the minimum Equity levels. Sum of 11 maxima Gaps = 77.5% TS Order 3 cycle count = 11 Average maxima gap = 77.5/11 = 7%. Now lets look at the maximum possible equity and Equity at TS Cycle Close (per hourly data chart) over all TS Order 3 completions. = TS . Equity(max).. Equity (close) .. Gain% ... 0 - $10000.00 ...... $10000.00 ....

But is there enough information presented to make an informed decision about whether to use an Equity% close feature in the cycles or not? Would an Equity% take profit be any better than simply trading the TS Order 3 setups through to completion as they are currently being traded? Comments are welcome? Masterrmind.............

Global equity closure is good, iff we determine the minimum number of positions to use to calculate it. Given the high ratio of pending orders I see in most TS setups, it's good to use a minimum amount positions to get a good calculation of "basket" equity closure. Increasing market orders may also increase these positions

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Interesting stats here Mastermind. In my opinion using Equity% take profit maybe has a better equity curve in the long run instead of the normal TS3 setups. I personally do not going to follow it as it needs more babysitting on trades,time i don't have right now.I like the set and 'forget' approach of the current system as been traded with minimal time spend on the platform and with the orders,not in the selection of the pairs as this can been done usually during weekend. Also with the Equity% approach we kind of cancel one of the powers of the system 4 to 1 win loss ratio and in bad times it will take more time and efford to recover serial of losses. Just my opinion...

Yes global equity closure can certainly be used. However, a dilemma is presented here since we do not know in advance how many orders will actually hit the market. Although we do have some idea of the likely orders hitting the market and I would say that 6-7 trades are typically opened on a TS Order 3. If I introduce the Dynamic Feed Approach (DFA) which involves slotting in an appropriate new trade (either @ market or pending order) as soon as a trade completes then this adds a twist. How might DFA alter things? Masterrmind.............

Once Equity closures are introduced then its ideal to use a Trailing EA or other trade software to manage the account (Trader as responsible manager). The set and forget approach is at the core of the basic version of the MTTTM strategy and it prevails well in the market because of its setup characteristics, the strong reward to risk ratio and the trade confines within the MML Grid, and simply allowing trades to play out as much as possible, the spreading of risk between several triangualated pairs and a minimal number of TPs required to create a net positive cycle. I agree with your comments and feel that the key characteristics of the system should not be disregarded too much or there is a real danger of damaging the expectancy in which case the longer term outcome might also suffer in terms of the Return on Account figures. This is the case for the basic version of the MTTTM strategy ... set&amp;forget methodology (a trade probability play). The advanced versions (outlined at a later time, well then they are rather unique). Masterrmind...............

Even when using a SL of 1.5*OctaveGap an Octive of say 7.6 pips doesn't really provide enough room for the trade to breathe.

Hello Masterrmind, I check the last trades you have placed and i think you have wrong stop calculation placed in CADCHF and GBPCHF, BOTH are less than an octave or they changed in the last couple of hours based on the screenshoots you post?? Also CADCHF was sell but between 1/8 and 2/8?? Take profit way out of octaves?

--- 帖子 #553 ---
All entries were correct at the time of setup. In fact I made an entry on the CADCHF pair (larger Octave Gap) only to see a sudden reduction so I closed out the entry (shown below) and placed another order applying the updated Octave Gap. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The octave also changed for the EURCAD pending order so I deleted it out and applied another pending order based on the updated MML Grid data. In MML setups using the lower TF's the Octave Gaps will update at a much greater frequency than the HTF's (its calculation based afterall). Typical Octive Gaps (others do exist) on pairs traded are 7.6 pips, 15.3 pips, 30.5 pips and 61 pips for an M15 P=64, MMPeriod=60 and StepBack=0 setup. On the next TS Order 3 setup I will post screenshots of all pairs initially, after the trades complete and include the before and after terminal entries. Thanks for going through the setups and offering your comments. ps. this was one of the fastest 6 trade losses (about a 4 hour period) in a TS Order 3 to date however there is 1 trade still running and 2 pending orders so final results may differ and be better or worse. pps. something worth considering is applying a larger minimum Octave Gap such as 30.5 pips (SL @ 1.5*Octave Gap is just over 45 pips) but ofcourse the TP also gets pushed much further out so it becomes a case of having to make a choice between too small or too large of a stop. ppps. to an alert trader they should be able to very quickly identify a key observation as to the rapid losses .... hint: When were the trades entered?

Summary of TS Order 3-#2-S5 (the 5th setup) TS Order 3-#2-S5 TS1: EURUSD + GBPUSD = EURGBP TS2: AUDCAD + EURCAD = EURAUD TS3: GBPCAD + CADCHF = GBPCHF 8 trades opened 1 pending order [EURCAD] remains active (BUT NOT triggered) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Updated information shows the final completed trade: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Total setup risk was 10.8% (1.2% risk per trade over a possible 9 entries) . 9 trades from 9 triggered so all risk in play. 0 winners @ 0%. 9 losers @ -1.3%, -1.3%, -1.3%, -1.3%, -1.2%, -1.2%, -1.3%, -1.2 and -1.2%. Net Cycle (Gain/Loss) = ( 0.0 )% - ( 1.3 + 1.3 + 1.3 + 1.3 + 1.2 + 1.2+ 1.3 + 1.2 + 1.2 )% = 0.0% - 11.3% = -11.3% (approx). Note that the total assigned loss should have been close to 10.8% (1.2% per trade * 9 trades) but an excess of about 1/2% occurred. A net losing cycle of -US$ 1435.59 causes the account balance to decrease which now stands at $11 613.95. +16.1% gain on the account. ps. This post was updated (edited) to reflect the completion of the final trade (EURCAD). Masterrmind............

Risk per Trade On successful completion ( net positive ) of a TS Order 3 the Risk per Trade increases by 0.2% up to a currently assigned maximum of 2% per trade. Example 1: Winning Net positive TS Order 3 start 1%, win 1.2%, win 1.4%, win 1.6%, win 1.8%, win 2.0%, win 2.0% ...... max 2% risk per trade. On unsuccessful completion ( net negative ) of a TS Order 3 the Risk per Trade decreases by 0.4% (lower than 0.4% the risk will continue to halve) Example 2: Losing Net negative TS Order 3 start at 1%, loss 0.6%, loss 0.2%, loss 0.1%, loss 0.05%, ..... until risk per trade and minimum broker lot size align. Example 3: Random outcomes on a TS Order 3 cycle of trades showing dynamic Risk per Trade. Assigned Max_RiskperTrade = 2% win_step = 0.2% loss_step = 0.4% Start @ 1% risk per trade Cycle 1: Winning cycle, next is 1.0% + win_step = 1.2% risk per trade Cycle 2: Winning cycle, next is 1.2% + win_step = 1.6% risk per trade Cycle 3: Winning cycle, next is 1.6% + win_step = 1.8% risk per trade Cycle 4: Winning cycle, next is 1.8% + win_step = 2.0% risk per trade [Max Risk per Trade] Cycle 5: Winning cycle, next is 2.0% + N/A ....... = 2.0% risk per trade [Max Risk per Trade] Cycle 6: Winning cycle, next is 2.0% + N/A ....... = 2.0% risk per trade [Max Risk per Trade] Cycle 7: Losing cycle, next is 2.0% - loss_step = 1.6% risk per trade Cycle 8: Losing cycle, next is 1.6% - loss_step = 1.2% risk per trade Cycle 9: Winning cycle, next is 1.2% + win_step = 1.4% risk per trade Cycle 10: Losing cycle, next is 1.4% - loss_step = 1.0% risk per trade Cycle 11: Losing cycle, next is 1.0% - loss_step = 0.6% risk per trade Cycle 12: Winning cycle, next is 0.6% + win_step = 0.8% risk per trade Cycle 13: Winning cycle, next is 0.8% + win_step = 1.0% risk per trade Cycle 14: Losing cycle, next is 1.0% - loss_step = 0.6% risk per trade Cycle 15: Winning cycle, next is 0.6% + win_step = 0.8% risk per trade Cycle 16: Winning cycle, next is 0.8% + win_step = 1.0% risk per trade Note 1: The 16 cycles represent a simple flow of assigning the next risk per trade value for various outcomes, the reality may be very different! Note 2: Other advanced risk per trade values can be determined using Equity Curve Trace Management techniques (perhaps outlined much later). Masterrmind...........

--- 帖子 #559 ---
I am of the opinion that taking trades closer to the extreme zones on MML Grids is a reasonable approach. If price takes you out then its only a small relative loss compared to the TP pips on offer should price run in your favor and move to the opposite extreme zone. Typically the MML trading range is between 0/8 and 8/8 with the 2 additional octives top and bottom to complete a 12 octave range. The battle is having price continue to the target before news and other factors reverse the trades progress. Never a dull moment in this business. Masterrmind............

Post 1 spells out what information is acceptable and what is not. I notice you stubbornly rejected my request ( Post # 596 ) to delete your Post #595 !! I will give you 2 more days in which to provide an apology posted to this thread. Failing that I see no choice other than to sit you on the side lines for some considerable length of time. I trust you will make the right decision. Good trading, Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #602 ---
a) I am not 24/24 connected on FX and on this thread b) I had not seen your previous "request" c) I do not care about what you like or not and about your "threats". I do not submit to "threats" d) I do not know if I am "stubborn" or not. It is very possible. But I am almost 100 % certain you are. e) Why ? Because Gann told us we have to use together the Vertical Lines, the Diagonal Lines and the Horizontal Lines. Gann told us too that the Horizontal Lines are the least efficient. That is the one Murrey use with its so-called MML's. Murrey theoretically showed us the "Speed Angles"(Diagonal Lines) but nobody, you included , uses them. Murrey shows us a sub-product of the Vertical Lines with the Circles of Conflict, but nobody uses them (me included anyway not for trading uses) As for MA's you do not like . It is your right. Anyway the 3 MA's used are closely related to the Gann (Murrey) Octave Methodology because the Amplitude of the Envelope 256 Time Units is equal to One Operative Octave (your Octave Gap) and the Amplitude of the Envelope 128 and 32 Time Units are subharmonics (successive division by 2 ) of the said Octave. The Methodology is strictly the same for Horizontal Lines, Vertical Lines, Diagonal Lines and Curved Lines. Evey kind of "Lines" has its interest for Analysis and / or Trading. The combination of ALL lines is very powerful. It is always better to walk with 2 legs. Generally I do not participate on threads, whatever the subject, beginning by a serie of "interdictions" whatever they are because it is not my conception of a forum and of a thread. I made an exception for your thread because it is one of the rare one elaborating something which could reveal itself of interest concerning "trading with Murrey" which I use since 1998

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Allow me to respond to your post, after which I will address the 'stubborness' in your failure to remove an unwanted post. 1. Read this thread before you interact (or post unwanted and unnecessary material) as it makes sense to do so since its both logical and polite. 2. My intention with the MTTTM system is to 'dumb it down' somewhat and focus mainly on the MML levels as calculated by the MML indicator. Post 1 does a reasonable enough job of outlining the MTTTM trading strategy and how it is to be applied namely as a simple enough method that any person can trade. Keeping things simple was my plan in teaching the method here not to get involved in a full on Gann and Murrey discussion. 3. I am more than qualified to engage in a deep debate about Gann trading methodologies but less so with Murrey although I understand his methods quite extensively but must say that I am more of a Gann trader (although I have modernised the approach considerably) than a Murrey trader whether you see them as similar or not, I do not! If I were to engage in a Gann discussion I would open it in the trading discussion section and not in the trading system section. 4. Gann trading is far more discretionary whilst the MTTTM approach is far more mechanical in its application (at least thus far) as this makes it easier to apply for newer and intermediate traders alike. 5. There was no initial plan to address the Gann concepts in such a basic trading system here as its highly complex and takes years to understand. 6. I certainly do use Gann angles in my own private trading (have done for decades) among many other trading factors so you are not telling me anything new. 7. Since most traders here use the MT4 platform it was pointless teaching traders about Gann angles. The MT4 platform is not the right drawing platform to produce 'reasonably accurate' angles of price in time. It is far too inaccurate in its standard format. 8. Yes Gann outlines the VHD lines but yet you choose to add in MA's with pointless significance (your choice but wrong direction IMHO). 9. Murrey on the other hand introduced a 'magical' start date for the trading frame which is a mystery to everyone every year except Murrey. Quite a joke in my opinion and arguably a tactic for maintaining some commercial leverage (if you don't pay the bucks to upgrade the Murrey software each year you don't get the 'magical' new start date). 10. I do not apply the Murrey trading method here nor shall I ever nor would I want too as it is full of holes. I use the 13 horizontal lines as calculated by the MML indicator available via Post 1 and that is all (certainly no useless lagging MA's applied). The rest is a combination of spreading the risk over multiple triangulated pairs and applying a strict Reward to Risk ratio of 4 to 1, a SL in the range [ 1 &lt;= SL &lt;= 2 octaves ] and some solid trade and risk management techniques and a few other techniques. Now onto the more pressing issue: At least you made an effort to post here but no apology so that's very disappointing. A thread Op on FF may set guidelines and rules as I have done. Post 1 clearly outlines the rules at the top of that post and new comers to a thread typically (and should always) at least read Post 1 in its entirety. You clearly did not because if you did you would have noticed that several indicators are banned , one of which is the MA . Your chart is full of 'confusing' and irrelevant MAs all over the place and your 'angles' are likely to be completely wrong . I asked you very politely to remove your post but you refused. That is your choice. Nevertheless, I now view your intent as disruptive to the smooth flowing content of this thread and will ban you from taking any further part in any of my threads. I do not intend to persue you any further since clearly you do not understand the very basics of common courtesy. "parisboy !" ............ enjoy your time on the sidelines. Attached Image ps. If you asked me to delete a post from your thread you would see a very prompt response on my part and a rapid post removal. Masterrmind............

The Lot_Size-MTTTM indicator has had a few minor additions coded in namely the choice of color for the Octive Gap which makes awareness slightly better because now both Octive Gaps can be compared on the 2 indicators. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I have coded in multiple functionality to the Murrey_Math1-MTTTM indicator. Several new parameters allow the following adjustments: 1. MML horizontal lines made adjustable so the start and end times can be easily modified; 2. MML Vertical line with multiple options (color, size, style and extended) that caps off the end of the preferred MML Grid (far left side). 3. Turning on full length lines or shortening them as desired; 4. Showing full MML line text or a "mini" version -2/8 through to +2/8 with no added text with the option to turn it on or turn it off; 5. Functionality to shift the MML line text in the horizontal direction; Attached Image (click to enlarge) Any bugs let me know. Although its possible that the indicators in MT4 will continue to have minor adjustments and fixes coded in, I must say that my main focus is on coding up a full MT5 indicator set including an MT5 EA (currently well under way) for the MTTTM trading system. Plenty more to come in the near future ! Masterrmind............

Mastermind we can more than take a look ! Right now I will put aside Hurst Cycles Model and its derivated Phasing Analysis and other useful concepts as Underlying Trendline I will just underlined Hurst tools - Centered Moving Averages Crossings which allows to calculate a Price target Zone Up or Down - and confirm previous Low or Top in a trend - Future Line of Demarcation (FLD) which the projection of current price in the future of 1/2 period of an identified cycle within Price Action - Valid Trend Line which is drawn between 2 Tops or 2 Lows of the same Cycle. When a VTL is broken this generates an "Action Signal" to buy or sell First Hurst tool was Hurst Bands or Dominancy Envelopes

Any 'reasonable' trading system can turn a profit but the issue is maintaining net positive consistency over the 'longer term'. Consistency requires an intelligent and highly focussed individual. Patience is where most traders fail, not just once either, over and over again. I only trade the D1 timeframe in the Quad Candle System, it is the most stable. The time frame traded has plenty to do with risk per trade (over all trades), the stop size and the amount of Account Equity. As the TF increases for the same values assigned to the key parameters on the QCS Method typically the higher the SL (1 to 2 octives). So on a smaller account size it may not make any sense to take on a D1 TF. This is one of the few reasons why I would then perhaps suggest that a lower TF (H4/H1) be traded. With that lowering of TF comes an increase in risk and potentially a loss of consistency (trader dependent to an extent). Sounds like it is working out for you. Good trading, Masterrmind............

Just been thinking about a Price Action Trade Frame ?

--- 帖子 #674 ---
OAPDave according to the methodology I use the "correct" Octave (your Octave Gap) for the GBPUSD on a Timefrme of 24 Hours expressed in 1 mn is 0,003125 and its sub-harmonics 0,0015625 and 0,00078125

--- 帖子 #675 ---
On a 5 Days / 5 minutes timeframe, you just have to DOUBLE the parameters Then your Octave Gap = 0,00625 (and subharmonics)

--- 帖子 #676 ---
Hi, my friend I very much respect your skill as a trader and i would really like to understand more about your style, the problem i have and its my problem not yours is that you use Tradeview and i use Mt4 which as its limitations to reproduce your charts, because you show a fair bit of data in you screen shots i find it hard to see the detail to right of the chart, so it becomes difficult to see your entries exits and stops, Right or wrong i have been bought up on Pivots and in recent years a switch to Murrey i have soldiered on trying to make heads and tails form his ideas much like trying to understand Gann sometimes i get a few things right then sometimes the same thing goes pear shaped and yes it does frustrate me, but at least it makes me think, If i am honest to me this game is just about Momentum recognise it and just go with it, all these lines and levels are put there by the Brokers just to trap us, another thing because of all the new trading rules that we are going to have to abide by I have lost a lot of interest now, just going to be very expensive to play the game and I do have a little knowledge of other forms of fun were the cost to play is far less

--- 帖子 #677 ---
0APDave, You should not focus on details but on the process itself The methodology is NOT to reproduce exactly my charts but - to build Enveloppes - most preferably based on Centered Averages and with Amplitudes using the Octave Gap and its subharmonics - using 3 Envelopes with period of 256, 128 and 32 Time Units which generate a very robust and efficient system - to use the Upper and Lower Limit of the Envelope 256 TU as MML's(0/8) and (8/8) and the Centered Moving Average 256 TU as being MML (4/8) - same function Major Support &amp; Resistance / Center of Gravity - to position your stops slightly under the last Low or above the Last Top (according to Trend) OR using the Octave Gap of the Envelope 32 TU

--- 帖子 #678 ---
Yes i understand all that, indeed you have given me a pat on the back in the past when i have shown my efforts to do so, my problem, is it worth my time to under take another learning and practising method when if you see my posts 664 &amp; 666 are looming, and i am not standing for those rules !

Yes I view it the same way hence my aggressive stance when I first saw parisboys charts. I guess I still frown at them but I'm prepared to give him a little room to breathe. Why ?

GBPUSD 1 Month / 30 mn with MML's Octave Gap is 1,440 - 1,340 = 0,100 /8 = 0,0125

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Looks good to me examples Big Time Chart From last Months Candle From Last Weeks Candle From Yesterdays Candle Only problem i see, is take the Monthly when it goes through the OB/OS and that means it would fall into another Octave, what to do ? drop down to the Weekly or Daily or may be have the option for having a double Octave.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
OAPDave every body can notice that the "operative" Price Range of GBPUSD on a Long Term basis - here 1994 / 2018 - is 1 = 2,20 - 1,20 The Vibration / Octave is 1 /8 = 0,125 Therefore whatever Time Unit you use the operative sub-octave are : 0,0625 0,03125 0,015625 0,0078125 0,00390625 0,001953125 etc

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Masterrmind Trade Logic at first sight would have been a short position a) Enveloppe 256 TU (brown) and 32 TU (blue) are Down b) Stop Loss would have been slightly above the Centered Moving Average 256 TU (Brown) acting as a strong Resistance c) First target the Lower Limit of the Envelope 128 TU (ocre) d) Then optionally Second Target the Lower Limit of the Envelope 256 TU (brown) But before acting I would have checked : - The 5 Days / 5 mn Envelopes situation - The Centered Moving Averages crossings chart - The FLD chart Hurst asks us to use all cyclic tools together

--- 帖子 #688 ---
It really does depend on which way you want to play it. From an MML (indicator) logic point of view it may very well suggest that once a new Grid appears then base trading decisions on those levels for the applicable TF of the chart. Or it might mean using the MML lines that were in place at the time of trade execution through to completion. Decisions that only the trader can make. No matter the re-adjustment of MML lines it is always possible to apply the MML-Fibs across any octive no matter if the change creates an octive increase or decrease it matters not. What matters is your own peronal trading methodologies based in and around price being in a certain cluster of MMLs on a given TF. We have the MML tools now as well as the ability to modify, change or enhance them to our desire. You may well have to plan out your own trading methodology and apply the tools in any fashion that suits that plan. We have a huge margin for flexibility so any methodology you think up most likely we can provide the right tool. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ There are several steps involved in the trading methodology approach some of which include: 1. Design a methodology around certain events (MML line #, MML combos, price wrt MML's, SL pips, reward to risk ratio etc etc) 2. Apply a raw first pass on several charts over several periods of data (typically shorter periods depending on complexity of the system) 3. Analyze several outcomes and form a statistical opinion (still in a raw form) likely win rate/likely losing rate, just a general idea 4. Change some of the 'key' parameters and make some raw observations. OR 5. Code your methodology into C++ for MT4/5 testing AND potentially future trading 6. Once the Expert Advisor and any relevant indicators are coded and bug free move to the next stage 7. Test your methodology over short, medium and longer term data periods (eg 1 to 3 months, 3 months to a year, and 1 to 5 to 10 years or more data. Stagger the start dates for eg test it from 2014 to 2017, 2005 to 2018, over a known highly volatile period 2007/8 etc etc 8. Testing like this is to determine the robustness of the methodology 9. It takes time to eventually form an opinion of whether or not the methodolgy 'might' work in the market 10. Then forward trst it on a demo (if preferred for as long as you are able), then a small live account (if the methodolgy suits a small account) and then forward test it on an appropriately funded live account. Tweak it here and there as necessary and be sure to provide a solid set of risk control parameters. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ I know you are perhaps more inclined to go the manual route and that is perfectly ok but you will have a hard time testing your strategy over multiple data sets. This too may not concern you. No matter the data tests being used, on a live market it may still fail but you won't know until you try it. I could have used the EA testing approach with the MTTTM system (who is to say I have not !). I also know that far too many 'traders' on these forums simply want a fast and quick approach to 'trading' by plugging in an EA and 'hoping' it makes them a million dollars. If an EA is provided straight up they will mostly skip all the rational of the trading method and start playing with their brand new toy (EA). In any case I am more inclined to take a manual trading approach although as the MTTTM strategy becomes far more complex and multiple pending orders need to be applied it makes logical sense to use an EA or at least a script to assist the trader in performing some of the repetitive tasks.

Masterrmind must say a big thank you for the new toy, its already showed me a mistake in my thought process on how i viewed Octave acceptance down at lower timeframes i have enclosed the 7 screenshots of the Murrey Octave numbers and yes for obvious reason's some are the same but look carefully down at the 4 8 16 these are a copy from my Murrey EOD Think Chart Shift Plus Xard's Toy ?

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Masterrmind as you have shown interest on Hurst Cycles, I assume you have also some interests in how to use Hurst tools in trading. Following your request on "my trading logic on the red zone" I kept a loose eye on GBPUSD and trade it using the Future Line of Demarcation tool which is developed at length by Hurst in its Cyclitec Course (1975) Basically a Future Line of Demarcation (FLD) is the projection of Price Action in the Future of 1/2 period of a relevant cycle. This way when Price Action breaks the FLD you can define a Target for Price Here for GBPUSD you note : a) a Low (in red) at 1,34716 b) Price Action breaks the FLD 256 TU (in brown) at 1,34900 this way you can calculate a Target for Price : From the Low 1,34716 Price movement would be : 2 x (1,34900 - 1,34716) +/- 10 % 2 x 0,00184 +/- 10 % 0,00368 +/-0,00037 Therefore you get a PTZ (Potential Target Zone) defined by : a) an Upper Limit = 1,34716 + 0,00368 + 0,00037 = 1,35121 b) a Lower Limit = 1,34716 + 0,00368 - 0,00037 = 1,35047 c) a Center of Gravity = 1,34716 + 0,00368 = 1,35084 Following this calculation and in spite of the fact I was not before my screen at the time of the Break, I made a late Entry at 1,34981 and sold at 1,35045 near the Lower Limit to protect profit

--- 帖子 #692 ---
Masterrmind, In the same way you can use Centered Moving Averages crossings When multiple Centered Moving Averages meet Price and cross in the same area , they build what Jim Tillmann called a Focal Point or Node. Roughly this node is located at the half / middle of the Price Movement either UP or DOWN. On the chart the Nodes noted 1 to 7 (in green) are here to build your confidence in the system / tool. We had : a Top of GBPUSD at 1,35120 a Node around 1,34920 a Low at 1,34716 as we got a PTZ (Potential Target Zone) between 1,34760 and 1,34680 with a Center of Gravity at 1,34720 and as Price Action formed a Real Low at 1,34716 and we were already UP , I was confident that we already made our last low and that GBPUSD Trend was UP , then I entered at 1,34786 for a profit

--- 帖子 #693 ---
Great posts, i love the way you come to your numbers, now i know you never get anything without a bit of hard work but i am seeing as near to your numbers off a 4 day Murrey, my belief in Murrey is getting stronger now i have better tools to translate it. To me if you have a chart shift down you must Sell any rallies until it fails and you get a chart shift up and then you would Buy the dips, ( were have I heard that before)

--- 帖子 #694 ---
Thanks OAPDave In fact it is very simple you just have to master the multiplication or division by 2 ! Moreover you can notice the big coherence of the system / methodology. a) return to the mean = 1/2 = 50 % retracement = Center of Gravity = Support &amp; Resistance Line is key. b) Octave / Vibration = Price Range / 8 is also key - see my post 686 on GBPUSD Octave / Vibration which covers all about GBPUSD Vibration. c) as many Forex pairs fluctuate in the same Price Range you can use it too. d) the japanese Yen fluctuates in a 100 Range .... which is exactly the same ! You just have to move the decimal on the left 100 / 8 = 12,5 subharmonics are : 6,25 3,125 1,5625 0,78125 0,390625 0,1953125 etc If 100 is a first good approximation of the vibration for the Yen. You can also use 75 to be closer of the reality and stay tuned with real fluctuations. Then Octave Vibration of the Yen = 75 / 8 = 9,375 . according to platform or software specification, this can be rounded to 10 The best way is to check both solutions and see what fits you the best

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Nice work ! You clearly have a plan in place. Do you favor one particular TF over another or focus on just the one ? Masterrmind.............

--- 帖子 #696 ---
Thanks Masterrmind As for a TF it depends on your aim - portfolio management or intraday For intraday I like the 1 mn because you see very quickly the result of your forecasts / anticipations , the patterns etc Any way it is always useful to test ALL tools on ALL Timeframes - it will give you confidence in their efficiency and in your parameters As a plan my best advice is to follow the book - Profit Magic - from Hurst Let aside the Cycle thing to begin. I mean the Phasing Analysis, the Nominal Model Which is directly and quickly operative (with a little work) are a) The Envelopes - Hurst Bands or Dominancy Envelopes . Hurst used them to have a good approximation of Cycles active in Price Action and to visualize Trens on various Time Frame Envelopes underline Tops and Lows of operative Cycles on various Timeframes It is there where I use the Octave and its sub-harmonics b) Centered Moving Averages allow you : - to calculate targets for price - to confirm previous Tops and Lows c) Valid Trend Line (VTL) VTL link Tops or Lows of the same nature, degree , order VTL underline trends of different degrees when broken by Price Action VTL's generate (cyclical) Action Signal to Sell or Buy d) FLD - Future Line of Demarcation a simple tool to build but much more complex to use All Hurst tools need to know which Cycles are operative within Price Action (see Envelopes) The "Model" I use - 256 / 128 / 32 - Murrey based - is very "robust" on all Timeframes and all Financial Support

There is more than 1 road that leads to Rome ... as they say. Unlikely that I would apply crosses of any MAs in my trading. But if they work for you best advise is to keep using what works. Personally, I find PA analysis in alignment with the fundamentals works best for me in my private trading. The great thing about trading is that there is not just 1 method that is the be all and end all, rather there are 1000's. Every trader likes his/her set of trading tools, from my perspective I like the charts as clutter free as possible and minimalistic. Yes I know I have 13 horizontal lines on the chart but they are very simple, evenly spaced and parallel. Thanks for sharing your methodology. Masterrmind...............

GBPAUD [H1; progress update] Almost 500 pips on this short entry. Attached Image (click to enlarge) TP still another 230 odd pips below current price. Price has bounced more than once from the most recent lows just above the 1.75 handle with 'significant time variation' (this is an important concept). Notice how the Octives have reduced in magnitude ! This observation leads to an updating of our initial expectations. So it is logical (now) to consider a reduction in the target and a strategy for reducing the stop loss. Several closing strategies could be applied here such as: (a) wait for price to tag the support once more and if the next H1 bar closes bullish then close the position; (b) wait for price to tag the support once more and if the next H1 bar closes bearish then tighten the stop by half (just above 4/8 MML CP); (c) wait to see the PA closer to London Open and if the Bulls look active close the position, if bearish let it run on until (a) or (b) occurs.

--- 帖子 #719 ---
To be honest my aim is for about 20/30 pips a day but i accept this is perhaps not the cleverest way to trade, if you have had the patience to wait for a good Octave, like today's trade I have a few tough octave levels above me to break through, but with these ESMA new rules and swap charges i am trying to be more accurate with my entry hence start with a decent pip value and be in and out within a % of the daily range, if i get it wrong and take a 1 : 1 loss it does not hurt me much and i just wait until next day, as you say its the compounding that makes money, not to sure if as i say with the new rules adding trades and then waiting for bigger moves will pay off in the long run Here is a base chart for guys with deep pockets 3.125 -0.0 then minor octaves added 1.5625 - 1.17188

Three pending orders remain at this stage with no currently active positions. Attached Image (click to enlarge) If I decide to close out the 3 pending orders the current H1 TS Order 3 cycle will be net negative. Being net negative means the next TS Order 3 will be traded with a Risk per Trade of 0.2% (0.6% -0.4%). So I'm simply buying some time at the moment with leaving the 3 pending orders in place. If price continues to look unlikely to trigger any of the 3 orders over the next few days then they will be deleted out in readiness for the next TS. ps. Although the GBPAUD short was closed out early, price has still not come within 60 pips of the target so at this stage no harm done. Masterrmind.............

--- 帖子 #721 ---
Masterrmind, just to add, the way i look at it now, I do not have to fall in love with a trend because even in a strong trend they will always be re-test's, but i do accept that they are better minor octaves levels to trade than others, hence if i get a day and we break away from a nice octave with a fair amount of daily range left and some room to the more troublesome octaves i will have ago at a bigger R/R

A very sound logical plan. I see nothing wrong with that approach. If you look at this monthly GU chart which I know you have been, a trader needs to look at it very carefully. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The MML octives are the gateway to the mind of the market ! Deciphering the markets intent either 'now', 'tomorrow', or 'next week' is no easy task. ps. Note that I have intentionally left the MML octives off this monthly chart (if nothing jumps out then drop down a few TF's and reassess). pps. If the TF is outside a typical trade setup then drop down to a more suitable and more manageable TF, the monthly is a monster ! Masterrmind.............

Masterrmind GBPUSD obviously fluctuates between 2.15 and 1.15 which means Octave = (2.15- 1.15) = 1/8 = 0,125 and subharmonics 0.0625 / 0.03125 / 0.015625 etc

--- 帖子 #726 ---
Yes close enough to those levels based on the brokers data. The idea should be to work your way down in the octaves starting from a HTF until a more suitable trading range is found and this must also include a preferred octive based on the trading setup. No point having a 244 pip octive on a H1 chart if you plan to be out of the trade on the same day. Using the GBPUSD pair as an example, it is an interesting exercise to apply the MML Indicator (default P=64) on a monthly chart and simply continue to drive lower into smaller octaves. You can simply observe in which half of the MML Grid price is currently and then reduce to say a 0/8 to 4/8 (half range) which now becomes the new 0/8 to 8/8. Eventually a lower TF (perhaps a D1 TF) may be needed but this is based on trader preferences which involve a preferred octive gap in which to trade. Very few traders (if any) open trades from a monthly chart ! The octive gap halves ofcourse as you continue. After several iterations the PA will start to protrude from either the upper or lower MML extremes. If PA is a key consideration in your MML trading method then it makes sense to include as much of the PA within an active MML Grid as possible. To do this you may need to re-align the MML Grid and draw your attention to the most recent swing highs or swing lows. This then has Gann written all over it and one can then ask the question: "Why not simply choose a reasonable and realistic trading range for the 0/8 to 8/8 MML Grid and trade within this zone such that most of the PA is captured within the Grid ?". There are many ways to do this by the way and perhaps several not yet even explored ! ps. if you cannot follow my worded format let me know and I'll post a series of annotated charts that highlight the process. Good trading, Masterrmind..............

Net Cycle (Gain/Loss) = ( 1.6 )% - ( 0.6 + 0.6 + 0.6 + 0.6 + 0.5 + 0.6 +0.6 )% = 1.6% - 4.1% = -2.5% (approx).

MTTTM System Commentary. FXBlue Analytics: Attached Image (click to enlarge) myfxbook summary: Attached Image (click to enlarge) So far 135 trades have been completed with a strike rate of about 29% and a DD of about 21% for a net gain of close to +10.5% over 6 months. 75 lots have been traded for about a 1K profit ! On a live account this outcome would only be making the broker richer and certainly NOT the trader. Average win to average loss ratio is very respectable, so too the Profit Factor (1.09) and so it should be with a fixed 4 to 1 RRR. AHPR sits at 0.09% which suggests that a win will yield about a 0.09% gain on average, only problem is that there are not enough winners at present if one considers a 29% win rate. Sharp ratio at 0.04 is horrendous ! Any valuable clues in the following sea of red ! Attached Image (click to enlarge) I can say one thing about account progress so far and that is this: The method is not producing realistic results that could currently be traded on a real account. Sure a 10% gain in Equity (if it was live) is fine over a 6 month term with some decent invested capital but at what risk ! So what improvements can be made that are likely to produce better results ? Any ideas traders ? How about this chart ! Attached Image (click to enlarge) The next TS Order 3 to be traded from early next week will use all of the data to this point to produce the next list of pairs to be traded. If any trader has some comments please post away and lets analyze it in detail. Masterrmind.............

--- 帖子 #737 ---
Masterrmind I have used another grid type just to demonstrate my thought on a fixed grid and just watching price move through, what would be each Octave

--- 帖子 #738 ---
A nice set of charts breaking the octives down into smaller more manageable trading sizes. What I've done previously is to draw in representative longer term S&amp;R zones and key trendlines and then apply analysis on lower TF's and smaller octive gaps. Then as price nears these confluent zones attempt to align all the technicals and try to include any fundamental bias that also aligns in the same direction be it long or short the market. The drawback to this approach is that once you have chosen a direction the trade direction is fixed for the duration of its life. It ends only when the stop gets taken out, TP gets hit or it gets closed out. On higher TF setups the initial choice of direction can be soon found to be incorrect as market information and news and noise alters the trajectory of price. As part of the automated strategy testing phase I'm currently going through I'll be examining this type of approach over a sufficiently long enough period of data (several years worth) on single up to multiple symbols. One potential area of concern is that the EA will simply trade in the direction initially input into the EA settings be it long or short. Ofcourse multiple cycles will be traded over a long enough testing period but every symbols initial input direction will remain in force for the duration of the test which means if I chose long EURUSD in the EA tester settings then every cycle started will have EU long the market and this is a limitation. The limitation will therefore need to be analyzed and then addressed and it certainly will be. This biased symbol direction (in automated format) might need greater flexibility: 1. Allow the EA to decide on Symbol direction via algo design rules; 2. Allow the EA to learn from its short comings and losses using a neural network approach and MATLAB Engine; 3. Allow several algos the flexibility to work together and design its own unique choice of trades in a multiple symbol setup. A current cycle would play out with the initial choice of symbol direction (User defined or EA defined). Subsequent cycle(s) would be determined based on the rules of several algos with feedback from the MATLAB analysis engine. Apologies for the technical lingo here but the good news is that the system can be traded manually and automatically (or semi-auto) and each approach can benefit from eachother. Learnings gained form the manual approach can be applied to the auto approach and vice-versa. This is certainly turning into an interesting project! Masterrmind..............

Just a thought, maybe a Renko style reversal or just view a 50% move inside the next Octave as acceptance or rejection ?

--- 帖子 #740 ---
Yes or apply Fibonacci ratios. With the application of renko I'm assuming that you are disregarding any fundamental inputs and applying a pure manual and technical approach. Masterrmind.............

--- 帖子 #741 ---
To me price will show fundamentals maybe you have to drill down time frames but even if there is a cough price reacts on a small time frame, the thought with Renko is that you use the the octave gaps not Renko in its pure form. The other way is Octave aceptance or rejection here is a scalp example

TRAILING STOPS How might trailing stops be applied to the MTTTM strategy ? 1. One reason for applying them is to limit the number of losses. 2. Another reason might be to bring a position's SL to BE asap so that additional positions or pending orders can be applied dynamically. When a trailing stop is applied it also has the possibility of limiting the number of full target TPs because PA can reverse and take out tighter stops. The application of Trailing Stops will be explored in greater detail both in a manual and auto trading approach. Opinions are welcome. Masterrmind............

Trailing ... continued AUDUSD [Example trailing - Long side] Attached Image (click to enlarge) Trailing by an octive gap. Trailing can be applied manually by the trader adjusting the SL price value but the trader must be at or near the terminal as required. Trailing can be applied in the MT4/5 settings using "Trailing Stop" but the platform must remain open. Trailing can be applied via a script or Expert Advisor (MT4/MT5) but the platform must remain open. For single or low number of pairs being traded a manual trailing approach is possible but somewhat inconvenient. For multiple pair trading a manual trailing approach is simply inconvenient. Good trading, Masterrmind............

--- 帖子 #758 ---
Trailing .... continued AUDUSD [Example trailing - Short side] Attached Image (click to enlarge) Advantage of trailing with only 1 octive gap is that in a strongly trending market with less than an octive pullback plenty of the move is captured. Disadvantage is that in a 'whippy' market the trade might be taken out early resulting in a missed opportunity to grab more profit. There are many different approaches that can be taken when applying trailing stops. The difficult part is deciding which trailing method is the 'best' one. Since trailing stops are applied before the fact, it is never possible to know which approach will be the best ! What we can do though is form an expectation on the likely flow of price for a given pair over a preferred trading session based on the OctiveGap. An appreciation for the typical PA within the OctiveGaps of the MML Grid can be found by observing historical charts. Excel can be used to manually enter the data and then an analysis can be completed. Alternatively, an informative indicator could be coded with suitable inputs that allows for the collection of a preferred range of data. The gathered data could also be transferred to Excel from the indicator and analyzed if required. There are plenty of tools that could be used but the bottom line is deciding how far one should go with this type of analysis. For example, if a trader is very confident in the Trading Method and the Reward to Risk ratio being applied then waiting until price moves say 2 or 3 octives before locking in at BE+ pips(to cover: spread,commision,swap) might be the best approach. A trader could also form an expectation as outlined above about the volatility of a given pair and seek to trail at a tighter gap. The Trailing Stop discussion is provided here since it will be applied to the MTTTM strategy. Testing may be performed in the background with key outcomes posted to this thread. This motivation comes from analyzing the demo trading account and looking for techniques that might reduce losses and contribute to Equity% gain. Masterrmind..............

Road Maps ?

--- 帖子 #765 ---
Based on the chart structure up in the 'OB' zone I'd be looking for price to firstly test these recent highs and if after several completed bars on an intraday TF price remains within the 'OB' zone I'd be looking for weakness to start showing in the strength of the bulls to drive price higher. For a Short entry: A bearish engulfing candle after weakness in a consolidated zone would indicate high probability for a sell entry on the back of some pretty decent reward to risk ratio. Stops just above the highs of the recent swing with a target TP1 @ 4/8 MML and a target TP2 @ 0/8 MML. For a Long entry: Still with a view of hesitation in the 'OB' zone. Dropping down to intraday TF's to gather up more of the PA, I'd be looking for a bullish engulfing candle or part thereof just up and above the recent swing highs followed by a pullback into the previous 'OB' zone and weakness by the bears in combination with a renewed strength by the bulls to drive price UP and out of this zone to the upside. Simple pullback and continuation approach. Perhaps a little riskier but stops placed just below the lower 'OB' zones lower band with a minimum of a 1 to 1 RRR up to 3 or 4:1 over a few targets. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ As you can tell, plenty rides on the technicals in and around the 'OB' zone and a sign of weakness shown by either side. Then its a matter of placing well positioned stops to effect a decent RRR which seeks to minimize applied risk as much as possible. This would be the minimum setup for either direction however, as I've mentioned many times before, the idea is to gather several factors including harmonics for a highly confluent zone for entry. ps. plenty I do see here but words are rather limited in this post as I could write a book on an entry technique in this space.

This is what i see when i put the indicator on twice with different 0/8 &amp; 8/8

--- 帖子 #775 ---
Masterrmind, a question on Fibonacci, we understand about how the Octaves are constructed, but what can we use to project direction and the many levels we have to break on the journey to banking green pips. Not being a fib guy, thought I would take a look, the example i am going to show is a very tight scalping type move off a MM 4 day, my eyes say in the big picture we are in a down trend and yes they will be bounces on the way but we have to determine if its a bounce or a worth while trend change this is were fibs come in i guess, what i have done instead of taking the obvious swing highs &amp; lows i have used the 0/8th &amp; 8/8th levels to start my fibs from ? Yes a bigger octave would be perhaps a little more useful but i will start at the sharp end

--- 帖子 #776 ---
With Fib ratios many traders have their favorites. I use Fib retracement ratios as : (0), 38.2, 50, 61.8, 78.6 and 88.6, (100). Fib extention ratios as: 1.272 and 1.618. Looking for price exhaustion levels with these ratios. A very useful and highly powerful harmonic is the simple ABCD pattern. AB typically equals CD in terms of pips so if you enter the trade at Point C you are expecting a 1 to 1 movement in PA. If you enter at or after Point D then you are entering a typical harmonic reversal after a 1 to 1 move has completed. The higher the TF the more reliable the Fib ratios however, to an experienced harmonic trader even the M1 and M5 TFs can be highly profitable. The idea should be to look for zones of confluence say in the Fibs when you would be looking for a lower TF Fib overlapping with a higher TF Fib. In terms of certain Fib ratios being in alignment. Candlestick reading, exhaustion type candle patterns, engulfing type candles all in confluence with say big 000 and 50 psych numbers and chart structure and the order flow are all important skills to aquire. The Reward to Risk ratio must be favorable though so better than 1 to 1 on all setups. On every setup you need to ascertain the stop and also the target (or multiple targets) which are logical and align with chart structure, levels of supply or demand and S&amp;R. Better still to gain confluence with harmonic moves and align these up as well. Where the AB leg is projected after the pullback (BC) to form the CD leg. The pullback can be any retracement ratio with the popular ones being those listed above. The deeper the pullback say to 78.6 (my favorite ratio) or 88.6 the better the perceived reward to risk ratio if stops are placed a few pips above or below the swing high or swing low. Any TF can be used as harmonics and Fibs apply to any TF on any symbol. In my opinion throw all of the 'lagging' junky indicators out the window and learn to apply the harmonic moves especially the ABCD 1 to 1 moves. Best technical trading skill one can learn. I will throw up some charts with examples tomorrow as i'm a little busy at the moment with other matters. Masterrmind.............

Gosh you are up late ? have e-mailed the info you wanted

--- 帖子 #780 ---
Yes thanks for that information. The only way to track the MM64 is via day by day approach until a change in MM levels occurs. I've solved what I set out to do and thanks for the updated charts you provided. The Murrey Math trading frame simply applies a start date in October and projects the Trading Frame forward in time based on input settings such as MM64/256 what have you, and only updates the levels on EOD if PA dictates (including breaks of the upper or lower OB/OS zones). The October Start Date is typically around the 6 to 10 October each year in sync with the 1st Frost (ha ha) and typically it will be on the first trading day of that particular week (so a Monday is a common choice). ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ My current view is to not be concerned so much about this "unusual start date/MML reset date" but to simply apply a manual upper and lower Trading Frame boundary set at a key swing high to swing low (or swing low to swing high). If the octive is too large simply break it in half by seeking to minimize the fractal. The fractal approach is key here. So too is the PA to which it aligns (in my opinion). This manual approach is more in sync with the Gann methodology. I have already coded an indicator (in MT4 and MT5) to accommodate this and have also coded the calculations into the MT5 EA. Testing shall continue in the heavily time consuming R&amp;D Dept. Masterrmind.............

A very quickly drawn and annotated Fib setup for the GBPUSD M5 Chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Allow the AB leg to play out. Wait for a retracement to a popular Fib ratio (eg 61.8, 78.6 or deeper at 88.6) Deeper the retracement the better the RRR potentially since the stops logically smaller than if we were to enter on a shallow retracement. Pros are better RRR on deeper pullbacks. Cons are that price might only make a shallow retracement and we miss an entry. Who cares though since there are so many opportunities another will be along rather quickly especially on small TFs like M5. What we expect after price pulls back to Point C is a 1 to 1 move up to Point D (thus AB leg pips ~ = CD leg pips). If you are going long the market try to enter after a bullish M5 candle. If you are going short to trade from Point D then enter after a bearish M5 candle. Then you can start looking for some good old fashioned confluence like entering long on support or short on resistance, chart structure on your side, at or near the psych numbers (levels). Its not always possible to have everything line up nicely so you need to make the call ... trade it or sit on the sidelines and wait for a better opportunity. If in doubt ... sit it out ! Then you can start to look at the order flow on your pair of choice and try to figure out where price is likely to be headed. Then throw in some relevant candlestick patterns such as bullish engulfing, bearish engulfing, inside bars among others. Chart time and heaps of practise is critical to a traders 'possible' success in this space. Without the chart time and the hundreds if not thousands of hours then success is highly unlikely. Learning the ABCD pattern might take a trader 30 minutes to a few hours to understand at a very basic level ! Knowing how and when to apply the ABCD pattern correctly might take an above average trader many months to master ! It is certainly one of the best technical trading skills a trader could ever possibly learn in my opinion. Then once the ABCD pattern is mastered there are several high quality harmonic patterns to learn. Advanced Harmonic patterns are not really that difficult to learn but once again a trader needs to know when and where to apply them on his/her chart otherwise they are simply trading off a completed pattern and this is NOT the approach to take. Again I will say it ............ seek out as much CONFLUENCE as possible so the odds of a successful outcome are on your side ! ps. if you wish to persue this further simply ask me, especially if you need additional detailed charts with a step by step approach. Good trading, Masterrmind...............

As usual thanks for taking time out to reply in such detail also for updating the indicator, appreciated as always . I like to see impulse bars appear to, much prefer them to normal candlestick patterns on small time frames p.s It used to bother me that no one showed any interest in the threads but boy am i glad now they did not, there are some really toxic and paranoid threads in action at the moment, so glad just to live a quite life under the radar

SL Trailing Revisited The trader must ultimately decide which SL trailing approach to use for his/her own TS Setup. It is NOT possible to guage ahead of time exactly what SL or trailing technique will yield the higher number of pips in profit per entry. Even so, this does not mean that an analysis is futile. What we need to do is form an opinion on the likely 'best fit' SL technique. In fact what we can do is run multiple SL scenarios over multiple pairs of choice and draw some conclusion based on average historical outcome. Some possible general SL scenarios might include the following: 1. NO SL applied (close on Equity% Gain and/or Equity% Loss); 2. SL Trailing using TrailStop and TrailStep (in pips: Start trailing after price moves favorably 50 pips then every 10 pips); 3. SL Trailing using TrailStop and TrailStep (in octives: Start trailing after price moves favorably 2 octives then every octive); 4. For points 2 and 3 applying a tightening of the trailing step as price approaches the target (if a TP has been set); 5. SL Trailing via ATR indicator (various choice of Period settings: for example, 20, 30, 60, etc); 6. ADR:OctiveGap trailing technique; and 7. other hybrid SL Trailing techniques. One example of a Hybrid SL Trailing technique is one in which multiple factors are fed into an algorithm with 1 output (the SL price level). Inputs might include (and not limited to) some of the following: a) Proximity either side of high impact news events; b) Floating P&amp;L for the given symbol; c) Chart structural considerations (prediction of harmonic completions simple or advanced); d) Weekly and Monthly support and resistance levels; e) Psychological levels; f) typical PA within a major trading session (contracting or expanding session ranges); and g) an almost unlimited set of others. It soon becomes obvious that there are so many options available, how on earth do we decide which one to apply in our setup? Put simply the trader needs to make this decision since there really is no hard and fast rule. Again, I will say that an analysis on historical data is a very common approach. Ofcourse, a forward tested approach can also be applied on a demo or small live account and adjustments made on the fly if necessary. Observers of the MTTTM trading strategy will notice that the TS Order 3 setups applied a rigid SL based on a ratio of the symbols OctiveGap and RRR. No modification was made to the SL levels at any time. An almost Set&amp;Forget type approach. The results show a 29% strike rate over 141 trades for about a 10% gain at 21% DD(Max). The traders objective should therefore be to constantly analyze the trading history in search of any clues that might improve the strike rate. Strike rate is just one part of the puzzle though and ultimately what I'm more concerned about is the gain in Equity% versus the DD. What I'm looking at now is a SL technique that might reduce the losses and overtime improve the gain in Equity. Later there will also be other key factors that will need to be addressed to further improve the trading method. In my case what I will outline soon is a possible SL technique. The idea of using multiple data sets is to have exposure to how net profit might fluctuate for a given pair over all tested pairs. It may well be the case that a unique trailing SL algorithm needs to be applied per symbol. Although a manual analysis approach can be used it is far quicker to use a specially designed Expert Advisor. The EA can then be set to run across as many data sets as you like with little input on the part of the trader. I have designed an EA for such a task and in time I will outline the findings and how these findings came about. If a benefit can be demonstrated then it will, in time, be implemented into the MTTTM strategy. Improvements to the MTTTM strategy are therefore dynamic in nature, meaning that I analyze data as it unfolds and seek to implement any improvements likely to lead to better results. This approach should be taken by any serious trader/systems designer/developer ... always seeking out that edge ! Masterrmind..............

Testing Multiple Symbols via EA in MT5 Plenty of R&amp;D in progress. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Eventually I'll add all the "comment" information shown on the chart into a neat Panel. The EA makes trade placements and timing a simple exercise (much faster and smoother than by human approach). Attached Image (click to enlarge) Testing of trade entries on the MML Grid. A variety of functionalities is being investigated. Multiple Trailing stop options have already been coded in including via ADR, pips, octive count and candles. Multiple pairings. MML indicator defined octives. Manual MML defined octives (using manual over-ride of the major octave namely; choosing price of the 0/8 MML and the 8/8 MML). In the background, I am also investigating the option of being able to trade a unique set of multiple synthetic pairs. All with the ability of the EA to update and modify a given synthetic pair in real time based on several inputs. A synthetic pair is simply a combination of several other pairs via the addition or subtraction of x*Pair A from y*Pair B, and so on. To understand this further requires construction of the 'synthetic symbol' in the form of a chart (line, bar or candle). Once the chart of the synthetic symbol is constructed an appropriate MTTTM Grid is designed, applied and then tested over several data sets. Although I have tested these approached many many years ago, never have I attempted multiple synthetics over an MTTTM Grid. In time, I'll update this thread with any useful information. The main aim being to implement any useable ideas directly into the MTTTM Trading Strategy. Masterrmind..............

--- 帖子 #800 ---
In case you think the MTTTM strategy is restricted to only basic BUYStop, SELLStop and BUYlimit / SELLlimit orders or at Market, think again. The type of order or immediate market entry applied is dictated via the logic within the main trading module of the EA. For example, if Symbol price is within a given trade tolerance (X-pips) from an MML line and the SL and TP remain within the MML Grid then an at market entry is executed. Otherwise the entry is via a pending order subject to its relationship between current price and the MML Grid levels...simple enough. All order types are catered for: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I have also coded in the use of BuyStopLimit and SellStopLimit orders however, their entry criteria is yet to be finalized. This means that these 2 order types are not yet set as active in the EA ... some additional research and testing is needed before finalization. Masterrmind............

A key priority in this current H1 TS Order 3 is to finish the cycle net positive. This will allow the next cycle to be traded with 0.4% (0.2 + 0.2) Risk per Trade. Lets see how it turns out. Masterrmind.............

EURCAD [H1] Winning trade +0.8 % Attached Image (click to enlarge) Masterrmind.............

--- 帖子 #804 ---
EURUSD [H1] Update SL moved to BE+ pips to lock in some profit (about US$5) and reduce the risk of a reversal taking back more than I would want to see. It was tempting to close it out at the 0.2% gain but I'll attempt to let it run until just before the end of the month. If a reversal takes out the stop then so be it (profit is already locked in). The idea behind this move is to ensure that the equity at the end of this cycle of trades is greater than the previous cycles closing equity. Previous Cycles closing Equity was US$11 046.06. Attached Image (click to enlarge) This will force a higher risk per trade, meaning that 0.4% (0.2% + 0.2) will be applied from the start of the next H1 TS Order 3. This might appear as counter intuitive but as long as a cycle completes in positive territory then the idea should be to get to the upper Risk per Trade Limit (+2%) as fast as possible. If the cycles start to run negative returns then the reduction in the applied Risk per Trade will take care of it. Current Account situation is as follows: Attached Image (click to enlarge) 1 open position on EURUSD and 1 pending order on EURGBP. Masterrmind..............

--- 帖子 #805 ---
Risk Profile As the MTTTM strategy unfolds its important to keep tabs on the risk profile via observation of the following chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The risk profile dictates that 0.2% risk per trade will be added to the risk profile of the next cycle if a positive net cycle outcome occurs. The risk profile dictates that 0.4% risk per trade will be subtracted from the risk profile of the next cycle if a negative net cycle outcome occurs. Cycle 1: Start Risk per Trade = 1% Next cycles Risk per Trade based on self assigned steps (as above) adding 0.2% or deducting 0.4% based on previous cycle outcome. An upper limit was also assigned on the Risk per Trade which is 2% . A lower limit was not assigned however, it was outlined that Risk per Trade will reduce in a sequence of losing cycles at the assigned rate of 0.4% until such time that current Risk per Trade is at or close to 0.4% after which the Risk per Trade will be halved down to a level that would allow a minimal broker lot size to be traded (typically 0.01 lots at most commonly used retail brokerage firms). Recall that the Risk per Trade values were self assigned. Ofcourse other values can be used that imply a higher or a lower risk profile. The choice is that of the responsible trader but it is my hope that traders reading through the pages of this thread will see the importance of managing the risk profile and how a reducing Risk per Trade in the losing series of cycles can prolong the trading activity. If the outcomes are going to continue to be negative cycles then we would want the losses to be minimized as much as possible. Just as there are losing streaks in any trading methodology so too there will be winning streaks. Gains on the account are far more impressive when a relatively higher Risk per Trade is being applied but it must be applied based on account progress NOT on trader desires. If the account generates slightly higher cycle gains then reward yourself by slowly stepping up the Risk per Trade figures. Do not be tempted to slot in maximum self assigned Risk per Trade after several losing cycles because the next cycle could also be a losing one and the losses will be unecessarily magnified. Also notice that my self assigned maximum upper limit is set at a Risk per Trade of 2% meaning that once I hit this level any future positive cycle will also be traded at 2% Risk per Trade. The first cycle, however, was started at the mid point being 1% Risk per Trade, so I did not start off at maximum Risk per Trade (2%). I need to be able to reward myself when cycles are positive so starting at 2% on the very first traded cycle would defeat the purpose. Always start the first cycle with a Risk per Trade of less than or equal to 50% of the upper limit ! Masterrmind...............

Seeking out an Asymmetric Risk Return Outcome The MTTTM strategy just like any other trading strategy seeks to maximize the gains and attempt to reduce the losses as much as possible. Attempt to have the average positive returns greater than the average losing returns over the longer term. As losses mount it is the traders responsibility to: a) address the situation dynamically in a timely manner; b) analyze all trading activity regularly; c) draw relevant conclusions from the data depicted in the form of charts or tables; and d) implement any changes deemed critical to improving the outcome of the trading strategy. This suggests that when a series of losses occur that the risk is contained somewhat and certainly minimized as much as possible. Afterall we know we must apply some risk in order to make some potential gain (nothing is guaranteed afterall in this business). Attached Image (click to enlarge) This risk containment approach has been outlined in the post above however, it can get rather more complex than what I have posted. But I'm not going to get into the complex side of risk control just yet (this I will elaborate on over the coming months). For now I want to address the issue of Asymmetric Risk Return Outcome. The following chart shows 2 overlapping bell shaped curves (one normally distributed and the other with fat tails) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Typically it is the region within the fat tails (or outliers) where the higher gains are to be expected. The mean afterall produces outcomes that are closer to average gains. What we want to achieve is a greater proportion of the higher outlier or fat tail outcomes. Win Rate The MTTTM Strategy currently shows a win rate of 28.7% (source: TE) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Formula: [ (1 / winrate) – 1 ] = (1/ (28.7/100)) - 1 = 2.48. So the strategy with a win rate of 28.7% requires a 2.5 Profit to Risk payout in order to break even. Clearly the strategy is exceeding the BE threshold since the return is currently positive (&gt;10.8%). Yet a basic analysis of the trading results points to the fact that improvements should be made to improve the net gain. On the one hand this strategy is currently being traded on a demo account with no broker commisions applied. So we need to consider the impact of spread and other typical trading costs that apply on a real account. I won't elaborate on the impact of spread and broker commision costs at this time since these values may vary widely based on the trading conditions of the chosen broker and the retail pricing model being applied. The trading analytics show that 142 trades have been closed out and although a far higher number of closed trades would be statistically pleasing we can still consider implementing ONE key idea. Question Based on what I have typed out in this post can anyone tell me what that key idea might be ? Masterrmind.............

MT5 EA progress. Manual MML Range can be over-ridden by the user. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) For example on the following chart of EURUSD, only 1 pair set to trade on a fixed MML Grid. MML 8/8 = 1.17000 MML 0/8 = 1.15000 Attached Image (click to enlarge) Multiple pairs can then be traded with Standard MML calculation mode or Manual MML calculation mode. You could set 3 pairs to trade within defined MML price ranges and 6 to trade based on Standard calc mode. I have not yet decided whether to add in 18 more symbols for a total of 27 so that 1 EA instance can control all 27 entries or simply to leave the EA in its current 9 symbol trading state. If 27 pairs needed to be traded then its a simple case of applying the EA to 3 charts all with unique magics (eg. 1001, 2002 and 3003). Symbol design can be input into each EA to get 9 symbols * 3 charts = 27 symbols (either all unique symbols or repeating in some cases). A trader might seek to trade the EURUSD (or any other available symbol) in each of the EA instances but trade in TF's such as M15, H1 and H4. Trailing options currently include a choice of 5 but this might change later. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Almost no limit to the possibilities. Development shall continue including the all important testing phase (currently in action). Note: the EA settings or design layout have not yet been finalised but there are currently more than 115 parameters being used. Masterrmind............

In Post 806 I mentioned Asymmetric Risk Return outcome. A question was also presented in blue font color . Does any trader have a clue as to what the key idea might be ? We seek to improve the strike rate. How might we set out to achieve this goal and what can we do about it now ? Anything ? Or do we simply pack it in and take our bat and ball and go home. Masterrmind...............

--- 帖子 #809 ---
SOME HINTS Asymmetric suggests having a return profile with higher positive outcomes and at the same time having lower and less frequent negative returns. FX retail trading losses need to be contained ... The MTTTM strategy applies hard stops on all entries thereby containing risk. FX retail trading Reward to Risk Ratio (RRR) should be greater than 1 ... The MTTTM strategy applies a RRR of 4 to 1. Asymmetric outcome dictates that when profit is generated it must be significant ... Is the MTTTM strategy living up to this expectation ? a) firstly define significant ? Here significant in terms of FX suggests a meaningful Return on Equity per individual trade. b) when profit is gained from a trade is the Return on Equity significant ? Depends how you look at it. Often the win comes after a string of losses so in my mind the win is not so significant except to counteract a continuing fall in the Equity curve. In other words the MTTTM Strategy has shown that on average it usually generates 3 to 4 losses in a row on every cycle traded before a winner comes along. Often there is a longer wait for a winning trade than 3 to 4 losses in a row, sometimes as many as 6 to 8 or even more. When a winner comes along, if its a full target winner it might be 4 times that of a losing trade (4 to 1 RRR), so in effect the winning trade is simply stabilizing the Equity Curve and propping it up marginally by erasing the impact from the losing trades. A winning trade is simply halting the downward trajectory of the curve but this might only be a temporary measure. A significant series of losses in a row when the Equity is close to BE or below can be rather detrimental, so timing is critical too. The strike rate stands out as the major determinant of the overall Equity Curve shape (UP, DOWN or flat). A minimal strike rate is required to BE (we already know what this level is as per Post 1). Less than BE and things are looking bad. A strike rate greater than BE and the Equity Curve will likely soar high. How do we set about to accomplish the task of improving the strike rate ? Masterrmind.............

--- 帖子 #810 ---
How about some of these examples. 1. Change the RRR ; 2. Trade more symbols ; 3. Trade less symbols ; 4. Trade symbols related to sessions (JPY, AUD,NZD in Asian session; EUR, GBP in London session and USD, CAD in New York session); 5. other ideas ... What we could do is use the EA to test a previously traded session on the same brokers data using the same pairs and make changes over multiple scenarios and analyze the results. This is simply to find out if there is any change that creates a major difference in the results. Its important to realize here that we are simply testing a small data sample and that the results may not be statistically significant. Nevertheless, it costs very little to run the testing only some time. Masterrmind............

New ESMA rules 27 pairs with Majors 20:1 others 10:1 multiple entries and trades running Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

--- 帖子 #812 ---
For those traders not affected by ESMA rules it is business as usual. Whilst the affected ESMA traders will need to be more selective and more creative in their FX trade planning. Perhaps trading only a few pairs and at much lower volumes than what they might be used too. Leverage as low as 1 to 1 still allows a trader to open say 0.01 lots with Equity as low as $1300-$1400 depending on overall broker margin reqts. With 2K-5K start capital a trader can open several small positions at a leverage of only 1 to 1 so 10, 20 or 30:1 is going to be even better. At the end of the day a trader has to deal with what has been dealt to them, good or bad. Either work with it or move on to other things. As always it is the little guy that suffers the most here because lower funding usually equates to less favorable trading conditions in general. Not all traders have a million dollars !

Margin Requirements Examples Margin requirement Fromula: Margin amount ($) = [Market Quote * Volume (base currency)] / Leverage Open 0.01 lots on GBPUSD @ 1.31230 (USD denominated account) Account Equity: US$ 1000 Leverage: 1 to 1 Margin amount ($) = [1.31230 * 1000] / 1 = $1,312.30 So a trader needs at least $1,312.30 in free margin to open 1 position @ 0.01 lots on the GBPUSD pair at the current quote price. Account Equity: US$ 1000 Leverage: 10 to 1 Margin amount ($) = [1.31230 * 1000] / 10 = $131.23 So a trader needs at least $131.23 in free margin to open 1 position @ 0.01 lots on the GBPUSD pair at the current quote price. Account Equity: US$ 1000 Leverage: 30 to 1 Margin amount ($) = [1.31230 * 1000] / 30 = $43.74 So a trader needs at least $43.74 in free margin to open 1 position @ 0.01 lots on the GBPUSD pair at the current quote price.

The attraction for me to play this game was the high leverage (do'nt mind being called a gambler) as I am realistic enough to say that I am no pro trader, the problem I have now is that not only do they want even more money to open an account (we will not go into if your brokers is honest or even gives interest on your unused balance ) the cost once in the trade, to run it is the same, but we now have to be careful as we could get closed if our account value drops below 50% so with negative swaps and a number of trades running it seems a very hard game now to play to win, and to be honest not really interested in winning pennies, my silly thought is as a (gambler) for a very long time I am a big boy so I can accept telling me how much I need to open an account to play, yes although I think they have took my edge away with lower leverage its the bloody 50% closer that as got me thinking the most, in short I play and have fun with money I can afford to loose, it now might be that really, although its opposite to figures given out there are a band of retail guys that know what they are doing and can make very decent money with retaliative small accounts that they are really gunning for and using the very small guy as a smoke screen after all have you seen the terms to call yourself a pro trader ?

--- 帖子 #823 ---
I believe many other traders saw the high leverage as a real attraction. Small outlay with the chance of a high return. Some traders make very good use of high leverage and some do not.

Yes it was a (new) industry once and I believe it was used to draw in customers, at that time there was very little in the way of software, but over time it as evolved with very clever guys creating better and better charting programmes, ea, robots even indicators that have become more widely available to the little guy, to the point our understanding of the product as greatly increased and also our chances of taking a few bob off them on a regular basis

Yes a high leverage approach to a capable trader can generate a quick return in one trade that might mean several entries on much lower leverage. Instead of being in and out and you're done, its take a little bite, hope you get the next entry right and take another small bite, and so on and so long until the same gain in Equity is achieved. A bit like watching grass grow if you are used to high leverage and then get hit with low leverage. As I say, traders will need to firstly adjust and then perhaps completely re-design their trading approach. The gains might be 'safer' on lower leverage, which is debatable, but they will definitely take longer to accumulate. Your 'few bob' might become a living nightmare ! Masterrmind.............

The game holds very little interest for me now, to me the slight edge I had ( fairly good money-management ) as been nullified, my method of, if need be adding extra trades at predefined levels, as been made more costly to implement, not really interested in watching grass grow and not willing to play with silly money again ( done that when hit by the Twin Towers and Enron) when there are more cost effective greener pastures that interest me, so will just stick around until October then see how the land lies and see what the brokers come up with to combat these new trading rules.

--- 帖子 #831 ---
Adding into positions is a well founded trading technique, no matter what instrument you care to trade. Start with low volume and build into the position. Given a similar start balance and 2 very different leverages, position adding might mean 1 to 2 entries now as opposed to 10. Clearly the trading strategies and planning will need to be re-aligned and modified. I can see your point about losing interest especially if adding much larger chunks of capital to your trading account is undesirable. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Masterrmind..............

Inject more money into your account, take a number of positions but if your account drops by 50% they close your positions, to stop you losing all your money, so in reality you can never ever drop below 50% of your account when trading ? or you can only ever have half your account at risk.

--- 帖子 #835 ---
Yes I saw that 50%, its just another way of forcing traders to strictly manage their accounts. Not only is the leverage reduced but also the ability to swing your account through some steep DD episodes. Basically, manage your account like a professional or we'll take over and do it for you ! Education is the best approach. Masterrmind.............

--- 帖子 #839 ---
No not you. If you choose the right broker many of them nowadays do not charge deposit or withdrawal fees. International wire transfers however usually have a fee attached and the fee varies widely based on choice of broker and other conditions. Read the small print, all the PDF's outlining the Terms and Conditions found on the brokers website. Best advise I can give to you is to start a search online and start making a list of likely candidates (brokers). There are a limited number of Australian regulated (ASIC) brokers which offer some form of interest payments on the un-used portion of account margin. That is to say, the available margin not being used in any open positions. Make sure to consider the likely impact of some of the following after you ascertain that they accept British residents: 1. Deposit fee (re type of deposit) 2. Withdrawal fee (re type of withdrawal) 3. Trading conditions (typical spread(s) on the pairs you usually trade, re-quotes (this can drive you mad), ECN or not) 4. Leverage offered to British residents 5. Reputation of the broker 6. General opinion of online reviews about the broker. 7. Assess the information (PDF's) on the brokers website. A question I do have for you though, is what is the minimum leverage you seek ? (50:1, 100:1, 200:1, 500:1). Most ASIC regulated brokers offer up to 500:1 leverage (on the majors at least) such as: IC Markets , Pepper stone, Vantage FX, Global Prime, Invast, DirectFX, RubixFX, SynergyFX, Core Liquidity, ThinkForex among others. There may well be some threads on FF dedicated to this topic including the one about the ESMA rulings. I wish you well on your search. Masterrmind..............

LEVERAGE INVESTIGATED The current demo test account namely: MTTTM-Test 1 is traded via AAFX broker with 1000:1 leverage. All this leverage is NOT being used but even so it may look daunting to those traders wishing to apply the methodology on much lower leverage. In the interests of those traders wishing too or forced to use lower leverage I will start an MTTTM demo test on an account as follows: Demo: MTTTM-Test 2-Lev25 Broker: Global Prime (no reason for choice) Platform: MT4 Leverage: 25:1 Symbols: only EURUSD, GBPUSD and EURGBP [ ESMA limits being 30:1 was NOT available only 1:1, 10:1, 25:1, 33:1 and higher so I chose lower at 25:1 ] Minimal Account Balances using 25:1 leverage This depends on several factors including: 1. Trading TS Order 1 (3 pairs) or TS Order 3 (9 pairs) or higher; 2. Risk per Trade (%); 3. Risk across the account (%); 4. Margin Requirement; 5. other factors. Firstly, lets list some key factors about the Trading Strategy that we want to apply. 1. MTTTM Strategy; 2. EURUSD, GBPUSD and EURGBP; 3. Risk per Trade range (~0.1% to max 5%); 4. Max Assigned Risk across the Account set at 15% (3 pairs * max 5% Risk per Trade = 15%); 5. Risk Step Profile ( Start: 1% ; +0.2% net posiitve cycle ; -0.4% net negative cycle ); 6. Capital ?? Account Minimum Trading at the minmum required amount to open 3 trades on EURUSD, GBPUSD and EURGBP is NOT practical nor advisable. A large buffer is needed to cater for swings in your Equity brought about by DD. Margin Required on 25:1 leverage = 1/25 = 4% Minimal volume = 0.01 (1000 nominal) Buying Power = 1000*25 = US$25000 Examples: EURUSD margin on 1000 nominal (0.01 lots) @ 1.15590 = 1000/(25*1.15590) = US$46.24 GBPUSD margin on 1000 nominal (0.01 lots) @ 1.29430 = 1000/(25*1.29430) = US$51.78 EURGBP margin on 1000 nominal (0.01 lots) @ 0.89280 = 1000/(25*0.89280)[applicable EURUSD rate] = US$46.32 Total Margin = US$46.24 + US$51.78 + US$46.32 = US$144.34 Free Margin = Equity - Used Margin (as Equity floats around so too does the available margin) Effective Leverage = Nominal Positions Size/Account Equity = (1000 + 1000 + 1000)/1000 = 3 to 1 SL$ = 1.5*Octive Gap*Value per pip (nominal volume) = EURUSD [1.5*30.5 pips*US$10/100] + GBPUSD [1.5*30.5 pips*US$10/100] + EURGBP [1.5*15.3 pips*US$12.96/100] = US$4.58 + US$4.58 + US$2.97 = US$12.13 SL% = US$12.13/1000*100 = 1.2% For every 0.03 lots across 3 symbols (EU;GU;EG) the assumed risk is about 1.2% . Potential profit (using 4 to 1 RRR) is US$12.13*4 = US$48.52 = ~4.8%. As shown it is possible to trade the MTTTM Strategy (TS Order 1; 3 pairs) using leverage of only 25:1 on an account of just $1000. There is enough information in this post to determine the absolute minimum Equity required to trade 3 pairs (as listed). Afterall, while it is possible to open the 3 positions at 0.01 lots each with only about US$144.34 you also need to consider moves against you and how this affects your free margin. Consider the Brokers Stop Out level and what movement against your positions would lead to a margin call. Play it safe and apply a reasonable equity buffer above and beyond the minimal margin required. ps. the demo account being traded at 25:1 leverage will start at US$3000 since this was the minimal offfered by the broker.

Attached Image (click to enlarge) This is what is possible ! Note that PA and harmonics are also used in this intraday approach to build up an effective initial buffer. The buffer is profit that may be used to offset potential losses. Some trades may be opened at higher relative lot sizes and closed out for a few pips (as in scalps).

Hi Masterrmind, Can you please share your ideas on how to control drawdown ? How Margin level percentage can be used as an metric? How to determine cycle equity line? Can we divide the equity into a few cycles and then use those cycles as equity stop-loss? Do increasing or decrasing lots help in drawdown management? How to find a balance between Risk and Reward. If I make 10% increase in my equity, shoud I take a 80% risk subsequently to manage the drawdown? At what point shoud I let it go? You have done a lot of work on drawdown management. A set of metrics based on your extensive experience will be very helpful. Ofcourse, it will vary from symbol to symbol.

--- 帖子 #881 ---
Unfortunately there is no one risk/reward rule that fits all strategies. Any loss prevention strategy applied must be modified dynamically as required and this is an ongoing process NOT a set and forget approach. Although its possible to generalize the techniques that seek to 'control DD' this is NOT an effective approach. What is required here is a full outline of the particular trading strategy including the following: 1. Trading strategy outline; 2. Account information (start balance, any additional access to funds, account leverage, margin stop out, hedge or non-hedge etc); 3. List of symbols to be traded, how the symbols will be traded (seperately, all together or other sequence); 4. Lot sizing (Standard, simple Lot multiplier, CLS, PLS or other hybrid approach) 5. Intraday or longer term; 6. With or without stops. Margin level % can be plotted on a chart and specific actions taken at pre-defined ML% levels but this depends on the trading strategy being used. Cycle Equity lines are best determined using a charting approach or plotting Balance/Equity versus Time, there are indicators in MT4/5. Then have the indicator coded to plot a vertical line on the Equity Chart at cycle completion time and list the key data values. By dividing the Equity into a few cycles I am assuming that you will allocate X*% of the Balance to a given cycle of trades (1 up to many). What do you mean by using those cycles as Equity SL ? Please elaborate. Increasing and decreasing lot size management is something that I have been working on for a very long time. You may recall me mentioning the term ECTM which stands for Equity Curve Trace Management. I most likely will keep the workings of the ECTM approach close to my chest (not outline it here). What I will say is that I applied this technique for a period of time when trading a demo test of the QAM Strategy (Quantum Asian Method) in 2017. The method involved adjusting the lot sizes based on the Equity flow. Lot sizes were increased and then decreased at certain times based on the flow of Equity. To be very effective at applying the ECTM technique it requires an EA to manage it because trying to do it manually over multiple open trades is not easy and eventually when the adjustments are needed the trader may not be at the platform. The balance between Risk and Reward is based on testing data sets on symbols of choice and analyzing it and then modifying it on forward or live trading approach if necessary. "How to find a balance between Risk and Reward. If I make 10% increase in my equity, shoud I take a 80% risk subsequently to manage the drawdown? At what point shoud I let it go? " This may depend on the trading strategy and since I do not know what strategy you will be using it is difficult to comment. You might like to outline your strategy and some of the requested information I have outlined above. The symbol choice plays a part. Which symbols will you trade and how will you be trading them ? ps. Please be aware that a book could easily be written on risk control measures in trading ! Masterrmind..............

Following is the information you asked for: The symbol is GBPJPY. I only trade just one symbol and have no experience in trading any other symbol based on drawdown management. The strategy is Intraday - momentum trading Active only during Asian Session and the first hour of London open Target is 60 pips daily irrespective of trades done. I would be happy if the drawdown happens only after I have piled up 600 pips profit. Active Trade: 1 lot of standard lot Risk Reward - 1:2 Drawdown - 30% bottom +60% top Hedging: No Equity: $50,000 Leverage: 1:200 Adverse trades managed by addition of 1 constant lot at every drawdown of 100 pips Rinse and Repeat done dynamically based on fundamentals analysis If an adverse situation persists, use Rinse and Repeat with weekly Fibo and weekly ADR starting 4th lot or after 600 pips drawdown. Equity Cycles: 3 based on margin deposit of $50,000 Equity Stop-out: 30% of equity loss or $15,000 What should be the consideration to exit prior to reaching equity loss stop out ? Is it the number of consecutive drawdowns? Technically what points to be considered when strong reversion could take place? Most of the times I keep changing the TP and take profit early in case of Rinse and Repeat largely to increase free margin or equity balance. Profit was also taken with the idea to re-enter? When I go to sleep I forget to do it. And when I am awake I am taking profits early when I monitor equity balance. On analysis I found if I had allowed t he rinse and repeat trades to run their course of taking profit, I would have been in profit much earlier. What kind of planning should I do to achieve risk-reward based on drawdown bottom and peaks? Or should I divide the equity stop out into a number of stop loss positions and use stop loss for every trade?

MTTTM Live account. Trading is progressing very well. ps. I haven't even started to put the foot down hard yet ! Masterrmind............

MTTTM Live Approach As shown the 1st month gain was +25%. My intention is to trade over a 3 month period, collect the monthly gains and then average them to form a projected monthly target. For example, Month 1 = +25% Month 2 = +15% Month 3 = +20% Average (over 3 months) = (25% + 15% + 20% )/3 = +20% Compounded monthly target then becomes +20%. It does not make much sense to use only the 1st months gain as a future target since it may not represent ongoing averages. This may well be true for a 3 month average too but its 'better' than using only 1 month of trading data. In any case, every 3 month period this will be re-calculated to form a new monthly target. As the months tick by I'll also consider the impact of typically slower months such as mid December through to mid January. If 20% does happen to be the target then I may accelerate any future months gain prior to mid December to compensate for this short fall. At a minimum I plan to compound the account at double digits month on month with close to 25% per month long term being the objective. Only the 3 monthly average will alter my view on this 25% objective so lets wait and see how this plays out. Here is a simple compound chart showing how a 25% monthly compound rate unfolds in time. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Unlikely that any trader can follow this curve but its something to wet the appetite. The TE under my signature will show the current months gain as it occurs. Transparent trader at work in this space ! ps. Note that this account is only a small 1K account and is being traded at higher relative risk so anything could happen ! Masterrmind.............

Kind of Got a little bit lost when you traded your live 1K Account, So for the intra day you are not looking at using a full TS just the one pair? Also current strike rate on the 1 hour MTTM system for you has it been better than when you were on the 15? Noting that the amount of Pips required to hit TP is going to be remotely a little larger.. I noticed you were closing them out a little before TP levels.. I am going to try throw a TS 2 or TS 3 depending on how i'm feeling in the morning I will have a slightly different approach I will open 2 posits per pair aim for a 1R move then move to BE on the second posit to try and hit the 4R level with TS at 2R.. This is how I normally open orders anyway but it will mean your calculations will be out a little ( which I'm not overly fussed with ) If I can lock in BE and small Profit per Pair I am ok with that.. I noticed you have said you are phasing out MT4 indi's, are you going to have MT5 versions available.. I am slowly migrating to Mt5 now as I do like the 8 and 12Hr charts.. Anyway seems a nice approach will be prepared to try

--- 帖子 #904 ---
I deleted a post awhile back that mentioned how I would trade the live 1K account using the MTTTM Strategy. Main reason was lack of trader participation. So here is a brief overview of how I am currently trading the Live account It is being traded using higher relative risk meaning higher lot sizes for a 1K account (to accelerate the gain in equity mainly). The plan is to build it up to an Equity I am happy with to start trading the full MTTTM system using multiple pairs. Ofcourse, a trader could trade 3 pairs on a 1K account but its a rather slow approach if the trading rules are strictly applied. Its slow because the rules favor long term survival in the market and therefore Gains in Equity are modest compared to the risk. Currently its an almost scalping type approach off MML levels but one could be forgiven for suggesting that it is pure scalping, which it is not. High relative lot approach means I am reading PA on the chart and if I think price may reverse against my position then I will exit rather swiftly. This is why currently the largest loss on the account is about 1% even though I'm trading as much as 1Lot per 1K. At this lot size ratio price does not have to move far against my position to eat up 1-2% of Equity. What I am looking to do though is get into a 'good trade' off an MML level and lock it in at BE+a few pips for a free ride and then trail my stop. I apply Chart structure, harmonics, PA analysis, confluence of multiple factors and a genuine feel based on experience. Difficult to teach this current approach on a slow moving thread especially when trades may close out in minutes should a reversal against my position occur and better to look over the full MTTTM system outlined in Post 1 which I'm sure you have already read. So that's about it, looking to make a largish gain in a short period of time and then revert to the full MTTTM system approach using multiple pairs. The demo accounts (1@10K and the other 1@3K) currently show the MTTTM system using multiple pairs but without trader discretion, almost a set&amp;forget type approach. Questions are welcome. ps. I will be looking to make 100's %'s of Gain in Equity on this account so it may be active for at least the rest of this year ! Masterrmind..............

--- 帖子 #905 ---
I thought I would use a separate post for the rest of your questions. Nice to know at least a few are following along. M15 and H1 have their differences based mostly on the octive gaps of each TF. Higher TF typically a larger stop and larger target but certainly not always. Cycle start time has a big say in this or more specifically the actual octive gap at cycle setup time. The Demo account mated with the thread posts will provide some information about strike rate. However, to be fair there were 16 cycles (up to 9 trades each) completed on M15 TF and currently only 5 by H1 cycles completed. To make a reasonable comparison between the 2 TF's I would at least require same number of cycles meaning 11 more H1 cycles. I keep tabs on all cycles on an Excel spreadsheet so strike rate per TF is a breeze to analyze. I will post a chart when the comparison is ready for the masses. Some early closures have occurred so this mucks with the statistics a little bit but histrorical charts can be analyzed to decide what "might have been" had the trades run their course untouched. If such modifications are made they will be documented. Good to see you having a go at modifying positions but yet still seeking the 4R. Let me know how you progress. I will be converting to MT5, mostly have already however, no MT5 indicators will be posted if the participation remains low. More than happy to upload multiple indicators when the thread is active but see no point if its static. Good trading, Masterrmind..............

Post further above gives a fairly good idea of what the deleted post was all about as regards to the Live account methodology. Basically, enter near an MML level with relatively high lots and get out if PA becomes unfavorable. Masterrmind..............

Awesome, Well I was looking at the 1k real and thought it was definitely more a scalping tech, using an entry around the MML's.. I was only asking about the strike rate due to the fact the MML's will be a little different on each TF.. I would prefer the larger targets and will mainly aim at hitting the 1 Hr charts myself, but if you were noticing more cycles were making the 4R on 15 min TF it may be better to keep with the lower TF. Will be good to know the outcome anyways.. Doing some good work, its a shame not much participation.. Maybe its a little too hard for some people to follow as it requires a little bit of work.. But after reading everything I think I have got my head around it.. Will share what I have got once I get going on it all need to be off night shifts though as I cant focus after my shift to even look at the charts..

--- 帖子 #912 ---
If you look at the TE and in particular the Return by Trade graph you'll see that several trades for relatively small gains are made followed by an aggressive few trades. Basically what I'n doing here is building up some 'buffer profit' that might later be used to offset a loss that might occur from an even higher lot trade entry. The buffer buildup phase is very important since it "scalps" relatively lower risk profit from out of the market and compensates for an eventual loss that may occur in an aggressive entry trade. The flow of the chart gives away much of what I have said. Here is the chart: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Process of building up buffer profit and then waiting for an ideal setup to unload an aggressive higher lot entry or more slack in the SL. Yet the idea is not too scalp rather to read the PA and get out of the trade if it appears to be losing favored traction. Most traders want the easy way out, push a button to go short or long and not apply much thinking. It might work for awhile but when it stops working they have no idea why. Then its off to the next system much like a system hopping junky. Masterrmind..............

--- 帖子 #913 ---
I cannot afford to be in the trade too long when current lot sizings are a minimum 0.1 lot to 1 lot on a 1K account. I read PA and more times than not I get it right on an exit, but ofcourse miss some rather longer trades that would have hit say a 20 pip or more TP. But this does not concern me, also the higher relative commission outlay also doesn't bother me since the net gain on the account over the month was quite respectable at 25%+. The focus for every trade though is to let it run until I can lock in at BE + a few pips and then let it attempt to run through the target level. Unfortunately not too many of these trades hit the target because I am very swift to close them out if I suspect a reversal against me. Smaller stops also have the issue of being quickly whipsawed out of a trade. You might wonder why a trader does not simply continue to trade like this in an attempt to get double digit returns month on month. The answer is that ofcourse they can if this type of trading suits them. As for your charts they are really great for scalping but I'd zoom in to see the bars so that PA is much clearer. By all means feel free to post an entry and you never know we might share the same trade. Masterrmind..............

GU [M5] Attached Image (click to enlarge) Blue box is an ideal zone for looking to go long. But its about 25 pips below current price and that's giving up too many pips waiting for an entry. Option might be to drop the lot size slightly and attempt a short. Then hit a long entry IF price comes into the zone. Note the 1.30 handle in confluence with the 78.6 - 88.6 Fibs and the strong bullish push at this level earlier today, I like this type of setup. Also looking at several other pairs so I might trade any pair at any time. ps. If price continues up the chart from current level then its a matter of re-assessing for a suitable entry. pps. Consider enough information but do not over-complicate the setup, afterall I'm in and out fast on these type trades. Masterrmind...............

--- 帖子 #921 ---
GU [M5] Price starting to move down but I've got to leave the screen for about 10 minutes so no short entry for me at this time. Perhaps someone else can find a short in here somewhere. When I get back I'm hoping to see the cable bouncing around near the 1.30 handle, if so I'll be looking to long it for a handful of pips. Be warned though, plenty can happen in 10 minutes in this business. Half the trouble is the time it takes to post this information to the thread in a timely manner. Masterrmind................

Masterrmind I have just noticed some cunning tweak's you have made to your Octave Settings and the Addition of more use of ADR , to be honest I think it makes a little more interesting to use a 2 day grid and looking at my GU chart it as tremendous potential for accurate scalping, taking level to level moves and watching the range expand , to me this is a great help with the new ESMA rules as it only requires I guess about a 15 pip ish stop for a 1;1 risk reward trade, after say good work. I have enclosed my GU chart with your setting, looks very good, as I trade very similar but have my own way to actually enter a trade I always use either a 15 or 30 pip grid ps my Open will be slightly different as its the UK

--- 帖子 #928 ---
You are right with the 15 to 30 pip octive gap seams like a reasonable target to try and hit on an intraday scale. 2 days is only a first pass, some pairs might need more days of data. Created a custom Candle Range indicator Attached Image (click to enlarge) I will look over the ADR values shown in red color at the bottom of the GProMML settings leftside. Might be better to have an ADR% range remaning for the rest of the current day, show pips and % already covered etc. Note that the MML Grid is shown starting at commencement of day however, the MML levels are calculated on the P value shown to the left which in this case is 574 bars which is about 2 days of price data on an M5 TF.

Dave it is a good question a) note that you can observe - a "positive" correlation for EUR / USD and GBP /USD - a "negative" correlation for USD / CAD and AUD / USD it would be interesting to check with CAD / USD pair and USD / AUD pair b) your terminology of congestion area is the exact one Wyckoff uses Accumulation and Distribution but you can only define the term after the fact Up or Down. Obviously you can guess, have a feeling , an opinion on the direction of the Trend, but you need to use other tools for that. c) to estimate the probability of a breakout of a Congestion Area - cycles are useful to forecast an estimated time zone. to forecast the direction of the breakout cycles and derivated tools are also useful - VTL, Underlying trend, Centered Moving Averages crossings ( ) , FLD's

Thank you MasterMind, Does the WARNING about the Octive Gap means that the price will go down? Thank you so much for your Insight... Jeff

--- 帖子 #937 ---
No unfortunately not. It is a simple alert that allows a trader to monitor octive gap pips. If you set the warning level to 30 pips in the indi settings then an alert will activate in the case where your octive gap is only 15.3 pips. It does not have anything to do with direction. To deactivate simply set == False OR modify the minimum alert level as you wish. Masterrmind.............

Next cycle started on the MTTTM-Test 2 Lev25 demo test account. Equity curve now started to head up. Risk per trade increased by 0.2% making each trades risk 1.2%. Only 3 pairs (TS Order 1) are traded on this account EU, GU and EG due mainly to lower start capital of 3K and only maximum of 25:1 leverage. Start Risk set at 1% per trade (3% over all 3 trades if all active) Lot step on a net positive cycle is set at +0.2% Lot step on a net negative cycle is set at -0.4% Max Risk set at 5% per trade (15% over all 3 trades if all active) The progress of net cycle gains will dictate what risk per trade is applied on the next cycle of trades. Clearly the motivation here is to produce net positive cycles of trades and reach Max risk per trade level as this translates into a favorable ECurve. The drawback to this approach is the timing of a losing cycle of trades closer to the Max risk per trade level creating a 'deep' pullback in the ECurve. Lets see if we can at least get to 5% risk per trade in the first place noting that on each consecutive net positive cycle of trades the next cycle only increases by 0.2% and any losing cycle will rip 0.4% away from the risk per trade value applied. Example: ALL WINNING CYCLES Start risk per trade = 1% Cycle 1 @ 1.0% Outcome was a win; next cycle + 0.2% Cycle 2 @ 1.2% Outcome was a win; next cycle + 0.2% Cycle 3 @ 1.4% Outcome was a win; next cycle + 0.2% Cycle 4 @ 1.6% Outcome was a win; next cycle + 0.2% Cycle 5 @ 1.8% Outcome was a win; next cycle + 0.2% Cycle 6 @ 2.0% Outcome was a win; next cycle + 0.2% Cycle 7 @ 2.2% Outcome was a win; next cycle + 0.2% Cycle 8 @ 2.4% Outcome was a win; next cycle + 0.2% Cycle 9 @ 2.6% Outcome was a win; next cycle + 0.2% Cycle 10 @ 2.8% Outcome was a win; next cycle + 0.2% Cycle 11 @ 3.0% Outcome was a win; next cycle + 0.2% Cycle 12@ 3.2% Outcome was a win; next cycle + 0.2% Cycle 13 @ 3.4% Outcome was a win; next cycle + 0.2% Cycle 14 @ 3.6% Outcome was a win; next cycle + 0.2% Cycle 15 @ 3.8% Outcome was a win; next cycle + 0.2% Cycle 16 @ 4.0% Outcome was a win; next cycle + 0.2% Cycle 17 @ 4.2% Outcome was a win; next cycle + 0.2% Cycle 18 @ 4.4% Outcome was a win; next cycle + 0.2% Cycle 19 @ 4.6% Outcome was a win; next cycle + 0.2% Cycle 20 @ 4.8% Outcome was a win; next cycle + 0.2% Cycle 21 @ 5.0% Outcome was a win; next cycle + 0% ( Max risk per trade reached! ) MTTTM-Test 2 Lev25 demo account cycle progress to date: Cycle 1 @ 1.0% Outcome was a loss; next cycle - 0.4% Cycle 2 @ 0.6% Outcome was a win; next cycle + 0.2% Cycle 3 @ 0.8% Outcome was a win; next cycle + 0.2% Cycle 4 @ 1.0% Outcome was a win; next cycle + 0.2% Cycle 5 @ 1.2% Outcome ....... pending ........ If no loss had occurred on the first cycle the current risk per trade would have been at 1.8% instead of 1.2%. This means that risk per trade now lags behing the 'perfect winning model' by 3 net positive cycles and this will remain the case provided all future cycles are now all winners. Which is unlikely based on an historical analysis of the typical flow of cycle outcomes (Win Vs Loss ratio analysis). The bottom line is that its not easy hitting the 5% risk per trade level but if reached it shows that the MTTTM system should be able to handle it. Although you would need to consider the flow of cycle wins versus cycle losses beyond the first 5% level and how cycle outcomes unfold noting that 5% is the Max level and all future cycles will be at this level until a losing cycle occurs then its a drop to 4.6% (-0.4% step). A word of caution: It is one thing to hit the 5% Max risk per trade level but the impact of a losing cycle will be felt rather hard if on multiple cycles a trades full target has not been hit such as when trades are cut short for relatively smaller profit. Some trades will need to be cut short but you need to keep track of this over the longer term or a loss at a higher risk per trade level will hurt more. Masterrmind.............

Gentlemen (and ladies I presume . . .) I am in the midst of considerable reading over Mr. Murrey, his Math Lines and associated ideas. I have browsed these things before but not in sufficient depth to get things to stick for me. That was then, this is now. Perhaps Rosetta Stone is (much) too strong but MML related ideas do seem to explain price behavior and action, and even suggest future movement, more than reasonably well. Certainly the insiders will throw assorted surprises and, as parisboy suggests, we would all need to accept periodic modest losses as they do. Of course, and fair enough. I am simultaneously looking over the several (dead as well as very alive) forums to harvest useful knowledge but expect and hope to be a participant here primarily, although I am not especially comfortable with TFs under 60. Let me just start off with a hearty 'thank you' to Masterrmind for sharing so much and to OAPDave and parisboy for your regular contributions. I am kind of at a place where I am asking myself why many more are not here, but Forex Factory is a large emporium offering many products (of dubious value) and all attract some. I wish a wonderful weekend to all. The learning continues. With very best regards, FS

--- 帖子 #941 ---
Wondering a bit about the Circles of Conflict. Seems major when reading materials from TH Murrey site but seldom appearing on anything to do with forex. I think maybe xard777 did show them way back, and he seems well respected. Xcalibur wrote, "Circles of Conflict are great future zones of potential action." Perhaps this related more specifically to higher TFs. Curious about your thoughts, though. In the beginning I sense one should focus on -1,0,1 as long only (obviously) and +1,8,7 for shorts perhaps adding price entering at 3/8 with a target around 5/8 (and vice versa). Anything else you would suggest focusing on . . . ? I think I need to take things one trade at a time as I get grounded in MML working up to TS order 1 (3 pair). Spent time looking especially at H4 over the weekend, off TF here I understand, but examining movement from typically OB or OS levels mentioned above. Pretty consistent across a variety of pairs it seems. Certainly, working in MTF seems pretty essential here so as not to get a big surprise on a lower TF.

--- 帖子 #942 ---
I certainly don't get too involved here with the Circles of Conflict mainly due to the following: a) high level of dicretion involved b) no 'real' MT4 drawing solution for the CofC and c) no update as to the yearly restart date which occurs in early October YoY. Ofcourse getting hold of the yearly Oct start date is only a matter of viewing a current Murrey chart but then there is the issue of either sourcing an MT4 or MT5 indicator that can accurately draw the Circle of Conflicts or coding it myself. Personally I would not want to use MT4 for the drawing platform, there are far far better choices out there. The other issue is if I do code it up on a very different platform I will have a string of requests asking for an MT4 version. In any case I really am unsure as to the value of these CofC's and the coding exercise is likely to be a little time consuming and time is tied up in other trading responsibilities and software development projects at this stage. Another option is to become a Murrey subscriber and get the charts as per their software (I am not recommending this by the way). Please do your own due diligence in this space .... highly recommend that each trader is very thorough in their choice. OAPDave has such a subscription (I do not). So in short what I use is the MML indicator initially coded by Vladislav Goshkov (circa 2004) and modify the code to suit my purposes such as additional functionality, parameters, setting a fixed start date, over-riding the MML line calculations so I can set static High and Low price levels etc. I only use the MML levels from that indicator without any reference to the Circles of Conflict. There are a few coders who have given the Circle of Conflict an MT4 attempt but I'm not sure any were successful, perhaps some advanced quite well only to resort to a private development (who knows ?). MML Entry Zones: I apply the upper and lower extreme zones for potential entries as you are well aware. But it also makes good sense to actually look for setups at the 7/8-8/8 and 0/8-1/8 zones since the MML Grid is actually from 0/8 to 8/8. The extreme zones comprised of 2 octives above and below those mentioned above is simply my approach to get into a reversal type setup at a better price but everything here is highly relative, the P value applied and the TF its used on are all relative. What you are suggesting with MTF approach is a solid logical idea and this has been referred too in this thread as well as a few others. In fact I also use the MML Grid approach as part of the Quad Candle System (D1 priority) but have taken some shorter term cycles on say an M15 TF that are within say 1 to 2 octives of the D1 chart which equates to faster gains over a smaller price range (LTF mated to HTF). I would suggest trading between 1 to 2 octives (HTF) using a lower TF chart so what you could do is open a D1 with P=64, locate a zone of interest of 1 to 2 octives, note the upper and lower price boundaries and then step down to any LTF chart and trade within these 2 levels. You will have to find the LTF MML settings that align with the HTF chart settings but this is not that difficult, some trial and error approach will get you there or simply realize how many bars a 64 day period eqautes to on the lower TF of your choice. For example, a full day of data on the M1 TF is 1440 by 1 minute bars (2 days is 2880 etc etc). Then if the TF is say M15 you will know how to find how mnay M15 bars make up 1 day of data ... 64 days will be elementary (__ * 64). Or you can start with 86400 which is the number of seconds in a day and use this for the calculations. M1 TF example: 86400 = number of seconds in 1 Day 60 = number of seconds in M1 bar M1 bars (per 1Day) = 86400/60 = 1440. M15 TF example: 86400 = secs in a day 60*15 = 900 = secs in an M15 bar M15 bars (per 1Day) = 86400/900 = 96. H1 TF example: 86400 = secs in a day 60*60 = 3600 = secs in an H1 bar H1 bars (per 1Day) = 86400/3600 = 24. [Check: Does a day have 24 hours in it ... if yes then you know your calcs are right]. Similarly for all other TFs of interest. In the MML indicator note the MMPeriod input parameter, apply values of 60 (or other values) and notice how the MML levels may change. HTF MML trading is certainly a good way to go and you have mentioned a key observation here namely the consistency. The MTTTM method has been a somewhat mechanical triangulated trading approach but it does not have to be. It is up to the trader to experiment with other ideas and see what happens. A great project would be for a trader/coder to develop an automated trading system mainly so that the MTTTM approach can be analyzed over any amount of data across any number of pairs. Backtesting has its benefits and its drawbacks ofcourse so you must keep an open mind and realize that real market data is very likely to shift/skew the results perhaps more than a little but at least the analysis provides plenty of clues, the clues can lead to fewer losses in some cases and at the end of the day at least you will have some idea as to how likely the trading strategy is in surviving in the harsh real market. I've already coded an MT5 EA which trades MTTTM and QCS over multiple pairs (9 currently with easy option to add in as mnay as you like). Testing continues........... If its a highly mechanical trading approach then ideally an EA should be coded so it can test multiple scenarios much much faster than a human ever could. If its a discretionary trading approach then better the trader applies it by him/her self. Good news though is that you can easily test out HTF MTTTM setups as I'm currently doing on the H1 TF but you can use H4 or D1 if that suits you better just understand that as the TF increases the applied lots will typically decrease based on your available Equity ofcourse. Feel free to share your ideas and post your setups to this thread or the QCS thread (if its D1 trading). Good trading, Masterrmind.............

Hi guys, it saddens my to say that after all these years of trying to understand the workings of Murrey that I cannot recommend that anyone pays for a subscription or indeed part with any money for the End Of Day Software, Every year is the same and this year is no exception, as I type, still not had my licence renewal for the current year, obviously my current version does not now work, the so called back office is a complete shambles, the worst I have ever had to deal with, in fact no matter how many e-mails you send you just never get a reply. p.s. Upset and disappointed ex Murrey user OAPDave

Forest-Sea I am working with "Murrey's" methodology since 1998. I tried to read on the web ALL what was written on this methodology (or related to). In 20 years I never found something relative to the Circles of Conflict used for Analysis and / or Trading. I am the only guy I know who posts on all his Excel charts "Circles of Conflict" it is an old habit - the real question is : is it useful in a way or another for analysis, for trading ? it is mainly descriptive of Price Action after the fact You can describe Circles of Conflict as "Hard Zones" "Energy Zones" which can be attractive or repulsive according to the polarization (that you can not forecast before)

Parisboy, you are up there with the best of the best, so can I ask the question about the Murrey so called Start of the new 256 day Cycle ( October ?) is it real and important or just a marketing ploy

--- 帖子 #947 ---
Dave I need to check in my archives what I have on the subject. Anyway there is no logical relations between Murrey's birthday's date and Price Action . It is just pure megalomany of someone who ended up describing himself as the "new Gann" and even better than Gann The division of Time in quarter is logical according to Gann methodology. Basically the first research on the subject was linked with Commodities (Wheat, Soja, Cotton, Metals, etc) then the 4 Seasons influence (or not) then "Cycles" Hence the same tools were used for industrial products and consequently average shares. Experience showed me that you can use Gann tools with "success" (efficient operative results) : - (Angles (Diagonal Lines), - Circles of Conflict (Crossing of Horizontal and Vertical Lines) - and MML's (Horizontal Gann Lines) whatever your starting point is. For example such tools work very well on the 30 DAX components even if Yahoo data begin most of the time 1st March 2000. The Gann/Murrey system works also efficiently with "newborn" corporations for example Facebook , Twitter, Tesla etc

Forest-Sea hereunder you will find what Tim Kruzel wrote on the "Circles of Conflict" Circles of Conflict The circles of conflict are a by product of the properties of the horizontal MML's that divide price and vertical time lines (VTL's) that divide time. MML's represent points of support and resistance. VTL's represent reversal points. Put it all together and the result is the "circles of conflict". Consider a square in time divided into eight price intervals and eight time intervals. The five circles of conflict are centered on the 2/8 th's, 4/8 th's, and the 6/8 th's MML's and the 2/8 th's, 4/8 th's, and 6/8 th's VTL's. Recall that prices spend 40% of their time between the 3/8 th's and 5/8 th's MML's. Recall also that the 2/8 th's, 4/8 th's, and 6/8 th's MML's represent strong points of support and resistance. If we can assume that the 2/8 th's, 4/8 th's, and 6/8 th's VTL's represent strong points of reversal, we can expect that in slow trendless markets that prices will be deflected around the circles of conflict. In a fast up or down market prices will move through the circles quickly since the price momentum exists to penetrate support and resistance lines. The circles of conflict are an example of the value of a standard reference frame (square in time) in divining market action. This reference frame and its associated geometry and rules can be applied to all price-time scales in all markets.

Dave hereunder some thoughts of Tim Kruzel on Time and on the Starting Date Time The term "square in time" has been used liberally throughout the prior discussions without any specific statements regarding time. All that has been addressed so far is the vertical price dimension of the square in time. This is justified since the process of identifying the MML's and MMI's requires a little more effort than the divisions of time. The fact that less discussion has been devoted to the time dimension should not be interpreted to mean that the time dimension is any less important than the price dimension. Time and price are equally important. Time is divided up in a very reasonable (and practical manner). The year is broken into quarters of 64 trading days each. Note that 64 is a power of 2 (i.e. (2 x 2 x 2) x (2 x 2 x 2) = 8 x 8 = 64). An interval of 64 can easily be subdivided into half intervals. Note that 8 (the number of vertical intervals in the square in time) is also a power of 2 (i.e. (2 x 2 x 2) = 8). Thus, the square in time can easily be scaled in both the price (vertical) and the time (horizontal) dimensions simply by multiplying or dividing by 2 (very clever). Consider also that a year consists of four quarters. Four is also a power of 2. So, a square in time based upon a year long scale can also easily be subdivided. The ability to subdivide the square in time gives the square in time the ability to evolve as an entity trades through time. The square in time acts as a reference frame (coordinate system) that can adjust itself as needed. As an entity reaches new high or low prices, the reference frame can be expanded by doubling the square in both the price and time dimensions. Alternatively, if one wishes to look at the price of an entity during some short time frame one can simply halve the square in both the price and time dimensions (resulting in a quarter square). This halving and doubling may be carried out to whatever degree is practical (i.e. Practical within the limits of how much price and time data may be subdivided. A daily chart can't be subdivided into intraday prices or time). Refer back to the description of the rectangular fractal at the beginning of this paper. The argument for breaking the year into quarters intuitively makes sense. The business world (including mutual fund managers) is measured on a quarterly basis. Each of the four quarters roughly correspond to the four seasons of the year which drive weather and agriculture (as well as commodity contracts). Clearly humans are geared to a quarterly cycle. Murrey resets the time = 0 point on an annual basis. This is done the first week of October and corresponds to the day of the U.S. Treasury's monthly and quarterly bond auctions (This year 10/8/97). Once the time = 0 point is set one may simply count off daily increments of 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64 days relative to the time = 0 point to set the desired square in time (or 256 days if one wants an annual chart). At this point one should realize that specifying a time interval is critical to setting up the square in time. In the above examples that were used to illustrate the selection of MML's and MMI's the time frame was implied. All that was specified in the examples was the price range that the entity traded at. Naturally, one has to ask the question, "The price range it traded at during what time frame?". One will probably want to set up the square in time for annual and quarterly time frames. The quarterly square in time will probably be subdivided into a 16 day time frame for intermediate term trading. One would need intraday data to set up an intraday square in time. The time coordinate of an intraday chart is simply divided into 4 or 8 uniform intervals. The intraday MML's and MMI's are then set up using the intraday trading range. If one is looking at a weekly chart then a quarter should consist of 13 weeks. Another key use of the time dimension is estimating when a trend in price will reverse itself. The horizontal MML's of a square in time represent points of support and resistance in the price dimension. The vertical lines that divide the square in the time dimension represent likely trend reversal points. My own personal studies, done on the DJIA, showed that on average the DJIA has a turning point every 2.5 days. Since we know that the market does not move in a straight line we would expect to see frequent trend reversals. Murrey uses the vertical time lines (1/8 th lines) in the square to signal trend reversals.

Dave , for your information an old message from a former Murrey discussion group If you are concerned about price levels they are unaffected by the start date. As for the time lines, you might be interested in the following which are portions of two messages from Bonnie Hill (her website is http://home.flash.net/~blhill/pages/murrey.html ). Bill I need to give a little history of "Murrey Math". "Murrey Math" is based on a course written by W D Gann. When Murrey put his mother into a rest home, he found the course when he cleaned out her house. He used this material as the basis for "Murrey Math". In the early days, Murrey gave Gann credit for the material. As the years passed, Murrey has "forgotten" where the ideas came from :-) There are several ideas in the course which Murrey did NOT understand correctly. That is why some of the techniques seem great and some seem a little "strange". The starting point for the 4th quarter is actually the midpoint between the Earth's perihelion and aphelion. This date is approximately October 2nd. The date can be shifted due to trading days or lunar aspects (Full/New Moons, etc) which occur close to this date. Murrey's "birthday, etc" is pure nonsense. If you have a copy of this particular Gann course you know EXACTLY where "Murrey Math" came from. I have "Murrey Math" charts which I drew over 10 years before I ever saw the "Murrey Math" manual :-) Best wishes, Bonnie Lee Hill Dave, you have to note that Bonnie Hill : - does NOT indicate which "particular" Gann Course it is, where to find or buy it - does NOT explain WHY the "starting point" should be at the beginning of October - does not explain what are the " several ideas in the course which Murrey did NOT understand correctly."

Dave, another post of my archives from a guy who obviously gave at that time a lot of thoughts on the subject "Start of the New Cycle" I think the start date is important. FOM is just giving out some flack since nobody is recognizing the true elements of the discussion. Of course, if the start date is wrong, then it won't be very important, obviously. But, get it right and the results are quite impressive, enough so that it is worth the effort to set it properly. First, to counteract some of the FOM sarcasm recently: (FOM) was the abbreviation of a poster named Friend of Murrey, very aggressive towards the others and always bragging on how Murrey was a genius. Most guys suspected it was Murrey himself) I. The Start Date DOES RESET every year in October. II. The Start DATE IS IMPORTANT. Check how many significant turns occur within +/-4 trading days of the start of any of the 64 bar frames. III. It is not related to the first frost or Murrey's birthday Although both may be close to the date, this is just fluff to conceal the true origin of the date. I have been testing a proposed start date algorithm for a little while, and I think that it would explain Murrey's start dates for the most part. It may not be perfect, but certainly seems close. It also seems to agree with most of Murrey's nuggets of wisdom along the way. Murrey Points to Keep in Mind: 1. It is related to the harvest moon somehow. 2. It is related to multiples of 4 trading days. 3. It should be in the first week of October each year. 4. Once set, the count remains fixed until the next October. Note, Point #4 was the fooler because some earlier versions of Murrey's EOD program had some bugs related to the date which caused it to slide up or back 1 or 2 days at times, which clouded this issue, even though Murrey would state that the count did not adjust mid-year. But, close examination of Murrey's Trader's World articles shows that this date should not be changed once set until the next October. Proposed Start Date Algorithm: 1. Take the first full moon which is on or after Sep 21 as the HARVEST MOON and denote that date as the anchor for the count. 2. If the full moon occurs earlier than 12:45 ET, then back up 1 calendar day and call that the anchor. Note, that +8 trading days from this anchor date must be October 1st or later. If the September full moon is not within +8 trading days, you must switch to the October full moon as the anchor. 3. In cases of weekend anchor dates, ALWAYS round BACK not FORWARDS. The trading frame dates tend to creep larger over the year, since there are only 252-253 trading days a year, but 256 trading dates in 4 64-bar frames. So, we would always want to round back, not forwards, since the tendency would be to move farther ahead of the actual year, not behind it. 3. If the anchor date is in September, then count either +4 trading days or +8 trading days until reaching a date in October. This date then becomes the year's start date. 4. If the anchor date is in October, then count either 0 trading days, -4 trading days, or -8 trading days until reaching a date which is October 7 or earlier. Examples: 1. 2002-2003 Start Date: Full Moon = Sept. 21 09:59 ET. Because it is before 12:45 ET, back up 1 calendar day. Anchor Date = Sept. 20, 2002. Add 8 trading days = Oct. 2, 2002 ( Murrey Math Start Date ). 2. 2001-2002 Start Date: Full Moon = Oct. 2 09:49 ET. Because it is before 12:45 ET, back up 1 calendar day. Anchor Date = Oct. 1, 2001. ( Murrey Math Start Date ). 3. 2000-2001 Start Date: Full Moon = Oct. 13 04:53 ET. Because it is before 12:45 ET, back up 1 calendar day. Anchor Date = Oct. 12, 2000. Subtract 4 trading days = Oct. 6, 2000. ** Note, Murrey's start date = Oct. 9, 2000 which is only different by 1 trading day and results from the rounding rule. Backtesting shows that Oct. 6, 2000 shows somewhat better turns, however, so I've stuck with the rounding rules as shown. 4. 1999-2000 Start Date: Full Moon = Sept. 25, 1999 06:51 ET. Because it is before 12:45 ET, back up 1 calendar day. Anchor Date = Sept. 24, 1999. Add 8 trading days = Oct. 6, 1999 ( Murrey Math Start Date. ) 5. 1998-1999 Start Date: Full Moon = Oct. 5, 1998 16:12 ET. No rounding needed. Anchor Date = Oct. 5, 1998 ( Murrey Math Start Date. ) 6. 1997-1998 Start Date: Full Moon = Oct. 15, 1997 23:46 ET. No rounding needed. Anchor Date = Oct. 15, 1997 ( Murrey Math Start Date. ) Subtract 8 trading days = Oct. 3, 1997 ( Murrey Math Start Date. ) 7. 1996-1997 Start Date: Full Moon = Sept. 26, 1996 22:51 ET. No rounding needed. Anchor Date = Sept. 26, 1996 Add 4 trading days = Oct. 2, 1996 ( Murrey Math Start Date. ) 8. 1995-1996 Start Date : Full Moon = Oct. 8, 1995 11:52 ET. Anchor Date = Oct. 7, 1995 ( Saturday ). Back to trading day = Oct. 6, 1995 ( Murrey Math Start Date. ) 9. 1994-1995 Start Date: Full Moon = Oct. 19, 1994 08:18 ET. Anchor Date = Oct. 18, 1994 Subtract 8 trading days = Oct. 6, 1994 ** Note, Murrey Math Start Date = Oct. 7, 1994 (rounding difference) 10. 1993-1994 Start Date: Full Moon = Sept. 30, 1993 14:54 ET. Anchor Date = Sept. 30, 1993 Add 4 trading days = Oct. 6, 1993 11. 1992-1993 Start Date: Full Moon = Oct. 11, 1992 14:03 ET. Anchor Date = Oct. 9, 1992 ( nearest trading day ). Subtract 4 trading days = Oct. 5, 1992 12. 1991-1992 Start Date: Full Moon = Sept. 23, 1991 18:40 ET. Anchor Date = Sept. 23, 1991 Add 8 trading days = Oct. 3, 1991 13. 1990-1991 Start Date: Full Moon = Oct. 4, 1990 08:02 ET. Anchor Date = Oct. 3, 1990 Start Date = Oct. 3, 1990 14. 1989-1990 Start Date: Full Moon = Oct. 14, 1989 16:32 ET. Anchor Date = Oct. 13, 1989 Subtract 8 trading days = Oct. 3, 1989 15. 1988-1989 Start Date : Full Moon = Sept. 25, 1988 15:07 ET. Anchor Date = Sept. 23, 1988 Add 8 trading days = Oct. 5, 1988 16. 1987-1988 Start Date: Full Moon = Oct. 7, 1987 00:12 ET. Anchor Date = Oct. 6, 1987 Start Date = Oct. 6, 1987 FUTURE START DATES: 1. 2003 Start Date Full Moon = Oct. 10, 2003 03:27 ET. Anchor Date = Oct. 9, 2003 Subtract 4 trading days = Oct. 3, 2003. 2. 2004 Start Date Full Moon = Sept. 28, 2004 09:09 ET. Anchor Date = Sept. 27, 2004 Add 4 trading days = Oct. 1, 2004 3. 2005 Start Date Full Moon = Oct. 17, 2005 08:14 ET. Anchor Date = Oct. 14, 2005 Subtract 8 trading days = Oct. 4, 2005. So, what do you think FOM? Pretty close, or all wet... PS 32-bar 2/8 time date coming Monday, expect stall of up move for 1-2 days here. Good Trading, Mike

All "Murrey's Maths" developments (at least most of them) are based on Tim Kruzel notes widely available on the net.. Murrrey's book is rarely quoted by users. I assume that very few people have read it or own it. The following post from a developper/programmer (2002) is for your information : I had direct interchanges with Tim some 18 months to 2 years ago and noted or recall the following: 1) his widely disseminated notes were a rough draft; Tim Kruzel never intended for them to "get out" - that just kind of happened after he posted his e-mail to THM. 2) The process defined in Tim Kruzel's notes was a pretty good start; but is by no means the "right way" and (as Kruzel says) there are fundamental flaws. 3) Tim Kruzel AMM.EXE program uses later revision(s) of the algorithm. His metastock code is somewhere between the "notes" and "AMM". 4) Tim Kruzel's work past AMM.EXE; never made public or put into a program except for his own use. 5) Tim Kruzel doesn't trade exclusively on Murrey Math. 6) XChartMM is not "Kruzel's notes" applied graphically; I too started with his notes but quickly found they were not right (as Tim confirmed). Then I started to work, got a clue or two from Tim, and some time later, well, here we are. But, only Murrey knows Murrey's actual algorithm! Tim doesn't know it, I don't know it. 7) There are a lot of "MM add-ons" in use for tradestation, metastock, this &amp; that; most of them are 100% based on Kruzel's rough draft notes (which are not right as we already discussed and Kruzel confirmed). Hence, there are a lot of frustrated people out there who say "Murrey's stuff doesn't work". It's not "Murrey's stuff" unless you have Murrey's actual stuff!! Go to his classes and use his software to get the "real thing"! This isn't an advert for THM either! It is "what is", plain and simple. Note that nor Tim nor the programmer explain us what is the correct way to use "Murrey' Maths" and what are the " fundamental flaws " of Tim Kruzel's notes which are widely disseminated Then we are on our own !

Dave according the "rules" / algorithm of this guy it seems the correct date

--- 帖子 #957 ---
But, only Murrey knows Murrey's actual algorithm! Tim doesn't know it, I don't know it. It is just incorrect .... because Murrey has IMHO NO ALGORITHM. ! a) Murrey has no programming ability b) Murrey lives in Nashville (Tennessee) c) The developper of Murrey's software (Krystof Werling) lived in Germany at the time. d) Murrey is a disorganised person proof is in the book he wrote, in his articles, in his behaviour with customers etc. IMHO I am not sure he understands the rigourousness and work necessary to develop a trading software program. e) when you live in Nashville Tennessee why choosing a german guy living in Germany to develop your software - stange isn't it ? f) remember that it was at the end of the 90's - we had no Skype, no Webinar possibilities etc - expensive foreign calls etc then Murrey explains something to Wherling who programs it - ???? I am quite sure that Masterrmind can appreciate the obvious difficulties and possible flaws of such a procedure.

I will not worry any further about Circles . . . experienced traders such as the three of you have made your way successfully for years without (or minimally with) them. Your second extracted quote is another matter. This was a real 'ah ha' moment for me. What you say seems SO obvious once read, but I did not see it myself even while thinking on MTF issues and MML. So many thanks on pointing this out. I was experimenting with D1, H4 and H1 and even a bit of M15, but this makes terrific sense to me. I was taking slices of D1 down but the use of just two octaves for something less than H1 make great logic to me. As they say in the martial arts movies, "bow to your sensei!" Consider it done.

Yes in fairness to the Murrey Math approach you are right as I have also mentioned before, that if you have not taken the real Murrey Math course and purchased the Murrey Math software and understood it to a very high level then you can have no real authority on Murrey Math Trading System. I fit into the class of traders that does NOT have any authority on Murrey Math trading. As far as the approach taken here in the MTTTM method is concerned I apply a simple almost mechanical approach using the MML levels (originally coded by Vladislav Goshkov in 2004) as entry, SL and Target levels applying a simple and favorable reward to risk ratio of 4 to 1. Ofcourse there have been multiple indicators coded before, during and after this period using a variety of different source codes. I have now extended the functionality of the MML indicator to have the ability of applying EOD data or setting "Trading Frame" high and low prices based on personal preference of observable swings on a given chart. But this has very little to do with trading Murrey Math and that's how I like it. What I do like is the Gann 1/8th's where the swing high to swing low major octive is broken up into smaller octives, then based on trading TF preference and associated ranges one can simply then reduce any octive into another range of 8 mini octives. I give all credit to Gann for the octives and certainly NOT Murrey. Afterall, it is obvious that Murrey used what he could understand of Gann methodology but with plenty that is clearly not understood. I think that exploring Murrey or indeed Gann to the last drop of knowledge is perhaps more inline with an 'academic' approach. If traders feel the need to take on an academic approach then by all means study it but understand that at the end of day what really matters is a trading methodology that is easy to understand, easy to apply, is reduced to its most basic elements and shows a longer term consistent gain at a respectable drawdown ! Masterrmind.............

--- 帖子 #965 ---
Yes absolutely agree. Although I do not claim to be a Murrey Math authority (nor would I want to be) I have studied his available material in great depth including all available algorithms that are easily accessible online (at least these days they are unlike in the past) but came to the same conclusion as you a long long time ago; there are far too many inconsistencies for my liking. And more than a few mysteries to boot. I probably should not make any reference to Murrey at all especially in this thread because as I say it has nothing to do with Murrey Trading approach at all its simply the use of the term 'MML'. Nevertheless, the MML indicator does a reasonable job of printing out the Murrey horizontal lines to the chart and when comparing them to OAPDaves Murrey software charts they are usually spot on in terms of price levels however, they are also at times a half or a double octave in difference. But I've spent some time recently addressing this issue and discovered the reason for the difference. I only apply and use the 13 lines comprised of a 'Trading Frame' with OB and OS zones ! As for the VTL's well you need the correct Oct yearly reset date otherwise the turning points might be based on some other type of mystery. Why not make life simple and start the next cycle on the next trading day say Monday (Sunday for USA) after the Full Moon. Start of a new trading week and 'energized' from the occurrence of the Full Moon ... hihi. Take a look at the 2019 Full Moon it will occur on Sept 14 (12:37am) or Oct 13 (5:07pm) of that year. Almost mid-month which to me is forcing an out-of-sync reset date in Oct 2019 because you are either 2 weeks too soon or 2 weeks too late. In any case as traders we can use our own brains and choose something 'we' think is a little more rational. That is ofcourse if we are to use VTL's in our trading ... some of us certainly will not be while others will look at it from an interest point of view. Flaws in Murrey approach ? ............ Yes. Masterrmind.............

--- 帖子 #966 ---
Flaws to every approach Hmmmmmm I am not going to try and say Murrey as hit upon the Holy Grail, far from it, but if you take a little time to think about it, he is always right. Why do I say this, easy , he does a chart shift when he is wrong, as Parisboy would say think Russian Dolls, so in my humble opinion you must look at more than one Octave setting when deciding to trade from a smaller time frame OB/OS area, in short, chart shifts are telling you if a trend is in place. I keep reading Buy low Sell high, Buy support Sell resistance, sounds easy, well is it really, so what magic time frame gives these levels that never fail, all Murrey is to me, is just a grid, just like any Pivot or Fib type Method when its wrong it re draws and that means that if you are on the wrong side of a trend you will get badly burned. In short each phase of a market be it trending or sideways needs a slightly different approach, that applies to what you expect out of you trade 10 pips or hundreds of pips. I will leave it there as I could waffle on longer, but I will see what response that gets first

--- 帖子 #971 ---
Putting everything into perspective is the key, no doubt about it. The trouble with chart shifts is that they do nothing at all for your stops. Once again reward to risk ratio raises its head and is especially important if strike rate is low. A trader in the market is very much like a small sail boat floating around in a vast ocean. Easily manipulated by the first strong wind that arrives and in the case of a storm more than likely smashed into the nearest reef. No TF provides a bulletproof level of S or R. S&amp;R zones get constantly broken every day of the trading week, we know this because we observe it on our charts over any number of currency pairs, stocks, indices, commodities, what have you they get broken day in day out. MTF analysis simply offers a higher level of confidence or confluence allowing us to speculate with what we think is a little more certainty. The issue of trending and ranging market conditions will likely go on forever, its almost impossible to tell at which stage the market is in at any given TF you care to analyze. Its very much a game of probabilities ... our attempt to gain more than the risk we applied. Yet we continue to search for the holy grail of trading ... Masterrmind.............

Bravo! This really seems the essence of what we are all trying to do (and the three of you have clearly admirably succeeded) My question for the moment is where to enter with attention to breaking down the major octave to 8 minor octaves . . . Since any MML is defined (I think) as extending up or down from the actual line by up to 1/2 the distance to the next line, so we have a range of sorts for each MML. It is tempting, using old habits, to wait for PA to show itself in this zone for continuation or reversal. Would any of you care to share thinking on where to make the actual entry? Right on the MML is easy and attractive but by observation price is more likely to reverse somewhat above or below. In fairness, this should be easily in an allowed area without stopping out. I'm sure this seems very elementary to you all, but using Gann/Murrey concepts is different enough to justify asking such questions (I think). Of course, I am mindful of not adding lagging indicators, but I understand I am effectively adding some mental lag into my decision making. FS

Yes, Mini octave within Larger Octave

--- 帖子 #975 ---
Afternoon to you OAPDave. Wondering what the 'wants to reverse off' means at the bottom of the xard777 box in the upper left of your screen. Reverse off a move of 122 pips . . . ? Is this of value?

--- 帖子 #976 ---
Now what do you see ?

--- 帖子 #977 ---
OAPDave, I have a mini-octave sitting side by side with a D1 octave. The 8 small ones = a single D1. However, I am wondering how you superimposed your smaller ones on the larger? I am getting the same info but I like the convenience of both on the same larger chart. Could you help me on this?

--- 帖子 #978 ---
One approach is to observe PA in and around these MML levels and get a 'feel' for what is likely to occur. This takes plenty of chart time but its worth it. There is nothing wrong with applying PA, in fact I apply it very frequently in much of my private trading. The MTTTM approach has been very mechanical and on purpose so that traders can get a feel for taking entries from MML lines and using MML lines for stops as well as targets. The next step is to get to the stage where you feel more confident about making an entry from or near an MML level or zone. But PA will also let you down at times because the market will do some 'unorthodox' moves from time to time. They are not really unorthodox moves because there really is a reason for every move in the market. But neither you nor I nor any person knows exactly when such a curve ball move is likely to occur. Therefore, all traders lag behind the market most of the time. All we are trying to do is to tag along with a move and take a little piece of it, the larger the TF the more a trader is likely to take. With the MML levels, quite often they give very good levels of S&amp;R but also times when Grids are reset and our stops get taken. Its all part of the game and this is why I harp on so much about bulding up the confidence to trade the HTF's and trade with a favorable RR. If you can manage your capital it will go along way to surviving the rollercoaster rides that the market loves to pump out at times. Masterrmind............

Masterrmind, I think you found the right word : Approach "Murrey's Math" is neither a Methodology nor a Trading System it is an "Approach". We can credit Murrey to have popularized and vulgarized several tools, and concepts Gann has disseminated in his writings during 50 years - the Squaring of Price and Time to show the relationship between both parameters - division by 8 of a Price Action interval generating the Price Horizontal Lines - the division by 8 of the Square by Diagonal Lines generating the Angles showing Price Action Speed and Acceleration - the division by 8 of the Square by Vertical Lines showing the Vertical Time Lines As for Gann we can just notice that he has only detailed his methodology about Angles - this explain why "Gann Angles" are widely build and used in numerous softwares or trading platforms As Gann is most known (among other tools) for his "Angles", Murrey is known for his Murrey Math Lines (MML's) Among others programs I use TradingView and on this platform you can find : Gann Box Gann Square Gann Square fixed Gann Fan (Angles) even if we let aside how they are built and if they are "correctly built" according to what we define as correct for Gann, and if they keep their characteristics with a moving chart, all these tools even used together do not generate a trading system in itself. That is IMHO the main reason you can not program or automatize it. You can not automatize what does not exist. and you can not automatize an "approach" Your M TTT M development is just your way to mechanize (automatize, program) the Gann / Murrey approaches using the MML's as the "bricks" of a trading system trying to answer the basic trading questions : - when and where to enter - when and where to exit - where to place the Stop Loss - how to calculate the Risk Reward Ratio Masterrmind IMHO you are an "authority" on the subject, your threads are the proof. (to follow)

Dave A 2000 discussion on a "Murrey Math software forum" about the programmation of a "chart shift " within Murrey's EOD software. Hope it will help : Brian, At the seminar in Beverly Hills THM talked about how he determined the high and low of the frame .......he said for a 16 day frame he used the range of the last 32 days...and if prices closed past 10/8 or -2/8 he would adjust the frame. He also mentioned something about the prices going past 8/8 and 0/8 for several days to adjust the frame. Steve ...the computer guy was in the front row. I know he is with this group or the other. Also try agent moulder he's good at details. Ron Yes... Murrey says 2X. That's not what the s/w does though. I don't know if Murrey is intentionally misleading the audience or if Werling has done something different than Murrey thinks he has . Bruce I have the feeling that the true answer lies somewhere in between. I think that Murrey's software looks back up to two times the time period chosen and select only the first significant high and low that matter. If there is another significant high and low before the one that it picked, still within the two times the period that was selected, it ignores it. If I had more details I would not say "I have the feeling", but I would say it is. Anyway, my feeling is: - say you set the frame to 16. The software should look back 32 and see what significant highs and lows are present. Based on an algorithm it would then determine what is "significant", and then choose the closest "significant" to the present and drop the one before it, even if the one before is more "significant". Murrey keeps saying that the last high and low are the ones that count. But in fact they have to be significant highs and lows. It does not really matter where they are located, as long as they are the LAST significant high and low. Brian's software now looks at the high and low within the designated period and adds lines based on the highest high and lowest low present in that period. I don't think that is the correct way of doing it. Adding a range finder and then computing the "significant" highs and lows, then choosing the last "significant" high and low are the way to go, IMHO. One should be easily able to compare this thought by comparing the daily charts from Murrey's software and the daily charts with Brian's software. You will probably have to go through fifty or more charts, and see what settings in Brian's software will equate with Murrey's daily chart set, say, at 16 periods. Do not change the periods in Murrey, but change them in Brian's to obtain the same results as in Murrey's. Use charts that have good price excursion. I am planning to do just this as soon as Murrey sends me the latest software that will read data after last December. I hope this explains my "feelings". Cheers. Bijan In recent versions I added the 1.5x &amp; 2.0x multipliers (eg if using a 64 frame, then 2.0x would use the extreme high/low in the last 128 days). A recent post by THM lends credence to using ONLY "natural" or 1x settings though... The public post was dated 2/1/2k and titled "MMTS: OEX Support off current lows: Downside almost over: Reverse soon" he shows the OEX in a 64 frame (8 days per 1/8th time interval). To make XChartMM "match" his graph, the 64 frame setting is used along with the 1x multiplier - eg, NO multiplier. I've heard this from Murrey before. The issue is that his s/w doesn't work that way. Remember that Kristof Werling is the one who created the code and what he's done may not match THM's desires. What the s/w does is 1.5*N+1, even in 64-bar frames. That aside, you have all the bases covered, so it's not a problem. Bruce Wait - what I'm saying is that if Murrey's prog really used 1.5n+1, then the output of his recent OEX graph *should* be different, because the price extremes were larger at 1.5n than at 1.0n. In other words, Murrey's OEX graph contradicts the 1.5n+1 scenario for all intents and purposes Guys, I think this may prove my point that regardless what time frame you put yourself in, the software looks for the most recent "significant" high and low to calculate the frame size. Another chart which implies that 1.5x is the one to use as a general rule (this one is frame size 16). On 1x, the high and low in 16 days do not compute the frame to match THMs output. I agree, Brian. The only thing I've seen besides 1.5X+1 is a shorter display that seems to be reacting to a rule they have about significant lows/highs. The ABTXQ chart does that after a whipsaw in the rally that precedes the displayed portion of the chart. I have to assume the Murrey s/w looks for reversals off intermediate highs and if they're greater than X%, he says it's significant. I don't recall reading about that in the book, but I think it's in the s/w. Bruce Murrey's EOD s/w currently uses a greater number of bars than the frame size to test for significant highs/lows. The number of bars tested is 1.5*N+1 where N is the frame size. So for a 16-bar frame, the number of bars tested for significant high/low is1.5*16+1 = 25 bars. So a 16-bar frame, if allowed to display unassisted, will usually show 25 bars of data, the 32-baar frame will display 49 bars and the 64-bar frame will display 97 bars. Murrey's s/w also has a whipsaw detector (of sorts) that tests to see if a whipsaw is sufficient to constitute a significant high/low. If the detector gets activated, the number of bars displayed will be less than 1.5*N+1. Bruce Pretty simple really. With the frame settings of 4, 8, 16, 32 &amp; 64; the program finds the highest high/lowest low in the last X bars, where X is: on "1x", or natural, frame setting x 1, eg 64 is bars on "1.5x", it is frame setting x 1.5, eg 64 is 64 * 1.5, or 96 bars on "2x", it is frame setting x 2.0, eg 64 is 64 * 2, or 128 bars I personally use the 2x setting, this seems to match Murrey's program output in the majority of cases. Brian Glenn, Don't worry, I've hardly got pretensions about setting up a new trading religion - I'm just groping around for knowledge and understanding. Regarding violation of math rules, I thought it was one of Murrey's rules (underlying premises might be better) that the frame is set by the fractal - the fractal is set by the "relevant" inflection high/low - not highest and/or lowest in the look back period even though this is how the s/w does it. If my understanding and description of the rules is correct (and please correct me if I'm wrong, I'm just new at this game) then its Murrey's s/w that breaks its own rules and premises. Would you like to comment on this? Thanks, Henry. I have been using MM as one of a number of indicators day trading the NAZ e-mini. On balance I find it very useful for exits, not as good for entries. Regards Dimitri With the frame settings of 4, 8, 16, 32 &amp; 64; the program finds the highest high and lowest low in the last X bars to build the frame. For example, using a frame setting of 64, X number of bars back is: - 64 bars on "1x" (or natural) frame setting - 96 bars on "1.5x", (64 * 1.5 = 96 bars) - 128 bars on "2x", (64 * 2 = 128 bars) It is up for some debate as to which one is the correct one to use. Several members have commented (summary of all) "I've never seen any chart from Murrey's s/w that has 2*N bars... only 1.5*N+1 or fewer. Murrey SAYS to use 2*N in his classes, but that's apparently not what his s/w does. You'd have to use the search mode to get that" I personally use the 1.5 setting and it has matched the majority (95% +) of the charts I've seen as output from Murrey's own program. Hope this helps, Brian

found in a former PDF " Murrey Math Rules" Where is the price in relation to the Circles of Conflict? A Is it rolling over it, B Is it curling under it, C Will it move inside it, The Circles of Conflict are electrical and will change polarization at its own will, so trying to figure it out is only as simple as going with the direction it reverses off its center horizontal MMTLines (+ or - baby 1/8ths).

Basically using them you can suspect a polarity point where Trend could change direction

--- 帖子 #988 ---
OAP Dave . . . referencing your chart posted on #986. Are you trading off M1 using MML? (assume yes). Based on the D1 moving to a line as well. I see these are 16 pips / line so very possible to use the M1 for an early entry when the D1 is around one of its 1/8 MMLs. Getting down to small TFs is a little foreign to me but seems to have merit especially if your line ranges are of this size.

--- 帖子 #989 ---
I do not mind traders discussing 'Circles of Conflict' in the MTTTM thread. Just be aware of the following points though: 1. The MTTTM methodology does not use 'Circles of Conflict'; 2. The MTTTM methodology does not adhere to any Murrey Math trading 'approach' whatsoever; 3. Any links or posted information regarding Murrey approach is for educational purposes only and is NOT recommended for MTTTM; 4. The MTTTM thread outlines a 'raw' mechanical trading methodology based on groups of 3 triangulated pairs applying high RR from 13 MML lines; 5. If you assume 'Circles of Conflict' is a Murrey approach then any discussion should have a current Murrey Grid comprised of correct VTL's; In other words, if you are following the 'Circles of Conflict' then you must have access to a correctly drawn Murrey Math Grid with MML horizontal lines and VTL vertical lines at the correct spacings in time and price. If you do not have the above then your discussion is NOT based on the Murrey Grid as per his software (good or bad) and therefore any price action analysis in and around the 'Circles of Conflict' WILL be skewed as well as flawed. Part of getting the analysis 'right' is having the correct Murrey Reset date in October so that all chart analysis is in sync with the Murrey approach. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ I have no interest whatsoever in persuing any further analysis of the Murrey approach because of what I believe are 'mystical' and 'non-sensical' Murrey yearly reset dates. I have come to the understanding that the Murrey Trading Method is flawed to the core and does not warrant any of my time examining it any further. The only part I apply is actually not Murrey at all but rather Gann's use of 1/8ths. Taking a 'significant' High and Low swing on a given chart and dividing the range into 8 equally spaced sections and making trading decisions from any of these zones. I am ok with the current MML price levels that the MML indicator produces because I have analyzed the code in great detail and understand every part of its algorithms even though its highs and lows are slightly reduced from chart Highs and Lows. I do use the MML indicator (Post 1) and some modifications to the code and apply entries, stops and targets at various MML price lines that fit within the MML Grid. Hopefully that clears up any confusion and outlines precisely what is used and what is not. ps. I have no issue with any 'academic' type discussion of the Murrey Trading approach so feel free to post away. Masterrmind.............

It is good that you use MM for what it is. There is a lot wrong with the MM methodology. I bought one of his books around the turn of the century. It was literally a collection of hand written notes that was cheaply bound at the nearest packaging store. The Gann angles were wrongly applied, and there was a LOT of magical thinking going on there. First, he set his reset dates for the Harvest Moon, then, he decided on his birthday, as if either date had anything at all to do with turning points. There were misspelled words everywhere in the text. And the rambling about music and markets I just read as testament to how far down a rabbit hole an egotistical mind can go.

--- 帖子 #991 ---
(emphasis mine) I am intrigued with the MML lines which surely came over from Gann thought. Of course, there are numerous components of Gann and Murrey applications in little to no use by forex people. At this stage, preliminary for me, when I slide off just the 8 equally spaced lines I feel like I am about to burn my hands on hot coals in the unknown. I'm glad the word magical has shown up . . . my mind went to mystical . . . Still, there surely seems to be value, I know you would all agree, in application of the MML even if slightly off. And, obviously, they are not the only lines representing Support and Resistance as we all can see and MM has often marked on his published charts. It seems time for me to say thank you again for helping me learn. Fortunately, I s ee what is being discussed and it makes sense. Hey, maybe resets can be done on MM's birthday . . . just kidding . Best to all! FS

--- 帖子 #992 ---
Agreed ! The sad reality is that it actually gets much much worse than that. As I've also mentioned in posts long ago, the Gann angles that Murrey draws are incorrect. However, I suppose they are simply Murrey angles. I have no doubt which ones I prefer to apply ... and they do not start with the letter 'M'. And the reset date, Frosty this and frosty that, birthday here and a birthday there, Full Moon here and 4 or 8 day shifts added here and there just so it magically fits close to the start of October. Somebody stop me quick, the laughter is killing me. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ In any case I, Masterrmind am currently devising a reset date for the: MTTTM PROTRADING FRAME (MPF). Yearly Reset Date = Start of the next trading week after the very 1st Full Moon in January of every year. Why ? Full Moon = Energized state and a great time to commence the new years trading. Example 2018 January Full Moon on 2 January Reset the MPF to January 8 (1st trading day of the next week after Full Moon) Example 2019 January Full Moon on 21 January Reset the MPF to January 28 (1st trading day of the next week after Full Moon) Example 2020 January Full Moon on 11 January Reset the MPF to January 13 (1st trading day of the next week after Full Moon) Then I'll add in the all important MTTTM Time Lines or MTL's for short. These will be spaced out in a certain order (not necessarily sequential) and represent potential turning points in price action. Design and code the MPF Template with all necessary indicators (informative ofcourse). Update the MTTTM thread to address the advanced version of the trading system. Easy, not mystical and I've already provided the precise dates for the reset of the MTTTM ProTrading Frame so there will never be any dispute. In fact I like the idea that much that I am going to implement it into the current MTTTM thread and take it to a new level. Masterrmind.............

--- 帖子 #993 ---
Yes there is value provided you can locate and dig out the gems. In this case it is simply being able to locate a significant high swing and a significant low swing on a given chart and divide the range between the 2 price levels into 8 equally spaced zones and add on 2 octives above and 2 below to create a 'breaking zone' for price to slow down and reverse out of or an OB or OS zone if you like. Ofcourse you can also apply a fractal breakdown procedure surrounding current price on any symbol such that a fractal is created and an upper and lower price range created and then you can decide on a suitable octive gap after every iteration is performed. Sounds complicated but its actually very very simple. ps. If you used my birthday as the reset date ... guess what ? It too would be in October ... what are the chances of that !

Of course, we all understand there is no perfect system, just as you do. Gann was obviously ahead of his time and quite insightful. Many have come since with other useful insights. It seems the markets do not respond too well to traders who employ great complexity in their decisions. Cluttered charts create paralysis in decision making. You have found a way, OAPDave's way, to win at this tough game. Surely nothing really new has come from the recent discussion, and you probably beat us all to the straightforward approach, which includes MMLs. Your observations and chart have been very useful!

--- 帖子 #998 ---
OAPDave, a few personal disjointed thoughts. First, I really believe that many systems discussed on FF, and elsewhere, can lead to net positive outcomes. So the use of other (typically lagging) indicators, which MM doesn't want on this site of course, must provide some benefit in at least some situations. Secondly, I know, as many traders do, more than a few who really swear by (not so much at) the use of TDI. It often seems to corroborate 'messages' from MML as I compare them in your charts suggesting a similar action by the trader. Thirdly, not sure I ever tried the guppy, but it actually looks kind of decent especially up on that D1. I like it better with the MMLs on there, though. Follow the crossover and enjoy the ride down in this case. I'm sure there are those who find it attractive, stuck with the guppy and regularly take in pips. It should certainly work in trending markets. Fourth, and I understand many would disagree with me, but I have seen a lot more cluttered charts with several more indicators than these even on FF. Eventually, you will have some conflict of information, and I just shut down. My problem. Fifthly, you are likely a MUCH more effective trader than me, but sometimes the same/similar message coming from different sources is kind of comforting. If I look at your M30 (3rd chart down) I probably would enter sooner from the MMLs than guppy crosses but the TDI is pretty close for me. TDI + MML seems to offer a certain weight of evidence to take action. I concede total lack of understanding and appreciation for the M5/M1, although I know a greatly successful trader friend who is very adept on LTFs (very low to me). I have tried to learn from him without consistent success. I am neither young nor naive about the enormous challenges of winning at forex. I have always struggled at remaining successful over time with any particular system. With every good regard, FS

Great post. At the end of the day a trader really only need take what they think is useful from any number of trading methodologies, systems or approaches. If a trader thinks he/she can conquer Gann methodology, please reconsider ... you cannot because it was never totally revealed. It too is surrounded in many elements of mystery. Trade a method that you enjoy be it short, medium or longer term but always apply common sense and apply a reasonable RR in every trade. Trade what best fits your own trading style.

Lagging Indicators Generally traders keep adding them to their charts in the hope that they might find some useful help that leads to higher profits in the market. When the indi 'stops working' they then swap and change and confuse themselves because they haven't spent the time to understand what it is that the indi actually does on the chart, how it performs its calculations. They only see cross here and a cross there so it must be entry time ... You need to ask yourself the following question: Does the indicator provide any edge on the right side of the chart ? If not then it provides almost no value whatsoever and if anything it will confuse and mislead the trader. No person knows how the far right end of the chart will unfold so get rid of those lagging and cluttering indicators, you don't need them . Masterrmind.............

Yes the stars aligning ... I am actually serious about creating the MTTTM ProTrading Frame with MMLs and MTLs (MTTTM Time Lines). The Full Moon yearly reset dates will also apply from January each year. I plan to design, code and test it prior to release which may take a few weeks then I'll upload it to Post 1. Interested traders are then free to test it out and either use it or bin it at their discretion. Keeping trading simple ! ps. Mt4 and Mt5 versions will be available but as you know Mt5 will only get the updates and improvements. Masterrmind............

Update to my mini rant

--- 帖子 #753 ---
One thing that never really got highlighted during the Murrey - Gann debate is that the squares start from the square of four and fan out as price moves through time. This means that the "squares" can be asymmetrical as price moves through time. Each time a square reaches it's end by price squaring time, the sequence starts again. I find that the fibo tool works closer when I do use this method of analysis. Gann and Murrey have little to do with actual trading because the analysis must still be confirmed with good PA. Mladen made a MTF MML indie. I studied this and realized that any of the lines could be a turning point on any time frame, and this removes much of any predictive power that T.H. Murrey tried to attribute to them. This is in no way an attack on anyone that uses the lines to their benefit of course. Different strokes.

--- 帖子 #754 ---
Thanks for your reply and interest, all I attempt to do is to try and use ADR, be it Monthly Weekly Daily or even hourly, to give me clues to better favour one line from another. It's a real pity Murrey as not updated my licence for my EOD or I could have posted some charts on request
