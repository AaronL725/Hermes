Posting. 8/21/2017 MANDATORY UPDATE Indicators: FXM_Diff3,FXMfibo Experts: FXM_TTM, FXMSetup Libraries: SDSMain.dll, BDMnextgen2.dll Templates FXMDIFF, FXMTTM Put them all in place. Run FXMSetup from the experts folder Open a chart and load the template FXMDIFF. Change the settings to your liking (save the template). Click on [Lck] to lock the current selection and then [Bsk] to generate an offline chart. Go to you offline chart window and open the offline chart. On that chart load the template FXMTTM. Just for a first glance click on [break] and by double clicking on the breaklines select them and move them where you want. (The [usel] button on TTM will unselect all selected lines at once) You can do that same with add, stoploss, profit etc. No click on [ Start trading] and you are already set. Want to trade manual ? then there are the [ Long] and [Short] buttons, no need for break lines. Lot of params insite TTM for locking, distances etc.

Hi FxMadness, Sounds interesting! It made me curious! Good luck to your thread!

Nope, FXM ! Going to look like this and is more for traders that do not rely on EA's trading when they are asleep.

Congrats FxMadness to your new thread...being curious to learn more of your strategy...TTM (?) After a holiday break I tried below settings about a dozen times today for total 331 pips, almost always just 3-12 minutes in the market, I like very shortterm trading and believe that it should be successful on every day with good trending pairs like today...of course takes some time Attached Image (click to enlarge) Happy trading, jdva

Thanks for this, following with interest. Just to note, when I loaded the templates for the offline charts they were looking for indicators and experts in a /BDM subfolder of the indicators and experts folder. I created that folder and put them in, it all worked fine (just in case anybody is struggling here).

Do not look at the offline chart as something weird. On the left is a normal eurusd M15 chart on the right the chart generated by the FXM_writer for the same single eurusd pair. The only thing that differs are the price levels on the chart.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
ist this ok ?

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Except for the "Text" in there it seems ok. Try to click "start trading" to see if they go away and then save the template again.

--- 帖子 #31 ---

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hi, Cant take trades for some reason,and getting an error

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Couple of things to observer here. First of all the high and lows on a candlestick chart seem exaggerated compared to the bodies but they are not. The high and low (sticks) represent the absolute movement of the pairs and the bodies represent the effective movement. So if you trade TTM using the [Touch] options you are trading the sticks because if the overall price touches your break line TTM will start to trade but if you use the [Break] mode the body of the candle has to close above or below the buy/sell break line. In the latter (break mode) it is important that you generate your offline chart on the timeframe you want to trade because that determines the candle close. Secondly, even a very diverse basket obeys in a way the fibonacci and the support and resistant levels. If you have a good fibo or S&amp;R indicator that works on offline charts i would use it on your template.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
There are no pairs showing in TTM so either look in the expert log for other errors or just start the fxm_diff-&gt;lock-&gt;basket-&gt;writer-&gt;ttm sequence over.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Thanks for help FxMadness. No,I cant get it to show any pairs. Thats the only error im getting. Ive run the setup 10 times now and the same happens.Offline chart is updating prices so no idea. I am using a broker with "-ECN" as suffix ,would that be the issue ?

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Normally not, i am using brokers with prefixes and/or suffixes. Have a look in MQL4/files/BDMBASKETS you should see a file called FXM3-06.txt (FXM [Bsk] button) and a file called #FXM-3#06 (FXM_Writer, TTM input). They are as follows 6 (number of pairs) xxxxxx,NRM (xxxxxx = pairname without prefix/suffix NRM is normal) xxxxxx,REV (xxxxxx...., REV is reversed trading) ...... Also there has to be a global variable $FXM$BASKET$[name of the basket] but there should only be one off the $FXM$BASKET$xxxxxx globals. I noticed an error that the writer does not remove an already used global. So make sure ther are all deleted. Edit: Hold on i see that the day number is not corresponding. Think i have made a mistake. MMMMM, interesting error in MQL4 again regarding refreshrates and timecurrent(). But never mind, try this new FXM_writer.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Thanks great work. Two questions, First - the writer accepts one indicator #, can this be changed to accept multiples, if you are using more on the one chart e.g. 1,2,3,4, etc (tried this but won't accept)? Second - can this be used on a live account as I see Demo stated in FXMTTM?

--- 帖子 #41 ---
[quote=FxMadness;10243808] Dear Master, What is wrong?

--- 帖子 #42 ---
First nope, not going to go that way. If you need more than one basket to make a profit you have either no clue how basket trading works or the basket indicator (creator) sucks. Secondly just try it, it will work.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
So what did i do wrong here.... Attached Image Oops, forgot to click [Start trading] Attached Image

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Some graphics out of the way. Double click on the outer border of either TTM of FXMfibo until a square appears. Click and drag the outer border to a more convenient place and release.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
If you click on the small gray or red (is reversed pair) button in front of that pair a small window with options will appear either to the right or to the left depending on the placement of TTM.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
OK. Using more than one basket does yield higher pips if done correctly as evidenced by FPB and many others who use multiple baskets and achieve tens of thousands of pips however sure for a profit you only need one, agreed.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Great ideas and thanks for sharing FXM I have been trading CCFp for quite some time, various basket strategies and have plenty of experience using MT4 but for some strange reason I cannot make the FXM_Diff3 work properly for me. Not when I load the indicator directly to the chart nor when I load the template, what looks like the indicator in the screenshot is just text which does not update. In addition the platform won't acknowledge that there is an indicator on the chart when pressing CTRL+I. Can anybody please advice how to fix this? I downloaded the zip today so should be the most current indicator.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Hi, Download zip and install everything to its relevant folder. Do not use the template,as that may be giving you issues,just open a single chart and add the indicator fxm_diff3 ,then load the set file FxMadness has provided. Then follow the instructions in the 1st post to generate an offline chart,open off line chart but do not use template. Load the indicator fxmfibo 1st,then add the ea fxm-ttm You may need to change colour of the charts to black for best viewing. try that and see how you go.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
The problem may be that you have loaded xm7 EA as well. That is not needed.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Have you pressed LCK, the BSK and then clicked on the filename after 'Locked'. That writes a file to disk, you then need to load an offiline chart by going File -&gt; Open Offline and then apply the template to the newly opened window

--- 帖子 #77 ---
I can't even get to the LCK button. When I load the template, I see LCK button for 1 second then it gets replaced with NEXT timer. When timer is done counting down, it just resets and starts another count down. There are no errors in the log. Attached is what I see.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
OK, so how are we going to trade this beast ? What is the preferred settings for the fxm_diff3 and what is the preferred time frame for the offline chart in comparison to the indicator ? Ive not used offline charts with fxm_diff indicator before so looking forward to learning its secrets.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Looks good. Followed post 1 instructions, and has worked straight off from the Zip file....will follow the thread. Hopefully it will sit nicely among my own trading preference. Thanks for starting. M.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
FxMdness I wish you good luck with your thread ... and as many followers. I also subscribe ... the desire to learn more, always overwhelms me. As far as I noticed today, the offline chart shows the mirror image of the basket. FxM is this observation correct? ... if yes, then we need to pay attention to the buy &amp; sell settings in EA FXM_TTM. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Hello Master, The FXM_Diff3 indicato didn't open at chart. what can I do? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #82 ---
FxMadness, Run into the same problem this eve.. its been working fine all day so it looks like a timing issue as the problem has occurred at exactly the same time the following day. Maybe its got something to do with broker time and local time,when mt4 platform is on the following (1st sept) day and local time is still (31st august) Just a guess really. Hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #83 ---

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Hi Bae67, I tried what you told me. It still did not work. Am thinking of downloading history all over again to see if it will solve the problem. Thanks so much for the help.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Thanks for the image, save me time to make one. The offline chart reflects the positive (good) or negative (bad) movement of all pairs in the basket. It does that by adding all prices together for all the pairs in the basket. For the reversed pairs (red button in front) it reverses OCHL to see if would be positive for the basket if you would have sold them. You either buy are basket, go with the suggested directions or sell a basket which means you trade with reversed directions. In your case if you would had clicked on the [Long] button or had set a buy break/touch line your two pairs would have been shorted because you would have been buying the basket (go with the flow) and the the two pairs are sells and that is the flow. The buy/sell break lines are something like XM7 Virtual basked. The buyline is positive trigger to open the basket the sellline (if you click the [R] button after creating the line is the bottom (-) trigger. If you leave the sell break/touch line you can trade a complete basket reversal and pocket the DD as profit. When you pocketed that profit you can set new breaklines to start trading the suggested direction. If you created break/touch lines but you only want to trade a positive (go with the flow) basket you double click (select) the sell line, right click and choose delete object. There will be no reverse break or tradeing in that case. If you change you mind there is always the [short] button.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Is correct. I wanted to automate the diff-&gt;writer process o you does not have to fill in a basket name. Part of the name is the day number but i found out that there is a bug in mql4 where the last known server time is not updated using RefreshRates(); So the day number was still 0 and as a temporary fix i had to use the local day number. I will fix that as soon as possible buy using the local day number in diff3 and the writer.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Once you have used the basket name in diff3 and started the writer (filed or not) if you want to use the basket name again you have to click [Bsk] first again else you will get the "Invalid filename" message.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Thanks FxM for the detailed answer. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #90 ---
[Usel] will clean the lines up and [Start trading] might be a good idea too.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
The colored [A] button behind is the Allowed from the input settings. So a colored [A] behind the [Add] button means that the robot is allowed to place two add lines once it start to trade. You can turn that off by clicking on the [A] and if in a later stage you do want to manually add lines click on the [Add] Same goes for [Trail],[BE] etc.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Ok ... it was just for the reverse demonstration. I think it's fine now ... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

All lines are trend lines so the do not have be to horizontal. You can align them with whatever (trend, bands) indicator you use.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
for some reason FXTM dont load with the template

--- 帖子 #95 ---
FXTTM is loaded so what do you mean exactly ? You must have done something wrong in the lock-&gt;create basket- open chart sequence You generated basket FXM5-09 but you opened the offline chart FXM3-06 and i think because TTM can not make any sense of it it opened the pairs of The FXM3-09 basket. When TTM starts it looks at the symbol of the chart fi. #FXM5-09#0915 and extracts the basket filename #FXM5-09#09 and the timeframe 15.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
There was no expert loaded and fibo indi,but figured now cos i didnt made the folder BDM for indi;s and BDM for expert.your tpl on that is based.now all good is the milk effect

--- 帖子 #97 ---
hi FxMadness , any open or closed trades to SHOW us since u posted this system [ 3days AGO ] ?

--- 帖子 #98 ---
O yes, more than a 1000 pips on USD news using strength D1 current if you hit the right button that is. I was doing something else when i noticed that the news was already 5 minutes gone so i rushed over saw my lines where still in select mode, wanted to hit Usel but hit short instead. As much as i hate having been asked the question "are you sure you want to do that" i am going to build that in TTM......

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Interesting FXMadness - thanks for the insight. Do you set you lines to break above below all of the Fib Levels or is your entry criteria a little more complex ?

Attached Image (click to enlarge) Sorry FXM. I got a invalid filename error: 5004. Just wondering what is that? Thanks

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Probably during basket generation. Did you get and installed the latest zip from post #1. Sequence still is Lock [Lck]-&gt; generate basket [Bck] click on the basket name (writer starts) and then open the offline chart. If for any reason you have to go back to the basics do not forget to remove the "old" writer indicator first then click [Bsk] again and start the new writer by clicking on the basket name.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
TTM is not an indicator it is an Expert Advisor so it will not show up on your list of indicators. Look for a smiley face in the upper right corner of the chart. Edit: Post deleted ? But i was too fast for you

--- 帖子 #104 ---

--- 帖子 #109 ---

--- 帖子 #110 ---
So LCK button was not visible because your choice of broker? You had to switch to different account just to get the indicator working? Or you're referring to some setting?

Thanks, do you by any chance know why LCK button and other normal options on FXMDIFF not showing up? Why would this broker effect the way the indicator is working?

have you assigned keys to writer indi? if you use fxmad tpl then you need to make a folder BDM inside indicators folder and put indi's there.and make a folder BDM inside experts folder and put expert there.

hello kbkm, were able to resolve this error.. i am having the same issue.. i have even tried the solution profile by fxmadness by downloading the new indicators and TPL..? dont know if u have any luck!

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Just a timer. This is FXPro broker a live account. I tried this on a dummy demo account with another broker and the buttons show up. For some reason it's not showing up with FX Pro?

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Thanks for replying but you are not really helping because you did not read my post very carefully. The indicator FXM_Diff3 does not load on my chart regardless of how I try to apply it. I tried both loading the indicator itself and loading the setfile before clicking OK and tried loading it using the template on different charts but the indicator menu just disappears and then the indicator is not on the chart. I also created the BDM subfolder but it did not make a difference. What looks like the indicator on the screenshot are simply objects which do not update which appear after loading the template. The point of the screenshot was to show the journal entries that show the indicator being loaded to the chart and then instantly removed. Thanks for replying but you are not really helping because you did not read my post very carefully. The indicator is not present at the chart hence the LCK button on the chart is only graphics without function. Of course I tried pressing the button before I figured out that the indicator was not actually on the chart. I am not a noob who does not know how to open an offline chart. Sorry if I come off as ungrateful or salty here but it frustrating to receive answers which does not address my question in relation to the information provided in my initial post Can anyone please advice how to make the indicator FXM_Diff work properly on my chart? My broker does not have one of the standard 28 pairs (NZDCAD) however I have tried the indicator with different brokers but the problem persists

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Awesome I think its all set up correctly. Looking forward to testing this on Monday.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Have you installed the SDSMain.dll file into the library? Without installing the .dll file the indicator will not work.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Your setup is not working correctly as you have no pairs in the ea so it will not trade. Check your expert journal, its probably showing an error. The ea should list all locked pairs used to build the chart. Try building again when market open as im having the same issue but only last thing in the eve.It builds ok during the day. Fxmadness is going to address the issue at some point.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Yes you are correct, I got an error 5004 in the experts log. I've removed and restarted everything, but still seems to look the same. Now I'm confused as I've followed all the steps that FxMadness has said in post 1. EDIT: So after restarting as according to post 1, I do see the offline chart has changed but still not showing any pairs and still showing error 5004 in the experts log. I have downloaded the zip file so I'm sure I'm using the correct files.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
That is an older version you have on Fxpro .

--- 帖子 #127 ---
@FxMadness , this good ENUFF for ur syst. ?

--- 帖子 #128 ---
That is the latest MT4, so yes. What i meant to say to imdb is that is has installed an older version of the FXM_Diff3 indicator without buttons.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
It's same version the one I just downloaded. Is there a newer one then the post on page 1? I just copied from 1 MetaTrader folder to the other one, it works on the demo FX Open, but won't open on FX Pro.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Never mind, it was older version. In your zip you have 2 version, 1 in root which is dated July 14th and new one in indicators. So I must of copied the root files.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Got all the way to offline chart, applied the template to it. There are no errors in the Experts log. However the pairs in the offline chart do not match the DIFF template. Is it because the market is closed and chart is not updating?

--- 帖子 #133 ---
My error, sorry for that. I will update the zip.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Never mind on the previous post, the expert was missing. I put the expert in the right folder and now just getting error of invalid filename Attached Image (click to enlarge) Though the file is there with right pairs inside it. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Also looked in global variables only thing I found was Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #136 ---
That is due to the difference in day 4 and 5. One is server time and the other due to a bug in MT4 local time. As i do not have a solution for the bug yet i will have to make them both local time.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Post #1 FXMUPDATE.zip [Bsk] button will start the writer. Green button means basket created and writer running.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Thanks FxMadness everything looks sorted now.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Oh oh, damn bugs! Anyway to simply set the basketname by hand instead of relying on some variable you can pull in MQL?

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Ah I think I know whats going on. Attached Image Server time stops when market closes, hence it's day 4 until it re-opens. So if you attempt to load this prior to market opening, the basket name will be messed up, so you can only start this process right after re-opening.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Great Ea FxMadness, Surely make it easier to analyze basket..

--- 帖子 #158 ---
what makes you trade at market open when all spreads are at high levels and market have no right direction and no volatility? when load offline charts see to have corespondent on expert tab of the offline chart created.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
It's not opening any trades until basket starts to move into right direction. There's no trades open. I was just trying to get it up and running.

umm idk if i wrong understand about this ea, im think this one will traidng automatly to me... but a never get a new open order from it. please can someone explainme about it EDIT: or maybe i dont understand de functionality of this ea

--- 帖子 #169 ---
youre right you dont understand it.this will not trade automatic for you while you do nothing thats for sure,at least at this level. so ... start with first post,read again and also look at people who made all corect and their posts.you will get it. FXMDIFF is the leader,will give selected pairs in one single chart for you to trade using break lines and MM and/or using your own visual and trade just manual basket pairs.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Um i think your right but whats its the criteria for trading?

--- 帖子 #171 ---
look inside FXMDiff indicator and see what is saying there.then you look for CCFP indi or thread and also learn what it does.look then for strength indi somewhere and see what it does and say and so on... i feel you started with the end ... instead with the beginning

@pipsy7 First stop using profanities ook al zijn deze in hetNederlands. I will ban you without a second thought next time. Second the thread is called FXM + TTM which means the combination of the two as basket trading. Examples of you showing that you can not even trade a single pair have no place here. @Husky Take a Jack and stop trying to improve the world. If thread goes in the direction that a referee is needed i will ask FF to remove it completely. I do not need it.

why didnt open position.. any wrong of this?? it seems break, isnt?

--- 帖子 #185 ---
I assume you recently placed the break lines in there and the current (and a couple of past) bar has not broken above or below the break lines. Breaks only occur on bar close and since you generated a M15 offline chart it will be the 15 minute bar close. You could select [touch] instead that will fire trades as soon as the price touches the level.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
You went for the "sure" takeprofit i see. Personally because of the upside room i would have followed it with a trailing.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Yep..do agree...but problem is on H1 tf you get every hour new suggestions and you do never know how long the old suggestions keep working well...

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Well, 150 pips on a short M5 trade...not bad. Will you now wait for the next H1 suggestions and trade again ?

--- 帖子 #189 ---
so what best time did you open your basket?

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Firstly thanks FxMadness for sharing, really good work! I've been testing this since yesterday and I noticed the offline chart always starts with a gap between the current M15 candle and the previous one as shown in the screenshot, I'm not sure what the reason is. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #191 ---
yes..after a lunch break...11h gmt

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Then,if you close chart,go back to fxm diff chart,remove indicator "writer" and regenerate chart you will find the gap has gone ! Well,thats the way mine is working so its a bit strange and may need fxmadness to fix something.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Not all my charts do that, just some. Going to have a look at it. In the mean time daily strength basket running since LO + 30 (break) with tight trailing.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Might be getting the hang of this. Very clever - on live account:

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Thanks nihilist23uk, I tried that and it is now fixed. Thanks FxMadness.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
You can also move your trailing line. While you are trailing (trail is opened at a fixed distance OR on the opposite break/touch line when still not deleted) you can also select and move your trailing line closer or farther away if you think the basket needs more room at one point or the move has come to an end. This is not an Expert Advisor so it will not do that for you, it is a visual trade manager. You have to do the trading. @ 1000+ pips i put in a TP at around 1200 and moved my trailing in very close. Been enough for this basket (and i got bored).

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Understood. This is very good. How are people risk-managing this in terms of position size. I'm trying to get my head around the initial stop loss. Lets say its 10 pips, is that 10 pips of basket value ? So if I wanted to risk 2% of an account, (and lets say on a single pair that equated to 0.2 lots at 10 pip SL) would I apportion that 0.2 lots across the basket according to the guidance of FXMDiff or just set my lotsize to 0.2 lots in the EA ? Impressive coding, thanks FXMadness !

--- 帖子 #198 ---
I took a big loss this afternoon fortunately demoing...shorted on TL break after touching R1 without SL, mea culpa... ... prices gapped over R1, then PC got temporarly frozen, hence I could not do anything...lesson learned. Is there reverse EA feature? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #199 ---
i guess we have it

--- 帖子 #200 ---
OK...thank you...!

--- 帖子 #201 ---
If you mean by "reverse" that the EA will automatically reverse if it hits SL (or TP) ? Has been tried before, those folks are now all bankrupt.

Hi Guys, Can somebody help me I have tried to load all the latest indicator, Templates and EA to respective folder. Tried to follow FXM instruction on post #1 but after pressing Lock button and BSK shows some thing different. I have attached to screen shots of it. I don't see basket is generated. I am doing something wrong.. your help is appreciated. Bomi

--- 帖子 #206 ---
I think you forget to set the Hot-Key ALT+H on the FXM_Writer indicator. Click right on the indicator and select Set Hotkey.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
also after you set hotkey click close on you mt4 then open it again.so the hotkey will remain set,otherwise if any accidental crash/close mt4 happen hotkey is reset to none.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Fxmadness Congrats man, you did it with your system. You are the man. Am following the system with hawk eye. Though I don't understand fully(50%), how the whole system works, I know very soon I'll get the hang of it. If you can give a few tips once in a while, that will also be appreciated. Wishing you all the best in your efforts. Thanks so much for giving us the privilege.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Hi Fxm, Thanks for prompt reply. As your instruction I did the hotkey - alt+H on writer indi but i will do it again if you say so. Also do you want me to restart the PC as Husky says.. Bomi

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Hi FX, After alt+H and rebooting this message come on screen. IS it ok. Thnks Bomi

--- 帖子 #211 ---
not PC restart. mt4 close and open again after you have set hotkey.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Hi Husky, I did it as per your instruction. I have closed MT4 first and then rebooted. still not working. Bomi

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Now have a look in the experts tab on your terminal there must be an error message like "import dll not allowed" or something.

The more I dig into this the more interesting it gets. I have a question, I am messing around with setups that I am familiar with, still levels trading but not necessarily Fibs, although I can see how that potentially works. I like looking at candles, they help me with a story, so I loaded up the offline chart as a candle chart. And I have a question, most if not all candles are gap candles. ie. The open is typically either higher or lower than the previous close and the close is typically around the open of the previous candle. To a layman, it looks like Open and close are the wrong way around somewhere, but it also might be the case that I don't fully understand how and how frequently is calculates the basket value. Have I missed something guys ?

--- 帖子 #217 ---
I can see how you came to think that. A offline basket chart over multiple pairs and buy and sell combined is always a "by approach" chart. First of all you are combining different prices to try to match and display it as one "price" and secondly you are converting sells to buys (or vv) to create a chart where what it says as price on the right of the chart doesn't matter (it is imaginary) but will indicate the direction of your overall basket. Then you have the time lag. If you have left the Writer as default it will generate a fake tick every 2000 Ms (2 seconds) and with "big" baskets around 10 pairs a lot of price movement can happen in those 2 seconds. If your system can handle it try a 10 Ms chart and see if that is updated better. If you still have doubts please post a bit more detailed pref with image) where you think the writer goes wrong.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Don't know if it will work with this strength or ccfp calculation but it should (have to try that alongside my trading). On a H1,H4 or Daily basis lock your basket based on strength or ccfp using the "use current" modifier based on on H1 indicator refresh time 2 hours and 5 minutes after Tokyo open. Then generate a basket based on those selections about 1 hour before London open and set breaks for either reversal or continuation. If you are awake during Asian you could also generate a basket immediately and first try to trade that same TKY + 2 basket during that session for some profit and close bbefore LO-1 .

--- 帖子 #219 ---
[quote=FxMadness;10261416]{quote} I can see how you came to think that. Thanks FxMadness, this isn't a criticism by any means, I think this is a work of genius. I understand the challenges that you mentioned with generating the 'imaginary chart' as you put it. But having traded with it for a couple of days, I noticed some erratic movements from bar to bar, when I was just using the line chart. I understand your point regarding the 2 second delay, so I have now generated a 15 minute chart with a 10mS delay, and my observations (which I accept may still be totally wrong) are the same and they concern the hand off from bar to bar. If we take a series of two bars (Bar 1 and Bar 2) on a normal chart we typically see close of bar one almost identical to the open of bar 2 (I appreciate it isn't an exact science): Attached Image However in your offline charts (now 10mS) I see this: Attached Image Which in traditional charts would suggest in the split second between the close of the previous bar and the start of the next bar there was a gap down and price then rose those the close (or in this case the open) of the previous candle. Of course we have seen this happen in real life, but most of the candles in this chart show gapping: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Now if open and close was 'the wrong way around' I can simulate that by changing the candle colours, making it look upside down. (ie a Bear candle is coloured green and a bull candle is coloured red). Then your offline chart looks like it is handing off from bar to bar more in-keeping with that of a standard chart: Attached Image (click to enlarge) So - if you look at this 'fake'chart, the handoff from close to open are more aligned. So if there is a problem with plotting open/close this may also affect the endpoint of the line chart as it's plotting. It also potentially affects the view of a healthy retracement at a level. Hope that makes sense, a bit difficult to explain

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Hi FXM, I think the problem with ALT+H key it is not working. attached pitcher.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
First try to start the writer manually by pressing ALT+H, if the writer pops up your hotkey is set correctly, Then try the sequence, click [Lck] (should turn red) then click [Bsk] the text "Locked FXMx-yy" should be displayed and the same input as in ALT+H window should pop up.

Hi FxMadness, Once I will be at home I will do as u mentioned . Currently I am working in the night shift. Thank you for guidance and help. Bomi

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Same here, funny MT4 ! Analyze this.....it is a nice puzzle (i already solved it). Two missing bars between 3:00 and 3:45 (3:15 and 3:30) But the writer did generate the bars only MT4 does not accept those two. It does not really show up as a time gap (missing bars) on the chart but why not, it should. Now have a look at what that sneaky MT4 does with the time scale interval at the bottom of the chart.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Hello FxMadness, I would like to ask how to set a Take-profit (TP) target. When I click on the Profit button, it closes the trades am in. And when I click the "c" beside the profit button, there is no response. Any help?

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Yes... I have had the same problem but mostly when I changed the line colour to another brighter colour like yellow green...

--- 帖子 #227 ---
[quote=FxMadness;10262670]{quote} Same here, funny MT4 ! So it just 'scaled them out' ie, we lost a half an hour of time. Not very helpful But they aren't missing from the FX Writer log. The other thing I noticed, your bars are generally working better than mine, ie. close is often at or near the open. So apart from the 'missing bars' issue we seem to get different results with offline charts ? I generated a new chart this morning and I am still getting the same results. When I have done some coding in MT4 in the past, I had some odd issues when I wasn't rounding up the decimal places, not sure if that helps you or not since I noticed there are a lot of digits on some of your pricing in your screenshot. The trouble is, it gets quite complicated with multiple pairs with different decimal points, and in this environment it must be a nightmare

Once you know about the "bug ?" you can solve it. It never happened to me because i always use separate baskets for the buy and sell groups so these conditions did never occur. I want to finish some last things on the writer but this already looks much better.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Yep...

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Yes that looks perfect. Am I shutting up and waiting for a new release ? Thanks FxMadness.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Here is the new writer. The problem with the missing bars was that the high could be &lt; open or close or the low &gt; open or close due to the mixing of buy/sell pairs. In these cases MT4 would just ignore the bar. I added an option "Push HiLo instead of calculation it" which means that the average price of the basket pairs pushes the high higher and the low lower in a bar. Normally the high and low are calculated from the highs and lows of all pairs in the basket but the push is more "normal" MT4 behavior. You have to test this option out because it could mean that when you are in a trade and while the bar is going in the right direction your dollar profit could go the other way. You just have to test how this affects your Takeprofit and Trailing hit time.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
[quote=FxMadness;10263022]Here is the new writer. Thanks, will test later on (trading at the moment). This must be so difficult to code !

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Hi. Thx for this great system! Everything is working, and first day was very good My only question is the setting for FxM diff... We locked it and does that mean the signals dont change? I have 6 pairs to trade, and that have not change the last 18 hours?

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Yes, FXM_diff does not update when locked. The lock is only there to show you the original selection when you generated the basket/offline chart. Just click the red Lck again and the indicator continues. Let me see your TTM lock input settings, something wrong there.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Thx I've attached the settings here.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Looks like you do not use locking so i wonder what the Lock 0.0/0.0 is doing there... Have to look into that. A wait, you clicked on the [None] (is set locking on) button while you did not have any locking set in the input params. Have to build a "no locking specified" message in i think.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Thx for the help. Now I have a new problem! I set the locking in TTM and after that I can no longer see P/L, it's like it reset it. I try restarting MT4, but then it's says "No pairs found" :S

--- 帖子 #251 ---
You can not restart TTM while trading. For TTM to work correctly it needs to know if it was working on a buy or sell basket but as you have a mix of buy and sell trades it can not determine a direction based on open trades.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Okay. I will close the trades and start a new basket

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Another question (sorry for the inconvenience) But my chart has stopped moving? How come?

--- 帖子 #254 ---
No problem. No writer running on the FXM_Diff chart ? Click Lck and Bsk again.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Yeah just figured it out OFC I needed to get a new offline chart Well, aint so bright in the morning

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Hello FxMadness, I have heard you say this twice - "you have a mix of buy and sell trades it can not determine a direction based on open trades". Based on this, are saying when the FXM_DIFF indicator shows a mix of buy and sells, there is a certain way to trade it? Last time you said this too - "You either buy are basket, go with the suggested directions or sell a basket which means you trade with reversed directions". Am confused. Could you please explain in a little detail. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
That is why the Lock [Lck] is there for. If the Lock was on you only had to restart the writer [Bsk] to get the chart running again with the same pairs. I will look back at your posts from the afternoon and evening to check that statement.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Well if FXM_DIFF says "buy audcad and sell cadchf" and you do a "buy" (long) of that basket you are following FXM_DIFF and are buying audcad and selling cadchf. If you do a "Sell" (short) of those FXM_DIFF suggestions you do the opposite, sell audcad and buy cadchf.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Thanks, its very clear now. Very grateful.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Hi FxMadness, Thanks for the system. I put everything in place and attached my screenshots. Looks like something is wrong. I compared my screenshot with others and for example, Kongjarl's levels are at 97 while mine is at 104.39. Could you please check my screenshots and identify what is wrong with it, if possible. Appreciate your time. Kind Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #261 ---
The price level is arbitrary. The start level of a basket with zero trades is 100. Depending on the number of trades, the direction they move(d) in when building the history bars that level can be higher or lower. Basically it does not say anything, it is just used to have a price reference for placing the TTM lines like break,tp and sl on a certain distance.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Try this FXM_TTM, it will pick up your trades, direction and basket open time/price when re-started (until you re-start the MT4 terminal). You will however lose your TP,SL etc so you have to set them again manually.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Hi FxM, One thing I was thinking could be nice, was autolot! Say 0.01 pr. $100 or maybe % of equity. Don't know, but would be nice MM.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Finally this basket is open it.. @FxMadness How to set take profit or maybe close all or close when profit or maybe trailing?

--- 帖子 #265 ---
You are already trailing. Click on [Stop] for a stoploss line on [Profit] for a take profit lineetc. and move them to where ever you want them. Have a good look at the input params of TTM, they are not that difficult.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Hi All, I read the thread over and over. somehow i cant pass throught 1st step. i copy all files to relative locations - assign hot key etc. when i press "lck" it turns dark grey and nothnig happens. same as "bsk". what might be wrong? thanks in advance regards p.s. magic numbers also matcvh. both of them are "1". maybe problem with the "+" part on pairs?

--- 帖子 #267 ---
If you use a template (and i am sure you are because the numbers do not match the current ccfp) did the FXM_diff3 indicator even load. It looks like you have a chart with only object on it. So right click and see if the indicator is running. Also have a look at the experts tab when you load the template. Next use ALT+H to see if the Writer pops up.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Dear FXMADNESS, I am done with setting up my new systems and transferring all FX material over. However, I have hit as snag. Everything goes well with the procedure, but the offline chart does not update and hence no trade is taken. I have tried auto setup (using tlp file), I have tried manual setup.... nothing work. The offline chart does not update and stay exactly how it was when I first appended. The answer for you may be something silly but for me is out of reach. Thanks

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Hi, You are right. Tried to upload diff3 manually. and it gets immediately removed from chart. hmmm strange right? how can i solve this. can you pls help? btw alt+h pops up writer. regards

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Have you installed the SDSMain.dll file into the libraries folder? If that's not installed the indicator won't load.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
yes its in library folder. thats the error i get. i read someone having the same problem. i also loaded history script but it also didnt work... any suggestions regards

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Yes, run this script first and let it finish completely. O and make first sure your market watch window is showing all 28 pairs needed.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Hello. Everyone who's having problems with the offline chart, please try changing brokers. I had the same problem with one, but all went smoothly with a different one, and if you click on FXM's signature you'll see that he's using IC. Thanks FXM for this thread, I'm having good success and will go live soon.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Hi FxM I am having a similar problem adding the indicator. I am trying to add the suggested script but get a fail msg in the Experts Tab. Uninit reason 0....any tohughts P.S. Love your work.

Examples i give run on Traders Way (and others). If you use a different or a new broker always run the ForceLoadHirstoricalData script and make sure the 28 pairs are there. That will solve 95% of your problems.

Loving this game, still on live: Attached Image (click to enlarge) FxMadness - I have noticed something else, I might be driving it wrong so let me know. If I want to sell touch and the price is below the level I want to sell at (basically grabbing a retracement) it opens the trade immediately I guess because price is below that level. Obviously its vice versa for the buy touch. Is there something I can do about that ?

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Like this you mean ? Click [Touch] to place touch lines. They will stay clear of the current price. Click [R] to reverse them. Select and remove the buy touch line. Select and move the sell touch line to your selected reversal point. Click [Usel] to clear your selections. As an extra tip not only for you, clicking the [p] button will change the profit in pips display into account currency display. Pips are nice to see, money nicer.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Uninit reason 0 is not a fail message. There must be another message before that, just post a screenshot of a dozen lines of the expert log.

very strange....i did everything on thread....i also used same broker with yours and some other brokers. history loaded...everything in place etc. still getting the same error message. "zero divide in fxm_diff3.mq4 (2257,17)"....uninit reason 8. then indicator being removed.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
That line is in the pearson correlation routine and usually means that you are missing a pair in the market watch or there is no history for a pair. Try turning correlation off in the params.

Hi FXM, 1) Hot key H setup done. 2) Loaded Template FXMDIFF 3) Change the settings to your liking (save the template). No change kept as it is 4) Click on [Lck] to lock the current selection and then [Bsk] to generate a basket file Try to click Lck and Bsk nothing happened. 5) Click on the name that appears behind "Locked" (big font) and FXM_Writer will be started. I don't see anything appears hehind Locked bigfont. So I will wait for your next instruction..... Hope i am not bothering you. Bomi

Rogerha Nice results you have there. I see another indicator on your chart, I think by name - 3 Tier London Breakout indicator v.3.1 Could you please post the indicator for me and everyone who is interested. Also what is your FXM DIFF setting? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
No, you are not. Changed the instructions to: "Click on [Lck] to lock the current selection and then [Bsk] to generate a basket file and the FXM_Writer will be started." Make sure FXM_diff3 is running because you are still showing old suggestions.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Bomi and Others having problems. Let me see if I can help you. FxMadness , with your permission, of course! Just extract and copy the 2 folders into the " OPEN DATA FOLDER ". Overwrite if asked. After, go through the normal sequence again:- 1) Hot key H setup done. 2) Loaded Template FXMDIFF 3) Change the settings to your liking (save the template). 4) Click on [Lck] to lock the current selection and then [Bsk] to generate a basket file 5) Click on the name that appears behind "Locked" (big font) and FXM_Writer will be started. This time you might not even click the name and the FXM Writer will pop up. Just click OK! Attached File(s) FXM_TTM.rar 616 KB | 292 downloads -- Have just updated with latest files

Hi FXM/Wallaa I am following post #1 and loading the template (DIFF) that screen shot I have attached and i pressed click Lck or Bsk nothing happening. when I try to see the indicator folder it is showing empty. this r not old suggestion my friend. I have indicators in indicator folder as well as BDM which i have created long time back. thanks for your help guys. Bomi

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Unfortunatly, I found out that it is broker dependant. My live account is with FinPro and the offline chart does not update. I just opened a demo with TradersWay and the offline chart updates beautifully. I am doing exactly the same thing on both accounts. One thing I notice is that if I open the FX_Writer, do nothing and close it, the chart updates. I could do this every 15 minutes!

--- 帖子 #292 ---
definately broker based error. now managed to load it easily on another broker. i guess the problem is with eurusd+ or eurusd.ecn additions

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Perfect FxMadness, thanks. I'll stick with pips for now, once I get my position sizing sorted, I'll cheer myself up even more by measuring it in money. I long gave up trying new things in demo, small lotsize real account keeps some skin and emotion in the game ! Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Hi FXM/Wallaa there is some problem with broker it is not allowing me to load DIFF indicator see attachements. So may be I have to change the broker as previously post says that.. Instaforex does not allow me but Swissqout does. Bomi

--- 帖子 #295 ---
I would have tested it for you on FinPro but they just won't send me an email with the verification code in it. That's a good way to get customers......

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Thanks, I will find a way even if it takes me days. Unfortunately, for live accounts I am limited to FinPro or FXChoice, as they are the only two trusted ones that take US persons.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
@FxMadness what settings + times of the day worked best for you. is D1 CCFp + London open best? Or is it going after H1 Strength during London open?

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Most settings work if you lock a basket at TKY+2h and start trading LO-1h or LO+1h

What exactly does not work on instaforex ?

--- 帖子 #300 ---
when i try to load DIFF template it does not allow some of the indicators to load on the chart. I have attached the chart before. I did it again from start and it seems looking good. see attached ment and it is on SWISSQUOUTE. Bomi

Take a good look at my charts (not one) and the setup. Yours does not really look the same now does it.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
FinPro

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Of course i will explain it. FXM program determine the suffix and prefix from the eurusd symbol in the file symbols.raw. It finds the first eurusd entry and extracts the prefix and suffix. Now fi, FinPro has a euusd and an eurusd_ pair in the symbol table and probably eurusd is in there before eurusd_ but all other symbols have a _ suffix. The programs think that there is no suffix because it found the "plain" eurusd. So i deleted all eurusd pairs from the market watch except the eurusd_ Now i did you all a favor and build the folloing in FXM_Diff3, FXM_Writer and FXM_TTM It saves you the trouble of removing pairs. If the auto does not work for you turn it off and use the manual ones. Attached Image

Two things. You are not using the latest version of FXM_TTM and secondly i don't think it was the time to sell the basket but that is up to you. Rest looks fine.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Hi FxMadness, I know you are very patience with me and that's why in FF people are admire you. I know you are smart and intelligent who has done lot of good deed for many people as far as FF concern. Once again I appreciate your help but Let me try again on my own. Bomi

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Hello FxMadness, Can you please be kind enough to describe how you to decide to place they buy/sell orders using the system. I am confused on this matter. Much appreciated to you for the system

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Well i would just look at the chart and expected news/pairs and put the break lines on a place where i think that if the basket breaks that level it will be significant. I do not look at the pip distance or how many pips i am going to miss waiting for a break. And with so many pairs in a basket i never work with touch lines due to the possible large swings.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Fxmadness, Would it be possible to have in "type of selector" a none option,so we can build an offline chart using every pair that is in the "include pairs " list That way we could build a chart for just jpy or euro pairs (or both) etc and create custom baskets to trade. It would also work for news trades as well. I cant see anything like it at all doing searches so it would be a great tool to have. What do you think ?

--- 帖子 #313 ---
It is beyond the scope of this version.

Of course the stoploss canceled the trailing. You have to decide if you want to trail or not. I am at 145 now but do not have a target as where to set the TP. .

--- 帖子 #323 ---
FXM_Diff + FXM_writer not running anymore after blackout so you have to set them both up with the same criteria and selected pairs to get the chart ticking again. If you can not do that, you are better of closing the trade.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Thanks , i have updated FXM TTM,secondly my intentions to short manually was offline chart which was in selling direction, i realized it open against the FXM-CCF diff, actually i am learning how to use it manually.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Hi FxM, I started trading Demo using your Indi DIFF(4) manually. Let see how it goes. I know you are very busy but still you are giving me your precious time. When you have time can you put step by step instruction how to do it and i will do it. If any question i will ask you later on. Next 6-days I am working 12-hrs day/night so I will not get enough time but I will try to do it as and when I get time in between. I have already crossed retire age, but circumstances doesn't allow me to have retirement life. Hope I am not expecting too much from you. God bless you and your family. Bomi

--- 帖子 #335 ---
I just TDI + RSIOMA for entries. If you see faster RSIOMA (Lime) going into 1 direction much faster than RSIOMA (white) slow, then it's very often a temporary move and it will snap back. So if you're in a trade and it turns around, and you see that disconnect happening, chances are it's temporary backtracking. If you see them both in step it's most likely a legitimate reversal and permanent in nature!

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Can't miss friday afternoon. Will be i sell basket i presume.

Many thanks for taking the time and investigating this personally, you always supervise me about how heplful you are. This means that I must be doing something wrong. Have a wonderful weekend in the Spanish countryside.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here's what I was referring to in terms of timing your entries and avoiding fake reversals, this is an example from a regular chart but it works EXACTLY same way on FXMTTM template.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Yes,if we can use fxmadness system and ea to open a GBP basket chart before news we can set break lines etc. Also we would be able to select pairs we want and make a custom basket,say just eur pairs and jpy pairs,or just two pairs etc and build a chart to trade using his great offline chart system. At the moment baskets are restricted to only what the ccfp or strength gives us. it would also work well for looking analysis,so we can look back at failed trades and good ones and reproduce the charts when we like.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
If you want to sell the basket ... I will definitely buy it

--- 帖子 #341 ---
THANKS ! st888

--- 帖子 #342 ---
I think there's a bug. I took the suggestions from the bucket and reversed few pairs prior to Locking the basket. After I use a reverse function, lock, Basket and Open Writer it shows them as original SELL suggestions. Attached screen shot Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Nihilist23uk, With permission from FxMadness I have these templates for you. When you load them, instead of the FXM Diff, it will load particular pairs, as the name of the template implies. You can use them to trade the news. But you have to do the trading manually, 1-2 mins after the news. You can do the locking of the pairs 1min after the news, then create your offline chart, then take the trade manually. practice with it, and you'll get the hang of it. If you have any issues, let me know. Attached File(s) news templates.rar 38 KB | 403 downloads

--- 帖子 #349 ---
If you want, you can do this manually, it's a hack. But here's what you can do if you so desire 1) Lock any basket of recommendations and hit BSK file 2) Note basket name FXM5-09 for example 3) In explorer go to MQL4 &gt; Files &gt; BDMBASKETS 4) Using example filename above, locate 2 files #FXM5-09#somenumber.txt AND FXM5-09.txt 5) edit both files as they are the same, so you can copy &amp; Paste into another file after you're done editing one of them. 1st Row = # of pairs in the file 2nd row + = pairs Format is symbolname,trade_direction (NRM normal, REV reverse) Example file with 2 pairs: 2 CADJPY,NRM USDJPY,REV 6) Save the files 7) Start the writer and rest of the steps are the same

--- 帖子 #350 ---
I know there are many different combinations, but FxMadness, imdb, Wallaa, Catalin68 or others who have experience trading with this strategy, I'd really appreciate if you could share your favourite FXmDiff parameters based on your performance. Do you trade Strength D1 Current TL 2, or Strength H4 Current TL 1 or do you find CCFp D1 MA 3/5 TL 2 more profitable? ps. I've read FxMadness' following response "Most settings work if you lock a basket at TKY+2h and start trading LO-1h or LO+1h", I just want to find out your particular settings based on your performance since starting demo/live trading this system. Thanks in advance. Kind Regards, Blackeagle

--- 帖子 #351 ---
1 day testing FXM net 140 ish pips, i really love the offline chart it help me decide when to pull the trigger to enter the trade. More power to you FXMadness and thanks for sharing this great tools with us

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Hi Wallaa, 1st thanks for your time..I am already using the same templates,i have created them myself previously.The issue is,by placing the pairs we want to trade the list in the "include pairs" That list then get filtered by the ccfp or strength settings of the indicator and never gives you all the pairs to build a full offline chart. for example,to trade the USD news we would basically need to compile a usd index chart using all usd pairs. Same for GBP etc. I know that it is somewhat against the idea of fxmadess indicator (as that is based on ccfp) but was hoping that the concept could be implemented and used for looking back at basket history,as the offline chart building idea is great.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Thank you imdb, Thats a good idea and workaround ! I will have a play and see how it all works.Thanks you also for your time.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Will not work in the next release because the writer will be build in FXM_Diff.

Jdva The line on your chart, what MA is it? It flows nicely with the candles.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Lol, this strategy is becoming interesting. Has it got a better advantage than what we are using now, or you are doing that because of the problems people are having with the installation?

--- 帖子 #359 ---
It's kind of hard not to make $ with any settings really. Just some settings will yield higher gains vs others. So in the test I did, the one that yielded least amount was 1) D1 CCFp The one which yielded the most was 1) 15M Strength 2) 30M Strength and 3rd test was the same as above, it just that I ran a separate scanner same way couple of hours later and locked it then. I set the breakout lines, went to bed, woke up to all the pips in all 3 baskets. I did however remove few suggestions around USDJPY, USDCAD for example as those pairs were exhausted as I didn't want to lock in any trade margin into something that was going to be stuck. Denis

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Brilliant ! IT WORKS ! Thank you. Just in case anyone wants this,the instructions needed a slight modification to work for me.(might be a version issue) I only needed to change the pairs list in the FXM5-09.txt then when you ok the writer it updates the second file with correct pairs. I just needed to change the name of the second file generated FXM0-09#05.txt so it matched .... so changed file name to FXM5-09#05.txt Instead of FXCM0-09#05.txt Then the ea reads the pairs correctly. Its the weekend so I do not know if the chart will update correctly yet but so far so good. Thank you loads for your help,this would have been way beyond my capabilities.

do you mean FXM_TTM.ex4? if yes then it's not a template it's an EA so you have to put it in experts folder. btw i notice that the offline chart has a "bug" idk anyway i do short trade for 1 basket, the candle in the offline chart keep going down but i keep losing pips. anybody else experiencing the same thing?

Hi all, Im getting a few errors when i try to enter a basket (attached in screenshot) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Not sure if its related but i was having the suffix/prefix problem with the FXM_Diff3 until I changed the "check correlation in baskets" option to false. hope that makes sense, Thanks.

Try this on FXM_TTM

--- 帖子 #418 ---
From the picture it seems that your broker has a "+" as suffix for your all pairs. You need to open the indicator, where it says try to figure out prefixes and sufixes automatically change it from true to false. Then 2 lines lower enter + (plus sign) as your suffix.

Use FXM with EAX and manual reverse does not appear to change Pin signal Attached Image (click to enlarge)

It might be an excellent idea to implement DWMRanges. I just thought, last week, about this ... I downloaded the latest versions EAX_DWMRanges and EAX_APRanges, but unfortunately they were no longer functional. At the moment I'm doing pretty well with TDIvisual and SnR (BtB).

you must wait refresh period to pass.or change it to lower at first shot.and click that REV button to become red.

you are right, dont know what was happening in the morning , re-downloaded the version in the .zip file and is working fine now!! Thanks

--- 帖子 #425 ---
If you have EAX on a M1 chart and FXM is also set to refresh M1 internally. Change the FXM signal from Buy to Sell using Reverse click and wait for more than 1 minute FXM will understandably revert back to the original Buy signal and the EAX pin remains the same - Buy. Use Lock to ensure that reverse is Locked (Sell) and wait a few minutes to refresh EAX and it still does not change the EAX Pin signal. Even use reset Pin in EAX and it still does not change the signal from Buy to Sell using Reverse. Try for yourself. Attached Image

--- 帖子 #426 ---
I did and works fine on my side https://www.screencast.com/t/ZRPMIUXE what i dont get it is why to use lock as long you send signals in EAX pin.with eax you dont need to lock signals,whats the trick?

Years ago when i started trading baskets and wrote the different basket creators it was an eyeopener for me to see that technicals also applied to a basket of trades as long as you use the right basket selection criteria. I use a totally different one than ccfp but the idea stays the same.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
You aren't 1st one to have that error, please check previous posts for Download History script.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Thats a really interesting statement and having watched your charts would seem you are correct.Difficult to get my head around why it works at the moment but I would love to learn some more about it. especially basket construction,as every thing seems to be steering me that direction. I hope you can teach me more.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Yes... I would have never thought that technical analysis is able to working on baskets as well...in that nice manner!

--- 帖子 #442 ---
That should not be a surprised, as world economies are connected hence world currencies are all connected. I like to think of the world economies (and currencies) like a flexable chemical ball, but not a nice and symmetrical one in the picture. Some arms are longer, some arms are shorter, it is not a perfect shpere. Pressures are exerted on this ball (war, droughts, new oil findings....) which deforms its shape. Since all currencies are connected and technical analysis works on one, it will work on a selected basket as well as a baskets that contains all the pairs. But a basket with all currencies gives a different kind of information than a smaller selected basket.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Ive been through every post... so the first zip file contains also ccfp_diff.set, where do i have to put this file ? There is also fxcm _diff3 file that is not in indicators map, is this also relevant(see picture)? I've installed from zip update file the templates, indicators and experts. From the first zipfile i've installed sdsmain file in libraries. The fxm writer file in post 1 who is updated on 6 september must replace the one in zipfile? Sorry for al those questions but i want to be sure ive installed everything correctly Oh i also load forcedloadhistoricaldate with in experts( i use pepperstone demo account so i have no special symbols like eurusdecn. Ive somebody has time to help me with teamviewer... :s Regards

--- 帖子 #444 ---
First of all, you cannot use Windows explorer to tranfer files into your mt4 program. You have to do it from your mt4 program. So you need to run mt4 and go to files --&gt; open data folder and then transfer you files into the appropriate folder (indicator, experts, scripts....). All *.set files go into the "presets" folder. So, simply go to files --&gt; open data folder --&gt;presets forlder and put the *.set file there. For the future reference, any file with the *.set extension goes into "presets" folder. The forcedloadhistoricaldate goes into scripts folder because it is a script file.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Well said. I have been thinking about this also, and we have all seen traders trading a single pair but keeping an eye on a negatively or positively correlated pair for confirmation of their activity. I think this works because it takes the average price action across the pairs in the basket. Since we know that many levels are frequently respected across individual currency pairs the chances of the levels being respected across a basket that ultimately has a level of correlation most of the time might increase ? Just a thought.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
FxMadness I encountered something strange with the FXM indicator. I checked my TO baskets to see if they opened on time, and I saw that the indicator was not showing at all, and as the indicator was not showing anything the EA did not open any trades. You can see in the image below. So I opened the indicator settings and closed it again so the indie would refresh itself and once it did it then showed the suggestions as normal. What could be doing this?

--- 帖子 #447 ---
I have no idea. Did you use a template ? did FXM_Diff loaded through thr trmplate ?

--- 帖子 #448 ---
HI problems solved, it was forceloahistorycaldate that was the problem. I've put it in script folder now. For other members who has same issue. Download the first zipfile ( from that zip you need sdsmain.ddl put in libraries, you can also use ccfp_diff3.set, put that file in presets. There is also fxmfibo indicator place that file in indicators of your mt4. From the zipupdate file you use all the files exept fxwriter that is in indicator map (i think you need the fx writer that is updates on 6 september correct me here if i am wrong) Open your mt4. double click forceaload history (look in your terminal "experts if it is loaded), then follow the steps in post 1.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
What a system, WOW . Thank you FxMadness!!! You are the man. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #450 ---
No there was no template. My charts were just as they were, untouched, I just opened the platform to check up and noticed how the indicator had gone blank. Only after i refreshed it did it display correctly again.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
I am a little confused here, maybe you can clarify. If the EA is taking order from the Fib, why all the other indicators? Or have you modified the EA so it would look at all of them including the Fib?

--- 帖子 #452 ---
I have been testing this system and would like to say thanks to FXmadness for wonderful efforts. I have one question, can we lock any pair in fxmdiff indicator, i know we can lock in CCFm diff, i do suggest same pair lock facility should be also available in fxmdiff. Thanks

--- 帖子 #453 ---
bae67 The indicators are there to confirm the market direction. Looking at the chart, you see a white arrow. It pointed down, so to confirm that this is not a retracement but a reversal, the indicators at the bottom all changed to red. The 1st bottom indicator went below the line to confirm there is strong momentum to the downside, the 2nd bottom indicator changed to red, and its bars were getting shorter. The 3rd bottom indicator also changed to red, the red bars were getting shorter before it went below the line. These all confirm that its a reversal and not a retracement. Hope you understand. Let me add this. Looking at the chart, you will see that the basket price has been moving within a range, up and down, so when the breakout to the downside happened, the indicator on my chart will confirms to me that this is not a fake breakout, but a proper breakout. I have not modified any of the indicators FxMadness posted. I just added my indicators to his TTM template. Read from post 1 all the way to the present post and you will get your answers.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
So, basically it is just for your peace of mind otherwise the EA still will execute orders coming from the Fib. That's what I thought too, but maybe you can trade manually too using the same setup.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Hey guys, tried to open a new offline chart this morning but no candles,fibo or TTM are visible. everything has been working great till today. I have reinstalled the diff3 indi / writer indi / SDSMain but it still isn't working Attached Image (click to enlarge) also, perhaps a little bug, when I try click on the BE button/'allow robot to automate BE' button, it just ticks/unticks the 'profit 2' break button, without creating a BE line on the chart. Attached Image Thanks

--- 帖子 #456 ---
hmm, i kept all settings the same except for changing the indi Trade Level from 2 - 1. with 12 pairs in the basket it worked fine again (unless there was something else causing it?) is there a minimum # of pairs per basket? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Mathematically you can have a basket with two pairs, however, I have heard that five is a good number.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
The BE line will only be placed on the chart when TTM is trading and the BE criteria are matched.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
thanks for the reply guys, i see. about the # of pairs in the basket, the offline chart works fine for me with more than 9 pairs but with 8 or less it is stuck at 100.0 and doesn't display any bars. . Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Read the small print "bla, bla, .... absolutely no refunds ever ....,bla,bla". Mine is doing fine, tested it on M1. When a new bar is generated the line and labels shift to the right. If Nobody else is having the same problem perhaps it is due to the added indicators.

Hi Ive noticed that Fxmmadness and husky (have simmilar trades on there trades list) unfortunate all there gains have been lost in 1 day . To be clear they aren't using fxmdiff ? I'm discovering this system (looks verry promising) but seems nobody has been consistent. regards

--- 帖子 #481 ---
for sure i dont use fxmdiff.and if you look at FXM he also use something else.i dont think is mandatory some TE to have any conection with any thread. look at Catalin last posts what do you think he used there?

--- 帖子 #482 ---
haha yes he uses also different indicator / Don't know what though . Your trading on demo must be some martingale but after double 3 times you stop your trades.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Yes that is why there are demo account, test the limits/breaking points or strength of your system and try to improve on it. Why else would you trade 0.3 starting lot with a martingale on a 3000 account.....or you must simply be stark raving mad. I hope to learn something this weekend analyzing the data. There is always more to learn.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
One thing I learned is when the indicator suggests trading GBPNZD, just say "NO". 4 out of 5 times, bucket will be hugely positive while GBPNZD would be going in opposite direction.

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Hello FxMadness, Looked at your chart critically this weekend and observed somethings I have not come across on this thread:- 1. At the Top left corner of your chart, what one normally sees is something like " FXM6-08#08,M15 ' but yours has the following " GBPNEWS#07,M5 " 2. Just below the Top Left corner, Red colored letter ' SZ ' below it grey letter RS and below that, another grey letter DT. 3. On the main chart, there is the " TREND DIRECTION AND STRENGTH ". 4. The " TREND DIRECTION AND STRENGTH " does not have all the currency pairs, but just the GBP pairs. Please, with your humble permission, will you please give more details and share the indicator and maybe any templates and set files. Will be most grateful. Respects!

Hi, Can any one please explain the concept of Virtual Basket, means do we need to insert "-" sign for lower basket trigger and how to use upper basket.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
youre in the wrong thread my friend.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
From what I see, I think: 1. This basket is specialized one made to trade the cable news. You can have a large number of specialized baskets to trade USD news, CHF news... all you need is keep the pairs that are in the news and deactivate all others, rename the indicator and save the template. The new name of the indicator shows up in your chart. 2. I have no idea. 3. That may be part of the system that he is trying to test and then let us know. 4. The "currency trend and strength" seems to have the ones that are in the news basket not all 28 pairs. This makes sense since you want to trade the news basket not all 28 pairs. It is part of the specialized basket to trade the cable news.

--- 帖子 #490 ---

Hello FXM , thank you for this great tool.A bunch of weeks/months on this , headaches no doubt. I managed to get all this set-up this weekend and obviously wanted to give a try on this amazing new perspective on trading a basket of pairs with your FMX ccfp/str/cc indi . So, I tested functionnality of the buttons ..lines appears , disappear , just as planned . I am now stuck in a "channel" with the basket ... I know that your setup, Indi, Writer, TTM is more for live Visual trading , but London Open is impossible to me due to my local GMT shift -4 ... So , getting back to this "channel" I thought about leaving settings ready for LO , with a kind of breakup strategy looking for 50/70 pips TP setting Break lines buybasket/sell basket ... . I did found the TP line for the buybasket ( green line) ...but I could not find one for the sellbasket TP .... SO , my question is : do you plan to add functionalities to TTM so we can have theses lines ...? - sellbasketTP , sell basketSL ... I tried to squeeze my chart as far as I could , thinking it might appear well below ...then I had a look at colour settings ..just o be sure I did not missed something... Sorry to bother ...did I missed something ? Dank u wel . Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Maybe I could just use my Stoploss line for a TakeProfit as Sellbasket TP ...but then ...if reversal is next door ...no SL is quite freaky ...

Reloaded all indies and TTM ..and now looking as it should be, sorry. Anyway SellTP line would still be great to have... Veel Dank. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Just tested it, i can not find anything wrong. Did noticed that the distance calculations could be a bit better. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Think you have to look at the settings. Take profit pips/pair from farest is the setting for the takeprofit line. It is calculated in pips per pair and from farest means that if you have add trade lines the farest add line is taken as the from calculation point but if you do not have add line, the break or touch lines are the farest. Stoploss in pips per pair always take the break or touch lines as calculation points. Additional if the Stoploss is set on [A]uto the EA will place a stoploss (and trailing when set to [A]) at the opposite break/touch line when it starts trading because that is the point where you placed the opposite break line to start trading the other way and that is a good stoploss.

Quoting nihilist23uk {quote} Fxmadness, Would it be possible to have in "type of selector" a none option,so we can build an offline chart using every pair that is in the "include pairs " list That way we could build a chart for just jpy or euro pairs (or both) etc and create custom baskets to trade. It would also work for news trades as well. I cant see anything like it at all doing searches so it would be a great tool to have. What do you think ?

Yes, you are right. All the settings work. Patience is the key word. Some settings give plenty pips, and some others give a few pips. That is why we have the ADD button, to give you more pips. But you have to know when to use it and when not to use it.

Hi FxMadness, is there any chance of adding a feature that prevents the EA from trading pairs that have exceeded their daily ATR by a certain %, e.g. 110%. I think it will help us by preventing trading into already exhausted conditions, rather than expecting price to reach a possible but unlikely 150%-200% ATR. Thanks

And therein lies your problem.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
OK Fxm - I will figured it out. Thanks. Bomi

--- 帖子 #534 ---
There is nothing "to figure out". You have 9 pairs in your basket and you allow a 3 pip average spread per pair so 9 x 3 pips is 27 pips spread in total. The spread you broker charges at the moment for those 9 pars is 31.8. Since 31.8 is still greater than 27 TTM will not trade (hence the red 27 - 31.8 )

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Hello fxmadness i tried the new FXM_ttm as u suggested, but its not picking the pairs error 5004.. but the old one works just fine.. will it require the new fxm_indicator.?

Thanks FXM. Glad to hear the Ofl button is in good stead (Yes, no problem generating charts ) Now to find settings for a bigger smile

Try this and trade the basket 1 hour before or after LO.

FxMadness why do you suggest locking the basket so early and then only trading it before or after LO? Is locking the basket just before opening the offline chart an trading it not a good idea?

--- 帖子 #558 ---
It is a system created by user Kopratasa and HotPotato. The later has gone commercial so you have to search for his topics on FF.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Thanks FxMadness I do remember you mentioning a little while back about locking the basket 2 hours after TO and trading it 1 hr before or after LO. I didn't fully understand the reasoning around it and you've suggested it again.

Meeeuuuh.....it's ok.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
It's TTM withouy FXM but i created a USD basket and an anti-usd basket containing the eur,gbp,jpy pairs without the usdxxx. If the usd on the FOMC makes a big enough move the eur,gbp and jpy will move the other way for at least the first couple of bars after the news. All was going well until i killed my MT4 and without visual you have no choice but to close. So i never traded this to the end.

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Hi FXM, How does Writer deal with different decimal point values for different pairs ? The reason I ask is that the number of pips during an open trade doesn't always correspond with the chart. For example, I have seen an offline chart where the live candle is above my buy line but is showing a small loss in terms of Pips, and vice versa. This is before the EA has scaled into the position. Conversely I have seen the candle hit a support area and I can be lets say 300 pips in profit, I leave the trade open and look an hour or two later and with the chart hovering around the same support level a profit level of 230 pips in profit (arbitrary figures). So the scale of the P/L seems to vary against the scale of movement of the chart, it doesn't seem fixed (which might be part of the challenges with bringing together a basket). So obviously the basket ebbs and flows and the pairs are changing all of the time, but wondered if you could help me understand why I might experience that phenomena ?

--- 帖子 #596 ---
If you want you may also trade 2 TTMs simultaneously...for instance 1 Str H4,H1 and 1 CCFp D1: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

this might be because of spread not counted.just guessing.thinking at that small difference i dont think is a serious problem to deal with.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
done that several times today...partly trades filtered too Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #599 ---
You might be right but I have found the difference gets larger over time. Check this out (I can't tell you how quick I had to be to catch that): Live trade at 17:38 local time, price level 100.95631 Attached Image (click to enlarge) Same trade 17:52 local, same price level, different P/L Attached Image (click to enlarge) I agree the difference in this example is small, but it definitely can be a much wider gap. For it to be spread surely the P/L would have to be calculated on the bid/ask and the candle on the opposite ?

--- 帖子 #600 ---
You must consider when trading basket there might be inside some big spread pairs.and i guess again the difference you see might be the total basket spread that can be wide on pairs volatility or low on range.but i'm guessing.more will tell us FXM for sure.

--- 帖子 #601 ---
So far today.Not closed yet Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #602 ---
The price level on the offline chart is arbitrary. The only thing that matters is that the profit in pips in FXM_TTM (which is calculated from MT4 open trades) is equal to the distance between the trade open line and the current price (which is calculated from all pairs current price). As long as they are the same the visual aspect (so in pips &amp; distance) of the chart is in order. There will always be a small difference due to the slower update of the offline chart. The other point is adding trades. The writer has no way to know when you add trades to the profitable ones, it will always perform its calculation using 1 value per pair not 2 or 3. So the offline chart is going to run out of pace with the profit and/or loss. The add function was originally only meant for fast (news) basket trades. I did change the calculations a bit and the trade open line will now be placed at the current price + or - the spread depending on the trade direction so that by using Ctrl+F (crosshairs) it will be clearer. Will be released after testing.

Are you using another indicator on this chart to change the candles' color (or are these the actual candles)? I have never seen so many red and green candles following each other in a row.

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Bae67 It's an indicator called "ADX CANDLES". Am not using my PC at the moment. Am using my phone. I have the file on my PC. But am sure you can get it on the FF forum. Try this link https://www.forexfactory.com/attachm...6&amp;d=1469328138

Interactive Brokers offer MT4 too if I'm not mistaken, I would say they are as trusted as they come.

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Hi FXM I am working slowly through the threat, I am nearly 2/3 up to date. I have some questions, hope you can advise: 1. Referring to LO 02:05. Do I need to leave my PC on over night to catch 02:05 pairs? The alternative is if I start my PC 04:00 in the morning, and I run my diff setup with 02:05 in "Lockat selection at GMT" will it auto look in the history to lock the same pairs in? 2. Getting back from work in the afternoon, 16:00, would it be best to change "Lockat selection at GMT" to current time to get the best possible pairs for a current trade, or should I at least -X hours on the "Lockat selection at GMT"? (If need to use X, what is the suggested value for X?) I am trying to understand how the system work and at this time would like to understand the function and impact of "Lockat selection at GMT". Attached Image

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Thanks for clarification. It somewhat resembles renko candles that's why I was curious. I will read up on it to familiarize myself.

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Interactive Brokers is based in the US which means leverage of 1:50 and FIFO.

--- 帖子 #617 ---
My understanding is that the indicator does not have the ability to look back and find the pairs in the past. I have heard many times that you need to have the PC on. Even FXMadness once said (jokingly) that when he buys a new PC the first thing he does is to glue the on/off switch so the PC always stays on. He thought of himself as a slave owner (the PCs being the slaves).

--- 帖子 #618 ---
The strategy is based on locking the signals give two hours after TO (not LO) opens so yes, your computer must be on. If you see a clear trend just after the signals are locked you can probably trade them right away until LO-1 at which point there could be a reversal. At LO (or just after that) you either see the reversal continue or it could be that the trend from the Asian session continues and in that case you could just re-enter the basket in the Asian session direction. I have no idea if this works with ccfp but is usually does with my own calculations.

Why would you turn your pc ever off ? I even have UPSes to make sure they never go off. Those Puerto Rican home traders are going to have withdrawal symptoms.

FxMadness, Your explanation is spot on, but this shows that there must be a particular setting. Are you using the original "FXM_DIFF" with the 'set' file?

--- 帖子 #622 ---
I am sorry, i do not use FXM_Diff to trade baskets this way so i have no idea if this also works with it.

--- 帖子 #623 ---
FxMadness, I don't think I got you right or maybe you did not understand my question. Am asking if you use this indicator below, in addition with the TTM EA? Attached Image FxMadness, I thinks I did not frame my question well. What I was asking is that, on page one, inside the zip file, There is a file by name "FXMDIFF". Its in the template folder.

FxM, there's anyway one could add to the trade while in DD? Currently, the Add trend line only works if the current position is in profit. Once you have a trade open you can't click the long/short either. The idea is to have the capability to build your entry @ an average price. Tks.

They only way i think is to do it manually because TTM does not look at the profit here.

Did the most recent bar close below the sell break line? If not no trade was supposed to be taken, switch from line to bars or candles and it will be easier to see the close. Also try touch lines and buying or selling by pressing the long or short button to rule out it you have problems with the EA.

Hi CFTA, Thank you for your help.I followed your instructions. On clicking the Long button it started trading but it is not taking start with Break &gt; Start Trading.

Once it is done ....on the indicator there will be some basket writing number appearing ...something like FXM03-15 ...( example) ...Then you go to your Metatrader ..File .. OPEN OFFLINE ...and in the list that appear there you should fing your basket *FXM03-15* ( example) ...and you open this chart only. Hope this helps ...return to me if it is ok .... if not ..I can try to make screenshot of my setup ... Attached Image (click to enlarge) NOW I CAN SEE THAT THERE IS ANOTHER PROBLEM ...MAYBE YOU RESTARTED YOUR MT4 , maybe not . BUt your Fxm Indicator has UPDATED ..and not showing the same pairs you are trading with the EA TTM .. , they are disconnected and your basket chart is not updated ...since Writer is not there anymore. As FxMadness theses days ..you lost the VISUAL ...and so , the trailing function that is on your chart is useless ... CLOSE THIS before a reversal ...and start all over.

Hi FxMadness thanks again for an awesome strength indicator as I'm having great success with it thus far. I have a question that maybe you can help me out with? I've noticed that when the FXM indicator refreshes the whole MT4 platform freezes momentarily, and only once the refresh process is complete then platform unfreezes and goes back to normal. Is there something that can be done so that when the FXM indicator refreshes it doesn't freeze the MT4 platform? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Very nice, thank you! Plz take a look at the lock at GMT time function. The writer does not seem to be working when it auto locks.

--- 帖子 #666 ---
They are really quite heavy calculations. I'll see if i can limit it a bit.

--- 帖子 #667 ---
This one should work correct with auto-lock.

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Thank you FxMadness I understand and appreciate it. Sometimes when I doing work and then suddenly everything freezes and then I think somethings wrong and then I realize that its the indicator refreshing lol.

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Hey, I'm not a pro coder so I'm not certain if my reply is accurate however it sounds like you either have a lot of FXM_Diff indicators running or your computer is lacking in performance. I have 14 Diff indis running simultaneously and only experience the platform being slower to respond for a few seconds but the terminal does not freeze but I also have a computer with pretty good performance. Theoretically virtully all coding can be improved and optimized for calculations being executed more efficiently and requiring less computing power but FXM may alredy have done this or it is too advanced to be done. Anyway please tell us more about the success you have with the system. I am testing it with focus on lower timeframes, mostly M15 with M5 charts, using both the TTM and EAX depending on the setup, looking really promising

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Thanks this is a terrific improvement for using multiple charts, you seem to figure everything out so fast and easy FXM It will be much easier to open several charts sorted by currency

--- 帖子 #671 ---
auto-lock works fine now, tks. I've noticed that any appending to the first 7 chars does creates a new offline chart; however, TTM still thinks it's a duplicated basket and does not allow trade on the "clone" if there's already a trade open on either of them. So for now the workaround is to create a new name/number limited to 7chars. My suggestion is to have a random number generator for the writer offline chart names. I think that 4digits, 10k possible combinations should be enough [FXM-XXXX], this way it would simplify things and no need for user input.

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Using a random number generator for basket names will make you loose track of your writers and your charts. I have tried that in the early stages. By looking at my writer window i can exactly see which writers are active and by looking at their name i can see what kind of chart they are writing. Attached Image SC2-13#15 is fi. a Sell Combi started on Tuesday with 13 pairs running on a M15 chart and that combination will generate a unique magicnumber in TTM. I will do it differently for FXM and incorporate the FXM_Diff unique id (which is mandatory) into the basket name so i can take out the edditing of the field and have FXM_TTM generate a magic number based on that. For now you can use a FXM_TTM setting.... Attached Image

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Try this set. Chart name is FXM[Day of week]-[number of pairs]-[indicator id number] TTM magic = 100 + dayofweek + numberofpairs + indicatoridnumber.

--- 帖子 #674 ---
Writer is working as indicated and TTM is able to distinguish the baskets and trade them fine. Just the TTM magicnumber is trowing bad calculations:

Well, they are unique...

Might be a good idea to update the files and instructions on setting this up if it has changed. Do I use the files on the first post or do I use one or all the updates on the last few pages? Will the op templates still work? I see you say the last FXM_diff3 has a new writer, Do we still post the indicator thats in the orignal post? OMG it is only noon here lol. I need a hug, cry and a beer. I have tried multiple times to get what looks like your great strat going. Thank all of you like FxMadness, Wallaa, Husky77 (please don't be mean to me), Lionannix, for trying to help us blonde noobs with boobs lol. I have been trading for a couple years now and have never been so messed up setting up my mt4 with an EA. I am ready to bang my head against the wall even with all of your help. Yes I have read all of the 35 pages (3 times actually and took notes) and I am more messed up each time because of so many people having so many problems getting this working. Could I please ask one of you amazing people who selfishly pay if forward to do a video with step by step instructions on setting this up? If also you can take it a step further and show in the video how you actually trade this strat including setting up your trades. Many of you are showing great results and I would be nice if you share what exactly is working and what you found doesn't work. I have to stop now, maybe just a little to much coffee this morning.

Update: I removed the FXM indicator from the chart and reloaded it fresh. After doing this is it seems to have fixed the candles on the offline chart so all is looking good now.

--- 帖子 #694 ---
i manage to get it to work using tpl from imdb. should i change the chart refresh timing to 4hr instead cos once fxm_diff re-calculate the offline chart is disconnect. how do i solve this issue?

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Once you have locked [Lck] FXM_Diff it will not re-calculate.

--- 帖子 #696 ---
FXM-LATEST update, complete ( in post #1 ) Wicks or no wicks is an option in FXM_Diff3 FXM_TTM generates an extra breakeven line (white dotted) to show you the approx BE (includes spread, slippage and commissions).

Hi Angela, agree that everyone should master a system, so is important to understand what's behind the scene of every system we plan to use. I would suggest before getting in any system to read "Trading in the zone" this was a game changer for me and you can check my results in trade explorer that i achieved after reading it. Cheers

Hi, maybe I read wrong but I can not define a basket. How to choose currency pairs? Thank you

--- 帖子 #699 ---
With permission from FxMadness, my brother from another mother, there are certain pairs that move a lot according to this site https://www.mataf.net/en/forex/tools/volatility I therefore created some templates of the best moving pairs for the following time frames D1 H4 H1 M30 M15 All of them are on Level 2, so gives very few pairs. If you want more pairs, drop to Level 1. Greetings to you all. And more GREEN PIPS to you all. Let's help each other to make this system THE BEST!! I salute FxMadness, Husky, IMDB, MRDFX, Liovanix and all those who have contributed to make this thread amazing. Thanks to you all!! Attached File(s) moving pairs.rar 46 KB | 298 downloads

Sorry, my English is bad. I mean how do you put the currency pairs in FXM diff3? Thank you

--- 帖子 #703 ---
hi, for this issue above, can we select from ttm which pair we wan to trade instead? like check only the pairs we wan to trade? but the offline graph created from diff3.ex4(is more meaningful with more pairs, right?)? as i see the option when we wan to add on position using ttm to a certain pair in the offline chart, there is an option for it right? i like the fat moving pairs rar file.

--- 帖子 #704 ---
No, you can not. FXM_Diff3 is the main indicator and it selects the pairs.

--- 帖子 #705 ---
For this and to help with the calculations cpu slow down, it would be nice to have an option in the FXM_Diff to bypass all calculations and only look at the include pairs list. Of course, it would be neat to just have an option on TTM to look at the pairs you want to track, but if it's not possible this could be an alternative. One part of the FXM_Diff calculations that I would like to keep if you want to trade specific pairs only without CCFp/Strengh/CC filters is the pair correlations selection.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Thank you FxMadness for updateing the op. I will try to get it up and running for the tenth time lol. Sgalizia thank you for offering to help me. I did a search on "Trading in the zone" and about 10 things popped up. I don't want to hyjack the thread could you please message me with a link to where I can find information on this. I am a new member to ff even though I have been lurking it for a couple years. I am not able to find a way to message you as a noob member. I am always looking for ways to increase my profitability.

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Please help me. Ok I have cleared all previous indicators, libraries, experts, and templates. I have installed all the files in the FXM-LATEST.zip in their respective folders. I have created a new chart. I have used the template FXMDIFF on the new chart (does it matter what chart or any random one is ok?). This is what was created, please note there is no basket option only offline button. Also only two pairs out of the 28 stayed on screen. When I used the template others flashed on screen for a second then disapeared. Is this right or have I done something wrong? Why dont I see more pairs?

--- 帖子 #708 ---
Of course you only see the pairs that FXM_diff3 selected based on your input settings. Now press [Lck] to lock the selection and then [Ofl] to start the offline writer. After pressing [Lck] you see a chart name appear like FXM4-xx-yy now that is the name of your offline chart. Go and open that offline chart and load the template FXMTTM on it and you are set to trade.

--- 帖子 #709 ---
It's 2 ways 1. These are the pairs the indicator thinks are the best to trade at this very moment 2. More pairs wanted: drop the trade level to 1.

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Thank you Wallaa for your help, your the best. I did the next steps as per FXMadness replied (thank you). I was just concerned about not seeing the BSK button as is in the instructions on the original post. But if pushing the off line button is the same all is well. I am trying to follow the instructions as they are written exactly. FX just so you know, I didn't put or change any input settings. I just installed everything and used your default settings in your template as you posted it. I didnt want to mess around with it yet till I know everything is installed correctly. I have opened the offline chart that was created and the two pairs are there. I have taken a trade on the two pairs that the strat feels are best. I need to say thanks again to FXMadness for doing all of this for us.

https://www.forexfactory.com/attachm...1&amp;d=1506934016 Walla my new best friend. I see your using a indicator that has two of the indicators I use in my trading. The TDI and fib in one indicator, this is the first time I have seen this. Would you please share, I would love to check it out. Also if you don't mind could you share your settings on this setup. I see you have a great set of correlating pairs to basket trade. Yes I am creeping your posts ;0)

--- 帖子 #712 ---
To show different pairs you can edit the settings within the FXM indicator. You can select W1, D1, H4, H1, M30, M15 etc, and you can select between using TF, FF, FT, TT settings, and also different trade levels, all which will produce different trade suggestions form the indicator. Try using D1, or H4, to start with either TF or FF at level 2 or level 1 for more suggestions, and go from there.

--- 帖子 #713 ---
The TDI here. I believe you have FXMFlipFibo ( https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...5#post10305705 ) Outside this thread I find Quickfib my best Fib as it draws the trend lines ( retracement Rectangle ), bullish or bearish colors, trend pivot ( topPrice and bottomPrice ) and also let you see the Retracement Remaining.

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Hi AngelicaMari, Everything am using on that chart is pretty standard, you have it with the template "FXM_TTM". So load your template and drop these 3 indicators on the chart. For the settings, I was using the GBP NEWS SETUP file from here:- https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...2#post10274132 . You can try any setup. They all work. The point is, you will trade the one that you see wanting to breakout from a congestion area. You can also trade reversals and continuations . There are lot of videos on YouTube which will teach you how to trade those techniques. Attached File(s) ANGELICA.zip 51 KB | 316 downloads

--- 帖子 #715 ---
My advice is to use the EAX Dashboard instead of TTM for trading which makes it easier to add on trades to a certain pair or close a position on a pair and leave the remaining open. The FXM_Diff has an input for EAX pin in which you need to enter your selected pin number (1-6).

HI So after some testing, the fxm with break lines, i have some doubts. So the baskets give you signals, so why using break lines (long and short)when pairs go against signal of basket ? an why not put random pairs together and use offline chart of those pairs? First weak was good, locked and opened offline chart 1hour before London markets opens. I used break lines. Last weak was terrible all days loss. So is this no gambling to just use break lines? why not use break lines on just eurusd. And more people should share their settings.

--- 帖子 #720 ---
First, why don't you ? I mean trade eurusd using breaklines. (warning function expires on 1-1-2018). Attached Image (click to enlarge) You do not have to trade against the basket signal just remove the buy or sell breakline and you are trading (if triggered) in one direction. Or do not use breaklines at all, just press long or short when you think the basket should trade. FXM_TTM is just a visual trade tool which helps you to visualize the basket behavior, the fibo levels of that basket and if you can find a good S&amp;R indicator to see when and when not to enter the basket trades. It gives me a better idea in how to trade a basket than setting a arbitrary time to start trading the selection like o well, 9:02 gmt. Does not really make sense to me and to a lot of others that see their basket run straight to Stop loss on Mondays. FXM_TTM is not an auto-trader, it does not trade for you. It is an assistant for your own trade skills so you do really need them. Without those skills all types of trading are basically gambling.

not autotrader? and i thought... ohhh need skills? thats sad and 2018 is coming

--- 帖子 #723 ---
Hi FxMadness, First I just want to thank you for your work of genius and contribution. I'm also getting a "zero divide" error when attempting to load "FXM_diff3" indi. I turned correlation off as you suggested and it worked once, but now the platform stops responding everytime I try to turn correlation off until I remove the FXM_diff3 from indi folder. Any ideas what might be causing the issue? My broker is Ig.

--- 帖子 #724 ---
Couple of reasons for zero divide: 1. Broker does not support all 28 needed pairs. Find another broker. 2. Not all 28 pairs are shown in the Market Watch window. Set the Market Watch window to "Show All" 3. Not enough historical data is loaded Run the ForceLoadHistoricalData.ex4 script and wait until it is finished 4. Broker uses a non-detectable suffix or prefix like .m Turn off the auto prefix/suffix detection in FXM-Diff3 and fill in the prefix/suffix used manually.

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Thanks FXM Script did the job all good.

Lock in the Asia session. Looking at the chart i saw no indication for a major reversal (topped out already) so just a sell breakline, no adds and a take profit.

I've been following quite a few bascket trading threads. This is definitely one of the best. Now we're really trading, not gambling. IMHO offline charts is the only logical way to trade basckets.

--- 帖子 #733 ---
@FxMadness I've followed your suggestion and I lock the basket at 02:05 GMT. The problem is trading at LO, as at that time I'm still sleeping lol, its 04:30am my time so I miss to trade LO and open the basket manually, and when I check the offline chart when I wake up, I can see I missed the good move and its to late to enter most of the time. Do you have any suggestions so I can still make use of this great offline chart manual strategy?

--- 帖子 #734 ---
after you locked the basket then i guess you can set your break lines on the levels you want then just set MM and click EA ON to trade when break lines are broken and you can go to sleep.

--- 帖子 #735 ---
Flaw, It is even to me a bit unclear when and what you exactly traded.

I used your set up for the first trade. The second is with small modification of FF insted of TF.

100% manual. I only trade when I can monitor it and react to price action. Same day trades only and try to avoid major news. If it's not working out, get out. The beauty of trading baskets is that's plenty of opportunities to get out at BE or little profit due to variations of so many pairs. Yeah ik Husky

@FxMadness, I took Husky77's idea and after the 02:05 GMT lock, I set a break just before I go to bed which is around 03:00 GMT. I set the TP and SL and left it as I'm not awake for LO. I've been doing it this week, but it seems like a gamble as some days have been a win and some have lost. Not being able to monitor the charts and enter manually is the issue so I can get the entry timing right. I wish there could be a work around as I really think this is a great strategy for manual basket trading.

--- 帖子 #747 ---
Yeah, didn't think that was going to work because you lose the visual aspect of the basket and you need that to set the expected break lines and your take profit. So you either have to wake up at LO -1 or stick to the FPB and XMess method.. I have not found an automated replacement yet.

--- 帖子 #748 ---
Yeah I think an alternative that I'll test now and see how it goes is to lock the basket when I wake up an then load the offline chart and just follow along and see if I can catch any moves when NY and London sessions are open, hopefully then I can catch a few pips there. For example I saw that I missed a nice 500+ pip move today if I had traded the NY and London session using the offline chart. I won't give up lol.

--- 帖子 #749 ---
FxM, would it be possible to kick off the writer automatically after the basket has been locked? This way it could help to start printing the offline chart when you use autolock function while you are not in front of the screen. The on/off writer could be embedded with the Lck button. Tks.

--- 帖子 #750 ---
I do fail to see the point in it because an afterwards generated chart is the same as a manual opened chart (except for the wicks id set). But of course it is possible. True/False setting just below the GMT lock setting.

--- 帖子 #751 ---
Awesome, tks. Having no wicks on historical offline chart is helpful to reduce rollover noise on dead hours market. I find it helpful to capture the real time bars with wicks after the writer has kicked off at your go time, so when you wake up to trade you can see what's cooking.

--- 帖子 #752 ---
FXM, a humble question just to clarify. In case a broker is missing one of the 28 pairs, is it not possible to circumvent the problem by using the selection settings in the Diff3 indicator? My broker is missing one pair but it is not an option for me to switch broker since mine offer a few huge perks to good to pass on So currently I use another broker's platform for running the indicators and charts on demo and my main broker for trading, if there is any solution of course it would be a major benefit to be able to run the indicator on the platform I trade. I figure the probability is low but it does not hurt to ask, thanks. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Yes , I will say amazing results from Flaw.When I first saw so many Fxm Diff Indi's on one single chart with the same settings and activated "pin's" I thought it was a one that just run out of the "ignore me-iranian connection" with a bunch of indies (repeated). Then later I understood that he was writing several offline charts with different time frames 15,60,240,1440. So, as a manual trader (should) do , checking higher times frames for confirmation.As he seems to be Flaw(less) in his approach , this would be indeed interesting if he could please share his amazing method ..( at least part of..lol) . On another topic: I have a little problem with TTM (unfortunately could not capture secuentials screenshots) that could demostrate what I will explain here : When TTM triggered and going into "green pips" zone , at a certain level Additional trades are taken , adding 1 and then adding another one when conditions are met.This is a great feature ..when all the pos+.pairs are gaining pips ... so , at a certain time I had 0,03 NZDCAD , 0,03 EURGBP , 0,03 EURJPY others pair with 0,01 lot. Just after the 2nd adding to NZDCAD being then 0,03 ..this NZDCAD started to reverse badly...so , I decided to close 0,01 lot ( part of the position) of this pair in red ...TTM dashboard showed me then correctly 0,02 .... NZDCAD went even deeper so , I repeated the close of (part) 0,01 NzCad to leave only an open 0,01 on this pair. TTM was still displaying 0,02 . I "pushed" the close button a secong time , then I watched the dashboard in details ..and could see that with my second "push" close on little widows that pop-up with the NZCad symbol ...one position of my EURGBP ( in the green pips) was closed..and another push on NzCad , closed an EURJPY ( in the green pips) ..leaving then 0,02 on all 3 pairs that were formerly at 0,03. I am not yet using the newest TTM version ( mine is from late Sept.) but I wanted to ask here if it happened to other folks here...with the newer version. Market is now closed , so I can't test this now. Ok , Huston ..I have another question ; my computer had to be restarted ( windows update stuff ..you know) , so was my MT4 obviously ..and I had a great ...but a great "feeling" that this would be -the one- 800 pips trade "yo-yo" basket coming back home ..(reversal) ....lol. So the indi's indicated it. BUT , as FXMdiff then logically updated ( altough with market closed) calculating latest high-low of friday ...the lock on FxmDiff was released and obviouly the offline chart of the GOLDEN basket will not be updated.Only few of the pairs of this disconnected basket were left ...70%...others are now new suggestions. So , question is : is there any possibility to reconnect this offline chart to the pairs actually being displayed on TTM ...or maybe a script , entering .mqh files to get this basket back to life . ? For sure this happened to several here ( MT4 not responding, power cuts, etc) Then it came up the following idea ...while smoking something we grow here (lol) ... why not ReBorn the FxM BASKETWriter ...totally not dependant from FxmDiff or Ccfp,CC, Strength ...some uppercase to select in/out pairs (+EURGBP,+EURUSD,-USDJPY) for buy EG, buy EU, Sell UJ (example) and we all could have back our "floating baskets" back. EDIT : - I have Re-read whole thread , part below is not to be considered as I missed some posts where this suggestion was already mentioned and clearly/gently answered as not possible for now.Sorry. As this thread is Titled FXM and TTM I think I am not ( too much) ouf of topic asking for the Reborn of a renewed FXM Basket writer totally editable that could be traded with the TTM Visual abilities.We could also trade a basket of (un) correlated pairs , a GBP/USD/JPY pairs for news on these specific pairs , a basket of pairs which are pick/sorted according to other Indi's ; RSI/SLOPE, IKH , HAS ,etc... Question is : should I keep smoking or go for a beer ? Sunday is popping up here at GMT-3 . Have a great Sunday folks &amp; thank you FXMadness for all the nice toys you are giving us here , the time and the care you spent on this is HUGE.

--- 帖子 #757 ---
That was indeed a bug, thanks for discovering it. I solved it but have to test it first after the market opens. EDIT: This one should work. It tries to find enough trades for the selected pair to close the size you fill in to closesize box. So if you have 3 0.01 trades and you specify close 0.02 and click close it will close 2 of the 3 tradess.

--- 帖子 #758 ---
I basically trade your strategy, only with minor modifications. The main addition is of course the multi timeframe charts. I use 5 of your FXM DIFF3 indies with different "Chart timeframe" to set up M5,M15,H1,H4,D1 offline charts. Now we can trade any way we are familiar with. Attached Image The 5 charts are for testing purposes. In actual trading we don't need that many. I trade the H1 offline chart, using M5 for entry and H4, D1 for direction. The most ideal situation is that D1,H4 and H1 being in the same direction. Otherwise I never trade against H4. Most of the time when the trend is clear I jump right in without using the "Break" option. I use 21 EMA Close and MACD or Stochastic. Actually any oscillator will do. The colored MACD is called Tipu MACD. It is provided by OANDA with my demo account. I don't know if it's appropriate to post here. Since we're trading basckets. We are trading a numer of pairs simultaneously thus I suggest to give ample rooms to stops. I use the previous swing high or swing low on H1 charts which sometimes could be in the neighbourhood of 200 pips. However most of the times the profits still make the R:R acceptable. I very often use trailing to exit trades. I'm sorry I can't post the indi that I'm using because it's proprietary. It looks something like Parabolic. I'd suggest someone to write a trailing stop indi based on ATR or ADX. It's very useful. I try to avoid high impact news. Last Thursday was a good example. You took the chance and traded 2 basckets. FxMadess I know you don't need this detailed explanation but there are other thread followers PMed me asking the same questions. Hope I have all their questions answered. I also hope more people will test the system with me. Attached File(s) fxmadness.tpl 297 KB | 323 downloads P.S. I use a 55" TV for monitor.

Thank you Flaw for sharing your method here ...at the beginning I was not understanding why opening 4/5 offline charts with the same FxmDiff settings..but his make sense now.Since you are in this for a while ( few weeks?) ...could you spot better results using CcFp , Strength or CC or combo's ? Do you also trade the reversal , when all selected pairs are exhausted ? Thank you again . Stephan .

--- 帖子 #761 ---
So far the best results came from FXM's original setting that is CCFP &amp; Strenth D1 TF Lv1, locked at TO+2, opened at LO+1. But sometimes FF setting outperforms it. I generally select the settings with more pairs hoping to have more balance. Most of the time I only trade one bascket a day except like last Thursday when trend changing was so obvious. But that one bascket could last for days. I hope that I could ride the trend to exhaustion.

--- 帖子 #762 ---
I'm basically a lazy person. I don't follow individual trades. I only follow the whole bascket. Of course my trade results are not that desirable, but I can live with the losing trades. I take them as the cost of tradig basckets.

--- 帖子 #763 ---
You can never be as lazy as me. I let the basket be locked by the system. When i wake up, look at the chart, set my breaks, tp/sl and adds and i never look at it again. So in total 15 minutes work a day. Sometimes when i get bored i setup a news basket to trade but only when i am really bored. However i do use a completely different (commercial) basket selection method, i do not use FXM_diff.

Very possibly I'm going to use the same method too.

Pairs are swinging within thir daily range, those are not the "movers and shakers" of today. If you however like this kind of trading i suggest you change the break lines to touch lines and then press [R] to reverse them. A sell will be opened at the top and a buy at the bottom. Personally i like the breakout baskets better. Especially if 9 pairs do a 1000+ pips a day. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Yes I love this kind of trading. I'll try your method next time.

Thanks FxMadness I'll definitely give this method a go and see how it works out. LO +2 is perfect for me, and just when my alarm starts harassing me.

Kssstt, go away ! No just kidding. If you have to rely on good luck for your trading you are better off not trading at all. Same goes for if you can not handle a bit of bad luck (and that seems to happen all the time).

You have to ask "The Flaw" if he changed the FXM_diff selection criteria for LO+2 or if the are the same as TO+2.

OOhh , I missed this fact/interpretation ..that we DO have Sell Limit/Buy Limit orders then . not only sell stop &amp; buy stop...Great. I was planning to give a try to the "set &amp; forget" Monthly chart ...offline charts &amp; using TTM. Trading MN chart both ways ...buying at tle low's selling at the high's ... so , this function is perfect for few swings in the month ..... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Almost there. I agree with you FxM. I like breakout trades. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #788 ---
No limit orders, just plain old market. But it gives you a change to trade reversals. Basically the same as you seeing a top and placeing a sell breakline just beneath it and deleting the buy break line. Yes, you can remove break/touch line if you want to trade only in one direction.

So I tried the LO +2 lock and opened the offline charts when I woke up, but both offline charts were not showing much opportunities for entry so far. Perhaps its my selection, I'm using Strength D1 TF L1, and Strength H4 TF L1. Maybe a different selection would have been better?

Many thanks for your advice FXM. I have tried replacing the pair in a number of ways during this week but the problem persists, I keep getting the zero divide error in the experts tab (it is very unlikely to be due to lack of historical data since I downloaded all using the history center and the EAX dash is working fine). I also downloaded the version of FXM Diff which you attached in your reply. Do you have any further advice or perhaps it is not possible to find a way around this problem? Thanks again Attached Image

An unlock selection @ will also mean that the basket writer will stop writing to the offline chart. I am not sure that is what you want if you happen to be in a trade.

Hi FXM, Thank you for your Indicator contributions. I have been demo testing now for the last past 3 months. Quick question...Is it possible to display the same set of pairs (lets say the core 14) all the time from the Included Pairs list in your input, rather than the indicator picking out the best correlation from them? Basically, I want to overwrite the CCCP input values and instead display all the Included Pairs and then create an Offline chart to study. What I'm trying to do is benchmark the CCCP suggested basket pairs with a constant controlled set of basket pairs. Currently, if I input 14 pairs in the Included Pairs line, not all of them are suggested depending on the other input values. Is there a way to do this? I thought I read a while back on FPB's thread that if you put like a "-1" for the Selection Level criteria or something to that effect it would display all the pairs. But looks like that is not true as I can't get it to display all the pairs. Thanks again, Z

All the Monday basckets were stopped out with loses or marginal profits. The displayed basckets were opened on Tuseday or Wednesday. Still have to thank you. Couldn't do it without you.

--- 帖子 #837 ---
My testing so far suggest that any setup (H4, D1, W1) could be profitable. We should select ones with clear trends and preferably with more pairs. Adding trades to winning basckets is a good strategy. One good bascket in a week is suffficient. TO+2 to lock, LO+1 to open as FXM suggested are still the best times. Hope this will help.

--- 帖子 #838 ---
Hi Flaw, After you open &amp; lock your basket, how long do you set it locked for (when do you refresh the pairs list again)? You showed some charts where the entry came after a few days of running. And I notice some of your settings are based on D1 or H4, so curious if you are resetting and locking the chart at TO+2 on a daily basis for a new set of pairs? Thanks, Z

--- 帖子 #839 ---
I usually open a new bascket at LO+1. Then stay as long as the trend lasts. It could be days before I start another one.

--- 帖子 #840 ---
Hi flaw, Do you wait with the basket if there are no breaks at LO+1? Or you would still open it? Thanks

--- 帖子 #841 ---
Hi Master Fxm , I do not want to mess up with the almighty TTM visual tool. But , if it is possible to automate Start Trading at a certain GMT time it would be a great addition . I am able to lock my basket at TO+2 since it is 23:00 here @ GMT-3 ( +/-) ..now the LO+1 is still not possible for us which are living the other side of the Atlantic ( Mrdfx , Embry and a bunch of others) . Your strategy , tools , I must say woaahh ( this strength "stuff", slope style..kudos) .... Because of the GMT offset , I need to stay away ..because unable to press this green button at the right time. When I wake up , it already happened. At this moment I just flip the coin ( while locking at TO+2 and activating Start Trading inmediately before going to bed) . So, in the name of GMT minus guys ( Brazilians, Canadians, US Citizens, South Am , Caribeans , Amazonians.lol) , I beg you to have a look in the TTM if we can have this marvel to start trading on its own at a GMT (or broker) user defined time. This will be also valuable to trade news releases , while away or offset and would be valuable if one day you decide that this ( fantastic ) tool need to be licensed. Thank you to have a look at this HP.

--- 帖子 #842 ---
If the market is ranging I'll wait. Most of the time the patience is paid off. (I gave an example before) If the trend is obvious I don't use the break option just jump right in.

--- 帖子 #843 ---
How do you imagine that ? Suppose the basket is locked and you carefully set your TTM break, add, stoploss and take profit lines based on what you see on the chart at that moment. You set TTMs alarm clock to start trading let say six hours later and while you are sound asleep and dreaming about Janet or Draghi (who ever you prefer) the price goes through a break line, through eight add lines and when the TTM alarm goes of is just a couple of pips away from your take profit line. Do you want TTM to open all nine trades (break + eight adds) just for a couple pips to the take profit or even worse just before the reversal ? Also "do not trade when broken before" has little use because in a lot of cases that would have happened already because you set trade breaks looking at the current chart and not the chart in six hours. Neither can TTM generate break an add lines for you at the alarm time because it does not have the intelligence to place them properly. TTM is a manual trading tool to easy by moving lines manipulate your trading, it is in no way an auto trader. Is does not recognize fibo lines, support/resistance, moving averages or any kind of that stuff, that is something you have to do. I think you are better off using Jesses XM7 trader together with the the locked FXM_diffs and a virtual basket. Also an option is the dashboard EAX from user Aeseme. It has a lot of additional filters and FXM_diff can generate a pin signal for it which will stay on if you lock FXM_DIFF. On a given time EAX can start and use it's additional filters (like avoid +/- pips around fibo levels or pivot S&amp;R) to take trades.

--- 帖子 #844 ---
Hi FXM , thanks for answering. Xm7 or Aeseme EAX will certainly do the basket opening at a settled time you are right.Not sure how to set "break lines" with theses though.With Xm7 I can use a VB which behave like a breakline when VB trades are kicked in real after reached 50/100 break UP.When I say UP ..this is because Xm7 will ONLY turn the basket real if the breakline is broken UP ... ( unless I reverse the Fxm signals or reverse in Xm7 settings) ..so , there will always be only one line to be broken. I will try to have a closer look at EAX DB if I can tweak some pin's or settings to have the job done. I really like the Offline chart visual of TTM , which allow me to "see" my basket. I use to set the breaks as a "channel" using your Fibo levels indi. So, this is why I was asking for. It is obvious that TTM is NOT an autotrader and will never be. At TO+2, i can set my breaklines, my STOP's I never set a TP ....TTM trailing stop do the job perfectly. I still have to understand the Lock settings which are NOT clear to me. I can still have the good of both Xm7 and TTM "visual" basket , turning Xm7 ea off and loading TTM on the offline chart with the same magic # when I wake up.TTM triggers basket opening even when breaklines are 200 pips away from the original setup ...I just wanted not to leave these 200 pips to the market makers ...

Small bug fix.

--- 帖子 #851 ---
I've experienced this behavior several times. At the end of the candle, the price (only the picture printing) retreats considerably forming a long wick, that wick is then filled back at the beginning of a new candle. This affects the semi-automatic trading feature on TTM [Break line trades], and that's the reason why I only trade manually when I'm in front of the screen. I'm not sure if that's the place to look at, but I've tried both ways (true/false) on the fxm_diff3 setting for "push HiLo instead of calculating it". I wonder if there could be any possible fix for behavior. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #852 ---
What are the fxm settings, tf of offline chart, how many pairs fi. in your eample.

--- 帖子 #853 ---
15-16 pairs all current on strenght D1, CCFP_TF D1, and CCFP_TF W1.

--- 帖子 #854 ---
It is probably at the point where you start the chart. That is the point where the writer goes from calculated wicks to pushed wicks. But that should then be only when you set push wick. I haven't noticed it before so i have to observe it before i can solve it. Be patient.

Not really, those are live candles. The writer was kicked off @ 2gmt. Btw, the auto writer kick off with the gmt lock got broken with some of yr latest diff3 releases.

Hi Fxm , I did not traded on monday.Tuesday they were BOJ/News JPY ..that might affect the TO+2 lock basket ( 4 pairs of 9 were with JPY) . So, I did not trade either. Although in demo , I have busted so much demo accounts that I try to behave now like if it was for real , thus maybe slowing my learning curve ..maybe.New toy is ready for LO opening tomorrow ...calm day , bank holidays , this should work. Will report here ..no doubt. I did played few hours ago with the NZD red news release ..for a green 40 pips results that might have be much higher if I only had pressed " start trading" while on touch ...although this saved me of a whiplash that would have triggered in the wrong direction ( lol- lesson learned) when I finally realized that my forgot/mistake it went short in the right direction but I had still to wait minutes before spreads get down ...to get the pairs basket orders filled... , I had then time to set my SL , pressed the BE button ..all ok ..trailing . I could find a settings on Fxm that displayed 5 of the NZD pairs ...not all the NZD unfortunately.... I miss so much not to be able to add them manually AUDNZD and NZDJPY were literally flying ( 100 pips &amp; 70 pips respectively) as expected because of NZD strong relationship with its pal AUD and their master of the region ( Asia) the JPY ...I could have made 200 pips easy on this ..in 5/10 min. All this on a 1 min offline chart. TTM is ALSO a excellent NEWS trader if we could just add pairs missing in strength/ccfp display ...selling when the pair is the base currency , buying when not ..or the opposite ..and at NEWS release being able to catch part of rocket tail ( or submarine) .. Today were really good news for NZD ...so Fxm Diff suggestions were traded reverse / sell basket. This was my 1st experiment using this way. So, confirming TTM versatility AND an amazing, valuable , MUST HAVE tool. Advise to those who wants to try this NEWS approach ... No SL ( at least no tight SL - it will get hit then reverse - whiplash effect) , widen a little your spread limit ( +50% maybe) to get filled with market orders . I lost ( left on table) 80 pips before orders being filled.( because leaving max spread at 3.0) ...on NZD pairs ..on NEWS ..3.0 pips = nada. So, I know ..I know , ...if , I could only have done this , done that...nooby trader blabla....lesson learned ...make 40 green pips ..could have made 240/250 if all 7 NZD pairs and widening spreads allowance.

Hello FxMadness, first of all i want to thank you for this powerful tool. It´s really very helpful in trading. In basket trading im a newbie but with your tool i think i can work. I´m trying at the moment different Settings. I have one question - see the screenshot below. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I bought at 14.06 and set after that a buytouch (reverse) as seen on the screenshot - but this buytouch wasn´t taken by the expert. So is it possible to add this function to the expert? Thanks, sweety

--- 帖子 #865 ---
Hi Sweety , sorry to "jump in" ..so , you already have a BUY in progress ..and want to add another BUY while in DD ...is this what you want to do ? . This is a Grid trading approach ..( which is not bad) . I did tried this to play with the toy. It is not possible ( for now) , but what you can do ( I did it ..works ok) is : opening another instance of the same offline chart and load another TTM to it ... so , you can add , martingale , edge ..whatever your trading style is... . your new TTM will have a new magic number generated , so in fact you will be trading 2 baskets of the same pairs , but with ENTRY at different level , you will need an EA that monitor profit dd equity ..maybe TP SL TS .... or just a script close all ..while looking at your terminal pips count ... EDIT : maybe if you set same magic number for both TTM instance ..would work ...try it and report please ... maybe is just messed up al pip count ...quite sure of this , ..but maybe not.

--- 帖子 #866 ---
Hi stefdek, thanks for your answers. Yes you understood me right, i want to add another buy, while the basket is in DD. I will try it your way and report tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #867 ---
Try this but i do not know if it works. It is difficult to test because you have to be on the wrong side of a trade for that. You have to turn the "Only add to positive trades" of in the settings. Once you are in a wrong trade like this Sell going wrong, click on add to generate add lines. Then select an add line and drag it (them) to the place you want to add to the wrong trade. Again not sure if there is coding to prevent this currently, i have to look into it. Edit, TTM removes the add on bar close, so you do not have to try this for now.

Sorry but can i ask a few questions? 1. I did not set a target profit initially for a 'buy' trade. After going up for some pips, i decided to go to sleep and set a profit line..but the profit line is now below the current price. When i try to drag the profit line higher up, it closes my trades at the current price. How could I circumvent this problem? 2. For the add line, is it added when the price touches it or break? Because sometimes it opens extra trades at the 'add' lines but sometimes it do not. And I am sure the spreads are within limit. A bit confused with the add lines. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #876 ---
2. That depends on the settings, both break and touch are possible. Attached Image 1. is a bit unclear to me but is sounds that the trades where not automatically closed even after the take profit line was reached ? Did you allow the robot to close trades ? Attached Image I think that you don't have a screenshot but could you next time make one, a picture says more that a thousand words.

Attached Image (click to enlarge) Hello fxm, Sorry but can I ask something. Looking at the profit/loss of each pair, why does it not all add up to the total profit/loss? I know I am overlooking something simple.

--- 帖子 #879 ---
The total profit under P/L is calculated using the profit the broker reports in the Account History. That is the profit +/- swap and -commissions so the net profit. If you click on the small [p] button the p/l is given in account currency and should match up with what your broker is reporting.

Hi Fxmadness, Today I have built a chart with only two pairs as selected by indicator. EURCHF SELL AUDNZD SELL why when the chart shows a break to the downside and i use the ea and take a sell why does it select a buy for both pairs ? it looks like chart is upside down. I was trying to time the entry of xm7 ea today ,but based on your chart this would not be possible i would have to reverse everything. when EURCHF and AUDNZD drop in price your chart rises. Thank you. D.

The "price" of a basket (right scale) is an indication as to how the basket pair/directions are doing. If that price goes up the pairs taken in there original proposed direction is correct and profitable. When that price goes down the basket is not performing because the pairs move in the opposite direction and trades should be taken opposite to their suggested direction. Just like minus times minus is positive, sell times sell = buy.

ow ! ok, I see what you are saying now. Thanks for the informative reply mate. Makes sense now.

This problem seems to be related to the TTM bar end indicator. I have not experienced this behavior after removing it from the TTM settings. Attached is the old P4L CandleTime indy that works fine with TTM.

--- 帖子 #884 ---
Hello funcoupons, Sorry but are you sure it is due to the TTM settings? Because I notice the same scenario even when I did not use the TTM EA.

--- 帖子 #885 ---
Indeed it has nothing to do with the bar timer. It has to do with the difference in time between the close of the bars over different pairs. As said MT4 only closes a bar when a new ask/bid arrives outside the current bar end time. This means that although it is time to open a new bar (in real time) not all pairs old bars are already closed (bar close means new bar open where the open price == the close price previous bar). This is more likely to happen when you have more pairs or slow ticking pairs in your basket that is why it sometimes occurs and sometimes not.

--- 帖子 #886 ---
You are right, I noticed it again later. I meant to delete the post but got busy. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #887 ---
thanks for the replies fxm and funcoupons. Is there anything that I could do to minimize this effect fxm? Thanks

--- 帖子 #888 ---
Certainly, the line trades are not reliable on TTM. Manual entry and exit based on $ is what I've been doing. TTM is very useful for you to track a specific currency trend. GBP &amp; EUR are normally the top movers of any trading basket. Just watch any currency strength indy and you'll see GBP and EUR on either top or bottom of the meter. So why not trade GBP &amp; EUR crosses only? There's plenty of pips to be made with these crosses without the need of having 16 open trades. It would be really great if we could somehow input the pairs of which we would like to monitor on the offline chart. I played with some diff settings and got locked with 2 baskets, one for EUR and other for GBP crosses only. I haven't turned off my PC since then afraid of not being able to catch those pairs again In the picture attached, you can see 4 days of pip movements of the GBP crosses basket based on TO(yellow), LO(orange), US(blue) sessions. Plenty of pips to be made each day. IMO, 15min charts is enough for you to see what's happening with the currency when you are tracking all of it's major crosses, if you are a longer term trader you can clearly see the top forming on the GBP basket.

--- 帖子 #889 ---
Although i do agree with you that the pond and the euro are (at the moment) the big movers Attached Image (click to enlarge) but i think you are limiting yourself if you do not include the other pairs. The pond and euro do not always provide the movement you need, sometimes it is the other pairs. They will also help to stabilize the overall basket. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #890 ---
Due to the lack of interest and sharing i do not have any plans on further development of this system. I will make an exception for this FXM_Diff3 update which solves the problem of the "funny" bars.

--- 帖子 #891 ---
I will say that I really like this approach of trading baskets, and thank you for developing it. Being able to get a visual representation of the basket and not trading blindly is really good, however personally it's been hard to make proper use of it due to the time difference. Unfortunately the best time to trade the basket is LO +1 which I'm still sleeping as I've mentioned before. I still use the offline chart to check overall basket direction sometimes, and its strange as whenever I check the offline chart it seems I already missed the move. If you do plan on any further development I'll be there.

Like wise ! you have created a very valuable tool for baskets and should be very proud of your work. Its a shame that it will no longer be evolving. The only suggestion Ive made before like a few others is a way to create your own basket which would make it complete. But Its a great tool,thanks for creating it.

Although this thread is not long but it contributed more than almost all the other bascket trading threads. FXM I hope you'll reconsider. I think more traders will join us in time.

If I can offer the opinion of a lurker, I think one reason this method hasn't attracted more attention is that it was a work-in-progress up to this point, and the current best practice(s) and method aren't fully understood. A manual/guide would help. Of course, people must be willing to do the work themselves, but it's clear human nature tends toward laziness. So, the most popular threads are the easy-to-understand systems, whether they work or not.

--- 帖子 #896 ---
this tools to work require manual observation and manual setup.now days those threads where coders share tools are full of newbies who mostly are in search for holy grails that make money for you while you sleep or when youre at fishing.from here is simple to understand why not so much activity from the masses here.make something automatic put it up and they will jump on it no matter if you say in first post will not work.is just the way that 95% treat this business called forex,no wonder why that big part is the loser part in this.

--- 帖子 #897 ---
I can understand your point of view. However IMHO one can't be successful in forex without basic knowledge. Despite the fact that I've been involving in forex for manay years I only trade sporatically. So I still consider myself to be a newbie. If I can use this method successfully so can most of the traders. All systems are forever in development. This system has great potential. I'm not advertising "getting rich quick". This bascket is making more than 150% of the account balance so far. (aiming to triple the account) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I agree 100%. The difficulty is compounded since there is little consensus about what those basics might be.

--- 帖子 #899 ---
To me the most important techniques are to differentiate the trending and ranging markets, to identify the supports and resistances, not trying to trade the tops and bottoms, to live with the losses, nobody can be correct all the time. Of course they are easier said than done. All the techniques need forever improvement.

I would have gone out a bit earlier but i am using the T1 or T2 from FXM_fibo as my TP targets. Close trades and i never look back "to see if it could have been more", in the long term that is going to work against you (greed).

I agree with you. I'm getting too greedy. T1, T2 should be good enough. However they sometimes don't show properly in the H1 chart. I'm using an old indi to replace the FXM_fibo.

Nice basket but nzd&amp;aud reversed somewhere down the trade. Not paying attention ? :-) :-) Set one FXM-Diff using CC D1 or H4 to signal you if one of the currencies start not to play nice. CC signals much faster and with TTM (individual box) you could manually close those trades. It will mess up the correlation between the basket writer (offline chart) and your trades but that is just something to get used to.

--- 帖子 #916 ---
Never used CC before. I'll try it. Manually picking the bad apples out from the bascket is definitely a good idea. Thank you for the mentoring.

FXM-Diff using CC D1 or H4 with TF or TT can you recommend?

If you use CCFp for selection you can use CC with the same parameters. CC reacts just a bit faster than CCFp and will give you the edge on turning pairs.

FxMadness I've been encountering something strange with the lock. I have it set to lock at 02:30 so I can trade it after LO, but I've noticed that in the morning when I check the basket the indicator does not display the offline chart number. As you can see below it only says locked, but with no offline chart number so I can't see which offline chart to use. If I click lock again the basket refreshes and then it shows the offline chart number, but the list would have changed.

Oi, meu amigo mrdfx campiao do Mercosur ...what Version of FXM Indi are you using ?? .

Ola stefdek yes the version I'm using has that function, let me set it to true and see if it fixes the issue, thanks.

--- 帖子 #930 ---
So I tried your suggestion of start offline writer on lock, but the same things happened so it didn't work. I hope FxMadness has an idea that can fix this as using the offline chart is very beneficial to anyone trading baskets.

--- 帖子 #931 ---
stefdek, friend, if you want to try this. Do not unsubscribe from HGI. On the graph, both versions (HGI_v16.09 and HGI_v17.00) are on purpose. The second one is with a Hurst filter. The first is rather a comparison, at least for me, and I noticed giving a landmark alert. Two 10.2 TMA slope v.1.4B 4.30. One is with period 5 and ATR 100 and the other with period 11 and ATR 100. Other indicators are not important except the channel. They are set to see how they deal with offline graphics. Choosing a basket on Monday is one of several flaw variants. Thanks for his activity and advice. I choose a basket that has at least 7, 10, 12 pairs. No more. I review each currency with the potential, and all other baskets are deleted. The selected basket is locked for a whole week. Profit or loss, I take it every day. This week, I have no losses. My rule is not to be greedy. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) stefdek, приятел, ако искаш опитай това. Не отписвай HGI. На графиката, нарочно са сложени и двете версии (HGI_v16.09 и HGI_v17.00). Втората е с включен филтър Hurst. Първият е по-скоро за сравнение, поне за мен, а забелязах подава сигнал за ориентир. Две 10.2 TMA slope v.1.4B 4.30. Едната е с период 5 и ATR 100, а другата е с период 11 и ATR 100. Другите индикатори не са важни освен канала. Сложени са да видя как се справят на офлайн графики. Избора на кошница в понеделник е от няколкото варианта на flaw. Благодаря за неговата активност и съвети. Избирам кошница, която е с поне 7, 10, 12 двойки. Не повече. Преглеждам всяка валута с какъв потенциал е, а всички останали кошници се изтриват. Избраната кошница седи заключена цяла седмица. Печалба или загуба, всеки ден си я взимам. Тази седмица, нямам загуби. Правилото ми е, да не съм лаком.

Thank you and FxMadness! Please do not stop this project. It has potential. Tests take time. I know how important feedback is for programmers. But we, as traders, can only make a proposal or report mistakes. Personally, I have not encountered mistakes. Probably because I always download the latest version of FXM_TTM and FXM__Diff3. You will probably agree that if I have no suggestions and I have not alerted myself to mistakes (they just did not show up to me), that does not mean I do not test your products or I do not like them. Since 2012, I rarely use baskets on a live account and manually managed. I create baskets and I manage with other products, but the expert is old, heavier and for me there are superfluous things about your FXM_TTM. Over the past month and a half, I've cleared up my idea. Please consider an independent version of FXM_Writer from FXM__Diff3. This version has the features we already know from the latest version of FXM_Writer and I have no idea why the Renko graphic dropped out, it is also useful. The basket can be managed with FXM_TM. FXM_Writer to create baskets at the discretion of the merchant. It can pick up the list of pairs of .txt file or directly pairs on or off. There are many advantages, but most of all, the computer will not have to be permanently switched on, with a locked list of pairs. The worry disappears if the computer restarts and then the same basket is re-run. If a basket is created from FXM__Diff3, then the same list of pairs can easily be created. If some pairs in the list created by FXM__Diff3 are weakly volatile or in a losing direction. You close them with FXM_TTM, stop the expert, start FXM_Writer by removing these pairs. The offline graph is now managed by FXM_Writer, and the basket is again managed by FXM_TM. Naturally IDs and Magic Numbers are the same because they have open positions from the original basket. The offline graph will be the right one. The big tails will disappear and it will look normal. The indicators will better reflect what is happening. The Show Wicks feature of FXM_Writer remains, for some indicators queues are essential. For example, Pin Bar, Inside Bar, and so on. you know better than me. At the start of a basket during important news, couples who are not too affected by the news can be easily removed or couples later added to the basket, waiting for other news, a few hours later. For example, GBPUSD for positive GBP news at 9-10 GMT will not react as it will react at 13:30 to 14:00 GMT. I hope I do not dream so much. I'm just looking for more independence and managing baskets and I'd be glad if you got the chance to do it. Thank you again! Благодаря и на теб FxMadness! Моля те, не спирай този проект. Има потенциал. Тестовете отнемат време. Знам колко е важно за програмистите обратната връзка. Но ние, като търговци, можем да дадем само предложение или да сигнализираме за грешки. Аз лично досега, не съм се сблъскал с грешки. Вероятно, защото винаги изтеглям последната версия на FXM_TTM и FXM__Diff3. Сигурно ще се съгласиш, че ако нямам предложения и не съм алармирал за грешки (просто не са се проявили при мен), това не означава, че не тествам твоите продукти или че не ги харесвам. От 2012 година, рядко използвам кошници на живо сметка и ръчно управлявани. Аз създавам кошниците и управлявам с други продукти, но експерта е стар, по-тежък и за мен има излишни неща, спрямо твоят FXM_TTM. През последният месец и половина, изчиствам една моя идея. Моля те, помисли за независима версия на FXM_Writer от FXM__Diff3. Тази версия да има познатите ни вече възможности от последната версия на FXM_Writer и нямам представа защо отпадна Renko графиката, тя също е полезна. Кошницата да може да се управлява с FXM_TTM. FXM_Writer да създава кошници по преценка на търговеца. Може да взима списъка двойки от файл .txt или директно да се включват или изключват двойките. Има много предимства, но най-вече, няма да се налага компютъра да е постоянно включен, със заключен списък от двойки. Отпада притеснението, ако компютъра се рестартира и после отново да се управлява същата кошница. Ако е създадена кошница от FXM__Diff3, после лесно може да се създаде същият списък от двойки. Ако някои двойки от списъка създаден от FXM__Diff3 са слабо волатилни или са в губеща посока. Затваряш ги с FXM_TTM, спираш експерта, стартираш FXM_Writer, като премахваш тези двойки. Офлайн графиката вече се управлява от FXM_Writer и отново кошницата се управлява от FXM_TTM. Естествено ID-та и Магическите числа са едни и същи, защото има отворени позиции от първоначалната кошница. Офлайн графиката ще е правилната. Ще изчезнат големите опашки и ще изглежда нормално. Индикаторите ще отразяват по-добре случващото се. Функцията Show Wicks на FXM_Writer да си остане, за някои индикатори опашките са от съществено значение. Например Pin Bar, Inside Bar и т.н. знаеш по-добре от мен. При старт на кошница по време на важни новини, лесно могат да се премахнат в последствие двойки, които не са много засегнати от новината или да се добавят в кошницата двойки в последствие, които са в изчакване на друга новина, няколко часа по-късно. Например GBPUSD при положителна новина за GBP в 9 - 10 GMT, няма да реагира така, както ще реагира в 13:30 - 14:00 GMT. Аз се надявам, че не мечтая толкова много. Просто търся по-голяма независимост и управление на кошници и ще се радвам, ако имаш възможността да го осъществиш. Отново ти благодаря!

Hey FxMadness another strange thing happened with the writer today. I have 2 indicators on 2 separate charts and the writer created the same offline chart number for both indicators, so the offline chart was not giving accurate offline chart.

Hi Mrdfx , "me" again ...yes , I had same problem several times till I realized that We need to change pin id number for each Fxm Indi ...in your case , although fxm Indi´s are on different charts ...I can see they both display id.1 ... so , switching/changing this id number will solve your problem .

Maybe it will help also , if you use several offline charts with THE SAME FMX selection Example : Strength D1 TF Lev2 for writing offline charts 5 min , 15 min , 30 min , 60 min .... you can set id. 5 , 15, 30 , 60 ...240 will not work ...( 99 limitation) ....

8/21/2017 MANDATORY UPDATE Install everything, especially the two dlls SDSMain.dll and BDMnextgen2.dll Before you can use FXM_Diff3 or FXM_TTM you must run FXMSetup.ex4 from the experts folder. FXMSetup will check to see if you have all the required symbols (28) active and if requested load all needed historical data. It will also write a key to the windows registry. (Don't worry it will only set a local key to run and does nothing to the outside). I will get back later on the enhancements.

Hi FXM, Today market is open and I have got one more info for loading FXMDIFF.tpl: FXM__Diff3 GOLD+, H1: zero divide in FXM__Diff3.mq4 (2521,17) FXMSetup run from Experts folder did not recognize any currency pairs... (NZDCHF is not listed with X-Trade Broker ) Pls see attached screenshot from experts tab. Could you pls help me to solve this problem (1. registration by FXMSetup - maybe you can make entry to exclude currency pair e.g NZDCHF 2. Why I can not load FXM__Diff3 on any chart of my MT4?) Because of point 1. and 2. I am unable to Lock and start Writer for offline chart and proceed with FXMTTM.tpl EDIT: FXM__Diff3 from page 47 is loading on X-Trade Broker charts - but only with setting use correlation=false and include 27 pairs, exclude NZDCHF+ and replace NZDCHF+, CADCHF+ settings. Have a nice day Mike

Mierka, Sorry, a bit late. FXMSetup does not register with me, it uses the registry. Your broker has mixed currencies like eurusd and eurusd+. Setup will find the first one and think that there is no suffix. Step 1, try this one by filling in the "+" as suffix on the input parameters.

--- 帖子 #966 ---
FXM_Diff3 gives you the manual inpu on prefix and suffix so setting the auto feature to off and a "+" on suffix should work. Indeed you have to replace nzdchf by a pair that you think is suitable. Best way is to look at long term correlations and find a (most of the time) correlating pair to replace the missing pair.

Hello FxMadness, Thanks a lot for your reply. Attached version of FXMSetup with prefix and suffix entries worked fine with X-Trade Broker. I appreciate it very much. FXM_Diff3 indicator if giving me hard time while I try to load it on the chart as my MT4 terminal if freezing (X-Trade Broker). The only way to make it work again is to change name of used profil. XTB is very strange broker and I thing that will not work with them for long time. Have installed ICMarket MT4 terminal - demo account and everything is working like a charm. Sorry for inconvenience caused. Wishing you a nice evening Mike

Hello, I get a zero divide error in FXM_Diff3.mq4 (2534,17). Can you fix this? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #972 ---
Chris, You need to load history. That might solve the problem.

--- 帖子 #974 ---
Yes D3 you got it ...there is NO USD template ..it is only to play with the FXM settings on monthly daily weekly whatever TF FT TT FF strength , ccfp , cc ...so , at some times within 14 or 16 pairs suggestions ...you will have the ones you are looking for , to be able to select EUR only pairs USD , CAD , etc...and form a basket at your taste .... These tools are fantastic ..( I am not playing with them right now...this is why I have no share theses weeks) .

--- 帖子 #975 ---
What's that, not ?

--- 帖子 #976 ---
4hours apart. Had to Hold on, was getting screwed. Thanks FXMaddness

--- 帖子 #977 ---
I think i would have placed the Sell break line just a little bit below the Lw major support line. That would have saved you some DD. And if you are sure (seeing the trend line) that S1 was going to act as a Resistance you can drag the SellAdd0 line to that level so it is going to work as a reverse sell entry (line turns red when dragged above the current price).

Thanks Sir! thats a lesson there.

The development and support for FXM_diff3 and FXM_TTM are stopped. This due to the lack of interest and sharing. I will go out with a bang and show what you can do once you found the right settings. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi FxM, I would like to thank you very much for your huge contribution to that thread and for very hard work you have shared with us. It is not true that there is lack of interest. I use FXM_Diff3 and FXM_TTM on demo with ICM but so far no luck with finding good settings to post here. Still trying to figure out how to find proper settings. Have a lot o green pips Mike

Hello, First I wanna thank you FxMadness for this beautyfulll tool to analize basket. I absolutly agree with u that there is really good setup. I recently use your wirter and payed indi form market and acording to historical data it is reaaaly promising, but i need to test it at live account to be sure and then public anything, thats why I didnt participate into thread with post, but i participaite quaietly with test. Anyway thank u so much.

--- 帖子 #990 ---
Very sad to read this but I do understand. You had a great system and we had fun testing. I learned a lot about basket trading which inherently lowers the risks and all because of you. Thank you for all you did.

Hello, I try to use the idicator but it tells me that it is not registered. I run the FXMsetup, and I give it in register but it does not register. what should I do? Is the indicator still operational?

--- 帖子 #992 ---
I belive and checked on histroical data that THIS monster can produce stressless 2000pips per month in two trades This month I started live and first part of 1000 pips is done (I was always loosing on live so I still little untrusty too my ideas, but evrything works as I predict). I will let u know in ~3 months if I am right. I know that support of this tool have been stoped, but can I have one technical question? I bought indicator form market and using it on your chart, and its doing its magic, but this indi have option for notification on email about signals wchich wroks on normal chart perfectly fine, but on offline chart I dont get any emails... ;/ Is the cause an indi or the way of creating chart? Thanks in advance...

Hello, I would like to ask for explanation of functions of FXMBobokusFibo indicator. Thanks in advance for any help. Mike

--- 帖子 #994 ---
why is my chart different from yours? i have loaded all the indicator and template you gave me.

--- 帖子 #995 ---
Courtesy from the FXMTeam based on the idea of another FF member. The new trade level options let you set different levels or different ranges for trade levels. Also the equal or better can be set separately for both levels. Purpose is to select pairs that are not absolutely strong against absolutely weak in order to get a smoother trend ride without large retraces due to big money profit taking and stepping back in again. Couple examples. Single levels Attached Image Match 7 and above against -5 and below for buy and vv for sell. Level and range Attached Image Match 7 and above against -2 and -3 for buy and vv for sell Both ranges Attached Image Only match 5 against -2 and -3 for buy and vv for sell

Good to see revived thread ... thanks ummmmmm Fx????---

FXMadness/FXMTeam, I found this thread while searching for a Basket Trading Management EA/Console and was so impressed that I read the whole thing. Very well thought through and programmed. . I have used FXM_ Diff3 in the past as part of an EAX setup and loved the indi, but I have started trading baskets in the mean time and more specifically the C5 and C8 baskets off Fib levels. The reason I moved away from strength based indi's is the same as what you've posted above: "large retraces due to big money profit taking and stepping back in again." I find the C5/C8 Baskets a lot more "stable" in this regard, and when they are ranging, to look at what JPY7 or EUR6 is doing as a whole. My question is if there is any way to manipulate a file that will allow me to select my own pairs to be included in the basket - or whether the Writer can be configured with an option to input own pairs apart from FXM_Diff3? Your feedback will be greatly appreciated. Many thanks again for the time and effort to create this tool. Cheers Lee

FxMadness, FXMTeam: Is it possible to implement the calculation formulas of the "CMSM" indicator of Grandaevus? I think that mixing the calculations of the "CMSM" with the flexibility of the "FXM_diff", combined with the EA "xm7-CCFp-Diff Daily Trade Monitor" of Xmess7, would get a very powerful tool. Thank you.

What causes this error?

--- 帖子 #702 ---
Hi, You must run the file FXMsetup.ex4 from the Expert folder of Metatrader

--- 帖子 #703 ---
Ok

--- 帖子 #704 ---
Flaw, are you still using this thread...? If yes, can you show me how to use it, it seems very interesting and useful. Thanks. Regards.

--- 帖子 #705 ---
Hello everybody. I think that this indicator is very good and therefore I believe that a series of EAs should be implemented that could use the power of this indicator in a way that would work autonomously. I have done a test with a version of the Solarwin indicator that does not repaint, but I have introduced the currency pairs manually (I lack knowledge of mq4 language). It would be necessary to write a code that would select the currencies indicated by the FXM_Diff to apply a specific EA. The idea is to create a basket of currencies (all or some of those suggested by the FXM_Diff indicator) and apply an EA that works automatically. The concept is similar to that of EA T101 but instead of fixed currencies, with the currencies suggested by FXM_Diff. If someone can help in this, it would be well received. Thanks.
