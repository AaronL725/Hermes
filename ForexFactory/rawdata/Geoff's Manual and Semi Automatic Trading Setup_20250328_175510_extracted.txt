Hi guys, Firstable i would like to thank Geoff for his great system, which is located here , all the benefits go to him first!!! I was asked by many members in the thread and finally by Geoff himself to start a new thread, dedicated to manual and semi automatic setup, based on his strategy. The idea behind this is discover, adapt and discuss his system into different market conditions, pairs, timezones (etc) to make it more perfect then it is right now ))) So any new ideas and setups are always welcome! So let's take a look at this. -- original system description this is a Tokyo session breakout system, it uses 2 smas - 10 and 197, and 2 sets of fractals, from M15 and M5, to enter a trade, which must be made between 23:00 and 0:00 by GMT. The idea behind this is an observation that if cable has a long setup at this particular period of time, it should continue to go this direction some more time (same for short). it works ONLY on GBPUSD and ONLY after Jan 2009. -- difference of this set comparing to the original Geoff's EA: basically, this set works pretty much the same as the Geoff's original EA, but has a couple of addons and modifications, so here they are: - no trade hour, so you can enter a market any time when signal is produced - many options to adjust settings for fractals and sma's - ability to place pending or market orders - 2 options to trail pending orders (not trailing stop!!) before they become market ones - "Fast" and "Slow" -- EA settings description: -OpenOrders - how many orders you can open up to (from 1 to 3) -Magic1,2,3 - manually defined magics, it's highly recommended to change it (so you will see the pop up message about) -PendingOpenStep - a distance between current Bid/Ask and pending order price -MovePendingOrder - if true, pending order will be moved -ManualMode - show/hide a pop up message before place a trade -Order2,3BeLevel - amount of pips where break even stop loss will be placed for each of second and third orders after first order will be closed by take profit -IsBrokerECN - if broker does not allow to open a market order with take profit and stop loss values filled -ReverseMove - amount of pips, which ea will keep pending order(s) trailied to opposite side of a market, when the price is reached, pending orders will be deleted (example : ea places 3 BUY STOPS by 1.45100 with ReverseMove = 100, market became go down, orders keep trailied down as well, when price of a 1.45000 is reached and orders are still pending, ea will delete it and wait for a next signal) -LabelsCoordinate - coordinate of a first Label from the indicator's text panel, placed on right side of a chart, if you need to move a whole group down, increase this number -M15FractalLockedBar,M5FractalLockedBar - important options, means number of closed back bars where ea should begin to look for a fractal, 3 is a default (example : lets say we have M5 chart, current, unclosed bar, lets say 15:42, is considered as 0 because it still unclosed, ea will look for a fractal starting from a 15:35 candle and the very first candle where it will consider a locked fractal is would be third candle back, 15:25, if a fractal if formed on that candle, it will return its mode -M15FractalFor2HoursOnly - if true, ea will consider a M15 fractal as valuable if it was formed only during last 2 hours -OrderPlacementCode - option to choose one of the 4 different setups to enter a market (please refer to the table below) -OrderTrailingOption - if = 1, refers to "slow" trailing, if = 2, "fast" trailing -AdjustOrdersTakeProfit - option allows to change take profit of only 1 (if AdjustTakeProfitForOrder1 = true) or for all (if AdjustTakeProfitForOrder1 = false) ordes to a new value, set up in the NewOrdersTakeProfit, TakeProfitAdjustHour sets up an hours value when this change will take effect -AllowOnlyOneEnterPerHour - if true, ea will not open a trade (even if all the fractals and sma's are in agreement) if there were opened trades during current hour ok, thanks for reading all this, sasha http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/s...im/winking.gif P.S. thanks to TradeRunner for .pdf compilation *************************************************** Versions log : v3.1 - added option ShowAlert option (will show/hide pop up message before place a new order), fixed sma's name in the indicator's pop up menu v3.2 - added option to place market options v3.3 - added option to define a current broker as ECN. here is important thing - if your broker is ECN, but you will set him as not ECN and will try to place market orders, ea/script will do nothing and there will be no errors/messages in Experts/Journal tab!!! because MT4 does not allow to catch GetLastError() in this case! v3.4 - added "Fast" and "Slow" option for orders trailing (not trailing stops), if FastTrailing chosen, orders with take profit and stop losses will be moved pip by pip if market goes in opposite direction, but when ReverseMove will be reached, they will be closed v3.5 - nothing new, just the same version # for all the files and small changes in the indicator v3.6 - added a func : if user has chosen to change magics but finally did not change it, ea will show a warning message and will not open any trade v3.7 - added broker name, account # and currency pair name on the pop up message before place a trade v4.0 - combined indicator and ea into one file v4.1 - added option to place buy and limit orders (limit orders trailing works only with "Fast" option, if "Slow" chosen, it will not move), also, added Slippage option v4.2 - added option to set up a separate lot size for any order v4.3 - added option to hide/show message in the upper left corner v4.4 - added notification which type of order (LIMIT or STOP) is in use v4.5 - added time on entry box and order's comments field v4.6 - added option to allow enter a market only once during 1 hour candle (there are many cases in backtest when second or third enter is ends up with loss after a first which is in profit) v4.7 - added option to show/hide highlighted bar on the chart v4.8 - removed option to place 1 order v4.9 - added another one, fourth, way to enter a market, since there are many of names got changed, please refer to the table below to see the options and features : Attached Image (click to enlarge) v5.0 - added option to adjust take profit of 1st (or all) order(s) after particular hour (TakeProfitAdjustHour) to a particular value (NewOrdersTakeProfit) v5.1 - added "pips counter" option - after # of hours defined in PipsCounterStartHour all orders will be closed when summary amount of pips is greater then PipsCounterExit. just keep in mind - if you have a big percentual difference in lots sizes, positive amount of pips is not necessary means a profit in real money, so because of this all orders will be closed when a summary of pips will be greater than PipsCounterExit and summary balance of opened orders will not negative v5.3 - added 2 more simple moving averages, with ability to set up a period for each one

--- 帖子 #2 ---
Well done!

--- 帖子 #4 ---
as of before, yesterday i decided again to enter a market ignoring the indicator's values - i placed 3 buystops at 1.52571 and finally got 2 take profits and one b/e, total of 82 pips and very sorry about BUYSTOP but not SELLSTOP orders ...

--- 帖子 #5 ---
For those of us unfamiliar with the thread would you summarise what its about since after 483 pages its a fair bet that it doesn't much relate to the first page anymore. Thanks

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Sasha. When you say automatic do you mean I still have to okay the trade.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
ok. here it is - this is a Tokyo session breakout system, it uses 2 smas - 10 and 197, and 2 sets of fractals, from M15 and M5, to enter a trade, which must be made between 23:00 and 0:00 by GMT. The idea behind this is an observation that if cable has a long setup at this particular period of time, it should continue to go this direction some more time. it works ONLY on GBPUSD and ONLY after Jan 2009. just added to the first post.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
will change it, will add a pop up option to EA, any other things work ok?

--- 帖子 #9 ---
I'm with you sashasan. Mac.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Wow, sasha, you did it! Thanks so much.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Dutchsignals, I see you lurking!! I was going to pm you about this one. s

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Thanks for starting the new thread. I have irony this am I have V16 working the NY session live and I'm down a bit and I'm testing the New hourly and I'm up but demo. I want to root for the new manual system but I don't want to loose live pips The Irony of FX So to be clear the Tokyo breakout will only place stops not market orders (hence break out) or did I miss something. Also an optional alert in the indicator would be helpful thanks for all the hard work

--- 帖子 #13 ---
yes, you are right. for rigth now it opens only BUYSTOPS and SELLSTOPS orders, however can be changed and added market ones as well. alert will be turn down optional too. no prob

--- 帖子 #14 ---
thanks sasha this ea is a pretty good worker and it's even profitable. i attached it to GBPJPY on M5 and all sell stop orders closed in profit +25, +23+ 18

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Are you saying 197 EMA and 10 EMA is both up or both down on cable? I'd guess 197 could be up but 10 EMA down. should be no trade.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Shasha, did you update those files since yesterday? I mean, should I download and replace it. Or those are the same files? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Sky, I'm pretty sure that both were down, the ea or the indicator prompted me Does the EA and the indicator use EMA and SMA?

--- 帖子 #18 ---
yes, this is exactly the same, but v3.1 will be with some more features soon

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Shasha, Can you clarify what kind of MA's you are using.. The original method uses Simple MA's . In your Indicator, Geoff's Manual Setup v3, you refer to BOTH SMA's and EMA's.. In the parameters section it list EMA's while in the on chart notes it list SMA's. Just want to clarify so I know which kind to place on chart for visual.. thanks

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hi, I have definitly no trade when a try to backtest this "GEOFFs TOKYO BREAKOUT v3.ex4"... I have no error message... I use other strategies very well but not this one. For exemple the original "Simple_H1_GBPUSD_EA.mq4" works very well. Any ideas? Im the only one in this case?

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Yes, you are the only one, because you spend 5 minutes learning Forex, and got 1 post only.. Better spend few month/years reading this forum before trading with real money, unless you don't care losing all of it. What Ideas dude??? This EA needs manual confirmation for trade to be taken.. You cannot use it in backtesting. Got it?

--- 帖子 #22 ---
hi sasha... i've been lurking on geoff thread from V1.0 till now, and made some post there. i'm glad you made your own thread base on geoff manual. but i have a problem with the script, the script doesn't open any pending order, i've try both "BUY STOP" and "SELL STOP", but both script are doing nothing. there is a message on the journal that tell "2010.07.21 07:33:53 Script PLACE BUYSTOP GBPUSD,H1: removed" i've no idea about that, can you help me solve this problem regard tinorio

--- 帖子 #23 ---
+28 and + 23 on your EA Sasha. Seems to be working great. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
tommy, thanks for pointing out, it will be fixed it in the next release. of course it's smas in calculation but just the name error in in the indicator's pop up menu

--- 帖子 #25 ---
me the same - yesterday put randomly on buystop by 1.53001, after a little downward got triggered at 1.52958 and closed with profit of +22, +17, +10

--- 帖子 #26 ---
well, looks a little bit strange for me because works fine. so you have no errors/other messages in the Experts/Journal tabs?

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Yes it works great when Demo or playing for Pennies, cause who cares if you lose 260 pips on penny account.. For me 140 pips stop loss = No STOP LOSS at all. I'll try set it to something reasonable like 40 pips and see what's up.. I'm thinking maybe we can ADD STOCH to confirm entry? Like Enter buy above 65 and sell below 25... P.S Technically it works great, no errors so far..

--- 帖子 #28 ---
SKY. No pain. No gain.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
SKY. I have had 48 trades this month so far using these systems with only 4 losses.Pretty good odds I would say.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Sasha: I tried it with safer settings during those pre-hours of Tokyo-gmt 23, London-gmt 5 and NY-gmt 13 on fxcm vps using buy or sell stop set at pending 2 (that seems to me just like market order) with my own discretion/judgement to enter. No losers so far, though winning pips are not that spectacular, but good to know that my orders are being managed so well by this EA. I'm a very happy user. Thanks a lot. Richard

--- 帖子 #31 ---
I'm using TP of 22 and 28 on this EA. Good enough for me.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
is your sl 140?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Dry Clean. Yes I am using a 140 stop loss. As GEOFF has said that is the optimum setup. If history has shown only 1 loss in 12 months I trust this stop loss.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
GB, don't get me wrong. My reference of "not spectacular winning pips" are due to my safe settings. Richard

--- 帖子 #35 ---
thanks!

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Interesting.. How come? I use Tokyo from day one and only have few trades and couple of loses.. 3x140 pip loss will wipe out 1-2 month profit and no guarantee, that another one will not come around before that..

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Most of wins have been with the manual system. I have been using this since day 1. Also some trades with my own system which you now have.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
As I said before I trade the manual system from 7am to 12 noon EST which is the London open and New York times

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Tokyo has not traded much but have had only 1 loss so far with it trading the IBFX short candle on a Friday.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
have the ea do market orders

--- 帖子 #41 ---
I like the sell and buy stop orders. Gives me the time to verify the market direction.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
gerry, you trade cable only?

--- 帖子 #43 ---
aha, will do that in next ver very soon

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Mostly Cable. I find I can make enough money trading this pair. I do have a long term trade on the USD/JPY waiting for it to go long.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
tinorio, i think i know what the problem is ... your broker does not allow to place market orders with take profit and stop loss fields filled, in other words, you can just place a "clean" market order, with empty tp and sl and modify that later. IBFX just recently turned the same. is this the same how ECN brokers do? so do i have to add a TypeECN option to the EA to be able to process that?

--- 帖子 #46 ---
SASHA. Mine is working correctly and my broker is IBFX. No problems placing orders.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
no, no, i was talking about market orders with take profit and stop loss - you cannot open it at one time, you have to open an "empty" market order first and later modify its take profit and stop loss fields, as they told me, but for pending orders its as usual

--- 帖子 #48 ---
I don't see any trades today, since morning nothing has been triggered. Will run it for a while on IBFX mini and see how it goes, before do anything serious..

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Sasha, That is correct, with ECN brokers you can not place market orders with tp and sl set.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Hi Sashan, Thanks for starting the new thread. I was not aware of this thread and have been a follower of Geoff's thread since version 1. I got bitten by this yesterday night (Australian time) and lost -140 PIPS. My first trade using this . But i know this works very well. hope to make up the loss.... Regards Velli

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Hi Gerry Which is your system? Is there any thread about this? Can I have it Regards Velli

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Hello SASHASAN I simply wanted to say that I have been trying your EA on GBP/CAD I have had great results. However, I have been "babysitting" the EA. The trading has been on a "full-time" basis rather than just the Tokyo open. After this very short test it is my very humble opinion that market orders should NOT be allowed for the EA without further modification. For example, the last prompt I had was to open a sell stop, which I declined. The correct call would to have been opening a buy stop. This is really irrelevant. But, what is relevant is that an EA should be able to have a proper R:R ratio to survive in the long term (IMHO). This is a fact in manual trading and and I don't see why people think it should be different with an EA. If it is otherwise then they are counting on "luck" to be with them. (good luck). Accordingly, that is the "fatal flaw" in this EA. It will take small profits on a regular basis but will also take rather large losses. In summary; babysit it or don't use it. Kindest Regards, peace, out TR

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Velli. Send me a PM.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Hi all, First of all, I'd like to thank sashasan for this thread and EA. Normally, I don't believe in EAs. I came across to this thread last night and added the files just for fun to a demo account, then, activated the EA at the beginning of Frankfurt open. Well, it's been around 1 hour and the EA did 8 trades, 7 of which all ended up in profit, and one is floating in profit at the moment. Just a bit info about the way I use this EA: I attached it to 16 pairs, set TP to +10 pips and 1 trade per pair. The rest of the settings are at default values. The result seems to be quite impressive. Let's see what will happen until London close... Edit: 8th trade also closed in +10 profit, which made +80 pips for today...

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Ok seems to be safe and efficient, but the correlation between differents pairs risks to do "all good" or "all bad", dont you think?

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Sasha, I just place a buy Stops and I don't see them moving down alone with price, should orders supposed to be trailing down? I mean if Price moving down currently, BUY STOPS should be trailed down (modified by EA) alone with the price, I'm correct on this one? Cause I don't see any movement.. Ohh and STOP LOSS must be modifying as well (Trailing) Whole structure of Orders + Stop loss must move (in case of BUY) down if price start dropping, That's how I see it.. P.S Cable dropping but orders not moving, definitely.. What's "PendingOrderStep" doing? I'll try to set it to 1 so it's trail every pip.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Dude, if you gonna have 140 pips SL and 10 pips T. profit you can click anywhere on the chart and more likely you going to win, and if you will set SL to 1000 pips , then you going to win 99.9% without any system that called Risk:Reward ratio.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Aslo, Sasha, I comeback in the morning and got message box "you want to place Buy Stop blahh blahh", since my MT4 is minimized, I cannot see the screen (open message box won't let me click on MT4) and therefore cannot place the order without look over first.. I click NO, message box pumped up again and again, so I was not able to click on MT4 and was forced to Click YES .. It's on the penny live so, I don't care, but with real money that could hurt, need to make sure, when NO is clicked no more Asking. (No more pop-ups for that particular setup)

--- 帖子 #59 ---
SKY. When I click no I don't get the box again. So far I have clicked no 2 times.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Hi Sashan, I am also having the same problem... until you hit the yes it keeps popping up and not letting you open the MT4 screen. Velli

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Gerry, probably because you was around when pop up happens.. Try to leave it overnight and check in the morning..

--- 帖子 #62 ---
I put the EA at 2 different timezones, and many times when Geoff's EA did not take any trade, the one with 1 hour early took TPs. For example today also.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
I will watch it SKY.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Sky, here is the deal. PendingOrderStep is a distance between current Bid/Ask and pending order open price, so if you have cable now at 1.52650 with 20 pips step your BUYSTOP order will be placed at the price of 1.52850 (since all the values in ea settings are by 4 digits broker, i think i forgot to mention that), and by 1.52450 for SELLSTOP. regarding trailings - EA will have to wait 3 more candles from now to move it because it works with already formed high/low prices of previous candle. lets say you opened a BUYSTOP order now (13:45 by GMT) by 1.52850, during next hour (14 GMT) ea cannot move the order because if it will calculate high of this candle + PendingOrderStep, it could be even higher then the opened, so it passes this candle. by the next candle, 15 by GMT, it compares last high + PendingOrderStep with the order open price and if it's lower then order price, it will move it, but if market goes to long direction, of course will not. and so on. until order will stay pending, at the opening of any new candle ea will check high of previous candle + PendingOrderStep and if it's lower then order's price, it will move it down.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
ok guys, here is a new version, 3.3 things added : -- show/hide alert window -- set up broker as ECN -- ability to place pending/market orders -- fixed sma's name in the indicator

--- 帖子 #66 ---
btw +32 pips last night

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Sashasan, first of all, thanks for this variation. I see some folks expanding the pairs they are trading beyond GBPUSD and doing OK. Are you sticking with the single pair? And it looks as though you are limiting trading hours... I think I will start in a demo so I can understand how to use the components. Wayne

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Thanks a lot sashasan ! If I dont mistake, now the EA v 3.3 is completly automated because orders are placed automaticaly. No need to stay front of the computer for trade activly. Is it correct?

--- 帖子 #69 ---
yes, it's still on cable but of course i am looking for some more ...

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Sasha, my Idea was no matter what, if I enter "Buy stop" 20 pips above (LONG for example) since we Have BUY (LONG) signal Already, just trail all of them (BUY STOP and SL) while price going down within specified (20 pips for example) distance above the current price, trail only one way of course (EVERY PIP / STEP 1) ones price action reverse Buy Stop gets executed.. This is really important. Ones we got a signal, just trail right awat.. Idea is to grab that BUY as low as possible (after Signal gets generated), no need to wait 3 hours.. IMHO.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
interesting idea only one question - is it possible to combine this technique with existing algorithm or it should be a new one, so i would have to completely change it in the ea

--- 帖子 #72 ---
technically, it looks like a scalping method inside 1 hour bar, correct ?

--- 帖子 #73 ---
WE need SMA and Fractals ONLY because we want to get a SIGNAL based on strategy, After which, in 70% cases, price going down (against us) and then up again, so my Idea is to grab that deep as soon as it gets reversed from the bottom.. This way all structure (STop orders and Stop loss) moves lower to get quicker pips, instead of waiting till it gets all the way back up there again Or Orders can be potentially Canceled. if price never retrace back within specified range (say 100 pips) Just an example: Trail down (Buy Stops/Stop Loss/ modify them every pip) within 20 pips (BUY stop example), if no retrace within 100 pips (pair keep dropping) orders closed (No Trade), wait for another signal.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
so it will create an entry at any bar open after smas and fractals in consolidation or just once? i will do that, no prob, as another way to calculate the entry, but do i need to keep the current one in the ea?

--- 帖子 #75 ---
You got it! We only Need to make sure we got Signal ones, Place Stop Buy and it will triggers whenever on any bar any time when price reverses 20 pips, Or if never reverses withing 100 pips (pair keeps dropping example) then cancel all pending orders, wait for another Signal.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
the only one concern i see for right now - if market will move very fast, orders will be modified with different price

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Hi all, With the V3.3 why the MT4 backtest do no trades? (optionnal pop up turned FALSE)

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Sky, can you check the new version, in mine looks like ok (scripts are also updated)

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Im testing V3.4 on many pairs, will see.. I seen already (maybe it's normal) that only first of the 2 or 3 orders that are pending are modified by the trailling type FAST option. Also a newbie question: No matter on the EA which M5, M15 or H1 your are in. That's right?

--- 帖子 #80 ---
well i tested it in real mode (demo account), 3 pending orders always moved at the same time yes, time frame does not matter, because indicator calculates values based on H1, M15 and M5

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Are you testing with OpenOrders option at 2 or 3 ? Im with value "2" and only 1 order follows the inverse movement...

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Surely... will upload and test now, thank you..

--- 帖子 #83 ---
i used 3 (Byu and Sell) and all of them moved at the same time

--- 帖子 #84 ---
just tried with 2 BUYSTOP orders - placed by 1.52763 and moved couple of times down to 1.52753, both

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Sashasan, Thanks for ur Great EA. Where i can get last version V 3.4 or 3.3 ? in first post i just see V3.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Look at very bottom of first post, last attachment is v3.4

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Tommyd u means this GEOFF's Manual Setup v3.ex4 is V3.4 ?

--- 帖子 #88 ---
no it's http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/attach/ex4.gif GEOFFs TOKYO BREAKOUT v3.4.ex4 (32.0 KB, 17 views)

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Thanks Sashasan..

--- 帖子 #90 ---
I'm not liking this change to a 5 digit system on IBFX. Saw a + 47 pip gain and got all excited. Cashed out, and realized it was only 4.7 pips. Bummer.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
My test...

--- 帖子 #92 ---
EA just took 3 Buy Stops and it's moving alone with the price, just what I want it.. Let's see.. Now we not going to just sit and watch hopeless how pair moving against us, eating our pips.. Thank you Sasha, looking good Only question I have.. I see 1 order is apart from other 2 by about 17 pips, what parameter is responsible for this spread? Looks like TrailingStop3?

--- 帖子 #93 ---
ok guys, here is another idea - yesterday night (around 23:00 GMT) i placed 2 pending orders with distance of 30 pips and made the following settings : take profit 1 = 17 take profit 2 = 150 stop loss = 140 trailing stop = 50 b/e = 0 the idea behind this is to "unleash" 2nd order and try him to catch a big profit since we have a huge stop loss. so now we have : 1st order closed with +17 pips 2nd order closed with +97 pips btw, take profit 2 was not set on purpose (just any number out of my head), so if cable would go up on 2 pips more, order 2 would close with take profit +150

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Now it the perfect example.. Why buy Top and watch, how pig flying down without parachute? Just grab it lower when she decide to reverse, that's what EA is doing right now, trailing orders down alone with PA.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Good Idea but traling stop =50 looks too big what if Trade revese at 45 pips? then it would have no stop at all and can drop to Stop Loss I'm thinking traling stop =25 should be enough.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
sky no, i think that's i was talking about yesterday - if market goes very fast (one tick is less then a second and a whole cycle of modifying 3 orders does not fit into this milliseconds period of time), prices of those orders will be different, if i understood correct

--- 帖子 #97 ---
may be for this Geoff used 3 orders - 2 order had a small trailing and 3rd a big one?

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Im not totally agree with spirit of this last v3.4: if price reverse 10 pips or more, its maybe just because the scenario is invalided. Dont you think?

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Yes, for example like if TP1 25 pips 1st get hit and second TP2 35 hit than you can set 3 rd Order Stop Loss just above break even and trail alone with Order #3

--- 帖子 #100 ---
#1 If you don't agree then set TrailOrder2/3 to False #2 Look Cable now, if we don't have Buy Stop/Sell stop you will be in hole for about 50 pips by now with regular Tokyo EA.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
In this case that's true, it worked well. I just want to say that the signal can be outdated if the movement take to long time to be validated or reverse too much. Its why I set the ReverseMove at 10~20 pips.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
I'm not sure what ReverseMove doing exactly, have to ask Sasha to make sure...

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Sky, Do you have all default settings or have you changed some? And if so, what have you changed? Thank you. s

--- 帖子 #104 ---
I'm testing so.. TP 22-25-28 trailing stop 2 = 14 Trailing stop 3 =17 Basically I don't need them (TSL) since my TP are too low to trail.. And that's about it..

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Thank you. All the other settings are the same?

--- 帖子 #106 ---
See first page: It's the distance we accept to do (during what pending order is modified pip by pip) in reverse direction; after what the order is just deleted.

i see what you are talking about - this value should be (- spread), so when tried to set it less then 40, it was always closed right away (on the next tick), so i will fix it in a new version

--- 帖子 #108 ---
actually no, everything works fine, it's could be a useful feature added to show a minimal allowed ReverseMode (because market price could go far away already) to avoid orders to be closed right away will do it in next version

--- 帖子 #109 ---
That's what I mention yesterday. Trail STOP orders ONLY until ReverseMode =100 (for example) 100 pips if no Reverse and no orders triggered by then. Close all pending STOP orders and wait for next setup.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Please, let me understand this right. I have just put it on the chart this afternoon. 2 orders are placed. one opens and the price drops 80p and the order is supposed to trail? and stay within how many p's of the price? Mine didn't. The price is just now up where the second order was placed and still hasn't kicked in. Where have I missed it? Thank you. s

--- 帖子 #111 ---
ok, so is ea doing something different?

--- 帖子 #112 ---
sandra, make sure you have : -- PLaceMarketOrders = false -- FastTrailing = true -- MovePendingOrder = true and see what happens

--- 帖子 #113 ---
No, but I have a bunch of old ticks in the journal. I know you guys, you and Sky, are genius' so please bear with me. Thanks. s

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Got it. Nothing but the price is just there now so it won't.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
So it had dropped 68 p's. Should it have trailed? I think so.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
can you place a screenshot? or copy journal's messages regarding those orders

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Price didn't hit the order and is dropping so we'll see if it trails now.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #119 ---
so looks like one of the order is already triggered and become a market and the other is still pending ? now you could get those results? i mean distance between orders are very big, did you use a script to place orders?

--- 帖子 #120 ---
I placed them from the pop up. One was filled quick, the other sat while price went down 68p's or so and then came back. I expected to see the order trail the price but didn't. Is that what it's supposed to do?

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Maybe I'm wrong. I thought that when price moved down , the pending orders moved down also. And then when price moved back up, it didn't have so far to go to get filled. But I don't see where this one moved down. Should it have done that?

--- 帖子 #122 ---
yes, you describe exactly how it should be and how it's actually works, but i dont understand why your 2 orders were not opened at the same time? for example, i just clicked at GBPCHF chart couple minutes ago and got ENTER TRADE NOW notification from the indi, clicked OK in pop up message and got filled 3 buy stop orders. later on, they were moved down a couple of times, here is the pic : Attached Image open price was 1.62425, now is 1.62248 blue line is a ReverseMove level which is 50 pips, but it did not go that far and reversed and my orders became market

Sacha, like a already said, for me there is only one order that is modified for follow the reverse(that not work like you): Maybe you changed the copy of V3.4 since your first upload?

--- 帖子 #125 ---
no, it the same v3.4 version. are your results from backtest or from live trading? also, i dont understand why one order in your chart is market and other is pending the general rule, which EA will check, is if both 2 or 3 orders are pending and if market goes retraced, it trails it but why you have them in distance of 25 pips from each other ??? i am very confused ... they should be opened by the same price or at least in 1-2 pips distance between each other

--- 帖子 #126 ---
I set up for 2 orders.My orders were not placed for the same price. That's how one got filled and one not. And the one not filled did not trail. This was my first attempt with this. So I will know what to look for in the future. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Live trading. I have added a screenshot, you can see the EA that modifie only one of the two orders...

--- 帖子 #128 ---
That's the same thing I did but mine were placed at different prices. One at 1.54223 and one at 1.54323. From the same pop up window.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Backtest doesnt work for me.... no trade executed... i dont know why...?

--- 帖子 #130 ---
and you say you had a pause between opening them in couple minutes?? even thou you did not get a new pop up message?

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Of course, its normal, its because there is only one order that is modified for follow the reverse. Its a little bug in the VERY GOOD EA

--- 帖子 #132 ---
what the broker do you use? and can you describe exactly how that happened? i mean step by step

--- 帖子 #133 ---
AVAFX with MT4, all other EA work well. I have no error but no trade at all... (of course AUTOMATIC mode is TRUE)

--- 帖子 #134 ---
No pause. They opened at the same time, but different prices.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Sasha look at my screenshot.. Order number 1 is closer and orders 2-3 are about 17 pips apart.. I want all of them be closer together No reason to have that big gap between them, losing pips that way, which property responsible for that Gap??? Why orders are not all together? Thanks

--- 帖子 #136 ---
just recently opened three orders in GBPUSD by 1.54401

--- 帖子 #137 ---

who is your broker?

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Sasha, you can try to reupload, we will test again.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
That's what happened to me also. Mine is Alpari UK.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
let me try on Alpari first

--- 帖子 #143 ---
I dont use ALPARI, Im on AVAFX, i think its not an operator problem... Maybe ECN option can be responsable to this bug? I use ECN=true

--- 帖子 #144 ---
I have ECN set to false.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Ah.. that's not the responsable

--- 帖子 #146 ---
I think finally that the timeframe inside where the EA is placed in modifies the signal indicator, look at these 2 screenshots at the same time, in M15 and other in H1...

--- 帖子 #147 ---
IBFX (I use ECN=true)

exactly the same as previous ones btw, Alpari on my machine works MUCH slower then IBFX

--- 帖子 #150 ---
For you Sasha it's working well. But not for us... strange... try to reupload maybe...?

--- 帖子 #151 ---
indicator writes a code value into global variable and ea will read the value from this variable and based on this opens or does not open trade so it does not really matter on which timeframe ea is because its does not calculate the entry

--- 帖子 #152 ---
just reuploaded v3.4

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Indicator says a different value to the EA if indicator is in M15 or if it is in H1, so it changes the Signal of the EA.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Thanks! Will try that.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
can you prove this for me? i dont think you really understood what i explained in my previous post i mean dont you see that clicking at different time frame the values of simple moving averages and fractals do not change???

--- 帖子 #156 ---
You can try yourself or see my two screenshots. I switched M15 and H1 and the indicator said PLACE ORDER NOW on M15 and ORDER EXPECTED on H1.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
just closed everything manually. Trading will stop on IBFX at 4PM EST There will be another week. Thanks, Sasha, looking good..

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Thanks Sasha and Sky great work on this. Have a good weekend!!!

--- 帖子 #159 ---
why i have this in this case :nerd: ? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Thanks so much for all you do. You're a prize. See you next week. s

--- 帖子 #161 ---
You too guys, thanks everyone for testing... Have a good weekend

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Of course, we can found some case where indicator says the same order on different timeframe, but in some other cases you can found at the same time the indicator saying you a different order. (like I show you in my previous screenshots and I show you again in this new screenshot). It's why I say the indicator order depending of the timeframe too. The screenshot is showing that: In H1 the EA will place orders but in M15 the EA will not.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
it operates thru global variables so it wont work. if you need to test it, take original Geoff's ea and remove hour limitation from it

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Which broker that you use? I, for one, do not have this problem with fxcm live vps nor with demo. All values and comments are in-sync on different TFs.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
hi guys, for all of you who had problems with opening orders by different price here is a test script which opens buy stop orders, please try it and get back with the results - now it must place orders correctly. btw, i found and fixed one hidden bug. ea and indi loaded on the chart are required to place trades, as before.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
sa Sasha, you sure there wouldn't be a conflict in name convention? I mean, if previous script and new one in the me directory, how come EA will pick new one for execution? I think we should delete old one and rename new to PLACE BUY.ex4.. By the way I'm not sure why MT4 programmers still naming files with blank space, - this is just a bad practice overall.. I'd never leave empty space in File name. Example: PLACE BUY.ex4 (bad practice) PLACE_BUY.ex4. (OK) I'm sure you know that... This is a 1st grade programming rules? Case many times when people will download something like PLACE BUY.ex4 - they will get PLACE%20BUY.ex4 (cause Empty space translates to %20 in HTML encoding) and that's invalid file name..

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Sky, it's ok, i will change it, for right now i just need to know does this version do place orders correct. it must open orders by the the same time and price (a little correlation in price is allowed but only if market moves very fast. so now it should work ok)

--- 帖子 #168 ---
actualy, ea does not use scripts to place trades, it has exactly the same built in function to do it, so scripts are used only to place trades manually

--- 帖子 #169 ---
3 buy stops allowed on GBP/CAD We will see where it leads

--- 帖子 #170 ---
3 trades taken on friday that closed out just now with 32.9 pips on IBFX. Looking forward to more. Thanks S!

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Sashasan, If I wanted to place 3 trades at TP 22, TP 24 and TP 26 would I need to change any other settings other than those 3? Thanks for your work! Russ

--- 帖子 #172 ---
TradeRunner, i assume that all of them are on green dotted-pointed line? so same price and same time?

--- 帖子 #173 ---
yes, just the take profits values the rest of it depends what king of trailing and order type you wanna use (Market orders and "fast" or "slow" trailing)

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Yes... but looking at hourly chart the trade could go either way, I will likely sell below the daily pivot and the current S/L will make an excellent profit target

--- 帖子 #175 ---
1H chart

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Good morning, sasha, Yes, it worked. Thank you. I placed the trades manually though using the test.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Ohh, ok then.. I though EA calling those scripts..

--- 帖子 #178 ---
METAQOUTES

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Thank you!

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Sasha, I have a problem with this Manual EA.. When I click OK button on popup, 2 buy stop placed instead of 3 ( I use 3 order version), then all of the sudden 3rd order placed like 20 pips below almost 1 hour later (pair dropped down) and Top 2 orders dos not Trailing down (pair drop 40 pips already), but sitting at exact same place where they was placed originally, something messy going on (same picture as I show earlier)

--- 帖子 #181 ---
well, let me change the whole set the same as i did in my test script because looks like it works. after that will see. did you have any problems with orders in the versions earlier then 3.4 correct? also, for me it's really difficult to tell something because you have a settings message hidden (how did you do that?)

--- 帖子 #182 ---
It says "Access is denied".

--- 帖子 #183 ---
is it about what?

--- 帖子 #184 ---
In the other thread regarding Geoff's EA there was once a mention of this but I can't re-locate it. WHat changes are made when changing 'True' to 'False' with a non ECN broker?

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Message is blinking and when it hidden, for split second, I push button to safe the Image I though that without those messages just better to see the actual chart

--- 帖子 #186 ---
here it is I just make screenshot with the messages:

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Here those actual orders: see how 2 buy stops are still there and one get triggered 1 hour later for whatever reason:

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Sky, you did not set up new magics, so ea does not know "who is who" (as you understand with all the magics = 0 it will create a great mess) so because of that you have 3 orders in the message with the same ticket # - look at this i really do not know what ea will do in this case

--- 帖子 #189 ---
new version uploaded, nothing new a couple of small changes in the indi changed a placing orders algorithm back to previous code but looks like its not needed

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Sasha, unfortunately all Magics numbers 1/2/3 are set to different 9-digit numbers so, problem must be somewhere else.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Sasha I just load v3.5 and got error message: " Indicator &lt;Geoffs Manual Setup v3&gt; is not loaded on chart no data for EA is available... " Looks like new version of EA still looking for that Old version v3 Indicator?! I think you forgot to change reference...

--- 帖子 #192 ---
if you have set it up to 9 digits they will be shown in the Message in front of Magic1 # : etc you have to attach ea to the chart (F7), in the pop up choose Yes, again F7 and type in any 3 random numbers, after this you will see them in the message even if you have no orders opened what you did - you just clicked Yes on the first message and did not change it (as well as many of other members who had problems with different prices and time while orders opening), in this case all the magics variables = 0 and ea will not be able to identify orders! so you will see 0's in front of each Magic # : field as you have in your screenshot

--- 帖子 #193 ---
yes, forgot, i changed it only only in one place

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Sashasan, has anyone inquired about an audio alert for when the Buy/Sell pop-up appears?

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Ok, please let us know, when you upload fixed version, thank you.. I will check magic numbers stuff to make sure ..

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Yeah, I inquired for e-beer, anytime Buy/Sell event generated

--- 帖子 #197 ---
just reuploaded, it's same v3.5

--- 帖子 #198 ---
A refrigerator next to your computer would work. But you would have to open the door, close the door.... E-beer wins.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
I see now that my Magic # are ZERO.. I attached EA, load Preset And say OK.. And magic showed up 0, but now I type my own magics and it's sets OK, they are showed up now.. Should be fine from now on.. Will keep you posted.. Looking good, thank you, Sasha

--- 帖子 #200 ---
yeah :nerd: i think floflo and sanda had the same problems, so i probably will make the ea to interrupt all works if magics are = 0

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Dear Shasha and all, I'd follow your EA since day 1, but then i get stuck here when you upload new EA. do i have to change the file name without the (parentheses) e.g PLACE BUY v3.5 (Script) to PLACE BUY v3.5? anyway thank you for the EA.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
EA just took 3 Buys.. Man, looks good.. All stuff working, trailing as designed..

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Do we need to download everything again or just the indi or just the EA?

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Sasha. So far this month 63 trades with only 4 losses. Only 1 loss on GBP/USD. Most of them using a variety of your manual systems. Thanks for a great system. Not having many trades so far on GEOFF,s EA.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Hi Sky. This is my London session with Geoffs V3,4 today. FxPro -demo. GU 3 x 1.55114 EU 3 x 130.139 EJ 3 x 113.180 GJ 3 x 134.919 EG 3 x 0.83916 GCH 3 x 1.62829 already ended with 6 x TP1, 3 x TP2, 9 x TSL. All positive with out any problems, works perfectly. Alert window required "broker" label and "currency" label. Tomorrow will try Geoffs V3,5 Great thanks to sashasan and you. Regards Mac

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Well done Gerry andlot of thanks to Sasha and Geoff. Veill

--- 帖子 #207 ---
What I do after Sasha's EA places 2 or 3 trades I check my own system and if I like what I see I will jump in with a trade while waiting for the pending orders to be filled. I pretty much know where the market is going thanks to Sasha and why waste a little profit.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
My take profit on the trade is the same as the entry order on the EA so when the pending is triggered my manual trade is closed for a small 20 pip profit. By the way I am using TP of 22 26 28.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Mac thank you, I have 1 Trade last night and it reach TP Then come to the PC in the morning and got message for 3 Stop Buy, hit OK hit TP later (Win), and now Trailing down Cable again which probably going to rebound back to highs later on.. P.S I got 22-25-28 TP, for quick hit and run

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Sasha. Is there anyway that when the pop up kicks in that the name of the pair could be displayed in it? ps Great work being done here

--- 帖子 #211 ---
yes, no problem, will do that in the next version. also, just recently discovered that ReverseMove value cannot be calculated correct if the whole set is loaded on more then one pair at a time. so please let me some time to figure out how to resolve it. it's not a bug, it will happen if you have chosen "FastTrailing" option and in the worse case (if the whole v3.5 set will be ran on 2 or more pairs at the same time) trailing drop (for BUYSTOP or up for reverse) will be moved more then 100 pips as it in the pop up.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Mac, great! Currency name will be added, as i just said, but what do you mean about broker? something like "Pair GBPUSD triggered a buy signal on IBFX?" as a first line on the pop up message before placing trades?

--- 帖子 #213 ---
btw, is it all the automatic trades or with manual confirmation?

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Sasha, Auto Mode is when ShowAlert set to false, Right? What is PlaceMarketOrders? Means buy without Buy/Sell Stops and trailing I think, right? Like regular Tokyo..

--- 帖子 #215 ---
yes correct. PlaceMarketOrders means that the orders would be placed are market ones, not pending, by market price in the time when indi produces a signal (so it's the same as in the original Geoff's EA), and all the stuff with fast/slow trailing will be unused

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Yeap, trailing stuff working perfect... Little more testing and I'm going to move this to more serious account P.S. about 15 pips below TP, lets see

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Isengoz, let us know how things are going trading 16 pairs.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Shasasan ur Ea very Great, today i place it to 10 pairs n get &gt;+500 pips now still have a couple floating..

--- 帖子 #219 ---
can you describe a little bit more about it? what time, take profits etc?

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Hi Sasha. Very sorry for my late respond. It's definitely EA algo hard work, snapshot available for you . The same I've got yesterday and Friday. The idea is that, as I've motion to Sky in the past, I always tested EA's with few brokers at the same time say : FxPro, Alpari, FXCM , SIG ect. I try to compare strength of signal, time of it and price. When I've got alert windows where on each broker I keep open minimum six pair, I can not recognise at first look which window refer to which broker and pair of currency. As you probably know my live acc, is Oanda and Alpari, so I convert manually signal from Mt4 Fxpro -demo to Oanda where MT4 isn't available at all and compare with Alpari at the same time. If you can fix this for me Sasha it will be extremely helpful . Regards Mac

--- 帖子 #222 ---
ok, so you started all of them today at the London open right? also, do you use different take profits for them correct? if so, what the rule did you follow to? and who is your broker? thanks p.s. i still have no your email

--- 帖子 #223 ---
sorry sasha It's my snapshot Mac.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
ok, not a problem, will do that, does Oanda have any built in language as MQL?

--- 帖子 #225 ---
great, here is the same question - do you use different takeprofits (since it's not shown in pips) for all the pairs or the same? also, looks like you do not use any type of trailings correct (Fast/Slow)?

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Sasha First of all the EA is V3,4 and I use my manual MagicNum management which means there is always correct magic number referred to each broker and each pair 3 x orders. There is specific TP1, TP2, TP3 to each pair after CamV5 optimisation (say GU 19, 28, 48 respectively). There is specific TS2, TS3 to each pair (say GU 20; 30; respectively) . There is ECN true, Fast Trailing true and RevM = 100 for all. I also asked you in the past how works Order2BeLevel which I think is delay for TSL3 in Tokio EA, but I'm not sure. The fast trailing works just fantastic. I'm very grateful to all off you for this hard but brilliant work . Regards Mac

--- 帖子 #227 ---
With Oanda you can use every kind of EA (you got your say personal AIP ) in java language. However there are some restrictions and fee. Regards Mac.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
oh, i am sorry if i missed your question, Order2BeLevel and Order3BeLevel is an amount of pips (from order open price to the positive side) which will be applied to the 2nd and 3rd order after 1st order will be closed by take profit. so default values are : 0 for order 2 (means it will lock 0 pips in profit after 1st order closed) and 10 pips for order 3.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Mac, so do you use it mostly on London open correct?

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Since last Thursday I have just completed 5 positive trades in a row! They were all GBP/USD at IBFX. All were auto and took 3 TP's each time. The last 3 trades made 72 pips each. Great results! Thanks Sashasan!!

--- 帖子 #231 ---
All default Sasha, well i forgot when i activate it.. lol maybe at london time... Alpari Broker.. maybe u can check ur spam email...

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Guys, don't forget, originally this method only worked on GBPUSD. I don't see the reason to trade it on gazillion pairs, if EA 3 times hit TP today with approx 75 pips each.. Even 1 hit like this, will do the job.. heck gimme 50 pips a day, I'll take it... More greed generates greater exposure to higher risk... Whenever I backtest Original Tokyo EA on pairs other than Cable, it turn out to be very poor or 50/50 results, but, hey, since this new trailing capability, it might don't need fractals at all..

--- 帖子 #233 ---
so you see you finally admit it :nerd: fractals

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Yeap, but we need something for trigger, when to enter those Buy/Sell stops and start trailing.. Some Event/Trigger.. I'll think about it.. Those SMA's already filter most part, so we only need trigger..

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Dear Sasha. Main idea is to run EA's around the clock, but there are many factors to be sort out first. BTW I've got open the alert window right now and there isn't any informations related to the broker or currency pair at all. To continue ; #1 There isn't work the automatic option (EA V3,4 ). #2 We need chose correct broker referred to the market (night spread) #3 We need chose correct set of currency pairs referred to the market we are interested in. Yes, my main session is London but also Frankfurt, Tokyo , Sydney, Hong Kong and NY after 4pm only. Regards Mac.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Skyz, u right, but before i have do some little backtest for Usd-Jpy n found that a little setting change can optimize the profit, if not wrong before i change the gmt start time for usd-jpy (i forgot maybe 15 ?) and sma 197 n 10 to different value, but my note n backtest was gone because before my mt4 crash n many lost history data or gap on history data. next time when i have free time i will find that preset again... also when i search better sma n start gmt i found that 1 value can big impact for result Example. when we change sma 197 to 196 can give different result or start time. Ps : if someone can make program to optimized every pair will be more easy only for start time start from 1 - 24 , n sma 1 with 1 untill 250 with 50 n more., program get the data from export history data mt4...(only little newbie idea.. lol)

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Yeap on Tokyo original I used 202/10 that gime me option to decrease SL to 130 and still run 1 year backtest without single loss for 1 year I add EURUSD, for tonight... let's see what comes up.. By the way: looks like Dollar gonna be dumped big soon.. Cable already pushing 1.56... EURCHF... flying...

--- 帖子 #238 ---
no Sasha. best signal is for GU on Tokyo night that is simply true. but the same signal ( from fractals ) works perfectly with other pairs on TP1 after modifications OpenPending because the force of the signal, became strong enough for say 22pips. That is my point of view or I'm wrong. Mac.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Is that 4pm London?

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Hi mary4x Yes, correct. Mac

--- 帖子 #241 ---
ok, guys, just uploaded a new version with all the names in pop up message and preventing of further trades if magics are equal to 0

--- 帖子 #242 ---
tangianto, you can take any original version of the Geoff's ea and just remove hour set up from it and test, but believe me, a lot of people from the primary thread already tried to optimize it and none of them had stable positive results on any other pair then cable, but a lot of loss on top of this, you cannot optimize this ea because it's a big architectonic set which coordinates thru global variables and tester would not be able to interpret those signals on history

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Yes, 2-5-10 days period it might work on any pair.. But in the long run, this method /SO FAR/ works only for Cable. I'm expecting quiet night.. Cable/EU too high to quick, unless it settles down 50-100 pips, don't expect too much going on.. Maybe even hit Stop Sell and trail, cause nothing goes 1 direction all the time Will test new version tomorrow, thanks Sasha.. P.S. Ideal setup: lets have Trigger before 23 GMT then pull back (trail) 50 pips and shoot back up - easy money..

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Sasha.. I just setup EA for EU pair as well for test insert different Magic Numbers, of course. Now, Cable gets executed because Indicator did triggered ("Enter trade now" message) , but on EU Indicator showing "No Trades Expected" but 3 trades triggered anyways.. Theoretically, should EA run on several charts with different Pairs at the same time? I'll leave it like this, cause I like my chances.. Let's play

--- 帖子 #245 ---
wait wait you have 3 trades triggered on GBPUSD or EURUSD? it should and you can use the same magics actually (because Symbol() will be different), but as i said before, calculation of RevereMove point might be different and incorrect (could go further then 100 pips), but the rest of it should work the same as usual

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Alex. How come I cannot get rid of the order box if I say no to trade until take trade now is gone?

--- 帖子 #247 ---
gerry, good question. i still have no idea what to do with this - one of the possible variants is to wait some period of time, but in this case you can miss the next entry. so any ideas are welcome ...

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Just loaded your TS yesterday. Automatic mode. I am using a FastFX demo account. 6 trades, all but one winners. The one that has no profit closed at 0x0. Very nice work!

Sasha, I just opened a EU chart and put the indi on the chart. Immediately the pop up came up for EU and placed two prders for GBPUSD. And the Pound wasn't ready for it.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Hi again... I have opened the charts now and it is not as I expected. I had no problems yesterday running EA 3.5, and loaded 3.7 at night. The EURUSD chart indicates 3 orders with 2 profits and 1 BE close. But, the BE closed order seems to be indicated as "active" at the EA lable as shown by the yellow box. All sets are default except to the automatic mode. Is it right? Regards Doc

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Dear Sashasan and all, I've been using automatic mode since i downloaded the EA ver. 3.4 and give good result. and now i am using EA ver 3.5 and on automatic mode. i loaded the EA on GU, GY, EJ using InstaForex, and GU on IBFX.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
how did you get it?

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Great work Sasha and all - I have been trying to keep up. I have a quick question on the "DELETE PENDING" script. Was this script designed to work independent of the EA? Specifically, I am currently looking at pending orders and I simply do not like where entry would be in relationship to the current price action. I would like to cancel those orders and get a more favorable fill on the Buy Stop should conditions permit. Do I go through the individual orders and just manually delete them? I think this will work but was unsure if it would affect the EA. I tried dragging and dropping the script and get an error message "No orders opened with EA Script execution terminated". Any ideas?

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Nice question, but unfortunately I have no answer for that... Maybe a bug... (on the trader ) I will open another account and reload the charts and indicators and EA. The only thing I can think now is that I loaded the charts with the market running, not at the opening.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
to run it you have to have ea and indi loaded on chart first because all the scripts get magic #'s from global variables and to set up those variables you need ea and indi to be ran

--- 帖子 #262 ---
it's hard for me to say something because i never got this

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Sure, don´t worry... As I said I will reload it today and follow the orders... I had other robots running before in this account, and maybe some mess with the history data!! Anyway, very nice work!!

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Sasha, I've only just across this thread and I have saved the EA. I am having trouble saving the scripts and the indi from post 1 in this thread. Can you help?

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Yes - I am there... I am testing v3.5 on an IBFX demo acct and have had it running on the same GBPJPY chart for about 36 hours now. One set of orders have already opened and closed profitably in that time. I altered the magic numbers for orders 1,2, and 3 when I placed the EA on the chart. I have the EA running on 3 different pairs with different magic numbers on each. Did I miss something? T...

--- 帖子 #266 ---
72 trades so far this month with only 4 losses. Unbelievable. Thanks to GEOFF and Alex. I have trading for almost 3 years and never have I had so much success.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
in tester?

--- 帖子 #268 ---
2 more winners by closing out 2 of the 3 trades manually for + 18 + 18. Letting the last one go to 28. Can't be greedy in this business.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
used system for 1st time today...got 32 pips closed...one trade still open at + 24. thanks sashan hey sandra...i'm back for a while

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Last trade just hit my profit target + 28

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Great! sound fantastic What pairs are you playing or just GU also are you using default TP's SL's with the buy/sell stops or market orders Thanks

--- 帖子 #272 ---
sandra, i know what you are talking about - if you have ea and indi loaded on chart and if you changed a time period or a pair, indicator calculates entry point first based on the tick data which is available for this chart (since last close of that chart) and only after downloads a new tick data, so if you have have a chart with entry signal on, closed that chart and later on return back to this, you will have pop up message come up first and after indicator adds a new tick data and recalculates it, but if you have chosen AUTOMATIC MODE, it will place a trade even if later, after a second, indicator will show something else. here is nothing we can do, just use carefully.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Gerry, can u tell me what is your set up for the EA? which currency pair do you use?

--- 帖子 #274 ---
DRYCLEAN. I only trade the cable now. My TP are 22 26 28 with a stop loss of 140. Last trade I manually took profit at + 18 on 2 trades and left the last one to hit + 28.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Buy and sell stops as I like to make sure the trade is going in the right direction and if not I can delete. Just my style of trading.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Trying to make enough money to buy a newCorvette just to aggravate off my wife who thinks I am gambling.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
well, so far i just use automatic mode with setting TP almost the same. still, i am learning to make right BUY and SELL in the right direction.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
KYERILL. All it takes is a little practice.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Cable did hit Target overnight, but EU still holding loss, as for some unknowing reason ones Cable trade get triggered, it's automatically triggers trades on EU, but when I check Indicator on EU no Entry point was expected.. Still not sure how that happens I'd only run in on Cable from now on, there is enough pips could be made on 1 pair, why bother with other pairs?

--- 帖子 #280 ---
thanx gerry... always learning everyday new things. but the more i learn, the more complicated it become.. the first time i learn forex, it sound simple and i want to make it simple but the most important is Money Management...

--- 帖子 #281 ---
SKY. My feelings exactly. I'd only run in on Cable from now on, there is enough pips could be made on 1 pair, why bother with other pairs?

--- 帖子 #282 ---
OMG... Other closed but not closed order...

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Jacob, It brings a smile! I'm so glad to see you. I hope you like this. It is great! And it keeps getting better with every day.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Nice! but look into the Audi R8 Like Scooby(forum member) bought with his wins Been on demo for the last week going well even better now will go live next week How many other Live? I'll start saving up to take a trip to Punta Cana hell at this rate I might be able to upgrade my room! LOL

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Thanks, Alex, for the explanation. I think I'm only going to trade GBPUSD. For awhile anyway. That will keep me busy and out of trouble. Thanks again. s Thankfully, I don't have it set to automatic. I do the pending trades and I was able to delete them. I'm so glad to know this! Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
I'm trading this live also. Started the first of this week. No loses yet. s

--- 帖子 #287 ---
And looks like vise versa happening, Cable showing "Enter trade NOW!" EA taking no trades as on EU screens trades still running.. Will run only 1 version on Cable, that's it.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
DRY CLEAN. I'm an old street rodder so I like the sound of a v8. I have had numerous Audi's and a Porsche Turbo but the sound of a V8 is music to my ears. Sorry Alex to be off topic.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Gerry, Did you get my pm?

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Yes. For info only?????????? Everybody trades differently.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
will check it later ... i placed three sets of orders tonight - on GBPUSD, USDJPY and USDCAD nothing wrong actually...

--- 帖子 #292 ---
I know I had a 65 mustang 427 and a 68 gto 442 in my younger days kids today don't know what they are missing

--- 帖子 #293 ---
How long have you guys and gals been leaving the pending orders going should there maybe be an expire date/time to the orders in the ea

--- 帖子 #294 ---
I'm trading this live also. Started the first of this week. No loses yet. s I'm guessing default for everything alpari???

--- 帖子 #295 ---
AlpariUk with 22,26,28 TP. But I have another set I'm trying now and when it works, I'll let you know. If it does, it will cut the risk to 1/3. s

--- 帖子 #296 ---
did you change tp2 and tp3 from default

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Sandra reducing your stop loss to 50 will not get you more profit. Look at me with 72 trades this month under my belt. I trust this system and trust Geoff When he said the 140 SL was the best optimized result.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Ok, but I use Automatic ,Alert to false.. On Cable today I saw several times: ENTER TRADES NOW! And orders never triggered. I'll probably just exit EU at loss now and see how it goes later.. EU not too good.. Will try on USDJPY P.S Just closed EU trades, restart MT4 and Cable executes immediately, trailing now.. And I just place EA USDJPY and 3 orders BUY Stop fired right away, while Indicator showing NO TRADES EXPECTED (will submit Pic, below)

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Sky...you are doing better than me...I can't find the way to make this automatic. -Jacob

--- 帖子 #300 ---
ShowAlert = false; yeah guys, i think i made it too complicated

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Here is that Pic... Cable already fire up trades, then I load EA on UJ and got trades executed, while NO TRADES EXPECTED displaying. I think I better use only 1 EA (on Cable) on MT4, to work as designed. And now CABLE Pending trades been deleted (What the heck? ) I think I better go back to manual mode

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Sky, well, i think it's a problem for now to ran on more then one pair, i am still not clear how to finish a couple of things because of this giant construction of 5 files communicated thru global variables ... so will do the best and will see

--- 帖子 #303 ---
SKY. I really appreciate all the testing you are doing to help Alex. I wish I knew how to help you but I have no clue.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Hi Sky, I had the same problem with trades firing off for now reason, I even had some trades close with 50pip drawdowns, not sure why. I am wondering if the EA is getting confused since i forgot to change the magic number for each pair under testing. Great job Sasha on the EA it's a great work in progress, we'll keep testing and report back.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Same here... running os EURUSD and GBPUSD Order sent although indicator shows NO TRADE EXPECTED

--- 帖子 #306 ---
ok, guys, dont use it on many pairs for a while, i will try to figure out something

--- 帖子 #307 ---
How many times do they have to be told only GBP/USD

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Sometimes the indicator says enter trade now but no order box. I tend to ignore this.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Hi all, I have been using Geoff's Tokyo for some time now and am really impressed. Not tried the manual version yet but from everything i have read it sounds very promising. Just wanted to say hi and keep up the great work. I will update on progress, of course only on GU

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Yes, I did.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Gerry, Then why did you change the TP's? They were optimized at the same time the SL was. They are all a part of Geoff's trusted system.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Because I am happy with a little profit and getting into more trades than waiting to hit the default TP s.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
S: Thanks for clearing this up. It is not too complicated. Just some like me are dumb to certain facts of how to change things. Thanks again

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Sasha, Of course I understand.. No problem as we are still testing.. suggestion: Try to keep it as simple as possible.. We have too many features already, don't need anything fancy, gotta keep code simple and clean.. P.S. I removed everything, only Cable left with v3.7 on auto execution mode, let's see how it goes..

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Mary, here is that Indicator TVI_Histogram on my 15m chart per your request..

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Thanks, Skyze. I put the histogram on a separate GBP/USD chart and the block for the histogram was there, but there wasn't anything in it.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
I agree!! Why can't we follow the rules!!

--- 帖子 #318 ---
I think that when something goes so right like this, we try to use it in other conditions to see if it goes also so right. If it was a bad TS, we would not use it in any of the pairs...

--- 帖子 #319 ---
I second that - simpler the better and less confusions/conflicts. I'm still trading w/v3.4 and very happy. Sasha, thanks.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
You'd need to install this one as well to make it work.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Thanks to you both! Will do that now. (2 minutes later: Voila! Done!)

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Sasha - it is IBFX's real time demo account - not in the strategy tester. As a quick reference, I am using v3.5 and had orders pending. I thought I could drag and drop the DELETE PENDING orders script onto the chart and it would delete those orders. That is when I get the error message.... T...

--- 帖子 #323 ---
you have both ea and indicator attached to the chart?

--- 帖子 #324 ---
I'm familiar with Geoff's original and I'm trading it live. I'm interested in testing this version out and I've searched this thread but haven't seen any info on back testing it. Is it possible to back test this version? thanks!

--- 帖子 #325 ---
I just noticed on v3.7 mode is manual, which I have been doing well with. How do I make mode automatic?

--- 帖子 #326 ---
gerry, looks like i made it - now of you press No in the pop up message, ea will wait until a next signal change, can you try it?

--- 帖子 #327 ---
it's ShowAlert = false but if you will take v3.8 it's ManualMode = false

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Sashasan, I just want to be clear. If I set ShowAlert to false on v3.7 the mode will then be automatic? Thanks for your support!

--- 帖子 #329 ---
on V3.4 is like that, False for automatic after set to false or true, can see on chart, have show automatic or manual mode..

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Trying it now Alex.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
yes, ShowAlert is that pop up message where you can see all the info about orders which will be opened next, so if this is false, when indicator generates a signal, ea will place orders without confirmation

--- 帖子 #332 ---
check EURUSD - it's just triggered when No pressed, you should see additional test line in message saying SIGNAL PASSED when current signal will be gone, this has to disappear

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Thanks so much! I guess I somehow I did not get that clearly from reading post#1. Thanks again. I love your system! You have taken Geoff's system to the next level!!

--- 帖子 #334 ---
i think all those those problems could be avoided if to combine indicator and ea in one. but it's not gonna be manual setup already

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Yeah, I like the way that we can manipulate manually as well.. Indicator is good, but I'd like to see when: "ENTER TRADE NOW" message triggers, EA actually Enter trade immediately (I mean place Buy Stops/Sell Stops).. I think there is some miss communication between those 2 dudes EA and Indicator, when sometimes EA taking trades without Indicator Trigger or Vise versa, when Indicator Alarming for trade nothing going on on EA front.... I'll be leaving now, Talk to you guys tomorrow, thank you all

--- 帖子 #336 ---
yeah, i mean it would look like the same, text with smas values and fractals and the same popup messages which could be accepted/rejected to open and not open orders.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Alex there is no show alert on 3.8

--- 帖子 #338 ---
i recently changed it to ManualMode sorry did not put ion first page yet

--- 帖子 #339 ---
So will the box still show up?

--- 帖子 #340 ---
if ManualMode = true yes i just got it

--- 帖子 #341 ---
I am with ( No trades expected )

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Getting better all the time Alex.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
see here : it's 1 minute ago chart from IBFX: short entry : Attached Image (click to enlarge) after i pushed No : Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #344 ---
but i still think that some time period (let's say 5 minute as a next fractal change on M5) would be better, but may be more annoying

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Looking good. Are you testing this EA on other pairs??

--- 帖子 #346 ---
no, it's just to show you that it works btw, when i will merge indicator and ea it would be possible to test in on history as any other ea (if someone actually needs this)

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Yes - the EA did fire on this chart and closed successfully the first set of 3 orders. Nothing was changed. The EA placed the buy stop but price had not yet reached that point so the orders were still pending. I decided I wanted to cancel those 3 pending orders. I dragged and dropped the DELETE PENDING V3.5 script gave me the error message. Again - I already had one set of three orders created by the EA and closed profitable. T...

--- 帖子 #348 ---
well, i am sorry, in this case it's just my poor knowledge of MQL , when it will be merged, there will not be such a problem

--- 帖子 #349 ---
HI Guys, Well just read the whole thread and have successfully loaded the EA etc on the charts ( after a couple of goes it's a man thing should read instructions first) Anyway looks promising so am demoing this . A couple of people seem to want to trade other pairs with this system and if you are trading maunualy you can do it Most time if Cable is going in a certain direction NZ, AUD, EUR all move in the same direction and CAD and CHF do the opposite so you could trade other pairs that way. One question if I trade manually do I need the EA turned on or do I turn it off ?? Thanks for all the work guys look forward to some good pips.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
yes, both of them on chart and use scripts to place trades

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Please - Please - Please don't feel an apology is necessary. I have three or four different ways that I could have killed those orders. All I wanted to do is to bring it to you attention that I had problems with the script to perhaps prevent a larger problem in the future. I know that sometimes people rush to go live, risking money that they cannot afford to lose, trying to find that holy grail. I hope that we are all able to gain a greater result through the sharing of ideas and our findings. Again, I appreciate your sharing of your talents and skills. T...

Good morning Sasha, Sky, Garry and good morning to all. Again great thanks to all of you for the fantastic EA. I already close my live session ; Oanda V3,4 1 x 30 pips GU Alpari V3,7 22, 24, 26. GU. Since yesterday I'm testing V3,7 on manual mode with perfect result and just now on auto mode with no result at all. All that test have done with FXCM , Alpari, FxPro , SIG and with six pairs on each and demo acc. What I'm doing wrong on auto mode? Regards Mac.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Hi guys! Which is better: market orders or a pending orders? (settings). I see that the distance in 20 pips (the default setting) for a lot of pending orders. If the signal received from the EA, then the best way: use the markets or pendings?

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Hi!What are your settings for 3.7?Thx.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Hi D.i.m.l. Only alert false to change for auto. After few hours beck to manual and it works perfect as before. Mac

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Hi Sashsan I am still getting confirmation. Is there a way we can set it to auto trade like Geoff's one? I couldn't see any settings(may be i am missing it ).... Got it i need to changed the showalert to false (from post 331) Velli

--- 帖子 #360 ---
This is to sign into the thread. Tx all!

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Alex. Tried it twice and worked perfectly.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Newbs start polluting the thread again, "how to download". "how to open zip file". "show me" Please Read Windows Help or search Google. We don't want this thread to be 10000 pages of nonsense, like many of them are. Thank you for your cooperation

--- 帖子 #363 ---
I put this EA on four pairs, automatic, thinking what the heck last night before I went to bed. Woke up to over $2700 profit on my demo account. You guys have something really good here. Thanks so much for sharing it.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
rebecca, it's great but be careful because it's still not proven on many pairs

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Sasha, I'm thinking, maybe implement that Indicator "Manual Setup" Inside EA, but still show, those messages so we know, if there is any orders coming? Like Original Geo's, ones Fractals and SMA lined up, hit Stop Buy/Sell orders and trail, cause right now looks like there is some miss communication between them.. So far looks like it's easy Win, because Actually everything just going straight up against the dollar, biz as usual..

--- 帖子 #366 ---
yes it works ok, however, sometime there is a possibility to get a popup message again because of the "fractals playing", i got it a couple of times

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Baruch again!

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Just ran this EA with automatic mode on 7 pairs on demo account last night and got 152 pips already. Some pairs orders are still not closed (with negative profit at this moment) and will keep forward testing on it. Sashasan, it's really great! I think more tweaking can be done on it

--- 帖子 #369 ---
..just opened on live and demo accounts..automatic FXDD Hugh spike down..will ride it out.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
alex is ver 3.8 the ver of choice it's not listed on page 1 Thank you so much for your hard work

--- 帖子 #371 ---
well, the strategy itself is created by GEOFF so all the benefits go to him first, i just created a little more advanced system from his strategy

--- 帖子 #372 ---
ok guys, here it is - v4 is an ea which is indicator and ea merged together make sure everything is fine, so i will add scripts later (so now it's gonna be only automatic/semiautomatic mode)

--- 帖子 #373 ---
also, a little notice, as was mentioned before, if you have an ea attached on a chart and change a symbol on the chart (drag for example from Market Watch), ea will first calculate all the data based on old ticks loaded on chart , and later on, after new ticks will be loaded, calculate a current data again. so it could show you a ENTER MARKET NOW message and after a second change it to some different one. IN THIS CASE BE CAREFUL IF ManulaMode = false, IF OLD TICKS WERE ENTRY ONES, EA WILL PLACE MARKET ORDERS IMMEDIATELY AND AFTER WILL RECALCULATE VALUES BASED ON THE NEW FRESH TICKS AND SHOW YOU THOSE CALCULATIONS WHICH WILL BE DIFFERENT!!!

--- 帖子 #374 ---
i think the post above is an explanation for this because when you change a symbol (or timeframe), terminal should refresh and download ticks for 3 timeframes - M5, M15 and H1 and ea calculate the values, but for some reason ea will do his job faster (at least on my very powerful machine), and it will calculate values based on old data first and later change it to the very fresh

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Hitting the 'Refresh' button should take care of that problem.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
yeah, btw, i dont know is this possible to program an algorithm which will allow a termianl download and refresh all data on 3 time frames first and after get ea do his job only if like a simple pause in 1-2 seconds???

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Sasha, spasibo, will test it as soon as my orders on Cable either hit TP or SL, cause they are like stuck somewhere on the middle.. I hope that new version of EA will only take a trade, if there is no other trades open already earlier like usual..

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Hi Sasha, Sky has a point to EA had kicked off a GU buy yesterday and it is still open. I'm not sure in the code if you have trade discovery in the code but the EA just opened another GU order. Weird

--- 帖子 #379 ---
is it about v3.8 or v4?

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Oops sorry, It happened to me in 3.7 and 3.8

--- 帖子 #381 ---
forget about, here is my first test for July, IBFX demo, default settings, "slow" trailing 3 losses, 2 of them i guess, could be avoided using "fast" trailing also, i think 30 pips PlaceDistance should be better then 20 modeling quality 90% (is it good or bad??) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Just loaded the new EA thanks for all your hard work I must admit I am a real man and have trouble reading the instructions so have printed out post one and going through it step by step which does help. The one thing I DON'T Do is LOAD IT ON A HEAP OF PAIRS GBP ONLY

--- 帖子 #383 ---
It's the best you can get- 90%... So, it's perfect. And even though I also trading it on IBFX so far, that particular broker is Sucks, cause 4 pips Spread is huge, even Geo original doesn't have good backtesting results using IBFX.. == == == By the way. we can do another trick.. Ones Fractals and SMA triggers, set LIMIT BUY BELOW where it is let's say 30-40 (variable) pips and wait till pair settles down to grab long (this will happens in most of the cases).. It might work even better.. If you going to play with this, just look into it and see how difficult to make that option.. So? HERE! Case for BUY, Fractals triggers place stop buys 20-30 pips above and BUY LIMIT 30 pips below If BUY LIMIT Triggers first, BUY STOP Canceled.. Just an Idea... Maybe first try with BUY LIMIT ONLY (Cause this could be even better solution "Buy LOW" AND IMPORTANT: STOP LOSS CALCULATED FROM ORIGINAL TRIGGER LEVEL) EXAMPLE.. BUY TRIGGERS AT 1.5550 PLACE BUY LIMIT ORDERS at 1.5510 (Variable) and STOP LOSS 1.5550-140 pips (1.5410), this way we just limit stop loss by 40 pips to just 100 pips! And potentially maximize profit by same amount of pips ORDER Canceled, if Price goes beyond TP levels ) Rinse ans repeat. and then add BUY STOP if need it.. Basically Idea is GRAB Pair Lower while BUY Signal is still VALID. As I watch the trades almost always there is a drop and opportunity to grab pair lower..

--- 帖子 #384 ---
i think it's a good idea, in other words, when entry signal given, place 2 sets of pending orders and wait who will be first and delete the second pair. but what's about trailing? do we need it in BUY LIMIT case? looks like only in BUY STOP this makes sense btw, in this case there is no reason to open 6 orders, i think it's easier to place 2 lines on chart, move them and when it will be crossed, place real orders

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Would that be defined as hedging? Can't hedge in U.S.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
no, it's two types of same type orders i mean BUY STOP places above current price, BUY LIMIT below

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Oh, I see.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
What if we place BUY LIMIT 30-40 (pips below) ((Maybe even trail Buy LIMIT up in case pair going higher straight away but still, we going to grab lower swing rather than higher)) and just wait till it gets hit and in 80% cases it will, same as BUY STOP, the only difference is for Buy stop we paying premium and for Buy Limit we actually collect the premium..

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Just had three trades triggered with the new EA At 1.56091 very Impressed with this so far guys once again thanks PS I have set my SL to 100 just a personal thing.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Hi, been busy elsewhere. Just noticed the thread. Thanks much. Will be running some tests to try to familiarize with the concept. Have used v1 indi a few times with good result, but this has come along way since v1.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Just want to share my impressive results. All defaults except the ALERT FALSE. Thanks again for the code

--- 帖子 #392 ---
TP1 hit TP2 Trailing stop hit (for profit I must add) TP3 still going Nice system so far TP3 trailing SL hit ( in profit ) New orders placed at 1.56222 HUH And this is with a ranging pair

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Sasha when I try to backtest v4_Beta got bunch of "OrderModify error 1"

--- 帖子 #394 ---
can you tell me when it shows that (before/after close 1 order, while modifying to b/e or while trailing 2 and 3 orders) or give me a piece of log messages? error description says : " OrderModify attempts to replace the values already set with the same values. " looking at my yesterday's log i could not find any repeating records so far...

--- 帖子 #395 ---
btw i think i fixed this add a pause of 3 sec and now there is no chance to place a trade even if automatic mode selected

--- 帖子 #396 ---
also, make sure your trailing stop (loss for 2 and 3rd orders) is less then take profit for those orders

load v4.0 beta on several pairs 3 orders, market not pending. on automatic triggered nothing on manual works, sometimes open 3 orders, sometime 2, or 1, without any logic.... ??? some help? ps. no errors on expert tab.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
i need your screen and Experts log to look at anyway, it cannot open any other numbers of orders than chosen in OpenOrders option (Actually can but only if you use a decompiled version ) orders open algorithm is the same as in the original Geoff's ea actually

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Let me ask you a dumb question: Does the EA sells too? Because in 7 days there are only BUY orders in my account history... Regards Doc

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Do u get that error on all your order modifies? Is your ECN option set correctly? I've noticed that when I don't have the right setting for ECN, I get that error.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
found the .log modify in .txt attached it's a mess inside ... 1. at 15.05 2 sell orders usdcad.... one hit tp1, the second running atm (not for long .... tp2 is near) 2. at 15.20 1 sell order usdjpy .... running atm in red 3. at 15.42 2 sell orders usdchf ... running all settings default (3 orders...) with market orders... now I see at UJ pair forgot to set ecn false... thank you ... hope it helps. ps. Alpary uk - micro demo

hmmm magic number has to have a minimum number of digits? because i put 1,2,3 on fist pair, 4,5,6 on second ... and so on ....

--- 帖子 #403 ---
you know, i never tried to set up magics less then 5 digits so have no idea, but if it will be more then 9, it will still work but will show a different # in hint so because of that i use 9 btw, you dont have to change it to any new pair - since you have it set up, you can use it on unlimited amount of pairs with no problem (because ea will also check for Symbol() at any order)

--- 帖子 #404 ---
i see ... thanks. any clue about no. of orders? I post the log like you asked me .... cheers!

--- 帖子 #405 ---
yeah, you have a real mess here, restart your terminal, load v4 only on lets say 3 pairs and see what happen. from your current log i can realize that you reloaded ea many times and during some earlier session got orders opened and after changed magic #s, in this case you will get an unpredictable result BECAUSE EA CAN LOCATE ORDERS WITH PRESET MAGIC #S ONLY SO ANY OTHER ORDERS WILL BE IGNORED

--- 帖子 #406 ---
of course, you mean for a cable? i just got short entry on USDCAD

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Sasha: Do you have max slippage built in for order placing incl. market, pending and SL for v3.8 or newer versions? Thanks again for this fantastic EA. Richard

--- 帖子 #408 ---
you rock! thank you! I'll do so... restart, load ea &amp; set files .... blessings and pips!

--- 帖子 #409 ---
sashasan, How many pairs are you trading?

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Hi guys. I've been a user of Geoff's EA for a few weeks now and on his other thread and becuase of the success with that I decied to try this. I read the whole thread and decided to try this on different pairs on demo just to see how it works (GU MA's were not in consolidation so wont get a trigger today). It seems to have worked well in market order mode and actually baged some healthy pips. On Pending order mode, it created three sell stop orders on USDCHF (using the pair for testing only). The issue is that when I deleted the orders, the EA recreated them again. I did it again with the same result. Apart from taking the EA off the chart, is there another way to remove the pending orders if I decide against them? Also, do you guys think it is best to use pending or market orders? Many thanks in advance. Z

--- 帖子 #412 ---
fxrich, right now it's set up to 3 (4 digits broker), but i can surely add this option in the next version

--- 帖子 #413 ---
u Sasha, I think that an option for 'Limit Order' with user's choice of price will be a big + for this EA. Richard

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Thank you.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Zr-fx, this is a new version of ea which combines indicator and ea into one file. in previous version there were 3 additional scripts to add and delete orders, but for now this option disabled because i would like to make sure everything works fine and later add it. anyway, you have only 2 possible scenarios in Pending orders mode : -- if Manual mode chosen, you can press Yes to place trades or No to reject it (and ea will ignore current signal and will wait until next signal change) -- if Manual mode not chosen,you simply have no other option because for ea this choice means you are agree to place orders anytime when a new signal will come so if you want to take more control, do that as gerry does - PlaceMarkerOrders = false and ManualMode = true

--- 帖子 #416 ---
not a problem new stuff will be added as soon as everybody is happy with the current beta version also, sky said about using them together, but you try to say that user has to choose either but not both?

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Both is definitely the best as long as there are no conflicts in coding.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
am playing with 5 now, but it's too early to publish the results need more options to make it more cable-contrary

--- 帖子 #419 ---
in coding not, but in your broker yes after he will see this 6-orders pips' thresher

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Sasha, I mean that user has the option to choose either one but has both available in the EA. Richard

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Many thanks Sasha. I expected this answer. I am testing using Market Orders on different pairs and this thing is on fire . But I will eventualy go live on GU unless tests on others pair prove to be good. Great work

--- 帖子 #423 ---
NO what I think is, RISK:REWARD will be much better.. because, As I said, if you place Limited Buy orders 40 pip below Trigger price I want you to calculate stop loss from the Triggered price, in that case you will lose 100 pips instead of 140 and multiply that by 3 for example (you save 120 pips) and now when your Limited Buy orders get triggered you might go for Original TP pips + 40. So, for example instead of 22-24-26 now you can possibly get tp at 60-64-66 how about that ? Now you got 100 SL and 65 TP!! ( In that example)

--- 帖子 #424 ---
i got this message too when tried to test during last 2 days, but it comes with many "TestGenerator: unmatched data errors", you have the same?

--- 帖子 #425 ---
of course i understand all this, but what if buy limit order will not activated? or if market drops down very fast? in case of BUY STOP ea will wait until trailing down will reach -100 pips and just delete it, but in case of limit order still take a negative

--- 帖子 #426 ---
No Sasha I don't have those ones.. I'll try test little bit later again

--- 帖子 #427 ---
ok guys, so both or either? :nerd:

--- 帖子 #428 ---
I think #1 you'll need 2 different settings: Either Use Buy Stops Or Limited Buys, not both of them at the same time. #2 I'm thinking if after trigger, price going to go up, you might want to trail Buy Limit Orders and STOP LOSS up as well. (AS we do Buy Stops now) #3 Yes, we might have little bit less trades, but remember we already trading 24/7 instead of just 23 GMT few times a week.. 40 pips maybe too big I just used as example.. Perhaps 30 can be use Everyone should set their own value.. CHECK M15 TODAY Cable ACTION Look That Drop and then Shoot up 100+ pips.. Anyways, Buy lower always better than higher " but in case of limit order still take a negative " Geo original EA traders taking Negative almost in 80% cases and price almost always rebounds based on that fractals theory.. We just want to grab those Buys lower and use those GAP down pips for PROFIT. P.S.S Problem with CABLE is volatility especially during NY Market hours.. It's much quiet at 23 GMT.. That's why Hard to use BUY STOP with such crazy swings.. I better buy it lower 40 pips then get triggered higher..

--- 帖子 #429 ---
To me, Sasha, I'd like to have the option to choose one of both at the time of order placing if possible but definitely not to choose both at the same time. Thanks for your attention. Richard

--- 帖子 #430 ---
ok, i fixed my error 1 which was always came up after buy stop orders became buy, but you, sky, have it on buy stop orders as well ... what the broker do you test on?

--- 帖子 #431 ---
IBFX.. P.S Buy Stop also good, the only thing that killing this is high Cable Volatility.. Those Pops and Drops. I'm sure it would work perfectly after 23 GMT. While During NY session, BUY LIMIT should work much better. Now STOP buys just triggered, trailing down real good And I don't have Modify Errors in Real Account, so far, who cares about backtesting..

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Richard, thanks for your opinion, we will do that, i have here just a dump user's question - in manual mode how you will decide which order type to choose?

--- 帖子 #433 ---
i am too!!!

--- 帖子 #435 ---
I have no Idea, let's concentrate on forward testing for now, make sure real ones doesn't have Modify Errors and so far so good. P.S About which one to chose... Trader should chose this right in Settings.. Either Limit or Stop.. Or maybe Both??? Later on??? One trigger cancel the other? Let's test what we have for now... Watch Action closely..

ok, here is my last fixed version, try it and get back with results

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Thanks, will do

--- 帖子 #438 ---
just tried on alpari - gave me additional loss on 20th

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Sasha, thank you in advance for doing it in your next version. I think this is my own style of trading, that is, to start it manually and let your ea to manage the orders. I like Sky's idea about integrating a limit order into the ea, but I like to decide where to put a separate limit order some time later if the PA goes the other direction in a big way, based on my own judgement of the market situation at that moment. I believe this will not be considered as hedging by my broker. Actually, I'm very happy with what v3.8 can do right now as I said before, I only trade one pair at a time using manual mode. Have a good weekend! Richard

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Had that SELL on USDCAD also... What I noticed is that eh target for #1 was hitted, but the order was not closed... Shouldn´t I have only 2 open orders?

--- 帖子 #441 ---
with spread of 5 pips? check mark Show Ask Line in Properties and will see

--- 帖子 #442 ---
OPS... Different broker... the other one was 2 pips only... Better sleep a little before making any other comment...

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Well guys just woke up in NZ and all three trades hit TP Very IMpressed Interesting that as I said before with the way the pair was looking yesterday (sort of ranging) I would not normally looked to trade it Thanks once again guys great work

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Just had three more trades triggered at 1.56844 52 minutes gone TP one hit Trail stops took out the other two trades and wait for it "IN" profit amazing you could do this all day Thanks guys

--- 帖子 #445 ---
hello sashasan, thanks for the new version. I backtested gbp/usd with various parameters for the last 7 months and the results don't seem to be good except july. maybe some optimization is required. I'd like to ask you something different, and maybe a bit off the topic. Is there any chance that you would add a 'reverse order' option to the EA. I mean, when the indicator gives BUY signal EA sells, or vice versa. What I have in mind is kind of a scalping method. In some of my backtests, I used market order parameter with 15 tp and 15 sl. The graph consistently dropped, so I thought if we can reverse how the EA works, then we may get something with 10 pips tp/sl setting. thanks in advance...

--- 帖子 #446 ---
in other words, you mean for buy limits it should be exactly opposite than for buy stops - if market go up, trail it and if it's more then 100 pips move, delete those orders?

--- 帖子 #447 ---
excellent idea but how ea would identify when a new signal is coming - is it a "straight" or "reverse" signal?

--- 帖子 #448 ---
well, actually it doesn't have to identify it. it will always trade reverse or straight according to the selection. it's like trading against the trend which the indicator specifies. the thing is the stoploss of 140pips is too large, and sometimes it hits. when it hits, it takes the profit of at least 7 trades. so, if we decrease this number, it hits more frequently, and when we decrease stoploss to -15 or so almost every 2 trade out of 3 hits the stoploss. what I'm thinking is that if it hits stoploss that frequently, then maybe we should trade that direction.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Yes, exactly.. And when Orders placed, stop loss must be calculated from Triggered price. If we place BUY LIMIT orders 40 pips below Triggered price, then SL would be 140-40= 100 pips

--- 帖子 #450 ---
yeah, i remember this

--- 帖子 #451 ---
also, looks like "slow" trailing would not work at all with limit orders?

--- 帖子 #452 ---
you mean to get a pop up option where user will choose how to interpret a signal - as a trend or a counter trend?

--- 帖子 #453 ---
ok, here it is - v4.1 beta with limit orders for now, if "slow" trailing chosen, limit orders will not be trailed, only with "fast" it's a testing version, on my IBFX works ok

--- 帖子 #454 ---
Is this Exclusevely for limited Orders only or combination either Stop or limited? Thank you, Sasha, will check it out..

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Hi Sashasan, I am not able to use it as an indicator. Please help. Thanks, FXNUB

--- 帖子 #456 ---
no, it's both but either if PlaceStopOrder = true it will place Buy/Sell Stop order if PlaceStopOrder = false it will place Buy/Sell Limit Order (sorry for this stupid options choice, but it's the only one available in mql4. also could be digits like PendingOrderOption = 1 as stop and 2 as limit but i think it's harder to remember)

--- 帖子 #457 ---
no sashasan, there is no need for a popup or for user to make a choice for each trade. what I'm asking is placing an option into the settings to reverse the trade direction. I don't know much about programming, but in my opinion this can be handled with a formula like: if 'reverse' is on =&gt; when buy (or buy stop) signal is given place an order of sell (or sell stop) else =&gt; when buy signal is given, place an order of buy it's like changing the direction of a current with a switch, on and off...

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Looking good .

--- 帖子 #459 ---
personally I like the options to change as I said I have my SL at 100 pips may even reduce that yet. not convinced abut the limit order either but good to have the option once again loving your work

--- 帖子 #460 ---
ok, so updated last version on the first page

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Thanks a lot, Sasha. Will start trying it today when market opens. Richard

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Hello, Sasha! Sorry for my English. I test your EA in tester with default settings on 5m and 1H. Trades not open. Mistakes as image

Positive trade on Geoff's EA tonight. Another long trade triggered on automatic as soon as the original EA closed!

Hi Lawgirl. Positive trades also for me ( 2 )

Hi GB, Are you using the original and the Manual/Automatic also? I'm still using camV3 for original and the automatic that I am running continuously on GBPUSD only. We've had a great start to a new month.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Sashas thankyou for working with Geoff and working on the EA I have mine set to auto because im not around computer much. My trade just opened on GBPUSD @ 01:45 after tokyo open and at 1.5732 on IBFX. The time of tokyo opening doesn't matter now on this EA, it is ok to open after tokyo open am I correct. It opened trade 2 hours after people were getting trades on tokyo v16 and at the point when it reached tp. One more ? what is the difference between fast trailing stop and slow. thankyou and keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
This is Scary! I put this on 5 pairs on Demo just to see how it works and follow its actions. From Friday afternoon until now it has banked 501 pips (although I still have about -50 pips total in open trades) This is on Alpari UK demo with fully automatic Market order. I say scary because it is so tempting to just go live with these results but it would be foolish. I'll continue testing on Demo for another week and see how it goes. My intention is to put it live on GU only unless I cannot resist being greedy. So far very impressive

--- 帖子 #471 ---
banked 22+20+50 pips! thank you ....

--- 帖子 #472 ---
I'm watching this ea open and take these amazing trades on demo London open till now 3 hours later.. GBPUSD, AUDUSD, EURUSD. Will watch a bit more and then take the plunge.... Probably tomorrow London...

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Anybody trying Limited Buy instead of Buy Stops? I just load up EA, Cable too high

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Hi Lawgirl. I am using Geoff's Ea and The manual EA coded by Sasha. The manual EA I put on automatic last night and it took 2 sets of trades all with my TP being met. +22 +28. Most of the time I trade in the manual mode but last night I decided to go auto. Geoff's EA does not trade much for me as I am using IBFX but always a winner.

--- 帖子 #475 ---
Another + 22 on auto a minute ago. 1 more trade to go.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
+ on cable too, currently + 949 pips (second order)

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Another + 28. I am worried that all these winning trades have been long. I just hope this system will work when we have short trades.

--- 帖子 #478 ---
go to USDCAD there are still many of shorts

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Thanks Sasha. I will try it on demo.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Does anyone think GU will break 1.5900

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Yeap, it's going to 1.63-1.65 In days like this I see better use of Stop Buy orders instead of Limit Buys, but Ones pair settles down for some kind of a range, Buy Limit will get more handy.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
How do are you determining that just trying to learn

Hi Guys What is the best TF for the GBPUSD? Thanks, Mr. Juliusss

Gerry, have you got this on live or demo?

Sandra. LIVE.

I very seldom use a demo account. Only when I am trying something new.

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Automatic just triggered long trades on this pair...on demo, but doesn't look right.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
H1 or 15M, really doesn't matter.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
two of my positions were closed with +94 pips this morning, but a second one was trailed by 50 step, so if i would set up 70 or 80 i would still have it open and trailed up

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Ok, look at this daily since last high. If Cable doesn't stop at 1.5950-1.60 (61.8 Fib) then we can see 1.70 next (full retrace ) and I think we will:

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Sasha, which one you are using? Buy Stops? Almost impossible to grab anything with the Buy limit now, cause Dollar tanking like a titanic (what else is new )

--- 帖子 #492 ---
I see thanks for the lesson gu is definitely sky rocketing

--- 帖子 #493 ---
buy on tops never looks right .... but somehow it works all the time.... cheers few hours ago .... http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=471

--- 帖子 #494 ---
yes, i used buy stop actually, is it possible to make ea suggesting to choose limit or stop orders based on some algorithm? like you said, calculating high/low of prev day etc. i mean just to make a hint option in the very last line of message where say "LIMIT ORDERS ARE SUGGESTED"

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Hi sashasan Please, can you tell us what is your beste PAIR, TF, settings? Thanks, Mr. Juliusss

--- 帖子 #496 ---
sasha ... first of all BIG THANKS!!! for willing to share .... to limit the risk, I'd like to choose for example: first trade 1 full lot, second 0.5, and the last .1, instead of 1,1,1 or whatever ... what do you say guys???? it's a good ideea? many time I freaked out and I close earlier ..... I think you know what I'm talking about ... hard to code? thanks.....

--- 帖子 #497 ---
cable with 2 orders with small take profit1 and huge take profit2 and trailing stop

--- 帖子 #498 ---
I'll second this motion. I would like that too if possible.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
thank you.....

--- 帖子 #500 ---
What I'm thinking right now it's a potential to place those Buy Limits in spread.. Let's say 3 orders scenario trigger a buy, Place 1st order immediately and place 2nd 20 pips lower and 3rd 40 pips lower (Limited Buys), if pair never goes down, fine, we still get 1 order in profit and if it does we going to average down sort off.. So far just testing limited order version and see how to do that in better way..

--- 帖子 #501 ---
just added and uploaded to the first page

--- 帖子 #502 ---
An interesting read in line with Sky's suggestion of scaling into the trades.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
that was quick !!!! thanks...

--- 帖子 #504 ---
HI Guys, is it possiable to enter trades on semi automatic/maual and then switch to automatic to manage the trade or is this asking a bit much of the wee EA beast. Sp another three trades hit TP lastnight

--- 帖子 #505 ---
I think the EA manages every trade you enter, automatic or not.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
This EA work in history data or only realtime?

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Thanks, Sasha.

Hi Dryclean I have just woken up (in Queensland where it was 28oC a couple of days ago - its mid winter!!). It appears that GU is stuck in a range having just nudged above the 1.5900 - got to 1.5907. The system likes some more volatility than GU is showing at the moment but in the last 24 hours, between Geoff and Sashasan, I have nailed over 400 pips - long and short - using GU, UJ, U/CHF and EU. My TPs are 22,50 and 80 with 140 SL but I admit to some manual fiddling with the GU trades as I moved the stops up on TP3 to lock in the increasing profit. Demo only unfortunately but live soon I think. Karl

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Sash, I wonder if we could have the option to switch the screen display on/off. I am trading with 4 screens (4 pairs) and the writing on the reduced size charts makes it difficult to see the candles!! I am just coming back to FX (I like to trade index futures) - but reading Geoff's thread (over 500 pages) and now yours, I am ready to do some serious testing/trading. Thank you and those who have contributed to this very interesting thread. I for one am very grateful for the amount of time you have put into this and your generosity in sharing with folk like me who are far less capable. Well done. Karl

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Zeroing in on the best entries using the trailing pending orders is absolute genius. Whoever even heard of such thing, trailing pending orders... kudos...

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Karl, thanks, can you explain more detailfull what you mean about display? am little unclear about it...

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Hi jiva. just arrive to destination This for just GU like geoff's or any pair? 24 hours? and 5m? Sorry to not read whole thread yet.........

--- 帖子 #513 ---
so like 1 market and 2 limits?

--- 帖子 #514 ---
I am referring to the detailed information written on the chart. Its useful reference, but obscures the candles. Once read to confirm settings, it is not necessary and I would be happy to be able to switch it off. It is not important, particularly when trading the robot, but I like to follow the price action. Karl

--- 帖子 #515 ---
The present situation on UJ is a good example of what Sky is suggesting. Reading the article Krunofx linked to helps understand the idea. Since the trade was triggered on the UJ pair, PA has gone against the trade some 20 pips. Entering the second stage of an order now would lower the average entry price and if the trade takes off in our favour, this will improve the end result. I would like to be able to test various entry levels though, as this could vary with different pairs.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Offshore One way to do what you are asking is to use Steve Hopwood's MTPM to manage the trade automatically once the trade has been manually entered. It is a masterful piece of programming. It will look after any trades on a number of charts on the same platform. Multi-purpose management EA http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...99&amp;postcount=1 Cheers Karl

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Sasha, exactly.. 1st Market order will insure we take a position and in case of pair move straight up, give as a profit.. and second and third order should be placed on decided Variable spread, let's say for example second trade 20 pips below and third 40 pips below first order, STOP LOSS and TAKE PROFIT, Calculating from MARKET ORDER #1. So, basically If we have 1st TP = 22 second = 25 and Third=30 then basically if all orders get triggered TP going to be as following 1st = 22 pips 2nd 25 + 20 (If triggered) =45 3rd 30 +40 (if triggered) = 70 STOP LOSS FOR ALL ORDERS must be calculated from Market Order #1 P.S And I don't think we need a trail those orders at all..

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Cheers karl I will look into it.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Sash Perhaps a screen shot of my charts will show what I mean about the writing on the screen being a bit too much! Karl

--- 帖子 #520 ---
ok, i see no prob

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Perhaps, when you make enough profit, you can but 3 more flat screens, they are cheap these days..

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Forgot to Tell you, your EA's and trades are SCREWED cause you have same Magic Numbers for all EA's, did you notice???

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Thanks Sky. First, does it matter if numbers are the same. They are different pairs and show in the history which pairs are trading. I would certainly change numbers if live to avoid broker interference!! It does not seem to matter as trades are occuring without problem.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Hi Sashasan Can you put parameter Hide_Target, Hide_StopLoss and Stealth mode for avoid Broker can to see our orders.? Thankd in advance, Mr. Juliusss

--- 帖子 #525 ---
no i mean i can but in most cases it will work against you when market moves very quick, ea can miss a level and you will be in loss instead of profit. i got in this situation very often with Geoff's original ea

--- 帖子 #526 ---
btw, you need to turn it off only after a new set of orders opened or anytime?

--- 帖子 #527 ---
i will do that just curious how to identify this option in pop up menu

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Does the EA use the text on the screen to effectively trade? If not, then it could be switched off anytime. Please don't make a meal of this - it isn't so important but thanks for your interest. Karl

--- 帖子 #529 ---
ok i thought to make it by this way - after new orders opened, it will automatically gone after lets say 5 seconds

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Hi Sashasan Can you explain why PendingOpenSte=20? What is better PendingOpenSte=20 or PlaceMarketOrder? Thanks, Mr. Juliusss

--- 帖子 #531 ---
looks like we might struggle to push past 1.5900

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Sash Your idea works for me. Thank you Karl

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Happy landing... http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:A...ookb0dQ9AHNFw= I had to read the thread twice to really get what is going on with the ea. Highly recommended to read the thread. The discussion posted in open forum is invaluable. Thanks to you, Sashasan, and all the others who are digging in with shirt sleeves rolled up. A quick answer, if I may, it's open turf on what pairs, GBPUSD is favored. 5min fractals and 15 min fractals have been designed as entry signals for a move on the 1h.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Offshore It has to - I have a long trade with first TP at 1.50137! Have faith! Although the short trend is down, the long trend is still up . Let it cook. Karl

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Now your just being greedy thats almost 900 pips well done you do have Patience Well 1.5918 You where right

--- 帖子 #536 ---
i have no idea just approximate distance between price and pending order place also it depends what king of trailing you want to use - if slow, so if ok and can be greater, if fast, 10-20 good enough

--- 帖子 #537 ---
also guys, is this have a sense - to limit a number of trades per 1 h candle? i mean even if a signal is given, set opened and closed fast right away, after opened again during same hour candle, do not open it (vause have a limitation for let say 1 set of orders during 1 h candle)?

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Hi Sashasan, Boy, you've been busy. This is great. I've been pulling teeth with another project. Glad to see the fruits of your labor are being born. Re: limit to trades per candle. Wouldn't using the pending order function protect against getting in again after a move had played out? Live micro today GBPUSD FXDD automatic.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Hi GB, What settings are you currently using? I have been tresting a few different settings because I am a little concerned that the 140 pip SL is far too excessive. My preference at the moment is to take 3 trades manually with the TP's set at 22, 28, 35 with the SL set at 80 and Trailing stops for trades 2 and 3 at 15 and 20.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Hi sashasan What parameter ys better FastTrailing=true o FastTrailing=false? Regards, Mr. Juliusss

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Are there any stats on using this in Manual vs Auto mode? I have have been doing great in manual, but with work schedules, cannot watch much. Has it been doing well in Auto mode as well?

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Hi VEEDUB. Nice name. As i stated on a previous post my settings are 22 26 28 with a stop loss of 140 as Geoff has tested for best results. I have been using the auto mode the last few days. Some times I trade with only 2 trades and then I use 22 28.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Woke up this morning with 4 winners. 2 with Geof,s EA and 2 with Sasha. Thank you both for developing a system that actually works.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
I would Identify that Option as following: "Limited_Order_Spread" = False/True If true (Additional Menu Items / Properties) "Limited_order_2" = 20 (specifying distance from the original Market order #1) "Limited_order_3" = 40 If True (Then "pendingOpenStep" should be disabled) If "Limited_Order_Spread" = False then Limited Buy Orders placed as they are now based on "pendingOpenStep" Option.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Hi sashasan I have a question for you. Can you help me? Why many times the EA open one trade? and another times open two or three? Thanks, Mr. Juliusss

--- 帖子 #546 ---
it opens a number of trades which you set up in the OpenOrders value

--- 帖子 #547 ---
I have set OpenOrders=3, but sometimes open one or two.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
with v4.x?

--- 帖子 #549 ---
v4.1 is in live, but in demo is good.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Hello! To Sashasan: Can you add a new function? So The EA sets ONLY ONCE market order (orders) for the duration of the signal ENTER TRADE NOW , and then the system would be waiting the next signal ( ENTER TRADE NOW ). Now this: If the EA has established market order (orders) when the signal appeared ENTER TRADE NOW, that when a TP, EA once again set the market order during this ENTER TRADE NOW.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
you have to look for journal tab if orders were not opened it shlould have error record written so give me the error code # and i will see

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Sasha I have tried changing the moving averages in the EA and it does not seem to have an effect on the operation. Are the moving averages of 10 and 197 hard coded in the EA or should changing the moving average period on the EA change results? Thanks and as always - I admire you patience and your ability with code... T...

--- 帖子 #553 ---
so you think if you choose OpenOrders = 1 ea will do something different from what you describe? i mean it could be if market moves very fast, opens an order, closes it and if all this happened during the same m5 candle (when fractals situation is still the same), it could enter again, but in real situation i dont remember this to be a usual case also, you can manipulate it with ManualMode = true and press No on the pop up box before open a new (duplicate) trade

--- 帖子 #554 ---
did you try to play with it in the old indicator version? i just copied all the code from old indicator file

--- 帖子 #555 ---
For manual mode all good It is necessary for the automatic mode and markets orders (PlaceMarketOrder=TRUE) For example, If I set TP = 10, for one phase "ENTER TRADE NOW" I see a few deals, but need only one (the first).

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Sasha, after trying out v4.2 I found that "place buy or sell script v3.5" does not work on this version. Are you gonna put out new buy/sell script v4.2? And one more suggestion if possible - to allow user to put in price for limit orders. Thanks. Richard

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Richard, thanks ! i will put limit/stop orders in settings message the old scripts do not work and looks like we will not need them at all if will have so many entry options with stop/limit/market limit options

--- 帖子 #558 ---
It is very important, since the next (duplicate) trade may be detrimental.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
well i will try will see

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Sasha, please stay focus Too much useless questions again.. We need this EA to be simple as possible... #1 Original Geo Trigger Method (Fractals) #2 Buy/Sell Stop Orders Options (with trailing) #3 Or Buy/Sell Limit spread Options (No trailing) And concentrate on Testing for a while to identify bugs, if any..

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Sasha, you are right for automatic mode, but I think your scripts are still necessary for manual users to enter without consolidation of the indicators. Thanks a lot for this fantastic EA. Richard

--- 帖子 #562 ---
has anyone made some pips today I've had 3 trade opportunities but bailed on all 3 seams the bears are eating at gu

caught few London open. Am riding out the retracing. entered manual by mistake, wanted to set pending...

--- 帖子 #564 ---
yeah i mean unfortunately i cannot add all the features because sooner later it will get in conflict with each other and there will be very hard (or impossible) to discover the logical overcoming interferes sorry guys, i need at least a majority of people to collaborate for new features and get it in

--- 帖子 #565 ---
i will do that later, no prob

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Im agree with you Skyzer, please Sasha doesn't go in too many directions... Simplest is often the best!

--- 帖子 #567 ---
I think that's ok, to simplify things we could do 2 versions 1 buy_stops only and 1 Buy_limit_spread Can even run both on 2 different charts!

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Hi sashasan No there are error messages. Thanks,

--- 帖子 #569 ---
I did just now! Running Buy Limit version with orders 40 pips below got triggered and TP just hit P.S: I think in RANGE trading Buy/SELL_Limit will do better.. Buy/SELL Stop better in Strong Trend And Also another 3 sets TP hit from overnight Deep..

--- 帖子 #570 ---
I do not see a buy limit setting. Where are you getting this?

--- 帖子 #571 ---
forgot to say - not all the features will work if trade was opened by a script, this is a problem.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
I see. How about a "Execute Now:True/False" in the setting itself, do you think that'll work? Thanks. Richard

--- 帖子 #573 ---
... and what this will do?

--- 帖子 #574 ---
To enter the orders specified in the preset right away in stead of waiting for the alignment of the indicators in Geoff's Manual Setup v3.5. This is to replace the buy/sell scripts. Correction: It was meant to be "Execute Buy or Sell". Richard

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Sasha, we can do just one thing at a time. Definitely, we do not want to have too many fuctions in such a short time to conflict one another. As matter of fact, this is already the best EA that I have known. Thanks. Richard

--- 帖子 #576 ---
just uploaded v4.4 with a couple of minor changes (hide/show setting message and show type of order - LIMIT or STOP) sky's new mixed entry will be in the next version

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Me too. Thanks, Sky for speaking up.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
jive, i agree, it's very inconvenient, but we have just boolean variables to choose from if we need to enter a double value (market/pending, limit/stop etc) so here you have to choose PlaceStopOrder = false (what means it will be not stop but limit)

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Ee, super!

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Here is Another one:

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Thank you, Sasha

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Thank you. To be able to choose stop or limit for pending order is excellent feature.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Wow! That's fast. Will trying it out. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Hi Sasha and Sky, Lots of suggestions here, I would like to share some of mine to see if it can help improve the great ea. - As Sky mentioned Limit for range and Stop for trend, is it possible to identify by some kinds of indicators? so ea can suggest going for whether Limit or Stop trade is more suitable... - From GMT17:00 to GMT22:00, the spread of broker increases and volatility of all pairs decreases, is it a good idea to add a function that avoid this ea enters market in user-specified time frame if it's in auto? - Lots/Risk Calculation similar to original Geoff's ea (I think it's final step after Limits/Stop trade functions done) Thanks again for all your great effort! Cheers, Gary

--- 帖子 #589 ---
i don't want to discourage you, but since you will get a couple of full losses, you will have left a small part of it. like the backtest for may 2010 - after a first week it increased the balance on 3 times, but at the end of month was in a hard profit

Hello! your EA work in tester on history data or work onlu realtime quotes? Thanks for answer

--- 帖子 #592 ---
I am quite sure about it... This is the reason I am only on demo accounts!! Anyway, I have tested all robots in the forum and no one have a tenth of your result in this period. I am all default, except for the automatic mode. I don´t know why, but everytime I try to make a backtest I get a lot of missing matches volumes and other errors, so I am doing a WF observation... Let´s see the results in the end of this month!! Regards Doc

--- 帖子 #593 ---
for now i can only say - the best option is "fast" trailing (since we have no a new mixed one yet), and if you will have to watch the market carefully and change takeprofits to 1 pips or 0 when it will take positions straightly against the trend (or open cover positions to decrease a full 140 pips loss), you might get some not bad results. in many cases, if position opens and first takeprofit was not reached, cable has an opportunity to return and at least touch the initial open price, so here you have to change it. in rarely happened cases, when market rapidly moves opposite and gets to stop loss nothing you can do. keep in mind, all the brokers use different servers for demo and real accounts and usually it's easier to trade on demo, what the brokers themselves told me. so the best way to prove it is to put it on live account on tiny lot size

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Is this using Buy Stop or Limited Buy option?? === I'd guess no one else trying BUY limit except me at the moment.. === Sasha, that Buy_Limit_Spread will make a difference, because sometimes pair never moves down let's say 40-50 pips to fill those Limited buys.. I think limited buy/sell "spread" should perform well.. P.S Please don't mix everything together.. Let the Human EYE to decide is this a trend or range.. Up to this day "Trend is my friend" doomsters still have no idea what trend means, cause for every Time Frame there is different Trend and so different friend as well.. Most traders are following the TREND and yet 95% of them losing money. Cause trend DON'T MATTER, if you are placing your bets on 20-50 pips movements.. IMHO. By the way (BTW) My limited buy missed entry by few pips... This won't happened with "Limited_Buy_Spread"

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Yep.. But unfortunately there are a lot of concerns for transfering money to a foreign institutuion from my country... I am thinking about all the possibilities to do that!

--- 帖子 #596 ---
anyway, if you will transfer, do not use american brokers they are short on fractals

--- 帖子 #597 ---
i like the idea but still a little bit unclear how to use it, i mean how to switch between 3 different types of orders place... for this moment i just see that "fast" trailing going much better than "slow"

--- 帖子 #598 ---
I agree keep it simple when you think about it all you are doing ( and I don't mean to be flipiant) is setting some trading rules on entry and exits. I am having good success with it as it is and trading only one pair has reduced my risk heaps. great work but don't over create

--- 帖子 #599 ---
I was told to use ECN brokers... which brokers would you indicate to me?

--- 帖子 #600 ---
As I indicate earlier (maybe you miss that post) we can go by 2 Versions (For now). One strictly for Buy/Sell Stop and the other for Limited Buy/Sell spread orders... Basically trader can create 1 template with Buy stop EA on and 2nd template with Limit Orders EA... As for my opinion there will be much more occasions when Limit Orders can be utilize.. So? don't complicate 1 EA by utilizing all the methods in ONE... 2 simple EA's should do better... As for me, since Limited Buy Spread EA will take 1st Order at MARKET (Execute Immediately) I don't think I would use Buy Stop at all... Cause I will have either get 1st order in profit or get all 3 at better Entry price (In case pair decide to deep after Trade signal has been generated) IMHO. P.S: NO TRAILING needed for Limited Buy/Sell version, since first order placed as soon as Entry signal gets triggered.

--- 帖子 #601 ---
sky, i understand all this, but think it can be all-in-one, what you think?

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Yes, could be.. Just need to eliminate that trailing Buy Limit (previous version) and think how we can possibly utilize both methods in one EA without complicating things... Lets take our time and think about architecture of events, to make it clear and smooth.. We can do it... No hurry.. P.S. Let me know, if you approach to some kind of a problem..

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Hi Sash, Can I firstly say that the effort you are putting into this EA is tremendous and appreciated by all. I just wanted to ask if you could put the EA name in the comments field when the order is taken out. Thanks again Jav

--- 帖子 #604 ---
you mean order open time for each of three of orders on pop up box?

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Hi Sash, When the original Tokyo EA entered a trade the comments field was populated with the name of the EA. see the attached image It would be useful to have a similar comment in the trade on entry Thanks Jav

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Sash I have just returned from the land of nod and see you have v4.4. You are amazing. Thanks so very much for your efforts. DocJordan, my results from yesterday show a similar result to yours - I am using 4 pairs where you appear to be using 6. Something happened on the way to the bank!! Sashasan dropped by!! Is this the holy grail or what? This EA is working so well. I would like to suggest that we all work with what we have and try and see if tweeking the settings can improve the results and stop asking Sash to continually alter the code. Suggestions on fine tuning based on forward testing would be welcome I'm sure. I am not a great fan of backtesting even with 90% data. Karl

--- 帖子 #607 ---
ok, no prob

--- 帖子 #608 ---
New to the thread, just wanted to say Thanks for all your hard work. I have just started a couple of days ago finding the TOKO H1 V16 ea and it works well except for the big dd, in back test, so now I find your thread and I want to learn how to prefect your strategy, Some questions, how do you personaly trade this system,does this systems works both manuel and auto,correct? Which time fram is the best for this system, Is there a manuel ,so I stop asking you all these questions?I have the system running correctly on gbp/usd, on FXDD, just need some screen time to get use to it. Just trying to learn. Thanks in Advance fishman356

--- 帖子 #609 ---
yeaaaa.... that is someting .... many times (manual trade) I came to the screen and see the popup: long alert/signal buy etc .. no info about time (when it was triggered or quotation ...) to see how old is the popup.... it will be good ... also, personaly I use market orders, and the popup still announce "+20 pips from bid/ask price" for your consideration... respect,

--- 帖子 #610 ---
ok, i did not so i missed it. will add/remove it to/from the pop up box

--- 帖子 #611 ---
just added v4.5, with new modifications

--- 帖子 #612 ---
thank you! respect!

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Ohh, man... How about that... Either babysit your trades on manual mode, or switch it to Auto.. By asking for modifications, every time you think it should or Shouldn't display this or that, - valuable programming time spending on less important things.. Stay on MANUAL trade mode ONLY while you can watch your trades .. And if you can't, - either switch EA OFF. OR, let it trade on AUTO mode and don't bother, - OK???? Period. P.S. Sasha, let's concentrate on main concept... Let's not run this thread into "What, Where, When" - Russian program, you know what I mean

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Sky. You are the only one with common sense. So many changes I cannot keep up. I am using v4.

--- 帖子 #615 ---
I like pending orders so I can watch the trade direction. I then can add a manual trade waiting for the pending to trigger if I am pretty sure of the direction of the trade. Nothing fancy but it works for me.

--- 帖子 #616 ---
I still using Ver 3.5 and still can get some pips from them. but still keep download the new EA Ver 4.5 and put it on ibfx with small lot. the last EA 4.1 option for Limit Order trigerred and gain some pips from it. but still prefer the pending stop orders because i use automatic mode. keep it running everday 24/7 on my old pc.....

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Agree I use the EA as an entry and then manage from there on I do this on my live account

--- 帖子 #618 ---
sashasan many thank yous for your clever creative coding I have 4.2 on Live GoMarkets Set to 3 trades, Set to Auto, Set to Market Orders, Set to ECN only 2 trades opened, yet no Error message in Journal this is only feed back as I am very grateful for your generous sharing

--- 帖子 #619 ---
sky, one more, actually last question - this setup will work only with 3 orders or with 2 also (1 market and 1 limit)?

--- 帖子 #620 ---
I am trying to find the best one for Auto Mode,,, have 3.3 and 3.8... Missed 3.5. Can you attach? Setting for Auto&gt; Thanks

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Yes, of course.. 1 limit also should do it.. First Market Order get's triggered right away, and we have (For example) LimitSpreadOrder1 = 20 LimitSpreadOrder2 =0 (means only 2 orders total ) You know, like in Original Geo EA.. (TakeProfit1/2/3 defined) P.S But IMHO why averaging down with only 1 order? Better have 3-4 or even 5 positions and lower LOT SIZE instead... Let's have 3 orders minimum for this setup... Why not? If this is too much for some traders, one should lower the lot size instead, that's all.. The Idea is to get best averaged price.

--- 帖子 #622 ---
let me do first 3 orders version and after test we will see if there will be a need to add new positions

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Hi sashasan What's the TrailingStop for TP1? Regards, Mr. Juliuss

--- 帖子 #624 ---
there is no trailing stop for order 1

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Auto Mode just set the ShowAlert = False Attched is the Ver 3.5

--- 帖子 #626 ---
The area of code I see as interesting to expand, is SL options. ATR ? count back x Bars ? Support/Resistance Levels 1.5900 1.5950 1.600 One Question: How long after a Trade is complete will a new trade open ? is there a time delay ?

--- 帖子 #627 ---
still have post of cable which is in open position.

--- 帖子 #628 ---
FF police closed Geoff down. Not pretty..

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Just wake up to profits again with Limited Buy Version.. Now looks like no new trades for a while, very narrow range..

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Hi Sasha. I noticed that when the active trades are closed (manually or automatically) that the EA still thinks there is a trade open and does not trigger any more. I have had to reset the chart to get it working again. See the attached as an example. In this case I manually closed all three trades but the EA still thinks Trade 2 is active and shows the ticket number. I've noticed the same when the trades close automatically (hitting SL or TP). Cheers. Z

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Thanks for putting that in Sash

--- 帖子 #632 ---
hello every 1 and thanx for sharing this,any body tested any of these versions in real account? bec. i see that its very good,or may be any advice regarding to my point,thanx

--- 帖子 #633 ---
limited buy is very good strategy.. thanks for making your secrets of success known...

--- 帖子 #634 ---
What version did you use for these results? I noticed you took 2 trades on some pairs, 3 trades on others. How did you decide that? Thanks

--- 帖子 #635 ---
You're welcome.. And thanks to GEO and Sasha.. As far as GEO triggering strategy based on Fractals will work, Buy limit version should outperform original Geo EA

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Sky, You're doing a wonderful job in keeping this thing on track and it looks like it will be dynamite. Thank you. Sasha is a jewel and you are too, to be doing all this. You'll need to give instructions though to several who don't understand what you are doing when it comes to limit orders...... Not everyone understands limit orders. s

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Thank you I'll post example, when Cable start moving.. So far I have wonderful "Picasso" shot of Cable FIB levels I was posting earlier.. It's amaze me all the time how this works in 80% cases.. Look How cable touch 61.8 FIB and start retracing back? Besides I draw those FIB levels like few days back

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Do you draw the fibs or do you have an indi? I have been using the RN-grid but I like the looks of yours.

--- 帖子 #639 ---
It is all automatic. Some pairs have hitted the primary target, so ther are just 2 orders left. All trades are openned with 3 buys or sells, acording with the robot default.

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Hi Sky, I have read your posts but as I am a little bit new on forex (I just trade index), I have some difficult to follow some of your concepts. eould you mind sharing with us how is your setup with the current version of the EA? Regards Doc

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #642 ---
SKY. Hope you are right still in 2 buy trades at 1.59653

--- 帖子 #643 ---
So on BE level. If 2nd position is 0 then you just rely on TP to kick in or you go to stop. Position 3, If BR level is 10, then that stop will go to BE after 10m pips profit?

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Gerry, since when? when I woke up this morning "No Trades Expected" was displaying already.. When your EA trigger those Buys? 20 hours ago? There is no concern about longer term trend.. Donkey Dollar is dead and heading to 70 or lower on Index..

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Yes, I draw those Fibs manually..

--- 帖子 #646 ---
I have same EA as you are.. Concepts are based on GEO's TOKYO EA original strategy, Assuming it's still working, nothing to really share.. Instead of grabbing all 3 orders at ones we are trying to get them in spread (lower if possible to average down /lower overall entry price) in case of Buy Limit strategy.

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Hey Sashasan and anyone else I have tried to load the V4.5 But it saves as a php file attachment I have tried to write them name as it appears on the website as an ex file as well but it will not show up in my files list all the other have saved fine any ideas Cheers for any advice

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Try downloading it fro the paper clip on the right hand corner of post#1.

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Sanhuis you know I have said it before but I will say it again You are a LEGEND Works perfectly

--- 帖子 #650 ---
One last question: are you running it 24/7? If not, what time are you loading it? Regards Doc

--- 帖子 #651 ---
Sash I have just loaded 4.5 and notice the option to switch off the messages. Thank you for that. Now I can see the candles!! You are so obliging and it is appreciated. Maybe when this EA gives me sufficient profit, I can afford another computer but in the meanwhile, I will have to suffer multi charts on one screen. It is very simple to max a chart for closer scrutiny. Karl

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Yes, 24/7 on GBPUSD..

--- 帖子 #653 ---
The grey box that show up, i am not sure what it is suppose to show or do. I have read the whole thread and been trading with geoff for two months live with great success. I just started to trade your EA live today. My setting I changed are magic numbers, manual trade=false so it will trade auto, place market order=true. This EA is going great. Please dont get banned Crazy about Geoff, he is such a nice guy. Sashasan keep up the good work and will try to follow. I have been trading forex three years now and new to working with these great EAs all of you are working on. I am trying to follow along while this thread is moving so fast. I'm sure I will have a lot more ?s and while I learn more I will try to contribute more. Keep up the good work

--- 帖子 #654 ---
cable still open position from 4:31am 4.8.2010 at price 1.5961 triggered by automatic mode (place by stop order) for EA 3.5 and EA4.5. there is resistance level area 1.5960. i just keep it open position until it kick out by the system or gain profit. we'll see the result today. yesterday i was kicked out by SL on GJ. after all the current position close, i will use EA ver 4.5 option Buy Limit.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
Just made my first trade with your system, had it set up on 6 pairs , had a manual trade on usd/chf, which is still pending, no price movement, and on gbp/jpy, 3 - buys manual set orders and they all were positive , for $254.60, $46.34, and $11.58. It look as it was heading south , then made turn for profit. Only problem , still testing on a demo. Thanks Sash and Sky for the info you have posted. I like the lower settings for in an out, or a ranging market.

--- 帖子 #656 ---
SKyzerFX.... you're bright and VERY competitive. You're also very arrogant and I would not trust you with $1.57 US You seek to demean those who seek to learn. That makes you much less. To call you brilliant is egregious. The brilliant will lead the fool until the fool has naught. I will never make a great politician. most humble regards, TR

--- 帖子 #657 ---
SashaSan a question about M5 &amp; M15 FractalsLockedBar if I change this to 4, so 4 Bars to confirm Fractal more Bars more likely to find a confirming Fractal ? and Less Bars less likely to get a Trade confirmation signal ?

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Sasha, Limited Buy gets placed.. Strange as EA indicates "No Trade Expected" It's still OK by me though..

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Mine did no entered in any trades yet

--- 帖子 #660 ---
What broker and what set-up are you currently running. Main item that I am asking about is have you modified the EA settings at all or are you cruising forward with the defaults?

--- 帖子 #661 ---
What's your settings?

--- 帖子 #662 ---
what's the mean MovePendingOrder?

--- 帖子 #663 ---
What just happened 75 -80 pip drop no news events just another wierd question if and when does the EA give a sell signal, it's still giving me buy signals?? Do the MA's have to corss for this to happen?

--- 帖子 #664 ---
the open position kick out by stop loss.

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Thank you. I'm pleased that it worked for you. s

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Yes, but if you want sell signls, go to USDCAD.

--- 帖子 #667 ---
Say what you like, but we all have come to love and appreciate Sky for who he is and when you see the selfless side of him, you know why. He has been instrumental in our lives as traders and gives of himself when ever any of us are in need of assistance. For what it's worth, we're glad he's here.

--- 帖子 #668 ---
According to Geof simple H1 which this is based on, the slope of 10 and 197 sma should be going the same direction. The 197 sma is definitely still at a steep + slope, so no shorts. Using Sky's suggestion of setting the EA with a buy limit order, I was able to absorb the drop even though I cut the SL back to 80(giving me actual stop loss of 65 with PendingOpenStep set to 15) and ended up with a winner on TP 1, 2 and 3. Ea just took another buy limit at 1.5890. Cheers

--- 帖子 #669 ---
TP1 +20, TP2 +24, TP3 +29 Limit buy again at 1.5908

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Thank you sanyhuis, for support By the way, that Trade I post earlier run into TP now another Buy limit triggered, 20 more pips and it's going to be executed Sasha, how are you? "Long time" no see.. Everything OK with coding there?

--- 帖子 #671 ---
SKY. Sasha is out of town on a family emergency. Should be back soon.

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Sky, What settings are you using on the buy/sell limit version. I have just loaded this on demo for testing. Been using the buy/sell stop so far with very good results, live but only on micro account. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #673 ---
What will happen if the buy limit is placed and go back into settings and choose buy stop and the ea now has both triggered. A buy stop and a buy limit. can the ea manage which ever one is executed no matter what the settings now are? Or if the buy stop was put in later, can it only manage the buy stop? Looks like the first order, the buy limit might just get deleted rather than get filled since the ea no longer is set to manage a buy limit. Does that sound right?

--- 帖子 #674 ---
TP hit again... wow

[quote=TradeRunner;3923138]SKyzerFX.... you're bright and VERY competitive.

--- 帖子 #676 ---
First trade live using trailing buy limits. What a genius innovation.

--- 帖子 #677 ---
I got tp1 22 tp2 25 tp3 28 SL 130 PendingOpenStep 40 ( buy limit taking 40 pips below trigger price) TSL2 TSL3 Don't matter cause They are not in use since TP is pretty tight nothing to trail there. TrailinStop 2/3 FALSE PlaceStopOrders = false (using Buy Limit ) That's about it.

--- 帖子 #678 ---
Thanks very much Sky, i'll start the testing

--- 帖子 #679 ---
[quote=SkyzerFX;3924898]I got tp1 22 tp2 25 tp3 28 SL 130 Sky 2 questions 1- how is the ratio for your lot sizes for the 3 orders+ 2- when you are looking at fibs do you look at daily only or other TF's Thanks

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Sry again about the dumb question, but when I try to optimize, I get thei message: There were 126 passes done during optimization, 126 results have been discarded as insignificant Any ideas about what could be wrong? (data, parameters, etc..) Regards Doc

what every point you are trying to optimize the range or field you are using is meaningless try a broader range

[quote=dryclean;3924922] Bro, I'm just testing on mini account, using micro lots. Mainly I'm waiting for Sasha to finish that spread Limit Orders option... 2) For Fibs I only looking to get general Idea (using Daily) This EA does have SMA 197 and SMA 10, so it should take care of the Trend things. Here is another Buy Limit, let see, if Cable will run to the Pivot again

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Sky, you are great! i never thought it's possible to come up with those results with this system! i'd say you are the forex virtuoso sorry for my disappearing, it's an emergency situation here, i will ty to work in the same schedule and hopefully will release a final version very soon. keep testing!!!

--- 帖子 #688 ---
Hi Sky and Sasha I got caught with my stop loss too wee, when you take a hit it really wipes out the profits! I think I will play around with a 2 lot setting and letting the second one run as suggested by Geoff in the original thread with the SL wider of course and using the limit buy. Are U using default setting(s) for M15FractalLockedBar, M5FractalLockedBar, and M15FractalFor2HoursOnly? (3,3,true) What do you think about an option to change the PendingOpenStep depending on time of day and does the EA need trading times option? Should there be an option for the pending order to expire after a certain amount of time has gone by? Cheers

--- 帖子 #689 ---
Sasha sure, I hope everything is well with you and your family, take your time.. I'll keep testing, thank you...

--- 帖子 #690 ---
Are you sure??? You got caught? Cause many of you guys are trading some crazy pairs and as we stated before, this strategy originally works on Cable (GBPUSD) Only. Take your own risk when you get greedy and trading it on many other pairs..

--- 帖子 #691 ---
C'mon, now there you go again! Who said anything about other pairs!!! I listed what I was trading and my SL in another post earlier! Yeah, I'm sure SKY!!!!

--- 帖子 #692 ---
Alright, well, the reason I asked cause I got this Robot on for quite few days, I don't see where you can grab 130-140 pips drop, probably with Buy Stop Version Then? Even if you look H4 or daily, hard to find a moment for 140 pips deep..

--- 帖子 #693 ---
Wrong again, limit buy. But I had 80 pip SL with 15 step. Maybe 130-140 SL and 30 step is the ultimate, but that's what demo is for, right? My point is to try a setting using trailing to gather in more pips to offset a loss, there will be a few at least. I posted a couple of trades just before you came online this morning which was naptime for me But maybe we should just let you do all testing......Ha, just joking friend Cheers

--- 帖子 #694 ---
I have to say I've been fairly impressed with the results of the EA so far, I ran V4.0 last week and some of this week, until I noticed v4.5 was out. Anyway, testing out v4.5 now with the limit order option to see how that shakes out. Keep up the good work, its much appreciated.

--- 帖子 #695 ---
well, well, well, Reading from page #1 original GEO EA" "The SL is large at 140 per order but anything less gives more losing trades, if you are not comfortable with 140 stoploss then your lot size is too high and should be reduced to a level where you are comfortable." P.S Basically we are duplicating Original EA strategy, which means 130-140 SL is a must.

--- 帖子 #696 ---
But you left out the 1st sentence: I prefer to place 2 orders with half the lot size, first order to close at +22 when TP1 is reached move the second order SL to BE and let it run. Yes I've read it many times, but Geoff also uses trailing to gather in the large gains. Hmmmm, didn't I read a post earlier with you expressing doubts about such a large stop loss? Maybe I dreamed it Maybe I'll go with that but nothing wrong with testing for better results...... Cheers

--- 帖子 #697 ---
Those "large gains" will happens very rare.. 80 pip TP will probably reached 1-2 times a year I run backtests.. 3 Orders with like 22-25-29 will give you 70 pips and that a lot... when you going to have like 22 -50-80, most of the times only first TP will be reached and others bailout at TSL... But of course, you can do whatever you want, cause it's your money..

I had pending buy orders on the Cable going into current Dead Zone , so I went ahead and canceled those orders. My take on it anyways..... EA current reading is NO TRADES EXPECTED. Usually won't expect anything till around Tokyo. Looking at the SMAs, still gotta expect Longs....

--- 帖子 #703 ---
Sky I am interested in your results which bear little resemblance to mine over the past 24 hours. Your chart is quite different also. I am using the tpl suggested with the sma settings etc but the plot of your sma looks quite different. What settings are you using? The chart settings presumably make no difference to the bot so it doesn't matter. What is of concern is that you have had nice results when I have been in the doldrums with trades being carried along for extended times sitting in losing positions. Its difficult yo read the chart detail, but is the chart posted a M15 TF? I too appreciate your comments and your sometimes cutting wit. Keep it up. Karl

We must be looking at a trend down soon the dow is having trouble breaking 10700 and ranging, unemployment looks likley to be bad and the sheep will flow back to the dollar.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Thanks Fishman - will try them. I still don't think they affect the EA though - do they? Karl

--- 帖子 #707 ---
There is no trend down.. Could be some retrace from highs, but Dollar on the way down, nothing has been changed.. Looking for swing possibility to fill out both Buy limit and Take profit.. For those who ask, yes I have EA placed on M15 TF: And don't pay much attention to Indies on my chart, I have about gazillion Templates and just happens to load this one, nothing special.. P.S. Also, I do running original Tokyo V16 and it says "No Trade" for today, have no Idea why this one displayed: "Enter Trade Now". Maybe cause Original one looking at 23 GMT fractals only, and Sasha's modification comparing those fractals every hour, - good enough for me.. Looking at that setup below, - I do have valid shot for tonight

--- 帖子 #708 ---
COOL I am trying the buy limit way I have three trades set to go at 1.58381 on Alpari and 1.5842 on Fxdd and that is something I was going to say diffreent brokers slightly different entery . Will be interested to see how it goes. SkyzerFZ do you also place a buy stop trade? or just stick to limits as I am getting enter trade alerts coming up? No visable sharp instruments in the room I hope.

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Buy Stop Needs a Trend (strong trend) , in the range there is more use for Buy Limit.

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Yep and thats where we are just now Why are you so Bullish on the Cable when there is still alot of hurt out in the market. I mean I hope you are right but HMmmm If it breaks 10700 would be great as you say the NFP may help to retrace again then off Attached Image

I just entered my first live trade and have problem/question with TP. Pending order showed them correctly: 18,55,200. When trade was entered the trade window shows all tp's at 200? And when I try to adjust each one manually, it adjusts all 3 orders and will not let me adjust each one to a diferent price... I will include shot.

I used trailing buy limit. Better not to use trailing. Got me in too high. Now I am in the trade forever and little underwater... If I had taken the original buy limit no trailing, then I would be in 1st take profit and stop above break even. Let's see if we get a bounce at some point... Close and yet so far away...

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Buy limit opened at 1.58698 a couple hours after Tokyo open, TP1, 2, and 3 hit for 72 pips. I didn't follow the EA protocol to the T. Late during New York session with Buy Limit orders pending, + getting the No Trades Expected message, I canceled the pending orders. Not sure what the Skyzer would have to say about that I am also adjusting my SL and PendingOpenStep slightly different for Tokyo vs. London, NY session. Cheers

--- 帖子 #715 ---
Hmm mine are still pending set at 1.58411 almost 30 pips below your what are your settings??

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Mine was about that too.....like I said i canceled those orders and let the EA do it's thing after Tokyo open....how long are you holding those pending orders? And I'm not saying one way is better than other.....still playing with this. Cheers

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Ahhh I have gone back to buy stop as we seem to be going back to a bullish trend missed two sets of trades today with limits. I hope

--- 帖子 #718 ---
Maybe the EA could be fixed to calculate the best setting based on what the market is doing.... Better to miss a trade than lose one, with limit you are getting great value.

--- 帖子 #719 ---
I could be mistaken, but doesn't using "MovePendingOrder=True" move the Buy/Sell Limit entry? It certainly appears to on my IBFX demo. If so there "should" be no reason to delete pending orders. Yeah, Ronald Raygun is working on a similar concept in his Teaching Old Dogs New Tricks Thread. He's attempting to design an EA that auto backtest's itself with every new bar to determine the best of two strategies to use at the moment; Its not a bad concept.

--- 帖子 #720 ---
YEP what I have done is save the settings for limit orders and pretty much the original buy stop orders.. Tonight before I go to bed I will load the limit order EA as I think NFP will be bad and Cable will drop and then rebound as there is some strength in it still and hopefully catch the rebound then see what happens. I am pretty strong on following the Dow (see earlier post) as the pound follows it very closely so if dow ternds load buy stop EA if it ranges load limit Ea hope this makes sense on my third wine and everything looks great about now anyway

--- 帖子 #721 ---
I think buy limit is not working for me too. No trades after setted it:

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Buy limit is trailing up to the ReverseMove point ( I have it set to 80) if FastTrailing=true. If pair moves up 80 pips and Buy Limit not getting triggered, then Pending orders will be canceled. Besides if you want Buy Limit to be hit earlier Decrease PendingOpenStep settings

--- 帖子 #723 ---
I'm making alot of money with this EA..thanks guys..this is fun!

--- 帖子 #724 ---
I guess your roller coaster ride is over???

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Sky I was disapointed by your post I was waiting for your comments on the tanking dollar lol

--- 帖子 #726 ---
Yes, it is unless another auto trade comes in. About 10-15 minutes before original Tuesday long trade hit TPs, an auto trade long on GU was triggered so both hit my +22,+24,+26 targets within minutes of each other. Fun! Of course, had to wait 3 days for first ..still

--- 帖子 #727 ---
Yeah, Dullah get whacked today..

--- 帖子 #728 ---
LOL http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/dollar.gif

--- 帖子 #729 ---
EJ, GU, and EU just triggered long..so I'm back on the roller coaster again, will probably be in these trades over the weekend. Is anyone else auto trading these pairs?

--- 帖子 #730 ---
SKY. Trying 4.5 with buy limit orders. Strange to see the price above the entry point and not be able to cash in the pips. Don't know if I like this. Will wait and see.

--- 帖子 #731 ---
I would like to see trading times added to the EA, don't really want the weekend carry. Cheers and Happy Weekend * Only had one loss and this was when I shortened the stop loss. Very promising EA, will consider a live account with a few more parameters added.

--- 帖子 #732 ---
Hi Would you be so kind as to share your Settings, the pairs your trading, and the time frame. I'm having mixed results I think I'm probably trading too many pairs with the wrong settings. Thanks in advance for your help!!!

--- 帖子 #733 ---
hi guys, sorry again, i am still in process of limited work here, hopefully will upload a new version today. thanks

--- 帖子 #734 ---
Gerry.. We only testing for now ok?? New version will trigger 1 order right on the spot (Market) and 2 others will be placed at limit 20/40 pips below for an example.. So? If pair never goes down you still be cashing at least 1 order, and if it does goes down, you'll be able to average your trade and get better Entry price, compare to Original Geo Tokyo, where all orders just placed at Market..

--- 帖子 #735 ---
SKY. Sounds like a great idea.

--- 帖子 #736 ---
Thanks again for the updated ea , had some nice wins today, just like lawgirl posted, had a gu trade open from earier this week that with another made a double win, 2 wins on eur usd, and 1 - win on usd chf.and 1- win on gbp jpy Still not sure of all the options but learning. My latest version of the ea resets itself to defalt settings after a win/ loss. is it suppose to do that? fishman356

--- 帖子 #737 ---
Sasha, been trying it on fxcm vps and found stop/limit orders all work well. Thanks. But as I said before, Delete Pending script is needed for apparent reason and Place Stop/Limit scripts are needed for entering trades manually. Anyway, take your time, as the progress of improving/adding new functions is already amazingly fast. Richard

--- 帖子 #738 ---
One more thing worth mentioning - stop and limit orders should be able to work together simultaneously without any conflicts by putting the EA on 2 separate/different charts with different Magic No. as per Sky's suggestion, once the scripts are in place. Good job, Sasha. Richard

--- 帖子 #739 ---
I am. GU and EU. What are you doing with EJ?

--- 帖子 #740 ---
What about using one broker for the strategy? Getting on the same page so to speak. Just wondering. Same settings, currency pairs, after usual testing. misterpipster

--- 帖子 #741 ---
I just started using this in the last couple of days (v3.8 and now 4.5), so do not have a good feel yet -- have had more wins than losses so far, so thats good. Using automatic mode, so no comment on the various manual mode issues. Questions: 1)What is the gray rectangular box that sometimes shows up on the candle chart? Does it provide any useful guidence on what is going on? 2)How to best close a trade that it is managing -- either close a trade in the works or delete pending trades. I seem to have had inconsistant results when I cancel them manually. 3) Does this work reliably with the MT4 back tester? -- note, I don't mean "Is backtesting reliable?", I just mean does this EA have any quirks that would cause it to not work properly given the data (of questionalble reliablity) available? Thanks to sashasan , Geoff, and all the kibitzers who have been helping to tweak this!

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Hi Sashan I am pretty sure I am having a problem with stuck ticket numbers in V4.5. The attached chart is for GU with V4.5 EA loaded. It had Buy Limit orders which were then cancelled automatically becuase the price moved more than the configured limit. However you can see that the EA still displays three ticket numbers and will not take another trade as long as these numbers are present. Is anyone else having this issue? Z

--- 帖子 #743 ---
I'm in the boat with ya sort-of. Long orders on gu, eu. short on uj, haven't played with the ej is it better as that might be the next pair that I should add. Don't like spanning the weekend but that appears to be the direction that I am going to get to go.

--- 帖子 #744 ---
Weekends are risky, that's for sure. I have EU and GU open long and currently in the negative over the weekend. Could spike up at opening on Sunday or head further down, but long term trend is long so unless there is a spike down to our 140 SL, we'll be ok.

--- 帖子 #745 ---
Good day and trade! Please, could you send to me the GEOFF's Manual Setup v3.5 (Indicator) in .mq4. I cannot find it now Thx!

--- 帖子 #746 ---
sky, do we delete limit orders if first market order is closed by take profit but they did not trigger? also, the second limit order is placed 40 pips below/above 1st market open price or below/above a first limit order which is already lower/upper on 20 pips from 1 market?

--- 帖子 #747 ---
anyway, did by this way. testing...

--- 帖子 #748 ---
Zr-fx, i tried to model the same situation and visually compare using your settings - M5 time frame, ea settings and etc. ok, i got 3 buy limit orders opened and activated - you say ea deleted this??? it's impossible with any settings you will choose ... in this market condition, either type of pending order will be triggered because of the price swing ... anyway i need Journal records to see what's going on

--- 帖子 #749 ---
later on, will add a very as i think useful feature - ability to change a take profit of the first order to a smaller value if price will just touch it and go opposite (its going to be a 2 settings set - new take profit value and bars number after ea should check for this modification). there are many cases in history when pending orders get activated and later on ho back and after some time return but do not reach the first take profit value again and get the full stop loss instead, so if turn on this feature after lets say 4-5 hours and change it to lets say 10 pips, many of stoplosses will be avoided

--- 帖子 #750 ---
Sounds Great, Can't wait to test the new version. fishman356

--- 帖子 #751 ---
Yep I was also going to change my limit entery point to 20 pips instead of 40 I would have had more trades and wins. I was going to trade NFP and would have done well but bottled out as it was friday night here and have learnt not to drink and trade

--- 帖子 #752 ---
Take a look at Geoff's thread, he and Pip are supposedly working on an 8 hr or variable second profit level. Effectively if your profit hasn't hit within a set period of time the EA drops the profit to a lower value maybe 1-5 pips. Looking at the detailed back test on Tokyo I think this wipes out all of the losses that system incurred. Now what I don't know as I don't have the EA is if this took out any of the runners that he had as well making big profits.

--- 帖子 #753 ---
Remember that the set-up has to go in Indicators, while the EA goes to Experts. Hope this helps. 3.5 is still my favorite.

--- 帖子 #754 ---
Sasha. Thank you for replying. I looked at the journal and found it a bit of a mess because I had the EA on GU and EU so it is very difficult to decipher. Also found some memory errors. So it is best that I put it on GU only for a few days after resetting everything and see. However, I thought that the pending orders will be deleted if the price moves more that the configured number of pips (100 by default)? Is this not correct? Thanks again for this great EA and the fantastic support. Z

--- 帖子 #755 ---
Sasha, Sorry, was checking forum few times no one was here, so I'm replying late... We placing for example 3 orders, 1 Market and 2 limits IF, NONE of limit orders get triggered and Market Order Hit TP, both Limit orders should be canceled and we wait for the next setup. If First Limit Order Get triggered and Both Market And First Limit Order Hit TP Second Limit Order get canceled thank you.

--- 帖子 #756 ---
Those parameters should be specified by user, Lets say LimitOrder1 =20 LimitOrder2 =40 by default. TP and SL should be calculated from Market order #1 P.S Next time when we talk examples lets only talk about Buy Limit case (assuming Sell limit will working the same way) P.S.S We need to test this.. If for Limit orders going to get hard to reach TP since they are 20-40 pips away + TP We could calculate TP for any order from ENTRY PRICE, To get profit earlier.. &lt;== OR we might just lower BuyLimit1=10 BuyLimit2=20 We just have to Test it first and see how it goes..

--- 帖子 #757 ---
To avoid this you have to simply lower your TP 2 / TP 3 As we recommended here 22-25-28 or so, should work and if you get greedy then you can setup 22-50-80.. By backtesting Geo's Tokyo Original those settings doesn't appear to be generating larger profits, as 80% of the time 50 pip TP never get reached and Order gets bailout at 22 TSL which at the end will be even lower then our 25 pip TP2 (without TSL). Same goes for TP3. Got it?

--- 帖子 #758 ---
btw i removed 1 order option since looks like nobody uses this so far

--- 帖子 #759 ---
Yeap, good Idea..

--- 帖子 #760 ---
Well the brokers are getting smarter Just opened here in NZ I run two accounts one on Alpari and one on FXDD Alpari closes and opens an hour after FXDD. Just before close last week Alpari GBP/USD dropped to 1.5928 and FXDD stayed at 1.5965. At the open today FXDD has not moved and 11 mintues into the day it has dropped to 1.5960 and bounced up. So if you on Alpari get ready to put in a buy right on the open. Also I notice around news event the spread is getting rediculous and even the MT4 platform goes off line, anyway happy trading this week guys

--- 帖子 #761 ---
ok guys, just posted a new version, which i tested during last couple of days have a couple of more ideas to feed, but will wait for now it might looks difficult to set up but this is the only way what we have in Mt4 right now hopefully IFBX will approve MT5 in the near future and it will be much easier to manage complex options and settings

--- 帖子 #762 ---
Thank you, Sasha I'll start testing as soon my current order gets closed..

--- 帖子 #763 ---
Hi sashasa Great work, congratulations!!! Regards, Mr. Juliusss

--- 帖子 #764 ---
Could you fresh my memory? The pending orders expire at some point, under what conditions?

--- 帖子 #765 ---
Sashasan, Could you post a pdf file explaining each of the input settings on post #1. It's getting a bit difficult to follow. That way when you add something new it could be all in one place. Thanks for your support!

--- 帖子 #766 ---
What's the best TF for the EA.

--- 帖子 #767 ---
Great Job, you are one hell of a programmer,and fast, now all the test will begin. Again congratulation on a project well done. fishman356

--- 帖子 #768 ---
That's a lot of work , maybe someone else could pitch in and produce a .pdf. Maybe someone that needs or wants such a doc could take the time to put it together as that would be a great learning tool as well. I am quiet sure Sashasan has more pressing things to do . Now That would be good support.... considering all the time and effort Sashasan is already giving to everyone here.... Thanks for YOUR support.....

--- 帖子 #769 ---
that would be great

--- 帖子 #770 ---
ea will calculate the entry based on H1 no matter what time frame you will put it on

--- 帖子 #771 ---
if market goes opposite, they will be trailed back until will reach the "expiration price" which is ReverseMove value set up in pips (so you opened buy stop at 1.55000, market goes down, if ReverseMove = 100 pips and order will reach 1.54000 and will not triggered, it will be deleted)

--- 帖子 #772 ---
The take profit adjust hour is suppose to sell the first open order taken at the number of hours that the trader set in the ea, correct. So I typed in 3 hours and backtested, so it should have sold the position on a 15 min chart at 12 - 15 min bars, instead it went down to hit the sl of 140. Is this the way this setting works? This feature is suppose to control the amount of dd,Correct?

--- 帖子 #773 ---
btw, since these versions have no anything in common with Tokyo setup anymore it will be renamed to GEOFFs MTFSM Setup (Multi Timeframe Fractals and Simple Movings Setup) from next version

--- 帖子 #774 ---
yes, you should see expiration time at the very bottom line of a message, when orders just opened, it will change take profit of a 1st order (or all, it depends on settings chosen) after # of hours

--- 帖子 #775 ---
I have seen this on the bottom of the message , but if the first order never went into profit and just went the oppisite way would it still work. It may have went into just a little profit, not positive. I ran a backtest and It went well past the three hours and did not sell on the first buy order. Maybe its something I am doing wrong.

--- 帖子 #776 ---
yes, because this option changes take profit of the existing orders and those orders will be closed only if a new take profit level will be reached what you are talking about is my next idea to add - it will be a pips counter which will close all opened orders when summary amount of pips is reached

--- 帖子 #777 ---
I have to learn to code this myself. Your work is splendid and I can't wait to see the timer start kicking in to potentially limit losses. Has anyone backtested to see what the appropriate amount of time should be on the change, 5 hrs, 8 hrs, 2 hrs (:-).

--- 帖子 #778 ---
Thanks , still confussed but I will figure it out. It only been a few hours.

--- 帖子 #779 ---
This ea is very profitable, the problem that needs to be corrected is the draw down, we know the ea needs that 140 to breath, if we had some kind of % indicator of holding the position or like you said install a collective pip counter to end the dd before the stop loss. I ran a set of numbers of tp 15,17,22 with a sl of 60 it ran very profitable for a good while until a series of dd , made me look for new settings , I think the 22,25,28, tp is great , but the profits are not big enough to cover the 140 dd. What your ea needs is some testing time and maybe one or two more features, that will decrease the dd , maybe you have already have sovled this problem with the new features, to eary to tell. Great Job.

--- 帖子 #780 ---
ok, this is why i need someone to write a pdf here is an example from the previous page backtest with 1 market and 2 limit orders : Attached Image (click to enlarge) orders opened at 2010/1/4/ at 12:00 (so the time when take profit has to be changed is 17:00), after 2 buy limit orders became buy (records 27 and 28 - what really does not matter buy it or limit buy) records 29-31 show modification of the take profit of all 3 orders to 10 pips at 17:00 to a new take profit value 1.62318 since order open price was 1.62218

--- 帖子 #781 ---
Cuddlebum that is a good idea. I am sill not sure what some of the setting do. i have mine set on market order true, ut not sure if that doesnt let limit order work ? I am running it on auto also (manual trade = false). kepp up the good work everyone. I havent lost any money so far

--- 帖子 #782 ---
Skyzer thankyou for all your testing and great input. I'm tying to follow what you have to say, but it gets confusing at times. More trading and learning a little more everyday. happy trading

--- 帖子 #783 ---
i would but dont know that much about EAs and dont want to make a mistake sorry

--- 帖子 #784 ---
I know what it is a Portable Document Format, but that's about all I know. I will try and look into it.

--- 帖子 #785 ---
Viva Sashasan!!! v4.6 - added option to allow enter a market only once during 1 hour candle (there are many cases in backtest when second or third enter is ends up with loss after a first which is in profit) This`s a very nice parameter! Big THX!

--- 帖子 #786 ---
Big thanks, Master of MQL! 1) v4.6 - added option to allow enter a market only once during 1 hour candle (there are many cases in backtest when second or third enter is ends up with loss after a first which is in profit) With the yielded function results it is much better! Whether it is possible to make a choice? (...only once during 1 hour candle ...) Not only one hour, for example, parameter in EA: AllowOnlyOneEnterPer X Hours = X (X=1 or 2 or 3 etc.) 2)Also it would be interesting to add new function. Time module. Time, when ЕА can establish orders. Base time=Terminal time. for example, parameter in EA: TradeHour0-1=true/false TradeHour1-2=true/false TradeHour2-3=true/false and etc. till 24 o'clock. The given function it is possible to filter an installation time of orders. It will give the chance to us to work only at certain o'clock. Very important function. Sorry for my bad english. Once again I want to thank SASHASAN!

--- 帖子 #787 ---
Hi guys! Sashasan!Good day `n trade! Can you make new changes? Now: If a signal Enter Trade Now, the EA puts market orders . - ok! These market orders seeking their TP or SL . - ok! While the market orders in the process ( seeking their TP or SL), the EA does not set new market orders, although the new signal Enter Trade Now received - NOT ok!, because they miss the deals, until the market orders seeking their TP or SL. This can be seen when the SL and TP will exhibit a large. The EA supports only one full trade operation

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Do I understand this correctly to mean? - example: Long market order triggered at 1.5900 (easy round number) Market moves lower to 1. 58 60 (-40) - First limit order triggered at 1.58 80 - Second limit order triggered at 1.58 60 (Sky's recommendation of buying at -20 pips and -40 pips when market moves against us) Now suppose we had set the pips counter at 36. When market goes back up to 1.5892 (+32 from the low point) all three trades are closed out giving a net +36 pips (-8, +12 and +32) and we are done for the trade. I think this is an exceptionally good idea . Many thanks to Geoff, Sash, Sky and all others for your hard work on this. Once this is incorporated into the ea we could go back and optimize for the best increment (20 pips in the example above) to use for the limit orders.

--- 帖子 #789 ---
Hi everyone, Was not monitoring the thread fro last 2 days and found already 4 versions have been released. Shashan you are an excellent and thanks a lot fro sharing your hard work... Much appreciated... Regards Velli

--- 帖子 #790 ---
I'm still trying to figure out why we need this at all..????? Orders must either hit TP or SL, - That' it.. NO timeout BS.. There always going to be risk if you want make a profit, we already limit risk by placing orders in spread so total number of pips at SL will be lower than 3 * 140, nothing else needed. I believe that timeout "idea" was picked up from original Geo thread?

--- 帖子 #791 ---
Here is a beginning PDF. It will need to be edited, updated by someone

--- 帖子 #792 ---
Thanks for your efforts , I will pass along any good backtest results.

--- 帖子 #793 ---
Beautiful start to the PDF, TradeRunner.

--- 帖子 #794 ---
Looking good, Traderunner. Thanks so much. What a help this is!

--- 帖子 #795 ---
Your effort is appreciated, TradeRunner.

--- 帖子 #796 ---
well, i can do that, as well as many other interesting stuff, but if you will do backtest you will see that there is not a big difference if you will change hour enter allowance to one or more hours. see the example of jan 4 2010 - even if you will create enter market = once per 3 hours you will get this huge loss. dont really understand about the second option you described...

--- 帖子 #797 ---
yes, this is absolutely correct, but here you will have to set up pips amount and hours after which this mode will be activated, otherwise it will close any trade right away and open another one. i see it as follows (as i used it in one other ea) : you have opened set of orders, lets say 1 market and 2 limits, after a while limits got triggered, market goes opposite and at some period of time returned back to profit, so here this mode will be activated. but how to give the ea decide when this mode will be turned on???

--- 帖子 #798 ---
no, i did not visit the original thread for a long time, this idea was taken from my another robot

--- 帖子 #799 ---
TradeRunner thanks! will post it to the first page

--- 帖子 #800 ---
Thx for you response! The second option: Now, EA work 24 hours, every hour. I want to choose when EA was working (In what period of time). for example, parameter in EA: TradeHour 0am-1am=true/false (if true, EA sets market orders from 0am to 1am) TradeHour 1am-2am=true/false TradeHour 2am-3am=true/false and etc. till 24 o'clock. As a result, you can configure EA to work (sets market orders) only in specified intervals.

--- 帖子 #801 ---
ok, you mean to set up particular time periods while ea will be turned on and off? do you think it will increase the profitability? i mean usually this kind of thing is used when ea earns during active hours and looses during intersessions time

--- 帖子 #802 ---
I don´t know if I did something wrong, but got no signal today in any of the 5 pairs I use to follow. This is my setup for v5.0

--- 帖子 #803 ---
well since you have NO TRADES EXPECTED notice nothing you can do place 2 smas and fractals on the chart and will take a look

--- 帖子 #804 ---
Yes, I dare swear, modul of time periods is very important. What do you think about post 787? http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=787

--- 帖子 #805 ---
So what this actually does then? Like now my trades underwater and about 60 pips away from SL, not much we can do here, other than wait till Dollar Tanks again tomorrow afternoon, after FOMC.

--- 帖子 #806 ---
it looks like a some sort of martingale method which i dont think is appropriate here since we have a huge stops i will think about the first one - but how you will figure out which hour enter and which not? you can easily miss the trend!

--- 帖子 #807 ---
what the price did you get in? around 59800? this method is mostly for ranging markets, which i have seen a lot in backtest since jan 2010 today's case is a different one and the pips counter will save you from the deep negative (if set it up to 3 hours for example)

--- 帖子 #808 ---
Exactly that the Market Order 1 about 5980 then Limit #2 5960 And limit #3 5940 Or so, Anyway this is a big advantage compare to original EA as total SL pips would be much lower I hope SL will hold, that's my bet

--- 帖子 #809 ---
is it real money ? you should wait to get the latest version !!!

--- 帖子 #810 ---
Well this is the last version V5? Yes, real money, but micro lots, no worries here. . I made enough profit to cover few SL hits.. I'm still looking for profit.. Cable should stop dropping after NY Equity Market close.. You mean there is never version coming out?

--- 帖子 #811 ---
yes

--- 帖子 #812 ---
Ok, looking forward to test it.. I thought, everything we "dreamed" about already exists in the V5

--- 帖子 #813 ---
Same here Alpari hit targets but FXDD still going starting come back now both limit orders in play. The Dow is up so cable should follow for profits

--- 帖子 #814 ---
you should have your magics as 1 2 3 or you will get a pop up box

--- 帖子 #815 ---
Thanks for the new EA sashasan, good work you have done on it since first version Any optimized settings?

--- 帖子 #816 ---
Thanks so much for your support! I just want to be clear on the correct understanding of the inputs. Thanks again!

--- 帖子 #817 ---
Very curious, but I didn´t get any trade entrance for any pair since I have loaded V5.0. Did you get any trades today?

--- 帖子 #818 ---
Well all orders stopped out took a good about twenty hours though NOW are in a downward trend or are we just going to range about

--- 帖子 #819 ---
Thank you to Geoff, Shan, Sky and others for all the great work. On Friday I entered my first demo trade using version 4.5 at 1.59785. Was stopped out today for -140 pips X 3 just before the price bounced off the 197 SMA. Better things to come! Dick

--- 帖子 #820 ---
Good day, Sashasan! For each currency pair has its own clock optimal volatility. I want to find out. It's profitable.

--- 帖子 #821 ---
What do you think about post 787? http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=787 This is not a martingale. When the trade will be for each signal Enter Trade Now, then you can optimize the logic of the process. We skipped the transactions. Statistics distorted. The most important point: we miss the signals due to the setting of TP and SL, which relate to the previous transaction. The new transaction depends on the previous one. This is not correct. "Thin" logical time. Thank for you hard work!

--- 帖子 #822 ---
Hi Sky , Sasha and all traders. Yes, . Please see the chart below. Could you arrange few things for me please. According to paws post as below : " Originally Posted by paws http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/buttons/viewpost.gif Do I understand this correctly to mean? - example: Long market order triggered at 1.5900 (easy round number) Market moves lower to 1. 58 60 (-40) - First limit order triggered at 1.58 80 - Second limit order triggered at 1.58 60 (Sky's recommendation of buying at -20 pips and -40 pips when market moves against us) Now suppose we had set the pips counter at 36.

I know very well there is a lot of work behind any idea but I hope it is worth. Best regards. Mac.

Good day, Traders! Parameter NewOrdersTakeProfit = N Pips (5,10, etc.) is good! But better, if the system will calculate the BE level of market orders and move TP to BE (common for these market orders) Example: buy1 price 1.1000 buy2 price 1.0000 (PendingOpenStep=1000) buy3 price 0.9000 (SecondLimitPrderStep=2000) NewOrdersTakeProfit = 10 Pips =&gt; TP move after 5 Hours (TakeProfitAdjustHour=5) to 1.1010 (for all buy position) But BE level (for buy1+buy2+buy3) is 1.0000 (+Spread), no profit, no loss. ( Price quickly reach to BE level, then TP level ) So we lower the level of DrawDown.

Hi D.i.m.l. Definitely sounds good . Mac.

--- 帖子 #825 ---
We need to test something first for longer than 24 hours, to see how things are working and then say we need this or that.. There going to be loses, one way or the other, we just trying to minimize it.

--- 帖子 #826 ---
Hi Sky. Yes, I agree with you. This is just another idea and I hope worth think about in the future. Thanks. Regards Mac.

--- 帖子 #827 ---
Yeap, I just look over Geo Original v17 and Backtests are fine as you already know, so if we just add to original our buy limit/buy stop and also implement that timing thing, as Sasha mention earlier, then we should be fine.. Thanks..

--- 帖子 #828 ---
Hi SKY! Yes, but better include in Sasha`s EA "Time Modul" (choose the time of work). And to make history tests. Because Geoffs Original EA start to work only at 23 GMT. Cheers

--- 帖子 #829 ---
Sure, that's what I'm talking about

--- 帖子 #830 ---
The addition of a choice of "start time" sounds good to me for automatic mode as different pairs have slightly different hot time periods.

--- 帖子 #831 ---
guys, it's fine, but my question is still on - how you would know when to turn in on and turn it off? the idea behind this ea is non-stop pips thresh

--- 帖子 #832 ---
Mac, just wait a little bit for the 5.1, there will be more interesting feature as i think, which we called "pips counter", it will close the positions based on a summary pips profit, so 2 limit orders will simply work as a "counter-coverage" for the 1 order

--- 帖子 #833 ---
I forgot to activate Buy Stop instead of Buy Limit.. Was expecting this move.. Ohh, well, next time then..

--- 帖子 #834 ---
Sry to be asking again... no trades since I loaded v5.0 yesterday with that setup I posted. Are you getting any trades?

--- 帖子 #835 ---
Yes, I have 1 loss since Sunday (same as original Geo EA traders) And when GU shoots up after FOMC, I got quick Buy Limit activated, 1 order gets in profit in few seconds for 25 pips by canceling other 2 limit buys.. Now sign "Entry Point Expected"... Could be another trades coming up soon..

--- 帖子 #836 ---
ok guys, here is 5.1 with a new pips toy enjoy

--- 帖子 #837 ---
Loaded and running

--- 帖子 #838 ---
so it's like StartHour and EndHour while ea will work and the rest of it will not?

--- 帖子 #839 ---
Well, back testing results for original improved for 100% and that's what it says in description for new added params "Timed exit controlled via 2 new param int PositionMaxOpenHours = 7; int PositionMaxOpenHoursMinProfit = 8; // can be negative if you want to exit with a loss..." Basically it says if position open 7+ (Variable) hours and no profit, get the heck out.. P.S Was going to load new version now, but Already get trades executed, will wait till TP

--- 帖子 #840 ---
Sasha, there are some EAs where we find a TimeFilter option. So if you set it as TRUE, you determine START HOUR and END HOUR. If you set it as FALSE, it will run 24/7.

--- 帖子 #841 ---
sanyhuis, I really cannot send anything via PM, but here is the settings (attached) I'm using those settings for Sasha's EA v5.0 (sorry, didn't load v5.1 yet) Just rename *.txt to *.set But new version already Out.. ones My orders closed I'll load 5.1 Cheers

--- 帖子 #842 ---
saved it as a .set file and uploaded on first page to load the settings in, anybody has to click Load button on the Inputs tab

--- 帖子 #843 ---
Sky The new v5.1 causes a problem with your v5 set resulting in an options conflict between the Adjusttakeprofit and the Pipscounterexit. Not sure how to resolve this as I have not worked out exactly what Sash is intending here. I will just experiment and see. Karl

--- 帖子 #844 ---
either of Adjusttakeprofit and Pipscounterexit should be true, but not both in other words you cannot use those options together, because there is no reason to adjust take profit if orders will be closed when summary amount of pips will be reached

--- 帖子 #845 ---
Sky I'm really sorry for my late response. I was out off screen for a while. Yes, you are right, there are some ideas which Sasha mention earlier about. Just need be patient . Regards Mac.

--- 帖子 #846 ---
Hi Sasha. I'm sorry for my late response. Yes, I'm specially hope for all existing orders "pips counter" to calculate eventual lose/profit and place "exit level " . Great thanks anyway to YOU and all contributors. Regards Mac.

--- 帖子 #847 ---
Wow! Dear Sasha. You are fantastic and great coder. I didn't realize that, the V5.1 is already out. Many Thanks Sasha . Mac.

--- 帖子 #849 ---
Great Job" Again" Sash, can I ask a question, the pip counter , does it work for pips in profit, or loss in pips. I backteasted and tried to set it a couple of different numbers, when I know a dd was coming , just not sure how it works , but will keep trying. fishman356

--- 帖子 #850 ---
so is the counter a total exit with profir for all 3 orders? if so, say PC is 36, that 12 pip profit. doesn't this make setting the TP's obsolete?

--- 帖子 #851 ---
Hi, First i said thanks for these great trading tools. I've tried in my demo account,and potential working . But i have some confusing about the time setting. I lived in Jakarta area,please tell me about the time setting.Is it ok if i'm using ur skyv5.set? or there is some changes at the tools setting. Thanks

--- 帖子 #852 ---
ok, here is an example: lets say we have default settings : PipsCounterStartHour = 5 and PipsCounterExit = 20 first option means # of hours when this option will be activated, so lets say we opened a set of orders at 17:00, so after 5 hours, 22:00, if orders will be still opened, this option will start to work. second option means a average number of pips for all opened orders. so, lets say we opened a set of orders from 1 market and 2 limits, after some time those limits got activated - each of them (since the open price is for each one is different) has a different amount of pips in balance, lets say we are in big minus now and 1st buy has - 50 pips (if Open Price is 1.4550 and ask is 1.4500), so 2 buy has - 30 pips (if open price is 1.4530) and 3 buy has -10 pips (if its price is 1.4490). what this option does is it calculates average amount of pips for all opened orders (-50 + -30 + -10 /3 = -30) and compares this value with the PipsCounterExit. in this case it will do nothing since this pips amount is less than defined in PipsCounterExit. lets say, after some time market reversed up and finally reached a price of 1.4520, in this case average balance of 3 orders will be -30 + -10 + 30 /3 = -3.33 pips, PipsCounterExit will still do nothing. but later on, market goes up again and gets a price of 1,4545, in this case we have -5 + 15 + 55 / 3 = 21.66 so a little bit before this price all 3 orders will be closed because average amount of pips (21.66) is greater than 20 which we have set up PipsCounterExit. ok this example will work if we have equal lot sizes, but if we have different lots, calculations will be also different, proportionally with the lot sizes. in the previous example we devided summary amount of pips by 3 because we thought all of them are equal and like 33.33%. but, make a little change. lets say we have lot 1 = 1.0, lot = 0.5 and lot = 0.1. in this case we will need to do a more difficult math because 1 lot will be 62.5%, lot 2 = 31.25% and lot 3 = 6.25%, finally with all the calculations we will need a little higher price because the first lot will "overweight" 2 others (too lazy to calculate the exact value, sorry ) ok, but here are some important things. sometimes, when a lots ratio is really big (lets say lot 1 is 1.0 (83.33%), lot 2 is 0.1 (8.33%) and lot 3 is 0.1 (8.33%)) a positive amount of pips does not mean the positive summary balance of opened positions in our account's currency , so on backtests i saw situations when PipsCounterExit was more then 20 pips, but total balance for opened positions was still negative, in this case PipsCounterExit will close orders when pips average value will be greater than 20 and total balance will become positive (actually, here it will be closed at 0.01$ of total as a first positive value after 0.00$). also, you obviously understand, if you will set up here a negative average pips value (lets say -10), it will close all the orders when this average pips amount will be reached, and it still would be a good choice comparing to a full loss of 3 x 140 pips. hope this helps

--- 帖子 #853 ---
yes understand. missed the part that this wouldn't activate until "x" hours, so if market takes off in our direction all tp's and trails, etc still good until this start hour hit . Thanks so much. Will try to set up some forward tests on alternate markets this weekend. Peace sasha

--- 帖子 #854 ---
Sash - thanks for your explanation of the pipscounterexit. Your examples helped to understand. Karl

--- 帖子 #855 ---
It is a very good strategy, now we Know the basics, it will take a little screen time , and again finding the correct "Combination" of tp,sl,etc. Trying to succeed, is never a failure. I was doing a lot of backtesting with smaller take profits, 15,17,22, and had alot more trades, your in and out most of the time with a profit, but the drawdown were bad when they hit, now with this new feature, I am hoping but not sure if it will work with this small amount of profit, and if not I will try with larger tp. There has to be a pattern, find the pattern we find the answer. Sash, you do know what you are doing and as you said " When You will reach the Top of the Mountain, Continue to" Clamber= to climb, using both feet and hands; climb with effort or difficulty," up further. We will get it right. You do some fine work. Always fishman356

--- 帖子 #856 ---
well, this option, as well as adjust profit, was developed for ranging market times when orders triggered and far from take profit and not in deep minus at the same time. if you will set the hours # to 2 for example and get a trend move with at least 2 orders triggered, positions will be closed before order 1 take profit will be reached because average pips amount will be more than 20 earlier than 1st take profit, which is 20 too

--- 帖子 #857 ---
also, forgot to mention, positive pips average and negative total orders balance will also happen if orders will be placed too far from each other, for example if to place the 3rd order to 60-80 pips away from first two

--- 帖子 #858 ---
Sky, Appreciate it very much. s

Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here is a chart and of the last buy trade, white ma = 10 , red ma = 197, light blue ma = 560, the blue box and red arrow indicates were the buy should have been a sell. I know this ea works off of mas and fractals, maybe it needs a third ma to conform direction. Only a suggestion.

--- 帖子 #860 ---
Yeah, mine hit SL too. AS far as I can see on your Screen 197MA is pointed down, not sure why EA take that trade..

--- 帖子 #861 ---
Sasha Check this out. I have indy "Ema_Angle_Bar_Open" Basically it's showing which direction specified EMA is pointed and displaying bars like MACD.. Perhaps we can change code from EMA to SMA and used to Identify SMA 197 direction.. Take a look

--- 帖子 #862 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here is why, the ea is looking at the H1 chart, but it still should have only have taken a short trade, white ma thru red ma. I think this ea is great, it just needs to get the bugs out, if Sash is using the original ea from Geoff , that ea has to be placed on a H1 chart at a spcific time period, correct? With different time frams you need more ma's / fractrals to confirm. I know sash said the ma and fracturals are built into different time frams, but maybe we are missing something. fishman356

Hi Sky. It is good idea with 3 x SMA(close) which I've been running for years manually without significant results, but I never use before instruments us we've got right now. That can be big potential improvement to select correct direction signal. Mac.

--- 帖子 #865 ---
I woke up this morning with another 3 X 140 pip loss, this time on V5.0 with order method 4 on auto. The problem, of course is that the 197 SMA can point up for days on the H1 chart while price declines. The EA can enter on retracements just in time for price to go down again. In this situation, use of limit buy orders seems to make it worse. If this situation appears to be happening, possibly trading should be limited to manual entries and only when the 197 is in the correct direction on the M15 or M30. Or a 49 SMA or 99 SMA on the H1 could be a filter. I am down (demo) 6 X 140 for the week. Unusual, I know.

--- 帖子 #866 ---
ok, what i will do later on, i will add a log file to this ea and you will see that the calculations of sma's and fractals are. btw, earlier i always used to do it, it's really easier to keep track of what is going on.

--- 帖子 #867 ---
also, regrading losses - i just recently added a new option, DoNotEnterInTheCloseHour, its similar to the AllowOnlyOneEnterPerHour, since my backtest experience shows that if a new trade entered in the hour of recently closed orders, it's a big possibility to get this trade failed. if this one will be set to true, ea will not open a trade in the same hour when recent order(s) was closed. so, i used limit orders (OrderPlacementCode = 3), 15 pips take profit 1 and DoNotEnterInTheCloseHour = true and could finally avoid losses on aug 9th and 10th, except a trade around 20:00

--- 帖子 #868 ---
Strange thing is that, GEO v17 original just trigger SELL orders and I don't see any sings of trade here..

--- 帖子 #869 ---
Hello Sashasan I like the DoNotEnterInTheCloseHour idea would it be possible to have it variable? set to 1 hour or 2 hours etc

--- 帖子 #870 ---
A question: I have TP 2 and TP 3 set at different levels 26 and 32 yet the EA is placing both at 26, and it has done it twice now is there a setting that I need to change ? or ? OrderPlacementCode = 1

--- 帖子 #871 ---
I'm loosing patience with this method. It's seems that it always selling bottoms and buying tops. 3 more SELLS executed earlier and now cable going up.. Sasha It possible to write scripts so we can manually drop Scripts on the Chart. Let EA run and just signal Entry and human to decide either take Buy or Sell.. Heck, I'm closing Sells, before I lose whole 140 pips again..

--- 帖子 #872 ---
Well, I suggested it many times before...... As I found that in many occasions, waiting for the fractals formation missed the better entry time especially in today's fast moving market. And that causes the negative turn before tp1 gets hit sometimes even right after the trades get triggered.

--- 帖子 #873 ---
It took 3 days for the H1 197 SMA to roll over after the price turned down. The result was losing buy entries in a down trend. Possible rule: Turn the EA off when the 10 SMA crosses the 197 SMA until the 197 turns the same direction as the cross. Possible rule: Put a 98 SMA on the chart. Turn the EA off when the 10 SMA crosses the 98 SMA until the 197 SMA turns in the direction of the cross. Possible rule: Turn the EA off when the direction of the 98 SMA and 197 SMA disagree until the 197 catches up. The sell trades have started adding some pips back into the rather sad looking demo account.

--- 帖子 #874 ---
Hi Sashasan Please, can you add the following parameters: - Set Hours = on, off (When the parameter Set Hours=ON, the EA work the 24hours else work between StartHour and EndHour) - StartHour - EndHour Thanks in advance, Mr. Juliusss

--- 帖子 #875 ---
I simply think this theory don' t work other than in Tokyo or London open time.. I'll run Geo latest version prior London open and see how it goes in backtest.. And by the way, while GEO took trades last night, out version does not for some unknown reason.. Of course maybe a broker difference as well..

--- 帖子 #876 ---
would you suggest some other one?

--- 帖子 #877 ---
so, close the thread?

--- 帖子 #878 ---
Or keep it open to the rest of us who are interested in develop the EA? I think we had a beautiful start on July, with the market climbing the upper bands... for now, we are having some down movements and it is natural that untill a new trend is defined, losses are goning to happen more often... Lets keep trying!

--- 帖子 #879 ---
Don't close the thread, You have made a lot of progress in your develement of this new and improved ea, Give it some time.

--- 帖子 #880 ---
NO, Sasha, plz, don't.. You did tremendous job here.. We going to figure out something.. Just need to keep testing still, no matter what..

--- 帖子 #881 ---
Hi Sashasan Don't close the thread, you're a good programmer and can do great things with your support. I did backtesting and the best results was for parameter OrderPlacementCode=2 and another parameters default. Regards, Mr. Juliusss

--- 帖子 #882 ---
We have to focus on how to get the ea to change buy and sell signals in the 15 min tf, maybe its in the coding between the 5 min and 15 min tf? Would the ea preform different if it was coded from the 30 min , or H1 ,to the 15 min tf? Just a idea. Maybe by adding another ma to confirm ea direction, from my earlyer screen shot , there should have been all sell signals from the 560 ma cross , and we would have had two more wins. "Take a break", catch your breath, then come back, but don't give up. fishman356 I also agree with yurijap, Order Placement code # 2, was the best results, also I notice once in a while when an order was triggered and the price reversed with in the first to candles , if we had a sell all open orders feature after a -40 to 50 pip drop on 1- 15 min candle, maybe we could stay out of the big dd. I have not back tested this much but, the price seems to keep going down. Just another thought.

--- 帖子 #883 ---
Hi Sashasan how do I send a private message? Regards, Mr. Juliusss

--- 帖子 #884 ---
please send again, i just cleaned it up a little

--- 帖子 #885 ---
Please don't close this thread! As I said before, this is one of the best EAs that I have known and tried. As matter of fact, I'm still a 100% v3.8 trader and a very happy one! Anyhow, I can not and will not rely on any EA to trade 100% for me until an almost perfect filtering system is developed, and until then, I believe that human brain is still better in making discretional &amp; critical judgments on the timing of entry (that is the name of the game). But, once the trades are entered, this EA is much much better and more efficient to manage them for us. You have done a fantastic work so far which we all appreciate and admire. Please go on.

--- 帖子 #886 ---
It appears that everyone is having the same problems. GU has been behaving like my dog - not doing anything its told and running in the opposite direction when called!! Perhaps we could be totally contrarian and take the opposite position to that suggested by the EA. It seems that as soon as a trade is taken, the position moves into loss even for trades that finish up winners. Maybe a quick scalp of 10-20 pips at the outset might prove profitable. http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif Just joking - I haven't even looked at this idea!! But Sash, hang in there. With the talented people contributing to this thread, there is an answer. No system can be 100% successful and losses are part of the game. The trick is to minimise the losses so that the end result is a worthwhile profit.

--- 帖子 #887 ---
Sasha and all, Maybe I am trying to make this too simplistic, but the problem to me is that whenever the market changes from trending to ranging, ranging to trending or just retraces for a bit, (140 pips minimum) we take a loss. Since it takes 4 -5 -6 -7 or more profitable trades to make up for the one loss, the account balance is going to go up and down like a yo yo. Even worse, the market reacts differently in different times of the year, different days of the week even different hours of the day. People have been trying for years to create an EA that you can set and forget - without success. Here is a thought, can we make the moving averages, along with the period variable so that they are input variables? Currently the moving averages are fixed at 197 and 10, one hour time frame, which work great when the market is trending, but when the market trend ends and it goes into a ranging or retracing phase, the EA takes a loss. What if we were able to change them to different numbers for different market conditions? Maybe ranging on a 1 hour time frame currently means a loss or no trades. But the same set of characteristics on a 5 minute might still be profitable. It would take a lot of testing, but I believe we would have enough people testing that we would be able to identify the optimum combination of moving averages, time frame and SL/TP that would work for any particular market condition. Then the idea would be to identify the market for that particular day - week - month or whatever. Maybe we could even focus less on the "exotic" options trying to make everything work with the "holy" 10 - 197 MA in a one hour time frame and focus on a combination that will work with whatever is happening in the market right now. Input everyone please... T...

--- 帖子 #888 ---
I like your thinking but it will take some time and effort, to optimize this ea, we need a group effort and to be able to share settings and results. Sash has put to much into this effort to quit now. He as the knowledge to make this work.

Sahasan; One of the benefits of a PDF is being able to have a "frequently asked questions" section. Answer "FAQ" questions only once in the PDF and if no one wants to read the PDF, then "screw 'em." On the other hand, I for one, could not blame you for abandoning the thread entirely. You have done an amazing job regardless of the outcome and you must be one of the most patient people that I could imagine.

How is everyone, I am still trying a bunch of different numbers, and this ea does work, it needs a final touch to control the dd , the time pip counter that Sash created ,will I am not having much luck with it, There is a way some how to control this dd, we just have to keep on pushing ahead, and maybe Sash will return with a new outlook. maybe he is haveing some personal issues, who knows, I have email him with no response. I vote to keep the thread "Alive and Well", here is my numbers that I tried,at different time frams, sometimes real good , the longer back not so good. tp,15,17,22,, sl 140 ts, 10,15 pend open step = 33, 25 op code = 2 ot option = 2 reverse mode =60 I believe all else defalt Try these numbers , and maybe you could modify them to become profitable. Good Trading

Thanks fishman. I will try these numbers. This ea certainly looks promising. I too hope that Sashasan and Skyzer return.

--- 帖子 #908 ---
I think many good money with this EA. The last v I did not try but all before that were good, to say the least. Thank you all for staying on. Hopefully Sash will be back. He knows we need him and maybe we can be a bit more thoughtful of him in the future. I'll certainly try, if given the chance.

I have been running GEOFFs MTFSM Setup v5.1.ex4 on a demo account. I previously reported losses of 140 X 6 on an earlier version. The first 140 X 3 loss was unavoidable as all signs were that it was a good trade but there was a trend change that the EA could not detect. The second loss of 140 X 3 was avoidable. The prices were obviously headed down but the 197 SMA was still headed up. The result was that the EA kept buying counter trend and it kept losing. My $10240 demo account plummeted to about $7000. Code that would allow trades only if some shorter SMA was in agreement would have prevented this. So I decided to define a trend as a situation where the 49 SMA and the 99 SMA are pointing in the same direction as the 197. I keep the EA on an H1 chart and only allow it to trade when all three agree. If the three SMAs do not agree, I turn the EA off. Since August 16 there have been 27 trades (9 X 3) and all were winners except for a $13 loss caused by my manually closing a trade. The account is now at over $10800. I think this EA deserves more interest. - Dick

Could you post your setting? This could be a great ea, it just needs a little more time to get it right.

For Alpari US Demo Attached is an excel file with all my trades with the manual system it started around 08-12 with different version around 8-19 i started with the 5.1 current version I'm trading many pairs here and you can see which work the best GU for sure I have 2 tabs at the bottom the all trades has the expired or deleted ones Most of these trades were automatic the earlier ones were manual most are placement code 4 with mostly default settings I also upped the lot size from .01 to .1 ect.... but it ts the pips that count I also upped my set file as a text file I may go live back to the .01 .02 .04 settings I'm also testing placement code 2 but don't have the numbers yet The only bad thing about this is in the US I can't close a trade before the 1st one. At times the 1st trade is negative and the 3rd is in profit because of the pending orders so I at times have closed them both, the bottom line was the basket was profitable US is also looking into basically doing away with forex http://blogs.forbes.com/greatspecula...forex-traders/ Sky maybe you can help me open an account in Russia LOL

Thanks for sharing your numbers, I will give it a try with the added ma. Are you still just useing the 10, 197 in the ea, with the 49,99, as visuals? fishman356

--- 帖子 #920 ---
Yes. If I knew how I would add these filters to the EA. I just turn it off when the 49 and/or 99 are not sloped the same direction as the 197. This will not work when the trend changes as it takes a while for the 49 to turn so there was another 140 X 3 loss as gu headed north again. - Dick

--- 帖子 #921 ---
Hello Sasha, Dr. Loyd, and fishman 356, and gang. How about if the 10 sma crossed the 49 sma on the close, that we turned the e.a. to sell only or buy only (whichever way it is going)? I don't know what to do yet. Just tinkering. Anyone have any new ideas, or old ones? Thanks. misterpipster

--- 帖子 #922 ---
hi guys, just added 2 more sma's to the ea, you can set up a period in the pop up menu. did not test it, have no idea what will come up

--- 帖子 #923 ---
Nice to see you back, you have a good ea here and it just needs a finishing touch. Downloading the new version now and starting to test. Thanks for keeping this thread alive. fishman356

awesome development sashasan!

--- 帖子 #930 ---
There may be a error in the ea , every trade it takes have been all profit sell orders, any one else having this problem,

--- 帖子 #931 ---
I am still running it on a demo account 24/7

--- 帖子 #932 ---
That could help. On the other hand, the losing 140 X 3 trade this week was entered while the 197, 99, 49 and 10 were all pointing down, about three hours before the price headed up and about 4 hours before the 10 SMA turned up. The only way we can prevent all losses is by not entering trades. Or a 2000 pip stop loss might do it. I still think this ea can be a winner over time if we turn it off when the SMAs do not agree, like right now. Dick

--- 帖子 #933 ---
hi sashasan thanks for big idea... why my EA is not active?

--- 帖子 #934 ---
i thought after 5 yrs of trading and downloading bunches of ea but i need some one to tell mehow to get this setup into my ea file and on my chart. thank s to any one that can help. or direct me to the post that shows how to do that

--- 帖子 #935 ---
Thats gr8. Can you please post the set file. Thanks,

--- 帖子 #936 ---
Download the ea to your broker , and place in the experts folder, make sure you have the broker application closed. Then open up your broker trading platform, open up a chart of gbp usd, drag the MTFSM v5.3 ea onto the chart, open up THE Common file," check" enable alerts, allow live trading, allow dll imports, and allow imports of external experts Click on inputs tab, change all three magic # by at least one last number, check the settings you want, change the ECN if you need to, IBFX needed to be set to true. I like the order placment code 2 for trading, and do a backtest, you may have to change the settings as above once you are in the stratgy tester mode . It is a brand new version , so all the past setting work somwhat, you need to find the correct sma to get the ea to buy and sell. You may want to change the start and end hour to 0-23 and give the ea more time to trade in st mode, you may have periods of no trading because of lining up all the sma. Hope this helps . fishman356

--- 帖子 #937 ---
look jj look at post 925, you can mak the set file, but it not good enough, all the trades were short orders.

--- 帖子 #938 ---
it work that time

--- 帖子 #939 ---
Thank you Sashasan for this great EA and the two additional SMAs. Now if we can just figure out how best to use it. The first goal is to prevent excessive losses. Hmm. On the 24th, the 10, 24, 49, 98 and 197 were all headed down and spread out nicely. But the price turned up. A 2 SMA might have prevented that 3 X 140 loss. We do want to prevent a losing trade right when the trend changes if possible. So one goal is to stop the EA from trading the wrong way as soon as possible after a trend change. A 2 SMA might keep us out until the 10 turns. The 10 turns back on retracements which could trigger losing trades. A 15 might keep us out until a 24 takes over. It took a few hours for the 10 to turn up. It took a day for the 24 to turn up. It took two days for the 49 to turn up and another half a day for the 98. The 197 never did turn up so no buy trades have been possible in the last few days. If we wanted the ea to be able to buy in the 2 day up move this week, the 197 is way too slow. But if we want to trade with longer term trends, the 197 should stay. This can result in several days without trades. Yesterday the 49 prevented selling. A good thing in view of those pin bars? Replacing the 49 with a 15 would have allowed trading yesterday. The 15 would do a better job of preventing trading sooner after a trend change than the 49. A goal is to have SMAs that will keep us from trading until either the new trend is established with a change of direction of the 197 or until the price movement goes back in the same direction as the 197 again. Let's see. 2, 5, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35... no wait, we can't do that. Hmm. 2, 10, 15, 197? - Dick

--- 帖子 #940 ---
i just think that 197 is too large period, it goes one direction for couple weeks, after turned opposite, goes another way the same long time

--- 帖子 #941 ---
Alex. Try it with a 140 EMA.

--- 帖子 #942 ---
Hello to all; This EA has great potential and with all the superior coding skills that has gone into it, it would be a shame to see it fall by the wayside. All that is needed (IMHO) are some minor adjustments to the SMA settings AND an option that would allow the EA to close all trades (or pending) IF the 2 SMA crosses back above/below the 8 SMA (I will illustrate that reasoning shortly). In a very short period of time, this EA has granted me a substantial number of "green pips" and had I been allowing it to trade on something other than microlots I would be pleased. ALTHOUGH, I will admit that there has not been enough time for too many of the inevitable losses to occur. On this small test I set the SMA's (initially) to 2,8,16,22. The results were good but the entries were late and could have been much better. I think the better SMA settings are closer to 2,8,12,14. Perhaps it's all better with illustration so I will do so.... beginning with a GBP/CAD chart that was up +179 pips but then lost 175 pips. This is the best example of why there needs to be a close option regarding 2/8 SMA. Yes... I could have closed it manually but that's hardly the point.

AUD/USD in positive pips but if the 2 SMA moves above the 8 SMA, will it be stopped out?

--- 帖子 #952 ---
That's it.... A better trade was NZD/USD with SMA settings of 2.8.12.14. Well... maybe better.... it all ended quick and in positive pips. At any rate... I'm not sure the EA will take long positions as I have been waiting on USD/CAD (mostly) to see. And I'm not sure the programmer has any interest in the EA anymore. So.... I rest my case. Good day to all.

--- 帖子 #953 ---
Good work TraderRunner.

--- 帖子 #954 ---
You were a little quick on your assumption Sashasan has commented in the middle of your thread. he input that he will put the 2 over 8 cross as a close point. We will then need to test to see if it eliminates the losses. If it does this EA may be about perfect.

--- 帖子 #955 ---
My Good Fellow; I don't believe that I have been quick to assume anything (makes an ass of u &amp; me). I was simply posting, not reading replies. I have followed this thread for a LONG time and I have the deepest respect for Sashasan. If you would like to carry this conversation further I will be more than happy to accommodate you. If not, I have nothing further to say at this moment. Regards

Thanks for sharing your results, and you are correct, if sash can make the order close on the cross ,this would be a positive, and I am also having a time with the ea taking a long order, maybe sash , when he has some time, to look at this again. fishman356

I have been trading this EA for about a month now and i'm wero profit now. There is so many options now im not sure what is best. I was wondering what others have there properties set and what they think will work the best. Thankyou all for keeping this great ea and thread going.

--- 帖子 #960 ---
Hi Fishman, thank you for your work on this thread. The 197 SMA has been angled down for two weeks. So if I understand correctly, long trades would have been impossible during that time. - Dick

--- 帖子 #961 ---
Yes , you are correct, but I have been backtesting some time back, and I still cannot get a buy trade, maybe something I am doing wrong.

--- 帖子 #962 ---
First of all i want to congratulate sashasan and Geoff for this great EA. That said, i've been testing this version of the original Geoffs EA, and found something strange, apparently, whe AllowOnlyOneEnterPerHour is set to false, no trades are generated. Is this supposed to hapen? I am using a FXDD live account, and here is an example of the what i mean. The annex is with the AllowOnlyOneEnterPerHour set to true. when i set it to false, maintaining everything else, no trade is made for the same period.

--- 帖子 #963 ---
I have IBFX and cant seem to get much history from them for back testing. Where is everyone getting all there history for a year, 1 minute history i believe. thank you

Well my auto trade on the pound did great today, made 110, 50 and 20 pips. I am using version 4.5 still because I cant figure out the more recent versions and what options to use. I was wondering what others are using, what settings ? I am also using EA on yen and euro. I hope we can keep this EA going here, I believe you all have put so much work into it so far, I don't want to see it die out. I know I haven't put to much input into it, i been trading forex for 3 years, but i'm very new to working with EAs and still learning a lot. I hope everyone is doing good.

This version has never triggered any trades for me when all the SMAs in agreement and both fractals formed. I've never brought it up as I think that Sasha has long given up on this thread.

Hi. It is covering 13 M5 candles ( 1 hour period of time) where the set of fractals came from; """" -- original system description this is a Tokyo session breakout system, it uses 2 smas - 10 and 197, and 2 sets of fractals, from M15 and M5, to enter a trade, which must be made between 23:00 and 0:00 by GMT."""" In this version this set can came from every hour around the clock. Please see post #1. or I'm wrong ..then sorry . Regards Mac.

--- 帖子 #974 ---
Sorry I did not do this sooner, but I ran a test for 2010 this morning and I see what you mean. Whenever the 197 points up it stops trading. It will draw the fractal dots on the chart, but it always says: M5 ^ NOT CALCULATED M15 ^ NOT CALCULATED So it can't trade. Of the 462 trades, it won 87%, but it did not quite make money for the year. Getting close though. Dick

--- 帖子 #975 ---
I tried SMAs 400, 197, 49, 10. Testing data from 2010, the 10 K account more than doubled at one point and ended up with $16115. 89.5% of the trades won. Still only buy trades. The PA pushes well beyond the TP much of the time.....

--- 帖子 #976 ---
Lot 1 = 1.0, TP 30 Lot 2 = .5, TP 60 Lot 3 = .1, TP 90 This reduced the win rate to 86.2% and the net result was $9326, a small loss. Still, it kept going for 9 months.

--- 帖子 #977 ---
A TP of 30 on all lots produced a win rate of 87.22% and an account of $15576.

--- 帖子 #978 ---
check out this set file 6.75% draw down over 50% increase and 100% wins about 2 trades a week for a year this is with alpari which is what brokker this was made for. play around setting for tp3 set it real high and see what happens

--- 帖子 #979 ---
Thank you, I will give it a try. I just tried TP of 50 on all three orders with my set file and the win rate was 83.2%. The account went up to over $20000 and then back down to $11175.

--- 帖子 #980 ---

My automatic trades has seemed to stop since the 17th. Anyone else on auto and got any trades since the 17th. I have been trading this system on auto since the beginning of august and it seems like it should be taking trades. I am trading pairs. eurusd, gbpusd and usdjpy. It has opened trades pretty much every day. In the last hour I thought it should have taken trade where the grayed in box was just before a spike, but it didnt take trade. I am still not sure what the gray box is suppose to be saying. Yeserday it said take trade now, but I am on automatic and I thought it should have taken the trade then, but it didn't. Anyone else haveing problem like mine or no what is going on.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
I have always used the automatic side of this ea. I am not sure how to use the manual side of it. do i turn manual setting to true and if that if it how, then how to open trade. And will it trade the same setting on the ea that i have set. Sometimes it says open trade now, but my trade doesnt open when i have it on auto. wondering why.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Anybody still running this EA?

--- 帖子 #447 ---
The EA has a bug so that it will only sell and never buy. We do not currently have a programmer active on the thread to fix that. It is is possible to make a profit with the EA even as it is.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
check the common tab on the properties of the ea and make sure it is set to long and short trades never had a problem with long or shorts

--- 帖子 #449 ---
i am out for now. i used it for a few months, made a few 1000. i cant get back test to do very good, i am with tdfx now and show good test on tokyo 17a, so well have to see how it goes. You never know whats next. Mine always traded short and long, probably what dryclean said, you need to do.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
It is set to long and short. Whenever the SMA 197 is pointing up it stops calculating the M5 and M15 fractals so there are no signals. Fishman was also unable to get it to do buy trades.
