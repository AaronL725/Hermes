I've been trading this system with some success, the Monday-Tuesday system (MoTu). My first post, time to give back to the community!
Pairs: I prefer GBP crosses. Probably any volatile pair.
Logic behind the system: The highs and lows of Monday and Tuesday often form the low or the high of the week.

Steps (see attached calculator)Find the highest high and lowest low of Monday and Tuesday. Enter it into attached calculator. Entry is set to 15% of the highest high. SL is set to 10% on the other side of the low for long; high for short. TP is set to 50% of the range. If trade doesn't open by the end of the week, delete pending orders. For example, this week on GBPUSD.Tuesday formed the high; Monday the low I set a buy order at 1.31011. SL was 1.29495 TP was 1.31617 I set a sell and a buy order on each pair. Once one order is opened, delete the other.

Buy order was opened on Wednesday and closed on Friday.

I've manually backtested it on GBPJPY, GBPUSD, GBPAUD for years and it looks good.

Attached is the Day of week indicator I found here on FF. I'd set the indicator to only show MoTu.

ProblemsIf the trend is overextended, it can enter and then get stopped out. In those cases, only consider a pullback. So, the system needs to be refined to take into account the weekly and monthly ATR. If the weekly or the monthly range is already above average, the trade may fail. If the MoTu range is too small, you may not want to set a order that week or you may increase the entry percentage. I'll try to post my trades here, once they close. Any advice would be appreciated.

Interesting approach! I will follow coming months. What I don't like is R:R. Thanks anyway. Never thought about Monday and Tuesday in this sense!

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Glad you like it, kofix11. One could try a 3:1 RR, but you'd wait to close out the trade. Or you could shorten the SL. In the calculator, just change the SL multiple to a negative number. Because I don't have an EA, I don't know if that would backtest well.

Notice below GBPUSD the previous week.

Entered long at 1.30585. TP at 1.31040, 45pips.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Interesting, have you tested it with a EA?

Regards and thanks!

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Hello man!

How long do you trade with this M-T system? Is it profitable for you in long term ? :-)

Thanks in advance for the answer!

--- 帖子 #6 ---
I haven't tested it with an EA. If someone is willing, we'd all love to see it! I'd like to be able to incorporate other ideas, also.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
To be frank, mbednarz, I haven't tested it long term. I've only been trading it this year. But the rules are clear enough and it's easy to backtest manually. It just takes a long time.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Another trade on GBPUSD. Short on the 9th at the first orange line; TP on the next orange line. 75 pips

--- 帖子 #9 ---
GBPAUD last week, 70 pips.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Manually tested January 2019; GBPUSD, GBPAUD, GBPJPY, GBPCAD
Total Pips: 961

[Just glancing at February, it's not as good for sure.]

GBPUSD: 252

Wins: 3; Losses:0 (I broke even on the final trade of that month and it went the other way.)

GBPAUD: 394

Wins: 3; Losses:0

GBPJPY: 164

Wins: 2; Losses:0

GBPCAD: 151

Wins: 3; Losses:1

GBPCHF and GBPNZD are similar.

I'm following this very interesting approach and will be testing it. Thank you for sharing!

I will try and search but their should be some type of breakout box indicator that would make things easier

It looks very simple strategy and interesting. ^^

--- 帖子 #15 ---
What do you do if trade is still open at the close on Friday? Do you carry it over the weekend?

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Im watching EURUSD and seems nice too

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Sheppy, I carry it over the weekend. Often, I've found, it TPs early in the next week.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
looks like a nice, simple system 4ecstasy, subbed. Can I ask about your trade explorer - is that a combination of this and/or other system/s?

thanks, blam

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Ha, no, I've struggled like many. That system doesn't reflect what I'm doing now. I've never actually posted much on FF, although I joined in 2013. I'm just now giving more attention to actually trading and I think this system is fairly successful. I'd love to have an EA to do some serious backtesting; I've only done manual testing.

I'm looking forward to the end of Tuesday!

--- 帖子 #20 ---
CANT FIGURE OUT THE CALCULATION CAN YOU GUIDE ME ....is it the lowest of monday and the high of tuesday?You know Monday has its own high and low  as well as Tuesday which of these do i use what i did as in the attached screenshot was i picked the high of Monday AND THE LOW OF TUESDAY i can also use the low of Monday versus the High of Tuesday But i did not arrive at your GO LONG figure. Rgds

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Slingshots1, you take whichever is the highest high. So, compare the two highs of Monday and Tuesday and ask, "Which one is higher?" Use that one.

Then ask, "Which low is lower, Monday or Tuesday?" Use that low.

On the example you're referring to, Monday was the higher high and Tuesday was the lower low.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
GBPAUD or is it the broker im using?

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Many thanks buddy and your strat is kool

--- 帖子 #24 ---
For Jan 13 and 14 of this year on the D1 for GBPAUD, I have the highest high is on Monday which is 1.89067 and the lowest low is Tuesday with 1.87652.

Is that what you have? I use Axitrader.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
I don't have a computer right now, but refer to this post of mine, pretty sure that Daily Line Boxes can be set to show the high to low of Monday and Tuesday

It does seem a little complicated; I can't get mine to load right. If you'd want to post the settings that work, that might help?

--- 帖子 #29 ---
I would like to help but I don't have a computer right now. I can only browse internet and look at Metatrader on a Samsung S10. Follow the link in Post 25, I have shown settings in that thread that should guide you.

PS, thanks for sharing this method of analysis. How many times I have read that a weekly wick is formed on Monday and Tuesday; now there's a way to define an entry and catch the move occasionally. Another thing I see all the time, don't trade on a Monday or don't trade on a Friday; this fits those criteria perfectly.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Love the simplicity.

Will forward trade the GBP crosses this week on small live account.

Love it that many are excited about it! At the end of Tuesday, let's post our thoughts on long and short.

I'd love to have an EA; I have so many ideas to test, mainly with weekly and Monthly ATR.

The following is NOT necessary for the strategy; these are just questions I have that can be answered with an EA.Should we consider a pullback on Wednesday if the monthly and/or weekly ATR range has already been achieved? What is the best Break Even, TP, and SL strategies? In an EA, I prefer to use ATR to determine position size, BE, TP, and SL. What are the maximum and minimum ranges for the real bodies and the ranges in relation to the ATR? If a pair loses its volatility on a Monday and Tuesday, does that affect the strategy? I don't know.

Questions, questions.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hello! I agree to participate in testing this strategy on a real account. Let's try to trade for 2-3 months without deviating from the initial rules? When will we discuss proposed entry points? At the opening Wednesday?

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Good going 4XTC!

For a while now, I have been trading only on daily bars, and only on the first part of the week. Later in the week my methods don't do nearly as well.

Trading very consevatively (rarely more than 0.6% per pair) I've managed to make 9% over a 5 week period. I can see where adding your method can only increase profits.

I've been going through the GU MonTue ranges, looking for risk control methods. The one that stands out so far is limiting the after entry pull back to about 80% of the 2 day range. Not trying to hijack anything, simply making observations. Perhaps you've already tried this.

Also your comments regarding extended 2 day ranges look to be a very good way to avoid non performing trades.

Thanks,

Darryl

--- 帖子 #36 ---
To help with manual and visual backtesting, the Fibonacci Tool can easily be set to show the levels.

I'm very limited on a phone, not sure how this screenshot will look. I used 0.15 for both High and Low entry, while labeling the 50% as Stop Loss

Plenty of tutorials around on how to set those levels to whatever you want.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #37 ---
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Yep. 15% entry, 65% TP.  I'm also testing 40% as a measure to move my SL.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
diamonddbw, Erebus, others...I love the thoughts, keep 'em coming!

--- 帖子 #39 ---
OK, early figures on GU going back to 27 May 2019, 36 weeks.

Losses - 2

Wins - 18 [+900%]

No trade (range over 200) - 7

Trades with entry totals - 9. for +51pips [+61%] & -124pips [-83%].

% relates to per trade numbers. i.e.: If range equals 100 pips, and trade wins, it has reached 50% of the range. One win =50%.

Losses are dependent on where you decide to place your stop. If stop is 10% beyond opposite side of range, then the loss is =125%

The pip count doesn't matter. This is all about %. Since I'm in US, I have limited broker choices. I use Oanda Proprietary platform because #1 I trust Oanda. #2 Oanda allows trades of any size. If you don't want to trade units of 1,000, you could choose 750 or 1550, basically any size you want. Making it much easier to trade with the exact risk on each trade, regardless of your account size.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
I am also in the US and am wondering with the no-hedging rules, are you able to set pending orders in either direction? Or, do you just watch and enter a position once one or the other level is broken?

--- 帖子 #41 ---
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Using Oanda, you can place opposing trades, as you can on all brokers I'm aware of. As noted, you would need to manually close one order once you have opposite entry.

Before FIFO (first in first out), you were able to place OCO (One Cancels the Other) trades, so you would not need to manually cancel opposite order.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
In my post #39 I said;

Trades with entry totals - 9. for +51pips [+61%] & -124pips [-83%].

Kind of confusing, so let me break it down:

• Trades with Entry, refers to all trades entered that did not reach TP or SL.

• I further broke down those in both pips & % based on fib levels.

• Also these trades were measured by taking price at close of Friday. This could be different for each of us, depending on how you decide to manage.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Hi there!

I like the simplicity of the system, I'm not an expert coder but will try to make an EA tonight when I get home(GMT-3).

One thing I know I will struggle with is ignoring weeks with festivity days but will make the simple rules first and we can work the rest later.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Ok, here it is. A very basic version just to see if I understood all the rules correctly because english is not my primary language and I'm still new in this (less than 1 year in forex)

What the EA is doing:

-When Tuesday ends and the daily bar closes it will put 1 buystop order and 1 sellstop order and set the TP and SL according to the input percentages of the range between the high and low of Monday+Tuesday. This will do it only if there was no other operation already with the magic number for the day.

-When one of the two pending orders opens it will cancel the other pending order

-On Friday it will delete any pending order

What the EA is not doing

-Closing any order even if it was open for months as the OP didn't give directions for this

-Trailing stop (I can add this feature if needed)

-Money management (Same)

Please test it and point any bugs you may find and of course feel free to modify it as you please but only only and only if you are going to share your work with the rest of us

Cheers!

Sangui... I had just finished coding this up and saw your post lol... Code looks nice.. Thanks for sharing..

--- 帖子 #46 ---
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Thank You. Good job.

One thing to be aware of, some brokers have a different end of day time. In this case there could be SIX daily bars, instead of FIVE.

Five PM New York time (2200 GMT) would give you 5 daily bars. This would change during those times of the year that when your zone may have some sort of Daylight Saving.

Just finished backtesting 2019, with first 4 weeks of 2020. GbpUsd ONLY!

Criteria:

• 15% Breach of Monday Tuesday Range.

• Profit @ 65% of range.

• Loss @ 80%* retrace of range (= to loss of 95% of total range). Other Stop Losses have been suggested in this thread.

• No Win, No Loss trades closed @ market closing on Friday. This may not be the best way to finish for week.

• No Trades when range is too large. I used 150 pips for this range. Basically double the ADR for GU.

All totals are in % only. % is based on Fibonacci Range of Monday, Tuesday Ranges, NOT Account %!

Final total for 56 weeks, +920%.

• 27 Wins

• 4 Losses

• 15 No Trades because of Range being Too Large

• No Win, No Loss trades, are figured in grand total

* Suggested Stop Loss of 10% opposite side of range (-125%), would have been hit on all 4 losses I recorded.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Ohh well, the practice never hurts right?

Thanks mate, if you have ways to improve it please send me a pm, I'm intrested in seeing how an advanced coder would do it. I'm not sure I'm able to respond yet though as a junior member, but I will when I am.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Thank you diamonddbw, you are right, I will take that into account for next version if the system proves to be profitable, I didn't have time to backtest it yet.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Sangui, thanks for the EA! Some thoughts...

Number 5 below may be an error?

1. Option to keep the opposite pending order open even if it opens to the other side. Many times the other trade would help alleviate some lose.

2. Can we allow for trading on Friday? In my system, anyway, I allow for trades on Friday. The pending orders should be deleted at Friday close, not Friday open. Maybe an option to open on Fridays or not?

3. Motu Maximum Range of the Weekly ATR. Explained/Formula: MoTu range times _____ (option, e.g., .75) must be less than Weekly ATR 14 period to open trade.

4. Maximum monthly range percentage. If the present month has already reached ______ (option, e.g., .75) of the previous months ATR 14 reading, do not open. For example, the trade on 2019.02.27. February had already reached a range of about 515. The previous months ATR was 533. Therefore, if this was set to .95, the trade would not have opened.

5. On mine, 2019.03.20 has a deleted sell order. It should have stayed open. Did that happen for you?

That should suffice. I really appreciate your contribution, Sangui! Much appreciated!

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Hi 4ecstasy, thank you for sharing the system!

I will see what I can do tonigh but for a quick answer:

1. Will add

2. At the moment the EA puts orders only on Wednesday but yes, I can extend it to Friday, if you backtest though they will always be put at the first tick on Wednesday. You are right, is deleting orders at Friday's open, will make it to delete them on close or a couple of hours before to prevent high spread common on market close.

3. Will study

4. Will study

5. Will check

Hello! For some reason, the calculator doesn’t work for me. Do I need to fill in all the cells? or just the first two? Maximum and minimum? I enter the numbers and further calculations do not occur.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Thanks so much! Regarding 2, we might need to have a max spread entry to prevent opening during high spreads.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Not sure what the problem is; make sure your numbers are correct. You should only have to change the fist two cells, yes.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
1. Done

2. Done

3-4. I guess it's possible but it will take me a little more time because they act on different timeframes so I think the only way is by editing, substracting and modifying the indicator's code. If someone else knows how to do it quickly please go ahead.

Don't you think that this functionality will filter too many good trades?

5. What happened here is that two rules were contradicting. A buy order was opened on the previous week but didn't hit TP or SL, so when it sets the buystop and the sellstop on Wednesday it deletes the sellstop inmidiately as we already have an opposite order open. I changed it to compare only with the current week orders and now it works fine. Good catch!

--- 帖子 #56 ---
3-4. It could take out good trades, in fact it will. But as you note, the question is will it be too many? It's your choice, naturally. But I think it will increase the profit factor and decrease the drawdown. Yes, the overall profit may go down, but my hunch is is that it'll make the system more robust.

Looking forward to an update, thanks so much!

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Changes:

-Option to keep the opposite pending order open when one side opens

-Trade can now be initialized on Wed, Thu and Fri

-Settable time to delete pending orders on Fri

-Fixed some bugs and improved code reading

Notes:

Server time for calculating the highs and lows won't be configurable for now, only pending order cancel time.

Hi!, great job, could you add the option to choose between % and TP and SL in pips?

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Hello to all

First of all, please excuse my English which is not my mother tongue, thankfully there is google translation ...

Quoting 4ecstasy

Indeed, it is necessary to add (or subtract in the event of a sale) to the 50% of the range the 15% difference with the highest when taking a position.

2 lines of code must therefore be modified :
Inserted Code double buyTP = NormalizeDouble(high + range * takeProfitPercentage / 100, 5);
double sellTP = NormalizeDouble(low - range * takeProfitPercentage / 100, 5);
become
Inserted Code double buyTP = NormalizeDouble((buyPrice-high)+high + range * takeProfitPercentage / 100, 5);
double sellTP = NormalizeDouble(low - range * takeProfitPercentage / 100-(low-sellPrice), 5);

Here is the modified EA

--- 帖子 #65 ---
So that there is no confusion, here is the EA with version 1.2 (I allowed myself ;-))

Thank you all for sharing

The entry lines are set to 20% at both High and Low using the Fibonacci Tool.

Same as you use the arbitrary 15 and 10

I've decided to keep 7 pair on my watch list, for now. Reason being is they tend to have daily ranges in excess (or close to) 100 pips.

• EurNzd

• GbpAud

• GbpCad

• GbpChf

• GbpJpy

• GbpNzd

• GbpUsd

I've started accumulating manual analysis. GU has been completed for 56 weeks, and numbers are in post #47.

Next 2 GbpAud & GbpCad

--- 帖子 #71 ---
GbpChf & GbpJpy

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Last GbpUsd. I'm in this trade already, but it is not based on info in this thread, so disregard entry, SL, & current pip count.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Great job. What about other GBP crosses? Or are you doing this manually?

--- 帖子 #74 ---
++++++++++++++++++++

Yep. Manually. It takes a while but it allows me to see Exactly how pairs perform, and then I can structure trades to my optimal specs.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Refer to post #47 for what % represents.

GbpAud Totals for 55 weeks, from start of 2019.

• 23 Wins (=50% each)

• 5 Losses (=95% each)

• 13 Trades in between = -49%

• 14 No Trade weeks.

Percent Total = +625

So far it looks as though the odds of getting 2 losses in a row, are very slim. Over 110 weeks, it hasn't happened yet.

--- 帖子 #76 ---

Nice testing guys.

Degolep, if you want to use it for XAUUSD you will need to replace the 5s for 2s in the NormalizeDouble funtion calls:
Inserted Code    double buyPrice = NormalizeDouble(high + range * entryRangePercentage / 100, 2);
double sellPrice = NormalizeDouble(low - range * entryRangePercentage / 100, 2);
double buyTP = NormalizeDouble((buyPrice-high)+high + range * takeProfitPercentage / 100, 2);
double sellTP = NormalizeDouble(low - range * takeProfitPercentage / 100-(low-sellPrice), 2);
double buySL = NormalizeDouble(low - range * stopLossPercentage / 100, 2);
double sellSL = NormalizeDouble(high + range * stopLossPercentage / 100, 2);

Nevermind, found a way to make it work for every pair.

I think this method of using price has greater potential than just trying to make a few pips by Friday close.

When it gets the direction correct with a mid week entry, I reckon the money is there to be made by hanging on with the trend.

Nothing special. I just gotta set it up so I can see good contrast.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
I'm convinced that we need to take into account the recent trend. If it's too strong, it could go against us.

If the range of the last week or so   is significantly greater than the ATR 14 period, I wouldn't open it. But this needs testing!

More of a formula: For long, if Bar 1 is greater than bar ...say ... bar 8 by 1.5 times ATR 14, then the trend is overextended and shouldn't be considered.

I opened GBP crosses

AUD and NZD TP'd at 94 pips and 85 pips respectively.

CAD is still open.

Others haven't opened yet.

I hope everyone got in!

--- 帖子 #91 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++

My testing rule is if Monday/Tuesday range exceeds two times the ADR, I will likely skip that weeks trade.

I did get those, although I traded very small (>1% risk). Also traded EurNzd (0.3% Risk), but got out early due to strong resistance in vicinity of 1.7000.

Early testing in EurNzd is sketchy, so may no longer use that pair. Also skeptical of GCad & GChf & GJpy, due to inconsistant movements. Will post more results later.

What about GBPJPY?

This are results for using 0.25 and 0.75 on of the fibo for SL, so that makes it around 1:0.9 risk:reward trade.

Thanks mtbb, I'm learning everyday.

Thanks Degolep, yes the bug won't reproduce in backtesting but it will on forward on Thu and Fri since I introduced the change for those days.

Here is the fix, please test it.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Didnt know that can be done. But it works for me as it is.

Check post #93 . I've back tested it my SL for past 6 months.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
TP are off, the entries are good. Unless the fibo tool and the EA are using a bit different calculation. You have 50% of the Mon, tue range as tp right? Check post #98 for my fibo settings.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++

OK, looks like you're entering @ 15% above/below range. Got it.

Also looks like your TP is 50% above/below range, or 35% TP. Correct?

What I'm unclear on is the SL. You mention a ratio of 1:0.9. So your SL on a long would be 75%, or 40% SL? And SL on short would be 25%, Assuming you draw your fibo from the bottom of range.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #104 ---
The changes to TP were introduced by transmat to match OPs request, so I don't know really which one is right. OP will have to clarify.

Hi EREBUS good to see you here many thanks for the past help and contributions im also enjoying your BREAKOUT strat in the other forum here on ff please is there anyway you can fashion that fibonacci of yours into an indicator to show entry stop loss and take profit for this strategy your style is kind of unique pls do help if you can and when yo are back on your lap top its a little bit similar to BOBOKUS FIBO but yours is somehow simple.Thanks

--- 帖子 #106 ---
That simply cannot be answered yes or no, so many variables.

For me, if the trade is with the recent trend, and it is in profit or not far from entry, I would hold.

Here is a chart of AUDUSD showing that holding would work quite well into this week.

But as OP is following the GBP pairs, and lots of fundamentals recently for the pound, might not work so well.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
I hope this makes it clear. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

So in this trade for Buy stop the TP is 62pips, SL is 71 pips. And for Sell stop the TP and SL are the same 62/71. So we have around 1:0.9 trade. I could actually make a tighter SL just to make it 1:1 because when I was backtesting there really wasn't a trade that was close call for the SL when it was a loss it went way beyond the SL.

I'm not saying this is perfect but the proposal was too big of a gap between the TP and SL it was around 1:3. So I've put in the numbers in the fibo and TBH I really don't know if its % or what does the fibo show so I can't tell you other than put in the values I gave and try it out. And also back testing a strategy is one thing real live trading is a whole another thing, when trade management comes in to play. I'm sure I would move the SL according to market situation and also move around TP or give it a trailing stop etc...

Hi 4ecstasy

Thanks for sharing your strategy here. I'm sure this will generate quite a lot of interest.

I have tested a few currencies along with Gold and a couple of Indexes this week. Overall great results, I look forward to seeing these continue.

I tested two settings to see how they compared.

Your settings of:

Entry at -15% and 115%

SL at -10% and 110%

TP of -50% and 150% (actually I used -65% and 165% as well, just to see the difference of TP hits) some of the trades you can see came close to 65% before turning back.

2nd Setting of:

Entry at -15% and 115%

SL at 25% and 75%

TP same as above

I have marked the charts with Win/Loss etc, I have not calculated overall totals for % stats.

After only one week your SL and TP seem to have the edge over the closer SL of 25% 75%, I may try other SL% to compare, forward testing may shine a light on this.

I am certainly no expert trader yet, and will test to the best of my abilities, if I have made some mistakes regarding rules or marking of my charts I apologize in advance.

I welcome feedback from you and indeed anyone else here who is interested in the system, Erebus and other experienced traders especially.

Cheers

HI EREBUS can you help with this kind of fibonnacci tool

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Absolutely, no problem, these are my settings using Metatrader 5 Mobile, will be the same for computer version.

Because there's labels for High and Low, you need to drag it from High to Low for them to be in correct position.

Currently I'm using 25% of the range at both High and Low. I believe the OP settings of 15 and 10 are based purely on what he found worked by observations and trial and error.

You can change those levels quite easily, assuming you have Grade 6 math skills.

Actually with default setup most of years result in loss, i'll publich a version of the ea with some other settings for testing.

Ive develop a mt5 version backtesting purpose, but even with low risk settings and multipair the result over many years are not satisifed as what i see in 2019. ( 06/2019 - today have amazin result )

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Being a system that doesn't need to be run on every tick I added a timer parameter in seconds for the code to be executed, most useful for improving backtesting performance. Defaulted to 5 minutes.

v1.4 attached

I agree BeaterTrader,

I ran a backtest from 2010 for some pairs and the results are good for the last months but not before, so we might be at a good time for the system but should be very careful because it doesn't win in the long run, at least with default parameters and this week we also had the Brexit favouring the system. I will go small on next week though and keep going until we have a losing one because trading in general can change. I've created an EA that wins incredible well on the tester from 2000 till 2018 and loses since then, still trying to find a way to make it work for today's times.

Tests with v1.4

Summary of, manual and visual only, research for the week ending January 31, 2020. Looking at the 25% line to trigger a trade entry.

On the 7 major pairs and 21 minor pairs there were:

4 pairs, no entry, EURCHF, EURGBP, EURJPY, GBPCHF

2 pairs, total stop outs, CHFJPY, USDCHF (gave opposite entry)

1 pair, AUDNZD touched the upper line, but seriously, they were the weakest currencies & I hardly ever trade this pair.

Out of 28 pairs, 23 gave entry opportunity, 2 losses and 21 pairs with positive pips, how can traders ignore that?

Some fantastic pips to be had on EURNZD & GBPNZD. I didn't add up all the pairs but it would be heaps pips if left open, I'm only on phone so if anyone wants to check it out, go for it.

So, the question is, was that a normal week for overall price action? It seems to me that this method would be ideally suited to joining an existing trend which is continuing.

It could also pick up reversal of trend (tops and bottoms) as long as price doesn't give an entry on Wednesday or Thursday, and then completely turn around the next day as the USDCHF did. Even so, taking the opposite signal may recover the loss, don't know yet.

I don't think that the USDCHF last week was typical price action, for any pair, on a week to week basis. Thoughts anyone? Who's ready to rock and roll? You have to wait until Wednesday, this method already stopped you from those losing Monday trades

--- 帖子 #130 ---
You have just narrated what I was thinking to implement. There is big gap in R:R ratio with original rules, even 2 SL hit could result in heavy pips loss. I want to try it for 1:1 R:R, the other option I will try is to put SL below the current candle.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
I think this is a great idea as long as the Average Weekly Range still gives enough room to recoup the losses from the 1st trade and hopefully make some extra %'s on the other side. I think breaking even on the other side is awesome in itself. If on our bad trades, we can at least BE.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
TBH knowing how the Fibonacci Tool plots values is basic math.

The 2 points in the settings are "0" and "1"  When the Tool is applied to the chart, the distance between these points is the range.

Say the range is exactly 100 pips, the retracement and extension settings will reflect that. For example, the setting of 1.25 or -0.25 will plot the lines 25 pips from the "1" and "0" lines of the high and low.

For me, the logic of using the Fibonacci Tool to plot the Monday Tuesday HIGH to LOW,  lies in the fact that the Entry is plotted to a percentage of that range, rather than an arbitrary fixed number of pips for every pair. In other words, it changes with the volatility of the pair.

Using the example above, when the range is doubled to 200 pips, the Entry is also doubled to 50 pips, compared to the fixed model of say 15 which would be the same for both pairs.

Just depends on how you view price action, myself, I see that every pair has different Average Daily Range so think this should be considered when deciding on entry and target points.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Hey buddy, how are you doing? Good to see you joining in here.

Speaking of AWR, this is my chance to direct followers over to

https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=939778

Haven't used it myself, only working from a mobile MT right now ☹ but definitely great advice to be aware of both ADR and AWR.

Now to your comment, given that this method doesn't give an entry until Wednesday at the earliest, any total reversal such as the USDCHF did, will hardly be completed by Friday, so this requires holding into the next week.

This type of fake out move and reversal is well know on smaller timeframes, pump & dump

On the daily, I would expect the USDCHF to continue lower, the assumption being it has decided on direction for the near term anyway, which seems to be the main trend.

Cheers

Edit to add chart,  fascinating price action

I'm totally agree but, may this system work since 2019 star? I mean, the years before 80% of trades result in loss, may we can just test and see what happen

Anyway, if someone have ideas to improve the EA I can code it

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Then what if we take the trade only after fake out occurs (the first triggered pending order stop loss hit). Does this change its win rate ratio ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #138 ---
You're on to something.

You know you can implement this, from beginning of the week phase to an hourly chart? Or daily, whatever.

It's the same concept statistically:

price will move to be ~10% on one side, before it will go to about 5x to the opposite side, 80% of the time, to create the normal range; in a blink of an eye no less. :-)

Of course, that 10% isn't just for it to be there, you ever know how much crap a bank can fit in an hour's, day's, week's time? More advertisement than an American football game.

Heck, even if the fake move is 1%

1%+ the spread that many times will not be enough to cover the 5x reward. It's like gambling still if you made it this far... needs refinement.

Add a bit of a low blow by not finishing a range, and people are triggered not following discipline, changing systems, fading prices, omens, psychology, magic number trails, entering at high volatility and card reading(order flow & candle types) for prediction purposes.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
I have redone the Calculator sheet (thanks 4Ecstasy) to suit how i want to adjust my entries (most calcs from original):

The same HL entries as original

The 3 blue boxes i look at:

- Entry % is how much % i want to enter above or below the HL range

- TP% is my % of range in pips i want to take. 0,1 is 10% 0,5 is 50% etc

- SL% same as TP% so i can adjust my SL as i choose

Hopes make sense. So next week i will look at ADR, AWR and how it may affect my entry decisions TP and SL.

Have a look, i have checked against original doc and my calcs look ok.

Forgive me for not using EA. I test everything manually, and get quite different results, probably because using different sets of TP & SL, as well as partial wins/losses, etc.

OK, just went through GbpAud for 2018.

Entry @ 15%

TP @  55% (= to +40%)

SL @ -55% (= to -70%)

• 25 Wins (= to +1000%)

• 9 Losses (= to -630%)

• In Between loss & win totals (= to +138%)

• 11 No Trade Weeks

As is total would be 508% for the year. (Remember, this is equal to fibonacci % per trade, so you would need to figure your risk per trade for results in currency).

++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Now I'm going to suggest something contrary to what most would do.

PLEASE PM HATE MAIL DIRECTLY TO ME !

To this point this thread has missed being Trolled, and I'd like to keep it that way. If I get hate mail, that's cool, cuz I could care less.

Of the 9 losses only once did 2 consecutive losses occur. So, if trade size was doubled, after each loss, (Except after 2nd consecutive loss, [at this point I would have accepted the equivalent of 3 full stop losses{one full stop & double one stop}, and returned to normal risk]), the positive % would have been +908%, nearly double the other way.

You should test few years back, maybe like 2012 or something. Few members pointed it out already that it is working lately, probably because of the brexit talks.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

100% Agree. I'm doing 2015 now. I'll pick some other pairs and do random years.

Also, it's starting to look as if original criteria proposed by 4XTC, may be best bet or using 80% for SL. I'll be checking both.

For GA 2018 I checked out 50% win with 25% loss, and it was not good. GA, in particular, likes to roam.

and now, back to the charts...

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Tested GA for 2015, using 65% TP & 80 SL.

• Wins 17 = 850%

• Losses 15 = 1275 %

Obvious losing year.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Did you notice any of the winning trades where the profits might be larger if kept open another week or two? These would have to be deep in the money, maybe news driven, where it seems quite safe to hold open positions.

Obviously that would mean compounding if another signal in those following weeks.

It's always a dilemma between taking the profit at a preset target now as in swing trading, or is this the big trend we always want to be on. Look at that tosser GBP today!

For example, OIL consolidated a few weeks back, then a signal, look at it now.

Of course this could be the case some of the time, but I did not look for that. I did notice what other fixed % would have done, but no real difference.

If memory serves, this was the year Brexit was first a news item. I will have a look at other pairs, years and such. However my eyeballs need a break. Also Caucus for me tonite.

Regarding continuations, I have another method I use for that.

Are we just going to sit here and ignore the first two days of each month?

Seriously, not to hijack my own thread, but notice how often the first two days of each month are a kind of 'turning point' of the month.

Often the first two days serve as a high or a low for the month, but definitely not always.

What about if those first two days are a MoTu? There are definitely some impressive runs.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Just complete GU analysis for 2016. Using 65% as TP & 70% as SL. Making R:R 17:10.

Here's what I found:

• 23 Wins = +1150%

• 8 Losses = -680%  None Consecutive

• 15 weeks with no trade. Since the GU was more active in 2016, ranges larger than 200 pips, were not traded. Brexit crap.

• The weeks which were entered without hitting SL or TP, ended up slightly negative.

By doubling your trade size following a loss, the -680% would change into +120%.

By making your % = to $1 each, that would have netted about $45/week.

** Remember, percentage is equal to fibonacci % per trade, so you would need to figure your risk per trade for results in currency.

I like the beginning of the week. I can almost always find between 1 & 6 pair that seem to be turning. Trading with the "Week" as focus, can get you out of the minutiae, head banging zone.

If they are both on the same candle it is OK, then that is your total range, so in your chart Monday is engulfing Tuesday candle

Question for the programmers following and familiar with this system - simple EA to buy at the High or sell at the Low of the Monday Tuesday range.

Take Profits at +25% of that range, Stop Loss at the middle 50%, allow multiple entry attempt if stopped out

No indicators, no filters, not timeframe dependent, only the price and time (2 days)

Example attached charts, 4 hour and 1 hour for clarity

Run on 1 pair to test, if good results, run on 28 pairs as a portfolio

Can be done?

Erebus, doesn't the version 1.4 in this thread do that?

Set the SL to -50, entry to 0, and TP to 25.

You're probably right, as I've said before, unfortunately I limited to a phone just now.

Just getting a live MT5 account set up, it has all the instruments available for analysis and trading. For instance, the DXY, Dollar Index. Seeing this earlier would have made decision on the AUDUSD, EURUSD, GBPUSD, NZDUSD, USDCAD, USDCHF & USDJPY much easier and confident.

As an additional idea for EA.... if you trade multiple pairs what about a "basket" TP? Some pairs will be up others down so you have an option to choose your % or pips profit for the week? Let say you want 100 pips gain for the week the EA will close all open trades once hit.

This is possible?

Trying this system on 4 hr TF , going good as of now, lets see how does it perform.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Hello to all

Quoting  Fantuz

Yes of course. This closes all the positions when the account shows a gain or a loss of what you have defined in the table. It is not in pips but in account money.

You have to open a new graph in a symbol that generates enough ticks (for updating the data) like eurusd for example.

The template below provides for all of this.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
I don't wan't to be the Grinch in this thread but we have to show the losses also. All of these hit SL. And only 5 wins for now, some trades would be also running now and don't look that good. And I would close them because of the NFP.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Please explain how your apply this system on the 4hr TF and attached the MTF indicator at the bottom of your chart.

Thank you

Instead of the first 2 candles of the week, I would expect he uses the first 2 candles of the day, on 4 hours timeframe.

That's start of Asian session, less volume, might be some narrow ranges, but if the direction is correct, could be HUGE payoff.

I watch 28 pairs so too much work for me, good luck to him.

No indicators are needed whatsoever for this system; let's keep it that way.

Hi Everyone

Please forgive me if this may seem like a silly question. I'm new to Forex and everyday is a learning experience. Thank you kindly all for this system and for all the contributors thus far. My question is when looking at the HH and LL for Monday and Tuesday, do you take the wicks into account or is it just the bodies of the candles?

Kind Regards,

Kris

--- 帖子 #186 ---
You're not the Grinch, I agree, report the losses.

And then be proactive, dig deeper, read even more price action. What did we miss? Can we avoid this in the future? What can we learn from it?

Several of those trades didn't trigger with my settings of 25%. However, NZDCHF hit right on the line; let's take a closer look.

Daily chart appears to be in a downtrend, Thursday an Inside Day, using the Fibonacci Tool on Wednesday, there is an opportunity to recover by selling short trade.

Monitor all the NZD pairs and observe a strength meter on Friday shows the overall market conditions. Depends if you are able to devote the time required to make decisions during the London and New York sessions.

Not a silly question, but your answer is in the question.

The descriptions you used for candles, there is only 1 high, 1 open, 1 low and 1 close price.

Therefore the very ends of the wicks are the high or the low; the bodies are from open to close.

Take a close look at the charts I have posted, see the High and Low marked by the lines of the Fibonacci Tool.

Good luck, hope you stick around, come back for more

Hi 4ecstacy & Sangui,

4ecstacy - Thank you for starting this discussion & sharing your ideas.

Sangui - Thank you for your work creating the EA and sharing with the group.

erebus - Thank you for sharing your experience, insights and humor.

Rereading the third sentence in Post #1,
"Logic behind the system: The highs and lows of Monday and Tuesday often form the low or the high of the week."

I have been considering how it works trading as daily breakout from previous day's range.

From the statement above, Tuesday has very high probability of being higher or lower than Monday's range. Why not trade Tuesday as breakout too?

Same thing for Wednesday vs Tuesday's range, Thursday vs Wednesday's range, etc.

Manually testing daily breakout with Fibo using erebus settings: Hi & Low Entry = 0%, TP = 25%, SL = 50%, high percentage of days are winners.

You can quickly test this with Fibo using erebus settings: Hi & Low Entry = 0%, TP = 25%, SL = 50%, and walk it through any days and weeks in history.

Sangui, for testing, is it possible to modify the EA to trade every day vs the previous day's range? Mon vs Fri, Tue vs Mon, Wed vs Tue, etc?

Primary enhancement request is for trading every day.

This second request is for possible later improvement if EA works for trading every day.

The other addition to the EA would be to have ability to place multiple Buy-Stop & Sell-Stop trades, at same Hi/Low Entry = 0%, with TP at #1=25%, #2=50%, #3=100% (user select %s).

When position #1 hits TP at 25%, move position #2 & #3 SL to 5% or 10%.

When/if #2 hits TP at 50%, move position #3 SL to 25%.

A footnote to the request for opening multiple trades, for folks in the USA, EA will have to change the lot size and/or entry price for each order.

For example:

Lot size change: #1 = 0.13 lots, #2 = 0.12 lots, #3 = 0.11 lots.

Entry Price change: #1 = 1.12303, #2 = 1.12304, #2 = 1.12305.

Once again, thank you for your consideration, and thank you for what looks like a great idea.

All the best,

John

Hi northwind,

What you are requesting is a different system, you only need to read the name of the system to realize that. You can start a new thread for this and I might be able to help you in some days when I finish what I am working on now or someone else could be intrested in doing it. If you do then send me a pm, I will check it when I can. Cheers!

Hi Sangui,

Excellent. Thank you.

I debated whether to make the request in this thread or not.

I will try to start the new thread in a day or so.

Thanks again for sharing this current EA.

Don't worry about Risk to Reward, the strike rate is fantastic

Would U mind posting a recent SS of please ?

For some reason I'm having trouble with my stops

PS.  for the longs would U set the first or second SL on the fib tool ? Judging by your RR the first ?

--- 帖子 #206 ---
No problem mate, yes, your probably right that I tightened the stops. I noticed that when these trades go in the direction of the break, they didn't really retrace much, so no need for huge stops. Helps the risk to reward situation, and the strike rate with 2 to 1 being much closer.

Check the settings with this 1st SS, pretty basic, then add the levels you want from the 2nd SS.

Compare on GBPCHF, long entry about 1.2700, stop loss about 1.2650 so 50 pips.

Therefore, Take Profit 1 to 1 should be about 1.2750, and 2 to 1 about 1.2800, make sense?

So not posting there, just as well as I could be a trouble maker

How about that Max, wow, so many indicators, is that really a professional trader?

Even Mark has a huge amount, combined with complex analysis, how can a novice learn all that, remember all of it, and apply it?

Wonder how Max's sniper Strat is going I think that's what it was called lol ye and I agree about mark I left there a while ago now training under ICT allot more clarity in his training and precise unlike mark lol

--- 帖子 #210 ---
It would be helpful if you would set up the EA to place buy and sell orders with the option to either only buy or only sell. In other words, have an option for people to choose one or the other.

This will be of benefit to those of us who are stuck with FIFO/non hedging rules.

Now, to those who are trading from the US, as far as I can see, nothing is preventing you from opening two different MT4 accounts with the same broker or having two accounts from different US brokers. In other words, if you have two accounts, then why not sell on one and buy on the other?

--- 帖子 #211 ---
I can't say for sure that I will follow this strategy. However, the day of the week indicator is brilliant! That, I will definitely use, as I can see how useful it can be for trading when patience is applied.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Let me see if I understand what you are saying.

You say: "Find the highest high and lowest low of Monday and Tuesday."

In other words, look at the Daily candles for Monday and Tuesday. Whichever one is higher, mark the high of that candle as the highest high of the two candles. Whichever one is lower, mark the low of that candle as the lowest low of the two candles.

Am I understanding this rule correctly?

UPDATE: I found the answer here.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
why an ea, there is sell and buy stop. my entrie is 6er Ema

--- 帖子 #214 ---
This is why an EA is not ideal with such a system. In fact, EAs usually don't work in favor of the trader in the long run. Nothing beats trading manually. There are certain things to look out for such as volume, overall strength of trend and strength of currency, proximity to major support or resistance, etc...  An EA can only do so much.

The best kind of EAs to use are money management/trade management EA's. But having EAs do all your trading for you is not the wisest approach to trading, as it will most likely lead to more losses than wins.

I think this is a great system, and likely would work out in the long run. But I believe it has to be done manually, because not all market conditions will work in harmony with such a strategy.

Hello all,

I was trying to follow this post but it's quite difficult to understand.

There is anyone that can show how to proceed this week? maybe a real example can be more easier. Or if someone can explain how they setup for GBPUSD based on last week? Monday and Tuesday (10 and 11 of Feb). Last week the first two days don't have low's.

Thank you in advance,

--- 帖子 #217 ---
the easiest way to explain it is this...........imagine Monday and Tuesday were 1 candle. Mark the High and the Low. Start trading these triggers on Wednesday.

Imagine my surprise when I checked GBPUSD week Monday and Tuesday and found they both do have LOW

I'm so disappointed, I really wanted to see that

Any who, I reckon that anyone having trouble understanding and finding the Highest High or Lowest Low of Monday and Tuesday, should consider to stop trading immediately.

Imagine their confusion when Monday or Tuesday is an Inside / Outside Day combination

Hello Erebus,

I don't want to start a discussion. It was a misunderstanding about how this "strategy" is explained. After checking other posts, I saw that I was not the only one having this doubt, wrongly understanding in the beggining that we had to have a first green candle and then a red one (or vice versa).

It's not a question about not knowing how to trade, but a misunderstanding about how it's written.

Nevertheless, thank you to those who answered my doubt.

You appear to be into this strategy and doing well.

Perhaps I should start trading more pairs using this system. Lately I have only been looking for trading opportunities on EURUSD and GBPUSD, because I've gotten tired of monitoring so many currency pairs.

It would be great if there were some kind of conditions for this strategy to create a currency scanner that would make it easier for locating high probability setups.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
same here in cad jpy tp hit and tl activated ....but just in semi demo till now 0.001 lot size...

I maked a simple script(not EA) for this actions.

On first wednesday's H1 bar I drag-n-drop script on the chart. And repeat it for all currencies charts.

What script will do: check for highest high and lowest low for last 48 H1 bars and send 2 pending orders - buy stop & sell stop by %fibo setted when script loaded.

Example for lvl_for_enter = 25:

Entry level for buy stop order = 125% fibo at range

Entry level for sell stop order = -25% fibo at range

Example for sl_for_order = 25:

StopLoss level for buy order = High of range - 25% = 75% fibo

StopLoss level for sell order = Low of range + 25% = 25% fibo

tp: for 5 digits brokers - multuply by 10

if tp = 0, orders need to close manuality.

I close all orders few hours before market close at friday.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
That sounds great!

Here is my problem. I am bound by FIFO and 'no hedge' rules. So I can't set orders up like that. Before I even knew about this strategy, I spent a lot of money to have a special EA created that allows me to set up hedge trades in compliance with FIFO and no hedge rules. I can use my EA for this strategy. It's not as quick as yours, however. I have to input the numbers manually. But it does other things that makes it very powerful. It's more of a trade management EA.

Having said that, what I meant about a scanner is having an additional condition to detect higher probability trading setups for this strategy. For example, a trend filter might be useful or a combination of that and something else. The scanner can be placed on a single chart and monitor all 28 pairs or whatever amount the user desires, and locate these higher probability setups. Once identified, a signal will be given to the user who will then decide whether to set up the trade or not or to select the currency pair(s) he or she wants to use at that time.

I have not experimented with this strategy long enough to know what other conditions might be useful in this regard.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Erebus, firstly, all good wishes and prayers for your hospital work this week. Most important for sure.

Secondly, I was interested in your idea to enter at the H or L and run on for 25% EXCEPT I entered based on the Monday range only (just one day).

This week (demo) I limited myself to these pairs: AJ, EA, EJ, EN, GA, GC, GCf, GJ, GN, GU, NJ. I will now look at the performance of some others for next week.

All 11 took out the 25% Monday range in one direction (already). I thought about your idea to take 1% starting at the H or L. Looking fairly interesting although you were considering it based on the M-T range.

My broker is Oanda so results could be slightly different but most pairs were clear TPs. One or two might not have made it with spread considerations (yet).

I see this type of trading as a subset of the M-T Range set up . . . but likely quite successful.

ON REVIEW:  GCf did not quite clear the spread but yet may.  GC would be a probable SL with a later TP following reversal.

FS

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Just an idea, but if a person implementing this strategy uses a trend bias from a higher time frame such as the Daily or Weekly, it might be in his or her best interest to double up the risk on pending orders leaning in the direction of the trend, within reason, of course.

In other words, let's say the trend is strong bullish. That would mean there is a higher probability it will breakout to the upside. So a trader could place a buy pending order in favor of the trend at 0.10 while placing a sell pending order in opposite direction to the trend at 0.05. This could potentially minimize the risk and make up for losses. A break even strategy might even be useful.

Strategy refinement to work towards producing the best possible outcome can be of great benefit.

Note: This is just an idea for educational purposes. Not financial advice. You trade at your own risk.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
While I am sure most followers are watching the M-T results it seems  that all xxUSD pairs must be allowed to run for two days since all have ADRs in the 40s.  Anything shorter leaves the trader 25%, less spread, netting only 10-12 pips.  The second day opens other possibilities.

It is only those handful of pairs with the daily range up around or over 100 that might be considered for the Monday range alone.

Looks like the M-T is chugging along for most.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
But, what if your definition of trend says EURJPY is down, no trade?

Totally miss the winners on all JPY pairs. From what I see, working fine without trend filter, or any indicators whatsoever.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
That's a good point!

I would determine the trend from a higher time frame such as the Daily or the Weekly. Granted, EURJPY shot up like crazy today after having been down for some time. But that would have been one trade I would have missed. You can't win them all. But for almost 5 weeks prior, I would have been getting sell signals on EURJPY.

The point is that I think we all need to put our heads together and take this effective strategy and make it even more effective. I think this is possible. But are people willing to do that? Let's see.

I already offered a suggestion that could make things better. Maybe you or someone else has something to add to that.

This happens in every thread, someone wants to add an INDICATOR or FILTER

I see you have smiley face when claiming 5 weeks good trade, as if they needed trend filter?

They are good signal anyway

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Well, what I mean is if you are only going to trade a few pairs it doesn't really matter. But it's not easy to keep track of 28 pairs. Yet, having a system to monitor that many pairs might prove to be more profitable. Hence the reason for a filter.

Indicators that make our job as traders easier are worthy of the space they take up on the chart. But most indicators are more of a distraction than a help.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
If you want something to do with trend, let's do it like the famous Turtles

Okay, so I lost all my charts, on my phone, when I had to reinstall the app, so starting from fresh.

I would look at Weekly chart, why? Weekly is 5 day period, Turtles traded a 20 period breakout, so mark off the Highest HIGH and Lowest LOW of the last 4 weeks.

Hopefully, English-language comprehension has improved amongst our faithful followers and there will be no confusion about which of the 4 candle wicks is highest or lowest.

As example, here is AUDCAD

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Assumption made that everyone can count to 4

So, we can see from the Weekly chart, a lot of consolidating price action in the past, last 2 weeks have long tails on top, price is trading on the low side of that 20 days range

It's history now but price did breakout, next chart will be the Monday Tuesday Fibonacci set-up

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Here is the 4 Hour chart, this could be the cherry picked chart for this system, it is perfect, it's here and now this week, wow!

There is highest high on Monday, lowest low on Tuesday, consolidating on Wednesday, breakout on Thursday, and at the breakout of the previous 20 period lows too, just perfect chart pornography to my eyes!

I have set Fibonacci lines at 15% above and below the Monday and Tuesday range as per OP. I will call this a zone and try to catch an entry there, don't be so fussy, stops and targets can be adjusted.

Questions, comments, criticism, suggestions welcome (except indicators or dropping Tuesday)

Hi all,

First off, thank you 4ecstasy for the system - it looks very good, and I've missed this week, but will be giving it a go next week.

I was wondering if anyone has thought about whether or not broker server times make any difference to the strategy?  I think that brokers who are well off from GMT would have a big impact on the strategy, but those that are +/- 1 or 2 may not.

The answer to this would, of course be to use H1 to determine the high & low of Monday and Tuesday, adjusted according to the broker's offset.

e.g. my broker is IC Markets, and is GMT+2, meaning that their daily candle starts at 22:00 GMT.  So, using H1, I would use 02:00 Monday to 02:00 Wednesday to get the upper and lower limits.

It's only 2 hours, I know, but I'm wondering if it could have a big impact?

We all don't have enough statistics by this system. Only 2 weeks. It's nothing for longterm distance. I will collect statistic nearby 8-12 weeks and decide what will be do.

I mean not fixed position. Screenshot is live from my terminal, not history.

Dynamic means moving

Static means stopped

In the context of trades, dynamic means the pip count or profit is still moving as the trades are still open.

When trades are closed, the pip count or profit will remain fixed or static.

Why do you think brokers not using the generally accepted daily Forex closing time of 5 pm New York would have big impact on the strategy?

All that matters is the Highest HIGH and Lowest LOW of Monday and Tuesday

IC Markets is 5 pm New York close, so don't worry about any other brokers, don't complicate the situation with scenarios that don't even exist

--- 帖子 #277 ---
I've only considered entry based on PRICE not timeframes

If you mean to wait for a close of 1 hour candles before entering, PRICE could be 50 or pips beyond, no advantage there that I can see

I post charts on the 4 Hour because that is the easiest way to display the full week, entry is at a price level or breakout zone, never on a candle close, no one ever mentioned that.

Do what you want, use any indicators you want, then share the results with us...

--- 帖子 #278 ---
So your going to keep the same pairs for your testing ?

was last week and this week the same pairs ?

i noticed the list is different maybe those other pairs didn't trigger a trade.

ps are what fib settings are you using the OP or Erebus ones or your own ?

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Good advice. This system most always gets you into the trade in the "right" direction, at a sensible level.

Don't be like those top and bottom pickers over at

When you start hedging, surely you have to question your sanity? You'll never be 300 pips "wrong" in this thread.

Yes. I will going to keep this pairs list. For details you can read this post.

The revious week, I traded same currency. One defference - it was fully manual. This week I used script posted here. Nothing has changed much in trade, the levels are all the same +- 5 pips.

Pairs the same. Trigger for buystop & sellstop is +25% and -25% fibo at High and Low monday-tuesday range. As I known this %fibo levels proposed honorable  Erebus

--- 帖子 #283 ---
I tried using the script but does it only work on Wednesday morning in the first hour ? I tried using it on the charts today but it didn't place any orders obviously..

Lessons from “the Turtles”

1) Trade with an edge. Find a strategy that brings profits in the long-term.

2) Manage your risks. Manage your risks to stay in the game longer and enjoy a winning streak.

3) Be consistent. Follow the entry rules to reach your goal and earn a profit.

4) Keep it simple. Simple trading systems tend to be more reliable and time-tested.

I'll go with 1% per position on my new MT5 account that I opened because MT5 is so much better on a mobile phone, for demonstration purposes for this thread.

I transferred $1,000 from my main account as it was a live account, it's up $126 in 2 weeks, who can do the maths on that? Will post picture for total transparency, see the open date.

There might be a lot of open positions, but what's the worst that could happen? Lose 28% I guess

So, now that we're committed, probably be the most Schmitt,  whipsawing and horrible ranging price action week ever.

As for maximum range, we can deal with that when it happens, on a case by case decision.

Another example of the Zones mentioned few posts back.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #308 ---
I went back and re-read your post about the zones, but for some reason i'm still not understanding how your using those zones for entering? They appear to be beyond your TP levels. Are these "zones" re-entry levels? I just got home from working a long grave yard shift so if i'm asking a dumb ass question, I blame it on lack of sleep. Oh yea.......a Bear Attack!?!?!? Holy shit!

Edit: I was setting up my presets for me EA and I was going to set one up with your settings. Just so I'm looking at this correct. You are still using 25% for entry but it looks like you changed from 50% TP to 1:1? and then 2:1 for a 2nd target?

When do you move your SL to break even? Also when do you take profit?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Thank you kind sir, much appreciated

The zones I mentioned, just a buffer area to highlight where the Entry,  and Take Profits levels are. Look at last example, how price stays at each level, plenty of time to make a decision.

For me, the trade doesn't have to be a rigid, mathematical problem to solve. The market is dynamic, price is always  moving,  sometimes you will get more, sometimes take what you can.

Happy Sunday

--- 帖子 #313 ---
yeah thats the part thats a little confusing to me, your zones are beyond the breakout trigger where we are supposed to enter. The zones are beyond the TP areas. Thats what is a little confusing to me. Thats why I thought they were zones to "re-enter" a trade. No worries.....i'll figure it out eventually as I continue to follow the thread and watch trades unfold.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
thanks a lot for the system you share sirrr

Nice and a few of them went above 1:1  so maybe it's worth leaving a little on the table to see what happens.. ? Looking forward to next week.. I'm sure as we go on the management of the trades will get allot more important.. a trailing SL might be in order

hello, every system will make minus once. remember that this week had more vola not only because of corona. but I find it simple and simple is mostly good

--- 帖子 #318 ---
I don't do this. Pending order in my way have only SL at 50% fibo. No BE, no TP.

At the moment, there are still very poor statistics on this system. Need at least a couple of months of statistics and then analyze how to set the BE and/or TP.

I'm not sure what I can write it here. You can see this in my profile in trade explorer section.

Good day, fellow lovely traders.

I was stumbled by the name of this system and decide to give it a try. This is my first ever comeback to forex trading after almost 4 years. (because I was in university that time)

I try the EA but the results is pretty disappointed. So, I decided to go manual.

Loaded day of week indicator and set up my Fibonacci tools with settings like Erebus(credits to Erebus!). I will see you all in Wednesday!

Hi Erebus! I'm thinking of using currency strength indicator on Wednesday to see the strongest and weakest currency as set up. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #333 ---
I believe we need to be paying more attention to each pairs Average Weekly Range and also Weekly S/R. If after Tuesday a pair has already exceeded 80% of it's Average Weekly Range then I probably wouldn't want to enter that trade and expect it to continue on to get 1:1 return. I understand that anything can happen and a pair can easily go for 250% of it's AWR.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Hi Erebus, Speedy recover mate keep up the good fight that is life.

So I note you have a 1 unit for a loss, 2 for a win. Does that mean your SL is 25% of the range assuming your TP is still 50% of the range? I am still using 50%:50% or 1:1.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
All those calculations are made on an entry at or near the low or high.

Stop Loss at the middle of the range, so 50%

I'm sure in live trading, I will manage position by moving stop to BE when price gets to Level 1.

The results are based on taking 2 to 1 regardless of how much further price went. Look at the JPY pairs last week, easy in hindsight to say, oh, I got 6 to 1.

EURAUD is an example of an easy trade, no one could get this wrong. If you have a question about any pair, now is your chance, but you should have already used the Fibonacci Tool on last week's prices and know what happened.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Can anyone put a few words on the latest settings? Some talks entry at 15%, some talks entry at 25%. Im confused

--- 帖子 #337 ---
I've never really used the Fibonacci tool before. Can I get a chart set up on my MT4 like this Erebus? I know you've been using your MT5 mobile app to make these charts. I really like how simple, clean and easy to read your chart is. Also I PM'd you.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
It's an individual choice, pick one, run a visual test over last week's prices on the pairs that you want to trade.

Risk management as per your trading plan, but 2 to 1 seems to cover it as far as I  can see.

Good luck

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Yes, of course, Fibonacci Tool is universal across every trading software; but we're not using Fibonacci numbers, just use the Tool to measure the range and project the targets.

I have posted the settings a few times, just scroll back to find them.

Good luck

Not seeing a lot of effort here people

I will post another example of visual backtest and a trade that could have been made last week, and I can do this on a small phone screen.

AUDCHF, Monday 17 and Tuesday 18, vertical lines to display the high and low

Apply the Fibonacci Tool,  yellow box is the entry area, there are 3 x 4 Hours candles there, enough time to think and ACT?

Place the stop loss area at red box, have the Take Profit ready in place at the green box

First to post an example, win, lose or BE, wins a Snickers  bar

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Ok, I've seen the settings. I've read every page on the thread. I have a EA that runs this method but it's mainly just the thread starters rules. It's not as flexible as it should be yet. It's basically a beta version. It plots the trades for you but I was wanting a "template" i could use that would just load the Fib for me, instead of having to open up a Fib tool and measure the H and L of Mon and Tue for every pair and have to also go inside the properties and change the Fib's to what I want on all of them.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Once you make the Fibonacci Tool settings, you shouldn't have to change on every pair.

If the Fibonacci is already there, delete it, and reapply with the new settings, we don't need to do this until Wednesday, usually the high and low are fairly obvious at that point.

It's hard work for sure but there will be rewards

Good luck

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Are you referring to using the Fib tool to calculate the high/low/entries etc.?  If so, you don't need it as we're not using Fibonacci ratios here - we simply use the tool to scale the lines for the chart.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Absolutely, I always watch the strongest vs weakest

If that pair or pairs is moving, and there is a price entry level, S/W is great confirmation

Good luck

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Thanks. I'm working on it now but it's not seeming to line up the High's and Low's of the 2 days I selected. I'm using last week as a guide to set up the Fib Tool and save as a template. I have all the levels charted and named but when i switch screens it changes the High's and Lows. Something is not right. I'll keep trying though. Thanks for your help.

Edit: I'm trying to use the Fibonacci Tool that is provided by MT4 under the "Insert" tab at the top. I'm using the Fib Retracement. I will start looking for an idicator that might be able to plot these levels as well that is easier to use then MT4's. I know i'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer, but i'm also not the dullest...lol.

Edit 2: I just realized that using that tool provided from MT4 it will not save to a template. Back to square 1.

I give up on setting up my Fibs on MT4. If anyone on here is using MT4 and has a Fib Indi that they use with this strategy, will you please share? TY. I'm trying to get a indi that will set up the fibs like how Erebus has shown in his examples. They are nice and clean. Unfortunately he is using MT5 Mobile.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
No, not pips, percentage

The Fibonacci Tool has a range of 0 to 1, in the settings

These are the points when drawing the Fibs from High to Low

The range between high and low, between 0 to 1, could be anything, but it's 100%

So, a setting of 1.15 and -0.15 will draw a line 15% away from the 0 line and the 1 line

Every pair will be different, the greater the range between high and low,  the greater the distance between the 0 line and the -0.15 line, same for the 1 line and the 1.15 line.

Automatically adjusts for volatility

Hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
It's the same for MT4, don't know where you are going wrong

I got it figured out as much as i'm going to. I never used Fibs before so i'm not familiar with them at all. I know a little bit about how to use them but I've never done it. Any way, I have all my levels set. I will just have to go through each pair individually and set up the fibs for each of them. I thought that there might be an indicator out there that would allow you to select Dates/Times and do this for you. With as popular fibs are i'm suprised there isn't. Either way, I got it.

I'm going to start with 25, different weeks will yield different results for each but the principle is intact, so i wouldn't fuss too much over it

Trickier part is to account for correlation across the pairs, won't be entering in all the pairs, will likely lean towards pairs that have been trading in a tight range relative to the weekly ADR.  (still doesnt account for correlation risk though )

Hi guy´s, while we wait for Tuesdays to end, maybe it was an idea´ to get some pips with this little simple One hour high / low indicator. It uses the first hour of the day to mark the first swing point as a high or low point to mark a small box. You can now use the same principle as in the Monday / Tuesday system to get some pips while you wait. When the stockastic indicator is over 50 you go north and below you go south. Very simple and effective. But don't be greedy, I only take 20 pips from the day and leave 20% running.

Hello. I recently discovered this thread and I am going to try this strategy this week. However if I may ask, why the the R R is way out of balance, It is almost a 3 to 1 loss. Meaning if the trade is a loss, one will lose almost three times what one may have profited.

In the first post by the author of the thread he wrote about his entry:

For example, this week on GBPUSD.Tuesday formed the high; Monday the low I set a buy order at 1.31011. SL was 1.29495 TP was 1.31617 In this case he could make about 60 pips but in the trade went against him he would lose about 152 pips.

This is a terrible risk reward.

Any opinions are appreciated.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Most of us here love the strategy and most of us have adapted the Risk or Money Management to suit ourselves.

Have gone back and checked how the pairs worked for at least 1 week?

Have you read most of the thread?

I have posted numerous charts with 2 to 1 Risk Rewards

Good luck

--- 帖子 #409 ---
the script places a pending order and its sl,no tp is set right?

--- 帖子 #410 ---
If you have any suggestions to make things better, then please share. Only complaining about how bad you think it is does nothing to help improve the strategy. We need solutions, not criticism.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
So I have an idea for an EA. Tell me what you think about these rules. The idea is to keep it simple.

EA for Previous 2 Days

Settings:

1. Trigger Lines: EA will automatically draw lines on chart at the high and the low of the previous two days. One line for a Buy order and one line for Sell order.

Note: This will only work once.

2. Market Orders: When a candle hits either one of the Trigger Lines, a market order will be placed and the remaining inactive Trigger Line will be automatically deleted

3. Pips Above/Below: User may input a pip amount to work in cooperation with the Trigger Lines. For example, if user inputs 25 pips, then a sell trade will only open if a candle hits the 25 pip mark beyond the sell trigger line, and vice versa for buy trades. If this setting is 0, then it will be disabled.

3. Maximum Allowed Spread: EA will not place trades above the max spread, as specified by user in pips. For example, if it's 5 pips, then only a spread of 5 pips or less will be allowed. Anything above this will be rejected.

4. Stop Loss

5. 50% Off: half of trade will close at user's specified pip amount (can be set to true or false)

6. Magic Number

7. Direction:

a. Default - will only follow settings 1 and 2

b. Long - will only execute long trades (trigger line will only be drawn at the high of the previous two days)

c. Short - will only execute short trades (trigger line will only be drawn at the low of the previous two days)

8. Take Profit: will continue to run if set to 0

9. Manual Mode: if set to true, user may manually input specific prices to open buy or sell trades.

10. Break Even (if 0, then break even will be disabled) Note: both Break Even and 50% off must work together if user has both settings enabled.

I cannot code this. It's just an idea I came up with. If we can get an expert coder to create this EA (without putting unreasonable user limitations on it), then that would be great.

If you think it can be improved, then please share your thoughts.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
we can incorporate fib also,so fib draws taking 2 days worth of data.many times the trade remains between high and low of that weekly zone made on monday and tuesday ,so may be if we can set up one more order on golden zone of fib ,i.e 50-61% to join the trend,the bias will be calculated by fib itself that if it should be buy or sell like it determines green n red color of fib by itself,my 5 cents!

--- 帖子 #428 ---
The strategy is very simple in its setup and execution, and the EA in this thread shows just how simple it can be.

The value of an EA would most likely be in the trade management, where you could have lots of options such as break even, TP1/TP2, trailing stop, money management etc.

I've just finished coding an EA with these features and I'm testing it at the moment, and will post it when I'm happy with it, and will gladly take on board any suggestions for improvements.

Hello everyone,

I see that some people find it difficult to place orders on certain levels while from page 3 there is an EA that Sangui has developed which does the job, so I am handing over the latest version with a setting to slide in "Presets" and "test" (for backtests). The RR is modifiable 2: 1 just like all the parameters.

make good use of it and have fun ... ;-)

Thank you Transmat.  IS this an actual EA or a script?   Does this work anytime or only on opening hour of Wednesday?

My broker daily candle opens at 17:00 EST (NY time).  Does that matter?   If it does, where do I change it so that it matches my broer if neede.

Thank you kindly for your time and efforts

Of course it is a real EA.

This is exactly why it would be good to have an EA with settings to either only go long or only go short on this strategy. Just throwing up a script does not suffice, because other things have to be considered, such as currency strength, for example.

One could potentially produce far more winners than losers by looking at the broader picture before placing a trade using this strategy.

Just one question, is the breakout level the point where we put our buy or sell stop order like in the picture?

What’s this “we” ? It’s up to YOU

Each trader must take responsibility for their trading decisions.

You can backtest or not, see what YOU think is the best entry

Another especially important part is Risk Management

Once the entry is decided, where will YOU place the Stop Loss

You are doing a great job here. So sorry for the incident that happened to you.

I think it is wise to limit the number of pairs to trade at this time, as there is a lot of uncertainty in the market because of what is going on with the Coronavirus. The market is very unstable right now. It's looking more and more like it's going to be a bad year for trading.

Welcome to the matrix

There are 8 “main” Currencies = AUD, CAD, CHF, EUR, GBP, JPY, NZD, USD

Anything with USD is called a Major, 7 pairs

USDCAD;USDCHF;USDJPY;AUDUSD;EURUSD;GBPUSD;NZDUSD

When the others are crossed, they are called Minor, 21 pairs, total of 28 pairs

Some pairs don’t make sense most of the time, AUDNZD, too close related, like kissing your sister

And EURCHF, get out of here, kissing first cousin, same for EURGBP

And CHFJPY, both safe haven currency, can be frustrating

Good luck, and pucker up

I saw that GBP is falling.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Not sure why I did it, but for some reason I moved my stop to break even on AUDCHF and EURAUD far too early and got stopped out for break even.

Had I not done so, AUDCHF would have hit 3:1 target and EURAUD would current be at around my 2:1

NZDCHF amd AUDUSD have stopped for break even, and GBPNZD has had a full stop.

I wasn't using proper lot sizing, but had I done so (and not screwed up AUDCHF and EURAUD) I would be on +4% banked right now.

Thanks to everyone who have contributed. Just finished reading all 24 pages. Very interesting. Missed this week but will have an EA up by next Wednesday. I'm not going to go for anything fancy. See what we can do. Going to do some back analysis as well if I have time.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Just an observation that may help others...

I've noticed that most of the trades that I currently have running negative (including the full loss on GBPNZD) were false breakouts.

Had I not entered exactly on the entry line (+15% of the range for me), but instead went to a lower timeframe for the entry (say M15) and then only entered when the price broke and CLOSED above the trigger line, I would not have opened any of the negative trades.

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Show what you are saying on a chart and post it here so that we can all see what you meant.

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #482 ---

If you go down to the M15 timeframe, you can see that the price never closed above the line.  In this instance, if I'd waited for the price to close before entering, I would never have entered the trade, saving myself a full loss:

I have recently been observing what I call Areas of Resistance. This is where you get prices making Highs or lows that are about the same value but don't break out. On your 15 minute chart there were 4 Highs but no corresponding close above them.  This happens frequently but as yet I haven't been able to quantify how to use them.  Its as though no one wants to BUY above this level.  It also happens with LOWs.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
That script looks very nice, will you be sharing that EA FOR TESTING,

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Yes, although it will be basic and I still have to work out the rules that people are using.

The other observation that I have is that price tends to move to a daily ATR and then stop, guess why it becomes the ATR. I may personally use this as a Profit taking idea.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
All very well in theory, how many traders are able to watch 28 pairs on the 15 minute chart and make instant decisions at very active market time or high impact news events?

How about the Stop Loss and Take Profit price line? Will you wait for a close beyond as well.

Good luck

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Maybe you are clicking BUY instead of SELL ??

--- 帖子 #506 ---
hahaha

No, it's the script's fault!

But I will get this sorted out eventually.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Certain I think the same way. More importantly, Erebus, the trades are meant to be set and forget. Who is ready to baby sit trades.

Get well soon.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
I agree, but how many traders here actually actively watch 28 pairs all day long?  And in truth we're not talking about watching 28 pairs in the 15 minute chart all at the same time are we?

The point I was trying to make was that false breakouts ARE something to be aware of, and I was merely proposing a way of circumventing them.  It's up to the individual as to how much risk they feel they pose and can ignore my observations if they wish.

Your comments about SL and TP are irrelevent, churlish and completely missing the point - I was talking about entries.

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Thanks for this I'll try it out soon the fib tool was getting a painful to use.. how do U calculate your RR if U don't mind me asking ?

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Okay, not 28 pairs, how many ever, no problem

But to confirm the close over the line, the trader has to be on the screen for 24 hours a day watching for that?

I didn’t ask you for the stop loss, I asked if you will watch for the close beyond the stop loss same as the entry

It might be a spike also, and reverse, same as your entry theory

Understand now?

I have been following this thread with interest, on Wednesday start of day I setup my trades based on Monday/Tuesday, Buy at High, Sell at low on 13 pairs, I calculated the ATR for each pair, the total for 13 pair was 850 pips, not wanting to be greedy I only took 400 pips as my target. I ran all 13 pairs as a basket deleting the opposite side as trades were opened, no stop loss was used, 400Pips was achieved on Thursday night Australian time when I took my profit.

I'm not sure if you realize this, but this script of yours can be used as a reliable support and resistance indicator. What are these levels based on besides the Hi and Lo?

Its not very often wrong.  This Mon/Tues is good for trend filtering. As I am at home most of the time monitoring isn't difficult and once a trade is in place I can control the exits.

Hi, I think that's a standard question based on you risk appetite.  I would normally look at 1% of my account as maximum exposure per trade but I also know my RR.  To be honest I need to work a bit more on this as well.  I am a bit random with my trades.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
I looked for you, but I didn't see anything under this name.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
I think the EA should be able to scan ALL the pairs without having to load it on each chart. It should have to option to trade either Buys Only or Sells Only or Both directions. It should obviously have % Risk option per pair. A bonus would be if you would code the EA to check each pairs Average Weekly Range before entering. The input should be adjustable...we should be able to set a % that the pair has not exceeded to be able to still enter trades. Trail Stops and Break Even. There needs to be inputs that allows the user to adjust where we ENTER/EXIT/TP.  The SL should be able to be adjust from either inside the range (ie 50% of range for SL) or outside the range (ie 100% of range +10%).

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Have you seen this? https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...6#post12775666

--- 帖子 #542 ---
This will not work because each pair has a different Daily Range and 25 pips for one pair will be way too many for another pair. This feature needs to be a % of the Range used.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
That's why I included the feature for a magic number. When you change the magic number, it won't matter. You can simply adjust the pips to your choosing per currency pair.

Did you notice I was only using 25 pips as an example?

Yes thank you. I am also looking to build a script to analyse past results as I don't like the Mt4 tester.

Hoping to get some done over the weekend as the weather isn't going to be too good.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
I have one question.

If I still have some orders, should I close them all or pending them before market closed?

My ongoing orders are GU and chfjpy and they're still on profit!

Thanks

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Just closed all orders.

Awesome week. 2100+ pips

Have a nice weekend and see you next wednesday

--- 帖子 #547 ---
2100 pips! How are you doing this?

Please, share your strategy with us. Not all of us are getting those kinds of gains.

Hi All,

I have been working on the script to output a file that can be opened in an Excel spreadsheet, or compatible, that gives the values of Hi,Lo,Hibreak etc.  It also calculates profitability if the price has closed outside Hi or Lo.  This is version 1.0, dinner is nearly ready, so I though I would post it to see if anyone is interested in adding some thoughts.  It will run on any pair although I have only tried EURUSD at the moment.  Cant see why there should be any issues with others.

Next version I hope to have SL TP etc.

I will also produce one that creates orders.

Its looking very good so far and 0xff has some outstanding results this week.

In the words of the once famous John McEnroe, “You cannot be serious! YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS ! !”

I don’t think we need to explain the theory once again, you need to read the thread again, take notes, look at the charts, post a few charts showing where you don’t understand, draw the high and low on every chart, in other words, STUDY.

No one can do this for you, put in some effort. It’s 6 am in Australia, the USDJPY closed at 2 to 1 profits, last chart I posted.

I had 11 full 2-1 winners, 5 full 1-1 losers. Now, I either got the position size wrong on some of these, of the calculator was not accurate, I used Risk by Percentage of account, next week I will use Risk by Amount, see if that is more accurate.

Account was $1120 , now $1268 , profit $147.71 , say $148 = 13% for the week

Each loser should have been $11 and the winners $22 but you can see the actual amounts. On those figures, the 11 winners times 2 is 22 units, minus the 5 losers = 17 units, or 17 times $22 = $374 for theoretically gain on correct figures was possible.

That would be an astounding 33% and never had any point of nervous drawdown. A few reported those early loses, did those guys continue with the system?

Have a nice weekend, and study, study, study, delete all those indicators, I know you’re still looking at them

The thing is, he obviously used the script. But I also used the script and didn't get good results. I didn't use as many pairs either, however. But still. Then again, maybe the key is leaving it all on the table until the end of the week, which is what he apparently did.

And I see you are also having much success with this.

I agree, I need to take a closer look at this. Results like this should not be taken lightly!

--- 帖子 #551 ---
hello, the entry of 0xff seems to me rather at 25% not at 15%?

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Yes, as soon as you can stop looking for something else, a script, an EA, an indicator, and SEE what is right there on the chart, the sooner you will get it.

As I repeatedly say, all I have is an iPad, no indicator can be run, I only mark the price levels.

Trading is only WTF  Wednesday Thursday Friday, so yes, best to let market do it’s thing

Love youse all

--- 帖子 #553 ---
hahaha

But I want my job to be easier. That's why I want an EA to do it for me.

Congratulations on your gains, and have a nice weekend.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Love this approach. I am not using the EA, but applying the principles and am having good returns.

Thanks OP and all the rest contributing thoughts, ideas and resources! It works for me!!

--- 帖子 #555 ---
It was a big week or at least a big Friday, no doubt about that, already I’m thinking caution for next week, not thinking bounce or reversal, don’t want a bias, just be careful and let price show the way.

Today I will mark out the new 20-days highs and lows on each pair, Turtle trend style price levels

Here is NZDJPY at the start of this week

Another thing I will look at for next week, put the 3 to 1 levels on my charts. Obviously, missed a lot of profits by hard exit at 2 to 1 on many trades, get a couple of 3 to 1 will help. Of course, with main trend when observed, reversal or counter trend, use caution always.

Tell me more about the Script, does it allow for Position Sizing? Does it draw the Entry level on chart? I guess the trade lines will be there.

Does it place Stop Loss and Take Profit at the same time?

A few pictures will help educate everyone, noobs may be unfamiliar with usage of scripts.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #559 ---
This is what I had in mind: https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...6#post12775666

Strategy is simple. On first hour of wednesday(broker's time) I use this script on all currencies. Open chart, execute script, open another currency chart and execute script and so on. Script set pending orders at %fibo in settings. As default 25% for level to entry and 50% for SL and no TP. That's all. I close all positions and delete not triggered orders few hours before market close at friday.

25%. See screenshot.

motu_script.mq4 - for send pending orders

CloseAllPositions.mq4 - for close all positions and pending orders

--- 帖子 #563 ---
That worked, usually Coders are all over any thread that has an idea that makes a few good trades.

Maybe this is too simple, no one is interested

Page number is useless, see picture, I have only 15 pages, Post link or number always best

Hi, How many weeks have you run this?  Have you got good results?

--- 帖子 #567 ---
It seems most coders aren't serious traders. So they might not see the value in such an EA. The rules are mostly designed to manage the trade. It's similar to one I already have, but there are noticeable differences. My EA is very powerful.

--- 帖子 #568 ---
February 28, 2020

Today in Forex trading the JPY was strong, creating very strong movements.

The GBP/JPY broke all D1 support levels, and this pair has much more potential to drop.

The AUD/JPY broke out of the W1 support levels and now has much more potential to drop.

The NZD/JPY also had a strong drop and is at D1 time frame support.

Due to the large movements, we would take profit, as some retracement would be expected.

If it's not too much trouble, can you do me a favor and make one that only places sell orders and one that only places buy orders?

Only 3 full weeks. It is negligible to talk about any statistics for this system now. I'll be collect 12-16 weeks before do any conclusions.

I'll join you... had a great week this week and left a few running I don't think we've seen the end of the moves from friday..  but what would we gain from doing a new thread ?

I wonder if U got a short on au200 buddy.. unfortunately I'm with ic markets and can only trade full lots on indices..

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Hi all,can anyone modify Oxff's script.I just use a weekly OLHC bar and apply the fib to the high and low just prior to the Tuesday close (about 8am Australian time),so Im wondering if a script can be with the current high and low when applied to the chart and with 15% entries and 75% stops.I cant program to save myself.Thxs in advance if this can be done.Traded this strategy Manually this week on 6 pairs,5 from 6.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
I was thinking as I am the main contributor here, and I haven’t had any system to share over the years, this could be it.

My motto will be, we work as a team, and we do it my way!

All the index look the same to me, down, down, down

I’m with IC Markets, pretty sure that’s a CFD , not a Full Lot contract

Sell 1 on Monday and find out

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Sound good to me Erebus let us know what U do

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Hello guys

I followed this strategy for 5 weeks till now, and trade on real account for 3 weeks, use lot size is 0.01 and have got potential profit, with R:R 1/2.

However, this strategy is long term trade, some time I can not keep positions until weekend when trade on real account, it belong trading psychology of all most of retail traders , - difficult to overcome tempted by profit.

My setup is : breakout entry +/-25% / SL 50%

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Do we have fibo indcator that draws mon-tues fib automatically?

is this motu script is already set on 25% levels? so it sets up pending orders accordingly?

it would be better if this script was like an EA and the option of OCO,less stress to close tp and cancel the other trade.

is motu system v1.4 works as same as this script ?

--- 帖子 #580 ---
We will only allow you to create a new thread if you are ready to take us by the hand and show us how you trade nicely with your phone.

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Thanks for the close all trade script.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Long term trade? Can’t keep it open? Even in profit? That’s a real problem, better go back scalping or whatever

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Hi Erebus,

During a week when there is a valid trigger, how do you filter whether to trade or not?

--- 帖子 #584 ---
I don’t / didn’t filter any trades out on purpose, well, maybe I ignored AUDNZD

And I don’t like EURGBP, so just plain missed that one, USDCHF reversed the last few weeks with stop outs

But, basically, I try to trade it as a basket method, have as many eligible positions as possible

Looks pretty high strike rate to me, and not all trades are entered at the exact same time as in most basket systems

I’m working on a few refinements, see how this method handles a new month in the aftermath of last week’s high volatility

As we know, market needs 2 days, Monday Tuesday, to fake, take & make - fake moves, take stops, make decision on direction

Back to study the PRICE

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Is this a 20 day MA or ADR20?  I've never used MA's before.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
No, not MA or ADR

A high is a high and a low is a low

Check the chart again, see 2 lines?

Mark the last 4 weeks, high and low, that gives you a good coverage of last 20-days trading

Many pairs broke these levels last week, great for trend traders, not so much for top and bottom pickers

--- 帖子 #587 ---
ahhhh ok, thanks.

--- 帖子 #588 ---
Every time I have used a script,

I've just dragged and dropped onto the chart,

And it would open up automatically,

This script is not doing that,

Can anyone advise,

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
I guess this script is only working when market is open. Try it next week on demo.

THANK YOU

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Hi, traders. Thank you for this wonderful post. I wanted to comment on my results this week. I took 7 trades in currencies and 4 on index. All manually with Erebus fibonacci but respecting 15% breakage. The orders were placed the last hour of Tuesday, Spanish time. Just looking to see the success rate. They closed at 1: 1. All trades have been winners. I will start studying how to squeeze the profits next week.

Thanks again

P.D.Google translate

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Yes only works when market is open

--- 帖子 #593 ---
THANK YOU

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Hello,

Here is the script whose table opens even if the market is closed. (but the order will not pass)

it was just a small detail to add ;-)

--- 帖子 #595 ---
I allowed myself to modify the script a little so that we can place the order at any time of the day on Wednesday.

(but the sooner the better because if an entry level is already exceeded it will only pass the opposite order)

Very important, this script must be opened exclusively on a DAILY GRAPH.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
All this talk about Scripts, you would think it’s a scalping method, or everyone has FOMO

Maybe you’re very busy people, things to do, places to be

Here is one of the best trades of last week, opportunity to place order all day Wednesday and Thursday

How many made pips?

Thanks for the script and the advice.

Sorry if I'm being a nuisance, will this script worked like a pending order,

Again sorry for being a nuisance the answer can wait till Monday have a nice weekend.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Erebus,as you stated in post 585 "But,basically I trade this as a basket method and try to have as many eligible positions open".Thats why some of us want a script,so we can enter trades and then get away from the computer because,yes we are busy and have other things to do.Dont take this the wrong way your opinions are valued here,but we're not lazy,just trying to be more efficient,Cheers

Hey, no problem, it’s not my thread, scripts are great, an EA that traded chosen pairs would be even better...

I just can’t run them  and sorry if you got the impression that I’m against them.

Hopefully someone can run the script and report at the end of this week.

its only a 3 day week after all

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Don’t you have a profit target? Must be at 3 or 4 to 1 already

I bet it bounces on Monday and scares you to exit

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Haha yes it might do.. I've already locked in profit but will monitor it might even hedge it to protect profit margin.. this corona virus has everyone scared plus just read that USA had there first death from it I think we have a couple of cases here on the gold coast as well.. scary stuff really.. anyway I think the Yen will continue in strength for the next weeks at least.. there wasn't great data for China on Saturday as well.. but if not I'll still be on the right side of the market following this stratagy .. it will be interesting to see how much movement we will get after last week tho.. something will move tho and the basket will grab it i bet..

--- 帖子 #604 ---
That is a very good idea! I will add that to my EA's desired features list.

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Yes I did this manually and I added up the ATR for the 13 pairs then just divided in half to get my target.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
what % was this? I don't pay much attention to number of pips. I only pay attention to %'s. Pips are all relative according to account size. %'s to me are like "price". Price is price is price no matter what TF. %'s are %'s are %'s no matter what the account size.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
13 pairs break out

take total daily ATR for all 13 pairs =approx.800pips

take 50% of total =approx. 400pips. as your Target.

whatever % of your capital you use is up to you, I use 3% and this will determine your profit and risk.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Did you follow along after the target hit? Would be hard to determine the pips I suppose.

There were some mighty moves, and seems to me asking for a 1 average move of the ATR in 3 days is not too much.

Something to think about and test.

Good luck.

--- 帖子 #609 ---
There are two things that drive the market, Fear and Greed, I decided not to be greedy and I’m happy with 400 pips if I can get that every week.

Regards, Cosmo

--- 帖子 #610 ---
If your account is large enough, you could actually make a modest living from 200 pips a month.

I'm not at that level of capital yet. But I will be. When? I don't know. But I will get there. Patience has its rewards.

Any of the programmers here that can make an indicator for MT5 (not a script), that will:

- show the high/low from monday to thuesday, resetting every monday.

- Show the SL line 50% of the high/low

- show the 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1 ratio lines above and below

- Able to set colors on each line

I used the script last week purely as a convenience.  I waited up until gone 10pm UK time (I'm usually asleep by 9pm, and don't get to look at a chart until gone 8am) and ran the script on all 28 pairs before going to bed.

I monitored the trades from my phone when I could while at work, and despite making a few errors with my SL here and there and closing trades earlier than I should have, I still managed to get 998 pips.  Lot sizes were fixed at 0 1, but had I used 1% risk on each trade, I would have netted 14.5% profit for the week...bloody good result in my experience!

--- 帖子 #615 ---
I'm putting this together for inclusion in my EA, but its MT4 I'm afraid.

--- 帖子 #616 ---
No chance to make it work for MT5 too? I just like how good MT5 is running compared to MT4. Epsially the strategy testing part, that uses multi cores and real time data. No need for 3rd party program to get real tick data...

--- 帖子 #617 ---
better yet you could "forward" test this strategy either on Demo or Live. No need for backtesting whether it's on Mt4 or Mt5. Backtesting is ok for functionality of an EA but as far as results are considered, you can toss them out the window.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
That’s awesome results, thanks for sharing, let’s repeat this week

--- 帖子 #619 ---
In my opinion if "you" are going to take this strategy serious (as with any other strategy) you should be keeping notes as you forward test your strategy. With this strategy in particular I would be tracking for example.......range size, date of trigger break, time of break, direction of break, whether or not the trade hit SL or TP, if TP was it 1:1, 2:1 or 3:1, also exact amount of pips of TP regardless of r:r, if trade hit SL how far did price travel in initial direction before reversing, how far did price travel after hitting 2nd trigger.   Off the top of my head I can't think of anymore but this would be something to consider if seriously going forward with this strategy. This info would be FAR MORE VALUABLE than any EA or Script.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
The info is valuable. However, I wouldn't say it is more valuable than any EA or script.

An EA or script is for convenience. Anything that can make my job easier is very valuable to me.

--- 帖子 #621 ---
So you're looking for something to make your job easier but not more profitable? I think your priorities are backwards. No offense, im just trying to help.

--- 帖子 #622 ---
I think you don't understand what I mean. If the EA is set up correctly (with the right rules), it should be more profitable and convenient at the same time.

I have a lot of experience trading. I know what such an EA needs. I already shared my idea on here. And if anyone uses it, they are going to have to make it editable. It's my EA idea, and it should be FREE of limitations, FREE to use, and FREE to edit. I hope people understand this.

--- 帖子 #623 ---
My EA Idea Updated

(previous version)

Note: You are FREE to create an EA using the following recipe. But please keep in mind that it is my EA recipe. As the copyright owner of this recipe, my rules are simple: any EA created using the following recipe must be FREE to edit, FREE to use, FREE from user restrictions, and may not be used for commercial purposes.

This EA recipe is my contribution to this community.

EA for 2 Day Breakout

Settings:

1. Trigger Lines: EA will automatically draw lines on chart at the high and the low of the previous two days. One line for a Buy order and one line for Sell order. User can limit this by only allowing the EA to do this for a specific set of days, such as Monday and Tuesday, for example. Only one trade will be allowed at a time per currency pair.

2. Market Orders: When a candle hits either one of the Trigger Lines, a market order will be placed and the untouched Trigger Line will be deleted

3. Pips or Percent Above/Below: User may input a pip amount to work in cooperation with the Trigger Lines. For example, if user inputs 25 pips, then a sell trade will only open if a candle hits the 25 pip mark beyond the sell trigger line, and vice versa for buy trades. This may be set in percent rather than pips. If this setting is 0, then it will be disabled.

4. Maximum Allowed Spread: EA will not place trades above the max spread, as specified by user in pips. For example, if it's 5 pips, then only a spread of 5 pips or less will be allowed. Anything above this will be rejected.

5. Stop Loss: may be by pips or a specific price. If it is by price, then an additional option may be enabled for candle body close stop loss.

6. 50% Off: half of trade will close at user's specified pip amount (can be set to true or false)

7. Magic Number

8. Direction:

a. Default - will only follow settings 1 and 2

b. Long - will only execute long trades (trigger line will only be drawn at the high of the previous two days)

c. Short - will only execute short trades (trigger line will only be drawn at the low of the previous two days)

9. Take Profit: will continue to run if set to 0

10. Manual Mode: if set to true, user may manually input price values

11. Break Even (if 0, then break even will be disabled) Note: both Break Even and 50% off must work together if user has both settings enabled.

12. Option to choose currency pairs.

Note: this recipe does not rely on the OP's strategy. It is much more than that! If the OP's strategy ceases to work, my recipe will continue to work, because it is mostly a trade management recipe, based on a breakout/market order trading system.

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Why mt5

--- 帖子 #625 ---
It's Not yours. The basic system was thought out by the OP. You have merely specified a wish list. It's easy to code so I suggest you learn then you may have some claim for Copyright relates to the work of art, not to concepts or ideas affiliated with the work.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Actually, you are wrong.

The trading strategy belongs to the person who started this thread. I make no claims to owning that.

The rules (recipe) you see on my EA idea, however, is not the trading strategy. It is much more than that!

And yes, I own the EA idea (recipe). I don't own the trading strategy, however. I suggest you learn more about how copyrights work!

If it will make you feel more comfortable, I can change the name of the EA idea to 2 Day Breakout.

And for your information, my EA idea does not rely on the OP's strategy. It can work independently of it. If the OP's strategy stops working, the EA (my recipe) will still continue to be useful.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Because i like how MT5 works and the use of multi cores. Easier to load 28 pairs and let it run smooth in MT5. Thats my experience...

And i have alot of payed stuff in MT5, that i cant use in MT4. Like trading dashboard ect.

--- 帖子 #628 ---
No nuisance, redfan, there are no worries :-)

The script passes two stop orders waiting for one of the predefined levels to be reached.

This script was coded by Oxff, thanks to him.

--- 帖子 #629 ---
If your intent is to use my EA recipe to create an EA with user restrictions/limitations, then you do not have my permission to do that.

The OP was generous to share his strategy without imposing user restrictions/limitations. We should be just as generous.

My EA recipe must be FREE to use, FREE to edit, and FREE from user restrictions, and may not be used for commercial purposes.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
just pay someone to make it for you on MQL5 or what ever site it is and then you can call it "yours" all you want and do as you please. I can tell you that the way you are coming across you're not going to be able to find someone to code it for you for free. You catch more bees with honey than vinegar. Luckily there are more than one person working on an EA for this strategy and a lot of what you want will be in there.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
You don't understand why my rules are important. I was recently going to hire a member from FF forum to create an EA for me, but his restrictions were unreasonable and even invasive to a certain degree. I don't want to see that happen here.

Actually, I am already communicating with a professional coder regarding my EA recipe. Yes, I am willing to pay to hire someone to create it. And I am willing to allow people to use it freely.

I am not looking for a handout.

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Well i took my time and learned some MQL 5 my self... With some very little tweeking to the code and some "include" files we can use the script in MT5, just as in MT4.

Quick guide:

- Place the "mq4_mq5_bridge.mqh" file in .../MQL5/Include/" folder

- Place script in ".../MQL5/Scripts/" folder

- Load MT5

- Drag and drop script to chart or add a hotkey (for faster use).

It wont work without the "mq4_mq5_bridge.mqh" file. its the one that makes the magic happend and translate the MQL4 expressions to MQL5...

Since marked its closed, i cant test it yet. Ill wait for monday... Atleast not what i am aware about

My the pips be with you.

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Great work, thank you. I am using MT5 myself. Is the script working on the daily chart only? Will it always look 2 days back for finding the high/low?

--- 帖子 #634 ---
It should work on any TF, just as the MT4 version. As i can see in the code it looking 2 days back from Wedensday, using the daily frame, to find the high/low. I could tweek the code to also work on thursday and look 3 days back etc. But first i want to see it work in the comming week before putting to much time into it. This was the easy fix for MT5_v1

--- 帖子 #635 ---
I made manual backtest for 30 weeks. I could make some mistakes, but anyway it's showed some statistics.

25% fibo for entry, 50% fibo as SL, no TP (closing all orders 1 hour before market close), no BE.

Triggered order don't cancel opposite order. In other words, at one week you could get 2 SL in one currency. 1 by buy order and 1 by sell.

--- 帖子 #636 ---
The results are not bad. Though there is obviously some heavy drawdown at times.

I think an EA with a solid trade management system can potentially improve these results.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
I don't need your permission to do anything and I look forward to your efforts to stop me.  Unfortunately for you I do know about software copyright as I am an ex software copyright compliance lawyer having been in the industry for over 50 years, until I retired.  I have extensive software development and trading experience and the help I was going to give was free and unencumbered.  You will not get very far with your kind of attitude.

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Do you find it runs faster?

--- 帖子 #639 ---
not a bad result. with more tuning in the variable and pair selection, it can bring to the very good result.

I'll keep watching this interesting thread.

what happened to your Telegram channel and the Pivot EA? How did that go?

I know you think you know I don't own the rights to my EA recipe, but you are misinformed.

As a copyright lawyer, you should know that as soon a creative work is created, it is copyrighted by default, according to US copyright law. Unless its creator clearly states it belongs to the public domain.

I am very familiar with copyright law as I have had dealings with it on several occasions from people whom I had to file a DMCA against for attempting to steal written works from me and passing them off as their own.

If someone hires you to create an EA based on their trading recipe, then it's your code that is copyrighted. You have no rights to the idea (recipe) itself. It's not yours. You didn't create it. The person who created the recipe has full rights to it, and you must have that person's permission to use it, and if permission is given to you to use it, you must abide by the creator's terms of use or not use it.

--- 帖子 #642 ---
This is the most important info in this thread, Thank you .

Market is not always trending. Most of the time market is in range. Main question is which setup is better to use in the long term.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
As difficult as it may be for you to see, my attitude here is one of generosity.

I am willing to pay for something and distribute it freely! There is nothing selfish about that.

I just don't want selfish rules attached to the EA that place unreasonable restrictions on those who wish to use it.

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Yes, i think so.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Let me give you a little more info to help you understand my intentions here.

There is a guy on here whom I was going to hire to create an EA for me (based on another one of my ideas). He gave me a reasonable price, but what ruined things was he wanted to restrict my use of it by informing me I could only have a certain amount of accounts registered for it and that I would have to give him the MT4 account numbers I would be using it on.

That is unreasonable and unfair to me, unfair because it is my idea, and I was paying him to create an EA for it! If I had agreed to his terms, then that would mean I would have surrendered my rights to him, essentially enabling him to do whatever he wanted with the EA which housed my trading recipe. Without the recipe, the EA is useless.

That is the kind of thing I don't want to see happen here. Hence my reason for being firm about the terms of use for my trading recipe.

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Lets progress. I will see what we can produce before Wednesday. Just working on a script which can be run on each pair and will output values for a spreadsheet based on the basic rules. Trying to determine the efficacy of the system without using strategy tester which never works properly for me.

This is the first cut.  Cond... is where break above AND below are made.  I haven't full checked results but thought you might like it.

That's all I want. As long as it is in the spirit of giving, you are free to use the trading management recipe I shared here.

I just don't want people using my idea to take advantage of others or to profit from it commercially. That wouldn't be right, since it is meant to be FREE.

I will still hire the coder I am communicating with to create the EA, as he is a highly skilled coder whose work I have come to trust.

The bulk of the recipe came about as a result of many hours spent trading the Forex market. The rules require more than just putting up an EA on a chart and hoping things will work out for the best. It still requires a degree of technical analysis on the part of the user to know which rules to apply, where to apply them, and when to implement them. I even have a specially designed stop loss in there to deal with stop loss spikes (stop hunting) which often occur in the market.

The rules are formulated in such a way that the EA containing them can work with or without the OP's strategy. That makes it very powerful! As you are likely aware, EAs that are purely based on a specific strategy usually stop working at some point. To keep that from happening, my idea places more weight on the trade management side.

It even has rules to deal with FIFO and no hedging rules, which US citizens are unfairly subject to.

The only way the recipe will stop working is if the EA becomes outdated and isn't updated or if people are no longer allowed to trade using EAs. Otherwise, it is timeless.

--- 帖子 #648 ---
OK, so here is the thing with me. I am a visual person. I need to see the rules/settings in a script/EA and have some kind of control over which ones I want to use and when.

That is why my recipe is so important, because it enables the user to put thought into how he or she wants to utilize the rules, and even gives the user an opportunity to be creative in forming combinations of rules according to their own strategy.

It's Ok if people just want to put up a script and let the script do everything for them. But how long will that work? That question remains unanswered. My recipe, on the other hand, should always work. Whether it will be profitable or not depends on the decisions the user makes while using it. Success all depends on the conditions of the market and the user's knowledge of how to trade it.

I did notice one problem with the script, however. After placing it on the chart, indicators I had on the chart prior were removed from the chart. I don't know if the script is intentionally set up to do that, but this could be a problem for people who use indicators.

But I appreciate your effort!

--- 帖子 #649 ---
I think you misunderstand the script.  It doesn't do anything except show you IF the system will work.  It calculates the wins and losses based on the HI/Lo entry points and calculates on the Friday what the outcome is.  I don't usually bother with this sort of thing but as it looked good I thought I would do some deeper analysis.  Without to much analysis it looks like, based on the 4 pairs attached, this could be a good basic system.  Its possible to add in other filters.

Attached are 4 xls files and a new script which you can run on any pair.  All individually named.

If I build an EA which is likely as its so simple it will run on any/all of the 28 main pairs and I should have it done tomorrow.  You don't need to pay any money for someone to write it.

Give the script a run and see what your favourite pair gives you.

Hi thank you for this. Did you create the bridge file and is it specific for the MoTu script? Reason I ask is that I would like to convert another indicator I use on MT4 to MT5.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
No i didnt create the bidge file.

But you can just try add the include line in your indicator file, to see if it works.

--- 帖子 #656 ---
Hi Erebus. I do not seem to have the ability to PM. But thank you for all the work you have done here to refine and support this system. I jumped in quickly once I saw your shares and back tests and report 2 profitable weeks as a result playing with small peas. I am going to stop doing other stuff and focus on this get a lot of time back..my wife and I will thank you for the time . I kite surf at Sandgate which is near you. Would be great to catch up one day.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
It's an analysis based on the basic rules. If you totall up cols m, n, o you can assess profitability.

Not much point in investing time on something that doesn't look like it's going to work.

This one has promise.

Thanks for highlighting the file is created in the files folder.

The strategy tester can sometimes be problematic.

The script deletes All objects before running not any indicators. It should not be run on anything other than a spare chart for analysis purposes.

--- 帖子 #660 ---
OK guys, here's an indocator (MT4) that covers the strategy.

I can't claim credit for it as I found an indicator here on FF that was 80% there, and I simply amended it to conform to the strategy.

There're a couple of settings that control the colour of the breakout box depending on how big it is.  Currently it is set in pips, but I notice a few people have mentioned using ATR/ADR to determine whether or not a trade is advisable or not.  If some kind soul can explain how that works to me, I can try to add it into the indicator.

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Thanks I tried but struggling.

1) I am also not sure the script you converted is being picked up by my MT5. I followed your steps but MT5 did not create the item under the menu Insert>Script.

Is there a step missing?

2) Which website can I refer to to get the same learning as you to do these type of conversions and info on the bridge file?

Thank you for taking the time.

That is a lovely indi .. Thanks very much Paul.  that is all I needed   now I can trade manuallywith ease .. I am not a big EA user and don't rely on them.   It is just my personal confort level.

That looks like an older version see if you can see a later one.  I must put version numbers on them.  Col "O" should be negative.

Any problems let me know tomorrow and I'll have another look. Its bedtime here.  Market doesn't need to be Open.

--- 帖子 #665 ---
I'm sorry to disagree with you, but it seems that you are the one who is misinformed here.

Sure, if you create an EA (or get someone to create an EA for you) then you may own the copyright for that EA, i.e. no-one is permitted to sell, modify or distribute the EA without your express permission, but you do NOT own the copyright to the "recipe", as you put it, for two very good reasons:You cannot copyright an idea.  You can patent a design, but you cannot copyright an idea. Pretty much every one of the features that you have listed for your EA are already features in other EAs that are available in the public domain - they are not unique to you.  Heck, even my own EAs do most of what you've specified, and I wrote the code for those over the last couple of years...so by your logic, perhaps you owe me something for copyright infringement?

I am no expert on this matter. You might be right.

But I am interested in finding the answer to this. If I am proven wrong, then I will apologize.

I actually hope you are right, because then I won't have to care about it.

--- 帖子 #669 ---
I think we should just go back and focus on making pips using the original system as stated by the OP.  never mind any EA copy rights and patents, etc etc.  You guys are taking away from the main goal of the OP.  Just my 2 cents.  Don't mean to tell anyone what to do or say, but thought I would just put my thoughts on paper here

Enjoy trading and making pips, and just be happy pleeeeeeez

--- 帖子 #670 ---
I agree.

But an EA 'done right' will still be useful to all of us.

--- 帖子 #671 ---
Great effort from you,thank you so much, please I have some questions about this great easy to use indi.

1, Can I place the BUY and SELL order the same time?

2, I can see that the range zone shows to color please i need explanation about this

3, the BO means what? and the no Trade

4, Is there a specific time I should place trades?

5, Is there a specific timeframe that work with this indi

--- 帖子 #672 ---
1. Buy and Sell trades are dependent on your broker, not the indicator, think about it

2. There is a setting in that indicator that beyond which the box will colour, yours is probably set to 80 or 90. Also triggers the No Trade

3. Break Out, just to tell you the price range has been broken, observe the chart BEFORE the next BO

4. Wednesday is the basic time

5. No, you choose

Unfortunately your MT5 script does not work...any idea to fix it? I changed the "weekofday" to "1" (Monday), so it should place orders today based on high/low of Friday and Thursday.

--- 帖子 #679 ---
Hi guys. As I said early, I could make some mistakes in backtest. And I did it. On backtest I used spread on close market and it's more high as usualy in minimum 2x. My bad. Statistic must be more profitable if recalculate with normal spread.

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Thanks for sharing your hard work.

You will never convince me that counting pips is an accurate measurement of any system.

I would rather see the results as units or percentage, always take profit at 2 to 1, don’t take opposite sides trade when stopped out.

That’s just me...

PS: I looked a bit closer, obviously EURCHF is the worst pair ever, drop it. You have EURGBP in there, good, but you need to include the opposite of it GBPCHF, it will boost the pip count like GBPJPY, try that.

--- 帖子 #681 ---
I'm agree. Maybe on this weekend I'll re-backtesting with correct spread and all 28 pairs for more deeper statistic.

--- 帖子 #682 ---
Sounds good, but I would still leave out AUDNZD & EURCHF, but I guess, need to analyse, then drop them

Thanks

Erebus, start the thread fast. I cannot wait to learn more about price action from you. I m tired of reading about scripts and ea that might fail at any time.

Hi All,

One EA to place all trades required on Wednesday morning.  Each pair NEEDS ITS OWN CHART with the EA on it.

The system also creates Global Variables found under Tools.  This is to stop multiple entries and other stuff.  If you want to try it multiple times then delete the variable DrawHiLo and corresponding PAIR number.  Probably better just to try it on one or two charts then set up for Wenesday with the ones you want to trade.

The PAIR numbers do not correspond to your charts they are the numbers in the list below.

DEMO TRADING IS RECOMMENDED TO START I will not be held responsible for any errors or ommisions or any losses that you may incur.

I have modified my existing Basic system which I use for testing ideas and tested it as much as I can today.  It seems to be ok.

If you want to try it today change DayStart to 1.  It is set to default to 3 for Wednesday.

As I am only providing an .EXE , for various reasons, at this stage this is NOT modifiable.

I have a TradeManagement routine incorporated which at the moment is blocked off so we can think about that next version or so.

Lets get the basics working then I can enhance as we go.

Please, stop writing about your EA’s. We are missing real valuable information about this system. The main question is to find best entry and exit sittings that will be stable in long term. To find this we need to make backtest (I think 20 weeks is enough) using different sittings on each instrument.

--- 帖子 #688 ---
Sometimes one thinks that it may be more educational, indeed -profitable, if people forgot EA's and simply forward tested a few charts manually. Excuse my butting in Erebus. I am but an interested observer.

Perhaps a separate thread of EA experiments would be in order ?

--- 帖子 #689 ---
You only need this not a script.  This will setup the trades automatically for you etc. on Wednesday unless you try it as I suggested in original post.  I'm not really into scripts, do they run continuously or just the once you drag them onto a chart. I always thought it was the latter.  The EA goes in the Experts folder.

Let me know how you get on happy to help.

All "real valuable information about this system" is contained pretty much in the posts on the first page of this thread, so you shouldn't be missing anything.

If you don't want EAs or scripts or indicators for this system, just read the first few posts and off you go - ignore the rest.

You say to stop writing about EAs but then go on to request that we do 20 weeks of back-testing with different settings for each instrument...without an EA or a script of some sort, doing this manually would take a very long time.  Unless you have a better way and can do the 20 week back-testing for us and let us all know the results?

Thanks again for your hard work,

I will be testing this on my demo account

The tests I've done so far manually going back 15 weeks on all daily charts, The results look good,

In fact, The only way this failed  in my tests was when there was no order taken,

And when there was a fake spike on the Wednesday candles,

I think I will only trading on four pairs which I found to be extremely good,

GBP/JPY

GBP/USD

USD/JPY

EUR/AUD

I hope to put some my charts on showing my results.

And where I can I will help other people in the group.

PS, if this works out I will be looking to open a live account,

As anyone got any recommendations for which broker to use, .

So, I take it that's 2 wins and 3 losses, yes?

pips are not a good measure of profitability - through trade management, it's entirely possible to have a negative pip balance and yet be in profit and vice versa.  Profit % is the only real measure you should go by.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
GBPCHF ?

I assume those are pips? The worst way to measure, try using units.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Mate, don’t know how long you have been trading or using MT4, but on Daily chart the period separator has always been showing the months.

And if you did a visual backtest as you say you did, and didn’t stop to think how many days in a trading week (5),  or even drop to the 4 hour chart to check the day or the price or something, then I’m not sure what you were doing.

People complaining that discussion about EA or scripts is bothering them? Well, IMHO, that video is the biggest piece of thread pollution ever; I would never post something that showed my total ignorance of Metatrader charting, as you have done.

But, that’s me...

--- 帖子 #708 ---
The R;R are correct as long as you are entering at the first break of the Low or High. If you are trading the Entry Sell Stop and Entry Buy Stop breaks then you are no longer getting a true 1:1 rr....etc.

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Anyone given any thought to filters to try and trade the trend and also take profit strategy. Apologies if I have missed or forgotten a previews post. Both may be irrelevant.

--- 帖子 #710 ---
I think this strategy might be best served as a basket strategy. Enter as many pairs that you see fit per your pre trade entry analysis. Then once set up all your trades you then track your overall %'s and close them all at the same time once your overall TP% has been reached. Then be finished for the week and start again the following week.

--- 帖子 #711 ---
Not sure what you're referring to here, but the chart looks ok to me.

tes724 hasn't changed how it works, just tidied up the presentation.

--- 帖子 #712 ---
I'm not sure how else to put it. (not being rude)  There are 2 potential entries. 1) at the exact High or Low of the range....or.....2) at the "Entry Sell Stop" and "Entry Buy Stop". If you measure in pips the distance from entry #2 then the distance is not 1:1 r:r.   It is however 1:1 from entry #1.   I could be wrong, i've been wrong before. Just ask my wife.

--- 帖子 #713 ---
Details please and or screenshot

--- 帖子 #714 ---
As long as you keep SL to 0.5 it will follow as you move your entry and allways display the RR correct. Try messure the pips. I cant make it fail...

I would like to share another great tool with you, that adds more info to your crosshair.

It calculates estimated profit/loss for a giving lot size, just by dragging the pip distance.

- ProfitMeter.mqh (goes to the the ".../MQL4/Include/" folder)

Add indicator to the chart.

--- 帖子 #722 ---
UPDATE: MoTu_Fibo_Breakout_indi_v1.2

- Added the ability to turn of coloring of the boxes when it reaches max or min pip distance, set in the inputs.
Dont think it relevant for the strategy to color the box if it reaches a specific size. All JPY pairs get box sizes well above 100pips and will allways be marked as a "NO TRADE".

All these changes, is something that makes it better for my self and i will continue to evolve it until it fits my own needs. I just want to share my ideas, feel free to change anything that fits your own style and idea and puplish.

Tes, can u check your pm pls

Btw thanks for the indi works a treat..

--- 帖子 #724 ---
The intention of the colouring is to warn you when the range is either too large or too small.  You can remove the colouring simply by setting the min and max box sizes to zero and 1000.

I would prefer it to be in as I plan on adding the ADR/ATR check mentioned earlier in the thread as I think this would be a good visual warning when the range is getting too large.

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Thanks Mate..any plans on actually coding the ea to do backtest? Even though most times backtest can be useless but it can also help you gauge profitability.

--- 帖子 #726 ---
I have more or less given up on strategy tester.  I'm also not to sure how well it works with Pending orders.  The other bit of SL & TP would also need to be defined which for the first version I have left to the traders discretion.  That's  why I built the script to output spreadsheet data, which can be found in the folder Files.

I may give it a go but probably won't be today as I have a bit on.

Hello Paul

Thank you for the fibo indicator, I cannot work out why the indicator is showing one bar back as opposed to starting from 0 point on Monday.

Can you think of any reason, please see the chart

--- 帖子 #728 ---
What does it look like on the H1 timeframe?

--- 帖子 #729 ---
The same, shows one 1hr bar back

Normally there is no difference unless that one bar whether 4hr or 1hr has a higher high or lower low than the Mon-Tue range

--- 帖子 #730 ---
Sorry, I just realised that you're not using my indicator - that's the one from tes724.

@tes724 - could you take a look?

--- 帖子 #731 ---
This is how the same pair and periode look at my chart. Dont have to same problem..

Could be a broker issue - it looks like a spread betting account, which means the broker is manipulating the price and candles.

--- 帖子 #733 ---
Yes that is what I think, maybe the gap between Friday close and Monday open

--- 帖子 #734 ---
Gaps between Friday and Monday are not unusual probably more usual. What about Sunday candle they cause havoc with daily systems.

What is it you exactly want?

Something like this?

Only a test idea. Never thought of using indicators this way always used an EA. Don't worry where the lines are exactly drawn as its only Tuesday so its using Sun/Mon.

If its run tomorrow I hope they change.

I can modify tomorrow for you if you need more.

--- 帖子 #746 ---
This is where an EA that will allow trading only in one direction would come in handy. If AWR high is reached, then the EA could be set to only execute short orders, and vice versa. If neither one is reached, then the EA could be set to place a hedge trade, and cancel out the inactive order once one of the orders is triggered.

--- 帖子 #747 ---
You have a fundamental error in your EA.  Nothing to do with time or market.

I am thinking of just doing this on my own as there is to much fragmentation.

is there a way to remove the big BO letters and the NO TRADE! from the screen on the indicator? Would it also be possible to add an option to choose how many r:r levels we want to show? I think it would look much cleaner if these were options. Thanks for the indicator. It looks really nice.

Salut spike

Could you see again the code code of your EA SMC EA Basic Daily ?

Some pairs are correct (AUDUSD, EURAUD,etc.)

Other pairs displays the correct levels but no pending orders (AUDJPY, EURJPY,etc.)

Other pairs are totally wrong ( USDCHF,AUDCAD for instance is calculated on hilo of friday !!!)

But I like your EA

--- 帖子 #759 ---
Hi, Thanks for using the EA.  Yes I can see some errors and thank you for highlighting them, hadn't spotted them all as yet.  Some are caused by Order Opening Price precision so not getting set, thought I had solved that but just been looking at it again.  Shouldn't be to difficult to solve. Not seen the others yet but may be all linked.  I will update for next week and add in Filters (MA),TP and SL.  Also indicating ATR ranges for the week is another possibility. Anything else required please let me know.  Its better to have a phased approach so we can test it easily and I can spend some time over a period rather than trying to do it all in one go.  We have the capability to add anything in. It also give us the chance to forward test.

You may want to consider Gold and Oil and Natural Gas instead of currencies this week. Just my 2 cents

You don't really need the indicator that you're referring to - just use the Fibonacci Retracement tool in MT5 (it works the same way on both MT4 and MT5).

been testing the strategy for a while with money management. Last week risking 1 percent for each trade on 30 pairs plus xauusd, made 43 percent in one single week. my rules are like yours, i open position at 25 percent of the range a leave it open until friday at 20. when an asset reach my buy/sell stop i delete the other order. happy to try this week because probably ranges like this made only on monday and tuesday are the worst condition for this strategy because even if it takes the order, it's difficul to earn high rr. however would be interesting to see how this strategy reacts this week. will take you updated.

First here is an EA that will,I trust, open all Pending Orders for the 26 pairs its designed for.

I said I would use version numbers then realised you would have to go through the laborious task of re-adding to each chart.

There have been a few challenges in opening 52 simultaneous orders and I can't say I am 100% happy with the solution, although it certainly works.

Also once you have a Pending order for both Long and Short all you can do is wait for a break to go live.  You have therefore no further control, other than manual deleting the order, to decide if the break is real or if there is any trend or price has reached a resistance point ,pivots etc,etc. You name it its all out there.

This is what makes developing an EA very useful.  You have to think of ALL the eventualities because the computer won't do it for you and "rules is rules".

I'll leave it as it is for now and those interested in trying it can do so and we can think if this is the best way forward.   I am going to diverge slightly as I can code the differences in and use a another method of breakout.  I will let you know.

--- 帖子 #775 ---
I can't try it, then I would have to keep the computer on

--- 帖子 #776 ---
My PC's run 24*5 occasionally being turned off Sat/Sun, although they are on some of that time.

As per my note once the orders are placed they will be on the brokers server and then they will need to be monitored for any breakout as you would even if the orders were placed manually.  Would adding the stop losses and take profits help, perhaps. I could add that easily.

A better solution, to me, would be to define a breakthrough strategy of the upper/lower levels and then send an email.  First this would negate the massive order entry issues which I had, and resolved, and it would allow you to manage each trade as they happened.

--- 帖子 #777 ---
I have added SL & TP into the EA.  That means just run it , when all orders are opened turn it off.

I havent tested it yet and I am going to called for dinner.  I'll check back later.

[attach]I_Close I've just close this trade in profit, only manually trading these,

buy or sell when the body of the candle crosses the entry line.

I am not taking it when it is just the tale of the candle.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I've just closed all my other trade-in profit all manually,

I'm keeping this system very simple,

I draw two purple lines on the high and low on Monday and Tuesday,

it is then a waiting game, I wait till the body of the candle as crossed my purple lines,

I then place my trade 250 points from my purple lines.

I don't have to worry about canceling any other orders.

And only take four pairs which I have looked at since Monday

This is the first time I've done this. The profit was £207 that it till next Tuesday.

The only expert advisor I use is this one that puts my stop and takes profit

which I've already set up. Simple as that

Hi oxff,

I have dropped your shared script on chart , see attached, it putted different levels for entry (0%), i have dropped another script shared in this thread as well as an indi drops lines both have different entry points than yours, i am using Roboforex for test.  RoboForex server time differs from UTC by 2 hours (UTC +2), and in summer, with a switch to daylight-saving time, the difference equals to UTC +3.
TIA

--- 帖子 #781 ---
Hi Sangui,

Thanks for EA v1.4, forward tested on  several pairs but seems we should put different magic no. for each pair because it closed opposite side ( sell) for all pairs as soon as a buy order activated. it also won't accept adjustment for parameters like TP after running on chart, right? i initially inputted zero for TP then changed it to 100 but still closing with zero or minimal profits. TIA

--- 帖子 #782 ---
The tail and the body are not confirmed unless the candles closes, did you take that on a different timeframe than the Daily chart you posted?

Otherwise, you traded the price as the system requires.

Good one!

--- 帖子 #783 ---

its very time consuming for all of us to do this drill,i wish someone takes the lead and steer it,thanks

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Hi Mohsen-b,

I didn't continue developing the EA and didn't test what you say but with a quick look at the code I can see that I am checking for symbol in the IfOneSideOpenedCancelTheOther() function:

if(OrderMagicNumber() == MagicNumber && OrderSymbol() == Symbol()...

So I don't know why that would be happening.

You can try adding this line in the OnInit() to create a unique MN for every time you attach the EA: MagicNumber = WindowHandle(Symbol(),0);

If you do that also change the input MagicNumber by extern int MagicNumber;

About editing the parameters while the EA is running I didn't even know that was possible to be honest.

--- 帖子 #789 ---
My EA would have done the job and more. Unfortunately, I have nobody to build it, and I am not going to pay $300.00 dollars (what the coder wanted to charge me) to have it built.

--- 帖子 #790 ---
few traders can make a group and contribute to get the job done,u will get 30 traders easily to contribute at least 10 bucks each.

--- 帖子 #791 ---
Doubtful.

Hi Sangui,

Thanks for reply, but have no idea about coding, i wish you have time doing said adjustments, It is working good in back testing but not stable in forward so it would be good if be able to test it every day instead of waiting for next Wednesday by adding day parameter for trading.

--- 帖子 #798 ---
It seems to only want to open a limited number of trades. The problem lies in trying to open all 52 trades together. I think we have missed this week so I will test it over the next few days and see how to fix it.  How about only open trades when it crosses or open a pending order when it gets close, just to spread the load to the server.  I did say that I wasn't to happy with the solution and it still doesn't feel right.  Also I don't like the breakout strategy as it doesn't take into account any or lack of momentum.  It may just touch and return rather than break through.  We should look at a lower timeframe to see what is happening possibly the hourly.  I like the idea of this as it gives some evidence of buying or selling pressure.  I will be back if you want me to continue.

--- 帖子 #799 ---
spike...the code of SMC EA Basic is working for the most of pairs

so I don't understand why the code is not working for the others ????

Your EA is perfect to me.....currently it opened 4 trades according to the rules

so you have to check AUDUSD,AUDCAD,EURAUD,USDCHF...

about TP and SL , we'll see later

maybe if you can provide the mq4 , we'll be able to help you

Hi zoraxfx,

Thanks for the reply and sorry for the error.  It does work except I had put a line of code in to stop it trading while I tested it.  It kept opening hundreds, i mean over 450 orders, while I was running it so I needed to pause it while I cured the issue.  I think its ok now but will use the next 2 days to thoroughly check it.  While I am doing that you could let me know what you want for StopLoss and Profit levels.  Do you also want One Order Cancels the other.  Anything else?  A Moving Average filter.  I use weighted and weighted close which is very close to a standard deviation model, although it doesn't repaint its very close over 6 bars.

I happy to continue as this is different to my other ideas and gives me some learning opportunity.

PS I have also added a facility to CLOSE ALL orders Buys,Sells, BUYSTOP, SELLSTOP by setting the CloseALLOrders GlobalVariable found in the Tools menu.

--- 帖子 #801 ---
In the list of 'rules' that you specified, number 1 IS pretty much linked to this strategy.

Regarding the rest of the rules - these are purely trade management functions, and there are many trade manager EAs out there that do all of these things and more.

Nothing you have suggested is 'powerful'.

--- 帖子 #802 ---
So far so good GBP pairs are working for this strategy this week

--- 帖子 #809 ---
Well with this week's experiment Monday and Tuesday trading Wednesday now behind us.

There were 7 pairs that I picked out that did not break the Monday Tuesday entry lines,

what I notice with these seven pairs only two of them broke the Wednesday candle.

Perhaps in future for those of us who are manually trading. We could put lines on the high and low of the  Wednesday candle, just to give us something to do.

AUD/USD

EUR/AUD

GBP/JPY

USD/JPY

EUR/GBP

AUD/JPY

EUR/CHF

PS

I don't count the Candlewick as a breakthrough.

--- 帖子 #810 ---
It's nasty comments from people like you that is making me strongly consider leaving this forum.

Yes, there are other EAs out there, loaded with all kinds of unnecessary stuff. But this EA idea of mine has the right combination of rules, making it simple and effective. And that does make it powerful. You just don't see that because you don't understand it.

There are also conditions in this EA that I have not seen in other EAs, such as the candle body close stop, which by the way, is a very powerful stop loss. But you don't see that, because you don't understand how useful a stop loss of this kind is and how much more effective it is compared to a basic stop loss.

Now instead of giving snide remarks, why don't you do something productive, like provide a real solution for the people in here who are looking for a trustworthy EA to use with this strategy? I haven't seen you do that yet.

--- 帖子 #811 ---
Exactly my earlier point.  If you don't have any consideration of Momentum or this area may be a point of Resistance Hi's but no closes above then you are asking for he price to fall back.  This is something to consider adding, IMHO.

I didn't think that my comments were "nasty", but it would seem I was wrong.  In fact, I thought I was rather restrained and polite!  But, if you think my comments really were nasty, then you haven't been on the internet for very long have you?   In which case, maybe you should leave?

There you go again with the "powerful" claim. Seriously?  Candle body close stop?  Again, nothing new - and yes, I DO understand how this works - I have coded the very opposite for entries into my EA, thank you.  You haven't define anything in your list that I haven't seen in other EAs.

As for not being productive, I think the glass houses rule applies here - you haven't contributed anything except bleat on about your precious copyrighted EA that you have no idea how to create.  Meanwhile, I have provided a very useful indicator to this thread, and I also have an EA already coded which I will be sharing shortly. Feel free to sue me when you see that it contains some of your allegedly "copyrighted" ideas.

Hi Spikehunter Your EA is working very well except a few pairs.

So you need to check these pairs and use a magic number to choose a SL and a TP according at each pair.

About the filters, it's to difficult to code. Every trader will choose his own one.

Good luck.

I think this one is a good EA if the mistakes about a few pairs are corrected.

After , every trader can choose his own filter.

About SL and TP , a possibility is to use the EA below attached at a graphic.

The EA closes the trades if the difference between balance and equity is reached.

It's as a TP or a SL but for the open basket.

--- 帖子 #836 ---
Thanks for the reply. I have just about finished a correction. Its been an interesting problem to solve especially with a long and short order involved. I'll test again some time tomorrow and post the version over the weekend. Don't know if you saw the spreadsheet example I posted with all the pairs opening values etc. I'll have a look at the EA you sent me to see how we can potentially use the ideas.

Not my job  China got Coronavirus, California declare emergency, FF goes crazy

My best update is, as Rule 1, Don’t lose any money = “ I didn’t lose any money “

I am using 10% / range as my entry, yes, 25% would keep me out but...

Anyway, couple of trades entered, stalled, then went to stop loss

Pretty sure they are reading my data, see the chart

The rest of trades stayed around break even, half up, half down.

I woke at 4 am, saw that I could get out with no loss, so exited all trades.

The GBP up move and CAD down saved me, yes , they might go further.

Anyway, flat now, just observing NFP and try again next week

Stay sane folks

Result so far with SL at BE or Better for those in profit.

I have had a loss on EURAUD but this was covered by GC and GU. I re-entered GC and GU as I liked the potential in these pairs so the entries her will look off. Going for 100% on them.

Not sure what to do yet about those pairs that did not get triggered, also conscious of NFP tonight. Thought they will serve well for the monthly strategy.

Will post the closed trades next.

Well done, thank you for sharing.

I notice the position size is all the same; if you have an Android device, may I suggest the Forex Calculator app from the Google Play store

It will calculate the proper lot size by either dollars to risk or percentage to risk; you need to input the pair, the entry & stop loss price.

Good luck

Hi PhillipmC

My setting as like as @Erebus's method, I use daily chart to determind the trend before put order

Yup Bro

IC market is good broker, I used their platform for 3 years ago

--- 帖子 #881 ---
Excellent results. Can you share your EA settings?

--- 帖子 #882 ---
My results this week:

Submitted 27 orders (I missed off EURUSD by mistake!...would be nearing TP1 by now! )

17 triggered.

2 x 1% losses

7 x break even

7 x 1% wins (so 5% up for the week)

1 trade still running at just under half risk.

Total pips this week so far: 591

EDIT: final trade got stopped out for 0.5% loss - so 4.5% for the week - I'm happy with that!

--- 帖子 #883 ---
For gauging the true profitability it's best to ignore pips and concentrate on the % profit.

If you've used fixed lots for every pair, you need to work out how many 1:1 wins and 1:1 losses you have had.

For example, in your case, it looks like you had 5 wins, 1 loss and 3 roughly break-even. So all told, you're looking at 4% gain for the week if you'd risked 1% per trade...pretty good!

--- 帖子 #884 ---
would u please guide us as what script or EA you are using and how you are setting it up on 28 pairs,thanks.

--- 帖子 #885 ---
Hi Rob and PaulDV

I used the SMC EA Basic Daily with default settings (post #685)

Unfortunately the EA is not working correctly with a few pairs but Spikehunter is going to correct that.

On the graph, le grey dotted lines are the hi lo monday-tuesday , le blue line the buystop and the red line the sellstop.

No luck with EURAUD because the sellstop has been reached for only 3 pips: it's the main loss of the basket.

Without this one, the results would have been excellent.

Next week, I'm going to set a SL = (Hi-Lo)/2

--- 帖子 #886 ---
Yeah, EURAUD was one I was stopped out on as well.  It spiked into the trade.  My EA (which I really must finish!) caters for this, so would not have entered, but, there you go.

Still a good week though.

--- 帖子 #887 ---
Interesting, what was the trend for the GBPUSD before this week according to your determination?

What are your rules once you “know” the trend? I am assuming that you only trade in the direction of the trend.

Did you take any trade in GBPUSD? EDIT; checked your results, you had 2 Buy trades for GBPUSD, please explain the trend thing!

Thanks

I was looking at this particular broker,

As you run a live account can you tell me how long is it before they stop the trial,

where you can use smaller amounts to trade with?

Hi Spikehunter

Just wondering how the EA is coming along

I know you said you are very busy and not got time to draw lines,

I was just wondering if you could build into the EA the ability to pick your own pairs

so if you only wanted to trade with just four pairs you would have that option.

--- 帖子 #890 ---
Just put 4 charts that you want and add the EA to them.  It needs a chart to run. I have a new version coming out over the weekend.  I'm frantically trying to test it before the market closes.

zoraxfx,  I have changed to put stops at 50% of range for you.

--- 帖子 #891 ---
This looks ok

Recommended use. Add chart set it up how you like then add EA.

Today it will automatically run.  Next week it will wait until Wednesday to run them all.

Can someone at least try and try it before market closes today on any pairs that have not traded this week.  USDCAD is one.

If you have multiple charts setup already, best to clear them before Wednesday.

I always have 26 up as I run other strategies as well.

Many thx for this good job

I checked quickly and the EA seems to set the levels correctly but we need use it absolutely wesnesday morning to check with safety.

I noticed that EURGBP is displaying the good levels but no pending orders.

Maybe in your next version could you set a configurable TP and a SL .

How is working exactly the trailing stop ? in pips ?

--- 帖子 #894 ---
Manual entries?

Thanks

Regards

--- 帖子 #895 ---
Just traded your script this week, although it was not executed properly on some pair due to late execution. Below are the results, entry was taken at 15%.

Pips gained

Crude Oil  +258

EURAUD   -204  (If entry was at 25%, this trade would not have initiated)

GBPJPY   -71  (If entry was at 25%, this trade would not have initiated)

GBPUSD   +93

GBPCAD   +206

AUDNZD   -68  (It touched 25% level but chances are there that this trade was not initiated due to spread, still we consider it)

AUDCAD   +16

EURUSD    +90

EURCAD    +163

USDCHF    +115

EURGBP    -65   (Wrong trade initiated, it did not cross Motu Hi Lo)

GBPNZD    -184 (Wrong trade initiated, it did not cross Motu Hi Lo)

CADJPY     +95

AUDJPY     +16 (Wrong trade initiated, it did not cross Motu Hi Lo)

NZDJPY     -24 (Wrong trade initiated, it did not cross Motu Hi Lo)

NZDUSD    +2

NZDCHF    +5 (Wrong trade initiated but it touched 25% entry and it would have been little loss trade)

NZDCAD    +25

ETHUSD     -9

NET GAIN = 595 Pips

If entry were at 25% and wrong trade are excluded, results would be much better.

Thanks.

Nice array of trades there - crude oil is interesting!

If you had risked 1% on each trade, how much would you have gained for the week?

--- 帖子 #897 ---
updating you on current week, i closed all the trade before nfp because it seems like gambling. and in my trading plan i do not trade with news that important. so for next months, i will close the trades before nfp. how ever got loss on audnzd, it was special, 1 pips in profit and then back to sl. so -1% on that, then i got other trades and ended all the week with + 3%. pretty cool right??

btw last week i made 43 % with this strategy so this week's percentage seems very small, but if this strategy can work well even in this condition it's a very good sign. how ever at the beginning of the week i put like 40 orders and only 7/8 was executed so it was very choppy market but very profitable. hope everybody is making money and really thank the creator of this strategy to share this content with us.

It can't open a pending order if price has already passed the required entry price hence the 130 error.  Sorry but as I don't normally share my ea I know what this means without further explanation. I did suggest trying on a pair that hasn't traded.  Thanks for the feedback.

--- 帖子 #900 ---
Hi zoraxfx

Not sure why eurgbp I will have a look.

How do you want the configurable SL & tp to work.

There isn't any trailing stop yet.

We are getting to the difficult bit of money management.

My approach with my other systems is to set a SL & tp which I think are sensible and then manually adjust if I am around., if not then I take the hit or the money.

I run a 1hr and 15min system and both use the daily atr. So daily open +- atr becomes tp. SL is variable.

As with most stuff this is an area I am still working on.

--- 帖子 #901 ---
Spikehunter Is it possible for sl to be in a designated place not in pips but in cash? I would like sl to always have a value of, for example, 10 or 20 dollars and let EA calculate how much pending order must be. is it 0.01 or 0.02. For example, gbp jpy sl 10 dollars will be 0.01 and eur usd EA will calculate that 10 dollars it must be 0.02 lots.I would always like to lose the same amount

--- 帖子 #902 ---
Great work brother. This is what I got when I applied the EA on UCAD. The TPs are different from the rules. Attached Image

Can you check again pls?

--- 帖子 #903 ---
Hi zoraxfx

Just tested EURGBP.  It does open trades, just takes a few seconds.  I have had to build in a delay between sending orders to ensure the broker server doesn't get overloaded which produces a "context error" error.

You are right we should check Wednesday and probably only on a few high volatile pairs but that of course is down to you to do.

I am just trying to  tidy up the error messages as well.

--- 帖子 #904 ---
TO ANYONE TRYING MY EA.

PLEASE BE AWARE that as this depends on the EA running on Wednesday morning, today it will today be calculating hi/lo based on the last 2 days.

At this stage in its development these are the little things that can trip you up. Its why I ask for others to test as I may miss these.

So far so good.

New version out NOW.

Spikehunter please answer to post 903 thanks

--- 帖子 #906 ---
I have just realised why EURGBP and other pairs might not open.

I use some interesting code (my own design) to control multiple pairs by using GlobalVariables.  These can be found under Tools menu.  These need clearing out as I use them to stop multiple orders and to maintain system integrity.  I have added a script which will do this.  Just make sure you turn "AutoTrading" OFF before so as not to recreate the orders until you are ready.  Like most bits of software there is a process.

I will address this by Wednesday next week so its a seamless operation

--- 帖子 #907 ---
Yes. that's something I have been working towards for my other systems where I can specify a % of my account that I am prepared to risk and calculate lot size on where SL is.  Leave that with me as it might take me day or two to do but a great suggestion.

--- 帖子 #908 ---
Just put that EA on the chart and everything seems to be working okay,

I see you having a discussion about the stop loss and  lots size,

Are you building this so it will have some money management built-in,

or will you have an option to change lots size and stop-loss.

Please note what he said - TP is 100 points

If and when you understand the Fibonacci Tool, it doesn’t calculate in pips but Percentage

Therefore, a 1 to 1 Take Profit of the “range” measured from Entry to 50% stop loss, will be exactly that same number of pips

On your chart, the prices - High Entry 1.34593 - Stop Loss 1.33760 = 0.00833 pips (notice, NOT 100 pips)

Add that to the High Entry 1.34593 + 0.00833 = 1.35426 which is exactly what is on your chart

Another thing for you to check, the accurate placement of the Fibonacci Tool to the actual high and low

I suggest drop down to the 1-hour chart to see this in fine details

Study the charts below, cheers

In reference to the last post, notice how USDCAD is stuck in the range?

Something to consider when there are multiple opportunities on CAD pairs, check the OIL price

Check the news, e.g. OPEC meeting failed  = CAD weak

Generally, CADJPY is a great pair, but now NZD is the strongest

I’m sure you can work it out

If I have say a buy stop order in above the Mon Tue range how can I have a stop loss attached to it when or if the entry triggers and I have the computer turned off.

Say I want the stop down at the 50% range.

cheers.

--- 帖子 #913 ---
Well TP was not fixed in some of the trades, its a small live account so risk was more than 1% in each trade, with these results net gain is around 11% in this week.

--- 帖子 #914 ---
We are not mind readers, but let’s assume that you are using Metatrader 4

When placing a pending order, the options are there to include the take profit and stop loss price also

When you place the order, it is held on the brokers server, you can turn off your computer.

I suggest that you read the User Manual, very throughly, okay?

And don’t believe random people on the forums, take responsibility

Have a nice weekend

Salut Spikehunter

Votre EA est un excellent outil pour moi.

Personnellement j'aime le SL chez (Hi-Lo) / 2

mais peut-être que d'autres commerçants souhaiteraient un autre niveau.

C'est pourquoi tout le monde doit pouvoir choisir ses SL et TP for every pair.

But you can keep the option SL = (Hi-Lo)/2 by default.

Mes suggestions pour la prochaine version:

--- 帖子 #919 ---
Your entry is on 10 or 25%?

--- 帖子 #920 ---
I set pending orders for all 28 pairs, and treat them as a basket, but some are being more focused - it all comes down to your personal risk profile really,

--- 帖子 #921 ---
Total PnL A$168.46 or 191 pips accross 9 pairs that triggered. I avoided CHF pairs but want to understand why other members here triggered so many more trades and pips. My entry was set at 15% and 50% TP although at times I adjusted to a sensible weekly pivot.

--- 帖子 #922 ---
25%

I upload screenshot with all pending orders at every wednesday. Lastest is here.

--- 帖子 #923 ---
Basket is not the right description IMHO

Usually a basket is opening all trades at the same time

Maybe more like a portfolio if your TP is open

But for me, better to trade individually, say 1 pair might open Wednesday and hits take profit, could be going back down when other trades are activated on Thursday or Friday

Know what I mean?

--- 帖子 #924 ---
Could be really interesting have a kind of dashboard with a Pin for this system filter... Many dash are ready and free but entry criterial (Pin) is to develop....

Dashboard could be useful for basket trading in terms of Tp Sl and to drive trades in to major profit...

Tell us more, or show us how

TP was set at 100 just to get something on the chart.

When using a PC to set up trades rather than a tablet it's easier to move SL & TP to where you really want them. On screen drag and drop, especially the latter.

This strategy is based on the price action of Monday and Tuesday, that's fair enough. The MM, to me, is a wet finger in the air, apologies to OP, with no consideration of likely support, resistance when setting SL & tp. To me the exit is the most important part of any strategy and shouldn't be nieve or contrived.

Set the orders and then manage the stops accordingly.

As an example  I have a couple of strategies that are intraday. I know that the open plus the daily atr is a good place for TP. A high percent of days price will stick around this value.  Not all, some don't reach some go past, but as a rule of thumb for an unmanaged trade it is a good point. This is not nieve or contrived but analysed.

I could go on.

I'm happy to put the defaults into the ea for those that can use it plus other requests but I recommend that are a starting point.

The other area is position sizing which I hope to add shortly.

Trailing stop, at the moment I don't have any view. I don't really like them, I prefer to manage trades from a lower tf.

Erebus thanks for the clue to risk same % of portfolio on each trade. Yes yes yes lesson to remember same lot size on diff cc’d pairs does not result in the same risk on each!

--- 帖子 #929 ---
I mean instead of AN Ea for every simple pair, a kind of pin that for every pair is able ti check condition and place orders in a same way as Ea or script di right now.

With dash we could have some effort in control and trade management....

Hi, this is for MT5..

original mq5 is from https://www.mql5.com/en/code/20059 It has more to offer but it makes my MT5 freeze and does not respond if i were to change the indicator properties visualization of timeframes after the indicator is run..

enjoy..

--- 帖子 #934 ---
If at the end of the program there is a .MQ4 it is because it is for mt4, if it were MQ5 it would be for mt5.

This is the source code of the program, you have to compile it before using it.

This serves to show the days of the week of the candles, put in the daily chart that you will see, for each candle a day of the week.

Interesting table.  How about trend filter as well.

--- 帖子 #942 ---
My broker is Forex.com, which is GMT-0. so there is a two-hour Sunday candle. Will this confuse the EA?

--- 帖子 #943 ---
Thats the same as mine. I sincerely hope not. Its an interesting question and I think we need to find out what the OP originally said. Was it Mon/Tues analysis from USA or UK or somewhere else. What difference does it make, any or none? I honestly don't know. It may mean we get different results from those using this system.  Looks like the OP is Canadian based.  The pairs are predominately GBP.  I guess UK start is the best so GMT would be a good shout.

--- 帖子 #944 ---
Please name the method of trend filter, an example of how that could possibly improves results.

Exactly what is the trend filtering out, or in?

Asking for a friend.

--- 帖子 #945 ---
I think this method should be traded as a "basket" or "notabasket" as Erebus puts it. Either way, I think if we trade a number of pairs and set individual TP's and SL's on each just as we are now, but also have an overall TP% for the "notabasket" If any pair hit's their individual TP and the overall % has not reached our set TP% then we let all the pairs remain open.....but once the overall basket reaches our set TP% or SL% then we close everything at once. If you wanted I guess you could close all of them except for the strongest trending pair or one that you feel you can get more profit out of, but in the long run I think doing this might bite you in the butt. Setting a TP% for the week imo is the way to go. Really no need to be going for +50% profit from 28 pairs each week.....2.5%/week overall is plenty!

--- 帖子 #946 ---
Certainly looking forward to a “not-a-basket” trades in action

What your saying is, there could be a runaway trade on Wednesday, makes 2.5%, close all trades, ignore any further entries on Thursday and Friday, sit back and read reports of people making 40% or more...

Hands up everybody that’s happy with doing that

--- 帖子 #947 ---
Exactly! I can understand if your account is small to be more aggressive but as the account gets bigger you will be satisfied with 10%/month. You can always choose 1 or 2 pairs if you really like the PA, Strong/Weak of the pair......obv MM is up to the trader.

Because I’m a “trend” trader

And curious to know how a trend filter could possibly improve on this method

You must have seen at least one situation where it prevented a loss, or is it pure conjecture from other methods?

For example, if price is in a down trend, last week was a successful short trade, this week is another successful short trade, was a trend filter useful in this situation?

Another example, if price is in a down trend, last week was a successful short trade, this week there is long entry on the chart, do we ignore this signal? Price continues to rise and it would have been a successful long trade; how was a trend filter useful in this situation?

I’m not making this up, check the chart for GBPUSD, or I can post it if you can’t see it.

People are making all these suggestions without any supporting evidence, without any actual examples; just saying a trend filter MIGHT help, and everyone gets excited like all the other threads, oh yeah, we need an INDICATOR

Good luck

I don't need to provide evidence it is well known that trading with the trend is the more successful way.  My other systems improved in performance overnight with this change. I will probably add it as an option in the ea and make it configurable.

--- 帖子 #954 ---
Well said.

--- 帖子 #955 ---
You just proved my point, when trading with the trend, using only the price as the entry method, with this system, there is success

But nobody needed a FILTER to help them

You never answered my questions, only changed the topic to strength indicator and rate of change, plus more unsubstantiated claims of improved performance

What the heck are you talking about?

--- 帖子 #956 ---
I think that if the market doesn't go over 240p.

Up to 100p a partial with a BE of  50% ou 1.618 can be used and an objective at 100%.

I have noticed that any pairs are still on sideway from last week, it may be triggered anytime if I keep buy stop/sell stop for next week.

Anyway, it can not be called simple Monday-Tuesday strategy!

--- 帖子 #961 ---
I agree with many traders here. We have to consider this system as a basket.

Without filters, there will be a few losing pairs and more winning pairs ...i hope

So I suggest a SL for every pair and a global TP for the basket with an EA as this one below

maybe can it include in the final EA by Spikehunter ?

Hello to all

I add the possibility of closing the current order on Friday at the time you have decided. Here it's 5 p.m. London time.

Just set closingOrder to true or false to deactivate it.

it can be useful for backtests.

The settings presented here allow for a 1: 2 RR with an entry at 15%.

For the stopLoss it is - 50

Good end of WE.

Cheers

[quote=zoraxfx;12798247]@ transmat many thx for your contribution this system sounds good Strategy Tester Report MoTu_System_v1.4_Close_Friday GlobalPrime-Demo (Build 1260) SymboleEURUSD ]

Thank you zoraxfx but the real designer of the EA is sangui (see in the first posts).

I only added a few lines of code to close the current trade on Friday if desired.

However, I draw attention to a few points:

The backtest presented is attractive but the stoploss is not positioned on Hi Lo / 2 and displaying 100 for the TP, it does not respect the RR 2:1

For the stoploss, do not forget to display the minus sign (-) in front of 50.

I put 130 for the TP because the entry being at 15% of the box it is necessary to add them to the value of the stoploss which is here 50 (in%) the whole multiply by two to obtain RR 2:1.

If you want to enter with 25% you will have to display 150.

The results on the eurusd will be less spectacular but the DD will be lower.

We could therefore increase the size of the position to 0.15 and it will give this:

I hope all traders read the Davit Pivots thread ?

https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...9#post12798429

I got banned there because I couldn’t post weekly gains as they used to do

I never could see the logic of continually selling or buying at a level, while price was moving AGAINST YOU

Guess that’s why I’m a breakout trader, go with the flow

Hope you are too, and today is another great reason not to trade Monday and Tuesday

--- 帖子 #988 ---
I have no tolerance for any of his stuff.

The market maker actively moves the Algo, searching for stops...long term stops get taken out undercover of news ...or at least that's my theory.

The Covid 19 was a perfect medium to take out those positions and plant new ones...

On the EURSD thread March 3rd I posted a chart showing a 3 year low taken out by just a few pips, then showed where the current stops are..... no comments, completely ignored of course, people shouting its going lower....nope...the stops are right there, plain as day.

Over on another thread a group have also been wiped out by following the guru...

--- 帖子 #989 ---
Market has opened with some very big gaps.  It made me think on how we should handle these.  We generally ignore Sunday bars, there are only 2 so that's probably the answer for the time being. Suggestions please.

I have tested this as much as possible and I am confident its ok.   As I said I will try next week to add some more functionality.  If you use a PC with a full sized screen I have a dashboard which I will also add to the EA to manage the trades. I did load a screen shot some time ago and if any one is interested I will reload it again, probably Tuesday.  I have changed the TP to the OP original 50% above/below break out levels and SL is set at 50% Hi/Lo.

You can test it by changing the daystart to anything below 3.  Just try it on one or two pairs but don't forget to set it back on every pair you change.

Going forward I am going to add in lot size calculation based on account balance and risk appetite and make the SL/TP's configurable.

I also like the basket percentage close idea so that could be optionable.

Its not been a good weekend for me, I trust you all had better ones, but I look forward to next week with optimism

Any errors you notice please let me know and I will correct before Wednesday Open.

If I have upset anyone over the last couple of days please accept my apologies.

--- 帖子 #992 ---
ezmonyfx Have you put your template on this thread it looks good

--- 帖子 #993 ---
I look to the left at the Daily tops and bottoms that have not been taken out...two or three close together shows where the Algo enticed traders to leave some cash.

Once price action has taken out the stops, what do they leave, fresh stops with fresh money... never ending circle.

In times of big news, Tsunami, Covid 19, Nuclear blow out they move the Algo to take out long term stops, almost a runaway market, creating new stops as they do so. There is always money left behind ready for another rainey day!

No amount of fibs etc drawn on a chart is going to help. Catches up with everyone eventually using those methods.

Again, just an agreement in response to Erebus, not looking to discuss for or against here.

Edit

Watching then take out a stop by a fraction of a pip has shown me how the game works. Thanks to George on that one.

I really want to remind everyone who is waiting for the appearance of new EA here. As you can see, they work on the principle of "day of week = 3" - this is wednesday, closing all orders on friday is "day of week = 5", with hours to close or open orders is the same things.

This is not cleary right when you start testing it in the strategy tester. There are holidays on the market.

For example, there may be no open market on wednesday at all, only monday, tuesday, thursday and friday. And It happens that there is no friday, i.e. the EA will not close orders on friday, because friday as market day can be absolutly absent. Or market may close earlier on friday, and if you decide to use setting for close orders 1 hour before market closes on friday, you may get into a very unpleasant story.

Please be careful when using EA and when you are testing strategies. This can significantly distort the results in one direction or the other.

Okay, let’s solve this puzzle together, you’re in Nigeria, you have computer, you have internet

I assume you went to school, and that you did mathematics there?

So if, High is  = 1 and Buy Entry = High +0.15, we get = +1.15

Therefore, Buy Entry to 50% = 0.65

Add 0.65 to 1.15 = +1.80

So if, Low is = 0 and Sell Entry = Low -0.15, we get = -0.15

Therefore, Sell Entry to 50% = 0.65

Subtract 0.65 from -0.15 = -_____

Are you with me, no more pictures until you solve a simple math

Hi oxff,

Most weeks have a Wednesday and a Friday in them :-)  I know what you mean.

Its an important point and it goes along with what to do with Sundays bars and Gaps like this week.

Most Bank Holidays in the UK are actually Mondays which could have an effect.  I can't think of many that would effect Wednesday or Friday except Christmas and New Year.  I realise other countries will be different.

I think that the user using the EA has to take some responsibility for when to use a system.  I wouldn't be running over any holiday period.

Using an EA is a RISK at anytime.  I like this strategy because you set the orders and then you can manage them manually.  As per my other note part of my EA will be a dashboard to show open orders and their performance.  Just want to get the basics done first.

I suggest we just keep forward testing which will prove the strategy and the EA's capability.

--- 帖子 #1021 ---
You have a very valid point.

I write EA's not quite all day long and I have had some horrible ones with massive losses due to programming errors.

This system however is fairly stable as it only places Pending Orders which can be checked quite quickly and there is a margin of price movement before they are executed.

It's everyone's own choice.  I like the challenge of writing different code.

P.S. The EA captures data for the week and can be output to a spreadsheet.  I am happy to do this for this week and going forwards if you want it.

Just let me know what data you want and I'll make sure its in their.  At the moment we have Hi,Lo HiBreak,LoBreak, FriClose, I will add sl & tp.

Hi redfan,

Have a look at this and see what you think if you have time.

You need a full screen for this.

You need to put  a chart up then add the blank indicator and EA.

It will give information on current positions and a way of navigating via buttons.

It does have trading and MM capabilities but I have disabled them as they don't follow the current rules.

Just R&D at the moment.  Open a trade add sl & tp and it will display position.  It will also show pending with a "T"

--- 帖子 #1024 ---
Oxff is right; here is the reworked EA to be able to choose the day on which open orders are closed; in "day of the week" display 3 for Wednesday, 4 for Thursday or 5 for Friday.

But the best as Spikehunter suggests in a short week is to do nothing and go on vacation   ;-)

Good luck friends.

--- 帖子 #1025 ---
Exactly, the difference between High and Low is the 1 to the 0

So you will see that difference in the levels, although sell side is negative

eg. -0.80 / +1.80 and so on -1.45 / +2.45

add as many levels as you like, +0.65 and -0.65 each time

Very good

I would think the important stats to keep would be.....size of range, if SL was hit or not, if TP was hit or not (clarify if it was 1:1 or 2:1 etc... I personally use % for everything but that isn't how this thread has been keeping track of wins and losses),  broke and retraced to other side before reaching 1:1, what % the range was compared to the AWR at the start of Wednesday.

I have tested many times and it looks ok.

The button CloseALL does exactly that. ALL trades will be closed.

Trades will open it may take a few seconds minutes depending on how many charts etc. If you put the EA up overnight it should all be working tomorrow.

There is a mechanism which stops multiple trades occurring during the week if you were to test and/or close early. In the GlobalVariables each pair has a number and a value. OpenLongTime is the Weekly time similar for short. There is some duplication here with LongOpened etc but that doesn't affect the way teh EA works. I will look to remove this next versions.

I was going to add an option to specify What Day/ What Hour to close but setting that up requires the user to enter a GlobalVariable. It can be done if anyone wants it and knows how to access through Tools menu. For now its the button.

I won't have time to develop and test position sizing and basket closing but will do that next. The spec will be a configurable % of Account Balance etc. I'm also looking at SET files, never used them but I think Globals are easier to use. They re right there every time on the menu under Tools. Yes I know I have repeated that.

As always please test on a demo chart(s) always better to use 3 or 4 to check for any errors before tomorrow. Don't forget to set and reset startdate to reflect its not yet Wednesday. e.g set to 2 and then back to 3 when finished.

May have been a bit pedantic but just making sure I pass all the info over.

Good Luck

Howdy,

Erebus guided me to this thread, and his passion for this trading method was over 9000 - I checked it out and decided to make some tools for him ready for when he gets his computer going.

For me - it is 2 birds with one stone, as I have an extensive trade library that I needed to do some work on, so I used this trading strategy as a "guinea pig" for developing the library - since it is nice and mechanical.

There seems to be some EA's n things being passed around in this thread, so I am a bit late to the party, but to my understanding most of the tools are for MT4.

My contribution today is for MT5. I can compile these to MT4 as well, but I don't want to step on anyone's toes here since I can see SpikeHunter already put something together.

Erebus refers to this method as the WTF method (Wed, Tues, Something something) ... so I just stuck with that.

The indicator: WTF Helper.ex5

Will mark the mon-tues high low levels from Wednesday. Works on all time frames.

There is a simple candle marker that you can turn on/off. It will mark candles that close on one side of the channel and close on the other... indicating a possible Mon-Tues breakout.

Just a nice quick visual aid.

The Expert: WTFTrader.ex5

As I mentioned earlier, I was using this system to work on a trade library that has a lot of tools in it. So I've included quite a bit for you to play around with.

Entry Stuff: The robot will not set pending orders, it will wait until price touches the breakout trigger level (from Wednesdays onward) then open an order on touch. It will only have one trade open at a time per pair. If a trade fails, it will still allow one more trade to be triggered in the opposite direction. So basically you get one trade trigger per direction. At the end of the week it resets internal counters. But be careful here, I haven't fully optimized this to remember its state if you unload the ea and then reload it. It will see open trades that it placed before, and work off that basis, but otherwise unloading and re-loading the EA will mean a "reset" of the internal trade counters in most cases.

I didn't really polish this aspect because I was mainly flogging this in the back-tester, checking the things I was implementing, were working as intended.

There was also some discussion here about having a buffer outside the channel boundary.

Add_Entry_Threashold Is the entry buffer setting. 0.1 = 10%, which will add 10% of the Mon-Tue range to the entry condition.

During back testing I noticed that timing was swinging results wildly. So Trade_Hour_Start and Trade_Hour_End are the hours which the EA will be allowed to place trades. It's set to 8-15 by default which were showing the best results on my broker.

These times work off your broker hour, so when your broker hour hits London Open is a ballpark time when you want to allow trading. Play around with this in the back tester. Just put 0 - 23 to essentially allow trading in all hours.

Stop Loss Calculations:

Here you will start to see all the options my trade library is offering.

There are two stop loss selections. One selection are standard / generic kind of stop loss methods, and the other one is stop loss methods that are unique to this strategy only.

To use the stop loss method unique to this strategy,Set Stop_Strategy to: STOP_LOSS_USE_STRATEGY_METHOD Select a stop loss method from System_Stop_Loss_Method (I only have one in there at the moment) The option WTF_STOPLOSS_MON_TUE_CHAN_PCT will set the trade stop loss at a percentage point of the monday - tues channel. By the amount set in Stop_Strategy_Value

Careful: It is expecting decimals here... 0.5 = 50% of the candle.

Otherwise you can use my built in stop loss methods. Eg.Stop loss by prev candle high/low Stop loss by volatility (atr) - use multiplier to multiples of the atr, eg set stop loss multiplier value to 2 for 2xATR Stop loss by prev swing high/low - Stop_Strategy_Value = fractal value here,  stop loss multiplier adds buffer spacing (remember pct in decimal format)
Trailing Stop MethodsLots to play with here Remember multiplier values are in decimal format Some methods don't use multiplier values, like trail by EMA Min risk reward achieved by trade before trailing kicks in (strongly recommended for some trail methods) Break even conditions
You've also got other options with are pretty straight forwardRisk settings (by account %, or by $ value) Set targets by risk reward multiples Plus some more..

Hopefully that get's you started.

Please don't use this on a live account until you've played around with it on demo and you understand how the input options are working.

Have fun, get well soon Erebus.

Please do not let the thought of supposedly stepping on other people's toes in here keep you from sharing in MT4. You are not stepping on anyone's toes by doing that. Variety is a good thing! It's good to have choices. So my request to you is to compile what you have contributed to MT4, and share it on this thread.

Thank you for your contribution here!

--- 帖子 #1044 ---
Thanks for the reply and all replies are welcomed equally.

This is a tricky one as some people want their lines to remain intact.  The button should stay where it is.

Making something completely configurable makes testing so much harder.

I don't want to make any changes before tomorrow so we can run a live test but will certainly add it to my list.

I have an idea to close the EA with a button and if you use that then it clears everything including the EA.  Need to do a bit of research but I think its do-able

How about a script just to clear the screen

Is there any performance improvements to be gained.

Wow, busy man, thanks for huge contribution,  might be coming into some $$$ soon = computer, will be checking this out ASAP.

WTF = Wednesday Thursday Friday

What’s not to like about this method? You know when to look for a trade, you know where to look for the entry, it’s purely price, you don’t pick pairs, the pairs pick you! You don’t trade on Monday or Tuesday, which many people have a problem with seems like, ever hear the term “edging”?

Thanks for well wishes, much appreciated

Only few hours to go now faithful followers

But still markets are finding their way, a degree of caution is advised

--- 帖子 #1053 ---
I'm with you however it seems this thread has been plagued with takeovers multiple solutions of scripts indicators and EA's.  Perhaps its due to our success. We have a simple system which if developed into an EA could be profitable for everyone.  The problem is there is to much time on peoples hands with nothing to do on Mon/Tues.

There seems to me different ideas on when to enter stop losses etc etc.  There isn't any focus on getting the basics sorted.

The MT5 looks like a wish list in parts but I am not going to criticise. I may someday turn to it but not for now.

I'm ready and setup for tomorrow on my test pc so we shall see what happens.

Your results are wrong

about GBPAUD it's impossible to get - 525 pips feb 25 - feb 28

Hi Yes.  That's the Day the EA will start from 3=Wednesday. It won't be needed when its finished but needed for testing.

--- 帖子 #1063 ---
loaded this in this morning, i noticed it is using the same stop loss for buys and sells, is this deliberate change from OP strategy?

--- 帖子 #1064 ---
The GBPAUD trade was just last week  -- should be Tues March 3 - Fri March 6  -my error.

High was 1.9719  low was 1.9299  = 420 pips

420 x 15% = 63 pips

buy entry was 1.9782      (1.9782 + 63 = 1.9782))

stop loss  was 1.9257       ( 420 x 10% = 42 pips   ----    low was 1.299 - 42 = 1.9257)

so 1.9782 - 1.9257 = 525

I am not using calculator (cannot download it --and doing by hand )  -- let me know if you see an error   -many thanks.

--- 帖子 #1065 ---
Thanks for the explanation.

Nice work and many thanks for time spent on this. Its a nice step in my opinion.

Here you go buddy (taken from my own EA):
Inserted Code //+------------------------------------------------------------------+
//| Delete all objects for this EA.
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
void DeleteObjects(string objectPrefix)
{
//--- delete all objects
int obj_total=ObjectsTotal();
for(int i=obj_total-1; i>=0; i--)
{
string name=ObjectName(i);
if(StringSubstr(name,0,4)==objectPrefix)
{
ObjectDelete(name);
}
}
}

When you create your objects, simply prefix them with a unique 4-char label. Calling this routine, passing the prefix, will remove them all from the chart.

Use ExpertRemove() to unload the EA from the chart.

Thanks. I had time to sort it out but why not ObjectsDelete() that clears everything. I still haven't implemented it as I didn't have time to do any testing and also I want to keep old lines on my charts so it has to be optionable.  Probably yet another button.

--- 帖子 #1081 ---
Instead of a button, why not just provide a bool parameter that the user can set to remove all objects or not?  Much simpler.

Why not use a routine that clears everything?  Because that’s not playing nice with other indicators...a user may use your EA in conjunction with other indicators, so if you remove all object, instead of just those created by your EA, you may cause those indicators to malfunction.  It ‘cleaner’. To remove just those you created.

--- 帖子 #1082 ---
well.... that’s just not right, 5 pm New York close is the recognised Daily close of Forex market

Script or EA needs to be smart enough to know that, regardless of Local time

you think people in New York will stay up another 7 hours until midnight to place orders?

--- 帖子 #1083 ---
...but as far as I see on my PC the script is working at 00:00 Wednesday time and not one minute earlier.

--- 帖子 #1084 ---

As requested, here is the MT4 version.

I don't use MT4, but a quick test shows everything work. (Holy Sh*t MT4 is slow compared to MT5)

I can confirm on my broker (IC market's) that both spike hunters EA and the script created the same orders at the same prices.

I've deleted the script orders (I was just testing the creation of orders from both solutions) and will the EA run and manage trade's accordingly Friday

Thank you for everyone's contribution

It's my first week using this on a demo account

Cheers

--- 帖子 #1096 ---
@ pbw

GBPAUD is a 5-digits pair and no a 4-digits

if you look at the graph below with the Swingman indicator and feb 26-28 , you see the buy is triggered at 1.97445.. OK

if you wait for the friday close (trading end) the price is 1.96653

so the loss is 80 pips

for the march 3-6 the sell is triggered at 1.92977 but you have to use the sl at 1.94880

we have to consider this system as a basket with trade management

a loss of 525 pips is unacceptable

--- 帖子 #1097 ---
Yes agreed

--- 帖子 #1098 ---
Thank you for using and testing my EA.  How would you like it to manage the orders on Friday?  I will incorporate it.

--- 帖子 #1099 ---
Maybe I've missed something, but I'm not sure that your maths is correct on this one - did you actually enter a trade or are you paper trading it?

Also what are you using for your entry and stop loss?

You mention 15% entry...if so, then GBPAUD should not have triggered last week for you (it didn't for me).

e.g. I'm using 15% of range for entry and 50% of range for SL.

Last week's range was 1.9774 to 1.9297 (476 pips).

Long entry was at 1.9845, short entry at 1.99226.

Price extremes from Wednesday was a high of 1.9675 and a low of 1.9289 - well within the trigger points.

Even if it did lose, the loss would have been 309 pips max (not that pips are any indication of profitability).

--- 帖子 #1100 ---
Very well thought out and clear explanation of your strategy!

--- 帖子 #1101 ---
Its a great question.  When does Wednesday start.  Its different for each time zone as a new day starts at midnight and then you have to take into account GMT and your brokers server time. There probably several Wednesday starts.

My EA uses the DayOfWeek function which ranges fro 0 to 6 Sunday to Saturday which I presume is taken by MT4 from the brokers server time.  Wednesday is therefore =3.  There always seem to be discrepancies between systems using different brokers so its a case of doing your own analysis and checking the results are what you want.  Some brokers like mine have open at 22:00 on Sunday so I have 2 Sunday candles.  This really screws up any indicators based on daily prices so I tend to stay away from daily systems.  This one is cleaner in that it is an analysis of Mon & Tues prices what ever they may be and then a break out.  No indicators to get in the way, at the moment at least.

--- 帖子 #1102 ---
Yes I agree with you and that is what we are trying to implement , although the SL is a bit far out the rest is about the same. Forward testing will prove how good it works.

--- 帖子 #1103 ---
I suggest London Open to begin the trading.

Quote "
Entry Stuff: The robot will not set pending orders, it will wait until price touches the breakout trigger level (from Wednesdays onward) then open an order on touch." Just cut and paste the bit I wanted.

Trouble with this method is that you will need to leave the PC running all the time. No power cuts, unless battery backup, no system updates just like the one I have had, or other miscellaneous issues, and he vagaries of brokers "off quotes" and slippage etc. Setting Pending Orders will allow to set and turn off just checking occasionally or even from a tablet.

--- 帖子 #1107 ---
Do you have any triggered orders ?

4 orders currently and unfortunately 1 SL (GBPCHF)

--- 帖子 #1108 ---
Well if you're serious about running a trading robot, you've got to account for these things.

My solution would be to have the EA fully restore its state and "pick up where it left off".

Pending Orders Vs EA Market Order

It depends what you want. Placing pending orders is the easiest "set and forget" method. But I seen you guys are trading a lot of pairs, and on Wednesday your MT4 is blanketed with pending orders on all different markets.

Correct me if I am wrong, but you've got some sort of system in place where if one of the pending orders is triggered, the rest need to be deleted? or cut down in some way.

If that's the case, you nulled your own argument, because you need the EA there to watch those pending orders on every tick to manage which ones are going to get closed off after a trade trigger event.

The "power outage" scenario will screw you either way - I can't imagine that you would just let it place pending orders from all different markets and think you're safe if the EA got cut off. Imagine if they all got triggered, the risk management is still needed with the pending orders approach on some level from the EA.

If there is a power out on a market execution EA during the moment the signal triggers, you miss the trade. If the EA is out with the pending order approach, you could potentially have 20 unwanted trades trigger.

Does that make sense?

--- 帖子 #1109 ---
My plan / personal preference really is to close all trades in profit as i see fit, letting the remaining ones run until they hit SL (if they do).

I always like to let a system play out completely as this for me gives a good idea on the strategy as a whole.

Im happy to take a recommendation on how better / best to manage closing down orders / trades at market close on a Friday.

--- 帖子 #1110 ---
Yes, I agree with you, it makes absolute sense,

That's why I only trade on four pairs,

Even when you've got EA's running,

You need to watch them and watch the market and price action,

I am looking into when I start trading live to set up two computers,

running with the same  account on both of them,

so I can close my trades if one of the computers goes down.

Edit: Also your highest point isn't the same as mine. I am using Dukascopy, looks like this depends on the brokers too.

--- 帖子 #1120 ---
Then it's either your broker or a typo in the spreadsheet, because the low for Monday/Tuesday for me (IC Markets) was 1.76386...that's why the price didn't come close to what would have been my short entry.

Which broker are you using?

--- 帖子 #1121 ---
I am using Dukascopy. Please check it here https://www.dukascopy.com/plugins/fxMarketWatch/?charts, you can see that the low is 1.76841.

Yes, but you can move them. There seems to be different opinions on SL. I would prefer to move to a more suitable position when a trade had been executed. 50% is really just a place holder and the same for TP.  I have always found the MM part the most difficult to program efficiently.

Really, I didn’t know all of that, brokers tell you how you can and can’t trade?

This is how much I want to trade with, and will be when the insurance pays out.

For now, here is my real account, only difference is the size, percentages are the same

Trading strategy is as per Monday and Tuesday System in this thread, that will never change

Look at how awesome it is to pick the direction

good luck to you

I would recommend anyone thinking of starting a live accounts

only tick the box which has got the smallest amounts in it,

I found on one live account I only had £600 balance I was in a losing trade I was losing £35,

Another trade caught my eye, I decided to go in it, But they wouldn't let me,

kept on coming up saying my balance would not cover my losses even though I had stop losses on everything,

Anyone thinking of trading must do it with the amount they going to put in IT,

Otherwise, it's pointless using a demo accounts.

--- 帖子 #1155 ---
Anyone trading this system manually,
I think we should write another rule if Monday and Tuesday High and Low have developed into a great big range.
Use Wednesday's High and LOW,
I have checked 16 pairs and 14 of them would have given you a profit,
I also checked them last week and it was the same,
I will put some pictures on,
In the pictures, the blue lines are High and Low Monday Tuesday.
The Orange line is Wednesday's High and Low this is where we can put our pending orders.
Let me know what you think.So we would actually be trade trading Thursday morning.

I like it, I had a similar thought but it was to shift to Tuesday and Wednesday

Didn’t have time to explore it yet, what I did was ignore those big spikes on Monday for some pairs

For any reason, the AUD and NZD pairs have known an incredible volatility during the 5 th hour on monday.

So the boxes of these pairs were extremely high by preventing the system to work correctly.

But this only applies to AUD and NZD pairs....waiting for next week if it occurs similarly

Can you share with me please. D1 Strenght indicator.

That would be margin, and has nothing to do with stop loss.

The broker's margin requirements for the instrument worked out that you didn't have enough fund in the account to cover the broker's position. It's pretty standard - on demo too - it simply depends on who the broker is and what's occurring at the time (they can vary margin requirements from day to day).

I don’t understand the question, Stop Loss is 50% of the Monday Tuesday High Low range, yes, for both

long and short trades, keep it Simple

You know the Entry, you have the Stop Loss, how much you want to risk can be a fixed amount of the account or a percentage of account, do the calculation, I use an app from Play Store

Hope that helps

--- 帖子 #1172 ---
I have tried both, but settled on the OP setting if 15%

Now, some trades this week, I ignored the spikes price action, if the market won’t behave, I don’t have too either

Bend the guidelines to fit the situation!

I read a lot of these threads in here, Trading Systems, and see some underlying themes, most are looking back using some indicator on past price to help predict the future price. This method does that in a fashion I guess, but not an indicator, I use Fibonacci Tool to place the price levels. We know the Entry ahead of time, we know when to look for the entry, after Tuesday’s close.

Other threads are trying to pick top and bottoms, turning points, buying and selling when Price is moving against them.

Some threads, you need 1 candle, or 2 candles, 3 candles, even 4 candles; not only that, they have to be special colour?

Have a look at some them, I see most of you there, some even posting, focus here guys

This method is so simple, it will never be popular, that’s a good thing! How did I get on this rant, oh yeah, I’m on a train to the hospital and got time

--- 帖子 #1173 ---
Looks like it worked out for me. It hit the tp, so based on this, the entry point depends also on brokers.

Agree, should have been able to squeeze a few pips from GBPCAD, both were weak so it was a battle

When he said it went long, I think he means price went up, not the signal long, Paul?

Yeah they were both weak, but i took the trade based on this strategy also the gap pull. Usually in the market the gap gets filled so combining those two things was a good idea.

‘Well, see, we’re not mind readers, if you explained that to start with

The setting is 0.15

What I do is drop to the 1-hour chart to precisely place the Fibonacci Tool on that high and low

See arrow on left

Make your Fibonacci Tool show these prices and I think you will find it very close, arrows on right

This is IC Markets, so yes, broker will be a few pips different, but your candles look the same

A few people are asking about Fibonacci's

and I don't see any Fibonacci's in the indicator box on this site,

So I thought I would put a couple on.

The first one is pretty good but I don't know how to use it,
if anyone knows how to use it, what I mean is how to set it up.

Please give us a shout.

Just wondering if you'll be doing any more work on this EA smc ea ultimate,

--- 帖子 #1191 ---
I wanted to just let it run and look at the results although this hasn't been the best.

--- 帖子 #1192 ---
The problem I find is my indicators gives me a pair that looks like a good trade,

I look at my screen to find the pair, I then find out I've not loaded that chart,

so I have to go and find the chart put all my indicators on it,

by the time I've done that I've missed the trade.

With your EA I just click on the button and the chart comes up if I loaded it.

If you do any work on it give us a shout.

--- 帖子 #1193 ---
Tell me what we should add and I will try and do it. I  thought about sending all the orders from one screen.  It's not as though there is much activity needed. If you wanted to move SL etc then just open that screen.  You could also just have another screen and place each symbol on it to see what's happening. What do you think about that. It could be controlled using input params or globals.  It is because I don't have to keep looking and can turn the pc off if I want that I looked at this system. As I said earlier not a good week to make any decisions.

--- 帖子 #1194 ---
I don't need to send my orders from that particular screen,

All my orders are set with stop and take profit which is place automatically

once I have manually put the trade on,

what I would like is every button clearly marked with all the pairs lowest spread from left to right,

That means I can click on a pair the chart comes up I place the trade and automatically the EA kicks in with a stop and take profit lines, it's as simple as that,

The only other thing I'd like is a button that closes everything.

PS: I AM GO OUT NOW SEE YOU OVER THE WEEKEND

HAVE A GOOD WEEKEND.

--- 帖子 #1195 ---
Hi redfan,

That's not really the way I have set it up.  You should have all the screens, you are potentially going to trade, open with the EA running on Wednesday morning.  It will then open all the trades based on Mon/Tues with TP & SL.  My button system still requires that there are screens open.  The buttons are part of my bigger EA and aren't an indicator.  The latest version has a CLOSEALL button.

Be sure to bookmark the following comment: https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...3#post12756303

If you stumble upon someone else in here who has the same question, you can share the link with them.

Note: you will need to change 1.25 to 1.15 for BUY at 15%, and change -0.25 to -0.15 for SELL at 15%.

That is, if you want to use the OP's entry. Otherwise, you can keep it as it is. But it appears 15% is ideal.

Thanks for testing and sharing. The loss on EURGBP was due to volatility swing, I got hit on real account and the demo in my trade explorer.

The system actually got the direction correct, and a re-entry would have recovered the loss for break even or profit.

This is the EA I'm going with next week.  It worked ok last week.  I have added an auto close for Friday 20 hours and a CloseAll button.  The 5/20 is configurable in the Global Variables or should be. Its not easy testing this type of EA that only runs once.  It made a profit last week so lets hope this week is as good.  The % break is also configurable but set initially at 15%.

You should set this up before Wednesday morning. It won't do anything until the clock ticks over to the new day

Good Hunting

Charts don't get much cleaner than this. I'm going to try to limit the pairs that I trade with this strategy so i'm not risking tooooo much. I'm going to try to risk around .5% to 1% per pair. I'm going to treat these trades as a basket but also let each pair have a set TP and SL. If some of the pairs hit a TP or SL but my overall basket TP or SL hasn't been hit yet, i'll continue to trade. Once the overall basket TP or SL has been hit than I will "close all trades" no matter what. I'm not quite sure what a good overall TP and SL is yet. I haven't had enough time to forward test this strategy. I think I will start with a TP of around 3%-5% and a SL of 5%. These are just a starting point and by no means "set in stone". I'm going to focus on All USD pairs except for USDCHF (not trading CHF) and ALL GBP pairs except for GBPCHF, and EURAUD and EURNZD due to their big ranges.

Edit: I forgot to mention I will also be using 15% for entry and 50% for SL, and 1:1 for TP. I may or may not also forward test 15% entry and 100% for SL and 1:.5

I can see why people get annoyed with you? Have you looked at your charts? Do you have the Fibonacci Tool there to draw the levels? Or perhaps using one of the box indicators? Or at the very least, your EYES?

Okay, here is the chart, the first (smaller) yellow box is where a trade triggered on a pending order - Buy Stop

The red box is where that trade was exited on the Stop Loss order

The second (larger) yellow box is where there is opportunity to re-enter the trade

Both were BUY or LONG trades

GBPCHF is the opposite of EURGBP, please read the article I linked previously.

Therefore, the trades on GBPCHF were SELL or SHORT trades.

Hope that helps; you can help yourself by learning the charts, learn the methodology.

The stop loss you are using appears to be too tight for this strategy.

It is more efficient to use the Average Daily Range as a stop loss.

Had you used the ADR (currently 92 pips for period 10) as a stop loss on your EURGBP trade, you would not have gotten stopped out, and you could have collected pips on this pair up until Friday.

--- 帖子 #1250 ---
I've only tried to be helpful in this thread. But since people in here appear to find me annoying, I will go away.

I wish you all the best.

--- 帖子 #1251 ---
Yes, it could be too tight on some cases, in others it doesn’t matter, the method got the DIRECTION CORRECT for every entry last (that I took is what I mean)

I don’t have any fancy indicators available as they don’t run on an iPad.

Would the EURGBP still get to 2 to 1 level using 92 pips stop loss?

However, the Fibonacci Tool takes volatility in consideration by making the Entry 15% of the High to low range.

That is pretty good in most cases. Every new trader is told, there will be losses, this was 1 out of 10 or 11 trades.

It’s the next best thing to a guaranteed winner, but if you can improve it, open a demo account, link it to TE

Forward test it for a week or two, come on!

--- 帖子 #1252 ---
Oh come on, don’t be like that, we all love ya

Yes, that stop loss and take profit would have worked

But how about all the other trades, would they have hit targets?

I don’t have the ADR to check them

You have to admit it was a close thing, just an unfortunate range and then the spike

Considering what’s going on in the markets, an excellent outcome IMHO

So I just did a "visual" back test on this strategy using GBPUSD from March 1st 2019 to Current (52 weeks). Here is what I was using as my criteria. Opening trades at 15% with a 50%SL. Once a trade reaches 50% of the 1:1 target I move the SL to BE. I leave all trades open until either the TP or SL is hit or then end of the trading day on Friday. I don't open any trades on Friday. I only open trades on Wed and Thur. That's pretty much it. Here are my results.....

1:1 was reached 18 times

2:1 was reached 6 times

SL was hit 8 times at 50% of the range

SL was hit 3 times at 100% of the range

No Trade 10 times

Break Even 6 times

Small Loss at close on Friday 4 times

Small Win at close on Friday 6 times

EDIT: If I risked 1% per trade I would have made +18% on the wins and -8% on the losses. That leaves +10%...plus or minus the small wins and losses (6 small wins and 4 small losses).  I know you're probably thinking at first...."this is only +10%+/- for 52 weeks"......BUT.....this is only 1 pair and only 1% per week. If I were trading only 1 pair per week I would most likely risk at least 5%. So you can safely multiply that +10% by 5 if you only wanted to trade this one pair.........now....50%+/- for the last 52 weeks!! Does that sound better?!?

Sounds like a good plan to me. Not sure if you are being too cautious with the profit target. 0.5%or 1% are certainly recognised risk levels. You can afford a lot of losses before being totally wiped out.

Totally agree. The premise for this somewhat lightly called strategy is that Monday and Tuesday defined a trading range. Yet to be completely proven but I am happy to accept it on face value. After that there are some entry and exit rules which over the life of this thread have been rightly questioned. This is a breakout strategy which requires the trader to look at risk/reward, false breakiouts, SL, tp etc, etc.

If you are going to use this idea then everyone has a personal responsibility to ensure that their own interpretation is 100% correct. Their own implementation is 100% correct. Don't expect anyone else to spoon feed you.  Do your own work, share if you want, and implement the results, if you want.

The 6th bar on the left from the upper arrow -where price actually closed over the buy/buffer ? line. Would you have bought over the break of that close ?

if so -that would be a profitable long?

The other candles seem to have spiked above that line then closed below it thus negating a trade until around the bar referred to above?

If I misunderstood then I apologise in advance.

Not many about.

I will post my latest version of my spreadsheet.  One week only but easily extendable to cover as many weeks as required.

I have also added the actual code should anyone be interested enough, not an .exe

Hi Spikehunter,

Is this one in place of the One you posted on the 14th?

--- 帖子 #1263 ---
Yes I have changed it a bit and so all the calculations are done in the script.  Just having an issue with the multi week one. But still working on it.

If you can please check through it and see if you agree.  No need to do all the trades.  The calcs don't take into account SL or TP.  Its a bit raw at the moment.

I will only develop it further if I find it of use or someone else does.

I think that I am going to look at a better entry, SL & TP strategy.  Next week I will let it run as is and develop a more considered approach to the former.

Hope you are having a good weekend.  I have had a stinking cold.

--- 帖子 #1264 ---
PLEASE NOTE THERE ARE ERRORS IN THE SPREADSHEET but hope you can see where I am going or at least trying to go

And here is multiweek. Only checked one to see if it was the same.

Please people if you are interested in driving a statistical approach to this please help and check this is giving the correct numbers.

5 weeks made over 8000 pips. During that time only 8 pairs hit both sides. Working on other stuff which I will post here. Anyone have any ideas what would be useful.

ALL PAIRS

I dropped it with the EA's but noticed it said script at the end,

so I put it in with the script folder is that correct,

I dropped it onto the page and nothing has happened, is that correct.

ps, a cold is not bad, it's the cough you don't want.

Hello everyone

For cases where volatility is deemed too high on Monday for example, here is the modified EA to take into account only the day before for the calculation of the range, such as Tuesday or Wednesday ... according to an idea of redfan.

--- 帖子 #1268 ---
Good to see you are still here. Totally agree and I would also say not to put them in obvious places.

Request for help to coders,

would there be a condition to add for a BUYSTOP order to be executed only if the candle's closing is above the trigger level? (and vice versa for a SELLSTOP order)

Thank you in advance .

--- 帖子 #1270 ---
Once a BUYSTOP/SELLSTOP order is placed there is no further control available.  This doesn't mean you can't achieve what you want.  You would have to place a market order when the close, I assume a lower timeframe, has happened.  Problem for some with this is that the EA would need to be continuously running and market orders don't always get filled at the level you thought i.e. slippage.  Sometimes not at all "OffQuotes"

I must admit I am not keen on the Pending orders as any old spike can activate them and the idea of a clear breakthrough is my way of thinking, however at the moment I will stick with the current method until I get a clearer idea of the breakout strategy.  Give me you ideas, clearly.

--- 帖子 #1271 ---
Thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #1272 ---
I wanted to give you an idea to make EA more profitable, it would be when you reach 50% of the target, close half of the position and put the stoploss on the BE, I think there would have to be a message to warn you that you should use even lots.

Your collaboration is very good ...

--- 帖子 #1273 ---
Hi redfan. Correct. No it doesn't do anything except create a .csv file in the MQL4 File Folder.  I am having some issues with the multi week so probably best to ignore for a day or two.  It may work better as an EA when the market opens but getting the right data seems to be a problem.  I will keep you posted.

--- 帖子 #1274 ---
Who are all these invisibles???   Are they ashamed of something????

--- 帖子 #1275 ---
Yes, you would have to use an even lot size for this. It's a good strategy when using the Average Daily Range as your first take Profit target. But I think it would be better to move the stop loss to at least 2 or 5 pips in profit to cover the spread.

--- 帖子 #1276 ---
I think if you want to make it more profitable then a more calculated entry and point is required. Although taking partial profits is one method for locking in some profit IMO all you are doing is limiting profit unless there is a rationale behind it.

--- 帖子 #1277 ---
Been lurking in the shadows for a while. Love the idea of the 2 day breakout. Weeding out the BS trades with some filters can be an enormous help. Enabling a hidden trailstop could be huge after one of the first 2 targets have been hit. Just my 2 cents. Happy trading this week, stay green!!!

--- 帖子 #1278 ---
It looks like someone spilled some paint on the picture. No need for added filters. That's the beauty of this system. Nice and clean charts. No added BS. The only thing is needed is good money management so that the Strike rate is profitable. Which, with this strategy doesn't appear to be that hard to do. I personally, am NOT a fan of taking half the profits and letting the rest run. I like to have a TP target and taking FULL profits. I also like the idea of moving the SL to BE +1 or 2 to cover spread at some point in time of the trade.

--- 帖子 #1279 ---
A lot of assumptions made in those questions; first of all, I do pending orders as per the PRICE

There is no setting for time or close above when placing a Pending Order

To do as you say, a trader would have to watch all the charts 24 / 5, is that how you trade?

And what is the magic time frame for the close above you want?

A few posts beyond that, a trader did say he made a re-entry and a profitable trade.

As far as I know, a Script or an EA will place pending orders on the PRICE levels,

They won’t wait to see if the close is above!

What is the point of calculating position size, proper risk management, using that price as the entry

and then placing the actual trade 20 pips higher?

IF you have a better way, by all means, use it, open a demo account, show is the TE

Seems like everyone is missing the point, you want a guaranteed entry with never get stopped out!

So many suggestions to fix something that isn’t broke, no one even posts a chart to support their ideas.

Let’s see how it goes this week, whose ideas work, but please gather your proof.

Good luck to all

--- 帖子 #1280 ---
I like my spilled paint though. LOL. keeps me with the money!! And i'm not trying to change anything anyone is doing here just a suggestions. Stay green!!!

--- 帖子 #1281 ---
But the question remains, IF all that paint is keeping you in the money, why are you still searching for other methods?

I believe it’s because you don’t trust the paint, you need more confirmation.

Go ahead, make suggestions, back them up with results, we will all be into the painted charts soon, I’m sure

--- 帖子 #1282 ---
Might be on on mobile or iPad though!

--- 帖子 #1283 ---
Thank you Spikehunter for your response.

My idea was to have a confirmation over a period in H1 to have a better chance of the start of a lasting trend by a close of the candle beyond or on the entry level.

Of course this requires that the EA is always running (on the PC or on a VPS) and to place it on a graph in H1.

I modified the EA in this sense with this new version.

In the settings, I also changed the stoploss level to at least 55% of the range levels because often a 50% retracement is not uncommon and it's annoying to be kicked out for a few pips.

The RR is always 2: 1 in this setting, but you can change everything.

Test it and tell me what you think.

--- 帖子 #1284 ---
Why were you asking for coders to help you when you already know the answer.  Why would I want to test your ea when I have one of my own.  Please don't waste my time.

You make several incorrect assumptions - I did apologise in advance but never mind

Right then - I'll get me coat !

--- 帖子 #1286 ---
you said things like, several spikes above the line that would negate the trade

well, if that’s the way you want to trade, go ahead, no need to ask me

it’s quite clear how I trade, PRICE

--- 帖子 #1287 ---
I was hoping to discuss  price closing above line then taking any break of that price bar. Perhaps others might like to comment apart from Erebus.

I once read an article from a trading wizard who stated a number of things. The ones relevant here would be:

Simple but not simplistic

A real reason to take a trade (he actually said he looks for reasons NOT to take trades

Direction

Momentum

This latter point to me is especially important as we see to often spikes initiating trades or closing on slwhereas a little more attention to real momentum would keep you out or in. Price isn't always your friend. A close or a number of closes at a lower tf may help. GBPNZD last week proves the point exactly.

This reminds me of the sushi trade by a well known trader, sorry haven't got his name to hand. Price takes out new hi/lo over last 5 bars then reverses and takes a new lo/hi over 5 bars. A reversal price pattern.

There is here a defined idea which if followed looks good to make money.  There isn't much else that can be said that hasn't already been said.  Getting close to a time to spend the cash and move on.

--- 帖子 #1291 ---
Excellent reply Spike and food for thought. Thanks for taking the time to make a constructive reply. Much appreciated.

--- 帖子 #1292 ---
My question on the BUYSTOP and SELLSTOP orders concerned another EA for another files and, like you, I didn't know the answer; however, thank you for responding to me on this point.

In the second part of your post you ask me to give you my ideas, which I did.

It turns out that this idea is common to both EAs except that of the other files requires keeping STOP orders for technical reasons for the rest of the code; for the moment I have no solution.

By cons, I asked nothing for this one. I know how to do it, which I did immediately to post it at the same time.

When I said to test it, it was aimed more broadly at the whole community, not particularly at you.

As English is not my mother tongue, I have to help me with Google translation and maybe the translation could be confusing ...

Nevertheless I find your way of answering me somewhat inappropriate.

I'm not in competition with you, everyone will choose the EA that suits them.

I am sure you are more sympathetic in life than the impression you left here this evening.

Have a good night it should be better then.

--- 帖子 #1293 ---
The above post is in response to Spikehunter

--- 帖子 #1294 ---
Sorry, but this makes no sense. If it comes back hard at you and hits your BE, then you walk away with nothing! At least if you take 50% off the table and it comes back hard at you, you could potentially walk away with something.

The way I see it is you are sitting on the fence if you use BE without taking something off the table.

But hey, what do I know.

I'm talking about taking 1/2 profits at TP1. This makes no sense to me unless tp2 is far enough away to make it worth while. The way you put it in your response that price comes back hard at you.....that won't happen with what I was saying because i'm talking about at TP1. If price hit's tp1 than I would have closed 100% of trade. I don't mind moving the SL to BE+1 or 2 or something half way to tp1 but once price hits my tp1.....im closing 100% of my trade.....unless of course tp2 is my main target in the first place.

--- 帖子 #1300 ---
If that is what you intend to do, then that's fine with me. You trade the way you want to trade. Personally, I would rather let my trades run for as long as I can, and even add to my position if it makes sense to do so. If I am trading in the right direction, and the price action is giving me no reason to get out, then I am staying in until Friday.

--- 帖子 #1301 ---
That is why I said it would be ok to add an additional trade at tp1 but to make your original trade bigger just so you can take 1/2 lot size at tp1 just doesn't make sense to me. If you spend time in your strategy to come up with a good Entry and TP/SL why not honor them. Put in your biggest position at the beginning and if you hit your main TP1 and you feel good about getting in on the right direction, at that point, then you can add an additional trade at a smaller position and "let run for as long as you can", I have no issue with that.

--- 帖子 #1302 ---
I have never seen anything rude or abusive in any of Erebus' posts. He just writes the truth, which many people can't handle, in any aspect of life.  So many posters want to complicate what is a very simple and effective system, more indicators, what about an EA?, etc..  To be honest, Erebus' posts are the only ones I look for.

--- 帖子 #1303 ---
Please keep in mind certain market conditions call for certain responses. I have a lot of experience trading. Because of that, I have different money management strategies, and those strategies work very well when applied at the right time.

I often don't use a stop loss. And when I do, I use a wide stop loss. Sometimes I use a BE strategy with a 50% take profit rule. And there are times when I might even use a negative BE which turns into a positive BE at some point. It all depends on the market conditions. As a trader, I have to adapt.

I'm not trying to step on your toes here, but I kind felt like you were being condescending towards the 50% profit taking strategy. That's why I responded to you.

Spike

FYI, im using your EA here:-

https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...8#post12812548

For this week, its already loaded up on all my charts.

I had great success with your EA last week, and on Friday close i simply shut down all trades in profit, non were floating negative, and cancelled all pending orders that were build and not triggered.

Ill be doing the same this week, just a question, and sorry if you have already stated this, has this option of closing down everything already been built in your EA?

Thanks again for your work on this.

--- 帖子 #1320 ---
No problem, I've already moved on

--- 帖子 #1321 ---
The very definition of irony

--- 帖子 #1322 ---
No problem just ask away.

Yes it can have an auto close on Friday at 20:00, see below, and a button top right corner. That's the one I have on my charts. Let me know if the button is there. It is in a fixed position so the screen needs to be wide enough. I cant really fine a place which doesn't obscure it if a user opens up panels or makes the chart small. I recently started using buttons and I am not sure they will float. If you don't want the auto stop just set the Global variable "WhenToStopDay" found under the Tools menu to "0" this will prevent it from closing. If you want to use this feature again check both the Day and Hour are set to what you want. I haven't been able to fully test this only by "eyeball".

Just to be absolutely complete, there needs to be a Global Variable called "WhenToStopDay" and "WhenToStopHour" no quotes but exactly as I have typed in the Global Variables and set at something like "5" and "20". Sorry for being pedantic nut I find that precise instructions are the best, well at least nearly precise just in case I have made a mistake. This is not difficult to do. Open Tools GoTo Global Variables click add and you are there. Ignore all the others.

Edit: The old lines will be cleared when a new week starts on Wednesday.

I hope that all makes sense.

MoTuBo_EA Version 1.0

EDIT: This version has been superseded - do NOT use this version.

Hi guys,

Here's the first version of my EA for this strategy, which I have cued up for all pairs for this week to see how it goes.

I've tested with the defaults and all is OK. I can't speak for all of the other options, but I will spend some time testing those in isolation shortly and make any necessary adjustments.By default:Entry is at 15% of range. Stop is at 50% of range. TP is 1 x Stop. Risk is 1% of the account balance per trade.
The parameters ought to be fairly self-explanatory, but feel free to ask if you have any questions:

Hello and thank you all for sharing this strategy. I am new here and my english is not the best. I apologize for this.

I read the topic but I didn't understand a thing.

Must there be a particular Monday and Tuesday move to consider before opening pending orders?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1337 ---
Some neat analysis right there, wish this forum was full of this, a lot more useful than what is usually posted. Your going to need at least 10 times more data to say anything statistically viable enough to trade on, but imo this is the way to go for sure. Also try to see if you recognise any patterns of where losses or bigger wins come from, by looking at hundreds of trades you often get to a second edge in the system.

Quick remark about your earlier statement though: risking 5% on a single position is absolute madness. Both from a risk standpoint (not even including black swan events) and from a profit standpoint, often such big risk factors decrease the potential profit instead of increasing potential profits, i'd suggest doing the maths on this a few times as a good indicator of what to expect. Besides even in a winning system this would lead to periods of at least 80% drawdown, some people can handle this, 99.9% cannot.

Otherwise your on the right track man, stay on it!

--- 帖子 #1352 ---
Yes 5% on 1 pair is a lot, but especially on 1 trade, no matter how good the odds are. Seeing as your results will be (mostly) randomised if you do this for a while it's quite easy to hit a few losers in a row. Also it's very much possible to lose more then your sl on any position, so if this is 5 and there is a sudden move your whole account can easily be blown, if not more then what you deposited.

But why would you want to risk such high amounts anyway, just find the pairs that work best (3-4 is more than enough) and trade those, some diversity at least (in pairs but not really diversified in market conditions seeing as you trade them at the same time). Apart from that it would be completely insane to gain 5% per week and expect this to be consistent. If you would even make 0.5% every week you would be a millionaire in a few years only. Focus on where to find the highest % trades, not on increasing risk unnecessarily.

All the best

cheers man. im using this fib for mon tuesday in my thread 3 bar fractal as of tomorrow, found out its useful in direction, loving this group

--- 帖子 #1356 ---
I agree 5% is a lot for a big account but if you're only trading a $1000 live account 5% isn't that much. If you have a $100,000 account then I would agree with your logic. As far as losing your whole account when you have a SL set at 5% of your account. If your losing your whole account with a 5% SL because of a news event  then your going to lose your account no matter what. I'm not arguing btw......just having a discussion and learning as I go. Txs.

Totally irrelevant.

A very complete EA PaulDV, thanks so much for it. I will test it and let you know how it went. Good luck this week everyone!

A bit like your comment

Please advise your definition of “Wednesday”

Let's see what this week will bring to us

Good luck, folks.

--- 帖子 #1361 ---
No problem in arguing, it's quarantine time so for this once we all have enough time anyway hehe.

But I understand the logic, ofcourse a really small account it doesn't matter. But then again the real trading (the fulltimejob type) is not really done on small accounts no matter what people might argue against this.

all that aside, in extreme news events the size does definitely matter. Your loss is still smaller in that situation, because you traded less volume. Losing 5% of equity 10 times over makes a 50% loss, losing 0.5% of equity 10 times over makes a 5% loss only. But perhaps most importantly losing a 5% position 100 times over makes a 500% loss and this can (and on many occasions has )definitely happen(ed) to people

--- 帖子 #1362 ---
I would have thought you of all people would have known that.  I'm surprised you even asked the question.

Thank you, and good luck for the week.  I hope it serves you well.

--- 帖子 #1364 ---
Good week to you, too. How did you manage to place orders without TP? I can't find this EA.

I noticed that you don't use all currencies like why?

Thank you

--- 帖子 #1365 ---
I compared your pending orders with my charts and it seems that you sometimes use 15% entry and sometimes 25% entry. Can you explain, why?

Perhaps this is because of different broker times and therefore different daily candles.

I do, it was in the picture, and you said it was irrelevant

You hurt my 1 feeling

theres a guy in here by ERE something??? been in my thread and said my strategy is in line with this. i can help you get in earlier as i use his fib if your interested. ill do zoom calls if neccesary

--- 帖子 #1374 ---
Thats the good stuff right there, nice work!

Anything you noticed while looking at all those trades? any patterns, certain circumstances that made the trades better? That's usually where the juice is

If the edge is good enough as is you can trade it like this, just doing the best pairs might be enough for a prolonged edge. But usually when looking at a lot of trades you start to notice 'stuff' that makes certain trades a lot better over others, and then you can either increase equity on those trades. Personally when I find the extra edge those are then the only trades I take, no reason to trade anything other than the best setups.

the added edge could be anything; patterns, market circumstances, metadata etc.

Good luck!

And remember that you'll need a whole lot more data in order to really make it (like hundreds times more, both # of trades and variables per trade)

--- 帖子 #1377 ---
i may sound cynical,but this is not a new information to us that MM trap and go against the retail traders and this forum is very old and popular ,i am sure there would be many out here who would be studying most traders strategies and interests,so it would be good to create the private or more discreet group,that doesnt mean that they cant reach us,they have got each and all trades what we do and they sweep all of retialers,anyways!

the other purpose was to share setups ,i.e 36 pairs,so traders may communicate in real time,FFx is not that chatter friendly as trading view or skype or telegram right?

Actually there was. I noticed that a good number of times price went back to the 50% SL almost to the pip....or very close. It might be helpful to use 55% of the range as your SL. If this adjust the TP a little shorter than 1:1 than that's ok because I seen the same thing with the TP......a little closer might be helpful. In hind sight I wish I would have written down the dates of all the SL's and went back to look at the charts on those days and look at the economic calendar as well to see if there was any correlation. I knew going into it that these stats weren't going to be exact...it's a good starting point. If I had some sort of indicator that did frequency distribution stats for me I would use it...ahha.....doing this stuff long hand is time consuming. I will start a excel SS and enter all this information for the past year and then continue keeping stats going forward on the 7 pairs i mentioned

--- 帖子 #1380 ---
Thanks Paul for the share of this. I was just about to get my coder to code this one up, but this saved a job. Nice work and much appreciated.

--- 帖子 #1381 ---
Great job! Any chance you will make it work in MT5?

--- 帖子 #1382 ---
MoTuBo_EA Version 1.01

A quick fix of a couple of issues, and I highly recommend that you use this one in preference to version 1.0

Fixes:The range continued to be recalculated after Tuesday close until an entry was made. Once a trade was open on one pair, it was stopping trades from being opened on other pairs.

--- 帖子 #1383 ---
Hi, it's all today and yesterday that I try to insert your expert but it doesn't open pending orders.

can you help me?

--- 帖子 #1384 ---
Hello Dazamate

Im using your EA (mt5 version), and the first order went smooth. But after that no more orders will open. I have tryed to change the magic number on all pairs, but still no luck. Even if it break the 15% mark, there wont be any open positions.

--- 帖子 #1385 ---
Mine is working ok now its Wednesday. Have you got a smiley face top right corner. All 26 pairs have Pending or now actual orders running.  Can you also see the button to CloseALL

--- 帖子 #1386 ---
Thanks for the Ea.

I initially tried the Ea before commencement of Wednesday trading and the ea drew 2 lines on the chart and I had to remove it. I later attached the Ea on the chart few minutes into Wednesday's trading, only USDCHF trade was triggered  and is already in profit before I left home.

From the my little test, I discovered that to use the Ea, one must either use VPS or allow ones' PC to remain on for some hours.

My question, must one attache the ea to individual chart?

Thanks for always willing to help

--- 帖子 #1387 ---
Smiley face, and I see all the lines but the pendants don't start. Yesterday as soon as I entered the expert, some graphs started but then nothing more.

--- 帖子 #1388 ---
Yes, you need to place the EA on each chart that you want to trade, and leave your PC on (or use a VPS).

The EA opens market orders, not pending orders, so you only get trades as and when they trigger.

The default trigger is when price touches the entry line, but you can drop the chart down to, say, M30 and set the "Enter on break and CLOSE" parameter to true, and it will then open a trade only when the price closes on or above the entry line.

--- 帖子 #1389 ---
Sorry, but as of right now, I don't code for MT5...maybe later.

--- 帖子 #1390 ---
In the terminal section look in the Experts and Journal to see if there are any errors. Something looks like it may be working as it says Orders 7 on the top. How many charts have you opened with the ea on.  Also there is an option on the chart properties to show object descriptions.   Right clk on Chart and select properties. select common and last one is the option.

--- 帖子 #1391 ---
There are no mistakes.

At the moment I am using the expert who posted PaulDV a while ago

--- 帖子 #1392 ---
I'm sorry but if you are using the latest version, which looks like you are, then it should work.

--- 帖子 #1393 ---
I don't understand how it is possible. It is not the first expert I use.

Yesterday, as soon as I entered the chart, the expert put all pending orders on me. But then I saw that it was not working on certain assets and I decided to cancel everything.

Maybe it has remained in memory and is unable to open orders?

--- 帖子 #1394 ---
ah very nice, exactly the kind of patterns I was talking about, good stuff

And yeah, inputting all data in excel is timeconsuming, but then you can do a lot more stuff with the data once you find new angles. Ofcourse the 'easiest' way to do this is to import tick or 1m data and let excel do all the analysis, but setting this up for a new strategy is still quite time consuming even with good excell skills, and this way you don't have the advantage of gaining new insights just from seeing hundreds of trades.

For example normally when I research a breakout strategy I at least include Date (full date), Time, bars until trade trigger, sl size, directional move in pips, with monthly direction or not, with weekly direction or not and anything else you might want to research. Take into account that unless you highly suspect it might be usefull that it's not worth including as this does cost a lot of time. Especially because you need at the very least 500 trades to say anything statistically relevant at all, while in reality you want at least 2000 trades. This last part is where automating everything obviously comes in.

--- 帖子 #1395 ---
I suggest you close Mt4 and start again. If you can reboot I would even do that. I have had some funny things happen in the past where a recompiled ea hasn't been loaded.  I am running this on a dedicated pc. Worth a try.

--- 帖子 #1396 ---
I built a script which outputs data into a csv file for as many weeks as required for all pairs but no one was interested. This is an old one.

ah nice, which data exactly?

Whenever real work is involved, you can be sure that people back off very quickly , imho this is the almost the only usefull thing to discuss here but oh well

Much easier to ask for someone else to build an EA and do no actual work yourself, potentially blaming the person that did all the work for you when losses are made afterwards.

EDIT: checking out your data now tnx

--- 帖子 #1398 ---
I already posted my MT4 & 5 Robot and Indicator here. Comes with trailing stop options, move to break even, various other parameters you can test, including the original stop loss and entry methods from this strategy.

--- 帖子 #1399 ---
Data looks nice, your just going to need a whole lot more. I would highly suggest adding in winning %, max R:R reached and such info in order to make it more 'workable'

Also on a sidenote I don't really understand why people want to trade so many pairs, why not either pick the ones with lowest spread or the ones that perform the best. This seems to go far beyond the realm of diversification and far into the realm over overcomplication and overpaying for spread.

--- 帖子 #1400 ---
I might need some help to add those.  One of my skills was that of a programmer (during the 70's) programming to a specification.  There's not much I can't do once I have the idea or formula.  I did all pairs as I was going to try and see which were the best and also what effect having multiple orders open.

It may be helpful to know on what day a trade is opened that reaches TP or SL.

We could see if the operations open on Wednesday are better than those on Thursday

--- 帖子 #1402 ---
Hi guys, there are many pairs that broke either the low or the high of monday-tuesday. What i can see here is that many of them are either touching the highs or lows of 2018. Will they break out of the 2018 support or resistance, lets see.

--- 帖子 #1403 ---
Noted thank you.  Just added it in.  Interesting the test sample over the last 4 weeks shows very few Wednesdays.  I haven't thoroughly checked it yet.

Just working on Profit percentage.  Not sure if my calculations will be correct especially the Lo Break.  What price do you recommend to divide by and is Friday Close ok.

eg (FriClose-HiBrk)/FriClose% && (LoBrk-FriClose)/FriClose%

--- 帖子 #1404 ---
Ok, here is the code to produce the analysis .csv file which will be put in the Files folder under MQL. It has to go there no choice.

I haven't done anything to make it user friendly for configuration but a bit of thought you can see how it works.

The important bit is:

init section change Analyse to 1 if you want details for that pair

The number of Days analysed is set in the input section.

I have built this as an EA and not a script as I was getting some strange results as a script and thought it easier to test/fix.

Add it as an EA to a blank chart. It only runs when it is added or something changes like changing the timeframe.

It doesn't do anything else.

I'm am still checking results but if anyone does look at it and there are errors or additions let me know.

Again, good stuff!

Most of the variables are easy to understand indeed, and as long as you have succes per trade (so R:R reached), you can always test it for different variables and that's all that really matters.

% profit should just be the R:R reached imo. I usually just take the breakout range in pips, and the maximum move in pips, add in the spread (which i input as a variable) and divide those

so breakout range is 50 pips, maximum move is 200 pips, R:R is 1:4.

Seeing as you have 2 options for close here, friday close or a set R:R with a friday close if that isn't reached, recording the seperate maximum move that is reached during the week should be enough I think, unless i'm missing something.

--- 帖子 #1406 ---
Also vis a vis more variables, it would be interesting to know wether the trade was in accordance with the monthly/yearly direction. Monthly is most likely a lot more interesting than yearly. Can be calculated by measuring the distance between the trade open and the monthly open. Positive number in pips would be in accordance with monthly direction (and by measuring in pips you would see how strong the move is) and negative number would indicate against the monthly direction.

A lot of systems perform better when traded with monthly or weekly direction (yearly for longer term trades), some perform a lot better in strong moves (so far from open) and some perform better from consolidation type situations (so close to open)

--- 帖子 #1407 ---
Very nice. I'm trying it but I don't understand the LoBrk voice. How do I know what day he broke the level?

Does it only work with GBPJPY?

It would be interesting to know how much is the percentage of the weekly trend at the time of the opening of the operation. In this way we could check and understand if the trend is running out or not over a certain strength

--- 帖子 #1408 ---
LoBrk is the Low Break Value i.e Low of Mon/Tues less 15% as per the rules. HiBrk the opposite.

Please see edited repost there is a multiple one there.  pt2

--- 帖子 #1409 ---
Sorry I said badly.

In the csv in the LoBrk column I read whole numbers (4/5).

What does it mean?

I highlighted in green.

--- 帖子 #1410 ---
My understanding of R:R would be measuring the Risk i.e. StopLoss vs the Return(Profit).  I've never really got my head around this because Risk vs Return would/could be different for every trade.  Volatility will also have a significant impact.  Looking at the numbers this could be a very profitable system and with some tuning even more so.

I'm also in agreement about trend direction.

I'll add in trend direction based on a simple MA to start with.

--- 帖子 #1411 ---
Yes optimal R:R calculations are endless and partly pointless, optimization will just lead to futile results, as is the case with nearly all optimization on past results.

It's mainly just to get an indication; is it better to trade for long term gains, or are the breakouts usually short and then reverse. I mean who is to say an R:R of 1:.5 might not yield infinitely better results (just as an example). For example the main strategy I trade I use 1:10 TP's only, while it is theoretically also possible to be profitable on 1:1 and 1:2 etc the higher tp's are statistically a lot better, but eventually the number 10 is just practical, 11.2 would be optimal, but again over-optimization is just always lurking around the corner.

Perhaps I completely miss you point here though, because I don't fully understand what part of this way of viewing R:R you say you can't wrap your head around.

also MA can be good, does roughly the same thing. Monthly open is my personal preference as it's more objective than an MA number

--- 帖子 #1412 ---
Today positions

--- 帖子 #1413 ---
I actually think we are on the same page. I have put in the MA direction based on a two 21MAs over a 5 day period. Sufficient to get a general direction.

MA1=iMA(name,1440,55,0,MODE_SMA,PRICE_CLOSE,cnt);

MA2=iMA(name,1440,55,0,MODE_SMA,PRICE_CLOSE,cnt+5);

if(MA1>MA2) {Trend="Long";}

if(MA1<MA2) {Trend="Short";

--- 帖子 #1425 ---
I agree with everything you say 100%. I do what I can visually and longhand because I neither have the excel skills nor the EA capable enough to get all of these stats. I am also very bad at using the back tester. It's a good thing I believe in the backtester about 0.01%. The only thing it's good for is testing the functionality of an EA. Results and stats on a strategy/EA mean nothing.

--- 帖子 #1426 ---
Sorry but my English is not the best and I struggle to understand certain terms. I'm practicing

In the screen I highlighted the last break but the number 5 means that he broke on Friday? I understand it broke Thursday

--- 帖子 #1427 ---
This reminded me of something I was thinking while I was visually backtesting the 12 pairs. I very rarely seen any pairs go to 1:3 or 1:4 or 1:5 etc. Take these stats with a grain of salt though. It's only the past year.

--- 帖子 #1435 ---
Yeah, I'm taking it cautious this week and aiming only for 1:1.

--- 帖子 #1436 ---
Nothing wrong with that, could be an early indication of a longer term phenomenon. As long as you remind yourself of that it's perfectly fine. But a lot of people view 1 or 2 weeks of data as definite, precise and statistically viable data and then it becomes a big problem.

--- 帖子 #1437 ---
Agreed.  Also I have tried running my EA in the Strategy Tester and it takes a long time for one week.  I haven't got it to finish yet.  Not sure if it can handle pending orders.  Its a little low down on the priority list.

These are unusual times, just hope we don't get caught out if and when we go live.  Checking past results isn't a completely bad idea. No guarantee though.

--- 帖子 #1438 ---
There is also an error in the StopLoss columns which is proving difficult to find. The code looks good but is giving some strange results.

Edit:  Found the problem but not the solution.  Not going to be easy unless I rebuild part of the EA for lower timeframes. Ignore this column for the time being.

"The highs and lows of Monday and Tuesday often form the low or the high of the week."

@ PaulDV

I didn't understand why you didn't put a SL

--- 帖子 #1442 ---
Great stuff

Are the results based on the default values of the EA once loaded onto the chart??

--- 帖子 #1443 ---
OK, so here is my opinion on this strategy.

I think the main reason why this is working, is because current market conditions are making it work. Take away the conditions that are fueling this strategy, and it will likely cease to perform as well as it has been thus far.

In other words, this strategy is more like gambling in my opinion. It works for now, but there may be no longevity to it. It's important to understand this.

Nothing beats Technical Analysis. I would hope the people using this strategy agree with this, because if a time comes when it no longer works, and you have been lazy and haven't learned how to do technical analysis, not only will your cash cow run out of milk, but you will be desperately scrambling to find the next best thing and likely lose time and money in the process.

The point I am making here is don't put all your eggs in one basket. Learn how to do proper technical analysis. It will be far more beneficial to you in the long run than this strategy likely ever will be.

I'm not saying you should quit the strategy. Use it for as long as it works, but be sure to delve deeper into understanding how the markets work and how to read price action. You will be thankful you did.

--- 帖子 #1444 ---
I'm not agree

if the market is flat, you will not win with any strategy

--- 帖子 #1445 ---
Current market conditions are not normal so any wins or losses that this strategy provides in this times are not relevant. When things normalize then you can argue that this strategy works.

So bragging how this is good is useless.

--- 帖子 #1446 ---
Well, that's you. It doesn't describe me.

Thanks OP for putting this strategy out there. And huge kudos to those of you who have added inidicators, ideas, comments, and suggestions. Even with my ultra conservative entry/exit this approach perfectly suits my trading style and has been wonderfully profitable. Again - THANKS.

--- 帖子 #1448 ---
Nothing wrong with TA, however, I'm sorry to disagree, as I have just completed a visualiser to look back as far as the eye can see I think you will be pleasantly surprised.  Not the "Holy Grail", but then nothing is.

Not you necessarily but why do people just post opinions without posting any facts or research.

This strategy isn't bad but may probably be better long term with a trend filter if only a simple MA, a breakeven and trailing stop.

This is an EA and runs on initialisation.  Only lines drawn no csv file output.  Just change tf to run or new chart.

And thats not strictly true either a long as when you say dead you mean flat or low volatility.

--- 帖子 #1450 ---
and by price action you see it and dont trade that,but with this strategy you will trade anyway

--- 帖子 #1451 ---
I agree with this. But systemically throwing pending orders up on 20 or more pairs and hoping for the best isn't the best approach to trading the market in my opinion. There are a number of essential things a person using this strategy should consider before placing a trade. The OP mentioned some of these things.

A for me, I am going to bow out of this tread. I would rather use my time to improve on my own breakout strategy than rely so heavily on something that, in my opinion, amounts to nothing more than gambling.

Really thanks for your amazing work.... I did a mistake because i didn't change magic number for every pair so Ea open just first order and no more... I've changed now for every pair and it's ok

Just a question about MA trailing stop.... i suppose ma value is related to tf....which tf do you suggest to use ?

Thanks again

--- 帖子 #1455 ---
I sincerely hope that pointing out the obvious, that this is not the holy grail and that because the strategy is working in current market conditions won't necessarily mean it will work in other market conditions, is so extremely obvious to everyone it did not need pointing out.

Anyone who thinks that won't succeed as a trader anyways so can't really see the value in those statements any which way I look at it

Ofcourse a lot more research has to be done in order to conclude whether this can only be traded in highly trending market conditions or perhaps it's solid enough to trade flatter markets as well, seeing how the R:R is quite low this might be the case anyways.

No one is saying this strategy will always work, so why go on arguing that people who never outed this belief should retract something they never stated. Hope that sentence still makes enough sense lol.

happy trading, happy researching...

Okay after checking this week i can see that based on the Calculator this pairs were hit the TP: EUR-AUD, GBP-JPY, GBP-USD, GBP-CAD, EUR-GBP.

And ongoing are EUR-CAD, USD-JPY, USD-CHF.

--- 帖子 #1457 ---
FYI I have been trading the GBPUSD exclusively with an idea similar to this but on the premise of the Monday hi lo breakout with a reversal strategy if initial trade fails

Its been pretty damn consistant over the 4 yrs I have traded it

I sincerely hope people wouldn't be so naive to think only experienced traders who ought to know better aren't the only ones visiting this thread! The statement is a warning for people who lack experience, for people who don't know better.

--- 帖子 #1459 ---
Understood. But 'similar' isn't 'same as', and just because you had success using a 'similar' strategy with GBPUSD for the past 4 years, it doesn't mean you would produce the same results if you suddenly decided to try it on 20 or more pairs at a time, which is what people have been essentially doing here.

But I think you are smart to limit it to one pair. Very smart indeed!

I am interested in seeing your strategy.

--- 帖子 #1460 ---
I've limited my pair selection down to 7 for this strategy. I'm giving serious consideration to only trading GU. GU and EU had the best stats over the last year with this strategy and since they are correlated I would think it would be smart to only trade one of the two pairs......and since I have been mainly trading Cable for the last year or so anyway, it only makes sense to stick with GU. But to be honest, when I start trading this strategy seriously I will be trading it as a basket with my 7 pairs and I will have an overall TP and SL. I will honer individual TP's and SL's along the way but in general I will have an overall TP% and SL%.

I’m sorry, but I still don’t understand...all my trades have a stop loss.

Can you explain what you mean?

--- 帖子 #1465 ---
The second version has a fix for the magic number, so you don’t have to use a different number for each pair.

The MA trailing stop used a simple moving average of the period you set, and it uses the current timeframe.  I don’t have any recommendations on this as i haven’t backtested any scenarios yet to determine what works for each pair.

I'm not use TP, I close all position few hours before market close on friday.

I only trade pairs with low spread. I wrote about it here.

I use script where the default setting is 25%. Give an example where 15%, on which pair? I will double check for this moment.

@ PaulDV

sorry for our misunderstanding about my comments # post 1419

on your board for GBPCAD you displayed a loss of 155 pips

so I thought you didn't put a SL since you should have been stopped at 65 pips with a SL ratio 50 %

EDIT your EA is working like a charm ...no bug so far

I hope I have been clear this time

--- 帖子 #1479 ---
I use the smBreakout-2D1-Weekly v1.0.ex4 indicator and script. It works well. I manually enter one more position. Can someone create a script for entering two positions?

1st position 0,03 lot:

Input = 25%

PT = PT1 indicator

SL = 50% (range axis)

2.position 0.01 lot:

Input = PT1 indicator

PT = PT2 indicator

SL = 25% (first position input)

It works like closing 2/3 of the position on PT1 and sliding SL beyond BE. The rest of the position continues on PT2.

--- 帖子 #1480 ---
flat is basically ranging, therefore use a ranging strategy. so this comment aint true

--- 帖子 #1481 ---
Thank you!

I am following your advice this week and I am also using your own currencies.

Have you noticed an increase in pips not using TP?

--- 帖子 #1482 ---
Range trading can generally be implemented at any time, but it proves to be most effective when the forex market lacks direction, with no discernible long-term trend in sight. On the other hand, range trading proves to be at its weakest during a trending market, especially if market directional bias isn’t accounted for.

--- 帖子 #1483 ---
Yep, you are right semicolon. I never have to bother as my spreadsheet is setup to always open that way. I didn't actually check the output.  You can do text to column but its just easier to tick the semicolon box to define how the fields are separated.

--- 帖子 #1484 ---
Ah, now I understand.

No, the range on GBPCAD for Monday/Tuesday was 239, so the SL should have been 120, but there was a problem with V1 of the EA that I didn't discover until later, which meant the SL was calculated at 155.  No biggie - it was just a 1% risk.

--- 帖子 #1485 ---
Any chance you can make an excel calculator for this, or anyone here that can should help out, would be deeply appreciated, thanks

--- 帖子 #1486 ---
Hi Paul, I am testing your expert but on a couple of assets the take profit and stop loss were wrong.

The fibonacci lines were very short but not precise according to the lines.

The example is on EUR / CAD and USD / JPY.

Can it be caused by the spread?

I believe that at the time of the opening of the operation, the spread was too high but since the spread fell below the threshold, the expert opened the operation even with a breakout already taking place.

Could this be the reason?

The orange lines are the opening levels of the expert.

It also happened to us in Usd / Jpy while the other assets are correct

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

On USD / JPY you can see better.

The TP, I spsotato I in manual.

The SL, on the other hand, is incorrect

I did have similar problems with some pairs also. By experimenting I put the EA on H1 charts and it was then perfect. It might be worth trying on yours too.

Why bother with a script when the ea works well. Just put it on the charts you want on Tuesday and leave it overnight. All orders created Weds morning. Job done.

--- 帖子 #1491 ---
Thanks for the feedback.

Having looked at the charts, I suspect that it's to do with price moving after the order has been triggered.

The EA won't place an order exactly on the entry line - the entry line is there purely as a visual marker for the trader - rather it is waiting for the price to reach OR EXCEED the trigger price.  It then calculates the entry price based on the CURRENT PRICE at that time.

So, if the price is moving quickly, it is possible for the price to be a few pips higher (or even lower) than the trigger point.

--- 帖子 #1492 ---
Hi PaulDV

Just a question about your excellent EA

With regular Trailing Stop , the Trailing Stop Start is in pips

but what the meaning of Trailing Stop Step 0=auto ?

--- 帖子 #1493 ---
Thanks for the reply, not script but .xlsx file calculator. Anyway I'm on mobile this period and will be for a while so I just want an excel calculator based on his settings. I intend to enter trades manually for few pairs. I'm new here so If you can help with the calculator it would be great

--- 帖子 #1494 ---
Sure, no problem.

Most trailing stops have two parts to them:The number of pips to trail by (the trail distance). The number of pips to move the stop by (the trail step). E.g. if you set the trail distance to 20 and the trail step to 5, the stop will stay where it is until the price is more than 25 pips ahead of the stop, and the stop will then be moved up by 5 pips.

This method is usually used to provide the price with some breathing room, but to then lock in some additional profit each time the price makes a higher high.

If you set the trail step to zero, this removes the 'stepping' feature.

E.g. if you set the trail distance to 20, and the step to 0, the stop will stay where it is until the price is more than 20 pips ahead of the stop, and the stop will then be moved to 20 pips behind the current price.

I hope that all makes, sense, but please ask if you have any further questions.

--- 帖子 #1495 ---
I thought it was so.

The price probably made a small gap.

In these cases, however, the SL and TP are calculated from the open price of the transaction and not from the fibonacci values.

I closed the trade on EUR / CAD today but it would have been TP.

--- 帖子 #1496 ---
I assumed that you were not using the "Enter of break and CLOSE of signal line"...is that correct?

The reason I ask is that I was using this week to test that feature out, and have noticed that it has caused at least four of my trades to miss their TP1 target (which was the opposite of what it was for!).  Consequently I shall be removing this feature in the next version.

--- 帖子 #1497 ---
Exact.

I am using the default settings.

--- 帖子 #1498 ---
OK PaulDV many thx

I'm going to use it next week

--- 帖子 #1499 ---
Also called slippage. Any market order on Mt4 should define an amount of slippage when the ea sends the order. This is one of the differences between using stop orders as they are executed when hit. There are of course pros and cons as I detailed some time ago. Pending orders are not conditional whereas market ones can be. Pending orders are sitting on the brokers server so once set you can shut down and wait for Friday.  Market orders require your PC to be on all the time. No right or wrong just different trade offs.  Of course there are 100s of ways to program this. Trust that helps.

Good trading

--- 帖子 #1500 ---
Thanks, but not quite: slippage is where the price moves from the price that the order is requesting, and if the new price is sufficiently far from the requested price, then the order will be rejected. My EA has a setting for it which I've defaulted to 2 pips, to avoid orders being rejected when slippage is small, and records errors due to slippage and shows them on the information panel.

But this isn't slippage that we were talking about, rather I was trying to explain the fact that the EA won't necessarily open the order exactly on the signal line (like a pending would most likely do), because the price can go higher before the EA detects that it now needs to place an order. In the example given, the order was opened 5.5 pips higher than the signal line. If it had been due to slippage then the order would have been rejected and an error recorded in the logs and shown on screen, so it was more likely a small spike in price beyond the signal line.

--- 帖子 #1501 ---
hello paul,

i'm testing your EA, btw. big thanks to you.

i'm wondering if a second trade is made by intention?

this is NZDUSD in H4.

--- 帖子 #1502 ---
Er...no, that's not supposed to happen!

I did have that bug in my testing before I released it, but I was sure that I had fixed it, otherwise I would not have released it.

I'll take a look and see if I can reproduce it.

Can you confirm which version this was with?  Did you do anything out of the ordinary such as removing the EA and restarting it, or switching timeframes?  Anything like that?

I've just run it through the tester, and it worked flawlessly:

I am amazed at the effectiveness and simplicity of this strategy. all pairs have obtained a minimum of 1-1 risk-benefit. examples.

--- 帖子 #1513 ---
I believe that maybe we should be using a 2:1 target in times like these when the ranges are substantially bigger than normal, and they are trending. In normal conditions I believe that using 1:1 targets is the way to go. We are not in normal conditions though. Maybe use 3:1 as our overall target but take 1/2 off at 1:1 or something.....just a thought. I personally will always use 1:1 as my target most likely and I don't like taking 1/2 off my trades. I only mention it because i know it's a popular strategy.

--- 帖子 #1514 ---
Every trade is different of course, and hindsight is always right. I like having a TP in place in case of sudden spikes, usually at 2 to 1

Look what can happen  crude oil news, price went up, CAD got strong, ah, that’s CHF so affected a lot of pairs

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1515 ---
Bojack, 2-1 is feasible thanks to the trend. Another option is to move the SL to the entry point once the first TP has been reached.

--- 帖子 #1516 ---
I'm glad you posted this picture Erebus. Look at where price went after it hit the TP2.....it went back up to our SL almost to the pip. I seen this too many times during my visual backtest so I think that instead of using a 50% SL we can use a 55% SL to avoid times like these.

--- 帖子 #1517 ---
I wonder if the Stop Loss was 50% of Entry (instead of Low) to the High, in this example

Let’s see, that would be... Anyone good with maths?

Rough guess, about 7.5% above the current 50%, so about right where you say, let me work on it with Fibonacci

--- 帖子 #1518 ---
I was using 50% of the range for SL......so it would be 65% from entry.

--- 帖子 #1519 ---
That works in this case, the TP’s have to be moved out as well to keep the ratio

But I’d rather take the 2 to 1, most will exit on retracement like this

No guarantee that price will go back down for even more profit

So the question is, does the extra stop loss benefit in this case? NO

Only the EA testing guys can give a better picture of long term outcomes

Always a delicate balance to achieve the correct balance between RISK and REWARD

Cheers

--- 帖子 #1520 ---
I also seen a good number of times where price would barely reach our 1:1 target or just barely short. So maybe adjusting our TP target to a little shy of 1:1. So adjusting both the SL and the TP slightly. Both in a direction that would decrease our R:R. I know that's not what you would normally do but it might help the strike rate enough to make it worth it overall. Only visually backtesting with good notes and forward testing will tell us.

--- 帖子 #1521 ---
Damn, sorry I didn't keep better notes when I did all that viusal backtesting. oh well, maybe someone else will out do me and come up with much better and in depth stats. Just to remind everyone, we're not looking for "averages". We are looking at "frequency distribution" (a mathematical function showing the number of instances in which a variable takes each of its possible values.) For example it would be nice to know how many TP's and SL's a pair hit when the range was between 20-30, 30-40, 40-50, etc...We wouldn't be looking for the average range and the average amount of times it hit 1:1, 2:1, 3:1.

Haha some decent memes indeed.

But the problem are not these market conditions ofcourse, it's just the longer term, like you said somewhere yourself. It's really not so productive to discuss how well the system is performing right now is it? Just one look on any chart and you can see godlike trending conditions, honestly in 8 years i've rarely seen such neat curves on charts for so many months, if you cannot make money in these conditions you really ought to take a long hard look at yourself (unless ofcourse your a range trader but all trend followers and breakout people should be raking money like crazy).

The only interesting part is how you'll deal with the inevitable 'other' market conditions, whatever may come next and after that. I think Bojack is trying to figure that out, that's not so bad is it? In fact like I say I think that is almost the only productive thing to discuss here anymore. You got the EA to handle stuff, as long as these market conditions hold you just have to keep it turned on and gaze at your profits, what else is there to do besides investigate the strategy more, see what it's weaknesses might be in the future and how you might negate these weaknesses.

Just looking back prices can move in one direction for sometime.  This week has been a bit choppy but overall not much different to when money moves from one place to another.  As I said many posts ago although its a good strategy I consider it a bit crude.  GBPJPY missed the TP by a hair and now posting a loss. These are the trades we need to tighten up on and not let a winner turn into a loss.  Looking at a trend to my eyes it doesn't seem to make a lot of difference.  Price does seem in general to breakout the way you would expect.  Looking forward to closing all trades and doing some hindsight analysis.

when i did my visual backtesting for stats, I moved my SL to BE once the trade reached the half way point to my TP1. At this point you could slap a trail stop on there or just keep moving your stop as price gets closer to your TP.

I don't like these numbers anyhow as they are to contrived and artificial. I will let next week go and then look at system performance improvement. A lot of the higher vol pairs actually have made losses.

Damn that was a long back read. For a 3-month old thread this has gone up 78 pages. Last couple weeks actually contributed 50 pages. Went through the whole thing this afternoon. Now all caught up.

Anyway. Wanted to say a quick "Hey!" to you all. Expect to see a bit of me moving forward.

Will be trading WTF on a live account starting next Wednesday 3/25.
All 28 pairs, 1% of max balance, 2:1 RR, move break even at 1:1. Will let trade hit SL, BE, or TP. Following Erebus' Entry, SL, and TP recommendations.
Will post results and probably screen shots. (Anymore of that virtual snickers available?)

Thanks Erebus for providing the Fib parameters. Saved me probably a couple months of tweaking, testing, second guessing, and stressing.
Shout out as well to 4ecstasy for starting this thread!

Have a good weekend.

--- 帖子 #1548 ---
Enjoying this thread. I see two systems here, I can see the WTF System (Erebus) and the Mon-Tue system (Paul). How do these systems differ in their settings of the EA?

All positions closed.

On screenshot in red rectangle is my manual trade, it was mistake, wrote about it here.

This is the first week of 7 with a negative result. Negative result is also a result.

My opinion on lots and deposits for this system is 0.01 lots for $2000 minimum. So as not to worry much about the DD and SL.

Have a nice weekend and be careful with

That looks like 21 pairs, is that correct. I ran with 26 and made an approx 195 profit with 0.01 lots

--- 帖子 #1552 ---
Are you still going with your decision of not applying any TP in the future? Because going by your lost trades, most of those pairs were deep in profit but eventually reversed

--- 帖子 #1553 ---
Result of each trader will be different. Different pairs, different spreads, different entry levels and SL, different TP and position support(trailing, BE).

More different cases - more statistics

Congratulations with your good profit!

Yes, no TP. I saw good profit after reverse (out of position after SL), but I have not good idea yet how to manage positions for good balance in risk/reward.

I am keen like a machine for next week. Opened a Demo account linked to ForexFactory as well. My disruptive travels to the USA cost me dearly this week as I did not trade the system (I have been trading live). I should have..could have if I put a little more effort in. Will not let this happen again.

--- 帖子 #1563 ---
The image below is the outcome of trading without SL and TP, closed manually

--- 帖子 #1564 ---
My second trade using the script failed, does it mean the script is bad, no, the scripts’ entries where great but the management of the trades by me was wrong.

I could have move the SL to secure some pips in all winning trades and let the other trades run freely until Friday or risked been stopped out by a reversal, whichever happens could had ended profitably, lesson learned.

Is there any way to adjust the script to secure some profits without human intervention? If this is doable, all weeks’ trading will end positively.
Or I may knock off all SL and allow the trades to go on, more analysis is needed and suggestions from you guys will be great

--- 帖子 #1565 ---
How about to use some kind of safe SL:

If price reverse and CLOSE above 50% (sl) line, only then order will be closed at sl.

This will cut off news spikes, etc. But there are some risk of getting big loss. Need your opinions

ps: this method Should be used in opening orders too. BO - price closing out of the first 2 days hilo. We are using stop orders - its not correct i think.

2 orders: Agressive entry 15%, or safe entry 25%;

sl 50%. TP 130%

after TP at 80% first order closed, 2nd orders sl goes to be.

Or 1 order with trigered trailing with 50%range at the 50% range point

Its a safe trading

--- 帖子 #1566 ---
Your Scripts' entry is great, the main problem here is managing the trades, many coders and traders here are very knowledgeable, they all should provide us a good solution this weekend.

Meanwhile, you don't need 2000 dollars to trade this system.

One can reduce the numbers of pairs to trade, 8 or 10 most consistent winning pairs on 100 dollars is not a bad idea, but how to manage the the trades is all that is needed.

Covid 19 has tripled market volatility, 2000 dollars can be wiped out easily even trading 0.01 lot size.

--- 帖子 #1567 ---
All positions must have SL and TP, this is the fund management. We do not know how the market will continue, it is a wild beat. You should management by fund ratio (eg 10 or 20%) don't care about market range. I use balance ratio when trade with real account

--- 帖子 #1568 ---
Hi SpikeHunter. Thank you for the excellent work to create statistics on this strategy. I know you do not wish to work on this further but I am hoping you will do this one thing to correct a small issue which is going to improve the results a lot.

The output does not record the week's High and Low. (Preferably this should be the Wed to Friday High or Low) For example GJ this week was a win at 50% of range but if only closed at end of Friday it is a loss and is recorded as such in the csv at the moment.

Could you add these Highs and Lows please?

MoTuBo_EA Version 1.02

Having used the EA for all of my trades this past week, and based on feedback from others, I have made some small amendments to my EA, and recommend that anyone using previous versions upgrade to this version.

Changes:Removed the option of entering a trade on the break and CLOSE of a candle above the signal line. It turned out that this actually caused 3 losses which would have been wins! When adding the EA to a chart after Tuesday, it would immediately open a trade if the price was beyond the signal line. This has been fixed. Added a trigger factor for the Moving Average Trailing Stop. This is a multiplier of the stop loss. e.g. if the factor is set to 1, when the price reaches a profit of 1 x the stop loss, the trailing stop is triggered and the stop then follows the EMA line, using the period specified. For the Moving Average trailing stop, the M30 timeframe is recommended (and you will need to set the TP Calc Method to "None").

As always, any feedback is gratefully received.

--- 帖子 #1570 ---
Hi guys,

Please excuse my English or my way of wording, English is not my first language.

Interesting thread, I've ran PaulDV's EA for some backtesting (thanks Paul and others for your work). Apparently the EA works very well since the virus stepped in, but any backtest before that gives mixed results. I'm not saying you guys should, but I will put in some real money and run this EA for a while for some gains. My feeling is this system will be very short lived.

Otherwise, I think this could work to place pending orders and for those that know some PA should cancel those orders that don't fit and then manage the trades as they develop according to the PA.

Just my 2 cents.

Chris

--- 帖子 #1571 ---
I was asking a while back (in the EURJPY M15 system 80%+ forum) to have one of the EA there modified so that it only opened a trade when it closed outside the box. I wanted it to only open though when the candle closed a certain (not to large) level above or below the box. Maybe that's why some of your previous trades didn't work (I think the thinking was it should only be traded if the close wasn't to far outside the box high or low). Would be great if you could keep it in as an option and with a setting to only open at a close within a max level above or below the box range. Anyway..great job on this here and when i get a chance will try it out. Thanks

This was the EA but its expired and stayfoolish disappeared

https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...9#post10837029

--- 帖子 #1572 ---
Thats right. Something like no more then 40%-50% from the box line is ok for closing triger

--- 帖子 #1573 ---
I had $235 profit with .01 lot, 28 pairs and Gold were set for orders.

hi paul,

really thanks for the ea, before i tried to backtest and i nopticed that if you put no tp, the ea never closes positions, is it possible to add thie option to close on friday? so every week we could have an opportunity. i saw that your screens have towo tp, but i can't figure it out how to add other tps, because having a rr 1/1 is a bit short for this kind of system and if i put rr 1/2 then it doesn't close the position on friday but it awaits till the price reaches or the sl or the tp. then an other thing is: i can't understand how the be works, sorry… cause when i put be at sl factor 1, well it actually doesn't and closes all the position in few pips profit. thanks man for everything and sorry for being such annoying, maybe this things could improve better all the system

--- 帖子 #1576 ---
Why You do not read this thread?

--- 帖子 #1577 ---
Same settings 25% entry point, 50% sl, tp was not fixed.

--- 帖子 #1578 ---
PaulDV, thanks for the great EA!

It appears that when I select a SL that's greater than 50%, the SL actually gets smaller (tighter). As an example, if I set a SL of 55%, the "long" SL is higher in the range box and the "short" SL is lower in the range box. If I select a SL of 45%, the SL's reverse and appear as I thought they would have in the 55% case.

Is this just a matter of semantics or do I misunderstand how the "% of SL" works?

Thanks in advance for the clarification.

--- 帖子 #1579 ---
Well, when your feeling finds something that is long lived, be sure to come back here and share it with us

--- 帖子 #1580 ---
Your feelings are totally irrelevant. If you want to contribute please provide some real analysis, you could start by sharing your backtests

--- 帖子 #1581 ---
You have to think of the SLs and TPs from the start of the range, not the start of the entry. So yes, 55% will result in a tighter SL than 45% since it is nearer to the entry, but further away from start of range.

--- 帖子 #1582 ---
Hi PaulDV,

Thanks for the hard work! Currently running backtests to see best parameters.

Wondering if there is a way to close trades on Fridays with the latest EA ver.1.02?

--- 帖子 #1583 ---
Those are pipettes. 0.1 Pip = 1 Pipette or 10 Pippetes = 1 Pip

--- 帖子 #1584 ---
Hi I have been testing the WTF Trader in MT5 through its strategy tester. There seems to be a few issues and I am not sure if it is just in the tester as the code expects us to close trades ourselves by Friday.

I am getting trades rolling over multiple weeks and then it does not book new trades in the next weeks until the old trade is closed.

Can you include a command to close the trade by Friday close if TP or SL has not been hit?

--- 帖子 #1585 ---
Yes, if you select None for the TP Calculation, then the trades will need to be closed in some other way.

Usually this would be in conjunction with the break even and/or trailing stop feature, or by closing them manually for best return. I will consider adding an option to automatically close trades at a given point in the week.

Regarding the break even factor, I checked the code and it's not working properly, so I will correct this in the next version.

--- 帖子 #1586 ---
Thanks for the suggestion.

I've taken a look at the thread, and it's a very similar strategy to the one being used here.  That said, I'm not sure how effective the feature you mention would be, and given my experience with using a break and close, I'm not too keen on spending more time on it right now.  But I'll bear it in mind for a possible addition in future.

--- 帖子 #1587 ---
Thanks for mentioning this - you haven't misunderstood...it's a bug!

I'll make a change for the next version.

MoTuBo_EA Version 1.03

Some minor fixes.

Note: if you have already downloaded version 1.02, you don't need to download this version unless:You want to use the factor of the stop loss to trigger the break even. You want to use a stop loss ratio other than 50%. You just want to...

Changes:Fixed the break even "Factor of Stop Loss" function. Corrected the stop loss calculation when using a ratio of anything other than 50%. As always, any feedback is gratefully received.

--- 帖子 #1589 ---
Hi Paul,

I have tried your latest EA version 1.03, and I am still having problems with the Breakeven. Whether it be BE method of 'pips profit' or 'Factor of SL', whenever the BE is hit on the strategy tester, it will 'close at stop' and stop backtesting.

Also, I must admit I don't really understand how the BE works. Is it different from a trailing stop? Please help.

Thank you so much again for your hard work!

--- 帖子 #1590 ---
Hi transmat,

Thanks for the EA.

I test your EA and 2 different TP setting .

One is close all trades on Friday

But one did not close all trades that already triggered, it only close pending orders.

Is that a bug?

--- 帖子 #1591 ---
Thanks. It was a feature in the thread and the OP was sure it worked (e.g. close not to far above below) would have been great to test it via an EA and thanks for considering it

--- 帖子 #1592 ---
Ah, thanks, that is a bug (which I have now fixed) and will be ok in the next version.

For now, simply set the "lock in pips" value to something othr than zero and it should work OK.

Break even and trailing stop ae two different things. but they can be used together.

Break even, is where you move the stop to your entry point (thus breaking even) when the price is a certain amount in profit (either in fixed pip value or a factor of the initial stop loss).  You can slo tell it to lock in profit by specifying how many pips profit to move the stop loss to.

Trailing stop does exactly what it say: the stop loss is moved periodically to follow the price each time the price moves a certain amount ahead.  There are numerous ways of moving the stop, and my EA provides a few of them.  There's no right or wrong setting really, it's simply up to you as to how you want your trades to be managed.

Hope this helps.

Hello FX5Star

Is this the same version of EA that I submit below?

I just re-tested it in backtest and for me it closes the positions still open on the day and at the scheduled time (see screenshot)

If it is version 1.1 or 1.2 it is quite possible ... forget them and use only the version that is here.

I remember that this is originally the EA of sangui, which worked very well and on which I just made a few modifications so that it takes as reference only one day and not two, following the idea of redfan.

I also add an indicator that PaulDV had already modified and on which I also intervened in order to correspond to this alternative strategy of a single day (in this case Tuesday).

Let me know if your problem is resolved.

Have a good day.

--- 帖子 #1594 ---
I appreciate the explanation so much! Now I understand  Thank you.

Hi,

Thanks for your EA, i did try back-testing, it just putting one order at the time, did it do something wrong? TIA

--- 帖子 #1596 ---
No, that's how it's supposed to work.

--- 帖子 #1597 ---
Do you mean that this is the maximum and minimum only from Tuesday to make the projection?

Is the result better than the standard?

--- 帖子 #1598 ---
Thanks for reply, i used to check all new posts but seems i missed an important one, would you please refer me to the page related to this EA, isn't it based on MOTU system? TIA

--- 帖子 #1599 ---
Hello Sorobanista,

EA works for each day of the week; just define the day that interests you for the range and the stop orders pending with TP and stopLoss will be placed in the first minutes of the next day.

On post 810 page 41,  https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...4#post12792874

redfan had suggested taking into account only one day if a peak in volatility occurred and pushed the limits of the range too far ... I had fun modifying the EA in this meaning ...

The initial strategy seems more coherent to me, but in some cases it can be an alternative; each to test according to their criteria and possibly see another strategy, on indices for example.

I finalize the other version with an opening in position H1 if only the time bar closes on the other side of the 15% of the range

( Or other % ); I'll put it on as soon as it's ready.

For the indicator, it is only Tuesday that is taken as a reference.

Have a good day.

March 23, 2020

Today in the main session there were pockets of strength and weakness. Several pairs made movements inside of the ranges and clusters. The market is starting to sort out which new trends and directions might be coming. We expect new trends to form in the next 1-2 days. Overall volatility also subsided today.

--- 帖子 #1602 ---
I have seen this post, not much explained about method of trading and it doesn't act based on MoTU rules. TIA

Not sure how you came to that conclusion - the EA follows the strategy completely.

But please enlighten me: which MoTu rules doesn’t it follow?

--- 帖子 #1604 ---
This robot was the first one I saw in not causing damage in the long run, the Monday-Tuesday System for robot was the best one I have seen so far.

What I'm happy about is that you leave the code open, so other people can also improve or make a small change.

I think this detachment is cool, I'm not a programmer, but small modifications I know how to do, when the code is closed it's very annoying all the time having to modify the configuration, or not being able to change them.

--- 帖子 #1605 ---
Hello Sorobanista,

I leave the code open because it is not mine but that of sangui originally and it does the job very well so why want to reinvent the wheel?

I only made a few modifications to adapt it to certain configurations, that's all.

Like you, I am not a programmer, there are certain things that I can do and ... much more that I do not know

Programmer is a profession and it was not mine.

The little that I know is because I was able to access open codes on the internet, so it seems normal to me to transmit, and if it helps, I am delighted.

Plus we are here on a sharing site, right ?

But I understand that others don't want to share his little secrets; everyone does as they see fit ...

If you think you have an advantage in a strategy and everyone has access to it, this advantage will disappear ... but this is far from being the case here.

Have a great day.

--- 帖子 #1606 ---
Hi thanks for the reply.

The EA i downloaded was from #1269

One more question , the original SL of this strategy is 50%. So on the EA setting  the value suppose to be 50 or -50? A little bit confused about this.

The default setting is -45 does that mean your SL is at 55%. Am i right?

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1607 ---
Hello FX5Star,

Yes that's it, 100 - 45 = 55.

The stop is therefore at 55%.

You do a quick backtest on the last days of a peer, you display the graph of this backtest and visually it is clearer.

Personally I put that but everyone does as they want.

Given the time it must be in Australia I wish you a very good night.

Hi,

I think that this market is not so easy, everyone thinks a different thing about a strategy, no matter how good it is.

Mark Fisher, who made the ACD method, wanted to publicize his method and thinks that as many people as possible would use his technique, he would become stronger.

I think you can give the perfect technique to someone and the person does not realize its value.

Unfortunately Fisher kept the important information to himself.

I thought I would post my first week results using the hi/low system. I opened a real account for $200 and I am trading micro-lots using a three currency arbitrage. I chose the eur, usd, and cad, mainly because they have the lowest margin (2%) with my broker. ( for some reason I lost a dime in the transaction when funding, so my actual starting balance was $199.90). The 5:1 gearing is a little out of my comfort zone, so I won't be adding more currencies until I get to 2:1. (If I do!)

Hey guys,

I was trading system manualy with the rules in the first post and I am very happy and sattisfied with results. Now I am starting to be little bit lazy and I would like to swich it to the EA. Please, just one question. Do I need to attach EA to all charts where I need to trade?

Thank you very much for answer.

Also thanks to starter of the thread, to the Erebus and also to the all of you which are contribute in this nice trading system. Bless you

--- 帖子 #1614 ---
Hi Paul,

I got idea how is it working, not pending orders, just i noticed an error in expert log says "Can not set timer", what it could be? I have loaded EA on H1 time.  Thanks

--- 帖子 #1615 ---
Hello sakultrader,

Yes that's it, a graph for each peers unless the EA is coded to pass several peers at the same time.

--- 帖子 #1616 ---
Alright. Let's do this. Will trade 21 pairs today. The remaining 7 pairs I trade using different systems.
Below list of my pending orders (in both Short and Long positions).AUDCAD AUDCHF AUDJPY AUDNZD AUDUSD CADCHF CADJPY CHFJPY EURAUD EURCAD EURCHF EURGBP EURNZD EURUSD NZDCAD NZDCHF NZDJPY NZDUSD USDCAD USDCHF USDJPY So overall I have 42 pending orders set up. Actually the NZDCHF BUY has already been triggered.
This is tiring isn't it? Probably since it's 6am where I am. It took me 1 hour to set up 21 pairs. But that's fine. I don't mind the work.
Let's see what the week holds. Will update once I close all trades for the week.

New week, so here we go!

Good luck. Stay green.

Hey Oxff, thankyou for that, one question, hopefully to save me going through them all, are you using 15% or 25% entry? Thanks man, appreciate your efforts.

--- 帖子 #1619 ---
PaulDV, re: your MoTuBo EA V 1.03; I've noticed, in a few cases, the Wednesday open candle is being used to set the Monday/Tuesday high/low. The example below is NZDUSD on the H4 time frame. My broker's offset is GMT +2 (Australia). By the way, the indicator I'm using is also yours.

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1620 ---
If NZDCHF triggered, I would say that you are too quick to place the orders, well known fact the NZD spreads are notoriously WIDE just after rollover time

Probably the most dangerous time to get an entry is shortly after the Tuesday (5 pm New York) close, in case it was a spike and it’s reversal time

That’s a phenomenon that always amazes me, they say the daily close is SO important, yet look at daily candles and see complete reversals from day to day, just on the candles. What was so important about the close?

--- 帖子 #1621 ---
I can't see how your NZD/CHF has triggered already as mine hasn't.

--- 帖子 #1622 ---
Placed order for most of the pairs with low spread.

Screenshot could not catch all the pending orders.

--- 帖子 #1623 ---
interesting. Do you trade this with EA?

--- 帖子 #1624 ---
Thanks.

One question, the EA did not open pending orders today but the old version 1.4 does ..see attached

Is this EA for one day system or MO-TU high low breakout?

--- 帖子 #1625 ---
Erebus, Loftboy

I am not entirely sure either. The spread is now just be about 5 pips. The high on the first hour of the Wednesday candle is still about 15.6 pips away from my entry. I wasn't able to check the spread then, but I assume it spiked by at least 10 pips higher.

I tried to hurry up the whole set up to avoid missing out on any entry (and coz I was already sleepy) but it seems like it was too early.

Erebus, after NY close, how many hours do you wait before setting up your trades to avoid this? I'm thinking of just waiting for the 1st hour candle to close.

--- 帖子 #1626 ---
Hello FX5Star,

You're not on the right version of EA.

On your screenshot, I see that you are on One day 1.1.

We are here on the 2-day strategy, Monday and Tuesday so you have to use the "MoTu_System_v1.4_Close_Wed_Thu_or_Friday". I give it to you here.

Have a good day.

I placed DEMO in the first 1 hour after New York close, but started at AUDCAD, so things settled down by the time I got to NZD

No trades triggered until now, 2 x 4 hours candles later, so as I have said, not a rush rush scalping method just because it’s Wednesday

I will use the demo trades that triggered to judge which pairs to live trade once London gets going

For some reason, all the triggered trades have AUD or NZD in them, can’t figure it out,

Hi, PaulDV

Note the position sizing all you guys trading the every pair, same 0.01 or 0.05, why?

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1632 ---
So but by then, have the pairs not already gone past the original Entries of the system? Or did you mean you are expecting to take advantage of a retrace that happens during London open?

If you're ok to share, what kind of behavior are you watching for as you study the DEMO trades from NY close to London session?

I'm guessing these are experiments at further improving the system. Or has this been the way you've been trading for a while?

Sorry for the multiple questions. Just had coffee.

--- 帖子 #1633 ---
Saw this as well. it's 6:50AM GMT where I am at, and aside from the CADJPY, all my open trades have AUD and NZD. Dunno why though.

--- 帖子 #1634 ---
In my case I'm not on a broker that allows nano trading so the minimum volume size per trade is 0.01.

I have a balance a little bit above USD 1k. Most of this morning's position size so far are somewhere between 0.005 to 0.009, so I use 0.01.

So for most of my open trades, I'm risking 2%. Still within my acceptable parameters given the number of pairs.

2. Behavior, it’s pending orders on DEMO, if they enter, that alerts me to Price moving, check the chart

3. Have more coffee

I always knew that Price moving was what Strength Meters were reading, but then it was too late

Now there is a method to get in before the strength shows itself, PRICE of course

Hi. For entry I use 25% and 50% for SL, no TP. I'll close all position at few hours before market close on friday.

I'm on that GBPJPY trade too, but on a different strategy.

EURAUD chart below. Not that impressive but still early in the week.

Hello everyone. Can this indicator use in mt4 build 1260. Thank you.

Have tried using it in build 1260, the indicator not appear on chart. Can anyone suggest which mt4 build can use indicator. Really appreciate it. Thanks again

--- 帖子 #1644 ---
Best to keep those questions to PM

But take a look at the subsequent post, big hint there!

Wow, what happened market?

Go and watch Netflix and it’s all turned on me

Maybe US session can help, come on Trump

--- 帖子 #1645 ---
Up and running and setup the same as last week. I haven't done much over the last week except sleep. Starting to feel a little better so may do a bit more. I'll see how this week goes. I am running 15% entry 50% stop and 100% tp from break out.

Edit:  going South big time at the moment. Just hang in there and we will see

--- 帖子 #1646 ---
I have been looking at just the gbp/usd  and only using mondays range for my entries. Any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #1647 ---
All entries turned against us and I dont know if its a pullback or reversal

--- 帖子 #1648 ---
Yes, with that amount of analysis buy yourself a dart board. Sorry but that's just how I see your post.

--- 帖子 #1649 ---
Thanks for the heads up.

The indicator isn't mine actually - I simply amended it slightly - but I did base the entry logic for my EA on the logic used by the indicator, so that would explain it if the EA was actually using the same range.

Can I ask if you're running the EA and the inidicator on the H4 timeframe? I only ask, as I haven't tested that scenario.

Could you switch to the H1 timeframe and show me if you have the same issue there please?

EDIT: Just found the issue - thanks - I'll post a fix for it (and the indi) for next week.

--- 帖子 #1650 ---
hi hi,

i used the ea to backtest the strategy over the last 5 years with different settings on different pairs. But the most times it ended up loosing... Someone else backtest it?

So it didn't look so good over long time

Greetings

--- 帖子 #1651 ---
Thank you for the feedback.

Yes, the EA sits and waits and will open an order on any of the days where the signal price has been breached.

--- 帖子 #1652 ---
Did you try it on all 28 pairs?  Did you use tick data?

--- 帖子 #1653 ---
Let's hope only pullback.

--- 帖子 #1654 ---
I hope so too ))

--- 帖子 #1655 ---
I find it hard to believe that you would put an ea on a live account and then ask how it works. Just plain dumb. Try it on demo, you are being reckless and/or greedy.

--- 帖子 #1661 ---
Sorry, I did miss this.

This is the same issue reported by @pantera1, and it has now been fixed (will be posted shortly).  It was including the first candle of the day (on whatever timeframe you were using) to set the range.

--- 帖子 #1662 ---
Hi Paul,

I ran EA on 26 pairs and noticed couple of things.

1- in two pairs out of 15 pairs it opened 0.02 lots instead of 0.01 while setting are similar for all.

2- Info Panel was showing not in Wed. for some pairs while other pairs had no issue with timing, some times panel shows high spread even though spread was lower at that time, both issues were fixed after refreshing EA, not sure it was just info or Ea acutely won't take trade during that warnings.

3- As already said in another posts, Expert log shows error of "Cannot set timer".

Other than it is working perfectly, BE and Trailing works fine too so far. Thanks again for great job.

--- 帖子 #1663 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #1664 ---
Hi, The timer is used to refresh the information panel (to avoid using too many resources on your PC), so if that hasn't been set for some reason, then the information panel won't be being updated.

The information panel is for information only (I have it turned off on my VPS), and the EA should be doing all of its monitoring in real time, regardless of what the panel says.

I am not aware of any reason as to why the timer cannot be set. Could you show me a screenshot of the error in the log please? I'm looking specifically for the error number - I ought to be able to work out the reason from that.

Thanks.

EDIT: I've just found out that setting timers can sometimes fail on slower PCs, or PCs using up a lot of resources (e.g. running lots of EAs).  I've made a small change that repeatedly attempt to set the time until it eventually succeeds.  There will be errors in the log, but the EA should eventually set the timer.

--- 帖子 #1665 ---
PaulDV, just to confirm; I was indeed using the H4 time frame. As per your suggestion, I tried both the indicator and the EA on the H1 time frame and can confirm, both worked exactly as they should.

Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #1666 ---
Here is the EA slightly modified to make it easier to display the stopLoss in the parameter table; there is no longer any need to put the minus sign (-) in front of the number and this number will now be the one which will correspond to the % of the range which will be subtracted if it is a buy or added if it is a sell.

Example: previously for a 55% stop it was necessary to display - 45.

Now just display...   55.

--- 帖子 #1667 ---
Its not going to be pretty this week, me fears.

--- 帖子 #1668 ---
seems like it  stay green all I can say there is two more days. Maybe we should ignored to get in any pairs right after Tuesday/early Wednesday... Idk just my thoughts

--- 帖子 #1669 ---
I am running GU, EU, UC, AU, NU, EA, EN. As of right now I have 6 open trades and i'm sitting at -0.93% in DD. I had GU already get stopped out using trail stop. I made +0.10% with GU. I'm using 1% risk per pair with a 15% entry, 50% SL and 1:1 TP. I'm moving SL to BE at 50% and trailing from there. I'm still working on the trail stop. I won't open trades after Thursday and I'll close all open trades a couple hours before market close on Friday.

--- 帖子 #1670 ---
What trailing stop you trying ?  I am looking to do this after back testing

--- 帖子 #1671 ---
Hi Paul,

this is error

2020.03.25 07:11:54.958 MoTuBo_EA AUDCHF,H1: cannot set timer (5), it is showing when adding EA to chart. not repeating later.

Is timer cause of some charts showing that Wed. started and some not (Panel info)?

Have you figured out why is it opening larger lot size? explained in previous post.

--- 帖子 #1672 ---
You should try using various trail stops and tp's and sl's and entries etc and keep stats. Let us know what you come up with. Unless your coding an EA or checking the function of an ea in accordance to the rules of the strategy....I would just stop wasting your time with the backtesting and put that effort into note/stat taking and forward testing.

--- 帖子 #1673 ---
Here is something to bear in mind,

--- 帖子 #1674 ---
How did you know I didn't try on Demo? Don't try to be a smart guy when you are actually plain dumb. Sorry I used the same language as yours.

--- 帖子 #1675 ---
Yes, as explained, the timer will be the reason for the information panel not showing the correct values.

Re the lot sizes - what is your account size, and are you using money management?  If so, then the lot size is calculated based on your account balance and the lot sizes will vary by currency pair.

--- 帖子 #1676 ---
If you had run it on a demo account for the week then you WOULD KNOW how and when it opens trades and wouldn't need to ask the questions.  I have my own EA written to the OP specification.  I understand all the rules and when it opens/closes etc etc.  Please read the thread and understand the rules before asking stupid questions.

--- 帖子 #1677 ---
Current acc. size is $1300, i used same setting (attached image) for EURCHF as well as for others, TP and SL are different for some other pairs but lot size setting remained unchanged.

--- 帖子 #1678 ---
Is there a dropdown list when you click on

“Money Management - percentage risk”

???

--- 帖子 #1679 ---
Yes, there is, i had to select fixed lot for it, thanks for help, i was lucky getting 0.01 lot for other pairs, some kind of lucky coincidence with balance amount.

--- 帖子 #1680 ---
How did you know I don't read the thread? A stupid and rude person like you has a tendency to pretend to be smart and judge other people.

--- 帖子 #1681 ---
Thank you for your work on this. Would it be possible in a future version to have trade size based on equity?

--- 帖子 #1682 ---
You're using money management at 1% of the account balance.

In the case of the EURCHF trade, the stop is 55 pips, so 1% of $1300 is $13, which across 55 pips equates to a lot size of 0.023.

So, the lot size is correct.

--- 帖子 #1683 ---
Hello herewego,

Yes it is possible but I have never done it so far.

I have already seen it in other EA but it goes back quite a long time and I do not know which ones ...

If sangui can do it or someone else ... because by the time I find it ...

--- 帖子 #1684 ---
Thats ok and I appreciate your reply. I do prefer the pending orders over the market orders, and you one works very well indeed. Thank you

--- 帖子 #1685 ---
I remind you that the EA was originally coded by sangui.

I have made only a few modifications so that it corresponds to certain needs, this within the limits of my (weak) skills.

I am also the first surprised that what I did works!

Also, if real coders can still improve it, go for it ...

--- 帖子 #1686 ---
Hi Transmat,

I had coded this in an old version of an EA for other system, I don't remember full testing it though but you may if you want to.
Inserted Code double CalculateStakeByEquity(int stakePercent ) {
double oneLotMargin = MarketInfo(Symbol(), MODE_MARGINREQUIRED);
double lotMM = (AccountEquity() / 3) / oneLotMargin * stakePercent / 100;
double lotStep = MarketInfo(Symbol(), MODE_LOTSTEP);
return NormalizeDouble(lotMM / lotStep, 0) * lotStep;
}

Note: I don't know why it's dividing by 3 there, it might be related to the system

--- 帖子 #1687 ---
Thank you sangui.

I'm going to look at this and see if I can make it work.

But I'm going to be pretty busy elsewhere today so I'm asking for a little time ...

Nice to see you again, sangui.

--- 帖子 #1688 ---
I know because of the questions you ask. To many like you around wanting spoon feeding. Grow up and take some responsibility to learn.

--- 帖子 #1689 ---
euraud, fallen on the field of honor ...

--- 帖子 #1690 ---
I kept checking the thread almost every day to see how it was going and finally decided to start trading it this week...what a bad desition lol. It was painfull to watch the stoplosses being hit on wednesday morning after going to sleep with all orders in good profits and I just manually closed all the remaining ones. Did it perform better later?

I guess we need to add a break even to fire after small wins, we could place the orders again if it goes down to the high of the range or a percentage.

--- 帖子 #1691 ---
How old are you? Have you grown up? I asked a question to the EA developer, and the EA developer happily answered my question to me.  It's none of your business. Does that make you angry? What a dirty mind inside you! Your language was like an uncivilized person. Please go away quietly and I will never reply to you again.

--- 帖子 #1692 ---
For me, only the euraud has been stopped now with - € 27.47 for 0.01 lot.

And at the moment the others are now posting a total latent gain of + € 6.

The remaining peers are:

eurusd, gbpusd, usdchf, eurchf, audjpy, audusd, eurgbp, cadjpy, gbpjpy, nzdjpy, nzdusd, usdcad, eurjpy

--- 帖子 #1693 ---
TOO, not TO.

--- 帖子 #1694 ---
No. I place buy/sell stop order after Tues. close.

--- 帖子 #1695 ---
Lol. We're on the same boat Sangui. The week I decided to execute after my analysis phase is the week the market suddenly becomes indecisive.

But it's alright. It's a sequence of up weeks and down weeks, it just so happened we started on the down week. Proper money management should allow us to last through this.  Also I trust my analysis. I'll keep doing this until June and reevaluate.

Unfortunately it hasn't gone better later. I kept my trades and did not close. 5 pairs has hit SL, 1 BE. I don't plan on re-entering on them this week.

Just sticking to the plan. I still have 11 open trades and 26 Orders. so either no trade, 2R TP, 1R SL, BE, or closed at end of London Friday.

USDCAD SELL seems to be the only trade doing well.

--- 帖子 #1696 ---
I'm not going anywhere, pal. Just read the thread, learn, and you won't have to ask obvious questions.

--- 帖子 #1697 ---
Why is it ALWAYS the case that as soon as a new trader or someone new to a thread asks a question that may be obvious to others get shot down? Some keyboard warrior with a Warren Buffett complex HAS to show superiority and denigrate that person? If you are able to help or let it go.... Easy. No wonder so may new traders lose their money

--- 帖子 #1698 ---
Yeah, I know it was bad luck and it's just variance but well...It will help to make the system better. I'm thinking in having 3 orders, 1 with a very tight TP and when is hit move the others to BE, if the second TP is hit then move the 3rd SL to 1st TP. The best side of this is that if it goes bad then I can lose faster and go to sleep sooner

I was away for a good part of the day and the wallet then painfully displayed € 6 of latent gain but with euraud stopped at - € 27.47. I come back, I open the pc and ... + 92 € on the remaining peers! Wow, what a reversal!

eurgbp almost came to a halt near a pip. (55% stoploss)

Wisdom would say to cut everything now but being in the observation phase, I will leave the positions open until tomorrow evening.

And now we are only at + € 79.

With the exception of gbpjpy and cadjpy, all losing peers are jpy.

Now, only 61 € gain at 21 h 50 GMT

--- 帖子 #1702 ---
Update......I still have 3 open trades. All in the GREEN. AU, NU, EU. Between the 3 open trades i'm at +1.10%. Closed trade for the week i'm at -.43%. I could close right now and just take my profit (see profit take profit)......but since it's a demo and i'm still forward testing, I'll leave them open until a couple hours before market close on Friday.

I just have a superior ability to read. Hahaha

Instead of being Warren Buffett, I suggest that kind of person should go to see a doctor because he is probably a split personality patient. Wow, please forgive me if that person is not. Hahaha.

--- 帖子 #1705 ---
But then I guess you will only be trading a handful of pairs using this system then, because you'd effectively be managing 3x per pair. (which is a lot of work for me)

This actually got me thinking. One of the reasons I like this system is that there is a sort of built in diversification.
1st you have long and short pairs ready in case the market goes either way, 2nd you can trade a number of pairs and don't really have to worry about currency correlation (At least I don't, since I trade all 28 in both direction). 3rd, you have a high probability of good solid movement in one direction during Wed, Thur, and Fri. I think it was Erebus that pointed out that you can trade just about anything that moves with this system.

What I mean is, I look at it from a probability perspective across a "bucket" of trades, rather than relying on just a few good ones. Meaning of all these 20+ "strong" pairs I currently have opened, I am betting on the probability that at least 40% will hit TP. So for 20 pairs, 40% win-rate, assuming 2:1 Reward-to-Risk Ratio and $10 Risk. This is how it would look like:

WIN 20 * 40% * $10 * 2 = $160
LOSE 20 * 60% * $10 * 1 = $120

I would still be up by $40 even if 60% of my trades hit SL.
Not the most lucrative win, but If this holds true overtime, this can compound.

Anyway. status update as of 6:36AM GMT : 5SL, 1BE, 1TP (USDCAD)
EURUSD trade is about to reach 1R. I will move it to BE when it does.

--- 帖子 #1706 ---
Neutral week for me with default settings and PaulDV's EA

5 loss 8 wins

I'm going on to test next week with only 10 pairs

--- 帖子 #1707 ---
Ohh no, I don't plan to do this manually, I have almost everything coded.

--- 帖子 #1708 ---
you should take some time over the weekend (im assuming you have no where to go) and do some visual backtesting on a bunch of pairs. I did so for 12 pairs i think it was. I looked at every trade every week for all of them for the past year. I can tell you from my research that you will not get 40% of your trades to reach 2:1. I obviously could be wrong but I think your goal is a little bit too optimistic. I hope for your sake that i'm wrong. GL!

--- 帖子 #1709 ---
It's so rough in this week.

Stop loss from EA Gcad Acad brings about bad result in Thursday.

anyway, I got gain from EU GU Gchf Ucad Ujpy Uchf GJ.

So, little gain from this week = 9%

--- 帖子 #1710 ---
I wasn't paying too much attention to the EA conversation so not familiar with the parameters.

How did you reach TP on your US pairs? Are you not using 50% MT Range SL and at least High + 15% Entry?

Edit: Double checked the charts and my guess is there is a 50 or 100pip trailing SL in place. So stopped out on the retrace. Interesting.

--- 帖子 #1711 ---
What killed your profit was money management: i.e. you used the same position sizing for all pairs regardless of the stop size.

e.g. EURAUD had a stop loss of 431 pips (probably would have been better to skip that one), and assuming your account is around €250, that means that at a lot size of 0.04, you're risking 38% of your account, on just the one trade!

Whereas on USDCAD, the stop loss was only 145 pips, so the lot size of 0.04 equates to roughly 15% of your account...still big, but better than the EURAUD trade.

So, USDCAD hit TP resulting in €36.94 profit, whereas EURAUD hit SL, resulting in a massive €103.77 loss...a net result of -€67. If you'd set EURAUD to 0.01 to match the pip sizing for USDCAD, your net result would have been around zero across those two pairs.

If you had used the money management feature and set a risk size of 10% and the "Trade if less than minimum" to "false", the EA would have skipped the EURAUD trade, but entered the USDCAD trade at 0.02 pips, which would have resulted in roughly a €25 profit instead of a €67 loss.

The lesson being: money management is key. It's no good setting fixed lot sizes and then hoping for the best...you WILL lose over time.

If you're not going to use the money management feature in the EA, then you really ought to decide on a maximum amount you are willing to risk on each trade, and then calculate the appropriate position sizing yourself on Tuesday evening/Wednesday morning, and enter the fixed lot sizes into each EA. I recommend using the position sizing calculator at myfxbook: https://www.myfxbook.com/forex-calcu.../position-size

That said, it's difficult to do this on such a small account size - you really need to have a minimum of around $1000 in order to make good use of money management.

--- 帖子 #1712 ---
You are right PaulDV.

What settings do you suggest about MM ?

--- 帖子 #1713 ---
Basic setup 15%, 50% sl 100% TP  Lots 0.01

All orders for 26 pairs closed prematurely, not sure why, for a total loss of -£26

That may not be to bad in the greater scheme of things.  Last week was >+£180 ish.

--- 帖子 #1714 ---
I am using the defaults, which is 1% of account balance per trade.  But for that, you need a larger account size - over $1000 preferably.

If you have a smaller account size, and are willing to take the risk, then simply increase the risk% based on your account size vs $1000 - e.g. for $250, use 4%, for $500 use 2%, etc.

You will miss out on some trades due to the stop loss being too large, but then that may not be a bad thing...

--- 帖子 #1715 ---
How do I share my Trade Explorer? I am up almost 11% however did make a couple of mistakes that played in my favour. Forgot to set SL's, Booked 1 pair twice and started too large and had to close them at a profit as I ran out of Capital

First I thank 4recstasy and Erebus for sharing their information with us. I tested this method for the first week, 15% entry , 50% stop loss (like Erebus`s Fibo level-post 1004 ) and announced the results.

Demo account:

gbpchf +201 pip closed on near 2:1 level

gbpjpy +265 pip closed 15:55 gmt manually

gbpusd +438 pip closed on 1:1 level

gbpcad -320 pip (stopped)

gbpaud not triggered

TOTAL: +584

have a good weekend without any fu.. covid19

Hello T4Trade,

Just put this indicator on the graph in addition to the EA and you can also display the period separator, it allows you to properly visualize the days considered.

For backtests, do the same on the graph.

Here's what it looks like:

--- 帖子 #1723 ---
Yeah right

--- 帖子 #1724 ---
Alright. Here we go. Closed at 5pm GMT.

My results for the week for this system:

18 trades triggered all in all:
2 Closed at -2R <-- This should have just been -1R but my balance was too low so had to increase the volume to trade.
4 Closed at -1R
6 Closed at least on +1R but < 2R
6 Closed between +0.9R and -0.9R

Total Profit/Loss for this System is -4.27% of my balance this week.

In hindsight, If I just avoided the trades where my 1% risk was too low, I might have been break even.

Or, maybe better yet, If I had risked 2% on all of these, maybe I would have been up a bit instead. Will consider that next week.

As far as down week goes, not bad. Looking forward to next Wednesday.

--- 帖子 #1725 ---
it looked bad and finally it will have been a good week.

It's Time to see results of this week. I was get some stoploses, but anyway week ended with profit and it's nice

Have a nice weekend!

Hi Transmat

Can I ask you a few questions about this EA

Question 1, Did you let every one of them run to the very end,

question 2 Is the stop loss the same on every trade,

question 3 Are you only running this on the four-hour chart,

Is this an indicator and have you got to add an EA with it,

if the answer is yes which EA,

I'm sorry I'm asking you these questions,

But my mind been on other things with this bloody virus,

Is it possible for you to show a picture of the settings of the EA ,

So we can see if there are any differences in our settings,

thank you for your time

Keep safe God be with you,

--- 帖子 #1730 ---
Hi redfan,

Question 1 == yes, only two were stopped and two others reached their TP; the balance was closed at 5:00 p.m. GMT.

Question 2 == yes stoploss at 55% of the range for all.

Question 3 == The time unit of the graph does not matter, the results will be the same from M1 to the Daily.

The indicator that I put on the graph is only there for a question of visual comfort.

The orders are passed by the EA and the one I use is the one published on post 1671 of March 25th.

The initial parameters were those you can see on the screenshot below; the TP required was just over RR 2: 1.

luck has it worked pretty well this week but nothing says it will be the same in the future, with the same settings ...

Rest assured, you are not the only one to be disturbed by this virus and I myself have to go to the hospital on Tuesday with the risk of coming back with this coronavirus with me.

Thank you for your good thoughts.

what was your biggest downdraw % this week?

--- 帖子 #1733 ---
Guys take a look at my thread, ive used your monday tuesday method and fib to make my trading better. I aint put rules in there properly yet but hopefully you may understand.

Erebus understands as he messaged me saying my method is close to this. I used his fib on monday tuesday range and gave me clarification on real direction for the week.

When you put the fib on monday tuesday range. ( high to low ) if its been dropping slowly and pulls back , it will likely hit the 50% level and then drop. Good trade

or if its ranging and you see no lows or high taken out, going above, below 50% level - shit trade dont trade it or cancel order

orrr if a big drop monday and its struggling to get to 50% level tuesday then you know its a huge trending week - amazing trade.

Opposite to buy what i said above. Hope it helps . I know this from h4 chart only

HI 0xff,

Which EA do you use?

Thank you

so -13.4% TY sir. If everyone keeps good stats then we can find out how many pairs we can trade to keep our DD% manageable. So for example, you're trading 28 pairs and you have a -13.4% dd. Let's just say for the sake of keeping things simple. -13.4% is your "average" dd for 28 pairs over 6 months or so. Then you can start narrowing down your pairs and cutting back on your average dd%. Eventually find something that works for you. With small live accounts I would be ok with 10% dd for the week. With a big account this would be waaaay too much. So if you plan on trading this strategy for a long time and make lots of money with it, you might want to work on that -13.4% dd.  I wouldn't want to be in a -13% dd if i had 50-100K in my account.   Thanks for the stats and the reply. GL next week!

Hello i dont know why my post doesnt show at all.. before each post appears: "Your post is being reviewed.

This post is not yet visible to others. As a Junior Member your posts are hand-moderated as a quality control measure. If approved, this post will be made visible to others and this message will not appear. If this post is denied it will be removed completely."

In my personal opinion, this system works best when the market is volatile, looking at page 1 we immediately see that the creator of this topic has chosen GBP pairs.

hi paulDV,

i was running your EA this week for 30pairs (incl AUDSGD and USDSGD) on a M30 (not that it matters) with good results, with suggested settings.

week2 with profit on a demo.

next week i will start with "percentage risk" got the message now

but I found again few pairs with 2trades like EURNZD:

--- 帖子 #1742 ---
Can you tell me which version you were running?  I know this was a bug that I fixed in V1.03, but there may yet be an issue, so I'll take another look.

M30 is good if you are using the trailing stop, otherwise, it shouldn't matter.

MoTuBo_EA Version 1.041

Changes:Fixed divide by zero error in Break Even routine. Fixed the "UseMinimumLots=false" function (it was being ignored and always used minimum lots). Corrected the calculation for the end of the Monday-Tuesday range period. Amended the entry trigger to use Bid price for long entries (this should reduce entries triggering due to widening spreads). Fixed the MA Trailing Stop from triggering simply when the Stop Loss was in profit (meaning you can now use Break Even and MA Trailing Stop together). Corrected the TP details displayed in the information panel. Information panel is now left displayed at the end of a testing session. A number of small efficiency improvements. NB: you should use this version in preference to all previous versions.

NBB: there have been no changes in settings - all defaults are as they were.

I've been getting quite a few PMs asking how to do things, and what various settings mean, so I thought I'd answer most of them here.

Money Management

This governs how lot sizes for trades are calculated, and there are three methods:
Attached Image

You select which method you want to use and then set the associated setting(s) (Fixed lots, Lots per 100 of balance or Risk percentage.

For Risk Percentage, you can choose what value to use as the basis of the percentage calculation:
Attached Image

Lots Size Maximum and Minimum
Attached Image

If you set a maximum lot size, and the calculation comes to more, the lot size will be capped at the value you set.

If you set a minimum lot size, and the calculation comes to less, the lot size will be increased to the value you set.

HOWEVER: if "Trade if less than minimum?" is set to false, and the cacluated lot size is lower than the minimum set, the EA will NOT enter the trade, as it is deemed too risky.

Break Even
Attached Image

There are three settings:No break even: basically, don't use the break even. Pips profit: moves stop to break even (i.e. the entry price) when the price is in profit by the specified number of pips. Factor of Stop Loss: moves the stop to break even when the price is in profit by a factor of the Stop Loss. e.g. If the stop loss is 150 pips and the factor is set to 0.5, when the price gets to 75 pips in proft (150 x 0.5), the stop loss will be moved to break even. Break Even Pips is the number of pips to use for method 1.

Pips to lock in on break even: when moving the stop to break even, you can specify a number of pips of profit to lock in.

Trailing Stop
Attached Image

There are four settings:No trailing stop. Regular trailing stop: triggered when the price is in profit by the Regular trailing stop start, and is moved in steps set in the Regular trailing stop step setting. Follow MA: the trailing stop is triggered when the price is in profit by the factor of the stop loss specified (e.g. if the stop loss is 150 pips and the factor is set to 0.75, the trailing stop is triggered when the price reaches 112 pips (150 x 0.75). The stop is then trailed along the line of a moving average with the period specified. Previous high/low: the trailing stop is moved when the previous three candles form a new low or high.

As ever, let me know if you find anything untoward.

version 1.03 works for me! new version doesnt!

Can you explain what you mean when you say it doesn't work?

--- 帖子 #1748 ---
i run them. but new version does not show any information

--- 帖子 #1749 ---
Awesome work, @PaulDV!

I have one comment/question regarding the bid/ask price amendment: To my understanding, the BUY and SELL orders simply should always use the BID price for triggering the trade to prevent that spread widening triggers the stoploss for sell orders or the long entries. Reason is that only the ASK price widens in low volatility times.

Do you agree and is it programmed in this way?

--- 帖子 #1750 ---
i also agree with your method,because a weekly candle gives 3-4 trades per week,so if mon tues is plotted,we can wait on wednesday or thursday to take the trade and if PA doesnt break Hi or Lo and it is ranging,then we can apply the fib rule to take the trade from 50%-78% to join the trend,weekly pivots can be very beneficial for more confirmation.

--- 帖子 #1751 ---
Please don't clutter this thread with ideas that have nothing to do with this system. We are not considering traditional fibs or any pivots. Thank you.

Hi transmat

I have a question or a puzzle,

first of all, Are you still going off the high and low of Monday Tuesday,

waiting for the break on Wednesday, this

If so see pictures, I put a BLUE line on the high and low on Monday and Tuesday,

when I place your indicator on top of the chart the box is bigger than the high and low of Monday Tuesday.

I don't this on 10 charts and only one of them was the box correct,

can you have a look into this and tell me whether it's correct or whether it is wrong,

Blue lines represent high and low Monday Tuesday

thank you

Thanks.

The previous version was using Ask for length entries and Bid for short entries.  I have switched them fir this version.

For long, I use the Bid price so that widening spreads (usually the Ask price( doesn't trigger an entry too early.

For short, I use the Ask price for the same reason.

These only affect the entry. Once a trade is open, normal rules apply regarding the hitting of the stop loss.

--- 帖子 #1754 ---
Ok, I understand your reasons. For longs you are correct, but short trades will not trigger earlier when spreads are widening (actually they would trigger later if using the ask price). For shorts the bid price will not change. The only things can happen are:

1. "Normal Entry" short trade by bid price --> the ask price will be closer to the SL than without spread widening, but that's no problem

2. "Your EA version" short trade by ask price --> entry is much lower as it normally would (because ask price is at entry level and bid price way below)

So I would suggest to use the bid price for short entries and bid price for longs, too.

--- 帖子 #1755 ---
Brilliant!

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #1756 ---
Hi redfan,

I watched this and actually the indicator overflows on the last candle when you are in H4 or Daily, so when there is a higher or a lower on this one, it changes the graphic levels.

Go to H1 if you want the display to be correct.

But that does not affect the independent EA at all.

Your blue lines are correct.

Have a nice Sunday.

--- 帖子 #1757 ---
I believe PaulDV already mentioned this issue had been resolved in V1.04.

--- 帖子 #1758 ---
On reflection, I think you're right - I'll make the change and issue a quick update shortly.

EDIT: I've updated the version to 1.041 for this change (https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...9#post12843499).

--- 帖子 #1759 ---
Hmm, bit odd.

I've put the new version on a number of clean charts and all have displayed the info panel.  I'm thinking that this may be a broker-specific issue, and is restricted to the weekend (i.e. the market being closed).

The info panel relies on ticks being received from the broker, so if your broker does not respond to anything when the market is closed then you won't get the info panel displayed.  My guess is that come Sunday evening, the info panel will show up.

--- 帖子 #1760 ---
Hi pantera1,

We are not talking about the same thing.

On the one hand, there are the EA including that of PaulDV and this indicator: MoTuBo_Indi.mq4

redfan therefore spoke of the indicator which remained as it was.

But it is secondary because the orders are passed by an EA whatever it is.

--- 帖子 #1761 ---
I corrected the indicator "Mo TuBo_Indi" so that the display corresponds well to the highest and lowest of Monday and Tuesday from M5 to Daily; there was just 1 tiny second to remove ...

Small cause, big effects ...

There she is  :

--- 帖子 #1762 ---
thanks for your guidence.

--- 帖子 #1763 ---
I forgot to say that if the info panel doesn't appear when the market opens, let me know and I'll have a rethink.

--- 帖子 #1764 ---
I also corrected the indicator "TuBo_OnDay_Indicator" so that it does not overflow on the day of Wednesday.

I remind you that it takes as a reference only Tuesday for the highest and lowest; it could be used if for example there was too high volatility on Monday with extremes too far apart. But to test before by prudence ... it is not in conformity with the subject of the thread here.

--- 帖子 #1765 ---
Great, thank you. I just saw that there is a "max. spread" function...wouldn't this also prevent entering trades when spreads are widening?

And would a trade be opened afterwards when spread is normal again even though the price is above/below the entry limit?

--- 帖子 #1766 ---
Yes.

No.

--- 帖子 #1767 ---
Hi,

Is this script works only on the first Wednesday's H1 bar, what if I'm late can I use it after?

MoTuBO_EA Version 1.05

Changes:Added a time filter - trades will only open between these times. The information panel is now displayed immediately on startup. Corrected the routine that calculates the number of trades opened this week. Added a background to the information panel to make things clearer. Added options to display guide lines or not. Added options to display the weekly entry range box, or not. Amended guide lines to show price levels. Most of the new stuff is cosmetic, and allows you to dispense with using the MoTuBo_Indi (if you use it, that is).

The main feature is the addition of a time filter:
Attached Image

You can now specify the window in which trades will be opened, by specifying the from day and hour (defaults to Wednesday, 00:00) and the to day and hour (defaults to Friday, 22:00).

Here's the full screenshot with all info panels displayed:

Happy trading!

--- 帖子 #1773 ---
Hi redfan,

No it's not good. The indicator must in no case take into account the last candle on Friday in H4. I checked on my platform and for me it started well Monday at 0am.

You seem to have a timing problem with the indicator; watch this because you will not have the right information.

--- 帖子 #1774 ---
I'm not use EA, just only script (in attach) for send pending orders.

In attached script this features realized. Early version didn't have settings to be change when execute. Now I add lots and TP(if 0 - no TP). In source code you can find some examples.

If you late and not execute script at first hour of wednesday(by broker's time) you also can use script, but for range calculation will be use 48 1 hours bars to the left by current.

Yes. In TE you can change period for statistics. See attach image.

Hi Paul,

Thanks for update,panel shows error 4024, what does it mean?

TIA

--- 帖子 #1776 ---
Latest version is loading up perfect, but that's just me. I did have a question though...

I have the latest and greatest MoTuBO_EA Version 1.05 loaded up on my OANDA Demo account, which has a broker offset of +3 GMT.

I've noticed that the box drawn by the EA starts at 00:00 and the info panel shows a broker offset of 0.

Is the broker offset automatically calculated? If not, is there a way to manually override this and enter an offset to make sure the box is drawn according to the GMT start of the day instead of the broker start of the day?

Thanks my friends.

--- 帖子 #1777 ---
That means “no object name”, and is probably occurring in the building of the info panel.  I’ll hunt it down and release a fix shortly, but it shouldn’t affect the running of the EA.

--- 帖子 #1778 ---
That’s an internal variable left over from the code from another EA, and shouldn’t be there...please ignore it.

All of the times in the parameters are specified in broker times.

Hey Stumpy, I greatly appreciate all the efforts PaulDV and others have put into developing these ea's they do a good job.

Try this if you're using Windows 10. I use a 4K display and it worked for me.

Right click on your MT4's .exe file or the shortcut on your desktop. Next, right click on Properties then the Compatibility tab. Click on Change high DPI settings then at the lower part of the box you'll see High DPI scaling override. Check the box beside Override high DPI scaling behavior. and slide the pull down menu to System (enhanced). Click OK and OK to get out.

Is there anyway to open pending orders on all pairs by execute motu_script once,

Use an EA for that

If you read the manual, you would know what a Script does

I don't think there is any Ea here that trades either from market watch currency list or selected pairs without attaching them to individual charts.

If there is any, pointing it out will be appreciated,

--- 帖子 #1789 ---
The strategy is so simple that, if you're happy using the spreadsheet and entering trades manually, then there's very little past the first couple of posts in this thread worth reading.

Erebus did an excellent job at pointing out how we can use the Fibonacci tool in place of the spreadsheet, but again, if you're happy with the spreadsheet, then that's probably a step too far for you as well.

There's no obsession with EAs (at least on my part), but seeing as the strategy is so simple, and the trading week is reduced to just Wednesday/Thursday/Friday (or less for some), then what else is there to say in this thread?  I'm a coder by trade, so for me this is a perfect excuse to build something FOR ME, to help ME (because I'm lazy), but I offer it here for others to use if they want.  I suspect that the same goes for most of the others here who are coding their own EAs and scripts - it's all to make a tiresome task less tiresome while having some fun in the process.

But, I'm happy to join in with whatever other conversation you'd rather be having...

--- 帖子 #1790 ---
It's possible to do, but there isn't any script in this thread that does it.

Are you using a keyboard and computer to post in here or are you handwritting letters and sending them by mail to FF so they can upload your posts?

If there weren't for robots it would be so easy to trade, but trading is not a human war anymore, it's a robots war. The same happened to online poker, winning at the tables was sooooo easy 10 years ago...but with bots everywhere it's almost imposible now, and the reason is that once they are well programmed they don't make mistakes and have no emotions running 24/7.

So I'm obsessed with them yes, and that's 1 reason, the other is that it's such a great feeling watching a robot do what you programmed it to do

It's about time management and trading efficiency. Try to think outside of your box.

--- 帖子 #1799 ---
Yeah totally agree.

If it works why not use a bot? EA's can open multiple trades way more efficiently and error free than I usually can (ie. it won't miss setting that stoploss, or miss a crucial number, etc).

However from my experience, EA's WILL miss that one possible combination that it can't compensate for (ie. loss of internet for a second, broker manipulation, etc).

So I have a trust/mistrust relationship with bots. I use EA's to initiate the trade(s), double check the trades to confirm, then let them run their course without my greedy/fearful fingers hitting that close trade button, but keeping an eye on progress just in case.

ok for this time

but after my day switched there was no update on the panel. still NO and 0 pips range and other weren't updated.

MoTuBo_EA Version 1.06

First off: apologies to everyone who downloaded and installed 1.05 - I realise that this release is very soon after the previous version, however it is NOT an April Fools...there are one or two bugs which surfaced after release of 1.05 that for technical reasons didn't materialise in the Strategy Tester.

I was already making some minor tweaks, so have included these as part of this emergency bug fix version.

Changes:Fixed a divide by zero error in the trailing stop routine. Added an option to allow the range to be determined using the bodies of the candles instead of the wicks (the default is to use the wicks). Fixed guide length on start of new month! Increased the frequency with which the info panel is updated. A couple of minor efficiency improvement to reduce load on the terminal. New option for range determination:

Thanks

Is there an option to set a number of max trades allowed for the pair?

Sorry if I'm being completely blind but I've checked numerous times

I'm testing another strategy on the same demo account, and because there is already a manual trade open on the required pair, the EA states that no trade is allowed as max trade's for the pair (1) has already been reached.

The manual trades are not using magic numbers, so I'm thinking that the EA just checks to see if there is an open trade for the pair, regardless of its own magic number

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1835 ---
Here is how it looks like on another account after installing the new EA version with range from the candle body only.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1836 ---
There's no external setting - it's hard-coded to 1 within the EA.

It always uses the magic number when going through the trade history.  One possibility is that the start date for the range is being corrupted - this was a bug in an earlier version...which version are you using?

--- 帖子 #1837 ---
That looks correct to me.

When using the body to determine the range, the timeframe becomes a factor, because the close of candles can vary from timeframe to timeframe.

--- 帖子 #1838 ---
I'm sorry to say that quite a lot has now gone wrong since I wrote that.,
Two orders were taken which are now running which is fine,
BUT then the EA started to delete all buy orders,
So I started to manually place the buy order then, I realised as I look back on the orders I had manually placed, the EA had deleted them as well,
So I am left with 14 sell order, and the EA will not allow me to place any pending orders,
So I'm just going to let all this run And then I will evaluate it,
I was manually trading this system when I first started but it takes a long time to place pending orders,
That's why I gave the EA's ago,
I'm of the opinion this system is so simple we don't really need EA's,
we need something that can let us place pending orders in a block that only takes a couple of minutes,
and then it's a waiting game.

Your latest version posted, screenshot showing manual trade's open by me on AJ, the EA thinks it can't place an order,when in theory it should (as there is no other order open on that pair using the magic number defined by the EA)

--- 帖子 #1840 ---
i opened trade manually!

--- 帖子 #1841 ---
Hmmm...

As a test, I have manually submitted an order on GBPCAD, and as you will see below, the EA has completely ignored it:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Can you turn on the debugging option:

This should turn on the debugging messages:

Can you then show me a quick screenshot of the messages you're getting?

Can you also look through your history for all AUDJPY trades for the magic number, and let me know how many there are?

--- 帖子 #1842 ---
I think I know what's happened here

When I replaced the EA with your latest version,my template values were overwritten with the default ones (including the magic number)

In the time it took me to re do my template across the chart's I have loaded the EA on, its taken a trade using your default magic number.

I closed this trade it had taken as I wanted all my magic numbers aligned.

So I changed it to my own magic number, but,it won't take a trade because I believe it recognises that the EA took a trade earlier, even though that initial trade on AJ had a different magic number to the or I've input / amended on my template.

This may be a 'one off' as in the ideal scenario we wouldn't be touching it after Wednesday began. The only reason I did was because of the updated versions issued

I guess the only thing is suggest is to allow repeat trade's if the magic numbers are different.

I'll leave that to your discretion

NZD is the Conor McGregor of currency, somebody just needs to knock that Kiwi out, no reason for NZD to be strong, it’s ruining our system

--- 帖子 #1844 ---
Thanks.

Looking at the messages, you will see it says "Open orders: 9 (this symbol: 1)".

This means that you currently have 9 orders open for this magic number, and one of them is for the current symbol.

The EA ignores any orders with a different magic number. I suggest that you double-check the magic number against those 9 open orders.

To prove this, I've changed the magic number on the EA on one of my charts, and now get the following:
Attached Image

As you will see it says 'Open orders: 0 (this symbol: 0)' but I actually have 12 trades running right now.

I changed it back, and you will see it's updated again:

Update as of 2PM GMT.

16 pairs with orders:AUDCAD AUDCHF AUDNZD AUDUSD CADCHF EURAUD EURCAD EURCHF EURGBP EURNZD EURUSD NZDCAD NZDCHF NZDUSD USDCAD USDCHF

Trades open:AUDUSD SELL EURNZD BUY NZDCHF SELL NZDUSD SELL They don't seem to be doing well. Seems like just temporary weakness on NZD and AUD.

News maybe. Probably that thing about 30 South Australians found with Coronavirus.

Edit as of 3PM GMT: All 4 trades above just got destroyed by a sudden rise in AUD and NZD.

Though day!

Holding trades as per rules till Friday. TP2 Target. Move to BE when price reaches TP1.

AUDUSD trade below.  <-- Already closed at SL.

--- 帖子 #1846 ---

Your right. The trade's we're actually only a few points apart hence I couldn't tell easily on the chart

Hi redfan

That is exactly what I produced. Works well snd creates 52 orders (26 buy/sell). It will now run until Friday when I will close all that are left. Thought you had used it. Don't understand what the difficulty is, except people want more.

You haven't enabled the break even function - or am I missing something here?

--- 帖子 #1853 ---
There is that many EA's on here with similar names even the owners are getting mixed up,
they are looking at queries and finding out it not even their EA,
why don't they delete them from the list when there is something wrong with it,
As you know I was following your EA work and the last thing I read was you are not doing anything else,
as for your last EA I thought you were still working on it, if you are saying it's working which pages is it on,

--- 帖子 #1854 ---
I think you have the same magicNumber on all graphs.

When a trade was taken, the EA canceled the pending reverse order and all the orders of the same direction and with an identical magicNumber are passed "to the hatch".

Remember to define a magicNumber difference for each pair.

You can iron them now with a different magicNumber; it should work...

Hi @PaulDV, the latest version of the expert has completely ignored several signals today.

NZD / JPY EUR / JPY CHF / JPY

--- 帖子 #1857 ---
I'm currently in all of those trades.

NZDJPY entered at 09:34 GMT and has been bouncing aroun entry all day.

EURJPY entered at 10:24 and has hit TP1 and is now trailing the stop.

CHFJPY entered at 12:17 and is half way to TP1.

--- 帖子 #1858 ---
You have set break even to trigger when 10 pips in profit, and to lock in 5 pips - and it looks like the stop has moved as expected.

You have set trailing stop to follow the previous high/low, but currently price hasn't made a new high for the sto to be moved to.

All looks correct to me.

--- 帖子 #1859 ---
Paul,

Thank you once again for an excellent EA.  I really appreciate all the time and effort you have put in to help the me and the entire team succeed.  It's rare to find generosity in trading Forex.

That goes for the rest of the group who has helped test and give feedback.  Thank you.

--- 帖子 #1860 ---
I wasn't doing anything else and I haven't as I have been ill and also wanted to see what results were like with the fixed settings. It's not good practice to keep changing things until you have a good baseline (2 weeks is not long enough) to measure against.

I'll post the latest one again when I am back at my pc.

--- 帖子 #1861 ---
Sorry but I have to disagree. Not sure what you mean by daily market profile though. The high and lows are absolute values, whether true or not, they are what we see on our screens. The bodies ie Open/Close are only a snapshot for probably a few seconds when the day changes. When trading stocks where a market does open and close and traders go home and think there is real value in these numbers. In a continuous process like Forex they are purely transient. The open and close are imo irrelevant.

This is a breakout strategy and using open/close rather than hi/lo means you could more likely be trading into areas of resistance/support rather than breaking into new ground. Not 100% certain but just reducing probability.

Just my way of looking at it. I have been wrong before.

--- 帖子 #1862 ---
Hi,

Those trades have been activated for me too

--- 帖子 #1863 ---
Yes... same as me and some loss due spike for Aud pairs because i'm using body candle range for  entries...

Thnaks for amazing Ea

Regards

--- 帖子 #1864 ---
Any major open like NY or London could be considered start of the day. Imo London open is probably the most followed open time.

Candle wicks in market profile terms represent excess in the price discovery. The body of the candle is where most trades are executed. In general about 70% of all trades fall in the value area - core of the value area is balance - price will break out of balance and eventually out of value area to search for a new balance (most accepted price).

Does that make a diff for the MoTu system? I don't know - Mentioned this before known energy trader at Intl FC Stone uses the Mon/Tue value area to allocate his trades.

.

--- 帖子 #1865 ---
Yes I guess London Open NY close would cover the serious activity. Only testing will tell. I did learn a long time ago there is no right or wrong way if it works for [you].  Good luck, stay safe.

--- 帖子 #1866 ---
I was really curious how this week was going to play out with this strategy.....with it being NFP week and all. Typically on NFP week it feels like there isn't much movement leading up to NFP Friday. It feels like they are always slower than your average week. For a while now it also doesn't feel as if NFP has the same effect on the market as it used to. I'm curious to see how this week's NFP plays out. You would think with all thats going on and unemployment being as bad as it is, it would be a pretty volatile NFP......I'm just feeling it. We'll see.

--- 帖子 #1867 ---
Hi guys, as you know, I'm collecting trades statistics. And after 8 weeks I want say - use only majors pairs.

I did recive PM from Romiros for ask me create myfxbook account for detail analyze past orders. And what we see - it's toppingly if trade only major pairs.

You can also join to analize it, but remember, 1 trade was mistaken - 1 order was 1 lot, not 0.01 (i wrote about it here). You can exclude it in myfxbook custom analizer.

--- 帖子 #1868 ---
GBPAUD Closed at stop loss 50% if it was 55% would be still in trade.

--- 帖子 #1869 ---
Out of the many hours I've spent visually backtesting each pair. I've come to the conclusion that I'm only going to trade the USD and GBP pairs.....thats it. And if I had to really narrow things down I would stick to EURUSD and GBPUSD.

--- 帖子 #1870 ---
I mentioned the 55% SL before. If the range between Monday and Tuesday happen to make the swing high and swing low and we throw a fib on it, of course there is a chance that price returns to the 50 fib, which in our case is our SL. So why not just extend our SL just a little bit to either 55% or even 60% if you want to play it a little more safe. You can either also extend your TP a little bit to maintain your 1:1 ratio, or just take it as is and settle for a little bit less than 1:1.

--- 帖子 #1871 ---
By major you mean USD cross?

AUDUSD, EURUSD, GBPUSD, NZDUSD, USDCAD, USDCHF, USDJPY

or some other definition of majors

thanks

--- 帖子 #1872 ---
Yes couples with Usd.

--- 帖子 #1873 ---
Hi Paul. I have noticed that in Strategy Tester V1.061 only shows a single trade in back-testing. The settings used are default, and this happens with all majors. Are you experiencing a similar?

--- 帖子 #1874 ---
Exactly

--- 帖子 #1876 ---
Not looking to good at the moment.

To be honest, all of my testing has been limited to scenarios within the last week or two, so there may be something awry when running it over historic data.

I'll look into it.

Hi PaulDV, Thanks for your efforts and sharing the EA's . Is it possible to set EA's to trade more than one during a week? because sometimes the trades hit the SL and again come back to profit.

--- 帖子 #1881 ---
Using the script, I tried to tweak the SL and lot size , but all efforts failed. After all attempts and clicking Ok, the script revert to the former settings. What is the solution, please

--- 帖子 #1882 ---
You can allow more headroom in your SL using the settings

--- 帖子 #1883 ---
Oil can also be a road to explore ...

--- 帖子 #1884 ---
Hi, and thank you for supplying screen shots - they were most helpful!

Yes, as the error message says, it didn't open the order because the lot size was too small. You are using money management (i.e. the EA will automatically calculate the lot size for the order based on your account balance) and have selected to risk 1% of your account balance per trade. The EA has calculated the lot size based on this and the size of the stop loss, and determined that the lot size is probably less than 0.01 lots. You have set a minimum lot size of 0.01 lots, so the EA will attempt to use this value. You have also set the option "Trade if less than minimum" to false, so this stops the EA from entering the trade, because the risk is too great. You have a couple of ways around this:Change the "Trade is less than minimum" to true: how ever you could end up risking more than you intended. Used fixed lots, and set the lot size yourself. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #1885 ---
Currently, no, but the coding is there to support it, so it could be enabled.

The issue with doing this though is the rules that need to be put into place...Do you allow a second trade while the first is still open? Do you allow a second trade if the first lost? Do you allow a second trade if the first won? If you allow a second trade, do you want to limit it to the same direction or the opposite direction of the first, or no limits at all? How about a third, or fourth trade?... Basically, it gets to being a bit of a minefield rather quickly, and is more likely to be easier to open new trades manually, on those few occasions that you want to use this feature.

If there's a demand for it, and I can get a good idea of how it should work (without being too complicated!) then I may build it in.

--- 帖子 #1886 ---
After I load the EA on 1 chart, subsequent charts I load the EA on show this the notice "Restored 1 trade groups.."

Is this an issue?

--- 帖子 #1887 ---
Who are you addressing this to?  There are several EAs available in this thread...which EA?

--- 帖子 #1888 ---
I think it's better to open the second trade in any direction just when the first one has hit the SL.

--- 帖子 #1889 ---
My bad. I was referring to WTF Trading EA...

Hi to all the EA gurus.

I dont really understand them as I am an old fart LOL. Question at the start we are told that positions not opened by the close of the weekend should be cancelled and the open trades let run. Is this what the eas you are using do ????

--- 帖子 #1893 ---
Hi Stumpy,

My EA (MoTuBo_EA) uses market orders, so you won't have any pending orders to cancel.  Whether or not you leave open orders over the weekend is up to you.

--- 帖子 #1894 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #1895 ---
Ahh now I am starting to understand so the EA trades at market when the conditions for the order fulfill. The disadvantage of this is that you cannot review the orders and you will have to have tested the EA to ensure you can trust it. What is the advantage of this?

What is ridiculous is complaining about posts in a thread where practically everything that needs to be said about the strategy has already been said.

If you learn how to use the forum features properly, you won't have to hear from anyone about EAs ever again.

--- 帖子 #1907 ---
Jumping from one thread to another is not the solution. This thread is good, yes, some had negative results while some got positive results.

We can do better if we can take time go through the last few pages of the thread, take note and weed out what is bad and keep what is good.

The system is simple and profitable, but we must use our God's given brain to find the real gold in this system.

Do you know that in the last six weeks or so, some currency pairs had remained consistent with positive results, if that's is the case, why waste time trading all pairs. You got work to do and you will be happy you did

All I need is just a script that is easily editable to suit my SL and Lot sizes, the script by one of us here is great, but editing is where the challenge lies

I lost money last week and I did so deep analysis, placed just few trade's and only two pairs were triggered and I closed them in small profit.

If we go only by the rules of this strategy, you are right this week was an absolutely neutral week. However EURGBP was a win based on the rules.

--- 帖子 #1924 ---
The issue this week was, what I would call the market manipulation of the AUD and the NZD in the middle of the week. I think it was centered on the AUD but the NZD has a close correlation so was affected as well. I do not know where to report this to launch an investigation, but I am going to. Using Spikehunter’s back testing EA I can tell it would be better to restrict the strategy to the top 15 performing pairs. I want to do further analysis on range size: Hypothesis to test: in a week where range size is abnormal risk of loss increases. Will be back with the result later today. Ps If I Did not restrict oil to 50% TP then things would have looked better.

Hi All

So herewith the top 15 pairs to trade based on Spikehunter's EA and statistics. I am going to disqualify GBPAUD based on what happened last week.

In order of performance 1st being best: GBPCAD, GBPUSD, EURNZD, GBPJPY, EURUSD, GBPCHF, CADJPY, CHFJPY, GBPAUD, USDJPY, EURJPY, EURGBP, EURCAD, USDCHF and NZDJPY. SpikeHunter's EA assumed to close at end of the week rather than at TP levels. This may therefore over report on the gains in pips compared to if you had TP's set. The data also does not include the results of the last 2 weeks. (MonTues System.xlsx)

I also include my calculator MonTue System 20200325 that provides an estimate of the lot size of a full lot you should trade given your risk appetite.

Mind you, the market closes between nine and 10 o'clock tomorrow night.
You may have missed it this week.
Because you are going to have to close your orders manually because the EA closes them on Friday,

which is a bank holiday, So it will not be able to close them,
if I was you I'd leave it this week and get ready for next week

AUDCAD hit TP1 and is now trailing the stop very nicely...

--- 帖子 #1967 ---
I don't use your EA but I am curious what kind of tail do you use? Are you using pips or %? What kind of trail and step?

--- 帖子 #1968 ---
The EA supports a number of different trailing stop methods, but I’m using EMA (the green line in the image in my post).

--- 帖子 #1969 ---
hey PaulDV

re: the trailing stop, for your EMA trailing stop can I ask what you are using for it (it's the Follow MA option i think) - for the trailing stop start, the trailing stop step, the MA trailing stop period and the MA trailing stop trigger?

thanks, blam

and

--- 帖子 #1970 ---
Period 13, trigger is 1xSL (so TS triggers when price reaches 1:1 profit).

Start and Step are for the Regular TS method.

I close my trade manually today since the spread getting bigger because of the bank holiday. Trade safe everyone.

Almost picture perfect PRICE movement on AUDCAD to demonstrate this method

1. Monday Low

2. Tuesday High

3. Wednesday pullback to 50%

4. Takes the breakout entry with momentum candles

5. Breaks out at last week's high (as a reference only)

6. Missed the 2 to 1 Take Profit by 1 pip, so not perfect

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

PS: experimenting with entry at 10% of range and stop loss at 40% - why? I figure trades that go the right way, they don't retrace, so need to have the target closer, risk is same anyway, someone can backtest if they like

--- 帖子 #1975 ---
Hi Erebus,

Pardon me for asking this question, may I know how do you get the Fibo setting in your picture?

Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #1976 ---
Fantastic

--- 帖子 #1977 ---
10% Entry, 40% SL. Interesting settings. Higher possibility of hitting 2R, but also slightly aggressive entry (5%), and increases the risk  of SL by about 20%.

Similar to that IB momentum breakout strategy in babypips.

Please keep us posted on results.

--- 帖子 #1978 ---
it's always a delicate balance between entry, stop loss and take profit of course

It's my observation that this method gets the direction "correct" most of the time, last week was horrendous

getting the direction right and even getting to 1 to 1 and therefore move to breakeven is at least protecting the account

and also my observation that breaking out in the "correct" direction, often there is no retracement, perhaps due to the nature of breakouts

anyway, it's what I'm thinking and trialling for now, have a great long weekend all, Netflix for me

--- 帖子 #1979 ---
yes it's done really well this week, which is my second week of testing. Funny thing is, it actually made a small (compared to what I've seen other weekly pip hauls for this system)  profit for me last week as well. So a very good start for my testing

--- 帖子 #1980 ---
I will try do a backtest with 10% and 15% entry this weekend if i'm free. Sounds interesting. Thanks for the idea bro. Have a good weekend everyone.

Another nice week. Not able to close Gold position due market is closed for Spot metals, with current Gold price the total profit is around 500 pips.

--- 帖子 #1988 ---
Results for the week:

14 trades triggered.

Closed pending orders at Friday London noon.

Closed all trades at Friday London close.

Up 5.63% from last week ending balance.

Setup this week: 15% Entry, 50% SL, Move to BE when TP1 hit.

Next week, I will probably try 10% Entry 40% SL.

Been playing with the Fib tool and comparing possible results this week.

It seems risk size will be reduced from 65% to 50% of Mon Tue candles. Some trades would have definitely yielded higher results, but also at least 1SL would have been hit. Let's see.

--- 帖子 #1989 ---
My result this week,

14 trade triggered.

Closed at Friday London noon.

Gain = 10 pairs

Loss = 4 pairs

Up 7.8% from last week balance.

My setup by manually, 20% entry, 50%sl and 100% tp

R:R = 70:80

A good result in this week.

--- 帖子 #1990 ---
Can you please post your statement or explain your lot/balance risk, you only said (Up 7.8% from last week balance....)  but you could use 00.1 or 1.00 lot, how much money on acc, how many trades, lot size etc????

This week I finished with 1% profit, I was 7% up but I lost oil, 6%. I earned 9% on another strategy with high risk, I used this account by mistake to trade scalping this week, in total 22.33% in two weeks.

--- 帖子 #1993 ---
I trade by my mobile phone.

and lot size = 0.02 for each pair.

My margin level > 400% (when triggered many pairs) is acceptable.

Now, my balance is 1550 usd.

I will change lot size to 0.03 when my balance = 2,100

Back test results don't mean anything at all. The only thing a back test is good for is to test the functionality of an EA or Indicator. Results are meaningless. The only way to know if something is profitable or not is to forward test and keep notes/stats. Forex is a marathon. No way around it. The sooner you accept that the better off you will be.

So that is why my broker's MT4 is set to Moscow. So that their midnight can equal NY 5pm. Understanding does not mean that I like it though.

--- 帖子 #2023 ---
I really dislike it when other people answer my questions that were intended for someone else, so I apoligize for doing the same to you. I'm almost certain that Erebus does NOT trade this strategy on the H4. That post you are referring to was just a piece of advice from him to the person who posted. I believe that Erebus is currently using a 15% entry and 50% SL but he mentioned recently about trying a 10% entry.

hi, the option to close everything to an equity profit level would not be an interesting option? set a weekly goal.

Right now I am doing the test with 16 pairs, a 2% risk in each pair, I have 10 open trades and a profit level of 6%, putting a weekly profit of 10% or 15% would be a good job.

No idea, no my thing

Much easier to use the EA from PaulDV as an indicator

Markets are really scrambled, worse than a few days ago when I said I exit everything

--- 帖子 #2050 ---
Yeah. You called that out well man. One of those weeks where they move well on a Wednesday, then gave almost everything back by Thursday.

I was seeing about a 9% floating positive last Wednesday night. All went back to less than 1% today.

I'm now considering the ff changes to that 10% Entry. (Which i used this week)

* daily close

* close at TP1

* close at TP1.5

I'm trying to keep things mechanical, so my emotions don't come into play.

Will evaluate results this weekend.

thanks for the update. I closed all positions yesterday for a nice profit. Maybe one rule should be to use discretion and close before Friday if there is a nicely profitable basket of trades

I have also a nice profit every week. I use for example Equity Sentry v1.4c and put the target to 5 % profit, then its finish for the week...

--- 帖子 #2056 ---
Thats how I trade this strategy also. I use a 5% TP. I'm still tinkering with the number of pairs and SL%

--- 帖子 #2057 ---
I don't use any SL...

I have all major, minor, gold and so on. It's about how fast you can come to % TP. We don't count pips, only account profit

--- 帖子 #2058 ---
Agreed but we may miss big moves in strong trend sometime.

--- 帖子 #2059 ---
horrible business plan. GL

--- 帖子 #2060 ---
Like this, today

--- 帖子 #2061 ---
You are not alone, I don't use SL

In this trade, do what you believe is best for you and forget gurus that we start screening that you can't trade without SL.

--- 帖子 #2062 ---
How about investment, big bank, Markets Makers. They don't count pips in single assets...

Only make big money on the market

--- 帖子 #2063 ---
I agree. You should trade 28 pairs plus Gold, Dax and what ever else possible to trade. Trade them ALL as a basket with NO SL ...AND......you should probably hold your trades over the weekend. Just incase the Open of the following week pushes all of your trades in TP. Solid plan.

--- 帖子 #2064 ---
If you need a proof... take a look at this week (EURUSD). The Resistance and the Lower have been already defined Tuesday. And the Euro followed it nicely

that's true, we may miss an even bigger move and lose some potential greater profit. But I like the quote 'I'd rather be out of a trade, wishing I was in, than be in a trade, wishing I was out'

blam

--- 帖子 #2067 ---
It was my mistake counting pips, but from now I will count only RR and profit in the %.....SL depends on  the strategy, we should use only the small lots, big accounts and follow the trend, and we do not need SL.

--- 帖子 #2068 ---
I had a four SL this week, If I didn't use SL I would be in better position now. I will insert SL on the opposite side of the trade from the next week. My entry is 125 and SL will be 125 of the opposite side.

--- 帖子 #2069 ---
I thought you said No SL?

--- 帖子 #2070 ---
Is there any tool in mt4 that can be used to setup multiple TP?

That is set and forget TP with human intervention ones is done.

--- 帖子 #2071 ---
Sorry for misunderstanding I did not explain properly. It will not be SL it is change of the trend, long is finished get in short close long and opposite, not a classic SL like now at 50 or 55. I will be in trade as long as it lasts, when it changes direction then close and open an opposite.

--- 帖子 #2072 ---
well said.

--- 帖子 #2073 ---
Late post.

Results for last week. (4/12 to 4/18)

down 2.09%.

The following trades actually went to TP1, did not reach the TP2, and retraced back to ENTRY or SL.

SELL EURCHF

SELL NZDCHF

BUY EURNZD

SELL CADJPY

SELL CADCHF

SELL AUDJPY

SELL NZDCAD

The following trades reached TP2.

SELL NZDJPY

BUY USDCAD

SELL NZDUSD

So I'm thinking. I'd rather have just closed TP1 on all of these (+10R) rather than get a -2R.

Strategy for this week:

1. +10% Entry, -40% SL.

2. Set TP to 3R.

3. At London 5pm on Wed, Thu, and Fri. Close all trades past R1.

--- 帖子 #2074 ---
Erebus. If I recall correctly, your +10% entry is your demo trade.

Given that you closed both real and demo trades at the same time, which had higher percentage win overall? If alright to share.

--- 帖子 #2075 ---
Hi

This system resembles London breakout strategy.

--- 帖子 #2076 ---
Or use trailing stop(s). Something like: when reaching half the way to TP1, set trailing stop to (TP1-Entry)/2. Allow new entry once the trailing stop has been taken.

--- 帖子 #2077 ---
Well spotted.  So do most breakout strategies.

--- 帖子 #2078 ---
I'm told that there are only 2 ways to enter a trade, retracement or breakout

As a programmer, would you agree? I sure can't think of any other

Makes sense that strategies that use the same entry technique would look similar

I guess you could use London Breakout for signal, then wait for pullback to enter, then it wouldn't look the same

--- 帖子 #2115 ---
This was a very good site. Lots of information shared,

it seems to be failing probably to do with this bloody virus everything's up in the air,

I think one way of saving it is specifically picking the right pairs instead of having 26 pairs running every Wednesday,

We could still set it up to trade on Wednesday, but only with specifically correlated pairs,

one of the reasons we may have gone wrong with this. 26 pairs.

Certain pairs should not be traded against one another

an example of the EUR/USD if it going up you should sell USD/CHF, The EA was buying on both sides.

Just a thought,

--- 帖子 #2116 ---
I agree that we probably need a little more finesse with the strategy.

I have also found that there are significant differences between demo and live on my broker (IC Markets) where the demo has done well, but the live hasn't.

So I've been doing some backtesting, using just the first two 4 hour candles of the week to set direction, and have identified what appear to be the best pairs for the past 6 months. I ran it this week and have netted roughly 6% profit for the week (should have been 3% but I doubled up on the risk).

--- 帖子 #2117 ---
not trading this week as bank holiday this friday in the UK plus NFP as well.

I've think redfan is right we may possibly need some kind of trend filter to help choose which pairs to trade.

I was analysing GBPUSD from 2012 to today manually and the MOTU system is profitable.  I found the best setting was entry at 15% TP 75% and SL at 75%. I know risk reward is less than 1:1 but I found that it rarely hit TP set at 85% or more.  Setting SL at 50% also increased the amount of losses  that would have turned to winners if the SL was larger.

I don't know if this works for other pairs as I have not looked at them yet but will do and than post on here.  I'll play around with some trend filters etc to see if that helps.

Regards

--- 帖子 #2118 ---
I agree. I changed the code of the indicator to be able to select start/stop time of the two days. Makes a big difference. Depending on the pair you can see clearly how they follow fibo levels.

Hi all I am not trading this system this week due to a  bank holiday on Friday and the news friday . Last 2 weeks has been crap results .

--- 帖子 #2120 ---
I have this table that gives you positive and negative pairs
The positive pairs could all be buys OR all Sells they travel in the same direction,
The negative pairs. Travel in opposite directions. One would be a buy and the other a sell

GU was actually one of the worst when using 8 hours to determine the range. EU was not great, but I included it anyway as it was mildly positive.

Hint: Take a look at the AUD pairs for a start.

Better still check out my trade explorer: 10 trades this week- 5 winners and 5 losers, but still made a profit as I’m using 1:2 R:R.

Hi FX5Star,

A different MagicNumber is required for each pair otherwise there may be interference and if an order is executed or the entry level is already exceeded on a pair it will not pass the others in the same direction if this MagicNumber is identical.

Here's how I put it into action:

First of all, after placing the EA on the graph, I also place the indicator "TuBo_One Day_Indicator_corrected_V_1.1" with the same parameters as the EA, this in order to visualize if the levels are correct when the orders in waiting will be passed.

I deactivate Autotrading (at the top of the left side of the mt4 platform)

I open the table to adjust all the parameters and I check if the "authorize live trading" box is checked and I close it.

I reactivate Autotrading and I reopen the table of parameters and I click on "OK". BuyStop and SellStop orders are placed and we can immediately see if they are on the right levels as well as the StopLoss.

To place orders on another pair, I deactivate Autotrading again and open a new chart on a new pair and open the EA table again to change the MagicNumber and the position size if it must be different and other parameters if necessary.

I close the table, I reactivate Autotrading, I reopen the table and click again on "OK".

And so on for the other pairs. (don't forget to change the MagicNumber for each pair).

This procedure is somewhat similar to that of a script and you can turn off the PC once all the orders have been placed and simply monitor from time to time and intervene manually to adjust the strategy if necessary.

And if you leave the PC on, it will manage position tracking.

Keep me posted to let me know if your problem is resolved.

Hey transmat I have followed this article for quite a while. Many thanks 4ecstasy, Erebus, Sangui, transmat ... for your kind contributions. After watching I downloaded your EA and tested for a period of 10 years ago, this system is quite effective. I'm new to forex and English is not my advantage. I am having a little difficulty changing the candle end date. Because the default of this system is Friday and I want to switch it off the second candle next week to see if it is more effective? If you are not bothered, can you please help me fix the problem or instruct me to adjust it also. Thanks again and everyone very much.

Hello gixen,

Welcome to the (unforgiving) world of forex.

I guess you mean the second daily candle the following week.

First of all please download this latest version where sanme added Money Management and fixed some small problems, thank him for that.

You just have to place 2 in the box for the following Tuesday and adjust the desired time in the box below.

If you wanted Monday, it was 1.

You can put the day you want ...

Good continuation.

--- 帖子 #2138 ---
Hi! First of all thanks for keeping the code of the EA open. That's how it should be in this community. Thumbs up!

I am thinking of adding another parameter: open/close time that forms the virtual breakout box. Meaning, not simply using hi/lo from Monday-Tuesday but being able to say:

box should start at e.g. Monday 8:00 GMT and stop at Tuesday 17:00 GMT (do the hours sound familiar ;-) ?)

The reason is simple: I put endless numbers of fibo lines over the boxes and found out, that the support and resistance are formed from LO Monday until LC Tuesday. Okay, we do not know the direction, but IF a pair is leaving the box, then it normally uses these fibo lines to form the candles high/low.

I am just analyzing the code of the above EA to find an elegant way to determine the hi/lo without wasting precious processor time.

Something like this, taken from the Mo_TuBo Indicator:
Inserted Code   //determine hi/lo
boxStartShift = iBarShift(NULL,0,tBoxStart);
boxEndShift   = iBarShift(NULL,0,tBoxEnd);
boxHigh = High[iHighest(NULL,0,MODE_HIGH,(boxStartShift-boxEndShift+1),boxEndShift)];
boxLow  = Low[iLowest(NULL,0,MODE_LOW,(boxStartShift-boxEndShift+1),boxEndShift)];

--- 帖子 #2139 ---
Interesting, but not for big moves. Fundamental moves can ruin it.

--- 帖子 #2140 ---
Here is the EA with variable Monday start and Tuesday end for calculating the Mo-Tu highs/lows. The time is the broker time, no conversion (yet) to GMT.

Any idea how we can manage the different versions?

Try a simple method

Find the day ADR average daily range if the current it De range is less than 25% do nothing if it increases 25% Then look for buy or sell signals and catch them

Simple reason if there is a market movement then the day range will increase if there is no market movement it is flat

--- 帖子 #2142 ---
As the system (and EA) only opens few trades per year, with simple and strict rules, it would be a perfect candidate for a multipair EA. Then maybe with another filter (box size, trend or whatever)

--- 帖子 #2143 ---
Hi ursinho4711,

Well done for the modification of E A, it opens up new horizons ...

For my part, I added GMT offset on the Mo TuBo_indi indicator to adapt according to the broker's hours; if this is before GMT, place the - (minus) sign before the offset times.

--- 帖子 #2144 ---
Thanks for the flowers and same to you ;-)

There is probably a more elegant way of programming, but even these 4 lines of codes gave me some headache. Sometimes the lockdown is in the brain as well

Yes, you guessed it right . Thank you and sangui for giving me a new version of the upgraded EA

After installing I changed a lot. Actually, I just want to check my trade of lot size at 0.01, for a long time after that I will raise it manually.

And when installing this new EA it was duplicated transactions as shown below.

Since I do not know the specifications of the new EA, can you give me more instructions?

--- 帖子 #2146 ---
Hi gixen,

If you want the orders to always be the same size, just put "mmbyrisk" on false (double click on it and small arrow to the right) and you will find the basic E A.

For the rest, the problems have been fixed.

If you don't want to close the order before TP or SL is hit also set "closingOrder" to false.

Have fun.

--- 帖子 #2147 ---
my EA trades daily with a 50 to 100 pip collection and it keeps upgrading lot size as account balance grows

30% weekly is not bad for a dumb EA

An older version of EA entered market orders. This version enters several pending orders. Can I turn off MT4 after entering?

--- 帖子 #2152 ---
Yes of course.

The SL and TP commands being on the metaquote server, the EA can be disabled; however, he will not be able to manage the automatic closing of Friday orders or the deletion of the reverse order for orders still pending. But for that, it will have to be done manually.

MoTuBo_EA 1.071 was the previous version. I am attaching a new version.

The old and excellent version that you wrongly attribute to me is that of PaulDV which is on his thread:

My answer to your question on post 2157 is therefore obsolete.

Ask him the question ...

The latest version that you downloaded on this thread: "MoTu_Modifyed.mq4" as for it works correctly on my PC.

Edit: Error on my part, I just saw that Paul DV published the first versions of his EA on this thread, in March, I forgot ... my apologies

--- 帖子 #2158 ---
Because it enters pending commands at the same time, it fails with a large number of pairs.

--- 帖子 #2159 ---
dokopy,

Have you changed the MagicNumber for each pair?

I proceed as I indicated in post 2141 and I have no problem.

Prepare in advance a template with the Mo indicator TuBo_Indi_corrected as well as the EA with the already defined parameters that you will place on each graph and you will save a lot of time and once again do not forget to change the MagicNumber for each graph .

I am attaching a template already defined with the indicators I use which I place on an H4 or H1 graph for better visibility; it will work the same way as the time frime of your graph will be.

it is suitable for a GMT +3 broker.

It's up to you to modify it if your broker is another.

Hi @all (and especially transmat)!

I made a multipair version of the EA. It works well on the tester but not in real. I already know why (missing history for off-chart pairs) but did not have the time to find out how to program this in a neat way. But should not be a biggy.

Anyone here in the forum who thinks "Ah, I know how to help"?

I would not like to put a version of the multipair here in this thread, knowing that it does not work...

--- 帖子 #2163 ---
Hi ursinho471,

I see you don't stop! lol ...

When you say that it works on the tester, it is for only one pair at a time because MT4 does not manage the multipair on this one.

Unfortunately, I can not help you above, already that for a single pair is the headache for me in certain situations.

However I managed to add the profit taking in currency and it works ... on the tester.

it must be validated now live.

Keep me posted on the progress of your work.

See you soon.

--- 帖子 #2164 ---
Exactly, that's why I already know where to change the code. Maybe you know that I spent days and nights to create a multi-pair-blessing version (which works).

Here my problem is to access the last bars of the pairs that are not from the actual chart. But I think I already found to ways to do:

1. CopyHigh into an array and then find the highest value with ArrayMaximum

2. Find the index with iHighest and then find the value by iHigh (with index shift)

Both ways will work I believe, solution 1 looks more elegant...

Any other idea?

###############EDIT###############

Solution 1 works... letting it run on Demo account now. Already put orders for 9 pairs ;-)

--- 帖子 #2165 ---
Great, it works!

Can not wait to see it...

For what I added to the EA ie TP in currency, it works on the tester but live on demo account => not at all.

I must say that I applied a bastard solution: I took a position that was already winning (the EURUSD) I deleted the EA which had triggered the trade and replaced it with the one I have modified by adopting the same MagicNumber and the same other parameters but the trade was not closed once the TP in currency was reached.

I will try again next week with the same EA from A to Z.

--- 帖子 #2166 ---
Looked good today on the Demo. Now over the weekend I need to test all 28 pairs separately to see if there are no more of these small traps (like different digits).

Then I want to add individual spread values for the individual pairs and the possibility to apply different predefined limit sets. Something like

Set 1: 55%SL, 5% Entry, 38.2%TP

Set 2: 55%SL, 15% Entry, 61.8%TP

Set 3: 50%SL, 10% Entry, 50%TP

(just as examples)

Then a trailing stop would be cool. And and and...

--- 帖子 #2167 ---
Different digits?

Do you mean broker feeds or symbol digits?

Just wondering if I could be of help.

--- 帖子 #2168 ---
I was meaning symbol digits. As I jumped onto an existing EA that someone else programed, I was not sure whether all symbol properties had been taken by market info with symbol name and not via chart, NULL or hardcoded. I think you know what I am talking about...

The multipair is already running on demo. It works but it is too soon to see whether it works to 100% okay. Whereas 100% is impossible in software development ;-)

And already in profit ;-)

Dear 4ecstasy,

Thank you for such great strategy and thanks to all members who contributed with their efforts and ideas.

--- 帖子 #2172 ---
Hello I am new to this  thread  and am just a bit confused, the rules for calculating the price targets are implemented in the Expert Advisors  completely different from those described in the Thread.  Is there now a revised approach? At least I couldn't find a new set of rules within the Threads.  Does anyone have an updated set of rules?

--- 帖子 #2173 ---
I'm not aware of the EAs calculating the price targets being different to the original strategy posed by 4ecstacy, except that most of the EAs give the user the option of changing the target levels if they wish.

There's nothing stopping you from using the EAs with settings that match 4ecstacy's original setup.

As the thread has progressed, people have tried various alternative settings in an attempt to find something that works more consistently, but you're free to do your own testing and come up with your own settings.

Knowing the Mon Tue range also helps to keep out of a trade, or at least show why there isn't even an entry on Wednesday.

This charts shows an early break of last week's high on Tuesday, went as far as an average week in 2 days

Some analysis, what can we see  and prepare for next week:

1. Obviously broke trend line, don't even need to draw that on there

2. Broke and closed below last week's low

3. In fact, closed below the Low of previous 6 weeks, lowest close for 8 weeks

4. Nearly reached the average monthly range but there is still 9 trading days left. Given the overall increase in volatility of all pairs, I expect it to go beyond.

Not a pair that I usually trade, or profess to know, they are both funding currencies, this is analysis not trading advice

I like how the level at 1 was tested, an immediate reaction, but then it comes back down, and breaks again at 2

Now it's getting interesting on the 4 Hour chart

We can see that the 2 weeks before, not much joy using the Price Box of Monday Tuesday method

Or as I like to call it WTF as in trade on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday

But this week, a tradable break out to the low side, bit of a bounce at last weeks low, the magenta dash line at 1

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #2223 ---
And last of all, my favorite on Metatrader 5, the 2 Hours chart

We can see clearly the box drawn for Monday and Tuesday by my new indicator, with the pips range displayed, 92.3

At 1 there are lines, with price labels, for the HIGH of the box, and the user's setting for the buffer zone, available as fixed pips or percentage of range

At 2 there are lines, with price labels, for the LOW of the box, and the user's setting for the buffer zone, available as fixed pips or percentage of range

Buffer zone setting here is 10% of the range, 92.3 pips so = 9.2

Welcome any feedback, questions, criticism, suggestions, come on folks, let's beat the banks

Do you still trade this system every day? He suffered several loss-making weeks in a row.

--- 帖子 #2225 ---
I still use it as an analysis technique, along with many other factors.

You are right, using it as a mechanical system will produce losses, as well as spectacular gains, depending on what the market is doing.

Rather than trade the 28 pairs, I try to isolate a few select A-grade setups, and compound on those.

--- 帖子 #2226 ---
hello Erebus

- please Describe your A-grade setups?

- And do you share your weekly pending based on this strategy?

- Do you approve of the idea of using Fib retracement tool similar to what is stated in post 2222?

--- 帖子 #2227 ---
I look forward to sharing a robust profitable setting.

--- 帖子 #2228 ---
When was that? I had a good BO strat similar to this one which stopped being lucrative 2-3 years ago, after 10+years of great profits.

--- 帖子 #2229 ---
Describe your A-grade setups?  =

- Narrow range of Mon and Tue, approximately 1 x ADR(20) is great

- Breakout occurring from London to New York sessions on Wednesday

- Breakout coinciding with previous week's Low or High

- Strength meters showing the 2 currencies moving opposite

- Check the daily chart ADX for trend and strength

- similar price action for the other cross pairs

For example, check the JPY pairs, I'm seeing a concentrated strong move beginning, however, anything can happen. Except NZDJPY, as NZD also strong, you can see the battle of consolidation happening on that pair. I think of NZD as being Connor McGregor, someone just needs to knock the little focker out.

share your weekly pending based on this strategy?

It probably not legal to give out trading advice here on FF, and probably even worse to follow it  but I have posted plenty of charts. Anyone understand the analysis method can easily see the price levels. My Price Box indicator is FREE  for anyone using Metatrader 5, just send PM

Do you approve of the idea of using Fib retracement tool?

Approve?  I invented it, it's awesome,  do you have a problem with it? Something you don't understand about it?

Have a great week all, come on Wednesday

--- 帖子 #2230 ---
All possible settings have been discussed already in this thread, and there is another thread dedicated to an EA which really needs hard and fast settings

Did you study the recent charts just posted, on CHFJPY?

Here is the zoom in to the 15 minutes charts, what settings are you considering? If there is a guaranteed setting, I want to know too!

It is up to the individual trader to decide what settings will work for you, but realistically, when it works, the market decides and not the settings (IMHO)

Good luck to you

--- 帖子 #2240 ---
I know what you mean, you are correct, that was a demo account that took every pair, every price line touched, but it's more than a few weeks ago; I first posted in this thread in January 2020, and what a year it's been, right?

If you really need to more more of what, why and when I have posted, let me know, I can provide full details of my life, but here are a few words it will contain, bushfire, cancer, radiation, divorce, cybercrime loss of $23,650, incarceration, depression..  and lots of tears

As you can see, back in March when I was really excited about it, went overboard actually, but it had great weeks and then terrible weeks, as you pointed out.

And then I had to take a forced break from trading, now I am back, much calmer and focused. No long term stats, sorry.

The main thing that I have realized, and the concept you should take from this, use it as an analysis method and not purely a trading system.

Sure, you will still get great entries and then price reverses back 100% the other way - it's not you and it's not the method - the markets does what it wants.

Definitively incorporate the analysis part into whatever you use now; me, I use the longer term trend.

There are only two types of trades. Continuation or Reversal. Trend or Fade. Call it whatever you want, but whenever anyone places a trade they are always implicitly making a bet that prices will extend in the prior direction or will reverse.

To me, this method is obviously best for entering a continuation or trend, and that suits me as a breakout trader.

Probably said too much but hey, I'm just like anyone else, struggling to get ahead, figure out what will make a dollar from week to week.

--- 帖子 #2241 ---
I appreciate your work and openness. I guess I was wrong about the systems. I tested the system shown in the picture.

--- 帖子 #2242 ---
Prayers to you buddy.  Hope things are getting better.

--- 帖子 #2243 ---
The strength of JPY continued in Monday as expected; every pair broke the previous weeks' LOW, some good possibilities there, except...

for the USDJPY, as the USD showed great strength on Tuesday, and that sets up even greater opportunities, what are you guys seeing on your charts?

Could this be the beginning of some trends?

Some eagle eye regulars may spot that there are 2 Mon Tue levels shown on these charts, even though it is MT4 and there is no indicator for that (?)

I will do a tutorial for that shortly.

- wake up Wednesday -

--- 帖子 #2244 ---
For the Metatrader 4 users, there is a way to plot 2 lines for the Mon Tue range, 1 line for the exact high and low, and the other for a buffer zone of your choice.

The buffer zone is just an area that you can choose to use as you wish; does it show extra confirmation by a close below (or above)? is it just an area where you can take a trade because you know entries don't have to be that precise?

This is achieved by using 2 instances of Daily Line Boxes(1), the buffer zone can only be in pips, not percentage, so unfortunately when you use a Template, all pairs will have the same zone, be it 10 pips or 15 pips according to your settings.

Here are the settings I used, you can change to suit your charts, the main thing is to change the very last line "UniqueID" as shown, so it knows it a second application.

And of course, the colors, the clearance pips, any problem please ask. With the second instance, you can see that I have it to display on the D1 or Daily chart. This make it very easy to check every chart on Wednesday, on Daily, to spot any potential setups.

As usual, any feedback, comments, likes, criticisms and suggestions are welcomed

The good results without the exhaustive data that have resulted in them have only been praise.

--- 帖子 #2260 ---
I have no idea what you mean by "exhaustive data" but I will explain what transpires...

Buy and sell stop orders are placed at "entry" levels. When either is triggered, the other stop order is cancelled.

When (or if) price reaches "secure profit" level, I raise stop to breakeven plus a few pips in profit (usually 10 pips profit).

When (or if) price nears the "TP" level, I raise stop to "secure profit" level.

When (or if) price goes negative, my stop loss is in place at 50% fib level... and there have been stop outs.

That's it to the strategy. No "exhaustive data" to show except for the results over the past 3 weeks.

This is a simple strategy. Don't over complicate it.

I won't be "bragging" about my results... I'll just be a spectator in this thread.

Good luck

Markets (PRICE) can do 3 things, according to Stacey Burke

1 - Breakout - Pullback - Continue

2 - Breakout - Pullback - Range

3 - Breakout - Pullback - Reverse

An example of #1, both as last week's price action, and a larger scale move of the same Breakout - Pullback - Continue

And the guy wonders why the EA didn't work last week

In other news, found this guy, Stacey Burke, on Youtube, he has hundreds of videos, all FREE, he has a website with a FREE audio

And he doesn't have an expensive course? As far as I can tell it's all FREE

Moderators, please note it's FREE

Hi All, I just joined into this thread and found this strategy really interesting. But I also found that currently there are not many posts here.

Is it because some bad results or everybody focus to trade in real account? Anyway, I planned to try this strategy in demo account starting next Wednesday.

--- 帖子 #2272 ---
I have been testing this strategy for some time and it works quite well, although it has given me better results by opening operations on Monday at 8 GMT, would it be possible to add to the Motu_modifyed EA and the Motbo_indi_corrected indicator the option to choose the day and time of opening operations? thank you

--- 帖子 #2273 ---
Hi

Here is the indicator modified to be able to be used on the days of the week and in the desired time slots.

After having defined the day of the week (1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, etc ...) it suffices to display the departure time (broker's time) and the number of hours that the box must include.

Regarding the EA, I don't know if I will be able to modify it, especially since I don't have too much time available at the moment.

I'll see what I can do...

But only with the indicator, the different levels being defined, it suffices to place pending orders with SL and TP then to manage them manually; it should not be too cronophagous.  ;-)

Good luck.

--- 帖子 #2274 ---
thank you very much transmat !! great!! provisionally I will make manual orders on Mondays at 8:00 GMT anyway, I would make it a monument if when you have time you can modify the EA, because the execution is much faster and you could have an automatic MM.

--- 帖子 #2275 ---
As an analysis method, this can work IF you put in the proper filters, eg. what is the range of Monday + Tuesday?

Is there room to move for the rest of the week?

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #2276 ---
Hi,

Here is the EA modified as requested by Clipi, to be coupled with the indicator that you will find on station N ° 2279.

it is to be placed on a graph H1.

Hope you are satisfied with this.

If there are any errors let me know (there probably are).

the broker's time must be displayed (to be set with GMT time)

When placing the EA and setting the parameters, it is best to close "AutoTrading" and then reopen it once all the peers are finished (with a different magicNumber).

And of course, this EA should only be used on a demo account for educational purposes.

;-)

--- 帖子 #2277 ---
Thank you very much for your big work, tomorrow I will test if it works correctly.

--- 帖子 #2278 ---
The EA does not work correctly, of the 15 pairs that it had configured, it only placed pending orders in EA AJ EU GJ the rest did not, then GJ and EU canceled the orders after a few minutes.

The MM used was the same 0.07 lot for each pair, whether it had an SL of 30 or if it had an SL of 100, the MM should have calculated the risk of 0.5% by the size of the SL.

Thank you very much anyway.

--- 帖子 #2279 ---
A simpler option would be, if the Mody Modifyed EA works correctly by opening pending operations on Tuesday at 23:59, directly change the opening time of pending operations to Monday at 10 o'clock without the option to modify the time.

--- 帖子 #2285 ---
Hello Clipi,

Indeed, there are problems.

In backtest, it works but in live it is rather capricious.

I am not the originator of this EA (I made only minor contributions to it) and I am far from understanding everything in the code.

With the modified code there must be some bad interactions ...

The best would be to start from scratch.

I'll see if I have another more suitable code structure, but I can't give a delay;

Otherwise in the "Platform Tech" forum maybe someone can do it here:
https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...-for?page=2122

For my part, I will test other solutions and I will keep you informed of the progress.

Good continuation.

--- 帖子 #2288 ---
I stuck with the same code and think I found the source of the problems.

Here is the new version which after a few modifications should work normally (well I hope).

I did some live tests and it's ok on my platform.

On the other hand for the money management, I did not touch it; it was like that in MoTu_Modifyed EA; the position size is determined by the account balance and% risk and not by the size of the StopLoss.

Test to see if it works well every day and at different times on demo account to validate this version.

Good luck.

Hello,

Here is the version which determines the size of the lots according to the StopLoss according to the wishes of Clipi and its strategy.

Do not look for the V7, it was only used to test different solutions.

To refine the size of the batch, I added a corrective coefficient that we can adjust around 1.00 if necessary ... (see description in the settings)

I think this should all work and if there are any issues let me know.

In backtesting the EA seems to work normally, EU like the others.

Hello Toppi

Sorry for the problems caused but I think it is the high number of "OrderModify" requests on BreakEven that is the cause because I have not reactivated the "return".

Hope the problem is resolved on this version.

Let me know.

I'm replacing the previous v_10_2 with the version v_10_3 on Post 2313.

Once again, my apologies.

--- 帖子 #2313 ---
hello please can u give me details on BE?

--- 帖子 #2314 ---
Hello,

BE = BreakEven.

After prices have gone in the desired direction, the stopLoss is brought back to the entry level after a certain number of pips previously defined in the setting.

--- 帖子 #2315 ---
Hello,

There are problems with version BO_EA .... V_10_3 for the BreakEven function.

On the strategy tester it works well but live often the stopLoss is brought back to the entry point as soon as the order is placed and of course it is executed immediately.

So don't use it anymore and I put here version V_8_2 with range limits.

Sorry for not being able to resolve this issue at this time.

Why would Tuesday high do that? Maybe going below the weekly open invalidates the high.

To continue from the last post, let's look at a pair known to be difficult to get any pips from, EURCAD

First, we need the BIAS from the weekly chart, last 3 weeks are down, so let's say that we are looking for a SELL

Sell in the current week

--- 帖子 #2329 ---
And to finish, go to the 1-hour chart, you can see the exact price action that he says to look for, which,

Is, a move higher on Monday and maybe higher on Tuesday, always knowing where the OPEN line is

He says for an experiment, just Sell (or Buy) 30 pips away from the Open and 180 pips stop loss

I say, let's try an entry 0.5 of ADR(20) from the Open price, stop loss at 1.0 ADR(20)

For the EURCAD, ADR(20) is 96 pips, so round up to 100, half is 50 pips for the Entry level

And Take Profit at 2 to 1, don't be greedy, easiest pips you will ever find

So entry could be either Monday or Tuesday, Wednesday is payday!

Any questions?

In my opinion the hard part of this method is to get the weekly bias right.

What criteria are we to use to gauge the weekly trend? That is where it becomes subjective, is it direction of the previous week's bar, two previous bars, a moving average?

--- 帖子 #2331 ---
If you are having a hard time finding the trend in a pair then you should just move on to another pair where the trend is easily defined

--- 帖子 #2332 ---
Why is it hard? No moving average mentioned, my best guess is about 3 to 4 weeks same direction, use that for a start; if it's mixed, move to the next pair.

If the current week is opposite of your Weekly Bias, you won't see the price action that you want to see, therefore there won't be any trade setups in the direction you want; you can't lose.

Name a pair and get a free analysis, I like a challenge

And glad for the feedback, thanks

Here is an interesting one to watch next week, trend has definitely been UP, now a bearish weekly candle

I would just let price tell me in the movement of Monday and Tuesday to decide if there is a trade setup, I think slight bias for more downside.

But it could be a neutral week, this is usually a low volatility pair.

I'm sure the pattern traders see a Head & Shoulders, the Fibo people will have a view, the support and resistance people will have a theory, maybe even the Batty people can chime in!

We can all be correct, price action rules.

My favorite candle formation is on a HTF (D,W,M......the higher the better) when in a UPTREND price sets a new swing high with a RED candle or if in a DOWNTREND price sets a new swing low with a GREEN candle. I trade the reversal of the trend on the start of the following candle......BUT, THERE MUST BE LOTS OF ROOM TO THE LEFT. By the looks of this chart you post, it's very close to being a really good signal imo. Definitely worth placing a trade on imo.

EDIT: Just take a look at the High to the left. It was set by a Red candle it looks like. Then look at the big move down afterwards. I could care less that it's a pinbar. That was just an added bonus.

EDIT 2: I just noticed that the move UP just prior was also started with a White candle at the end of the downtrend.

Isn't the weekly bar hindsight? On Mon or Tues I don't know what the weekly bar will look like.

Interesting test if Sunday open drops 30 pips - go long with SL 150 pips - shouldn't be difficult to backtest this theory.

Isn't the weekly bar hindsight?

Please be more specific; yes, all previous weekly bars are hindsight, astute observation

On Mon or Tues I don't know what the weekly bar will look like.

Another fantastic observation, you're not the only one by the way

But by using the weekly bias and careful observation of the price action on Monday and Tuesday, we can PLAN a trade entry

Perhaps you can show us how you trade or analyze the market?

Hello Erebus

Thank you for posting this chart, this is exactly what I meant in my previous posts, weekly trend is up, last week is a down bar.

Now we want to establish a bias for the coming week, which one do we go by? The trend or last bar? At the open of the week we want to set a limit order 30-40 pips above or below the line as HE says, if we go with the trend we should set it below the line if we go with last bar's direction we should set it above the line. Or if we want to observe price action on M-T, if bias is long we should pay attention to the lows on those days and vice versa.

I am trying to make this method work in my favour as much as possible because I like it, I am not criticizing it.

Myself I would choose direction of the last bar as the bias and make it a rule.

--- 帖子 #2342 ---
Lol, thanks for your sarcastic remarks - I am pointing out what is not clear to me - the ICT presenter shows a hindsight success.

Make a vid with Monday and Tuesday on the chart and then explain what you think will happen next.

I don't care if it's going to be a losing or a winning trade, just have the guts and go to the hard right edge.

With your own words, Erebus: "..and careful observation of the price action on Monday and Tuesday, we can PLAN a trade entry"

ICT presenter: "I did in fact take this trade and shared it on twitter" that's wonderful - but could be coincidence also.

Still interested if anybody is looking at the 30 pips drop at week open /150 pips SL strategy.

Or perhaps ICT has explained his statistical edge and I missed that info.

.

--- 帖子 #2343 ---
I wouldn't get too concerned about having a bias, if it's neutral, be neutral, watch the price action, simple.

I wouldn't get locked into just the last week direction either, that could just be the retracement needed before the main trend continues.

When the required price action is observed on Monday and Tuesday, plan the trade, be it the trend continuation or trend change.

When the proper price action doesn't appear on Monday and Tuesday, nothing to do, next pair, next week, no problem.

The way I read your post, it's like you are trying to make the analysis fit every week no matter what.

Good luck

--- 帖子 #2344 ---
Is there any other way to show success?

Is that sarcastic?

Who cares? Doubters are going to doubt; if you don't see it, you don't see it.

There are videos, there are Forex Peace Army reviews, there is this podcast

https://tradingnut.com/michael-inner-circle-trader-ict/

I'm just showing the part that I am interested in and that I think might work for me, trying to share that with FF members.

Which is the weekly direction, Monday and Tuesday retracement, and day trade that situation - WHEN IT APPEARS.

I will try to share that this week if I can, unfortunately, I have a special meeting on Wednesday so may not be able to catch all setups.

I don't understand the demand to make a video to show a real-time Monday Tuesday situation; surely you can look at past charts?

We already explained the price action to look for and what we think will happen next; did you miss that part?

Everywhere I see the advice to backtest a method to find if it works for you, why is this any different?

Normally I would post another chart here but apparently not good enough for you!

Good luck

No video from me, only what I observed. First, I think of 2 ways to check the weekly bias, a TREND LINE and mark out the highs of each week past.

What do you see on the 4 Hour chart? I see exactly the PRICE ACTION that he mentions in the video, or as he suggested, just SELL 30 pips away from the OPEN.

Just trying to help, folks, have a good one.

I think and I certainly hope that everyone knows about the theory to sell (or buy) at a retracement level of an engulfing candle.

Usually, that means around 50% which is not a Fibonacci number, more of a Gann number I believe.

Anyway, let's check that out on the daily chart, remember where the ideal place to sell (or buy) is? Yes, the WICK of the Weekly candle.

Oh, and if you didn't read any of the previous posts, or watch the recommended videos, it will help you greatly if you do.

Here is a question to ask yourself, say you have not been able to enter any trade on Mon, Tue or Wed

You missed all the levels already mentioned, but you can see them now; you know about the Ideal Sell Zone

Now it's Thursday, as price trades below the Weekly Open, the master candle on the right turns RED

It has been almost 100 pips higher and was GREEN while above the Weekly Open

Q. Would, could, and should I start selling now?

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #2359 ---
Of course, it doesn't always present like the example above, sticking with the CAD, which we now know was STRONG

By the time we get to Thursday, the Weekly Master Candle is huge RED already

And conveniently, the price is breaking the previous weekly low, the Mon Tue low

Not to forget a very nice Inside Day on Wednesday, fractal levels, the round number at 1.52

What more do we need? Put some MA's on there did you say?

I like your idea. How do you find your TP?

--- 帖子 #2361 ---
When I place a trade, TP usually set at 2 or 3 times the Stop Loss

Hi Simple Monday Tuesday community,

I have just read the first post of this thread and not sure if what this first post says is what 4ecstasy wanted to say.

It says that:

And based on what I read in the lines below that text, the system relies on entries triggered by price surpassing those levels. Am I right?

So that "often" word combined with entry points outside no-common levels (so to speak) makes sense? It sounds like trying to trade counter commonly maximum and minimum prices of the week.

What chances of beating those levels we have if those levels are commonly maximum and minimum of the week?

What am I losing here?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #2363 ---
Im thinking of applying mean reversion to this strat. M or T HH and LL often form the HH or LL of the week if my understanding is correct.

--- 帖子 #2364 ---
I don't see it like that especially after viewing the Inner Circle Trader videos where he says to be alert for highs (or lows) on Mon, Tue or Wed even

They form the Wick of the Weekly candle, so why wouldn't they often be the high or low of the week?

The first chart I looked at has 2 examples; high is made, reverses, a breakout of the Mon Tue low

Can you see it?

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #2365 ---
And that is what I'm after. If Monday, Tuesday or even Wednesday have most of the times the low of the week (not sure whether that's true), then trying to make a profit for a short trade below that level does not make too much sense. Because as you states there, the low most often will be done from Monday to Tuesday and not after, and is after when you were trying to make money. Meaning, most of the times you won't have a new low (because most of the times has been already made) and so, won't get a profitable trade.

--- 帖子 #2366 ---
What part are you missing?

The trade isn't in the same direction as the high or low - it's a breakout in the other direction, therefore the "most of the time high or low" is still in place.

If you still don't see it, I suggest you study weekly candles, how are those wicks made anyway?

Have you watched the videos I posted earlier?

I have posted lots of charts, maybe you are overthinking the situation.

Good Luck

--- 帖子 #2367 ---
You trade short if after Tuesday the price surpass the Low of the week. You trade long, if after Tuesday, the price surpass the high of the week. Am I right?

--- 帖子 #2368 ---
Study this chart for as long as it takes, until the statement about "most of the time the high or low of the week is made on Mon or Tue"

Breakouts are everywhere you look; each trader has to decide which one to take.

There are only a few ways to enter the market, on a breakout level, on a retracement level, or at the market on a psychic message.

Good Luck  and Happy St Patrick's Day

Go the Green Pips

--- 帖子 #2369 ---
Understood. I will make my research over this trading system and come back. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #2370 ---
And if you have watched the videos, he does say just buy below the weekly open (dashed line)

I forget the number of pips he said, but it is based on having a direction based on the previous week, which is obviously UP.

So that would be an entry based on retracement without having an actual level apart from a random number.

Of course, it doesn't work every week on every pair; when you find that let me know.

It's just about trading what we see, and if what we see fits the theory, then good to go.

Let's come back Friday for review.

And how about the low of that previous week? When was it made?

Definitely the low was made early in the week, Monday is the blue day, then Wednesday, the green day, was Inside Day, and a great breakout opportunity!

Yes, that was the original idea. That is also context for the EA created by @PaulDV

https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...ay-breakout-ea

But I guess in the meantime the original idea is open to interpretation.

I use the set up for Monday only because Monday quite often represents the smallest daily range of the week.

If there is a Tue breakout I like to be on.

3. take profit at 2 x the range

- is the monday-tuesday range relevant for every currency according to you ?

- what are the currencies you are looking at ,

- what is the % of risk per each trade done on a currency per week ? (% of risk on a single currency  : Stop Loss / capital)

- how many trades do you take per week on average,

- what is your usual win ratio (per week and/or per currency ) ?

Thank you in advance for your kind answer.

--- 帖子 #2385 ---
Sorry Erebus , I forgot something : when you say "buy the breakout of the monday-tuesday range" , don't you take a target of +-something to enter the trade or do you consider the exact range ?

--- 帖子 #2386 ---
No, ask in the EA thread, they will be able to run backtests on any parameters you desire

At first, I used this as a trading system, that fails, so I use it as an analysis of the PRICE ACTION

when the PRICE ACTION is right, as it was last week, good results

you can either forward test it, backtest it, or leave it but I can't spoon feed it to you

--- 帖子 #2387 ---
how are you using ADR (20), what precisely? - volatility reading, reference points, price targets

is the Monday-Tuesday range relevant for every currency according to you? - yes

what are the currencies you are looking at -  AUDCAD, AUDCHF, AUDJPY, AUDNZD, AUDUSD, CADCHF, CADJPY, CHFJPY, EURAUD, EURCAD, EURGBP, EURJPY, EURNZD, EURUSD, GBPAUD, GBPCAD, GBPCHF, GBPJPY, GBPNZD, GBPUSD, NZDCAD, NZDCHF, NZDJPY, NZDUSD, USDCAD, USDCHF, USDJPY

what is the % of risk per each trade done on a currency per week? - this is up to each individual trader according to his trade plan, his risk profile, his account size

what is your usual win ratio? - didn't trade it every week, every week is different, do some backtest, I cannot spoonfeed you with everything

--- 帖子 #2388 ---
that was the original idea, any trader is welcome to use any parameters that he wishes

best to backtest the idea to see if it is any good for you

or forward test it, write down YOUR rules, be sure to share the results, good or bad

--- 帖子 #2389 ---
Thank you Erebus for your kind answer.

--- 帖子 #2390 ---
WOW, as I suspected, this week would be difficult; thanks to the CAD, pretty much impossible.

Surely everyone can see the concept of, if and when there are HUGE moves on Mon to Tue, using ADR as a reference point, then do you really expect those moves to continue?

I guess, if there was a true fundamental reason behind the move, yes the direction could be correct and there might be an extra 200 or 300 pips move, but let's see what happens.

On this chart, it didn't even break out, so no problem.

On another note, on this chart, I see that taking the level from the previous week could be an option at times...

Bit of an update for the week of April 26 - 30, 2021

A couple of things I used for this backtest, introduce a Wednesday time window, which means if the trade is not triggered on Wednesday, no trade for the week.

The 2nd thing would be using a Stop Loss of 0.5 of ADR (20) and a Take Profit of 1 x ADR (20), moving to Break Even when 1 to 1 level is reached.

Pretty standard risk management that all should be familiar with. A move of 1 x ADR (20) is not asking that much when there are 2.5 days left in the week.

And as I used Metatrader 5, I was able to use my PriceBox indicator which has the ability to set a variable Buffer size as per the original rules.

I used 10% of the Mon Tue range; this allows for the different volatility of each pair.

I used the guideline of waiting for a close on the 1-hour candle beyond the Mon Tue range and setting the pending order at the Buffer price level.

The final gain on the week shows 9 R, so if the risk per trade was 1% that means a gain of 9%, just don't expect me to ever report a profit in pips.

Here is an example of how simple this trade can be. For me, EURCAD is a notoriously difficult pair to get any pips, and yet this looks easy.

ADR (20) is 97 so, round to 100, make the Stop Loss 50 pips, the Take Profit 100 pips.

Did anyone notice on the report that there are 8 full TP trades and 8 full SL trades?

This is the stock standard teachings of FX trading, use a Risk-Reward of 2 to 1, and even with 50% losers you still make money.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #2401 ---
While using the smaller stop loss of half ADR gives a better chance of reaching a 2 to 1 profit target but it also comes with the risk of quicker stop loss also.

You would be crying over this one  and just about any re-entry method would recover to break even at the least.

Hi man again a question.

Do you use in entry trade 0.5 of ADR 20 (SL) and 1 to 1 for TP?

--- 帖子 #2414 ---
The last question ... I hope.

Do you place a buy limit and a sell limit under and over the mon tue range or you choise one direction?

thanks for your kindness

--- 帖子 #2415 ---
No, the idea is to find the RANGE using the highest price of Monday or Tuesday and the lowest price of Monday or Tuesday.

The absolute HIGH and the absolute LOW will be the SAME on every time frame.

Then you can make a plan to enter at that price or at some percentage of the range above or below that price, or at a certain number of pips above or below that range.

So, it is impossible to say which candle will cross the chosen price line, it could be on Wednesday, it could be on Thursday.

It might even be on Friday if that is your plan. And I promise you, when it crosses the line, the time frame doesn't matter.

In the same way that you chose 10% margin to sell or buy the maximum and the minimum, I am analyzing 27% behavior. If you consider the variation that has the shadow of the daily candle.

I did not understand your observation if you also use one.

--- 帖子 #2422 ---
Two weeks ago, if he had sold after level 10, he had lost money, he was very close and came back, if he closed below that level I believe he has little chance of catching the stop loss, because he must continue from 1,618 to 200, at most to 2,618.

Interestingly, the price went to the next week testing the 2.618 and then went down to test the 1.27, it was a very lateral week.

--- 帖子 #2423 ---
Sorry, it wasn't clear what you were doing, looked like using 1.27% Fibonacci on Gold, so carry on

Hello Erebus Please Send this MoTu Indicator Thank you

--- 帖子 #2425 ---
Can it be said that it is a harami or just a triangle?

He made the pattern on the minimum of Monday, and went up, only those who use H4 saw it.

Whoever was in H1 saw a hammer, less intuitive because it had already passed the expected level for entry.

Is it better to just see H4 for this strategy?

He made the famous pattern at the S38 level of the weekly fibonacci.

Hi Erebus.

A question.

You that trade from AU wich are the pairs with low spread during asian and Sidney session.

I ask to you because I found an EA that trade during low volatily on the bollinger and low atr so the most of operations are during that time.

--- 帖子 #2428 ---
There is an indicator for the range of Mon Tue for MT5 only

Hi Erebus，

Do you trade using EA?

--- 帖子 #2431 ---
GBPNZD stoploss? It seems that it ended in profit.

--- 帖子 #2432 ---
Yes, I use an EA but the parameters and trade are set manually if you know what I mean.

It calculates the position size and the take profit from the initial settings, then manages the trade, being trailing stop, stop loss or take profit.

You can find the demo version here -

--- 帖子 #2433 ---
Ah-ha, this is why I make mistake, to see if anyone is reading the results!

Actually, not sure what I did there, in the demo account, it was exit by the 75 trailing stop loss, so definitely at least a 1 to 1 winner.

Thanks for catching that, will update the spreadsheet later as I have to go out today.

I like your trading journal. Where can I subscribe for it. You are good at sourcing utilities.

You may PM me if its a commercial link.

How do you calculate the entry price?

--- 帖子 #2436 ---
Entry is calculated by taking 10% of the Range of the Mon Tue High to Mon Tue Low,

So, 10%, above or below the range limits, different for every pair

--- 帖子 #2437 ---
Thank you!

--- 帖子 #2438 ---
Is there a Monday/Tuesday range limit of when not to trade?  It thought I read something on this but cannot find it now.

--- 帖子 #2439 ---
Hey man.

How are the counts going?

Do you stop to post it?

Thanks you for all replies on this entire forum, I think you are the only that make sense on all the strategys on forexfactory

--- 帖子 #2443 ---
Thank you, very much appreciated

All the USD pairs this week, this is why it pays to watch these levels just as a Price Action even if you are not trading it as a method

--- 帖子 #2444 ---
Hi Erebus thanks for your hard work!

Didn't read all the hundred pages but did you find this method to gives good return?

Not sure about what you say in post #2446 !Thank you

--- 帖子 #2445 ---
It can return phenomenal results on the right week, absolutely...

But it will eat your account on other weeks...

That's why I just recommend using it as an ANALYSIS method...

When you see a setup happening, other price action, strong & weak, fundamental situation and the stars lined up together...

Then you hit that pair(s) as hard as you can; it won't even happen every week, but when it does, usually on correlated pairs.

Also, it can help make the decision to stay out of the market, which can save you some time, money, and regrets.

The market can only move in 3 directions, just know where it is from week to week...

Good luck

I agree the stop loss rule is fearsome for this method

Learning a lot on forex trading and i think i'm starting to connect the dots !

It all make sense when learning but once in front of the chart i'm just lost, not even confident to determine the current trend sometimes

Thanks for your feedback !

--- 帖子 #2447 ---
What am I missing? My screenshot does not display. Using "Upload from device" option, same as I've used since 2010???

Was attempting to show the fib settings I've found useful.

Entry level @ 14% either side of MonTue range.

TP is 50% either side of MonTue range.

SL is 33% level, back inside of range.

TP= to 36%

SL= to 47%

Most testing I've done (GA & GU) show an overall profit of approx. 25%. This is quite early to go all in on these numbers. But worth further evaluation.

--- 帖子 #2448 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This hard stuff. After THOROUGHLY reviewing previous testing, the numbers are still positive, But not by much. Pairs I've tested, going back 40 weeks each, are; GU, GA, & Gchf.

• I eliminated large ranges. On GA, ranges over 180, GU & GChf ranges over 125. On all pairs, trades were closed prior to end of week. Most of those, were in a basic break even range.

• I did change Stop Loss levels to 30%, from 33%, as I noticed that when price reverses a normal amount, it rarely reaches 30%. If price goes beyond 30%, it's usually by quite a lot. It doesn't appear that using a larger SL, makes much sense.

• Another change is trailing the SL (once only). If price makes it half way to TP, my testing moves SL from 44 to 28(14% inside range). 44 being the distance from entry, at 14% beyond MT range, back to 30% inside range.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

--- 帖子 #2449 ---
This place is quiet? is the strategy no longer viable? I think there is more that can be derived from this strategy. Thanks for all who have contributed. My first contribution will be using the channel as a support or resistance for the coming week, monitor the movement of the channel, it can good predictor of bias.

--- 帖子 #2450 ---
Anybody still trading this strategy?

--- 帖子 #2451 ---
I have stated a few times in this thread that I only use this as an analysis method, from which a trade may or may not be taken considering other price action events.

For example, CONSOLIDATION

--- 帖子 #2453 ---
Nice one Erebus, this can be a potential setup to be traded week in week out...look for Mo-Tue h&l not broken within the previous week and look to trade it on break out in the coming week.

Thank you for sharing.

--- 帖子 #2454 ---
Many pairs have already reached their weekly average range, notably the AUD pairs; however, that doesn't mean they will stop there, and watch the price action.

The best I can see right now is the EURUSD, it has room to move, and has broken some recent supports; as long as the USD continues with strength and EUR remains weak, good to go.

Conversely, the USDCHF is ready to long, along with some JPY pairs, look at USDJPY of course.

Good Luck

wrong chart it seems as the reasoning for entry and exit is misguided.  more of a basic approach is needed all of the complexity is getting in the way.

--- 帖子 #2456 ---
I am anxiously awaiting your guidance for an example of "more of a basic approach"

Please open a TE and explain how it works

Or start with this chart and tell me what is wrong?

Is it too complex for you?

--- 帖子 #2457 ---
I was talking about the timeframe..

Yes to complex for me I like simple things

I am no one who am I to say anything about your methods of trading. I trade this strategy everyday and have no problems though I am not interested in talking about them. Its a good one its never failed me.

I think you are on the right track though good luck..
