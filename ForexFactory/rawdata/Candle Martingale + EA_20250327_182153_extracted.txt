Warning (2016-10-12): There seems to be a bug in the EA that may stop it from working properly. It is strongly recommended not to use this EA on live accounts until further notice.This trading system is based on a set of different trade logic for the first trade. If the market goes against our favorite direction, every N pips we open another position according to Martingale strategy. If the net profit reaches to what we set in the input settings of the EA, all the open positions will be closed.

The entry logic is Trade Bollinger Bands, where A position will be opened when the candle is closed above/below BB bands.

Exponential Basket Close:

If the user set the input parameter "Exponential Basket Close?" to "Yes", then the EA closes all the open position at a lower target profit as an exponential function of the number of open positions. For example, if there are 7 open positions, and the take profit is set to 20.0 USD, then the EA will close all the seven positions if their net profit reach at a lower profit than 20.0 (let's say 3.0 USD). This option is there to test the idea of getting out of a sequence of losers with some smaller profit as soon as possible (that is, before blowing up the account).

NOTE 1: Martingale based EAs are very risky! Use this EA at your own risk. There is no guarantee that the EA will be profitable or bug-free.
NOTE 2: This EA works on any time frame.

--- Update 2016-09-29---
Version 2.00 of the EA released.

i think this idea have a good point

Nice bro!

Could you check this topic : http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...37112&page=143  ? Its similar but little different entry rules. Could you make martingale this topic turn EA? I think its would be very accurate

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Thanks for sharing this EA. I have some questions:

1. What does it mean by grid size?

2. as default, TP is set 1. Does it mean 1% target or else?

3. what is the multiply of martiangle if the price goes against the direction? And what is the pip step (N pips) for the next open position in marti?

--- 帖子 #5 ---
1. What does it mean by grid size? How many pips price must move for next order to open.

2. as default, TP is set 1. Does it mean 1% target or else? When all open trades reach a equity profit of 1.00 all trades close.

3. what is the multiply of martiangle if the price goes against the direction?  Doubles lot size per each new order.

And what is the pip step (N pips) for the next open position in marti? Pip step (N pip) is the grid size,  is set at 10 pips in the EA.

I did not write the EA but from the tests I ran, those are your answers.

In 6 month back test  I did on this EA it will blow a few accounts depending on the pair. Others do fairly well with minimal DD. So its hit or miss. Not something you would even consider throwing live. At least not the way its currently configured.

good job

Looking forward to try it, thanks.

@Math why will this happen at the end ? is it due to orders still being open while my end date of my backtest as already ended ?

Version 1.02 of the EA released. In this version first-trade time filter added. I updated Post 1.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
@morne72: the Grid distance between the orders is very little, with EU must make 40 Pips or greater

and the TP by 40 Pips distance 20 Pips

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Lowest DD backtest (v1.02)

--- 帖子 #12 ---
- test with M15 or H1 and TP 20 more profit and go higher with the distance to 50 (TP 27) H1 and 60 M15 (TP 32)

--- 帖子 #13 ---
5 years (2010 ~ 2015) backtest,

--- 帖子 #14 ---
From the tests I have run on this (about 50 on daily TF over 1.5 years) you need large grid size on daily TF to keep  many pairs from blowing up. Some do well like this E/U one. Others blow up or the percent profit on the safer settings is not worth the risk involved. I did notice many of the longer running baskets were opening sell trades on strong up trends and vice versa. Maybe adding a MA filter will help make it a litter safer. Would not know for sure unless tested.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Math.I would like to plaay with The EA as it seems to me that The idea is similat to a cbot i am used in live and double my account. One day though I have lost all for to much greed. Would you like to share the code or fxdreema blocks if using fxdreema?

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Version 1.04 of the EA released. In this version an input is added in order to limit the number of Martingale positions. I updated Post 1.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
This my test

profit factor 1.9 goood

the other on is with every tick not good

my be this is one strategy that only use open price of every candle

--- 帖子 #18 ---
I like where you are going with this...

H1+D1

A little more dynamic...ya know, for shitz n gigglez.

(Do not use the attached EA on a live account)
Default H1 timeframe

--- 帖子 #19 ---
I'll change the code such that it will open a new Martingale position only if the next hourly candle opens X pips in opposite direction of the first-trade's favor. This way, the first-trade decision would be based on the patterns of D1 candles, but the entry points are dynamic and based on H1 candles. Let's see how it would perform at the end of the day.

Best,

Math

hi math7,

i like your work, for quite some time. thanks for sharing this. this is the safest (survive multiple years backtest) mart i've ever seen,

i hope this project will workout well for all.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
You're welcome! :-)

Hope we can make it better.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Hi Math7,

I was wondering, how long does it take for the EA to kick in?

I've had it running for a few hours on GBPUSD H1, I was expecting it to open some short trades, but still hasn't opened any.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
It's ok, it opened trades now.

I was under the assumption that as soon as the E.A is active, it immediately looks at the previous candle, if it was a Bear Candle, and the current bar ends up closing as a Bear candle, it'll open trades. But it doesn't. I also assumed that once it has trades open and successfully closes them out at profit, that it would still monitor the Bar's status; Bear or Bull and re-open another set of trades starting at the default lot size. But it doesn't.

What are the exact rules that aren't explained in the opening post?

Best regards,

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Hello MathTrader7,

Thank you for your this post, I used your EA but it is not working properly on my MT4, it only opens trade on 1M time frame but without TP, there is only an option of Profit target, so it means if we set 50$ profit in that case system will only close the trades when target met, regardless its one position or more... So in that case it is not sound good for my point of view and may be I am wrong. Correct me if I am wrong.

In the meanwhile I got another Matriangle system applied live on Demo Account. I just have investor password of this account but not the EA.

I like this calculation formula, and TP target. Most of the martiangles are fail when market moves 200 pips or more on the same direction without any retracement but as for as this martiangle calculation formula market can survive us with more then 400 pips without retracement.

So I think this martiangle is best ever I see in the market. But bad luck I do not have this EA in my hand.

You are kindly requested to check this account and see what is happening in this account. 100% profit in just ONE month. and I think it is amazing.

I am sure you are expert in coding. See this account and code this EA for us. and I am sure we all will be in profit by using this type of Martiangle.....

Please comment every body if you think I am right after watching this account. Here is the Detail:-

lets keep this thread on topic!

--- 帖子 #26 ---
@FYCyborg - you are very right man !!

Why the hell sitetalker put here his fancy informantion about an EA he even dont know ? Anyone could pronounce something about results he/she got somethere in this world or anythere in the universe .....

--- 帖子 #27 ---
im sure the Mod's will remove the spammy posts?

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Version 1.06 of the EA released. In this version an input is added in order to let the user choose Open price only/Every Ticks mode. I updated Post 1.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Found a bug.

When trading station closes down, or internet is dropped... The E.A doesn't check for existing trades that were opened by the EA and starts a fresh.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
your strateji good but why you dont use sl and dynamic lot size ? coz the ea is bomb

--- 帖子 #31 ---
I am using the EA on a love account but it hasn't traded in two days. Would you recommend any particular settings?

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Good observation!

I'll fix this issue in the next version.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Are you running it on D1 timeframe? If so, it takes a few days for the EA to receive a valid signal to open a position. For testing, you can run it on lower timeframes such as H4 and H1.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
I'll add a net stop loss input to the next version of the EA.

The dynamic lot size is reasonable for the Open Price Only mode, and I may implement such feature in the future.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Version 1.08 of the EA released. In this version an input is added in order to let the user set net stop loss in money (0 disables stoploss). I updated Post 1.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
i tested your ea but not opening trade in Backtest . i am attaching my martingle ea test  Reports

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Yes good one. I switched to H1 and started trading

--- 帖子 #38 ---
very good ea for live thank

--- 帖子 #39 ---
I don't understand why its not opening any trades? It's been over 24 hours now. It did before then, then just it just stopped.

DDL is checked. Everything is as it should be.

Its on the H1 GBPUSD. The new setting for tick or open price doesn't seem to be doing anything.

Anyone else having these problems?

--- 帖子 #40 ---
you share your ea ex4 format may you share source code as a mql4 format i want to chang it a little bit , i guess it will work very well

--- 帖子 #41 ---
working well for me

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Hello Math,

Since the robot start most of the times very well we could introduce a Terminate EA at reached daily profit targhet and then get the robot to start again at specific time 00:00.

This will allow to reduce the chance to have a total loss of capital at some point in the future.

Regards

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Yes, it is the way the most experienced short-time traders do.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Hi Mathtrader, I wanted to compliment you for your expert.....i catch the post also for ask the following think: is it possible to include into EA a checking news controller to reduce drawdown, especially when starting with little deposit? I think to change only distance between orders, could not be enough!

Thanke you

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Hello there, greal robot, i love it so much, so how i can trade this robot with my real account??

Thanks

--- 帖子 #46 ---
hi mathtrader

Thanks for great system.

To use your default setting as safely, what is the minimum deposit required?

thanks

--- 帖子 #47 ---
This mean, after download your robot and i can use it for my real account?

minimum about 1000$

--- 帖子 #48 ---
I am testing this with a $50 account, you can check it out on my profile!

--- 帖子 #49 ---
I was wondering about that too, i hope the awnser is yes and that its risk free but gains steady profit with low-no drawdown!

Got my eye on this question and EA!

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Hi there,

I put the EA on EUR/USD yesterday, and no trade have done.

I think everything is ok.

Can you help, plz

--- 帖子 #51 ---
MathTrader7 would you consider to add this option in the next EA release?Regards.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Version 1.15 of the EA released. In this version an input is added in order to let the user set net daily profit in money (0 disables this feature). I updated Post 1.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
We can use the EA on a real account?

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Yes, you can do it at your own risk.

Thx

I try on a demo. But open 0 trades . Can You plz check my settings?

Thx

Hi mathtrader7

Thanks you for your ra, works fine so far.

Just wondering how to use 'max marti(0-unlimited)' properly in ea setting.

Can you give some advice?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Hi mathtrader7

This EA can be used for micro account?

Is the currency of the symbol with a suffix?

thanks.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Hi! MathTrader!

Thank you for an interesting system!

Please explain the meaning of the parameters

Net TP (money) 20

Net SL (money) 0?

What is 20? The % of depo, or $?

Thx...

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Net TP (Money) ..... no doubt is Money ! I use this EA - and the settings are clear ! Got already first this 20 $ TP !

--- 帖子 #60 ---
This EA can be used for micro account? Yes

Is the currency of the symbol with a suffix? Yes

--- 帖子 #61 ---
They are in your account currency. For example, if you have opened a trading account in Euro, Net TP = 20 means a net take profit of 20 Euro, etc.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Give a range of 0 to 8 with 1 step to this parameter in the optimization and see the difference.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Do you use the default settings?

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Since I have no resources on my VPS, could I ask some trader to run this EA on a demo account and create a trade explorer?

Best,

Math

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Thx, for all!

For those who prefer to trade manually.

My script for the system of dimdel's "Green/Red" strategy, but with MathTrader7 rules.

It's open, so you can add martin or others mods.

Throw on the chart above or below the price.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
MathTrader7:

The EA is looking good.    Please consider adding one input that controls Candle Range.

For example:

If(CandleRange>60) StopTrading=true;

The EA would sttop trading and allow the current trades to close at 0 profit, or the user can close them

The EA would reactivate either manually (user restarting EA) or when the start time comes up.

I have found this to be useful for when price starts to become volatile.   So far I have seen this work on the lower TFs.

It has not failed to stop the EA from trading when the pair is ranging crazy and thereby avoid the potential loss.

No hurry, whenever you can get around to it is fine.

Take care and thank you for your coding effort

Jess

--- 帖子 #67 ---
This may be a good filter. I'll implement and test it in the next versions.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
candle range is pointless, adds no extra benefit.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
FXCyborg, what is based on? Can you explain in depth why it shouldn't?

--- 帖子 #70 ---
FXCyborg:

The candle range refers to size of the current candle. I have found that when you are trading as long as the candles sizes or price movements are relatively stable that is little volatility, that you can trade thru it successfully. However, then there comes that moment that all hell breaks loose and price goes all over the place like crazy and forms huge candles. So what is the best thing to do? STOP TRADING and wait for the mess to calm down. You do this by monitoring the current size of the candle and if it is larger than what you expect, you stop the EA from trading immediately and start to close trades for 0$ or small loss. In my case I have seen on EURUSD on the 15min that 60 pips is a considerable size.

It's a simple observation...

Jess

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Here is the trade explorer.

I run it on a different settings:

MaxMarti=0

LotSize=0.01

--- 帖子 #72 ---
The Net TP in Money, should that be closing out the value in profit? I have it set to 20.0 but when the trade doesn't close at TP when it gets to $20....

--- 帖子 #73 ---
i know you are, and it defeats the purpose, it dont matter what the candle size is.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Thanks! I added your Trade Explorer to this thread.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Hi Dasani ! I see your trading isn't limited to EURUSD - so, which pairs do you use ?

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Version 1.16 of the EA released. In this version an input is added in order to let the user select the check of take profit mode at only open prices/every tick.​ I updated Post 1.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
dear Math7

again you done it. amazing EA ! i did some basic BT and find that a grid of 200 is pretty safe (relatively) for normal trading ,even for USDCAD which can be a bitch sometimes when it trends , UJ, GU, UC, EU , so far all went thru quite well with it.

thank for your hardwork. appreciate it

--- 帖子 #78 ---
You're welcome! :-)

And thanks for your feedback!

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Only on USDCAD at the moment. First 3 trades were opened for testing purposes

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Okay I see the problem, it's when a buy/sell is triggered and then a strong trend happens in the opposite direction you get a huge drawdown..Perhaps an option would be to switch the next martingale position in the direction of the previous candle?  That way if we get a sell positioned open and then the candles after become bullish the next position would be a buy position, or alternatively the option to close the current position and open a new trade in the new direction.

Another option could be a filter such as a look at the weekly and only take trades in that direction or a moving average possibly....

--- 帖子 #81 ---
@Dasani: It's a pity - your account in the TE above is running bad ! What happend ? So is where any reason choosing only the USDCAD pair alone ? Why didn't you choose the EURUSD ?

--- 帖子 #82 ---
I support that filter very much thanks for the suggestion, i hope a new version is out very soon with it.

It makes sense because yesterday is was profiting so well on USDJPY then a spike came and it help on to the trade so it pretty much blew the account  haha, was getting 1 and 2 dollar profits then bang a 42 loss!

--- 帖子 #83 ---
And i don't see a sl option on this ea unless its hidden because at least if we will have rare drawdowns like that we can minimize them!

--- 帖子 #84 ---
I think another option is to have a stop loss on the previous candle high/low.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Candle triggered grid system

Thought about a hedge option?

If price goes against you after the first grid direction is active, then activate opposite direction grid to trap price and benefit during DDs.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Version 1.17 of the EA released. In this version I fixed a few bugs and updated Post 1.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
It is a Martindale... my tp is 20 and sl is 70 as I mentioned previously. I want to run it for about 3 months and then add another pair. I chose this pair because in the first topic testings were done on that pair.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
I think it would be better to run the EA on EURUSD,H1.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Ok, as I come from vacation I will run an optimization and put it on eurusd then also.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Great!

--- 帖子 #91 ---
seem like good result, do you mind sharing your .set file

--- 帖子 #92 ---
I started the test of this EA too. I use more conservative setttings. The TF is H4. The v 1.08 is running actually EURUSD only. The v 1.17 works with EURUSD + USDJPY. All in all it's a real slow trader for me, using my TF + setfile.

https://www.myfxbook.com/members/AGT...-h4-gp/1733798

https://www.myfxbook.com/members/AGT...-h4-gp/1712104

(The v 1.17 started at 03.08.2016 only, before the start of Mathtraders EA another EA was tested at the platform, will switch the start date after first closed trades taken with the MT7 EA)

@MathTrader7 - could you possibly make a BT of the 2 setfiles I use ? If you have time for this ....

--- 帖子 #93 ---
I am back test. Because I dont see the version .v 1.08 ?

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Right mate ! The older versions are abandoned here in the thread .... will attach this EA v 1.08 asap here in this post !

--- 帖子 #95 ---
OK thanks. I will back test

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Version 1.25 of the EA released. In this version the entry logic has been improved and the user can set Martingale multiplier (between 1.0 to 2.0). I updated Post1.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Can we add an option to trail the profit after reaching some target profit

Trail start profit;5(As dollars)

Trail amount;1(As dollars)

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Good idea!

--- 帖子 #99 ---
@MathTrader7: make the same backtest with the Multiplier 1.481

--- 帖子 #100 ---
2.0 seems to work the best!

--- 帖子 #101 ---
@MT7: Providing the BTs - did you try a lot of other parameters ? So the question is: are your BT results here posted even the optimized to use for us beta testers ? So no need to use other params and run the forward tests only with H1-TF/params similar (or even identical ?) to yours ?

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Hi,sitetalker

I created this EA already, we can look at its trading results...

https://www.mql5.com/zh/signals/214673

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Hi MathTrader7,

nice work with the EA!

I am not a coder and I love the ability of this EA to recover from bad trades in a relative safe manner and that it has an emergency stop build in.

My question is, if it would be much work to omit the self-entering trades of this EA (as an option).

Meaning, I want to enter trades on my own according to my own rules and if they go the wrong way, the EA can take over in the same manner as it does now.

Basically just a recovery EA that recovers my initial trades in the same flexible manner as this EA already does.

I don't want to high-jack this thread, but it might be of value to others who have their own system and just want a smart recovery EA.

Keep up the good work!

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Martingale is for people who can't read charts...   People who never want to be wrong..

Works great till you get that one huge move that never comes back and just keeps going and going for years.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
I totally agree with bloodpoodle.

I have never seen a martingale EA which is profitable on the long term. You will always end up losing your money!

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Hi Silicus,

This EA has its own entry logic. In the future I may create an EA to manage a manually opened position as you mentioned.

Best,

Math

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Hail to you brother!

Marvelous... Amazing!!

I actually DONT believe in EA in the 1st place & Martingale I NEVER EVER would trust!!!

From the first moment I saw this EA with Martingale I thought It would be another waste of time...

Then I bactested your EA with my own way... & then It proved itself in EURUSD

OK... then I thought you may be somehow "Curve fitted" with EURUSD from 2010 to 2016 therefore, backtesting in EURUSD pair is a waste

Then, I checked with other pair as well....

Amazing!!! Awesome....

Your EA now... very close to PERFECTION!

Keep going on brother.... We are all with you

--- 帖子 #108 ---
"NOTE 1: Martingale based EAs are very risky! Use this EA at your own risk." MEANING DON'T USE LIVE!!!

Most I would do is use it to enter demo contest.

Very similar to the Matrix Grid Trader CE thread by Googletrader http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=518257.. We tried everything you guys are about to. May do some good to read up on some of the ideas there.

To bad it ended up a commercial venture for him to rope some suckers. You will see how it fizzled and died in the last few pages of the thread.

I have tried many of these and they all have the same fault. The runaway trend change

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Regarding these negative notes raised by BillyYon. Shouldn't deviate the attention on this thread. No matter what happened with your experience and if the EA didn't work for you, here Math and others are trying to improve an idea and positive support is welcome.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Math, what about introducing lot entry based on equity. As the win trades grow the equity the lot increase in relationship with it.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
@archishard

Cool down bro ! All we have to do is dealing with facts ! And "BillYon" wrote about an important fact: all the grid + marti strategies are very very risky in trend markets .... so, yes, he is right, never forget about this. I saw grid Trader EAs doing well for many months ... almost a year things went so great, so beautiful, so right - I thought already I'll be a millionaire soon ... until that day crashing the account ! No offense mate - be careful, but you never know ....

--- 帖子 #112 ---
What I wrote is very positive.

The very first "note" is a quote from Math himself on page 1 "NOTE 1: Martingale based EAs are very risky! Use this EA at your own risk."

Math fully understands the high probability account blow with this. I mean 50%+ DDs come on bro? Only gamblers allow that. You would likely pass out at 30% loss.

I also pointed out a very similar thread with ideas to research. Did you even check it out?

What's that saying about a fool and his money???

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Good evening, the AVG period5 parameter , what does it mean? what kind of parameter is?

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Hi DerBerliner,

I didn't examine each and every possible set of values for the input parameters. However, I would use the settings shown in the backtest results on Post 1 to test the EA on EURUSD,H1 and on a demo account.

Best,

Math

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Here was one idea for trend change from the other thread

[+] MultiLotsFactor_TrendChange - When trend changed, EA will increase lots to close grid as soon as possible.

http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...02#post7984202

That EA was basically the same. Only difference was entry trigger. You will notice at trend change muti lot fact increased bringing dynamic target closer for a possible quick exit.

Hey all,

Danke for the thread and EA, MathTrader7.

I've found this thread (and EA of course) interesting and ran some tests on my own...

I don't quite see this kind of return around and made around 4x the amount on my tests from 1st November>1st August. 1000>4710 usd.

I'm not able to run longer tests, so if someone wants to keep on testing this with my setings....here they are.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Nice, do you havea .set file you can share with us!?

--- 帖子 #119 ---
@tillionaire

Ummm ....

Dude, look above man - he posted his setfile showing the BT results !

--- 帖子 #120 ---
As DerBerliner said, my setings are up there.

The thing is, I can't save a file that is accepted by FF when I try to upload it...maybe because I'm running MT4 on a MAC...

Backtest with Hetzerim's settings from 2013.01.01 with $3k deposit.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Thanks!

Not good, but I'll give you another settings soon that I think is more reliable.

Still my test was made on 1H.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
As I mentioned in Post 1, the EA works the best on H1/D1 time frames. M1 time frame is not recommended for this EA.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
What about H4 ? Did you test only H1 + D1 ? H4 isn't a good TF following your BTs ?

If so - I must stop my actual tests and switch to the most suitable for me TF D1.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Thanks!

In this case it would be practical to incorporate the time-frame in the settings, so the most accurate "M1" method can be used for backtests.

I haven't tested on H4 charts, but it might be a good time frame for this EA. I personally prefer to test the EA on H1.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
You're welcome!

You don't need to test the EA on M1 time frame to have the most accurate results. When you run an EA on H1 (or any higher time frame) the strategy tester automatically uses the M1 data to test the EA.

Do you use Martingale in live trading?? Whenever I see a martingale strategy, I see margin calls!

I honestly "believe" that this strategy is a bad idea no matter how it is implemented..

I appreciate your development skills and efforts in all cases.. Just wanted to give the heads-up..

Cheers and here is wishing amazing luck..

--- 帖子 #129 ---
I used to use Martingale with my breakout EA on my live account successfully. The EA of this thread is under development and experimental. As I mentioned in Post 1, it is very risky to use this EA.

Best,

The backtest was performed in Control Points, not Every Tick mode. When you are backtesting in Control Points mode, there is no tick to model. So, there is no meaning of the ticks modeling quality.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
@armyda .... can you predict the future ?

OK bro .... a pair ABCXYZ was during a distinct time "ranging" ... hmm that was a good time for this EA/strategy .... BUT you understand: we never ever know in this crazy FX world what will happen tomorrow - you know ?

--- 帖子 #149 ---
I would like to highlight that the Dollar value of the Max. DD - shown in backtests - needs more attention.

As the below screenshot shows the deposit was $5000 while the max. DD was $6731, so the account was saved from crash just because the balance has significantly grown by profits when the max. DD had occured.

Should the backtest started on the day of Max. DD, the account would have been crashed immediately.

i dont predict the future but if a pair is gone in many years  in some way in the past there are good chances that the pair continue to go the same way

AUD/CHF, CAD/CHF, NZD/CAD, NZD/CHF also test pretty well with this EA. Like someone said earlier, the more range the better.  Increasing the grid size and lowering the marti muliplier to 1.25-1.50 also helps reduce the drawdown. Reduces the profits a bit also, but you can withstand more levels. But since its a martingale it is never completely safe from destruction. I ran a bunch of test with multiplier at 1.25. It acts almost like a grid trader at that point.

Guys for those of you that are using the strategy tester for one year. You're doing it wrong.

Its best to test these in groups of three years.. 2008 - 2010, then 2011 - 2013, then 2014 - 2016, then one final one for the entire range.

And to get good data, use Duscopy's feed.

@FXCyborg

Just a brief remark: Capital Trust Markets was a licenced and regulated broker in NZ and in 2015 its owner has taken off with $500k+ clients funds...

NZ authorities did NOTHING about it as the owner is a Canadian citizen... Canada did nothing as it happened in New Zealand...

So in my world broker "regulations" mean nothing (except for UK and USA)...

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Well, thats New Zealand, everything is relaxed over there, they dont give a rats arse.

It wouldnt of happened in Australia though

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Patterns, what patterns is it looking for? what happened to the - if previous candle is a bear, go short and vise versa....

any way to have a boolean switch to turn it off to resort back to the original?

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Version 1.45 of the EA released. In this version the user can select the entry logic from four different types:Follow Previous Candle. A position will be opened in the direction of the previous candle. Trade Bollinger Bands. A position will be opened when the candle is closed above/below BB bands. Trade Reverse Candle. A position will be opened when the last candle is closed in the opposite direction of its previous candle. Pattern Type I. A position will be opened when a valid Japanese candle stick pattern is formed. I updated Post 1.

Another important factor is the possibility of applying hedge muliple after 4 or 5 or 6 position martingale

example:

trade sell :

1 trade sell EURUSD at 1.1150 0.01  (Grid size 100)

2 trade sell (Martingale) at 1.1160 0.01

....

5 trade sell (Martingle) at 1.1190 0.04

6 trade buy (Hedge) at 1.1200 0,08 (Hedge multiple 2)

....

Hi armyda ! Great to see your BTs ! But what about some forward tests ? Although I'm personally not convinced of the use of grid trading + marti (!) at TFs like M1 or M15 you got good results. I would say even incredible results.

That's amazing and honestly to say I didn't expect results like yours.

So how do these settings do the job in forward demos ?

offcourse 100 euros test was a play

i think that this EA is optimized  for 5000 euros and over

--- 帖子 #257 ---
in real this afternoon

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Well, I am not so sure about the "incredible" part.

Deposit: $100
Max. DD: -$273

In other words: the DD is 2.7x larger than the deposit...

The crash was avoided simply because this large DD happened in the later part of the backtest (around trade #205 which was sometime in 2015) when the accumulated profits allowed such a big DD.

So if the backtest had been started in 2015 the P&L graph would have ended in a vertical line.

Conclusion: the absolute max. DD should be always related to the initial deposit (in %) when fixed lots are used as this number is NOT shown on the backtest reports.

Please when I update a version, you could put the version it is, ejem:

MT7_CandleMarting EA V.1.45

Many thanks

--- 帖子 #271 ---
From the testing I have done on this, I can give you a general overview of the setting.

More profit and more risk: Small grid size (Under 50 pips), small time frame (less than H1), larger TP , larger multipler (1.7 or higher)

Less profit and less risk: larger grid size (over 50 pips), longer time frame (H1-D1), Smaller TP,  smaller multipler (1.1-1.5)

Takes about 10 minutes to test a years worth of data so run a bunch and you will get the feel for what each setting does. I prefer the smaller multipliers (1.1-1.3) and H! time frame.. Much less draw down. Less profit also but some times not all that much less. Keep in mind too that seeing 25% drawdown on the tester might not look that bad. But if you were trading live you would feel much different about that.

- don't trade this system with M1

- trade with minimum M15 or H1 or D1 (Caution: don't trade with M1 or M5)

- don't trade under 45 Pips (450) with EURUSD prefer 55 Pips (550)

- trade only EURUSD or EURCHF or USDCHF

- don't trade other pairs is dangerous

@MT7

Hi mate !

I have to admit some observations.

I use the v 1.45 at two MT4 platforms – GP (Global Prime) 51 + 52:
https://www.myfxbook.com/members/AGT...-h4-gp/1742395
https://www.myfxbook.com/members/AGT...-h4-gp/1742409

Although the setfiles for both tests are very similar the results + EA behaviour is quite different ? That’s a bit confusing me.

(I use 25k plus all pairs only to get a full picture of the pairs behaviour at a demo – that’s not for my real live trading).

The settings are included into the zip file.

Furthermore I’m impressed/surprised about the results of armyda’s BTs …. To good to be true ? Grid trading with (light) marti at the TF M1 ???  It seems the bot is doing the job with nearly all pairs – almost every of the BTs is ending up with pretty good gains running them for years even …. ? Ummm … I never ever would expect things like these working !

Anyway … the numerous BTs in the thread look intriguing enough to me, so I decided to start at coming Monday another test at M1 with all the pairs at a 25k account to see what will happen.
https://www.myfxbook.com/members/AGT...-h4-gp/1743644
https://www.myfxbook.com/members/AGT...-h4-gp/1743646

Honestly to say not sure about this M1 test … looks a bit strange and very uncommonly. Could open a TE in FF.com in the case of some successful + hopeful developments of the test accounts in a few days.

And yes, a last comment: I’m wondering about the two older test accounts with v 1.08 plus 1.17 – they do so far a nice job. I haven’t a clue about the nature + severity of the bugs and improvements you made after these versions. But I would like to continue these 2 tests with former versions ? Makes that sense or is it completely useless ? Will severe bugs in the code kill the accounts sooner or later in any case ?

Hello DerBerliner,

In Version 1.45 the user can select different trade logic. You may run two instances of the EA with different trade logic?

At the current state of the EA I won't use this EA on any time frame lower than H1. But it doesn't mean that people should not examine its performance on lower time frames. I'll follow your trade explorers.

In general it is strongly recommended not to use old versions because I always improve and fix buges in the last version.

Best,

Math

--- 帖子 #308 ---
I checked the platforms anew: both are running with trade logic "Follow Previous Candle" ?  So ist the same logic for both.

But the trading behaviour is very different ..... strange result ....

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Did you run them at the same time? Because at different time the last candle to follow may be bullish or bearish.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Dear mathtrader7,

What is top/dow period? How can i setup it?

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Hi Berliner

my experiences with these EA are:

the best setting is pattern type 1

The best Tf for me is 1M because H1 give few tades if you put multipl 1.1 in fact if you see the Math setting in H1 he uses multipli 1.7\1.9(too risky for me)

with 5000 euros account i set 50 TP pips and 0.01lots with 10.000 50 TP pips and 0.02 lots

i tryed with AUDCAD and the resuts are very good (i dont know why)(you can see my tests) i tryed EUR and GBP also but they are very risky

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Random entry?

It looks to me the lower the relative price, the greater the possiblity that price goes up.

By looking back on weekly charts and fi using a MA, one can for every instrument find a moment where an entry will be more succesfull.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
My point is just, bringing in some statistics good improve results.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
hi Guys

Ive tried to load the EA on to my chart but nothing happens except freezing my charts and an annoying BONG noise.

i have downloaded the file from page 1 and copied and pasted it into the Data File/ MQL4 / Experts, closed the chart then reloaded it as expected.....but when I try to load it onto my demo account all I get is that annoying BONG noise and freezing of my chart. I have already tried turning off my Virus scanner, but this makes no difference.

Does anyone have any help for me.???????

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Version 1.49 of the EA released (I updated Post 1). In this version the user can set the EA to move the first position's stoploss to breakeven, and a new trade logic based on moving average is added (see the description for Trade Over MA in Post 1).

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Nice additions Math. What is the MA "distance" mean? Is that the distance the current price is from the MA value?

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Yes!

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Incorporating dynamic (i.e. balance adjusted) initial lot sizing as an option would help to eliminate "false positive" backest results.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
if possible put a lot sizing and an antimartingale and a stoploss at 2% should be the maximum

--- 帖子 #320 ---
hi Math

let leave the matingale ;in a long period is toxic

because your system is winning(pattern 1 ) put a margin capital at 2% and a lot sizing inside an antimartingale

when the system wins the lots grows when the system looses the lots reduce

here a elementary example

this system was used by Larry Willyams

--- 帖子 #321 ---
good very good but.......

the gain is poor

need a TURBO!!! a sizing system with antimartingale

grow if win

reduce if loose

--- 帖子 #322 ---
I've download and tested just yesterday on every tick the previous version of the ea from 2000 to 2016 on m15 and the results were quite positive, around 145.000 USD profit from a 10K USD account.

I downloaded and tested again the new version of the EA on the same period and TF and I just got 11.079 USD profit...it is a big difference...I using the same values as yesterday, using Pattern Type 1.

Did you change something important on the EA to make this big gap on the profit?

Thanks.

Hi MathTrader and many thanks for this expert!

Could you explain better how this move to breakeven works?

I see that we can set the target and stop in money. It could be useful to set them in % of account...

Thank you again!

--- 帖子 #327 ---
I'll update Post 1 regarding the input settings.

This is a good suggestion. I will implement it in the next versions.

The fact is that I BT the previous version just on control points.

I did the same with the new version just to compare. Move to Breakeven is enabled in both BT.

duskcopy program

--- 帖子 #332 ---
You mean Dukascopy? Dukascopy has Jforex, not metatrader...are you converting the EA to Jforex?

--- 帖子 #333 ---
history data of MT4 are not good

Duskascopy is very good and works very well with MT4

--- 帖子 #334 ---
I have tested your ea and I now run it on a demo account. Personally I'm looking for a setup where you can start with a low balance (maximum 1000 ) and manage to make 3-5 times the initial deposit and withdraw before the ea lose all money, then deposit another 1000 again and start over. ( I have succesfully used martingale system like this before )

I have a few recommendations for next version, based on the moments I saw the EA is ussually losing all balance:

- first of all I have found 5 min charts to work much better than 1H. If you use control points for testing you will be very far from real market conditions while testing

- you should introduce more working hours options for the EA. In all testes I got better returns and lower DD at night, avoiding the high volatility during news release. But now I can set working hours lets say from 0 to 10.00 but can't restart it same day let's say from 18.00 to 23.59 after most euro news are gone

- When EA is paused because of working hours settings it should close all positions no matter if they are winning or losing

- when you setup a maximum number of opened positions  sometimes the ea will close all positions on loss. Somehow it does not calculcate the overall P/L right.

- you should remove the limitation of 1 to 2 martingale ( for example I have succesfully used a system with x3 lot multiplier )

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Hi Mathtrader7,

in further versions I would like to see a trade logic based on MA-Crosses (SMA,EMA,LWMA).

Thanks for your brilliant work !

Regards, Thomas

--- 帖子 #339 ---
I see the EA will end like all EA's here with 15 - 25 Indicators and 200 settings and TF M1 up to D1
and will not more work profitable

--- 帖子 #340 ---
I am been testing the various version and I see that could be interesting to introduce Lot based on % of Equity. As the profit grow the EA will trade higher Lots.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Ya you are right.... every time every EA always end up same way... sooner or later

Version 1.51 of the EA released (I updated Post 1). In this version the EA finds the previously opened positions. However, the EA does not automatically detect the grid size, you need to make sure that the grid size of the previously opened positions is the same as the grid size of the current settings of the EA.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Nice!

--- 帖子 #356 ---
3 mouse clicks and you can do this now. Open EA properties/change starting lot value/ close EA. Done. This does not need to be coded. Let him program what we cant do already.

Very well thanks

@math

Can you do a description about single line of expert propiety thanks

--- 帖子 #358 ---
This is not find a perfect entry EA. Its more of a grid/recovery EA. Any indicators are only good for the first entry any way. Adding more will only pollute the thread, cause Math aggravation and confuse the crap out of everyone else. Ill second the thought of less is better.

Entry does not really matter from BT's I have done. Sometimes follow last candle performed best, sometimes MA was best. All depends on when you started the test and how long it ran. If you forward test it would be the same. There are 4 settings to really concern yourself with: Grid size/Net TP value/mart. multiplier/time frame. How you configure those 4 will determine if you make it or break it. The rest is just window dressing. I have not tested BE yet so cant comment on that one. My guess is it might save some DD but decrease profit.

Ok thanks!

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Hy,

just have a question.

If you don't set a hard SL, when does the EA closes the trade when it goes into minus? If you leave the settings as they are.

D.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Hi!

I've been testing this EA in the "open price mode" and it always profitable in the 4H TF, sometimes even with 500 bucks...of course there is a bigger risk there, but it works.

The point here seams to be the settings (duh...) for me never less then 2000usd and never more then 0.01lots. 4H TF is the best. All the rest is you.

Here is an example: 100% in a year...

--- 帖子 #372 ---
When the net (total) profit of all open positions goes below minus the value the user have set for Net SL (money), the EA closes all the open positions.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
@Hatzerim

Hi mate ! Yes, to trust one's guts - the H4 seems to me the best TF from the same beginning of the tests !

Concerning your BTs - what about other pairs ?

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Version 1.55 of the EA released (I updated Post 1). In this version the user can set the EA to close all the open positions based on an exponential decay of profit target with respect to the number of positions. There is now two first-trade time intervals to set. And finally the Martingale multiplier can be set up to 3.0.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Hallo!

Yes, I've test it on several pairs...even exoctics! I've found that GBPUSD gives the worst return... This EA seams to be better ($) pairs that have AUD, NZD, JPY included.

PS Berlin ist geil!

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Ummm

Man ! You got with GBPUSD in a year 100% !! What are the better pairs doing

They give more than 100s% ? The DDs are ... ?

--- 帖子 #377 ---
In all of those strategy tests the SL is 0 and the TP is 10 for example. So when does the EA closes the trade there? When the TP is -10?

The net SL I found and use already, I was just wondering about those tests?

D.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
When SL is set to zero, the EA closes all the open positions when the target profit is reached.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Until Dynamic Lot sizing becomes available I suggest all testers to set NET SL (money) = Initial Deposit.

It will assure that "lucky timing" of the backtest would not give misleadingly nice - i.e. self-deceiving - profit curves.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
please for me but i think for all is important to see your setting

thanks

--- 帖子 #381 ---
I have attached the settings file (zip file) to Post 1.

There is no error, my test was performed from 2010.01.08 up to 2016.06.30. Yours uses a different start and end dates for the backtest. Besides, it is MARTINGALE! There is no guarantee that any input settings makes the EA to be profitable all the time.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
I'm out! It does not compute here...

--- 帖子 #386 ---
sorry but i have to tell some thing

your EA without martingale  is a profit system or not?

have been testing this EA on my demo for past few days, really like the results so far.   I have been using similar strategy with an EA that I enter a buy/sell price and then it builds recovery positions based on settings.

it seems this EA always adds positions at 10 pips below/above the previous.  is this something in the setting that can be changed ?   let's say I want the 2nd position to open at 15 pips or 25 pips after first.  can I do this or is it always 10 ?

thanks to MathTrader for all the hard work.

Hi All!

I know there are many M threads around and Ive been sticked in for few years in them since Martingale arrive.. I have lost a lot with it. Not only money..

I really appreciate the progress it makes in years. Mathtrader does fantastic work here. Im pretty sure that most of you knows exactly whats going on by Martingale. However I need to copy a conclusion of nick named Gary for every newbie here. Those few sentences convinced me to stop waste my time with Martingale. Having said that let to be known that there are fundmanagers and big players who use M in some scenarios.

There are a zillion ways you could play the numbers, Let us know if you find a miracle Martingale. From my experiments, my conclusions are: A Martingale will not turn a losing system into a winner, unless you NEVER hit the blow-up case. In a normal situation where you occasionally hit the bail-out level, the Martingale usually loses significantly worse than the basic non-M system. If the system is a random coin-flip, the Martingale results will also be random. Sometimes better, sometimes worse. If the system is a winner, a Martingale will increase the profits, but you have all the Martingale problems. You can achieve similar returns just by increasing your position size, and you will have fixed known risks, a more consistent and sane equity curve, and no worry of a Martingale blowup. If you have a high-win% system, your chances of long strings of losses are reduced (but NOT eliminated). E.g. for a system that wins 70% of its trades, the chance of N consecutive losses is (1-70%)^N; the chance of 7 consecutive losses is 0.30^7 = 0.022%. If you can survive 6 consecutive losses, you have only 1 chance in 4500 of blowing up with 7 losses. But remember those 21 consecutive losses with 50% wins... If you never blow up, your closed-equity curve is a beautiful straight line. But once again with that 70% system you could get about the same results just by increasing your position size by about 1.7x, and you have none of the Martingale risks. Bailing after a few consecutive losses results in smaller blowup losses, but the blowups happen more often. Bailing after more consecutive losses causes fewer blowup losses, but they're bigger. The end result tends to be similar even though the equity curves may look very different. If you're lucky, you won't hit many blowups, and you'll make more money than without the Martingale. If you're NOT lucky, you may hit a lot of blowups, and you'll lose far more than you would have without the Martingale. If you're like me, the Trading Gods will guarantee you see the latter result, and the Martingale will kill you. Therefore: I conclude that Martingale Mania is a will-o-the-wisp, a fantasy. Martingales hugely increase your risks without providing any benefit. Martingales won't help you unless your system is already a winner, and if your system is a winner, a Martingale is a bad way to increase its returns.

Just Say No to Martingales."

You have done a great job so far with the CM EA.

End 1 Minute (0-59) 0

Use Time Filter 2? true

Start 2 Hour (0-23) 18

Start 2 Minute (0-59) 0

End 2 Hour (0-23) 23

End 2 Minute (0-59) 59

other way are bullshits

without offense but il my opinion

--- 帖子 #431 ---
My backtests are all about testing the operation (not the profitability) of the last version of the EA. Using Open Prices Only, Control Points, fake every tick, or even real ticks for backtests do not imply the profitability of the EA in the future. So, bullshit is bullshit!

--- 帖子 #432 ---
- much traders don't understand the difference between backtest and live trading or forward test

Thank you

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Thanks for the update and the new trading option "2MA cross".

At the moment I do not know how to handle the setting for the "2MA cross".

Maybe the following setting is possible to include to the EA:

fast MA period:

fast MA method: simple/exponential/smoothed/linear weighted

slow MA period:

slow MA method: simple/...

It would be great to put this in one of the following updates... take time, we are patient and

we enjoy your work !! Thomas

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Your statement implies that most traders are retarded. The difference is quite obvious and I think everybody here understands the inequality of live trading and backtesting. However, if you know a better and faster way to test the potential of an EA, you are more than welcome to share.

I started testing this EA on demo late last week .. using 6 or 7 pairs .. currently up 16% on the account .. I am using mostly 1 hour time frame starting with lot size of .03  .. still playing with settings and trying to understand what some of the values do.

MT .. latest version has no settings for comments.  It looks like the EA is using the previous order number as a comment .. any way to modify comments in the future ?

I really like this strategy so far .. thanks for all of your hard work and time answering questions.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
The EA uses the order comment to create something like "linked list in C" to be able to find previously opened the basket of orders.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
If I set Net SL (money) = 50.0  ..  it will close all orders if my positions are $ -50.00 on that pair ?

I don't lose my time (neither my money), I have my own profitable trading systems.

Hi MT .. couple of questions .. I looked through but couldn't find answer .

1.  what is anti martingdale mean in the settings ?

2.  if I have a trade opened on a 1 hour time frame and i'm looking at chart and change time frame to say 30 min .. how does this impact what the EA is doing.  will it just continue to work the trade that was opened normally ?   can it potentially open another trade based on 30 min time frame ?

thanks

Hi blade813,

1. Anti-martingale (or reverse Martingale) is a strategy to add to winners (unlike add to losers strategy of Martingale). When you enable this input setting, then after the first position is opened, if price goes in the profit zone, the EA will open additional positions with the same lot sequencing (and grid size) and at the same time of opening a new additional position, it adjusts the stop losses such that if price reverses and hits the stop losses, the overall profit of the positions will be positive.

2. If you change the time frame, then depending on what trade logic has been set in the input settings, the EA applies that logic on the new time frame while it keeps track of the previously opened positions on H1 chart.

Best,

Math

remember that statistically what is appened in the past can appens with good probability in the future.

Otherwise why that didnt work in the past should work in the future?

ah i undestood

you flip the coin

if is righ you win  and take the money if you flip wrong side  you loose and regive your money

is not important the  martingale but importand to have an  winner idea where you put your martingale(for me antimartingale)

Hi MT7,

I set antimartingale param to yes, the system sold once, then the price raise and it sold again at the grid distance... It seems it doesn't work properly the antimartingale param... or am I wrong?

Please find attached my settings for your system. Have to rename to .txt, don't know why...

Thank you for the time you spend with us!

Version 1.64 of the EA released with minor bug fixes. I updated Post 1.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
just an observation after reading through this thread -- not intended for anyone in particular

it seems many want to jump on the "martingdale will blow your account" bandwagon here.  while I do agree that a true strategy like that could indeed blow your account, so will many other kinds of bad trading strategies.  if you don't use good money management, and don't have some sort of viable strategy, you probably will eventually lose all of your money, no matter how you trade.

so rather looking at this as a true "martingdale" strategy, think of it as a multiple entry strategy which many successful traders use.  I traded with Boris Schlossberg's group for awhile and the foundation of the strategy was taking multiple entries if price moved against you.  There are many variations used by many traders.  Some using only 2 or 3 levels, some using 6 or 7.  Its all about money management.  You use the available settings to determine how many levels you want to go, how much of your capital you want to risk, ect.

MathTrader has created an EA that allows you to customize the strategy to your own liking.  He's not selling it.  He's not asking you to subscribe for a fee.  He's taking his own time and experimenting with many scenarios to see what works best.  Rather than question the back testing results, put the EA on a demo account and test it.  Pretend its your real money and trade it how you would if it was real.  Experiment with different settings, different pairs, different time frames, ect.  If there is a bug, point it out.  If your settings/pairs aren't successful, point it out.  if you think a new feature will improve the EA, make a suggestion.  We can all learn from each other.  If you think this strategy is a waste of time or too risky for your liking, move along to a new thread.

I started testing this myself a little over a week ago.  the demo account i'm using is up over 15%,  trading mostly low volatility pairs that tend to range during the day.  these are the perfect pairs for this strategy.  they typically move up and down in a fairly tight range.  can they take off in one direction at any time?  of course.  money management.

don't be greedy.  if your first position is down 20 pips,  and you open a 2nd position that moves 20 pips,  your first position is breakeven and 2nd is +20 .  take the money and run, start again.  may not seem like a lot, but doing it over and over will add up.  be smart when you trade.  obviously you don't want to be in front of major news, central bank statements, ect.  let the market calm down, then take advantage of the range.

special thanks to MathTrader for the time put into the EA and answering questions.  also thanks to those who have made great suggestions that have found their way into the EA.  keep positive and help each other.  good luck to all

Hi blade813,

Thanks for your support! I agree with each and every word of you.

Hi MathTrader7: I can't find the zip file with the settings for the newest version ?

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Hi Blade, I agree with you.

I think that trading with this kind of strategies implies 2 questions:

- the level of drawdown a trader can sustain (for instance let's say 20% drawdown?)

- the time you need to recover this drawdown with the profit you have for every cycle.

Let's say I've been hit with a 20% drawdown on a cycle. If the strategy usually gives me a 0.5% daily gain (remember, don't be greedy).

I will need around 2 months to recover the drawdown and return to the equity peak.

I can reduce the available max drawdown, but I will obviously obtain an higher amount of stops hitted.

To me, it's all to find the right balance with max drawdown and daily profit.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
Thank you. Exactly my thoughts and you worded it perfectly. The EA is only a tool. No one throws an EA on a chart and comes back in a year to to collect their 100% gain. It just doesnt work that way. Those that think it does, will need to find another EA. Your search may be long. People see martingale and discount it as garbage right off.  That is true of a Marti that doubles at every trade. But with very safe settings this is more like a grid trading/recovery EA and if configured right, with the right pairs the martingale aspect of the EA may never kick in or only rarely kick in. Like Blade says, money management, use your brain and dont blindly follow any EA.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
That is not how the EA works. Its not meant to recover stopped out losses. If you are using stop losses then you will never recover. It is designed to ride out down periods using the grid and your martingale multiplier settings. When the price turns your equity recovers. If price does not turn enough to recover than its see ya at margin call... Can it be configured and controlled to be close to safe and maybe tradeable? Yes I think it can. Only forward testing will tell for sure. Even then it could still blow your account at some point, no promises in life.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Hi math..good ea ..very interested...can i use ea on real?any expired date?regard math

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Yes, I had this point.

You can decide to trade without stop only for a small amount of your balance (with a dedicated account), otherwise it's a no sense to trade for a living in this way.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
just wondering,  would it be possible when the initial trade is opened, to write out the time frame and the signal type into the comment section .. switching around several pairs on different accounts I seem to get mixed up which type of trade is running sometimes.

you dont need to  write pair in comment  just need to write (Magic Number + TimeFrame)  if possible ( signal type and pair already known, but Magic and TF  not

You're welcome! :-)

You do it right! Using an EA is not like "fire and forget", especially a Martingale based EA. The user needs to manage the situation. Avoid high impact news, close all open positions in small profit or loss when he/she feels the market is strongly going against the strategy, etc.

Have green pips!

--- 帖子 #486 ---
First I want to say thanks to MathTrader7 for his great work

Here is, how I use and try  the EA at the moment (I know not everybody ist fan of martingale): I initialised a demo account with 100 EUR, installed the EA on three pairs and let them run the whole day. At night I withdraw all the money above 100.- EUR, so that my accounts starts the next day again with 100.- EUR. Of course I also risk a complete loss of my account during the day.

Here are the results:

1. day:   33.- EUR withdrawn

2. day:   31.- EUR

3. day:   21.- EUR

4. day:   41.- EUR

5. day:   16.- EUR

today:    16.- EUR (until now)

(in sum 158.- EUR withdrawn in six days)

So, my maximum risk is 100.- EUR (the day) and the average profit per day is up to now 26.- EUR.

The success for this account management depends on how often the EA will blow up the account. We will see.

Next week I decided to spend 100.- EUR in a real account and look what happened.

Nice weekend to all

Hi,

I still run the EA 1.51 (never change a running system - at least for now). And I use the set- recommendation from andres11617 (post #426) on EURGBP, USDCAD and GBPUSD (perhaps I will add AUDCAD) on TF M30.

My broker is Activtrades and for timezone I'm coming from Munich.

The martingale factor is 1.7, so I start with 0.01, than 0.01 0.02 0.04 0.08 0.14 .... afterwards it becomes critical with margin!

Best regards and much success

Very good result. I create a demo account where U are. I simulate it from 19 aug. Great results. Then I set another simulation with 100EUR but I lost it. What did I wrong?

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Hi MathTrader7,

I am trading ma-crosses manually most of the time and for that reason I am convinced

that it would be a nice try to give the opportunity to set the fast and slow period MA also as SMA, EMA or LWMA.

I surely can understand that you do not want to overload your very nice ea; maybe it is an idea to separate

the ma-cross trading style into a whole new EA. So thanks again for your support, even on the weekend !!

how we can correct this D.D

--- 帖子 #507 ---
1. Use currency pairs with low ADR values (for example, EURUSD).

2. Increase grid size (200 points seems to be good).

3. Adjust your TP target with the initial lot size.

4. Try to find the best time of trade using the two time filters of the EA ( trading after NY closes until a few hours before London opens).

5. Do not use the EA like "Fire & Forget"! Manage the open positions.

I'm thinking of a high impact news filter implementation in the next versions. Such filter may reduce D.D of the EA.

--- 帖子 #508 ---

I realised that as longer is the TF, better are the results...

What is the maximum relative drawdown recommended to have a stable strategy using this EA? Im testing it on ticks year by year using D1 (testing it from many years -like from 2000 to 201- it doesnt have sense, because once the equity its growing the chances of blowing the account are decreasing) and I didnt blow an account yet, but some years Im getting a DD of 66%, but it happened when equity has grown.

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Great work, MathTrader7.

Have you considered changing directions instead of martingaling against the trend (Close and Reverse)?

For example, if the TP and SL were 40 pips - if price moves against you, open a new trade in the opposite direction. In my backtesting this strategy yields a lower amount of consecutive losses in nearly any situation.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
i will do backtest with great pleasure!!!

--- 帖子 #522 ---
The default setting of intial lot size is 0.3. For a 5000USD account and martingale method, is it too much.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
The amount of risk is user dependent.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
MT7, could you please clarify once again "exponential basket close"

Thank you, andres

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Thanks for asking this question, I forgot to explain it in the first post.

If the user set the input parameter "Exponential Basket Close?" to "Yes", then the EA closes all the open position at a lower target profit as an exponential function of the number of open positions. For example, if there are 7 open positions, and the take profit is set to 20.0 USD, then the EA will close all the seven positions if their net profit reach at a lower profit than 20.0 (let's say 3.0 USD). This option is there to test the idea of getting out of a sequence of losers with some smaller profit as soon as possible (that is, before blowing up the account).

--- 帖子 #526 ---
If you want to stop and reverse, why would you use a martingale EA? Its 2 different strategies. There are other EA's out there that will do that for you. This is not one of them.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Dear MT7

I have just backtested with your EA from 01/06/2016 - 31/08/2016. There have alot of big event EXP NFP, FOMC, Brexit hand Yellen spoke.

With GU, EU --> It's not good, my acc go up from 300 u ---> 1200 U, after that my acc drop to 30 U

With AU, UCAD ---> It's ok, so i was funny with this result, from 300 --> 1100 U and not drop

I think EA is good for: AU, UCAD. But this EA must test alot, matingle is very risk.

Thanks for your good EA

Thanks for your sharing

You wrote: "I think EA is good for: AU, UCAD."

I think the correct formulation is:  "I think EA was good for: AU, UCAD." Why ? You never know what will happen tomorrow in this crazy FX market ....a so called "calm" pair may jump up and down bcz of any fucking news. Yes, formerly it could have been making a pretty good Job for months in your (grid) EA .... right ! You thought already about beeing a millionaire soon .... but unfortunately the rags-to-riches story didn't happen !

OK, sr for my english is not good. But The EA of MT7 is good EA for free

i backtested this EA with a lot of big event from 01/06/2016 - 31/08/2016 with AU pair and this EA not to die, not drop and got a big profit. Do you think that is very lucky

So with real account. You can't trade with EA all time. this is very risky. Avoid big new

I will test this EA alots before I trade with real acc

Backtest is not enough, do also some forward testing on demo account. bear in mind the result of backtest, forward testing, and live account will not be the same.

Nevertheless this is a good EA that can survive most of the times with an account of USD 5000 in major pairs with initial lot size 0.01 but of course with a slow profit.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
LOL, no its not...

Fact of matter is, you cant do this on a $100 on a standard account... needs to be a micro account...

secondly, there is nothing wrong with this EA... it works just fine.

The guy you quoted, he did his strategy tester wrong...

2001 - 2003 .... 2004 - 2006 .... 2007 - 2009.... 2010 - 2012 - 2013 - 2015... you gotta do the strategy tester in groups of 3 years and see how it performs...

one you find an average setting that works on all, do the entire set of years from 2001 - current date...

OR if you really have the time... put the optimizer on it... sit back for a week or two for it to finish... then simulate the settings that show good results, then put it on those grouped up set of years above...

It takes time, but its the only way to determine if a bot will work.

I put the time in, and just shared the results (settings) for you - You're welcome

It was supposed to be fixed in a version before 1.45 though. and i wasnt worried about what version, just stating whats going on. cos if its not fixed when it was said it was fixed, and it still does it, will still have the bug in the latest version.

To have a clear picture: Is that the same for the Versions higher than 1.45 ? Or is this bug now obliterated ?

Detecting open positions implemented in Version 1.55+.

why you trade with so a "old" version with bugs? In the version 1.64 is all OK

I have closed and update the MT4 and all is well. The orders active like bevor close

BrainstormingI am currently implementing high impact news filter into the EA, and it works just fine. Now that the EA knows about the upcoming high impact news on the currencies of the pair that it trades on, which strategy do you think is the best to take advantage of this filter? Please share your idea and reasoning behind it.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
the highest number is the newest version  go not backwards

@MathTrader7: my idea is 30 minutes until high impact news change the TF to H4 (H1) and 60 minutes since news change back

so the EA make not so much orders (I trade with H1 and is good to change to H4) I trade with this Idea since 5 years with my

EA's (I trade my own EA with M15 and change for the high impact news to H1 and back to M15)

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Silly man.. let me explain again.

before version 1.45, i raised this concern, i was told it was attended to. But I guess our wires got crossed somewhere, as he fixed the disconnection issue to track open trades... just not when the trading station is shut down.... but like he said, it was done in 1.55, there was no need for me to get a higher version since i was told it was all sorted out, as i have no interest in the other methods, the previous candle one does the job just fine.

Thank you...

Hi, MathTrader7

The EA does not open any order by backtest using tick data. But it works well while not using tick data.

Is there any problem?

Hi, working on H1 chart?

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Sorry if this is a bit noob.

But wouldn't it be better when the first multiplier order is opened the previous order is closed.

This way you are not stacking your losses/drawdown with each level.

Not sure if would even be possible in an EA.

i can see that you wont be able to set a specific money value as take profit only a set pip take profit on each trade.

eg.

.01 open

.02 open .01 closed

etc etc..

The most common TF here is H1 ! But someone tried H4 as well.

(I personally would just prefer H4 .... didn't had any trades so far at my demo running the daily TF)

little profit but regular

Math did is et up well the time filter ? cause i do it manually when it stopped at 23:59. the EA stay on trade disabled.

--- 帖子 #605 ---
maybe you need to review again the TP and SL level? TP $2 vs SL $150? even if all went smoothly you need 75 wins and 1 lost to be BE.

V1.7 is okay with default setting but yes, you need to see the most profitable setting in the lot size and TP.

let say with capital $5K, lot size 0.01 will run safely in major pairs but if you use tp in money $100 it will bring a slow profit.

the important one is to find the good combination between lot size and TP in money according to your equity.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
The draw down is really magnificent, not even half a percent!!!

--- 帖子 #607 ---
totally agree with you on that, risk management is a must.

Here is an update of my post #555

I renewed 5 demos (GP 38,39,50,51,52) - I used at these demos older versions of the bot (lower then 1.55 !).

Restarted the 5 platforms: all with 1.70, H1, all pairs (25k account), it's a test of 5 "Trade Signal Types" (MA crossing/Pattern I/Pattern II/Randomly/Prev. Candle). Setfiles in detail are again included in the attached folder.

- and don't work on M1 with Martingale

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Hi folks.. I'm back.. lol.

MathTrader7 how you doing?  Looks like the EA is shaping up well, I see good results.  I started testing it on a live account.  No worries the live account is small and that means that I have alot more to gain than to lose .

Anyhow, Like Pandagang, I do not see the time filter working.  I set my times and select the input to use Filter1=true but no trade is executed.  I am using just the hours and have them set to start hour:19   end hour:6.  I also tried this in the strat tester and same result no trades for that period.  Please advise

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Hello xmess7,

Please note that End Hour must be LOWER than Start Hour, other wise the EA won't take any trade.

For example, if you want to set the EA to work from 19:00 to 06:00 in your broker's time, you have to enable both time filters as below:

Use Time Filter 1? Yes

Start 1 Hour (0-23) = 19

Start 1 Minute (0-59) = 0

End 1 Hour (0-23) = 23

End 1 Minute (0-59) = 59

Use Time Filter 2? Yes

Start 2 Hour (0-23) = 0

Start 2 Minute (0-59) = 0

End 2 Hour (0-23) = 6

End 2 Minute (0-59) = 0

Best,

Math

Version 1.72 of the EA released (I updated Post 1). In this version there is a separate grid size input parameter for the anti-martingale functionality. The backtest is based on Bollinger Bands and the input settings is attached to this post.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
what does it mean the variable Top/Down Period? in what sense it opening a position?

--- 帖子 #626 ---
I just did a few BT using your setting on M30 EURUSD within a 90% modelling quality.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
My backtests are just to test the functionality of the EA, not to make it holy grail! There is no guarantee that the settings would be profitable.

--- 帖子 #628 ---
I´m not criticizing your EA or your EA settings. I´m just posting the results that I´ve got using the last version and the last setting that you have posted.

--- 帖子 #629 ---
sometimes backtest doesnt mean anything, even forward test using demo account may not reflect how the EA works in real account.

if you really want to know how it works you need to test in real account with small deposit, like $100 in cent account.

and like MathTrader said, dont expect holy grail in forex, at some point EA will fail because the market condition change.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
So if the BT doesn´t mean anything, what´s the point of doing it? Or if sometimes it means anything and sometimes don´t, how do you separate the times that it means and the times that it doesn´t?

BT with a high quality modelling is the only way to test if a EA works or not. You will need years of real cent account testing to decide if the EA it worth to invest a nice amount of money.

To be clear, I´m not expecting the holy grail from this EA or from any other, and I never criticized Mathtrader work.  I´m just posting the results of the EA with a 90% modelling quality, nothing else than that.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
@ibermex

Ok, ok ... bro you showed us "the results of the EA with a 90% modelling quality, nothing else than that." Nice to have them !

So now you may start your forward tests .... demo or live what ever you want mate !!! Do it ... or leave it it's your choice ... so: no offense - noone will force you to use this EA !

Btw you in person wrote it right: "BT with a high quality modelling is the only way to test if a EA works or not .... "

--- 帖子 #632 ---
So now it´s wrong updating the BT results? LOL.

As I said you will need years in demo or real to prove that any EA works in long term periods...I won´t do it until I get a good result in BT testing it from many years...so no offense, you may start posting your BT results as well.

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Noob question, please teach me.

I keep doing BTs, some do wonderfully and many others go bust right at the end, why?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #634 ---
That's funny

Model quality dont really matter... BT just gives u an idea of how it will perform.

Run the ST, find a setting it comes up with, then back test it from year 2001 in groups of 3 years... then run it for the entire span of years to current date.. what ever setting it gives you for your lot sizes, or what ever, reduce it.. then forward test it.

I did over 4 weeks of BT, now im live, and up 4.1k now, just doing 0.03 lots at 100$ TP

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Hi Cyborg

Would you please show your result and your deposit to up 4.1 k

I think If we based on BT with N/a or 59,58% (My BT result) modern quality it's not good

I agree with @ Ibermex.

Beside BT to test how the EA work. We must test result of EA for a long time

+ Modern quality >90% good MT4 data, BT EA for good result ---> This EA for sell ^^

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Hi Mathtrader,

Today there was a high impact news release for USD (ISM Manufacturing PMI) but the news was not scheduled to be released during the EA's time filter. I guess that you have disabled the time filter and let the EA (v1.75) run during the release time of red news.

Running my Demos for test purposes with all pairs I saw today the baskets for GBPCAD, GBPJPY, GBPNZD closed in red ! The number of possible pairs in the demos is high to see what will happen during different market conditions. Max. trade number is limited to 8 - after 8 trades the baskets were closed with losses.

Yes, yeh, I know just the GBP pairs are wildest today ... bla bla bla .... I don't believe all these smart-alec comments, bcz today the XYZABC pairs is "wild" - tomorrow following some effing news the fucking ABCXYZ pairs is "wild" .

Ok ... may be by trend some pairs tend less or more to jumping trends then others, but in any case we can't predict the future ... so, tomorrow a so called calm pair may run away in one direction only coming back after weeks or months even ...

So how to avoid these losses ? Any advice ? Any ideas ?

@MathTrader7

Thank you for all your hard work, much appreciated!

I don't know how close/far this idea is to what you already did, but please find below my dream Martingale idea. (poorly written)

Strategy 1

Open any trade if ADX is above a certain level (25 for example)

TP? = open new trade in same direction. (Trailing stop possible?)

SL? = open new trade in the opposite direction.

Strategy 2

Regular martingale (same direction in case of loss) if ADX is below 15 with high volatility, measured by standard deviation for example.

No trading in case of big news.

Please let me know if I can do this with the existing settings, thanks!

--- 帖子 #668 ---
As far as I understood from your explanation, this cannot be done with the current state of the EA.

here is a short note about my 100EUR live account test (you find my settings in my last post):

The current balance is still 100EUR, and I withdrew during the week

Monday 16.50 EUR

Tuesday 25.50 EUR

Wednesday 28.50 EUR

Thursday 40.00 EUR

Friday 28.00 EUR

I made a little change yesterday: I start with 0.02 lot and decrease my margingale factor to 1.25. (in tests I got better results).

(you can folow my tests here: https://www.myfxbook.com/members/sie...-candle/819644)

nice weekend

this is all what you need

- I trade with 2 x 3 Charts EU EF UF on TimeFrame H1

- I trade with 2 x 3 different settings = EU EF UF with MA Cross / EU EF UF with Bollinger Bands

- SL 0 TP with 0.1 Lot = EU 15 EF 12 UF 15 with 0.2 Lot EU 22 EF 18 UF 22

- InpMartMult = 1.481

- InpMaxMarti = 8

- Gridsize: EU 15 Pips (150) EF 12 Pips (120) UF 15 Pips (150)

Hi Ghostniker,

Thanks a lot for your help.

I would like to know a bit more about your setting to try to have as good results as you:

- Do you use Time filter?

- Do you use Exponential basket close?

- Do you use the Anti martingale?

- What is your Martingale multiplier?

- Do you use the Breakeven option?

- What is your BB period and deviation?

- What is the MA period and distance?

What version of the EA are you using?

How are you 100% sure that with your settings your account will not blow up?

Thanks, thanks and THANKS!!

Regards,

Version 1.86 of the EA released (I updated Post 1).

- Max. Daily Profit input parameter was removed.

- Checking TP at open prices was removed. Now the EA only checks TP at every tick.

- Checkng price to open a Martingale position will only perform at every tick (at only open prices option was removed).

- A bug in anti-martingale function fixed.

--- 帖子 #692 ---
- Do you use Time filter? yes: 1:15 - 5:45 and 7:15 - 17:15 GMT

- Do you use Exponential basket close? NO

- Do you use the Anti martingale? NO

- What is your Martingale multiplier? 1.481

- Do you use the Breakeven option? NO

- What is your BB period and deviation? standart

- What is the MA period and distance? standart

What version of the EA are you using? yes version 1.64

How are you 100% sure that with your settings your account will not blow up? yes but you must
every day control the ATR for the Gridsize and change. Higher ATR is higher Gridsize. By red news
delete the Automatic or change to a higher Timeframe example from H1 to H4. Stay out from
Timeframe M1 up to M30. Trade only EU EF UF / don't trade CAD, GBP JPY pairs

- the new versions are to much settings for me, I'm a trader and developer, not a progger, I don'
understand what all the settings do. It is to complicated for me
- now exactly 186 different settings is a blackbox for me, I change one what make the others?

--- 帖子 #693 ---
thank you for posting your results. could upload your version of the EA? (v1.51)

Cheers

--- 帖子 #694 ---
@MathTrader: when set the orders with the new version? Every tick or candle open/close ?

Every tick open the orders it is easier for blow the account and the TF to trade is equal

M1 or H4 is then the same effect

--- 帖子 #695 ---
At open of a new candle the first trade will be placed if the conditions of the selected strategy are met.

--- 帖子 #696 ---
@MathTrader: thank you, yes this is clear and the following orders (Martingale) by every tick (like Gridsize)

or by new candle (larger then Gridsize) ?

--- 帖子 #697 ---
I Agree with you..i like open order with open price candle..is very safety..and first signal candle according minimum body size candlestick..

--- 帖子 #698 ---
yes it is clear come new orders like Gridsize with every tick and the priceline move 150 Pips in 15 Minutes

by Gridsize 10 Pips (100) then is the account blow, because Grid sent 15 Orders !!

If I trade in H1 come 1 Order by new orders by candle close, this is safe for me

--- 帖子 #699 ---
You're welcome!

The following orders (Martingale) will be opened by checking the price at every tick.

--- 帖子 #702 ---
Good job sir..

--- 帖子 #703 ---
@MathTrader: you can work dynamic grid over % from ATR (every last 8 hour)

- minimum Gridsize example 25 Pips

- dynamic Grid size in % from ATR example 30 % and dynamic TP in % from Gridsize

--- 帖子 #704 ---
You can attach a file *.set ? Please.

--- 帖子 #705 ---
@Mathtrader

thanks for all the updates !

But let me say one thing, please:

I believe opening the martingale trades by every tick is a very dangerous option;

also without the option opening new trades via open prices it is much more difficult to work with backtests,

so please think about to give us back the option open trades via open prices.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
This seems to be a good idea!

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Thanks, I test your set in GU acount break 10k

It is very aggressive.. Caution

​Hi MathTrader7.

​I have one account with 50$ which is not so important for me. Can I trade with your EA? Is it profitable on live account?

​​Thank you.

--- 帖子 #711 ---
Hello,

There is no guarantee that the EA would be profitable, especially on accounts with small deposits. Martingale based EAs are very risky! However, some people take the risk and use it on their live accounts with a regular withdrawing policy. So, you yourself need to decide whether taking the risk of using the EA on your live account.

Best,

Math

Here are my settings.

Some of them are running on a real-account with success until now.

But I do not use the newest version of the EA, just older one's, because

in my settings trades are just opened with "open price", not on "every tick".

Version 1.90 of the EA released (I updated Post 1).

- Trade based on patterns removed.

- Trade based on reverse candle removed.

- An input added to let the user choose whether the EA must close all the open positions if the number of positions exceeds the maximum Martingale positions, or leave all the positions open.

- Bug fixes.

GB, Sir,

If you could explain possibly with some examples the 2 items you suggested in post 710:
-Yes but you must every day control the ATR for the Gridsize and change. Higher ATR is higher Gridsize.
-By red news delete the Automatic or change to a higher TF example from H1 to H4

Regards,

--- 帖子 #754 ---
- ADR = Daily Range = Hi / Low of this day on this moment, example EURUSD yet for today 122 ADR

go with the GridSize to 22 Pips (220)

- TimeFrame = example TimeFrame H1 to Change the TimeFrame to H4 over the news

I reorganized my test demo earlier posted in #555 + #696 completely. Bcz I use now only the recently posted v 1.90 this test looks now more consistent. Nearly all demos are at TF H1. Have one H4 + D1 platform. For now I test all pairs - even the CHFs - at an exemplary 50k account.

The setfiles are attached.

- you must understand the settings and what the settings do, not only the setfile

- you must understand what a ExpertAdvisor do with the settings

- I have written all settings I have change

I do not see the indicator ADR 18 pips in eurusd

You can by a mark please?

try to understand

--- 帖子 #776 ---
- 18 is not the ADR

- 18 (180) is the GridSize for EU and UF for this EA from MathTrader

- by EU and UF round 20% - 25% from ADR

- by EF round 30% - 35% from ADR

after few hours after the news today you can go back to EU and UF 15 Pips (150) and EF 12 Pips (120)

--- 帖子 #777 ---
Yes, we see that EUR/USD  - ADR  78  , so the question would be how you decide to make gridSize 18 for E/U ?

how did you counting to make the right ADR for each pair ?

--- 帖子 #778 ---
Hi @Gb,

you are right, for a long living account the settings are not good. But I test the EA with a small account with daily withdrawals and the risk of a blow up. Until now I'm content with the results. More money moved to my second account then paid in. Let's see what will happen in future. Btw it is m30.

@ghostbiker, thanks about sharing your settings and above all your thoughts. It helps me a lot. And I understand, that the setting is not a fixed part, at least, if you trade a bigger account (for my test with a small account of 100 Euro I use a fixed one at present, but I also think about to change it daily).

I'm not sure, the 1.64 is the last version with order by open candle?

MathTrader7:

Question.  How does the EA handle taking profit after it has reached the end time and it disables it's self from trading?

So far on 2 occasion, I have seen the EA close all trades with a very small loss.  Is this expected and what do u recommend we set in our inputs to control this.    Just don't want to see one day that small loss become a somewhat bigger one .

I am using EA version 1.7 and here are some of the key settings:

Use-AntiMartingale?=Yes

Exponential Basket Close?=No

GridSize=170

Net TP(money)=0

Check TakeProfit at =Every Tick

and of course I have set start and end times.

Please advice

Jess

--- 帖子 #792 ---
I mean 1.71 is the last version with Candle open orders

- the ADR Indicator is a special custom Indicator, is in function and free only on my own accounts

- yes I control every day the Gridsize for update

--- 帖子 #793 ---
in v1.75 there is option you need if I am correct?

--- 帖子 #794 ---
HI xmess7,

If it happened in the backtest, then I guess you have set the mode to Control Points.

If it happened in live/demo forward test, then there must be a quick jump of price after the EA calculated the net profit to be greater than zero. There is no way to completely avoid this problem if price changes against our favorite direction at the time of closing the basket of orders.

Best,

Math

--- 帖子 #795 ---
Thnx for the quick reply.  Its a live account.

One possible way is to add a buffer that is one commission above 0 profit (for brokers with commission) and a say 0.3 pips for brokers with no commission.

So basically the EA would not just look for  >0 profit but also a small buffer, thereby raising the probability of no loss escape.

No worries, just suggestions, I will just have to live with very occasional 20 to 23 cent loses LOL

In reality when that does happen that is good cause that means that the EA is done for the day and all former profit is protected... well except  FREAKIN 20 cents LOL      just joking..

Peace

-Potential Issue

if Martingale Multiplayer is set to 1.0 . and TP is High and you using 1H charts or higher it can be devastating. even by using 0.01 lots.

if EA will enter on start of new trend in the oposite direction it will wipe the account .

the possible solution is using Martingale Multiplayer more than 1.0

--- 帖子 #803 ---
It seems to be a good idea

--- 帖子 #804 ---
Thank you for your kindness. I hope I will add my inputs to add strength to this post.

--- 帖子 #805 ---
Thank you for set file

I will try to check and post my set files maybe max by tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #806 ---
It's not, trust me - I have designed and extensively tested EAs very similar to what you are doing here.

Increasing distance between grid entries makes it worse, not better - do not waste your time with this idea.

--- 帖子 #807 ---
Have you tried decreasing distance ?

--- 帖子 #808 ---
I work with increasing Gridsize since 6 years and this work sure and very well

--- 帖子 #809 ---
Yes, but that is an extremely tricky proposition - it can either work very well, or can wipe your account. Problem is - one cannot foresee the future therefore, one cannot say how many times the distance will decrease, eventually your martingale series will start increasing very quickly

Bottom line, equi-distance seems to be simplest and most reliable

HI guys!

Is any body can share  M1 timeframe settings for small account?

Thanks for your help!

cheers

--- 帖子 #811 ---
DO NOT DO M1, tust me! It will blow your account up sooner or later 5M is the best.

Just my advice its up to you

--- 帖子 #812 ---
Thank you for your advice I'll trust you Have you got any good settings for share?

cheers!

Version 1.92 of the EA released (I updated Post 1).

- Dynamic grid size based on daily ATR added.

- Bug fixes.

--- 帖子 #814 ---
Great job.

In this version the martingale work at tick?  It is possible we choise to open position on next Candle?  Our have a delay from the last order?

Thx

--- 帖子 #815 ---
No problem brother, i will try to provide you with a .set, but i am very busy right now so you will have to wait just a little

I dont just want to give you a useless one that doesn't work.

________________________________________________________________________________

I coded a new ea and am still updating it to improve upon it on a daily basis. It gives a minimum of 30% per day to your account, and i am currently looking for a volunteer to load 100-150 test dollars! Very very low risk the maximum drawdown is 6%, and you will be able to keep all the profits to yourself and withdraw them.

*The EA will have an expiring license so do not try to steal it or do anything...

Thanks, have a nice day traders

--- 帖子 #816 ---
Yes.
They are all possible but not in this version.

Hello,

First of all, thanks to MathTrader7. I've been following this thread while learning how to code for cAlgo, so here is the code for the cBot version of this EA. I have no intention of keep working on this cBot so I'm publishing the code for anyone to work on it.

Features

-MA Entry

-Dynamic Grid

-Trade Hours (ghostbiker trading hours)

-Minimum margin level stop

Thank you, MathTrader7 for this interesting EA. I started following a while ago. Below you will find the results of a quick backtest of V6 with the standard settings (the settings you used in your backtest do not work for me) on EURUSD (timeframe H1) from 01.01.2016 to 09.09.2016. It looks promising!

Good morning.

I ask myself, which pairs are the best for this strategy? Above all, WHY do you think a pair is good or not?

@GB, you told, that you use EF and UF. Which are the reasons for you? For me and my small-account-test, all CHF pairs have the disadvantage of a higher margin demand....

Hi GhostBiker,

Witch version are you using? Open position on tick our open candle?

Thx for your time, keep the good jog

--- 帖子 #830 ---
- NO tick is dangerous, I trade only by close/open candle (I use Version 1.64)

example by tick: you have 15 Pips GridSize, the price move 150 Pips (after news) in 15 Minutes
you have now open 10 Orders it is dangerous

example by H1 and open new candle: you have only 1 or 2 new open orders

hello everyone .. been away on honeymoon in Europe for a couple of weeks so haven't been trading, eager to get back to using the strategy again.

I see the EA version is now 1.92 .. just curious as to what major changes have been added.

I don't see option to trade reverse candle anymore. Was this removed because of a defect or other reason. I think that is a good option to trade certain pairs that are in a trend and looking to enter after a retrace.

Thanks

Nice trading ghostbiker .

Are you closing orders manually or using a setting in the EA .. if so what are you using ?

--- 帖子 #837 ---
- no close manually, this evening (germany) I change the TP from 22 to 19 for 2 orders

no open orders for this night. Tomorrow come more move

--- 帖子 #838 ---
Hi traders,

I have been testing this method for the last three weeks in demo accounts. And I have experienced that the Martingala can blow up your account if the trend goes agains you enough time/pips (nothing new that we didn't know before).

I realized that a long trend with too small retracement can kill your account, because the martingala will open the same kind of order following the grid. In the picture below you will see the martingala opening 8 orders. Luckily the price went short before opening the 9th order, because the input Max Martingala was 8 for me. So, just few more pips and the account would have been seriously damanaged.

In order to avoid long trends killing my account, I thought of a possible solution: I would like to decide the kind of order that the martingala opens for every grid level. For example:

- 1) The EA opens a SELL order.

- 2) The price goes up and reaches the first grid: The martingala opens an order with double lots following the trend: BUY, instead of a second SELL.

- 3) If the price continues up, the EA takes the benefit and closes both. If the price goes down: The martingala opens a SELL order with triple lots.

By this way, even if we have many orders opened we would protect our DD by having a lot of floating positive and negative orders, not just negative order accumulating loses as in the tradicional martingala.

Another option is to tell the martingala to open the orders randomly for every grid level, or maybe open the orders following the previous candle colour...

What do you think of this modification? Is it possible to implement? Do you think it would reduce the DD as intended?

Thanks for your attention.

/Regards

@founoud: what Timeframe what pairs ?? your pic say me nothing !

--- 帖子 #840 ---
It will work ok as long as price does not bounce up and down in a range for extended time. Eventually you will need price to break out far enough to take a profit. If you are going to double the lot size on each order, your margin will be eaten up if the price sits in a range too long. Its also very easy to hit your max martingale of 8 doing it this way. Granted since you will be partially hedged your loss wont be as bad. So just like you cant handle steep trend with this EA, doing it your way you cant handle an extended ranging period. There is always a trade off, no magic bullets in forex.

--- 帖子 #841 ---
i think you set the tp in money too high, looking at the pic, the 7th order should close the cycle in profit.

and dont use the ea in cross-pairs, use only in major pairs.

--- 帖子 #842 ---
Version 1.93 of the EA released (I updated Post 1).

- An input parameter is added to let the user set a delay between Martingale orders.

- Bug fixes.

--- 帖子 #843 ---
@MathTrader, you write in Post #1 "End Hour must be LOWER than Start Hour, otherwise the EA won't take any trade!". I guess you mean HIGHER, not lower...

--- 帖子 #844 ---
Hi MathTrader7,

Many thanks for your effort on optimising the system. Extremely appreciate on it.

I saw the problem where like other forumer "founaud" mention on his the post 858: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...17#post9134817.

So if you can add the function for us to choose the next open martiangel position like: follow previous sell/buy, random, opposite position, then it will be the best!!

--- 帖子 #845 ---
Hi Ghostbiker,

The goal of the sreenshot was only to show that it is very easy to reach 8 martingala orders opened when openning against the major trend.

The pair was GBPUSD and M30.

--- 帖子 #846 ---
Hi Gugun555,

Tp was set to 5.0. A very low value. You are right regarding cross-pairs...  It was only an experiment where I wanted to know how easy was to reach the martingala orders limit.

Thanks for your advices!

You are right! I modified Post 1.

Hi MathTrader,

first of all I want to thank you for your work and for spending this EA to us !!!

I am looking to this EA since yesterday and of course there are many questions

The first one was just answered (EndHour LOWER StartHour).

Another one is: What happens when EndHour is reached? Will open tredes be closed?

Introduncing your EA with Post 1 and update Post 1 when changes are done is a very good idea. The problem for people like me who entered later is, that the changes made are written in the thread and not at Post 1. The options in the EA differ very much from the ones described in Post 1. Now I have to read the whole thread to find out, what which option is doing. Maybe it is possible to update Post 1 in that way that the options of the EA are described in one post so that the informations are not distributed through the whole thread; that would be nice.

Have a nice day!

Will it possible to turn the "Dynamic grid size" off in future version using one of the preset parameters?

As I mentioned elsewhere - it's not really a good strategy and my tests yesterday proved it again - static grid distance works best

--- 帖子 #854 ---
Hi again,

I am just trying to write down some more thought that potentially might help in the development of this EA or they could be totally wrong. Please help me to evaluate.
I would like to compare two possibilities for opening orders:
1) Opening new orders, always in the same direction (like now)
2) Opening new orders following the trend that touched the grid and make us open a new order.
I have made a small summary of what would happen if the market goes against us all the time (worst situation). In the first case the worst situation is a long trend without retracements, and in the second case the worst case is a ranging market.

Look at the picture below for the following examples:
In Case 1: after 8 martingala orders we have 0.2 lots in BUY direction.
In case 2: after 17 martingala orders we have 0.2 lots in BUY direction. (There are more lots opened, but they are hedging)

In Case 1; after 3 martingala orders we have 0,04 lots opened in BUY direction.
In case 2; after 10 martingala orders we have 0,04 lots opened in BUY direction.

If we consider Forex a theoretical random market, we will obviously reach Martingala levels 17 and 10 fewer times than Martingala levels 8 and 3. Thus, it is much safer to open the orders adapting to the trend.

@MathTrader7. I think it is worth to give it a try and test this new concept. Would it be possible to have an option in the EA to choose how we want the martingala to open the orders? First option) Orders opened always in the same direction (like now). Second option) Following the trend that made the martingala open a new order. (Like explained above)
Thanks for reading.

Appreciate your comment.
Regards

--- 帖子 #855 ---
@founoud: WHAT and how much is your Gridsize ?

--- 帖子 #856 ---
- What happens when EndHour is reached? Will open tredes be closed?

- If there is any open position the EA continues managing it (by opening new Martingale position, etc.), if there is no open position, the EA won't open a new position even if there exist a valid signal.

I will create an update log of the versions in Post 1.

Best,

Math

@Math . any progress on the news filter?

--- 帖子 #865 ---
Do you have a myfxbook account to see your live account performance?

What is the maximum number of orders that the martigala has opened in your account?

I think your live account would be much more protected agains Martingala blow ups if orders were opened following the trend, as I explain in mu previous post. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #866 ---
Please see this post.

--- 帖子 #867 ---
@fournoud: I think you are on the false way (your GridSize to small, your timeframe to low, your pairs are trending pairs)

- GridSize (25% of ADR)

- TimeFrame (orders by open candle is well)

- right pairs (not trending pairs)

today 4 orders closed + 0.9 % 4 open orders DD 1.2 % update GMT 15:20

--- 帖子 #868 ---
Thank you !!!

--- 帖子 #869 ---
No i dont put it in myfxbook, i think the maximum is 5 so far. I always look at the news, sometimes i stop the ea on red news. I use default setting, just modify the lot and tp in money.

I disagree with you, its better to have the wrong trade initially so the martingale will be activated, profit will run faster. If you always have the right trades, profit will move like snail.

--- 帖子 #870 ---
Hi Math,

I imagine that it could be useful to add another trade signal-type "manual" in order to start the ea by hand,

f.e. if you trade the pivot-points.

Maybe you can think about. Thanks for all your support.

--- 帖子 #871 ---
Hello,

The purpose of this EA is to automatically open, manage and close positions.

Best,

Math

--- 帖子 #872 ---
Hi Ghostbiker,

Thank you for your advices,

I am currently in a testing period, looking for the best parameters. I´m testing gridsize from 100 to 175, as well as timesframes M30 and H1. So far no important differences betweem them.

Regarding the pairs, USDCAD and EURGBP are giving me the worst results so far (they have been into a Martingala level 5 both of tem).

What are your setting for the latest EA v 1.92? Are you using it by any chance?

Let's continue bringing up ideas to optimize the robot!

Regards

--- 帖子 #873 ---
Hi,

Another example of how benefitial would be opening the orders according to the trend, and not waiting for the price to reverse (like now).

In the chart below the winning trade is Long 18 (Instead of double the minilots I used another hedge: 1,2,3,5,7,12,18)

The winning trade will have a total of 29 minilots (Long 1 + Long 3 + Long 7 + Long 18), and a total winning of 29 x 20 pips = 580 pips.

The lossing trades will have a total of 19 minilots (Short 2 + Short 5 + Short 12), and a total lossing of 19 x 30 = 570 pips.

Net gain: 10 pips.

If price exits the trend, we take gains inmediatly.

If price ranges between two grid levels, the negative equity of losing contracts is offset by the opposite hedge. The dradown is very well contained as I represented in the table of my previous post.

This is definitely a more conservative martingale that will help us containing the DD.

@MathTrader7, do you think is possible to add this option is the next version of the EA? I think we need to have an intrument to contain the DD in the EA, and this could be a solution.

Thanks all for your kind support,

Regards

USDCAD is a trending pair is NOT for Martingale and NOT with 10 Pips or 17 Pips GridSize

USDCAD had today 158 ATR only up up up with 10 Pips GridSize you blow your Acc in one day

what you test is for nothing and help nobody

will you make hedging with a Martingale EA then better not trade with this Martingale EA

example 0 x 0 = 0 / 500 Pips risk and 10 Pips win (or loss)  NO WAY

--- 帖子 #875 ---
hi founaud, imo the ea is already working very well. we should stop thinking about holy grail because such thing doesnt exist in fx.

i can say the ea will not blow your account if you run usd 10k mini account with 0.01 lot, but it may not worth the waiting times for the profit.

try to find your way how to work with current ea, even if you have 1k account mini account you still able to play safe.

Hi Math,  thanks again for all of the hard work and sharing this incredible EA

Couple of questions.  I have been playing around with version 1.64 trying to use the trade signal of "Trade Reverse Candle"  .. I noticed this type is no longer in the newer versions.  I have not been able to get a trade to fire using it.  Was there a bug and that's why it was removed or does it require a specific setting ?  Just curious as I think that would be a useful value.

Also, if a trade opens from a 15 min candle with Operation Mode set to "Open Prices" and Signal Type of Follow Previous Candle, and now price moves against me and I now have time frame set to 1 hour .. will new trade trigger at 15 minute mark as originally selected or will it wait until the 1 hour candle closes to trigger the next trade?

Thanks for your time,

blade

Hi Math,

Untill now 8% for the week , 10% for the month. With BB.

I think it should be very effective to use your EA with renko. I already use your multicharts renko ea.

I have tried it but it seems not to trigger any orders. I use the BBand also.

And the renko by itself is based on size... match very well with the grid system . anyway just my thought ...

Cheers

--- 帖子 #891 ---
sounds nice! would you share your set file? and which TF are you using on which pairs?

Cheers

--- 帖子 #892 ---
You're welcome! :-)

The option "Trade Reverse Candle" was removed due to bugs in its implementation. I may add this option later when the bug is fixed.

Yes, it will.

Hi pandagang,

I will test the EA on Renko charts later. It may be more profitable

Hi,

I have prepared an excel file that calculates how many orders our martingale EA supports before blowing up the account. It is very useful to determine the parameter Max Marti.

The input parameters that you need to provide (Upper left corner in the Excel sheet)

- Balance

- Number of pairs you are trading

- Grid size

- Martingale multiplier

The excel file will paint in green how many orders you can support with those inputs. Just change them and optimize your parameter!

(Take into account that it is based in an initial 0.1 lot. And also that the sheet will considered the worst case: All the pairs are going into the Max Marti at the same time. To change it, just write less "Number of pairs you are trading")

By the way, in paralel you will see the number of orders supported by the Martingale, but for the case of using a contained DD martingale.

Example:

Initial Balance: 1.000

Number of pair trading: 4

Grid size: 20 (200 points)

Martingala Mult: 1.5

Result:

Maximum number of Martingales: 6

Maximum number of Contained DD Martingales: 12

Hope you find it useful, and please consider implementing the option "Contained DD Martingale" in coming versions of the EA. It will reduce the risk of reaching Max Martin to less than half.

Thanks for your attention.

Regards

ghostbiker,

I have one question:

You use ARD of the last three days to calculate the Gridside ?

It´s correct ?

--- 帖子 #898 ---
yes this is correct !

- example: GA had ADR 163 x 25% I would trade with GridSize 40 Pips (400) for tomorrow (but I trade NOT GA)

--- 帖子 #899 ---
@gb, how do you exactly calculate the ADR, for example for the month?

And in older posts you prefer EU, UF and EF? You currently still use the same pairs? And which addition ones you could imagine, that they also could work?

--- 帖子 #900 ---
- monthly is the ADR from the last month the difference Hi / Lo (monthly Chart is one candle)

Hi guys,

I'm trying to understand the ea for the past few days and it would be very much helpful if I can get your advise on few doubts that I have.i just noticed the ea opened the second level on opposite side.please check the images..which parameters in the ea enabled this action? Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #906 ---
Hello all,

after reading about this EA the last days and watch it in demo I slowly start to understand what this EA is doing. I made a few backtests with the standard settings and EUR/USD to get a feeling about the expected results. I noticed that there is a big DD and that higher martingale levels are reached regularly (this means you need a lot of money to get over those phases). In standard setting the target is 3 Euro. I think in relation to this 3 Euro the DD and the money needed is too high. This means the settings must be improved.

So I have two questions to all of you:

1) Which pair(s) can be traded well with this EA, and which should not be used?

2) Is there a setfile that reduces DD and martingale levels bringing a better relation to the winning of 3 Euro?

Thanks to all, have a nice day!

--- 帖子 #907 ---
Hi..

i dont see the ea show any tp points in mt4 but close the positions when the most recent martingale level reach tp(money) that I set on the parameters window.lets say I set tp(money) as 5.0.what happens when I choose "close basket at max Marti" to no and let the positions float until they start to show profit?since there would be no tp points for the six positions,do I have to manually close each once they start to show profit or each position will close when they reach 5.0 target..

--- 帖子 #908 ---
Hi!

"Contained DD Martingale" can be the solution for big DD due to high Martingale levels, otherwise you need a high balance to survive high martingale levels.

Have you tried the excel file I posted before? There you can test how many martingale levels you can reach with your balance.

Regards

--- 帖子 #909 ---

Hi,

thanks for your answer.........now I have to find out what "Contained DD Martingale" means....my friend Go**le does not know.

--- 帖子 #913 ---
I believe (not 100%) the contained DD Martingale was a strategy based on hedging the trades to avoid increased losses if price goes in one direction for extended period of time.

This can't be done if you are on a USA broker however.

--- 帖子 #914 ---
Hi MathTrader7,

Attached you can find "Study Martingale v2". I have fixed a bug in the code, and added an extra feature.

You should now also indicate what is your maximum Leverage.

The Excel sheet will paint in green next to the Contained DD Martingale what is the maximum level you can reach according to your Leverage and balance.

The amount of Lots that you can play is normally more restrictive than your equity for the "DD Conservative Martingale". In case of the regular Martingale, it's the equity that usually kills your account.

Example:

Initial balance: 500

Number of pairs (considered for the worst case):2

Grid size: 150 points (15 pips)

Martingala Mult: 1,25

Max Leverage: 400

Result:

- With the regular Martingale we can reach a maximum of 9 levels.

- With the "DD conservative Martingale" we reach: Vertical limit (amount of lots): 19 levels. Horizontal limit (maximim cost/order): 30. So, we reach 19.

That means that using the DD Conservative Martingale we reach 19 levels, with the regular Martingale 9 levels. Huge difference.

@MathTrader7,

I think it's worth to try it. Do you think you can implement the DD Conservative Martingale as an option it in the next version of the EA?

Thanks,

Regards

--- 帖子 #915 ---
Hi ghost

What are yours tp?

Thx

--- 帖子 #916 ---
- TP in $ 22

- by 0.2 Lot

- now open 3 orders DD 0.15%

- 19 levels is grazy by a account of 500 $ and 2 pairs ?? and will blow every account

- if I will a "Conservative Martingale" then go to H1 or H4 reduce the lots 50%

- and the GridSize x 2

- and trade only with one pair, this is very very Conservative

- 19 levels hedging and then ?? You haven then 38 orders and then ? x 2 pairs = 76 open orders
close for 10 Pips ??

- hedging is not the key for Martingale

- the setting is the key not the EA + Martingale + Hedging

--- 帖子 #917 ---
Yes, it will blow up with the regular martingale. But never with the conservative martingale. The lots will hedge each other, so you can open many more levels. In previous post I explained how the DD Conservative Martingale works. It is a simple change...

What went wrong? Did I make a mistake? Why are all results identical?

Thnx Mathtrader for your wonderful EA and ghostbiker for your help so far!!!!

I allready testet the EA now for 2 Weeks (version 1.70) on a demoaccount and made about 3% in two weeks with 3 pairs (very conservative). I will go live in about 2 weeks .. hopefully successful.

I also thought about a way to improve the EA and two things came in my mind:

1. I wanted to ask if u are able to implement a automated Gridsize calculation like allready discussed in the Thread ((monthly+Weekly+DailyAdr)/3 ) ..... in the settings there should be a % input where i can say how much i want it to change from the base.... as example ADR calculated=80 ChangetoGrid%=20% resultGrid= 160

.... and if the currentADR is about 80% of the Adr calculated the Gridsize should go up a certain %tage for allready opened positions and  no new open orders in the same direction

2. to minimize the max DD i thought about to reduce the max. martingale (especially for news!!) .... to achive that the programm should always compare a percentage of the Gridsize(PIPS) with the Realpipchange in the 1 min chart ....... if its higher the grid should go higher as well for a certain percentage like 25% .... if this stage is broken the next level should also go higher with this percentage .... as a result it should be able to reduce the max. martingale or to withstand a higher Pipchange in a fast moving market

Sry for my bad english. Hope u understand what i mean and looking forward for your reply

P.S.: i am a noob so dont blame me if this are bad requests!!

Hi MathTrader7

I've been conducting research(back testing) on EA's that can can work on micro accounts.

Like $10 - $50 kinda micro accounts.

Throughout my research(and I have tested 50 or so EA's(for me thats a lot)) I have seen most EA's need a minimum of $1000.

If that minimum is not reached a OrderError 131 pops up in the journal.

I have read your previous replies stating the this EA does in fact work micro accounts.

But how?

What settings do you have use for this brilliant EA(from want are saying) to work on micro account?

For those looking to add ADR to their code, here is something I picked up on MQL5 forums - seems to be working correctly

Just include the function in your EA and do the calculation inside

Inserted Code double AverageRange(int TF,int length)
{
double sum=0;
int nBars=iBars(p_Symbol,TF);
int iLimit=length;
if(iLimit>nBars) iLimit=nBars;
for(int iPos=0; iPos<iLimit; iPos++)
{
double H=iHigh(p_Symbol,TF,iPos);
double L=iLow(p_Symbol,TF,iPos);
sum+=H-L;
}
return(NormalizeDouble((sum)/iLimit,1));
}

Sample of average calculation:

Inserted Code double d_Avg_ADR=(AverageRange(PERIOD_D1,3)+AverageRange(PERIOD_H4,3)+AverageRange(PERIOD_H1,3))/3;

hi ghost biker, fibo

@ghostbiker: what is dangerous if you can compare what you see on a picture without install the indicator ...??

here a live picture form my time 17:50 (UTC +1) ...here my calculation from your posts here :

last month: 320

last week : 134

yesterday: 73

SUMMARY: 527 / 3 = 175,66 so if we enter in my indicator 25% = around 43 pips GRID or not ??

thanks for compare

PS: is it possible that you not mean LAST WEEK, MONTH but rather "RUNNING" MONTH and WEEK for calculation ?????

--- 帖子 #990 ---
- right so, but you must set the Gridsize 43 Pips to 430 in the MathTraders EA

--- 帖子 #991 ---

Hi ghostbiker

This expert  ( MT7 Candle )should be  Run  on all charts  ?  Or The desired chart ?

it is possible .Little bit. How run

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1011 ---
its best to start with only a few pairs .. experiment with pairs, settings, time frame, ect to see what works best for you.

--- 帖子 #1012 ---
Hi blade813

What is your suggestion ? Which pairs ? Which time frame ? and  . . . .

Thanks .

--- 帖子 #1013 ---
the EA run on all 6 charts 3 pairs with MA cross 3 pairs with Bollinger Bands

--- 帖子 #1014 ---
I am using mostly EUR/USD, AUD/USD, and NZD/USD .. all of these have fairly low ADR compared to others.

I use 1 Hr time frame and usually setting the grid size to 250 (25 pips)

--- 帖子 #1015 ---
possible pairs: AUDUSD and NZDUSD go often to long in one direction and not enough back ! I trade this pairs NOT !

my closed orders today - DD now 1.0%

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1016 ---
I agree they can, but so can just about any pair if certain thing happen .. I like them because spread is low and the ADR is still pretty low .. just a matter of avoiding key news times and central bank statements

GB, you are now trading MA and Bollinger setting on EA ?  which one seems to be working better ?

--- 帖子 #1017 ---
MA cross and Bollinger Bands 50 / 50

for me is the Problem the AU or NU go one week or 2 weeks
without retracement in one direction and the orders are open

--- 帖子 #1020 ---
Hi

I have a questions:

What does it mean by grid size?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1021 ---
I am using 1010 also.  Sometimes where you think the files are located are not the exact location .. try this:

Go to top of MT4 and in the menu items, go to File --> Open Data Folder

From there you should see folders, go into MQL4 folder and then Experts .. drop the EA there.

After that, go back into MT4, right click on Expert Advisors in Navigator Window and hit Refresh .. you should now see the EA

Hope this helps

--- 帖子 #1022 ---
Grid Size is the distance where you determine how far price will go before you open the next position.

So if you want your next one to open after 25 pips, you would enter 250.  If you wanted after 15, then enter 150, ect

--- 帖子 #1023 ---
It is a very difficult choice. And the choice is very important.Are depends Other factors ?

Dear GhostBiker,

You are doing very good with this. Could you please share your result after 1 month trading with this EA. Profit is about 20%, how about max DD?

Will you keep it going the next months with same lot size?

Thank you!

--- 帖子 #1026 ---
- I trade the second month with the same LotSize (the LotSize is the maximum for this Balance, better trade 50% lower)

- if in the second month I have the same profit 20% I change the LotSize in the thirth month + 10%

- for the max DD I must look next week

--- 帖子 #1027 ---
@GB .. very nice trading with this EA .. you said you were using BB now and MA Cross .. are you using default settings from EA or something different

Please keep sharing your ADR and result everyday for encouraging everyone of us here! Thank you so much for your kindness!

--- 帖子 #1062 ---
ghostbyker what indicator gives you the grid size to use or in

wich way you find it?

--- 帖子 #1063 ---
Dear GB, I see you trade with M15 today.

Please share your rule about how to change the timeframe from H1 to M15? You change it depend on ADR?

Do we have to change also grid size and TP when changing TimeFrame?

Many thanks!

--- 帖子 #1064 ---
- I change only the TimeFrame, not Gridsize, not TP

- I've change the TimeFrame because lower ADR the last days, but only for today

- now is the TimeFrame back to H1

- GridSize I set with the ADR monthly+weekly+ daily : 3 x 25% - 30%

--- 帖子 #1065 ---
Thank you GB! Keep on updating on this great method!

--- 帖子 #1066 ---
Ghostbiker,

I put here an example:

ADR monthly (Last month): 320

ADR weekly Last week) : 134

ADR daily (Yesterday): 67

TOTAL IS: 521

521 :3 = 173.66

173.66 X 25% =43.25

43.25 X 30% = 12.97 (Gridsize) = rounding 130 in EA

The formula is correct ?

Can you confirm please ?

Many Thanks

--- 帖子 #1067 ---
Ghostbyker very interesting. You think that it is looser to try in money not cent account?

cent account is very low gain. also if you have great margin but it is not a real profit.

there is someone that uses it on real money not cent?

--- 帖子 #1068 ---
- no no no not 1 x 25% and 1 x 30% it is to low

- if I have in my ADR 80 then 25% = 20 (200)

@Ezios: if you have only 350 $ it is better to trade with Cent Account
if you have 1000 $ + you can trade with $ / EUR Account

for EU EF UF is the spread not to high by Cent accounts

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1069 ---
so as i understood about the example of fibo38 it is to eliminate only the last row

the remainder is correct right? the sum of the 3 adr divided into 4 (25%) it is so the calculation?

--- 帖子 #1070 ---
no the calculation is not so correct, I don't know my programmer the ADR calculate

--- 帖子 #1071 ---
this is my setting. no action were taken for 3 or 5 days.

thank you.

ahmadalbab1:

Hi, in the OPTIONS-->Expert Advisors uncheck the following:

Disable automated trading when the account has been changed

Disable automated trading when the profile has changed

What those do is turn off the EA if u make any change to your charts where the EA is located.

If I remember, even if u change timeframes or inputs that will cause the EA to stop trading with these two options activated.

So uncheck them, that way at least they won't be a factor that stops your EA from trading.

--- 帖子 #1073 ---
have someone ever tried to put multiplier to 1? so dont use martingale.

Trading to follow the trend for filter your risk.

- Long Only in M15 follow the trend indy by H1.

My backtest 15.09.2016 - 29.09.2016. Indicators is Down trend.

hello fibo,

my calculation has published on post. #1009 and is correct to the calculation what ghostbiker has written many times in this trade but different to the calculation what the programmer of ghostbiker has done........

so check my indicator with follow rules:

select month timeframe scale the last candle and note this

select week timeframe scale the last candle and note this

and

select daily timeframe scale the last candle and note this

so if you add this 3 results and divide it with 3 you can see that my indicator is correct (how i upload the indiator original without change anything) .....

example if you have select 25% in the setup of the indicator the result is the "SET TO GRID" Amount on the left corner with .....25% of ADR

sooo...us long we not know how ghostbiker `s programmer has programmed his ADR we can not change the calculation , and i think we will never experienced the right calculation of ghosbikers ADR ...SADLY ....

it's true. also if the ea send order in both directions but

the setting in common tag can block the order short or long depending on how it is set.

--- 帖子 #1130 ---
It's my strategy about MM.

All setting to default.

I just want to target for TP 3 usd by default setting, because it's quickly profitable.

A chart per trading target TP 3 usd by lot 0.01. I want to lot size 0.10 that I deploy run EA to 10 charts (10 charts x lot 0.01 = 0.10 lots).

So that 1 time per trading, If I get TP 3 usd in 10 charts >>> 10 x 3 = 30 usd.

In one day, I'll have the chance trading 5-10 times per day, that it's mean the chance to make a profitable 150-300 usd per day. That's my target.

however, I control risk by follow the trend. It's safely.

Hi Mathtraders,

firstly just wanted to say thank you for all the hours you spend creating free EAs.

secondly, I was wondering if it is possible to use one of the earlier versions of the Candle Martingale EA on Renko Charts, particularly the "open position on last candle" signal you had in the early versions with the martingale system. I am currently using your Non-gap renko chart creator.

thanks

--- 帖子 #1157 ---
hello mathtrader,

please can you add in the expert name your version  - example : MT7_CandleMartiEA_V2_0  ??   to avoid confusion ??

and why do you test with "control point" option .....i think the "TICK-data" option is the correct one or not ???

thanks

@Tony: when you use ea version 1.93 with default setting lotsize = 0.01

and net profit money 3 you put 10 ea in 10 chart all 15 timeframe and all same pair?

or you put 10 different pair? and your martingale multiplier is the default setting or you

change it and what is your balance of your account? and it is demo or real account?

--- 帖子 #1159 ---
Hi MathTrader7,

Thank you for a great EA!

I have used 1.64 on EURUSD and USDJPY, pattern type I as entry signal, (see detailed settings attached). And had pretty good figures using only a 500 euro account:

E.g. EURUSD:

Annual profit: +130%

CAGR %/year: +130% (Compounded Annual Growth Rate)

MDD %: -61% (Note: The MDD calculated on the % drawdown compared to initial deposit)

MAR: 4.6 (CAGR/MDD%)

Profit Factor: 2.04

(I'm attaching these version 1.64-settings for EURUSD and USDJPY for anyone to test.)

The settings have worked pretty good in backtesting 2015,2014,2013. Running it live since a couple of month with >150% yearly profit. Runs pretty stable with just a few cases where it needs to use the martingale function - it's never been close to fully invested.

I've run 300+ different backtests on different combinations in order to get the best risk/profit balance - using a pretty small initial deposit.

But now I see in version 2 that this entry signal has been removed. I'm sure it was for a reason.

Could you consider to add the Pattern Type I as a entry signal choice again?

Thanks!

/Mats

--- 帖子 #1160 ---
- 10 chart all 15 timeframes and all same pair (GBPAUD). >>> (Following the trend direction by H1)

- I martingale multiplier is the default setting.

- About MM, You should fix lot size initial deposit >= 500 USD per 0.01 lot for run EA a chart. It's safely, If you run EA 10 chart by default setting. (10 chart x deposit 500 USD =5,000 USD that total lots = 0.10)

- This is my real account standard.

- Now, I going forwarding test real account mini lot 0.01 but It still my balance to over trade yet.

- Net profit money 3 for my strategy, It's profitable quickly. >> 10 chart x TP 3 USD for GBPAUD.

Tony and the minilot for usd is = the minilot for euros? because my account is euros.

as i have another work i have not the time for every hour to go to the account and eventually to

But thanks very much for the informations.

--- 帖子 #1162 ---
Mini lot = All currency.

Example,

If you have MM about 500, you should setup EA initial lot = 0.01.

If you have MM about 1,000, you should setup EA initial lot = 0.02

If you have MM about 1,500, you should setup EA initial lot = 0.03

If you have MM about 2,000, you should setup EA initial lot = 0.04

If you have MM about 2,500, you should setup EA initial lot = 0.05

.

.

.

n

So that, minimum MM 500 per 0.01 lot.

That 's my strategy about My MM.

If you have no time, I recommend my solution.

I have a VPS online 7x24 at my home (You maybe VPS for rent from the provider). If I go outside, I'll have TeamViews on mobile to remote for control order and EA setting from outside.

--- 帖子 #1169 ---
Hi Tony. Thanks for your sharing good strategy. I have some questions:

- You have to monitor the H1 trend all the time for changing short/long in M15? Do  you have any alert?

- If the trend reverse suddenly while all your trade still are not closed, how we can handle with this situation ? Close in lost and change the trade direction or wait?

Thank you!

--- 帖子 #1170 ---
@xinix1974 @bkproteus

I'll enable EA to Long and Short and wait for last all order closed by EA or current my positions have the net profit, I'll close all order suddenly.

And then I'll disable all EA after that, I' ll setup EA to Only Long or Only Short for switch direction to follows the trend again.

Although positions are still open and the direction is changed, but last your positions to recovery and close by EA, if MM is enough and not over trade.

MM is very important.

@bkproteus

You can setup clock alarm to alert hourly on Mobile/Watch/Clock on the desk for signal close to the candle by H1.

(I'm going to find Trend Magic indicator for mobile alert.)

If you want to rest, you should disable EA before another work.

why you cant use one chart with 0.10 lots?

TP 3 USD per a chart. Initial Lot = 0.01.

If you run EA one chart, You will get only 3 USD. Because TP target fixed to 3 USD. That's my target and strategy about MM.
So that, I will get total money = 30 USD per 1 time in trading (@TP 3 x 10 charts).

Hi everyone,

I am testing live this EA. Setting is initial lot 0.01 and martingale factor 1.6. EA version 1.70

I have now 3 position open with the initial lot size 0.01.

It is not normal right? Maybe is a rounding problem? The 3rd position should have been 0.016. How the EA round this position?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1197 ---
- yes DD 15.8% closed zero today now (it is normally)

- the LotSize is to high, I will reduce if all is closed to 0.10 Lot TP 15 and 0.12 Lot TP 17

--- 帖子 #1198 ---
Your broker probably set 0.01 for both the minimum lot and lot step size. With such settings, there is no way to open a position with 0.016 lot.

--- 帖子 #1199 ---
So there is no sense of a martingale factor less than 2 right? At least with my broker.

Thanks Math!

--- 帖子 #1200 ---
With an initial lot size of 0.01, and with the settings of your broker, if you want to have positions opened with exact lot calculations, then you need to use Martingale multipliers such as 2.0, 3.0 and so on.

Do you think could be a good idea to compound profit any time?

I mean , not to enter with always same lot size( for example 0.1) but in % .

For example it should enter anytime with 1% or 3 % of the balance, after some profit it start to compound. It increase exponationally the performance.

What do you think?

--- 帖子 #1209 ---
As I said I am testing the version 1.70 of the EA.

Live account, 1:400 leverage, 0.01 initial lot, only eur/usd, 1 hr time frame. Marti factor 2.

I'm trying to understand how the sistem works and how the chosen timeframe affects the strategy.

How gridsize and timeframe are related once an order is open? I mean what is the difference, once that I have a position open, between a 60 pip movement within a minute bar or the same 60 pips movement within an hour bar.

If I have a 20 pip grid size I will have 3 levels open in both case or not?

I hope I have explained myself! Thanks

Tony I think that the system of trend following in h1 and m15 with ea can be easily

automated if you set up rules for signal signal generated by the trendmagic indicator

or eigher other custom or standard mt4 indicator. Once set up the rules

it can be programmed in an ea similar or the same of mt7 adding some options.

i am not great coder but i think that one expert programmer can do it easily.

Hi tony-fx

I have a few question to ask (i'm really sorry sorry if the question is already answered form previous post)

1. It seem TP and SL don't have the value when EA enter the trade, or EA used the TS. Also i don't really understand how this EA work for taking profit.

2. If i minimize the MT4 or change to other chart. For example i'm deploying EA into GBPAUD, then just switch to other pair. EA still running on GA chart right?

--- 帖子 #1232 ---
1. It's good logic by MathTrader7 , I use a default setting that no stop loss but EA 'll recovery loss by MM until it's got TP target. You should calculate MM for enough to trading.

No over trade. (The key of strategy >> MM).

About my MM.

Hi friend ghostbiker,

Did you change the Time Filter setup, what is it now and for general use?

Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #1252 ---
Hi Tony, I still dont understand :-) What is the difference having 10 charts, 0.01  x 3,- = 30,- or having 1 chart, 0.1 x 30,- = 30,-?? Same pip movement and same profit. Or am I wrong?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1253 ---
the time filter is every the same, I change not

- now today close + 0.95 % DD now 0.3% GMT 11:08

--- 帖子 #1254 ---
Hey,

I have a question.

If you use 20 Charts of all the same currency with the same Settings, same TP, why don't you use 1 Chart with the same Setting and a higher lot to achieve the same outcome?

D.

--- 帖子 #1255 ---
Basically same question as xinix1974.

--- 帖子 #1256 ---
TP in Money, EA count TP as your deposit currency.

If TP in pip or point, you can set initial lot 0.1.

e.g.

If TP in Pip, you can set TP=30, initial lot 0.1. when you get TP >> (30x10)x0.1 = 30 USD.

If TP in Point, you can set TP=300, initial lot 0.1. when you get TP >> 300x0.1 = 30 USD.

I'll show you by Demo.
Inserted Video

--- 帖子 #1257 ---
So, what you are saying is that it is to expensive because the EA is opening higher orders.

Ok. 20 charts is quite excessive, but I get your point. As long as it works.

If you set TP=30 in EA for one chart, I think it's too long to hit TP.

Hey Tony, thank you for your patience in trying to help us understand your trading method. If I may ask, how long did the EA take to place its first trade? It almost seems like its not working. I'm using the same version as yours 1.93. All other EA's I tried worked fine. I used other EA that Mathtrader kindly provided and had no issues. What is your take on that? Once again thank you for spending time explaining things to us here.

DEFINITION of 'Fat Finger Error'

A human error caused by pressing the wrong key when using a computer to input data. Fat finger errors are often harmless but can sometimes have significant consequences for example, if the wrong number is entered in performing a mathematical calculation.

Dont think of it as "martingale" .. think of it as a multiple entry strategy and keep in mind ..

1.  You can control which pairs and how many to trade

2.  You can control your position sizes

3.  You can control whether you only buy or only sell based on a trend

4.  You can control how many levels you want to enter and distance of the levels

5.  You can control how much in currency you are willing to risk on each trade

As Tony and Ghost have shown, this EA can be quite profitable, just have to be smart to increase the chances of being successful.

hello MT7

please give me code MT7 file .mql4 ?

Thanks

Email: { email address deleted by staff }

--- 帖子 #1318 ---
you have "hedge" in the EA it is "Anti Martingale"

--- 帖子 #1319 ---
allthough I have not this ea in my real account I am following this threat with lot of interest and I think that this ea

if well tuned and well used can give nice profits. Really I have put this in my demo account and look for to follow the various

strategies proposed in this threat and finally I will keep the decision of using it with real money if i will

be clever to use it.

--- 帖子 #1320 ---
my understanding was that anti martingale was the ability to add to positions during the current trade .. so instead of taking new position if you are down 20 pips, you can add a position if you are up x amount to increase profit should price continue in that direction.

regarding hedge, you should be able to do that by running EA on same pair but different chart, setting one to Long only and the other to Short only.  however, this will only work if you are non US customer.

--- 帖子 #1321 ---
has anybody previous version of the EA because as I can see Tony is using different version - signal is last bar not BB.

Waring about GAP in morning Monday, You should close all orders after the weekend.

Otherwise, You maybe return the profit to market like me. (It's terrible).

I don't know why not EA close order after TP over the target.

But I still believe in EA, It's recovery my loss this week.

I have stop loss -901 USD because my MM, it's overtraded and today, it's recovery 97 USD. The loss is remaining -804 USD. (Loss in profit of last week).

My solution.

I have run EA CloseAtProfit to another chart for confirming to close after TP over the target.

This EA, It'll close exactly. when TP over the target.

It's sure to close all when your profit > TP.(Close suddenly).

However, I still love major GBP pairs that trend pattern smoothly more than major USD pairs.

British's style (GBP) >> conservative >> Trend Pattern smoothly, Systematically.

I am not understand. what happening?

and I try 2.0 it work now.

--- 帖子 #1395 ---
while i think it is frustrating that the EA is not working, how did you lose a lot of money ?

If the EA  isn't working and you have open losing positions, you can manually add positions like the EA would have done.

--- 帖子 #1396 ---

--- 帖子 #1403 ---
My 2.0 ver still don't work. @ghostbiker - can you check this version please?

--- 帖子 #1404 ---
can you share this version? thx

--- 帖子 #1405 ---
I was able to open a few positions with version 1.93  ..  used setting of Follow Previous Candle on 5 minute chart just to see if it would open and it did.

Have not had anything open yet on version 2.0 so testing that with B Bands on 15 minute chart, along with 1.93.

Version 1.93 is on the attachment page if anyone is looking for it

Hopefully the issue is specific to older versions, but would like to find out the reason and if its something that we will encounter in the later versions as well.

--- 帖子 #1406 ---
I've cancel all MathTrader versions 1.64 and 1.93 because don't work all stopped out tonight to the same time
I mean all are time versions and now stopped out us. We lost our time and our brainstorming here for nothing

I am trading real account by manual from EA's idea. it' very sure.

EA in the world, it's not perfect to 100% but you can learning by doing for your idea.

I no longer work on this EA. I am developing a hedged version at the moment and I am busy with other projects.

--- 帖子 #1422 ---
MT7. can you add "Follow Previous Candle" to version 2.00 ? please.  Thank you.

--- 帖子 #1423 ---
[quote=MathTrader7;9193546]
ok fair enough,

I (and I think many more) regret it because you had gathered a happy community on here, all testing this EA and some hoping to make some money with it.

Beside that, I don't understand some negative reactions on here. When someone is sharing a good working EA for most people it's apparently difficult to say .. thanks for sharing! They only place statements of their succes with it, what money they make with it etc. And then .. when it's not working anymore .. they blame the developer.

I am not a world improver but it is just something I notice and had to say.

MT7: Is the expectation that v 2.0 also stop working? It's good to inform people about this because of the risk when trading with real money. Always a risk of course, but you know what I mean.

Succes with your other projects and thanks for sharing this EA, I have learned a new strategy! I am looking forward to other Ea's you are willing to share with this community.

--- 帖子 #1424 ---
Thanks for understanding the situation and your supportive words.

Since I have stopped further developing this EA, then it would be a wise decision for people to stop using this EA on their live accounts.

Best,

Math

--- 帖子 #1425 ---
Thanks for all, @MathTrader7,

I got good logic and idea from you.

And now, I going to forward test my EA which I have developed it from your EA.
Learning by doing and development to be your style.

Hi @Tony-fx,

I like your style using MT7's EA. Finding trend direction and a good point to start the trade is the key to success.

Could you share your EA? I'd love to test it, too.

Regards

--- 帖子 #1428 ---
Hi MathTrade,

Can you share the code, so we can continue the EA?

Thx for your time,

Best Regards,

Hi Mike,

--- 帖子 #1434 ---
Good time MathTrade! Yesterday I downloaded the first page EA. Today, I installed on a demo account. I chose two pairs:EURUSD & GBPUSD. For each pair opened two temporary schedules: 1 min and 5 min. AND EXPERT set for each pair with a different magic number. And you know trade interesting gone. Thank you for the expert.

--- 帖子 #1453 ---
I'm trying and it is not work for me (same array error).

Thank for sharing.

--- 帖子 #1454 ---
Thank you for your share.

Have you tried it yet Backtest EA? There are also similar EA again?

--- 帖子 #1455 ---
Hi folks.

The following is info so that many of you can understand what the error entails and the possible solution.  This is not a request for source cide but if math ever decides it would be of great benefit.

First off and array is a container that holds items.  Think of it as a list.  The list has a definite number. So in the case the program was trying to read an item that was not in the list, in fact it wenr beyond the number of items.  Say the list is 10 items, the program tried to read item 11 which dies not exist and is beyond the list.

So the solution is to either extend the array (add an item) or make the program not look for an item that is beyind the range.  Of course there could be other things that haooend before that affect the size of the array too, so we got to look at those too.

The location of the error can be found by looking at the nimbers in parentheeis after the error is called out.  In this case we see (165,11).  Which means the error was found in line 165 at character 11.

As for thise of u that have the EA working in demo I recommend u use a copier that will copy the trades over to a live account.  I have this setup on several EAs and have had no issues.  Just make sure u set up lotsize and rosk properly.

Good luck to all

--- 帖子 #1456 ---
I've been thinking about the idea. You can share specific tell me how to copy automatically from account trade demo account to live it? Do you use any other additional EA?

--- 帖子 #1457 ---
Math Trader 7 did not warn the expiration date. Very unfair.

--- 帖子 #1458 ---
It will be greatly appreciated if some one can give guidance as to where to get such trade copier to live or even post such a copier. Thanks and

Regards

--- 帖子 #1459 ---
I have reverse engineered the initial version of this EA

--- 帖子 #1460 ---
A good trade copier is provided by fxblue. For those that are not familiar you need two expert advisors. A receiver and a sender.

Place the sender EA on the account you want copied. For example in this case you place the receiver on a separate chart on the account that you are running your Candle Martingale EA. Then run the receiver EA on the account you want the trades to show up on. So I would open my live account and place on any chart the receiver EA.

You can download the EAs at:

fxblue.com/appstore/c6/trade-copying-apps

You will see two options.

The Personal Trade Copier is used when you are not sending your trade signals accross the internet. So if you are just on one machine you can use this.

The Internet Mirror Copier is when you want to send your signals to any MT4 accross the internet.

I recommend the personal cause you don't have to setup any signal subscribers and all the traffic is kept in one machine between one or as many accounts you want to link up to it.

Read the Guides for more information on lotsize, balance protections, time filters. But u can just try the default values.. They should be ok.

Good luck
