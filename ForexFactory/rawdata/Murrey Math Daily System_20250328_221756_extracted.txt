Here is my new system which involves using Murrey Math Levels on a Daily timeframe. If you don't understand how Murrey levels work, you can read up on it below to get a rough understanding of what they are and how price reacts around them. Murrey Math The basic concept of my strategy is to use the break of a Murrey Level to enter our trades and pick our targets. I have added the indicators, template, and two versions of a Trade Management EA I had made called Stealth. Stealth V.1 has inputs for a hidden TakeProfit and Stoploss, a Breakeven Level, and a Breakeven Shift. Stealth V.2 has a Trailing Step function added that kicks in after the Breakeven Level and Breakeven Shift have been triggered. Stealth V.2 is new and not fully tested, so use it at you own risk. Please install these in the proper folders and restart your platform. I trade and manage accounts at The Collective FX , so please download the platform from there website to follow my trades on the same broker. Any MT4 broker will do, but please fully understand that a different broker may provide different data which will result in your Murrey Levels appearing different than mine. I will be using 7 pairs which will be: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, EUR/GBP, GBP/CHF, USD/CAD, GBP/CAD, and GBP/JPY. If you have any questions you can e-mail me at mer071898@mchsi.com *** I've added a Trading Simulator that was provided to me by Ronald Raygun for everyone to use as they wish. Instructions are in the zip file along with a self installer.*** ***In post #426, we are testing a different variation of the main strategy using only a Target and Hard Stoploss. This means the trade will continue until either the Target or Stoploss is hit.***

The basic setup we are looking for is a price candle to break the Murrey Level and close above for a long trade or below for a short trade (which is in the example below). Once the candle breaks the Murrey Level, it tends to gravitate to the next level which is going to be our target. (see pic)

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Once we have made our entry, we need to input some numbers into out Stealth EA. First thing is to figure the initial stoploss. We measure from the entry of our trade to the Murrey Level above the level we just breached through. In this example we are at 212 pips. I know this seems steep but it is really only used as a emergency stop and not necessarily the point where we close out a bad trade (more on that later). Next we figure our TakeProfit target. We measure from the entry of our trade to the Murrey Level below our entry. In this case it is roughly 96 pips. You may even want to lower this a few pips to eliminate the possibility of spread issues that may hinder getting the trade closed out properly. The next thing we need to figure out is our Breakeven Point and Breakeven Shift. For this example, for the Breakeven Point, I take the Target pips (96 pips) and divide it in half or 48 pips. The Breakeven Shift is is half of the Breakeven point or 24 pips. So in this case, once price goes in my favor +48 pips, my stop will move to +24. This will lock in 24 pips of profit just in case price decides to take an about face on me. Enter these numbers into the Stealth EA for each trade you do. For those who would like to use Stealth V.2, you'll need to input how many pips you would like to trail the trade after the stop is moved. I suggest using the same number you used for the Breakeven shift, but this is totally up to to you.

A couple of things I look for when I'm evaluating these trades are: If the candle breaches more than one Murrey Level. This is a sign to watch out for because we can and probably will have a large retrace which could produce an extremely large drawdown. If the candle breaches the Murrey Level and closes more than 2/3 of the way to your target Murrey level. This does not leave you much room to bank some pips and you have the possibility of a reversal being so close to your Target Murrey Level. This is not to say you can't make money on these, just be cautious and use common sense. I always use a lower Breakeven Point and Shift on these. Heck, I still made $827.18 on 3 lots with the trade in the first pic!

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Now, what happens in a trade where price does not trigger our Breakeven Point and then reverses on us. Well, welcome to Forex trading! Don't worry, this is how I handle it. All I do is when the candle crosses back over the Murrey Level we just breached and closes above the Murrey Level, CLOSE THE TRADE!!! Losses are part of trading and there are way too many trading opportunities out there with this system to worry about a loss. If you look closely at the chart when this candle closed, we were able to open a long trade immediately after! We may have lost 150 pips, but we would now be in a trade that is already up 540+ pips (as of 10/16/2009) I've also noticed that we rarely see more than one or two losses in a row. You could always increase the risk on the next trade to recoup the losses on any previous trades, but that would be up to your own comfort level. I personally double up on a loss until I make up ground then go back to a normal trading size. And I only do this because I have the available margin to accomplish this safely .

--- 帖子 #6 ---
With regards to lot sizes, it is up to your discretion. I follow this guideline: If your profit target is the 4/8, 2/8, 6/8 0/8, or 8/8 = Use smaller lots as price will have more support and Resistance around these points and are more prone to reversals. If your profit target is the 1/8, 7/8, 3/8, or 5/8 = Use larger lots as price will have less support and Resistance around these points and are less prone to reversals. Important Only look for long entries if price is below the 0/8, -1/8, or -2/8 Only look for short entries if price is above the 8/8, +1/8, or +2/8 These are areas of extreme overbought or oversold levels and price can reverse quickly at these points. Also if price is breaching a +2/8 or -2/8, there is a good chance the Murrey Math Indicator will redraw and form new lines. If this happens it would be prudent to close out any trades that are in profit, re-evaluate your profit targets, stops, and Breakeven settings, and let the open trades ride until you are in profit or a close out scenario presents itself. Just remember, you will have picture perfect trades that hit their targets, sometimes we'll get stopped out and our Breakeven Shift, and even have to close out bad trades. But in the long run, this has proven to be a very consistent strategy and you are welcome to change whatever you'd like to fit your trading style, good luck and happy pips!

Thanks for the attachment. First time on forex factory and a forex newbie to be honest, but I'm an avid learner and I've learnt a lot since I started trading. Your system looks interesting and the Murrey Maths System is quite fascinating. Will be studying more about it tonight before markets open. Thanks

--- 帖子 #8 ---
And here are the three trades that I will be opening as trading starts up tonight.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
And one more. I will update my target, stoploss, Breakeven point, and Breakeven Shift once the orders are placed. These trades may not happen if there is any severe gap from Friday's close.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
very interesting and simple concept

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Thank you, countex. Keep checking in as I will be posting trades as I see them develop. Updates on the current setups: Eur/Gbp - Entry at .91344 TP-100, SL-160, BE-50, and BES-25 Gbp/Cad - Entry at 1.69352 TP-150, SL-340, BE-75, and BES-38 Gbp/Chf - Entry at 1.66482 TP-196, SL-300, BE-98, and BES-49 We waited on the Gbp/Chf entry due to price gapping below the Murrey Level. Once the Sunday candle filled the gap and closed above the line, we made our entry.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
That's a huge spike!

--- 帖子 #13 ---
What do you mean? the long black line that "looks" like a spike is pointing to the bottom comment.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Oh, I'm sorry. That looked a lot like the lower wick.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
No problem, I thought about that myself after I saved it.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Just to kill some time, I thought I would put together a zip file with pics of all the pairs I'm watching with all the possible trades that could have been taken over the past month and a half. Red lines are the possible shorts and Blue for the longs. The red "X" is because the previous closed out trade puts us past the overbought/oversold areas and are looking for longs/shorts only. This way you can see on the charts where you would enter and figure out what profit was possible and what you would have saved with the Breakeven shift. We did have some close out scenarios but very few and almost never back to back.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
you might hate me for doing this (adding new indicators), I can remove the post later if requested. IMHO, if you consider long term trend consideration, you can enter the trades and re-enter after a retrace with much higher probability. I have added fractals and 80 SMA slope direction line and the picture looks much easier to read. I am not much of an MML expert but this thread brings an interesting concept that I always wanted to test. Trends and Objects in Motion (moving objects will continue moving in the same direction).

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Thanks for the intro to your Murrey Math approach Mer and for sharing the components of your system. As a fairly new recruit to MM, I shall try to follow your posts and learn what I can and possibly ask a few questions along the way. Regards, TH

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Welcome aboard TrendHopper and Countex, I don't hate anyone (unless you insult my mother) so don't worry about that. I'm not one of those evil thread starter's that will not let trader's post their opinions. Feel free to make any changes to the system that you feel will benefit your trading. I just prefer not to post those changes here. I want to keep this strategy as clear and concise for as many who will follow this. Please open up a different thread if you have a lot of changes to make so not to get everyone confused and off the basic strategy, thanks.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
jmskates, there are some experimental trades on this demo as I was testing this strategy with another indicator which did okay, but not as well as I'd hoped and a few trades that I held a little longer than I should (in a good way) like the Gbp/Cad on 10/14. Feel free to start following the 3 current trades I just posted above if that will make you more comfortable and up to date. We do have 3 more trade setup possible today on Gbp/Usd, Aud/Nzd, and Eur/Nzd Be careful on the Eur/Nzd as the candle is more than 2/3 of the way to the target already. If you take this one, use a lower BE and BES on this one to be safe.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
And the 3rd.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
I had a question regarding these levels but after downloading your templates and rereading this post a few times, I think I might have answered my own question! I was wondering why on your trade examples, it looked like you were not entering on these overbought or oversold areas. I think the answer is because the indicator lines redraw themselves and what seemed to be overbought or oversold, now seems to be more in the middle?

--- 帖子 #23 ---
kellera6, most of the time if the price pushes past the + or -2/8, it will redraw. But the biggest issue is anytime you breach past the 8/8 or 0/8 levels, you are extremely susceptible to strong reversals because of the overbought/oversold condition. Half of the time you still have the strength to pull off an 8/8 or 0/8 breach but you have to lower your lots and be careful.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
I will probably pass on placing the Eur/Nzd trade for today as the candle is almost touching or target Murrey Level. The Gbp/Usd and Aud/Nzd trades are still a go.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Aud/Nzd and Eur/Nzd are 'no go" trades as the candles are too close to target Murrey Level. I did take the trade on the Gbp/Usd and a new setup that developed on the Gbp/Nzd. Gbp/Chf reversed on us and was closed and re-opened short, bumping up the lots to recoup some of the loss. Gbp/Usd- TP-78, SL-165, BE-39, and BES-19 Gbp/Nzd- TP-204, SL-720, BE-102, and BES-51 Gbp/Chf- TP-226, SL-270, BE-113, and BES-57

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hi Mer Thanks for your contrubution - nice work! Do you think it is possible to code this system into an EA? Cheers Spy

--- 帖子 #27 ---
It's possible, but I haven't had the need to develop one since I only spend 15-30 minutes looking at the charts. The tough part would be how the EA would handle the Murrey indicator when it recalculates.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
My Gbp/Usd trade closed out at BES with 19 pips @5 lots for $950.00 profit. I also had a Eur/Usd trade close out at BES for 25 pips @7 lots for $1750.00. That trade was taken before I started the thread.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Just an update, we closed out our Gbp/Cad from post #8 for 150 pips @ 4 lots for a total profit of $5796.83 + $4.53 in swap. Eur/Gbp just closed out at BES for 25 pips @ 6 lots for a profit of $2455.31 + $.22 in swap. All other trades are still active.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Do you take trades on any of the pairs available on your broker? Or do you have a short list of pairs that you look at?

--- 帖子 #31 ---
The pairs I watch are in blue on the first post. Any pair can be used but I stick to pairs that have an average daily range over 100. The only exception is Eur/Gbp because of the payout per pip is so good at over $16 a pip.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hello mer071898 Do you measure your daily average with an average true range ? Have you tried your strategy with a lower TF ? Do you trade with a live account ?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
LOL sorry I should have looked more closely. But still you told me what you were looking for in the pairs on your list: a high daily range.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
I just received a PM that post #5's pic is incorrect it should read as below. " Now, what happens in a trade where price does not trigger our Breakeven Point and then reverses on us.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
I just use the daily range calculator posted in the zip file on post #1. Just make sure to divide the value by 10. I, personally, do not like trading smaller timeframes due to the heavy whipsaw action, besides, I do run a full time business with my brother and the daily timeframe allows me do do both. Yes, I do trade this on a live account. My risk is a lot lower than what is shown on the demo for safety reasons.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Hi, my GU chart has lines too far apart (900 pips!). I suspect this is something to do with 5 digit brokerage, but there doesn't seem to be a setting for this &amp; your chart is a 5 digit one anyway. any ideas? thanks, Steve.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
ok, looks like it's the stepback period setting, what should this be set to? thanks, Steve. never mind, I've fixed it now, my fault, it was the mmperiod setting

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Hi Mer, You say you have been trading this on a demo the past few weeks but the results only go back 10 days or so? Any reason for the high leverage on the demo. What is the account size (starting balance)? Thanks

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Porkpie, 10/8 to 10/20 is roughly two weeks, sorry I'm off a few days . It was not meant to be an exact time, just a rough estimate. The leverage on the account is only 100:1 and the starting account balance was $100K. Arnold49, yes, all you need to change is the MMperiod to 1440. If your measuring between your entry and your target Murrey Level, divide that number by 10 on a 5 digit broker and round it down. The Gbp/Chf and Gbp/Nzd are still active and we have two more entries on Eur/Cad and Gbp/Cad. I'm using lower lots on the Eur/Cad as we can see that we've already crossed two Murrey Levels on this one so we need to be mindful of the possibility of a larger retracement. Eur/Cad- TP-72, SL-180, BE-36, and BES-18 Gbp/Cad- TP-138, SL-350, BE-69, and BES-35

--- 帖子 #40 ---
I have always believed that long tf are the best to trade I am in.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Hi mer, Loving the mechanical nature of this system. Quick points of thought (not criticism): 1. Why bother using candles? Line graph is all we need if all we care about is the close, right? 2. You have a lot of highly correlated pairs in your post #1 list, wouldn't it be better to narrow them down so you are getting the most market exposure for the least risk? For example: GBP/CHF and EUR/GBP are now extremely highly correlated. GBP/AUD and GBP/CAD are now extremely highly correlated due to commodity exposure. etc. The pairs I think would provide the best market exposure/lowest risk to be: EUR/GBP, EUR/CHF, AUD/NZD, GBP/AUD (or GPB/CAD), EUR/AUD (or EUR/CAD), etc. You probably only need to pick 4 of these maximum I reckon. Just my opinion though. 3. We can write an EA to do this trading very simply, can't we? Step 1: D1 close/open across nearest MML level. Open trade in cross direction. TP at next MML level, no SL. Step 2: Exit position if D1 close/open across signal MML level.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Hey Sinner, I always appreciate any input. I use candles because, let face it, bar charts confuse me and I've used candles ever since I started trading. Feel free to use what's comfortable for you. With regard to the correlated pairs, even if certain pairs are correlated does not mean the Murrey calculations for a correlated pair will be the same. And since this is based on Murrey Levels and not correlation, it shouldn't matter which pairs you use. I thought about doing an EA, but since it only takes me 15-30 minutes a day to make my trades, I don't think it is necessary to have it to trade this strategy. I you want to take on the challenge of an EA, just do me a favor and open a new thread to keep this one dedicated to the strategy itself.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Congratulations on working and thanks for sharing good success ... I follow the method

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Welcome to the thread okeheidon and zeCarvalho. With had two trades close out last night. Eur/Cad close out at BES with @ 18 pips using 3 lots for $514.35. Gbp/Cad closed out at Target @ 158pips using 6 lots for $9046.23. Gbp/Chf will probably close at a loss a I was expecting more of a retrace, but hey it happens. Our Gbp/Nzd looks like it will stay active as the 1/8 Murrey held overnight. I will update these pairs tonight once we check for setups for tomorrow. If you didn't use the BE on the Eur/Cad trade, you would've hit your Target on this one which goes to show you by not using the Stealth EA or even using higher BE points may have changed the trade completely. Of course on the other hand, a higher BE point may not get triggered, so don't feel you have to use my numbers, experiment a little on these.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Here are the trades taken for today: Gbp/Usd- TP-110, SL-140, BE-60, and BES-30 Eur/Jpy- TP-98, SL-220, BE-49, and BES-25 Gbp/Jpy- TP-208, SL-430, BE-104, and BES-52 Gbp/Chf- TP-142, SL-360, BE-71, and BES-36 Aud/Nzd- TP-32, SL-100, BE-16, and BES-8 We did have another reversal on Gbp/Chf which was closed and re-entered above, increasing the lots to compensate for the loss. I used extremely low lots on the Gbp/Usd trade due to the fact we have crossed two Murrey Levels and are now past the 8/8. This would be a good place to sit out and wait for the short trade but I'll take it with small lots to see how it pans out as a test. Gbp/Nzd is still active and will continue to hold (at least will get some positive swap).

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Eur/jpy and Gbp/Jpy

--- 帖子 #47 ---
And finally, Aud/nzd

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Hi mer, Nice Strategy you have here, I took this 3 Trades too, Lets see where they will go, anyway the only thing that im not sure about is the lot increasing part in this strategy, to do this on a live account you really need to have trust and long experience in what your doing .. but i guess that needs time to come ... but so far you really have great success , are you planning to go live at some point with this strategy ? Thx 4 sharing cu iT

--- 帖子 #49 ---
I only tell people to increase or double the lots as long as they don't put the account in jeopardy by using too much risk to start. If your starting with 5-10% risk per trade to start, then you are going to be in trouble doubling up two or three times unless you have the account equity to back it up and be safe. I'm already trading this live myself and for clients, but I'm nowhere near the risk where it'll damage my account or any of my client accounts, even if I double up 3-4 times. I've personally doubled up at the most 2-3 times using this strategy, so I feel it is pretty safe to do so with proper money management. You may have already heard of it, but one of the top Commercial EA's called Megadroid uses a "recovery" strategy where it doubles up after a loss to recoup those losses, so I adapted it to this strategy. If you don't feel comfortable doing so, then by all means don't.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Very interesting. I am going to give this a go over next few weeks and closely follow this thread. Cheers Garfield

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Welcome to the asylum garfield, if you have any questions, just ask

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Hey Mer Could you just simply place the stop at the MM Level and not use stealth / BE etc. Then just implement simple MM. It just seems more often than not the TP is reached anyway. Regards Spy

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Yes you can, as I already mentioned in post #46. The only problem with that is the stop is generally so huge you'd have to determine a better stop if your going to just let it run til it hits a TP target. I would rather be safe an take some profit than risk a huge stop being hit, just my preference.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
hi mer071898 thanks for sharing your great strategy, I like what I read count me in as well. I have applyed the murrey math indi and I am looking at your charts and comparing with mine, what I notices is that the lines are soooo apart and I also have to zoom out to see few lines, take a look at it and let me know why? thanks

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Hi Mer, I was looking at your charts and at first could not get GU to look the same. Only after I changed the P variable on the mm indicator to 32 was I able to get the same as you. Looking at the rest of the charts I'm following the variable is set at 64 to match your charts. Is there a reason for this change on GU?

--- 帖子 #56 ---
lol, i had the same problem , thanks for posting the solution /edit, is it somehow possible to backtest this strategy for a longer period backwards ?

--- 帖子 #57 ---
First of all fed, you are using a 15 minute chart . You should be on a Daily chart and if you are using an Mt4 platform should should make sure you are using the template provided in post #1 and you should be good to go. The only input that should be changed is the MMperiod needs to be 1440. There is no EA for this itrader, you'll have to manually backtest this yourself by using a trading simulator or physically going back through the charts.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
just a small update, Aud/Nzd closed out at BES with @ 8 pips using 5 lots for $302.02 profit and Eur/Jpy closed out at BES with @ 25 pips using 4 lots for $1093.63. All other trades are still active as of this post. As an experiment I will be testing out the Stealth V.2 on a trade tonight. This is the version with the Trailing Stop feature (referred to as "TS" after this point) that will take over after the BES is set.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
It's about 15 minutes til the new candle for the day and it looks like we have only one trade to open on Gbp/Cad tonight. All other trades will remain active as well. I will post the Stealth inputs shortly.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
nop that was the daily, I will try the template see if there is any differance. Thanks for your reply

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Gbp/Cad trade entered and I will be testing out the Stealth V.2 on this trade and see how it works out. TS = Trailing Stop and will be half of the BES rounded up. Gbp/Cad- TP-178, SL-310, BE-89, BES-45, and TS-23

--- 帖子 #62 ---
hi, to forgive my English, translator used. mer071898 thanks for your strategy, it is very simple and effective. From this night I will enter with an account in alive, but to 0.1 lots. The offices that at the moment today I see are, EUR/USD and GBP/CAD. Are they correct?

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Sorry, I just assumed you were on a 15 minute timeframe because every tab on the bottom of your pic shows M15. I don't know why the template wouldn't work, but if doesn't, let me know and I'll try to help out as much as I can.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Sorry sionooyoques, I must have not seen your post after I posted my entry and Stealth numbers. I did not take the Eur/Usd as it actually closed below the Murrey Level on my platform then the next candle opened above. I know it's only by a few pips but I am very strict on exact entries. Again, sorry for the late response.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
hey, I have placed your template and I noticed the MMPeriod was different at 1440 and I had it at 1 so now I have it just like yours. Do you use the information on the buttom at all? as far as I have understood if the price closes above or below these lines the take the trade, take long if closes above the line and if it closes below just take short trade. you have also mentioned if price is below 0/8 that means it is oversold and look for a long oportunity and if the price is above 8/8 which is overbought and look for shorts....

--- 帖子 #66 ---
this one closed above the line, how come this wasn't a valid trade for a long?

--- 帖子 #67 ---
It seems like different data as I have the same results. Who is your broker?

--- 帖子 #68 ---
hmmn, behold, the holygrail seekers!

--- 帖子 #69 ---
ibfx

--- 帖子 #70 ---
fed and hello, you guys are correct. Different brokers will have different data. That trade would have been a valid trade and you could have taken it if you wanted to. On my broker, The Collective FX, the bar missed the Murrey Line by one pip and the following candle opened above the Murrey line by 3 pips and neither really breached the line, so I didn't take it. That's why I always suggest to try and use the same broker (not required though) so we see the same charts and data. It may be silly that I didn't take it, but I'm a stickler when it comes to entry criteria. And eloaking, I never claimed this to be the the holy grail by any means so please don't stoke the fire. If you don't like the strategy, then all I can say is don't use it.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
ok i c, I just also wanted to see that if I am in the same page as you.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
I haven't read how these lines are calculated which I will this weekend when I have the time but I am wondering how often these lines recalculated or change?

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Hi mer, Great idea of this system. I appreciate your good organized work of explanation us how to trade. I have a question: Isn't a mistake in your second sentence ? Both sentences have "= Use smaller lots".

--- 帖子 #74 ---
The only times I've personally see them change is when we get to the extreme levels near the + or - 2/8. Once they breach these levels the Murrey indicator will usually redraw at opening of the next candle. The best way to be safe is before you make a trade, load your template again and that will reset the Murrey Lines. If there is no change then you are good to go. If they do change, then re-evaluate the charts before placing your trades.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Well, some good news and bad news. First, the good news. We had three closed trades already for profit and one was the biggest trade so far this month. Gbp/cad closed out at BES with 91 pips using 4 lots for $3461.75 Gbp/Chf closed out at BES with 36 pips using 12 lots for $4288.74 And the biggest profitable trade of the month so far! Gbp/Jpy closed out at TP with 206 pips using 12 lots for $26872.40 The Gbp/Nzd short is the only active trade I have open at the moment and hopefully the news will push this back towards the TP. The bad news is tonight for the first time in a long time I lost focus and forgot to physically input my trade numbers on the Stealth EA on the Gbp/Usd trade. After I looked at the chart, it easily should have moved past the BE of 60 pips and retraced to the BES and closed with 30 pips after the 3:30 Gbp news. After I noticed I forgot to input the correct numbers, I made sure to at least input my SL pips first and hope for a rebound, but I was unfortunately stopped out at -140 pips for a total loss of -$2812.00. Thank god I read the Murrey Level and candle correctly and only used 2 lots which is why it is very important to know which Murrey levels you are breaching and how the candle has formed and realize what that signifies and how to properly trade that setup. This also goes to show that you have to pay attention to details or you will lose money, period. I hope everyone learns from my mistake and everyone made some good money tonight. Just a small word of advice for spymez, this is why I use the Stealth EA because when the GBP Prelim Gross Domestic Product news hit a 3:30 this morning, all these GBP trades took a very huge nosedive. Instead of losing a ton of money, the Stealth EA saved three of the four long trades (the Gbp/Jpy hit it's TP before the drop and it would have saved the Gbp/Usd trade if I didn't screw that one up) from having huge losses and it made me over $7800.00 (actually over $8400.00, again if I didn't screw up the Gbp/Usd trade). Without using this EA, I guarantee I would not be in the position to almost double the account in 2 weeks.

I'm definitely going to study this thread more Please keep guiding us because we are definitely listening! thanks

hi mer071898, when the price is around line 4/8 do you just leave it alone? also what time does your day end? I'm going to demo this in the uk &amp; I'd like to know if the difference in times will affect the profitability thanks, Steve.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
This looks like an excellent system. Your martingale will eventually bite your head off, but that's something you won't believe until it happens. Otherwise it looks good.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
I agree to just take your loss and move on and recoup it slowly.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
kellera6, welcome to the thread. The only time I leave trades alone is when we're pushing past the 0/8 or 8/8 Murrey levels. You are now in oversold/overbought areas and reversals are imminent. If you read post #6, I gave you some guidelines regarding lot sizes to use regarding the levels. My day basically starts 15-20 minutes before the new candle forms evaluating the charts and I don't touch the trades I place until the next daily candle forms. So, basically I "work" for about 15-30 minutes a day. As long as you give your self enough time before the new candle to look at the charts and determine which pairs you will be placing trades on, you are good to go. Where you live and your time has absolutely nothing to do with this strategy. Murrey Levels breaches occur here in the US just as they occur in the UK. billbss and kellera6, I respect you opinions and inputs, but with regards to the martingale part of this strategy, you guys really need to read through the whole thread. I clearly stated this in post #5: I do it because I have more than enough margin to double up 6-7 times if it came down to it. The way I work it is this: Say our first trade is for 3 lots and we have a loss. On the next trade on that pair I will go 6 lots. If we lose that one, instead of going to 12 (doubling of 6 lots), I will add the first two lot totals together for a total of 9 lots. In a way it's sort of a semi-martingale and not a true martingale. My goal is that I just want to recoup my losses, not to look for the big monster trade. Once I recoup enough of the losses, I go back to normal trading. I don't force anyone to follow how I trade my strategy, but learn to make their own decision on how to place trades and tackle the losses.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
Well, the news this morning really helped out my Gbp/Nzd trade. After looming in around the -$10K mark for a few days we finally were able to pull out some profit. Gbp/Nzd closed out at BES with 51 pips using 4 lots for $1543.30 plus $8.40 in swap for a total of $1551.70 We currently have no open trades and it looks like we will have a few setups at the start of the week as long as everything holds up for the next 4-5 hours. Remember, if you have Sunday candles, be sure to take any gaps into consideration before trading. Talk to you all on Sunday.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
just to get things straight, if the price crosses the 4/8 line upwards you go long? this seems to go against the rule about going long from line 1 &amp; short from line 8? and you place trades at the end of your day when the bar closes, I can assure you your daily bar doesn't close the same time as mine! I will make a big difference, unless your broker is GMT? thanks Steve.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
I try to look to for only long trades after the price has pushed below the 0/8 and beyond and only look for shorts after price has pushed above the 8/8 and beyond . In the picture you will have some trades that may reach past the 0/8 or 8/8 and reach the next Murrey Level and some that won't. Anything else, price can breach the Murrey levels in either direction. You can also use things like fib retracements to help in your decision. If you notice, both trades in the pic have hit the 61.8 fib retracement which would tell me to pass on these or to use extremely low lots if I decided to trade past these points. You need to not be wrapped up in the time. I wasn't saying the end of the day is the same, but no matter what time your daily candle starts, you will still have breaches of the Murrey Levels. This is what you need to be able to concentrate on, not the time.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
thanks for clearing that up for me. Steve.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
I never try to argue anyone out of a martingale. Been there and done that too many times. I can show you mathematically that you will eventually hit the killer trade, and that until you do, sizing your lots to make room for a martingale, will hurt your bottom line, but experience is the best teacher. That's why I said you won't believe it will ruin you until it happens- which it will, if you continue it.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Heck billbss, I will probably retire from this business before that will happen, lol. I know all about the ins and outs of martingale strategies myself after developing a Semi-martingale EA a while back. I tested this strategy through my trading simulator (on numerous pairs) for over 4-5 years worth of trades, well before I posted this thread, so I was confident about everything involved with trading this strategy, including increasing lots on the losses. I never came close to a margin call, never ran into a situation where I could not recoup the losses back, and never saw more than 4 losses in a row any any single pair I was testing. If you can show me where there was ever more than 4 losses in a row on any single pair , I will be shocked that I missed it. But I reiterate again to everyone, this is how I trade my strategy and you do not have to double up the lots on a loss if you don't feel comfortable doing so, end of story. And billbss, feel free to post any opinions, they are always welcome and respected!

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Thanks for the system I'd like to know what's the trading simulator that you use and the historical result. Is it possible?

--- 帖子 #88 ---
I got it from Ronald Raygun and it allows you place trades on the chart exactly as you would in real trading situations. I don't keep any data from the simulator because I use it primarily for testing purposes only. I will post it here and in post #1 for you and everyone else to use if they'd like. There is a self installer included and full instructions on how to use it.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
I undestand better now. I totally agree that it's up to your risk level and also how comfortable you feel with the system you are using. Obviously you are becoming more comfortable with it because of how long you have studied it and seen it's results. I hope to be in your shoes soon!

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Glad to hear you got it kellera6. I try my best to help out members with any questions or if there is any confusion.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Thanks mer for sharing the interesting system. Have been experimenting for the past few days and now have some questions. Perhaps due to different bar times for different platforms/servers, the MM lines seem to differ between FXDD, InterbankFX, FxOpen and AlpariUK that I tested. Would be helpful if you would tell us know your broker/platform so that we can clone your trades. Regarding the semi-martingale lot management, have done a study on the trades off your live stats and see that keeping the lot size equal still gives positive results although the gains would be about 1/6 of your aggressive, semi-martingale method. So with the conservative lot management, the system does seem to produce some nice pips, which is encouraging. Thanks again, RS

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Hello, thank you for posting this system. I am reading this thread from beginning. From your results it seems that it works.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
you negotiate on Sunday? candle that follow, Friday or Sunday?

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Alright I post what I see according to the system and validate with some of my own strat. Upcoming trades as follows: 1. Short GU @ at market open, emergency stop 1.6692 tp 1.61133 exit trade if price closes above MM 3/8 AT 1.6357 if daily candle closes above on monday (other considerations for the trade are the fundamental driver of poor GDP report on fri and the technical Bearish engulfing pattern) 2. Long eur gbp @ market open (with reduced lots due to gbp correlation with GU) SL .90021 TP .92773 (mm 8/8) 3. Will pass over shot GBP CHF due to correlation factor with GU and EG and price at MM 0/8 and -1/8 according to the rules of the system) 4. usd cad Long @ market open sl 1.3760 tp 1.06201 will exit trade if price crosses back below mm 1.0498 mm 2/8 on dialy close 5. Skip eur jpy according to the rules price over mm 8/8. 6. Skip aud jpy cos reached my max risk exposure with other trades and do not like the pin bar like candle on friday close. So will trade only Short GU, Long eurgbp and Long Usd Cad. My risk exposure will not allow me take any other trades. Mind you I am live on this trades. I have attached my charts. Comments folks

--- 帖子 #95 ---
From your stats it does seem that this work, and i want to start testing from this week will keep you guys posted. As for the EA i would try managing it as i can't run my internet 24/7... will use the strict take profit and stop loss and see the results. If this work in a demo well for about 2-3months, it do be perfect one for me as my studies do not afford me so much time to be on the chart. thanks for sharing...

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Hi Okehiedon GU candle has breached 2 MM levels. So it should not be a good trade as recommended.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
and it is too close to the next level so your risk/reward is not worth it.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
RisingSun, I trade at The Collective FX which is mentioned on the first post. Naijapipholi, I fully understand about running the internet all the time. I took the plunge and put my trading platforms on a VPS (Virtual Private Server) so I don't have to have my computer on all the time either. I have mine at Commercial Network Services for $30 a month. I like them because they cater to traders and they even have a latency chart so you can pick the best server for your particular broker. If you can't do the VPS thing, you'll definately want to tighten up the stops and check in on the trades at least every 4-6 hours and move your stop accordingly. You may even want to use MT4's trailing stop as a precautionary measure just in case, it might help. I'm a little unclear on what your asking. I have Sunday bars on my broker and that is where I start the new week. Treat this strategy as the market is never closed on the weekend because whether you do or do not have a Sunday candle, you will still perform the same daily check as if, for example, you were going from Tuesday to Wednesday. The only thing to be mindful of with Sunday candles is the gap that may form. Friday's candle may have closed above the Murrey Level, but the Sunday may gap open below the Murrey Level and you may have to wait for it to breach, filling the gap, and close above to confirm the trade (which 80% of gaps will fill). if it doesn't fill the gap and closes below the Murrey Level, pass on the trade and go on to the next opportunity. (See pic)

--- 帖子 #99 ---
I'm not trading all the pairs but these are 2 possible trades that I see for tonight, unless their is a gap open. The spreadsheet auto calculates the BE and BES, so feel free to use it for yourself!

--- 帖子 #100 ---
okehiedon, That's what I like to see, people taking the time ahead to evaluate the pairs. I will go over what I see. All these scenarios will depend on if the Sunday candle gaps. Eur/Usd- Closed below 7/8, will take short with a target of the 6/8. I will use lower lots due to a strong Murrey Level target. Be mindful of the 76.4 retracement from the drop we had from 7/08 to 10/08 last year, it may play a role in the next few trades. Gbp/Usd- With the GBP news Friday morning this dropped down through 3 Murrey levels on us. Be very cautious on this one. Even though we are coming down off of an Overbought level, this could be susceptible to a large retrace. Be sure to use extremely low lots when taking this trade even though we breached a strong Murrey Level at 6/8. and thanks kellera6 for the spreadsheet.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Eur/Gbp- Long taken with lower lots on the open. Be careful as price was rejected at the 50 fib retracement. You may want to see how the Sunday candle react on the open. Eur/Jpy- No trade taken due to the price is past the 8/8. Those who take this long use very low lots.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
What does "P" and "StepBack" refer to? Must "MMPeriod" always match the time frame of the chart?

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Hi: Really like this method. Thank you. How come I only show Gu went thru 2 MM levels? You show 3; I'm using your template too...my Sunday broker hasn't started yet so perhaps it will catch up to yours when it does. Thanks, Steve

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Thaks guys for reminding me of the rules of this system. However I still believe in the GU short trade. This is how I plan to trade it. 1. My bias is short. so not looking for long trades unless daily price closes above nearest MM level at 1.6357 2. Sell a rejection at MM level1.6357 or 38 ret @ 1.64454 of fridays hi low or 50 fib ret @ 1.6490. 3. Sell stop below fri low depending on price at market open. thanks mer071898 for this simple and robust system.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
To be honest, I have no idea what the "P" and "StepBack" refer to, I'm only concerned about the MMPeriod which should match the timeframe your chart is on, in this case it should be 1440. Remember, different broker's will show different data. If you want to have the same data as I see, you must use the same platform as I'm using from The Collective FX. okehiedon, use whatever makes you feel comfortable. I will also take the short as long as the Sunday opens below my 6/8.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Gbp/Chf and Eur/Cad are both basic setups.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Last but not least, I will pass on the Gbp/Cad as the candle is too close to the target Murrey Level. If price gaps up a little, I may re-evaluate the entry. Make sure to double check the Murrey indicator for any re-calculations on the opening of the Sunday candle or if there are any gaps first before any decisions are made.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
You lost me on GBP/CHF Price is between 0/8 and -1/8. Isn't that "long only" territory? Why isn't EUR/USD a short trade?

--- 帖子 #109 ---
mer071898 your GbpChf by the rules is not valid because it has breached MM 0/8 extremely oversold level. Confirm I got that right

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Not according to my charts. Do you have the timeframe correct on the indicator? Have you reloaded the template since Friday? My candle is sitting between the 4/8 and the 3/8. (See pic). Again, this might be an issue with different data being provided. You'll have to go with the data your broker is reporting, or download the MT4 platform from The Collective FX. billbss, if you look at post #102, I have it as a short trade. "Eur/Usd- Closed below 7/8, will take short with a target of the 6/8. I will use lower lots due to a strong Murrey Level target. Be mindful of the 76.4 retracement from the drop we had from 7/08 to 10/08 last year, it may play a role in the next few trades."

--- 帖子 #111 ---
My GBP/CHF is on Daily. I reloaded the template. Price is between 0/8 and -1/8. I don't believe difference in broker prices or times could account for that wide a discrepancy.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
I will reload my template when the candle opens. Don't worry, if It changes I will be the first to admit I am wrong. That's why I reload my template everyday before I trade just to be safe.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
I reloaded my GBPCHF and I'm now seeing what mer071898 sees. It has breached 4/8 and it's headed down to 3/8. My broker is FXCM .

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Mine may change when data hits it, in about 30 minutes.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
I will be experimenting with the Stealth V.2 to see if the Trailing Step (TS) will be any more beneficial. Trades I've taken: Eur/Usd-Short- TP-104, SL-140, BE-52, BES-26, and TS-13, 4 lots Gbp/Usd-Short- TP-56, SL-190, BE-28, BES-14, and TS-7, 4 lots Eur/Gbp-Long- TP-70, SL-176, BE-35, BES-18, and TS-9, 4 lots Eur/Jpy-Long- TP-90, SL-226, BE-45, BES-23, and TS-12, 2 lots Gbp/Chf-Short- TP-74, SL-414, BE-37, BES-19, and TS-10, 8 lots Eur/Cad-Long- TP-72, SL-172, BE-36, BES-18, and TS-9, 4 lots

--- 帖子 #116 ---
I have taken eur/usd short, eur/gbp long and usd/cad long. usd/nzd, usd/gbp both looked good but it is too late now. I stayed away from eur/jpy which is closed above 8/8 so I will look for a short....

--- 帖子 #117 ---
how do I use the stealth indi? I have placed it in the indicator's folder and when I drag it to my chart nothing happens.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
That's because it is an EA, not an indicator. Place in the experts folder and restart your Metatrader platform.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
I c thanks, I haven't used an EA before. Can I still use it to an existing trade? or do I have to open the trade again?

--- 帖子 #120 ---
No, just click on the navigator in the menu bar, double click on which version of the stealth you want to use (V.2 has the trailing step) and input the numbers you calculate and your done. Once placed on the chart, it will take over and manage the trade.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
My Gbp/Usd trade has closed out @ 21 pips for a profit of $840.00 with 4 lots. it looks like the Trailing Step (TS) is working as the BES of 14 pips was set then the TS hit once for an additional 7 pips for my 21 pip total. Everything else is still active.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
That's strange. I used Stealth V2 and mine's still in. I have noticed in the past with my MT4 station that the trailing stop doesn't work properly. It's almost as if every tick in the direction of the trade lowers the TS count and before you know it, the stop loss is met.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Remember, this is not a Trailing Stop but a Trailing Step. For example, If we take the trade I just closed where the BES was moved to 14 pips, I had a 7 pip TS on that trade. That means that the BES will move up in 7 pip increments, not every pip. I don't know why your still in unless it has to do with the price I actually entered compared to you or it could be the spread difference as well. Also, My Gbp/Chf trade has closed out @ 29 pips (BES-19 pips + TS-10 pips)for a profit of $2304.44 with 8 lots. Everything else is still active.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
hmmm I have set up the stealth v2 and it didn't set up the TP SL yet look at the pics you will notice in the circles tp and sl is still 0.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
I forgot to mention on my above post that I have the smiley face too which not shown on the images

--- 帖子 #126 ---
nice i hope you keep it up with these successfull trades...

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Ahhh, I know why I'm still in. Even though I moved the advisor onto the chart, I had Expert Advisors off! I just turned it on, so we'll see what happens later.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
fed, that's the whole premise of the EA, to not be seen. When you manually place a TP and a SL, it will show up in the terminal and the broker can see it. The Stealth EA's TP and SL are internal and not seen by the broker, so it shouldn't show up on the terminal at all (see pic). You should also uncheck "Confirm DLL function Calls". This is just a suggestion (you may leave it at whatever level you want), I would highly suggest a larger SL as 71 pips is really too small on a daily timeframe and you'll be stopped out more often than not, remember it is only used as an emergency stop. If the trade goes bad we will close it out well before the SL anyhow.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
OOPS!!!! Done that before way too many times. I'm glad you figured it out.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
nice, if it won't show and if my broker won't know then I like this. thanks for your suggestions

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Not a problem, I've had so many trades stop hunted by retail brokers over the years it's funny, and the don't try and hide it either.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
But with 5 digit brokers which I am with one forex.com , do I have to include the 5th digit?

--- 帖子 #133 ---
tell me about it it is very frusting to see your trade is closed out by 1-2 pips just because my broker increased their spreads ...

--- 帖子 #134 ---
I sorry, you lost me, what do you mean "include the 5th digit"?

--- 帖子 #135 ---
here is what I mean, you will notice that in circles the price will have 5 digits not 4 like most of the brokers out there. the first one will have aprice of 1.4550, with the 4 digit brokers that 0 at the end it wouldn't be there.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
I just looked at your images and noticed that your broker is also 5 digit

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Okay, I see what you mean. No, you don't have to put in the extra digit. If your looking for 150 pip SL, just put in 150. The EA should work on a 4 or 5 digit broker with no issues.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
thanks for your reply

--- 帖子 #139 ---
No problem, again there are no stupid questions. If you don't ask, it'll come back and bite you in the a$$, guaranteed.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
My Eur/Cad trade has closed out @ 18 pips for a profit of $684.27 with 4 lots. Everything else is still active. So far we've booked $3828.71 profit on 3 trades with 3 trades to go.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Hey mer and others, is it my imagination or has mt4stats been down lately?

--- 帖子 #142 ---
EURJPY long? It closed Friday above 8/8 which is overbought.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
yes i know and that is why i haven't taken the trade myself.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
my usd/cad did close with a profit, the other 2 eur/usd and eur/gbp still going.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
I didn't enter the USDCAD in my Demo but it sure did perform well. Overall I am very impressed with this Murrey system. I like its simplicity in setup, the small amount of time that it takes to review the trades each day, and most of all its profit vs. loss

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Today I have had two offices, eur/usd BE 85 pips. And usd/cad 42 pips. Someone can say to me like to insert images. Thank you very much. Thank you mer071898 for this system.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
I know, I just tested it with very small lots (two) just to see how it would perform, but you guys are right. Typically, we would not have taken this trade due to those reasons and if you look at post #101, I already mentioned that you should not take this trade and if you do to use extremely low lots. Yes stevegee58, it has been down all night for some reason. I sent them an e-mail yesterday but have not received a response. sionooyoques, If you are asking how to post a pic, all you have to do is when you reply to a post, go down to Thread Options-Manage Attachments. When you click it a box will pop up and then you click Browse and then locate the file you want to upload, click the file, then hit Open, then Upload, and then close the box and your done. UPDATE: My Eur/Usd trade has closed @ TP for 105 pips for a profit of $4188.00 with 4 lots. Everything else is still active. At this pace it looks like we'll have to close out the remaining two trades for losses, be we'll get those losses back, I guarantee. Still a lot of time before the day ends though.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
I have changed the stats page over from www.MT4Live.com to www.MT4Stats.com and will probably leave it there because it give a little more complete profile of the trades with the 'Analysis" tab. Just click on the link in the signature below, sorry for the inconvenience.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
The mtstat already doens't work.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
olachico, I think he meant MT4live because that is where it was at before. MT4Stats is working fine for me.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
my usd/cad also closed with a big profit. Eur/GBP is sitll going with -90 pips. I won't close it because of this scene, I am expecting it to hit .9040 and then hopefully it will go up my way.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
No, I meant mt4stats. At the time I posted, it was down. But now it's back for me.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Hi mer and other traders, some of you have gbp/chf on oversold and some of you have it on level 4/8 i used to have it on an oversold level i think 0/8 , but you have to change the P variable in the Murrey Meth Indicator from 64 to 32 then it will be right.. at least my gbpchf chart looks now like mer's one he posted earlier. dont know if we have to change this variable for all pairs, i have it so far only changed on gbpusd and gbpchf, maybe we should change it on all gbp pairs ? dont know ... but its important that we all have the same charts ... i dont think data feed makes such a big difference we are working daily here ... cool system mer, keep the good work coming... happy trading all ...

--- 帖子 #154 ---
forgot to post a pic of the gbpchf thats how it looks like to me now ... hope this helps

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Hi mer &amp; traders newbie question From post #6 I quote Only look for short entries if price is above the 8/8, +1/8, or +2/8 So I can not understand why did you take the short trade on the EU. On my chart , price was bellow the 8/8,+1/8,+2/8 I am probably missing something Pls advice Tks david4u

--- 帖子 #156 ---
It took me several times reading it to understand it myself. It's all in how you interpret those sentences. What he means is that if the price is ABOVE 8/8, +1, or +2 which is all in the overbought area, do not look to go long. Only consider shorts. Vice versa if the candle is at or below 0/8. Below 0/8 only consider going long and not short because chances are, it's going to turn around soon and head back up. Anywhere above 0/8 up to 7/8, you can go long or short. I hope that answered your question! If not, let me know and I'll try again

--- 帖子 #157 ---
My chart looks like yours as well, but I didn't have to change any values. If the Murrey indicator is going to recalculate, it will generally recalculate when a new candle opens. kellera6 hit it right on the head. Once you go above 8/8 or below 0/8, these are considered extremely overbought/oversold areas and trades have a very strong tendency to rebound from these areas (as you can see in my Eur/Jpy trade), which makes shorts below 0/8 or longs above 8/8 very, very risky. Anywhere in between, you can go either long or short but pay attention to the lots size recommendations.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Here are the pairs that have possible setups tonight: Eur/Usd- short Eur/Gbp- short Eur/Jpy- short Gbp/Chf- long Gbp/Cad- long Eur/Cad- long (if it finishes strong) We will be closing out our active Eur/Gbp and Eur/Jpy trades for a loss and re-opening them and increasing the lots to 8 &amp; 4 lots respectively.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
hi there, agreed on the first 4 pairs, the last 2 g/c and e/c which I don't trade. Lets hope we have a great day again, another 50min left for the day to end with my GMT

It looks like the Stealth V.2's Trailing Step is functioning well and I will continue to use it from here on out. Trades I've taken: Eur/Usd-Short- TP-94, SL-160, BE-47, BES-24, and TS-12, 8 lots Eur/Gbp-Short- TP-72, SL-180, BE-36, BES-18, and TS-9, 8 lots Eur/Jpy-Short- TP-118, SL-200, BE-59, BES-30, and TS-15, 4 lots Gbp/Chf-Long- TP-212, SL-290, BE-106, BES-53, and TS-26, 8 lots Gbp/Cad-Long- TP-126, SL-370, BE-63, BES-32, and TS-16, 4 lots Eur/Cad-Long- TP-100, SL-150, BE-50, BES-25, and TS-12, 8 lots Aud/Nzd-Long- TP-36, SL-90, BE-18, BES-9, and TS-5, 4 lots I'm sorry, I must have missed the Aud/Nzd a couple of posts up and got in a little late.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Some of my numbers are different than yours. Is your Eur/Cad long target 1.5991 and SL is 1.5747?

--- 帖子 #162 ---
If Aud/usd finishes strong then i will take a short on that one.

Hi Mer and fellow traders, First, Mer, thanks for sharing this system it looks really promising. ( my first time ever post in forex factory, anyway). I made 2 screenshots to show that daily candle close time makes big difference in MM lines. The two pics are: Alpari UK and CollectiveFX daily demo charts with GBPCHF. There's one hour difference between the two close. In the case of Alpari extrem overshoot -2/8 holds as support the big swing, in the case of Collective FX the extrem overshoot 2/8 serves as resistance for the big swing which means a 4 level shift between the two chart. All MM indicator parameters are identical and default, the only difference is in broker time.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Yes, those are correct, but I personally like to take a few pips off the TP and add a few pips to the SL as a precautionary measure. And remember, we will have different spreads from broker to broker which can make everyone's figure different. Just go by what your chart is providing for you . It doesn't have to match mine exactly.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
a/u did't make it, I am in with e/u, e/j, e/g and chf/u. u/cad past 2/3rd and not take it

--- 帖子 #166 ---
mer071898 I'm in all of the trades today. Did well with yesterday's trade...losses didn't hurt too bad...profitable. Thanks for teaching us. Steve

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Like I said, you'll get losses, but again, you'll hit one of huge trend movements that'll get you 3 or 4 huge trades to make up for that.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
I see for example EURGPB TP 72 SL 180 Regardless of the end results of this trade why do you enter a trade wich such a RR ? Probably I am missing what the EA is doing in order no to exit at the HARD SL ... tks david4u

--- 帖子 #169 ---
The 180 SL you mentioned above is just an emergency stop only. I have only had this hit maybe a half dozen times in the whole time I've been trading this strategy. The Stealth EA's purpose or function is that when the price moves a certain distance (half of the TP in my case) the EA will move the stops for you to protect any profits you have accumulated. If this level is not reach and the candle closes on the opposite side of the Murrey Level we originally breached, the trade is closed out well before the emergency stop is triggered. Please make sure read the whole thread, this was already explained this is post #3: +++Everyone, please to read through the whole thread before asking your questions. I'm not saying that I won't help, but this will save having to answer questions over and over that couldv'e been answered already by reading through the thread. And if you still have questions, then post it here, thank you.+++ (not to be specifically aimed just at you david4u)

My Eur/Cad trade has closed out @ BES with 25 pips for a profit of $1872.13 with 8 lots. My Gbp/Cad trade has closed out @ BES with 32 pips for a profit of $1197.79 with 4 lots. All other trades are still active.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
I read earlier you set your tp a little short of next MM line and sl a little beyond MM line. I didn't do that. Therefore my Ecad hasn't hit the b/e point at 1/2 of my tp. My Gcad did and I'm in a free trade now which is much more comfortable. Great method. Thank you so much. Will take a few more days till I'm executing perfectly which is my goal. Steve

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Now don't go too crazy, I only give away a few pips off my projected TP target and a few past past the SL. You don't want to give away too much of your profit, but as you can imagine, I've seen it miss a Murrey Level by one or two pips.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
gotcha; thanks; maybe 5 pips less.......... Egbp just went to b/e.........free trade now....used smaller lot size since the tp is at MM6 level. Steve

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Hi Mer, first of all: this strategy is highly recommendable because most elements of it are based on price. That's never a mistake. Regarding your money management I have some questions, though. I see you use the d'Alembert progession (you call it semi-martingale), that's fine with me 'cause it works great for scalp trades, too. But: let's assume you have to enter all pairs on the same day (extreme case). The days before you had some losers, some winners. 1. Do you only increase lot size on those who were losers? 2. Could it be that sometimes the whole bets you have to place can overwhelm your account size? Example: Trade ONE 4 lots Trade TWO 2 lots Trade THREE 6 lots and so on Easily those bets can exceed the account size and margin. 3. How do you calculate your increase: By lot or percentage? I see you're working with lot, so we have to assume you're handling a huge chunk of money on the forex and you don't really care about this "never risk more than 3% of your account" mantra. 4. TO ALL: Is there a MM-Tool (a really good one) that can cover this strategy? Thanx again for this great strategy and apologies for my bad english.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Hey mer071898, im still very new to forex, and ive been using a wide range of strategies the last 2months, testing and all, but i must admit your system has to be the simplest of them all, ive started using it yesterday and entered 4 trades today and all 4 are in the money so far. Thank you very much for sharing,Great work and keep it up, i will be following this thread closely!! Cheers Dane

--- 帖子 #176 ---
eur/usd with great profit and still waiting the other 3 and they are all with positive

--- 帖子 #177 ---
How I do my Money management, I do put 2-1 so if I profit 1 I risk 2 which doesn't sound great I know, what I do is that I put an alert to my cell when price moves against me to 1-1 then I look at my trade carefully and if the price doesn't break myway and continues the wrong way then I close my trade, so that way I am still with 1-1 RR.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Please read post 169 plus throughout the thread MM is thoroughly explained. Its not fair every day for the same question to be put to a very giving professional trader willing to give up a little of his time to help us. Forgive me for stepping in; my intent is to help you and keep from wearing out mer071898. Steve

--- 帖子 #179 ---
thanks steve I will also read post 169 but I haven't asked the question though. I am just telling my way of MM

--- 帖子 #180 ---
ok now I have secured profit on all the trades that I have taken last night and it is all freeride from here on. Also my eur/jpy riched the full profit target but I am still riding it down due to the next sup line which it is around 135.00 area but I will make sure I will protect what I have so far...

--- 帖子 #181 ---
sorry fed; my mistake.....

--- 帖子 #182 ---
I understand I feel the same way as you when people post the same questions again and again and that is why I have shared my thougths as well. no worries

--- 帖子 #183 ---
by the way I have less then 20 pips more to go to hit my full profit with e/g.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Freewheelin, no apologies needed for the English, lol! I will answer these one by one: 1. Do you only increase lot size on those who were losers? Yes, I only increase the lot the on those trades that are losers. 2. Could it be that sometimes the whole bets you have to place can overwhelm your account size? Example: Trade ONE 4 lots Trade TWO 2 lots Trade THREE 6 lots and so on Easily those bets can exceed the account size and margin. Yes , that is always a possibility. That is why I traded this on the trading simulator I posted on the first post for as long as I did. I wanted to be sure on how many losses in a row could be possible so I could be confident in the increases. Also, I make sure that I have enough equity and margin in the account if I need it to at least cover up to 5-6 losses or more with no problem (which I'll probably never see). Say we go up to 6 losses, I would only need to be trading 96 lots (2+4+6+12+24+48), and on this demo right now, that wouldn't even be half my equity. When I use the semi-martingale approach, it doesn't expose my account to that exponential risk of a true martingale (2+4+8+16+32+64= 126 lots!). 3. How do you calculate your increase: By lot or percentage? I see you're working with lot, so we have to assume you're handling a huge chunk of money on the forex and you don't really care about this "never risk more than 3% of your account" mantra. First off, it's not that I don't care about the risk, because I do. I trade and accept the risk a little differently than everyone else and I'm comfortable with that. I do use lots instead of percentage because it's easier to calculate. Your risk level is up to you, if you only want to risk 3%, then by all means stick to what your comfortable with. If you don't want to double up on a loss, fine, don't do it. You could also go from 2 lots on a loss to 2.5 or 3 lots instead of doubling up. just do whatever you need to do to slowly recoup your losses. 4. TO ALL: Is there a MM-Tool (a really good one) that can cover this strategy? As I said in the beginning, use whatever MM or MM tools you think will help you with your own style of trading of this strategy. fed, if your comfortable with that, great! This only thing that concerns me is you may be closing trades way too early before they have a chance to run. A good example is the Eur/Usd last night (see pic). The candle had reversed on us and crossed back over the original breach and was in the hole by about -60 pips! Would you have closed that trade? If so, you lost money as the price dropped down and it looks like the target was hit right to the pip at 1.47705, crazy isn't it!. What if that was -100 pips or -200 pips and your emergency stop has been touched yet? You have to sometimes incur those types of drawdowns to let the trade breathe. This strategy is operating at roughly 83% accuracy right now and you have to trust the way it works.

I have a question regarding the stealth v2 EA. Must i set the enable trailing parameter to true? Cause I want to use the trailing step method. Is it right that i have to keep MT4 always on, if i use the stealth EA? Thx

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Here are my closed trades from last night: My Eur/Usd trade has closed out @ 48 pips (BES-24 pips + TS-12 pips x2) for a profit of $3840.00 with 8 lots My Eur/Gbp trade has closed out @ 27 pips (BES-18 pips + TS-9 pips x1) for a profit of $3538.88 with 8 lots My Eur/Jpy trade has closed out @ 60 pips (BES-30 pips + TS-15 pips x2) for a profit of $2605.83 with 4 lots My Aud/Nzd trade has closed out @ 9 pips (BES-9 pips) for a profit of $267.46 with 4 lots So far we've had a $13K+ day and my Gbp/Chf is still active with a triggered BES of 53 pips already locked in! I will be taking Aud/Nzd off and replacing it with Usd/Cad due to the low range and lack of separation between the Murrey Levels. I've been watching Usd/Cad on the side and the daily range has improved enough for me to add it.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Gotta love it

--- 帖子 #188 ---
I agree with you, how ever eur/usd was a scary one last night it did go close to -65 pips which I was targeting 87pips according to my broker info. So I came close to 1:1 ration and then usually these consolidation period forms and I look at it carefully if it will now break lower or will it continue up.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
woo hoooo eur/gbp just closed with a full profit By the way I am in live, with smaller lots for now but still I got great profit since I have started.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
It seems like it didn't take long to convince you Good call!

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Yes, if you want to use the Trailing Step, set it to true. Yes, in order for the EA to do it's job, the MT4 must be on. If you don't want to keep your computer on all the time, you could pay to use a VPS (Virtual Private Server). Then you can turn your own computer off and let the VPS run the MT4 and you can then access the VPS from your home computer, which is what I do.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
1 looser out of 7 trades that I took so far with my live account. 4 of the 6 winners were with full profit, the other 2 did BE with profit. And the loosing trade I did close it myself where I watched it carefully and it showed clearly that the price was heading to the wrong direction and I have closed the trade with 90 pips loss and I was aiming for 70 pips and that was the eur/gbp from yesterday.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Have closed Uchf, Gcad, Gaud, Eu, Ej, Enzd, Chf/jpy, and Aud/nzd winners with the stealth EA. Have a Gchf &amp; Egbp locked into profit with the EA. Am losing on Ucad, Gu, Gj (thought I'd be brave and try it; it still might pay). Am learning to tighten up tp and loosen sl a few pips. This is a great set it and forget it method. I'm using more pairs to experiement but will limit my pairs to those with best ATR before taking this live. God bless you all! Steve

--- 帖子 #195 ---
really cool ATR indy in left corner of chart above red arrow; change ATR to whatever setting you like and change multiplier to 1. Found at another thread on FF. Trying to decide what I'm missing by rarely referring to the T_S_D daily range calculator. How is it best used? I write notes in right hand corner for handy reference. Steve

--- 帖子 #196 ---
I just use it to determine if the average daily range is over 100.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Here are the pairs that have possible setups tonight: Eur/Jpy- short Gbp/Usd- long Gbp/Nzd- long Gbp/Chf is still active.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Wow, I must be doing something right; those were my picks too. One little nuance that you seem to look at is you want the open and close of the crossing candle to straddle the MM level. A wick that crosses the level doesn't count. Does this capture it? Oh, a note to you other IBFXers out there. Their D1 candle starts at 0000 hours GMT which is 2000 EDT (USA) This is an hour later than mer's.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Yes you are correct, the body of the candle must breach or straddle the Murrey Level. What this tells us is that the there's a probability that the support or resistance that this level provided is no longer valid. Trades I've taken for today: Eur/Jpy-Short- TP-150, SL-170, BE-75, BES-38, and TS-19, 4 lots Gbp/Usd-Long- TP-104, SL-150, BE-52, BES-26, and TS-13, 8 lots Gbp/Nzd-Long- TP-450, SL-540, BE-225, BES-112, and TS-56, 4 lots

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Scott, Love this method! How long have you been using this particular method to manage your forex diversification fund? I assume it is only one of the strategies you use?

--- 帖子 #201 ---
I was using 3 specific strategies with this one being the only long term strategy of the three. The other two were short term scalping strategies which, over the past 4-6 months as the markets have changed, have not produced the results I'd like to see. I have since dropped them and have fully focused on the long term strategy only. This allows me more time to develop and produce some business related material and spend more time on other projects.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Thanks for the update. I think I will replace the T_S_D daily range calculator with the ATR pips. Steve

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Scott, Thanks for the reply! This method seems to be pretty robust. I find myself wondering how well it would work in other markets like futures or equities? Have you ever tried it in other markets?

--- 帖子 #204 ---
A continuous market like forex doesn't really need ATR, just regular range. ATR was designed to take gaps into account on the daily bars of the stock market; today's opening price can be a significant distance from yesterday's close with stocks. ATR is useful, but the measurement will be almost exactly the same as regular range in forex.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
here are my 4 trades that I took tonight gbp/usd buy, gbp/chf buy, aud/jpy sell, eur/jpy sell. Good luck to all

--- 帖子 #206 ---
I have closed my gbp/chf trade, I have refreshed my page and it showed that it was in the overshoot +1/8, I think it changed the lines for tonight.... the others are ok. mer071898 were you actually refreshing them everynight?

--- 帖子 #207 ---
I have doule checked and replaced my gbpchf with gbp/aud quickly when it wasn't too late. gbp/aud closed right above 1/8 which is a better trade.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
hmmm...Mines mygbpaud is showing at 4/8 and 5/8 range. I think it really depends on the broker.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
wow I refreshed it again and it changed and now mine is the same as yours which is no trade. I have closed that one with a small profit to make up for the other small loss Edit: Ok If I change the P field from 32 to 64 then mine is same as yours, If I have 32 in the P field then it changes and gives you diff data..

--- 帖子 #210 ---
we are having a very active asian session tonight which is very unusual

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Tresuz, I only trade forex, so I haven't had any experience in other markets. fed, I reload the charts every day as a precaution to be up to the minute if possible. I don't want to be taking trade then magically the chart changes on me after it's placed. You may change whatever inputs you wish to change. Also, My Gbp/Chf trade has finally closed out @ BES for 53 pips for a profit of $4152.66 with 8 lots plus $.62 of swap. All the trades placed yesterday all ended up in profit for a grand total of $17,474.75, not bad for a day's work I would say.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
I don't think it can get better than that? Is that still demo?

--- 帖子 #213 ---
I keep my p at 64. This is the value that populated with the template

All, I know these are not recommended pairs, but they would be 'textbook' trades audjpy **Edit removed cadjpy and nzdjpy as the lines shifted as I accidently closed/reopen platform.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
There's nothing wrong with any pair, just be consistent and trade the strategy the same for each. I just prefer pairs that have some daily movement.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
aud/jpy closed with full profit, eur/jpy also secured some pips, from here on it is a free ride. bgp/usd is on the negative side. I am watching it closely, if it breaks out to the down side then most likely it won't go myway and I will close the trade at least to make it 1:1 RR.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
My Eur/Jpy trade has already closed out tonight @ BES for 57 pips (BES-38 pips + TS-19 pips x1) for a profit of $2496.80 with 4 lots

--- 帖子 #219 ---
hey, looks like my eur/jpy will be BES as well with in 15-20 pips, it is still an ongoing trade but it is getting there. g/u, I am wathing this level, if it breaks then this pair might have more of downside and I will close the trade.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Hi Mer, are the below statements based on back tested results or is this a general MM fact? Thanks If your profit target is the 4/8, 2/8, 6/8 0/8, or 8/8 = Use smaller lots as price will have more support and Resistance around these points and are more prone to reversals. If your profit target is the 1/8, 7/8, 3/8, or 5/8 = Use larger lots as price will have less support and Resistance around these points and are less prone to reversals. Edit: Ok figured it out. "The 0/8, 4/8, and 8/8 MML's are essentially equal to eachother in the sense that they have the most influence over price support and resistance. The 0/8, 4/8, and 8/8 MML's are followed by the 2/8 and the 6/8 MML's, which are in turn followed by the 3/8 and 5/8 MML's. Finally, the 1/8 and the 7/8 MML's have the least influence over price support and resistance". ( www.foretrade.com )

--- 帖子 #221 ---
mmperiod 15 it's ok? edit: what's P for in the indi? edit 2: after figuring it out myself, I noticed that a template was present in the package, lol

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Scott=bloomin genius! All my trades closed in profit or locked into profit and still running. I learned from you to set tp just a little less and sl just a little more. Saved my hide on both ends. Proves the power of Murrey Math lines. Disappointed in getting stopped out with a smaller profit sometimes but its so much better than my managing the trade. I can become very dangerous to myself. Thanks for great teaching in this thread. Steve

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Yes! So far this seems like it's too good to be true! I keep trying to find the weakness...Scott, have you ever experienced days where every trade went to the full emergency stop? How often does this happen?

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Guys, I'll just say what Scott will say: there will be losses, sometimes multiple losses in a row. Sometimes your emergency stop will be hit. Just because things are going well right not, don't be lulled into thinking you've found the hold grail. It does not exist.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
LOL, that's too bad We definitely had another amazing day!

--- 帖子 #226 ---
The Hold Grail..thats a new one lol. It does exist, of course it does. Its you. Scott knows what to expect, he has back tested his method. He doesn't care whether it might lose or whether it might win. All he knows is that he has to press the buttons when a signal appears. Don't get too excited about your wins, they will cover future losses. Don't get too down about losses as you'll have future wins. If you let your emotions get to you and think too much you will miss the juicy trades that will make your profits. Its the same with any trading edge.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Perfect! It's going good now, but you have to expect that sometime maybe tomorrow, next week, next month, there will be losses as Mer has stated. With that said, close the thread! j/k lol. Seriously, people should venture out and try multiple strategies along with this strategy, as they might find the 'Holy grail' within multiple strategies!

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Agreed. And I fully understand this. I'm just trying to understand what kind of drawdowns we might typically expect and if this method is consistently profitable over the long haul. There's always bumps in the road! I'd just like to know if I need big knobby off-road tires or if regular street tires will do

--- 帖子 #229 ---
I'll tell you this, with any strategy you'll have weaknesses. The thing is, how you deal with the weaknesses is what make your strategy stronger. That is why I double up on my losses, to overcome the weakness. With regards to the emergency stops, I can tell you this much, they can and will be hit on occasion, especially if the Murrey Lines are tightly grouped on a volatile pair or if a huge news spike arises (like the NFP). In the few years I've demo and live traded this I have hit the emergency stop over a dozen times at the most only because we normally close out the bad trades well before it is an issue. I can say I've never had all my trades hit the emergency stop in one day, and you probably never will because there is too much diversification with multiple open trades, so I wouldn't worry too much about that. I will never claim this to be a "holy Grail" at any time during thread as we all know by now it doesn't exist, period! What I urge you all to do is to take the Trading Simulator and play with it over a weekend or something. Use it to look back and you'll see what I have seen, consistency . Even with the losses I've had, I was able to consistently bank profitable trades because I trusted my trades and trusted how the market will react to these levels. I personally think that even when the market goes through it's normal changes over time, this strategy will survive because it is based on mathematical facts and not speculation or sentiment. It is emotionless and cold, not letting greed overtake the situation. Let's be honest though, do I wish every trade goes right to the target? Yes. Am I upset that I lost 3/4's of the pips I should have had? A little. If you become emotional when you trade, you might as well give up now and not waste your time and money. Just give it to me and I'll save you the agony. Once you realize that once your emotions are in check that trading becomes more mathematical and analytical. You have to understand that this is a business, and in this business you main goal in trading is to have strong, consistent profits over the long haul, not the short term. That's why Warren Buffet does not flip stocks, he holds them over time to let them mature. And he looks for the most consistent stocks to buy, he does not just pick any old stock and hopes it goes his way.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
As for the trading, both of my other two trade have close out for profit. My Gbp/Usd trade has closed out @ BES with 52 pips for a profit of $4160.00 with 8 lots. My Gbp/Nzd trade has closed out @ Target with 443 pips for a profit of $12,925.39 with 4 lots. that is a grand total of $19,582.19 for yesterday's trades. We are now over 2100+ pips in roughly over 3 weeks of trading. Just to let everyone know that I will be traveling out of town tonight and will not be able to place any trades as I will be on a plane. I will be back Thursday night for trading though and I will have my laptop with me to check in on everything. The only thing I would warn everyone on is with all the movement we have had, be very cautious of retraces and would advise to use lower lot as a precautionary measure.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Scott: Thanks for more wisdom from you. This is first winning strategy for me that I have so little emotion attached...place entry, let EA manage it and try not to touch anything. At the end of the day, close losers according to 1 rule, keep any active trades still open that meet new entry rules and of course load up new entries according to several real easy to learn rules. Tried doubling up successfully today...brilliant! And you handled the doubters with alot of respect. You did this to help people. Please know you have helped me more than I can thank you. I owe you! Now I have my first edge in forex after 3 years of failure. Thanks, thanks, thanks! Steve PS: I have another winning method that requires reentering with limit orders every 60-70 pips; I was thinking of expanding my use of it till you came along. This is much safer, even with the doubling up occassionally.

Wow! Its been a long time that I obtain similar results as my mentor. Look how good you teach others! S

Thanks stevewide, and I appreciate the comments. I have had many people from this forum help and guide me along the way and I felt I should do the same. My strategy is not for everyone, but for those who use it and find that it has helped you, you are more than welcome.

I made a spreadsheet so I can enter the pertinent numbers and it calculates the Stealth EA's inputs for me. Here are my trades for tonight. EURNZD I'm a little worried about because it breached 2 levels but it's only 1 lot anyway. http://i37.tinypic.com/2vl9s45.jpg

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Same trades except Eur/Nzd, Gbp/Nzd and Eur/Jpy. Eur/Nzd, Gbp/Nzd breached more than one Murray Level(gbp/nzd not in a clearly/decisive way). Eur/Jpy closed at about 2/3 of the way to the 5/8 target Murrey level. Didn't trade them because I'm usually conservative. edit: anyway eur/jpy already reached TP

4 out of 4 last night , here are my entries tonight e/u sell, a/u sell, chf/usd buy. gbp/aud, eur/gbp and eur/cad are also great entries as well.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
I also took gbp/aud buy since it is still not late....

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Did someone say watch for retrace?

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Fed, What is your status on your current trades? I opened three trades on my demo account last night with V1.2...had EURGBP close as BES for about 17 pips, but the EURUSD and USDCAD are down around -100 pips each currently. US Unemployment Claims and Advance GDP Price Index being negative for the USD might have set us up for a big hit for these pairs.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
I took a 50 pip hit on the usdcad and my gbpaud is around -120 pips right now. However, I did get over 60 pips on the gbpcad and 36 pips on the eurgbp!

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Did you manually close the USDCAD trade? What price was your stop set to?

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Edit** Nope. My stoploss was at 64 pips which was hit

--- 帖子 #247 ---
First thanks for getting the correct files to me, now have them loaded all seem to be working except the Stealth EA. I can load either one, both show in the upper right corner but with a frown rather than a smile, any ideas, please help.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
mer, did you take any trades today ? im asking because i dont see any open positions in your metatrader stats.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
177 pips lost on the gbpaud. No big deal, I will get it back.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
rim, Have you enabled EA's in your MT4 platform? That might be the problem.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Hi Everyone new MM guy here, but looks great so far Ok I can see there quite a few potential trades looming for later here. But one question, looking at the GBPCHF would that be considered a bit risksy due to the fact that PA as made it way up from just above 3/8, gone through 4/8 to 5/8 ? or will anyone be taking that looking for it to go to 6/8 cheers ab1

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Hello, Hello. I assume you placed your SL on the 5/8 ML (green). Well, this is not the way MER is placing his emergency stops. The correct stop would be the 4/8 (blue) line, so there's plenty of time and space for the trade to run into profit. Only wanted to let you know. OR, if I'm wrong about this - tell me, please.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
you are right

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Hey Free, Your probably correct! I just recognize that I did that I made a lot of trades since last night using diff strategies, so I made an error. Thanks for pointing out to me.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Hi, If you mean the bar that broke 5/8 and was going to 6/8 (see attachment) i personally didnt take it, not because of price action but because it closed to near to the next murray level so R/R is not good anymore ... if it closes today over 6/8 im in, im not seeing any major resistance in the area between 6/8 and 7/8 , so trend could go on. happy trading

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Hey Free, In my chart I posted, Do you know if todays candle would close back under the 5/8 ML would that signal a sell? Would we close the buy for a lost and open a sell?

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Hi Have you turned on the Expert Advisor Button. Ive marked it with a Black arrow? Attached Image (click to enlarge) ab1

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Well, well, well. Did I tell you or did I tell you we were going to have some retraces! That's why I warned everyone to use lower lots because the market will have to correct itself at some point. Let's catch up 11 out of 12 pairs had trades last night, the lone one who didn't was Gbp/Chf. Over half have had big retraces back over the original breach. Now don't get too panicky as some of these may still close back into safe territory, some won't. Stick with the rules and it will all work out. First off Stevegee, I like the spreadsheet but I had one question. Does the "current price" column indicate the actual current price or the price the candle closed at? rim47, Either the Expert Advisor is turned off or it's not enabled under your tools&gt;options (see pics).

--- 帖子 #259 ---
As far as I'm concerned it would be a valid short trade. And there's the weakness of this strategy - if the market decides to oscillate around one ML you can get into a lot of trouble. BUT: Chances are that other trades are real huge "homeruns".

--- 帖子 #260 ---
itrader, read through the thread! I told everyone just yesterday that I will be on a plane and will not be able to post any trades. hello, Freewheelin is correct you were up one level too far for your stop. You must always double check you settings. You are on a daily timeframe so there is plenty of time to go back and double check everything. ab1, this would've been a no trade for me because the candle did not breach either the 5/8 or the 6/8. hello, yes, in a normal setup you would close the bad trade and open a short trade if it closes below the 5/8.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
sry, i didnt saw this particular post

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Hi Mer, glad to see you're back, so I can ask you a question. Do you enter trades today (rollover from thursday to friday)? And if so - do you stick to the positions 'till monday or do you close on friday night? Sorry if this question has been answered yet, didn't recognize.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Thanks for the explanation! I'm trading 0.01 lots, so it did not hurt too bad

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Like I said, you are going to run into situations where a lot of trades will go the wrong way. What you have to do is be patient, suck up the loss (which I warned you to use lower lots), and wait for the next setups. Use some common sense and look at the chart, if you feel that the retrace will possibly not reach the target Murrey Level, again use smaller lots to be safe. The good thing is when we see big moves and price retraces, this is where we get those 3-5 good trades in a row because price is searching out the fib extensions from your retraces. If you look at the two pics, I've drawn fibs to show possible target areas to look forward to.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Hi Mer Yes Dumb question.... I realised I'd make a mistake afterwards. The very 1st post clearly states that we are looking for a close to take place to make it valid. SO if it closes above 5/8 tonight then its valid.. although theres a fair bit of resistance around that area, do you consider that with this system and if so how ?....please cheers ab1

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Yes, I will enter trades everyday. The only thing you have to aware of is the gaps that can occur on opening of Sunday candles (if you get them). Most of the time the candle are very, very small and do not affect the trades unless our Friday close is close to the Murrey line. You can tackle them two ways: Since gaps in the market have a tendency to fill themselves, which means the gravitate back toward the Friday close, You can see if it will open above or below (depending if your long or short) and fill back in (and just hope it doesn't go the opposite way) or; Follow the rules of the strategy as you would any other day. The only exception to that rule is that I will not place any trades on that Thursday night before the Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) news.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Mer Just out of interest if you add a Kumo Cloud from Ichimuko to the chart, the flat spot on the top of the cloud (marked by arrows), is a previous area of major resistance and can act like a magnet to price. It is almost exactly in the same area as the 61.8 fibo line. I dont know what that means exactly apart form further confirmation where price may be heading. Didnt mean to bring ichimuko into this but just thought it an interesting observation. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Cheers ab1

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Great, thanx for the answer. Besides the NFP - Friday I would suggest to be carefull every three months with those days when all options expire and so on. I don't know how you call them in english (something with "witch" ?). Great work, Mer !

--- 帖子 #269 ---
ab1, as long as it follows the rules of the strategy, it is a valid trade. The only support and resistance I'm concerned about is whether my Murrey Levels are providing it for me. If there is different S &amp; R in play that has affected the trade and caused a loss, then I deal with that by managing the lot sizes on the next trade. The only other things I may use in my decisions are certain price action setups or fibs. Sometimes those will show you a little something that you just can't see otherwise. Look at the Eur/Usd in the pic for example, I pulled a fib from the current swing and I am looking for a retrace back to the 50 or 61.8 fib. The 6/8 Murrey line is smack dab in the middle of both of them. What we also see, if any of you have been through the James 16 thread (highly recommended), is that we have a price action setup occurring with a bullish outside bar forming. If you don't know what that is I've attached a PDF of some setups you can watch out for. It is this: BULLISH OUTSIDE BAR • Bar 2 engulfs bar 1 • Close of bar 2 is higher than open and close of bar 1, preferably two thirds of way up or more • Direction is up Armed with this additional information, if this setup holds true I can then determine if I would like to use a larger lot size here, even though, according to the strategy rules, we generally use lower lots through the 5/8.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
That current price is a little hazy in my mind as well. It ended up being the price at which I entered. This was very close to the open price of the new bar but wasn't the same due to the time to enter the orders, etc.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Another example of how fibs can help determine your lot size. What I've noticed over the years is that the GBP pairs have a knack for retracing to the 76.4 fib a lot. On the Gbp/Usd, we see the retracement back to the 76.4 bouncing right off the 8/8 Murrey line, but on the last major downswing we also see a confluence with the 86 fib (purple). Remember what I posted earlier? The 86 fib signals weakness in the trend and we could be poised for a reversal. Using this info and the fact we have not seen a retrace in 5 candles alerts me to say "Hey, even though this is a possible long setup, I should use extremely low lots because of the reversals signs I'm seeing, then load up on the short trades that might follow." The original strategy will work just fine until you can grasp these other tools and use them to your advantage. First thing is to get a feel of the original strategy then slowly work these in to help fine tune your options.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Thanks Mer Good detailed answer, Price action and candle formation are my favorites, so Im loving this method. I was using a very successful PA/candle formation method a few months back on daily TF's. It was great and made good pips, but unfortunately the set ups didnt happen that often, so I sort of strayed away from it....but I think this could be the missing link for me that the other method didnt have. Cheers ab1

--- 帖子 #273 ---
That's okay, because honestly that is what it should be because that is where you calculate everything from. The only problem is it probably doesn't figure in the spread in the calculations, which may throw your target off a little.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Hey Scott could you be a little more specific with some guidelines on "extremely low" lot sizes are? In the core system you refer to "larger" and "smaller" lot sizes; these terms appear to map to "larger" being 2X the size of "smaller" in your statements. I was thinking maybe "extremely small" would be 1, "small" would be 2 and "larger" would be 4. Does this make sense?

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Oh just one thing anyone please... Are we using the "Stealth" v2 now ? because thats the one that the template loads up with. ab1

--- 帖子 #276 ---
hi mer, My MM lines on the GBPUSD chart looks diffrent than yours. I use a Parameter of 64 for MM indicator, after i have switched to 32 my chart looks like yours. So, which setting should we use?

--- 帖子 #277 ---
It's hard to really nail down an exact size but you can go with this rough guideline. Let's say the larger trade is "X". If you are to use smaller lots I use 1/2 of "X". Extremely low lots are 1/4 of "X" or less. Generally, the max you want to use per trade should be based on 1 lot per $10,000. So if you have $100K, the max per trade would be 10 lots for a larger trade, 5 lots for a smaller trade and 2.5 lots or less for extremely low trades. if you trade $5K, larger trades would be .5 lots, smaller trades would be .25 lots, and extremely low lots would be .125 lot or less. You can use any lot size below the max per trade an be very safe with this strategy. I roughly use 1/2 to 3/4 of the max per trade to be a little safer and allow more room to increase on my losses. You may use either one you desire. V.2 has the added trailing step function.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Having room to double down after a loser makes sense. I suppose the theory is that you're already using smaller lot sizes on trades where you anticipate problems. In those cases, you just double down and reverse on an already smallish trade. Worst case, you might be faced with doubling down on a "larger" lot size. This shouldn't happen as often since your larger lot size trades were placed because you anticipated better odds of success.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Yes, your catching on. I will also try and do some fib and price action analysis on a few of tonight's trade to show everyone a little of what I look for.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Just out of interest Ive taken your first posts from this thread and turned them into a PDF (attached) for my own reference, so Ive got a hard copy to look at &amp; I dont have to keep going back and forth to the begining of the thread whilst Im learning the system. cheers ab1 Attached File(s) Murrey Math Mers Method.pdf 333 KB | 2,122 downloads

hi, I have opened total of 4 trades and I have also got the BES with eur/gbp about 30 pips, the other 3 I had to close them out with a min loss with due to retracements and I haven't kept them open for the whole day because the trades were going against me and I also have my own way of out as well before the trade goes against me fully so that I don't loose more. What I do is in the 15 min chart I place a line between the high and low and if it breaks that line then I decide if the trade is good or bad

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Quick question Ive only just got into this thread so Ive got some catching up to do. Im looking at all the charts and if things stay pretty much as they are I see the following trades could be coming up:- EURUSD long, heading for even level, with not much head room so smaller lot size GBPJPY long, heading for odd level so ok to go with bigger lot EURCAD short, same as above GBPCHF long - heading for even but has loads of room so big or small lot ? anyone agree/disagree ab1

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Guys MM lines are very powerfull so far. I am also using them my own way of trading for the past 3 days and so far it is all positive, last night I had 7 trades and all were positive again. I will not share it yet due to it is too early. When I am more in to this strategy then I will open a new thread.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
hi, mer - great job on the thread - thanks for sharing! has anybody tried this out on lower TFs?

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Ive noticed that most of you guys have a big price displayed in the bottom left hand corner, thats not on mine ? Any ideas please. ab1

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Hello everyone, Thank Mer for sharing this profitable system. I trade forex for 2 years usisn scalper strategies most of the time. Sometimes i win, sometimes i lost. That's forex. Now i'm looking for a non stress strategy and i thin that this a good system. Now my question. The broker server time is diferent among the brokers. IBFX use GMT, Alpari use GMT-1. What time should we use to place the orders? Now we are at 22.40 GMT. Should we place orders at 23.00 GMT or at 24.00 GMT? Good trades and thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
All orders are placed at 00:00 GMT Okay here's the plan for tonight. First off the two I showed before: Eur/Usd-Long-Bullish outside bar has formed hoping to retrace to the 61.8. I will use larger lots on this one. Gbp/Usd-Long- With the strong confluence ahead I will tak a long with extremely low lots.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Gbp/Jpy-Long Normal trade with larger lots, just watch for resistance near the double top. Usd/Cad-Short_ Heavy confluence at the 76.4 and 161.8 Extension from the shorter fib. Larger lots can be used.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
Gbp/Chf-Long-No retrace yet and pin bar formed, use extremely low lots. Good movement off the 50 fib though, could go either way. Eur/Cad-Short- Heavy confluence at the 76.4 fib and the 138.2 Extension. Price is having a tough time getting past this.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Mer So can I just clear something up then please. The collective FX is 00:12 currently and a new candle has formed, but 0:00GMT isnt for another 48 mins. So we are waiting then for 01:00 on Collective FX, 1 hour into the new candle is that right ? Many thanks ab1

--- 帖子 #292 ---
You want 00:00 on your broker's time , not actual GMT time.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Ah... thats what I thought, it seemed a bit weired we would wait for another hour thanks ab1

--- 帖子 #294 ---
0000 for my broker (IBFX) is also at 0000 GMT which is in about half an hour. I've been opening my trades at the same time as Scott which is about a half an hour ago. I've been cheating a little.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Trades taken: Eur/Usd-Long- TP-52, SL-196, BE-26, BES-13, and TS-6, 8 lots Gbp/Usd-Long- TP-40, SL-210, BE-20, BES-10, and TS-5, 2 lots Gbp/Jpy-Long- TP-152, SL-490, BE-76, BES-38, and TS-19, 6 lots Gbp/Chf-Long- TP-216, SL-280, BE-108, BES-54, and TS-27, 2 lots Usd/Cad-Short- TP-46, SL-200, BE-23, BES-12, and TS-6, 8 lots Eur/Cad-Short- TP-80, SL-180, BE-40, BES-20, and TS-10, 8 lots

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Shouldn't the SL on GBPUSD be around 200 pips, and USDCAD be about 190?

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Shame on you Steve, no cutting corners now!

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Yes, Steve, it should. I just caught that as I went through and double checked (hint, hint) my settings. Did the same thing on Eur/Usd and Usd/Cad. That's what can happen when you're in a rush so be sure to go back and check, thanks for the post Steve even though I would have caught it.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Ah, you should be using my spreadsheet then! LOL

--- 帖子 #300 ---
I might just have to try it out next week, but I was running behind tonight trying to post up some chart examples.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Here are my calculations. They're very close to Scott's numbers. http://i37.tinypic.com/33nw1vp.jpg

--- 帖子 #302 ---
I am also trading it with 1 hour for the past 3 days and they were all positive trades. I don't want to discuss it here becuase I want this thread to stay as is.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
I agree, fed - thanks.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Thanks everyone for your suggestions. I had already checked all the obvious reasons still did nit help, so I cycled down the computer and fired back up and it now is working just fine. Still a question about the EA if we set the real values for TP/SL and TS does anyone know what valuesthe dealer sees?

--- 帖子 #305 ---
How often do the values for the MM Lines recalculate? It appears that the values from last night and tonight are the same, at least on the GBP/JPY. I have closed and reopened the chart but no change in value. Thanks in advance to any who help with the answer.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Hey all!! Just finished reading through the whole thread... Very fascinating and must offer public thanks to Mer for this fantastic system. Already in demo up for 13 pips (trading 1 lot for a profit of $ 130.00 on EU). Anyways, if following correctly the rules, the SL on GU should be around 440 pips and not 200. I attach a chart for you to see. Greetings from Mexico!

--- 帖子 #307 ---
The inputs of the EA are internally coded so the broker sees nothing, that's the whole purpose of it. rim, sometimes the Murrey indicator may not change for several weeks. If it does change it will usually change when a new candle opens. chano, Your chart does not look anything like mine. Do you have the Murrey indicator set to 1440? Have you tried reloading the indicator or template? If so it could be different data with your broker.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Morning Just out of interest I had a bit a trouble for some reason with the charts on The Collective, I think its seems to have resolved itself now, but because of that I scanned through loads of demo accounts Ive got and some of the data in the TSR was a lot different. The closest alternative I came up with that has the same Market Watch as the collective was FXCM , which also has as many pairs as the collective. I see were down a little this morning on last nights trades, at least I placed all the same trades as Mer, which goes to show I was listening and all the reading on my first day in this thread paid off. So, one question.....I have six trades open, so am I right in saying that I only close any bad ones at 0:00 tonight. What I mean by that is any that close above/below the Murrey level that I opened with are considered bad. cheers ab1

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Mer I see in your trades last night that your TS is half of your Breakeven Shift, Ive adjusted mine accordingly, but in your opening instructions on how to use the system you suggest making that the same as the breakeven shift. Any reason why you changed that or was that an error ? ab1

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Nice spreadsheet steve, do you have a spare one? (I am assuming it calculates automatically based on the manual input of the first 6 columns?). Cheers

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Mer Sorry to bombard you with questions but from my part theres a few things Id like to discuss when you have a min. I want to deal with lot sizes, I can see why you went for maximum lots sizes on the USDCAD, EURCAD, ie we are under 2/3 distance to our target and the target is an odd level. Likewise I concur with the choices on everything else and the decision to go with small lots. But the EURUSD does not have a lot of headroom to the next level and the level is even, so that would have meant to me be careful with this one. Is it because it has a supporting candle pattern (Engulfing Bull). So therefore do strong candle patterns overide the basic set up rules. Such as engulfing, pins, inside bars etc. many thanks ab1

--- 帖子 #312 ---
I see that the n the mt4 stats there aren't the new trades of this night. Are you using a real account now?

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Hi I think you will find it in the attachments section of the thread. cheers ab1

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Thanks. I looked earlier but must have skipped over it.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Its on the 1st page, its only one of two excel documents in there, I think its called "Murrey calc" cheers

--- 帖子 #316 ---
As I noted last night, my broker (IBFX) has a different start time for their daily bar than Scott's broker. I've been cheating a little by doing my calculations and entering trades at the same time as Scott even though my own daily bars hadn't closed yet. I'm confident enough in my own analysis that I'm going to shift my analysis/trade time to the IBFX daily bar open; that's an hour later than Scott's broker. I improved the calculator spreadsheet I've been using and attached it as well. The SL, TP, etc results are expressed in a whole number of pips now and I moved the lot size column to the left side (just cosmetic). The lot size column isn't involved in the calculations at all. It's just there to give me a convenient place to put it after I've done my analysis. Just enter the trade direction (long or short), the breached MM line value, the MM lines above and below it and the trade entry price. The result cells are then filled in. After you enter the trade, just enter the resulting values into the Stealth EA and fire it up.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Hi! Great strategy with impressive results! One thing I don't understand is how people can be making their calculations at different times? The market doesn't adjust itself according to what broker you use! If we want to replicate Scotts results I believe we should at least be using the same start time (23.00GMT) if not the same broker. It cost nothing to download the collective fx demo and use it to make the calculations.. we can still place trades in our regular accounts. Just my opinion, thanks

--- 帖子 #318 ---
you only close bad trades if the breach back over the original Murrey level and close, otherwise the trade is held. That is an error, you can make it whatever size you want, I prefer 1/2 of the BES. Read post #269 again. I say at the end: "Armed with this additional information, if this setup holds true I can then determine if I would like to use a larger lot size here, even though, according to the strategy rules, we generally use lower lots through the 5/8." If is the key word. I decided to use larger lots, that doesn't mean you have to. I don't think your grasping the concept of trading this strategy your own way. Just because I trade it a certain way is not the same as the way you would trade it. You need to develop your own patterns of trading and make you own conclusions on what the charts tell you. olachico, MT4Stats is down temporarily. I've put it back on MT4lLive for now. I can't force anyone to use my broker, which is okay. Everyone just need to make sure that you use the 00:00 bar of your broker. Yes, the results may differ, but the concept is still the same. And thanks Steve for the updated spreadsheet. I'll be loading this up on Sunday to see how it works out.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Here's a good example of a different brokers data. Notice on the FXDD demo we would not have even been in this trade. It goes to show that different brokers may yield you much different results.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Just to be clear on the time to enter a trade. In post #288 you state GMT is the correct time to enter after the MML breach and then in post #292 you say that the trade or rather the line breach should be at your broker's 00:00 time. I believe that I have seen GMT mentioned in a couple of other places in this thread as well. Please clarify. Also, in post #286 ab1 had asked about the large numbers that show in the lower left hand corner but I do not see the answer, did I miss it?

--- 帖子 #321 ---
You want 00:00 on your broker's time , not actual GMT time. We've been talking about placing orders at the open of a new candle throughout this whole thread, I figured everyone has caught on to that by now. Whatever time 00:00 is on your broker, use that time, end of story. Sorry, I have so many people asking questions I must have missed it. All it is is an indicator to enlarge the current price so it is easier to see and has nothing to do with the strategy.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Thanks for the clarification. The enlagered price indicator, is it yours or where do I get it?

--- 帖子 #323 ---
here you go

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Hi Mer Thanks for the responses to my questions, appreciate it as always However, its not about creating my own system or improvising, that will come in time as I understand it more, its just about getting a solid foundation of how the system works, prior to implementing it in my trading. I am only following your guidelines and if they start to differ from earlier posts, which they have, then with all due respect Im just wanting confirmation of why ? cheers ab1

--- 帖子 #325 ---
I was always a big fan of Murray levels...and thanks for your contribution. Regarding fiber(eurusd)....seems today wasn't a good trading day Yesterday's closing was above 5/8 level, and today's closing is back below 5/8. I assume it was a false signal, and long order must be closed at the market. Correct? Cheers.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Hehe. Currently I've taken a full stop-out on eurcad and everything else is underwater from last night's trades.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
hi stevegee So the way Im reading it is that all trades need to be closed in about 10 mins or so.... ab1

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Golly I don't know. IBFX stops trading in 3 minutes but I shouldn't be messing with trades for another 4 hours. I'll just let 'em ride until Sunday when the market re-opens. I have to say, I really don't like holding over the weekend though.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
fed, Did you have any losers from last night? Thankyou

--- 帖子 #330 ---
I know it wasn't a good day, I did take the trades the opposite way due to some sweet spots that the pairs reached and I was expecting the price would go the opposite way specially for eur/usd, usd/cad, gbp/usd, usd/jpy, eur/jpy, I still used the MM last night for the gbp/usd in 1 hr which gave me a signal for a short and I took it and it was a success. I usually trade using fib levels, trend lines and res/sup lines. I am adding the MM to it now and it is great.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
For 1 hour are you using MMperiod = 60 or 1440?

1440 and the 1st field which I forgot the name now I use 10 instead of 64 or 32. That will give you tighter stops, try it that way. I will message you what I do privately tonight when I get back from work... Believe me great results so far

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Thanks buddy! I will await your information. Thank you

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Attached you'll find an example of this strategies weakness. The white line represents the 2/8 MML (I highlighted the level). As you can see one has to increase lot size six times before a winner occurs. No big deal for some, but scary for others. Only wanted to share my observations. The indicator I used is attached and gives you the opportunity to do a (visual) backtest.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Please can you explain how you use MM here? Do you use 10/1440 on an 1 hour chart? Thanks

--- 帖子 #336 ---
80/20 Rule in action

--- 帖子 #337 ---
One possible solution is to wait to see if the 2nd signal (short) can close below the open of the 1st signal (long). This would prevent opening so many reversing positions. Just a suggestion for what its worth.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Well, that's the problem - you'll never know. Missing the "homeruns" can hurt.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
I can't here though, I will open a new thread how I use it with 1hr chart. Iwill open a new thread for it. I do use it 10/1440 settings.

All, GbpUsd Analysis UP? Anyone else?

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Hi Hows that ? all mine ended in losers ? What pairs and signals did you go with....I must not be getting this..... many thanks ab1

--- 帖子 #342 ---
GBPUSD reversed when it hit the 8/8 line. Since Friday's Daily candle closed just below the 7/8 line, you should enter a sell and target the 6/8 line.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Hi So pretty much then, reverse all the trades from Thursday night !... ab1

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Correct! i'm not taking a short til a full one hour candle closes below the blue trendline on the 1hr chart.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
It was the thread starter who made 17k. I only commented on his ability to use the rule 80/20 quite well.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Hey guys, I hope everyone, including myself, has taken their beating like a man from Friday. Again, we will have to just drive on because we can and will get this back, don't worry. Those were from Wednesday, not Friday.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Hey Mer, Took my beating. Ready to make it bad this week!

--- 帖子 #348 ---
I have reversed two of my trades, The Eur/Usd and the Gbp/Usd, because the gap was very small. I will wait and see if the gaps close back on the rest of the pairs.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
I couldn't close out at daily candle close on Friday due to trading stopping 4 hours earlier than that. I'm looking to close and re-start in a few hours though.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Already got back $1824.00 with 46 pips using 4 lots on Gbp/Usd. Hopefully Eur/Usd will follow along.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
So we should stay away from GBPJPY short because the gap down was pretty big.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
If things stay the same, these will be my new trades: Gbp/Usd Eur/Jpy Gbp/Jpy Eur/Usd i took on the Sunday open is still active. And I might go ahead a take Gbp/Chf as we are bouncing off a 38.2 fib and a 38.2 extension from the upswing. There were too many pairs which have gapped over the Murrey Level which I will pass on because there is a high probability of the gap being filled.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
That's a tough call as there is a big gap, but we are also still breaching a Murrey Level. I have a loss on the last trade, so if it breaches, I will take my normal entry with a double up of 12 lots.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Well, it looks like everything pulled back before the candle opened, so I will hold off on any entries except for my active Eur/Usd.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
I'm starting to think that those of us trading with fixed spread brokers like IBFX need to adjust some of the rules to do this. Trading just opened after closing late Friday afternoon. For starters I don't think we can trade every day like Scott can on the collective. Sunday's daily bar just opened but will close in less than an hour when GMT midnight occurs. So this bar isn't really valid for MM trading. So maybe Monday night makes sense to start and Thursday night you close out for the week. That's 4 days of trading.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
What normally happens once the gap is filled? Is it too unpredictable?

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Well first off kellera6, Forex is unpredictable, period. It doesn't matter if your talking about gaps or fibs or whatever you choose. With regards to gaps, in my experiences, 80-90% of the time the gap will fill at least 90% of the way. The only thing you can do is be patient and watch if the gap fills, and I mean IF , and make your decision at the Sunday close for entering new trades. I'll tell you what, if you look at the charts, every pair tonight that I watch has already filled the gap, pretty cool huh? I actually do gap trading as well, but that's a whole other thread. I gotta admit, stevegee58 makes a valid point that may help some of you. Since I have had a lot of experience trading over the weekend playing off the Sunday candles, it doesn't affect me as much because I know what to look for and how to handle most situations. But to those who would like a more stable trading plan, I would definately suggest following the Monday to Thursday plan. There's less risk from the gaps and less risk of not being able to close out trades late on Fridays. With less trading time you could increase the number of pairs that you watch which would increase the trading opportunities.

Hello thread followers, attached is an excel sheet I made to comfort me. Wanted to share, hopefully my description is self explanatory, though English's not my native language. Feel free to ask questions - after you played with it a while. Also, if you find flaws or bugs, please tell me. This post contains the sheet, the next the explanations. Greetings from Greece Freewheelin Franklin

--- 帖子 #359 ---
the explanations - attached.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Freewheelin, thanks for the trade sheet, I like the visual scan to be able to quickly determine my trades for the day. However am having trouble opening the file, it shows it to be excel but when I download it comes as an unsuported php. Is there another way to attach the file? Thanks for your help.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Excellent job! I will definitely use it.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Lol, I knew I shouldn't have used the word "predicatable" and Forex trading in the same sentence I'll stay away from these gap trades when using this MM system. thanks

--- 帖子 #363 ---
To be honest I'm not sure where the problem is. Did you download the excel sheet?

--- 帖子 #364 ---
I did attempt to download excel file but it does not come up as excel but rather a "php" file, whatever that is. It actually tries to use reader to open. Perhaps it could be sent to bedirectly via email. Let me know.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
try to use this

--- 帖子 #366 ---
ok, here in the uk i'm long on: EU,AU &amp; EJ, anyone concur? Steve.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
It looks like slim pickings tonight with only two trades taken on Eur/Jpy and Gbp/Nzd on my charts .

--- 帖子 #368 ---
I've made a decision to try Stevegee58's advice and limit trading to 4 days from Monday to Thursday. Since this will lower the possible opportunities to me I will be doubling up to 24 pairs and being a little more selective on trades. i've added the new pairs to the first post and will be starting to trade those tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
My EUR/JPY trade has already closed out @ BES with 20 pips for a profit of $1770.13 with 8 lots.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
How about short EURAUD? It breached and closed just below 2/8. Long AUDNZD since it breached the 7/8 line? AUDJPY long since it breached the 4/8 line?

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Hello mer071898 I like your system. I agree with the 4 day trading and being selective on your trades. I have been following this thread for the last week and I decided to join FF and will start demo trading tomorrow with the 24 pairs you suggested. Thanks for your system.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Because I was not watching these on the original 12 pairs. I won't be trading the new pairs I've added til tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Olachico, thanks for the new link, it seemed to work just fine.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Hello all; Just read thread start to finish in one sitting and have a good feel for it. I will "re-trade" this strategy using V-Hands today. It is another simulator I've used extensively. Basically "live demo trade" a year's worth of data in a few hours - real time. Will post results. Although I will test according to original rules... "if bar closes 2/3 into next level.. no trade..." Most trades taken, according to images posted here ignore that rule... (I realize they are with smaller lots... but with risk:reward SO out of wack... I wonder if the few pips are worth the risk) Also, the "gap" in FX doesn't mean what gaps are in other markets. In FX... we see the Sunday "gap" simply because the broker doesn't provide the data. However, my brokers stay open several hours later on Fri and open several hours earlier and the other also provides weekend data and my charts do not show the "gap" on Sunday... because I have the complete data. For those who have the infamous "Sunday bar" (IBFX is one... FXDD does not have it)... what traders usually do is "blend" the stubby Sunday bar with Friday's bar and make decisions based on that - for entries on Daily bars on Sunday night - for Monday trading. I'll post "real-time" back test later tonight... hopefully in time to enter some trades. Cheers

--- 帖子 #375 ---
My EUR/USD trade has closed out @ Target with 55 pips for a profit of $8848.00 -$1.62 in swap with 16 lots. We will get those losses back slowly but surely, trust me. My GBP/NZD is still active.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
If you read post #4 again, I never said you couldn't take the trade, just use lower lots and be cautious. What I said was: "This is not to say you can't make money on these, just be cautious and use common sense. I always use a lower Breakeven Point and Shift on these."

--- 帖子 #377 ---
I understand.. thank you... I have 2 years worth backtested in "real" conditions and it's.. ummm... looking gooooood . I actually want to go back 5 years. Just to make sure it covers all types of market cycles/conditions. Will post later.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
It's show time, folks! I'm still using my old list and haven't added any of Scott's new ones yet. My broker's daily bar closes at midnight GMT in a few minutes.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Open Trades GBP/NZD -174 pips Closed Trades EUR/USD +79 pips Trades of 4 November 2009 I trade only pairs that fulfill the main rules. So if a candle breaches one Murray Level with his real body and another Murray Level with his wick, I personally don't trade it.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
I'm still paper trading this so forgive me but how did you guys make a profit with EURUSD lastnight? From what I can see, it didn't make it to BE. Also isn't AUDUSD a sell tonight or you passed because it almost breached 2 levels lastnight? thanks

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Hi kellera6, I traded EUR/USD on 2009.10.28 when it breached 5/8 mm level down. I didn't trade AUD/USD because my candle opened just above the 6/8 level tonight. Anyway even if it opened below it I wouldn't have traded it because yesterday's candle(2009.11.03) already touched the 5/8 level (as a support). But this is just a feeling, not a rule of mer071898

--- 帖子 #382 ---
That explains your EURUSD profit on a sell. Nice one! Some people here have been closing a trade like that if the trade goes the opposite way and closes beyond the breached level where they entered. I think what you did worked because it's stuck in a range but probably would have turned into a bigger loss if it started a new trend. Interesting on your AUDUSD candle opening above the 6/8 when mine opened below it. Thanks for the scoop!

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Sorry about the late post but here is what I've taken tonight: AUD/USD-Short- TP-116, SL-130, BE-58, BES-29, and TS-15, 2 lots NZD/USD-Long- TP-104, SL-140, BE-52, BES-26, and TS-13, 2 lots CAD/JPY-Long- TP-46, SL-110, BE-23, BES-12, and TS-6, 4 lots CHF/JPY-Short- TP-46, SL-114, BE-23, BES-12, and TS-6, 2 lots USD/CHF-Long- TP-110, SL-136, BE-55, BES-28, and TS-14, 4 lots USD/CAD-Short- TP-44, SL-204, BE-22, BES-11, and TS-6, 8 lots EUR/CAD-Short- TP-68, SL-182, BE-34, BES-17, and TS-9, 2 lots GBP/CAD-Short- TP-156, SL-340, BE-78, BES-39, and TS-20, 8 lots AUD/CAD-Short- TP-100, SL-146, BE-50, BES-25, and TS-13, 4 lots EUR/NZD-Short- TP-124, SL-370, BE-62, BES-31, and TS-16, 8 lots AUD/NZD-Short- TP-58, SL-190, BE-29, BES-15, and TS-8, 8 lots ***UPDATE*** My AUD/USD trade has already closed out @ BES with 29 pips for a profit of $580.00 with 2 lots. My CHF/JPY trade has already closed out with 18 pips (BES-12 pips + TS-6 pips x1) for a profit of $399.33 with 2 lots. I still have 9 active trades from today plus 1 from still going from yesterday (GBP/NZD).

--- 帖子 #384 ---
I thought I'd join in with the pip festivities. Here are my live trades (although using only micros until my backtest is done). My entries are all using limit orders. Daily bars have enough of a range to retrace a bit and trigger. Make for lower risk and greater gain. Just my way of entering... same concept though. 7 orders. 4 triggered so far and all 4 positive. AUD/USD - Long (.9012) - SL (-122) TP (138) (This pair has been riding the 50% Fib for 4 days now.. tried to break yesterday and failed miserably... On my broker I have a close above MM level + Fib support... hence my long) NZD/USD - Long (.7190) - SL (-125) TP (130) EUR/JPY - Long (132.75) - SL (-160) TP (160) EUR/AUD - Short (1.6345) - SL (-145) TP (105) Pending entries: GBP/USD - Long EUR/GBP - Short AUD/CAD - Short

--- 帖子 #385 ---
I am a little miffed why my AUD/NZD didn't close out as the price hit the target Murrey Level and even went past a little. Same thing on AUD/CAD, it should have moved to BES of 25 pips, but didn't. Anyone else have this issue?

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Quite confusing to try to trade this method along with you. There are multiple pairs you have listed such as nzdusd, eurnzd, usdcad and some others that are completely opposite of what I see on my onecorp demo with freshly loaded template. That's a pretty frustrating aspect of this, how even on the same broker we can't seem to get the MM levels showing the same. Wish there was a way around this issue.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Maybe the spread was too large at that moment.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Those pairs usually have high spreads about 9-10 pips that is why I don't trade them.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
did you meant aud/usd long?

--- 帖子 #390 ---
***UPDATE*** My USD/CAD trade has closed with 29 pips (BES-11 pips + TS-6 pips x3) for a profit of $2180.72 with 8 lots. My CAD/JPY trade has closed out @ Target with 47 pips for a profit of $2063.88 with 4 lots. 9 trades are still active. tazmaan, I've mentioned it numerous times, you're confused because you are using a different broker than I am and you are receiving different data. It gets frustrating trying to get people to understand that every broker's data is different! I can only give you the trades I take that I see on my broker . That's why I suggest you use the same demo as I do so you will see what I see. I can't make it any more plain and simple as that, sorry. fed and fewhills, The Collective FX spreads on AUD/NZD and AUD/CAD are never more than 5-7 pips on my platform, even during low liquidity (because I've checked). Even if it was a big spread increase, the AUD/NZD still should have moved the stop to BES at least. No, it was a short, look at the stats page. I took a short trade because my candle closed below the Murrey Level.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Here's what my AUDUSD chart looks like: Attached Image (click to enlarge) As you can see, the difference in broker feed caused a slightly different calculation in MM lines, where MER071898 has a close BELOW the MM level and I have a close ABOVE the level... causing my entry long. Whereas he went short. Learn the concept of this method and simply apply it to your charts . Otherwise... as stated... you will need to download the same platform as him and then you can follow along. MM levels are simply mathematical calculations based on data provided by your broker . Since a new daily bar forms at several different times (depending on the broker).. i.e. GMT, GMT+1, GMT+2, GMT+3, etc... not everyone in the world has the same Daily bar, causing MM levels to be calculated differently. However, the bars DO form during slow trading periods, making the bars close.. but not identical. This is why intraday traders rely on HOURLY bar closes, since everyone in the world will then see the same data. Top of the hour is the same in all parts of the world. MER... May I suggest that you edit the first post in big, capital, bold letters stating that "if you want to follow along and see the same charts as me... you will need to download the demo account from X broker". BTW... That AUDUSD trade - in my account - is now at B/E and about +60. MER went short and already took his profit. Beauty of Daily bars. Has room to profit in both directions

--- 帖子 #392 ---
this happened to me also, it was caused by a sudden spike down &amp; there was no time for the EA to react before the price had gone back up again. Steve.

Sorry...found it....lol I've just seen your mt4live stats and they are right. You have just made some mistakes posting your trades here.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Hey Scott, I have one critique of this system that maybe you can address. I've always been a "fixed fractional bet" kinda guy but the way trades are sized in this system doesn't fit with this. As part of my trading plan, I have a fixed percentage of my account I'm willing to risk per trade. Therefore, when I enter a trade, I look at my entry price and stop (I always have a hard stop). Based on the difference between the entry and stop I size my position so that if the stop is hit, my loss is my pre-defined max risk. As we've seen, the position sizing strategy used in this thread can result in significant drawdowns when things don't go right. This is because the MM lines (which are used to determine stops and targets) can be wider or narrower depending on the currency pair's volatility. Yet we put on lot sizes that completely ignore how far away the stop is. In order to even out the risk, I'd propose sizing according to the (entry-stop)/max risk formula. This way every loss is the same amount, as opposed to having some trades be potentially large losses and some small. In addition, we can still have the original idea of "large-medium-small" sizes depending on the unique rules of this approach (i.e. which MM line is the target, did the daily bar breach 2 MM lines or just 1). The way I'd trade it is to define "large" as my max loss size and set "medium" and "small" as fractions of this - maybe 1/2 and 1/4. You gave the impression that this system is working for you as-is and that's fine. What I'm suggesting is a way to smooth out the equity curve and control the drawdowns better.

Scott, What experiences have you had with your boutique broker and how long have you been with them? Thanks

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Can you imagine trying to develop this to fit each and every trader's needs? If you accomplished that.. I would immediately endorse you as the forum genius.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Hey MER; I'm starting to run into this in my backtest and wanted to see what your experience has been... before I proceed. Attached Image If you get a close like this, where price stops and reverses without closing below a level... would you go long there? Or do you want a bar closing below... then closing back above (i.e. bar startling the level like it does 4 bars to the left in that image). Thanks.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
I'm not sure what your point is. What I proposed (fixed fractional betting) is an old concept. It prevents wild swings in your equity curve; i.e. no single trade can produce a big drawdown. You have to understand that when you enter a 1 lot trade with the stop 50 pips away and another 1 lot trade with the stop 200 pips away, your risk isn't balanced. Your 200 pip stops *will* be hit, so why not take the same risk with both trades and size them differently?

--- 帖子 #404 ---
That is how I have been trading for a while now...each trade I take is risking between 1% and 5% of my account, depending on how risky I think the trade is. Based on my stoploss value, I adjust my lot size accordingly. That way it would take a big string of losses to wipe my account out. Mer isn't doing things that differently with regard to how he trades this system. Where I would move from 1% to 3% on a trade, he moves up from 4 lots to 8 lots (or something similar). Remember, he has already stated that he is trading with more risk than usual in the demo account.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
I must have read your post too fast and misunderstood. I though you were trying to curvefit a money management style to fit all traders of the method... Anyway... I do the same thing. I made a spreadsheet... my risk is now set to 2% per trade and 6% max exposure at a time. Then put in the stop size and let that tell me how many lots to trade with. It's all good

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Scott, what is the reason for going 4 lots on EUR/CAD tonight ? it has crossed the 5/8 line, doesn't that mean it should be higher lots or have I got it wrong? thanks, Steve.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Posted on the first page of the thread in post #6: "If your profit target is the 4/8, 2/8, 6/8 0/8, or 8/8 = Use smaller lots as price will have more support and Resistance around these points and are more prone to reversals."

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Hi, mer071898! Can you add indicator CandleDivergence in archive from first post or put it just here ? And say please what this indy do ?

--- 帖子 #409 ---
No offense ... but this high volatility in this strategy is not good ... you go up to 232k and then all the way down to ~130k ... thats not very consistent and imagine this losing phase goes on ... you would come to a point where your account will blow up ... even if its a demo it reflects the fluctuation that is happening ... anyways i wish you good luck in trading and making alot of pips and money but please make it with consistency ... or you will lose it again after a while ... good luck and many pips to you all...

--- 帖子 #410 ---
I'm not normally one to bash or badmouth anyone, but Boutique, how in the world does someone who just signed up on the site, and hasn't even been on here for a full day by the way, come in here and badmouth this strategy? I'll tell you what, when you have accumulated more than 1 post and a little more experience on this forum, come back and voice your opinion and I might listen a little more intently. This is obviously a demo in which we are covering the basics of the strategy only. Once everyone can grasp the concept, then they can apply their own twist to strategy, that is the whole premise of demo trading. Take fed for example, he has utilized this strategy to work on the 1 hour using it in his own way that works for him. stevegee58 uses a totally different MM strategy that he employs (MM= M oney M anagement since your obviously a newb). I trade this live with the addition of looking for price action setups, reversal patterns, and Fibonacci retracements for filters. In the beginning, I never said this strategy was perfect by any means and someone who has been on this forum for a while would know this. But look at the facts, I have traded this with a high risk lot sizing, I have taken virtually every trade based on the entry criteria (even having -$27K worth of losses closed prematurely due to lack of margin available), all this on top of doing my live trading and I'm still up over 30% for the month on the demo, figure that one out. Most real traders would kill to get 5-10% a month! We have a strategy with no filters and simple entry and exit strategy that would be on pace to make 360+% per year, hmmm, must be bad. This just tells us the basic strategy can and will work and lets us imagine the possibilities of this strategy with the right filters and the personal touch of each individual trader. So, all I can say to those who are following along and see the graph above is read the thread fully , test out the way you want to try it with whatever filters or MM you choose, then make your own conclusions. Otherwise, get off the thread and move on if you don't like what you see, plain and simple.

Don't sweat it

I agree with you bud, you don't know how much I can thank you just becuse you have introduced MM levels here in this forum. I am loving it so far. I mean it is not necessary to trade exactly like you, what ever works I will implement. At the end it still works.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
on 11/3 I sold GBPCAD at 1.7511 and soon after entering the trade, it breached the entry level of 4/8. It's currently stalled between the 4/8 and 5/8 lines. It seems like some of you hang onto the trade until you either get stopped out or hit the profit target. Normally I just take the loss and move on, but I'm wondering from the back testing done here what is the better decision? thanks

--- 帖子 #416 ---
thanks for all the supportive comments everyone, it is truly appreciated. To touch base on a couple of posts: It has really nothing to do with the strategy, but I will post it for you. A divergent candle by the indicator's definition is a candle with a lower low than the previous 5 candles but with a change in color. If you look in the pic it will visually explain it. kellera6, it's funny you posted this after Pix asked about the Candle Divergence indicator. What I was going to try in the next few weeks is to place trades until they hit profit or stop out but still utilize the Stealth EA on all trades. The only difference is the candle divergence indicator will be used to close a trade early if it presents itself. I will be going over some charts on my trading simulator over the next week to see how this performs as compared to the original strategy. I could only think that my server had issues at that time or it might have actually been a spread issue, don't know for sure.

Just for kicks and giggles today I ran a manual backtest using my trading simulator on the GBP/JPY from the first of May 2009 til today. All I did was once a Murrey Level was breached, I place the Stoploss and Target at the usual places (again I personally take off a few pips on the Target and add a few pips to the Stoploss) and just let the trade run until it stopped out or hit Target. I did not take any trades which breached past the 0/8 or 8/8, only if the candle came back through it in the opposite direction. If I incurred any loss, I doubled up on the lot size and continued trading at that size until I was within $100 of the loss or recouped the loss completely. After recouping the loss, I went back to the original lot size (which in this case was a starting lot size of 1 lot on a $100K account). In the 6 months of this particular test we made $36,576.33 on 25 trades. I never had to double up over 2 lots the whole time which was pretty cool. I will try and test it out on a few more pairs over the weekend to make sure the consistency is the same across more than one pair. Also keep in mind that this is not including any swap amounts as the simulator does not calculate that in. Here are the results

Wow that looks good. It will be very interesting to see other pairs. Thanks

Hi Fed, I have read the whole tread and are interested in your system. Is it possible for you to private msg me your system since you do not want to discuss it in this tread. Kelvin

--- 帖子 #420 ---
The strategy and the backtest are very interesting. I try to put a fast slope (20.3) like a filter. less movement but in the direction of the trend, always with semi marginale system. Result of backtest with slope indicator (20.3) Initial deposit 100000 Total net profit 42822.9 Gross profit 51815.25 Gross loss -8992.35 Profit factor 5.76 Expected payoff 1423.05 Absolute drawdown 1034.12 Maximal drawdown 12166.11 (10.32%) Relative drawdown 10.32% (12166.11) Total trades 18 Short positions (won %) 11 (81.82%) Long positions (won %) 14 (71.43%) Profit trades (% of total) 16 (89.00%) Loss trades (% of total) 2 (11.00%) Largest profit trade 6239.46 loss trade -4907.83 Average profit trade 3238.45 loss trade -4496.18

I try to filter the result of the murrey math stat live with the slope (20.3). I add the excel file

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Tried another big pair in Gbp/Chf. This one made $22,390.04 in 21 trades with one open trade which is at -$752.64. The only thing I did differently was increase the lot size @ .1 lots for every $10K. Here are the results

--- 帖子 #423 ---
I only started to demo this system on Oct. 25th and I'm being selective not to enter any trades that have breached and gone beyond 1/2 way plus no trades with SL over 300 pips. With these guidelines, leaving the trade open till it stops out or hits the target seems to be much more profitable. 526 pips vs well over 800 pips. I don't have the final count of pips yet because some trades are still active. I'll keep trading it this way to see how it does.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Very well put.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
is it possible to use stealth ea with the tester or i will be only waiting for hard SL or the TP to be hit ?

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Unfortunately the EA does not work in the trading simulator nor does it let me put in more than one trade at a time, which stinks, but you work with what you have. I'm going to reset my demo account and start trading with a hard stoploss and target and we'll see how that works out.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
why would you do that when youre getting some very good results with the method that you posted? i just started looking into that system but considering the r;r ratio which is often very poor, the trailing ea would be of great use right or no ?

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Hello Feline207, I believe Mer is only making this system lesser drawdown. I think it is a very wise decision. Yes this system is really promising and making it better profit wise is smart.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Again, that is the nice thing about demoing a new system, you can test it out in numerous variations to find what works best. Yes, the original strategy works great, but there were numerous times where the trades were closed out at the BES where if I were to let them run their course, they would've closed at their target. I'm just going to see if there is any benefit to trading it this way, but please use the trail step if you so desire.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
This is how I will enter the trades on the new strategy. Using the same rules as the original strategy, we will open a trade on the breach of the Murrey Level. A set Target and stoploss will be put into the Stealth EA with the BE set to the same value as the Target, since it will not be utilized, and the TrailStep set to false. The same rules apply to the 0/8 and 8/8 and beyond where we will not take trades below these points, only if the prices breaches back through the level in the opposite direction. Since I have added more pairs to the mix, I will be reducing my lot size to .1 lots per trade and increasing it by .01 lots for every $10K in profit added to the account. If a trade incurs a loss, we will still double up on the lots until we recoup our loss we just took. I also will be cautious trading any pair whose Average Daily Range is greater than the distance between Murrey Levels. This can filter out a few trades that may not as desirable as we'd want, but is just an option. This is another option as well, you could also limit your trades to pairs that will produce positive swap for that particular trade, but that is up to the trader. We should be looking at 5-8 trades per pair, per month.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
have you considered the increasing of bets not by lot size but by risk percentage? Example: First trade 0.5 % Next 1.0 % Next 1.5 % This could smoothen the equity curve and the drawdowns with it.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
ok now i understand you. the system seems great and i am running it on a demo but i have another friendly question to ask. i enjoy applying martingale to systems but here in our case the tp,sl and of course the point at which we close a bad trade are not consstant values and the pips that we could win are often less than the pips that we could potentially lose. so there is a possibility of a situation in which the next order with lot multiplier of 2 wouldnt be able to recoup all of the losses. i may be wrong cause i just got out of bed and my brain is still sleeping so please correct me

--- 帖子 #433 ---
and what is the maximum number of consecutive losses(bad trades) that you have experienced with this type of trading ? i got 4 consecutive bad trades on eurusd ( for the 3rd one i am not very sure because there was some problem with the simulator) . have you ever experienced more than 4 in a row? another thing - which pairs do you consider to be the best to trade with the system, because all 23 pairs are too much for me and i want to pick just 3 or 4 , max 5 pairs to trade..

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Good idea and I'm sure any solid MM will work, but with watching 24 pairs and having to double up on losses, this will be the simplest way so everyone could follow. Having to calculate the lots on a percentage of the account would just take up more time. We don't just double up for one trade after the loss, we let it stay at that lot size until that loss is fully recouped. If that takes 2 or 3 trades to accomplish the task, then that is what we do. Of the pairs I have experienced in testing, I've ran into 5 losses once and 4 losses a couple of times. I think the best pairs are the ones with the highest Average Daily range like GBP/JPY, GBP/CHF, GBP/NZD, GBP/CAD, and maybe a few others. Keep in mind that with the second strategy you will not have as many trades so it would be best to try and watch as many pairs as you can comfortably handle.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
well that means that you should keep additional track on your exact current state (profit/loss) for each pair, because you will be trading more than 20 different currency pairs and you may be losing on one or two pairs and still make profit , because of others. and what happens if you have losses on different pairs and you have doubled the lots on many of them or even doubled again after that ? it could result in a very large ammount of open orders . am i right or wrong here ? maybe i have misunderstood something. lets assume that you trade 20-something pairs and you take a 1.0 lot trade with a 200 pip loss on one of them. then you double to 2.0 lots and take additional loss 150 pips (around 5000$ loss total). then you double again to 4 lots and trade for a 100 pips profit which would be like 4000$ profit (you are still at minus 1000 from the previous trades on that pair) so you enter again at 4.0 to make some more profit but then you lose again 150 pips (6000$ / 7000$ in total until now) then you should double again at 8 lots and look to compensate the losses ? am i getting it right because i seriously doubt so, i am sorry if i have misunderstood the concept. i just cannot imagine how one could trade more than 20 pairs this way with normal lot sizes. im just curious how exactly do you manage the whole float of money with the many different running orders. thanks

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Well, first off, I'm only starting with .1 lots per trade now, not 1 full lot. And the reason for that is exactly what you described, to be more mindful of numerous trades and the possibilities of having to double up on the losses with multiple trades and to control the margin more efficiently. And yes, I double up on a loss if I haven't recouped the loss completely because very rarely will you run into a situation where you will need to go 4 or 5 double ups. Even doubling up 5 times starting with .1 lots is only 1.6 lots (.1, .2, .4, .8, 1.6), and on a $100K account, that is pretty insignificant.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
ok you answered my questions. what you said of course means that one will need a big account to trade this system live thank you very much and i am happy with the system so i am testing it in 2 different ways right now. so in a conclusion - can this system be profitable without applyin some martinagle to it ?

--- 帖子 #438 ---
can it be use in the lower time frame like 1 hour .

--- 帖子 #439 ---
You don't have to have a really huge account to trade this. It's all depends on how many pairs you want to trade and the risk you want to accept. It's always beneficial to have a decent account size so the risk is less per trade, but it's not a requirement. You can be profitable without any martingale approach, it just may take a little longer to build the account. Remember you don't have to double up on a loss, you could always go from 1 lot to 1.1 lots or say .5 lots to .7 lots. Just move it up in small increments until you make up your loss then go back to your original lot size. What I do is not set in stone so experiment what works best for you. Yes, it can be used in any time frame, but you have to be careful in the lower timeframes due to heavier whipsaw action and news spikes. Check with fed, I believe he has incorporated this into a 1 hour strategy.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
1hr strategy I am still testing. this is my 2nd week with it, it is too early for me to commit something. I will open a thread when I am confi with it. I am having a heck of a time trading MM lines. Last week it was my first week and I made close to 2000 pips. This week I am up about 300 pips, but I am holding the trades longer so I still have some more pips coming in to my account. MM lines works not only with trending market but also ranging markets. I am also having high wining % about more then 90%. I hope it continues.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
im having a problem with stealth 2. some of the trades go in my direction, i havent watched them for like 10 hours and when i take a look they are between 2 murrey lines and penetrated the one that i needed couple of hours earlier, but the EA didnt close the trade although it went lets say 10-20 or even more pips past the profit target. why dont we just use the built-in tp of MT4 and use the ea only for other functions like trailing?

--- 帖子 #442 ---
I told everyone numerous times that you can use whatever you'd like, but sometimes it doesn't matter if you have spreads being increased or server issues. Have you double checked the settings to make sure they're correct? If so then use MT4's TP and trailing functions and see if it works.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Just a small update on the new trading that I started. I have had 7 trades (using .1 lots each) closed for a total profit of $689.37. I still have 7 open trades going on and will be adding a few more trades tonight at the new candle. There have been no losses as of yet so all new trades will remain at .1 lots

--- 帖子 #444 ---
I have now entered 10 more trades tonight for a total of 17 open trades. I will update if any close before bed, otherwise I will update tomorrow morning.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Freewheelin, there seems to be a discrepancy between the line values on the template from this thread to the values of the lines on the indicator that you included in your post no 334. If you vertically tile the same up to date daily chart, place the thread template on one and the post 334 indicator on the other you will see what I mean. On one chart that I looked at there was a difference of 40 pips at the +2/8 level. That makes it a bit difficult to do any visual backtesting.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
I'm sure Freewheelin will chime in, but you can't compare two totally different indicators and expect to see the same thing. Besides, Freewheelin could be using a totally different broker, which makes a big difference regarding data feeds.

I started trading this system live on my Oanda acct last week. I have made 14.51% since so far this month. I'm only using mirco lots, but I get to test this system live. I currently have 8 trades going right now. I'm only looking for 50 pips profit so far (I might change this to tp at Murray line later) and the trades must be above or below my 10 sma h/l. Thanks Mer, i'm enjoying your system.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
To Mer. Sorry mate, you missed my point. I openned two charts on the same platform so both of them were identical in every respect. I then applied the two indicators which, as Murrey Math is a set formula and in this case is working on the same data the lines should be of identical value. Or at least that is what I assume.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
With a bit of luck there should be a screen shot of two charts. The values of some of the different lines are as follows: Left Chart Right Chart +2/8 140.46 140.63 8/8 137.26 137.50 5/8 132.62 132.81 4/8 127.90 128.13

--- 帖子 #455 ---
No, I fully understand your point, but what I'm trying to get across is that the computational logic of each indicator that you try can differ and that's why you won't see the same information. It has nothing to do with the Murrey Math fundamentals that they're based around. One indicator may be using 64 periods to make its calculations, the other may use 32 or even 128, who knows. With all the different ways that a coder can tweak an indicator, it's possible you could have 10 different Murrey Math indicators, and they could show completely different results, no matter if they're on the same platform or not.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Right Mer thanks for that. That explains one thing but it raises another question. You are using the results of A's formula, I am using B's and Tom, Dick and Harry are using C,D and E's. We are all using the same broker and the same charts and therefore the same data but we all will have different lines on our charts. So who has the correct ones? I can understand that if I am using different data to you and we are both using the same formula we will get different results. That makes sense. My lines are drawn where they should be according to the data that I have. But if we all have the same data and different lines I just don't get it. The market doesn't look at my chart and say "I will have to go another 55 pips to get to Bob's next line" and then take a peek at your chart and say "Oh, Oh that won't work I have to go to 65 to get Mer in." You have shown that you have the runs on the board so for you it must work and therefore if I trade using the template you have provided it should work for me. But it could be an abject failure for someone else who through no fault of their own is using the wrong person's formula.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
dear mer071898 , thanks a lot for sharing your tecnique, I had uploaded the indicator (murrey_Math_line_X_eng.mq4) and a could see a diferece in murrey levels wen you upload the plain.tpl why levels are not the same?

--- 帖子 #458 ---
If you are having different lines using the same broker, then something is wrong with your settings, otherwise it should be exactly the same. All I can say is that if you are using a different broker, all you can do is trade with the data provided. The concept and principle is still the same, but you will have to trade off whatever the formula is calculating using whatever data is provided. I don't know what else to tell you. I really shouldn't have to answer this as it's been covered already but I will. If you are seeing different results from what I have, your are either using a different broker with different data, or your MPeriod on the indicator is not set to 1440. People, please read through the thread before asking really simple questions that could already have been answered before .

Greetings Mer, the weekend is over so back to work again. We don’t seem to be getting our thoughts across to one another clearly. I wrote to say that I had in effect superimposed Murrey Math indicators on the same chart (post 453 with chart attached to post 454) and had lines of different value. Your reply was - “ With all the different ways that a coder can tweak an indicator, it's possible you could have 10 different Murrey Math indicators, and they could show completely different results, no matter if they're on the same platform or not.” I wrote to say that to me that seemed a bit odd and added the following – “You are using the results of A's formula, I am using B's and Tom, Dick and Harry are using C,D and E's. We are all using the same broker and the same charts and therefore the same data but we all will have different lines on our charts.” Your answer was - Post 458 “If you are having different lines using the same broker, then something is wrong with your settings, otherwise it should be exactly the same.” My reading of all that is that you are telling me I can have lines of different value on exactly the same chart from the same broker and then that I can’t

--- 帖子 #462 ---
The problem is you are comparing apples and oranges. In post #454, you are trying to compare two different indicators and expecting the same results. What I'm saying is if you are on the exact same platform and using the exact same indicator I use, you should see exactly what I see. If you use a different broker with the same Murrey Math indicator I use or a different Murrey Math Indicator on the same broker I use, you can and probably will see different results. What I would like to see you do is put the Murrey Indicator from the zip file in the first post on a demo from the Collective FX and post a pic of any chart and then I'll post up the same chart and we'll see how they compare. This way you'll understand that to see what I'm trading and what setups I take, you'll need to have the same tools.

I was going to open my own thread with the 1 hour but seeing what mer is going throught with the bull crap, I think I will pass....

--- 帖子 #464 ---
fed, don't let anything that goes on here distract or discourage you from posting your system, especially if it's a profitable one. One of the inevitable things you'll always have to deal with in these forums are repeat questions, ignorant responses, bad attitudes, and people wanting to change everything on you. I don't mind helping everyone up to a point, but I do have limits. All I'm asking people to do is research before asking all sorts of basic questions that have been answered already. Then, if you still having issues, will figure out the issues.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
Hi, I would just like to say thank you to Mer for putting his systems out here for us to look at. Ever since I found the MML indicator I had looked for a way to trade it. He has done all the hard work for me. Fed please post your own thread with your 1 hour system. I am very curious to see it also. I have been waiting patiently I have been looking for a way to trade the MML on a shorter time frame. I think an issue Mer is having is one most thread starters have. People want it all. They want a system where they do not have to think that makes them lots of money. Unfortunately every system has some part of it that requires some form of discretion from the trader, even if it is subconscious from trading experience. Once again I want to say thanks to Mer this system and the London Progressive are both outstanding, and Fed please go forward with posting your method on your thread.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Fed, don't let such things discourage you. I have been following your 2-5 GMT breakout system, and I would love to hear about your new 1hr system.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
ok ok, I will post it, I like helping people anyway, but I need some more time, so far so good for the last 2 weeks I have made 3600 pips, this week it is a bad start with few loses but I did cought up with buy gbp/usd and it is still early of the week, I have time to make some pips. The most I like about this strategy is that I don't take more than 1-2 trades per pair a week and plus even I am working full time, and I am still able to trade with this strategy. Right now I am trying to overcome the situation best deal with where the lines will be recalcualted depends on the price movement on that particular pair. I noticed that the lines will not change every day, for the last 2 weeks MM lines changed couple of times on only few pairs which is great that means the lines will remain the same for a long time. Anyway probably another few weeks with great results the I will feel more confi to take some more risk as I am trading with smaller lots right now and then I can have something to present to you guys here.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
That is great Fed. Have you signed up for fxbook or any other service so we could keep track of your trades ?

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Just wanted to let everyone know that I am reverting back to the original strategy and cutting down to 7 pairs. I be changing back to MT4Stats.com as well as I wasn't too impressed with MyFxBook.com and will will make the changes in post #1. I am also going to try a lot sequence that was suggested by one of the traders I know who uses a lot of martingale techniques and we'll see how that works out.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
So with your testing, you've seen that the original method of closing out a bad trade if it reverses and closes beyond the original breached murrey level, is more profitable? That along with the combination of the BE take profit? I know this past 1.5 weeks, my demo account has been taking some larger losses but it's too soon for me to tell how long it's going to take to recoup those losses. As always, thanks for the feedback and continuing to try and improve this system!

--- 帖子 #471 ---
I might actually try mixing the two strategies together where I still use the Stealth V.2 from the first strategy but let the trade run until is closes out in profit or loss (instead of closing the trade and opening a new one on a reversal) from strategy 2. This way we will get profit quicker, but not be stuck in that rut of putting in trade after trade when the candle teeters on the Murrey Lines for several days in a row. I will be doing some deep thought over the weekend on using the two mixed together.

--- 帖子 #472 ---

You should give credit to someone who is in the game with the least amount of time. The longer you play a game with negative expectancy the greater the chance of you giving all your money away. It's better to win a little and walk away than to get drunk on the thought of a consistant winning strat and forfeit your hard earned money.

Here is a useful tidbit for you guys I just found, might help to filter out or scale down some trades which have a higher probability of reversal: If Price Moves By: The probability of reversal is: (1 x mMMI) + (4 x bMMI) 50% (2 x mMMI) 75% (3 x mMMI) 85% (4 x mMMI) 90% (5 x mMMI) 95%

Your welcome and I'm still plugging away. The end of the year trading was a little slow as usual but hopefully good things will come about in 2010. I've regressed back to the original strategy and have been limiting myself to taking more and more trades around the more overbought an oversold areas to try to take advantage of higher probability trades. I'm working on a new EA project at the moment designed for Institutional traders and larger investors which is taking up a lot of my time. I've doubled the font size for you (from 5pt. to 10 pt.). I hope that helps but if you want to change it yourself, look at the pic I've attached.

I don't know what indicator your looking at, but the +2/8 and -2/8 have always been there. I know if you use a black background it won't show up by default because the level color is black and you'll need to change the color in the parameters.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
for MML_Multi_Option indicator posted above, what is the difference between 'P' and 'MMPeriod' parameters?

--- 帖子 #503 ---
I was trying to look at similar strategy but at lower time frame. I was watching One Hr time frame of EURUSD pair during both London and NY time that is from 8:00 till 22:00 GMT. My observations are as follows: (1) Ignore first candle of 8:00. (2) When price BREACHES any Murrey Levels, get in with the same direction and target will be the next Murrey Level. (3) If the case is repeated again when price breaches another Murrey Level, get in with the same direction, however, target here will be mid line but not the next Murrey Level since I believe pair is loosing momentum even though I see some case where pair made it to the next Murrey Level. It is in principle similar to original daily time frame but now customized to 1 Hr time frame. It needs definitely further testing. http://www.m5zn.com/uploads/2010/8/1...qg9fib5fnv.gif

Very interesting. Seems like your mid-line strategy is working(at least on this example). The obvious benefit is a higher trade-frequency, which is OK, providing that the results are the same, or better, than the original strategy. I've been doing well with my D1 charts, but I think I will start looking at H1 and see if your modification proves profitable. Thanks for the input. Rob

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Thanks for dropping by. Nice to see somebody testing as well with different broker. I am using FXCM Demo, what about you?

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Hey mostashar15, good to hear from you. I've been running the MM strategy for a couple of weeks. I just recently went live and all of my trades have been winners(I'm sure that will change soon enough). I'm using IBFX and have had no issues, whatsoever. I'm running 16 charts on D1 and only pick trades that are in overshoot territory. Let's keep this thread alive. Rob

Usd/Jpy, when mkt. reopens. TP 93.75

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Gbp/Usd. TP 1.4648

--- 帖子 #509 ---
co0o0o0o0l Nice to hear somebody is going live with this strategy and making money out of it. Are you gonna post your new trades in here? Wish you all the pips

--- 帖子 #510 ---
I will try sending a screen grab tomorrow of the three winners, and hopefully some good potential setups. I've been using Stealth v2 to manage the trades. Don't know, yet, if it's the best approach, but I'm going to stay with it for the time being. Rob

--- 帖子 #511 ---
On H4, I don't see an entry, yet. If it did meet the requirement of straddling the MM line, I see TP of 86.71(not 93.75)at the 6/8 MM line. Rob

--- 帖子 #512 ---
On H4, with price between 0/8 and -1/8, I see a long trade setting up, not a short. Rob

--- 帖子 #513 ---
For me, if you look @ daily chart of USDJPY, you will see that candle of 12, Aug. 2010, has breached up -1/8 level which is an entry signal as per original strategy. However, USDJPY is on a downtrend and you should be careful when riding against the trend. I would put my TP as 86.719 which is the mid-way to 0/8 Murrey level.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
I see a chance coming on EURUSD 1Hr time frame. If the current 9:00 candle closes below 3/8 (1.27869), then this is a SHORT entry signal. TP = 2/8 (1.27563) and SL = 4/8 (1.28174) http://www.m5zn.com/uploads/2010/8/1...sh2cv9jckl.gif

--- 帖子 #515 ---
EURUSD is not making any entry signals even though it is so volatile. Now, it looks it is approaching 4/8 line, we will wait for the close of next hours. Ohh this is very hard 30 pips to get http://www.m5zn.com/uploads/2010/8/1...h13tsi1jx8.gif

--- 帖子 #516 ---
I have D1 MM lines on H4 chart. I use Heiken Ashi candles to show trend strength/weakness. I do not enter until I see trend weakening. I am short G/U. U/J entry stop, just above H of 8/13, has not been hit yet. EDIT: I will be targeting 2/8, and 6/8 levels rather than 4/8.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Short@1.5575...

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Why are you putting a D1 grid on a H4 chart?

--- 帖子 #519 ---
I think it helps me see the market turns better. Want to see 2 consecutive H4 candles reverse before making initial entry. Have been short G/U since 8/4@1.5949. S/L just above +2/8 level. I don't hold over weekends. Re-enter when mkt. opens new week.

--- 帖子 #520 ---
what has been your success rate so far ?

--- 帖子 #521 ---
This here is what murrey levels do over time. Its a random timespan of the 15 minute chart. I am looking to automate a murrey strategy. If you have any advice let me know

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Just came across this thread. Look quite interesting. Would want to read thru it completely over the weekend and then try the indi. I'll definitely report back here

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Can you share that Indicator? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Does anyone know of a way to manually back test the Murrey Math Indicator in MT4? Since it's based on the current market action, is there a way to set it to focus on the past? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
is this thread still active, not much action lately? anyone have any trade actual performance, if so please post copy of results with indis used..will this work with 5 digit broker?? MoStAsHar15 thread for 4hr on hold for 5 digit broker trading, some are making money, others losing!!!

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Hi hope it's still alive as I started with this system yesterday I took the following trades last night (all with 1 lot as I do not understand yet the criteria to increase the lots): GBPCAD: Close already with 100 pips. GBPJPY: Close already with 32 pips. GBPCHF: Already in a "free trade". I did not take GBPAUD and GBPUSD as both were below MM -1/8. Let's try to keep this thread alive.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Lets keep it going...my take on this. Check out my posts here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...59471&amp;page=144

Hi mates. Like this method! I am trying to use it on H1 with H4 MM lines. I found this setting working well some time ago. First trade with this strategy +44pips but will see after some 20 trades how I can handle this system. See ya soon. P.

Great system Mer, I love Murray Math and PA personally. Have you been trading this system recently? Happy Trading!

--- 帖子 #536 ---
I'm actually referring to the gentleman who started this thread. My system is a little different though. All Murrey lines are not created equal. I like to use price action patterns to kind of filter my trades. That said, it's an awesome system.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Trading the system, watching 14-16 pairs only trading those that are 7 pips or under, 100+ pips for overall avg range and prev. 5 day range. I take trades @ 11 pm GMT using Alpari uk. Some good trades recently, will be interesting to see how this system does, cheers. AT

--- 帖子 #538 ---
but I do trade with MML's. I can show you 100 trades where this system worked and 100 trades where it failed. Just trading a break of a MML is not actually wise in my opinion. I always felt that using a price action filter and possibly some sort of volume indicator would come in handy, and it does. Look at this usd/cad example from last week. The circled candle is a pin bar. It's not a great pin but let's talk about what made this trade some great aside from the pin bar. Look at where it forms. We should all know that the 6/8 line is a strong support/ resistance level. On the lower level of my chart is an indicator knows as MFI by Bill Williams. It measures volume and a willingness of the market to move. You can research it for more detail. What I will say is that a brown mfi indicates that the current trend (which was up in this case) is losing steam and that a reversal should be forthcoming. For added confirmation, just look at the top bollinger band as another level of resistance. I traded this like I trade all pin bars with my entry being 10 pips below that circled candle and my stop loss being 10 pips above the high of the circled candle. I used the lower band as my exit but I closed half the position at the 4/8 line for 77 pips. i exited the entire position at the 2/8 line for a total of 99 pips. Just my 2 cents though.

Not the same indicator, but I've done predominantly the same thing

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Microsuck, could you please upload exactly this indie.. this seems to be very clear on the chart without cluttering up too much... Thanks a lot. Regards, SSL

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Something as simple as the nonlagdot indy is enough to keep from entering while move is still developing...BTW, dietcoke, Thank You very much for your great mods to the original MMLs indicator......

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Pardon the interuption to the thread...just a quick question...I looked within the thread for the default periods you guys are using and didn't find it...I assume you all use the period of "64" ? Is that correct?

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Hi can anyone add a signal alert to this indicator? In particular at every setup change of the indicator and everytime a buy or sell line is touched thank you in advance

--- 帖子 #544 ---
First down to around 1.2200 (4/8 MML) then up to 1.2660 area (8/8 MML + 3 distribution areas)

--- 帖子 #545 ---
We are approaching the mentioned area. Exit long, prepare for short.

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Hi all I have just come across the Murrey Math lines and have the indicators now on my platform. It is looking very good and I even managed to match a lot of my own trendlines to it. I would love a discussion with ppl using this system to see how it has done in the past. Any particular symbols it appears to work best with etc.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Hi Wendy, Here are my trades, still open, in usdchf. As you can see I use a combination of MML, Gartley and demand/supply areas.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
The attached pic shows three daily charts of EURUSD for the past 37 days. Each has a different Murrey Math Lines indicator attached as per the indicator name in red at the bottom of each chart. Whilst they all agree that 1.31836, 1.26953 and 1.22070 are significant prices they all disagree on which levels they represent. I'd be pleased if an MML expert could tell me which indicator is giving the correct levels.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Taken directly from first post: "Any MT4 broker will do, but please fully understand that a different broker may provide different data which will result in your Murrey Levels appearing different than mine."

--- 帖子 #550 ---
All three charts are using the same broker: FxPro . All three indicators are using a period of 64. However I just realised that, unlike the other two, the MML_Multi_Option indicator has to be set to the time frame that the user wishes to display. I previously had it set to 60 instead of 1440, which has been corrected on the attached screen dump. So now the MML_Multi_Option and Murrey_Math_MT4_VG indicators are the same as each other but both still differ from the MurreyMath TimeFrame indicator and I am wondering why. (I now see that the MML_Multi_Option indicator can be used to display longer time frame levels on a shorter time frame chart, which I assume was the intention of its author.)

--- 帖子 #551 ---
I have been lurking around this thread which I found interesting about the MML trading system. IMHO I found these MML lines are very accurate at most of the time. Yes, I agree with you that just simply trading breakout is not wise and may prompt to more false signals. To overcome this weakness, I am using price action with combination of OSMA divergence and Bollinger Bands as filter on a daily chart. Sample screenshots below are worth a thousand words. Here I am ready to go long XAU/USD when market opens on Monday. In the second screenshot if one entered the trade carelessly then they would have lost 300 pips due to retracement before the price shoots up.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
I'm trying to learn this system, looks pretty simple but do you recommend any other indis to go with it? as a filter?

--- 帖子 #553 ---
I am providing my indicator for evaluation.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Fixed little problem.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Does anyone know of a way to manually backtest the Murrey Math Indicator in MT4? The indicator only paints in the present, but is there a way to show the position of the Murrey Math lines in the past (without an ea)? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #557 ---
lines don't apear for me. and what is that gator thing?

--- 帖子 #558 ---
[quote=mer071898;3186285]{quote} I'll tell you this, with any strategy you'll have weaknesses. I personally think that even when the market goes through it's normal changes over time, this strategy will survive because it is based on mathematical facts and not speculation or sentiment . It is emotionless and cold, not letting greed overtake the situation. {quote} Mer, I think this really offers your opinion of long term viability using MM. I hope you see this. Many thanks. F-S

--- 帖子 #559 ---
good stuff

Added descriptive text to Murrey Math lines and changed lines to dotted.

that indicator is exactly what i need, thank bro

I am getting error while compiling this indicator

This thread is years old ... characterized by very low activity ! Usually it makes no sense to reactivate thingies like this. Better to go to actual threads about murray math strategy created by "Masterrmind" here in FF !

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Plz share the thread link on Murray math (by mastermind) for easy access.. Tanx

--- 帖子 #259 ---
You want a link, here's a link https://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=567962 Try The Quarters Theory It's less lines and come with a book to boot, and the guy is still alive I must admit though, old Murrey was great entertainment value PS - just jump to Chapter 5 for the nitty gritty, don't need all that price action chatter and fundamental fuzzy stuff

Thanx buddy..
