Greetings all, The method I am about to explain is not full proof, nothing is in trading. Now I would like for you to think about every aspect of my method and try it on your charts while applying your minds to it. I call it “my” method because this is how I trade. It is by no means something I have created. It is just information I have sorted out of all the tons of info one gets throughout a career in trading. So it is bits and pieces from here and there that make up what I live off of. To it then, 1- When I look at a daily chart , what sticks out more than anything else to me is the fact that price tends to travel from one 500 point to the next. So I have a grid like structure on my charts showing 1000 and 500 points. Those I consider to be my major horizontal lines. I also break up every 500 area into minor 250 and 125 points. For example, EURUSD, I have 1.40000, 1.45000 and 1.50000 as major lines; and in those I have, 1.41250, 1.42500 , 1.43750, 1.46250, 1.47500 &amp; 1.48750. The red font numbers are the minor 250 and the black ones are the 125. 2- Weekly charts are where I derive my trading week bias from, however a lot can happen in one week, so I tend to be very flexible with my bias. The reason being, daily charts to me are telling the now and today story. What I look for on the weekly is either a strong rejection candle off of the major lines of the grid or a bold close above/below the major lines. 3- PA This is something that can be talked about at length. What I like to see is convincing price pivots (NOT PIVOT POINTS) signaling a change in direction be it short term or not, it does not really matter as long as I get in it where I should. Below is a picture showing Price Pivots. Now a price pivot is said to be confirmed once the third candle (aka confirmation candle) closes. A long entry in the case of a pivot low should be at the open of the fourth candle, BUT I wait it out until I get a good retrace into the swing from pivot low to the high of the confirmation candle because I have a thing about big drawdowns especially since most days in PA tend to retrace quite a bit before continuing their way IF THEY DO. Also I tend to trade more than one pair at once because price pivots once in one pair appear in many other simultaneously, and the entry in the retrace zone will help keep one’s mind in check not to mention heavy drawdown before the trade will go in favor. So what I do is place a Fib retracement from the pivot low to the high of the confirmation candle, then drop down to a 1h or 30m chart and wait for another (but should be) good looking price pivot. Once I get that combination off of the 61.8 or 50 or 38.2 level I enter my trade at the fourth candle and at market. I also sometimes can enter in the 100-61.8 zone if I like the PA and get a good looking price pivot. What this does is give me most of the time an entry at a better price with a smaller stop compared to the open of the day. Sometimes price will just run away in my direction from the open. I do not chase it I just disregard this pair no matter how good it looks. I insist on having my retrace... 4- I use a few indicators as well: - EMA 5 &amp; 10 both at the close - EMA 200 close - RSI 14 - Recently I have started using a currency strength meter that helps pick out the pairs. But I only used it with confirmation of price pivots. We can discuss this further at a later time. My favorite would be the RSI because it tells a lot about PA. I mainly use it for divergence, hidden divergence and trend identification with entry confirmation to name a few. I have learned to love RSI and to respect it the most among the many indicators out there. For example in a bull market RSI will fluctuate between 40 and 90, it will then come down to the 40-50 zone for support then continue its bullish trend. The reverse is true for a bear market where it will fluctuate between 10 and 60 with 50-60 acting as resistance. There are many more ways to trade using RSI, but for now I will content myself with this. 5- Stops &amp; TP I usually place a hard stop ten pips below the daily pivot low and then trail my stop to the low of every subsequent daily candle that follows the successful entry. TP if you want to place one can be any of the major or minor lines, depending on PA. TP is really a personal preference, I like to stay in a trade as long as possible until the market takes me out or once I get a convincing opposite price pivot. I will post a few screen shots as soon as I have more time, this way you can piece it all together. I think this method has a lot of potential, and I would like for everyone who is interested to participate in this thread to make this method better. Note: What was discussed here was related to a pivot low, the exact opposite would apply for a pivot high. Regards Chantal

On the 7th of June 2011, in combination with the 6th and 8th we got a Pivot high formation, the entry was to be on the 9th with a hard stop 10 pips above June 7th. Dropping down to H1 I waited for a retrace that came in nicely and stopped at 61.8 Fib with a good rejection off this level. I waited for the confirmation candle after that and once it closed, it created another Pivot high but this time on H1 and in the direction of the daily Pivot high. My entry was the open of the 9 am GMT candle. The trade is still running and I intend to add to it once I get a retrace into the still valid Pivot high which now has Thursday’s and Friday’s range added to it. Please look at the new Fib Retrace in Green on the third chart. Also if you notice we had a weekly close below 1.45, to me this is a sign of potential continuation of bearish trend for this week. I am going to call it a night, and will continue once I see some response. Thank you, Chantal

Here is the third chart...

Thanks Chantalb Sounds very good. Now I a have a few questions if you do not mind: How many set up approx do you get daily? Do you trade all the pairs? A bounce from a minor horizontal line is also valid? How long have you been using this method and what return have you got? I thank you in advance. All The Best Il Brigante

What I have described above is the safest way to trade this method, at least to me. I deliberately chose higher TF to have a life outside trading. I have been trading this way for a little over two years now; it works on any TF and any pair. All you need to do is tweak it to your own preferences. One can also do without the fib retracements and just trade every PP (Price Pivot) with disciplined MM (money management) on the TF of your choice. On average I have between 5 and 8 entries per day, sometimes more and at other times I get even pickier about the trades I want to enter. I actually came a long way to finally be able to get myself to trade based on the D1/W1. In my analysis I also incorporate monthly, quarterly and yearly TFs. From January 2010 until today I haven’t had a month less than 56% ROE. The best month was October with 360% return. Now someone will eventually ask, real or demo … REAL… But whenever I feel I need to change something in the way I trade, I do that first on demo for at least two weeks. Minor lines are important levels to me because they are areas where short term sleeping orders lie (TP as well as Entries). So let’s say a bounce off of a minor line and or a breakout/breakdown on H1 through that line gives me the chance for re-entry. On the bounce I trade the PP and BO/BD I go with pure PA. But more often than not these levels will offer very valid Price Pivots, and you will notice than the confirmation bar (in a pivot low) will frequently close right over the minor line. I use 1000 and 500 lines with their minors; however one can use 100 and 50 lines with their respective minors. Those would be 25 and 12.5… Take a 5m chart put in these levels and study how price moves between them… You will sooner or later come to the conclusion that price action is all the same, be it on a 5m chart, daily or what have you… Chose your poison LOL Hope this helps, Cheers Chantal

Hi Chantalb Thank you for your response So if we want to try this system you suggest to draw the horizontal lines majors and minors as you described in the daily TF, once the PA at those levels is formed we draw our fibo on the daily confirmation candle (the last one), we then scale down to 1h TF and wait for a retracement and a formation of a new PA in that TM. We buy/sell at market at the confirmation candle and place our SL 10 pips above/below the daily formation candle. We then trail our SL above/below the daily candle until stopped out. We use the weekly TM as a kind of filter. Is that right? It will be nice if you can show us more set up. I will start to work at it and will show my set up. Also is PA only formed with 3 bars or can be formed with more than 3? I thank you in advance All The Best Il Brigante

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Hi Chantalb I forgot to ask you, do you trade only the majors or do you trade all the pairs? Il Brigante

The reason why I have the MAs on the charts is for me NOT to trade against the predominant trend. As you progress you will notice that those trades taken with the trend are much more successful as opposed to those taken counter trend. The minor and major lines are put on the chart to help give additional clues or even confirmation that we potentially have a correct opinion. Now the structure of a price pivot (as was my intend to explain, but your Q came first) starts as a 3 candle formation, it extends to 5,7,9 etc.. It will obviously always be an odd number except for the 1 naturally. I work with the 3 and 5, and most softwares provide a 5 indicator better known as Fractals. We trade the 5 the same way we trade the 3 i.e. we enter the trade on the open of the second candle after the fractal (ON LOWER TFs). The fractal will appear as soon as the fourth candle closes. The pristine fractal is made of a central high with two lower highs on each side (opposite for the low). From now on I will focus on the fractal or 5 candle price pivot. What a fractal does it is telling that we have hit a TEMPORARY high or low. I use the term temporary because in trading nothing can be a sure thing. All we can do is try our best to put a maximum of odds in our favor. So now when you put your lines in, your fractals and the moving averages, doesn’t it start to get clearer? I have to warn you, Fractals in metatrader can disappear in the event the fifth candle makes a higher high than the fractal high itself. Look at it in smaller TFs and you will see what I mean… As for the Fib, in case of a Pivot high (which means we are getting ready to sell), we place it on the high of the Pivot and stretch it down to the confirmation candle low… not on the confirmation candle alone… I trade all the pairs whenever there is an appropriate setup. Ok in a while I will show some more examples. For now Look at EURCHF D1 that is one perfect setup for tomorrow’s entry… Chantal

I had a chance for re-entry at 9am GMT candle, however since I wanted a short entry the signal candle (the first one that got rejected off of the 38.2 fib) was too bullish for my taste and the confirmation candle was a weak bearish one. So I passed… Now I will wait for another setup. More charts to come in a few minutes...

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Nice thread, Chantal. Ties in with how i'm trading the longer TFs these days, inspired by Nomask's Trading Major Lines thread. I have weekly hindsight as down and closed below 1.4500 level, i then use 4hr Heikin-Ashi candles to home in on an entry, which in this case will be short from a bearish closed HA candle. Don't want to hi-jack your thread, just pleased to see a similar analysis.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
On may 23rd 2011 price came into 1.4000, went to 1.3968 then pulled back up to give a daily close at 1.4012. On May 24th we had a bullish candle with NO down wick. So we have a Low (of the 23rd) and a Higher Low (of the 24th). We look to see if this is a valid 3 Price Pivot structure and it turns out it is both the 3 and the 5. But considering we were just looking to have a 5, the fractal would appear on the close of the candle on the 24th of May. One could opt to enter at the open OR wait for the retrace as I do. So I dropped to the 1H chart and put in my fibos extending from the low of the 23rd to the high of the 24th, slept and came back in the morning J … There came several entries I could take based on price action, but for now let us talk strictly PP… and even with PP we had three… #1 at 9am GMT #2 at 12pm GMT (3 structure PP) and #3 at 16pm GMT (a 3 &amp; 5 PP). With only these 3 entries we wouldn’t have got taken out before the 1st of June if our manual trailing stops were at the low of every previous candle. It would have roughly made 250*3 pips… However one can chose to trail at the previous 2 or 3 lows… We will get to that I flunked all of my art courses in college so excuse the poor images…

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Thank you sidefx, no don’t worry about hi-jacking, we are all here to share and to learn from each other. I tried HA many years ago, with good success, but I prefer regular price. To each his own I guess … I’ve read through Nomask’s thread, he seems to be a very astute trader. The higher time frames are the way to go…. It took me literally TEN years to accept that fact LOL Chantal

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Last week GBPCAD had a close below 1.60000 and we also had a valid setup formed Friday as the confirmation candle. But yesterday also gave a counter setup, what I do is I first try to go with the weekly bias, if that does not come through I change positions if the conditions are right. Now where would be a valid setup? Trend and or counter trend… This is open to anyone following… Chart 1 Blue highlighted area is Thursday n Friday, Green is Monday Chart 2 Fib swing based on Friday Monday action, counter last week close… notice how price today cuts through them like they don’t exist…

--- 帖子 #14 ---
This is a trade I could have taken, but was probably doing my best drawing on charts… It came at a 500 number, with the daily up trend and gave a perfect PP off the 50% Fib. Now you will see that I stretched out my fibs to include the new high made this morning at the 7am GMT candle. This is what I normally do as long as our daily signal is still on. Had I not price wouldn’t have came back into my fib zone. Try things out on your charts and it will start making much more sense, I guarantee. I hope we’ll cover all this sooner than later so that we may all be on the same page. Thanks Chantal

Eyeing EU for the short... reasons, good pin bar off the 500 line (4 pips shy of it, to me is still valid) and also very close confluence with the 50% line. Assuming the current candle will show some bearishness. Stop will be at the high of Friday plus ten pips. Alternatively if this hour will not close to my liking and the next one will, then I will enter at the end of the next hour… Let’s see how it plays out… Note: The pin bar with the candles on its right and left make the PP... Forgot to mention that... That is of course unless the current candle doesnt take out the high of the PB... EDIT: The candle closed nicely as an engulfing bar, and covered three candles before it... I'm in

The setup candle of the 30m chart looked even better... Ok done for today... Chantal

Hope all is great with you chantal thanks for the invite to your thread, reading it tonight made me happy cos you took decision finally to share it with all ... even you did shared your system with me from 8 months, yet i never explained it briefly for anyone ..., reading your words tonight explaining your system in a very clear way, made me so happy cos your system will help many traders to become better as traders ... will help them to build a nice setup with one goal to make profits in the Fx market as a professional trader learning from the best. During the last 5 months, been trading the market following your setup of 2 candles in one direction entering on the third following fractals, yet my biggest mistakes was when i was trying to predict the setup before it happen "yes yes still the same crazy trader nothing changed"... for example last gbpusd down fall last friday took it long from deep betting that on monday market will make a nice setup and go bullish ... made 128 pips but based on luck to be honest more then a clear setup. Also i was lately facing hard time putting stop lose under the fractal, as market especially on gbpusd stressed me so much cos too many fractals will appear "market bubbling" hitting my stop lose for after market go in one way and i m not in it so increasing stop lose was present in most cases in my trades for after to close them with big lost. Yet, what i love in your system the most is how it show the move on chart when it's small, as building the foundations of a tower ... yet market might switch direction ... but it's the greatest feeling of all when i follow your setup and the market go my way ... on the other hand it's the baddest feeling of all when market hit my stop lose tricking my tricks following this setup ... always i feel big players was playing against this same setup you follow ... anyway lucky are those who are patient enough to keep on following your setup to ride each big wave they will harvest lot of pips ... the best waves i m profiting from following your setup is on gold chart, in the same time i m writing this reply, an open trade on gold long still on with +218 pips... always i follow 1h chart to scan 3 candles with one direction Less i can do for you is let all my traders friends know about this thread on forex factory ... for you to get lot of replies Best Wishes - Tony

Great thread, this type of trading pure Pa is refreshing. Subscribed

Hi Chantalb I think I got it, after your clear and detail explanations. Thank you. I will also post my trades as soon as possible. All The Best Il Brigante

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hi chantalb.. Looks to be very interesting. Nice to be at the beginning of a thread for a change Question about confirm candles. Why do you consider the green arrow marked candle, isn't also a confirmation candle?

--- 帖子 #21 ---
- AUDUSD - NZDUSD - EURCHF - GBPCHF - AUDCAD - CADJPY - NZDJPY - AUDCHF My day started very late as I had other things to take care of... Good day to all Chantal

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Good to have you here Ironbark. No the confirmation candle is the one that closes AFTER the Pivot High in this case. Please re-read the thread, it is barely at page 2… And after that if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer. Cheers, Chantal

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Thank you for your compliments... Glad to have you onboard

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Great! Waiting for your trades

--- 帖子 #25 ---
A lovely run down from your entry overnight, i'm with you on the EU short but from 1.4432, as i used a closed 4hr candle for confirmation I'll certainly be looking at the 1hr for entry next time, still it's +125 atm but i have resisted moving the stoploss, as i'll follow your advice and trail over each daily high...looking forward to following how you manage your EU trade. Good trading!

--- 帖子 #26 ---
It is good of you to drop by. Now, dear friend, there are some fundamental changes you need to make to you trading, as we had discusses many times before. No one can do that for you except you! Unfortunately, it seems that what has rubbed off on you from my trading method is the scalping technique of the lower TFs. That mixed with your trading style is toxic… that is why I had given you the nickname “Kamikaze Trader”… Please Tony, I have explained a very safe version of my trading here, I want you to delete everything else you know of how I trade and apply strictly what is here. Stops will always hit… There is no one trader in the world who doesn’t get stops hit every now and then. This is why we have them there… they protect our capital and make us realize that we had a wrong opinion… I think when a stop is hit; it is a good thing because it keeps our ego in check and our confidence at bay. Overconfidence is the quickest way to deplete an account. Yes 70 % of the time in the beginning of the week the markets tend to reverse back to the mean, and then on Wednesdays or Thursdays they tend to continue the path they were on previously. This gives us the chance to load more positions at a discount as I did yesterday with EU. Hope this helps, Chantal

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Yes really is a nice run down... Glad you could join in in this trade

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Here is the chart showing the result of yesterday’s 19GMT re-entry on EU. Now I added another feature that I am contemplating. I might add another trade at the retest of the 0% fib breakout area (around 1.4319) once it comes and if it does. What we are looking for here is a down move then an up move to test the break with a clear rejection down… Had I know how to draw it on the chart I would have, but this goes beyond my drawing skills. If anyone understands clearly what I am saying and they have the required artistic talent , please draw what I mean so that others can understand… Thanks Chantal

--- 帖子 #29 ---
I just bought EURCHF at the open of the current hour (11GMT) off 38.2% Fib. Even tough I would have liked to see a stronger confirmation candle, this one will do for now... Who else cought that? Edit: SL is at 1.19926 some 174 pips... a little too big for my taste, but will stick to my rules...

--- 帖子 #30 ---
These pics show what happened with my trading ever since I started incorporating the currency meter (June 9 till 15) I talked about in my first post. Now I had some very sloppy entries as is clear in the stopped trades due to being in a hurry to want to be in the market. This should teach me a good lesson… But overall I am very pleased

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Will take a long in a few...

--- 帖子 #32 ---
This is the retest I was talking about… The candle I point at in the chart was at one point a bold bullish candle BUT got rejected off the 0% fib breakout and closed very nicely … This is a very clear and bold rejection to me… I hope it makes sense to everyone… Chantal

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Interesting, so if you were to add more on this type of rejection PA on the hrly, where would you place the stop?

--- 帖子 #34 ---
To everyone following this thread The trades I talk about when I say I am about to enter are not any recommendations for you to trade the same pairs . I have to insist that the whole point behind this thread was for me to show people how I do things, and ultimately help others to trade better. So I kindly ask you to be very cautious if you are following my footsteps, you will be trading at your own risk. And also never forget to put a SL whenever you trade EVEN IF IT IS ON DEMO… Thank you for your attention, Chantal

--- 帖子 #35 ---
At yesterday's high + 10pips It is true we are entering on the hourly chart BUT our hindsight comes from the daily and weekly data… Is it clear to you now? As of tonight 00GMT we will have a new Pivot High to work with... can you see it forming? The trade I described above is a little advanced, but I wanted to share my thoughts with you all...

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Many thanks, it's clear ...quite an eye-popping stop for an add-on ..probably not one i'd use to build the position, but really useful to understand your thoughts on the hrly price action. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Hi Chantalb You say if I am not wrong that you choose your direction based on the weekly bias or the daily emas. What would you do when the weekly bias gives an opposite direction of the daily emas? Also how do you trade during news release majors and minors? All The Best Il Brigante

--- 帖子 #38 ---
I must admit, out of all the system threads out there, this is by far the most promising. Thank you for sharing your wisdom, I cannot wait to trial your methods when examination time is over.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
One has to do that if working with the daily tf...I honestly haven't found yet a way to have a stop that is different and that gives the trade enough room to mature... Maybe we can all work on this...

--- 帖子 #40 ---
I will try to explain further… 1- It is not a direction that I choose per say… it is a hindsight or bias if you will. I remember saying that I was even very flexible with that weekly bias as well because a lot can happen in one week. The weekly close is just telling me to remember what happened and where price closed last week for a POTENTIAL continuation. 2- The EMAs are by no means something I use for deciding the direction I TAKE . I also said clearly that and I will quote “ The reason why I have the MAs on the charts is for me NOT to trade against the predominant trend.” … What this means is also a reminder that I have to be even more careful taking a short for instance when price is above that 200ema and has been for the past say 3 months. It does not mean I will not take the short if I like it i.e. as I did on the 9th of June with EURUSD. I think this also covers your question about W1 opposite to etc… 3- The week of NFP is usually a period where I take a break … I also do not trade any day where one of the major participants is missing i.e. London/NY/EU… I think as traders we work very hard and deserve those breaks. That’s my humble opinion since I put at least 12h/day and sometimes much much more… As for the other news, in case I have open positions, then my stops are in place and I won’t trade right before a big news event… I hope I have answered your queries… You know it is way harder than I thought it would be to explain my method in a clear way so that all can follow… but anyway

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Welcome and thank you...

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Please if you do want to try this method, demo it for at least 6 months if you are new to trading, and demo again at least for 1-3 months (minimum) if you are an experienced trader. I urge everyone's attention: Trading is VERY DANGEROUS , it can BREAK YOU . Trading is NOT an ATM machine... Nor is it a quick way to make millions… But I can assure you that in trading you can lose A LOT at a blink of an eye… So be very cautious. Thank you Chantal

--- 帖子 #43 ---
just to say thank you for sharing this I will demo this but pls can I beg you for a favour, can you package the first few write up of yours with the diagrams so that some of us can at least have a good system that we can work with. Thanks for your understanding. VIC

--- 帖子 #44 ---
You are welcome… I don’t understand what you exactly mean by for me to “package”… I have literally done my best here to share my knowledge and I believe I have been very clear. There is no 1 2 3 in trading or a “ready package”… it is something you acquire with a lot of time and if I may say YEARS and YEARS and YEARS of looking at the screen for at least 12hrs a day (I mean that). I don’t want to seem harsh on you or on anyone else for that matter, but if you cannot make sense of what I say here, this thread is not for you. It is an advanced thread for those who at least have the knowledge of what I am talking about. I am not MENTORING ANYONE, I am just sharing my knowledge and whoever can make sense of it, good for them! If it is a summary that you want, well this is as concise as I can get. If there is something you don’t understand I will do my best to answer you in depth, as I have others who have asked. Thank you, Chantal

AUDCAD is barely hanging in there with +7pips.... and EURCHF is down -74pips... The entry on AUDCAD was as good as I would like to see, however the EURCHF entry was very sloppy on my part YET AGAIN... My stops are in place, let the market decide what it will do with them... EDIT: I hope no one got in that EURCHF just because I took it. Please bear in mind the first notice I posted earlier...

I think you have misunderstood my method. The Fib you applied is on 3 weeks worth of data... I don’t trade this way. Tomorrow I would be looking to take a long after a retrace... Please if you want to follow this method, read the thread again... Thanks

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Hi Chantalb I think you are doing a good job, and as you said this is an advance system and I think it will take a bit of time to grasp. To be honest I don not understand why you took the long trade on eurchf, I am short (demo) on that based on my analysis of your method. Cheers Il Brigante

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Interesting thread. I must say I too am a bit puzzled with the long position here. Aren't the ema's indicating a down trend hence you would be looking for short positions. Anyway will reread the thread

--- 帖子 #50 ---
First two charts refer to 15-06-2011

--- 帖子 #51 ---
This is now... But even with this pivot high I would not take a short cause we are too close to 1.20000 I stick with my long... we'll see what happens

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Hello, As I said before I dont trade the emas... This method is called PRICE PIVOTS Yes please reread it Thanks NB: Post #40

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Hi Chantalb This is how I have entered, keep in mind that this was my 1st trade, so is not set up properly yet. In the below charts find the reason for my entries: Weekly, daily and hourly. If you wish your comment are appreciated. Cheers IB

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Hi Chantal I am just trying to understand why you went long. Thanks for posting the charts. It looks like an interesting way to trade and I am looking forward to the thread and to trying it out on demo. I can clearly see why you entered from just looking at daily and hourly charts. But from the weekly I would have thought the bias would be to look for a short position. However I can't say I saw any good reason to enter a short either. I do realize you don't trade the ema's but you said you use them so as to not trade against the trend which in this case is down. So I guess what I am asking is if trend is down and weekly bias is down what made you decide this trade was worth taking as a long. Hope that makes sense(I am not being critical)

--- 帖子 #55 ---
This is pullback of the fractals formed the 6/6/11. I got in because price are below the 200 ema (daily) and also because my entry candle closed below 1.3150 level. Maybe this entry is not that valid because the fractal has happend a while before? I do not know. Any comments? All the Best IB

Hi Chantal, if only all trades were like this one! 300+ now..stops @ b/e.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Hey guys… Ok obviously, we need to go over a few points that I took for granted, thinking you would be able to put the pieces together on your own. Just be patient with me as I am preparing more charts to explain and my analysis will follow. By the way I came very close to get stopped out this morning… price came into 1.19929 and my stop is at 1.19926 (this is the low of the 13th which I have at 1.20026 and 10pips buffer)… Looking at the emas and all is very well, but let me ask you this… what is any moving average based on? Actually what is ANY indicator based on??? In your opinion what is more important, following MAs or understanding and thus following a strong pin bar for instance right off a round number aka 1000 number? Also let us suppose you were trading and your indicator was in highly overbought zone, however PA was saying it wants to keep going up, what will you do? Which one will you follow?? Assuming I am giving you no choice but to enter a trade either long or short… Please think about the above and I would like to see your answers… Thank you NB: Got stpped out... Also I need you guys to download FXCM MT4 so that we can be on the same page... thanks

Past action In your opinion what is more important, following MAs or understanding and thus following a strong pin bar for instance right off a round number aka 1000 number? The Pin bar and round numbers but in this case I thought the Pin forming the pivot was weak and more a doji and therefore indecision.( I like my Pins to stick out like on 16th march and april 6th) I don’t pay much attention to round numbers but willing to learn Also let us suppose you were trading and your indicator was in highly overbought zone, however PA was saying it wants to keep going up, what will you do?

I'm sorry for the incomplete statement. what I meant is if the first write ups and charts can be made to a put in a pdf so that it can just be a manual. also please I wouldn't mind if you can also attached your coloured RSI as I can't bring that out on MT4. I'm here to learn and I thank you for your ability to teach. VIC

Indicators and all the fancy stuff out there that are supposed to predict tomorrow’s action are based on PRICE and price alone. Had todays bold down candle been a bold up candle, how would you have dealt with that? True I have called it a pin bar when it does not conform to "the by the book definition"… But let me ask you this, what do you see if you add the candle on the 13th and the one on the 14th together? Visualize it… Now based on that and had that been the case, would you want to buy or sell today based on PPs? What about if we added 13+14+15 together, what would have been the shape of the candle? These are not trick questions... I am introducing all of you to the inner functions of my mind… try to look beyond what is on the chart and beyond what you know about candlesticks. The way to progress is by feeding your curiosity... i.e. what if that or that, then maybe so and so... Why did we get that odd shaped Doji as you call it? Is it because all the big players in the market had a secret meeting the night before and decided “AHA, THIS IS THE CANDLE WE GONNA GIVE THOSE SMALL TIMERS TOMORROW!!!” … “LET’S TRICK THEM!!!”… ???? Or maybe because PRICE hit a BIG FAT WALL? I don’t know… maybe we should find a way to spy on them the next time they have one of their secret meetings...

I like your coloured rsi as well -works well visually

This is how my mind works In this chart, where did the buyers and sellers find balance? What number defines a buyer’s market? What number defines a seller’s market? If I had an open choice to buy this on any spot off the chart, where would be the most likely place for me to buy? What about selling? Where would I want to sell at, what is the best price of this market? Let’s suppose this chart was our family car, and we have decided to sell it. The black and red lines are all the willing buyers… who would we sell to? Would it be wise to sell to Mr. 1.20000? Isn’t Mr. 1.65000 offer more tempting? Now the reverse, we are buyers who have all the black and red lines as willing sellers… whom do you think I am more likely to pick? I hope this answers why I went with the buy on the daily pivot low … no seriously, I have no problem explaining again… And guess what, do you think I would still be a willing buyer at these zones? WITHOUT A DOUBT!!!

Indicators and all the fancy stuff out there that are supposed to predict tomorrow’s action are based on PRICE and price alone. Had todays bold down candle been a bold up candle, how would you have dealt with that? I am mainly a Break out trader and I would probably wait for a breakout as if today’s was an up bar it would be in a ranging mode True I have called it a pin bar when it does not conform to "the by the book definition"… But let me ask you this, what do you see if you add the candle on the 13th and the one on the 14th together? A double bottom and I guess I would look for a breakout I would certainly be looking for the trade to maybe breakout to the top because of DB but at same time I would be ready to hop on a downward breakout . except for the DB my bias would be down because of weekly chart Visualize it… Now based on that and had that been the case, would you want to buy or sell today based on PPs? What about if we added 13+14+15 together, what would have been the shape of the candle? Well then there is a strong pin bar showing a move down fitting in with my weekly short bias. What do you see?

But in reality Europe was having a holiday so probably a quiet day. actually I just realised I answered incorrectly above - if you join 13th and 14th you have a strong up bar but again I would wait for more clues as to direction as the bar for 10th is strong down bar . you would always get in earlier than I would. By the way, this is a great way to learn. Thanks for your patience and your willingness to help

Hi Chantalb Thanks for sharing your system. I am still confused with the entry criteria. Can you please have a look at the attached AUDUSD daily chart and explain how to handle those 13 pivot high/low? Also for the entry from "A", when we get an opposite entry of "B", do we keep the long position? Thanks, tentoerun Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Ok, since we are working with fractals, my entry of choice would have been on the retrace of the 9th of June. Now let's say we managed to get in somewhere on the wick and then we got the nice down candle the next day upon which we would have moved our stop to at the end of that day...and suppose we did not take profit around 1.2000 area, do you see that the candle of the 14th would have taken us out? Very well.. On the 15th would you have joined me for a buy? Today did you try to sell the last pivot high on the 14th? Did you try for a better price? My point is... we have to keep trying every day... there will be times where you will give up, and never want to have anything to do with trading ever again in your life... I've been there and at times still go there... but what this does is it forces you to LOOK, DISSECT, ANALYSE and breath with the market. Follow your day on all the different TFs, try to understand what, why and how things are happening...

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I guess it does because if the price does move up you have got in at a very good price

[quote=Minka;4697787] You think??? Oh Pentecost…. Right… and they all decided to have it on 1.20000 EURCHF No, it was a take profit candle… to me at least Note: There is no right or wrong answers, there is your logic and processing.

[quote=Chantalb;4697694] This is how my mind works Hi Chantalb Yes, it does makes sense buying a car at a chipper level, but it does not make sense on buying at that price if there are a lot of cars to sell, because there too many to sell I will be waiting to buy even lower and when the are less cars to sell and the weekly candle is telling me the are still many in the garage.

IB, if you go back to the definition I gave for PP, and if entries are supposed to be on the day after confirmation candle... where would you retrace entry have to come in? On the 8th right? What would have happened on the candle on the 13th to your position? Out with some profit right? Would you have not wanted to join the upswing on the 14th? I know I would... Guys I cannot hold your hands in this... you have to force yourselves to LOOK &amp; SEE...

It would be much more interesting if you told us how and what and why you did what you did if you were to explain it to us ... this exercise would also be to your benefit... I can do that of course but I want you to tell me first. The thing is, you can never get two people to think alike. You and I might take the same entries, based on similar logic, but based on your analysis you might be willing to hold on to a trade until it reaches another 700pips, whereas I might see a short term reversal and want that instead... Taking Profit or letting the market hit the manual trailing stop is a personal preference... I cannot know what is best for you, you can know that. I prefer the latter.

What are these two charts saying? First look at the weekly then the daily… If the daily candle were to close as it is now or maybe further down, what can logically be said as to what has happened and what might happen next? What is the higher probability direction price will take tomorrow or next week? Now nothing is ever a certainty, but we can always try right… Chantal

Hi Chantlab Prices have hit and rejected the 0.85 level on the weekly TF, on the daily a fractual is forming, so we wait for a pull back of the latter. IB

...i'm agreeing with you but thinking back to what Chantal posted a while ago re wholesale vs retail prices...i'm wondering if price on this chart is at more of a wholesale level now to attract more serious buying...on the daily chart i see a long 123...but 0.85 is the nut the bulls need to crack first.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Both of you are right BUT… What I see on the charts I posted earlier is the following… Two weeks ago we had a VERY bold close below 85, the week that followed retraced, this week up until earlier we had a RETEST of that breakdown that actually went as high as giving a very close triple top with yesterday’s candle and the one of 31-5-2011… now what this tells me, is maybe just maybe a nice down candle is in preparation for tomorrow or someday next week. But I would like to see today’s candle close deeper if that were to be the scenario to unfold. Did it occur to you to question the small ranges of the past week and this one? Even though this one is still incomplete… But I think you get my point… As for what sidefx mentioned, he has a point too. However this time if we wanted to long is the major line on our side? Hmmmm … ok so before we don’t get a clear view that price wants to maybe show some bullish action, we follow the trend down. Ok It's very late here, good night all and good luck

Good morning, Today I want to talk about how we can filter end of week trades. End of week stands for Thursdays and Fridays and sometimes Wednesdays. Of course what I am touching upon here is not a rule fixed in stone. Since all we are trying to do is avoid trades that could potentially hit our stops. Now when you look at any weekly chart, isn’t obvious that any week usually ends as either an up week or a down week? So what I am suggesting here is until you get comfortable with the system don’t take end of week trades that are against where the week currently stands. Just skip those… To be more specific… for example look at EURAUD, price is currently way below the open of the week, however we got a pivot low which is signaling to take a long. Don’t trade it… and if you trade it be careful… Use that filter until you feel you know what you are doing Yes you will miss some nice opportunities, but better be safe than sorry… Same applies to monthly i.e. if we are in an up month and let’s say there is one week left or a few days left, don’t take the pivot high if you get one… makes sense no? Another thing, don’t take trades where price is too close to 500 or 1000 numbers, unless you take profit on or just before those. EURAUD also applies here… Isn’t it obvious that 1.35000 in this case will most probably act as a concrete wall to price in the event it should attempt to climb up there?... Ok so now you also understand why I did not take that short on EURCHF yesterday. Even though I could and I would have taken a nice profit of at least 50 pips. But 50 pips is not what I aim for when I enter a trade. What I like to see when I enter a trade around a major line is actually to know that this 1000/500 number is at my back and will give me a push in the direction of my trade. I don’t want to see it block my way as in the case of EURCHF… Now if the week should close below 1.2000 EURCHF, then next week I would like to see a pivot high below 1.2000 so that I take a short…. I hope I am making sense to all of you and you are understanding my point. If you don’t please don’t hesitate to ask. Good day to you all, Chantal

Hi Chantal, Nice thread, wish you all the best Happy Trade. - Tony

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Top of the morning to you Chantal, Its the end of a most glorious Friday here. Thank you for the lesson on filters. No problems understanding that one. I have reread the thread Again and I may be getting a glimmer of what you see when you trade. The method is simple enough but seeing how you see what the charts are trying to tell is a lot more complex

--- 帖子 #91 ---
I see that you are still over complicating stuff… really it does not have to be so blurry… Just trade what you see on the chart, all the facts and news are in the price action. The daily candles say more to me than any news wire can ever say. Keep in mind that the euro is a very strong currency, had it not been for the issues with some of the member states, I think we would see it way over 2 by now… but who cares where it is or where it goes as long as we follow along cautiously! The way you traded this today is not at all how I trade. I am still short until the daily says otherwise with a convincing Pivot Low. Tony please, in order not to confuse readers here who are already having a hard time as it is following my thoughts, don’t post your analysis unless it pertains strictly to the method at hand. I would be more than happy to read your thoughts by email. Ok then, good luck on your current trade. Cheers, Chantal

--- 帖子 #92 ---

What are you saying exactly cause I'm BLOND ... what's with blonds??!!! Hehehe just kidding ... but I really am blond Actually yes I entered 4 new trades, but it is not something I want to discuss at the moment because it is a much more advanced entry technique to the same method. I want you guys now to just fully grasp level 101 of this strategy. Then once I see all of you are ready, we'll shift to level 201

Go open 1h chart now on eurusd and gbpusd and see how market is starting to go up forming one fractal and now we are on the second candle ... what i try to do is predict the setup before it happen using 1h chart Gbpusd is forming a perfect setup for an up move right now Happy trade everyone

Chantalb, thanks for the system, please can you post a chart to explain the filter,thank you

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Ok people, here comes the retrace of the 14-06-2011 EURUSD Pivot high… If price wants to keep heading towards 1.4000 we should CLEARLY be able to see that through price action on our fib levels that stretch from the high on the 14th to the low on the 16th. If EU has found a bottom at 1.4072 we will have to see that on the daily with a bold bullish candle. Remember what I said about RSI in the beginning of this thread? Well it looks like it is going to bounce back down from the 60-65 level in case of down move resumption… Now we wait very patiently until we get very clear signals… rejection+good PP formation i.e. Pivot high on the hourly.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Tony this is not how we are trading this here.... Kindly stop confusing the readers! Thank you

--- 帖子 #98 ---
[quote=Chantalb;4701017]What are you saying exactly cause I'm BLOND ... what's with blonds??!!! Hehehe just kidding ... but I really am blond [quote] LOL Me too, i.e blond Ok, if there are no trades can I bore you with a run down of what I think I have learnt. First of all I should have an open/flexible mind but form a bias from the weekly charts using the filters you mentioned earlier, bearing in mind that things can change quickly. Once I have a bias, say for shorts then I would switch to the daily TF and look for a nice price pivot for going short. With that identified, I draw the fibs from the High of the pivot to the low of the confirmation bar and switch to an hourly(or 30 min)TF where again I look for nice price pivots and/or fib retracements for an entry. During this process I am also aware of the main trend direction and where the round number lines of S/R are are located in relation to my prospective trade. This part is relatively straight forward but its all the nuances that are difficult to grasp. Stop loss 10 pips above Pivot high if going short. For example, when a pair looks ready for a reversal rather than a continuation of trend which is I think where I am having difficulties with your entering the EURCHF trade the other day. I also have to visualize putting candles together and analyzing what they are telling me etc etc etc

Hi Chantal Great market studies

--- 帖子 #103 ---

[quote=il brigante;4701561] Hi IB I don’t see anything wrong with your trade except of course that it is going against you now. Price might be retesting 1.4 breakdown at the moment and could come back your way… Had I traded yesterday I would have been in there with you… It is the nature of this business… we just have to accept that. But if there is one thing I can say is, trading the Asian session is not something I ever do… NEVER EVER… It’s just me, I am not comfortable trading this session. I would have been in there with you at 15GMT instead. One other thing I want you to do, is once price goes below the confirmation candle (as is the case here) and then retraces, stretch your fib down to the new low as you can see in my chart… makes sense?

--- 帖子 #105 ---
TONY what is the matter with you! This has nothing to do with this thread! Come on man... the strategy is in PLAIN English... Please would you stop now... I asked you very nicely to send your thoughts by mail and that does not imply you sharing them here UNLESS you follow THIS method... Am I making myself clear now? I WILL REPEAT AGAIN, PLEASE STOP CONFUSING THE READERS!!! THANK YOU And you going and editing your posts does not help either cause it has already confused people...

--- 帖子 #106 ---
[quote=Chantalb;4701670] You are reading my mind. I was questioning just before you send the above comments: the asian session and the extension of the fibo to the new low. One important reversal pattern that works most of the time for me when it reaches important levels is this: new high, higher high and lower low (all AT CLOSE not high and low) is mostly formed with 3 candles but it can be formed with more than 3 candles, but mostly have to be inside bars. And maybe it can be confirmed with by CCfp Diff on 1hour TH based not current. This pattern is forming just now (20 minutes left) on eurcad, at 1.40 level, if it forms I will add one trade placing a sell stop 5 pips below the pattern. IL Brigante

Tony grow up... I would really like for you to stay but not under these circumstances. You are not trading this method. You are free not to trade it this way but this thread is about this particular strategy and nothing else. And for your information, this is really how I am trading now... I am not scalping the hourly anymore or the lower TFs. Wanna know why... simply because I am making much much more this way... So if it is safer and makes more why not join in instead of scalp talk... Just my advice... Take care, Chantal PS: If I close all my current trades I will be in the 2000-2500pips... and that is since the 8th of June... So you decide if you wanna keep scalping, it is up to you...

The "Brigante pattern" did not formed on the eurcad, it looked like it was going to.... I can see also short set ups on eurgbp and eurjpy, but looks like the euro is strong across the board at the moment. Cheers IB

Hello chantal If you take a short trade at the close of this hourly bar on EURUSD, is your stop going to be above the high of 14th June daily bar or above the hourly pivot high?

With the Michi statement due in just over an hour, if i were erring on the side of caution i'd just leave it for the week. It's been a good one, why risk drawing down into the week's profit on a friday!?....BUT, news is often the catalyst for the 'Big Dog' move and if we want to hang onto their coat tails, we need to be able to weather a rough ride, in terms of stop placement.

I have just run into your thread tonight; and I read every postings in your thread this evening (eastern standard time/USA). I really enjoyed and saddened at the same time when I came to this posting. I was very grateful to you for sharing your trading method which I think excellent and I was looking forward to joining in. Sorry that some people are very negative, but you have to disregard and ignore them. Because it's human nature. Please come back.................. Thank you again for sharing. Fortuna

EURUSD Monthly Had this been the end of the month with such a rejection off this trendline i.e. breakout and retest, I'd be ALL IN LONG and very heavy mind you.... But the RSI looks like it has found its top. So I urge you, trade very carefully until you get clear signals. You can scalp and the best way to do so is go to BE as soon as you are +20 or so... Cheers Chantal

--- 帖子 #125 ---
You guys are right; I shouldn’t get upset over trivial individuals such as these… I will do my best so that similar occurrences don’t interrupt us anymore. Thank you for all of your support, Chicky that was very funny, thanks…

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Chantalb continue forward ... your thread is great indeed

--- 帖子 #127 ---
Very good question, I personally prefer the high of the 14th because to me that high if broken signifies we are having a change in direction. Now, one can place the stop above the hourly pivot, but my past experience has shown that one can easily get stopped out there only to see price resume its move in the trade’s initial direction. Alternatively what you can do if you are uncomfortable with such big stops is place it on or just above minor lines (in the case of a pivot high) that are above your price pivot. I hope this answers your question, Chantal

--- 帖子 #128 ---
You are welcome, I'm back

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Thank you Porfirio Ok now back to topic... Since EURUSD seems to be very popular I will focus on this pair, same logic applies to anything else... By the way I trade PP in everything, not just currencies. Who wants to tell me why I am still short EU with a short bias even though we got a relatively good looking daily PP setup to the upside on a MAJOR TRENDLINE? Guys, I ask such questions so that you may train yourselves. If I were to give you my answers immediately, your minds will get lazy... I mean well really…

yes ...anly cross ema 70 - sma 200

To answer your question Chantelb on the EURUSD The trend on the daily is clearly down. There is no trend line break and even more importantly yesterdays Hi - low has not been tested as of yet Cant post chart as at work. Cheers

Indeed! I guess I need to get used to looking at weekly candles

--- 帖子 #141 ---
When I technically analyze markets, my starting point always begins with the highest timeframe. The highest TF defines the Primary trends. Within the Primary exists lesser trends based on secondary and intermediate timeframes. The ones I am concerned with are the following: Yearly, Quarterly, Monthly, Weekly and Daily. 1- Looking at the EU monthly, it looks like this pair seems to be in a steady uptrend since 2000. If we look closer i.e. to the last three years, it has made 2 lower highs (one of which is possibly in the making as we speak) and 2 lower lows. 2- The daily shows that this quarter is doing a similar sequence as in 1 above. 3- The monthly has been clearly rejected from climbing higher ( up until now ) from an area very close to 1.5 4- The weekly has a H-L-LH sequence but with a major breakout and bounce (retest of breakout) off the trendline extending from the high in 2008 down to the high in 2009. 5- The daily has also a H-L-LH sequence What we have discussed in this thread so far is all fine in terms of major line bounces/breaches and etc… but what I want to draw your attention to now is the fact that Primary trends always prevail in the long term . What I mean by that is, the low made in May 2011 is very significant to me. Normally, price will never go past a MAJOR TRENDLINE and or MAJOR LINE (not even for one pip) unless it has future intentions to resume that move. If we zoom in closer and look at that particular day in May, 23-05-2011, I see a very bold bearish candle that shows me its intentions i.e. opened just above that trenline and closed nicely below it. I trade all trends; primary, secondary, intermediate and etc… The short positions I am currently in are either going to die on me with some profit or they will grow with the resumption of the down move. Am I in longs as well… sure I am… I have positions still open since January 2011. Do my stops get hit? Sure they do, that’s why they are there… I did not take any longs today because I cannot just discount the bold bearish candles that were made so far this month. Before I don’t see clear bullish strength (specifically on D1), there are no longs for me.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Hi chantalb, Dont your think the Eurozone issue might make the dollar stronger at least in the short term.?

--- 帖子 #143 ---
We are about to find out, aren't we By the way I did not forget about the charts you requested, it's just that what I was discussing then is very obvious and you can look at it for yourself. Thanks, Chantal

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Buddy you are in the wrong thread

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Hi guys, no much time, but look at this nice setup weekly PIN touching 0.8000 level, then scaling to diaoly TF (pin bar and cofirmation candle) - put fibo on those 2 candles and you can see nice double bottom pin bars on 50% level ... look at that momentum in next candles green pips to all of you (btw: excelent thread Chantalb )

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Thank you Kapybara, Nice trade, I hope you took it. Just keep in mind a SL and also if I were you I'd take it to BE now cause you are lurking in very dangerous waters... Look out for heavy sellers... Chart is below... Look at the thick red horizontal line... Chantal Also Look at the 4hr for clues chart 2

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Hi Chantal, unfortunately I didn't take that trade, I just noticed that setup 1 hour ago and wanted to share w/ all of you here as a ... let me say "book example" ... I see that resistance level and I know, this is dangerous zone right now ... when you take a look at monthly chart, the up move was rejected and this month can continue down (breaking 0.8000, engulf previous bullish candle ... when you look at weekly pin bar candle, this could be also hanging man candle and now can be simply confirmed by bearish candle) - so this rejection on 0.8000 level could be temporary. If I would take that trade, I would move my SL to BE already. I just wanted to show by this example, how simple is your trading idea/system you are talking about Once again, thanks for your wisdom you share here. Keep it up.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Hi Chantalb and all the rest. If I may say so. I like this method because there is the possibility to get in the flow of the market at a good price, reducing the risks. What I am not convinced about is all this technical analysis, for me TA does not work, at least in currencies, it is easy to make comments after the facts. Now we can use emas, RSI, resistance/support or what ever to justify and comfort our actions, but if FORD is investing in Spain, the dollar is going down against the euro and they do not care what the TA indicates. But what we can do is this: we can determine the force in the last couple days and try to get in at a good price hoping that it will continue in that direction, I say hoping because nobody know really what is going to happen next . How do we determine the direction of the last couple days? with an engulfing patter on the daily TF as it had happened in eurusd. (see pic). Once that occurred we draw the Fibo as you indicated, we wait for the retracement in the 1 hour TF and for a further ungulfing pattern in our direction. We place our SL below the pattern and after that we trail our SL by the daily candle until stopped out. This is what I think, but what do I know anyway. Your thoughts are very much appreciated. All The Best Il Brigante

--- 帖子 #149 ---
I get your point and it is very valid. We may come from different backgrounds when it comes to assessing the markets. Technical analysis is not something I disregard cause price is everything and through it a lot can be seen. Therefore, for me at least it is not after the fact that I use RSI for instance; it only seems so when I give examples of it. If you look at EURUSD 1hr chart, RSI and price are at a divergence as we speak. To me this is a sign of potential weakness in PA, i.e. Price is making Higher Highs while the oscillator is not following, and it actually is making Lower Highs. Another thing, in currencies we all get different daily candles. Mine does not correspond to yours as you will see in my daily chart. I have no bullish engulfing candle. I use GMT charts because I found them to be the best since they are closest to mirror London action. But then again this is a personal preference. Also I tend to add Sunday and Monday bars together

--- 帖子 #150 ---
This is a EURUSD GMT daily chart where Sundays and Mondays are added together... I don’t like Sunday bars so I tend to completely ignore them most of the time.

Hi Chantal, Hope all is great with you today ... i will do my best to grow up by following your rules here yet, usually i would like to share ideas as you know 2 heads is better then one or 10 heads are better then one ... lately i m only trading eurusd, gbpusd, and gold ... cos i have other obligations to do each day other then trading Forex ... here's my questions to try to fit here according to your rules: 1- can i talk about fundamentals as i see it from my eyes? as you know to trick the market you need to be more trickier then the tricky forex 2- can i share time frame of 4h following your setup? or the daily chart? but i love 1h as it's for me the front line the battle zone ... i would love more to talk about 1h chart as it's like hunting birds but hunting pips 3- no matter what i share here do know its from a good heart, and you know how much you are a dear friend to me ... just i came trying to share all in a good way to make the thread more alive yet i made you angry ... from 3 replies ... if you want me to reply here my ideas about the market will be a pleasure and an honor ... usually i m using my facebook wall lately ... Waiting for your feed back to know how to be an active member in your thread in a way to keep on following the spirit of your thread. Just was reviewing your comments and between lines i saw internet trolls are stalking with you ... my advise to you sister is simple to protect your self online: - block - delete - report - but never close this thread cos you are doing a wonderful work and you are the most professional trader i met in my 5 years ... and you are teaching traders how to make money ... otc brokers will hate you "cos they want traders to be lost and lose money" IB traders will hate you cos they make commissions when traders lose ... briefly it's a dirty business forex full of wolves and if you are not a wolf wolves will eat you in life or in forex ... i know you a real brave, strong, wise woman i hope your thread will always be here forever Wish you a great trading week

Eur/usd made double top on 1,4380 showing a strong resistance and a fractal is shown also i got a confirmation from qqe, so went short from 1,4326 stop lose 1,4380 ((50 pips) and take profits 100 pips = 1,4229 ... here's my first plan for today If you want i will study bigger time frames as 4h and daily but as i told you before 1h is the most alive for me as if like living in the present Hope i will be lucky in my first trade today. Best wishes

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Tony what we have here is a very specific way of doing things. If price does not fit our criteria we simply don’t trade, we wait for a better set up. Yes I know you are still trading what I taught you long ago, however I have come a long way since and I no longer scalp the lower TFs not even the one hour. I am not looking for 10 or 20 pips as I did even though I was having great results. I am in a position to stay until either the market takes me out or if I decide to take profit at a major line. Tony please if you want to post here, do that while respecting the method like for example member Kapybara (post 145) did yesterday. I insist on keeping this thread very clean, what this means is not for it to get sidetracked. Once a thread is off tracks it dies…. So if I may suggest something, and that is for you to open your own thread where you can talk all the fundies you like to your heart’s desire and also post your trades. I then will surely drop by and be a regular… ok? ... Great so now we have an understanding FINALLY

--- 帖子 #154 ---
[quote=Chantalb;4710566][font=Calibri][size=3]I get your point and it is very valid. We may come from different backgrounds when it comes to assessing the markets. Technical analysis is.. Hi Chantalb. I know what you mean. Also I think is important that we trade to match our personality. Divergence in RSI? 1 hour time frame? it could not be relevant for a reversal, and could be just be a slow down of the latest force. So which is the latest force? Do you agree is the bullish engulfing? (GMT or NOT). Anyway we can go on and on this....... What I think is important is that we work together exchanging knowledge for a common goal. I am going to trade for a while this way because it suit me and I will be happy to share if you wish. Cheers IB

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Daily trading fit my personality more, as i like to sleep at night deeply with no open trades worries ... still for me so early to trade long term trades tried to start a thread it say (((You need four or more vouchers to start a thread in the Interactive Trading forum))) ... this website is like torturing lol ... also they say members will give you vouchers according to your replies ... so do me a favor by giving me few recommendations by vouchers ... to start a funny thread for eurusd hahaha ... which will be a thread full of jokes more then trading ... i like the idea waiting from some vouchers ... all i need is 4 i think

--- 帖子 #156 ---
[quote=il brigante;4710967] I absolutely agree with you that we work together to achieve a common goal. That was exactly why I decided to open this thread in the first place. Yes kindly do share your trades; it would be interesting for people to be able to use a similar approach to the same method. For me as long as we don’t take out the open of the last bold bearish candle of the 15th with a strong bullish D1 close above it, we still are in bear territory. Also if you look at each candle individually and mark its midpoint, we still haven’t had a midpoint close above the midpoint of the 15th YET… All this in my mind adds up as weakness… So we’ll see… If there is one thing I do is I am never in a hurry to trade, if I like PA then I trade, if not I just sit aside and manage my open positions.

[quote=Chantalb;4711047][quote=il brigante;4710967] You are probably right. I am long cadjpy, risked 22 pips, gained my risk and I am moving my SL to BE. IB

--- 帖子 #159 ---
sorry here the pics.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Yes nicely done, I see you have your stop below you pivot low on 1hr… this is another way of placing stops. But since I trade longer term and got burned many times by placing my stops in such areas (as in below/above 1hr PP) only to see price resume into my direction, I decided to place them based on daily. IB, since you are trading an upswing you fib should start from the low and extend to the high… you have it reversed. In the correct projection, from low to high, the 1hr pivot low would have got rejected off the 50% almost to the pip. Chart attached… Edit: No no the only diff is you have the 61.8 &amp; 38.2 reversed (that makes a big difference)... your pic is so dark I missed the 50%

--- 帖子 #161 ---
hope you have luck friend ... but I think you get in early ...

--- 帖子 #162 ---
You right regarding the fibo. Regarding the SL I know is safer below the daily, but the RR is not that great. For a 100 pips risk, I need to make 300 pips for a decent RR. Specially when I am against the "trend" and I am risking only 20 pips, as soon as I gain them I move my SL to BE and if I get it right I can make 200 pips and that for me will be I sign that I am doing well. IB

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Chantalb For divergence, try the cfp indicator. Is a derivative of the ccfp. I found it very powerful. More info: http://articles.mql4.com/484 IB

--- 帖子 #164 ---
On the daily, the confirmation candle not closed yet, so how is it possible to apply fibs to pivot low and the said candle?

--- 帖子 #165 ---
gbp-usd...sell

--- 帖子 #166 ---
I believe that IB has modified the method to suit his trading style. He takes it off of D1 bullish engulfing bars… when he comes back, he will probably explain it to you further…

--- 帖子 #167 ---
I think you did not wait for the close of that confirmation candle before entering the trade, because if you had you would have seen it to be a weak bearish one. Also the supposed to be PP candle was a very strong bullish one, I don’t see any rejection of the 38.2 fib… Guys in order of importance and strength: 61.8% followed by 50% and lastly the 38.2% I don’t even look at 23.6%! Chantal

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Good Trade today. I make today the FIB from the High to the Low of yeserdays candle. Then from the same high yesterday to the Low of the 16th, the 5 C Low. At 1.6168 the 50%Fib and the 61% FIB are on the same level. A pinbar touched today this Level, a very good Entry, still running....

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Well RR is something else… I don’t recall even mentioning anything about an RR. The reason being; I don’t think the market gives a fit about what kind of RR we set… It will just do what it wants to do. But then again to each their own money management

I got stopped out on gbpaud, lost about 40 pips. Ranging market.?!?! I am still in with cadjpy and eurjpy both long. I have decided not to move my SL to BE as soon as I gain me risk, but to trail it above/below the daily. IB

Concentrate on few charts, like maximum one or 2 or 3 the best are eurusd, gbpusd, gold. eurusd to hunt 50 pips per day gbpusd to hunt 100 pips per day gold 400 or 500 pips per day Concentrate on few charts trading is not buying vegetables lol

--- 帖子 #184 ---
...i entered short last night with an initial stoploss above yesterday's high, just as well with the Asian run up overnight. I liked the confluence of fib levels and the round number (1.4400) and of course now we see a short 123 developing (yet to break) from these levels on the hourly.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
I've been studying because I think the strategy is very good perfect correlation of formation price pivot in D1-H1 as we have seen. and I realized that this relations also occurs in W1-H4... so I guess I should differentiate between w1-h4 and d1-h1 ... which so far had not made

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Unfortunately I cannot post charts here as I am at work for now ... but one quick question: Do we actually have a price pivot in the 1 H Chart at the bottom ? I refer to the candle 3 hours ago with its low at about 1,4353, after that candle we might - if my view is true - see a confirmation candle and the present hourly candle shows a retracement .... Is my view trew or arguable ? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Thanks brigante was indeed a good entry d1-h1 ... every time I see it more clearly

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Yes, this is correct, as it was for the hrly swing low before the one you refer to, too My bias from higher TFs is to the downside, so i'm only trading short at the moment....good luck if you take the long, 1.4500 will probably act as a magnet before too long if it doesn't break harder below 1.4400...lots of dilly-dallying before FOMC, not an ideal day to take new positions. Edit: If the hour closes above 1.4400 i'll cut my losses on this short...too close to FOMC volatility to bother holding longer. Exited for -54.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Thanks for your helpful contribution! This "dilly-dallying" was the case yesterday too and I am rarley sure about my personal bias what means ... I should stay flat But concerning the described constellation I could not resist to try the entry and saved me some pips with an early exit ...

Otherwise we only talk about opinions and theories which I am no interested in. Please let me know that you think. I am also looking at eurusd, eurjpy, usdcad, gpusud and gbpaud. Cheers Il Brigante

Porfirio Thank you for your comment. Yes my entry is based on D1-H1. I think your analysis is right this time, the trade is going against me.

Hello everbody, is my view right that there is a good example of a pivot low in EURUSD 1 H ? Now the plan is either 1) to go long with the beginning of the 4th candle - what would mean .. now ;-) ? or 2) we will wait for a retracement and would love to find the entry in a lower TF at the 61 % retracement .... true ? Thanks for your input!

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Did you take it?...there was a slight retracement you might have picked off from the 5min. EU's supply/demand levels have been great to see unfold these last couple of weeks. The pivot you refer to finding support from the demand seen last Friday (17th).

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Hi Sidefx, thanks again for responding Unfortunately I did not take the entry on candle 4 or rather on the retracement although - and that is tragic - I even observed the retracement in TF 5 M as you explained. But I am not quite familiar with this trading style, so I still observe a little bit ..... but in every case that would have been a very good and succesful trade which could have been extremly well executed by the trading tactics of this thread!

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Pairs I am watching, EU, UJ, GU, UCAD, GJ, and most interestingly EG where I will be taking a heavy entry at the top of the hour... Looks like a perfect setup Good trading to all, Chantal EDIT: Wow, closed it for a 20 pip loss... Somehow missed that there was news coming in...

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Thanks for the headsup on EG, not a pair i tend to focus on. Looking at the daily chart and 0.8900 is historically a key level.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
I see, maybe a better setup will come my way in a few hrs... we are still in the range of the daily PP on proper H1 levels... we'll see

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Hi IB, Did you take AUDCAD with your setup today? If so did you take it based on hourly PP or breakout of the D1 engulfing?

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Hi Chantal I have had to to do other things this week so I am not up to date with this thread. I was watching EU and EG but luckily did not enter any trades as I am not focused enough. Its great though, to see the thread is continuing (homework over weekend to catch up with all the good posts)

--- 帖子 #220 ---
hello chantalb I am seeing the entry into aus-cad tomorrow or Monday after a retracment ... d1-h1 CCI 14 in d1 shows a clear divergence

--- 帖子 #221 ---
No, I did not because there was not retracement. However since my participation at this blog, I had 6 trades, 4 losses, 2 wins, +5 pips total. So today I spend most of my time working on charts so I could improve and I come to the conclusion which you already mentioned that is important to trade in the direction of the trend. Also I find that is important to enter at a certain levels to avoid the possibility to get stopped out and seeing the trade go in your initial direction. I have attached a pic of usdjpy, where I have entered (red X) and then stopped out and where I should have entered (arrow down). Of course this way I will miss a few trades, but I think I would enter better trades. As soon as you enter some trade please post them, I would like to see you in action. IB

Long audnzd This is one of the winning trades I had and I was short (made about 60 pips), now based on my last analysis I went long. Comments are appreciated. IB

--- 帖子 #223 ---
usdcad short. Comments are appreciated. Like my amigos Porfirio I am looking to short audcad when it reaches a certain level. IB

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Serves me right to tighten my stop! That is an example why I like to have it on daily PP rather than hourly… Agggggrrrr not only out with a loss, it is going my way now!

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Hey, nice to have you back

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Hi Porfirio, Yes possibly, it all depends on how and where today closes. From there we might get a reverse back to lower levels by tuesday for an entry. I don't know about the CCI but the RSI shows a bounce off 40... remember what was said in the beginning of the thread about that in an uptrend... I guess we just got it...

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Hello IB, AUDNZD is a "special" pair with its peculiarity. I think it could be worth the try to go long, but be leery as the pair is in a downtrend (in the higher TF), there are some examples in the 1 H chart of the pair for flags before continuing the downtrend. Even now there could develop a flag with a possible conituation of the downtrend afterwards ... Good luck and lots of green pips!

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Hey IB The thing with UJ is that I would have liked to see a clear break (and close below) of 80. But suppose I took that trade where you have with the X I would have had my stop at the D1 PP +10, unless of course I was feeling stupid like I did today with EG… AUDNZD I wouldn’t have been in, way too close to 000 for my taste. On h1 I see a bear flag… watch out! USDCAD would have been a long but after getting that BIG black candle it would have been a no trade on the 1h AUDCAD we’ll have to just wait and see… Please give me the trades you entered 6 (4 losses and 2 wins) for me to take a look at them

Hello Dortmunder, It looks like we are seeing eye to eye on this pair, good to know

Will take another short at this 4hr PP

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Hi Chantalb, one question: What's the plan behind your short entry? I see that your pivot high is 1,4440, then we had the move down to 1,4125. Finally we already had a retracement to the 61 % fib level .. but that's all over now, I mean there is still some way left to the 0 % fib line ... but is that still a good risk reward ratio ? Please tell me, if I did not understand something crucial in this thread ...

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Yes you are right; I might have posted those a little too quickly without explaining them. I thought the pics were self explanatory. Actually this is a setup Porfirio follows (he works with W1 4hr instead of D1 H1). I wanted to show him the importance of confluence between the different TFs and PPs. Sometimes h1 can get too erratic for an entry on days just like today. On the chart the red fib is the one of W1 and the green one is D1 both extended from their respective PPs. The pin bar we got was off a zone of very close confluence between the 2 fibs. I don’t work with RR ratios, I definitely know my risk at all times and accept it when and if it hits me. Had I worked with RR I wouldn’t have a 440pip trade still on since the beginning of this thread. That is why I gave up RR long ago when I discovered its shortcomings. I hope this helps

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Chantalb, just to appreciate you for all your coaching. this thread is my best so far on FF keep doing the good work.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Hi IB, I just want to remaind Chantalb basics, we all should stick to them. When price travels between major and minor lines, then we always should have weekly bias clear, before we look for Daily PP and 1H retracements afterwards. Look at my charts, as I see it ( I know, I draw it after moves happend already and I didn't catch them , but it doesn't matter) Happy pippin'

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Ok since a lot of people are bringing up the risk to reward ratio topic, I might as well address it. To keep things simple I will also take EU as an example. Generally my risk is controlled by the distance of my stop to entry and that dictates the size of trade I will take. Suppose I have equity of 50k and all I want to risk per trade is 1% I get an entry with a 70pip stop; the size I would then trade would be equal to $7/pip The attached image will show you more clearly. My risk is fixed; however my reward is limitless so to speak, because the size of my trade is ever changing. If we were to consider one of the entries I had taken on EU at the beginning of this thread. My entry was at 1.46256 and SL 1.47052 (1.46952+10pips buffer) for a difference of approximately 80pips. Equity at 50k, my risk then was $500 for a potential open reward. I currently stand with this trade at some 460pips. Based on this MM I would have entered a trade size of $6/pip, thus an RR now of 1:5.XX Making $2760 for a risk of $500 in little over two weeks on one trade is good business in my books. So do I really care what an RR is or where I should get out to the pip because the RR says so… NO! As long I stand firm and loyal to my rules, I will always come out a winner. Good weekend to all Chantal

Got stopped usdcad short. I can see there many "experts after the facts" on this blog. Comments, theories, support, resistance fibo, pips in a week and nothing else. All BALLSHIT excuse my french. All analysis are useless if your timing is wrong. I have not seen yet a trade entered and posted and then closed with a decent gain pips. But what I heard is the amount of writing knowledge accumulated to support the lack of success in trading. If we were successful traders we would not be on this blog. That why I think is important to work together for a positive final goal. Trading is a ego trip business, most want to be a trader because the idea of easy life it has been sold to them: flat in Milan, drive an Aston Martin and wear a Patek Philippe watch, bad traders like to talk about the winning trades, good trades like to talk about the bad trades. As a mentioned in my post # 198 which I have not received any thoughts (only Porfirio has made an attempt), if you want to make this blog interesting place "your balls on the line". When you enter a trade you post it with comments and how many pips you are risking and then when you get out, post how many pips you made/lost and what did you learn from it. This is way I think this blog can go further. I will continue to place my "ball on the line" if I see you doing it as well. By the way I made 88 pips gbpcad long and 70 pips cadjpy short. I closed the trades because of Friday and because I wanted to close my week with profit so I can enjoy my weekend...... Al The Best Il Brigante

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Great post IB I hope to take part in this thread as the style appeals to me but it is different to anything I have done before - actually I have never thought of pivot trading except as per Bill Williams alligator system which is too mechanical for me. I can assure you I will be making lots of mistakes but thats how I learn. Also I learn more from people posting their losing trades rather than from their winning ones. Its only by analysing the losing ones that you learn something imho. looking forward to next week when I plan to be more active

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Good on you mate. As the weather there in Brisbane, is sunny here in Sydney but bloody cold, specially when the sun goes down. Cheers Il Brigante

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Sunny one day and perfect the next! (except for occasional major floods) Actually its been a glorious winter week - crisp cool mornings with beautiful blue skies and sunny days - brekkie in the sun on the front deck. I really appreciate Aussie weather as I have have lived a lot in Europe in previous lives and remember all too well the gloomy winters. I appreciate your posts and charts - learning from them

--- 帖子 #244 ---
You cannot beat it. I am from europe, lived in Italy and London, but sometime I miss it...... I am working on the charts and I would not be surprised next week to see strength in gbp followed by eur and weakness in chf. Of course events could have a say. All the Best Il Brigante

--- 帖子 #245 ---
I surely agree with you IB, and I am glad that we are all finally on the same page. It generally takes a couple of weeks before anyone interested in any method would start applying it and showing it. Since we are now all ready, we can start as per your suggestions. What I think we should do is have every Saturday some group analysis done, this way we will be able to prepare for the coming week. No entries are to be posted without a corresponding chart(s) explaining the reason for taking the trade(s), with corresponding SL and TP (for those who want to place one). Updates on manual trailing stops are to be described as well. For clarity’s sake, I would also like for all participants to post white charts instead of the dark ones. I am still on my first coffee, so excuse me while I have some more and after that, I’ll come back with some analysis.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Yes, it definitely helps! Thanks! So if I get that right, we just switch to a higher TF: We look for a price pivot high / low in the weekly TF and than we wait for the retracement in the 4 H. Now I looked a little bit more precisely than the first time and I see you already found your entry at the 61 % fib at 1,4320, right ? So you are now right in the trade ... or did you exit before the weekend ? BTW ... nice weekend to everybody

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Good morning Dortmunder, No I did not exit... Had I been scalping I would have waited for 20pips, closed half of my position on that and then moved my SL to BE. I would have been out now. I gave up this kind of trading in December of last year. It was just too stressful... I will be watching the developments very closely next week, and if the PA will not act as I’d like to see, I will certainly close it way before it gets to my risk limit per trade.

Higher TF Analysis, As I mentioned earlier I analyze yearly and QTR TFs. I also mentioned an area of balance between buyers and sellers. Generally when price trades above this level, this indicates a buyer’s market and vice versa. Now every TF has a different Balance Point. Below is a list of the diff BPs- - Yearly (2011) = 1.3767 - 2nd QTR = 1.3543 (projected 3rd QTR @ 1.3996 but still incomplete) - June = 1.4368 (projected July @ 1.4364 also incomplete) - Next Week = 1.4317 - Daily = 1.4250 (holds for Sunday-Monday, Tuesday will have a diff one depending on Sunday-Monday price action) I have plotted them on the first chart for you to see… The way to calculate them is just as you would a regular pivot point (H+L+C)/3… but instead of using only the previous’ year data for instance I use 3 =&gt; 3yrs, 3QTR, 3Mths, 3Wks &amp; 5days. I also consider midpoints of candles (and their closes) as previously mentioned to IB. Second Chart I still see general weakness in this pair. Although I don’t like the fact that the last W1 candle had a higher low and is an inside bar. We have 4 days left on this month and I will continue being bearish until I see otherwise. On the D1 TL chart, the magenta TL is more significant to me than the green one. What I expect to see next week if bearishness is to continue is a retrace back to the magenta TL that also comes close to the daily BP with an added 15 or so pips. This is all I can do for today… Good weekend to all of you Chantal

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Chantal, Nice thread you have going and may participate someday. Can you tell me where to get the pivot indicator on your daily chart that puts in the carets? Also I noticed Daily bars vary from broker to broker?? I use Oanda MT4 and the Dailies are different from yours a little to a lot.. Seems to depend on when sessions are started maybe somewhere in MT4? I would imagine it better to have daily bars most traders have. Thanks

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Hi Chantalb Thank for your time and sacrifice required to host his thread. It has been a hugh help to me. I like your teaching style, it is similar to another exellent trader on FF. I would like to ask for clarification on your post 141. To paraphrase, you indicated you held both longer term Long &amp; Short positions. Did you mean you held both Long &amp; Short on the EU at the same time (hedging)? I know some currency investers who trade long term, do this type of trading. thanks in advance gmcc

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Hi Chantel, first I must say, thanks alot for the clear way you lay out your strategy. and thanks again for sharing as that what pulls apart people from stars anyway, i am going to start this system this week beginning market open tonight and onwards, I hope along the way, especially this week while im starting out, you will point potential setups out as you see them, so i can follow along and start to get the hang of it. Again, many thanks to you, and i look forward to trading alongside you with this system

hi ppl just checking my daily eur usd chart. i hope im seeing this right, i have circled in a nice brown lol what im understanding so far is a pivot high, with a bearish confirmation candle, would this be a valid entry now for a short off a 1hr chart using the fibs rule. please let me know to see if im understanding correctly. http://i52.tinypic.com/1znmzoo.jpg

HI IB is something I have to study this week according to the SL CHANTALB placed 10 pips would go below the low of the day 23 (1.0223), but it seems to me too ... Where would YOU THE SL?

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Porfirio Do it like this: gbpjpy long, in @ 128.91, SL 128.17, R 74 pips. Reasons: Daily candle: inside bar. / 4 H candle: various indecision candles./ 1 hour Time frame: prices reached 127 BC and broke DTL. Doing this way is not only good for other traders, but most importantly is good for you because help you to be disciplined in an environment where to be disciplined is very difficult for various reasons. Also keep a file for yourself, so you can go back when you wish. Discipline and able to listen to the market are the keys. All the rest is only politics. I hope it helps All The Best Il Brigante

THANKS...I WILL STUDY

--- 帖子 #268 ---
To be honest I dont know were to place it, I normally place it 5 pips below the previous swing low (for long). Not the one you enter bur the previous one. That is why you need to fit the strategy to your own personality. Placing the way I do it, make sense to me. I am not sure what make sense to you. You need to find out yourself a SL that make sense to you and only you can do that. Different ways to place a SL has different pro and contro. Maybe you should place it somewhere where if it goes so much against you, you want to get out of the trade. Cheers IB

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Since we are Monday and I tend to disregard most Sunday candles as a day candle, there is not much of interest for me to trade. There is one setup based on TH-Friday that I am watching, if it comes through to my liking I will take it. It is still very far from my entry retrace zone (Green)… Below is the chart

Morning Chantal, im slowly understanding the system, but on this chart, what are you looking for to sell, in the green area off pa from fibs, am i in the right ball park here?

Then when the trades go in your directions you post how your trail your SL gbpnzd: SL moved to1.9798 eurnzd: SL moved to 1.7556 Trading is hard work, it is exciting when you lose money. It is boring when you make money. I hope you enjoyed my input and make any use of it. IB

i see, excellent, you wouldnt be so kind to post your daily chart of it, to see if im looking at the right things? Cheers

Retire48, those are lines that I draw on the chart by hand. Yes daily bars vary from broker to broker, what you choose depends on your preferences. I am told that GMT is what most floor traders go with, that is why I chose that. But what would I really know… you should pick your own. GMCC, I trade what I see on the chart. Even if that means I could be both long and short simultaneously on the same pair, but of course trades taken at different intervals and different signals. I don’t hedge, I trade both ways until I either close out or the market takes me out. My last long entries that are out now were taken in May. But I still have longs open that I took in Jan-Feb-Mar and those I will close out once I see price making a weekly close below 1.4 Deankenny21, Yes I will do my best to accurately show everyone how I do things… Glad you will be joining

yes thats what i was seeing, thanks Chantal for your prompt help. I got a bit eager to try the system as soon as market opened last night, so i went short eur usd at 1.4161 - i now think i was over eager, so whats would be your advice on that short, shall i take a loss and just say to myself too not be eager again, or continue on with the trade as normal, with sl at previous day high plus 10?

--- 帖子 #277 ---
The valid entry would have been on Friday… today or tomorrow we might be in for another entry based on the same PP but this time including the low made Sunday evening… (Stretching the fib down to the Sunday candle from the same top on Wednesday) I hope this helps, Chantal

--- 帖子 #278 ---
I dont have a sunday candle, i have a candle for 22,23,24 then the next candle is todays 27th But yes otherwise i would have understood. ill see what price does around 4250 then i think before pulling plug.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Hello Chantal If I have understood correctly original entry would have been last Friday but a short reentry is possible if a pivot point forms on the hourly chart later today or sometime tomorrow. If the present hourly bar closes down and forms a PP we could have an entry.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Hi Deankenny eur-usd last night was oversold in H1 (see the CCI14) ... bad time to go

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Yes that is correct. I would have liked to see a higher retrace though. Entry should depend on having clear bear action and sentiment in the close of the current hour. So far the setup is looking good off 38.2 but I say again I would have liked to see it on the 50% instead…

--- 帖子 #282 ---
for learning purposes, are these correct pivot lows (marked in red), and if so , why did u not long off these? many thanks http://i52.tinypic.com/ngqjl.gif

I really don’t know what setups you are following IB, but this gap trading is a big NONO in my book. At least until price defines the way it wants to go and until the gap is filled. Say, why the sudden aggression in your posts?

What do you mean? Which aggression are you talking about? IB

The reason I chose to start a thread about how I trade was by no means intended for bragging about what or what not I am or know. And it sure as hell was not started for me to make new acquaintances as I am not the cyber type nor a social butterfly, nor do I have the luxury of nursing others since I trade full time for a living. I did that simply because I believe in keeping my word once given. And I had made a solemn promise to share my method with the world if something were to come through for me. And it did on the 10th of June 2011. My system has its drawbacks as all systems do and as all traders know too well, in this business there is no full proof. Now if you can put what I shared to work for you, great! If not then you just have to move along to another thread or just find a way to make trading work for you. I have kept my end of the bargain with providence so she won’t come back and bite. It is unfortunate for me to believe in such hocus pocus but I do. Had I not I would have NEVER EVER shared all of this, no trader in the world would. I have clearly given all of you my ingredients and recipe; it is up to you now if you can put the stove on or not. I will continue being a participant of this thread until I know for sure that I have done my duty. Chantal

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Chantal, could you help me with post 282 please, i am genuine and more than willing to learn this excellent method and become a good contributor

I very much appreciate what you are doing and I very much wish to do my own cooking but still need to check with you that all the ingredients are right and being stirred/mixed correctly. I think I am well on the way to understanding your method but need to start taking live trades

--- 帖子 #288 ---
To be honest, I do not understand what you are saying and why your are saying that. I previously told you that I see the trades a bit different that you do (post 154) and I asked you if was ok to do so, in your post 156 you told me that you were happy to see my trades. I thought I could give an input in an open blog were anybody could give his best for the community. The trade with the gap was a trade that I followed for a while as you can see in my post to Minka (#244), I was not in that trade (eurnzd) before the end of the week, so as soon as the market opened, it gapped, was a bit more expensive but I did not want to miss it and I was not wrong. I repeat, I do not understand why you say things like that, (aggression, social butterfly, nursing others and so on). I only can deduct that is all and only in your mind.. By the way I do not follow set ups, I follow the market. And if you are not interested in that, that is ok with me. Cheers and All The Best Il Brigante

--- 帖子 #289 ---
IB I have no problem whatsoever with you posting your trades or how you follow the market. On the contrary I find your input refreshing and your trading style an alternative for others. I felt the need to post what I did earlier because I like clarity. And I thought it would be a good idea to tell on what was behind my motives of starting this thread in one post.

Hi Dean, I took the buy on the first one you point at. You can see the trades on the chart. It is a 4hr chart in this pic to fit the lapsed time on the trades taken then.

I did not take the short that came at the 38.2 PP formation cause I already was in a position close to that area. It is the one I took on Friday off the 4h chart.

Being able to follow along as a trade developes is the best training I know available. In the past when I found a tread that applied to me, I was three years late and the info was extremely hard to relate to. Thanks so much for everyones efforts. Please continue, for the sake of us needing help learning a precisely defined system that straight forwardly defines entry &amp; exit. Although I have several years of trading experience I have never been comfortable with my entries &amp; exits. (I believe most traders are just like me with that problem). This is the first system that offers a definitive answer to both of these issues (others are extremely vague). Please everyone settle down emotionally, this info is too valuable for someone to get their feeling hurt and leave. best regards &amp; many thanks gmcc

Chantel, i was following what you mentioned on the cadjpy earlier. Do you see any development on an entry now?

Yes I do and I will try for an entry at the top of the hour. But price is not bearish as I'd like to see... Nevertheless I am taking it unless this hour closes as a bullish one. Here are the charts... SL at D1 pivot high +10 EDIT: Bullish close =&gt; NO TRADE

Hi Chantalb, what do you think of USDCHF TF 1 H? Seems to be a pivot low, should we wait for a modest retracement ? P.S.

It is the 50% of the range of last week... often when price wants to continue in the previous direction it will not go beyond that... try it out; you will understand what I mean Higher midpoints show strength=&gt; up... And lower ones weakness=&gt; down

--- 帖子 #313 ---
This is for learning purposes. The below chart is current daily GBPJPY as you can see price is forming a bottom pp. So according to rules if it closed like this we would be looking for a buy tomorrow. But looking at the chart, you can see an obvious downtrend since 7th april. Would that cancel your opinion to buy, or would you still look to buy? http://i55.tinypic.com/30cw005.jpg

--- 帖子 #314 ---
To me this is a no trade because the bottom that was formed came in on Sunday. I don’t trade the Sunday Bars, I don’t take any trades on Mondays based on Sunday PP and none on Tuesdays based on Sundays. If the setup is still valid on Wednesday then I might consider it as I tend to add Sundays and Mondays together. If Tuesdays form a setup based on Friday Sunday Monday then I might consider it… If on Mondays a Thursday Friday set up is still valid I trade that instead as I wanted CADJPY earlier today. You following I hope…. Alternatively you can trade the way IB does by taking this GJ as an engulfing bar tomorrow and entering on the retrace. EDIT: Oh I’m sorry I didn’t answer you completely, down trend or not, if I get a valid signal to buy, I try… So I hope this answers the rest of it…

--- 帖子 #315 ---
ok for arguments sake and learning, just ignore sunday candle and treat it as all normal day candles?

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Besides everything else I mentioned above, we are currently too close to 130 and last week closed very nicely below it. So I don’t think you’d want to take this one for a buy… I’d try selling it instead once I get the appropriate signal or alternatively you could still go with the last d1 pivot high that was made last Wednesday since it is still valid (chart below)… Hope this answers you

--- 帖子 #317 ---
ooo yes, i didnt think to look for still valid setups, i like the short idea of gbpjpy since its nice downtrend i can see on D1

nope i learnt bad with demo, it made my emotions opposite so i overtraded on real account, i only ever trade real account now, because otherwise i cant attach emotions to a system

I sure hope you know what you're doing... Please at least study this thread well if your trades are based on it. Be careful, Please

apart from being too eager on that eur usd, i followed everything correctly, on a couple of others i have open

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Then I hope they'll cover for this one should it go sour...

--- 帖子 #325 ---
one of them is a short eur gbp, so im guessing with eur usd going up my eurgbp is not going to have much luck lol

--- 帖子 #326 ---
One pattern I have seen occurring over and over is when price doesn’t bounce off an important line like this firebrick midpoint of last week… it almost always breaks through it especially when it hangs around it for so long… So EU going higher is more likely now… I sure hope not... we'll see

--- 帖子 #327 ---
yea, im fearing this too, as i see small up pressure, and buyers pulling out on smaller timeframes Oh well, we shall move on too the next one if be the case

--- 帖子 #328 ---
This is my answer to that little comment: Of the trades I took in the last couple of trading days (mostly yesterday): gbpnzd stopped out: made 111 pips eurnzd: +168 pips floating gbpaud: +85 pips floating gbpjpy: +41 pips floating. and I am moving on. Cheers and All The Best Il Brigante

eur-jpy.... usd-jpy... d1-h1.... waiting retracment for buy

--- 帖子 #330 ---
i see it, what levels you looking at, maybe 50 fib retrace level??

--- 帖子 #331 ---
ok i have a huge question this is confusing me see chart below, as u can see in the red bit i highlighted we can see a buy signal, so i took this according to rules from the retrace on 1 hour, BUT now marked in green we have a sell signal? what do i do now? keep my long, or look for a short now? http://i51.tinypic.com/2yv76g2.jpg

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Can you please post your hourly chart and show entry as I can't see clearly on my charts where there would have been an entry yesterday to go long. Great questions by the way I would be looking for a short but what do i know!

--- 帖子 #333 ---
yes, i marked 2 possible entries for long in the 2 red circled areas, first was a rejection off a fib level, second was a bullish overpowering on the 50 fib level which is where i bought http://i54.tinypic.com/2d7hctc.jpg

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Thanks Bear in mind this is analysed in hindsight which is always easier! Well I would not have considered entering on the first possible entry as that bar did not finish bullish enough. The second bar though strongly bullish in itself does not give a clear indication of direction (too many bars with longish upper tails indicating a reluctance to go up and the close of the bullish bar did not close above the open of previous down bar thus, to me, indicating lack of strength). Lets see what Chantal has to say.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
good morning deankenny.... yes 61 or 50 fib I'll put the chart

--- 帖子 #336 ---
deankenny aus-cad ... there are divergence in d1 entry is not without risk because I see it starts to fall .... so better learn how to select

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Well it is not only a matter of following PPs blindly. In post 141 &amp; 250 I have explained the importance of higher tfs. It is not something to take lightly. Looking at AUDCAD, this pair just got to a high it hasn’t seen since 2004 (orange highlighted zone). That is very significant… However its bullishness above parity is also very obvious. So what I would have done if I wanted to be bullish on this pair, I would have waited for the MN pivot low (green triangle) to have its retrace on D1 and become active (somewhere in the purple zone) as in giving another PL and take it from there to H1 for instance. Looking at W1 the bold bearish engulfing candle made three weeks ago is showing its intentions very clearly off 1.05. So would I take that on for a sell (Pink Triangle) if I could, yes why not if it fits and until/if I get the buy off MN/D1… The daily TF is dictated by the higher ones. For the best part of this 2nd QTR the pair has been stuck in a range, so what do I do? I leave it alone until I get clear signals or a good opportunity. Chantal

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Rest of it

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Excellent IB, I am so glad!

--- 帖子 #340 ---
hi Chantalb that sort of thing I look at them too ... support and resistance in MN or W1 but my platform only has data from the aus-cad 2005, for example? I can not see the resistance of 2004 old data can be loaded?

--- 帖子 #341 ---
It should be, ask your software provider... if not go with another...

--- 帖子 #342 ---
thanks friend... I will do

--- 帖子 #343 ---
There is a lot going on here… 8 GMT candle found resistance at the double top in orange. Opened right on the weekly balance point. Closed below today’s BP and which also is the weekly midpoint (one pip difference)…. Price normally likes to go with the line of least resistance, as I see it, up move is heavily guarded. So this might just be what I am looking for to enter another short… depends on how this hour closes…

--- 帖子 #344 ---
I made some notes on the EU chart for myself yesterday and whilst i don't trade in exactly the same way as yourself, it's encouraging to see that my analysis results in similar entries. Thanks as always for your EU analysis, it's the only pair i trade

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Took the short @ 1.42666 SL 1.44406 + 10 Reasons: for all of the stated earlier and also the confirmation candle closed below 50% June 22 high - June 27 low Now I leave it be... Hope this helps

IB: I would have preferred to give you a white flower, but here is a white chart instead

--- 帖子 #353 ---
ok i got my fibs up am i right in saying a 50 fib retracement of this would be around 80.55

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Yes this is exactly what I am asking... I have plotted all possible assumptions you could have taken, and still can't figure out why you bought where you did...

--- 帖子 #355 ---
am following their rules ... perhaps a little hasty about the retracment ... is something I must improve gbp-nzd--------gbp-cad ------------- ----------- -------- d1-h1 buy

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Those are much clearer, thank you

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Well I would have preferred a flower as well, but in this case the chart will do.. At the moment I cannot see any interesting "setups", and I am only managing my existing trades between Sonny Rollins CD a french slow pace movie with subtitles. Eurnzd is doing pretty well, I have locked in 125 pips, I am trailing my SL 5 pips below the latest swing low on the 1 hour time frame. I am out and made around 150 pips between gbpaud, gbpnzd and gbpjpy. I am monitoring gbpusd long and chfjpy short. Why? huuumhm, that is a long story. But if I enter the trades I will let you know the reasons if you wish to know. Cheers IB

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Nice to have you back, IB

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Now comes the hard part for me ... not whether to go with 2 lots ..... 1 set 1:1 ratio ... and 2 let it go TSL...? And put the SL .... maybe after the 61.8% fibo... in the 100%...? well time will tell

--- 帖子 #360 ---
hi chantalb maybe you can put a graphic example d its TSL... need not be now ... when you have time thanks

--- 帖子 #361 ---
VERY IMPORTANT POS OF CHANTALB.... ---------------------------------------------------------------- I think you did not wait for the close of that confirmation candle before entering the trade, because if you had you would have seen it to be a weak bearish one. Also the supposed to be PP candle was a very strong bullish one, I don’t see any rejection of the 38.2 fib… Guys in order of importance and strength: 61.8% followed by 50% and lastly the 38.2% I don’t even look at 23.6%! Chantal

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Following your request. IB

--- 帖子 #363 ---
ufff wonderful

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Great response , IB glad you're back. Could you show price &amp; date on your charts. Tough for an Old man to follow without them. thanks gmcc

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Someone is only old in is mind, and you do not seem old to me. Now nzdchf long, in @0.6760, SL 0.6672, R88. (this pair has a huge spread, at least 6 pips, also I think I am a bit late, I should have been in the trade at least @ 0.6744) Reasons: Price bounced from 161.8 of bc and crossed back above 127 of ab breaking the DTL. Confluence of Fibo is not to be underestimate. Also look at the pattern that formed at reversal on the 1H TF. And look at what happening at the 4H and D. TF. Will this work? Probably not. But what I know for sure is that I have a good feel that the market has turned and I am in line with the big guys. Will that be enough? NO, it won't be, because if one of the big guys get an order to sell nzd I will be at lost, does not matter what my analysis is. I believe the best way to make money in this business (if you real reason is here to make money....) is to get in sync with the market and place your orders in the path of the flow. Does experience count? I do not think so. I can see too many "traders" going from blog to blog through the years trying to find a system that will change their way. They will not find it, because is too close to them and they are looking far away. I also noticed that they like to hear fairytales and If you try to open the eyes they get offended because their egos is at risk. There are not fairytales in trading, you are against the very sharp and nasty people around the world. You need to keep this in mind and your ego at bay. I only hope that I have not bored you with my nonsense. All The Best Il Brigante

Hey Porfirio If I'm understanding correctly you &amp; I both are looking for a Buy of AudU near 1.0500. I took the EU yesterday for a short and it is kicking my butt. Not sure if I should have taken a smaller lose when it showed such strong bullish nature. To anyone, If my assumptions are not correct please let me know. gmcc

--- 帖子 #370 ---
I do not understand English very well .. but I think you owe an apology to IB Regarding your question, I can not help .... because I analyze the currency pair (eur-usd- w1-h4) a week ago .. and took 180 pips in a short I'm hoping to break the triangle ... I'm outside

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Yeah it wasn't very bright of either of us to take EU for a short with the bold engulfing monday candle... My stop hasn't hit so far... we'll see AU looks good near 1.05, if we get it

--- 帖子 #372 ---
with respect to aus-usd ... the fibo tomorrow will expand ... and we'll see

--- 帖子 #373 ---
nzdchf: moved my SL 0.6730. Now I am only risking 30 pips. The best entry would have been just above the reversal bar indicated at the red harrow. But I do not know how. Any suggestions; Chantalb, Minka, Gmcc, Porfirio or anybody else?

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Sometimes the big guys if they want go long a position they will try to get it at a better price, they will sell first showing a kind of reversal , so they can trap as many as the can and then they buy, and I think this what has happened with eurusd. IB

--- 帖子 #375 ---
I will have a stab at it though it is not a pair I follow I don't see how you can enter where you want to using Chantal's method but there is a double bottom and a big bullish engulfing bar and area of support on the hourly chart

--- 帖子 #376 ---
could explain why did you get today in nzd-fco? following the rules would not be until tomorrow that we have the green light to do TIME BEFORE you enter .. HOW? WHY? ... approach would be interesting to see thanks IB

Hi guys, what you think about GU ? 1.6000 level, strong resistance, low daily PP (double bottom pins - 2nd not so clear) and 1H retracement engulfing candle forming, will see how it finish. Want to know your thoughts on this one. Cheers,

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Porfirio If your comment about owing IB and appology was for me, then I believe you mis-understood our exchange. I by No means meant any disrespect &amp; I feel IB understands that well. I am sorry to take up space with this type of non relevant info. regards gmcc

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Is all in the 365 post. As I said I trade differently, Chantalb's system is a fantastic system and most importantly works for her and make sense to her. That why she is a winner. She has worked hard and has created a system and she is making money. Not only that but she is also so generous to offer her system to others. Myself I have learned a lot from her and fused in my own way. She ask me to show my trades because she is clever and I happy to do so, also because I like the group. Do not be carried by that trade(nzdchf) it can be only luck. IB

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Yes here you'll see two diff ways that I use. First is the previous Low to which you can add a buffer for instance of 10 pips if you like. The second is a 3 day Low TSL. EDIT: Sorry forgot to add where it would have taken us out in chart2... at the top, hope everyone can see it... if not I'll post another chart

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Here is another clearer shot of the second chart above with additions

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Do you mean as in crosses and or bounces? If so not really on H1 but on higher TFs those can be quite significant

I have enough on my plate as it is (17 open positions)... Plus we are at the end of the month, I don't trade much then. Looking at it, the retrace was shallow and PA not very encouraging after the PP... it would have been anyway a no trade for me since I don’t trade before Europe is there

hi IB I don´t took it because the only retracment was 23% tonight will expand the fibo and enters from tomorrow

I see. IB

--- 帖子 #391 ---
I see what you mean, also happened to with audcad retraced only to 23.6 and then it just went so strong. Sometime when it gets only to 23.6 that means that is very strong. Maybe we should do something about. What do you all think? IB

--- 帖子 #392 ---
It would be very nice if we could have an indicator that shows the 3 candle highs and lows. I am working on the image to post later once done...

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Yes I agree, but that also can take us much deeper into other levels

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Try this Chantal.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
It's true. I would like also to suggest this pattern that works for me very well at a turning point, and I think I have mentioned before. I call it the "Brigante Reversal". I think the reason it works is this: you have two bearish candles and then you have a reversal candle that cover the all previous candle body. What means is that you have many players trap on the other side that they also want to get out once they realise they are wrong pushing the trade in your direction. Does it work all the time. NO. But it gives an edge, you will have less entries but good ones. Anyway just a thought. BRIGANTE REVERSAL (BRL and BRH) Brigante Reversals are well explained with candlestick charts. A Brigante Reversal Low (BRL) is explained with three candles pattern, a new low, a lower low and a higher high of CLOSE. But in many cases it is formed in 5-6 candles, but the internal candles should be mostrly inside-candles suggesting indecision. A Brignate Reversal is ONLY valid if it bounces from a key support/resistance level. IB

--- 帖子 #396 ---
[quote=il brigante;4735988]It's true. I would like also to suggest this pattern that works for me very well at a turning point, and I think I have mentioned before. I call it the "Brigante Reversal". And so if you have that pattern at 23.6, maybe we can take the trade? IB

Hey thanks, dots are 3 candle PPs and arrows are entries?

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Yes, I also think that was a good indication. IB

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Hi Chantal, you're right, dots are PP (3 candle formation), when you enable arrows in indy's properties - it shows you next entry candle, but according your rules you need to draw fibo and look for entries on 1H chart to have PP there. Also that indy is coded w/ specific conditions regarding PP (3 candle formation) - more details about formations you can find here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=251378 Cheers,

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Why not also consider the break of the 0 +(long) or -(short) a few pips? I came so close to getting stopped on EU... I can honestly say I am sweating here! I should find a way for a smaller stop that would also give the trade some room. Any suggestions guys?

Hey IB, would you be kind enough to show us some zoomed in charts of what you mean... Thank you

Sure. Look at the arrows. IB

Once is formed place a buy/sell stop order 5 pips above/below the high/low of last candle. If triggered you are in. IB

Chantal B This is the pattern that you used to get in eurusd if I am not mistaken. Previous to your entry you had a BRL indicating long. IB

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Hmmm I understand it better now, thank you... IB in the previous chart is the third arrow on the chart correct? I see it pointing to the red candle... In your BRs do you take into consideration wicks or just bodies? For instance looking at the 1hr (12gmt) candle made on EU (when the Greek vote took place), does it qualify per your setup? What about EU monday engulfing candle on Daily? Thanks

On the daily chart is the monthly PP and on the 4hr is the weekly PP. I have two ways of entering here; I would ideally like to see a retrace and then enter as per method. However, there is a twin pattern on the weekly, and that usually unfolds very quickly. So alternatively what we might see is a close and drop below the magenta trend line where I would like to see price go back up and retest the break =&gt; lower retrace 5th chart… I will not chase price for an entry… Let’s see how this plays out…

Hey there IB, NZDUSD as of tonight 0 GMT I should be getting a Pivot high, so I guess I won’t be sleeping much since I expect the move in the Asian session. It could be a very quick move from the daily open with no retrace. So I will do one of two things: 1- Retrace and entry as per method 1hr chart. 2- No retrace and based on the break of the aqua TL with a 4hr close below it. I will enter the trade on the open of the 4hr candle opening below aqua. All this is of course on condition that we get a confirmed fractal where the TL is anchored. By confirmed I want to see two candles closing AFTER the fractal with higher lows. As far as AUDUSD goes I have a different view... Please see charts below and let me know what you think Cheers

Hi Chantalb Just got up, drinking my tea, coffee is not good for trading. I think your analysis on audusd is perfect. What I am not sure about is the timing. Sentiment in forex is everything, they shift day bay day. If and once the prices reaches the "orange zone" for a possible buy you also need to get in sync with the market, do not rely only on "set ups". Yes they help, but they are not important as "feel the market". Now, if prices get to the "orange zone" I would have made already and secure my profit and if they do not bounce the better. Reason for my short entry: On the 4 HTF prices bounce from a DTL and from 61.8 AB (that is good, confluences) On the 1 HTF prices broke a TD UTL and then pull back toward it forming an bearish engulfing pattern and a protective stop above that TD UTL is placed to protect my "culo" (I do not know how to say that in German). Now finally and most important is that previous to my entry there was a lower number on the home loans release and my feel for the market was that the big guys would sell some aud and there were signs that usd was gaining a bit of strength. Will I be right? Probably not, is not easy the get a feel of the market, that why I do not drink coffee, but is the only way I know. I hope it helps. Your friend, IL BRIGANTE.

Very nice and refreshing analysis IB thank you.... NZDUSD broke down prematurely and took out my 4hr fractal anchor ... oh well, I'll wait for a retrace. All this spells "bed time"... Good night guys PS: I will take that Tea tip and work it

--- 帖子 #444 ---
You were absolutely right on nzdusd, maybe 4 hour is too large for entry, one hour is better, sometime you need to scale down to 15 or even 5 minutes TF. What is important is were you place your stop loss, you need to place were is difficult to get back there, that is why confluences are important. See attached pic on the 30 TF. Also remember that is easier to be a professor after the facts. IB

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Here is what I see as potential entries for this week. And Profirio and IB were right on when they said that if price only retraces to 23% then the move is a very strong one. So with all that heat Europe is taking the below chart is what we may have. What do you guys think?

--- 帖子 #446 ---
hmmm you are very right... In the past I got my neck handed to me very often on lower TFs (below 30m), this is why I try to stick to higher ones. But I am all eyes with your suggestions. I think you are gonna have a fit when you see where I intend to have my stop on EU

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Yes you are right, but we need to consider the sentiment of the market when the pull back occurs. Now, on eurusd the was money to be made, but often we get prisoner of our own conviction, that is me included. It was screaming and telling me there were free money. The daily chart was showing an important break of the daily UTL, sentiment was huge, those bloody Italians messed it up once again, everybody was selling. On the 1h TF is clear were we should have entered and were we should have protected our "culo" but I did not because I was not in sync and because my "set up" was not showing there. IB

Chantalb, I just finished reading your thread and must say this is the best one in FF IMO. Thank you for sharing this wonderful system with us and hope to learn and grasp as much as I can. I am not an advanced trader so hope you don't mind if I ask a question here and there. I pretty much understand the basics of how the system works. Now when it comes to drawing trend lines on different TF, seeing the market more clearly, and deciding to wait for a retracement or not is where the practice comes in. There is one thing I didn't understand and is really puzzling me if you don't mind explaining to me, maybe on the chart. On post #438 you stated " on condition that we get a confirmed fractal where the TL is anchored." You kinda lost me there, and not sure what trend line is anchored means. From my understanding of a fractal, there has to be 1-2 candles to the left and right with HL or LH.....so kinda puzzled there Thank you very much in advance. Regards, Fly

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Looks like all the moves are already underway... I found two setups but I am kinda hesitant with all the dollar strength. Waiting on convincing price action. One is W1 USDCAD and the other is W1 &amp; D1 USDCHF. The later show clear hidden divergence on D1, so I would keep a short bias untill a clear break of 0.85000 happens. On the H1 chart of USDCHF, the blue fibs are for a W1 up move and the red are for D1 down move.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Hi Fly, Welcome to the thread and thank you for your kind words. Fractals are said to be confirmed and locked in once the fifth candle closes without the second candle on the right of the fractal taking out the low (in the case of a Pivot Low) or the high (in case of a pivot high) of the fractal. If you look at the chart of NSDUSD, we had a fractal that appeared right where I had put that hypothetical anchor just as the fourth candle closed. But it got taken out on the second candle on the right of the fractal, hence the fractal disappeared. A fractal formation is made up of five candles, two to the left and two to the right of the fractal. So when you want to place a TL you do that on confirmed points of support or resistance i.e. confirmed fractal formations. If you look at a 5min chart for example you will better understand how a fractal that gets formed on the fourth can disappear on the fifth. Hope this helps, Chantal

I am not sure whether I am really seeing this or I am form fitting it. But here goes, please be patient as I am posting 6 charts… They are self explanatory except for the green highlighted area where I think price didn’t go deep enough. Please share your thoughts and I would be very glad to be corrected. The first chart shows what I am looking at. The second shows 1-2 retracement. The third shows 1-2-3 retracement. The fourth shows 3-4 retracement. And finally the fifth &amp; sixth have all of the above…

I took this one at 9GMT, so far so good. This trade was off the W1 pivot high, 4hr view and 30min entry. It’s a good thing I did not wait to take it off the H1 because that 9GMT bullish pin bar would have made me avoid it altogether or maybe got in after the 11GMT bearish engulfing. SL is 60 pips from entry.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
I am not sure about eurusd yet, yes the eur is gaining a bit and the usd is weakening across the board, on the 4 h we have a nice engulfing and BRP formed, but that is the only support I can see. Prices have not got to the weekly UTL and retracement is at 50% only. Maybe if prices get back to test the previous low forming a Double bottom then we can draw a UTL on the 4h TF and a probable bullish divergence. (3 confluences) The best would be that price get to the weekly UTL, then we would have that important support, plus 61.8 and 1.27 fibo level, and a probable bullish divergence with a bullish reversal pattern.(5 confluences) This is what I think. Hey, do not forget the feel for the market. Best is to place our money where the big guys are pushing. IB

With latest news form Japan and the translation of this news on chart as a fast up move ... went long from 79.10 ... as we got on the 1h chart nice setup to go long ... my question is do you think we are on a perfect entry to go long and hold it for few months ... ???

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Well that depends on whether there will be a third round of QE. Two scenarios come into play: 1- Yay : would be bad for the USD because it would require printing more $ and thus making the currency less valuable. So that would be a short on for e.g. USDJPY and a long on EURUSD… 2- Nay: would play out into your long position on UJ i.e. Good for USD… And don’t forget about the upcoming elections in the US, that is also something you should look into to find out whether a strong or weak $ is required. But hey what do I know, in the end they will do what they want. Cheers

EUR/USD D1 Sry I don't know how to draw on these charts or even paste it directly. Took the trade on the retracement of the 61.8 fib. Up around 120+ pips right now. Will let it ride and see if I can TP around the support of the Weekly and look for a PL there. Regards, Fly

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Looks like support on the D1 just turned into resistance and should be looking for a short. I was waiting to see if it would hit at least the 50.0 fib and look for a PH there. Any thoughts? Regards, Fly

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Took a long on 7/15 based on the PL of 7/13 and got stopped 10 pips below PL (-119 pips). Any thoughts if that was just a very bad trade to take or did it just not go my way. Regards, Fly

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Your setups were all nicely based on the concept of this method. However, with all the major fundamentals in play since last week, we all should be very cautious. What comes in here is risk aversion VS risk appetite. In times of risk aversion safe havens are where all the money goes to. So for example Fly, avoid selling CHF cause this is where people tend to run to. I will not take any trades as long as this whole mess isn't dealt with. Trade safely, CB

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Thanks for your imput CB, may I ask where I can find out about all the major fundamentals? Maybe a certain site or tv? Regards, Fly

--- 帖子 #482 ---
CB, thanks for the system. I am trying it out. My thought was a red bar, a red bar with nice rejection, a green bar with confirmation, therefore setup a limit buy just above the close of the confirmation candle. Comments are welcome. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #483 ---
price came 20 pips to my TP and came all the way back to stop out my trade. I actually liked it, I didn't have time to close half when it was 50+. But I didn't let a winner become a loser and protect my asset. Let's find another one.

Hi Porfirio, I do think it was good entry, however, because of my MM strategy, I like to protect my assets by moving SL to BE after 50 pips or so. That in this case, unfortunately there was a big red bar in the morning that stopped me out. Now it almost reach my TP1. That happens and I am still glad about the trade knowing how it progressed.

Thanks Porfirio for posting all your charts I have had a few ups and downs since July 11 including a fire in my house so have not done any trading. Having now moved back into my home I am slowly getting organized and hope to start looking at charts,trading and posting again very soon. Its a shame the thread is so quiet as I think this a great strategy Chantalb

I have been mostly on the sidelines since my last post. Had a go at one setup on GU but took a 44 pip loss that I closed manually. Porfirio, it’s really nice of you to keep this thread going. I am glad you guys like what I have presented here. During this time that I was away, I took advantage to use it for some testing and studying J … I will soon share with you my findings, and we can decide whether we can add them to our toolbox or not. In the meantime what I’d like for you guys to try out are mid-fib levels along with the regular ones, i.e. 0- 11.8 -23.6- 30.9 -38.2- 44.1 -50- 55.9 -61.8- 69.1 -76.4- 88.2 -100. The bolds are the mids and the underlined is a cluster of big importance imo. Try them out on your charts and let me know what you think. Cheers, CB

Hi Fly, You have the calendar here on FF along with important news announcements, plus you can always tune into CNBC or Bloomberg for live feeds. Hope this helps, CB

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Hi Leelar, I like the trade you took. The top/bottom of the confirmation candle is usually where I add a position at the breakout of that top/bottom. My trade size would be significantly lower then because of the added risk. MM is something that should not be taken lightly. You have to decide what is optimal for you. Capital is your hard earned money on the line and you should protect it at all times. Once in a good trade taking some profits off the table isn’t a bad thing. I use different combinations of MM… the 3 day hi/low is one of them. I also use a 1/2 - 1/3 – 2/3 approach once let’s say we cover a certain percentage of ADR.

Could you post the smaller TF charts of the above where you took your entries and the reasoning behind those too please? Thanks

--- 帖子 #510 ---
EUR/USD Hey CB, Well I did take this trade at a very awkward time which you'll see on the chart, but I didn't want to miss it. Actually if I waited for Sun. night, I would have gotten in better. BTW my 7/29 candle is combined with 7/31 (Fri. &amp; Sun.) A PH formed on 7/27 with a confirmation candle on 7/28 closing with a LL. So on the 7/29 candle, I looked for a PH on the 30M chart and took the trade at the opening of the 6:00 candle. Hope this helps and feel free to comment. Regards, Fly

--- 帖子 #511 ---
USD/CAD Hey CB, As for this trade, please disregard where I entered as I just realized I was testing the CCI indicator and got lucky. As per your system, I would have entered this trade anyway but on the 7/28 candle instead looking for a PL on the 30M, and would have taken a 2nd trade based on the 1H fib if I was around the comp. Regards, Fly

Excellent trades on the system porfirio, I was in with you on 2 of them. In my opinion, I think GBP/USA and GBP/JPY might be too volatile for this system. Also, another big question is how we should take profit....we are getting a hang of entries, but how should we calculate take profits? Maybe ChantalB can help us a little on that.... Regards, Fly

--- 帖子 #521 ---
profit-taking is perhaps more complicated ... chantalb to speaks TSL day to day ... but the answer you when read the post I prefer to close half position when I reached at least a 1:1 ratio, and I moved the SL to break even,and let it run half position .... tomorrow, Friday, move the SL even though I have no clear exit

out? When you see the opposite configuration (price pivots) ... but uses the TSL to protect when you do it 100 times will be easy if you're wrong, no matter at hand will give you the opportunity to study because of the failure I hope you understand the relationship of the candles and the d1 y h1 (or m30) ... is important in h4 y m15 (or m5) is exactly the same

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Yes, I get the piece about entering on a retrace on the 1hr once the fractal has appeared on the d1. What I'm still not clear on is when a d1 fractal is "valid", and when it isn't. The original post stated they must be at "Price Pivots" e.g 1.1000, 1.1500 etc, yet later charts don't seem to have these areas marked, or there is no reference to them. Also, the concept of trading with the trend was introduced (using 200 MA as guide I think), but then later it seems that any / all fractals are valid. So from what I've seen on the charts, it's easy to look at a fractal before a large move and see how it would have been easily tradable and profitable, but not so easy to see how a bunch of opposing fractals in a ranging market would have been traded e.g. USDCAD in Jan / Feb - which I guess is always the problem with any system though!!

--- 帖子 #534 ---
So in this previous example you had entered the USDCAD long around the 28th July, which was doing very well. But prior to this, in the white circle on my chart there were 2 previous d1 fractals, one long then one short, but I see no reference to these in any postings. Both look like they would have been stopped out, and I would say that the short would have been the preferable direction at that point anyway, as the prevailing trend was down (and was at the 0.95000 PP)? Did you take either of these trades?

--- 帖子 #535 ---
CHANTALB when he returns to explain the topic of fractals ... I do not utlized just watch if the price is overbought or oversold CCI lines 14 and TMA I will certainly CHANTALB and will respond .. he is the creator of the strategy ... I use them all the strategies in my own way

--- 帖子 #536 ---
if usd-cad take a few days ago ...

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Yes that would have been a nice trade. So seems you are looking for reversals of trend, rather than going with the trend, very interesting to know - thanks for the help in understanding!

--- 帖子 #538 ---
sorry .. "yes" meant, not "if" regard to tenure ... a trend change takes place in lower TF ... you look at the example above usd-cad ... d1 ema is below 100 in a bearish channel ... but by gum and h1 is a bullish channel and above the 100 ema therefore I said before is very important that the relation d1-h1 although it is not necessary for me to use EMA's .... zoom the screen and I sense it will make ... therefore I said that practiced over and over again

--- 帖子 #539 ---
As mentioned earlier in the thread the RSI I use is nothing other than a regular 14 period with colored rectangles and lines. You can add them yourself... were I to attach the indicator you would get nothing other than the one you already have in MT4... Hope this helps,

I have been busy making up for all the lost time waiting on the sidelines during July. So trading was a priority for me over the thread since the beginning of August. I will make more time for this thread in the coming days and answer all queries. Porfirio, I am amazed at the speed you picked up this strategy and how you made it fit into your style… Bravo! This is the thing… trading is a personal style full stop. Now what I have attempted so far here was to introduce readers to a strategy that is very profitable and simple. Porfirio (sorry for taking you as an example) is living proof, and I hope you can one day all prosper as traders. The learning curve to becoming a trader is a very long one and that of trading is endless and ever changing. There is no such thing as a one stop shop in trading where you can get all you need and then hit the millionaires list. It is a personal process, and a very very lengthy one… In my next posts I will go deeper into one last topic PRICE and that will be the climax of what I have to share. I have given a lot of clues on the tools I use in trading throughout the thread. It is up to you to pick them up or not. CB

Price pivots do not necessarily have to be located in the vicinity of 1000 or 500 numbers, however when they are and once we see a clear rejection off of these numbers our odds of having a successful trade are increased. Big numbers like that typically give two scenarios, the first is a rejection and the second is a breakdown/breakout. Price will normally always go back and test the big number after it breaks it as in the second scenario. What I tend to do is wait until I get that retest with a structured PP. Not all PP are made equal and this is where you have to assess it and decide if it is a valid one or not… Now suppose I get a pivot high off a round number and then the confirmation candle is a bullish one would I take that?... of course not… simply because a pivot high requires bearish PA and a pivot low a bullish PA. So what I like to see in the case of a pivot high for instance is weakness on the PP candle followed by more weakness on the confirmation candle and vice versa for a pivot low. Waiting for the trigger on the retracements in shorter tfs is there for a reason, price action there will always tell you if it wants to go through with the move or not. I had explained the 200 MA issue to IB in previous posts, please look them up. The MA is there so that I am extra cautious when taking a countertrend trade… that’s all… you can choose to not trade short when let’s say price is above it, it is up to you. Concerning UC in Jan/Feb, parity is the mother of big numbers I try to avoid all trades around parity. There are so many pairs out there, don’t get stuck to one, it can break you. One last thing, when price is above a major S &amp; R line ( that can also be a big number area like in the chart) wait for price to come back to the line and buy, assume it will hold cause it generally does. Same goes for once below it. The chart shows the yellow areas up from par, red is the break and magenta are the retests down… Cheers, CB

--- 帖子 #543 ---
The pivot low on the 21st of July was followed by a bull candle that engulfed it. However if you look closer at the wick of that candle on the 22nd it was strongly rejected. Pivot high on 22 was followed by a bullish confirmation candle, to me that is a no trade especially that it was also a Sunday bar. Shorting a currency at an area of demand is very dangerous, please refer to chart below. By the way I suggest you get other time zone charts along with the one of your broker. I have GMT and NY charts that I refer to daily and upon which I make my decisions. Supply and demand is what I will cover next. Hope this helps, CB

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Great Job my friend, I think I will be the one to learn from you one of these days

--- 帖子 #545 ---
What fractals do is show me areas of supply (resistance) and demand (support). The higher the time frame the stronger the zones. On the charts, magenta is for W1, blue is for tested daily zones, green is for untested D1 zones, orange is D1 breached supply, and grey are 4hr demand zones… On the 1h lime, turquoise and turquoise/bluish green are for hourly S&amp;D. Yellow circles on the second chart represent tested supply and lime circles tested demand… There are many more zones that can be added, for the sake of not cluttering the chart up further I will stick to these. Knowing where supply and demand zones lie makes all the difference to the outcome of one’s trades. I don’t take a pivot low (aka long position) into supply or a pivot high (aka short) into demand, I wait for price to either clear the zone and give me a pivot low above supply or to get rejected from the zone with bearish PA in this example. On this I wish you a good weekend, and please take the time to research further topics such as candle structures (individual and group), price in linear form, supply and demand, trend lines, channels (and their mids), price pivots etc… CB

On the daily we have confluence of a 500 number, 50% fib (w1 PP) and a demand turned supply with a potential pivot high. Waiting on the close to see some more bearishness. The 4h shows my view more clearly… Let’s see if it will fall… Edit: Almost 3 hours later, not too pleased with the PA, was waiting for a strong dip on smaller tfs... will skip... plus looking at the bounce on the weekly doesnt look good for a down move... charts to follow

Chantalb, thank you for making a clear thread where we can discuss price pivots. I've been applying the scaled down version of your method on the USD/CHF. Here is how my chart looks: I set grid lines every 62 pips and wait to see how the general trend is going for the day. I use the D1 TF to give me a sense of what I should be looking for. Yesterday confirmed a down pivot, so I waited for a down pivot on the H1/M30 chart to form and jumped in. I set a SL at the high of the last pivot and let it ride until I get a reverse pivot. I close out the trade and wait for a new pivot in the general direction. If the trend is strong I will double up to squeeze out a few more pips. (On the Up pivot at 0.81220 I went down to the M15 and saw a down pivot form, I was able to pull 70 pips from the move.)

I had an interesting Price Pivot pattern show up last night during my trading. The same bar formed both a Pivot Up and and Pivot Down. What do you guys make of such a pattern and how would you interpret / trade it? (I'll try to post a chart later)

--- 帖子 #559 ---
August is about the worst month to trade. I've had a rough one... my largest and main account is down by app 7%... Yeah well, I'll tend to my wounds and move on. @Porfirio... glad you still contributing, my best wishes out to you. @Bongabonga... When a pattern like that appears I usually skip it cause price tends to stay stuck in the range of that candle for a while without a clear direction. It also implies most of the time a continuation of the previous trend. Good weekend, CB

Thank you for the indicator/temp. You are very kind. So if I understand this you trade chantalb system in conjuction with the TMA, taking D1 price pivots on the top of the channel for short and in the bottom for longs. Do you ever take entries without any PPs? Do you take entries if price is somewhere in the middle of TMA? This is a very good filter because I have noticed with TMA some losing trades can be avoided if we stick to the top/bottom of TMA. How does the CCI affect your decision making? Sorry for all the questions, I am only trying to figure things out. Please state any rules that you follow. Thank you for your patience, and your english is perfect Lili

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Chantalb I have been reading this thread over and over. I really want to thank you for sharing your knowledge. I hope you don't mind that I have asked Porfirio for his indicators and how he trades this system.

One of my trades on AUDCAD is close to your entry. Last month I got stopped often on many trades because I was getting caught in the whipsaw just before price went in my initial direction. So this time around I decided to place my stops not at the high of the PP + 10 but above the main supply zone +10. In the case of AUDCAD the D1 supply is between 1.05553 &amp; 1.05072 ===&gt; SL=1.05655 Had I placed it at the high of the pp (September 2nd) +10 I would have been stopped out today. If I only had done the same for GU and EU trades (August 19th)!!! The learning is continuous in this business Hope you are still in the trade, CB Edit: here is a chart for better understanding

What I am seeing on this chart is an ending diagonal. An ending diagonal or also known as compression very often ends in six moves. Let's see if price has moved high enough to find the supply needed to trigger this fall.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Hi, Chantalb. Just found your thread and it's very interesting. I followed nomask's thread for a while and I liked the concept a lot. I like this even more, thank you for sharing your knowledge! I haven't read the whole thread yet but I'm going to give this a try. Charts of EURJPY daily and hourly. The daily looks like it's forming a price pivot, per your description. So I put my fib on and dropped to H1. We're still in the confirmation candle. When the new candle begins at midnight we're looking for a fractal low/price pivot, then enter on the next candle, SL at previous low fractal. Have I got it?

--- 帖子 #581 ---
How did you define the supply zone?

--- 帖子 #582 ---
I know what you mean. I sometimes use a time stop i.e. a move that is based on a certain price structure shouldn't take too long to get under way. For instance AUDCAD even though it is right in the heart of D1 supply/over priced it is not moving as we would want it to. Supply and demand looks to be in balance for the moment on the daily. Sooner or later this equation will break; I am more biased to the down side. But nobody knows, right?... Anything can happen.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Perfectly The only thing I’d suggest is to have mid fib levels as well, since Fib is nothing more than a measuring tool, why not complete the missing levels . You can chose from two sets depending on whether you prefer to use 76.4 or 78.6 levels. The bolds in the first are the mid fibs and the underlined are very important to me. I actually just longed EJ off of 89.3 0- 11.8 -23.6- 30.9 -38.2- 44.1 -50- 55.9 -61.8- 69.1 -76.4- 88.2 -100 0-11.8-23.6-30.9-38.2-44.1-50-55.9-61.8-70.2-78.6-89.3-100

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Supply or demand zones are simply areas where price has fallen out of balance. It is an area where you have more sellers than buyers for supply and vice versa for demand. In the charts I have color coded the zones. In the H1 chart the latest supply zone from yesterday should normally take us back down. We are right back into this zone, however if for some reason price shoots out of the zone then this zone becomes inverted supply è New Demand. Hope this helps, CB

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Oh, I understand what you mean now. Instead of a Support / Resistance line you made it into a variable sized zone based around those lines. Thanks for the thorough explanation! I'm still getting my sea legs so to speak but I hope to contribute my own charts to this thread soon.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Cool! Thanks for the fib levels, too. I'm not sure I want to enter yet, as it still has a little bearish momentum. I'll try to watch it though -I'm at work which makes it hard!

Hello Chantalb and everyone. I've been reading through all pages and I really like the trading system as it looks very simple and easy to plan the trade. I would like to master this system and want to be a profitable trader. I have a question. To qualify the price pivot high/low, does the third candle needs to close above (Price Pivot Low) /below (Price Pivot High) the low of the second candle (middle of the candles.)? I would like to join this thread and hope to learn together. Thank you. Chublet

--- 帖子 #591 ---
You are welcome to join us here. It is very simple, for a pivot high we are looking for a bearish price configuration and for a pivot low a bullish configuration. The stronger that configuration the better i.e. let's say you have a pivot high and the confirmation candle is a bullish one we ignore that setup because we are looking for confirmed weakness. However if the range of the confirmation candle is very wide I also ignore it because price tends to rotate back to the mean of that range b4 continuing if it does. Hope this helps, CB

--- 帖子 #592 ---
EURAUD bounces off daily demand and also RN (round #) 1.30000 also giving us a pivot low. Blue area is the latest d1 demand zone and green is that just before it but they both overlap (this is the gold zone in between green and blue). This is not a prime setup because we have very strong supply level ahead (in Tomato)... So if I do take this trade, tomato area will be tp1 then RN (1.35000) tp2... We'll see.... It looks like it is setting up strongly in zone 3 which is not exactly the zone of my preference...

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Because this is my least favorite zone to enter (as in zone 3) I will wait for a retest of the red TL and enter around there if I see bullish configuration and strength

--- 帖子 #594 ---
What do you mean by zone 3? I assume you are referencing the quadrants formed by the two intersecting trendlines, but what is that tool officially called (the zones)? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #595 ---
I did not get the bounce I was waiting for. Price just broke through the blue TL. However we are at an area where I expect price to rotate back lower. Three possibilities come in for me, the first is price going back to retest the red TL, second go much lower and give a good retrace and third if demand is very strong it might just blast through the white rectangle after testing the breakout of the blue TL.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Zone 3 refers to post 592 second chart where I have highlighted three entry zones by preference from 1 to 3 where 3 is my least favorite. It has nothing to do with the area of intersecting TLs, it is simply an area of H1 demand. If it is not clear please say so and I will attempt another explanation. Thanks, CB

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Perfect explanation, CHANTALB E-C ... EXIT in a few days, maybe tomorrow ... start forming a triangle against

--- 帖子 #598 ---
I am also looking at EURCAD it is setting up nicely. I am also looking at EURGBP, EURNZD &amp; USDCAD. However here I would like to point out that EN does not look like a prime setup and needs to go a little lower to meet stronger D1 demand. It could be a very quick move i.e. spikes the area and jump, we’ll see. USDCAD is a tricky one, we bounced off parity for a potential down move BUT we are at monthly demand. Looks like supply on D1 but I will pass unless I get a very convincing counter trend setup or a long setup with the monthly view… In the chart EURAUD (5m) bounces lower from the white rectangle area drawn earlier… let’s see what happens. Cheers, CB

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Sorry, it's been a long night for me. I thought you had made up some new trendline interpretation.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Hey no prob

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Platform froze as I was putting in my order, hence got in much higher. Ideally I would have liked to enter somewhere in the blue zone… If price should go even lower (as in the previous zones I have defined) I will add if I get the chance and like PA

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Price has just hit H1 demand. In the charts (D1/4H) blue rectangles are daily levels (above price supply and below it demand), pink 4h and white 1h (Demand in this case for both). Ideally I would like to see price come down to the bold black TL where we also have daily demand sitting there. So watching for a bullish reaction to start winding down my trades. CB NB: EJ was closed for -230 pips and app -1.5%

--- 帖子 #603 ---
It looks like the USDX has some unfinished business before going back up. It had no reaction whatsoever to the big highlighted supply zone which means now it will act as demand... So with this I'm expecting some much lower EU after its retrace is over AND I'm not touching it before we know where we stand fundamentally. Cheers, CB

--- 帖子 #604 ---
I'm following this with great interest. Did you close this trade at 1.3300? Looks like it's right at the bottom of your "tomato" zone in the pic. Looking to the left I can see why - price loves that 1.3300 zone.

--- 帖子 #605 ---
A-F y EU-GBP.... D1-M30

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Unfortunately I was asleep when we hit that area and my stop was at BE+, so got taken out overnight. I’m just very wary of euro crosses these days and am treading very carefully around them. Have you traded this yet? Post some charts and we’ll discuss them Cheers, CB

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Good Luck friend Hey watch out for the pink zone (EURGBP) highlighted in the chart below...

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Took a short on USDCAD, the structure came at the third touch of TL and at 50%. Now this is counter the monthly and any announcement could make it sky rocket. The only direct concern I have is the zone below in pink where once price gets there could bounce. Wanted to take the long on EURGBP, but as I said I am not trusting these clowns in Europe. Also the entry I wanted to take was on H1 and we have a very strong 4h supply just ahead in pink. On the 1h this bearish candle engulfed 16 previous ones! Now this means bear business… So no trade on this pair for me just yet. All the best on your trades, CB

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Man, I hate it when that happens! Last night when I posted that chart I figured it would do one of three things, in order of highest probability first: 1) Bounce off TL and continue downtrend 2) Bounce off TL and start ranging between 1.3300 and 1.3200 3) Blow through that range (the "tomato zone") and continue upward I did not trade it because even though I though it would bounce it was still trending and I wasn't comfortable. As you can see it blew right through that consolidation zone, which I thought would be least likely. I don't mind being wrong if I'm not in a trade!

--- 帖子 #610 ---
I'm still watching EJ. And it's decision time. It looks like I should go long here with a target just below 108 (previous support). I don't think I'll pull the trigger though. As you say, I just can't bet with the Euro on a high TF. How do my charts look? Daily formed another pivot (first chart), I put the fib on the signal and confirmation candles, zoomed to H1 (second chart), and saw two bullish formations. Still practicing to make sure I have it right!

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Very good thoughts there If there is one thing I may suggest if you don’t mind, trendlines are much more meaningful drawn off a line chart. Check it out... on the same chart for instance you have in this post draw another off a line chart and compare them. Notice on the 4h where the candle closed... nice ha? Based on the traditional TL you have there you would have been waiting for a reaction/cross when price had in real passed (and closed beyond) the barrier 8 hours earlier... Hope this was helpful... CB

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Yes you are right about decision time and it should spell TIMES…. Many many decisions to be taken soon. The thing with “all time low” is no one really knows we have hit bottom yet, that was exactly what I was thinking when in that trade last week. And what ended up happening was for me taking a much bigger loss that I had to. Now on your trade setup, that is not a setup I would consider. The confirmation candle is bearish and it is an inside bar. Your fib is not set PP to confirmation, but PP Low to PP high. You can do that if you want on let’s say outside bars or engulfing bars if you expect a continuation of a move before getting PP. That is what I tried to do yesterday with EURGBP but did not get a chance as I was away when the setup triggered. Look at daily charts and check out what are the best Price Pivots that could have been traded… as in Bullish PP bullish confirmation, bearish bearish, bearish bullish, bullish bearish… I stick to the first two but let’s say we have a bearish reactive PP and an engulfing bullish confirmation I take that. And those have been the best trades in my career. Look at candle formations too _ very important… By the way real price is open close, that is what is essential… wicks are details. Hope this helps.

Yeah looks tempting, but too late in the day for me especially that Europe is closed and some big spills coming out in a while, more like a coin flip really. But of course Merkel n Sarkozy won't let down their compatriots, so I'd expect a euro rise. I don’t like to trade politics/fundies, never did, tried it and got burned many times. The good thing about those though is they give levels and structures for the future… hope your trades pay off

hello chantalb I only see the market from the technical point of view ... I ignore the fundamental aspects in d1 if we can do pips regardless the current economic climate, when the market normalizes we still do more

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Ok, this took me a while to figure out what you are saying but I think I got it. If I actually have it right, it's a great eye-opener. Please tell me if this is what you meant: Chart #1 - Same chart as this morning w/support trendline Chart #2 - Changed chart from candlesticks to line chart, added the purple dashed trendline Chart #3 - Changed back to candlesticks Chart #4 - Zoomed to H4. Price closes below the line chart TL earlier than the candle chart Bottom line: if I had wanted to play the breakout the line chart was a more reliable signal. This brings back a deep dark memory of something I read in John Murphy's book about 20 years ago: the close is considered the most important number in the bar (of OHLC). I'm sure this is what you are referring to when you say that a trendline is more meaningful when drawn on a line chart. I haven't looked at a line chart for ages! This is great stuff! Thanks for the thoughtful comments!

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Every word you say is great stuff! I get it all and I see everything you mean on that trade. I took it long this morning, moved to BE and got stopped out in a few hours. But I kept my #1 rule: don't lose money. Thanks! Mega pips to all!

--- 帖子 #622 ---

I see, thanks for helping. Whoa, hang on a minute there! I'm maybe good at imitating what I see but so far that's the best I can do. I'm still struggling to make any money at this because I don't make good decisions yet. Then when I do see a good setup, I'm afraid to pull the trigger! I'm getting better though. I saw the EJ trade similar to you and took it on the D1. My target TP is 107.40 (yellow line) around previous support (turn to resistance) and fib 38.2. I'm thinking that's conservative because you could say fib 50, but for me it's pushing my luck too much. I'm interested how do you see it? (This is the part where I hope not to get my bubble burst for missing something obvious!) I'm learning to see these things better.

Sorry for the confusion here is the 4h chart (EURAUD) I was referring to in terms of TLs. The dashed red one is Daily highs etc and the bold red one is based off daily line chart. Now about the other part of your question on fibs. Porfirio has a point that is very valid and it works for him which is amazing. I prefer having some kind of stronger reason to enter, and what I like to see in terms of a perfect pivot structure is the following: 1- Pivot High: High - Lower high-Lower low . 2- Pivot Low: Low - Higher low-Higher high . The bolded high and low are those of the Pivot and the underlined sections are those of the confirmation candle. No I am not saying that you should pull your fib on a lower high of a confirmation candle. Once that is the structure then you have an inside bar, and the best way to trade such a structure is at the break of the high of the inside bar or high of PP, your choice. Here is EURCAD, on one platform this is what it looks like. On others it still has not completed PP but is in stage two i.e. tomorrow is when I get full PP structure, and so far yesterday’s candle is an engulfing bullish bar.

Aha! (need a smiley face for a light bulb). Now I get it! I did not look for the higher high on the confirmation candle. I was only looking at the pattern formed by the lows. That would have automatically solved my fib problem, too. I like this way of looking at the market. It doesn't require staring at my computer for hours and hours every day, and I don't have that much time to spend. Thanks both Chantalb and Portfirio for the explanations! AF

Hey my pleasure, I am so happy that people are benefiting... that was the whole idea. I know how frustrating it can be when one loves trading and can't make it work. So I guess we have a nicely reliable system here I’ve been playing around with your template, it is quite interesting. So let’s see if I get this straight, you wait for a yellow “X” at the extremes of the channels and you then also incorporate a pivot structure all on D1. Then you wait for price to cross the 100ema on lower tfs for entry, did I miss anything? Will work some more on it… method … Cheers Chantal

Of course. Which pairs do you trade the system on? Also how do you deal with moving the SL during the trade please? Do you move to BE after a certain number of pips, and then just wait for a triangle in the opposite direction, or do you trail the stop somehow? I notice you mention something about using TSL on the 4hr - is this how you do it?

hi shandy...you can use any pair I'll give you an example of TSL ... eru-usd---on this occasion did not move the SL, I forgot to move it (no problem is demo) Look at the EUR-USD ... when the price reached the TMA h4 move there sl soil to break even, but not always do .. is something that even I have to study more sometimes you close a potential winner ... sometimes not (a-c or gbp-usd for example) is a personal decision to move or not

Kapybara thanks for asking Chantalb to elaborate. One picture is certainly worth a thousand words! I'm a visual learner, so this is really good for me. I edited your picture a little, Chantalb. I'm still getting used to the PP terminology of 3,5,7, etc. on this method. Is this picture correct? If so, I'm going to start practicing looking for this setup because it's easy to spot. Thanks! AF

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Thanks Porfiro, that is useful. Hopefully you will keep posting your trades so we can learn some more!! I see a couple of trades that went "wrong" in the past couple of days e.g. EURJPY, however I notice it would have had an approximately 90 pip SL, and went approx 150 pips the right way - did you move to BE on this at all, or was this a full loss?

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Guys, how does AUDNZD look to you? Nice pinbar. If today closes higher than 2 days ago open, we draw fib and start looking for retrace and good PP to enter. Is this right? Not sure whether today has to close higher than high or open of 2 days ago. It seems right from looking over some history but I need some guidance on this. Thanks!!!!

--- 帖子 #650 ---
e-j...still in play .... Look at the bottom of the sail of the 12th of September....put the SL there SL did not move .... so I'm still in, friend. --- about a-n ... still too soon to enter, although a potential buy, possibly tomorrow

--- 帖子 #651 ---
Portfirio, this is GY Daily with CCI 14. I don't use it but I saw you are using it. Is this divergence, and is it a possible buy signal?

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Now the Daily candle on AUDNZD closed above the candle 2 days ago, so I think we have a valid PP setup. I put the fib on low of pinbar to high of next (yesterday's) candle, and then zoom to H1. I have marked what I think should be 3 possible entries according to the method. Since I was asleep and missed them I'm going to change it a little. Price bounced off 38.2 fib real nice several times, and the lows are climbing. It also tested the high of the fib several times. Right now it's in no man's land. My plan is to enter at a retrace to the 23.6 or 38.2. If price heads north soon I'll look for a break of 1.2500 by about 8 pips or more with good momentum. Chantalb are you in this trade?

--- 帖子 #653 ---
gbp-jpy... will be a potential buy but it is still soon friend ... wait a few days. I don´t know about Japan but has a terrible power for a time ... Governmental intrvencion clear imagine. you can look to buy ...eur-cad--- gbp-cad----nzd.usd...

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Oh yes, too early on GY. On the other hand, if BOJ intervenes, it will spike up like CHF pairs a couple of weeks ago. But I'm not going to play that game! I was already looking at EURCAD at double bottom. The lows are close but 16 pips apart, and some historical support at 1.3600. But it's not a "by the book" PP, so I didn't enter. I'll watch, maybe enter if another opportunity shows up. I wasn't even watching GBPCAD. That's a nice PP formation! but I'm a little late to enter now. I have never considered pairs with spreads over about 3-4 pips because I always looked at M15 charts. I'll have to watch more pairs. I think this method allows more pairs as possibilities because on large TF the spread is not so big a deal. I like it so far!

--- 帖子 #655 ---
No I am not… Check higher tfs and you’ll know why. Last week’s candle for instance showed its hand clearly on this pair, that was one powerful bearish candle and forming W1 pivot high… I don’t like taking a long for instance when a 500/1000 number is blocking my way, I’d rather have it at my back pushing me up/down. I am long on EURCAD &amp; GBPCAD… Cheers, CB

--- 帖子 #656 ---
Wow, you are right, and I had not checked weekly TF! Thanks for that heads-up! I'm trading a $100 micro account, and I'm setting my trade size so SL is always $1 no matter how many pips. I'm shooting for 1:2 or 1:3 RR right now, too. This is much better than trading demo because I HATE to lose real money, even a few pennies! So I felt terrible when you pointed out that I neglected to check the higher TF. This is training my emotions for when my account grows into real money! Thank you for your teaching! And Portfirio, too! AF

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Stay in it and let it either take out your SL or reach TP... no one really knows what can happen. But just in order to have more odds stacked on your side it is your duty to check on everything. Once all checks out and you are in a trade and you get stopped, you'll know that you did all you could. You then move on while maybe having learned something from that failed trade. Glad to help

--- 帖子 #658 ---
EC trade is up 92 pips. I'm going to trail my SL at the low of previous M15 candle. Yes, I'm too chicken to hold on! But this way I won't lose money, and I won't let a winner turn into a loser. With my luck it would retrace all the way back to BE! I would rather be a little right than completely wrong. Anyway, the way it's ranging on higher TFs, I think it should head up to 1.4000. But if I get stopped out I'll wait for another retrace to enter long again.

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Ok, price did retrace and I went long. I'm still in it! I got a bad entry but it's up about 50 pips now. I had a big SL so it's small $$ and too small RR. If it slows down very much I'll jump out, otherwise I'll hang on until 1.2550 or 1.2600, depending on momentum.

--- 帖子 #660 ---
Hi Chantalb, It's very very creative of this method, and so much thanks for sharing! I like it very much. As one say candlestick contains the most important information compared with other classic indicators such as MA, RSI, KDJ etc, your trading strategy is a improving on combining fractal and candlestick. In case someone need, there I have an indicator on fractal which got from the internet and can show MTF signal. Best!

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Gracias amigo. So you usually use the daily to set your SL, using the last extreme of price i.e. last swing low / high, rather than looking on the 30min for the last swing low / high?

--- 帖子 #662 ---
GBPCAD - did you take the trade on the 15th Sept, or do you wait for a signal only when price is at the outer TMA band?

--- 帖子 #663 ---
I have been busy sorry gbp-cad ....d1-m30.... I bought on 20 septiempbre

--- 帖子 #664 ---
15 de septiembre?????????????????? noooo.... you have to wait for the setup ... you read the first post of chantalb again. buy ....20 sep

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Ok, interesting. Why was 15 Sept not a buy then please? I see an yellow arrow on the daily, then on the 30 min price was above the 100MA with TMA heading up. Why was this different to the 20th? This will maybe explain how you filter out trades....

--- 帖子 #666 ---
hi friend see here there is one thing you do not have clear 1. figure of the first post ... d1 waiting to be formed 2. once you've seen the figure in d1 ... go to m30

--- 帖子 #667 ---
see the dates of the entries and watch the candles on d1

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Aha, ahora está claro!! I had thought you didn't use the fractals for a signal on the D1 as with Chantal's method, instead you looked for the yellow x to appear as part of the TMA indicator, and then entered the following day after one appeared. Now I understand that you don't use the yellow x I can see why, or why not, you enter. How long have you been trading this system using TMA? It certainly looks very powerful....

--- 帖子 #669 ---
I notice that you are still in an AUDCAD short trade from the 9th Sept - what stopped you reversing this trade on either the 16th Sept or 21st Sept as there appeared to be long signals on these dates?

--- 帖子 #670 ---
not easy to explain ... I look at the candles in or out w1.. So I decided to wait to get out will put a picture ... to see if you understand if you've never read a pdf of candles, I advise you to do

GBPJPY analysis. Submitted to be graded by instructor! Monthly: Strong bearish trend through last 5 months. Weekly: Strong bearish, although there is a lower wick to end last week. Broke All Time Low or 118.78, and CLOSED BELOW. Daily: Last Wednesday 9/21 broke ATL, then retraced for a few hours to 34 pips above ATL, where it formed a perfect PP and then continued south (would have been a great H1 setup). Thursday continued bearish, hitting low almost 200 pips below All Time Low. Friday high bounced off ATL WITHIN 4 PIPS AS RESISTANCE!! Hourly: From NY close Thursday to Friday close, price retraced until 4pm hour when it bounced off ATL as RESISTANCE - this caused the entire Weekly wick. Then FINAL HOUR OF DAY AND WEEK closed 50 pips below ATL line. Conclusion: Daily and hourly reversals occurred at the very end of the week on all TFs, confluent with very strong ATL line, signalling bearish continuation. Look for first hourly candle of the week to give PP #3, with last hourly candle of Friday as the fractal, and close below the wick. Then enter short with SL at ATL 118.78 +10. Not sure what target TP should be. The hesitation would be that this would be a Sunday Asian session trade, so there would have to be good bearish momentum, or maybe wait until Monday London session. Please guys, what do you think? Tell me where I'm wrong, or right.

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Well it's just ranging around under 118.78, no direction to start the week. Maybe a hesitation before heading further south, maybe a breakout fake out on weekly TF.

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Although the trend is bearish .. This may be preparing a retracment ... And have possibility to enter into purchase

--- 帖子 #674 ---
Yes. Look we've had 3 tests of 118.78 All Time Low as Resistance and it failed to break back above it. Also I discovered 118.78 is EXACTLY the monthly S2 Pivot Point (not PP Price Pivot!). That's not the strongest pivot point, but it adds strength to that line. I don't mean to distract the thread but I'm just seeing all this to try to gain confidence when the PP forms and the entry signal occurs. Please tell me if I should not post about this.

Very nice trade Porifiro, again you decided to stay in this one instead of reversing at the earlier long signal on the 16th Sept - very well done!! For the new long trade, wouldn't today have been the entry day as the pivot / fractal / 1-2-3 has already formed?

Morning Porfirio, Exactly my pics as well... In addition to those I have GBPUSD - NZDCAD = BUY GBPAUD = SELL Now GBPUSD I would try for an entry at retrace of around 1.55 if it gets there And the other two still monitoring as I havent got yet my D1 PP but the setups look mighty good already for an earlier entry at supply/demand... Great day to all CB

hi chantalb...I'm glad to see you again g-j ...d1-m30

--- 帖子 #685 ---
EUR-CHF I see what you mean, no clear bearish "price-action" in the candle. Am learning more and more each time you and Chantal post up the trades you are looking at.....thanks!!

--- 帖子 #686 ---
Here’s an example of a setup I would not take regardless if tomorrow’s candle is worth 1000 pips. Now the day is not over yet, but assuming this is how today’s candle ends and a pivot high forms. Where we stand currently is still bullish territory and until reaching the sell zone on top I will not sell (after of course getting a confirmed and good looking PP). Same principle applies for the setup on the 25th of September.... and on the 18th we were in buyers territory (reference points mid of July till almost the end of it). CB

Likewise buddy, I am very pleased you are constantly showing your trades. All the best to you

Porfirio, thank you for posting your trade table with your entries and SL. You cannot imagine how helpful that is for me. I am trying to follow you to learn how you are thinking. This morning I went over a lot of these pairs and tried to enter but my entries and SL are poor. Now I can see how you are doing it and learn from you! Also, you have said that you sometime have trouble understanding our English. Have you tried Google Translator? Just copy and paste text and it will translate for you. It's a wonderful tool and very easy. Hope it's helpful. -AF http://translate.google.com/

--- 帖子 #694 ---
Aha So you are looking to short EURCAD based on a pivot on the 4hr, entry on the 15min maybe?

--- 帖子 #695 ---
It is indeed great to see your trades like this. One question on the trades entered yesterday e.g. NZDUSD, AUDJPY - were these not entered a day early i.e. wasn't the pivot confirmation candle yesterday, therefore they would have been entered today? Not that it would make much difference to the entry price mind you...

--- 帖子 #696 ---
Hi porfirio, what are the rules applied to this trade? It was nice trade but I don't see Price Pivots on D1/W1. Isn't that the first rule we look for? I appreciate your comment. Leelar

--- 帖子 #697 ---
Hi Leerar, I'm obviously not Porfirio but to perhaps save him some time posting another chart, if you are referring to the GU trade in his picture the pivot is clear on D1, as per below - the chart in his picture is 4hr...

--- 帖子 #698 ---
thank you very much alien ... I use it sometimes ---- shandy ... I have not probadop in lower TF but it sure works ... with the image that I just wanted to show an upward trend began h4 (price&gt; ema 100) and there is room to gray strength ---- leelar, I do it my way ... but the principle is the same, a triangle on d1 you select those which conform to the first post of chantalb .... I do not care to risk on demo and then study because I failed (or not) ----

--- 帖子 #699 ---
Hi Shandy, thanks for taking the time. Do you look at the indicator to say it is clear or the candle formation. If you look at the formation, then it is not what I understand the Price Pivot. Or at least they don't look as best Price Pivot as in post 1. Price Pivots, according to image on post 1. it is 3 bars. the confirmation bar(last bar) should be at least close higher/lower then the pivot bar. I don't think you chart look anything close to that. Please correct me if I misunderstood. if you are talking about the indicator (yellow *), then it is different story.

--- 帖子 #700 ---
Do you mind sharing your way of trading this principle? Do it in Spanish, I will do my own translation. if you don't mind, Thanks For the record, I have all of your charts on my ipad to read, can't summarize the rules that you trade, I tried. So please help me out.

Sold AUDUSD Weekly trend is down Daily - nice pinbar forming PP at retrace of downtrend. Candle #3 has a lower wick so it's not perfect but I'm going with the big bear weekly candle for momentum. H1 - Fib on D1 shows price bounce nicely off 61.8 fib, nice retrace. The PP hasn't quite formed so I'm a bit early on the entry, but all the rest of the signs are there. I'm short at 0.9841

--- 帖子 #703 ---
Hoping that fib 61.8 holds!

Please explain it here in English when you get it in Spanish, thank you.

I already told him BUT STILL SAYING ALL THIS IN THE FIRST POST OF CHANTALB The only thing different that I have added ...... IN D1 CANDLE 1 ... IS ONE CANDLE CANDLE 2 ... IS ONE CANDLE CANDLE 3 .... IS ONE CANDLE .... OR MORE (POST 676) CANDLE 3--- closes above (BUY) OR BELOW (SELL) CANDLE 2 AFTER I go to M30 AND ENTERED WHEN THE PRICE AND TMA (or BB) ARE ABOVE OR BELOW THE EMA 100 AND NOTHING MORE

Nice post. It helps to see the market more objectively.

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Thinking about your charts some more... Right now price is in a downtrend on all TFs - not in any zones. Does this mean you would enter only a short trade on EU right now? Or are you not entering, but instead waiting until it reaches a zone, and then breaks out toward a new zone? I'm thinking that I would enter short trades, but no long trades. And be careful about TP targets, because we are approaching a Demand Zone where price could stall or reverse.

--- 帖子 #711 ---
Hi Porfirio, To understand your TSL strategy a bit better, on this previous EURJPY trade did you move your SL up after the 4hr TMA pivot on the 15th Sept, or did you take the full loss at the original SL position?

--- 帖子 #712 ---
Hi AF, The reason why I posted all the above charts was to give everyone an overall picture. As I mentioned before in one of my posts, what is really important is to look at the bigger picture. If I wanted to give a short bias I would have shown a yearly chart starting from 2007 for example. But that would not be the whole story… We are at the end of the month and at the end of the 3rd quarter. How bearish does the overall CHART (not candle) look on bigger tfs? Have we broken any major lows so far? Look at the charts again; look at the whole thing starting all the way from the left starting with yearly chart…. We have already hit a major WDZ and price reacted to that. Now will we be able to bounce back up from here, we’ll see…. Will we breach this zone and print new lows, we’ll also find out. I am on the sidelines here on this pair waiting to see how price will digest this area. For me, price here is too cheap to sell, I’d rather wait to buy once the dust settles. We cannot predict the future; all we can do is prepare for it. We do that by being objective, reasonable and flexible through open eyes. Below is another view of higher tfs… Hope this helps… Cheers, CB

--- 帖子 #713 ---
Here is also something I like to do. Those give me a rough image of a 5 year and 3 year candle chart. I don't know why, but odd numbers have always worked better for me, and these two are those I use in most of my TA. Good weekend to you all, Chantal

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Chantalb, thanks for the patient explanation. The pics with your notes really help! I feel like SUCH a noob! HAHA! (But I'm learning, with your help and several other here at FF.) Well, not really a noob anymore, but maybe a sophomore. It seems so obvious once you see it laid out like that! I think it's because you are a good teacher, too. There are so few bars on a yearly chart that I never thought there was any trend, or anything else, to see! Now I can see it. It makes sense that each OHLC level on yearly must be a major level on a lower TF. Same for quarterly to monthly/weekly, etc. I do remember you posted this at the beginning of the thread. Now I'm learning how to actually do it! I need to practice this perspective. Everyone have a nice weekend!

if you move the sl, shandy the tendendencia is your friend .... you should go with the trend ... your uses a sma or ema 100 or 200 I know I'm going against the trend I ... I never would in real ...

AUDUSD Closed my AU short for 134 pips. For me that is spectacular! Now price is retracing. Waiting for PP high signal and then sell again. Monthly: Either broke a support TL or created a new low point. But big bearish candle looks good for bear. 0.9500 is montly SR so it may bounce. Weekly: 5 bear weeks in a row. Went right through recent consolidation zone and is at bottom of that zone now. Last week was a big rejection bar, bearish outlook Daily: Consolidation last 2 weeks. Retrace last week, high bounce around 8/7 low. Waiting for price to show the way this week.

--- 帖子 #720 ---
Hi Guys Thanks Chantalb - great thread and system. I noted PPs on the Aud/ Cad/ AudJpy and CadJpy that would have triggered today but didn't retrace enough for entry. I am however assuming that say in the case of Aud where a good looking low test bounced off the 0.94 level (and infact the others also) that the overall trend would have gone against and therefore there was no trade? Looking back at resistance and support these markets look to be at the extension of wide channels. In the case of the Cad strong resistance around 1.06 (top of channel) has a bottom around 0.94. The 200 ma is currently 0.9889. Does this mean that we cannot short this market until it is beneath the 200 ma. If so then the bulk of the channel move will be lost. Am I confusing the meaning of 'the trend' or is it really just above or below the 200 ma on the Daily chart. Many thanks for any help.

Hi Guys, Not much commentary here for a while. Are you all still trading the system or are the set ups not as frequent?

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Hi ChantalB et al I know that things have gone quiet on this thread for a while, but there was a big high test bar through the (EurUsd) 1.34 level yesterday and we are hovering around yesterdays low right now. Trend down. But Support around 1.3260 and 1.3160ish. If today closes above 1.3286 then no trade otherwise a pull back to a fib level might give a good opportunity -no? NFP may impede too. Will be watching with interest. Regards

At these levels of D1 I would not be looking to sell cause we are at buyers’ prices. I would be looking to buy some trades and hold for maybe a few weeks depending on PA. Alternatively one could simply just trade the lower TFs. I haven’t been trading lately the longer term. On the 28th of November, last Monday I resumed work for the first time in two months, but that was just heavy scalping for the week to keep me busy. Those Monday/Tuesday bars that look like pin bars are the result of consumption of sell orders freeing the way for price to move higher. Now technically I would expect price to move higher next week after retracing to around 1.3300 or even go further to fill last week’s gap. If for whatever reason we should break a major low like 1.3145 I would then look to sell after a retrace higher and still be very wary as to where buyers might be sitting for e.g. 1.2900/1.3000 and then if that breaks convincingly I wait for a retest of that to take a sell and so on and so forth. Hope this was helpful, Cheers, Chantal

Hey, there and keep going your good stuff! I have two questions in one, for you, if I may: Can you attach on your trade explorer a demo account, for other people to see how your trading system is actually trading or can you provide, from time to time, some trades, as an examples based on your system, please? I am asking that because some people including me would want to see if your system actually work or, at least, generates some trade profits. Thank you.
