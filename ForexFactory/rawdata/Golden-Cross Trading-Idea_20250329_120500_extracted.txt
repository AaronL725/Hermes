In the literature one finds different variants for the Golden-Cross and Death-Cross, mostly as a crossing of a short with a long moving average. Here I present my own variant, namely the crossing of two LWMAs (Linear Weighted MA) calculated with period 5 for Open and Close. The "smGoldenCross Trend" indicator plots the moving averages, or just the mean of the two moving averages. Attached Image (click to enlarge) An interesting and useful idea is to determine the future close values for which the crossing will take place. A buy stop or sell stop on this level can be considered. Attached Image (click to enlarge) For trading you should use the "Triple Screen" method according to Elder. The timeframes Upper, Current, Lower are: M15-M5-M1 H1-M15-M5 H4-H1-M15 D1-H4-H1 W1-D1-H4 MN1-W1-D1 If there are members who are interested in this idea, I will also post further indicators.

Hi Swingman, Good to see your post. I've used the 50EMA &amp; 200EMA &amp; it served me well. Best wishes for your thread.

New version "smGoldenCross Signals_v1.1 " Here is a new version with signals, and a small correction has also been made. (Please replace the version "Trend_v2.1" with "Trend_v2.2" in #Post 1). For a long trend, the program makes a prediction at what price the trend will change from long to short. So that a signal does not come at the first tick, one can take into account a small distance (the parameter "Offset_forCrossing=10" e.g.) The crossing signals will be sent as alerts and emails for each time frame of the triple screen.

Hi, is it possible to have the indicator for MT5?

--- 帖子 #12 ---
All Crosses happen after price has moved for a significant amount , so most of the actual trade is lost due to the lag. In your pictures, assuming you would had taken those trades, you would had barely break even. How long have you traded this ideea?

--- 帖子 #13 ---
.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
With the rules of Triple Screen , one can do the following: - In order to trade on D1, one should consider the main trend of W1. - Entries can be made directly on D1, or a time frame lower, on H4.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
The actual cross was confirmed on the close of day 3/02 yet somehow you are counting the points from the begining of the daily bar. Are you somehow able to see crosses before they occur?

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Please replace from #Post 10 the version Signals_v1.0 with Signals_v1.1

People prefer to first criticize before reading or trying it out themselves. Of course most of them wont even do that much and stop at criticising. Those are commonly known as morons and shouldn't be paid attention to. Otherwise they actually think that people care about their idiotic opinion, giving them a feeling of accomplishment. He is a new member, yet already manages to write so much trash that he could easily be a candidate for the next US President voting. Everyone should put him on the ignore list, before he thinks he is actually worth anything.

A nice concept. I will test it. A stupid question. Would you combine this with other Strategies you tested before? And most important as always. Whats the best money Management

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Nobody is perfect, not even me... Very nice that you are critical of the indicator, but from your two contributions I have the impression that you have not fully understood the basic idea. Mathematically, it is calculated at which price the two moving averages will cross. Of course, after this point in time, prices will fluctuate, and at the end of the bar the crossover will exist or be a long time coming. In any case, one have a predicted value at which an action can be started. Rules on how to get in, how to calculate risk and how to get out are quite a lot, and that is the job of the trader. If I see that the idea can be put into practice, I will also program an EA, that's no problem. I would also like to know how qualified your comments are so that they are worth further replying to. For that I ask you to share how to calculate the predicted price for crossing the two moving averages. It's easy…

good thread .... setting period 5 using MA can be use to see direction of price

--- 帖子 #23 ---
New version "smGoldenCross Signals_v2.0" The big arrows in the previous version made the charts cluttered, so I eliminated them. Now rectangles are drawn, with limits the crossing price and the min/max HiLo's of the last two bars. Together with range values from the ChannelOscillator, one can easily create an entry strategy... (But always consider the upper trend!)

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Just do it yourself with MAs.

hi SM Your "smGoldenCross_ " keep getting better and better .... thank you. I am sure we can develop a trading system with this. I use 5LWMA Close,Shift0 / 5EMA Typical,Shift+2 for 'signal'. Attached Image (click to enlarge) ...

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Hi @emmanuel, It is always a pleasure to read your objective and well-founded contributions! Your comment which I no longer see about the range is correct, I will explain later why the oscillator is important. What I really like now is that you used the MiniCharts for the TripleScreen! (One would still have to draw the middle MA with the crossing arrows.) I've also prepared something like that, but I probably won't do it to make room for several charts. Signals after crossing MAs is well known. But I was also interested in having forecast a certain price where an entry would be reasonable and possible. In "Stocks &amp; Commodities" Feb.2007, Dimitris Tsokakis wrote an article about it: "Anticipating Moving Average Crossover".

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Hi @hesron, your idea is good, but you can delete the post because the cycles belong to a completely different species. For this we have the great expert @parisboy here in the forum, and one can learn a lot from him. The idea that I am now trying to program step by step, is to use the small impulse “Closes cross Opens” to advantage. It's not a finished product as anyone here has suggested, and I do have other interesting details to share.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hi Swing man, awesome idea to integrate 3 Screen method. I noticed that a good portion of my sl and failed trades could have been avoided if i had checked higher TFs and not obsessively stuck to one TF, but to be honest, it is damn tiring to flip charts on daily work. Any chances of doing a complete 3-screen method from Alexander Elder so that it could be traded from one screen?

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Hi, in MT4 there is the possibility to create profiles, then it's easy

--- 帖子 #31 ---
New version "smGoldenCross Signals_v3.0" (I'm sorry, but I made a big mistake, and I calculated signals for the lower time frame as well, and that only works for the upper time frame!) Short remarks: - In the current chart, the background is drawn according to the trend in the upper time frame. - The value of the close forecasting is written on the last bar, so that it is easier to place an order. I think now it's easy to see that trading towards the UpperTrend is favorable! I can already see some problems in the charts... If anyone tests the indicator and finds bugs or has suggestions, please post.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Thank you for the indicator but I see only this on screen H4, Swingman

Hello guys, this Morning around London open i have taken Trades in Eur/USD Eur/GBP and EUR/JPY - i dont know if the signals are corrent. Because i dont know what exactly the osci is about and i only have checked if the higher charts are in the same direction. No Pa or something else. every trade went well because of the lack of the Euro they are now at 1:1 RR. Would you put the stop at be and let the trades run or better to close? Its a live account so i only have drawn lines than enter a trade.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Here is the source code of the oscillator: https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...6#post13833426 It calculates the ATR and a channel range to easily calculate entry, TP and stop distances. One may find that it is optimal to take the smallest value between ATR and channel range! Your entries are correct because they were taken in the direction of UpperTrend = Long. One can also wait until the price moves in the direction of the predicted close in the opposite direction = Short. For such decisions I will also post later an indicator with the trend slope.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Hi @emanuell, I happened to see your chart in this post (AUDUSD, W1, HeikinAshi). https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...6#post14304436 Here I am posting two charts in parallel, and one can compare very nicely the trends and the turning points, in the charts with the GoldenCross und HeikinAshi indicators. Because the trends are pretty much identical, the advantage in visual informations lies with the GoldenCross , because the UpperTrend is also taken into account!

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Hi @Hesron, OK, you only have the background for the current timeframe here. One would have to have an additional chart (e.g. M3 with different parameters), and then name the M3 as UpperTrend. The problem is that because of the different bar spacing, it's hard to tell how it works.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
yes , because time frame need choice setting with offline chart , OnTick()

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Thanks for the Answer i will see how it works. Some New Trade Ideas - long USD/CAD at 1.36152 - H4 to Weekly is long . i Could not work because of the resistance exactly above the level. short AUD/USD at 0.67390 - H4 to Weekly is short. long GBP/JPY at 163.795 - H4 to Weekly is long i

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Hi... Sorry, why on my chart I see this?

--- 帖子 #42 ---
New version "smGoldenCross Signals_v3.1" - One can set the background colors. There are some problems on the right edge, e.g. the signals are still wrong and the background color is not correct. The corrections will come in the near future.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Thank you so much for your time invested and sharing this system with us! I've always thought about a system that can summarize indicators in terms of trend and orient to higher timeframes while finding the appropriate entries on a lower one. Additionally the chart is clear and not cluttered. For me personally, this is pretty much the best system on Forex Factory.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
You should always try to find an explanation yourself, make a description, and then explain to the programmer what he did wrong... I corrected some errors in version 3.1 and there are still some left. I can only determine that with live prices, today and tomorrow when I have time. Also now there are errors on the right edge where the buy/sell signals are wrong and the background is incorrect. A quick reset of the chart helps, e.g. a change of time frames.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Are you testing this method on Renko charts?

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Wnen I try and compile "smGoldenCross Signals_v3.1" I get 3 errors and the indicator will not load. What am I doing wrong?

--- 帖子 #47 ---
A program ".ex4" like "Signals_v3.1" cannot be compiled, only ".mq4" files.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Thanks for quick response......When I loaded indicator without compiling, it did load. But I was not able to attach to the chart.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Hi SM, I'm using v 3.1 but my panel is empty. Show info panel is true. Thanks

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Always write the pair and the timeframe, otherwise I can't test! I saw that and the solution was to set a maximum number of bars (version 3.2). There is a problem with the bar number calculation in the UpperTimeframe.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
New version "smGoldenCross Signals_v3.2" I think I corrected the background color. Now there are still a few problems with the display.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Just change your Mt4 background to white and re attache the indicator

--- 帖子 #53 ---
MTF golden cross will be helpful to avoid looking at 3 time frames,if the line is drawn from higher time frame shown to lower time frame and the future forecasting can also draw line until broken ,then entry would be better,thanks

--- 帖子 #54 ---
I didn't understand what you mean. Give an example.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Sorry, sir. No offence, please. This is my poor English, I didn't want to offend you at all. Regards

--- 帖子 #56 ---
This guy mean, that MTF indicator could be good and the background will show the higher timeframe, so we will have on just one timeframe both signals. I've been thinking of this option as well, but to my mind the current concept is better then MTF. IMHO

I'm trying on EURUSD H1 with 3.2 but the panel doesn't work. I'm also trying to change the maximum bars.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Hello friends and SwingMan sir, As you are using crossing of two LWMAs (Linear Weighted MA) calculated with period 5 for Open and Close, we are very well aware of the fact that market is ranging more to trap the retail traders than going onto trend direction, so in my opinion if you can make the option of selecting the 3 time frames in the indicator and the indicator would draw a horizontal line on the highest time frame selected in the setting.so if we are in smaller time frame,we know that higher time frame cross is intact and another horizontal line is drawn on current time frame price label until it is broken.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
I don't know exactly why you should do that. Will think about it. In my chart you can see very easily with the background colors which signals are to be traded exclusively.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Hi SM, I agree, the secret of success in trading is to teach the mind on thinking in multi time frame.ma I use to trade from lower TFs confirmed by higher ones. The key is to watch what is happening in higher time frames from a lower chart. In my humble oppinion and my poor english, Theres one thing that could make the difference in the actual Indicator you are building. It would be to option to draw the MAs and the crosses joint to everything else, from a current chart to Current+1TF, Current+2TF or even to +3TF. The benefits would be to get into a trade of Higher TF from a lower one, decreassing the SL and increassing TP RATIO. Same risk, higher benefits. It will erase the noise of the multi crosses on ranging market too.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
New version "smGoldenCross Signals_v3.3" Some corrections have been made. I believe that the signals/alerts are correct now. Because in sideways zones the predicted close for a bar can move back and forth, it is recommended to take an offset to the entry (e.g. Offset_forEntrySignal=10 ). For these sideways zones one should have a filter for false signals. I will present something, but other suggestions can also be considered.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
please consider my request because the background color repaints ,so i wouldnt trust the background color of small time frames.thanks

--- 帖子 #65 ---
I think you will understand that I should now program my idea to the end. In the meantime I'm thinking about your or other suggestions and if something is interesting I'll think about programming it.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
SM, Your trade system is simply amazing. Thanks if it would be possible, to have the crossing signals of higher time frames in lower time frames charts, the all the minor noise will be erased and entries, multi confirmed, would be awesome. My english is not very good, hope to be useful, what I meant to say. Thanks again

--- 帖子 #67 ---
The crossing signals in the UpperTimeframe has one in the CurrentTimeframe as a color change of the background. Please try to work with it, I don't have the time to program new ideas now, because my own ones aren't ready yet.

Thank you @josi for your information. Why didn't you post the informations about Adam Grimes here as well? https://adamhgrimes.com/death-cross-omen-noise/ https://adamhgrimes.com/death-golden...s-deeper-look/ If the great Grimes had determined that the Golden Cross system had no statistical advantage, I would have saved my time and no more programming the system! OK, this is the end of the fun, and I won't post any more until Grimes gives the green light to my system. It is true that he evaluated something completely different, but the claim about the statistical advantage remains for everyone who has not yet understood what it is about.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hai Thanks for the new indicator. may i have one suggestion to use FRACTAL high low zigzag indicator attached to get breakout on trend zone .. see snap as marked. yes, less signal can see , needs to test.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
SM, I have a humble offer for you. It is to collaborate and evaluate, probably a very profitable system. I have an own indicator that provides very good information about Price Action+Impulse at the same time. Probably, this indicator, joint to your Golden-Cross sytem could be something unprecedented. I am already trading with it, but tooks me a lot of time to realize the fundamentals to develop it. Watch my posted images here and probably you will see the potential. I have studied your past threads and I admire you because you are a great developer mind. Thank you in advance. My respects to you!

--- 帖子 #72 ---
What you posted is definitely correct. One can use the visual information about the UpperTrend in different ways. If you trade with the ZigZag from time to time, please post such trades.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
I will definitely do that. It has always interested me whether there is a better indicator than what I have developed...

--- 帖子 #74 ---
New version smGoldenCross Signals_v4.1 - Now one have the entry values in the trend change direction as additional information. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The entries are calculated from the predicted close. For example, for the long direction, half the value from the channel oscillator is taken as the offset from predicted Close to Entry,, and one can give as order the calculated entry as a Buy-Stop. The entry value at the cross in short direction can be considered as exit for this trade, and if one have time, one can quickly evaluate the trades with this simple rule. Attached Image (click to enlarge) If one put the parameter "Draw_Entrys_ForAllBars = true" one draw the predicted entries for all bars. In this way, one can see that most of the forecast exit values will not be reached by the time the trend changes. When a signal comes, the trader can decide for himself whether to close the trade or not.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
New oscillator "smGoldenCross Slope_v2.0" One calculates the mean of the open and close prices. For this moving average, the slope is calculated as the difference between the current value and the "Slope_Distance" value before it (e.g. 2 bars). One is given a threshold as a proportion of ATR (e.g. Factor_SlopeFiltering=0.30), and for slopes below this value one can consider the trend as sideways. (The blue line is the ATR value). Gray histograms are drawn for slope values below the threshold, and in the normal case the histograms are drawn with different colors for rising and falling values. The filtering can be switched off with the parameter (Draw_SlopeFilterLines=false).

--- 帖子 #76 ---
SwingMan Can you post the source codes for Indicators smGoldenCross Slope_v2.0.ex4 and smGoldenCross Signals_v4.1.ex4

Hi SM, I loaded the indicator but I see that the histograms for the next bar are missing. Buffers are empty. if I edit the indicator or load another symbol then the histograms are drawn

When you try to attach the indicator check the expert tab, probably you will see some warning.

Hi SM could you help me to recall buffers value from the indicator? I wrote the value for the parameters I see in the input, then the buffer and then the bar number Print(iCustom(NULL,0,"smGoldenCross Slope_v2.1",2,0.3,1,1,2,1)) ; I have this

--- 帖子 #85 ---
I think it gives 5 parameters. Who is the string as 3-th parameter?

--- 帖子 #86 ---
I see 4 parameters in Inputs: Slope_Distance = 2 Factor_SlopeFiltering = 0.3 Draw_Cross/Arrows = 1 Draw_SlopeFilterLines = 1 So the string as 3-th parameter should be Draw_Cross/Arrows iCustom(NULL,0,"smGoldenCross Slope_v2.1",Slope_Distance,Factor_SlopeFiltering,Draw_Cross/Arrows,Draw_SlopeFilterLines,Mode,Shift) If I use "0" as buffer the function returns Slopes value and it's correct. If I use "1" as buffer I would expect ATR value but it doesn't work.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
You are right because: In program are also other line indexes! Only for you, you can use following syntax with the indexes 8 and 10: Inserted Code string OscName="smGoldenCross Slope_v2.1"; double Slope=iCustom(Symbol(),Period(),OscName,0,1); double ATR =iCustom(Symbol(),Period(),OscName,8,1); double Limit=iCustom(Symbol(),Period(),OscName,10,1);

Where do I find the expert tab?

@SwingMan do I get the concept of this strategy correctly? 1 - entry point confirmed by higher timeframe 2, 3, 4 - possible additional entries according to the oscillator 5 - possible exit Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Your interpretation is correct. If you post, it's more helpful for me to see the pair and timeframe, then I can eventual do a test. I see you are using older indicator versions, please download the latest versions from #Post 83 .

Hi SM, are you trying to recall the oscillator in an expert? I'm trying to write an expert but I seem it's quite CPU consuming (I'm not a serious programmer). I wrote the oscillator 4 times in an expert and the memory crashed.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
I have no experience with iCustom() for third-party indicators. Perhaps a version with a limited number of bars, or direct programming in the EA would help

Have anyone try to automate this strategy?

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Hi @ifx777 , I just saw that you improved the Lazy TMA. That's good because I've had other projects in the meantime. Now, as for the GoldenCross idea: In order to automate something here, one first have to understand what it is about, recognize the potential of the idea, have time for programming, testing and applying. Apparently nobody has taken the first steps yet and for me there is no point in posting something that nobody understands and can use. What I can say with certainty is that if someone has tested and used them, they will never post the EA in a forum!

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I actually look into this one as well, and this is on my to-do list, I really like the work you have done, and I belive I can turn these products into something that can make steady profits in the long run.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
The GoldenCross will definitely do that! Here is a small example of the indicators used. Actually, there are still programming errors, but that doesn't bother me. Programming an EA is a bit easier, but first one needs to visually determine some trading parameters.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
I am grateful to you for the work you have done. The method you shared before and I have attached the screenshot did not yield positive results. So he usually loses. I wanted to let you know bro

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Hello @ozkanim , nice that you are interested in the idea. It is very nice that you added the TDI indicator. It would also be sufficient to use only the red/green indicator and one will immediately see that the places where the green line crosses the red line, are almost identical. Now an analysis of your post: - In the threads about "Trading made simple" all TDI experts stated that the best time frame for trading considering the TDI, is H4. There are too many noises in the underlying time frames. - The assertion that there are usualy losses in your evaluation may be true, because you do not know my trading rules. I can assure you that the section of the chart you posted is in the win! Unfortunately I don't have the time right now to correct the indicator that draws the background, so some signals may be confusing.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Here the chart on H4:

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Yes, I also observed its compatibility with TDI. The best method I've found so far is to deal with hidden mismatch using TDI and osma indicators. I couldn't find the attached indicator here.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
In a quarter of the time, I also use TDI to provide a higher rate of entry with support approval.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
But the method I mentioned is very difficult to automate. Human intuition required

--- 帖子 #114 ---
The ChannelOsc can be found in #Post 23, was that the problem? I may not post all the indicators with details because I suspect the idea can be very successful and will be copied right away. But, I can comment on comments if someone tests and analyzes seriously.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
You are putting in a lot of effort. And you share. I think this is very valuable. Of course I'll check it out and come back here.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Congratulations on doing this! I have no intuition and find it better to trade without thinking... As an example, I could not achieve to trade the TDI: one must consider SR, time, peaks and valleys, stochastic, and other rules as described in the TMS thread, and only after 2-3 years of training you are allowed to live trade. With the GoldenCross one already has entry and exit values in the signal indicator 4.5, and with some money management rules one can sleep the whole day without stress. I have drawn some vertical lines in the chart and one can see that either GC gives earlier signals than TDI, or on the same bar. Isn't that nice and reassuring ?

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Do you really expect people to actually read something?

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Soon will get to automation and implementing risk management, then we will see the results.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
What system are you doing this for, so I can track?

--- 帖子 #120 ---
@SwingMan What is your exit rule?

--- 帖子 #121 ---
There are 4 or 5 exit rules, and please don't trade much on TFs smaller then H4! As for the entry: - For people who have little intuition, one is not allowed to make buy trades in the yellow area, only in the blue area. The background areas show the overall trend. The indicator 4.5 does not correctly draw the beginning of the upper trend (MTF problem), and 4.7 is not ready yet. There are special rules for entries in this zone. - I am very curious if someone can formulate why this border zone is critical for programming signals... For Exit: - Initial SL can be the LL of the last 2 bars - If a BarRange is reached after entry, one can set BreakEven - In your chart, the exit is at the close of the bar with the opposite direction signal (or the open of the next bar). - In general one can exit after 2xBarRange from the HH. (The small colored areas are drawn for easy direction orientation with the valid signals.)

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Thank you for your suggestion regarding the timeframe. In the attached screenshot, I marked the 4 parameters required for login. Could you please confirm it's true or false thank you

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Is very good, and with the value from #4 (brown line) the entry level is calculated etc. The ChannelOsc uses my method to calculate the BarRange I named. It is actually a login parameter, a variant where the ATR is also taken into account, but is better for practice. I recommend using this value in trading to calculate LotSize, BreakEven and TrailingStop. If one does this and takes a risk of e.g. 1%, one can quickly approximate the percent profit and the results of the trades.

Hi @ozkanim, - I'm curious when you will find out that you no longer need the TDI! Perhaps you comment on some signals in comparison, but also compare your TDI entries after a signal, with the levels specified by the GC. Can one identify advantages and disadvantages? - One can also omit the slope indicator, which is generally very good. When one trades manually, it is very helpful in determining where the initial impulse is weakening and an exit is near.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
I keep the TDI indicator on my list for hidden incompatibility, but I'm considering removing this indicator as well.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
upcoming days we will start making a fresh ea, just based on this strategy, I will post an update for another ea, that we have made out of your strategy later this week.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Swingman is there any reason you used ma of 5 and why LWMA?. Thanks

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Just for visual testing. - The signals are comparable to TDI signals, and Malone was not asked why he took his periods. If TDI is commented on in hundreds of thousands of postings, I assumed that there must be something to it... - Of course one can change the period, I did that and stayed with 5 because of the convenience. More important are the rules of what to do when a signal comes. - I would keep the LWMA, it reacts fast enough.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
If you wanted to / had time to I would love to compare it to Simple MA of 8 on the Open / Close price.... (Not my idea) but something I have been trading this week with some success as I use your indi with longer time frames as confirmation Happy to share with you if you want.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Been following and catching up on this thread... Have you managed to get anywhere with this?

--- 帖子 #132 ---
New version "smGoldenCross Signals_v4.7.1" It would be nice to post examples of how you use the indicator as well. The arrows for predicted closes and entry levels are only calculated for LWMA and SMA.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
How would you filter out the 'choppy signals'? or rely on the winning ones being enough to recoup loss?

--- 帖子 #134 ---
I recommend testing the signals and my rules, then you probably have the answer YES... In general, one does not need a filter. The Donchian channel is good enough to determine where and how price action is taking place. So far, however, no one has made an evaluation and posted it, so that I am not interested in developing it further for those who are not interested in the idea and do not bring any feedback.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
I'm currently waiting for the week to get started, will comeback after with results

--- 帖子 #136 ---
@Swingman This is what I am using atm. Simple MA 8 / 8 on open close and DMI 8/8 showing only + and -. I'm trading on 15 min time frame, wait for crosses to match and pull trigger. I was late on the trade shown but got lucky and still made money. I'm using your template to confirm longer timeframes match.. Not going to discuss exits but there are some rules there to.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Hi SwingMan, Thanks for the great idea and indicator. I am not able to write any experiences yet, I can see it in a week. I only have a question, is it possible to set an alarm on the arrows that mark the buy limit or sell limit, see the attachment. I looked in the settings but couldn't find it, I only get an alarm when the trend changes. Thank you very much. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #138 ---
I think the alarm is there. .

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Actually I already know that the signals and the background are not correct at the last bar. But if nobody examines the idea and determines exactly what is wrong, it can stay that way. All the areas in the background are also partly wrong, but no one noticed that either, because only someone who has analyzed the idea can also say why.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
Hey Swingman, What bands are you using there? Looks like donchian?

--- 帖子 #141 ---
I thought I would get an alarm when the limit setting arrow appears. What you are showing is the alarm when it has already hit the arrow.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Yes, see #Post 134.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
The limit setting arrow and the entry value are drawn at each bar. If the limit is not reached, the arrow and the limit will be deleted at the next bar. Isn't that so? With alarm and 20 pairs, 20 alarms would be sent every 4 hours. The idea is to set stop orders, possibly with an EA, and when an entry level has been reached, one should get the corresponding warning (alert message).

--- 帖子 #144 ---
But for manual trading, it would be good to receive an alarm when the arrow appears to set the limit and cancel the limit if the limit is not confirmed. What do you think? In the picture, I tested on M1 where the arrow appeared, but I did not receive the alarm. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Please post a decent chart with a light background, I can't see the entry level at the last bar. Please trade H4. At each new bar is drawn simultaneously "Price for Crossing" and "Entry Price". You don't need an alarm to set a buy/sell stop. These values are written in "Data Window", and when "Entry Price" is reached, an alarm comes up so you can follow the trade, e.g. an EA is trading.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Sorry for the colors. So there is no option to send an alarm when Entry Price (Limit) arrow appears? (Receiving an alarm when the arrow appears and not when it is reached) Sometimes it happens that an arrow appears and the price flies through Entry Price within 1 minute and it is not possible to react to it manually, especially when I am not sitting next to it. Please. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #147 ---
In your chart the entry price is 138.742 When the bar opens, a small line is drawn in a rectangle, and when the price reaches this value, a horizontal arrow is drawn. Entry prices are marked as an aid to each bar at the open of the bars. I have given explanations in #Post 143 and 145. Can anyone confirm that this is or not the case, and that alerts should be sent on each new bar?

--- 帖子 #148 ---
I can imagine what you actually want! If I'm not sitting in front of the screen every 4 hours and following the signals, but trade on my yacht with the mobile phone, one needs to get the signals from my VPS server via notify or email. Then I can enter the buy/sell-stop orders with an expiration time of 2x4=8 hours (two bars). Ok, I would understand that, and if one trades 4-5 pairs and not 20, then one gets 4-5 messages with the current entry price for each pair. Some levels will be reached, some will not, and after another 4 hours new messages will appear.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
But I don't get an alert when it a horizontal arrow is drawn. I only receive alarm when horizontal arrow was reached. I see on the chart that a horizontal arrow has appeared, but I don't get any alarm about it, I only get the alarm when levels was reached. If it worked so that I get an alarm when a horizontal arrow appears, eg buy, then I would immediately set the SL below the nearest LL and TP, eg. 2:1 and wait for the market to move and open the position or not. Sorry my English is bad and maybe we don't understand each other.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Perhaps you are right about the understanding. In my previous post I wrote what I assume what you need, and it's nice that you're trying to use the indicator! Actually, I don't feel like explaining several times that when you're sitting at the computer, you don't need alarms. One just has to look at the clock from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. every 4 hours. The entry levels are written in a rectangle on the right side of the chart, and one only has to place the orders. When one isn't sitting in front of the computer, like I'm trading on my yacht, then I get the alerts and messages on my mobile phone, and then I place the orders. I'll add this option for alerts sometime later, but if you don't have a yacht, little helps... On the other hand, only those who use the system correctly can buy a yacht in 1-2 years. Please try to analyze and understand my exit rules in #Post 121. The fixed 2:1 RR rule seems to be fine just because it is mentioned in at least 50 other threads. With my rules, one easily achieves variable 5 to 10:1 RRs,

--- 帖子 #151 ---
I also started with a small boat... Attached Image (click to enlarge) and now with Golden-Cross...

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Oki Swing Man :-) I'm sorry, but after a thorough study of how the indicator behaves, I understood what you wrote :-) As I understood, if the trend is buy on D1 and H4, then it is important for me to monitor when the sell signal occurs on H4 and then I will place buy limits every 4 hours? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #153 ---
and what about this, both sell limits were active, therefore loss-making, is that right? Is it possible to add push notifications? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Now everything is correctly commented! For long trends on D1 only Buy-Stop orders are allowed, and this always every 4 hours. If you have questions like in your next post, it should be visible which pair is and the time scale, otherwise I can't check.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
The second drawn signal 2-Buy may not be traded in the D1 short trend. One could do that if the prices were much closer to the Donchian Channel. The sell signals should be traded one, there are actually sometimes losses. My broker ( Pepperstone ) doesn't have your 3-Sell. Check the prices because I believe that the Low has not reached the EntryPrice, otherwise the indicator would have drawn an arrow. I'm still thinking about the push notifications.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Hello Swingman, i’ve spent all the morning to re-read the thread, and i’m going to spend all my time focused on your system. I see it very profitable because I spent my time combine only golden cross with Rsi 4 cross EMA20, shift 2 and at same time cross 55 line to buy / 45 line to sell. Its a reliable signal to catch a reverseal but dont follow the big trend… this signal mostly occurs at the beggining of the golden cross of bigger TF, but sometimes its a false signal. maybe the key is follow the big trend. one doubt i Have, what is for you barRange you mentioned in old post to go to breakeven? I spent all afternoon to see charts. Get that way my friend I appreciate your work!

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Very good that you did that! Spend another 20-30 afternoons and you will slowly become familiar with the system... Your analyzes with other indicators mean nothing to me unless you post some charts. - I only compared the signals with the popular TDI indicator used in other 2-3 threads and didn't see any significant advantages or differences. - The Donchian Channel is good for trading signals against the main direction. - I have described my BarRange or ChannelRange somewhere. One should use it because it's better than the naked ATR.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
I didn't quite understand what you tested with the RSI. The system is good, okay. - I recommend trading only in the direction of the main trend for several reasons. - Reversals only trade after longer trends and near the Donchian Channel. - The BigTrend is marked with the background color.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
My Roboforex broker Attached Image (click to enlarge) hit sell stop at 134.642

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Why wasn't there a horizontal sell arrow? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #161 ---
You asked correctly. Also in #Post 139 I wrote that the indicator had a small problem with the upper time frame. In this case, the bar is on the border of the main trends and the long trend is wrongly assumed, so no sell arrows are drawn. That's wrong, and the arrow at 04:00 is wrong too. One should not worry because such cases are rare and are not always at a loss. Of course there is an explanation and a solution. I think I wrote that whoever posts a statement will get a big bonus from me. For people who don't understand how the system works and don't post any results or charts, I thought there was no point in revealing the great secret of the right interfaces in this thread...

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Hello Sir, Is quite difficult to understand all the system because in every post I learn something new to implement and I need to understand very well what is every parameter, so I am a completely newbie on this system, I need more afternoons than I thought. So, First, my first trouble, very basic: I'm using the last version of Signals v4.7.1, and I have some doubt about background, my chart everytime I change it o refresh changes, with zones in grey and zones in blue, why happens? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) EDIT: On version 4.5 I don't have this problem Attached Image (click to enlarge) And I assume that if I need to trade with Uppertrend, I need to see which colour is the last background colour, right? If blue, buy, if yellow, sell. My other doubt, from the basics: Background colour for example in 4H, it forms when D1 candle close? EDIT: on version

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Hi @Swingman, I'm testing version 4.5 because I couldn't download 4.7. There are many differences? I noticed that it doesn't update the wallpaper in time. What do the circled bars mean? Thank you Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #164 ---
This is poorly programmed. I would have to concentrate better to draw the background correctly, and will do that when i have time. However, the signals are correct and one sees the trend. In fact, the background on H4 corresponds to the close for D1-bar. But, this is incorrect because the daily trend can change at any of the six H4 bars! It also took me some time to understand that there was an error. In my charts (#Post 155) you can see arrows at the correct trend changes for D1 on H4, but without an accurate background. There is an MTF indicator for this and it is also being developed.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Okey, so my first trade in demo account, I'm only able to see the easiest part and I will explain why I put this trade on: 1. Alert on H4 comes and said me that put Sell Stop on 0.65249 2. To confirm this trade, I look on this left pannel and said me on H4, that H4 is SELL and D1 is SELL. Attached Image (click to enlarge) 3. To confirm this trade, I go to D1, that confirms that trend is SELL and also W1 is SELL. Attached Image (click to enlarge) So all the trends goes in the same direction. I took the trade on H4 to get more vision. I enter the trade with Sell Stop on 0.65249, Stop Loss on 0.65617 that is the HH of two last bars (for more security i put more distance). TP is calculated with 2:1 with SL. Maybe one option to put SL is on the turning point, that is mark with a rectangle with line inside, the price is 0.65434, also this rectangle acts like Trail Stop to move SL in the sucessive bars. I think that has some risk because of support on H4 but will see how goes, only need to see every 4 hours to check. To check how the trend goes is with with Slope Indicator, but I need to work more with this indicator and LazyHedging Channel to understand how to get more reliable signals and calculate the exit of signal. Please Swingman confirm if I'm wrong in any step, I will apreciate it!

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Please use better color settings and bar charts, no candles. Areas are drawn so that one can quickly see where the initial stop loss is and where the close of the second bar is, for a possible exit at the end of the bar.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Thanks so much for the tip @Swingman! Is it possible to have version 4.7? Thank you

--- 帖子 #168 ---
- In principle, one does not need a trend confirmation from W1. - Study my exit recommendations. RR 2:1 does not fit the system. Check futures, sugar e.g., where RRs are also 10:1. - Signals are good enough, they are generated from raw price action, and not derived indicators. At the very beginning I wrote that one predicts the price at which the two MAs intersect and an entry level is calculated. The other entry signal (the bold arrows) appear at the beginning of the trends, define the upper trend, and bring good profits.

Version 4.7.1 is in #Post 132. Do you want me to understand that you haven't read ALL my posts yet ?

--- 帖子 #171 ---
I've read them all multiple times @Swingman I don't understand why I can't download 4.7...

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Try now

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Thank you very much! Very kind!

--- 帖子 #174 ---
What must you do with this trade: - The ChannelRange (BarRange) at the SignalBar at 16:00 is 189. - The entry level is "CloseForecast - 1/2 BarRange" - From the entry down, the price already surpassed this 189 range on the next bar. - In order to avoid a price reversal with losses, one sets the BreakEven when this range is reached. So that something is left over, one sets BreakEven=EntryPrice-20 points=0.65249-20=0.65249+Spread. (Up to now the BE has not been reached) - Because prices are near the lower Donchian Channel, one should watch carefully if reverse trading in the long direction will take place.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Swingman, I compare TDI with your signals, pretty slow the TDI and fake signals. So, Donchian channels help us to determine a kind of end of trend or reverseal points. Thank you for you system, for your work and help, the most accurate system on FF need more work to study MM and exit, i will work more on this system, promise!

--- 帖子 #176 ---
In #Post 123 I made a suggestion to do a reasonable money management. - Basically, the lots are calculated with the BarRange and 1% Risk (from Balance e.g.). The loss on the Initial SL will be 1-2%, and the gains will also be 4-5%. Important note: one can reduce the initial loss if half the lots are sold when half the loss distance is reached. So only 0.75 of the calculated loss is realised. Same rule in profit for exit at 2xBarRange. Sell half of the lots for a price retrace of 1xBarRange, the rest at 2xBarRange. It would not be bad for you to summarize the rules I mention from time to time. I don't feel like repeating myself, and sometimes I forget to share some things. Please don't post in the thread either. At some point I can ask you to explain my trading rules to me...

--- 帖子 #177 ---
The Exits on two levels (Bar Range = 189 points). See #Post 165 and 174. (280 + 95 points) x (0.5 Lots) = 187 x Lots vis-a-vis initial lots (95 points) x (Lots) = 95 x Lots

--- 帖子 #178 ---
What does the number 280 correspond to? I know that 95 is the half of bar range of channel oscillator. its possible to know in 4h chart with an arrow when exactly trend change on D1? Because of problem MTF indi. and the plotted lines on chart what indicators are? Im on the right way. Thank you and if you feel that im pretty insistent, tell me. Thank you

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Hello! 280 and 95 are the points wins (entry to exit) - the thick green lines. I thought you checked that on your chart... The thick red/blue arrows in the chart are the possible trend changes on D1, and the dashed lines are the MAs for this MTF indicator on D1. The thin solid blue line is the close forecast on D1. This indicator is not ready yet.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Hello, Im preparing a kind of guideline or resume, but, due a lack of time from my baby and my job i can't spent the time that I want to this. Also I think there is nothing more to implement on signals because the predictions work well. Good idea to see on the same chart the MA's of D1 to catch the initial momentum of trend change. - I think that predictions on trend change acts well like Trail Stop when we are in profit on last candle before new cross happens. - It is possible, to make easier, an EA to calculate lotsize with BarRange and % equity? Because if we trade 20 pairs, it's difficult to do fast. If you want to see the guideline or resume SwingMan please tell me, I don't want this thread dies. Regards.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
I will contact you via PM. I also have little time to make all the necessary improvements, if there is anything you will get the programs from me. The thread is long dead because apart from you, none of the more than 100 members who have downloaded existing indicators have posted anything. I am no longer interested in posting for people who trade better systems, or for professionals who can steal and market the idea. So far, one has found indicators from me on various sites, and one can earn good money with this GC.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Dear Mr. @Swingman, How can I pm you?

--- 帖子 #183 ---
In my profile at the top there should be a "Message" menu item. But I see that you can't get any messages either, probably you need more activity in the forum. There are so many interesting topics in the forum that one can also post a lot.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Thanks @Swingman. Here's the reason! If I manage to install the EA I can give you feedback. Because as an indicator I can't download the latest version 4.7.1. on my mt4 I don't know why...

--- 帖子 #185 ---
OK, but please don't think about solving such problems via PM. I haven't programmed an EA yet. If you have already installed an EA in the expert folder, the indicator should be in the indicator folder, then it works.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Why, in your opinion, I can't download the latest version to insert on mt4?

--- 帖子 #187 ---
In which folder do you attach the indicator?

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Indicators folder... but what I don't understand is why I can download some files from this chat and others I can't... Thanks so much amargam!

--- 帖子 #189 ---
maybe the reason is your internet browser, if the problem is to download files from the forum

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Nice trade.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Hi SwingMan, what's the calculation used in predicting the crossing? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Can you share full screen please

--- 帖子 #193 ---
I don't understand what you want to see in fullscreen. Here is the picture with the posted indicator (Signals_v7.1).

--- 帖子 #194 ---
So far no one has posted anything on how possible trades can be made, it means results must be bad, or no one understood what the issue is. When asked how the calculation of the cross closes is done, the answer is simple and everyone should do it to understand what is happening in the chart. Here I post the possible trades for the CJ pair (maybe not all). I know that in the forum there are many other better trading ideas, simpler and more successful, and daily the users report higher and higher profits. That's why no one is interested in the GoldenCross idea. For this reason it makes no sense for me to post further versions of the indicators or the EA. Maybe from time to time I'll post some charts and that's all.

--- 帖子 #195 ---

--- 帖子 #196 ---
I also thank you for your posting, it fits perfectly with a RIP... Many years ago I was playing roulette and a wise man told me: You can post the most successful system ever in a casino on the wall. No one will use it because everyone is too busy watching the ball roll. In my opinion the GoldenCross idea with predicted closes is not the best idea of all, maybe the second best (.!.), but all are very busy following the rolling prices...

--- 帖子 #197 ---
I'm not here in FF much anymore, however I've used many SM indys over the years. This one looks interesting for Daily charts and longer-term trades. Many times, I see 100 pip moves that this could catch. I see there is some background issues but nothing that can't be ignored. I'll demo this on the side for a while, or maybe forward test with 0.01 sizes for kicks. SM thanks for all you've contributed over the years.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
It's true!

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Bonjour, The simplest (not simplistic) solutions are often the best. I suggest testing the Magic-100 method by replacing the MA 100 with the excellent SwingMan indicator. I haven't been able to do it myself yet, currently spending more time taking care of my health, rather than trading. https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/989445-magic-100 Santé, Cheers jf

--- 帖子 #200 ---
I’m testing the idea Swingman presents and I can say it can be profitable with no stress. 4H and Daily trades can catch very huge profit and bad trades can be filter if you trade with the trend, aso with MM. calculation of predict cross can catch the start of trend. only can i say is Swingman do hardwork to improve this and I am very grateful to his work. Here in FF most of all people wants to click one button and do profit with no study and no work.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Where are Stop Loss and Take Profit set in this system?

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Analyze the chart in #Post 194, read back 4-5 pages, and if you still have questions please find a system with TPs levels in another thread, there are enough of them.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
What's funny I never saw this magic 100 thread, but this is how I've traded for years. I call it buy red sell green. I didn't read past the first page and I'm sure there is a bunch of filters added over the years, but I've never needed anything else. . I can see how this would work with SM golden X too as its good for showing trends. I was attracted to the SM x because it seems to get in faster

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Have you seen my indicator for M100? https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...2#post13017972

Thank you for the Link, I will test it out. I've been doing a visual back test on the SMCross and I will forward test this moving foward. I will also test the 100 magic Indy this week. Thank you sir.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Hello SM, Been a while since I posted here on FF and getting back to trading, Been following your contributions and posts especially this one. Started trading in early June this year and it started bit rough then I started getting a grip using this System. I am really grateful for your efforts and all you do here.. I have 2 screenshots of recent trades that I did screenshot, one is a long term trade AU that I have been trailing it manually and closing bits as time goes, hoping to do the same with the other UJ. The 2 trades are active and shows that Long Trades work well here... I do not understand your LazyHedging Channel_Osc completely with a bit of explanation I think I will understand what am looking at. I have been using the GoldenCross and looking at the higher timeframe for further decision after a signal. Your help on above will help alot... TIA SmartKenya

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Hello SmartBoy! I am pleased that you have dealt with the system, and you can also continue to post a few things. In any case, you have qualified as a GoldenBoy and I will send you the latest versions to download. With the Channel_Osc don't worry. It's just a slightly better version of ATR and is used to determine different levels (entry, exit, trailing).

--- 帖子 #208 ---
I normally lurk in the forums and rarely post, but i have to bow my head in respect for what you are doing here. I just read all threads and found your system to have great potential, as i normally trade Market Maker models i can see how this is going to be profitable no doubt. I don't fully integrate myself with the system but i will open a Funded Account to test this system in respect to the great contribution you are making here, also i will donate the money to a charity of your choosing or someone that might need help. I will do daily updates here on the forum so people like me and others who open their eyes to the Diamonds you give for free. As i speak i already bought a Funded Account for this, let me know in PM if we can start this journey. Also what version of the bot should i download now? Also i cant seem to send you a private message here on the forum, dont know why. Thank you in advance and lets give this system a detail backtest and the respect it needs.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
I decided to only PM the latest updates because too many members download indicators just for their collections without making any contributions. I believe that the GC idea has an interesting background and can be successful with a few adjustments. I trade very little and if I don't have any feedback I don't make any new adjustments, corrections and versions. If I find that several GoldenBoys are posting commented trades, I can post a first trading EA version to facilitate manual trading. Full automation can only be used later using tried and tested rules.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Yes i agree, thats why i posted and give respect where respect is needed. I cant send private messages due to : But i can give you my email if still i cant receive messages aswell. I am fully commited to learn and trade this method manually as i have other digital biz and i am im front of the computer from 8 to 18H, checking every 4H the charts is not a problem for me. I am a firm believer in the mantra of "lifting every stone". I will trade the method manually and give daily feedback as needed. Also as i am writing this i am installing the brokerage account for a 25K funded account with 100 leverage, think its good for the method? i am fully commited. Thank you for the fast response.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Bonsoir, Can I also benefit from your latest update please? This is not to increase the catalogue of indicators I post little. My English is very bad. I use an online translator ... A votre santé jf

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Pas plus tard que la semaine dernière, j'ai lu le livre de "Pierre Orphelin", "Les systèmes de trading... et quelques controverses sur l'analyse technique des marchés financiers" en français original. Il a là une idée intéressante et j'aimerais la tester à un moment donné. Je n'ai rien lu en français depuis très longtemps, mais il y a environ 45 ans, j'ai traduit un gros livre du français vers le roumain. Il s'agissait d'un ouvrage technique sur les éléments finis en génie civil. Même si vous êtes un gars sympa, j'ai promis de n'envoyer les dernières versions en MP qu'aux membres qui postent quoi que ce soit. J'utilise aussi google translate sinon je ne pourrais rien poster... Postez ce que vous trouvez intéressant, c'est la seule façon pour moi d'échanger des expériences, sinon je joue et je danse.

Hello Swingman, This is my first post in FF. I have been using GC indicator for awhile and am still trying to figure out whether each signal generated by the indicator is a good entry point depending on the market condition, the PA etc. However, I have made a few profitable trades since I started using the GC indicator together with Cave Manager to manage the trades. For example, today I placed 3 trades and the result was 2 Wins and 1 Loss. I made these trades on MT4 mobile app using another indicator I created in EA builder site to push the signals to my mobile phone as I have a full-time job and checking those signals every 4 hours suits me better. I would appreciate it if you could send me the latest version of GC indicator. Thank you in advance. 2 Wins - NZDUSD &amp; AUDNZD Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) 1 Loss - EURUSD Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I also read Pierre Orphelin, a long time ago. I had even invested in his robot capable of creating equity strategies (CAC 40 etc ...). a kind of AI before its time. No conclusive result. the advantage for me was that he posted on French forums. My tongue. I was just starting. 20 years later I'm still starting! A votre santé jf

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Am glad to receive your response and I will appreciate the latest version. Honestly never used ATR so for now I will avoid Channel_Osc all together. Nice to be a GoldenBoy. Caught a gem with EU earlier today here is my screenshot.. The trade I took after the H4 Alert for a Sell and determined the direction of D1 which had a Sell Alert. Patience is Key and also removing too much complications from your trading mindset!! May PIPS come to you all..... Edit: Posted the wrong image Regards SmartKenya

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Your trade is very good as it goes in the long direction after prices move up from the Donchian channel avay. The blue staircase line is the predicted close for D1 for a Long-GoldenCross, and has also been crossed to the upside by prices.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Perhaps to take into consideration that after the move away from the Donchian-Channel, prices go short towards the blue stair line (forecasted closes on D1), therefore long trades have less chance of being successful.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Here I post (exceptionally) for 7 days the indicators used in my previous charts: https://uploadnow.io/f/LFCGSYN - The trading commands are not yet active in the EA, the layout should still be discussed, and pleas dont use the EA yet. - The GC indicators may still have small errors because I haven't actively traded for a long time and they also ran without updates. - Someone can do a summary of the rules I've posted, then I can add my most recent comments. - If someone suggests a new reasonable rule, one can quickly pick it up, test it and apply it.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
He was your EU trade Short or Long? I took Short and still active..

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Hi SmartKenya, I took a Long position based on the previous 4HR Long entry signal. I might have missed out the Short entry signal on the next 4Hr candle which is my entry candle.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
And did you look at what D1 was doing before taking the position? Also S/R should be your guide while taking some trades, some might be continuation of long term trend or reversal. Regards SmartKenya

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Thank you SwingMan for your kindness. For what i know the rules in a simple way : - Buy or Sell when the emas cross ( major signal Golden Cross) if the Major trend is aligned - Histogram needs to be also aligned - To add positions for trend continuation lazy indicator needs to be giving Green Candles for Upward movement, above the 0 line ( Upward trend momentum) and the reverse for sell - Be careful with signals around the edges of the Dochian Channel, bcs it can mean a trend reversal Also if someone can help me configure the settings, i cant see most things due to colours. Also i pretend to pass the challenge of the live account with this strat. Edit - Found the template of Swingman Charts look better now.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
The best Short-Stop entry was yesterday at 1.30124. Actually, one was able to start the Sell-Stop on 07.18 16:00 at 1.30219. At 07.20 prices are moving away from the lower Donchian-Channel and there is probably a sideways trend. The Short-Stop could have done one on H1 at 07:00.

Thanks Swingman

Thank you for your insight I would have to add the Donchian-Channel seems helpful.. Regards SmartKenya

--- 帖子 #231 ---
So i took a long position on the live funded 25k account as a buy Limit since i couldnt do a buy stop, it was giving me error. - H4 and Daily was long - Signal do buy was a bit earlier but i saw the daily candle not close below the othe one, market wants to go higher, - I was in the middle dochian channel line, so that was a bounce - Take profit at the Top of the Donchian H4 channel. Something i noticed, Why does it appear the stop loss and break even levels and entry on the daily time frame? Does the Ea execute this? Also i am not receiving any alerts, only when i change the assets time frame. Thank you @Swingman and @SmartKenya for the help

--- 帖子 #232 ---
On H4, one is a bit too close to the upper Donchian line, so one can't expect too much gain... ---------------------------------- - I wrote not to load the EA. At the moment there is only a sample of what it can look like. - There is no need to check the TFs separately because the background shows the main trend. - I think alerts only come when an entry level is reached. - SL and BE values and lines come from the two indicators (for TF and Upper TF). - There is no take profit level! Search what I wrote for exits. The BarRange with multipliers =&gt; Level (Initial Stop, BE, Trailing Stop) Sell half of the lots at 1/2 Level, the rest at that Level. This also applies to profits, also to losses!

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Got an Alert for the H4 Crossing BUy on VIX : - The alert was near the top of the H4 Dochian channel, and i would dismiss this until i went to the Daily to see what it was going on. On the Daily, i Saw a cross of the Ema's UP with a slope for the explosion. Correct me if i am doing something wrong.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
If you are receiving alerts then it means it is active... Then again I am using the version 4.7.1 of the signal indicator I haven't tried the EA so the other question I can't answer... SwingMan is in a better place to advice here, he also warned not to use the EA yet! Regards SmartKenya

--- 帖子 #235 ---
I think it's ok. On D1 prices can cross the W1 CloseForecast line in the next 3-4 weeks. If you have the EA in the chart anyway, you can press the "Write Entry" button...

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Elme there is your answer.. SmartKenya

--- 帖子 #237 ---
That's the way it is! Maybe one can send alerts a bit earlier when the predicted close is reached. But one should first gain experience which is better.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Yes, thank your for the fast responses. The system is very good since it takes emotions away from the equation. Here is my take profit level for VIX if it goes there. Since we are operating at a possible reverse for buy, if i want to pyramid all the way up, should i follow the signals for buys? Here is where i put my take profit on VIX Closed my AUS200 trade in small profit since it was closer to the Channel on H4 and daily. p.S: if we only take trades on the opposites of the Dochian Channel with the Trend aligned or a bounce in the middle i think we can make massive profits.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
You are welcome... I am still getting a grip of the whole system and am stuck with only 1 indicator the smGoldenCross Signal v4.7.1 with that only and what I understand about the market everything else is simple and as clear as the day. I learnt that if it works don't try fixing it.. For now GoldenCross is working and working well. My target is from 500$ - 1000$ then move to the Funded Account. The more I look at the charts I find golden hidden eggs popping everywhere. I think about TP and SL that should each persons discretion but for me once I enter my TP is 2x SL and my SL is on the Last HH or LL the TP will be double that and this works very well, once am in profit I start taking bits from the trade and trail my SL. Let's keep building Regards SmartKenya

--- 帖子 #240 ---
I was looking at VIX and now the Trend is aligned for short, wich doesn't indicate the same thing on the Daily wich is doing a cross up near the bottom of the channel. I am still confused about the rectangles and the arrows. Also the Lazy oscillator needs to be aligned with our entry correct?

--- 帖子 #241 ---
That's the way it is! For this reason, one should not place fixed TPs and use a trailing stop when winning. TrailingStop = 2xBarRange, selling 1/2 lots at 1 BR, and the rest at 2 BR. If an opposing signal comes, close everything at the next bar. Areas are drawn as an aid for this. The areas between entry and exit are not very long, so pyramiding is a bit more difficult to do. One wins enough with the simple procedure...

--- 帖子 #242 ---
For those asking about my setup, I use the D1-H4-H1 and H4 is my main trading screen. Alerts are only set on D1 and H4 with H1 I do not need alert from it as it only serves as distraction for me. I also recommend anyone to turn off alerts on the lower TF as these are not your trading main screen. Create profile for your setup for your favorite pairs and that's it. You could also use the color MTF on the indicator that shows the Higher TF. Hope this helps someone Regards SmartKenya

--- 帖子 #243 ---
No. The histogram colors in oscillator are from another system and i haven't changed them anymore, maybe one can use them. I think it's "Dave Landry's Swing Trading"(or another...).

--- 帖子 #244 ---
OK so i think this might be a loss its floating at the middle of the Stop loss, i will let it run. I will deactivate the alerts bcs we need to filter fake signals. SmartKenya can you post your template? Seem less crowded Also how do you saved inawy that everytime you open pair, it opens the 3 screens? Thank you in advance

--- 帖子 #245 ---
That's good. But try to use and interpret the indicators Signals_v4.10 and MTF_v4.0. Version 4.7.1 draws the background at the end of the week. Version 4.10 also does this within the week, and that's an advantage (these are the vertical arrows in the chart). You can also check if the programming is correct... Actually, the interpretation of the crossings within the week (for D1) or within the day (for H4) is a bit more difficult, and I don't have a final interpretation of what would be correct.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
I have 3 TF of each pair that are my favorites.. Find Attached the TPL and Profile Regards SmartKenya

Will setup on a different PC. Regards SmartKenya

Hello, Can someone please link the indicators I am so confused with the charts, also please explain the rules for the system Thanks for the help.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Some interesting fact, MT4 won't load 3 screens in the profile i made. Could it be it consumes a lot of memory? They are all packed with indicators. If i was looking at Vix now i wouldn't made a buy, although the trend was saying Long / Long. My question is, who times our entries better for less drawdown?

--- 帖子 #250 ---
The best thing is to read the entire thread, and even if it takes a little longer you'll understand what it's about (or not). I think you didn't read anything at all because a few postings earlier I posted the indicators, also a template etc. In this case I recommend you to look for a simpler system here in the forum. This system is actually not easy, and without investing time in studying alone, there is no point in having other members work for you.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
I am using MT4 on Macbook Pro an older version yes it hangs sometimes but works without issues. It actually hangs when it reconnects. Running 5 pairs x3 2 indicators only.. But really if you doing a single pair just load the 3 important TF only.. Regards SmartKenya

--- 帖子 #252 ---
By the way who are you using as your Funded Broker? TIA SmartKenya

--- 帖子 #253 ---
I bought a funded Account of 25K to test this method, in respect to Swingman. It was the least i could do,if this method works ill have a funded 25k account to trade it. I still have some questions regarding the method, the simple methodology would be to buy or sell near the extremes our bounces from the Middle point. There is a small Arrow that appears in the chart...is this some valid entry point? Also we are suppose the follow the entries on the big Arrows? Ill give an example of my floating trade.... Gave me a Sell Arrow Signal on the H4, and is still giving me Buy alerts for cross. I looked on the Daily and its clearly going for a cross UP

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Hey SwingMan, Set and ready to go!! All seem good!! Regards SmartKenya

--- 帖子 #255 ---
At this time my trade is still in Loss, i will let it run. I was configuring my 3 screen setups without the EA and found this one, is this a legit sell? I entered with a pending Sell stop on H4, seems a good reversal signal.

Had 2 trades closed in green. Long AJ Attached Image (click to enlarge) Long EJ Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #257 ---
I have 2 trades floating in loss, if they both hit the stop loss ill stop and trade demo this system, wich indicates i am clearly not doing it proper way

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Personally I would avoid the sell as D1 still is looking strong on the up move... My best entries so far I found is when D1 is either on the trend already towards the direction you want or it is at the turning point... But remember entering the market is the easiest getting out is where most fail.... Regards SmartKenya Don't give up so easily my friend. Ever heard of the 3 duck system? a quick overview... Say we are doing the D1 ( duck 1 ), H4 ( duck 2 ), H1 ( duck 3 ). Duck 1 is your overall direction, Duck 2 is your trading signal, Duck 3 find your entry if not using Limits or Stops. All these ducks should be going in the same direction you do not want one especially Duck 1 running in the opposite direction. With that in mind you can still skim part of the market with right entry when they are not all aligned but as the rule of this system try to watch the overall trend of your upper timeframe. P.S. Always Demo any System and Strategy.. May the pips come to you!! Regards SmartKenya

--- 帖子 #259 ---
i am using ema 5, 14 &amp; 21 cross over for stong buy &amp; sell. Along with 50,100,200 for support &amp; resistance. This gives me great profit (from mobile trading)

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Yeah 1% of the account lost, i want to see the method clearly before going live with it. I am probably doing it wrong. Can still Demo though

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Variant to test for "smGoldenCross TrendMTF_4.0" I found that the color changes for the MTF indicator within the upper timeframe are difficult to interpret. - If you want to test and comment on a possible variant, you should set the inputs: "BackgroundColor_Long and BackgroundColor_Short" to "None". - At the same time, one should use the indicator "smGoldenCross Signals_v4.7.1" instead of "...v4.10". If one finds this variant easier to interpret, I can program two new indicators. - In "Properties" click on "Show object descriptions" to see the text for the help lines.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Swing man sir,can you make a retracement and pullback arrow with the rules mentioned below? thanks

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Thanks for the idea, because it's good for pyramiding, as well as a few other candlestick patterns. But for me it is too early to add additional arrows to the GC charts now. Also one can consider them at any bounce from the Donchian-Channels when a GC-Signal is present.

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Hey SwingMan, These border zones the Yellow and Blue are important for visual and confirmation purposes. If trading H4 which is what I always advocate for the zones will show what D1 is and has been doing in terms of trend and as for the programming signal maybe just maybe indicate the direction of the higher TF for those who sometimes fail to see the colors as it acts as a guide. Sometime I ignore the higher TF colors depending on what I see from my triple screen for the important TF D1,H4 and H1 but this should only be fore seasoned traders or those who understand Price Action and SR zones. Best is of this system is to keep it simple and not overthink. Regards SmartKenya

--- 帖子 #265 ---
It's good to read my older posts because sometimes I say interesting things... The Upper TimeFrames should be considered dual! - In an established long trend on D1, counter trades can be taken in the short direction when prices bounce off the upper Donchian-Channel. The chances that resistance levels have been reached are high. - In the middle of the channel one should of course make long trades. - This duality of chances makes me think that one should make a ranking of the Donchian-Channel width, because one actually has more room for successful trades with wider channels.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
This is actually a problem for smart guys who also think for a system, not just use it! The MTF indicator changes colors when prices cross the forecasted close on D1, and that close is at the end of the day! However, the crossing can also take place within the day, even several times, and that brings a little confusion of colors. If anyone has an opinion at all, I will adjust the colors in the indicators. However, the signals, arrows and calculated levels in the MTF indicator remain unchanged. Further, in a future EA, one must determine how to interpret these signals.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
I checked, this indicator is repainted

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Of course, it does, but try and understand the method that Swingman is setting out here, before you try and understand the indicator and branding it as repainting. There are six 4-hour bars in a day, and you are looking for an anticipated crossover of the 4 hourly LWMA with reference to the Daily 5LWMA crossover. The market is volatile and doesn’t always move in one direction, as I’m sure you are aware, so you will have a signal that disappear (What you call repainting) as soon as the market move in the opposite direction, this normally happens when the market is consolidating / ranging or data is released. Bottom line, get to the point where you understand the method, you won’t regret it. The “repainting” you referring to is exactly what Swingman is addressing in post #266, solve this conundrum and you will be well on your way. @Swingman the best I’ve been able to come up with so far is, when you get “repainting”, I would rather call it zig-zagging, because you get a long signal, that reverses become a short signal and then reverses back to long, (it can continue for longer than 3 reversals) or vice versa, is to look for sideways movement by using the slope indicator you’ve posted, and then leave that pair alone until there is a confirmed crossover (Not anticipated cross) of the 5LWMA on the daily chart, that normally gives you a new trend indication. I understand this is not something you can put into an EA but requires one to be in front of your charts. So to summarize, as soon as I get a 2 losses in a row, one short, one long or vice versa , I leave the pair alone if I see consolidation on the Slope Indicator ,and wait for a confirmed crossover on the Daily 5LWMA. This will obviously leave you with a 2% loss, but no more. The third trade can obviously go in your direction and wipe out the loss, but it can also compound the loss. I don't have enough stats as yet to see whether this approach is feasible or not. Time will tell.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
When I used to code I fell into the same issues especially when talking about MTF indicators. I would rather have a signal at the close of the D1 candle which gives more room to focus on the pair you are watching.. The changing of colors is inevitable if the indicator works with tick but with close atleast you will get changes at the close of the candle. I like your way of thinking and the little nitty gritty of your thought processing you give here. One just need to go back and reread connect and understand! Regards SmartKenya

--- 帖子 #270 ---
@Dzt and @SmartKenya , I am very pleased that at least two members understood and can interpret the idea of the GoldenCross. Even if I have no problem explaining the details of this idea, like a preacher in the desert: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I have more youthful enthusiasm to continue programming what is necessary! Congratulations!

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Hey friends, Just here to give you updates. For those trying GC on lower timeframes make sure you do not let your trades roll over to the next day. Make sure your stops are tight, the market has been quite unpredictable and we have been having serious spikes all around.. Suddenly FX almost feels like crypto. Try to use Buy/Sell Stops and Limits if you can, avoid Market Orders your life will be better. Sometimes you might feel your trading TF is late with the signal ... That's why we are adviced to use the 3 TF with the mid TF being your trading TF Upper is confirmation of overall trend lower use it to find entries . I have been having successful small Profits and can confidently confirm the system works if only you stop over-complicating things. If you can just watch the smGoldenCross Signal indicator and remove everything else. Just use that for a week or two you will easily realize a pattern. Once you get the hang of it add the recommended indicators available here and stand its correlation with Signal Indicator and how to use them in your favor. For those trading Higher TF.. H4 and above congratulations are in order. Make sure your SL is in your favor and give you space to hold your trades. Watch Price Action as always. Remember: It is very easy to enter a trade.... Getting out is where many traders fail.. Regards SmartKenya

HI Swingman, Could you please share source file for the smGoldenCross Slope_v2.1. Thanks in advance.

Hell Friends, On the 3rd of August 2023 at 22:09 on OANDA I took a LONG Position (2.09277) using BUY LIMIT as I was slightly late for the trade but knew the price will come back to me which it did. Here is the chart Reason I took the trade even if the market still was in consolidation the Previous HAMMER CANDLE on H4 showed alot of strength from the buyers and D1,W1,MN1 are all screaming LONG , the overall trend is BULLISH . With that in mind I was not worried even when the market went against me ( 2.08361 ) as I had mentioned above Higher TF gives you confidence which is what you need as a trader. I had my SL at the lowest of this consolidation channel ( 2.03256 ) and the channel has now been broken and the price is BULLISH. Remember I mentioned to enter the trade is quite easy. Learn MM to know when to get out. Regards SmartKenya

Hello dear SwingMan! I wanted to ask you to add an alert with a notification for this indicator, the alert is needed for the arrows. If you don’t have time for this, then be so kind as to share the source code so that I can add these functions myself. Thank you!

--- 帖子 #278 ---
It would be nice to have a minimum of feedback, otherwise #Post 77 applies. (You probably used the indicator somehow, otherwise you don't need alerts.)

Hi binary guys, Many years ago I was also involved in binary options trading, but it was too tiring for me to trade during the day and I then neglected it. If you would like to discuss it here, please do so, maybe I'll come up with some ideas too.

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Personally, I have never Traded Binary Options mainly because many years ago when I first came across this method the industry was riddled with scam brokers where one had to jump through hoops in order to get a pay out &amp; there were many hidden rules in the fine print which you had to adhere to. Seems times have changed &amp; it's not to say I wouldn't take a shot at it. As I mentioned above I have a Trading associate who does quite well with it &amp; he has shown me his consistent sizable withdrawals. The way I look at it if anyone has any longevity in the market &amp; has learned price action such as high probability candle stick patterns at key levels we all know it's a higher probability to predict a shorter move in price as to say a prediction in price hours or days away. So with the option to take positions with Binary Options with an expiry time as low as 30 seconds or less, to only know if the price will be higher or lower in that span of time I am more confident that this is doable. The Returns paid out are quite good. However in any type of Trading method/system in order to be profitable Money Management is Key! G

Golden-Cross Scalping Trading-Idea @Erebus Glad you took the time to read the thread and found some things interesting! There was previously a discussion about binary options. For you and others, I would recommend postponing dealing with it until later. Because you are a little younger than me, can you please do a little evaluation for several pairs? Here are two examples of how to use GoldenCross signals in scalping. Rules for LONG: - Upper trend is long, only trade stop-buy signals - Open must be below the predicted cross price - Take profit is the calculated long entry Rules for SHORT: - Upper trend is short, only trade Stop-Sell signals - Open must be above the predicted cross price - Take profit is the calculated short entry - One can take 1% of Balance for TP and 2% of Balance for SL. - Trading time frame only H4 - Attention : in the area where the upper trend changes (6 bars) one should ignore the signals if one does not know what to do. According to my evaluations, the result is good and I will adjust the indicators for Scalping. An EA is easy to program for these rules.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Especially as this poster can't even be bothered to say 'please'.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
24-hours ago, I just saw this now, yes, I never traded Binary and have no desire to do so, just too scamish for me. I will have to download your indicators and see if I can understand what they are telling me. I did work this EMA Dashboard, the Golden Cross must have been working subconsciously in my brain. Maybe it will help with checking your trend bias, or maybe I will make them LWMA also. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #294 ---
SwingMan, you will have to school me on the indicators and define the rules for me: Rules for LONG: - Upper trend i s long, only trade stop-buy signals - Open must be below the predicted cross price - Take profit is the calculated long entry What is Upper Trend? I see that I am missing an outer line, I used default indicator settings, is there more to know? Open, what open? Of the 4-Hour candles, I'm guessing. Predicted cross price, where to see or know that please. Look at this chart, it looks a mess to me, actually the whole market just feels a mess to me, I have not taken even 1 trade yet this week, cheers. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #295 ---
I thought you had time to read the thread from the beginning, unfortunately you missed my explanations. That doesn't matter, there are many more interesting and successful ideas. The prediction of crossing points is something new for me too, and one should think about it in order to use it advantageously. The trading idea should be studied and not just noted. I have now browsed back and see that I have answered some questions in postings 1, 10, 20, 21, 23, 27. In #Post 31 I wrote about the UpperTrend and posted two charts as an explanation. ---------------------------------------------- - UpperTrend is the trend of the upper timeframe (D1 for H4, W1 for D1) - Open is open of the bars in the current TimeFrame - I calculate the predicted cross price mathematically and recommend that everyone do the same. For the first exercise it is easier to start with SMA, then try with LWMA. In the charts, the forecast cross prices are the small green rectangles, and the stair-shaped blue line is calculated for the upper time frame.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
In the chart you posted you can see the following: - Signals 1, 3 and 4 correspond to the crossing of the price with the forecast value in the UpperTimeFrame. When one start using the GoldenCross trading idea, one may want to ignore these signals. - Signal 2 has the open below the predicted cross price and does not comply with the trading rules. But if one is sitting at the screen, one can place a sell market order. - Signal 5 is ok. The UpperTrend is Short (light color in the background), open is above the CrossPrice. With a sell stop the price reaches the red arrow = profit.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Hi Swingman Thanks for the indicator the back ground colour keep changing in lower timeframe(1 hour). I believe the background colour represents higher timeframe may I know which timeframe?

--- 帖子 #298 ---
The UpperTimeFrame can be easily identified with the “TrendMTF” indicator. Here in the chart, each staircase on the blue line corresponds to an interval in the UpperTimeFrame. H4 for H1, D1 for H4 etc. With the mouse you can read the values “CForecast-UPTF” from the CrossForecast-UpperTimeFrame.

Hello, Thanks for sharing this system SM! I didn't read all the pages, but the first 5 I studied. More work to do. But I get stuck already now. Maybe someone can help me out. In the picture below I see I need to only trade short as the background is brownish as the higher TF is bearish. In the histo I see a red candle so all seems to be ready for a sell. But....... how do I use the displayed number at the top-right side of de current candle? For a sell an entry should be at the other side of the candle, or is it the spot to put a limit order? Same counts for the tiny green rectangle above the last candle. I understand this one signals a possible turn and could be seen as I spot to put a SL, am I right? Thanks in advance, Ben Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hi young man, I'm glad you took some time to read the thread! Try to find a way to interpret the idea of close forecasting on your own. I already have a lot more to say, but if no one is interested in the idea, it's not worth it for me to invest the time to give explanations. If I feel like it, I will post some more indicators and trading ideas. At the moment there are still some uncertainties in the charts, but I don't feel like correcting the indicators now... ------------------------ - The small green dots are the predicted prices at which a cross of the two 5-GDs can take place. Of course, a trend reversal can take place if the price movement continues on this candle. - The brown rectangles are possible "Stop" entry prices. For TP and SL one can also take own values into account.

Hello, I know the stories of Baba Vanga, and she was one of the best modern predictors, like Nostradamus... In this sense, as Baba Yaga you could perhaps predict the future and make it useful in trading, even without a Golden-Cross... "Baba Vanga was a blind Bulgarian woman with a gift of foresight. The eminent clairvoyant is renowned for several of her historical prophecies that came to pass." ----------------- In the posted chart you can also see the stop entry values at the crossings, which is very useful. I have marked some of the signals, but I also want to take some rules into account for the filtering.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
I believe that the signals can also be useful in the M1 timeframe.

Interesting approach! I trade something close to this but over 1h and in confluence with 4h and D1 less trades but with much higher R/R when trades pan out. I will give this a go. Thank you, SM https://charts.mql5.com/38/662/us100...e-m-global.png

Hi SwingMan, Currently looking at the EG H1. Background is bearish, but in H4 and D1 both backgrounds are bullish... ??? When in 2 higher TFs the backgrounds are bullish, shouldn't the lower TF be bullish as well........??? I mean, the background's direction refers to the direction of a higher TF....isn't it? Thanks, Ben

--- 帖子 #313 ---
- Trend is defined as the position of the GD-Close relative to the GD-Open There is no correlation between trends in different time frames. I think there was a small inconsistency with me when taking into account the "UTF = Upper Time Frames". Maybe the next version will be better.

Hi @kiennt , It is fine you find the Golden-Cross idea useful! I would just like to ask you not to just post chart excerpts. Try with Without the data on TF, times and prices it is not possible to analyze anything. You can try also this new indicator:

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Hi SG and thank you for the new trading idea! I like the concept for predicting the cross price and I will dive deep into this until I can trade it with confidence. I've read the thread and I think I understand the concept, but could you please summarize what each element of the diagram means? I can see that the indicators have evolved during development and I think a legend would help newcomers better understand the chat and indie functionality. Thank you very much! Legend: - The small green dots are the predicted prices at which a cross of the two 5-GDs can take place. - The brown rectangles are possible "Stop" entry prices. (cant find it on these two charts) - Trend is defined as the position of the GD-Close relative to the GD-Open - UpperTrend is the trend of the upper timeframe (D1 for H4, W1 for D1) as a background color. - Open is open of the bars in the current TimeFrame - I calculate the predicted cross price mathematically In the charts, the forecast cross prices are the small green rectangles, and the stair-shaped blue line is calculated for the upper time frame. Is this correct? Whats do these 4 elements mean? I think that the bigger arrows are drown when the price crosses the upper trend blue line, right? But what is the mean of smaller arrows and is their position important? I see one green circle and many green rectangles, right? And I see 4 bigger circles, what do they tell us? Thank you for your time and support!

--- 帖子 #342 ---
You are right, your analysis is correct! The bigger arrows show the crossing of the price with the upper trend, and the smaller horizontal arrows on the same bar show the calculated entry level. One can take these signals into account, but I have not done so. Check this with two time frame charts, and for your chart you can see the signals here. Because there are some problems with the evaluation of the signals in the upper time frames, it is better to trade these TFs separately. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Unfortunately, I have a habit of making everything more complicated, and then investing a lot of time in analyses to simplify everything... The larger circles are the calculated entry levels when a crossing of the 5 (O/C) moving averages has taken place. If not, then only the brown rectangles remain, and by moving the circles one can see that they lie on top of each other.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
There are a few more details for trading that I may introduce later. Interesting to study in the thread "Trading Made Simple" are the charts posted by @emmanuel with very useful recommendations regarding the "TMS 5er Method". In this chart I draw an "LWMA-5, Median, Shift 1". Because the requirements are almost identical, you can compare the signals. The difference is that with the Golden Cross you get calculated values for crossing and entry in advance.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Hi SG Thank you very much for your explanation! I am still studying the indy and want to see your progress in development, so please forgive me if this has been fixed in the newer versions but for now I am not quite sure I completely understand it, so please let me ask you to check these two screenshots. - Why there are two dots - red and green on the last bar? I noticed this to happen from time to time. - Do you consider spread ? Please check the screenshot for the short signal. Maybe it's a good idea to have a spread into account or I still have a lot to learn. - Would you please try one more time to explain (to me) the mean of the parameter "Offset_forCrossing=10"? - I noticed several times the background color doesn't change when the info panel changes. For example, it is up trend background with uptrend in the panel for upper TF, then suddenly the panel says down for the upper TF while the background remains the same up-color. Then the panel returns to the uptrend again or, if the upper TF bars ends, the background color changes. I am sorry for my broken English but I just wanted to make you aware that I notices for a very short period of time a difference between the background color and info panel trends. I believe it is because you change the bg color at new bar, maybe, while in the panels it is ontick(). Thank you very much for the time. I am looking at the chart trying to find a way to implement your ideas Regards

Thank you for explanation. What is the bold line with the red dot for SL on it? MA in Color, I guess, right? One more stupid question - how to make smGoldenCross TrendMTF draw 3 lines? Mine draws only the middle blue one. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #347 ---
I have just checked the H4 chart with 4 trades I should be made if I was using the Golden Cross idea the way I understand it and I see 3 red arrows and one blue. Would i be in profit at 2:1 RR? It ALL depends on the exits, I think. What do you think? 1st and 2nd red arrows as entry would be hit by a SL at the time of the red down arrow. 3rd could a win or a loss depending on the TP and SL and 4th is a big win, if you keep trailing TP the right way. I have a lot more to learn on when to enter and exit so any advice is welcome! Thanks!

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Should I BUY at this point by following the BUY signal and hoping that the price will increase because of the bull up trend or should I expect a reversal when the small rectangle below the MA was crossed? Please explain it one more time for me. THANK YOU!

--- 帖子 #349 ---
- I will revise the indicator "Signals_v5.1" because I see that it is unclear how and why the green rectangles predict the price for a crossover: If the red MA-close is above the green MA-open, a crossover can ONLY take place below the MA-open, i.e. there is a stop sell on the right side! I think these rectangles should be red for sell, and the others above the MA-open should be green. - Please ignore the indicator with signals on D1 in the H4 chart(Trend MTF). I have found that it is better to trade only one timeframe - The thick blue/red line is "Trend v2.2" with period 30. (6 H4 bars per day * 5 days = 1 week = 30 bars) As a small note, the colors of the lines are not always correct and I have to rework the indicator. The thicker circles: the MAs are calculated for the period 30, and the MAs cross each other in the circles. - Please be sure to take the Donchian Channel into account. Later I will perhaps explain why this is very important, or one can find it by oneself... - If the info panel is displayed, please ignore it. It is only a preliminary display. - The color change of the background related to the upper trend can be confusing. For the 6 bars of a week, the trend can be long for the first 3 days, and short at the end of the week. But, if you only see the chart at the end of the week, you will only see the background for short. I think I need to define the trend based solely on the slope of the thick line and for that I will have to program a new indicator.

Hi swingman, Have you tried RMA MAs? Bank Indicator | Page 93 | Forex Factory sincerely Have a good day jf

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Thanks for the tip! I tested the indicator briefly, and for the existing period 13, the trading signals come later than with GoldenCross. The arrows are placed after the candle crosses the MA, and the cross with GC is predicted and then confirmed.

Hi SG First of all THANK YOU for your support! Yeah, that's what I thought all along, but I'm a bit confused by the comment in Post #74 e.g. "The entries are calculated from the predicted close. For example, for the long direction, half the value from the channel oscillator is taken as the offset from predicted Close to Entry,, and one can give as order the calculated entry as a Buy-Stop." - why did you say BUY STOP? The chart is identical to what I posted - long trend, and green rectangle below the MAs One more thing - I've seen the price cross the brown rectangle several times in a row during the formation of this current bar and have received several BUY alerts (should they be selli?) BUT...nothing is certain until the bar closes, right? Everyone here and there says we should only work with closed bars and ignore current one in progress. If there was a pending STOP order at the price of the brown rectangle, it would be filled, but the cross could not actually happen. Is this part of the game? Ok. Draw_GoldenCrossArrows=false Thanks. A link is appreciated. Thank you for this suggestion and the link! Sure! Yeah, I noticed it. Can you calculate and change the color on current TF bar close? I think there was a version like that and it was confusing...Or maybe a Mini trend indicator could help. Thank you very much again for your time and support!

--- 帖子 #354 ---
- In post #74 I explained in general terms, and not in relation to the chart posted - The indicator Trend 2.2 is the first in the files list (paper clip top right) - In every trend, for example, the forecast cross price is reached first, and one calculates a stop entry. Everyone can check whether waiting for the bar close is advantageous or not, and trade accordingly. On waiting one ignores the advantage of the GoldenCross idea, and one should trade another system as quickly as possible... From time to time I have compared the crossings of the "TMS 5_er" with GC, and wrote somewhere that the signals are often identical, only that GC provides useful entry values. Very often, entries are more advantageous for GC. (If you enjoy it, you can set the MA to Simple in "Signals_v5.1" and test the values numerically) - The background color is a visual aid for the direction in which you are allowed to trade (permitted direction). (There is a single exception when one of the maximum 6 bars hits the Donchian Channel.) Actually, I have to change the algorithm for the background color and draw it synchronously with the color of the thick line "Trend(30)". I explained the reason for this in a previous post. - You can use the "Slope" indicator as a "Mini Trend indicator". Here I am posting the "Slope_v_2.1" I am also posting a new version "3.0" for the "ChannelOscillator"

--- 帖子 #355 ---
I am not quite sure how to use the "Slope" indicator as a "Mini Trend indicator". Can you help me? I cant find Signals_v5.1 so I use Signals_v5.0 instead. What's the difference?

--- 帖子 #356 ---
In the slope indicator there are histograms with strong and weak colors for the direction, as well as the cross signals. Everyone should interpret it for themselves. Attached File(s) smGoldenCross Signals_v5.1.ex4 70 KB | 429 downloads

Can you please tell me more about this idea? 1. Wait for a new bar. 2. See Open is above the CrossPrice. 3. Place STOP SELL with the value from the brown rectangle. 4.

New indicator "smGoldenCross Stochastic_v1" In the thread "Finding the Trend" there is an idea how one can quickly evaluate visuall several pairs. Here is an indicator based on the stochastic. The period 30 was chosen because 30 bars in timeframe H4 corresponds to a week. The Dochian Channel also has the period 30, so the value of the stochastic corresponds to the position of the stochastic main line in the Donchian Channel. Note: when a bar reaches the upper or lower DC, one should always take the reverse trend signal for the first 6 bars after that.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
In my humble opinion Even if you scalp for a few pips per trade You still need to keep an eye on the Big Picture ?

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Colors not easy on the eye hard to see finer detail

--- 帖子 #392 ---
In the near future I will make the changes for the text color. --------------------------- It is not necessary to look far back in time. The SmallWick idea relates to scalping on limited trend sequences. For trends from 6-8 bars there are about 66% bars with the same color, and of these about 66% are SW bars. It is good to identify the existing trend on D1 or W1 in order to then scalp on H4 to possibly M15. The slope indicator should be used to identify when the histograms have a full color (permission condition). With 5/1 you sometimes have an earlier condition, and with 5/2 sometimes one or two later conditions are met. It is essential to draw the Dochian channel. Good reverse trades arise when leaving the external lines. I will take this into account in the next version of the SW indicator. If you need that, you can draw some lines within the channel.

Well you are the Boss Excellent summary of the method Appreciated Dave ps Will still find it hard to let go of my grid But take your point

Me too! I think your second picture is OK now, you still need to add the Donchian Channel.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Like This ?

--- 帖子 #397 ---
It's very good like this (for me...). The only thing I'm missing is the background color in the main chart, which would be a visual aid. For the slope, you can experiment with 5/1 and 5/2 and see what you like better. Just one request: maybe you can give some suggestions on how to use the intermediate lines in Donchian Channel. My only idea is to make long trades above the median line and short trades below it.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Yes, I enjoyed programming new and interesting things. We will see whether they were or still are useful, or whether what I am programming now will continue to be used.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Test it on MT4.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
You can see that I don't trade the DC, it is used to mark the probable turning point in the trend. I've also studied a successful DC system in the last few days, but it's not what interests me. The DC is very good for pyramiding, for example, if the bars run along rising or falling external lines. I also thought about adjusting the period to the timeframes, and for example took 25 for D1 (approx. 1 month). But I think it is better to keep the 30 (H4/W1), because then the eye is also adjusted to the trends. Then we'd have about 1 month for D1, about 1 day for H1, about half a day for M15. The stochastic indicator with the same periods shows very nicely visually when you're in the extreme ranges, and it would be uneconomical to switch the periods when the timeframe changes. (It would also be possible to do this automatically in the programmed indicator).

--- 帖子 #401 ---
That's good and you should stick with it. The SmallWick idea is a scalping idea and it's easier to keep your proven strategy and scalping testing separate. Your charts confuse me because the few ideas I have for SW are completely lost in the hundreds of bars in the chart. When I post later how I see money management, what the TP2 is useful for etc. it is better to have a smaller number of bars. I would also say that previous cycles, even if they are clear and obvious, trades are affected by the local "Slope permission condition". I posted the SW idea because you mentioned an idea with percentages from the open. In my opinion, one can see that statistically better results can be achieved from the high or low. If one have time, one can try combining the GC and SW ideas with the "Milliped" method.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Your ideas and Indicators are very good and I find them extremely helpful and a really great add on for my style of trading They let me see an early entry in my chosen Trade direction either I can just play the Targets that the Wick signals give or form an opinion if its a pull back. continuation or even the start of a new trend, hence run them ps I will have a look at the Milliped as you suggest pps Deleted my last posts as they just might be a little off topic of the thread thank you

Swingman, well done! Love scalping with this. It's interesting to me how the same result can be arrived at from different indicators. e.g., "smGolden Cross Slope_v1.2" vs. "SwingMan UltraSuperTrix_PV_4col" (which I got off the "MTF Trix System", and yes, I was around then when I think you first posted that gem, thank you very much! lol.) I suspect the newer came out of the older? (Forgive the Blue arrows; they're a system I've been working on and forgot to take them off before taking the screenshot.) Attached Image (click to enlarge) And thanks for the "smGolden Cross Stochastic_v1". Very nice way to display the crossing of the signal line without having to bring up the Data Window (Ctrl+D) and try to figure it out. Genius.

Update Thanks Swingman

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Can you please at least post some trades now and then? I can't see when and how a trade was made in the bare charts.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Swingman Off to my Walking Football session in 30min time and Red News latter, early afternoon will be earlist I can perhaps take a trade But at the moment I can see conflict with the Stocastics on different Timeframes Which would be a no go to taking a trade for me at the moment ( like to see them all line up, telling me the same story ) ps Following the rules from your Post 1 reguards Timeframes

Swingman Sorry no help tpday due tp other things Your indicators have been flashing Buys Signals But with Daily ADR now 222 and we are above MY Open by 188 cannot be interested now and just accept I have missed the train the combination of Daily 4Hr 1Hr gives a good picture of The Buy Signals

I follow the possible scalping trades with the SmallWick signals every day. As of Monday, there were several options on H4, as you can see in the chart. You should filter the signals by taking the bold histograms into account in the slope indicator. Look at everything carefully At this point, I still have to add an additional function to the slope indicator, which should make the signals even more reliable. We'll see.

Thanks Just slightly off topic I have noticed you did a mod on Bill Williams Alligator I Have been watching his Market Facilitation Index perform on live charts and I must say it as some merit Have you ever looked into it ?

Example Added a 100 pip Grid ps Just deleted Donchian for a clearer view

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Cannot work without a Grid of some sort on my charts ?

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Without a grid of some sort How can we decide if to take this Buy Signal We have a Range of 268 Average Range being 204 we are 152 pips above MY Open

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Excellent idea Swingman

--- 帖子 #419 ---
This is nice. Thank you. It's especially useful when the Stoch starts to flatline at the top or bottom and when viewing a regular Stoch, you have to try and discern the values, which are sometimes covered up by the lines themselves.

Here is a scalp trade I took yesterday. After price ran up to the Supply zone around 144.91, I tried to move my Stop up right under the low of the candle that entered the zone but price moved so quickly, I got a little slippage. (And please forgive the multiple indicators; I sometimes throw many on to see how they react in relation to each other):

Swingman, not sure if anyone else if getting this with your "smTMMS Oscillator_v7.3.1", but I'm getting additional artifacts when I leave the chart running for a while but after changing the timeframe and switching it back, it looks good again for another while:

--- 帖子 #191 ---
hi, Sir SwingMan, i am new here and try to read your post from begining and want to ask if my understanding regarding your indicator is correct? my entry and tp in is the image 1. background red = short 2. orange rectangle occur 3. down arrow at slope indicator 4. stoc cross over lv80

--- 帖子 #192 ---
If it helps you, it's great that you're using the ancient "UltraSuperTRIX" indicator!

--- 帖子 #193 ---
1, 2 = ok 3 = if you use bar charts, you can see better the predicted cross points and the calculated (suggested) entry point very clearly. There are hardly any indicators that do this. 4 = the orange and blue rectangles appear after a cross, and the close of the last bar is the recommended exit if one has not been done before. - Because the "Stochastic" with the large period 30 is not an over/under trend, values such as 80/20 or 90/10 should not necessarily be taken into account. The color change of the histograms should be sufficient for a change in trend direction. - You should draw the important Donchian Channel and also think about how the bounce of the prices can best be used.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
It's definitely an oldie but a goodie, though I see your "smGoldenCross Slope_v2.1" has a more smoothed flow and I can't decide if that's taking some information away or keeping me from making bad decisions! Lol.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Got into this trade right before leaving for work. (Was a little miffed at missing the trade at 17:23 and felt that I had to take something from the market before leaving to my regular job. Guess it was lucky Friday for me.)

Today: Gold M30! It couldn't be easier. Thanks Swing Man. (The only thing missing is an EA!)

Good evening SWING Man. I wanted to tell you that I am doing well with your GC. I'm sorry the thread has ended. I am sure that everyone, including me, would have made more pips, thanks to you. A curiosity: has Ea ever been made. Congratulations Swing Man and see you soon here on FF. If you would like to give me further advice on GC I will provide you with my email. Thank you
