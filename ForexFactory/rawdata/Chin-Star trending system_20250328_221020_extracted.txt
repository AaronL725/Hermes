PLEASE SEE PAGE#29 POST#425 FOR NEW RULES AND NEW INDICATORS. Hello Traders, I am posting my personal trading system here. You will need my 2 custom made indicators for Metatrader. It is trend following system you need lot of patience and some expertise in fibs,support, resistance in order to exit trade. It is still in developing state. All suggestions are welcome. Rules: IMP: USE ONLY 15 MIN TIMEFRAME 1. Buy Alert = Any of the 2 indicator goes positive and hit define level (+1500 for GJ and EJ, +15 for GU and EU). 2. Actual Buy = The second indicator goes above the define level (+1500 for GJ and EJ, +15 for GU and EU). 3. Sell Alert = Any of the 2 indicator goes negative and hit define level (-1500 for GJ and EJ, -15 for GU and EU). 4. Actual Sell = The second indicator goes below the define level (-1500 for GJ and EJ, -15 for GU and EU). 5. Stop Loss for Buy = Any of the indicator moves below -1500 (for GJ and EJ) or -15 (For GU and EU). 6. Stop Loss for Sell = Any of the indicator moves above +1500(for GJ and EJ) or +15 (For GU and EU). 7. Exit = This is where you need some expertise, you have to close partial lots at each fib level, nearest support and resistance and let the other lot ride. I trade only GU,EU,GJ and EU. This is a trend following system if you see certain pair is range bound for few days just switch to other currency pair. Use your own method for money management. Always remember to close partial lots and book some profit as you follow the trend. Feel free to ask any question. Good luck to all. ALERT EA's: chinstar-alert-EU-GU-Ver1.ex4 and chinstar-alert-EJ-GJ-Ver1.ex4 are Alert EA's for this system. Attach it to appropriate chart. It will generate an alert when trade is comingup, trade confirmation, it will also send mail and draw an arrow. PLEASE NOTE ALERTS ARE GENERATED IN REAL TIME, DONT JUST TAKE TRADE AS SOON AS ALERT COMES, SEE THE CHART AND TRADE ONLY AFTER U SEE CLEAR CONFIRMATION. If Signal comes in off peak time then wait for candle to close and see if indicator is still above or below the defined level. IMP : 1. Avoid signals coming on late Friday say after 9AM EST. 2. If signals is generated late afternoon in any session dont risk much, trade with small lot. 3. Do not take signals before any major news. 4. Strictly follow the stop loss rule. 5. Book small profits as you ride the trend. PLEASE NOTE YOU NEED MT4 BUILD 392 or HIGHER TO USE THIS INDICATOR.

--- 帖子 #2 ---
What are your indis based on ?

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Vol, MCAD, MAs. I use Better volume indicator to judge my trade too.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
But please note GJ is stuck for few days, so closed part lot at 134.85, will let the other ride now.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
hi friend I am studying the volume ... your indicators seem interesting but give error thanks

--- 帖子 #6 ---
What error u get?

--- 帖子 #7 ---
A few seconds after load the indicators on the chart appear this message and MT4 is blocked.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
I am going to so bold as to suggest your system is a fancy pull back from the trend system. Based on the one screen shot you have provided, that is being very daring on my part, so correct me if I am wrong Trading pullbacks without indicators (or a few MAs) is fairly straight forward and there are a number of threads on it. If you have managed to devise an automated method of detecting pull backs, that is quite advanced and is worth considering. But like you said, it is still developing.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Same trouble with me here my man! A lot of the new indi's in other threads are acting thesame,...HHHMMMMM!!

--- 帖子 #10 ---
It is not pull-back, check the second screen-shot in first post. It adds weight to pair and plots on indicator based on combination of few indicators. Please test it for few days .

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Me too

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Sorry guys, not sure what the issue is. I have made few changes to the code. Please see if it works.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Same critical error my friend... any idea to fix that? Thanks a lot for sharing anyway.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
No idea whats going wrong, I downloaded new MT4 client from new vendor and added this indicators. Works fine for me.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Guys Please check what build u are using for MT4. Mine is 399, I got message form other user who has the same version and it worked for him. Please try again with latest version and let me know.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
This trade worked out good. Closed another part lot at 134.45. Still holding small part of short.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Hi Guys, Looks like you need at least build 392. This indicator looks very much like the Instantaneous Trend. Just looking at it visually I'm not seeing anything that's too exciting at this point.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Still holding this short. Hopefully we will break 134 today.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Closed this position. Saw some buying vol. Will look at another setup now.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Dear Pash78 i am following ur settings , kindly check once i am correct ? and sugest me the time frame also , thankx in advance ... http://i56.tinypic.com/i2odtw.png Regards

--- 帖子 #21 ---
5 mins TF is fine if you are scalping, but sometimes you get lot of fake signal.. I use 15 Min for more longer term trade.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
EU trade is working good today. Closed one part lot at 1.4685

--- 帖子 #23 ---
hi Dineeshk how you got to download the indicators not give you error? thanks

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Just download latest build of MT4 and you should be good.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
By the way there was buy signal on GU few mins back in 6490's. Will post chart later, or if someone can post it will be great.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
The first signal got stopped out. I forgot about the GDP announcement. Better to stay out of market before any big News. Avoided the sell signal before news.The second buy is doing fine. EJ on other hand is doing good.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
More than 100 pips move.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Thanks for sharing Pash

--- 帖子 #29 ---
thanks friend I think that their indicators have great potential ... will have to download the latest version of the platform

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Hi, For Crosses EJ and GJ I use levels (1500 &amp; -1500). For EU and GU I use +15 and -15. For USD-CHF Leves 15 &amp; -15 will work. I have not traded this pair, but you can give a try and let us know.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Thanks Pash, just figured it out just before your post. Thanks for the screenshot though, that helps You made some good pips then today I see. Great stuff!

--- 帖子 #32 ---
I missed this trade, but posting chart for reference.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
If 136 level holds today we might see 137.30 area by tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
You did not inserted levels in your indicators, please can you tell us which levels to insert in any indicator?

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Not sure if I understood your question correctly. To insert Levels click on indicators and then on levels tab. Insert levels 0,15 and -15 for EU,GU and levels 0,1500,-1500 for EJ and GJ.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
what level for audusd?

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Try +15 &amp; -15, As I said before, I haven't tried this on other pairs expect the four. You can try on other pairs and let us know how it works.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
GU buy Trade worked good today, we had 2 buy signals. Closed part lot now as seeing low volume. Around 100 pips trade.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hello Pash78, Can you post your template for both the GY and EU pairs? Thank you, chonghm

--- 帖子 #40 ---
See attached.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Made small correction to my first post. Trade should be enter when indicator goes above or below the define level. Read first post.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
No trades today, Just staying on sides. Did anyone check this indicator on other pairs? How are they working?

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Hello, your system is very interesting, but i get a critical error when i pull your indicaotrs to my chart. Can u give us your mq4 files? My IBFX Version 4 Build 229. IBFX hasn't a newer Version. Sorry for my bad englisch. When i have the new indicators, so can i test other pairs.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
You need atleast MT4 Build 392 for this to work correctly.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
The indicator has signal short on GJ, but guys its friday open in Asia, so I will not risk much. Just taking a small lot. lets see.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Took some profit at 35 pips, left the remaining open.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Is this a right buy signal?

--- 帖子 #48 ---
This is re-entry signal. But remember its friday, the momentum to push price higher is less. Enter with low risk (small lot). The correct entry signal was 2 days back, when indicators went from negative to positive territory.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
yes i knew that it is a re -entry signal ,i wanted to know that do you accept re - entry signals in normal market conditions?

--- 帖子 #50 ---
. Yes under normal market its fine, also if you miss 1st entry on 15 min TF, u can re-enter in same direction on 5 min TF signal.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
thank y ou

--- 帖子 #52 ---
have you tried this on higher time frame like 1 hour or daily ? do you think it would give better signals on these timeframes ?

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Hi, I only post here in this forum if I see an indicator that is worthy of writing about. Your indicators are really powerful. Thank you for sharing. Your indicators really compliments my system that I have been using for 5+ years now that make me profitable year after year. I was shocked with the results when I backtested your indies that were integrated with my system, indicating a remarkable almost a flawless results. The way I trade your indicator is: I use the 30 min chart. I trade it very conservatively &gt;&gt;at the swing (for EU, when touching +/-15 marks with confirmations), I place an order for only a profit of 10-15 pips and I am done...and wait for the next swing. Take note that I place 5 to 10 lots at each order making it very profitable for only small move of 10 pips ($1000 winner). Confirmations mean that I don't place the order right away when I reaches the +/-15 marks, but I wait 2 more candles...If the move is strong I take it. If the move is weak I wait for rejection/continuation indicated by HH/LL or MAs. I always trade it manually. TO ALL READERS, if you can create an alert when the line reaches the +/- 15 marks then also emailing the alert, that would be great!!!

--- 帖子 #54 ---
If you look closely most of the time first signal (not re-entry) on 15 min appears on the same candle of 1 hr TF. Yes you can take it on 1 hr TF to be more clear. I haven't tried it on daily TF, may be you can test and post results. I would really like people testing it and posting results here.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
How do u guys update MT to build 399. I thought the broker did that for you. Whenever the new build was released.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi, Thanks for posting your strategy and chart with these indicators. What are those red lines on your chart ? And how do you use stop loss. Yes if someone can create an alert for this indicator will be great, I currently don't have time for it.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Just download latest version from your broker, most probably they will have latest build. If not just download MT4 from other vendor and open demo account to test this indicator.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
This is the EU trade for today. Please note the short signal earlier should have been avoided as most markets in Europe was closed.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Here is GJ trade for today. Again the long signal in Europe session should have been avoided as markets were closed. As for GJ there is good support in 135.20 area. Will be interesting to see if that level breaks.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Hi Pasha78, can you implement an EA to test your indicator and share with us to test it? The indicators are good, they don't repaint and the strategy is good...

--- 帖子 #61 ---
By they dont repaint you mean they dont show u the actual signal? Those red lines on chart are the one I drawn to show where to take the trade. You need the take trade manually when the indicator crossed certain level as defined in 1st post. The EA you want is to actually take the trade or just send an Alert to take a trade? I will work on alert EA sometime later, currently working on third indicator to identify flat market but having limited success on it.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Still getting errors here on loading the indicators - any ideas?

--- 帖子 #63 ---
If you are getting critical error after loading indicator, u need to download latest build of MT4.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
I was thinking that maybe the reason you need to have 15 for some pairs and higher values for others is the different pip value. I was also then wondering if there is a programmatic way of normalizing the indicator's output so that the critical number would always be 15 or -15 whichever pair it was on?

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Hi Pash78, Thanks for sharing your system....looks really promising. Since I have problems with my Alpari UK Metatrader version for your indicators, could you tell us which is your broker, I want to open a demo account and try your indicators. Thank you

--- 帖子 #66 ---
No the reason for different levels on different pairs is not the pip value, in that case Ej and EU would have to use similar levels. there is a way to adjust the levels, but in that case we have to use separate indicators for cross currency (Ej,GJ) and (EU,GU), also it will add unnecessary overhead to code. Rather it is simple to remember just the levels.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Try FXCM .

--- 帖子 #68 ---
GJ testing the 135.20 area, I have closed small portion here. Hope it breaks the 135 level today. If that goes 134.80 has some support.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Thank you, Will try tomorrow morning. Regards

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Closed all positions at 134.45 a 120 pip trade. There was also short signals on EU/GU/EJ, will post charts tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
I tried your system a few days and it seems ok. I have a question. You can add an alert when the market entry conditions are met. Sincerely CalinI tried your system a few days and it seems ok. I have a question. You can add an alert when the market entry conditions are met. Thanks

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Wow should have hold part portion for little more would have grabbed 100 pip more . But no issues may be next time.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Just had BUY signal on EU in 1.4820 area. Here is the chart. EU tried to test 1.4900 yesterday and failed, right now it is looking to test it again, take some profit around 1.4880-1.4900 and wait to see if it breaks 1.4900. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Seeing a Buy alert on EJ, waiting for second indicator for confirmation.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I took EU +30 quickly pips, waiting for EJ too...... Thank you Pash

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Good to know , if u are still long on EU, book some profit now and leave the rest to see if it breaks 4900. There is decent amount of SL above 4900's.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Here is GU chart for yesterday as I mentioned.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Although there are some short signals, I am staying on sides and not taking any trades. Dont see the strength in market. I think there will be good oppourtunity to trade after the UK PMI numbers and US data. Till then just relax.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Closed EU trade at 1.4910, saw a lot of selling volume.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
There is SELL alert on EJ. Will wait for confirmation.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
I demo tested this on AUS/USD pair and worked out good. Did any one had a chance to test this on other pairs?

--- 帖子 #82 ---
SOLD EJ at 119.97.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Hi pash - could you plz post the volume indi .. or may you post a link to this indi ?

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Its is better volume indicator I originally found on FF. Try it here http://emini-watch.com/free-stuff/volume-indicator/

--- 帖子 #85 ---
EJ testing 119.50 support area, hopefully it will be taken out and we will see that 119.20 support area.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Seeing Sell Alert on GU, will wait for confirmation.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
hi pash - thx for the indi, I'm watching the GU too.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Closed small lot for 119.30 will ride the rest.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
No SELL confirmation on GU yet, its afternoon session in US no strong movements now, till Asia opens. But again its holiday in JPY.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Ok Finally a SELL on GU, but it has come at end of US session, So i wont risk much, just taking a small lot and see how it goes.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Sell alert on EU , will wait for confirmation, but again Asia session and JPY holiday, so wont rish much.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Closed for 7 pip loss also closed EJ at 119.30 for 67 pip profit. Will see u all tomorrow at US session.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Hi ....are those indicators on post 1 are the latest ones or there are newer ones on later post?

--- 帖子 #94 ---
it's all time the same procedure: look for it in the right corner - see the paperclip ! pash has here a nice and clear thread - it's esay to find so far !

--- 帖子 #95 ---
thx for the system, indicators are great tomorrow is NFP, do you usually trade the NFP day with the system? does it work out well?

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Yes I do, please note if you get signals before any big news ( even hours b4), dont take it till the news. If there is a signal right at the news time, as we had today on EU, and few days back on GU during UK GDP, then take it , it has more chances of bigger push at that time. I will post some charts in a bit.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Both indicators are great! Very clear entry and exits. Only one disadvantage, we need watch screen all day. I left my screen few times for short time and missed big moves, like today. Can somebody make alert (best is email) for this system? Much appreciated.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Yes, alert EA will be ready by tomorrow. Just finishing up final touches.Watch this thread.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
thx ..... look forward to the charts so just to clarify you trade the nfp day only after the jobs numbers comes out, you mentioned dont take a trade even hours b4 so you dont take any trades throughout the day till the report comes out? thx again

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Yes its better to stay out till the big news, sometimes u get a signal for one direction and the news takes price in opposite direction, smtimes brokers dont honor your stop loss and account is burned . Also if you are not comfortable with the quick move during news its better to stay out, there will be more opportunities later.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
can you load the exe file so we can change the levels in the code or to change automatically dependent on which pair it is loaded onto thank you

--- 帖子 #102 ---
The levels are not in code, it just plots the indicator. You need to click on levels tab in indicator and define the values.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
I dont want to keep setting levels for different pairs , also i want to test the indicators in ea i have and require exe to pull out indicator levels once breached. hope you can help

--- 帖子 #104 ---
This chart will make it clear.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Post 1 has got latest indicators.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I can confirm that this strategy works for AUD/USD. Have also tested for USD/JPY. Thanks

--- 帖子 #107 ---
all clear now waiting for nfp tomorrow thx

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Nope have not, but as USD/JPY is cross-currency the levels should be 1500 and -1500. Give it a try, I will try it next week. I started testing it on only 4 pairs, but now looks like it can be generalized to any pairs. General rule will be level +- 15 for normal currency and +- 1500 for cross currency.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
USD/JPY I will test it further...

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Thanks for the chart.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
can this system be automated?

--- 帖子 #112 ---
yes I think that EA could be coded easily Dunno what pash is thinking about ?

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Personally I am not a big fan of EA, how will u train an EA not to take trades b4 news release or in dead markets. Also my take profit varies and not fixed to a point, so coding it is impossible. However as I said before the alert EA is almost ready, it will generate alerts when a trade is coming as well as when to take actual trade. Hopefully should post it by tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Wow Euro went 300 pips down since the alert today, I did not hold for that long, should have waited . But anyway hade some good trades today. There as also a short on GU.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Looks like all pairs are retracing after todays big move down. Dont take any Buy or SELL signal till tomorrows NFP, till then just relax.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Hi pash78 Thanks for your excellent system. But I could not attach chin indicators on chart successfully. Only blue indicator are seen &amp; no levels. Please tell me how to set levels.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Just got one re-entry signal after NFP on GU Sell, will proceed cautiously.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Out with small loss, no clear entry.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Can you give us the indicators in MQ4 format ? And, where do you download metatrader from ? The ones I know do not have updates as high as 392... Thank you!

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Where do you download your MT4 software from, the ones I know do not have update higher than 392...

--- 帖子 #121 ---
No clear signals on any pair yet and its friday, better stay out .

--- 帖子 #122 ---
[quote=ttaro27;4599575]Where do you download your MT4 software from, the ones I know do not have update higher than 392...[/quote Try FXCM 's MT4.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Just click on indicator and then hit levels tab, you should be able to set it.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Alright so as promised I am attaching Alert EA for this strategy. just attach it to charts you want to trade. It will generate a pop-up alert for upcoming signal, actual signal, send a mail and even draw an arrow. It is not that perfect but servers the purpose, Please note signals are generated in real-time, dont just trade as soon as the signal comes, see the chart and wait for confirmation. test it and let me know how it works. I will aslo update this in my first post in few mins. Note : Dont take any signal on Friday's after 9AM EST.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Thanks a lot ! So far you have a bug in this new indi version ... signals are alerted every few seconds ? At this moment I have some dozen times the alert about GBPUSD SELL - "Possible SELL comingup on GBPUSD"

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Well its not a bug, it kind of send signals on every tick. I tried coding to stop that, but still sends it out. Hope to fix that by next week.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
pash will you be releasing the mq4 for the indicators? thx

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Thanks pash, your time and kindness is much appreciated. Made some pips this week, hope to get more consistent in my entries and more disciplined next week and start posting a few charts If time permits. Look forward to the updated alerts. Have a good weekend. God bless

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Good to know , yes please post some charts. I am trying to fix that stupid multiple alerts issue. At first i thought its simple, but it is giving me a hard time for past few hours. Hope to nail it this weekend.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
I don't know nothing about programming, but maybe it helps if you set an alert only by close of the candle!?

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Ok so I was able to fix the bug in previous EA. This one wont generate alert on each tick. You might still see 3-4 alert at a time as it monitors the indicator in real-time. Please test and let me know. Files are also updated in first post.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
ok so we have a sell alert on GJ. will wait for Sell confirmation.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
No confirmation yet. I am logging off for tonight. Will be back in US session. Last week we had major movement on most pairs, they might retrace this week, just use fib levels for exiting your trade if the trade is in direction of retrace. Good luck.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Guys did any one test the new EA, let me know how it works. We had sell signals today on EJ and GJ. Will post chart in some time.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Here is chart for EJ trade today, in at 115.96 and closed part lot at 115.12 for 84 pips profit, Still holding remaining lot. Remember this was kind of re-entry signal, so I open small lot. Dont get confuse with the previous arrows on this chart, those are when i was testing my EA on lower TF.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
I missed this trade, but if someone had taken it was a 80-90 pip trade. Here is the chart.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Hoping to break 115 level today.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Hi Pash your twitter link doesnt work but I have been trading a system based on 15M High Lows and this is very similar I will definetly try this in conjunction thanks FXWest

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Try now, dont know why it was going to some other link today. I just re-created the signature. Please post some charts of your strategy too. Thanks, Pash.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
I like this system -- I just add to my cloud break out system- But I used it on 15 pips rangebars -- look excellent

--- 帖子 #141 ---
hi Zamanib, I read about your cloud break out system it looks interesting. Can you please post some charts on how you integrate the two systems. I am looking at something to eliminate false alerts. Thanks, Pash.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
For myself I add an EMA 60 and 200 to minimize false signals. Today I tried your EA and get 2 alerts on USD/JPY and EUR/USD.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Thanks Dynel, Good to know the EA alert works. Did u also get alerts on EJ, GJ and GU? Those pairs also had good move today.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
I added the EA late in the evening, my first alert was USD/JPY @ 8pm (GMT +1).

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Hi Pash do you wait for the candle to close?

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Yes normally I do wait, but if the signal comes at peak time say just after news or in early session after open, then I take it as soon as condition is met. During non-peak hours its better to wait for candle to close.

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Great thanks

--- 帖子 #148 ---
I trade at peak time 3am-11am est NY time

--- 帖子 #149 ---
ausi -- this both system - combine can earn you some good pips

--- 帖子 #150 ---
pls have a look at the following pic and hope it gives some ideas. http://www.mediafire.com/imgbnc.php/...c61820b74g.jpg

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Possible Buy on EJ coming up.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
We might get a buy alert on GJ soon, just wait for confirmation.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
No clear signal yet on any pair.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
the download link for Mt4 has been removed. could you please upload this indicator to share? many thanks!

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Hi Zamanib, Thanks, nice charts and good explanation. I agree trades need to be taken only in peak times, to get the necessary push.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Here it is..

--- 帖子 #157 ---
No trades today, had a good day yesterday. Will stay on side and watch.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Ok Saw this buy signal on EJ at 116.05, As it has come in off peak time, I enter with a small lot.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
116.35-40 area will be the first target.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
If we get in i will enter with small lot, and I see that GJ might tesst the 132.47 area again.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Closed part EJ at 116.34 for 29 pips profit, will ride rest.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
In at 132.10 , first target will be 132.40 area.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Gj has major resistance at 132.32 area.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Again coming at off peak time, go in with small lot.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
EJ testing resistance at 116.45 area, a clear break of it and we might see 117 in Asia.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
thanks a lot!

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Closed part at 132.60 for 50 pips, will hold the remaining lot.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Hi Pash78, Thanks for these chin indicators they are great. Just out of curiosity did you create these indicators yourself and if so maybe you could explain to us in simple terms how they operate, it would be interesting to know. Once again thanks very much, these are great, muchly appreciated. Am now following you on twitter too Happy Trading

--- 帖子 #169 ---
wat the period for off peak time??start from est 9am? till...?

--- 帖子 #170 ---
i buy eu on 6.30pm est time, is that a good signal? chin a value:42.5060 chin b value:17.2522

--- 帖子 #171 ---
6.30 pm is after Japan open , it is still a good time, but volatility is less as compared to Europe and US session. If a signal is generated at these times, I normally open a small lot and dont risk much. I saw the signal on Euro at that time, but was already in 2 trades so did not take it.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Took the cloud break out and stay in trade once the chin a b give signal exit with 50 pip

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Hallo Pash78, how come I can't make this work?

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Thanks you for creating the alerts. You guys rock!!

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Closed another part at 133.70 for a total 160 pips trade. I might re-enter on this one.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Pash you killed it! Took a small lost on GU yesterday, but im happy I followed the signal...No harm... Had a short entry on the EU,got in just under the pivot at 64, got out at 08, so just over 50pips for the day. Very happy and im done. Await tomorrow now By the way Pash I cant seem to drag the alert indicators into my platform? From the navigator window I try and drag and drop it, but nothing happens. Guessing there might be a minor bug or something in the updated version you released? Any idea how this could be fixed? Thanks man!

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Thanks Zamanib, It was a good trade, I dont trade Euro session, but was in GJ trade from Yesterday, and got out today morning. By the way how do u set the range bar indicators, I downloaded the one from the link in your posts, but the document says it needs to be in offline mode? Not sure if I understood the document correctly.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Hi Wilterfire, What error u get? Did u copy the alert EA's in expert folder? Just right click on EA and say attach to chart u want signals on. Click on Allow Live trading and it should work.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Hi, Just copy the two files Chinstar-Alert-EJ-GJ-Ver1.ex4 and Chinstar-Alert-EU-GU-Ver1.ex4 from 1st post in expert folder of your MT4. Restart MT4 and from navigator window just right click on these EA's and attach it to appropriate charts on which you would like to have alerts. It should work. Let me know if you have any issues. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Hi Pash took the ej alert just now from 115.88 to 115.67 just above some resistance 1 standard lot first real trade on your system should have left a partial open FXWest

--- 帖子 #181 ---
There was a SELL on EJ few mins back. I am in at 115.98. Remember the BUY signal earlier should have been avoided as at the same time there was SELL on EU.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Yes I am in that trade too , I normally close part lots at exit levels and also move my stop.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Closed another part at 115.23 for 75 pip profit.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Out of EJ now, I might look to re-enter long on GJ.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
it seems that we are seeing a short signal.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Yes seeing short signal, But we are in offpeak period now and GJ has some strong support in this area, look at the chart. If that level breaks then short will be good. Else it might retrace from this level. I will wait for clear signal. Till then relax. Out of all trades for now.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
yes i knew that , i am out of my trades and relaxing

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Guess I was wrong.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Im really enjoying the simplicity of these trades and it allows me to have less stress with the m15 chart and good big runs of profit. I dont have enough words to thank you for your kindness in sharing what you have here Pash, I really appreciate your indys as there helping me to become a much better trader and this is just what I need to get my confidence back. Much appreciated for all your effort here bro, God bless you greatly

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Hi StLeon, Yes these are my indicators. The concept is to have inputs from multiple indicators, compute them and just plot one output. Two indicators are needed as they both take different input but follows each other to give us good confirmation. The levels are defined based on detail back testing.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Thanks, I'am glad the system is working good for you. Is the alert EA working now?

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Yeh, its working fine now Will come in VERY handy to make sure I dont miss any trades now. Thanks again, wish you many pips for the week bro.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Gj is backing for long! who toke the short signal?

--- 帖子 #194 ---
As I said before GJ was bound to retrace, so avoided that short signal.But it still could have fetch 20-30 pips. We might get a BUy signal now, but as it is offpeak just enter with small lot, not sure how much high it will go. If we get another buy (re-entry) in Europe session that will be a real good trade.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
let's see if this trade works...

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Thanks for sharing your indicators and system! Just closed out ej short for +38 pips on first trade with this.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
gj just signaled a sell

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Curious - is there an expiration date in these indicators? TIA

--- 帖子 #199 ---
I attached it to the chart, but nothing show up? and do I need to turn on the EA? when I turn on the EA, it is a sad face, not a smiling face. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #200 ---
In the EA properties in your chart, in the first tab, check the box that says "Enable Live Trading"

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Every thing line up -- go for about 50 pips I add a few more indicators -- but dont realy need them both cloudbreakout and chinAB is good enought just wait for the trades in peak hrs you will be smiling for the rest of the day

--- 帖子 #202 ---
hello pash78 and thank you for sharing these awesome indicators with us. I've been experimenting with them for 3 days now. The first day I entered into trades as soon as the EA gave a signal and as I was thinking that I came to the end of a successful day, my last trade would almost blew me up. The second day I waited for the bar close as you mentioned and aimed for 15-20 pips for each trade. It was okay for me as my daily target is 30 pips. Today is also a success up to now. As far as I see these indicators determine the entry points very accurately. What I would like to ask you about is the exit points. Although you mentioned at the first post that we should partially get out of the trade at certain points, what strategy do you personally use? For example, today I aim for 30 pips. When the trade gets to +15 I pull my stop to BE and at +25 to +15. If it turns back I get my +15, if hits take profit +30. But when I look back in the charts I see 100+ pips movements. How should we act to get the most pips possible? Thanx again and good luck...

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Thanks a lot!

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Look like I missed a good Europe session

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Looking at charts it seems we wont see any good signal in US session. There might be a re-entry signal, just enter with low risk.

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Hi, As i said in my first post, this is trend following system, I dont aim for fix pips but look at nearest S/R or fib levels, close part lot at first level and set a mental stop loss, then go on closing part lots at next levels until I see weakness. I also see the volume indicator to judge my trades, although I am not very good at it but still learning to read it. The SL with this indicator can be anywhere between 15-50 pips depending on the pair you trade , so any losing trade will eat up your profit if you have fix pip target. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
thank you pash78, that was helpful. however, I think I'd better stick to my small daily target of 30-40 pips and try not to be too greedy for now. as the time passes, I believe I will read and interpret the setups better.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
there is coming up a good ej trade, isnt it?

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Off-peak time , proceed with caution , looks more like a retrace than an upmove for me.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
oki so we just trade the london and beginning of us ?

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Well signals in these session (london and beginning of us) are good and cause a big move. For rest of day signals are not that strong or even false. I trade with small lot during off-peak hours and wait for clear confirmation before entering the trade.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
So it was more of a retrace on EJ, indicator Chin-B prevented us to enter long for now. It will be interesting to see if the 115 level holds, else we might see a SELL in some time.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
But off-peak time and friday, just proceed with caution.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Short on Ej worked out good. Closed everything now, will be back in US session.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Yep every thing line

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Hi Zamanib, I want to ask which template use. zb_cloud or zb_cloud41224?

--- 帖子 #217 ---
This is a good conservative way to trade. You need the two indis Chin-A and Chin-B in your indicator folder just as you have it right now. This is a combo of the two indicators used here. It draws both indis in one sub-window Automatically decides if the limits are 15 or 1500 You can change periods on the fly to check for higher and lower timeframes. Just click on the period in the tool bar Try it and see if aids you. Cheers Pat

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Nice... thank you

--- 帖子 #219 ---
yes, thank y pat, good job

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Sell on EJ coming up.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
114.35 area looks like first support.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Thanks Pat, This will help others who get confused with the levels.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
01 - GBP/USD short +72pips 02 - EUR/USD short +38pips Thank you pash78 for this strategy and Pat1 for the new indicator!

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Good trade Dynel and thanks for posting charts too, I missed the GU trade. EJ short working good for now. Was in EU with small lot.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
First support area reached, closed part lot for 46 pips. Next is 114 area.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
EU approaching first support at 4155 area. It will be really interesting to see if 4120 area breaks.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
EU closed part at 1.4158.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Closed next part lot at 114.18, still holding some portion.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
It did break the 4120 level, closed another part at 4108.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Good day today. Closed all trades minutes back. Here are the charts. have a good weekend. See you all next week.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Caliyn, Zamanib also has a separate very good strategy posted @ ichimoku-clouds Breakout . He has combined his method with chin indicators and gets good results. Have a look at that post you will also find those template. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Couldn't take the GU or EU short because of some high impact USD news so didn't want to rush my trades...Had to miss them both unfortunately. Hope I can start to get some good pips in this coming week, cant wait You've done really well today Pash, great trades!

--- 帖子 #233 ---
No good signals today, remember all the SELL alerts were re-entry signals.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Possible BUY coimhg up on EJ/EU, will wait for confirmation.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
1.4250 is the first resistance area on EU.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Long EU at 4201. This is my first trade with Chin-Star; hope it's a good one. Update: Closed half of my position at +30 pips and moved stop to breakeven. Good start for me

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Good luck, we are approaching 1st resis area, I normally close part lot and ride the rest.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Need to rush, Closed part lots EU for 1.4242 and EJ for 115.21. Will be back in sometime.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Closed all position, i was hoping EU to break 4250 this session, will look for re-entry now.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Hi Pash do you use the high or low of the candle or the close as the entry point?

--- 帖子 #241 ---
It depends, if I see good PA, then I enter as soon as second indicator goes above the level. Else I wait for candle to close.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
@Pash, so you enter only when both chinlines goes above the 15 or 1500 level for long trade?

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Yes, please see my first post, it explains entry and stop-loss rules. Only one indicator goes above/below level 15/1500--- just a buy or sell alert. When second indicator follows and goes above/below level 15/1500--- actual buy or sell signal.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
I am just avoiding short signals on GJ/GU for now, as it is off peak-time and also they are more of a re-entry signal. Dont like the PA.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Here are Charts for two trades today, Eu- 46 pips, Ej- around 50 pips. See u guys tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
thx rof this good system any one can attach the Better volume indicator plz ??

--- 帖子 #247 ---
It already is attached, click the paperclip in the upper right corner of the thread and you'll see a list of all attachments to this thread

--- 帖子 #248 ---
thx jeff

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Pash78, what time frame do you draw your fibs on? I do daily since I like seeing the big picture, but do you draw them on the 4 hour or 1 hour since you trade intraday? Also, I'm going to be testing out your system on AUD/USD. I will let you know how it's going, and post charts and such. Thanks, and have a profitable day. Rob

--- 帖子 #250 ---
wat wrong? wait till 15min candle close or direct enter once the indicator chin a &amp; chin b above 15

--- 帖子 #251 ---
What's wrong is that no system is ever perfect. You can't win all the time and don't expect to. If it was that easy this would be a millionaire's forum.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Exactly Clocksley, you cant win all the time. Also Ian please follow stop-loss rule as in first post. EU might still reverse and come back, else close it when indicator touches -15. Then wait for next setup. Price movement on GU ,GJ and even EJ was good today whereas EU was kind-of choppy.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
@pash, are y looking for short entry in eu and gu?

--- 帖子 #254 ---
I am looking for buy in Gu and Eu after news

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Just curious why the TROTAG symbol is included on the templates. My understanding of the symbol is it was "the rumpled one" who had a reputation for some nasty code. From a post in BabyPips: 4. "TROlls" denotes a particular subset of internet trolls: these are aliases (or possibly disciples) of a guy named Avery Horton, who posted here and elsewhere under the screen-name The Rumpled One (which has gotten abbreviated to TRO). From "TRO" we get "TROll". This guy was banned from Babypips some time ago, but enjoys sneaking back in under assumed names in order to make trouble. (More on WHY they do it, in a moment). Horton has a colorful history of joining, and being banned from, various forex forums. Those who think his antics are all in good fun should visit Tymen's thread The finest in trend trading and take a close look at the cyber terrorism he attempted there, embedding malicious code in an indicator he graciously offered for free. He couldn't resist signing his work, with the signature " TRO Tag ". The obscenities which he embedded in his code were posted by one of our members for all to see; but, they have since been removed from Tymen's thread. Read more: http://forums.babypips.com/melting-p...#ixzz1Mby2VRFh So far I have been impressed with the indicator but the signature in the template makes me a bit nervous. I am not implying anything just curious as to why the skull and cross bones shows up in the bottom of the chart and when you hover over it you get TROTAG and a PIP number. Comments?

--- 帖子 #256 ---
No No I am not Horton in different name . I had that running when i created the template . I will post new template in few mins. Thanks for pointing it out, i did pay attention to it.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
who is going to short in EU now?

--- 帖子 #258 ---
I am in at 4141, however not liking the PA yet.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Short coming up on GU, EU is looking choppy.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Gu is choppy too!

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Not short EU yet, was looking to get in but waiting as I think it needs a retrace just around the daily pivot quickly, or better still retrace near the Daily Open line, before we start pushing down, that way there shouldn't be any stupid drawdown... Hope it works out.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
GU no clear signalyet, CHIN-A is not staying below 15.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Out with a loss

--- 帖子 #264 ---
here are new templates.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Please note there is sell alert on GU, however there is some support in 6185 area, also we are at london close. So proceed with caution. Else its better to stay out today.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Yes I draw fibs on higher TF, 1H or 4H.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
I sold Gu 1.6918

--- 帖子 #268 ---
6918?

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Just proceed with caution, 6185 area is good support, if that breaks 6150 is next support area. i am in from 6198 but with a small lot, dont want to risk much.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Some time in 2008???

--- 帖子 #272 ---
GU needs to break this triangle to find a direction, until then its choppy.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
yes you right 1.6198 mistype

--- 帖子 #274 ---
how much normal drawdown in this strategy? how much average loss and gain for this strategy? thank you

--- 帖子 #275 ---
MAX-Drawdown/Stop-loss can be upto 50-70 pips. Gain depends on you, how you exit. In peak time (London and US morning session) gains can be very good. During off peak time I trade with small lot and risk less.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
There was a buy signal on EU and GU, I avoided it as it was looking more of retrace than an upmove also this is off-peak time.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
I missed this EJ trade today, was stuck with bad EU trade. But anyway will have better trades tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Is anyone using the EAs to receive email alerts? It seems to work fine for EU, and GU, but the jpy pairs all flood my inbox with emails when an alert fires. I received about 800 email alerts yesterday from ej and about 400+ today from gj and another 200 or so from ej. I have definitely checked the "Disable alert once hit" box. The fact that the same config seems to work fine on non-jpy alert emails makes me think maybe there's something wrong with the jpy EA. Would be nice to get reliable text alerts while I'm at work so I might get into some trades then. TIA

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Are u using the EA which I uploaded previously? IF yes then it was sending repeated alerts at same time. Check the new one in first post and see if you still get same issue.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
I thought I used what was in the first post, but maybe not, I'll download them, thanks!

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Didn't work. Downloaded from first post, checked disable alert once hit, restarted mt4 platform - just received over 200 emails (and still counting) on the eurjpy buy

--- 帖子 #282 ---
You need the two indis Chin-A and Chin-B in your indicator folder just as you have it right now. This is a combo of the two indicators used here. It draws both indis in one sub-window Automatically decides if the limits are 15 or 1500 You can change periods on the fly to check for higher and lower timeframes. Just click on the period in the tool bar Try it and see if aids you. Cheers Pat[/quote] Thanks a lot Pat . Your indicator Chin Combo is really useful. I would like to ask you, if you do not mind, can not make an average of two indicators and to mark a single line? Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
I am having the same problem with mine.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Did anyone take the GU/GJ short in London session? It was a nice drop. I think morning US session will be choppy, till the FOMC meeting. Although I don't expect anything dramatic at FOMC but still there are some surprises.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
I have it running on my machine and its fine. Can u check on other MT4 platform (other vendor) just to check.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Will wait for confirmation, as it is pre FOMC I will trade with small lot.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Bought EJ at 115.65

--- 帖子 #288 ---
116.20 is first resistance area. Will close part lot somewhere here and ride the rest.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Loosing some momentum after London close closed part at 115.95.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
EJ reaching 1st resis. Closed another part at 116.16.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
very good trade pash, good job I missed that trade, next time call me pls

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Didn't get in until 115.92. Was able to close 1/2 at 30 pips. SL to breakeven and a free ride for the rest of the trade.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Sure, how about a chat-room?

--- 帖子 #294 ---
I entered on previous bar as soon as chin-a touched 1500, also saw a good buying volume so did not wait for more confirmation. SL moved to BE now and will see the crazy FOMC statements

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Watch GJ pair for signal after FOMC, it is in perfet position for setup right now. If we see volatility after the news it would be good to trade. Caution there can be huge wiphsaw after any big news, if you are not comforatble, its better to stayout. There are always other times to trade.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
I have offered to set up a chat room and think it would be very useful, even though signals don't come all that frequently. I can get one up some time today if you guys want it.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
No trades, no surprises in FOMC, closed EJ as well.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
pash y get the gj now?

--- 帖子 #299 ---
I did not get in was away from the desk. Off-peak time proceed with caution use small lot

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Got in on this with small risk at 131.95 it isn't moving much though. btw, on the alert email problem, the alerts are working fine on my pc, it's just the email part that goes crazy, just wanted to make the sure the problem is clear.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Let me check my codes again, and the one on EU-GU works fine correct?

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Test this one and let me know if there is still the problem.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Try the file I just uploaded in my previous post and let me know if there are still issues.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Ok, I have placed this one on my chart and will let you know what happens. Should I have every tick mode checked or not?

--- 帖子 #305 ---
It needs to be checked.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Possible SELL coming up on GU, will wait for confirmation. We also have another USD news at 10, so proceed with caution.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
In at 6155 with small lot coz of news in some time.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
6120-6130 is immediate support area.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
hey pash, same here but why you dont wait till the the candle closed at 51? isnt a entry rule?

--- 帖子 #310 ---
I mention in first post (in RED), if alert comes in off-peak I wait for candle to close. In Peak time I take it based on PA, today jumped in at 6155 coz of + USD data. But looks like I should have waited little more. We have another set of news coming in 30 mins, so I entered with small lot, to minimize risk.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Closed for 20 pip loss , not liking the PA. Will wait till 10am EST.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
guys there was a great entry for GJ from London session no one mention it

--- 帖子 #313 ---
That one worked, 1 email per alert, thanks!

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Hi Lebaneese, I dont trade in London session, Yes that was a good trade.thanks for posting the chart.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
one +ve and 2 negative data, will be a mixed day. Also London closing in few mins.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
GU should break the 6130 support in order to go down.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
sell signal on AUD in @ .0608

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Was not a clear signal, off-peak period, indicator did not stay below -15. Look for EU buy.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
4295-4300 first resistance on Euro, rmember off-peak time enter with small lot.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
...

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Looking for 4330-40 area as 1st target.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
hi pash, what are chin A &amp; chin B based upon ? regards .Hawk.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
I mention this before too it is based on "Vol, MCAD, MAs etc.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
hi pash i read that clearly. maybe i wasn't clear on what i wanted to ask ... how does vol, macd &amp; ma's work out in chin A &amp; b indicator ... could you post source code &amp; explain briefly. your strategy looks nice &amp; i took a profitable trade on audusd 15 min tf. usually i don't trade anything below H 1, but this indicator compelled me to try scalping &amp; it looked good on charts. before following anything religiously, i should know what i am doing ... regards .Hawk.

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Just sent you PM. Code will not be shared. You can use it on 1hr or higher TF as well for longer trades.

--- 帖子 #326 ---
patience finally paid off, EU reached 1st target, closed part at 4333, will ride the rest.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
pash would you be kind enough to generate two ex4 files, in which i can have both chin A &amp; chin B in same window with following colour code &amp; settings : first ex4 indicator when added should show following settings in box : chin A&gt; colors &gt; 0 Lime 1 Red 2 DarkGreen levels +15 - 15 levels&gt; Style &gt; Red chin B &gt; colors &gt; 0 Lime 1 Red 2 DarkGreen levels +15 - 15 levels&gt; Style &gt; Black second ex4 indicator (everything same except levels - for jpy pairs ) chin A&gt; colors &gt; 0 Lime 1 Red 2 DarkGreen levels +1500 - 1500 levels&gt; Style &gt; Red chin B &gt; colors &gt; 0 Lime 1 Red 2 DarkGreen levels +1500 - 1500 levels&gt; Style &gt; Black http://img16.imageshack.us/img16/1371/31887195.gif i would love to just add indy &amp; have following effects on chart with above settings: regards .Hawk. pls note: previous chin combo indicator is incorrect &amp; do not wish to build upon it, furthermore i like above settings.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Hi Pash, would you pls generate a "DRAW_HISTOGRAM SetIndexStyle VERSION" for the chin's indicators,too. if there is not much trouble? thanks a lot!

--- 帖子 #329 ---
hmmm ... upon following chart analysis it seems my setting on putting both chin in one window is incorrect as well, first indicator is mine with both chin's &amp; second &amp; third below are pash ones. http://img821.imageshack.us/img821/6939/69552594.gif please do the needful, pash ! many thanks. regards .Hawk.

Did anyone take Short on EU/EJ?

--- 帖子 #331 ---
yes, here!

--- 帖子 #332 ---
As usual the market is full of sh*t! Couldn't short the EU, just another day of "missing entries" for me i guess...EU was too close to S1 so had to stand aside. Ive just had too many bad entries where I enter, and price coincidently reverses the other way so I wanted to wait for a retrace. Normally it would have retraced a bit sooner but hey, looks like the market just wants to do whatever the hell it wants lol Hoping GU may give a good re-entry to go long. Will be careful though since its a friday and this markets mental.

--- 帖子 #333 ---
yes closed EU saw some buying vol.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
EU,GU are stuck in range for few days, so no big trades.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Enter long on GJ @132.66 with small lot. Dont want to risk much on friday, 132.90 area is 1st resistance.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Enter GU at 6248. Again small lot this is re-entry signal.

Closed part at 132.91, will ride the rest.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
GU has immediate resis at 6270 area.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Let's see how it goes this position

--- 帖子 #340 ---
another part stopped out at BE. Closed GU for 10 pip loss.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Reenter short on EJ.

--- 帖子 #342 ---
targeting 115.60 area.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
target 1 reached.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Pash when u talk of resistance how do u define them and how do u get them?

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Hi Lebaneese check this

--- 帖子 #346 ---
I draw simple support and resis trend-lines on chart, also draw fibo retracement based on higher TF. I dont look at exact value to get out. Thats why I always mention area, and get out +- 10 pips around that area. Today we had GU signals near support/resistance, so it was choppy. On other hand EJ short was good, 116 was first support but that was taken out immediately and 115.60 was next.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Closed another part at same level 115.60 and keeping small portion open as both indicators are also below 15 on 1 Hr TF. Will look at it how it opens on Sunday.

--- 帖子 #348 ---

Hello Friend... Thanks for strategy... Pash can you create this indi in tradestation ... just to test historical performance .. And also can fix the best exit for that ... Arun...

--- 帖子 #356 ---
By exit you mean for SL or take profit?

Pash just wanted to say a big thank you. I took the GY trade getting in around 132.32 and closed out at 132.83. Thank you so much for sharing this. Kind Regards

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Good trade Heath, I am still holding my Long 133.15 area is next resis.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
If someone is in EU long 4150 area is first resis.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
EU trying to re-test 4150 again and EJ 115.90-116 level.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Hi Arun, Take profit will vary with each trade/pair. I exit part lots at every S/R points and try to ride the trade as much.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Here are charts for todays trade. Both around 50 pip trade.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Pash, I see for the ej you entered well before Chin B crossed over 1500, is that because GJ had crossed on both and you basically entered with correlated price movement?

--- 帖子 #371 ---
gu posible short

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Sell on EJ and EU. if 115 goes on EJ, 114.70 is next resistance area.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Closed both with a loss . Will wait for next signal now.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Both EU/EJ had a choppy session, they are at resistance now. EU has already broken upper resistance, but have another one at 4107 let see how far it goes.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
pash, what have your results been this week? it has been very choppy so far.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Monday - No trades, except some in asia, closed for few pips. Tuesday- Had two 50 pip trades so total of 100 pips, I posted charts yesterday. Today-- 2 loosing short trades around 30 pip loss, there is buy signal on EU/EJ now but its off peak, I am waiting for more confirmation on EJ. There was good BUY trades on GU and GJ today in London session, did anyone took those trades?

--- 帖子 #377 ---
EU testing yesterdays hight @ 4131, then immedaite resis at 4150 area.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Small -20 yesterday afternoon on EJ...Late night after London session on my m5 chart got into a short early because I knew it wanted to go down as it was lining up with other things on my chart so left an all night trade and bagged 60 pips by morning. Took a stupid buy signal on EJ today when PA didn't look good, Me and pash both closed out for a small loss (much better then a big loss!), mines was about 2 pips or so, but im glad I lost 2 pips rather than wait like a douche bag and see my trade close out for -20 or 25 pips. heres a chart on EJ im looking at to see if theres a good signal in a bit...(small lot size because its outside of trading hours)

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Two nice BUY trade on EU and EJ in this Asia session. Was able to grab some pips. Will post charts tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
soon buy for GJ may be

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Nice EJ short, closed part for 45 pips. GJ is still holding stong hoping to go down soon.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
A lot of people told me that signals come very late with Chin indicators. I originally made it to follow the strong trend, but if we trade intraday on 15m TF then yes the signals will be coming late. So I modified my code today to make 2 new indicators. Please test these 2 indicators (Chin-c, Chin-D) for next week and let me know how it works. NOTE: ALL ORIGINAL RULES REMAINS SAME. AS SIGNALS WILL COME EARLY IN THESE INDICATORS PLEASE OPEN TRADE ON NEXT CANDLE AND SEE TO IT THAT INDICATORS STAY ABOVE OR BELOW THE DEFINE LEVEL. Please dont discard chin-A&amp;B, I am back-testing and seeing how we can integrate them as filters. If the new indicators test successfully I will update my 1st post.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
What levels do we use? I applied 1500 and -1500 on EUR/USD but the indicators values are currently 43 and 27 give or take. Or are these meant to be used with a zero line instead? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
thank s Pash78... i will test this 2 indicators

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Pash thanks - will test these and feed back to you. Until next week - have a good weekend all

--- 帖子 #386 ---
15 and -15 for EU,GU,AU and 1500 and -1500 for EJ,GJ. Please read first post all rules remains same.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
Thank -- yes it give better signal -- much earlier than A and B

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Hello Frinds... Attached Image (click to enlarge) I found something interesting while I use chin in 1M ... I am not trading 1 Min ... Arun...

Thanks for the fantastic contributions Pat, and thanks Pash for the updates on the indy, Im going to do some experimenting and get back to you guys on monday If i have positive results in the chat room. Sorry havent been able to stick around much today, markets had moved quite a bit by London open so called it a day to sort out some personal things. See you guys in the chat on Monday and we'll hopefully have a great trading week this week lets hope Thanks again Pat and Pash.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Thanks Pat!

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Please someone write an alert with email for chin c and d!! I have been looking at some exit strategies for this system. Was looking at closing half once profit is at 20 pips and moving the SL to breakeven then. Also looked at placing levels of 50 and -50 on the indicators and closing a long if one touches the 50 level and a short if one touches the -50 (closing the half that is still open after partial close at 20 pips) Also was noticing that you may be able to use divergence with your indicator. I noticed a few patterns and it may be something worth exploring.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Here you go, please see attached EA's for alerts and e-mails. Yes you can use divergence with these indicators. If you see something coming up please post charts. Its US holiday tomorrow, I guess all the movement will be Asia today.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
caught the 60 pip moves on EU and EJ tonight, exited when one of the chin-stars hit +50.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Hey good trade, I took the EU one but closed @ 40 pips, had to go out, but now see the move above 80 pips. GU also had a good move, see the charts.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
SELL on GU. 6450 is 1st support area.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
target 1 reached, also Short on GJ from 134.00, 133.50 is the first support.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Hello Friends I test all the chin indicators, i trade live acount in 15M charts.. and for me the best indicators are Chin A and Chin C.. i use chin A to enter long position and Chin C to close Cheers LVRocha

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Thanks LV, Can you also tell how you enter and exit, I mean at what levels of these indicators?

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Hi Pash78 i trade like that: chinA cross up Level15(eur,gbp,chf) go for long and exit when chinC cross down Level15... and the same for Short positions in level -15. and i never put orders between this levels.. i wait i allready trade in CFD market and use this indicators to put orders

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Thanks LV, Also try the other way round, Like to buy when ChinC Cross 15 and close on ChinA crossing 15. Chin-C computes lower values, so if signal comes on Chin-C first it is generally a longer trade. If Signal comes on Chin-A first its is already an established trend.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
For me this 2 indicators are very... very usefull thank Pash for sharing this

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Ok I am not a big Fan of predicting TOP and Bottom for a pair and placing trade based on that, but took a Short on EU today based on Divergence on Chin A &amp; B. I used 1 Hr TF. Shorted at 4432, 25 pips from todays high, SL at 4462, booked some profit at 4372 for 60 pips and left the other lot open with SL at BE. Lets see how it goes. I did demo trade on GU yesterday with divergence and see that trade is close to 160 pips.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
EU closed another part lot @ 4328 for 104 pip, 4320-4300 is support area if that breaks say hello to 4270-4260.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Another possible divergence trade today, shorting EU with small lot and 30 pip SL.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
4405 is support area, and imp level for EU, Also was short on GU based on ChinA-B 15 min TF.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Pash which indicators are u using now Chin?

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Actually using all 4, sometime signal come early on C-D, some time early on A-B, If signal come first on A-B then it is generally a re-entry on an already established trend, so I open small lot. If it comes first on C-D then its reversal and can get more pips. EU short today was based on divergence on Chin A-B on 1hr TF.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Closed part lot for 4406 for 52 pips. 4400 is imp level to break. Closed GU for 6310.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
New Greece Plan pushing up the Euro closed the remaining lot. will look for another setup now.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
OMG..... my mt4 crash...

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Check MT4 build version, it needs to be Build 392 and higher. this was mention in the earlier post.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Shorted EU again at 4487 SL 4517. Small lot.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
ooo tq... you have mq4 sir?

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Made 10% today on early eu and gu long, signals from chin CD combo.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Hi, Thanks for the feedback, yes Chin C&amp;D gives early signals. I will be updating rules for entry and SL again this weekend. Did anyone else used C&amp;D?

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Watch EU, EJ pair post NFP for signals. However please note we see wild whipsaws after NFP so if you are not comfartable with quick moves, stay out and wait for sometime.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Shorted EJ, based on ChinC-D, Shorted EU @4495 based on divergence. Lets see how it goes.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
4450 first support area for EU 4400 next.

--- 帖子 #422 ---
divergence how do u check that.....can we have some chart examples?

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Pair making new high but Chin indicators not making high. I generally enter when prices moves 25-30 pips from high, and put 30-35 pip SL. Once 30-35 pips in profit move SL to BE. Today after NFP EU made new high of 4529 but CHIN A&amp;B did not make high on 1H TF. When price started to move down shorted at 4495. 4450 was 1st support area, booked some profit and moved SL to BE. Price then bounced off the support and crossed 4500 again. Just mins later We had a buy signal on EU from CHIN-C_D on 15M TF i did not take it had to step out for some time.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Missed this nice 100 pip trade today

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Here are new RULES for CHIN C&amp;D (attached again below), please don't discard CHIN A&amp;B, use them as mention below: Rules for CHIN-C and D: IMP: USE ONLY 15 MIN or HIGHER TIMEFRAME, I USE 15 M. 1. Buy Alert = Any of the 2 indicator goes positive and hit define level (+1500 for GJ and EJ, +15 for GU and EU). 2. Actual Buy = The second indicator goes above the define level (+1500 for GJ and EJ, +15 for GU and EU). Take trade on OPEN of next Candle. 3. Sell Alert = Any of the 2 indicator goes negative and hit define level (-1500 for GJ and EJ, -15 for GU and EU). 4. Actual Sell = The second indicator goes below the define level (-1500 for GJ and EJ, -15 for GU and EU). Take trade on OPEN of next Candle. 5. Stop Loss for Buy = Both of the indicator moves below 1500 (for GJ and EJ) or 15 (For GU and EU). 6. Stop Loss for Sell = Both of the indicator moves above -1500(for GJ and EJ) or -15 (For GU and EU). 7. Exit = This is where you need some expertise, you have to close partial lots at each fib level, nearest support and resistance and let the other lot ride. IMP: 1. If signals come first on ChinC-D than Chin A-B, then it is trend reversal and more chances of bigger trade. 2. If signals come first on ChinA-B or CHIN A-B are already above/below the defined levels and then signal comes on CHIN-C-D then it is re-entry on already established trend, use small lots. 3. Avoid signals coming on late Friday say after 11AM EST. 4. If signals is generated late afternoon in any session dont risk much, trade with small lot. 5. Do not take signals before any major news. 6. Strictly follow the stop loss rule. 7. Book small profits as you ride the trend. 8. USE ATTACHED EA for ALERTS AND EMAILS FROM THESE INDICATORS. PLEASE NOTE YOU NEED MT4 BUILD 392 or HIGHER TO USE THESE INDICATORS.

--- 帖子 #426 ---
I just want to reiterate, that i have put levels of 50 and -50 (5000 and -5000 for ej and gj) and have been using those for exits if one of the indicators touches them. It doesn't always get there so you do have to watch for other exit opportunities, but if price does get to those levels, it is usually a 60 to 80 pip trade. Those are nice at 1% per 10 pips.

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Possible shorts on EU EJ

--- 帖子 #428 ---
If 6350 breaks on GU 6320 next.

--- 帖子 #429 ---

Yes GU, EU and EJ short. EU,EJ short closed for small loss. GU fetched 40 pips. Here is chart for GU. Euro is quite today, may be will have good movement soon. Still undecided on direction.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
There was a EU EJ sell few mins back, if you guys are in that trade the 4550 is support area for EU and 116.50 for EJ.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Hey Pash here is my way to manage a trade edit: this is gj, but same was in ej today

--- 帖子 #435 ---
how do i set the ea to send me an email ?

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Hi, For e-mail you need to setup SMTP on your MT4 platform. There are some good links on forexfactory forums, here is one of them: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=294854

Thanks Felix, will explore it.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
No No sorry I meant there were no trades today in US session with Chin Indicators.

--- 帖子 #447 ---
but very nice trades in uk, hope y got some pips

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Dear pash , how 2 read the 2nd arrow ? http://i54.tinypic.com/1ffcyb.png

--- 帖子 #449 ---
First arrow is the real signal to go long, both indicators came from -ve territory. Second one is re-entry signal, arrow appeared as chin-d changed from less than 15 to more than 15 momentarily. For re-entry u can either ignore or enter with small lot. Also note that second signal appeared after the end of London session. So its off-peak time. It is best to ignore re-entry signals in off peak time.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
ThankQ Pash ... clear explanation , u rock ... Have a Gr8 Day !!!

--- 帖子 #451 ---
If EU short signal comes, please note it has good support at 4650 area. If that support is broken then it will be a good short. 4700 is good resistance. Need to see what breaks first.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Hello Pash Good Morning

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Good Morning Arun.

--- 帖子 #454 ---
break of 4650 and there was short signal on Chin indicators. 4605 is first supprt area.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
If price bounce off this support and reach 4650 area again in US session, it will be good area to re-enter shorts again.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Price bounced off support. Looking for new setup now.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Good call Pash - I'm following this closely. I think we may also get some resistance around the 14592 take care

--- 帖子 #458 ---
yes personally I am looking for more downside till major support at 4530 area.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
Ok thanks.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
4550 is first support b4 4530.

EU EJ shorts for today.

--- 帖子 #463 ---

Yes its best to avoid signals after such long candles.

--- 帖子 #465 ---

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Around 60 on EU and 32 on EJ (enter late on EJ). Still holding small portion of EU to test 4550-4530 area

Hello @ll, my trade today with the strategy... dynel14

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Re-entry short signals on GJ/GU entered with small lot.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
4420 support area for EURO

--- 帖子 #480 ---
hi @ll

--- 帖子 #481 ---
if 4350 goes on EU then say hello to 4310.

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Sorry 4330 is support area.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Todays Shorts in US session. These were mainly re-entry signals. London session had the 1st SELL signals.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
@ pash, it looks like y ou dont trade chin A-B anymore?!

--- 帖子 #485 ---
I use them as reference, as I mention in those new rules. If Signal comes before on ChinA-B then ChinC-D or if ChinA-B are already above/below those levles and signal come on Chin C-D, then it is kind of re-entry on already established trend. I enter with small lot and look for early exit. Also use ChinA-B on higher TF to look for Divergence. Had very good short trade this week when EU was trying to test 4700 but chin A-B were not going higher.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
oki have a good weekend, see you next week in green pips Felix

--- 帖子 #487 ---
good weekend and green pips to you too and everyone.

--- 帖子 #488 ---
Hi Pash &amp; everyone, Thank for sharing the strategy and indicators, I have a question, since these indicators are based on volume, do they have different results on different brokers?

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Possible Buy on EU, EJ. Remember markets can be choppy today coz of European holiday. Trade cautiously.

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Not really, volume is small component of these indicators. Just compares value of previous bar. Entries might differ by few pips according to Vendor but not much. I use Better volume indi manually to judge my trades.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Staying out market looks choppy.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
No secret sauce here: ChinA is MACD(3,100) ChinB is MACD(3,200) ChinC is MACD(3,50) ChinD is MACD(3,34)

--- 帖子 #493 ---
I took the eu trade for +40

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Ok Thanks.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
if euro finds support and bounces above 4450 it might test 4505 today.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
4505 is resis 4460 support area

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Possible -- heading down

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Classic I hope you guys get in

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Hi Zamanib, Nice trade, good to see you here after so many days.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
4330 will be good position to short EU if it gets there.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
EU is in retrace mode, plus lots of Greece news coming out. 4165 is resistance area, If that is taken out 4220 is next.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
4165 taken it is support now. 4220 is next. There is still some resistance at 4190 levels from yesterday.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
thank

--- 帖子 #505 ---
4220 area target Reached. On the longer term I still feel EURO might go down more.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
As expected Euro went down from 4220.

--- 帖子 #507 ---
EU has resistance at 4320 closing longs here.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Nice EU long today 4320 was resistance.

--- 帖子 #509 ---
GU long.

--- 帖子 #510 ---
See the current support resistance of EU. If it happens to break the 4340 resistance area we might see a run up to 4400 with some resistance around 4380.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
As mentioned EU broke 4340 resistance and tested 4380. Interesting to see if it touches 4400.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
4291 is support and 4380 is resistance now. I think it will be the range for tonight till the news tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
If 4380 is taken out , we might see 4420 and 4450 area. For downside 4290 area needs to be broken for further downside.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
no breakthrough yet, guess it will wait till Homesales data, to find direction.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
4380 taken out but looks like some resistance here, closing part lot.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
EU touched 4420 and saw a little pullback, I closed another part. Still holding small portion , hoping to see 4450 area soon. SL is now 4375.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Just be careful during the Greece news at 5pm EST, we might see wild swings after the news. +ve Vote good for Euro but we can see a SELL off after the news.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
4370 good place to short.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Shorted EU

--- 帖子 #520 ---
As mentioned there was a quick sell off after news, and it broke the 4380 resistance. However it has not gone down as much, so closed part lot at 4357. Not sure if it will go down more tonight or will wait till FOMC tomorrow. Personally I feel Euro should go down.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Was there a signal then? My charts didn't show an EU short signal until a little over 2 hrs ago. BTW, this is probably one of the most underrated threads on FF. Hope I can eventually find time to trade 15m charts... day job gets in the way. Chin indicators are great - not only for signals to enter trades, but they help keep you out of bad trades too - during chop, etc.

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Market will be choppy till FOMC.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
EU has resistance at 4450 area. there was a Buy signal around 4412.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Thanks Jeff, The short trace yesterday was not based on Chin indicators but had a feeling that EU might SELL off after the Greece news. I felt it will be a major sell off but it was not the case.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
EU 4440 Resistance 4380 Support waiting for a break of these after the news conference. Caution there can be a whipsaw.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
4350-4360 support area from yesterday. Break of these will open test to 4300.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
targets 4305 1st. If 4300 area goes 4260 next.

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Closed part for 4310 for 66 pips, moved SL to 4355, waiting for 4300 to break.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Hey Pash thanks for these updates. The S/R levels you call out are spot on. I too agree that this system is great and this tread is undervalued. Excellent work and thank you.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
4158 support for EU , if it retraces it might touch 4220 -4250 area again. I dont think we will get any signals on Chin today.

--- 帖子 #531 ---
4158 taken out for now, 4070 area is next support.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
EU retraced quickly to 4220 area.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
There was a re-entry short signal on EU from 4227, Currently testing 4157 support area.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
4140 important support from yesterday. A close below this level today will see further downside next week.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
all strategies focus on entries, whereas EXITS could be the name of the game !!! regards .Hawk.

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Support resistance my friend are the best place to time your exits and move your stops. Here is a chart for today's EU trade. 4300 area resistance from Friday.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
One more example of resistance on EJ and a good exit point. Please note I attached 1H chart just to show resistance area, entry was based on 15M TF.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Finally had time (after work) and a good signal to trade the excellent Chin indicators. Closed out at +26, didn't want to be greedy...asian session and all.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
I would really like to have an ea to manage trades with these indicators. I would like to open trades manually, but then have my ea close the trades if either the trade hits the 15 or -15 side as a SL of the indicator or it hits level 50 or -50 as TP. I am using chin c and d only.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Please check your PM.

Chin indicators have expired. Why start a thread based on indicators that expire??

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Only Chin-A expired and because of this ChinComboAB doesn't work. But Chin-B, Chin-C, Chin-D and ChinComboCD work just fine, and for me, for example, only C and D are important.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Thank you, I thought they had expired also and removed them. I have since put them back on the charts to continue monitoring them. I like them. Nice and simple.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
my chin indi has been expired. Does anyone have a latest indi?

--- 帖子 #545 ---
And my chin indi has been expired. I asked by email why expired but until now have not received any response.

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Oh sorry I was away for a while. Also thought no one use it anymore, Here you go: Let me know if anyone needs Chin A&amp;B as well.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Thank you very much for your response, but unfortunately it does not work. The same message "The trial version expired has been expired! Please contact ........"

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Chinstar-Alert-EJ-GJ-CD-Ver3.ex4 and Chinstar-Alert-EU-GU-CD-Ver3.ex4, also does not work and gives the same message.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Hi, I was trying out A and B until they expired. If you could post working versions, that would be great, thanks

--- 帖子 #550 ---
See attached.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Try this.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Thanks!

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Thanks!

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Too bad the thread was active only for a couple of months. I was too busy in May-September to test it seriously, but it looks like a very good system, I decided to give it a try. Anybody care to share the results, no matter good, bad or ugly?

--- 帖子 #555 ---
I made some backtesting in Tradestation with MACD imitation of the Chin indicator with TP/SL 1:1 - 15p, 20p, 25p or 30p, and results are are poorly even, around 50% w/l. Tried then some optimization, but results was not much better in the long run.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
I meant the results from live trading, but thank you anyway.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Hey just wanted to thank you for the indicators, They are a asset to my tool box, Can't thank you enough!!! The only question I have is the Alert for the EJ and GJ have expired, do you plan to make that acsessable again, I hope so. Once again thanks and I hope this thread will go on. Sonny

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Oh looks like I copied wrong file, they should not have expired. Here you go, let me know if it works.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Pash, the Chin indis have expired as well. Do you plan to make these public again?

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Did u download the one in post 546 and 550 ?

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Thanks Pash Got it. Once again thank you for the work you put into these. I don't understand them, but they seem to work really well during peak hours. Sonny

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Chinstar-Alert-EJ-GJ-CD-Ver3.ex4 and Chinstar-Alert-EU-GU-CD-Ver3.ex4, also does not work and gives the same message. please attach new version thanks bro

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Hi Pash Are you still trading this system??

--- 帖子 #564 ---
use the macd instead, same results. For setting look in the thread, I don't remember it.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Chin-D indicator have expired. Why start a thread based on indicators that expire?? please set new vertion. thanks

--- 帖子 #566 ---
************************************ Chuck out CHIN Indicator at once with their " Expiration Stuff" . This is identical !! Use MACD from original MT4 indicator list so that you can enter price parameter . 1]Use = OPEN price parameter 2]Use MACD with the settings Fast EMA=3 , Slow EMA = 34 , MA CD SMA=1 [Chin D] 3] Kill the Histogram [No color] 4] Levels JPY pairs = +0.16 and -0.16 and zero All olther pairs = +0.0016 and -0.0016 and zero By kind input of others in the forum: ChinA is MACD(3,100,1) ChinB is MACD(3,200,1) ChinC is MACD(3,50,1) ChinD is MACD(3,34,1)

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Well done melco, 2 identical posts on 2 different threads, both dead. Or at least they are now that the death hand of melco has struck. Twee took no action over your complaint against me, so you'll have to do better than that. You maybe can't tell the difference between a scam and a trader, but plenty here can.

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Melco, this is it. Big thanks

--- 帖子 #569 ---
****************************** OK Mizifx !! *I am using the MACD [3,30,1] as Chin D replacement , together side by side with the CCI[60] with default levels 100, -100 , 200,-200 and zero. *Generally the CCI will get you in 1 bar earlier at least. They are very similar , but the CCI is regarded as a leading indicator by some traders. *Also turning on the Kijun in the Ichmoku provides extra support to readimg the price action.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
I saw your posts in this thread (BTW this is a very good and helping system). caliyn71 - could you please contact me (I'm from Romania too, but for the common sense I posted this in English).

Is the chin C and chin D same as chin A and chin B shown in the figure below

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Hi serigo, not really, but check yourself, put the two indi in same window.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
I don't see any horizontal lines as in chin A and chin B ,Will they appear automatically after the market begins or do I have to do something manually?

--- 帖子 #579 ---
You put manually, I think 1500, 0 and -1500.

--- 帖子 #580 ---
I used your indicators Chin C and Chin D in GBP JPY 30 M Time Frame and I placed the values 1500,0,-1500 the three horizontal lines appeared. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Whereas I used it in the EUR USD 30 M Time Frame and i also placed the values 1500,0,-150 but only one horizontal line appeared ie only the zero line. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Am I at fault or Is it correct?

--- 帖子 #204 ---
See post425. It's 1500,0 and -1500 for GJ, EJ. 15,0 and -15 for EU, GU.

--- 帖子 #205 ---
thanks

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Dear ... you could publish a template with all the indicators included, that way we only have to copy the indicators and when applying the template MT4 will load them, I also want to ask you if there is an indicator that has to be installed in a folder other than MQL4 &gt; Indicators so explain it in detail ... it would be very kind of you ... always very grateful.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
thanks for the help, i dowload on installing it unlike yours

--- 帖子 #208 ---
