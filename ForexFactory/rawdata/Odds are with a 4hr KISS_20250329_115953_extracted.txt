UPDATE: I don't use this method anymore, I have switched to a similiar 15minute method. I've been learning forex for four over years now, bouncing from one system to the next, multiple timeframes, indicators, etc...I think I've finally found something that fits me as a trader and can be profitable. Maybe it will for you too. I'd also like to say that my method is nothing new, it's just a collection of little tid-bits I've picked up here and there throughout my journey. Alright, so below will be the general setup and rules. And I use the word rules loosely because they aren't hard/strict rules to follow...more like guidelines. But in an ever changing market, one has to be flexible. What we are trying to do overall is put the odds of the trade in our favor in the simplest way possible on the 4hr chart...hence the title of this thread. Chart setup 1) I use the 4hr chart, I find it's more reliable (less noise) trading the higher timeframes...while still giving you a few good setups each week. 2) Plot a 20 lwma in whatever color you want (I use magenta). 3) Use a macd indicator with a histogram (I'll attach the one I found on ForexFactory at the bottom of this post). The standard settings and double them, so (24,52,18). Looking for Trades is as simple as 1-2-3... 1) PRICE ACTION ...basically I look to follow the current trend (higher highs &amp; higher lows = uptrend while lower lows &amp; lower highs = downtrend)...if the current(short term) trend matches up with the pairs overall trend...that's the best setup! Another thing with price action is just looking for simple candle patterns: engulfing, pinbar, tweezers, etc...that happen at prior support &amp; resistance areas. lastly, just drawing in some simple trendlines and/or channels 2) MOVING AVERAGES ...you want to trade at/near the 20 moving average ....the best setup is when you get a Price Action(PA) setup and the moving average is heading in the same direction(up for longs, down for shorts). ****the first version of this method had 3 moving averages on the chart...I have since modified and simplified it down to only 1...the 20lwma**** 3) MACD HISTOGRAM ...you want the macd histogram to be lined up and heading in the same direction as your PA and MA. This helps me see where momentum is going along with the first two guidelines. The best setups are when the histogram is on the correct side of the zero line( above the zero line for longs and below the zero line for shorts). That's really it...it's really just 1-2-3...PA, MA, MACD HISTOGRAM. Hopefully I didn't confuse you too much so far and now lets get to some examples... Pairs I Use This method has been tested on GU, EU, EJ, GJ, AU, pairs...I have NOT tested it on any others. And my best results have come from GU,EU, EJ. GJ can get a bit wild at times if you can stomach big swings/drawdown(I can't, so I avoid it). AU is pretty decent, but the first three have been very reliable and I tend to trade them most often. I've been watching the UJ too...but this pair is tricky because some weeks it barely moves at all...other weeks it's great to trade! Money Management ( word of caution...this is what works for me...please feel free to adjust your Target Prices and Stoplosses for what suits you). 1) I set an initial emergency stop loss of 100pips in case the market does something weird like surprise news from a country or if you lose power for a while...at least you won't blow your account. 2) My Target price is set at 75pips for pairs with higher Average Daily Ranges(GU, EJ, GJ) and 50pips for pairs with smaller ADR's(EU, AU)! I often see price run for 70-100pips or more on good setups...but right now, I'm looking for more consistent winners. This may be adjusted with further forward testing. 3) You should exit your trade on the first candle that closes on the opposite side of your entry candle if your Target Price has not been hit. With the proper entry, your losses should be around 60pips or less. 4) Stay away from HUGE candles...typically you want to enter on candles that are 50pips or less...give or take a few pips. As you can see, with a proper entry...my risk-reward is roughly 1:1! Attached below is the template I use for my MT4 charts.

211, Thanks for sharing your charts. They are amazingly close to mine. Timeframe and everything. Excellent validation. You use the "wrong" colours though. lol. what i see is these "setups" jump off the page at me. getting to see them real time is what took the effort for me. Scottie

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Hi and thanks for sharing, Looks interesting, will demo for a while and see what comes of it.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Sounds great! Please post some charts and ask any questions you might have. To be honest, I was getting worried that this post had over 500 views and only 1 post before yours! I was affraid I might not have explained things well enough or perhaps it just wasn't something people were interested in. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #10 ---
500 views and one post is because it's too simple.. yet flexible at the same time. Most traders look for hard setups (ones who don't always understand PA has to be a bit flexible) with 20 indicators and 10 ma's Looks good to me.. I use same ma's on h4 and h1 with stochs instead of macd.... and it's been very good to me... to each his own.... Looks good.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Hi! Thx for sharing simple system.. How long did you trade with it? What is your target (amount of pips) weekly? Best regards, Noisee.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Nice chart explanations! Just want to clarify the exit rule. Assuming there is a bullish entry signal, do you mean you'd exit on the first candle which closes below the low of the entry candle (if the 50 pips target has not reached by then)? And what's your winning ratio with this ~1:1 reward:risk ratio?

--- 帖子 #13 ---
The short answer...I look for 100pips a week as my goal. Basically 2 good trades. The longer answer...when I was first learning forex and trading, I had the usual beginners dreams...make lots of pips and lots of money. Of course that equated to lots of losses and some blown accounts. Therefore I have lowered my goals/expectations a lot and try to keep it simple and profitable because now I understand the value of keeping money in your account so you can always "trade another day." Also, the 100pips a week goal is just that...a Goal, not a "MUST MAKE" level. Some weeks I might only make 60pips or 20pips or even lose 50pips. Other weeks I might get 200pips! It all averages out in the long run. I will tell you though, if I happen to hit 200pips profit in a week I stop trading and enjoy the rest of the week off. Cheers! P.S. I almost forgot about your first question...I have been trading this particular method for a little more than 6 months now and found it to be quite successful. But you must stay disciplined and patient for the proper setups!

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Hi fthingf, I have included a chart that might help explain the exit rule a little better. However, I would like to point out that the rules are more like guidelines...they are a little flexible and if you see a couple reasons to exit a trade sooner, by all means do. It's a fine line between holding trades too long and/or closing too early. Just how I like to have 3 or more reasons to get into a trade, if I start to get a few reasons that tell me to exit, I will exit too! Cheers!

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Speaking of EU in my previous post...I saw this setup early today, but waited to post it to give you guys a chance to possible post it before me. Hope someone caught it!

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Thx for reply! Best regards, Noisee.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Thanks! You explained it very clearly. Using the same example that you included here, is the exit candle actually a good signal to go short as well?

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Good eye fthingf! I was using that chart just as an example of exiting a losing trade, didn't even notice that you could go short there! You are correct. It's a great looking bearish engulfing candle that tried to push above the 20ma but ultimately closed below...With the overall down trend &amp; ma's crossed down &amp; macd histogram sloping down(barely). Side note: I went back and looked at the chart again on MT4, you can't really see it on the chart I posted, but that short candle setup...the actual candle is 68pips big...add a 3pip spread and you are looking at a possible loss of 70pips or more. That is getting near my upper limit of comfort. The best trades are with candles that are 50pips or less...this helps keep our money management in line with a 1:1 risk/reward ratio. Have a good day!

--- 帖子 #19 ---
An interesting trading system. Particularly useful are the charts. TwOeleven, have you kept any records over the last 6 months and do you wait for the entry candle to close before entering.? Have you tried it on the daily charts? Keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hi Justice, I do keep weekly records of how many trades I take each week(winners/losers) and the profit/loss for that week. Unfortunately I don't think it would be fair to post the results because I did take some experimental trades not based on the rules of this system so the data is skewd a little. Also, I think it's important that each trader keeps their own stats and makes their own opinion about this method because, I'm sure you know, you can have 5 traders looking at the same chart and you could have 5 different opinions! One more thing to note...I like to consider the trade setup guidelines(1-2-3) just as that...guidlines. They are meant to be flexible and as such, some traders will get trades that other don't. I just hope some will like this method and it will help them in their journeys. As for trading this on the daily charts...I have actually looked at the daily charts. It seems valid overall. Just a couple differences...the setups come a lot less often. AND the biggest thing, you would dramatically increase your risk because you would need a bigger stoploss and the candles would be bigger. It would require extreme patience waiting for the setups AND you'd probably have to reduce the lot size you would trade on the 4hr charts. On the positive side of things...your trading would probably be less stressful and you'd only have to check the charts once or twice a day! For me, the 4hr charts are great...but if someone wants to try the daily...I'd say go for it! To each his own.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
I thought I would post this GU chart as an example of when NOT to take a trade. Earlier I posted the EU short setup...and some people might think the GU is about to do the same thing(so they think, I might have missed the EU so I'm going to get in on the GU)...but Not So Fast my friends. Make sure you stay true to the guidelines of this method...look for the BEST setups and skip the not so good one(or ones you have doubts about). It will save your account in the long run! Wanted to add one more thing about this candle...it's 100pips big! That is pretty high risk, as previously mentioned...I prefer candles around 50pips or less. I occasionally will enter on a bigger candle if the conditions look GREAT and if price is about 1/3rd to 1/2 of the way into the candle to reduce the risk.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Hi Two, Nice thread. On this particular trade where was stop placement....above the 4hr pin ? Thanks,Tex

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Hi Tex, I always set an emergency stop loss 200pips above/below my entry price. That's in case some wild happens you protect your account from disater should it strike. Assuming you aren't tradin too heavy to begin with or over leveraging yourself! But that's the only stop loss I set...after I enter a trade, then I just check each candle close after that(every 4hr hours...gives you free time to do other things)...if price closes above/below the candle you entered on...then you just MANUALLY exit for whatever the loss is...typically 50pips or less. In this example, the top of the entry candle was 1.3778, so if you can any of the candles after your entry candle close above 1.3778, you would have closed at that level. So in this instance your entry was at 1.3739 and lets saw the next candle might have closed at 1.3800...you would have lost 61pips + spread. On the flip side...after setting the emergency stoploss I set a 50pip target price. So when you come back every 4hrs to check the charts you either 1) have reached your Target 2) have a candle that closed against you so you exit manually or 3) neither of the above occur and you just evaluate if the entry rules still apply and stay in the trade another 4hrs. But if the entry rules changed(say the ma's turned against you) then you exit for a small profit/loss. In the EU example, it would have taken 3 candles to reach 50pips profit! Side note...this trade is near the upper limit of what I feel my risk should be...you were risking 60pips or so for a 50pip reward...that's just under a 1:1 risk/reward. You never want to get more than 2:1 risk/reward. Hope that helps Tex!

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Thanks Two, That cleared it up because i was wondering about the 200 pip stop. I think it's possible to get a 3 to 5% return a month even with a lot size reduction ...and depends on consisitency like you said.I'll be keeping my eye out and post some charts if i see some potential setups. It looks solid. Thanks again. Tex

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Hi Tw0eleven, talking about emergency stop loss I do need some advice. What if you've entered a trade but you know you can't sit in front of the computer to monitor the trade when the next 4hr signal comes? Do you leave the 200 pips emergency stop in place until you can check price again, or would you tighten the stop before you leave your PC? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
I want to make sure I understand your question correctly...are you asking me what happens when the next 4hr "Candle" closes or the next "4hr signal comes" as you stated? With regards to the 4hr candle close: If you can't come back to check your chars when the next 4hr candle closes...then the decision is up to you really. You can leave the emergency 200pip stop in place and just check the charts next chance you get(this is typically what happens if you feel you took a really good trade setup that fit all the guidelines). Another option would be perhaps move your stoploss from 200 to say 150 or even 100(just in case the market turns around on you...you'd be protecting your account a little more). And the last option would be to just exit the trade and take whatever profit/loss you have at that time if you won't be able to check the charts for a long period of time. With regards to what you asked me...."can't sit in front of your computer to monitor the stop before the next 4hr signal comes"...well, to be honest with you, I NEVER sit in front of my computer waiting for the next signal. I like to just check the charts for a few minutes prior to the 4hr candle close to see if anything is setting up to trade. Then, when the candle closes if there is a trade setup...I enter the trade and then walk away and check back later. Hope that helps...let me know if you have any other questions. On a side note...it's FRIDAY! I typically don't enter any trades on Friday because I like to have 3day weekends from trading. Let my mind unwind and spend time with the family. So on that note...Have a great weekend everyone!

--- 帖子 #27 ---
I mean when the next 4hr candle closes...sorry for the confusion. I know everyday there is at least one candle which I can't check - while I am asleep! Thanks for the detailed reply. Have a good weekend too!

--- 帖子 #28 ---
I know exactly what you mean. I live in the EST timezone so I'm usually sleeping during London Open. If I happen to enter a trade before I go to bed, I set an alarm to get up about 5minutes before next candle close. If it's a good candle close, I go back to bed. If it's a bad one, I close and go back to bed. Whole process shouldn't take more than 10-15minutes. Might be something you can try...or just don't enter any trades before you go to bed. No need to force any trades...just trade when you can.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Well everyone, you may have recalled this post where I recommended not jumping into the trade. And while price did continue down(as you can see by the chart posted below)...I wouldn't call myself wrong. Instead, I hope you guys see things in a different perspective. I wouldn't call it wrong to skip this trade, wasn't scared, wasn't nervous...instead, think of it as being Cautious and Reducing Risk. Afterall, you are trading to make money right? Not lose it! Now some may disagree with what I said above...but this is how I think of it. If I would have jumped in this trade and won, then what about the next trade that comes along like this...what if I jump in that one and take a loss? Then another one comes along and I say, "well, I have a 50/50 win/loss ratio so far on these trades...maybe I'll try one more." Oops, another loss! Well my friends, you just lost 2 out of 3 trades because you took trades that really weren't that good in the first place. And now you might be pissed at yourself or the market or worst yet, you think this method is flawed and doesn't work. That's definitely not good for the mental aspect of trading. So what's the worst that can happen if you skip the trade? Well, you missed out on 50pips...your account balance is the same and you are just looking for the next trade. I really don't see much wrong with this option. If truly believe it's the successful traders who pick this option! Hope everyone is having a good weekend so far!

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Hi Tw0eleven, I was going to ask you a question on the same chart but then saw your post! Now I understand the reasons that you skipped the pin bar signal on post #21. Then on Friday I noticed a big bearish candle (annotated with a green arrow below) and I thought to myself this could probably be a valid entry signal: 1. Price has closed below both the 5ema and 20ema 2. The 5ema is about to cross below the 20ema 3. MACD is sloping down 4. The signal bar is a bearish engulfing candle However since the candle size is too large (&gt;80 pips), this trade would be a pass. Just for illustration purpose - assuming the candle size was within your risk limit, do you think it's a good signal and would you have taken the trade? I actually know you'll still say no, as it's a Friday!

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Good chart and Good eye my friend! Everything you mentioned above I agree with and it would have been a nice entry candle if it wasn't greater than 80pips. As for it being friday...I just personally don't like to trade on Friday but that doesn't mean you can't trade it! To be honest, I have seen some Friday candles that work out great(you might have to hold over the weekend though). One of my reasons for not trading on Friday is that in my experience I never know if the trends will continue or if traders will stop trading(lose momentum) getting ready for the weekend or if traders will take profits and the trend will reverse. But again, that's just me...and I also like 3 days weekends(from tradin)! haha One more thing...I do have a second setup on the 4hr method that I have been holding off on because I wanted to see how many people were interested in trading this method and getting the first setup down before introducin the second. However, it seems that you are doing pretty well with the first so I will explain the second. We will use the same chart of GU from friday. You correctly pointed out the bearish engulfing candle along with 5/20 crossing down and macd histogram sloping down...Only problem, the entry candle was too big. How do you solve that? Well, you wait for a pullback at/near the 5/20 ma's!!! In this case, the next candle, as you can see, pulled back to the 5ma(1.5188) which was very close to the 20ma. That's where you would have gone short. This would greatly reduce your risk should the trade end up going against you! Also, you have a couple things workin in your favor: 1) the price would have to reverse against the currnet trend which isn't always easy 2) price would have to fight it's way back through the Movings Averages, also not always easy to do and 3) Since you are trading the 4hr charts, it usually takes a while for macd to turn around...another not so easy thing to do. So in this example: you would have went short on the pullback oof the candles AFTER the bearish engulfing one with your entry approximately 1.5180ish. The top of the Bearish engulfing candle was 1.5153...thus giving you an approximate risk of about 80pips if the candle closed against you. That's within my personal limit of 2:1 risk/reward. Side note: Personally, on GU I like to look at a few key areas for price to stall at, the 00's, 20's, 50's, 80's(ex: 1.5200, 1.5220, 1.5250, 1.5280). With EU and EJ I mainly look at the 00's and 50's. Also, if you are going to use this second entry method...you will need to be available to look at your charts since you'll never know exactly when price is goint pullback for your entry. If your platform allows it, you can also set alarms that way you are still able to do things around the house without having to be glued to the computer screen. I know I just gave a lot of information...if any of it needs clarification, please let me know. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #32 ---
While I'm still waiting for a good setup, though I would post what I see so far. Below you can see that all 4 pairs have been trending down pretty nicely, but what's missing? The normal pullback you get with the market. But one may be coming??? You can see where I have the yellow circles, the price candles stopped making new lows and actually have started to higher/above the previous candles. There's plenty of room to move up to the 20ma which is where I would expect price to go price can close above the 5ma. And it appears that macd histogram is starting to form a "round" bottom..thus the momentum down is slowing and might turn up for a little while. Of course, I could be wrong with all of this too...who knows? We never know 100% in this market...we just try to put the odds in our favor. So in conclusion...price has dropped pretty far without a pullback and appears to be losing momentum down...so I'm waiting before taking any more shorts. And there is still nothing lined up for longs yet...so still waiting. I'll take a look at the candle close at 8am EST...but right now, it looks like I'll have the rest of the morning free to do some other things.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Wow, thanks for the additional bonus! Next time I'd know how to handle when a similar signal appears. By the way, I don't mind trading on Fridays though I don't like holding a trade through weekend! Now that I've learned quite a bit about this method, it's time to let the material sink in and do some practising. Will see how it goes!

--- 帖子 #34 ---
I still don't see anything on GU or GJ. As for EU and EJ...it appears they both sold off from their highs in the final hour of the candle close. They could be condsidered bearish engulfing candles...in a downtrend with the ma's pointing down. However, there are two things I don't like...1) price didn't make a new low, but did make a new high compared to the previous candle 2) macd histogram seems to be flattening out and/or turning up(meaning the selling has started to lose momemtum). So since there are a couple things I don't like...I'm skipping any trades right now. Practicing a little patience and waiting for the Higher Probability trades. The choice is always yours of course, it's your trading account. I learned my lesson before making some beginner mistakes and blowing accounts.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Excellent, good luck to you! And please, post some charts and keep asking questions if you have any. Also, I don't like holding over the weekend either. So if I happen to trade on a Friday, it's usually during London or early US session that way I can close before the market closes Friday afternoon! As a friend of mine says..."May the pips be with you"

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Well, it does appear I missed out on the shorts. On the positive side, at least I didn't go long and take a loss right? Protect your account...live to trade another day!

--- 帖子 #37 ---
211, I actually only trade pullbacks. unfortunately, this keeps me from taking certain types of trades. and i only get a hand full of trades per week on the h4, but, they are usually good. A couple of these usually occur when i'm asleep. Teaching yourself to go long when the market has seemingly reversed and starting to look short can be cause for consternation. however, it greatly reduces the risk.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Thanks Scottie, I hope others read this(especially newbies) and take away from it that you can never been too cautious. Better to save your account and miss a good trade then blow your account by taking bad ones(not too good setups)...Patience and discipline usually rewards you in this market!

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hi Tw0Eleven, Thanks for sharing your strategy. Is this a valid entry on this USDCHF chart? I entered just below the crossover of the 5 and 20mas. Thanks. PS.: Added the image as an attachment. Hope it works.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
I apologise if this question has already been answered, but what do you use the 200ema for?

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Hi Jack Daniel, To be honest, I've never traded this method on the USDCHF pair. So I'm not sure how well it works on that pair. But as far as your analysis...it looks pretty good. You had a nice bearish engulfing candles where price touched/bounced off the 200ma. And the 5/20ma crossed down AND you spotted Divergence on the macd histogram. So nice work on that. However, there are a couple things that stick out to me: 1) that bearish engulfing candle is nearly 100pips big...so right away you are risking a lot on that trade...I hope you traded a little lighter than normal. 2) price is technically still trending up because it's making HigherHighs and HigherLows...so you'll want to watch this carefully. Perhaps draw a trendline in there. All in all...not a bad trade. I just see a couple things that could cause price to go up as well as down. So just keep monitorin it...if price closes back above the ma's and/or the ma's cross back up and/or macd starts going higher again...perhaps get out of the trade? Goodluck and thanks for posting your chart!

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Good question, no one has asked it so far. I basically keep the 200ema on my charts to see possible turning points on price action. I can't recall off the top of my head exactly, but I believe the 200ma was voted the most useful indicator in forex. Gives a good idea of which way price is trending overall. Also, you'll see a lot of times price likes to go up to and touch or get close to the 200 only to be rejected pretty well. Could help you look to get into a trade if you see the other entry criteria as well. Also, if I see price hanging around the 200ma...and/or the 5&amp;20 ma going up and down around the 200...i tend to stay away from the market because it's usually choppy. I like to see price moving away from the 200 usually meaning we are getting into a trend again...which is very helpful and profitable with this method. Hope that clears up things and let me know if you have any more questions.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Yes that clears it up. Thank you for taking the time to answer.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
You know, when I first read about your strategy, the "scary" part was about money management - target 50 pips but with an emergency stop of 200 pips and manual exit upon a candle in the opposite direction. Yet this is also pretty innovative and is something which I haven't quite heard about before. I can see the advantages of this exit method - avoid being stopped out prematurely because of market noise or stop hunting. Now after reading the above comments you made in post #31, it appears to me that this strategy is not so scary after all.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Anytime...Happy Trading!!! Yes, the 200pip emergency stoploss is scary to most. But imho, it rarely gets hit if you 1) follow the guidelines of this system and 2) definitely don't trade during major news releases like NonFarmPayroll or Interest Rates, etc... If you see you entered a bad trade or get out of a good trade when it goes against you, then your actual loss is typically 50pips or less. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Good morning sir, I just wanted to follow up on your trade. I just looked at the charts and it appear that price did go higher and close above the 5&amp;20ma's. So hopefully you closed and took the small loss. I say small, bc it looks like your entry should have been about 1.0580 and exit about 1.0605 plus spread...net loss of about 25-30pips. Not too big...1 winning trade could easily make that up. Although it was a loss, hopefully you got some experience out of it! Cheers!

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hi Tw0Eleven, It was a demo account so no worries there. I closed it as soon as you said to close if the price had closed above the averages. Thanks for the input.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Cool...glad to see you testing a new system out on a demo first. No need to risk money on any type of system if it's new to you. Also, for anyone else reading this thread...I only look at/trade this method on GU, EU, EJ, GJ, AU, UCad.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Not much going on at the beginning of this week...maybe they are saving it for the second half. Time to practice some patience...let the trades come to you!

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Hi Tw0eleven, I actaully found an entry signal on AUD/USD. Not sure if my reasonings are correct: 1. Price is making higher low and higher high 2. A bullish pin bar closed above both 5 and 20 ema 3. 5 ema has just crossed the 20 4. MACD is sloping up to flat However I was sleeping when the signal candle appeared, so I wait until the close of the next candle. Although it's a bearish candle, it still closed above both the 5 and 20 ema and best part is it gave me a better entry (around 0.9183)! The price seems not going anywhere since then. Will see how it goes...

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Nice chart and yes, it seems to fit all the guidelines. Unfortunately some report come out last night where Portugal had it's credit rating downgraded and that killed the Euro...and brought down some other pairs as well( Dollar strength). So I'm assuming you exited your trade about 2 candles later when price closed below 5&amp;20ma and the 5/20 were crossing back down. Looks like you may have lost about 20-25pips??? Not the profit we were looking for...but also not a big loss either! Good work on the chart reading...too bad some unexpected news may have ruined the trade

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Yes I exited at 0800 GMT as you mentioned, for a loss of 18 pips. A good practicing exercise though. Well unexpected things do happen, will just look for the next opportunity!

--- 帖子 #53 ---
fthingf, that's normally what i do, i wait for the next bar to pull back to the ma's, i use 21, but no biggie. it appears to do it most of the time. if it doesn't, the move is suspect to me. it also minimizes the risk when i exit on the close on the wrong side. here again, if it doesn't break the low of the close on the wrong side, i exit on the touch of the ma's and if it looks like a reversal, i'll reverse. Scottie

--- 帖子 #54 ---
ok, guys, here is a possible trade setup on ej, have to see where it closes in 3 hours and then i'll wait for the pullback. the other reason i'm interested in this is the eu looks like capitulation to me and could bounce a bit, pushing ej higher. i'll reanalize this in 3 hours. this is a very slow system, with h4. keep in mind the other pairs have to give you a reason to take the trade or its a no go. if i decide to pull the trigger, though, i do not hesitate. Scottie

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Exactly! The sooner traders can understand that they will have losses, nothing is 100% in forex and how to deal with the losses...the sooner they are to their goals! Cheers!

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Hi Scottie, just want to clarify your points. Are you referring to entry here? I'm assuming that once there's an entry signal, you'll not enter at the opening price of the next candle, but wait for price to pull back to the 21 first? Do you mean when there's an exit signal, you'll again wait for price to pull back to the 21 instead of closing right away? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
yes to both, if i get a signal long here on ej, i will wait for the pullback and then pounce. but on the exit, if i can wait to the ma's i will but its not always possible

--- 帖子 #58 ---
apparently, i missed the pullback since my charts now close at 11 central instead of 10 central. will wait for next one. it will happen no matter what time it is just that if i like to trade the us session, i'd prefer if my charts shifted with the time change.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Hey Scottie, Did you happen to enter on the EJ pullback last night? I see it went right to the 20ma, stalled and then went up over 80pips so far!!! Easily was a low risk, 50pip winning trade! Hope you got it.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Hi Tw0eleven, I saw that pullback too. But at the same time the 5ema was crossing back to the 20 and the MACD was sloping down, so I decided to skip. I was thinking to enter after the last bullish candle, but again the candle size seems a bit large (&gt;60 pips)....

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Well, definitely nothing wrong with skipping a trade(can't hurt your account). It's a shame MACD was sloping down or it would have been a Great Setup! Here's one of those situations where some traders would take the trade and some skip it...and that's my main reason for not posting any results on my account! My account means nothing to all other traders because we all take/skip trades for our own reasons. I also agree with you skipping entering the trade after the big bullish candle...way too much risk! Not until a trader gets REALLY comfortable with their trading style and method should you consider taking trades on bigger candles...and IF you do, at a smaller lot size. Keep up the good work fthingf...seems like you are doing great! I hope we get some more traders like you in here so we can have more discussions. Also hope we get some good action next week since this week was REALLy slow!

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Tw0eleven, just got my first successful trade on EUR/USD! The signal appeared at 0400 GMT. It's a small bullish pin, with 5ema cross above 20ema and MACD sloping up. Exit at the very next candle with 50 pips. A good start for the week!

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Way to go fthingf! I was just about to post this trade and then saw your comment. Congrats!!!! Just try to remember to be patient and wait for setups like this...skip the marginal ones and avoid trading because you get bored! 90% mental trading is! Keep up the good work!

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Well, the trades don't get much better than this! Not only did we have our 1-2-3 guidelines met...there were some bonus reasons for this long trade on EU. So lets go over them: 1) PA gave us a pinbar 2) 5/20 ma had just crossed 3) Macd histogram was sloping up 4) Macd Histo was also going above the zero line(makes the trade that much better) 5) Macd moving average lines(Number 4 in the chart) were crossing up...another bonus 6) You can see 2 trendlines I drew(yellow lines) were broken to the upside 7) We opened this week with a Gap that filled nicely down to the 20ma and got rejected to form our pinbar. How many more reasons do you need to go long????

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Hello to the 4 Hour KISS gang -- I am a fellow H4 trader. I have been using a somewhat similar system, but there are several nice things here, so especially to 211 a hearty 'THANKS.' I have read the full forum but am still doing some digesting. Could I take fthingf's recent post 62? I am wondering about your entry. Could you have come in a little sooner or were you waiting for the (small) pullback to the line? I think I see the 1-2-3 we're looking for a bar or two sooner. Perhaps I am not being demanding enough with the shape of the PA. (it wouldn't be the first time. . . ) I imagine several of you could field this question (above) for me. Also, for Forum Czar 211, I see you would like to get a couple of good 50 pip trades a week, and, of course, each week is different. I suppose my question is over your 6 months of trading the H4 KISS I would have guessed you would have found more than two good set-ups a week. It may be that number shrinks with your preference to GU, EU and EJ. I would suspect other pairs will/do work quite well with this system, though. I hope to go along on the ride with you all. Thanks for your sharing to this point, and every success in your trading. Forest

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Welcome aboard Forest-Sea! I'm sure fthingf will have to answer your first question...but I'm guessing he entered right when the candle closed to form the PB(pinbar) since there was no signal prior to that. In my opinion, since the PB candle was only 30pips big, I would have entered right away and NOT waited for the pullback. However, if the PB candle was bigger than 50-60pips...waiting for price to pullback would be the better option in order to reduce your risk on the trade.(and a side note...if price didn't pullback for you...then OH WELL...you missed a trade and move on to the next). As for your second question. Sometimes there are more than 2 setups a week...maybe 4,5,6 on a really good week. The choice is up to you on how much you trade. Personally, my goal is about 100pips a week. Sometimes I get it, sometimes I don't. I do place a limit on myself...if I ever reach 200pips(and I have on occasion)...I stop trading for the week and take some extra time off! I think it's important not to overtrade and take some time to yourself away from the chart to go do some fun things! Let me know if you have any more questions and hope you enjoy the h4 method! Please post some charts some time.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Your guess is spot on! Forest-Sea, that pin bar is the first valid PA bar that I see after the MAs cross and the MACD signal. I wasn't waiting for pullback to the 5ema (not sure if that's what your were referring to?)

--- 帖子 #68 ---
OK, thanks to you both. I think my problem must be what qualifies as an appropriate (PA) bar? Are we saying it must be the list presented in post #1 exclusively? That is, a bar we can specifically put a name on, say BUOB (whatever), that is consistent with the trade direction we are considering? For instance, a marching up line of let's say small candles might not specifically qualify . . . is this right? (although they might be providing HHs and HLs, for instance) I admit when I saw the MACD bars rising and the 5 X 20 in a clear uptrend, I would have jumped in long but evidently prematurely using your more rigorous qualifying standards. Set me straight. With appreciation in advance for your thinking, Forest

--- 帖子 #69 ---
All right KISS stars. What do you think about the U.Cd tonight? * 5 has X 20 down and we are trading with the 200 sloping down * MACD bars are stepping down AND the signal line is in agreement * Price Action . . . well, we have had a little pullback up to the 20, and all is now resting well into the Asian session awaiting European trading. However, there may not be the explicit confirming PA you want. Is that about right? This lack of clarity probably spells "do not take entry." I admit I do not like the recent long wick down, either. Let me know your thoughts, please. Best to you, Forest

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Hi Forest-Sea, I personally do not track U/CAD but I'll try to offer my view. I would have taken short at one of the candles highlighted in below chart, as to me they are bearish pin bars (although small ones). Both pins cannot close above the 20ema (and actually the top of the candle are confined by the 20 as well). On the other hand I notice that the ascending trendline starting form Mar 17 has just been broken, adding to my confidence to go short. As Tw0eleven has said, take the trades that you can find multiple reasons to support your view.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Thanks, fthingf. As it turned out, it was an acceptable trade. It continued down just under 50 pips from my first observation prior to a bounce up. Stochastics were quite low, well under 20, at that point and I would have exited on that weakness. I think your observation to find multiple reasons to take or decline a trade is quite helpful. The weight of evidence here probably said it was an acceptable risk. I also see that 211 sees his plan more as guidelines to "put the odds on your side." In that spirit, I could have taken this trade. Best to you, Forest

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Hi Forest, Personally, I do prefer to look for 3 main candle patterns(PA). 1) Pinbar 2) Engulfing Candle or 3) Tweezers/RailRoad Tracks. There are a lot of other candle patterns out there...but I find these the most useful. Of course you can trade anything you want...however, I try to put the odds in my favor of a successful trade. That's why I look for the 1-2-3 guidelines to line up before entering. If you have some other things that you have experienced as a trader and they are consistantly profitable for you...by all means use them! The main thing we want is High Probability Trades with Minimum Risk!

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Forest, I'd have to agree with with fthingf said above. Get the odds in your favor...multiple reasons for shorts. Also, look at the other side of things...what reasons do you have to go long??? As long as the list for shorts is bigger than the list for longs...and the PA, MA's, MACD all line up...that's your best chance at a winning trade. I don't usually trade U/Cad, but I do have the chart up just to watch. One more thing...typically GU, EJ, GJ are good moving pairs...they move over 100pips a day on average. While EU, AU, UCAD are typically lower. Initially I mentioned setting a 50pip target price on all the pairs. But with EU, AU, UCAD if you change that to 30pips and your success rate will go up a lot more. Just remember since you are only taking 30pips profit you want to make sure your entry only has an initial risk around 50pips or less otherwise the moneymanagement aspect goes out the window! Cheers!

--- 帖子 #74 ---
I have previously done pretty serious looks at daily range figures for numerous pairs, and, of course, you are absolutely correct . Trading the U.Cd or other smaller ranging pair demands reducing your TP to something like the 30 you suggest. Excellent advice. That would have worked very well on the trade we are post-mortem analyzing. Second, I do appreciate your considered opinion on the most reliable PA candle patterns you note. I am not as good on these as I should be and will definitely use your guidance. Thank you, again, for sharing your earned wisdom and experience.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I have just been looking and toying with the idea of possibly letting trades run a little longer instead of taking the standard 50pip profit target. The idea is simple...once you find a trade to enter into, let the trade run until price closes opposite side of the 5ma that you entered on. Examples will be shown below. ***The risk on this though(besides the fact I have tested it....just been looking over the charts)...you could miss out on some good 50pip trades or see your profitable trades turn into breakeven or even small loss trades. For now, it's just an idea I'm throwing out there and if anyone has input...please let me know**** there could be a lot of variations on this...such as taking a max profit of 150pips. Or if you make it to 50pips profit, move your stoploss to breakeven and just let the trade run. Or at 50pips profit set your s/l to -50 so you don't have any more than a 50pip loss...and when you reach 100pips profit move stoploss to breakeven. Guess it would be up to each individual trader. I'll be looking forward to some feedback! Happy Trading!

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Hi Forest, Here is a link that has some definitions and examples of candle patterns that might help you. http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.p...estick_pattern And here is one on some chart patterns: http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.p...chart_patterns Cheers!

--- 帖子 #77 ---
This could be a possible trade...but we NEED a retrace first to the 20ma to reduce our risk!!! 1) Tweezers at the top before this big bearish candle 2) 5/20 about to cross down 3) MACD sloping down 4) Trendline broken down 5) Overall trend is still down(we just had a short term pullback/uptrend) 6) If you look left...price retrace to prior support area around 1.3500-3550

--- 帖子 #78 ---
and we would need to wait for a close of bar following the EU retrace (if it comes)?

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Nope, basically if eu retraces to 1.3440-50 area that would give you about 50pips risk(top of the big bearish candle). Your entry should be around 20ma. That way, one of two things will happen: 1) price will stay belo the 20ma and continue down thus giving you profit or 2) price will go back above the 20ma and close above...thus you exit for a smaller loss than if you entered down around 1.3400-20. Wanted to add that you don't always get a retest/touch of the ma to the exact pip...sometimes it will stop 10-15pips shy...so set an alarm(if you aren't watching the charts) for about 15-20pips prior to the ma...then you can watch PA for a little bit and see if price is stalling before the ma and you want to enter.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Helpful! Thanks, 211

--- 帖子 #81 ---
LOL 211, Ive been watching that eu setting up since noon. been just waiting for the pullback. and yes thing, i'm not waiting for the close, i'm waiting for the touch. of the ma's since the h1 and h4 are in the same place and the daily just occurred as well. Scottie

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Well, we didn't get a pullback to the 1.3440-50 area on that last candle but we did get a small pb. So you have a couple choices at this point...1) keep waiting for the pullback or 2) enter based on the PB as explained on the chart below.

--- 帖子 #83 ---
i'm also seeing UCad starting to confirm this move and the gu has an evening star pattern if you are using a bar start time of 0:00 gmt.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
i say we'll get the pullback, just wait for it. the down move was 100 pips without looking back yet.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
honestly, those of you who are following this thread. I know the h4 time frame is not the rush of trading the m5 or m15, but if you want to make money, take a look at this.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
I agree, patiently waiting for GU to setup!

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Scottie, I like your intuition. I think good traders have it and see beyond the patterns and indys.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Might bear watching. Not a dynamic pair, obviously. For those, I guess, who might want something else to trade for 30 pips or something. 5 about = 20 now; MACD turning up to the correct direction

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Guys I saw some analysis where trades were taken without the participation of the 200ema. Why are we plotting it on the charts? I thought it was an extra confirmation of the trend and that trades are taken only in the direction of the 200ema? Clarification please...

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Hi Olu, Welcome to the thread and asking your question! the 200ema is a good indication of the Overall trend direction...but if you look back at the charts...price doesn't hang out around the 200ema for that long. It's sorta like a magnet...price moves above&amp;below it. Price moves in cycles and we are just trying to catch some of the pips along the way. Typically it's best to trade is with the overall trend...but say the trend is down and price is way below the 200ma by about 500pips...if you get a signal to go long(countertrend...against the 200ma) that it's typically ok to take it because there is plenty of room to move up towards the 200ma. What you want to avoid is trading when price is bouncing up&amp;down at the 200ma(moving sideways in a range). The 5 and 20 moving averages are our main signals to trade...and the 200 is just like a guide to help point us in the right direction. I hope that helps...and if I can clarify something else please let me know. Hope you enjoy this thread!

--- 帖子 #91 ---
does this trade ticks all the boxes? Wanted to long it at 1.0660 but went to do something and bam it is moving the right way

--- 帖子 #92 ---
it fits for me i'm not trading that pair right now, but it trades very similar to eu.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
around noon eastern time, EU gave a signal to look for shorts. at the asian open, i took the pullback and got a sell price of 1.3436. i set my target for 30 pips and noticed it was just shy of the bottom of the big down bar. this is how its done. 30 pips bagged. Scottie

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Hi Olu, I don't trade that pair so I'm not familiar if the 50pip target price works or if you should use a smaller one. That being said, it does look like a valid setup. You had a nice Bullish candle blow by the 5/20 ma's(although the candle was too big to trade at candle close)...you got a nice pullback to the 5&amp;20 ma's where price stalled. Combine this with the 5/20 crossing up and the Macd histogram slopingup and I see a trendline break to the upside...it looks good! Entry should have been at/around the ma's. Nice work on seeing this setup! Keep it up!

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Great work Scottie...enjoy those pips and see you next trade!

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Great for you! I myself am a bit more conservative, so I wait for the last 4hr candle to close which is a bearish engulfing. I entered short at 1.3395. Seeing that yesterday's daily candle is a bearish engulfing as well, I'll aim for 50 pips for this trade.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Techinically, I think the more conservative thing to do is enter on the pullback to the MAs...that way there is less risk on your trade. If you enter on candle close when price is further away from the ma's, that means the more room price has to move against you before hitting any suppor/resistance. this is especially true on engulfing candles since price closes at the highs on bullish candles and at the lows for bearish ones. As for the eu trade...I hope you exited on the close of the 0400gmt candle close(1.3432) since price closed above the 5ma AND the 5ma started turning back up AND macd started going higher again. Also that candle makes 4 candles in a row that couldn't close below the big bearish candle from yesterday at 1200gmt. Price spent 16hrs trying to go below/close below 1.3394 and couldn't so it formed a pretty solid base(support area) around that level.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Right I exited at the close you mentioned. Looks like I really need to look into fine tuning my entry next time. Lesson learned!

--- 帖子 #99 ---
A missed trade in the usdchf turned out to be a blessing after all because I would have gunned for 50pips.

--- 帖子 #100 ---
the reason i posted the trade was to demonstrate how difficult it is to take these entries. most people that look at my entries at the same time i take them freak out. these entries come from several years of experience and observation. It works for me, but that doesn't mean a new trader could take what i do and immediately make money with it. this one turned out to be quick, but i took one earlier in the week that i was in for 8ish hours that can be a painful wait for those of you who who are used to trading shorter time frames. my target on the trade was above the bottom of the large bottom candle for a reason as well. The bottoms of those candles can turn into support as was the case last night. i didn't know that it would, i just knew that it could. in addition, this is nfp week and traditionally, when i used to go for a runner on nfp, i'd get torpedoed. Scottie

--- 帖子 #101 ---
I think you're doing great fthingf...really picking up how this method works! To be honest, even if you waited for a pullback on eu(after the engufling candle) and entered it still would have been a loss. I'll be the first to admit this method is NOT 100% winners. We just try to pick the best setups we can and then it's up to the market to decide where it goes. As with learning any new way to trade, it takes time. The best thing I have seen from the trades you have posted is that you are taking small losses(less than 50pips)!!! A lot of traders don't know how to do that and end up taking HUGE losses thinkin the market will turn in their favor if they just hold on a little longer. Keep up the good work! 211

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Olu, my best advice on Taking profits...get to know what the average daily ranges are for the pairs you trade. And then typically go for about half of that for your profits. Say for example the GU puts in 100pip range each day...only look for 50pips profit. I mean honestly, how often can a trader(professional or not) enter the market at the exact perfect Low or High of a trade and exit at the exact High or Low and capure ALL 100pips of the move??? You might get lucky once in a while...but I don't like trading on luck...I might as well go to Las Vegas and try my luck there too! This advice is for everyone...use realistic goals! Happy trading! 211

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Hi 211 Thanks for your comments. I already use ATR in my trading but what I meant was that the trade turned out to be a loser type almost from the get go. It just could not stay above 1.0680. By the way your trade in the early morning (UK time) was superb. We were all waiting for a retracement to the 40 area in the eurousd. one way or the other I still missed the trade. I thought the retracement would be more. Great thread and thanks to all that kept the discussion going early this morning (UK time)

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Better to have missed a trade than take a loser right? And I just want everyone to keep in mind that you can NOT be focused on exact price levels when waiting for entry points. Take the EU last night for example...if you are waiting for it to pullback to 1.3440, remember price could stop 10-15pips prior. I recommend setting some type of alarm that will alert you to start watching the charts when price comes within 10-20pips of where you want to enter. One more thing, the moving averages will move after each candle close...so what might have been the 1.3440 area on EU last night, after a couple candle closes it could now be at 1.3430(so you might want to start watching the charts around 1.3420ish). Happy Trading! 211

--- 帖子 #105 ---
211 once again thanks for your advice. hope you will be around early tomorrow morning

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Well, some people got the EU short last night for 30pips...unless you were trying for 50, then you most likely took a loss. However, it's interesting to see that after the short signal...we got a long signal right afterwards. For those of your familiar with Tweezers(also known as railroad track pattern)...here's what I see that would have been a nice profitable. Unfortunately I was sleeping when this setup, so I didn't take it. But it's a great example to look at! ***side note****the only think that would make me think twice about this trade is that price closed below the 20ma, instead of above it...so I might have waited to see it go above before entering.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Friends, Clearly if we are going to wait for a retrace prior to an entry, we can take the entry on a (near) touch of the MAs. However, if one is just entering on a 'clear' 1-2-3 set-up should we move into the position at a bar close or when it all appears. For instance, if we are mid-four hour candle and we see a pin bar developing coupled with a recent MA cross and correctly moving MACD bars, would you take entry then? Of course, the pin bar could go away by the end of the candle, but, then again, it could continue up to a TP? Whither go we? What is the optimal protocol? Forest

--- 帖子 #108 ---
For me, I MUST wait for candle close to get the Pinbar, Engulfing candle, Tweezers, etc... AFTER I get one of those patterns and confirm that the MA's are crossing and MACD agrees...then I decide if I should enter right away(candle close) OR if I need to wait for a pullback. And that decision comes from 1) Risk..is my risk greater than 50pips...then i should probably wait for a pullback. 2) Also, engulfing candles "typically" give pullbacks...so you reduce risk by waiting for a pullback if price isn't close t the ma's. Hope that helps! You must be flexible in this market. 211

--- 帖子 #109 ---
This is what my prior 'training' in the forex University of Hard Knocks tells me, but I wanted to be sure you were running your system this way. Thanks. Forest

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Good summary, and I learned my lesson about waiting for pullback after the engulfing candle in last trade. Won't forget that next time! Btw, 211, thanks for the encouragement!

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Not a problem! I started this thread in hopes of passing on some wisdom that I learned from forexfactory the last few years. And I hope people make money with this method, not lose it. The only problem with that is you sit 5 traders down in front of the same chart and you'll get 5 different viewpoints of what price is doing. But I'm happy to see some are getting it!

--- 帖子 #112 ---
It's been quite a while since I've seen such strong uptrends on GU, EU, GJ, EJ that produce little to no entries. And I don't see anything setting up anytime soon, especially with NFP tomorrow(I won't be trading that). So have a good weekend everyone and see you next week! Happy Easter!

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Hi, tw0eleven: Thank you very much to share your idea. I like to have your new MACD for my chart. But when I downloaded it, it gave me an "attahment.php" file instead your newMACD.mq4 fiel. What did I do wrong? How can I download it? Please help. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Hi, I was wondering where is the histogram on you MACD? Also on one of your charts you took a long position before the emas had crossed. Can you pleas explain? Thanks

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Nice thread OP. But shouldn't you make the same rules for exit?? So you can get more pips? Taking 30-40 pips out of 4 Hr trend is very low reward. You can check about volataility exit using ATR or you can exit on 5/20 MA cross. But very good entry indeed.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Hi 211 and fellow traders I went thru all the posts 2x. I like the pace as it is 4 hr. My wife actually asked me to get married to my laptop as my eyes were glued to the monitor always. Rigth now, I have to learned to have some time off the monitor as I have to work in the day and can only monitor the market at night. With the 4 hr tf, I can take thing slowly. I will post my chart when there is a setup. I must learn to be patient. Thank you guys.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
TW, thanks for bringing it back down to KISS. I think patience is the key. One signal a day or two in any pair is good for me.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Hi there Tw0eleven Just stumbled over your tread. Interesting to see that you are using an almost similar approach as I'm using on my live account since Dec 09 How's your stats? On my side from 1 DEC 09 I have a hit rate of 81% with an average of 45,97 pips + and 50,82 pips -. However I'm working with my exits as I can see that the potential on the + side is larger than what i have achieved. Anyway, continues god trading to you.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Hi Rich, I'm not sure what's wrong with it...it looks good to me and haven't had any other complaints. If anyone else has had trouble let me know and I'll look further into it. As for now, maybe try downloading it again? Let me know! 211

Hi forex4me, The macd histogram is the Purple lines in the macd indicator...while the red&amp;blue lines are the macd moving average lines I talk about. As for the ema's...sometime I will take a trade just as the ema's are about to cross if there is a good angle on the 5ema. I won't do it too early, but once you study the charts and get a feel for things...you will be able to tell usually when you are 1 candle away from the 5/20 emas just about to completely cross. Hope that helps! 211

I have asked myself the same question Brb-Fraudin. Basically it comes down to this...if you want more pips out of a trade(say 200-400pip winners) that means your winning percentage usually drops. But if I take smaller winners, my winning percentage went up. This is where each trader has to figure out what's best for him. Personally, I'm rather happy with 100pips a week profit on average. Some people may perfer making more...and that's fine too. To each his own! Cheers! Also, go back and check out my Post #75...it talks about this very subject. 211

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Welcome aboard Freedoomsg and look forward to your posts! I had the same problem when I first started trading...loved the action of 5 and 15minute charts...but spent way too much time staring at them and not spending time with the family. hehe I was like a kid with a new toy...but I knew that wasn't going to last.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
That's exactly how I feel...and while it might not be for everyone, I hope to find some other traders that enjoy keeping it fairly simple and not having to stare at the charts all day. Honestly, if you run the numbers...just 2 winning trades a week(100pips) trading 1 standard lot = $4000 a month! I know there's a lot of job out there that you can't make that working 40hrs/week!!! But YOU HAVE TO BE PATIENT FOR THE GOOD SETUPS/TRADES!!!! If it doesn't look good, skip it!

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Hi Alf, thanks for the post...I agree, the winning percentage for this method should be above 75% if a person is patient enough to wait for the proper setups. I wasn't quite sure what your 45, 97pips + and 50, 82 pips - meant though, can you explain that a little more? Do you take profit at 2 different points? 211

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Nope.. What i meant was that my average wins is 45,97 pips, and average losses 50,82 pips.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
I believe he was referring to 45.97 &amp; 50.82 pips. Some countries do use comma as the decimal separator.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
fthingf you are absolutely right. I didn't catch that one before you mentioned it.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Still patiently waiting....something to evaluate later this afternoon...we've had pretty slow movement with most markets closed on Friday and today for the holidays...we'll see what happens later today as things get back to normal. Also, be careful...we have AUD, GBP and EURO interest rate decisions later this week!

--- 帖子 #129 ---
4pm Update: Still nothing saying long on EU, yet I'm not very convinced on shorts either(even though that's what the charts say). still on the sidelines. As for EJ...it could go either way, so sidelines here too. And GU? I have an upside bias, but again...nothing there to get me in yet. Sometimes holidays are great and produce good trades...other times they are REALLY REALLY SLOW!!!! hahaha

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Hi 211, GU in at side way now. All the MAs are close to each other. And it is forming a Triangle now. Waiting to break the triangle and close above / below the MAs and decide. Daily TF is below 200 MA, still a downtrend to me. Patience is the game.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
I completely agree..I have been watching this same chart waiting for some sign to get it. I don't have really anything to add to what you already said!

--- 帖子 #132 ---
In reference to my post above #128 and the EU...I was originally looking for a possible long setup, however...I also said to be careful for the possible Head&amp;Shoulders for shorts...it looks like shorts prevailed. There were a couple PB's that tried to get above the 5&amp;20 ma's, but could never close above them. I had to work my dayjob earlier this week, so I missed it...but hopefully some of you were able to get it! GU and GJ might be getting ready for shorts...they both have 1)bearish engulfing candles 2) 5/20 ma's crossed down and 3) macd histograms sloping down AND going below the zero line! Be smart with your entries if you decide to take any of these trades...wait for pullbacks and limit your risk!!! Happy Trading, 211

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Patience is the game. Thanks 211

--- 帖子 #134 ---
time to buy?

--- 帖子 #135 ---
looks like a good setup to me...only thing I would note, if you do go long...make sure price can clear the 1.0065 level because if you look left it looks like it was a prior support area that was broken and could be resistance. Goodluck and May the Pips Be With You!

--- 帖子 #136 ---
thanks for your comment. Will look out for that support turned resistance... I had high hopes for usdcad ie thought it was going to the moon till it turned and went to the centre of the earth

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Till waiting.... it is near the corner....

--- 帖子 #138 ---
the gbpusd as it stands now A bit of exuberance in the asian markets and we will have a breakout to the upside. We have a cross up on the MAs. MAs bunched together macd turning up macd histogram above 0 All the components for a long trade

--- 帖子 #139 ---
I would agree...I'd also like to say I'm human and take losses just like everyone else. I tried going short GU this morning when it looked like it was making Lower Highs and Macd was heading down and MA's were down...but the market taught me another less! Onto the next!

--- 帖子 #140 ---
I had to work today, so didn't get to see this...but just going over the charts, did anyone get this EU long setup???

--- 帖子 #141 ---
Hi 211, I missed the EU, but took the GU instead. The signal candle was the bullish pin as indicated in below chart, but too bad I was sleeping then. I waited until price retraced to around the 5ema two candles later and got my 50 pips the very next candle!

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Great job fthingf! The GU chart wasn't quite as clear as the EU, so I'm glad you were able to spot it! Looks like you're doing good with this and thanks for posting the chart. I know this method won't be for everyone, but hopefully it helps some! Keep making those pips!

--- 帖子 #143 ---
Long candidate

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Nice looking chart. It does appear to be going long. Have to admit, I don't really look at the UJ too often and I'm not sure what the average daily range is...so not sure if you'd be going for 30 or 50pips as your target. If you trade this, keep us updated! But I really like the analysis you did on the chart!

--- 帖子 #145 ---
Thanks Tw0Eleven for your comments. What do you think about euroaud. The 123 principle is in place

--- 帖子 #146 ---
I have to say, I have never traded that pair and know nothing about it. Perhaps someone else viewing this may be able to comment?

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Yeah, this is close to James 16 core system. I am also using a similar system on H4 but with a few different settings. Basically 10,25,150 &amp; 365 EMA with the new version of MACD 12,26,9, just PA and S&amp;R using the MA. Actually, I recently came across a decent EMA crossover alert and also a NMACD with an alert. Saves you having to eyeball the chart too much. Maybe some of you guys will find them useful. You can turn the alerts off in both indicators.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Just closed a +60pips trade

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Hi What reason apart from the pullback to the 5EMA, favored you entering on that IB instead of the break of high of the Inside bar, which is the normal entry in J16? The IB is generally a reversal signal although it occasionally acts as a trend continuation signal. Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Awesome! Great work Olu!

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Thanks for posting the indicators Rastaman!

--- 帖子 #152 ---
I think there are 2 things here: 1) this method doesn't deal with trading Inside Bars...personally, I don't find them consistant enough to trade. 2) I would much prefer entering at/near the Moving Averages instead of waiting for price to break the high/low of candles....in my humble opinion(and with this method) it greatly reduces your risk on a trade. Hope that helps!

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Hi &amp; Thanks for the reply. I recently returned from the J16 private forum so I am interested in these H4 systems. Ok, I get you on the IB thingy. I also am not a great fan of IB unless they are IB4 bars or higher. I am just viewing your thread and trying to work out what MACD settings you are using. In some screenshots you are using 12, 26,9 but in others you are using 24,52,18. What are the reasons for changing the settings and what settings are you currently using.? Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Well, I must say I'm impressed. You are the first person to notice this...I was wondering how long I could get away with having different macd settings before somone would catch it! Now the secret is out. hehe I think you can use the standard settings 12, 26, 9 and be just fine. I have been using the other settings lately because they seem to smooth out the histogram and it makes it visually easier for me to see where the momentum is heading. Basically, they are 8hr chart settings...I just doubled the standard 4hr settings since MT4 doesn't have an 8hr chart. The main point about using macd imho is that you make sure you are trading with the momentum of the market. So if the histogram is heading up, momentum(prices) are going up...and vice versa for shorts! Happy Trading!

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Right, I get you now. I was wondering if you were just using it to show that example of when not to enter a trade. Thanks for your time. I agree, PA is the main stem of trading that is profitable. I presume you are using PPZ as in J16 for S&amp;R? Have you ever been a member of the J16 private group? Take care &amp; Great job you are doing here to help new people. As they say, Sharing is caring.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
I think I have read some of the J16 thread...but it's been so long I'd actually need to go back and see if I have/haven't. But it does sound familiar. And I haven't been a member either. What is PPZ? I'm assuming it's Pivot Points? I don't use them...I use to early in my trading career but to be honest...I could never tell when price would stop at R1, R2, R3, S1, S2, S3. It's like some days price would only go to R1 or S1 and other days big moves to S3 or R3...but I couldn't ever tell which one, so I stopped using them and have decided just to take what the market gives me based on Average Daily Ranges. P.S. Just went and looked at the J16 thread...I do remember looking it over, but I never really followed it. There's good stuff on there, just didn't fit what I was looking for in trading. Another thread I use to follow and tried trading was by Phillip Nel and both his 4hr and 5min methods.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
A little retracement and this might be a good sell

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Yes, PPZ are S&amp;R but a little different than the regular floor pivots. They are drawn as no doubt you have seen previously, at areas where price has flipped. Basically it is support that has changed to resistance and visa vi. However, I do not like to draw PPZ all over the place and it can be time consuming. I sometimes use a round number indicator but on H4, you can generally tell where a price action candle is going to stall by the highs and lows nearby. Something I am currently working on is this. Find a D1 successful Pin Bar or outside bar etc and put a line on the tail and the nose, then change down to H4 and you can find many successful price action bars around those areas. They seem to repeat and so they should as a PB is basically bouncing off resistance and hitting support which either holds or breaks. Try it out. What an interesting time frame H4 is, is it not? Hopefully I can learn alongside you guys.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
I am sure everyone knows there is nothing mysterious about pin bars. They are simply a Head and shoulders pattern if you move down a time frame. like this one on D1, on H4 it is a reverse Head and shoulders. I only mention this as I myself did not know what they were till I studied at J16. Actually, this is quite important if you think about it. That D1 PB was not very successful and the reason is, if you go down to H4 you see it is a R H&amp;S which is a bullish signal, but this one is in an uptrend, we want to see a Head &amp; Shoulders at a high not a Reverse head 7 shoulders. So, we can check a PB out like that also.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Good eye, same thing setting up on EJ chart too.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Nice Charts. I do the same thing...look at Daily every now and then to see if there is any obvious candles that stick out and then look at the h4 for an entry. Looks like you are on the right track! Keep up the good work.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Yeah, the thing is, you can go back years and find a nice PA candle on the weekly, then highlight the top and bottom and wait in lair for it. As the great Jesse Livermore said, 'We get paid to wait"!

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Not sure if you or anyone else took the EU short, but I see it worked for 30pips. I took the EJ short and made a nice little profit...entry was at 126.57.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Very true. I think patience is very important in trading fx. The trades must come to you! You can't anticipate and jump into a trade ahead of time unless you want to lose money! Another nice chart rastaman. I took a look at EU monthly and see the 1991 candle you are talking about. Also, there is a "Peak" in price Dec. 2004 at the same area.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Something to watch...

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Yep, could be good for longs. I still have a hard time reading UCad though. Sometimes it trends so well, other times it's horrible...stops on a dime and reverses at weird places. Also, I typically only look for 30pips profit on this pair( just like EU and AU) because I never know when it's going to have a slow day or a breakout day...figure being conservative is best! Cheers!

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Tw0eleven you are right. cad is a bit erratic. Take tonight(now uk time) ucad is going up while the gbpusd and eurusd are going up. it should be the opposite. however what if this is the early stages of an abc correction in the ucad. Put in some stock market weakness and voila it will be a good story 700 pips later For the time being we need to trade what we see. Keep our feet on solid ground

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Well said! Just a little side note...I see Ucad did have a semi-bullish engulfing candle on the last candle that closed above the 5&amp;20 ma's...5 is about to cross the 20 and macd histogram is starting to move up. The bullish engulfing candle was only about 50pips big too....so if someone entered on the pullback to the 20 ma(about 1.0000) they would be up 30pips already!!! Amazing!

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Just sold EU at 135490 Now,let the market decide how generous it wants to be. EDIT: Chart hard to see in black.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Just curious how you got that entry? Did you wait for price to break candle low? IMHO, it looks like EU gave a short signal with pullback that would have an entry anywhere from 1.3460-80 which means you'd already have or be close to 30pips profit.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
I was looking for that pullback but did not get it. It apears I have missed the train on this one. I was looking for 1.0010 to get long

--- 帖子 #172 ---
The PB right off the daily pivot, at the cross of the 20 &amp; 6 EMA, the nose pierces the Monthly &amp; weekly pivot which is a round number at 1.35380. The back of that pb has already been tested and not violated. Also, I live in Japan and just got up a while back, and started my day. This could well be a runner worth well over a hundred pips easily, I feel no need to rush. Of course this trade is not a recommendation to anyone to take, it is simply my humble opinion.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Ah, gotcha...my entries are soley based on 4hr. I may look at the Daily/Weekly/Monthly charts every now and then just to see if something sticks out...but I always scaled down to the 4hr for trading. Goodluck to you sir...may the pips be with you!

--- 帖子 #174 ---
My charts show ucad pulled back to 1.0011 on the last candle (between 4pm-8pm EST)....but you might not have been around for that. Oh well, You did a great job posting the chart and seeing the setup...we can't trade them all. We need to sleep, spend time with family, go out and have fun...so we just take what we can get when we can.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Ladies and Gentlemen, The market was very kind to me this week...have exceeded all my goals so I will be taking tomorrow off and enjoying a round of golf! Goodluck and have a good weekend to all!

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Enjoy your game T Exercise and trading go hand in hand.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
I did! I saw the bearish pin bar before I went to bed, and set a sell limit around the 5ema with a target of 30 pips. Woke up in the morning and got my pips. Minimal work!

--- 帖子 #178 ---
I am noticing that a lot of people are talking about TP of 30-60 pips! I also trade an M15 system where average TP is 50 pips and very often well over 100 pips. Possibly letting a trade run more and cutting the losers short with good money management is a way to extract more profit out of the H4.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
EJ was 50 pips in profit but I decided to just move the SL to a tolerable area of support and hold on to it for the LO. It may go much further and let me move SL to BE+. Just showing this on M15 so we can see the series of lower high and lower lows, as we come for a test of the 23.6 fibo. EU looking pretty much as EJ.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Excellent, nice work!!! That's exactly how I'd like this method to be. Simple and minimal work allowing a person to use their time for other things such as family, working around the house, golfing, etc... Have a good weekend.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Hi Rastaman, I'd just like to remind you that if you read the first post you'll see this method is exactly for taking 30-50pips only. There are multiple ways to trade forex, hence all the different methods. And this one prefers to make consistant smaller profits with a higher win percentage versus bigger profits with a lower win percentage by leaving runners. The choice is always up to the individual trader of course, but I don't recommend runners using this method. Have a good weekend!

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Trade is looking good...enjoy!

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Ej trade still on , took TP1 at 110 pips. Will probably move SL to BE &amp; leave this over the weekend.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Thanks T EJ in the above post, is a better deal though but, I hear from a rather renowned source around here that Eu could well be on its way to 1.000 I just wanted to get in.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Another one fulfilling the conditions...

--- 帖子 #186 ---
The Friday EU short just surpassed the 120 pip mark. Probably time to put the SL at BE+.LoL

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Nice...sometimes they work out great, sometimes they don't. Glad this one did for you! Enjoy the profits!

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Actually I checked out all the pairs I follow and saw that most of them have signalled a buy or sell last week and therefore most positions taken via the system would have either taken profits or be in the moving stops to lock in profits phase By the way is this usdchf still tradable?. The macd has been below the line for some time but the ma cross down is just taking place

--- 帖子 #189 ---
This is indeed a simple and easy to execute system. Thks for sharing this with us.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Hi Olu, I've been pretty busy so haven't posted much. My wife and I have a new baby boy addition to our family. That being said, I think that chf trade was good on the candle that closed just at/below the ma's....that's where you should have entered(or at least i would have). The last candle on your chart looks like it already dropped pretty far so you would need to wait for price to come back up to the ma's and then stall and start back down if you wanted to enter short. The reason I would have picked the entry just as the ma's where crossin down and price was at/below the ma's is because not only did the 1-2-3 line up then...but look at your candles themselves, 2 great PinBar candles before the entry candle! That would add enough reasons for me to enter. On a side note, thank you for posting your chart. Also, that's another reason I haven't posted a lot on here lately...I don't want to be the one posting possible trades and calling the shots. I really wanted to put this system/method out there and have others trade it themselves. See if you like it...some will, some won't. If anyone has questions...feel free to ask and I or someone else on here will surely try to answer! I hope those of you that are trying this trading method are enjoying it and making pips! Happy Trading!

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Not a problem at all. If you enjoy this method of trading and are having success or have questions...please continue to post so that others may learn too!

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Congratulations on your new baby. Photos please. Now you will have to increase your lot size

Wish your whole family well. Enjoy your family. Hope He will be a forex trader Can you check out the usdjpy? We have a signal. There are newe signals in uscchf, audusd, yencrosses The only problem is the signals occurred and PA has moved on to confirm. And according to this system we might need a retracement to get in which might not come Secondly we have figures coming out from the states soon

--- 帖子 #195 ---
I agree you would need a retrace on the UJ. the same with most pairs since they have moved so far so fast! IMHO, we have already missed the short entries on GU, EU, EJ, GJ, AU, and long on UCAD. The 4am EST candle close gave the signals for trade setups...and shortly after that we got price to pullback to the MA's for your entry points. Now would be a good time to just wait patiently for the next setup or pullback. Just be careful since most pairs have already put in their normal daily range...so the safest option would be to just sit and wait. Happy Trading!

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Almost fulfilling the 123 conditions. Comments anyone?

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Hi Olu, as the 5ema has not crossed the 20, and there is no signal candle to my liking yet (bullish pin or engulfing candle), I'll probably wait. Now the most recent candle is an inside bar which could mean indecision, I think we need to see how the next candle unfolds. By the way, I notice that you're using 4ema instead of 5. Do you find this setting better for AU?

--- 帖子 #198 ---
I agree with fthingf...it was close to setting up for longs, but not quite there. However, nzd interest rate decision was tonight which is imho affects AUD at times...so another reason to sit out. On a side note...yesterday was CRAZY in the market. EU, EJ, GU actually looked long to me in the morning...but then we had some surprise news come out with the credit rating downgrades of Portugal and Greece...then things went south pretty quick. I actually took some losses on GU and EJ due to the surprise news...just goes to show you you never know what may happen in forex! Hope everyone else avoided the losses or were able to take shorts for some profits!!! Happy Trading!

--- 帖子 #199 ---
I thought I read it to be 4 ema. Is everyone using 5ema? If so I will need to change mine

--- 帖子 #200 ---
So we are all singing from the same hymn sheet...

Hi Olu, it is the 5, 20, 200 ema's.

hi...great thread... hope you dont mind my input as i trade in a similar fashion ... long eur/usd at the moment ...we had a nice green candle break of the 20ema which is also starting to move upwards ( turning green ) also i like to use the parabolic sar to confirm (also green ). very technical i know!.. i generally try to enter on a pull back .. in this case 50% retracement of the breaking green candle, also some support /resistance to the left . entry at 1.3271.... stoploss at 1.3221....looking for about 130 pips, but will move to break even if price hits the 76% retrace of the last wave down at 133.43. slightly worried that i should not have held the trade over the weekend . well see.. im hoping to learn something on this thread .. all the best . Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #204 ---
trade broke even ... stopped at 76% retracement ... possible short entry at 132.55 area after another pullback to s/r but bar to big for me the stoploss would have been 77 pips . Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #205 ---
gbpusd short entry at 1.5273 ... again waited for a pullback to S/R level .. stop loss better at 1.5323/ 54pips....breakeven point at the 76% retracement. looking for 140pips .... hope these trades are compatible with the thread .. the entry /exit tactics are different ... any comments , also added a macd or what i think is macd from my charts software, dont know never used it .. anyone care to educate me .. thanks . Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Welcome Aboard Booker66! Thanks for posting your charts. While they aren't exactly the same we trade here...they are fairly close. If you are comfortable with what you're doing now, keep at it. It appears your analysis is good. I really like how you are patient and wait for retraces in order to reduce risk! I wish I had a great way to explain macd for you, but I don't...I basically use it to see where the momentum is heading in the market. Keep up the good work, 211

--- 帖子 #207 ---
thanks 211.. i think were on the same wavelength .. but theres always different ways to skin a cat as they say... ive been picking off these trading patterns for a while now ...there not 100% but it happens a lot and with a good risk/reward ratio . at the risk of posting to many charts theres a good example on usd/chf this past 2 weeks ... nice with the trend trades .. i didnt max out the pips obviously but took enough .. thanks again .

usdcad has passed the 123 test

--- 帖子 #209 ---
My charts still show UCAD above the 200ema and 20ema...so not quite a short setup yet. Also, it appears UCAD is in a wedge(making lower highs as well as higher lows)...have to be careful with this pair until it picks a definite direction.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
good call.....

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Looked at the charts again last night after I posted on the thread and decided to wait for a close below 1.0050. only to find it rallied hard. in a multitude of counsellors... Thanks everyone. Saved a lot of pips here and God knows I need to make some

--- 帖子 #212 ---
We all need to make pips right...that's why we trade!

--- 帖子 #213 ---
For those of you following this thread and finding success with it, I'd like to thank you. You probably won't see me posting any more examples of this setup/method anymore because I'm actually working on a variation of this...making things even more simple! Once my work is complete, I'll be more than happy to share. Until then, feel free to keep posting your trades in current form and/or ask questions as I will continue to read this thread and provide whatever input I can! Happy Trading!!! p.s. hope some people made some pips on the ride down on GU, EU, EJ...I know I did!!!

--- 帖子 #214 ---
For those of you who were following this method and liked it...I have finished my work on a new/modified version that is a little more simple yet takes good judgement on your part. In short, there is no more 5/20 moving average cross to look for. Nor is there 3 moving averages...but only 1. If you are truly interested in putting the time/effort into studying/using this new method...please PM me for the details. I have become quite the busy person since the addition of my first son so my time may be limited on occasion. Hence the reason not many posts in a while...always please be patient in my replies if you do PM me. Once again, I would like to work with people who are truly interested in this type of method and not looking for some "get rich quick or holy grail" method. You only get out of the market what you put into it...meaning your hard work will result in profits. Side note....you need to be experienced in price action &amp; price patterns for this to be successful. The entries are not mechanical or automatic...it takes traders knowledge/skill.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
For those of you using the new version...how are you doing with it? GU gave a couple nice trades this week and GJ if you trade that. EU gave a fakeout today if you took it...and not much going on with EJ. PM me with how you like the new version and how it's going. Happy Trading

--- 帖子 #216 ---
For those of you who received the new trading version...can you pm me and let me know how you are doing with it? Thank you.

All I've heard is crickets from those of you who received the updated version! So what's the deal...have you guys/gals 1) used the system with success, 2) used the system without success, 3) used the system and been at breakeven, or 4) stopped using the system all together? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Where is the new version? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
It was emailed to about a dozen people to test out and see if it was better than the the first. I'm still waiting to get some feedback from those who I sent it to!

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Well, it looks like most people on here just wanted to view the new method with no intention of reporting back to me. I haven't had 1 person give me any feedback yet. It's frustrating and rather disappointing. I was thinking of possibly setting up a chatroom to discuss this method freely whever people have spare time. Is there anyone who is truly interested in this method???

--- 帖子 #221 ---
When to Trade and When Not To trade...you have to learn this! Also, Price Action is King as many have mentioned before. You have to understand how price moves along with chart patterns to aid in your decision making. Below is an Example of the Eur/Jpy the past couple of weeks. If you can be patient, avoid the chop slop rangy markets...and just take the good setups, you'll come out ahead! Enjoy.

Here are a couple EU trades from late July...there are more on the chart, but I didn't have room to point the all out. I just wanted to pick a few to give everyone a better understanding!

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Hi Tw0eleven, If the last two posts showed your new strategy, i believe it's based on a 21 MA, MACD, PA and candlesticks. Could you send me the details of entry, exits, SL and TPs? The only thing that it's a bit odd is the fact that you missed some big moves with the trend and opted for small reversals. Or the last examples are not a good sample of the strategy? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Hi Jackdaniel, For Entries: refer to the notes on the charts above...that's what you pretty much look for in the setup and then enter when price pulls back towards the 21ma...usually within 10pips is close enough(it's up to you if you want to wait for actually 21 touches or enter 15pips away...it's a flexible plan based on your own preferences). Exits: Either 1) your stoploss is hit, 2) Your profit limit is hit or 3) Price closes on the opposite side of the 21ma from which you entered...so you take a smaller loss than the hard stoploss. Stoploss: Initially set a 75pip stoploss( if you are comfortable with it or trading in a more volatile market...you could use up to 100pip stoploss). TargetPrice: For pairs that have larger daily ranges like GU, GJ, EJ use a 75pip target price(could use 100pips if you think it will go that far). For smaller range pairs like EU, AU, UCad use a 50pip target price. As for your last comment about missing the big moves...you have to decide what type of trader you want to be??? Do you want to be a trader who takes a few pips out of the market each week? Or do you want to be a trader who looks for the Home Run moves of 1000pips??? For me, personally, I could live on 100pips a week trading so I only look for 75-100pips on my trades...1 or 2 good trades a week and I'm happy. But another trade may prefer to get into a trade and hold that trade open for 500pips or more!!! The choice is yours my friend. p.s. another reason I look for only about 100pips a week is that the Big Huge Moves don't happen that often...maybe a couple times a year right? It took GU from January to May to go from 1.6400 area down to 1.4200 area. And then from those May Lows until August to reach 1.6000 area. About 2000pips for each move...and if you take the 5 months it took the first move down and divide that into the 2000pips(if you get in at the top and out at the bottom) then that's 400pips a month profit right? Or 100pips a week?

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Tw0eleven, Thanks for that. I'll have a play during the weekend and see if i can get the hang of it.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
My first trade using the new version ... it's demo.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Yeah, it's a pretty simple method once you get use to what you're looking for...I will be posting some examples from this week below. Let me know if you have any more questions!

--- 帖子 #228 ---
That's Great man...you picked a Good one!!! I'm about to post a screenshot of that trade myself with some notes on it. Keep up the good work!

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Last week didn't have too many setups, but this week...WOW, sometimes when it rains it pours right? If you happened to take all the signals this week, it would basically meet your pip goal for the month(assuming you are just aiming for 100pips or less a week)!!!

--- 帖子 #230 ---
pretty productive week and it's only Wed!

--- 帖子 #231 ---
I think the above examples help reinforce that fact that you don't have to be in the market every week...there will be periods of no signals and then some weeks where there are LOTS of signals. In the end, it all averages out. Just focus on patience and waiting for the proper entries and you can be successful with this method(or pretty much any method you like)!

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Hey, I just spotted a couple things on your chart that I wanted to comment on. First, your MACD looked a bit different than mine...I see you have the same settings I do, but your macd histogram is above the zero line while mine is below...not sure why. But the slope is down which is what you are lookin for to get in if you get a short signal! Second, are you familiar with divergence??? You had a great example of it and I copied your chart and added it in there(the thicker yellow lines). If you're not too familiar with it, or for those of you reading this thread and not too familiar with it, I really like trades when you get a divergence signal. Basically, all it is is when price is still making higher highs(the thick yellow line above the candles)....and when the macd histogram is making lower highs(thick yellow line above macd)...that is Divergence. Price going one way and macd the other way. It signals that the upmove in price is losing it's momentum! *this also works for long setups...but in that case, price will be making lower lows while macd is making higher lows*

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Anyone catch one of these two trades...or both???

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Since neither Price Action nor MACD signaled any long trades...why not take the short???

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Hello 211 -- First, thanks for your ongoing efforts with this forum! Second, I plan to join you this week. I have been periodically using an even simpler h4 system. Yours strikes me as more dependable. I won't burden you with a load of ?s, but I am curious if you particularly follow certain pairs or watch a basket of them? The explanation looks clear to me. Now just to wait out a solid entry. I'll try to check in with some of my decisions. Hopefully, I can wait out quality entries. Best, Forest

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Hi Forest, Thanks for joining the thread. Hope you do well here. To answer your questions...I do have 8 pairs that I watch on one screen...AU, GU, EU, EG, UCad, GJ, EJ, UJ. However, I really only trade GU, EU, EJ...occaisonally the AU, Ucad or UJ. But I stay away from the GJ...the swings are a little more than I like to see. The reason I watch all those pairs is that I like to correlate them and see if there is one currency that is weaker/stronger than the others. Example....if AU, GU, EU are all going up and Ucad is going down it's a pretty safe bet the the Dollar is weak. Another example is if the EU, EG, EJ are going up while GU and GJ are staying the same or going down...it's pretty safe bet that there is Euro strength in the market. Hope that helps and if you have any more questions...feel free to ask! Happy Trading!

--- 帖子 #237 ---
I should apologize. I knew from your post 1 that you followed a variety of pairs. I really was interested in what had truly proven itself over time, AND YOU ANSWERED THIS: GU, EU, EJ. So, thank you even if I was not especially articulate. I will start by concentrating on watching the Big 3 you listed. Forest

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Are you using an EMA 21 or WMA 21? Not a ton of difference, but some. Forest

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Are you using an EMA 21 or WMA 21? Not a ton of difference, but some. Wow, these are clean looking charts. Nice. Forest

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Actually, after a few minor changes from the original method...I know use a 20 lwma. There isn't much difference between the 20 and 21, but I figured I'd use the 20 since there are 20 trading days in the month. Some prefer the 21 since 21 is a fib number. But there really isn't much difference with either one.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
211 so EJ setup ..divergence with MACD.. but candle off the ma... still down?

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Hi Mistersimple, Can you clarify your question and which EJ chart/post you are refering to so that I can answer your question? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #243 ---
ok correlation is with eurusd but...

--- 帖子 #244 ---
well, if I understand you correctly...correlation is NOT only with the eurusd. Since your chart is the EURJPY, you have to look at other EUR pairs AND JPY pairs. If you look at UJ and GJ, you'll those pairs are going up just like EJ. So there is JPY weakness overall...and that weakness is more than the eurusd. Now since the eurusd is weak, as is the gbpusd and audusd...that leads me to believe the USD is strong. So, we have JPY weakness and USD strentgh...what pair do you think we should trade knowing these two things??? USDJPY right? And that's how I try to use correlation. I hope I have helped answer your question. Also, if you were going to trade this EJ pair...you don't have a setup just yet. We just got price to make a Higher Low and it looks like the MACD is starting to turn back up...but we need price to close above the 20moving average and then enter on the pullback.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
ok thanks for your clear answer

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Tw0eleven, I'm still in the cable trade. The price came to 2 pips from my TP but i already banked half and my stop loss is above previous high at 1.5684. I know about divergences but didn't notice the one you pointed out on my chart. My MACD is different because i'm using the one supplied with MT4. Yours is called NMACD. Can you post it here please? Cheers.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Are these 1h charts?

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Hello, this weekend I got to looking at the nmacd I was using the the regular macd you find on MT4 and most other platforms...I have decided that the regular macd is better and therefore took the nmacd off my charts. To answer your second question, they are 4hr charts! Goodluck on your Gu trade...it's doing nicely so far.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
TP hit making me 234 pips ... on demo. It could've been beginners' luck, so the next few trades will show me whether or not i've learnt this strategy.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Maybe you are ready for the big time. Actually, just following the 4 hr KISS signals pretty much qualifies one for successful trading. I think, with time, this system will wear down the market and triumph. Just maybe not more than 200 pips! : ) Congratulations, Forest

--- 帖子 #251 ---
These would have been 5 successful entries according to your strategy, right? This is USD/JPY 4H time frame. However I have used 13 EMA instead of 20 LWMA. What do you think about 13 EMA?

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Hi fguru, I have not used or tested the 13 ema, so I don't know how successful that would be. Since you are using it, maybe you could tell us how successful it is. More than likely though, I will stay with the 20. Happy Trading

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Nice work! I hope you continue the success! Just remeber, be patient for the proper setups AND most importantly...know when you are trading in a ranging market versus a trending one. There was a nice down trend on the GU, so that definitely helped. If you notice a range forming on whatever pair you trade...I wouldn't look for 200pips profit.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Not much going on with the charts today so far. Possible GU long setup coming, but won't know that until candle close.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
Hi Tw0eleven, to be honest, I havent done many trades yet, but so far it looks nice with 13 EMA. Today I took the USD/JPY trade (pic attached). Entered at 85.90 with TP of 40 pips. It went south for nearly 70 pips (however I was sleeping and therefore put a fixed TP of 40 pips and SL of 40 pips).

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Hi fguru, nice work and glad that trade worked out for you. I think I would have personally skipped that trade because price was trending up at the time(looks like it might have just broken the trendline)...but there was no Lower High to confirm that was was indeed going to continue down. However, I do see 3 reasons for it to go down. 1) Price closed below your moving average 2) looks like it might have broken the uptrendline to the down side and 3) macd was sloping down...momentum heading down. So nice work again and happy trading!!!

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Time will tell, but this is how I look at setups in real time!

--- 帖子 #258 ---
I am watching this setup as well.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
OK, I have been seeing what you are seeing. I am wondering if you would now enter since qualification has happened once price drifts back down to your target price? I think we were actually qualified as the last 4 hr candle closed. It's now all about entry. Forest

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Well, given the fact that there were so many things saying to go long prior to the last candle...yes, you could have went long around 8am EST. However, price didn't close above the 20moving average at that time...so I wouldn't make it a habit of entering too early because bad things can happen if you start doing that. Always make sure you have 3 reasons or more to enter a trade(and make sure they outweight the reasons NOT to enter the trade). But since I was at work and missed the entry earlier..I have no choice but to wait until price pulls back to the 20 moving average...if I entered here, my Risk would be TOO great! Hope that helps clarify things.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Hello TW0eleven, from your first's post's, althru the let say the end, you initially guard us with 100pips emergency stop loss: and later you tell that you like to have it at 200pips?! finally, your mt4 charts say 2 hours then 0 so I do not know about weither your charts are 4 hours, sorry?!, but I see myself "things" on 4h &amp; macd... would you have a comment?

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Hi ericforex, Sorry if I may have confused you...there have been some changes to this method since the beginning. I would stick with a 75 to 100pip stoploss. As for the MT4 charts saying 2hours and then 0...are you refering to the number in the upper left of my charts??? That number just tells me how much time left before the 4hr candle closes. So depending on when I take a snapshot of the chart, it will always look different. Let me know if you have any more questions.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Here is an update to this GU long setup trade. We got an entry on the pullback to the 20 moving average. However, the very next candle closed below the 20 ma, thus we needed to exit for a loss. There's a few important things I want to point out about this trade: 1) up till now, you have seen many winning trade examples to get you use to what to look for. But I don't want to be accused of only showing you winning trades because that would not be an accurate representation of this method...there WILL be losing trades too. And here's the proof. 2) We set the 100pip initial stoploss in order to give the trade room to move so we don't get stopped out prematurely. However, we do want to protect our account from some random market event that could cause a 500pip drop/rise in the market...so we MUST set some type of stop loss. This losing trade shows just that...we gave it room to move, yet still protected our account in case of some random BIG move in the market. 3) There are a few people out there who think a 100pip stoploss is too big. But you have to remember, this is a 4hr chart...not a 5minutes chart!!! 4hr candles can move a lot. Your risk/reward on a trade should be roughly 1:1 or better. The 75-100pip stoploss does this...because we typically have a 75 target price. But what's even better about this method is that the 100pip stoploss HARDLY gets hit...if you are in a losing trade, you typically get an exit that is far less than 100pips just like this losing trade example! We only lost 53 pips on this trade...if our next trade is a winner of 75pips...then we come out ahead 22pips!!! And our overall goal in trading is to protect our accounts and come out with a profit right??? Happy Trading!!!

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Hi Tw0eleven, I took the GU trade. Entered at 1.5635, put fixed SL of 40 and TP of 40 and thus had a winning trade (it went up to 1.5688). Are there any pairs you are watching right now?

--- 帖子 #265 ---
THAT'S GREAT!!! I hope everyone reads your post and understands that you have to be flexible in this market! That's why I say use anywhere from a 75-100pip initial stoploss. And that while your initial target price is 50-75pips(depending on the pair)...you might want to take less pips if the market tells you too! In short, it's nice to have a set of rules...but you must also be flexible with them!!! As for other pairs I'm watching right now...I missed the EU trade/pullback for longs. However, the EJ looks good for a long trade if it pulls back to the 20ma.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Will watch the EUR/JPY. I missed the attached USD/CAD trade. Would have been a very nice one, even though there was no lower high. Went down for 100 pips.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Hi fguru, yes...the Ucad was a nice trade if someone took it. I typically don't trade it and wasn't really watching it today. Maybe I should. haha Just a quick note, you said there was no lower high...Actually there was! If you look at your chart that you posted, go back 5 candles and you see that Doji candle? That formed your Lower High! Actually, let me re-post your chart below...Plenty of reasons to short this pair today!!!

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Hi Tw0eleven, yes you are right, now I see the lower high! Thank you very much for explaining everything in detail on the charts, I am learning a lot from it!

--- 帖子 #269 ---
For those of you who are TRULY interested in this trading method...I have decided to start a chatroom where we can all freely discuss things. We will still be posting trade examples on here too. If you are interested in the chatroom, please PM me. It will be free in case you are wondering. Once again, this is only for those who are truly serious about this method. I don't want to waste my time or the other traders in there with non-sense. Also, please contribute. Those who do not follow those two rules and/or are not respectful of others will be kicked out.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
I would never suggest changing your powerful system. However, I did not enter this trade for one simple reason. Another H4 forum on FF advocates no entries in the middle third of the monthly trading range, and GU was in that middle area. Reversals do seem to be more common in the middle. Having said this, THANK YOU so much for your sensible commentary on this trade, SLs and "you can't win 'em all." Best, Forest

--- 帖子 #271 ---
I didn't take these trades because I was sleeping...but hopefully someone did!

--- 帖子 #272 ---
When to trade versus when not to trade??? You must know when it's best to skip a trade!

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Hi there, I got into two trades but i'm not sure why (which is never a good thing). In the aussie dollar there's a HL close to the 20 MA and MACD slopping up. Is this enough for a entry? On USDCHF the thinking was similar. LH but i think my entry was a bit too late. Charts attached. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #274 ---
I don't see anything wrong with the AU long trade...depending on where you entered, you either made 50pips or got stopped out at breakeven after moving your stoploss up once you reached 35pips of profit. As for U/Chf...I don't follow that pair...so strickly based on your chart it looks like a valid setup short. Just be careful, maybe take a smaller profit than 50, because when you look to the left...do you see all the support where price keeps stalling(around 1.0360 area) than then going back up??? Hope that helps. p.s. make sure you are following the entry rules...you want to enter when price is at/near the 20moving average...don't get in late.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
looks like the market has become rather choppy lately....possibly rangy, but the ranges aren't very well defined. And GU, it's had some wild swings the last 2 days. So until the market figures out which direction it really wants to go...I'll be on the sidelines.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Well, it's been about a week since my last post...but that's because there hasn't been much in the way of setups with this method for that long. If you have mastered the skill of patience, then the market rewarded you today!!!

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Here's another trade you could have taken...and depending on how you managed the trade you either 1) took 75pips profit 2) took breakeven when it retraced 3) took a smaller profit or 4) might even still be in it and up 50pips or so. The choice is always yours!!!

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Hi Tw0eleven I following up your thread again. I see it has been "cool down" recently? Will you continue to post in this thread? Are you in live with your current trading method? Looking forward to seeing you again. Cheers

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Hi Tradpat, I've been pretty busy lately and the market hasn't given a lot of setups...especially last week. But I have a few setups for this week I will post below. Hope you're finding success!!!

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Here's a couple trades that setup already this week...hopefully someone took them! Due to my day job, I missed them!

--- 帖子 #281 ---
We had a couple EU trade setups already this week. Between the GU, EJ, and 2 EU trades...one could have already netted 100pips this week!

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Here is a setup in real time....

--- 帖子 #283 ---
A quick update...the 20ma was at 107.20, your entry would have been about 107.30 and currently EJ is at 107.80(50pips profit)...so you would move your 100pip stoploss up to breakeven right now if you want to play it safe! ***Side Note*** You always have to be careful when your limits are at/near whole levels. In this case our 75pip goal puts our limit at 108.05. Price may stall before getting to that level(right now I see it reached a high of 107.91)...there would be absolutely nothing wrong with taking profits a little early. 50-60pips is always nice. You just have to ask yourself, is another 15-25pips worth the risk of taking breakeven? If you can handle that aspect of trading...leave the trade open. If you can't, exit the trade!

--- 帖子 #284 ---
75pip target price was just hit as price hit 108.05!!! that would make nearly 200pips profit this week in 3 days of trading! Last week was very slow...this week made up for that! Just goes to show you, you can't force trades...let the market come to you and be patient for it!

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Thanks, 211, your trade explanations are always most helpful. By the way, do you normally let a trade qualify with the 20 line and MACD, THEN allow it to bounce back to the 20 line and take your entry then? Obviously, a retrace to the 20 does frequently happen, I just wondered if that retrace is something you wait for prior to taking your position? I've been away this week from trading and last week was pretty dead. Looks like my weeks should have been reversed. You are so right. Wait and let the market tell its story and provide its opportunities. They will come. Forest

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Hi Forest, thank you for posting on here. I was beginning to wonder where everyone went and if it was worth it to keep posting on here! To answer your question, yes...I do perfer to wait for price to close above/below the 20 and Macd to agree, then wait for the pullback to enter the trade. HOWEVER, in a few instances I will enter on candle close(not waiting for the pullback) IF price closes at/near(within 10-15pips) of the 20ma. That doesn't happen to often, but it does every now and then. The important thing is that you have at least 3 reasons(price action, 20ma, macd) to tell you to enter a trade, AND there aren't the same or more reasons not to enter the trades, AND your entry is at/near the 20ma to help reduce risk. Hope that helps...let me know if you have any more questions. Happy Trading and Have a good weekend!

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Forest, i'm not sure about always, waiting for the pullback, I try to, and i know 211 does too. But I "always" wait for the pullback although i use the 21ema and 211 uses the 20 lma. The problem is occasionally, I slip and take a trade that doesn't meet the rules. the problem with not waiting is, if it works, then you think you were justified. if it doesn't, then you now think your kids wont' get to go to college. it boils down to the money management. and trading style. if you can let the runners run a bit with partials, then you probably don't have to be right so often and you can probably handle a bit higher draw down. in this system with taking pips at the set level, i think it is critical to wait for the pullback. for me, its about the psychological capital. i don't like to see big draw downs, when i know that all i would have had to do was wait for the pullback. hope this helps Scottie

--- 帖子 #288 ---
Took a short on the AUDUSD, I was late in, watching cable too closely, so pulled the plug at 9100 but it was a nice set up I thought. We had price going sideways for a while then a clear break, nice bear candle, pull back to the 20 then the next 4 hour candle turns negative at .9134

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Hi Paj -- The great thing about this approach is one can be 'a little late' and frequently still enjoy a nice trade! Actually,this is one of the lessons of this style. Surely, late is usually better than early. Thanks for posting your success. Regards, Forest

--- 帖子 #290 ---
I would agree with what Forest Sea said...usually late is better than early. I don't recommend making it a habit to get in late though...but if for some reason you are late, make sure you don't look for BIG winning trades/profits. If the normal goal is 75pips with an entry at/near the 20ma....then "late" entries should be 50, 40, or 25pips depending how late you are.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
How unusual . . . Actually, I have another question for 211, Scottie and all. Feel free to chip in your individual thoughts. Two, I know you really follow three big pairs. I currently track with some attention about 9 . . . pretty much the majors, etc. Why, Two, do you restrict yourself to just three? I know you are busy (work, infant, family et al), BUT on the H4 it doesn't take much time to check a few more. One good reason to NOT follow too many might be the high correlation among so many pairs. Another possible good reason is the potential for multiple, significant draw downs if you are in, say, on the EJ, GJ, AJ. [ok, none of us would do that] Well, you all get the idea. Anyway, what are you all trading? Should it really be limited to just 3 or 4 pairs? Best to all, Forest

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Hi Forest-Sea, To answer some of your questions...I do follow/watch 8 pairs( AU, EU, GU, EurGbp, UCad, GJ, EJ, UJ). However, as you said, I mainly just trade GU, EU and EJ. Occasionally I'll take an AU or UCad trade. But I have found that the previous three mentioned are more than enough for me(100pips/week goal). And as you mentioned, most of those pairs are correlated...so I wouldn't want to be long AU, GU, EU or short GJ, EJ, UJ all at the same time and have them go against me. Another thing is with the new margin requirements in the US it's probably not too easy to open multiple trades. The EG and UJ pairs I typically don't trade, I just use them to see how the other pairs are moving...and I find that GJ just has some pretty wild swings at times so I just stay away. Hope that helps, let me know if you have any more questions.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Two, Have you attempted to put together a win/loss ratio for the 4 Hour KISS? This is quite different from 'how many pips' or 'how much money.' Those are personal and depend on account size and the size of lots one takes at entry. I can't put an exact % on it, but it looks like no less than 70% of your entries are closed with some profit, often at your TP point. Just wondered if you could offer something a little more exact. Bottom line, no one trades any system for month after month without success. I heartily congratulate you, Andrew, for building a simple but ongoing successful system. You don't trade Fridays. Good idea not to carry positions over the weekend, of course, so enjoy your weekend and three trading days off. Best to you, Forest

Hi Forest, You are correct, I don't think this method is less than 70% win/loss...typically it's 80% or better. But like you said, it depends on the individual trader and how patient they are at waiting for the proper signals...how disciplined they are at waiting for pullbacks to enter at/near the 20ma(not getting in too early or late to trades). If you look at the trades this week just on the 3 pairs I normally trade. GU gave a short setup on Tuesday good for 75pips and both EU and EJ gave short setups Wednesday morning good for 50 and 75ipps respectively. 3 trades, all winners(100%) for a total of 200pips! But how many traders are patient enough to NOT jump into any trades on Sunday or Monday???? This method is about 95% mental discipline and chart reading. I hope you are finding success with it!

--- 帖子 #295 ---
I'm still mental, but the success rate is good. every once in a while i do something stupid and waste some capital from my account. but this is a labour of love. i enjoy it and its starting to work. not something that takes a month of knowledge and you are there. but the success rate seems 80%. with some chart reading. 211 and i have traded together for over 3 years. we watch the same pairs. our systems are almost identical. we have researched and tried many different things. one of the biggest things we came up with was to watch price action. then we discovered price action in the direction of the trend. my biggest problem is not waiting for the candle close. look at ej and eu yesterday. i had a nice short entry on both of those. what did i do? took profits early. did i need to? apparently not if i conscientiously waited for the close, i know i'd do better income wise. so that is my new goal. Wait for the close whether i'm staring at the charts or not.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
I like this system very much. I have made 5 trades within one week (from Sept. 2nd until today) and all of them were winners. All 5 trades with TP between 40-50 pips and SL between 35-45 pips. Most of these trades were good for 70 pips and one trade (EJ) even for 250 pips! I always check also daily and weekly time frame and only trade when the MA of all 3 time frames move in the same direction. Thanks 211 for this great system.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Well, I am behind 211, Scottie and fguru on the patience and mental angle so crucial to success . . . BUT you are really helping me edge in the right direction. I think what I am trying to show myself is that the KISS rules followed pretty carefully do yield that 70-80% win rate. Jump in too soon, or skip one of the 1-2-3 guides and negative things might happen. Of course, the counter in my mind to this is that those 'no quite qualified' entries can lead to bigger gains if you are not trading for a fixed number of pips. (I suppose this means you can and do really watch the screen during live trades) Are any of you taking multiple entries and making a fixed profit your TP1 then you keep going with a second or possibly more positions? Thanks to all and good weekend.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Someday I'm going to bring myself to hold the trades or part of the trade and use these targets as take profits #1. being able to follow the ma's in the direction of the trend could be very profitable several times a year. I just haven't been able to let myself do that yet. also, i haven't been able to walk away from the charts very long when in a trade. with this system, i think it would greatly help my profitability. the one thing to remember, if i could at least hold consistently for the target, this will be a great living. by the way, i just went long ej. see where it leads. i don't like the macds being down, but everything else is starting to line up.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Hi Forest-Sea, I don't recommend taking multiple entries UNLESS you are cutting your lot size in half in order to account for 2 trades being open. Always use good money management, don't over leverage yourself or trade too big of a lot size! Now that being said, my target prices of either 50pips or 75pips depending on the pair are what I like to use. Anyone can feel free to use something else...and there have been many cases where I have seen that leaving a trade open longer, instead of taking the 75pip hard limit, would have gotten a trader 100, 200, even 500pips if the trend was strong enough! However, how often do those type of trades happen? Each trader has to figure out what type of trader they are! Can they be happy taking 10 trades where you're looking to get 50pip winners about 80% win/loss ratio??? Or can they be happy taking 10 trades where you're going for 500pips and only win about 10% of the time??? In the end, it would appear both types of traders would get 500pips...each individual just has to figure out how they want to go about it(or what they are comfortable with). Have a good weekend!

--- 帖子 #300 ---
All right, I am going to watch each candle end/start for the KISS this week, including the one that rolls in the middle of my night. In looking at where we are now, it raised another question. I have been reluctant to take any trade in which the slope of the LWMA 20 was not at least slightly moving in the direction of the cross and new trend. However, I am seeing that the touch or cross of the 20 will not infrequently occur PRIOR to the 20 turning (up or down). 211, Scottie and all, what do you guys do in this case? Let's say the MACD bars are clearly moving in your direction and price has crossed the 20, BUT the 20 is not yet flattened out completely or turned. Good trading week to all. Forest

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Forest, lets say there was an extended move down and i'd like to go long. that first touch of the 21 after the break will usually still bounce down, so i don't like to go long that soon. i wait till it retests the low and makes a higher low and higher high or closes higher than a bunch of candles above the 21. these higher lows and higher highs need to be a fractal that takes several bars to make. the pattern at that point is complete and i'll take the pullback long. Scott

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Makes perfect sense. Fractal idea interesting. Will add those to my chart, I think. Forest

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Looks like the E.J is 'qualified' to trade down . . . also A.J but maybe no one is looking at it. Time = 1040 {NY}. I'm just seeing this now in Pacific time. QUESTION: do any of you drop down to the H1 (lower?) for actual entry? I am noticing the H1 is actually sliding up counter to the anticipated drop from the H4. OR . . . do we say, once qualified, including having bounced back up on a retrace that we should just plunge in here. Note: due to my lateness getting to the screen, I am late for entry. An optimal entry would have been some hours ago, BUT the price hasn't moved much. WELL, CURRENT CANDLE IS PUSHING 100 PIPS UP. PROBABLY WAS AN ENTRY NEAR THE LONDON OPEN. POSSIBLY A NEWS RELEASE SPIKED THINGS THIS AM. I DIDN'T LOOK AT WHAT WAS COMING OUT YET. I think the question is still a good one. Thoughts? Thanks, Forest

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Sorry for the late response, I have been traveling today. You are right, at least for me...I don't watch the AJ charts. Also, to answer your 1hr entry question...I do not enter off the 1hr chart. All my entries/exits are off the 4hr chart. HOWEVER, I do look at other timeframes(1hr, Daily, Weekly) just to get an idea of price action, the trend and where some prior support/resistance areas are. As for trades today...it was an interesting day! Speaking just about the 3 primary pairs I trade...GU was just in a range, so I basically ignored it this week. EU had a nice run up in price that started last week, had a pullback early this morning that only came within 17pips of the 20ma(so not close enough for an entry)....and EJ was tricky...you had EU going up but UJ going down so EJ was basically fighting and struggling to pick a direction. When EJ closed below the 20ma this morning MACD was still heading up, the 20ma was still at a good angle up, AND most importantly if you look at that candle that closed below the 20ma...it was a pullback to prior broken resistance area from last week on Sept. 8th and 10th...this was the FIRST retest of that area(107.00 area). So for me, I was actually thinking longs on EJ instead of shorts. Good questions you have posted...keep them coming!

--- 帖子 #305 ---
If you were patient again this week, you were rewarded! One comment on the chart examples below...you'll see I stuck with the standard profit targets of 75 and 50pips. Who knew that the BOJ would intervene in the markets last night thus causing big rallies in the JPY pairs??? Definitely not me! And it's the first time since 2004 that they have done that...so for those of you who want to say "why didn't you go for more profits"??? Well, it would have been nice...but you have to be honest...do you get these types of moves that often???? Once every six years??? I'm more than happy taking 50-75pips each week instead of 200pips once every six years!!!

Could be a very good week!

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Good say, 211! U r very discipline... I am learning from u Allow me to ask... In general, hope u don't mind, how many trades you made in the past months using your trading method upon the right set ups shown? Thanks &amp; Cheers

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Hi tradpat, I wouldn't say I'm very disciplined, I still make my fair share of mistakes from time to time. But if you can manage to follow the rules of this system, I see no reason why you won't be profitable. As for your question about how many trades I have taken...to be honest with you, I don't have that information readily available. I keep track of how many trades(winners/losers) I have each week...but some of my trades are not based on the 4hr method but sometimes just price action alone. So if I were to give you the trades I have taken, that information could be misleading to you. Also, since this method is based on price action...and everyone reads charts a little differently, there might be some trades I would take that you would not...or trades you would take that I would now. So that could also be misleading, which I don't want to mislead anyone. I can still post my numbers if you would like, just let me know...and understand that some of my trades are not based solely on the 4hr method.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Tw0eleven, I miss your posts. Or you are waiting for good setups?

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Hi Happy, I've been a little busy at home and with work. Also, there doesn't seem to be much interest in this method....so I've been a slacker. There were a few trades this week. GU has given a couple long entries. EJ just gave a short entry this morning. EU looks like a possible long, but don't let that fool you...I see it's had quite a run up in price and appears to be breaking a trendline down...so I wouldn't go long right now. And I wouldn't go short because it hasn't closed below the moving average either...so skip any EU trades right now. AU is the only other pair I see right now, possible short setup. Hope that helps! Happy Trading!

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Hi I don't know for the others but I like your metod. These trading possibilities I have seen, only with EJ is not clear for me - why short? We don't have TL braek, we don't have LH/LL? I don't trade this metod, by I like it and follow the possibilities. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Check the attached picture. TL was broken. Price closed below the MA and the next candle (12 GMT) pulled back of the MA and went short 60 pips.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Thank you, it seems, I look to the wrong TL

--- 帖子 #315 ---
i dont understand your system.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Its a very easy system. If you read the thread you should understand it...

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Thanks for answering that.

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Easy to learn yet difficult to master... Tw0eleven: I have been enjoying this thread a great deal. Your method(s) certainly gets to the heart of successful trading in my opinion (price action, S/R, trendlines, etc.). I am a longtime lurker on FF and finally felt compelled to come out of the shadows for one reason only -- to beg you not to let this thread die! Your charts and chart notations are very clear and instructive (among the best I have seen on FF). The more you and others post charts using this method the more I seem to get the hang of it.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Thank you for your kind words and I'm glad you are enjoying this method.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Some asked for them, so they get them! I don't really see any setups this week yet, but here are a few from last week that I hope some people were able to get some pips on. The First chart is of the GU. It has ALL the elements you want of a good trade setup. The Second chart is of the EJ. It has "MOST" of the element you want...notice that I said "most" and not "all" like the first example. I'll let you all read the notes on the chart and see if you can figure what the difference between the two trades. Just one note I'd like to add, I'm not saying NOT to take the EJ trade setup, it was a good one. However, just be aware...if it's not the "Best" setup it's slightly less likey to work.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
I agree. Excellent, simple charts. Beautiful. It is all you need. That unsuccessful trade is Unusual. It was worth taking. Like the rest of you waiting for that good set-up to come. Forest

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Just trade on the right side of the 20ma and you'll be right most of the time...

--- 帖子 #323 ---
There are a lot of EA's out there and I'm sure some of them could work...but you just can't replace the human thought process. And with this method, I don't believe you could ever use an EA...you MUST be able to reason when a trade to trade and when NOT to trade. Here are two examples, EU and EJ, where a computer EA would have most likely gotten you into a trade...but you can see with human reasoning, you would stay out of the market.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Let's see if I have this down -- On the AUD/USD right now: 1) Trendline is up so look for longs. 2) Priced fell back to 20 ema (the 20 was pierced but close of candle was above 20 ema). 3) MACD sloping up. 4) Price bouncing up off of trendline. 5) No reaons to NOT trade that I can see so... Nothing left to do but go long @.9625 (with a 75 pip stop loss in place), sit back and wait. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Looks like pretty sound reasoning. I see your 75pip stop loss...but what is your planned exit point??? For AU, EU, UJ I recommend 50pip limits. However, you are free to use whatever you want! My only question is that your MACD indicator looks very different from mine, even though I see you are using the same settings(24,52,18) that I am. Anyway, if you entered at 9625, it looks like you already have 50pips profit! Nice trade! Thank you for taking the time to post on here!

--- 帖子 #326 ---
Thanks. I moved my SL up to BE when the price was up 20 pips and began trailing the stop when price was up 25 pips. It looks like I am about to get stopped out in the next few minutes but a profit is still a profit! The 75 SL looked a bit large to me as well but seemed to fall just under a resistance level... in the future I may tighten them up a good deal more. I think I would rather get stopped out early and re-enter a trade than give a trade too much breathing room as I did this time and lose a week's worth of gain in one bad trade. I have no idea what I did to my MACD!!!! It looked normal until I started monkeying around with the settings. Now I can't get it back the way it was -- I will have to work on it LOL. I think I got into the trade a bit late but I like having confirmation from rising candle after the first candle closes above the 20ema.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Here is another one that looks promising. 1) The main trend is down and this is a shorting opportunity. 2) MACD appears to be heading down and has recently crossed below the zero line. 4) Price recently broke out of a consolidation area (gray lines), retraced back to the 20 ema and appears to be heading down once again. Placed Sell order at 9768 (looking for the addition of momentum to hopefully be on my side so I placed it a bit lower than where price is currently). 50 pip SL (which is just above the 20 ema). Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #328 ---
Thanks for posting again...I don't typically look at CHF pairs, but from your chart..it looks like a good trade setup. In my humble opinion, the entry point was when price pullback to the 20ma. Not only was the 20ma acting like resistance...if you look to the left you can see all that prior support area that price finally broke through and is now acting like resistance as well!!! Entering at/near that prior resistance area &amp; 20ma gives you a great entry point for minimal risk. But that's just my opinion. Nice work and keep it up!!!

--- 帖子 #329 ---
You are correct. The best entry was when price was much closer to the 20 ema. I got into this trade too late (again) and then may have moved my stop up too quickly (again). Just stopped out for a 12 pip gain as price began to retrace a bit. Well, two small winning trades in a row when they could have been larger winning trades may be a bit frustrating but they sure beat a kick in the head anyday!

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Just want to say your recent chart analysis EJ + EU are excellent! Very good reasoning! I am again learning your highly patience skills! Keep up the great work! Cheers

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Thanks Tradpat. I appreciate the kind words. The trades don't always work out as planned, but it's nice when they do. I just hope others are able to learn something here and be profitable!

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Well, I must admit...GU got me yesterday! I went for the short setup and it ended up being a loser. However, there was a long setup right after that that was a winner. A couple comments about these two trades I want to make clear: 1) You will NOT be a winner 100% of the time with this system or any system that I'm aware of. But that doesn't mean you won't be successful! 2)I want to stress that PROPER trade management and money management will keep you trading and profitable!!! Even though I use an initial 100pip stoploss(and that's just in case the market REALLY does something wild and goes against you)...most of the time you will only have a 50pip or less loss. Now if you take a 50pip or 75pip winner after that....you are already back to breakeven or in a small profit for the week!!! Think about that... you took 2 trades, 1 loss and 1 winner( A 50% win/loss ratio)...AND YOU STILL HAVE AN ACCOUNT TO TRADE WITH!!! If you just follow the 1-2-3 rules about entering a trade and you have a good idea how to read Price Action....you will be SUCCESSFUL MORE THAN 50% of the time with this method!!!

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Here are a couple more examples of trades from last night/this morning: 1) EU...this one was pretty simple, just follow the trend...be patient for the pullback to the 20ma and pounce on it! 2) EJ...I put this example in here to show you guys/gals what your thought process should be on what to look for ENTERING trades and WHEN NOT TO Trade. Always remember, you need ALL of the 1-2-3 conditions met(price action, price in relation to the 20 moving average, and MACD) for a good, valid trade entry setup!

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Ok, first...I DON'T recommend taking all of the previous 4 trade examples I showed. In reality, there were only 2 good trades that should have been taken. HOWEVER, for those of you who are new, not the best with price action yet, and/or just made a simple mistake like I did(on that first gu short trade)....I want to stress the importance of proper discipline,trade management, money management!!! 1) You MUST follow the exit rules just as you would the entry rules. Take that GU short trade setup...the exit rules state you have to exit on the first candle that closes on the opposite side of the 20ma from where you entered. So I went short GU with price below the 20ma...the first candle that closed above the 20 is where you exit. It resulted in a 40pip loss...that's a fairly small loss for a 4hr timeframe trade! Small losses keep you in the trading game!!! That's where Discipline comes in..FOLLOW THE RULES!!! 2) Had you not closed when you did and made the rookie mistake of waiting for price to pullback to where you could exit at breakeven...That would NOT have happened...GU never pulledback that far. You would be down about 100pips right now...you just DOUBLED your loss by not following the rules!!! That's where Trade Management comes in...or in this case, LACK OF Trade Management because you didn't do a very good job of keeping your losses small! 3) Now for whatever reason, lets say you took all 4 trades. GU Short for a 40pip loss, GU long for a 75pip gain, EU long for a 50pip gain, EJ long for breakeven and EJ short for breakeven. Add up all the gains/losses and you would have shown a GAIN of 85pips for the week so far!!! That's pretty good in my humble opinion for only having a 50% win/loss ratio! Had you taken the valid trade setups(GU long and EU long)...you'd be up 125pips!!! That's pretty good Money Management and that's the power of this method!!!! Trade Smart everyone!!!!

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Bravo! Patience Trading = Profit! I am learning, again! Thanks 211! BTW any chance if you can "convert" your H4 trading method into Daily tf? Reason - I am a full time employee and family man. Watching Daily is an alternative for me. Cheers

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Hi Tradpat, I haven't really looked that closely at trading this 4hr method on the Daily. I HAVE briefly looked at it on the Daily, Weekly, Monthly Charts....they all seem to work fairly well. BUT, and that's a BIG BUT...I have no clue what the stoplosses would be or the profit targets. Nor do I know how close price would need to pullback to the 20ma in order for you to get an entry. On the surface, the basical rules seem to apply and work. You'd just have to figure out entries and exits. ALSO, it would take a TREMENDOUS amount of patience on the Daily. It looks like you would only get 1 entry per pair maybe once every week or two??? Maybe not even that often. Wish I could be of more help.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
I have been following your tread with some interest, it all appears common sense. I am trying to set up on MT4 as per your template but don't have the same MACD as you. Could you please post your template? Thanks WickstedFX

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Hi WickstedFX, Thanks for speaking up and posting on here. You are absolutely correct...this method is about common sense. The simple, basic rules traders learn when they first begin trading fx. Rules such as, "The Trend is your Friend," "Be Patient," "Be Disciplined," "Use Good Money Management." Trading fx does NOT have to be difficult. It's 90% mental, 5% technical and 5% luck in my humble opinion. As for your question, a template is attatched. Welcome aboard and please post some chart examples of trades you are thinking about taking or have already taken!

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Thanks TwOEleven I appreciate the template I having spent the last few hours reading thro the entire thread (working from home today..!) I see you have lost the lines on the Macd and also the 5 MA. Am I right in thinking for a long you need the Macd graph above zero and moving up, the price to be above the 20 MA. Do you then look for PA and or candle formation to go long or are you looking for a pull back to 20MA before pulling the buy trigger? Thanks WFX

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Hi WickstedFX, There are 3 main things to look at for a trade setups..First(and most important) is Price Action. Second is the 20 MA(make sure you are trading on the correct side of it...longs above it, shorts below it. And Third is Macd(just the histogram). Now to answer your question about Macd...the BEST setups are when macd is heading in your direction AND on the correct side of the zero line! Example: You want to go long...make sure Macd is heading up and above the zero line. HOWEVER...there are times when it's perfectly fine to go long when macd is heading up, but it's still below the zero line. But that will have to be your decision to make...If Price action and the 20ma are obviously telling you long is the way to go...then go with it. Just be cautious that the trade "might" not work out.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Hi Tw0eleven Thanks, I appreciate your thinking. Have a good weekend Cheers WFX

Hello Everyone, Nothing much going on to start the week. There are a lot of big news events this week, so I'm really not sure what to expect. We could get some knee jerk reactions when news is released...but it may stay choppy since each day brings something new. I don't see much in the way of setups on the charts yet. EU and GU are still in overall uptrends so I would use caution on any short setups(perhaps waiting until a Lower High is formed or a break of the overall trendline). As for EJ...it's a tough call...on one hand the BOJ intervened not too long ago, so shorts might not be good. But UJ is in a pretty strong downtrend, so EJ longs are having a hard time staying up...basically, crappy price action. Wish I had some better things to say...but just sit tight and let Price come to you!!! Trade smart!

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Hi 211, I am using FXDD for the 4 hrs chart, is it ok? Different brokers will have different GMT, it will affect the candle size right? I like this method, simply and pace is not that fast. However, as what u said, we need much patience. Your explanation is great and do con't your posting so I can learn from it. Cheers

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Hi Freedomsg, I think FXDD should be fine. Afterall, we are trading on price action..so just trade what you see. If you can, post a few charts and we can go over them on here. Cheers!

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Hi 211, I attached the EU chart. My vision is price will retrace down and bounce on the trend line and close above the MA with the confirmation of MACD. Than I will have the buy signal? Is my vision correct? :-0

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Yes, that could very well happen. Just make sure you keep an open mind because that's not the ONLY option available. Price could go down, bounce off the trendline and only go a little bit higher and then drop again(forming a lower high and possibly be the beginning of a trend reversal). Also, price may not go down that far to bounce off the trendline. I guess my point is, be patient...let price action develop and tell you what it's going to do. Also, I have attached your chart below...what you said above could happen. Also, another thing to look out for is prior support&amp;resistance areas! The Red circles are where there was prior resistance that has been broken...and you can see that a couple of times price has retraced back down to those prior areas(RED LINES). If you get the correct price action, 20ma touch, macd signals AND price reaches a prior suppor/resistance area, that makes your trade a higher probability of success! Trade Smart!

--- 帖子 #347 ---
With regards to my above post...EU just did the same exact thing I was talking about! It pulled back at/near the 20ma(within 15pips) AND it was also a pullback to prior resistance area that seems to have turned into support!!! One very important aspect of these trades is that if you have a trade setup, you want it to be the FIRST or maybe second retest of these areas. After that, your probability of a successfull trade really goes down.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Based on your above posted E-U chart, can I say one could have triggered a LONG (buy) entry based upon the candle closing as shown in the circle? Pls. comment. Cheers

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Entries don't often come at candle closes...they typically happen while the candle is forming( the pullback to the 20ma ). Now if the candle had closed at/near the 20ma...then you might have an entry at candle close if price action looked good enough. Hope that helps. p.s. if you wait until candle close for entries, you typically miss most of the move!

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Thanks for the note 211.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
OK... it is something like "gut feeling," once we find / feel good set ups, then entries can be made. Good trading to you + all! Cheers

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Well, I hope everyone was very cautious this week and traded smart. There wasn't a whole lot in the way of setups. It looks like GU, EU and EJ gave long setups earlier in the week...but the GU would have ended at breakeven, EJ(depending on where you entered) would have given breakeven or 75pips, and EU(if you happened to catch this one) would have given 50pips. Other than that, it's been pretty choppy with some quick swings in price both directions. I still don't know if you can use this method reliably on NFP news days. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't...so I'll probably just be watching from the sidelines. Have a good weekend everyone!

--- 帖子 #353 ---
I am going over the charts from last week before trading starts this week and I came across this. This is a great example of how to use support and resistance areas to your advantage. This is the AU 4hr chart and you can see there was an area of resistance around .9700 the last week of Sept. Price finally broke through that area on Oct. 6th. Once that area is broken, it typically turns into support....just like it did on Oct. 8th! Those are some of my favorite type of setups when it lines up with the rest of the rules of this 4hr method. One other note, the highest probability trades are FIRST TOUCH trades. What I mean by that is the first time price goes back to retest a prior Support or Resistance area. OR whenever price touches the 20 moving average for the first time after a trend change. Each touch after that becomes less and less probable of a successful trade. Goodluck this week and Trade Smart!

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Thanks for the info 211 How do u see the eu 1 hr tf chart. There was a gap open.. how do u trade it? I limit buy long when it retrace down to 1.3930 area... What is yr view on this setup?thanks

Hi 211 Pls. clarify what you meant for "1st touch" trade. Is it the one bull candle after the doji in the circle? Cheers

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Hi 211, EJ 4 hr slowing diverenge. Price is up but MACD sloping down.. how will you play this setup? Thanks

--- 帖子 #357 ---
This is a somewhat tricky setup. Overall, it seems like we are in an uptrend AND MACD is above the zero line. However, in the short term(last few days)...price has been making Lower Highs and Lower Lows. Price is below the 20ma, we had a trendline/channel break to the down side and MACD divergence with MACD sloping down. So with all that being said, I wouldn't be going long until price stops making new lows. So shorts are the way to go for now, just be careful and look left at prior support/resistance areas where price may stop. You could take profit sooner than the normal 75pip target. Also, since it's not the best setup, you could be conservative and move your stoploss up to break even at +40 to +45pips. Also, you could be REAL conservative and not take any trades at all until a better setup comes along. You have to decide what risk you can/cannot take and be satisfied with. I hope that helps. Trade Smart!

Thanks 211.. you r man

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Hi 211, is the trandline for this pair valid?

--- 帖子 #360 ---
1st touch just means the first time price touches the 20ma after you get a close above or below the moving average. I also call is the first retest or fist pullback. Hopefully the chart below will explain it a little better. Just don't forget, you must have all the other criteria met before taking a trade.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
The green trendline you drew looks good to me...we are in an uptrend. And price is above the 20ma. However, I would be cautious on taking a long AU position right now...price action on your chart shows that AU just made a Double Top(pretty close to it) or you can say it made a Lower High. Also, it looks like MACD is starting to slope down and we may have divergence. After the strong run up in price, it wouldn't surprise me if we have some type of correction. Trade Smart!

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Hi 211, thank you for the advice. I am actually thinking for the price to make the thrid tap on the trend line (AU). I am not going long at this moment. Cheers

--- 帖子 #363 ---
There have been 2 trades this week so far....one on the GU that happened last night and one on the EJ that actually setup on Sunday/early Monday. I'm a little disappointed in myself for not seeing the EJ trade and taking that...but I won't dwell on it, must move on to the next trade!

--- 帖子 #364 ---
No worry 211... there will be a trade round the corner man.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Thanks bud. I just noticed the quote at the bottom of your posts...I like that, it's good!

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Hi 211, EJ daily - price is going down but MACD did not. Price went down after the bearish engulf pattern. Soc near oversold... what is yr take? Thanks

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Thanks Br... trying to practise it ... lose opinion and not money

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Hi Freedomsg, I really like the 4hr setups when they align with the higher time frames. Thanks for posting that chart and pointing out the bearish engulfing daily candle last week...that would have been even MORE reason to take the 4hr short setup on Sunday night!!! As for what I think now...I'm still cautious with the EJ. If you look at my chart example below, you'll see there was a long period of rangy movement and resistance(yellow box on the left). And it appeared that price broke above that area this past week(yellow box on the right)...but not it appears price has moved right back down into that area...so it could be choppy trading again. Looks for the good breakout runs and enter on pullbacks...Stay AWAY from rangy price movements! Trade smart!

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Hi 211. thanks for the notes.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
We started out with 2 short trades on GU and EJ this week and are finishing off with 2 long trades on EU. Overall not a bad week, 4 winners for total 250pips. Not bad considering I typically just look for 100pips/week goal...that will help during the slow weeks when I don't reach 100pips! I hope you all are enjoying this thread and finding some success! Have a great weekend.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Well done. Outstanding week. You always 'see' a good deal more than I see. So, thank you for your excellent charts with annotated explanations. Very useful. Also, I know this isn't about MM, but I wonder if you would offer your personal limit (%) per trade? You see people suggesting 2% limits per trade often, do you use this standard or adjust based on your perception of the potential quality of the entry? Maybe accept more risk on 'better' prospect trades? Take care, Forest

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Hi Forest, I use 1mini lot per $2000 in my account. Example, if I had $20,000 in my account I would be trading 1 standard lot. It's a bit aggressive, if you use the standard 100pip stoploss...1 loss would be 5% of your account. I'm ok with that since I'm so use to and experienced with this method. But it's not for everyone!!! For any new traders I would recommend demo trading first OR for those who don't like demo trading...go with something like 1mini per $5000. Or if you want to be REALLY conservative, go with 1mini per $10,000 in your account. The choice is up to each trader and what they are personally comfortabl with. Just remember, TRADE SMART!!!

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Actually, I think this is an excellent answer. You are very comfortable, and successful, with this approach and understand that, over time, you have a positive expected value (gain) per trade. As long as the EV is positive the strong argument is to bump up the risk since the reward is essentially known (maybe not on this trade but over a basket of trades, yes). And, truthfully, many would see that 5% as near the top of a trade risk, but acceptable. I'm not ready to go there, BUT I am glad to know that this kind of trading is very possible. BTW, what program do you use to annotate your charts for posting? Best, Forest

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Hi Forest, I just save the chart from MT4 to my computer...and then I use Microsoft Paint to edit the charts.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
I typically don't post trades ahead of time because I want each trader to learn how to recognize trade setups and trade for themselves....I don't want to be a "signal caller." But, in this case I thought I would help out some new traders to give some insight in my thought process on what I look for before a trade happens....which is basically the same as all my other examples. Whether these trades actually materialize or not is up to the market...but I know what I'm looking for now and where price needs to go in order to enter.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
See AU. I know it's not on your first page of trade preferences. We have a cross of the 20 Now awaiting retest, if any, and for MACD to hopefully turn up although it is slightly positive. Seems to be a valid prospect. Excuse other data on charts. Not for trading the KISS. Forest

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Hi Forest, You know, I was thinking the same thing on AU...but I don't usually trade it, so I didn't mention it. I left it up to you guys! haha Also, I try not to get myself into too many trades at one time...especially is they are all tied together(like AU, EU, GU all are based on the dollar...so you could have 3 losing trades if the dollar is weak and you went short those three pairs). That's another reason I try to stick with EU, GU and EJ. But regarding AU, I don't see a setup just yet. However, it looks like it's making a Lower High...so shorts could be on the table in the next candle or two. Trade Smart!

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Here's the follow up on these trades I posted yesterday morning. Not a bad way to start out the week...2 trades and a 125pips profit! Now we just have to sit back and let the market come to us with the next trade! Trade Smart!

--- 帖子 #379 ---
I hope someone was able to get this trade...I missed it because I was working on the chart examples above that I posted. And this trade happened really quick!

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Hi 211, I took this trade few hours ago. The white arrow show a short term bearlish Harami and two candles later was a bearlish engulfment (orange arrow). I should have wait till it retrace back to the 20 ma (lesson learn). I short at the next candle open after the bearlish engulfment. My question is the exit... how do u place it? I tp 10 pips before the red line. Am i doing it wrongly... thanks and cheers

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Chart attach

Hi 211, I can't see the words clearly... do u mind ...

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Hi Freedom, It appears that you are using a slightly different method than what I show on this thread. My Entries are at/near the 20 moving average. But you entered at candle open after the bearish engulfing candle. You will have bigger draw downs on your trade if you don't enter at/near the 20 moving average...and it will reduce your profits. As for exits...I use 75 pip target profits for pairs like GU, EJ, GJ and only 50 pip targets for EU, AU, UJ. Those are based on entries at/near the 20ma though! The farther you are away from the 20ma, then you have to adjust your profit target to something smaller!

--- 帖子 #384 ---
You should be able to click on the chart example, it will open in a new window and then if you click on it again....it should enlarge it for you.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Hi 211, I was at the office when i trade... and forgot about teh retracement. Ya.. I should wait till it retrace back to the 20 ma. Thanks

--- 帖子 #386 ---
got it 211.. thanks

--- 帖子 #387 ---
EJ 4 hr... bearlish harami + dark cloud + engulf.... Price retrace back to 20 ma... 211... what do u think of this trade?

--- 帖子 #388 ---
I think the entry was on the pullback to the 20ma...if you didn't take it by now, you have to wait for the next trade. It appears the entry would be around 113.40...and price went down to a low of 112.85 a little bit ago, so you'd have a nice little profit at the moment.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Hi 211, EU after a short down trend, a Hammer form and follow by a bullish candle. Do we wait for it to retrace back to the low of the hammer area (which we can reduce our Sl) or wait for it to hit the 20ma and it is also somewhere near the fibo 50% level? The SOC cross and turning up at the moment. Thanks

--- 帖子 #390 ---
Hi Freedom, Very good question! Typically if you just enter at the retrace to the 20ma. And if the hammer area is fairly close to where the 20ma is, then you should be ok. However, if there is some big different like 50pips or more between the two...then you really need to take a look at price action at the 20ma and see if it's stalling or going through it...if it goes through it fairly easy, then you would most likely wait until it retrace to the hammer area. That's a very tough question ask no two trades are exactly alike!

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Thank you 211. Any trades u are watching right now?

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Still waiting for prices to pullback. AU and EU are almost there, GU is a long way off still.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Well, I guess you can't win them all! Quite the turn around on these pairs today. On to the next trade!

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Quite an interesting week...we had some pretty big swings in price. I would have posted this earlier, but I was busy with my day job. Anyway...we started out the week well with 2 winners for 125pips...and then finished the week with 1 loser of 100pips and and 1 winner for 50. So we would have finished up 75pips in profit...not too bad! The first chart shows the 2 EU trades...the first one was a loser and this does happen from time to time. No one has 100% winners. But the second trade made back some of the loss. The second chart shows GU and I decided not to trade that pair because price wasn't at the levels I would have liked to see. Reasons on posted on the chart. Have a good weekend everyone!

Just to say hello! I like 4H trading, and like your approach. Subscribe to this thead and hope to participate soon. Great job! Chris

Hi Chris, What is it about this 4H trading approach that appeals to you? I look forward to more posts from you. I've been reading a lot of the threads on this site, and have found that everyone's perspective has been really helpful in learning the subtle in's and out's of forex trading. Good luck!

Welcome aboard and hope you find much success with this method!

HI, Actually I've sticked with J16 thread for some time, but it's too messy for me. No offence to anyone but there is that many participants, that I got confused. Personally I am not strict follower of "formations". I'd rather have a look and think, will it go further will it retrace now or later? If it retraces now, how far will it go, etc... Seeing the formation gives me a sort of benchmark - first I spot one, then I think - will I agree with that. I also really like 1M formations [I think I should open a new thread about it ], and very often use 1M TF to enter trade signalled at 4H TF, and I always make fist SL adjstment from 1M point of view. I consider myself very near to profitability, since I have really nice strokes of winners, but than psychology goes into play and sudenly I feel not that convinient, or forced to do something, and than I do stupid things. If you'd like to see what I mean this is my demo equity curve: http://www.myfxbook.com/portfolio/in...e-trader/35885

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Here is what I call a trade: Take a look at 4H EU. It has just bounced off 4H trendline up 2 candles ago, yet IF it will go back to 1.3864 to test recent dip it will already be below the trendline. In that case I bet it's going to get even lower. To 1.38 at least... And take MACD for a confirmation if you like it..

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Hi, It's me again. It may have not been a perfect setup, but my short EJ was relying on my general EUR outlook. Here's a 4H and Daily chart of EJ, and here's post on my blog stating, that I short it, so no one tells me that I am smart afterward... BTW I see no new post, did thread died, or is it just no setups around..? Chris

Hi Chris -- I'm still out here and trying to catch some 'correct' signals with the K.I.S.S. Thanks for your entries here, and I did check out your blog. Forest

--- 帖子 #403 ---
So you must be extremaly picky I like it... Personally I add a touch of fundamental outlook, so my setups don't need to be perfect everytime...

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Hello Everyone, I've been pretty busy the past couple of weeks with my full time job and some personal things. I hope you guys played it safe last week with all the major news releases! There were some trade setups and some wild moves. My daily schedule is getting a little more busy these days so there probably won't be many posts. I hope you guys continue to post. Also, I typically like to take the month of December off as a break from trading and to enjoy the holidays...don't ever forget you enjoy life!!!

--- 帖子 #405 ---
i see you changed to my technique 2eleven ... the break of the twenty and pullback to s/r level as of earlier in the thread .. just before you revamped your system . cant blame you !

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Well, I'd have to disagree with you there. I still enter trades on pullbacks to the 20ema...if they happen to line up with prior s/r levels that's even better. But the 20ema is where I like to enter. On another note, this thread was started in March 2010, where as your thread was started in May 2010(2 months after mine)...so one might say that you are using my techique!

--- 帖子 #407 ---
I see gold short opportunity. Not sure, shall it be called KISS trade, but taking into account rise of USD I see nothing but fall on gold (at least $20, where I put my first target). i terms of formation I would call it descending something...

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Hi, I like bearish shape of GJ, with bottom @ 132.17 (grey square). Unfortunately there Is important support exactly @ 131.00, and round number (yellow line). Both they may bring some volatility, however after few wipsaws I would still think of entering later somewhere around here (as long as price won't just plunge 50 pips below 00 line in few minutes)

Linear Weighted Moving Average.

any more trading?

--- 帖子 #412 ---
Since you have waited 6 months for an answer I can say Yes! I bought the $/Y this morning (8 am cdt) and caught 27 pips and it should have been a lot more but I screwed up the trailing stop. But 27 is 27 so I'm not complaining.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
I am long the $/Y @ 78.333 (07:13cdt/us). I have a buy stop for the E/gbp @ .8029 - a fair distance from the current price but I have had far too many stop entry order get hit and then retrace dramatically or even just reverse so now I make sure they are clearing old s/r, hi/lo, etc. edit (13:55 cdt) - got out early on the $/Y as the candle bodies were getting smaller &amp; smaller, +23 pips. TheEur/gbp buy stop was never hit after 3 hrs, I closed it.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Hello 211 I notice you are still active in FF Just wonder you are still trading this method or not? If you can come back and post more charts, it would be great to see your thread re-active Cheers

--- 帖子 #415 ---
For this strategy I only look at 8 prs, ones most likely to have good volume during the NY session. Consequently I don't see a lot of possibilities but it is a good strat. And I too wish this thread was more active even for trades during other sessions. p

--- 帖子 #416 ---
what are the 8 pairs?

I went long the gbp/usd this morning at 07:17 cdt/US; it is the start of the next 4 hour segment. Entry @ 1.1635?SL=1.6088/TP=1.6191, a slightly better than 1:1 RR (but not much.) The pr is not moving very much and price action is pretty much over until the Asian, which ain't that great either. Good trading all. p.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Dear Mr Andrew I am very new in forex I wanted to try your system, but I can not find the indicator you are using on google and forums. Are you willing to explain it to me? I am currently using a stochastic, Bollinger and mfi. Since yesterday 16/10/12 at TF 4 hour candle 3rd, the euro is over-buy, but why is the euro still up? I've followed your advice to not follow the news, and follow the indicators. But now I am confused what to believe. I am very grateful if you would give me an explanation. Email me bennydjatmiko@gmail.com Thank you very much

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Hey everyone!!! WOW, it's been a long long time since I have visited this thread! To be honest, I'm quite surprised anyone is using it....I thought it died out a long time ago so I stopped keeping up with it. For those of you still using this method, how is it working for you??? Just a little update about me...I have adjusted things and no longer use the 4hr method. In fact, I use a combination of the 15min chart and 1hr chart for trades and look for approximately 50pips per trade. Some of the basics in this new method are still the same(I use Price action, chart patterns and a few moving averages) and I use a Stochastics indicator instead of a macd now. When I get a little bit of free time, I'll try to post some charts on here and explain things. Probably this weekend at some point. Cheers! P.S. If you are using the 4hr method and it's profitable for you...GREAT! Glad it has helped.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Here's a sneak peak at the chart setup I use now... The a break&amp;close below the right shoulder &amp; moving average is going to be KEY as to whether we continue down or not.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Not quite sure how to make a poll question on here so I'll just ask... Since my adjusted method is similiar to the 4hr, but it uses a 15min chart for entries...do you guys want me to keep posting on here or start a new thread? Thanks for the input!

--- 帖子 #402 ---
I think a new thread is better.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
I agree, start a new thread. I haven't been very successful with the 4H the last 2 months. p.

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Sorry to hear it wasn't been very successful. Does that mean there hasn't been a lot of trades? Or has there been a lot of losses? Or is it about 50% winners/50% losers? I think a lot of things changed during the 2008 financial crisis...the market is a lot more erratic and irrational. So for me personally, the less time in the market = less risk. That's part of the reason I have switched down to a 15min timeframe. p.s. I will start a new thread for the new method...just bare with me as it may take a few days as my time is limited at the moment.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
I'm down 5% in my live acct so switched back to demo. I am looking at a 15M TF strategy but it is a huge thread and traders there are trading everything from the original 15M strategy to the D. all the while adding &amp; deleting indidicators Joining the thread late has made making sense of it nearly impossible. So please, please keep the new thread based around your concept (15M/1H) and if you change the strategy be sure to revise Post #1 or start another thread. thanks for your work and looking forward to the new idea. p.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Glad to see your posting. Any chance you would share with us why no longer trade H4 tf? A new thread for your lower tf would be a better option. What are the MAs? Cheers

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Let us know in this thread that you have started a new one and then of course the new title - wow, what foresight I dispense.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Here's a chart from today(current)...I managed to short EU at 1.2984 and take 50pips profit. Sorry I haven't started a new thread yet...it's on my "to do" list, I just need to find the spare time. So until then, here's a chart. Also, be careful shorting EU anymore today...support is at 1.2920 right now, also you have some major news later with Draghi speech and US interest rates....price could produce some major swings!

--- 帖子 #409 ---
While I think overall, the 4hr tf is less stressful...I just personally prefer to spend less time in the market(less risk). If I can take anywhere from 20-50pips per trade and only be in the trade for a couple hours or less I'm pretty happy. As we all know, the market doesn't move just one way...it's Up and Down...Moves/retraces. I'd just like to take a small amount of those moves...so that's why I switched. As for the ma's, they are your normal 50ema, 200ema and there is 13ema and 800ema. As we all know, the 50 and 200 are the ones most used by traders. And since I prefer using the 15minutes chart...the 13ema is there because it basically represent the 50MA on the 1hr chart( 13 times 4 = 52...pretty close to the 1hr 50). And the 800 would represent the 50ema on the 4hr chart( 800/4 = 200 on the 1hr and 200/4 = 50 on the 15min). So basically, with those 4 ema's on the 15min chart you get the 15min 50&amp;200, the 1hr 50ema and the 4hr ema. The higher the MA, the stronger the support/resistance normally is. hope that helps.

Opportunity perhaps?

Hi I really like the system on M15, thankyou for sharing . I am very interested in finding out more. I am interested in finding out more about how the moving averages are used to guage trend. I love the fact that it is very price action focused. Are candlesticks reliable on M15?

--- 帖子 #415 ---
They are reliable as long as you are backing it up with price patterns, the moving averages, stochastics...and it doesn't hurt to take a quick look at the 1hr and 4hr charts to make sure you aren't trading against any obivious price/candlestick pattern that contradicts the 15min chart. Again, use MUST use the candlestick patterns WITH other confirmations...not just by themselves. You want 3 or more reasons to enter a trade. Also, if you have 3 or more reasons NOT to enter a trade, it would probably be safer to stay out of a trade. Everyone needs to be disciplined and try to pick the BEST setups...NOT trade every setup!

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Thankyou so much Tw0eleven. I love the H4 system, very price action focused. I am keen to learn more about the M15 system. Like yourself I find the stop size more attractive in the lower timeframes.
