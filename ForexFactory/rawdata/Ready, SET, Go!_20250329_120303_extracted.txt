Stupidly Easy Trading - Trading Blog !!!!!!!!!! UPDATE !!!!!!!!!!!! So to all of those who might have read the original post here, I have come to a conclusion and finally understood what am I actually seeing and wanted to share this with you. Basically the Title is the same STUPIDLY EASY! And I am putting all my efforts not to call it this system as that. Let me put things right and ask you to SKIP!! all posts until Post #15 - and based on what you read HERE! check those pictures as well and you will see what I mean. So BASIC! rules which applies to every where and these basic rules will be our main guides. An UP-Trend is always followed by? A Down trend right? And Vicaüversa. Down-Trend is followed by an Up-Trend. Now here comes the most important Fact we will EVER! need. A trend alawys breaks. In my opinion, most people fail to understand when and how a trend can be drawn. I believe, when I draw a trend line, that trend line must cover everything. Which means, it always goes on the wicks, and always have only! 2 points. Let me show you clean and not too clean examples. If you check the EURUSD Monthly chart, this is the actual picture that everyone should see: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The trend has a starter point and a 2nd point which are interconnected and it covers everything inbetween and it has ben extended towards the future. Now what is not visible at first is how we got here. I will show you how this trend has evolved over time! Attached Image (click to enlarge) So in this picture you can see that the very first trend line was drawn as shown, which trendline got broken, and then the trend continued to make a new low, then the second trend got broken and continued down forming the third current Monthly main trend. Now forming any of the new trend lines can be concluded only! if the previous trend's all time high or low depends on the trend gets broken. Here the green lines mark the spot. Now comes the question, how come that a trend contionued, where as the actual trend line was broken? And also the question comes, how can we trade this?? Let me show you my understanding on how this can be traded easily. A full trend break would happen ONLY! if the 2nd leg's price geats broken. Failing to do so, the trend will continue making newer lows or highs. Attached Image (click to enlarge) On this image, you can see that the Orange lines were not broken, at all. So our best guess was when it started to come down, is that if it forms a new low, we know where the price will be going right? Towards the previous green line. Anywhere below that green line, is a good chance to aim for a trend line break. Which means, that the trend full filled its main purpose and validated it self by creating a new low, so from there, the next thing to happen is to get it break. Hence we are aiming for our trend line. We might not get to the orange levels, but we also know, that the trend line won't just be touched, but must be crossed. So Good profit can be made on this guess, and the best is, we can actually automate this. Leave a pending order in the green zone, set an alarm for the trend line break, and you can forget the pair for good. Now What you see is a really interesting scenario. Our current main trend has been validated and made a new low, so the next step is to break the trend line. We had a strong bump off, but eventually that is the goal. Our first goal is to have the the price above the trend line and get some profit. Now the only place for entry has been passed, any where this close is a bit too risky reward ration wise, so I don't recommend it as a long term investment. Now this is a monthly chart, but this setup works on every time frame and every stock, forex,crypto chart. I will share some examples. Using the same colours, should give you an explanation on what I am seeing and how thes can be traded. Please continue on Post 15!!! AND AS ALWAYS - YOU TRADE ON YOUR OWN RISK

Progressive trend is when, we set up a trend line, that gets broken, but the correction does not reach the 2nd Leg of the trend, so it makes a newer high, then we adjust the trendline, and the correction will be its 2nd leg, and our new trigger point. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here it was the 4th correction that appeared to be the final one that actually broke our 2nd leg, and we could trade in that red box. Anywhere in that box is a good short until the bottom of that area. I am planning to make more entries for such areas, maybe split that new move to 10 slots and divide up my trades to incrementing lot's and the further it goes into that box, the more trades I will have and the higher lot size until it gets to the expected new low.

So far USDCAD is in the good direction: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #8 ---
I don't see trades so far that I would happily make so I think this is it for today, let's wait out for TP and try to find other opportunities. I forgot to mention, I think 1H is the best time frame or anything above like: 1D 1W - below the hourly chart is too small to trade and the spread might take most of the profit, but this USDCAD is pretty decent move to trade.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Thanks for your sharing. I dont understand complete how you put the horizontal line. Ist it the first LH for example in an uptrend? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
the horizontal is like the second leg of the trend, but I use the swing close I fee it better than the wicks.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Ok, will study it.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
So technically, I am stopped out on the USDCAD, however I am certain we will get to the marked level, so I will keep an eye on it, why I am certain? I have checked a couple of pairs and different time frames and these always get filled. For example, on one of the paris I check often USDHUF, H1 chart the first 100 formation ended up with 96% instant successrate, I mean without SL hit, the other 4% was Stopped out, but later on, within reasonable time (few days, max 1 week) the TP level was reached. Most of the times I guess news, might have made an entry point, and those extreme candles needed to be corrected before the trend could continue. So, I would say with a 96% successrate, its still okay ish. I am trying to compare how much difference it makes if I use the wicks for Trend lines or if I use the closure point. I am interested in your thoughts, since my dilemma is: - wicks cover all data in that timeframe - closure would eliminate "noise" caused by news" Any better suggestions are welcoem, and I am happy to look through them and I can post my findings

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Here is what I mean: Using closure as the trend line drawing, a progressive trend would appear where on the 2nd stage it gets a nice entry and eventually a TP for the given area, but consifering the stop loss, it would be stopped out before it gets to the TP level. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Using the Wicks on the other hand would not make an entry at this time: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Either the Stop needs to be higher? Which would make it more risky, or using the wicks for an entry. However I have examples for the reversed case too, where if I use the wicks, its a trade that stops out with closure it would be a good trade. I was wondering what if I should find the trend killing signal in a different way? Let me know your thoughs or suggestions.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
well, mate...i went on your threads...i like when people have ideas. So thats that. I see that you also like lines/trendlines. Thats ok of course. I am strong believer in rules. If you can write solid rules for this kind of activity, then all is different. But here i see lots of subjective reasoning, which is fine, just not my playground. If you see yourself wanting to go on the road of systematic ideas (each step rule based), then Iam all in. Secondly, keep on.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
So this is the UPDATED! post: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here is a new example on the GBPUSD, As you can see we have passed the entry point and had one month where the chances were really good to step in. However that is passed now. I can imaging that the prices goes back and continues to make lower lows, but in any case those will be our entry points to attack the trendline. I will pick an example to show you how a trend change looks like.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
You clearly identified a downtrend. why are you buying instead of shorting with the trend?

--- 帖子 #17 ---
I have zoomed on to this one to show you what it looks like if your trend is based on two candles! Attached Image (click to enlarge) This is the USDCAD, and here is the big picture. Attached Image (click to enlarge) So as you can see here we had a trend line brake, but had no real time to enter yet. On this front as long as the orange is not broken, we can not conclude that the down trend has truly ended. Even if it makes it to the orange, from there our aim will be the new trend line at the bottom, so right now on a long run, the USDCAD, is more likely to go down. Why? If it does not break the Orange line, it will have to make a new low, if it makes it to the orange line, then it has to come down to the trend line. Of course this is a monthly chart, so this won't happen over night, but if you have long term intrests in some currencies, this is a way to figure out if its a good investment or if it is worth to swap it to something else. At the moment, no I would not trade it on the monthly basis. But its an indication what to expect Now here is an example of a trend change. Attachment g This is the Oil. So as you can see it has made a new high, the uptrend line has been broken, we are really close to breach the orange and conclude the end of the uptrend, finalizing the new down trend. My expectation is that the OIL will dropt to 60 Dollars and we can finalize the down trend. Otherwise it rises up to the heavens, which I don't see likely to happen. The first RED arrow in that green box shows, what were the best time's to sell OIL stocks if you had any, as in those months it was well over priced. Now as you can see, we don't need indicators or anything as such to determine when and how to trade. Also I am sure you are here for more frequent trades, so let's look into the FX market at a lower time frame. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Now I will try to show you, how to "avoid" bad trades, which are likely to happen mostly on lower time frames. This is still a larger time frame, but compared to the monthly for long term investments, this is pretty fast and likely to give more changes, sometimes false ones. Attached Image (click to enlarge) So this image shows that the first are, on a random time of entry would end up on a disater, as the trend line goes above our entry point, which means the likelyness of exiting in profit, is almost zero. So, here is the deal how to minimize the likelyness of this happening and get something like what we see on the 2nd entry. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I have zoomed in to this random entry, to show case why this is a bad entry, I marked the current uptrend with Blue, as that line would have been our target. Now if we ever want to break that blue line, we need to have a confirmation that there is a true Down trend happening right? Something that actually brings the trend change. Now as you see I started to draw the down trend lines and found that the 2nd point of the actual trend has broken, which is likely to happen on long going trends, these can either make a new high, validating the original trend's continuation or it won't make a new all time high, and finally break the original trend, and giving us eventually the new trend's two points. In any case, when we see such cases, the best is to wait for a new top to happen which we now know for sure where will be at minimum and place your shorts there. Anywhere above the 2nd red arrow is an awsome entry to attack the blue line. Now as you see I placed a white trend line on the suspected new Top, which is so flat, that it gives us the best money maker thing in the world. Since it is so steep, it is likely that if you are far from it your entry point will be legit for ages before this flat trend line reaches your entry point, and if you check how far the previous Orange line is, you realize, we are likely to have a new TOP, and not getting to the orange zone. So after the blue line break, our best chances to go for a new top and get some good money. Eventually, it happens, we get a new 2nd leg for our final trend, which finally get's broken. So this is a good way to skip a bad trade. I will post later some more examples on how to skip bad situations.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
To continue on this par there is a good example on a risky situation. Attached Image (click to enlarge) So the screenshot, shows that we had a down trend forming, which was really steep, and it had a continuation right after the first trendline cross. The thick white line is the final trend. As you can see it was crossed, at the time when the price went below the thick white line we could draw a proposed new trend line. Which is proposed as if the trend continues to make a new low, it will be the new main trend line. However, the proposed line was crossed, before making a new low. That was our point of entry. Our TP was the orange marker! When we hit the orange marker, we already had chance to draw the new uptrend's line. As you can see the new uptrend is based on 2 candles. This is an awsome example on how a trend can form. Now for this the most likely situation is that the price will cross this trend line, and will eventually make a newer high. The reason is that a proper trend should form with actual swings as "legs" for the trend. Even tho we use 2 candles as point 1 and point 2. It is still a trend to be formed. As you see with the gray box, there is a huge up swing, that gets broken and finally we can draw a new trend line. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Technically anywhere within the blue triangle was a good chance to trade for a new high TP as the Green marker. Reaching the Orange marker, was a safe confirmation to to enter a trade towards the green line. But our best chances were in the blue area. Finishing up the EURUSD reveals, the following: Attached Image (click to enlarge) As you can see the new trend line that was formed using the low in the blue triangle, gave us two things to know. A new Orange marker for TP, and since we got the green marker reached, anywhere above the green line is a good entry for sorting towards the orange marker, or safer to the new trend line. I would say the orange marker is a better option as it is really close to the trend line since the trend line ended up being pretty flat. And the flatter the trend line the best to trade it. The orange marker was reached, and now we have a new down trend, formed the same way as the previous trend. The point 1 and point 2 are on candles close to eachother and not used on swing tops and lows. This means EURUSD must now aim for the white trend line. So In my opinion, the USD will be more bearish for the coming months, and we will see some up moves, then reaching the trend line, will identify a new Down trend, which will need to continue going down. So what ever will be our turning point, will be our new target. So in short, prepare for trend change now on the EURUSD, after reaching the trend line, short the EURUSD to the previous low and make a good profit.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
The reason is simple. After we make a new Low, there is no real target to reach in this trend anymore other than the trend line, as the price always has to get back to the the trendline. The best chances to short with the trend is close to the trend line. Forexample, here: Attached Image (click to enlarge) We have a major fall, the orange marker for the trend line is so high, it is not likely that we will break it in one go. I would say as predicted with the green drawing, if the prices crawls back above the trend line, short it to the prevous low. This is going to be a good trade, because once that trendline cross happens, we will have a traget to aim for right? Because now you could say, let's short this... But for how long? What is your stop? Right? I will show you what would be my ratio here and where I would step in: Attached Image (click to enlarge) That is close to a 1:9 trade if the price would turn around from tomorrow. With that trade, we have a really good chance to step in and trade with the trend. Because as long as the original orange marker is not crossed, we expect the trend to continue. Escpacially if we are this far away from the orange marker. It is more likely that the trend lines will break multiple times "bringing" the trend braker orange marker closer and closer to the bottom. Like here: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Blue lines are the counter trends which could have or which eventually could change the trend. As you see the first trend line was really steep, so it was likely that if its crossed it will make a new low so there we had good chances. The second attempt to break could have been drawn only after a new low aws formed. My Favourire is the 3rd blue line, when every you see a full or nearly flat trend, that is the absolute easy money. As anywhere above that is a good to sell zone. Of course the best place is above the white trendline where I marked it. But that is truly EZ money, and yes I trade these and yes they bring good money. The 4th one gave an ice entry too, but as you see, once the trend line get's crossed, we need to draw the counter trend to see, if up trend continouse what are chances are. So we had a nice cross, on the blue line as well, also its orange marker was broken, so it was a near perfect setup, the only reason why we are careful is this, the more times the original trend get's compromiesd, the more likely it will eventually change. I know its a bit zoomed out, but if you would try to draw the same pinkis thend line on the previous counter's you would not get them crossed before making a new low. Here it did, which is a strong red flag to quit trades. Since it happened and we were close to the orange marker on our last white downtrend line. It could have been the trand change indicator.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
This is how the trend has evolved: Attached Image (click to enlarge) It gave us a perfect opportunity to enter in the green zone: Moving on: Attached Image (click to enlarge) You can see how the counter trend evolved. Also the entry points for good TP to the green. When the last thick white broke and its orange broke too that was the signal of a turn around. Which left us with a FREE MONEY! Trend line: Zooming out shows how this truly work: Attached Image (click to enlarge) And I know, you can say it had a HUGE up-run, but to me that does not matter for one reason, I know where the price will be. And I will look for indications to step in. I will break down every counter trend now to show you which gave away the turn around. The first counter trend was a really close one: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The Next one gave as a 1:22 Stop:TP ratio, so it was a good call to risk the short: Attached Image (click to enlarge) However eventually we got stopped out: It really depends on what your risk and margin. But the way I trade is I am making money conversion in a 1:1 scale, so if my balance has 10.000K USD I turn around all that to EUR, so I always be having my money with kinda no risk. I mean at this point, I still know that the purple line will need to be reached, so possible I would be in a some sort of a "loss", but only if I would turn back my EUR to dollars as I would get less Dollars at this stage. I can wait out till I get my money in plus, this gives me a hold on this investment as I can't use that money as long as I wait out. And of course if I would do a multiplier, like on most forex platform we can do. 1:30 would eat up an account fast, so it depends on your strategy, With this stop out, its a minimal loss compared to the win ratio, and you know that anywhere above the recent TOPs an even better entry for to reach the Free Money line. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The last one, had a great great chance to get the free money line, as we were 650Pips away... Like that is just WOW, and the trend was nicly set on multiple points. For me after 2 failed push, that is already a good trade I would risk with that stop, aaaaaand not to mention, that our stop can be the trend line, so as time goes by. Mid october our trend line was below our entry, so we could not end up in minus with that one. Getting to the pink line was a huge fall. So from now on the only way is to touch the purple line, and we'll see it from there, likely we will get to a new low again, with a good ration.

Many thanks for your efforts and skills Tools, the system is really good, please stick around and share more

--- 帖子 #23 ---
I think this system has great potential and I like the concept but it's very hard to follow with all the lines on your chart imo. You're also bouncing from idea to idea which makes it even harder to follow. The thread would probably be a bit more popular if your content was more digestible. My suggestion would be to number each line and zone in the picture and then refer to that number when you talk about it. I'd avoid going off on tangents and try to be precise as possible. I'd hate to see this thread die.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Is my analysis correct according to your explanation?

--- 帖子 #25 ---
So If I understand you expect a short, which means your drawing is correct. If the price goes above the trend line you have good chances to reach the previous low so the levels are correct. Here its also wise to see the big picture: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The gold has not tested back the trendline for a while now.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Last one to show today, is an example on ranges: Attached Image (click to enlarge) So this trading method gives us not just an entry but a whole range that gives us relative good chances and timing to look for a trade. If you draw the counter trends, it can even thighen the space for entries. I normally as mentioned, trade with no multiplier. So for me there is no real "stop out" scenario as I swap 1:1 so I am always at my money. Just I can make more dollars by swapping at good times. So for me these zones are just perfect. I will try to show some more precise break downs tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
For GU, are we looking for a long according to my magenta line? or possibly the second image? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #28 ---
The short answer is a "yes" because we need to touch the trend line, however that fall can still ongo for a while and with it the trend line will head further down. The only thing we know for sure is that the trend line will need to be crossed at one day. In this example, I would say, since the trend line is pretty steep, it is more likely that we get a trend continuation and after that maybe a trend turn. This is very steep in my opinion but a major RED news might actually push it to the Point 2. You will see, if the cross of the trend line pushes up close to the point 2, it is likely to be hit.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
This is how far I could go back on the 5m chart on the EURUSD: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I tried to leave some on screen comments so you see how it evolved. Now I want to show you the remains of this whole mess: Without showing whats coming up: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I have removed the possible trades, and wanted to show with the thick purple line, what is our uptrend. As you see it is pretty, flat, so that is the "free money line" I would say as we got our TP at the top, we can already go for the shorts, and aim for that purple line. Literally anywhere above that is a good place the enter. But as I scroll further you will see how violent the chart was. So for those who work with multipliers and have like a 1:30 ration on their account, and does not want to loose money, they probably need to aim for more precise entries, Here is how to get there: Attached Image (click to enlarge) So whenever our counter trends have started, we had an absoliute gorgous space between our entries and our free money line. But most counters died out as their trend was broken and never formed a further low. Each break gaves us a more precise point of entry. as you can see the green boxes shrink and shrink and shrink, showing us how strong that entry became over time. And Also as you see it was a perfect entry at each new top, we had a huge fall, which can bring is money with a trailing stop. But if we measure how far are we to the bottom, using a 2 to win 1 to lose ratio, most of our trades would not stop out. To be fair on these occasions I know how I manage my account, and I dived it to 5-10 pieces. So I would trade a 15% at first and 2nd trade, and turn over the rest I get new chances. Normally I don't draw the boxes, I just tried to visulize my entry zone in a free money line situation. Technically any higher point, is a better entry.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
BTC - Just had a good formation: Attached Image (click to enlarge) It has still more to go up. As it is more likely it goes higher then falls back to the orange marker. I have also marked the proposed new trend line.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
I decided, what if we follow through a single pair, on a single time frame for the rest of the week to see how it goes. I have choosen the EURUSD, I think that is the mostly traded pair, and maybe you can compare our findings to yours: So I will go down to the 5 minute chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I have left some comments, I will keep all thins on the chart as we progress and will see how it goes. Currently we are aiming for Trend line touch. Let's see how it unfolds. I have added a screenshot of the H1 chart: Attached Image (click to enlarge) As you can see we have a HUGE! way upwards, and we have a new counter. We need the counter trend to be crossed, and get a confirmation that it is the true uptrend by not making a new low after its been crossed. So this confirms that the m5 chart will likely to happen according to our plan.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Update: Just got a nice TP: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Also our markers are nearly met: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #33 ---
We need to wait and see if we are making a new low, here is the update on the H1: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Just created a channel using our trend line. That green rotated box shows the best areas to look for counter activity. Also I have a pending buy marker in place. As if that is triggered without making a new low, that is a good indication of a trend change. Let's give it some time.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Seems Like we are not making a new low yet, so I will wait for a new "high" to confirm the H1 counter trend, Attached Image (click to enlarge) So this is how the H1 Looks Like: Attached Image (click to enlarge) As you see the orange marker has not been breached. So to me it is a bit of a wait out to see if I the price get's back to the Sell zone marked on the 5m chart, and that should take the price down to the orange marker. There again, a wait out game will come, to see if we make a new low, or we build a working counter trend.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
As I think about it, I have just missed a good entry. XD Attached Image (click to enlarge) When the trend line got crossed, with a pretty small stop I could have entered, but let's just leave a marker now so we don't forget to look up each opportunity.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Seems Like we are about to get a validated new orange marker on our uptrend line: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Also we we are lucky, we will get into a good sell zone. I need to see the uptrend's orange marker to be crossed on the H1 before I can aim for long term bulls. That long I have mentioned in the previous post is closing to reach the trend line for closure.

Trend line, touched: Getting close to our sell zone: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I still dont really understand, but this strategy is interesting to learn, I will read this thread again from post 1 - 15 , wish there is update what we miss, profit and loss on may - nov and what do you think about nzdusd for now? because the higher trend is down, and already break the rebound line 1 and 2 . and I think the sell confirmation is when its break line 3 (after some consolidation) update : line 3 break, I dont know if this will make nzdusd down for a big move or just small, or still going to make line 4 and 5 like early post (forgot the number)

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Please post your chart for review. and the time frame

It's hard to understand at first, but the further you go, the clearer it becomes....keep it up and thank you . I've had a few trades since yesterday ..system has great potential..

my view on nzdusd, but not sure if this is right....

it almost same as supply and demand strategy, but only with different view with this strategy

Orange market hit, I just had a few scalps for this up moves, so made some quick money today, just by following up this for you guys: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Let me get to the comments and reply

--- 帖子 #44 ---
That is very nice! Good job and good thinking!

--- 帖子 #45 ---
I agree with the short, but whatch out as you are a bit too close to the trend line. The uptrend is not flat enough for my eyes yet to say it will fall back, so you might want to close your trades at the trend line cross for safety.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Just wanted to add, Attached Image (click to enlarge) Since we hit the orange marker, it is now another good sign that we will make a new top, so I have just entered for a quick run. TP is previous top. Stop is likely that close orange marker.

I am dropping of for today, see you all tomorrow. For any ideas or pairs, situation to review, feel free to reach out here.

Seems like all happend as how we wanted: Attached Image (click to enlarge) we are looking for a touch on the counter trend at the bottom. let’s see how it unfolds.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Exactly as you predicted.. perfectly... .... here are my thoughts for this moment... I wonder how it will go.. very interesting

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Checking in from my PC: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I have marked the new counter trend, also added an alarm since I missed the morning trade. Maybe should have left there a pending order... Whatever. So I added an alam and once the trend line breaks it might give me a new chance to enter, but I would be more confy to enter short if the orange marker breaks but we still continue down without a new low. But, Since the orange marker is realy just a candle and not a real swing top, I assume we will make a trendline cross then a new low.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
EURUSD M15, just confirmed for you break, so that is a good short signal towards the main trend line at the bottom, The GBPUSD M5 also looks good to me. Keep it in mind that the goal is your blue trend line, pinks might be broken and can push up for a new top, for a new entry, but the main goal is to get to the blue line.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
EURUSD is going amazingly… How do you think ....does the crossing of this pink line confirms short entry now on GBPUSD?

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Trade goes according to the plan so far. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Waiting for further moves.

I would say so yes, and that is sort of a corelation between the EURUSD and GBPUSD

So now: Attached Image (click to enlarge) We will hit the orange marker, and possible continue short. The question is if we make a new low, or finaliye the counter trend up wards on the H1. Let's check back in like 30m

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Technically we are now aiming for the trend line above the price on the 5m chart. But I want to wait out what happens to that orange marker. if it gets broken, we might make a new low before getting to the down trend line, and my suspision tells me to wait it out. In any ways we are in a buy zone for now, but its a bit risky. So eyes on the chart.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
So we gót the TP with the down move, it triggered an up move to cross our downtrend line, which was crossed about an hour ago. Now it time to sell for a new low. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The H1 got so flat it almost acts like a free money trend line, so I don’t see much chances for higer break outs.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here is the H1 I will be traveling and I can check on the chart in 5 hours time. let’s see how it goes.

Thanks for sharing very useful knowledge...I am participating in the same game. .. ...still working like clockwork.. I scalped a little yesterday for sports interest...and today I did opposite entry again.. .

its simple, if something goes up it will have to come down and vica versa. read back the first post and anything starting after post 15.

Just a quick tip in case you didn't know, because I also have to work from my phone a lot of the day. If you scroll to the right where the indicators button is on mobile you can get a share chart button that creates a cleaner image of your chart. Quite nice for mobile which could be cluttered I find.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Thanks for the tip!!

--- 帖子 #67 ---
So the news pushed up the price a bit, can give you a new level of entry again towards the green line: Updated the chart a bit, since our trend line was crossed and we have a new @possible@ orange marker Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #68 ---
"a new @possible@ orange marker". Does this mean that it become real "orange marker" when price will do NEW LOW?:

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Lots of important news Tomorrow...trend lines may not hold... Another good day today..

--- 帖子 #70 ---
So we have smashed that green TP marker: Attached Image (click to enlarge) All is according to our plans, so next stop is to touch the trend line, as you can see, I made a clone of that line, which was put to the last known bottom, so the channels shows how far are we to the actual trend line, if we are below that line we are in the best buy zone to get to the uptrend line. Key thing to note is that we have just made a new low, so we are expecting some counter move but at this stage it will be likely that we might get some more depths. So let's check a higher time frame. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I have marked a good entry zone, let's see what waits for us tomorrow mowning

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Updated the channel, anywhere below the previous low, and under the channel, is a decent entry. Attached Image (click to enlarge) so far it is waiting for market Open.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
So right now, since we are right before some major news, its a bit risky to trade: But here are the level of questions that each time frame gives us: Attached Image (click to enlarge) 5m, we are too high in the channel to go for a buy, better chances to step in to a short when we break the down trend line. Stop around the orange marker. The H1 tells me in this quick draft, that the down trend has reached the orange marker of the previous up trend, which means it has fulfilled its destiny for sure, and it should retest the new down trend line. Attached Image (click to enlarge) As you see at this moment we are 635 points away from the trend line, with an ultimate low in it. So a rebound is really likely. On the daily however, we see a possible rebound from the MAJOR down trend so two possibilities: Attached Image (click to enlarge) 1: All time low comes and we wll see sub 1 EURUSD - the RED marker is a critical point 2: the price rebounds now! before crossing the red line, and we finally do a cross on the major trend line. If the RED is crossed, we can for get the EUR getting any stronger for the comign years!

--- 帖子 #73 ---
So what I wanted to add is simply, the best is always to decide what are your terms, like I am a day trader, so I should check the lowers time frames. Like we do on the 5m chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) So far the paper work does its job, so we will see soon. NEWS TIME!

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Likely we will go short on this if it goes above the trend line: Attached Image (click to enlarge) That little uptrend line won't hold much. That is our target.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Well, it did not make it to the trend line, no entry: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I have added an alert to that trend line. Maybe we get an entry later.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) I have marked the areas for possible by and short. I will think we are good for a bit of a correction, as for now this is the lower the price has ever been to the down trend line. we will see if it builds up anything plus.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Little update, Attached Image (click to enlarge) So the RED marker is hit, from here on it is pretty likely that that we will get some rebound, however it will likely to continue further down after. This is the daily chart, so we talk about weeks here.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Well, This is Panic now: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Bloody Friday

--- 帖子 #80 ---
So technically we had the chance to buy, and aim for the trendline cross. But I really really hate 1 swing breaks. Like that huge red column is just no good. Most of the times these get just filled back, but they break a structure so badly. Attached Image (click to enlarge) That uptrend line is pointing up so strong, it is likely to be broken, but these big red falls, usually bring a lower low, which after we can form a proper counter trend. We will see but I think we won't have much action here today. If any one has any other pairs to evaluate feel free to post or ask.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
I had question yesterday if you dont"t mind post 68 about correct mark some lines.. Ready, SET, Go! | Page 4 | Forex Factory

--- 帖子 #82 ---
All the entries looked ok, the trend lines are also fine, but the news pushed the price to be so over sold.. on a bigget time frame I would say we are in a buy zone. But technically it will ba next week.. or so...

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Not post 69 but question was in post 68 ...sorry

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Exactly right, that only validates if the trend makes a new low after that touch, as it can mkae multiple crosses over that trend line, but the orange marker is valid only if the new low as made.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Thank you

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Hi Tools, what do you think about GBP/USD?

--- 帖子 #87 ---
I agree with the comments shared here—it's quite challenging to follow your ideas. Despite reading through the posts several times, I still find it difficult to fully grasp the concepts due to how the ideas are presented. That being said, I really do appreciate your willingness to share your knowledge with the community. It’s clear that a lot of thought and effort goes into these posts. Thank you

--- 帖子 #88 ---
So seems like the morning GAP made the price get to the sell zone. From here we can expect a New low. Fingers crossed! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Morning..In that same boat..

--- 帖子 #90 ---
I am aiming for the trend line as a TP actually. I found that the price might actually do some side ways move and maybe we have a new counter forming as the GAP is a good indication for a counter activity. To be safe that is my TP. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #91 ---
If there is a little bit of difficulty in the system...The good thing is that the author shows everything in live trading. And I hope that all the ambiguities will be cleared up over time....thanks and keep going

--- 帖子 #92 ---
GM, like this thread , didn't you take this trade because of the weekend? made a nice 90 pips,

--- 帖子 #93 ---
I am happy you made some money! But the drawing is not good, you cannot miss any wicks or your trend liens can not cross at any portion of any candle. Try and redraw, I am happy to review

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Update, so the price pushed back, no GAP fill. I have updated the Possible re-entry zone and drawn a possible new counter marker. Attached Image (click to enlarge) It gets validated only if we get a higher push.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
You mean Friday tails on the TL? for me it's a response to the daily support, and another confirmation to the position, although I usually avoid over the weekend,

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Sorry I meant this. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Its abit exatuared, but the red line tries to mark that you should place your trend lines as is, on wicks covering all candles below.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
So now its even more likely that we make a new push, which is somewhat good news, as we might be getting a new entry for shorts. I have prepped the new trend line and the new orange marker in case we make a new low today, which I think we will but if the solid orange marker fails, that means we will have a longer counter trend and we might be doing some correction on the pair. We will see. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Yes, I understand some of your method, ( as there are many ways to mark TLs), that's why I asked about the bullish daily TL that seems to meet your conditions, it might hold for a while, thanks,

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Soon we might get an entry: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Checking the H1, actually it is accelerating so fast, it is likely that this trend line will break. Attached Image (click to enlarge) But, also these are the type which are likely to continue. I would say, let me rephrase my 5m chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I took out the entry sing, as I am sure that the flatter trend line will come out as valid soon. We are getting close to the orange marker. If that fails, we are starting a counter trend. Which is somewhat good news. But since the GAP is not filled, we need to catch the turn around of the counter trend for the next bear run.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
as jsut said: Attached Image (click to enlarge) It is now valid

--- 帖子 #102 ---
So we are still in the zone: This should be the best time to short, however, I am not convinced yet, we won't turn up higher. This is too flat to hold: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I think I will wait for some confirmations for now. We are also too close to our trend line to short. And too close to our orange marker for buyers. Any higher time frame shows a huge distance for bulls, but we need a confirmed counter on the higher time frames, maybe it will form from this. I think I pass for today. Had some good money in the morning, I am okay with that. Any other pairs you guys wanna check?

--- 帖子 #103 ---
I agree with you, Asia and London were strong against the dollar, and I don't intend to enter against it late in New York, certainly when I don't see enough criteria for it, even if a correction could come, I prefer to keep the profit and wait for tomorrow, like every day,

--- 帖子 #104 ---
I have updated the chart, if the uptrend truly starts this would be the best time to enter. Attached Image (click to enlarge) However, we need to break the up orange marker for a true uptrend, and break the lower orange marker to return to the low point. So now, we wait.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Little update: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Just cause I leave for today, I wanted to have a view on what I expect. I expect a new high, with a new trend line and a new marker. I think as long as that marker is steady, we won't really make further down moves. If in the morning I get a decided direction, I continue trading. Good luck everyone

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Just my thought guys... may we now will go to south.. ...

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Same thoughts, I am in! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #108 ---
So here is the deal: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I cleared off the chart and leave out the ideas and the suspected possibilities, and left only the facts. So, the Original trend still holds, the orange marker is the key level. The counter trend's orange marker has been crossed, so technically we are waiting for the new low. In theory there should be no further move up. However, if there will be one and we break that, that means, that the bull run is prepared and we will be striking back towards the H1 trend line. Now considering the fact that the price is so far away, it is pretty likely that it can actually happen. Today we got some red news too, so it can bring some unexpected movement. I believe a stop is good around the orange marker.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
I would like the first part of what you said better and I really want it ... but both are theoretically very possible.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
So quick update on the chart: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Seems like we have reached the orange marker. We might touch it in any minute. Let's see what this means. Well first, the Sell did stop out, and this will likely mean a trend change, possibly to the H1 Trend line, but we need to keep an eye on it. Once the orange marker is hit, we full fill the new high purpose and we will be aiming for the uptrend line again, that is where we will be looking for a new buy position. This is how the H1 looks like: Attached Image (click to enlarge) So we have a really fast up move, which is likely to get it's trend line crossed, then make further highs with a flatter trend. Maybe the news for today will push it there. In any case, we gotta be careful with red news. Something that does, and does not comfprt me is this: Attached Image (click to enlarge) The DXY shows, that the H1 chart has an uptrend, so low, that for weeks we are over priced like hell. Mostly because of the elections of course. Not to mention that the it shows that there was a counter trend, broken by the gap, and now we have a new low, this is the same patter showing that the DXY is now on a decending path. The only comfort it gives me, is that on the Daily: Attached Image (click to enlarge) You can see that the orange marker is at 113, and the only reason for a show stopper now is that we have just crossed the orange marker of the current uptrend, validating its pretty flat line. Now I believe, first we make the 113, then we fall back to the bottom line. But this is the daily chart, so we speak about weeks or months. Now I assume, we will have this up trend until Trump gets in his chair, and his first ammendments get to life. After that, the dollar might loose strenght as I don't think his TAXing laws will help much in the long run.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Hm... The marker hol up nicely, we are still in trend? Attached Image (click to enlarge) News will decide.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) So the Orange marker held the price, we had a huge move up and down, and yet we are waiting to get a clear picture. As of now the down trend would be the expected answer, so making a new low. As you can see the counter trend is broken too. However, now this could be the actual turning point where it breaks our orange marker on top. I think the best now is to wait out, we are not in a good buy position, nor in a good sell zone.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Finally something has happened: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Marker breached, going for the bears now. However first we need to test back our new uptrend line. So short term, short, long term up!

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Entry signal is coming up,

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Maybe the opening of London will create an entry..

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Just got an alarm triggered. Let's see how far we gonna get back to the main trend on top in the distance.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Thought it might be better to explain what I am looking at as for entry: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Shoulf the solid white line break, preferably below our uptrend, and before reaching the uptrend's orange marker. Than the TP is a new high. I think it is a bit clearer this way.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Yes, we really need it in this case.. thanks. Despite the fact that the risk is high, I already entered with a larger stop.. although today is a USD Bank Holiday and the price may go sideways, we'll see how it goes..

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Well technically, the odds are still on your end. I normally see futher crosses below the trend lines, but there are cases where only a wick touches it. So we will see. If it goes a bit lower I will feel more safe to enter, or when the trend line crosses.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
There is the signal: White line crossed, marker crossed. Let's go. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #128 ---
No volume, hence the slow day. H1 shows that its counter has been breached and we should be in a good place for BUY positions. Attached Image (click to enlarge) If you take a look at that all green coloumn that lead up there., that means we are in a sideways move now, and it is pretty likely we will breach upwards. So 3 small trades are still lit. Tp 1.05888

--- 帖子 #129 ---
This morning was good with two buys of 20P, at noon GU pulled up and EU down and the dollar in the middle, as a result the market was unstable and the TLs were not respected, I hold this buys on EU GU with BE, and that's it for today, New York is pretty much on holiday anyway,

Please explain what do you mean on not respected TLs?

I believe the morning will be interesting to see how it unfolded: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Goals achieved before London opens, great.. Interesting week was

--- 帖子 #137 ---
So good news and bad news: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Good news, we got what we wanted, but the Channel of this move is so high up, right now its not too good to short as the trend line is really close. I will wait for a retest of the trend lien and test for a new High.

--- 帖子 #138 ---
That's what I was thinking about too. The weekend is starting for me now.. I think there probably won't be any trades until Monday London open..

--- 帖子 #139 ---
GM, yesterday was low volume, I made scalps, TLs and then within the created 20P range, in both directions,

--- 帖子 #140 ---
So, it was a quick return, making it too steep: Attached Image (click to enlarge) No I have to track this movement and see if any marker get's formed and broken before moving any higher.

So little update, I could not get here any earlier so I have a lot to cover. Let's deep dive. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I have marked with a strong green colour the original uptrend, that I thought we have broken, and which will continue as our down trend, failed bz breaking its orange marker on friday afternoon. Now this morning we have started with a strong GAP and counter move. Which actually shows me this: H1 shows the greter picture. Currently we have "no way" to go, No markers down: Attached Image (click to enlarge) This can mean two things: - Total new low and master trend continueation - Or eventually further move up. Let's see which is more likely. D1 shows, we are currently in a down trend, which I would say is the master trend for us: Attached Image (click to enlarge) DXY shows: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Kinda similioar behaviour, as we have just been doing a new top for our uptrend. But as you can see, the DXY made a really flat up trend line, that has just made its new top. Which means, from here our aim will be to get back to that blue line. The DXY's down trend orange marker is so high up, I don't see a reason for that to be reached before clearing up that flat blue. Sooooo what I expect is this: Attached Image (click to enlarge) We will continue down for some time, but without making a new low, I expect a turn around and that we will keep targeting our major trend line for a new touch. As the Weekly shows, we have not yet touched the main trend line, and that needs to happen. Attached Image (click to enlarge) After touching that, I assume it will keep going further low.. But we are talking months or years here. Any ways, for what we are more interested in is the m5 chart. There We need to have a touch on the trendline to go further low. So once we get a touch point, we will have a good aim where to target our entries. Today's break out also confirms a turn around point so let's stay with the bears today. I will post if I see a good entry point.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
My lines are a little different from yours, but I don't think the point changes.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
I agree with your drawing - Let's see if today we get any luck

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Nice thorough analysis Tools. Thank you! Do you think Trump with his new ideas will affect DXY in any way? I´m a bit concerned about said man..

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Update on the chart: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I think today the EURUSD will work on getting back to the top section to test the trend line. I have just marked. A possible entry. Yesterday there was no target to hit on the EURUSD, but let me show you what else gave me a good opportunity. The GBPUSD formed a really flat free money line, Attached Image (click to enlarge) I have realized it around the time I marked and I entered. I should maybe keep an eye on more pairs live... Anyways while I was doing some back testing I have jsut realized this one and quickly entered. I got some nice profit from it. So What I decided to do is I will refresh my charts this morning as follows: 1m 5m 1h and I will try to look for patterns on: AUDUSD, GBPUSD, EURUSD - So all together 9 charts. I will also try to make some colouring differences so you can quickly follow what I am posting about. AUDUSD - RED Backdrop GBPUSD - BLACK Backdrop EURUSD - BLUE Backdrop I will get them prepared and will share the current stats soon.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
So let's see what we got. I scrolled back the M1 chart on the EURUSD as I could so I get a full picture while doing a backtest. And I found some crazy opportunities. Attached Image (click to enlarge) So on this picture you can see two free money lines. As the first trend is so flat... it is just too EZ to make money on. The Other one is exactlz on the same pip, making it totall flat. Which means at any given time you buy below that you will get a profit. On these occasions the best you can do is to enter at every new low. Here is a 2nd Picture where I zoomed out to show what I mean. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Once we got above the free money line, that trend has officially ended. So the Uptrend fulfilled its destiny. Right after we should expect a return to our trend line, which happened soon after, leaving another free money line behind. Attached Image (click to enlarge) So the plan is the same, trade every new low. Attached Image (click to enlarge) If you were to make it more safe, you could have waited for the turning point, and if you wanted to be more extreme and risky, you could have traded the counter trend brakes for a new low. I tried to mark all possibilities. Later on by addign a channel, using the bottom trend line, we can get a chance how far our price will go, and that gives us the best opportinities with the best ratio for a good return. Attached Image (click to enlarge) As you can see the entry point was pretty good, even tho it did not reach the uptrend. When the counter fails to reach the uptrend, that means we should expect a new top, as the trend continues to hold. Attached Image (click to enlarge) In our case it happened, and gave us a bit higher point to go for shorts. Now at this point of time our uptrend's orange marker is down at 1.04581 - Which means, we either get a huge fall, or the trend line get's crossed, making a new higher orange marker, and eventually making a new top. Here in our case we have not reached it just yet. So my expectation is that the EURUSD will continue down, and hit the orange marker. Attached Image (click to enlarge) So my money is on further down moves. I will look for good entries. (sorry for the long post) Also I could have went through the full m1 chart in more detail, but I hope you get the idea what key moments I am after.

I have update the 5m chart, looking for a short entry at trend line cross: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #158 ---
H1 shows, that if we make this new low, we will have good chances to witness some correction. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #159 ---
I tried to show another Free money line. This one is on the GBPUSD, making 3 candles tick being at the exact same level at the same peak. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I tried to re-colour the entry markers so you can see with white the zones to enter, and the ratios, what risks you had at hand. I hope its not too crowded. Also Right after fullfillment, we had good chances to return to our uptrend line. I might actually switch over to 1m charts, these give such a good view sometime...

--- 帖子 #160 ---
At the end of the chart, right now this is what we have: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Pretty flat line, and we are getting close to an orange marker. So possibly above that we will be good to go short for the trend line.

EURUSD looks Good: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #175 ---
So because we have had no trend line touch on the EURUSD, and the GBP USD is closing to the uptrend line, I decided to move my TP to the trend line. Once it touches it I close the trade, and wait out, as we might get a push back up, towards the trend down trend line. Attached Image (click to enlarge) It was a good trade tho, GBPUSD gave me 2 awsome entries just today. 50+30points, I think that is decent. Hope you guys could catch something.

EURUSD closed +1

Nice job!

--- 帖子 #179 ---
Same on EURUSD, Attached Image (click to enlarge) I assume we will have a downtrend line touch soon.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Seems like it was the right call. I drop for today, tomorrow we might get a new entry.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Morning, traders Sell from Down trendline zone. TP near previous Low.. Maybe London will agree..

--- 帖子 #182 ---
GM, EU done, still holding GU with bullish TL break H&amp;S, final TP previous Low/TL or weekly P,

--- 帖子 #183 ---
So I am a bit late this morning to post, but already had a realy nice short on both GBP and EURUSD Attached Image (click to enlarge) So from yesterday where we have left off. We had nice bounces back and forth between our trend lines each giving us plenty of space to trade. The last one finally got our trendline touch, which will bring the price down to the previous low and ultimately to 1.0458 This trade is already in BE and stop is in good place so nothing to loose. The GBPUSD was a bit harder to read, and the corelation factor gave me the breavery to enter when it made a newer high to go short. TP is the trend line. Attached Image (click to enlarge) But since the EURUSD has lot more to move I suspect we will get to the orange marker. While writing this post it actually got there: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Closed 40+ pips on GBPUSD in total this morning on GBPUSD, TP was hit. EURUSD is still in play, I will update you guys further on that. I have something for you guys I will share out soon, just gotta do some work as that is prio, and we will see what you will think. I might ask for your help in some ways. I will be back shortly with some interesting stuff.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Please share this from your chart, I mean from the chart you make the trades on, not necesserly trading view. m1 EURUSD Attached Image (click to enlarge) Try to grab the same time and draw the same trend line, I wonder if this is the same for every one.

Attached Image (click to enlarge) This any is getting close to TP. After that good chances for a nice bull run.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
What is that Orange line?

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Awsome question: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Our original uptrend-s point 2 level, but they trends legs are so close I suspect both to be hit. Hence the orange marker.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
So interesting events. We had a new interim low to confirm technical aspects, but that original orange marker has not been reached. Which means further shorts might happen. Updated the chart: New low target marked: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Final post today: Attached Image (click to enlarge) closed most of my trade, tp at trend line cross. Stop is already in plus. So far 2.6% percent profit for december. Let’s hope I can keep up doing this. Tomorrow I will share some interesting pieces.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Did some trades on eurusd and gbpusd yesterday. Overall view good. Decided take partial profit on the way.. Trendlines are working so far good.. The most important is correct mark them..

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Really nice Any profit is good profit

--- 帖子 #197 ---
GM, my screenshots, there can be changes, also depending on the broker, And I have a question about this ultimate TL you use, if you take it from the wicks, on the M1 chart you will get a different TL than on the H1 chart, do you mark both? (that's what I do)

--- 帖子 #198 ---
I rely on the more precise time frame, but I keep an eye on both. Thanks for sharing the time frame!

New Short signal: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Cleared up the GBPUSD chart a bit, current state is: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Possible orange marker attack is coming in, after that we might get some bull run again.

This died out quickly, bulls taking over today I assume: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Short signal again. The pair looks about to get movement. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Stopped out

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Sorry buddy, me too got stopped out. Luckily with this sytems the stops are easy to set and relativly small, 8USD not much of a loss, compared to the roughly 80 that was planned. Anyways, I have something to share, so I feel there is something big coming up with the Dollar. I have multiple reasons to belive that on the long run (coming weeks) The USD will crack a bit, well like roughly 6% Attached Image (click to enlarge) DXY shows, that we have made a new high, so next step is to touch the blue line again. Which is really far. This confirms something I see on my currency as well. Not a single retrace since september... Attached Image (click to enlarge) Same on the EURUSD: We are down in a channel and we have not touched the main trend line for quite a while. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #208 ---
It's time to be careful, typical for a New York red news day, I took this sell, again, low risk,

--- 帖子 #209 ---
All is well, not one year in this game . Thanks...

--- 帖子 #210 ---
I think I will set a pending order for both short and long, still we have an unfinished uptrend line, so I assume we short today. But news can screw things up quickly.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
TP1 + BE stop,

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Adjusted the chart, Attached Image (click to enlarge) Seems like we have an unfilled GAP... Maybe it happenes before the daz ends.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Red News, so its likely it gets filled...

--- 帖子 #214 ---
I have a feeling that the market prepares for Trumps arrival... Who knows, right now I think I am off for today, I see no real targets as of now. We need the market to show some new moves. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #215 ---
I got the news before...trying to cover yesterday's losses

, I took the same EU GU, closed at 20/25P because there is strong resistance and want to see how it develops/test the TL/S,

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Both winners.. ... Good weekend for everyone!

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Good job guys! Some late update from me: I have now a pending short in the retrace zone Attached Image (click to enlarge) It will be a HUUUGE way down.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Triggered short: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #220 ---
hi tools what is the target you are expecting to the downside

--- 帖子 #221 ---
check the post 218. The orange marker at minimum! But be aware we might make further bullish highs.

--- 帖子 #222 ---
So yesterday was a good day, I had quite a move that I caught. The trade was at the previous high,a pending order, I had no chance being there in real time, otherwise I might have added some extra entries as it pushed higher. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I closed the trade as It crossed a trend line and we were closing as it wsa friday. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I will be at the chart at marker open and see if I can catch any new entries. Possible Entries are in the green zone: Target is the purple trend line at the bottom. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Great Trade, Tool! Interesting, Why you decided to short from this zone (reason?)?

--- 帖子 #224 ---
, This was indeed a great call, in my opinion and from what I see there are several factors, According to Tools method it is point 2 of the hourly TL, (which could indicate a change in trend in the coming days) You can add to this resistance area, 106 as a very strong price, above the previous week's high, a fib structure, and especially an area with very high liquidity, I wonder where the stop was, since it is in red news, the DD was about 30 pips, I believe it was possible to wait for the move down and then enter, We will wait for Tools' answer,

--- 帖子 #225 ---
that orange marker was the previous top of the purple trend. Going above it was a must before it can break. Hence I think we will go south bound.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
to be fair, since we were talking here about 132points, a 2:1 ratio Still gives us more then 40 points to for stop, but I had no intention to stop it out as this is zone is so much in the Sell zone for me, I would step in again and again, if it had continued to go up.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Early morning entry with the TL breakout, same in EU, 40+25P, I'll see if I enter again today,

--- 帖子 #228 ---
Nice catch, I am away all day, so I can only review the chart late afternoon.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
So this chart shows a lot of ups and downs but no real movement. For these, the best is to check it from "higher" Attached Image (click to enlarge) So the H1 shows a likely newer high to come up. But we have that unfilled purple trend line on the M1 chart you guys asked about. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here is my opinion. I believe that will be filled, but we might get further pushes higher. Which is some what good, as the natural correction fulfills, and we will have a "target". Right now the best we can do is to keep an eye on the 1m and 5m chart and trade what we see live., any newer highs are good entries for shorts, track the shorts with a trend line and any break can be traded for a newer high. This can go on as long as the shorts trends does not take over finally.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
A little updated 1m chart for tracking. I am not gonna take trades today, I have so much on my plate for now. Tomorrow I will have more time infront of the chart and will keep you guys posted. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #231 ---
So the Sell Zone worked out as expected. Since that we had not much to witness. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Currently we are in an up movement, waiting for a newer high around 1.0595, or possibly even higher. 1.063. I will monitor what's happening today.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Morning traders With all due respect, Tools, but it seems to me that the situation is changing and now I've sell orders... I could be wrong, but that's how I see it now. Just for learning....Sell from London open..

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Gleam, you are on spot, the correction could not make a new low, hence our TP is around the purple line: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I should have left an alert in. Anyways, good catch!

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Stop in plus, let's see: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Nice momentum, I took TP2, I'll see what develops in this zone,

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Not much has happened, if we step out of the trend line its a good sell signal. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Still hold last position if I have enough patience

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Getting there slowly. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #239 ---
I think till Red News such a situation will continue.. ..after to North or South

--- 帖子 #240 ---
So the news made the Price to touch the trend line and my alert gave a nice entry, target is Still the purple line Attached Image (click to enlarge) I think we will get there tonight. But I expect a turn around after that and stronger moves north.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
The DXY crossed the orange marker, so technically the next think to so is to break the uptrend. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I expect some real correction Target is the blue line Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #242 ---
So, after adjusting our trend line, I am expecting a new cross, then finally getting to our target, so new entry is available soon

--- 帖子 #243 ---
New cross, new entry, target unchanged: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Stop is the Orange marker.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Nice sell, , Its a strong resistance zone, according to your method, did you mark this zone because price touched the TL and made a new low?

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Precisely! Here is an update: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Getting some resistance, but my first TP is at the previous low, I will do a BE and leave the rest for the purple line.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
I'm not so sure about the strength of the dollar right now, it could go either way or continue consolidating,

--- 帖子 #247 ---
To me the Dollar still has to make a new low: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Two things can play out, we break the orange marker first, than downfall to the blue. Or better for the dollar is if we make a new low first, then we can move the orange marker lower, which will be our new target, which can end the down trend and we will see from there. Either way, this is months to find out.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Good trade: Stop is nice, TP is close: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I did BE

--- 帖子 #249 ---
So about the news: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Just got my TP with the spread: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I also assume we will hit the Purple line now.

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Before I forget, the purple line has a Origin of 1.0457 - That will be breached before the uptrend comes in play.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Same guys, already got profits

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Really nice!

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Last update for today, The pair was really kind to us giving a new possibilty for late people to enter for the purple target, which was hit as promised. Now the trend origin has not yet been reached so a bit more down to go and we can conclude this formation

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Had time for a checkin, so far so good! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #255 ---
As promised, price is at where we wanted:

Getting there Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #259 ---
I am happy to have some people with similiar opinion on this, thanks for contributing by showing your charts too. Feel free to add other pairs you might trade. What I like in this system is that we can get clear target levels and good stop areas. Here the Reward ratio was just too good again. 9.4 XD

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Now its time to clear up old crap from the chart, so let's see what is actual. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The uptrend line is really flat, so I expect a nice turn around once the down trend line is crossed.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Your R:R superb, precision entries, great

--- 帖子 #262 ---
, Yesterday I closed at 4720 and avoided the news, you found a good target, higher low of the beginning of the trend, and currently EU inside the channel, it was a good buy with the new M1 TL cross , closed 75%, , maybe will sell again, GU morning H4 TL cross, seems there are more targets below,

--- 帖子 #263 ---
TrendLine Reached, new entry short:

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Okay, so it flew off.. Interesting... I might step in again. Stop is not that far actually: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #265 ---
What I meant on intersting is, that I see no reason for this quick rush. Possible people are lookign for trend line breaks and it might have triggered some high money traders. We will see, if it stops out thats fine, we will see some new targets, but I have a good feeling that flat line won't hold much, I might actually move my stop higher than the orange marker, as I think at some point in the futuer I might just get below my entry anyways. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Started a fresh chart, so I can have only the recent lines on. Fingers crossed!

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Two trades in, already in plus, fingers crossed for prefered out come

Entries are doing okay: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

On the same way...good week.. good job..

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Another monday morning, and for me another short: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Price got pushed up but the flat trend line did not get touched, we are so far away from it its just too good to miss with a pretty short stop. Let's see how our week goes. Good trades for all!

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Morning Yea, agree, Monday blushes from Eur and GBP, USD News. And can everything continue go to south...

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Bit of an andjustment to the trendline: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Seems like the price rejected that area 4 times. I hope it goes south, I would be pretty happy about it. Technically if it truly goes down this week, for me it means that the h1 will make a new low longterm, DXY will rise to touch the orange marker of the down trend. And then the Dollar will have to fall back intensivly. Mabye Trumps first few days will push the USD even higher, but on the long run, I am not too confident about the dollar.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
GM, where is the upper TL from? from what I see, EU came out of the channel and into resistance and below the KL, looks like on its way down again,

--- 帖子 #274 ---
its only visible for now on the 5m chart for me, but that is the origin. I tempt to believe that we will make a new low in this trend.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Hi Guys, what do you guys think about FX options expiring today? Eur 3.4bn @ 1.0500 (i assume most of these are put options) Eur 1.1bn @ 1.0530 (i assume most of these are Call options) Eur 2.3bn @ 1.055 (i assume most of these are Call options) so my theory is that the price will bounce inbetween 1.05000 and 1.05300 so as they do not trigger the strike price

--- 帖子 #276 ---
NEWS time, Let's see if these hold: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Remember, even if the orange marker breaks, we will need to retest the flat uptrend line, which means that my entry is still kinda safe. But it will mean once we get back to the trend line we can aim for a new high, but so far it holds. Also, technically it just made a new high in this counter move.. So its still a good place for a turn around. Fingers crossed!

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Trendline adjusted, waiting for 10am news, also 5th attempt to brake the price range. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Seems like EU related news could not make much more than noise... I wonder if we make a new low before the US news comes out: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Please Post charts on what was your entry using this system, it benefits the others. In the mean time I set up a SL in plus, I don't expect newer highes before TP

Sure, buy closed, sell TP1 done, *I use your method in my own way, and enjoy discovering new ideas, since the approach is pretty similar most of the time,

--- 帖子 #283 ---
About half way there: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #284 ---
I don't agree with your drawing: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Its a bit different if you follow through, currently this is how I see it. Based on this we need to break, cross the uptrend line.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
same here good luck to you!

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Careful with that Buy Limit, I expect a new low which is below 1.46! you might get burned there!

--- 帖子 #287 ---
this is just my TP my app shows like this ( forex.com ) as I also think that this pair will continue lower to your tp i just want to exit at 1.0480 to have my first successful trade this week booked

--- 帖子 #288 ---
I understand you, thanks, I update the TLs if new H/L are made, in any case it is the same resistance zone, this morning buy is from the previous TL, and not the updated one created from the new H,

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Understood

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Looks like we won't go south at least till US news

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Agree, Attached Image (click to enlarge) In any case, if it goes higher, I will still be looking for shorts, as that trend line should be defeated. As mentioned, if it breaks the orange marker, it eventually stiil need to make a low to the trend line, the only difference it will make is that we know that once that is done, we will have other targets to reach.

I have partially closed my trades, leaving 10% of them still running for one reason: Attached Image (click to enlarge) New low was made, and now technicalities say, it needs to touch the trend line, again, then it can make a new low, so I wait for that to happen then I re-enter with a full position. This way I could bank some profits.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Orange marker crossed, now suppose to be bullish, Attached Image (click to enlarge) my vall for today is the touch of the bottom trend line, then, maybe a bounce back to the new high, we will see. So what changed since yesterday is that we don’t target a new low at the 1.046 ish area, but our target is the trend line.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Going long 1.0501 SL open (will close manually when demanding on PA) TP 1.0512 Happy trading all

--- 帖子 #304 ---
So the h1 shows this: Attached Image (click to enlarge) We have a clear turn around, we have had first an uptrend, that ended, and we had a new move down for a new low, that did not happen eventually as we have just crossed our otange marker, now the price retracted, but that means we will cross the trend line on the m1 chart and than go for new hights. It is also posible that we won't reach that trend line just now and make further new highs as the news can kick things off. Best thing we can do is to monitor this trend change closely. But right now the trend line is still our main target: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Yours differs as its m5 mine is m1. And as you can see we are continue to get down.

Entered long: Attached Image (click to enlarge) reason is, the down trend’s orange marker was crossed but we got no new high since, we have now good chances to do a new high at 1.0535 ish area, which after we might get back to this level again. Fingers crossed, this will be a longer trade.

me too, i went long after the initial drop. now waiting for the price to come back up.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
I did closed my trades 90% befelé the news too, had the rest to on, so eventually I ended up in zero. Basically, the news did push all in one motion what I expedted in a longer run. I thought we test with a new high then we fall back to our orange marker, well now the news pushed us way below. closing gap on DXY as well as making a new high on the index. techically now it seems the dollar will reach to 114 on the index making the EUR USD fall even further. I will post charts later. Good luck for the day!

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Yea, There will be a slight correction and I think the news will push it to a new low today.

Hello everyone! Let's start the New Year with new opportunities! Started out the same way you did..or at least similar.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Happy Monday So far the direction favours us.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
I assume, this will be a good TP again at the trend line soon:

--- 帖子 #349 ---
I closed earlier.. All three profits have reached..

--- 帖子 #350 ---
TP1 reached, TP2 in reach: Attached Image (click to enlarge) If the orange is broken we can forget the bears for some time I assume:

--- 帖子 #351 ---
I see the pair weakening... tariff threats!

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Seems like with these news the best option was to end the long after it broke down the trend line again, and possibly we are aiming for the bottom orange marker. We will see if it can make a new low and adjust our trend lines.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Hi there! How it is going?! Went short yesterday and already made two profits out of three. Waiting for the third one too . I think the NEWS will push the pair down. Green pips for all!!

--- 帖子 #354 ---
nice catch there!!

--- 帖子 #355 ---
First target reached, now we need a new low to fulfill the trend.

Everything is in motion: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #364 ---
hi tools, how did you determine your targets in this screen shot for the suggested buys? thx

--- 帖子 #365 ---
first target is target is the trend line itself, decens is the orange marker, which is the second leg of the trend line. best is always to aim for the first target, close the magority of the trade, and risk the rest for the 2nd target. Also, an update, as you can see the new high will be already far above the trend line, so I expect the orange marker to break this time. Fingers crossed

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Thanks Mr. President for the first target reach: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Aming for the second.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
I would say, this is a 99% TP on the Orange marker, after that in the gray area we can aim for a new test on the up trend line, however it can be more intense and we can get higher. I will keep updating the chart: Attached Image (click to enlarge) This was a nice 230+ Pips move Previous one was a 150+ pips roughly 180+ before. So 560+ just on this pair using this system is not too bad I think. GL HF

--- 帖子 #368 ---
TP2 hit! Attached Image (click to enlarge) let’s see how far we go before we retest the uptrend line

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Pretty much paper form: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Soon, new touch coming up.

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Well done Tools, I need some criteria to go against such a HTF trend, so I made some scalps on the way up from KLs, I understand you entered based on the channel? I also see daily support there,

--- 帖子 #371 ---
looks like a double top, so I expect the touch to happening today, in any case if it goes higher it gives us new entries.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
New Entry: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Target is the uptrend line

--- 帖子 #373 ---
So far so good, maybe more to come tomorrow: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Chart updated, good formation on us!

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Morning! Euro News in 2-3 hr!! South or North !!!

--- 帖子 #376 ---
The higher it goes the newer entries we can have. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Any touch of the RED triangle is a TP.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
4 times in, Attached Image (click to enlarge) The orange marker is now acts as a show of the first entries level

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Chances are high for a 5th one actually the way I see it, which would be nice.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Hi Tools, When would you ever take a loss? It looks like your stop was really close in a previous image. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #381 ---
So Here is the deal, StopLoss is kinda hard to explain, as it is usually the 2nd Leg of the actual trend, when I am following it, but then it can be pretty far down the road, so I try to stick to something closer, however when I am counter trend trading like now, I try to have minimal entries, but more. Like here, I have a pending for the 5th: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Eventually the further I am away from the trend line is the better chances I have for profit, so I always try to enter when we make a newer high. Small lots, really small ones. As its counter trading. Once it gets below our current uptrend, I can be more "agressive" as if things look good I will be aiming for a new high, which I already know where it is, and can bring me better profifts and there I can have a better, more visible stop. Also, if you want to be safe, you can mark these new highs as good entries points and leave out the trade, and just examine how good it could have been if you have entered on these new highs. However, here, we have not had any actual down trend formed, with lower lows sooo, we are about to get one I assume, which might take us to touch the trend line

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Yesterday I could have another entry, hopefully today I get my touch Technically I Still have two days to close all trades in plus.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
A fresh screen from my PC. So the TP level is when we enter the red triangle.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Good strategy tools! Respect! I use similar it myself with very minimal lots. Of course there is some risk. Need to calculate that there are enough funds in the account in case the price goes up for a long time.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
I decided to close my trades as I won't have time to monitor from here onwards: 348,7 Pips just on these 6 entries. Possibly could have been 450, but still fine. I will wait for some better entries in the red zone, but possibly only in the afternoon. I wanted to make sure I close all trades in plus.

3rd entry triggered:

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Hey Tools, thanks for your thread. What's the trigger for your entries, the blue arrows, once TL is broken? Also how do you use the counter TLs, the blue lines for your trades?

--- 帖子 #393 ---
omg i feel sorry for your trades this gap had to harm your account

--- 帖子 #394 ---
shit happens, actually the interesting part of the gap is that it opened just below the orange marker you see in post 389. it was a trend breaker. Anyways now its up again towards tue downtrendline. I will post a cleared chart later.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
So the cleaner chart: As you see the GAP opened below the orange marker, making that uptrend finished. Now our target is the blue trendline. Technically its my fault, as I have not realized this: The orange trend lien shows the original counter trend. Attached Image (click to enlarge) It has been broken, yet the price made a new low, which is the clear indication of a trend reversal, so I should have actually expected this to happen. Well I guess this happens when I don't pay enough attention to my chart. So right now we need to look at the bigger picture. The new down trend line is really strong, It is likely it will get touched and forms a new low. So that is our first goal. However let's check the daily what is the long term prognosis. The daily shows, that we have not tested back the original down trend line for long time, Attached Image (click to enlarge) Also the price has made a new low since the last sub trend started, and have not tested back that trend line either. I have also drawn now a suspected uptrend line, which we will see if it holds, if so that is likely to push the price higher. Of course we stick to lower time frames, but so far for me, those targets are to be reached, on the long run.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Closing soon: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Some of the previous losses are back. I am also lookign for co-relating pairs and for me it shows that this will likely make a new high, I hope I am right But to be sure, after the loss on Monday, this trade gets closed at trend line touch. Also I wanted to highlight that the uptrend line is really flat, so I won't expect much hold there. So we are likely to fall back to that level, after we cross the blue down trend line.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Soon: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

TP Hit: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Looking for the orange marker to break, fingers crossed.

Me too. Same thinking, same actions.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
thanks for the sharing. I like your trading system, in my point of view the basic of this trading system is discipline. discipline is the most important thing in forex trading - a newbie perspective -

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Little update before the weekend comes. So far so good meet you guys next week

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Chart updated: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Slow movement is expected for todaz as we lack news, but Wednesday can bring some suprises.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Hi, there! It's going slowly week.... maybe the next RED News will push it in the right direction ... ..will see..

--- 帖子 #406 ---
Little update: Attached Image (click to enlarge) So far, side ways, if it gets into the gray zone, I mgiht enter again.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Readjusted, but no new entry. It did not go high enough: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Since we have bounced off, I had to remove the strong white down trend line as it seems that is not going to be the new trend line since we have not made a newer low: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Had a new entry for two reasons: First, If the trend holds, its a better entry and I will have two good trades with decent reward ratio. Secondly, even if the orange marker of the blue trend line fails. I am "high" enough to profit from the uptrend's retrace. As if this ends up being an uptrend, that white trendline still needs to be touched. Figners crossed

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Patience will pay off....

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Is this a good setup?(Just got on this thread yesterday)

--- 帖子 #411 ---
I would say so,first target is always the trend line, the rest is gratis.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
So, this is how its going for now. 4 active trades just in this trend.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Looking nice! Keep posting

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Well this is how it played out, just wonderful.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
This is what I'm hoping for the next trades

--- 帖子 #416 ---
very nice! Keep posting Also make sure you check other time frames too!

--- 帖子 #417 ---
keep in mind, higher time frames are for indication or for targets. Trading them is pretty risky as you can end up with trades open for weeks or months.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Little Update: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Slowly we are getting to our turn

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Chart update: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I realized I never updated the tradingview markers for the entries properly... Anyways, price is slowly getting towards the trend line.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
So, the recent pullback indicates a newer high, before going down so above 1.05050 is a good place for a newer entry. I will do a proper chart later.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Slowly moving to the correct direction, however, we have not made a new top yet. Attached Image (click to enlarge) So this possibly means target the orange marker at 1.022

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Thanks for updating!

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Hi, traders!! Price reached up trend line according TV, but MT4 not yet, some differences with trend line...it continued almost for one month.... I am up now ..will see

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Well Placed order! I am going in for a new entry at 1.0535 to short, target is a possible new low. Fingers crossed. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Took profit with long... and shorted already too ...it may needed to wait for price break highs ... If price will go higher I will add positions.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
The last trades I took this week (still going)

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Same here, even tho it sky rocketed, it just confirmed the up trend line at the bottom, which means it needs to be touched the lest, bot most probably crossed towards the orange marker. My reason to think about this is simple: the daily chart shows that we had a break before makign a touch to the trendline, so I have high hopes that the major down trend continues. Attached Image (click to enlarge) To be fair, Trumps comments on X make bigger impact nowadays than the news themselfs, aaaand any good news about the EU is over priced. I have no means to agree or disagree with what Trump is doing, but thinking about the dollar as still the words most valued asset, I maging how good could that be for investors now to buy the dollar at this price, and since Trump is a businessman, I think all this is nost just a show up... its a money game... the DXY Attached Image (click to enlarge) It shows that the down trend has been crossed, but the orange marker has not been reached. And as you see there were multiple attempts to push the dollar down, yet we had no lower low, and eventually had a higher high formation. I think this is a necessary correction. And the Aim is still the 113 and long run, newer high. Same reasoning for this is simple, they print money.... Look at the SP500, it will always make newer highs... same as the dollar. The worth of that dollar well that will be different, but on the chart we will see it rise. To me, the real important news will be truly the ones for the EU, as the EU might struggle from the trade wars and will heavily impact GDPs of the countries as well as inflation. The tarrifs just go live, any measureable impact will come in the following months. So we will see. Now Trump is the Putin puppet and all that is around the internet, but we will see how his policies will affect the world. Careful trading to all

--- 帖子 #239 ---
This is a great plan, and I'm of the same mind. This needs to be reposted over at EURUSD only

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Well this is how gold played out massive W.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
This is the last setup I'm trying out for this month probably.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
I am expecting a similiar step for the EURUSD, but there is still some to go up before I can go for a certain short. Good luck!
