Your Chance to help prove a system! What you get: Download my free EA. No subscription, no limitations, works on demo and live accounts. What I ask for: Please create and link to a trade explorer running this EA on XAUUSD on any demo account and trial run for a minimum of 2 months, preferably much longer. Please post a response with a link to your explorer and make it completely public, including lot size and profit. It would be helpful if you use the option to have the returns show in your signature, too. I need to prove this works for many people profitably over a long period of time. WARNING: Please do not run on a live account, until you can see yourself it works in demo over a good period of time. If you go live, it needs minimum $1000 balance to trade 0.01 lot size. More details below. Now for geeky stuff... :nerd: This EA makes steady, smaller profits, more and faster when the market trends, slower and less when it ranges. It takes some time, please don't run it for a week and quit, your short-changing yourself. I made 50% in a month, but my expectation was 6-7% a week. I had it not close trades for 2 weeks, then close 30 trades in 2 days with FOMC, and over 10% profit. So, be patient. I've learned from real life trading slow and steady wins the race. I've manually traded up 700% in 3 weeks, but the math just doesn't work out for that to last long. My broker offers 1:300 leverage, so 0.01 XAUUSD takes about $4.25 margin to open. What this means mathematically is your account's leftover free margin determines the profit potential, drawdown tolerance, and account survivability. This EA will automatically increase the lot size as the account grows. To witness this, I recommend using demo account with large size, at least $50,000. The EA will use 0.01 lot size per $1000 in account balance. This is healthy, as the EA max possible drawdown is around 30%. It is physically impossible for it to exceed this limit, BTW, on one cycle. I've never seen it go past 15%. Settings: leave them as is, do not modify any settings , just have the EA set to live trade, and check the import DLLs box before starting EA. If you must have it trading right away, modify the start time to a few minutes in the future, and the stop time 1 minute before that. If you need help installing, finding the EA in your file folders, or starting up the EA, please use search or Goo-gle. I won't be able to help you on that. This is a completely automated EA, it is also completely hands off, set and forget. Any intervention will throw it off, so if your that type, please open two demo accounts, and link the trade explorer to the one you'll leave alone, please. We all can benefit greatly from this, but we depend on your help to show honest record of the EA's progress. NOTE: If your broker has very low spread, $0.10, for gold, you may need to use value 30 for gridlevel. If you get a 130 error message, your broker has a minimum pip distance from price for pending orders to be place. You can change buffer setting to a value of 10 above what your broker's minimum pip distance is. If you don't know, e-mail your broker. If you close your plateform, or if your VPS acts up and you have to restart MT4, the EA will NOT have kept track of floating equity to hit profit target. You will have to close trades, and start over, otherwise the EA will use whatever the equity was at start of MT4, which will most likely net you a loss. This EA can have a high number of open orders that have to be closed at the same time. What this means is you need good latency with your broker. If I were a better coder, I would use actual calculated TP and SL to make the trades close on the broker's side. These values would have to be able to be calculated and modified by the EA frequently as new trades are opened. If anyone is up to figuring this out, please feel free. Thanks for your help in advance, and your welcome for the EA. It is free, and must remain so. Please do your part to show off the results.

Feel free to ask questions, I am working on posting up and attaching my own trade explorer, having trouble with VPS right now.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
What is the EA strategy?

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Basically, the EA is a technical idea that capitalizes on the potential of probabililty of inevitable outcomes. If the price of Gold were to remain flat at $1200, or be fixed, it would doom this EA. But, since you and I know that won't happen, it is inevitable that price move up or down, and eventually, significantly. Gold was below $1150 just last week. This allows opportunity! This EA is designed with the notion that if we wait long enough (that's why patience is needed!!!) regardless if it is up or down, price will trend far enough away from a starting point to profit. Gold moves the most $$$ per $$$ of margin used, and it trends really well, so that's why I choose it. The EA has a built in profit taker, which closes all trades when overall equity is within a target. Then it starts again. Once it starts for you, you'll be able to visualize it. Any more questions?

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Can you compile it and post ex4 also ? I get errors when trying to compile. Thanks

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Sorry, can't post .ex4....what errors are you getting? Are they red ones?

--- 帖子 #7 ---
pipster this is very generous indeed, thanks for the upload. can you recommend a timeframe? also can you share myfxbook or account stats at all to give us an indication? cheers

--- 帖子 #8 ---
yes. Multiple red errors and can't compile . Undefined buy, undefined sell, undefined equity ..so on

--- 帖子 #9 ---
The timeframe doesn't matter, since it doesn't use indicators. It's your personal viewing preference. I use trade explorer, which I will hopefully get attached here soon. The purpose of this is for you guys to share your results. It won't hurt anything to throw this on a demo account for a few months.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
hmmm...i'm sorry. anyone else having this problem? can you list each red error?

--- 帖子 #11 ---
http://prntscr.com/5cgdrx Have tried in 2 diferite mt4 and couldn't compile it. Why can't you post ex4 ? FF has no rule against that

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #13 ---
for now try compiling through an old compiler you can download at the end of the first post here http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...t=mt4+compiler When it's compiled, it will spit out a .ex4 for you. This EA is pre-600 build, so that maybe part of the problem.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
my reviews after reading the thread very first **************upload ex4 file please ***************** 1.i want to back test the ea by strategy taster in tough situation sideway and trendy market .. 2.most important for 24 hours running in gold sometime gold moves sideway for 1 week and sometime it moves 50-60$ in a day one side and came to its previous position and it happens sometime without any news...so we need backtest in these situation and check the result 3. I have gone through aprox all daily ,weekly and monthly gold chart from 1999 to 2014 so we need to do back test in all situation before we run it live account. hope you see my reviews not as negatively rather than to make this auto trading system more safety thank you very much

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Thank you vm for your input, friend, BUT is it so difficult to compile it yourself rather than ask every single one of us to go through different threads and find the way to compile it. Come on. Does it sound impudent from my part? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
http://prntscr.com/5cgpvs Was thinking to check it but too much headache with a mql4 file that does not compile right and apparently i'm not the only one who has these issues. Maybe another time when something that can be tested will be posted.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
I have posted the .EX4 that I have. it replaced the .mq4 file in the first post. Sorry on original, I thought I couldn't post it. Please try running it. Just so you know, you may have to wait up to even a full day before it opens first trades.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
well, thanks, but I'm looking for the results from actual trade explorers as reviews. The way this EA works makes it impossible to backtest, sorry. I've already thought it out, and tested it to death for over a year now, so it's already to the place to demo away.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
It is funny, but my pc refuses somehow to copy this ex4 file to mql/experts directory. Anyone else has this problem?

--- 帖子 #20 ---
I'm not a mt4 expert myself, but when launching this EA, I have to go find it, it doesn't appear in the expert folder, even after you put it there, when you're trying to get it to show on the list to activate it. You have to find the "secret" folder to open it from MT4 open menu. Maybe somebody else can better explain it.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
ok ... can u show us the backtest please? ...till now we are unable to set it in our mt4 ...some strange things are happening ...

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Same problem here. Drop the EA into the MQL4/Experts folder (build 745), start the terminal and it immediately gets deleted...

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Good grief! I didn't know this would be this hard! For the guys who it is dissappearing, did you download the .mq4 file, too? Is there something about the 700 builds I don't know?

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Try looking in a folder that looks similar to this: C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\M etaQuotes\Terminal\UNIQE-TERMINAL-HASHCODE\MQL4\EXPERTS, Use your keyboard to copy (Control-C) the file from your download folder, then when you access the folder throught the open menu in MT4, paste using Control-V.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Thank you again, even though I still don't know what I am thanking for. But do you think we all stupid? Did you ever try it yourself?

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Of course, I've been running it over a year, slowing modifying it. But I havn't updated my terminal, because I haven't needed to for a few months. I do remember having to fiddle with the folders to find it. after you placed the EA in the correct folder, you'll have to restart MT4. Did it work for you now?

--- 帖子 #27 ---
36 DOWNLOADS...Now, I hope that means people are getting it to work. I knew I was taking a weak risk by just posting it outright, but please follow thru with the trade explorers on replies to this thread.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Here's what I have done on build 745 Dropped both the mq4 and ex4 file into the MQL4/Experts folder Started terminal ex4 gets deleted mq4 stays and remains visible Cannot drag EA onto chart Compiling EA gives 6 errors and 17 warning as mentioned in previous posts

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Try putting it in special folder described on post #23

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Hi Pipster, can you post the rules for taking a trade? How does the EA decide when to enter and exit? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
36 downloads and 0!!!! result. Didn't know they allow you to use build lower than 6** now. How about you please do us all a big favour and post a working ex4 file ready for digestion. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
I compiled the mq4 version on build 745 (after correcting the errors/warnings) and here are the files I took the liberty to rename it. Please download the same and change it to the name of your choice Regards Chandan

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Thanks much mate!

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Thanks chandan655, can confirm that its working now

--- 帖子 #35 ---
As far as code is observed, it opens pending positions. These positions would start as per the value of parameter StartingHour and StartingMin (11:30 hrs Server time is the default) By Tweaking it I was able to get the trades placed immediately (series of buystops and sellstops) There are quite a few logical errors in the code, Regards Chandan

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Feel free to update anything technical, but please let the basic idea remain. It is designed to always have the trades open, unless it orders them closed. I will edit the first post to include the modified version. Thanks a ton.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
As per my initial analysis the method goes as below Start at base point (current market price) Place multiple buystops above this price with a gap of 0.31 Dollars Place multiple sellstops below this price with a gap of 0.31 Dollars ex: assume 1198 as current price 1198.93 Buy stop 1198.62 Buy stop 1198.31 Buy Stop 1198.00 Buy 1197.69 Sell Stop 1197.38 Sell Stop 1197.07 Sell Stop Once the pending orders are executed, rest depends upon Money Management/ when to close etc The key should be the MM and exit criteria when it trends, you have multiple positions in profit giving a big addition to your account. Regards Chandan

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Thats right pipster I am trying to analyze it only from technical point of view. All those who want to start it better start at 11:20 Terminal time so that you needn't have to wait for the first order to be placed

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Very good! When you have put it on a demo account and run it for 3 months or more, you'll see.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Does it work on only GOLD not currency pairs?

--- 帖子 #41 ---
technically It would work... but remember Pipster's post which mentions below Gold moves the most $$$ per $$$ of margin used, and it trends really well, so that's why I choose it. Any other pair may not give you the profits as observed by Pipster.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
First of all,thank you for sharing this EA,it's working here ...Second,you say this: "Settings: leave them as is, do not modify any settings, just have the EA set to live trade, and check the import DLLs box before starting EA"...Do you mean ALL the settings?

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Yes, all settings under the settings tab are already optimized. It will automatically start, place all necessary orders with correct lot size compared to your account size, risk management is "built in", timing, etc. If you want the EA to start immediately, you can follow chandan655 advice on start and stop times. Of course you can modify anything you want, but my request is to share the results of the original on a demo account on trade explorer here. You can run more than one demo account for fiddling.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
I need to mention when you start trade explorer it won't display any trades until a trade has been closed for the first time. You can either open and close a manual trade on your demo account, losing the spread, or just wait until the EA has closed trades for the first time before seeing results on the explorer.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Hi Pipster Thank you for sharing. I have downloaded and placed on a Gold chart. Is there a preferred time frame, running on the 1H at present. Please advise. I am more than happy to open a Trade Explorer but would prefer to run it for a couple of weeks 1st if that good for you. Cheers Gavin

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Looks good to me Pipster reviewed the code briefly &amp; thanks Chandan for fixing errors! Assumption of the EA : Market is not going to stall at one price for long, and commodity like gold moves suddenly like yesterday 1142-&gt;1222(80 bucks move after Swiss voted for "No" vote) Keep your pending order with smaller leverage like 0.01 on 1k a/c in the hunt,wait for gold to trend when it does lets take yday's case only from 1142-&gt;1222 more of your buystops will get triggered at .30usd intervals &amp; when profit target set by pipster reaches it closes all orders using order comment "Gold Mine Buy" /"Gold Mine Sell" and moves on again starting from the base. For noobs one request please use the MM that Pipster insisted 0.01 lot per 1000usd don't try to over leverage to have adventure, gold can be ruthless when its going. Good luck to make profits, one more caution to the wind : use on brokers where spreads of gold is less &amp; then they don't suddenly widen spreads like this 1198.75/1204.50 it might cause this EA to misbehave ==&gt; create DD which takes a while to erase. Key is choose right broker for gold and act accordingly, please do some home work/research on right broker with demo before going live as advised by pipster! cheers, Scoob

--- 帖子 #48 ---
~Bcp1 you're good to go....TF doesn't matter, your preference for viewing. Thanks for your participation, even if it somehow goes bad for you, please let us know. This is supposed to be unbiased. ~ Scoobidoobi Your right. The gap between orders is actually the spread, so the smaller the much better. I have used Finfx myself without any problems, but anybody can use any broker they think they trust. Latency is an issue with this EA because it may have to close many orders at once. You may have sometimes where price moves fast enough to give a slight loss, actually. This is where patience and perseverance are very important. Price will also move in your favor very fast, and it has easily outweighed any slight losses. Maybe I'll elaborate more on the logic used in the approach on this more. We have NFP coming up, with other news, so getting your demo going now will give you a good chance to see what it can do.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Question to Pipster : Finfx don't widen spreads during rollover also? &amp; whats the max spread you saw for the week on gold just curious to know thanks!

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Does the EA Automatically close orders or should that be done manually? Also should the SL be set to true?

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Finfx closes during rollover, and then spreads go back to normal, which on micro account is .30-.55, which is the highest i've seen. I don't see much point in trading the ECN because the spread is the same, with additional commission. You can select micro as a demo type account. The only thing good about their pro ECN account is it is located right next to the NYC server, so the latency is 0.3 milleseconds...really good for this EA, but I don't have $10k to deposit to try it. My latency tested at 40 milleseconds, i think. I think latency trumps spread.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
For safety reasons, better to add a spread check like this : // inputs extern double checkSpreadUnder=3; //entry logic //check for spreads before opening new position if ( GetSpread() &lt; checkSpreadUnder ) { } //GetSpread function double GetSpread() { double ld_ret_0 = MarketInfo(Symbol(), MODE_SPREAD) / 10.0; return (ld_ret_0); }

--- 帖子 #53 ---
ah, more logic to divulge... Yes, the EA will automatically close all orders, and start over automatically...it truly is set and forget ....and hope the power doesn't go out. lol There isn't any reason to put SL...the way the EA works already has SL technically. Each sell order is a SL for any buy order. They just stay open because I don't have a big enough brain to figure out how to close them without messing up the close target. Also, using SL may make the EA "lose" twice as much, because another order will have opportunity to hit SL, whereas if we hedge, it's just one "SL" for both orders. What this EA is meant to do is elminate you having to sit there and trade the news, or wait for trends to seem to develop, at which point when you realize it, they are already almost done, etc. Whenever the market really moves, this EA is already there. Once you have left the EA trading for a month, you'll be able to look back and match the rises in the equity curve with the trends of gold, it's uncanny. ~scoobs... I've traded with Finfx since 2010 and never saw gold spread above $0.65, even on rollover\market close for the day. Not worried 'bout it.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Wellsaid pipster, this idea I already use with the project name "NeverClose" .Its auto protected and it works on XAU USD/ XAU EUR too

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Sounds Golden Are you able to post your explorer or MT4 report for the amount of time you have tested. These may help us quickly find logical additions from the Go set.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Fantastic pipster, I was milking with this concept EA at ICMarkets for 2 weeks they suddenly widened spreads to 7-8usd that started the downfall as I was away that time Nevermind, thats why I was curiously checking spreads at finfx. thanks fella, sounds promising broker!

--- 帖子 #57 ---
So we don't need to set a TP either?

--- 帖子 #58 ---
None kash : ). its complete auto pilot just setup at finfx demo or your favorite broker on gold sit back n relax for 2-3months to make some cash

--- 帖子 #59 ---
right, no TP...all trades are closed on equity target, which is already set ....on the best setting, of course! I have tried all kinds of various TP, SL, equity targets, levels, blah blah blah....this is best, and while it's not extreme green machine, it beats anything that's out there big, like s&amp;p, various pamms, the whole 20% per year hedge fund, it's realistic.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Hello, First, I want to thank to the creator of this EA. Really impressive! 50% last month with daily charts.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Is this a back test?

--- 帖子 #62 ---
So this is the Holy Grail ! Any other commodities you would like us to try other than GOLD?

--- 帖子 #63 ---
that backtest might look nice, but it can't be very truthful. You can't backtest when you use equity target to close groups of opened trades--sorry. But, hook it onto a demo account, link us to your trade explorer here, and in a couple of months we'll see. I don't trade anything besides gold for reasons already stated. This EA requires $1000 per 0.01 lot, so most people don't have the kind of money to spread into other currencies\commodities....you could try XAUEUR, but my broker doesn't offer that.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
So, you have been trading with this EA on live? Can you show your explorer?

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Still demoing...this project will help me prove it's worthy of funding. I'm having VPS troubles, I'll have to get it sorted out, and post it up. I have traded gold manually live, not posting that. This is about this EA.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Good day! in my Curent PL not include brokerage commissions

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I am demoing with FXCM . They have a spread of 5pip. It seems to remain constant. Is that a problems for the pending orders or do we need the pending orders to be spread out further because of the higher pips. I see Scoo mention that his EA fell through when IC Markets increased the spread to 7-8. So does the increased spread have an effect on this EA.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
It's not a problem. That's $0.50, pretty typical. Spread flunctuations don't affect this EA. Don't worry about how spread apart the orders are, 0.30-0.70 is fine. ~MidasFG good...My rooskie is rusty...how much have you netted so far? Would have been pretty nice since 11/28, eh?

--- 帖子 #69 ---
my MT4 time 22:28, with default settings setup on xau usd and xau eur, its not opening any trades rather printing the lots to trade/equity n all that on the charts. Should i need to update start time , please advise

--- 帖子 #70 ---
on what Time Frame are you using this EA?

--- 帖子 #71 ---
you can change the start time to a few minutes in the future, make sure the end time is 1 minute before, so the EA continues to trade. Sometimes it waits until the "default" time is reached to start, but once it starts, you don't have to worry about it again.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
anytime you want to look at. TF doesn't affect this EA.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
ok sure, got it. btw will this EA close positions opened by others?, I saw it uses comments to validate the order opened by self instead of magic on the contrary it shows current P/L of the pair (using my manual orders) attached before it opened an order . Is this a bug/ thanks

--- 帖子 #74 ---
After setting the time, EA started with Error 130 &amp; 4109 popup alerts continuously. I didn't change any other setting FYI

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I think that's a bug leftover from my mods...I only care about outcome, not appearance. I wouldn't trade anything else on the account this EA is on. Make it start, minimize it, watch your trade explorer. VPS is a really good idea.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
It does that if you don't have the green experts on button, on the main terminal, turned on to start trading. I never figured out how to rid that bug, but when it's on, it's gone. my coding is as rusty as my rooskie...

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Hi Pipster, I am trying to figure out how this system really works and if it makes some logical sense while I carry on with the testing. If I understand correctly, its take a price p as base line and place sell order and buy orders at certain intervals. The idea here (i think) is that when Gold starts to trend in one direction it will catch one side of the orders. For example if price goes into a down trend it will catch all the pending shorts and we would have a nice accumulation. Ofcourse we don't know how much thrashing about there will be so there is the possibility that we also catch some of the buy orders which will turn out to be losses but the number of gains from the sells should be more then the buy losses making the system profitable. So, here is where I have the question, what if the thrashing about of the price catches all the pending buys and sells that it has place before reaching you desired equity level. What is the EA suppose to do then? Practically once that happens you can never make a profit from the movement of the price as everything would cancel each other out. I haven't looked at the code yet, so how does the EA deal with this problem? Does it open one more set of trades? Because if we had started the EA on the 26th of November and let it run till today (assuming it didn't hit the Equity we had in mind) we would have triggered all the pending buy and sell. Would it just be stuck doing nothing or have you figured a clever work around for this? Thanks, K

--- 帖子 #78 ---
I found the issue w.r.t error 130 , broker didnt allow pending orders to be placed that closer found it from the broker support error 4109 if green button stopped, am concerned on error 130 where broker doesnt allow tight pending orders

--- 帖子 #79 ---
~K VERY OBSERVANT!!! good...that's the reason there's 30 orders and just the spread between them. The target is quite low, so if the market is ranging, there's not going to be a whole lot to see, and it may take 8-10 orders on a side to "win". This is the average of what happens, and the reason you must have patience. Run it for a couple of months to allow for trends and news cycles. About your worries that it may not have hit equity target. The target is very small, only $1 on 0.01 lot size. When the market starts moving, the EA goes nuts. November was a terrific month! Just the end of last week until now was really great. Just let it run awhile and you'll catch on. `Eh, scoobs...I try to let the EA get as close as possible with the pending orders...it's ok, the EA will just place the next closest order. No need to change anything.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
I get what you are saying but the situation I described is conceivable. I think we should also figure out what the EA should do incase all the pending orders have been executed. Depending on the take profit these 30 trades may be enough, it may not be. So here are my thoughts: Is there a particular reason why we are using 30 trades and not 50 for example? Is this because of margin concerns? Looking at the chart since 27th November till today, if the ET (Equity target) wasn't filled we would have already taken out all the pending purchase orders. So, have you thought of adding more orders? Why have you chosen to use the current spacing. Yes, of course the current spacing means that the shorter trends can be easily caught by the EA but increasing the gap would give us more space against the cycle I am describing Perhaps you have already tested all these out and found these numbers to work the best. In that case we could simply add this to the EA. When all pending orders have been taken out close all trades and reset. This would mean loosing Spread X 30 but then again small price to pay if this happens rarely. And if it does happen rarely then there is no need to worry and we can just have this as a failsafe. Finally another quick approach could be, if all pending orders are taken out on one side do not let the EA cross back over 15 of those orders. That is halfway line of that side. This is just brainstorming, we could mathematically work out if this is better of simple losing maximum Spread X 30 from option 3 is better I don't intend on changing anything but simply laying out the pitfalls I see in this method. For now, I think we can simply stick to your settings and do a manual reset if all orders are taken out automatically ensuring maximum loss of 30 X Spread. So while we think about this, my one question is does the Equity target of one entire cycle cover the loss of 30 X Spread? We do need to make sure that out ET is &gt; 30 X Spread to remove risks.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
#3. is correct...been there, done that, got the T-shirt cut off. I've slaved the hours away already stressing about your worries, no need for you to re-live it. Just today's price action was enough to close all the trades at least once. The target is plus spread, so the only enemy we have is latency, which is the same reason I don't have more orders setup. It takes too much time to close so many orders. We have to be able to capture the profit while it's there-quickly. Now, I've had, as I mentioned before, slow, flat markets that took 2 weeks to move...but when they did, ...wow! Don't worry, just try it...put it on, put it on the back burner, pull it out in a few weeks and look at it.

--- 帖子 #82 ---

example: start time 12:30 stop time 12:29 The EA won't open any new orders after 12:29, before 12:30.

Can you please confirm one calculation. The worst case scenario is loss of spread on all the tears being taken. What is the comparison of this loss in pips/money compared the current setting for equity target. Can you please put both into either pips or money to make it comparable. Thanks

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Mine isnt placing any orders and i think it may be the start time issue, my time now is 11.01 pls what time can i get to get it to place orders now

--- 帖子 #87 ---
The absolute worst is if price zig-zagged perfectly to cause all orders to be opened, then you would have a permanent floating loss of about 30% of account balance. ~real click make sure you'r going by the time in MT4, on the bottom of the chart. You can put in that hour and a few minutes ahead of right now...just make sure you also modify the stop time to 1 min before the start time.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Uhm... Sorry I am a bit lost. 1. I have just started trading on demo with 50,000. the EA has put orders of 5 lots of Gold per order is that correct? Could you please confirm what is the equity target the EA is aiming for? 2. Why would it be a 30% loss. A complete Zig-zag would take out all the orders. All the pending orders should cancel each other and cause any loss right? We should only loose Spread X Number of trades taken? Isn't that the case? I am missing how you get the 30%. Please can you elaborate a bit on that.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Have you already thought or tested ways to avoid the perfect zigzag by setting equity targets lower than the 30% possible drawdown?

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Thank you so much for your help , please what is supposed to happen when the time I set reaches, I expect orders to be placed , am I correct?

--- 帖子 #91 ---
business as usual, people download like hell in expectation of a holy grail, make their backtest and when the balance not doubles within a month it went to trash instead of giving hints for improvements. anyway, thanks for sharing , have to wait a few days until my new PC is ready, too much terminals at the moment on my older laptop.... Edit: you use the following line to calculate lotsize: "LS = MathCeil((LotPercent/1000)*AccountBalance())*Step;" just a recommendation, i prefer to use AccountEquity() in case the EA runs over more than one pair or someone has an additional manual trade open and the AccountLeverage() as it differs heavy from broker to broker. for example "double money2 = (AccountEquity() * AccountLeverage()) * risk;" risk is an external int in this line.

thanks Thepipster for sharing this ea. Im on demo testing today. got a alert just now when it tried to open orders 2014.12.03 11:59:37.003 Steady Gold XAUUSD,M15: Alert: Buy Order failed, Error NO: 130 Im using fxcm demo account. the micro lot for gold is 1 ,its different from others. I got 59 orders total including pending orders. it seems 1 order short.

*********I HAVE A PLAN******** First I want to give tons of thankx to thepiptester to give this ea in this thread. I think more than 100 traders have read this thread and they are interested about this auto trading .. if each people give 10$ we have a collection of 1000$ and run a live real account and we can see that live trading by investor password. Thousand of traders can see the ea performance. Someone trusted member of forexfactory collect those 1000$ and run it in a standard real account live . Why this idea came to my mind ? 1. Better to observe a single real live account than testing 1000 of demo accounts. 2. Time consuming for all traders. 3. Better to rent 1 vps and run live real account . 4. It is the smartest way to get result.All people will get satisfy seeing a running live real account. 5. if the account get blow each and every trader will loose only 10$ .I think it is not a big loss for a forex trader now a days. 6. we can understand how this ea work when market have slippage and we can see real execution how much fast in real account where as all demo accounts are ideal. AN IDEA CAN CHANGE OUR LIFE Please give your feedback of my idea Thank You

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Hi Forexinblood, it is a good idea and that way we can have serious traders input to improve the EA (incase if we need) but at the same time i thought to do same work on demo account. We can have one centralized demo account which serious traders can access and check the performance and give suggestions....but real account is more serious because 100 serious traders have funded.... lets watch other feedbacks... thanks for idea

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Pipster, I'm sure you're pulling your hair out right now trying to deal with all these people, so i wanted to make things easy for you. Loaded your EA to a Finfx demo account and have it running on my vps 24/7. Please see the TE called 'Pipster' I just created. I trade with finfx too, love them. Attached Image Don't know anything about the ea, so i'm using these settings. Changed the lot size to .2. Let me know if you want me to change anything. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Yah we can see same work on demo account but i have doubt that how many people will take demo account trading seriously. Psychologically Demo account and Live account trading have big difference for most of people's mind. (but personally i have same psychological mind on demo and real account trading) we can understand how this ea work when market have slippage and we can see real execution how much fast in real account where as all demo accounts are ideal. thank you shg for ur reply ..

--- 帖子 #97 ---
thank u for ur work can u provide us the demo account no , investor pass and server ? so that we can see the trades ..thank u ...

the price of latest few orders was too close, connection speed 279ms. but I really like this idea ....

why suddenly it close both position buy and sell although total still negative.. ? and then open pending order buy and sell again.. and suddenly close again..

--- 帖子 #105 ---
hello ThePipster...thanks for sharing the EA Is this EA only for Gold only? What timeframe is best to test? does it works on backtest or forward test only?

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Hi Pipster, Thank you for the EA. Since yesterday I have loaded on XM but no trade since 16 hours. see attached file. Bomi

hi pipster thanks for sharing this ea i run on my instaforex demo account but there is alert notification :sell order failed ,error no 130 and buy order failed, error no 130 the ea I used from chandan655 Anyone know what happened? thanks

--- 帖子 #113 ---
All set and working well. Now I sit back and relax(Don't know how long ) while my account balance installs with $$$. Edit: First set closed in Loss, No more trades opened..

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Hey Pipmaster, after watching EA in action for a while, i realised that this ea will definitely win. It will make profit but still will watch closely for atleast 2 months...I am running on GBPNZD on different demo account to watch.... thanks

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Hi... I have also problem with EA : error n130....what is the problem?

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Its a broker issue, nothing to do with the EA, error 130 usually caused by the SL/TP being too close to the Bid/Ask prices.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Thanks shiva...so we can't do nothing here? this meam tha the EA will work or not?

--- 帖子 #118 ---
I think that the way to fix this might be to modify the SL/TP after putting out the order.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Steady growth so far. 0.7% in last one hour since start

--- 帖子 #120 ---
It will work, you will have to tweak SL/TP to a permissible range of your broker. But, you need to ask ThePipster if this is okay with his strategy.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Hmmmm... Placed the EA last night and it's been running away. It seems to be closing baskets at small losses though and then resetting. Account is down about 5% Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #122 ---
I have on setups Use SL false, teka profit I don't see where can I change the settings..

--- 帖子 #123 ---
thanks shiva now after i stop the ea (not remove) the alert still coming now with error no 4109 do you know what 4109 mean? anybody try with fxcm ?if it run well in fxcm demo account) i will try because i have account there

--- 帖子 #124 ---
lol...im not giving you my vps acct and pass, so please stop asking...As i've said numerous times now, track the progress using the TE i created. Here: http://www.forexfactory.com/shug#12

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Sorry for my absense. I see tons of questions here, but some of them are the same, so I'll try to address everything in a long post here, so please read before replying. First thing is DON'T CHANGE THE SETTINGS!!! You are sabotaging yourself if you do, and if you use any other pair besides Gold! I saw some people put a value in for lot size. That will prevent the EA from automatically growing your lot size as your account grows! Making the lotpercent size higher will make it too risky. You must wait 24 hours for EA to start trading, you can change the start time to a few minutes after your current MT4 time, but must remember to change the stop trading time to 1 minute before that. If you get error 130, it means the broker has a limitation on how close pending orders can be placed to current price. It's ok, the EA will still trade, and place the next closest order that the spread will allow. It has nothing to do with TP\SL...the EA doesn't use either. Please do not ask other people for investor logins or passwords, trade explorer is sufficient to keep records, and if you want to watch the EA trade, download it and run it yourself, please! If the EA is opening the orders and immedietly closing everything, without allowing trades to open, or repeatedly losing many batches in a row, you have a broker with too much latency. The EA must be able to close all orders very quickly to capture a win. All I can suggest is research your latency, and see if you can get a different broker with better latency. Some people are asking about going live. Please demo for a couple of months first! Latency and slippage are real and relevant to live trading. While demo accounts don't have slippage, they will reveal latency problems, which are far worse! Addressing Thodie's suggestion about equity target. There is only one way to get something called global real-time equity. The EA has to know what the balance was before any trading started, and only close all trades when there is a true profit, no matter how many trades have been opened. I stand by the code here. The EA is meant to run the account by itself. ...Which brings me to another point...anybody having problems with trades closing instantly, make sure no other trades are going on besides what the EA is ordering. No manual intervention! No manual trades! Please do not bring up any subject about pooling money or running joint accounts, or pamms...there is no good way to go about this!!! It never works between people!! Just demo it and post links to your explorer. If you want to run your own personal risk on live account, that's your business. Don't rope others into it!! ~ kashtrader 1. yes, that's correct size. The EA want's to make 1% of account balance per "basket", very small target...easily acheivable, and reduces the zig zag risk greatly. 3. If you demo the EA, you'll be able to see how it'll work. The closest orders would hedge to lose the distance between themselves, plus spread. The next closest orders would lose the same, plus their distance, and so on. If a buy opens, and then price zigs down and opens a sell, that's a hedge, and an effective SL-the trades cancel each other and wait for all the other trades to be closed later. Look at some of the explorer's links that are already being posted. Everybody please remember to read the first post! I'm going to go over the couple of explorers linked now to see results.

brother i have not asked u to give vps password ..i have told u to give the demo account no and investor password ..its the best process to follow up a system why should i tell u to give ur vps account and pass? lol to u

--- 帖子 #129 ---
I'm not giving you that either. Trade explorer works just fine, so view that if you want to track the progress.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
~Shiva...observing your explorer...your broker might have some high latency, looks like it was doing good, but recent trades have closed slightly negative. You may want to do a ping test ~Shug...it appears your explorer shows acceptable latency with your broker. Don't worry about having tons of trades open, that's how the EA works. Everybody else: link us to your explorers!

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Thanks Pipster, I will check this. Also I had set fixed lot size of 0.1, should I change it to 0.0?

--- 帖子 #132 ---
ok no problem...i m not able to understand where is the problem to give that... no more debates on this

--- 帖子 #133 ---
yes, because the ea will only trade that size, otherwise. You might want to wait until the EA has just started over, so you don't lose anything.

--- 帖子 #134 ---

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Well it recovered and I closed all trades Now restarted EA with default lot size of 0.0 but no trades yet EDIT: It begins However not able to ping my broker's server. Guess they have set it so that no one can ping it.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
I pinged mine at 150ms. Guessing that's not good...

--- 帖子 #138 ---
yeah, not great.... i would say 50ms would be absolute most... if you're running a vps, you may want to find where the vps server is located in relation to the broker's server. for instance, i'm setting up an amazon vps in frankfurt, germany which will be closest to finland for me. I still won't have the best because the brokers server has to communicate with NYC first. It's about 40 ms.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
I wouldn't worry about your latency, it looks great so far...you're already up way more than I would expect!

--- 帖子 #140 ---

Thanks! If your's continues to show a downhill return by monday, I would consider other brokers. It looks like you may have too much latency. look at shiva's explorer....wow

--- 帖子 #144 ---
i attached the EA to my demo account but it didnt open any trade, neither it placed pending orders. is something wrong ? edit: will it just start at 11:30?

--- 帖子 #145 ---
whats the Max drawdown so far? and can the EA be backtested?

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Good Work. Is there any possibility of the EA to be used any currency pairs? Or any specific reason for using it in only gold?? Thanks..

--- 帖子 #147 ---
The EA will start when your MT4 time matches start time. refer to first post about this under settings I've never seen more than 15% DD, no, it can't be backtested (as I've said 8 times before). no TP, trades closed by equity target.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
One reason shiva's account is doing so well is armada markets has a gold spread of only $0.10, which is pretty much unbeatable. I've never seen it that low for gold, maybe 0.30 on a whim. Too bad they don't accept US or UK residents.

--- 帖子 #149 ---
I think they would accept UK residents. My account is on Armada UK server.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
I am trying on FXCM with a large Demo balance. The EA has opened trades of size 4 lots. What would be the take profit its after? There is 37 trades it opened. Will it be based on 37 * 4 or just the 4 lots itself?

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Shiva, what tf are you using?

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Can someone please explain me how the ea is managing losing trades? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Equity Level...

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Are you asking a question? started at around 49K

--- 帖子 #155 ---
No it wasn't a question. The ea manages the TP with equity level, not based on individual trades

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Hi Shug, TF matters not as ThePipster said. Use any TF, but only on Gold. Settings default.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
how long have you been farward testing this EA?

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Yes, I know that. But I would like to know what is the EA set to take profit at?

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Thepipster mentioned $1 per 0.01 lots. So I guess the mm calculates the equity level based on that.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Can you please read the question carefully before randomly answering. So I have 4 lots per trade and 37 trades open. Can you tell me if its 4/0.01 *1 or 4 *37/0.01 * 4?

--- 帖子 #161 ---
I would think slippage will be a very real issue with live accounts.. Especially during news or big moves, you might end up with a lot of bad orders.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
It is based on the lot size of a single trade, regardless of how many trades are open. 4 lots size should close on $400 profit target.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
It wasn't a random answer. It should be (4/0.01)*37=$14,800. To make sure you should ask Thepipster

--- 帖子 #164 ---
I don't think so..... If that were the case this trade would need to wait a good few months and gold would need to go into a huge uptrend. I think Thepipster is aiming smaller to ensure that we don't get whipped through the whole entry range. $400 is more like what I think he is expecting to get. That is really the only way this could work.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
latency and slippage are brother and sister...master the latency problem, and the slippage is minimized. This means more than the latency from you to your broker, you must also research the latency from your broker to their liquidity provider's servers.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Yes you are right. He just posted the answer to your question. Thepipster quoted : "It is based on the lot size of a single trade, regardless of how many trades are open. 4 lots size should close on $400 profit target."

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Here is mine... VPS 10k€ icmarkets Thanks Regards

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Hello Pipster, I have setup the EA to run with a Alpari UK demo account (100k). The TE will start to show up as soon as there is a closed trade. Thanks for the EA and letting me to test it.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Thanks Pips. Now I want to drill down a bit on the latency issue. Why is latency such a big issue in this case? Is it because how fast we need to close the trades? If that is the case then I don't think we need to worry about it too much (unless the EA gets stuck or something while waiting for confirmation). The reason I say this is because, when the TE is hit there are really two scenarios: 1. The price trends and continues with our orders in that case closing off some orders a bit delayed should not matter. In fact its good! 2. The prices moves back against us which is not that great I guess. If we are only trying to catch spikes then it really does matter. Otherwise if you think that the price is trending with us then I don't think it matters. Can you please elaborate a bit on this.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
How long have you been backtesting this mysterious ea

--- 帖子 #171 ---
It matters because first, all orders are closed upon reaching target. Second, the target is relatively tiny compared to how fast the price can move. MT4 has some frustrating limitations on how fast it can close a basket of orders. If you have 12 orders already open, and 48 pending orders and to have to close all of them, it can take a few precious seconds. I've tried figuring out ways to beat this, but latency is the biggest obstacle. The only other option is for someone with really great programming skills to assign a TP that gets filled on the broker's side for every order, and is modified constantly to emulate the same result of hitting a target. The pending orders would still have to be all closed before starting the next "round". Gold can move a few dollars in a few milleseconds! Usually when it does this, it has moved a little in the same direction already, so we usually have some orders going our way. It's part of the reason we want lots of small orders as close to each other as possible, and as close to the starting point as possible.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
No backtesting, only demoing for over a year, with many mods along the way. (you might get some answers by reading all my posts on this thread, including the first one!)

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Hey, I was just looking at your explorer, and noticed your using trader's way. I think they're supposed to be good. Their server is in london, so if you're close to there, or your VPS can be close to there, they should be ok. I think you problem could be if you're using their ECN account, because it charges commissions, and this EA doesn't take that into account on the target. You could do one of two things, you could use a demo account that doesn't have commissions, or you could be kinda risky and modify your setting for the target to 2 instead of 1 as the value.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Hi and thanks to share your EA, I made an backtest just on 2 month for check the trades and saw than it didn't open all orders and crash, did I made an mistake ? Thanks, regards

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Don't know what you are referring to when you say crash? It is possible for the EA to fail. For instance if you look at the attached picture where I have drawn a rectangle roughly the size of the grid we are covering with our pending orders you will notice that we would have hit all our pending buys and sells. In that case it would fail.... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I download the version CSK_Steady Gold...where can I set the target from 1 to 2 for ECN?

--- 帖子 #177 ---
guys i can see the ea opening lots of orders ..have u thought that how much Leverage do u need to open like 30-40 trades with drawdown maximum he thepipster said 15% he has seen (he is telling more than 30% is impossible) ? most of well regulated broker does not give more than 1:100 or 1:200 Leverage for metals spot like gold and silver. armada is a good option it has spread only 10 in gold and they r giving 1:500 Leverage... i m planning to run this ea in a cent account taking 1:500 Leverage in a broker .. do not forget that this ea needs large leverage to open trades.. thank u ..

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Yes sorry I would say faild

--- 帖子 #179 ---
My EA seems to have opened only 28 trades on each side. Any ideas why?

--- 帖子 #180 ---
I use a broker that offers 1:300, which means about $4.25 per 0.01 lot margin, but, if an opposite order is opened, and therefore hedged, the used margin goes back to 0...just like hitting an SL-like I've already said. No backtesting! (9th time I've posted this!) Just say no to drugs (and backtesting) ~Kashtrader, the first candle in your box probably would have went either up or down enough to close trades, and start over again from a low\high spot in the box...you'll only find out by demoing for a few months....or I guess we can crowd around Shiva's and watch money go in that pocket....just kidding...we need more explorers to give a better average, perspective, and comparison between brokers. You can see there is already considerable variance on the ones posted so far. Just don't sweat this one to death, it needs some time. Your broker probably doesn't let you open the closest trades, minumim distance rule

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Can I ask which EA you use..the EA from the 1st post or the EA that chandan655 post in the thread on post 32?

--- 帖子 #182 ---

--- 帖子 #199 ---
Great start. Thanks for posting. Keep it up there awhile.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
I hooked this up to my demo account, but it's old and pretty trashed up with lots of junk. Guess I'll have to start a new one to really get to see the effect, when I do I'll set up an explorer for it. One thing - I cranked it up last night on a $7.5 k balance and it's showing about a negative $2k equity on the open trades - would this be considered normal? The trades closed so far have amounted to about a net of $200 to the good. Also, if all 30 positions were taken just on one side it uses about all the available margin. Is this normal?

--- 帖子 #201 ---
That does't sound right. I started with around 49K and have 37 trades running. My used margins is only 2861. Also each trade is 4.90Lot

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Well, that may be true if both sides are involved. I just did a check on the margin to open one side, buy or sell. For my broker it's $600 a contract, and at that rate opening 30 buys at 0.4 lots each (which is the size it did for my $7.5 k equity) would use up $7.2k of it if there were no sells to offset the buys. I just wondered if this was the intention. How are you doing in the open trade equity?

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Doesn't seem like it should be possible to have that many only buys or sells. If that was the case you'd be way in profit and the EA would have closed the basket long ago.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
That's true, I guess that's the best possible outcome. I don't really know how the program functions on an ongoing basis to close trades and open new ones. BTW, what's the link that puts the trade explorer at the bottom of the post? Is it just a URL upload from my profile page?

--- 帖子 #205 ---
You can add an explorer to your "Signature" on your profile settings

--- 帖子 #206 ---
In what cases this EA can lose the money? Only latency is the issue or range market also the problem?

--- 帖子 #207 ---
I think sideways just makes it rest with open trades. It should only start trading again if a trend develops if I'm reading it right.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
I think if, may be wrong, all the Sell &amp; Buy orders has been opened and market comes out of the range, it will lose.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Why not make a new demo account? Takes 5 seconds and you can have as many as you want...

--- 帖子 #210 ---
I think the concept is behind this EA is valid. I recently applied a similar concept on a basket of currencies in manual with good result (only few week) but I left because of the difficulty in handling pending orders. I think keeping the low risk (lot size) as many times as we close in profit will be greater than those that we will close at loss. The only problem I see is given from increasing the lot size with the balance could be a double edged sword. Anyway let this EA work for a few months ... Vince

--- 帖子 #211 ---
He did say that the perfect loss situation would be a zigzag that engaged all the trades, which would lead to about a 30% drawdown. Unlikely, but possible

--- 帖子 #212 ---
I just checked the latency to my demo server, it's averaging around 70ms. Is this going to cause a problem with the EA? It seems like that would be fast enough, but I don't know what kinds of pings others are getting or what Pipster thinks is too slow.

--- 帖子 #213 ---
HI all gold traders, I did some backtest and think had a problem due to spread, cause an winner trade loss 17 $ instead of win 10 $. Ant body have this problem ? thanks

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Mine just keeps closing baskets for a loss, even during very low voaltility. All of a sudden, bam, and all trades get closed

--- 帖子 #215 ---
What's wrong with you? Can you read? The op has said about 1000000 times that you should NOT be backtesting this EA . Do you understand? I know there is a language barrier, but c'mon man! How many more times does it need to be said? Forward testing only

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Yup, no backtest. Even if you achieve great result in backtest, it might be a totally different story if you run it live. Why? 'Cos of latency time. In backtest, there is no latency time consideration at all. Everything is perfect. But in real live account, latency plays an important issue during trades closing time 'cos of the SMALL profit being targetted. According to the OP, time less than 50 ms is OK but anything greater than that, one might not see favorable result. I see this as a very good EA But ALAS, as I am based in Asia, the latency time to my brokers are all very high (more than 100 ms). This problem might be settled if I am using an VPS which involves extra cost.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Kip quiet guy ! no offence for me, I did backtest cause I like to understand how an system work, if you like black box, it's your problem Regards

--- 帖子 #218 ---
I don't care if you or someone said no backtests bla bla. I agree, that we need to understand how it works. I also did backtests and couldn't finish a single one because my terminal stalls after some time. My guess is it is because of "millions" of deals that the EA opens. I once stopped it manually and the chart was down meaning that probably the DD was huge. Even if you forward test it for a period of 1 year it will tell you nothing. I saw more dangerous EAs surviving this period and then boom. So I don't see what's the problem with BT.

--- 帖子 #219 ---
I have had similar thinkings about back tests but for about some time I have change my mind. There is a big difference in BT and forward Test. BTs are only for if logic works or not. And also I just did a small BT after reading your comments. I never saw millions of orders opened by the pipster EA. It worked normal. Man its time to grow up.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
I agree, looking for logic work or not, I made several start at different period, trades are differents, not linear way. I agree too for say than an backtest can be good on 10 years an fail in live at first trade (I did the experience) but never see an EA work if couple of backtests failed Regards

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Have you considered rewriting this for cTrader where you are not limited to sending (or closing) one order at a time?

--- 帖子 #222 ---
hmmm... interesting and would like to try. but I got scared...

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Broker choice seems to be key. Had run it yesterday on Global Prime with negative results. Started a new demo on Armada this morning and it is doing fine.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
mine was in negative yesterday when started but now it is in positive which is a good sign.. my broker is Alpari.... EDIT: it went to zero as new trades are opened

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Why only Armada performing well? what special factors armada have? I think spread is important.

My armada exploree has hit all pending orders on both sides. What the heck do i do now?

--- 帖子 #229 ---
For this EA starting point is important. If we start at highest or lowest price then I think we can make few bucks.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
This is the achilles heel of the EA and you are now in a perfect hedge

--- 帖子 #231 ---
about 13% Up even as we speak

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Well....just margin called a 100,000 account and blew it up. Back to the drawing board...

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Having a 0.10 spread may be a weakness. check out shiva's: http://www.forexfactory.com/shiva/46 I think people not using armada's, or similar broker with 0.10 spread should allow their systems to continue. This EA doesn't really make 10% a day, more like 1%. Most people should have to wait a week to see sustainable profit. Don't worry about floating profit\loss. For people using armada, to get a realistic result, you may have to either set the noofsteps to 60, or the buffer to 20. I haven't had any experience with such low spreads , so having all pending orders stuck open isn't good, just close them all, kashtrader. At least you can see the max drawdown is about 6%, but that's because of the low spread. ~spyderman- just keep your's running. You need to witness what happens when you let it keep running, despite the large floating loss. ~skoda2008- anyone is welcome to translate it for c-trader. I have 0 experience with that. It could prove worthwhile if the execution is fast enough. Everyone, if your demo account has commissions, it's gonna lose, because the target is below the commission. Either have no commissions, or change target to 2 from 1 in settings

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Mine just keeps randomly closing all trades, mostly for a loss Am going with a new strategy: Allow EA to place all trades, remove EA and replace with a trade manager and set a % of equity TP

--- 帖子 #235 ---
ok, that must not be the one on your trade explorer, i see 8% down...keep that one going!

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Does your demo account use commissions? if so, get one without. Otherwise, your broker is a scammer. I should have my Trade Explorer linked up tonight, in time for NFP.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Looking at your explorer, either you have demo account with commissions, or your broker or latency is lousy. Look a few posts back from this one about commissions.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
No, and its Alpari UK

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Ok, so what's happening is the EA is closing the trades the moment is sees the equity hit profit target, but the trades are taking too long to close, so the price is reversing during this time, netting you a loss. If you look in your trading history your broker should provide you at the end of each business day, they will print a report, including the closing time of each trade down to the second. If you see a string of trades taking several seconds, to a minute, that's too long. It needs to be 3-5 seconds for all trades to close, at the slowest. Realistically, I've never seen all trades close faster than 2 seconds, but the EA is set to close the opened trades first, just FYI. So, either you have slow latency, because MT4 and the broker have to communicate between each trade being closed (which makes me want to pull out the 3 hairs left on my head!), or your broker's internal latency is high, which means they're a scam. As some people have pointed out, there may be ways to program around these weaknesses, but I'm not good enough to code it. The options are to have each trade have a TP that gets modified so it hits the same target. This means the TP is the same for all trades of the same direction, and all the opposite trades actually have an SL at that same point, where if price hits it, all opened trades are closed at exactly the same time, on the broker's side! Then the EA would have to close the remaining pending orders. Also, it could be modified to start with 10 total pending orders, and expand the "grid" with more orders, if needed. This way there is less pending orders to have to close. If somebody is up for the challenge, just be nice enough to give it away, like I did here.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
It can also be an issue with user's connection, pc network problems etc. Assuming a non-vps operation.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Hmmm, I have been watching it very closely and it closes them whilst in DD. Looking at the history shows that the price didnt spike to give an equity profit and then reverse whilst trades where closing I will reinstall the terminal, reboot and start again

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Good point, but have it running on a dedicated trading server at home with a 250Mbt fibre connection, &lt; 20ms latency and spread of ~20

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Mine all close very fast with Alpari uk so now I will wait for a recovery

--- 帖子 #244 ---
From what I have observed so far, I can confidently say that this EA will not cause a margin call with default settings unless you're paying commissions or have wide spreads .

--- 帖子 #245 ---
what if all Buy/Sell Stop orders have been triggered? what will it do in that case?

--- 帖子 #246 ---
I will also add you broker too

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Same for me here on Armada !!

--- 帖子 #248 ---
So here's the detailed statement from my blown demo account. Default settings. 1:200 leverage. No commissions and a 50 cent spread. Attached File(s) DetailedStatement.pdf 62 KB | 468 downloads

--- 帖子 #249 ---
As has been said soooooooooo many times before: you end up with a pefect hedge which seems to be this EA's only weakness

--- 帖子 #250 ---
lol. Go backtest all you want then, just stop posting your results to this thread, because they are null.

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Just so I can watch the market while answering your questions... Firstly, Shiva's results are very abnormally good. It should take 2 weeks or so to get 10% profit. I think this is because of the small spread. The EA was designed to work with a range of $24-$30 price extremes, not $3-5. This is why some of you are getting maxed out, hedged out, whatever. If you don't have any pending orders left, you'll have to close all trades. I think adding 0.20 to the buffer (use 20 as the value) is the best answer. The account won't have the margin or speed to handle 60-100 trades. http://www.kitco.com/images/live/nyg...07787682455684

--- 帖子 #252 ---
On Alpari UK I have a range of around $21

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Am I right in thinking that the EA closes all trades when there is a profit of 1% of the account balance?

--- 帖子 #254 ---
With armada the ea opened the orders too close to each other causing this problem. The range/distance of the orders depends on te spread. I think currently the Ea is optimised to work with a 5 spread. Using a 1 spread is what's causing the issue. I think my fxcm account first the defaults of the EA perfectly. Will keep that running although I think my MT4 crashed hne I was leaving home today. Hopefully it's running now.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
I am not sure, but it looks like in your case the EA hasn't placed trades as per logic. Better judge would be Pipster to answer this.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
I would tend to agree, although it's hard to follow the logic. Just watching it from time to time, that particular demo was seemingly always in DD. It would close and start anew even if it was in negative. I'm no coder but there might be some glitches that only show up with certain broker parameters.

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Yes. It doesn't account for commissions, just the spread. ~spyderman- for whatever reason your statement shows the trade size was 10X what it should have been...should have been 1 lot per trade, not 10...did you leave the settings alone? It should be 0 lotsize, and 1 lotpercent. Your trade explorer demo has the correct lot size. ~kashtrader, try VPS if your having home computer problems. Amazon AWS has free micro tiers for 1 year.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
thanks. Will do. I think when you have time pips it would be great if you can please describe all the parameters and how are the ranges calculated. That will help people configure to particular brokers better making your experiment more realistic and worthwhile.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
100 pips...

--- 帖子 #260 ---
I can give some description, but just know there isn't a magic formula fix-all. Shiva's account is outrageous, but others using the same broker have negative results so far, so there's more to it than spread. Ok, how the settings work from top to bottom... Lots.......this overides the auto lotsize logic, replacing it with fixed lot size 1= 0.01 lot Lot percent............ this is auto lotsize that grows with account. 1= 0.01 lot per $1000 of account balance. BE, lockin, and SL are pretty much irrelavant. Buffer is distance in pips the closest trades, above and below, to starting price. 1= $0.01, and the spread gets added to buffer automatically. Grid step is distance between each pended order, again spread is added to this automatically. 1= $0.01 Slip is a joke because most brokers don't honor it. It tells the broker not to open an order if price has moved $0.50 while placing orders. Not relevant because we're using pending orders, not market orders. NoofSteps is how many pending orders of one kind (buy vs. sell) from starting point. the value will be 1\2 of the number of buy and sell orders total Equitygainmultiple...this is our target for profit as a percentage of what the account balance was before the start of the currently placed pending orders. 1 is $1 on $1000, which is the same as saying $1 per 0.01 lot. This is regardless of how many trades are opened or placed. Equitylossmultiple...this is an irrelevant option I had experimented with, that acts like a equity SL, but doesn't mean anything because of the hedging. It caused way too much loss. This EA will always have some kind of floating loss, until hit closes all trades when it hits target. Starting and stop times are pretty self explanatory. You can control the time of day the EA will open new pending orders after closing trades. The EA will still close all trades at target if between stop and start times, but not open new orders then. I leave it open for all possible times, because Gold makes random crazy moves when unusual news happens, like Russia invading Ukraine, etc. 1000 downloads!....geez, maybe I should have gotten a couple of bucks per ...but that's not my compensation...post your explorer and run it!

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Lol...was wondering about that big lot size. My settings were at default. Must be some kind of glitch with how the broker is reading the lot sizing on Gold. Good to know. I'll try it again and use .10 percent Thanks,

--- 帖子 #262 ---
Wonder if I should move the equity close to .10 as well.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
http://www.kitco.com/images/live/nyg...07787682455684 You shouldn't have to move equity target

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Okay, here's the new setup on ForexBrokerInc with the adjusted settings Pipster mentioned (I also adjusted equity close). Forex Broker Inc Steady Gold

I think you're right. It just closed a $13 profit on a $100K account. I reset back

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Hi, My explorer is currently in large drawdown after doing well before. it had made £250 in the £3000.00 account but then started getting massive drawdown (£250) 8.9 %. The spread is 10 pips. Should i adjust the buffer or leave to see if it will correct itself?

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Some brokers have different methods of dealing with trade orders that don't meet their minimum distance criteria. If they won't let pending orders be placed within spread distance or less of starting price, some brokers send MT4 the 130 error, but others just open and then close the trade, which causes the EA to be confused, and either cascade close all orders (in loss), or use wrong balance for equity target that ends up netting a loss. If this is happening to you, try modifying the setting buffer to 20 or 30.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Leave it if you still have pending orders, if all orders are open, then close them, and adjust the gridstep, not the buffer. I see you only have a few pending orders left open...yeah, close them, IMO. Your range of trades went from 1203 to 1209, that's only $6. Gold generally can range $10, and then breaks for another $10-$20 on small moves. Having .40-.70 is better.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Hi, Not sure what you mean by having .40 - .70 , what should I change the gridstep too? Thanks,

--- 帖子 #270 ---
yes, change the gridstep, you can leave the buffer alone. .4-.7 is the gap between orders we want. put 30 on gridstep settings as a value...that will give you $0.40 between orders

--- 帖子 #271 ---
back testing is just for ball parking. Back test result are skewed, especially over long periods of time.forward testing for a year tells you nothing? Lol...okie dokie

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Here's the little dirty secret, OK? Anybody wanting to have a backtest come out clean is doing so to try and sell this themselves somewhere else, period. This EA is impossible to backtest because there is no TP. (There, 11 times of repeating this should do the trick, right?) Foward testing is the way. You can figure this EA out in one day of demoing...especially tomorrow!

--- 帖子 #273 ---
I think the default settings that the EA comes with makes sense on the 50K FXCM demo. Once this lot of trades are closed, I am going to demo it on a 1K account with FXCM to see how it works it. If everything looks good I will be doing a Live 1K account. 1K should be sufficient on FXCM on theory right?

--- 帖子 #274 ---
are you able to get the 1:500 leverage with them? If so, it's ok. I wouldn't go live for 3 months. You must demo. You've already experienced some toughies, and it's only been a couple of days. I posted this EA with a lot of confidence, but I'm not going live myself until my final settings are proven in my own demo account for 3 months, and I want to see similar results for others...as many people as possible. with over 1000 downloads, it shouldn't be too hard. I think we have a little over 10 explorers to watch, now.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Thanks Pips. I think I got all of them other than the Buffer and Step. Perhaps a bit more explanation or a screenshot will help.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Sure...your FXCM account has 10 times the lot size it should, BTW...you can change the lot percent to 0.1, like someone else had to previously. It should be 0.5 lots for $50,000. When the EA starts, it sets the pending orders at designated distances from the current price. The buffer is an extra distance from the current price for the first closest buy and sell orders. The spread is the minimum buffer. Some brokers have rules about distances of pending orders from market price. They may even open a violating order, and immediately close it for a loss. The buffer can help get around this, but I use 1 value for default, because the closer, the better, especially when the market moves in a straight line for an extended distance up, or down. The step is the distance between each buy order, or each sell order, so for people having issues with orders getting too close together, more distance can be added, the spread will be the minimum distance.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
That makes some more sense to me now. So for 50K the lot size should be 0.5. I am going to open a fresh demo with the new settings.

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Also, is FinFx the broker you optimised the settings with ? In that case I should just demo with them?

--- 帖子 #279 ---
If this was Twitter, I would re-tweet this a 1000 times lol

New page, new chart http://www.kitco.com/images/live/nyg...07787682455684 Yes...you can demo with them, but check your ping to their server. I'm not sure...if the EA doesn't place orders right away, you can just go back and move the times.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Quote Thepipster Re: FINFX ' Yes...you can demo with them, but check your ping to their server. I'm not sure...if the EA doesn't place orders right away, you can just go back and move the times.' I opened a standard demo account with Finfx today and loaded the files only to discover they charge a commission and started racking up huge losses. Given your comments earlier today about only run the demo with non commission brokers I terminated the trial . I am looking elsewhere for an appropriate broker. Any ideas ?

--- 帖子 #283 ---
You can choose which type of demo to run with Finfx inside MT4...go to the File menu, choose the login option, and start new account...then you can select the leverage, and the type, which you want micro type, from the list. Micro doesn't have commissions. You'll also be able to "ping" the broker on the next page before you finalize the start of the account. IMPORTANT: on the next page after that it will display the login and password...if you don't copy it somewhere, you'll never see the password again to be able to start a trade explorer. It doesn't email it to you. One thing I thought of...I havn't had this problem with Finfx, because their spreads are pretty flat. But, if you have a broker who fluncuates the spread, especially lowering it for a second, then popping back up to normal, that can affect this EA, because it will be fooled into thinking you've met your target, but by time the trades close, the spread will have widened back to "normal". You can observe spreads live on myfxbook . I don't think this would be a problem with armada, how much lower can you go than 10 cents? Finfx doesn't have this problem, either.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Yes, you are right. A bit more demoing to iron out all the issues with the lot sizes, tp and other latency aspects. I think I am going to add some bits to the EA to print a few more things on the screen such as the equity target. Also whether its active or not. That should help us catch mistakes and ensure that our and its expectations match. Thanks and lets go ahead with the ride and see where it takes us I have a good feeling about this specially if we keep the target small but keep on repeating the entire process of taking trades and closing them for small profit.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
On the last profit taking about half the open trades closed, then all of pending trades, and lastly the rest of the open trades. Still it netted positive a little. Their have been some nice profits in the last day or so. It also took about 15 seconds for the entire process to finish because of a 10 second lag before it processed the last open trades after it took care of the others. When I came in today and looked at the screen their were two orphan trades, one long and one short with a negative net balance. When I closed these manually it immediately refilled the grid. Does anyone else have trouble with trades not closing? My latency to the demo server is 60-70 secs. Does this sound reasonable?

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Hi I downloaded and started trading with EA. It opened and closed multiple trades and at the end of the day, with closed trades equity is up by 10%. There are still trades open and in green by 4% Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) %.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
The close size of the gap of the trades beginning to make me think this is some sort of High Frequency Trading (HFT) algorithm. In HFT, latency matters the most. HFT traders would usually get their trading pc close to the brokers' server to reduce the latency and profit from small profit. Do this thousand of times a day by programmes and the return will be significant. For retail traders, if they can get it works on a broker and get trader rebate from it as well, the return will be greatly enhanced.

This is my reply to FxAddict who had PMed me asking which VPS I am using, he seems to be suspended for some reason. "Hi FxAddict, if you manage to get back here, I am using it on a desktop pc, No VPS. And yes its Armada markets demo account."

That recent spike down triggered all the sell stops so needs to drop further to close in profit A swing bak up, taking out the buy stops, will leave a perfect hedge and as Pipster said, a floating 30% DD that you cannot do anything with

wait for NFP dont jump guns, run on a low spread dma/ecn broker whom you trust with lower latency choosing right VPS closer to your broker servers. good luck!

Those of you using Amada demo. Which type of demo is commission free. I am using Amada Xchange and it has a commission. I am running the EA on 3 different brokers, Finfx, Alpari, and Amada. I have been getting Error 103 Failure . Anyone an idea why and what the impact is if this continues.

Hi Scoobi, I am using Armada Demo Uk server and the spread has been varying between 10-30 cents per lot. I am curious to see what will happen to the spread during NFP Attached Image (click to enlarge)

awesome spreads, do they have same spreads in live too?

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Yes

--- 帖子 #299 ---
That was pretty awesome performance on that spike, I suspect that the default settings with respect to lot size aren't working as intended for my account though.

Phew, spike down closed them all

--- 帖子 #301 ---
http://www.kitco.com/images/live/nyg...07787682455684 Ok, My trade exporer is up. NFP was ok, we're in a retrace, but I think price will make a continuation going down later today. My EA is setup with micro demo on Finfx, VPS is server in frankfurt, Germany. The Latency pinged at 29 ms...pretty good! I'm not sure if it's the fault of the VPS server being interally slow, or what, but the EA took too much time to close orders once in profit...example trade: Sell 1,192.57 Buy 1,193.66...this on close of trades, lost $1.09. This is ok, the EA is about long term, dig in the trenches and wait it out. I see some of you who were down are now going up. Patience is key. Also, the latency to the broker seems to be less important than the speed MT4 is running at on a server\computer. Shiva has a kinda high ping, but I'm guessing the time it takes for all his trades to close is small, which is good. Hang in there everybody!

--- 帖子 #302 ---
I have a problem. The EA hit the equity gain it was aiming for (I think). It then closed all the pending orders and some of the open orders but kept the rest open. Why would that happen?

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Hi all, @Thepipster: You've got me interested; thanks for sharing the EA. Here's my TE: Steady Gold , started today. This is an Armada Demo, set up on a free Amazon VPS, with latency of 160ms. I took the liberty of tweaking some settings: buffer 2.0; equity 2.0; noofsteps 60. Most importantly though, I'll only be testing it during the London session. So far, it's done well on the NFP spike down (47% gain since LO today), but let's not be greedy, it's turned off now until next week. It's a fantastic tool. In responsible and experienced hands it can be a real gold mine.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
So, looking at what the EA is doing during this spike, some observations. My account on default is trading a much larger lot size than others seem to have with the London exchanges (0.4 lots on $8k) . What this does is to cause it to hit the targeted amount much quicker when it moves, and close and reopen a lot more than others do as well. There may be some method to that madness, but I guess it could crater the account as well. It's just that I can't envision a zigzag scenario in which it wouldn't close and reopen in the midst of to collect the gains at the extremes, since the profits come so quickly as it moves. I'll open another demo in a clean account when I return from vacation. But this does seems to work as intended. I'm a US customer using ATC brokers, and my latency is pretty good at 70ms - mostly the trades close within 5 seconds as they are supposed to. Wish I could use Armada like Shiva - no chance for me there : (

I had that same trouble, I found some orphans left when it cycled on my demo too. There should be some error checking to clean up trades that didn't execute in the code, but I haven't tried to find it.

--- 帖子 #306 ---
It shouldn't leave any orphans, that, I think, is a broker problem. The EA is programmed to look for orphan trades and close them before restarting. ~Kosmo...all I can say is wow! that's more return than we should be making in a whole month! Can you please share with us, when the info becomes available to you, how long the EA is taking to close a set of trades? Your equity curve has no spikes in it, except right at the news release. Very impressive. What setting did you change when you say equity, do you mean target, or lotpercent? Can you show the lot size and profit on your TE, please? I'm also using free tier AWS, so I would think you and me have same playing ground on the server side, but you have way more latency, and you're using 60 steps...that's 120 pending orders that have to be closed! Yet, your EA had trades that closed sets every minute for 7 minutes after nfp. You got all of the spike down, and all of the retrace up. The only other difference I see is the broker. I have tried limiting the EA to sessions before, and even only traded news with it...it's ok, but back in the spring there was a lot of russia vs. ukraine news that kept happening in the middle of nowhere that I wanted to take advantage.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
My Armada demo with a £50k bank racked up a profit of £3855 (7.7%) and then didnt open anymore trades. Its still in live mode but no trade action,with one untriggered sell stop order on screen. Is that whats supposed to happen. Reaches a target for the day and stops or is something adrift ? By the way Pipster , Many Thanks for an amazing piece of work, cant believe we,ll get away with using it live in a few months time, if its still delivering.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
You'll have to close that last trade. It's called an orphan, and it should have closed with the others, I don't know why some people have that problem...I think it's broker related. Once you close it, the EA will start over again.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Thanks for that. Just out of interest I tried to delete the order, modify it ,execute it; non of them would get rid of it . The only solution was to shut it down and restart armada. Now its repopulated and off again. Thanks

--- 帖子 #310 ---
I know why its leaving orders there. I have updated the closeOrder code to ensure that it does close all the orders and waits until all of the are actually closed as opposed to giving up. However, I think that if broker is causing issues then this may just wait too long to close all the orders. I think I have to look deeper into the a and think about setting TP as well as this closing method. That will hopefully get a more solid closing system. However, setting the TP will require some clever maths and a bit of coding.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Definitely broker problem...I've never seen or heard of that before. Just because some people are getting ridiculous returns with armada, doesn't mean there the best overall If you think you can figure it out, I'm all for it...please test it for awhile, at least a few days, before releasing it to us.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Hi Pips, I like this EA. I think I am going to spend some time over the break improving some of the logic in the code such as closing of orders and stuff. I won't change the underlying idea as I think this is its strength. I will simply change code where I see it will be helpful with execution of the idea. I will be in touch with you if i need to understand any of the code in more details. Although it will take some time, I think the key will be to set the correct TP on each trade so that there is broker side closing with additional monitoring on the EA side to make sure that the broker didn't miss our closes because of a slip in the price. This will also possibly help with the 30 trades you now have. We should be able to increase that to lets say 50. This combined with small profit targets should do the trick. I will keep you posted.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
[quote=Thepipster;7923981]{quote} Just because some people are getting ridiculous returns with armada, doesn't mean there the best overall {quote} As I said in an earlier post, I have the Goldmine EA running since this morning on 3 Broker demos simultaneously,each with a 50k bank. At this moment Finfx is up £2116, Alpari up £748 and Armada (with a timeout for the orphan of about 2 hrs) up £4144. Amazing ! Long may it continue

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Pips, A quick question. Is there any reason why the EA looks to gain a certain Equity? Is it not the same if we look for a certain P/L? I ask this because, if you have multiple accounts, or doing something else then the global variable to read the previous equity can screw up the values picked up by the EA. Is it not sufficient to say we want a $100 P/L instead of saying my desired equity if $5100 when starting with $5000?

--- 帖子 #315 ---
No, Equity Profit and Trades P/L are two different matters. Global variables are bound to the current MT4 instance not all the MT4 running on the same machine.

Is it not sufficient to say we want a $100 P/L instead of saying my desired equity if $5100 when starting with $5000?[/quote] Good Question. It may not matter anymore, but originally I needed to make sure if any trades closed incorrectly, or a TP option I used to have in there was used, that the EA wouldn't change how much profit was needed from original balance. The floating p\l doesn't work, because it could change, without being true to the original account balance. Example: Lets say I had 30 trades sitting open at various prices\directions, and the balance was $1000 with target to increase it to $1010. Let's say the floating P\L was negative, but I had 10 trades that had a lot of profit themselves and decided to close them, and hope the losers would come back to net the whole account some profit. When I do that, the floating P\l goes far more negative, but my balance increases...even though the true original P\l didn't change at all. The EA would just see the floating P\l, not what is happening in the big picture. Now, if we took that example and instead of closing some profitable trades, closed some negative trades. Now, the floating P\L shifts to in the green-profit, but the total account is the same actual P\L as before, and the balance is negative! If price moved either way at this point, and the EA closed all trades, it would have no idea what the original balance was, or the required overall target. It would either cause a loss or profit at random. I'm worried this might happen after the EA gives close all orders command, but before all orders are actually closed. Otherwise, since we are not intervening and no actual TP, this isn't a real problem to us. ~go4...great! I'm just pointing out, despite the great profit with armada, them leaving a trade open, AND not letting you close it could be a real bummer if you went live. Link up the accounts to trade explorer!

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Yes, it's an impressive start, but I'm under no illusion that it'll be like that every day. I still believe, though, that it has the potential of making up to 10% per session, provided that the PA is favourable and there are no technical glitches. Some manual intervention would probably be necessary to make the best of it, as with any autotrader... As for your questions: From what I've observed, it takes around 10 sec to close all trades and pending orders. I don't mind that as long as the market is moving; that's the main key to success here, imho. With Armada's tiny spread and Gold's ATR, I believe it's only logical to be aiming at a higher span of the orders, hence 60 steps. Equity = EquityGainMultiple. Sorry, didn't realise the TE is not showing everything, I'm more used to myfxbook... Going to make everything public now. It's a humble £1000 account. By the way, it's a well known secret that Armada is one of the most EA-friendly brokers out there. Regards, Kosmo

--- 帖子 #318 ---
http://www.kitco.com/images/live/nyg...07787682455684 You may be on to something with using 2 for equity gain...it may be small enough because of the incredibly small spread, but more profit each time. It closed over 400 trades in LO, though! and you cut if off right after NFP, didn't even let it run the rest of LO that's kinda insane! I only got 41 trades, most of which are still open, and that's since the beginning of Tokyo last night! To compare, Finfx seems to be floating around 0.50 spread today. This means Armada accounts could, theoretically, beat it 4X by two ways: 1. The equity target could be doubled, giving effective spread of 0.20, still less than half! 2. You could double the number of steps, like you said, to keep from getting "boxed in" with just hedged orders, as long as margin allows. Too bad I don't have a prayer of using them, in US. Somebody mentioned likening this to HFT...well, sorta, I guess if the market moves really, really fast in one direction for a long time...but HFT has the ability to fire market orders, and then modify them 10,000 times in a single second. That's worlds away from MT4 capability. If only I could do that....

--- 帖子 #319 ---
Could you please explain with a difference in case of this EA. I fail to see a difference!

--- 帖子 #320 ---
In my mind, it's all about finding the right balance for the three components here: the broker, the tool and the nature of the market traded. Once we get that right, we should be fine... Let's not forget, either, that there might easily be a dark side to today's fairy tale; if it can make this much in a matter of minutes, it might as well lose as much. It's all good and well in demo environment, but I do wonder what the spread/slippage/execution would be like on an NFP day on live...

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Hi Cristian, Can you tell me how you tested this EA? Didn't it have open orders when the testing period finished closing which prematurely most likely would result in a loss at the very end right? How did you manage to get over that? @Pips - Don't worry, I am not trying to backtest. I am trying to identify number of times where we would have been ranged out. Perhaps we out to take very small profits to ensure that we never get swiped other than the worst of the worst scenarios.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Hi kashTrader, If I may suggest and if Thepipster is ok with it, would you be able to add a function that will 'cut off' the bot once a set overall equity target is reached? Say, we have a daily target of 5%. A cycle closes =&gt; equity is up by min. 5% =&gt; the bot shuts itself down =&gt; we say 'Thank you, Mr Market'.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
Right, at the end of my blabbering there, I said it doesn't really affect this EA the way I have it setup. ah, you're catching on! It is better to take quick, smaller profits, even if it means a little less money at the end of the month...then we can have money at the end of the year, vs. $0. That's why the lower spread of armada is so facinating. It has capability to profit much easier\faster, but requires more margin because more steps\trades are needed to avoid a "hedge box". I think the margin issue isn't actually a problem, as long as the broker allows the used margin to be cancelled with a hedged order. Either the price will move far enough to close all trades, or opposite trades will be opened, lowering the used margin, freeing usable margin. EXAMPLE: Currently my explorer shows 10 sells and 9 buys, so the margin used is only $44, leaving the rest of the account equity avail for free margin. ~KOSMO...the dark side is slippage, IMO. I have tried a reversed idea of this strategy using only limit orders...would work wonderful right now, but when the market moves, instant margin call!!! It's a lot better to just wait, even if it's a week, on the market. The example I gave on my explorer where it closed trades too slow is the "darkest" thing I've seen. It does happen sometimes, but not in the majority...it gets outweighed by all the good times later. You can do that...I don't think I would use it. I'm stuck with Finfx, pretty much, so I have to play the long waiting game. I still get weird fuzzies looking at your trade stats, under the trade report section.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
@ Pipster, how often in your testing did you get "hedge boxed"?

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Never happened after I used 30 steps per side. I have $30 window, though, because of spread. I had started with $10 "box" and it happened once then, but I increased it after finding that. As long as margin allows, this EA basically will eventually climb out of the hole with additional trades added in steps because of the effect of hedging on used margin, and the inevitability of the gold market to really move ($50-100). I super recommend holding off of going live! If kashtrader figures out how to move the opened orders to the broker to be closed via TP\SL, our trading will start looking closer to kosmo's unattainable utopia. I would wait at least until we see results from that. I have posted this EA as a gift, but for feedback to me on other's accounts (which I have learned a ton from in just a few days THANKS), but also so that, when the idea was established and accepted, we can work on improving execution! We're not there yet, IMO. Unless armada suddenly throws it's doors to all traders worldwide and has no slippage, we have to figure out other ways. ~Kashtrader... If you want another idea to throw into the complex coding mix, to solve the closing pending orders problem, could the EA be programmed to keep them open, except for ones that are not "valid", and then just have to place new ones in the "gaps"?

--- 帖子 #326 ---
So, in a box hedge scenario the EA will open additional trades?

--- 帖子 #327 ---
Thanks for the EA to check out. I'll be gone a week, but I'm going to start it up from a fresh demo when I get back and can leave it running. In the account here, only the last 2 days or so are valid and purely the result of the EA as other trades are mixed in before.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
I agree... if we only focused on selecting the times when gold is likely to move far and quick enough to outrange the box in one direction, even with some inevitable slippage, I guess the results might be close to mine of today, on live. I like the idea. Would definitely speed up restarting the cycle, especially for the 60 steps setting.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) here is screenshots from the spreads during NFP this morning...NFP was at 7:30 on the shots, but you can see the dots, and the spike on FinFX's account. That spike is $1.30, enough to cause a little problem, and different from slippage, but same result. I looked at several other brokers I am familier with, and they all had the same type of spike, some over $2. What gets me is Armada doesn't go over $0.10 the whole time. It's like there's a cap on Gold there, a flat line. This is a little hard to believe because liquidity providers do spike their spreads. If somebody goes live with armada and makes a million, without any problems, than they're great. I somehow just don't think it would turn out that way. I'm guessing they would accuse you of arb or something and boot you out. Looking at their spread history, they do have mild spikes every once in a great while, but NFP should be a given. Thoughts?

--- 帖子 #330 ---
Interesting... Armada is not my main broker. I've used them live on and off for over a year as a kind of experimental playground for various bots, BUT never on gold. From my experience, their live execution is good, with occasional slippage in the range of 0.00003-0.00005.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
hmmmm...that sounds pretty reasonable...I'm curious what slippage would have been on gold this morning live, because that spread is just flat. I'm going to post the copy of the today's trade report from my broker when it comes out after the market closes. Then we can see how long it took those trades to close. Your results this morning was what my original intention was when I conceived this idea a long time ago...tons of really small orders with small profits, that add up from high volume. How else do you get $400 from 0.01 orders? But I'll just have to live with physical limitations here in US.

I am relatively new to Forex , so I am a very interested participant/observer of this embryonic EA trading system thread. I also know next to nothing about programs and code. But I would like to throw these thoughts into the ring and watch with interest other more experienced traders responses. If any ! In sports betting with a bookmaker ( for fx trading read broker) as soon as a punter develops a gambling system which becomes profitable, and looks like it might be repeatable, especially automated, the bookmaker either, if your lucky, severely limits the amount of stake allowed, thus limiting the profit potential of the system. Or more likely shuts you down. One way or another a market maker, whether a broker or liquidity provider will do what ever is necessary to protect or enhance their profits, legally or otherwise and worry about the consequences later. The only place where a sports betting system can flourish is on an 'open' exchange such as betfair, where they are only connecting 'handsoff' peer to peer punters and 'should' have little or no interest in the outcome. The temptation for any market maker/ facilitator (bookmaker and even Betfair etc) to profit from covert intervention, at an appropriate moment, in the operation of a profitable system, must be irresistable, human nature, especially 'business' human nature, being what it is, when money is involved going through their hands. So any 'mass' market strategy which can make a s**tload of money is going to be well above the radar for the vultures. unless it works at the core of the transaction process and cannot be kneecapped without compromising the fundamentals of the transaction process, in this case, NDD retail forex trading . More thoughts ?

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Pips, The first thing I am trying to do now is setup the EA so that I can run back tests. Now, these backtests are not to see how profitable the EA is. But, to find out if and how many times we get boxed in. We need to be able to find a solution to the boxed in part somehow to be able to make this system work. Otherwise, One box in could take away all profits of a year. So, to start off the process, I have modified the EA slightly so that it automatically closes all trades once there are no pending orders remaining. This is probably the worst case scenario given that the EA should close exactly when the boxin happens. Meaning the maximum possible drawdown. Now firstly, I want to see if we do get boxed in. If we do then we need to figure out ways to get out of this. So, firstly to help with this experiment. Can you please provide me with the best possible settings for Armada at 100,000 equity. Spread on Armada is around 25. Please specify the values for buffer, grid step and equity gain from the experience you have. I want to run it with that and see if we would have gotten boxed in. Once I have that we can figure out ways to minimise the problem, open additional trades on the side where the last pending order hit, open order in between gaps (although I didn't get that) and so on.... Lets start here and take baby steps to fixing this.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
By the way the current version of the EA has a lot of bugs. One that I fixed is as follows: When TP is hit, the EA starts closing all open trades.... It starts closing all pending trades....... However, while closing the pending trades of one of the pending trades hit and turns to an open trades that is no longer managed by the EA. A worse problem is what we have been noticing. The current version of the EA cycles through all trades 3 times and looks for open trades to close. For some reason or other if trades fail to close (because of connections or broker) the EA gives up and no longer goes back to cleaning these trades up for closing.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
You might be able to see if it "boxes in" backtesting, but it might not be able to really show you because the backtest won't be able to close the trades when they would close in forward trading. It's just the way it is. But, we can get around getting stuck by adding more pending orders on each side, continuing in steps, maybe 10 more? Also, we can figure out a way to close orders that we know are hedged and therefore inconsequential, too...this will speed up things. But we would have to watch out for the target not being affected. hmmm...looks like we need improvement on making sure trades are closed, which could be helped with the idea of leaving them open for the next time, and just replacing the gaps...to do this would mean more of a fixed grid structure, instead of distances from current price.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
Hi Kashtrader. I think my Armada Demo ES is locked up by the scenario you outlined earlier ( another non closed orphan). The open trades are not equidistant from the current price action on the chart. They are equidistant from a PA approx 4 or 5 hours ago and there is a trade deficit running consuming most of the days profit. Is it worth just switching it off and restarting it Sunday evening.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
I am not sure how the current version deals with left over trades. Pipstar says it deletes them. I have now re-written the code to ensure that trades do close before moving on to the next round. Hopefully some testing and then release

--- 帖子 #338 ---
I know there will be slipups and it wont be the same. But, atleast we will have an idea of the size of boxes that have formed in the past so that we optimise the settings for the forward testing. You said you haven't been hit since using 30 steps but I just got hit. I have now increased the size but am beginning to think that adding more orders would be the only way to go. Yes, closing out orders that cancel each other makes good sense. I will think about adding that to the EA now. Lets see what I can come up with. Won't happen before Monday because I need to be able to test it when I fix these. Have a good weekend. I will be posting results of the back testing soon.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Is the orphan trade still not able to be closed manually, like the last one? If so, the platform or broker has some weird problem. I think a closeable orphan trade could happen, like kashtrader said, if a pending order is opened while the opened orders are being closed, but the EA is supposed to go back through and close them all. It probably is worth posting an updated EA once we're sure of modifications. ~Kashtrader...your FXCM account has four sell trades at 1189.03-same price! that might have something to do with it. My trades currently have $0.66 between them, so I have a $39 box. I would prefer 0.40 between them, and am contemplating taking the spread out of the math of the buffer and gridlevel.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Currently the closing of all active and pending orders are handled by a single function. Maybe we can split that into two say, CloseAllActiveOrders() and CloseAllPendingOrders(). When TP is hit, we will first close all the active orders and then close all pending orders. Again we call the CloseAllActiveOrders() once more from inside the CloseAllPendingOrders() at the end which will close the active orders if any present. just my 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
FYI, I have another one running with Armada but I forgot the password and hence not able to change the investor password and not able to create Trade Explorer. The account was created from MT4 itself, hence no email with passwords. Any suggestion for me to retrieve the investor password friends?

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Thepipster/Kashtrader Thanks for your response. I think I will shut it down, reopen it Sunday pm and await some new code update when available . I,m sure this wont be the last time for a reboot.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
You can try emailing the broker, but I've never had the password they responded with work. Otherwise you can start over... Here is a broker summary of this session's trades, I boxed in the times to be easier to read (why do they cram it so close? ) Attached Image (click to enlarge) It appears to me everything closed plenty fast, it's just the market must have been going up and down really fast...??? the last two losers at the bottom must have opened right before the EA closed other trades, their loss is not much more than spread. Everything happened within 4 seconds! at 11 the last 3 trades opened, at 12 half of the opened trades closed, at 13 the other half of opened trades closed, at 14 the last 3 trades closed, and then the next few seconds the pending orders were closed. market moved $0.82 pretty quick! 30 trades X 0.80 =24...makes sense on my negative account balance. I would like to see how this compares to kosmo's statement.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Ignore my FXCM . I am going to be using Armada. Will update the explorer soon. Yes, We need to have a good discussion about the grid level distances, size of the box etc. I am trying to figure out and see if I can bring some figures to the table. Also, I am further updating the EA to do what you suggested. Close opposing equivalent trades out early. This will help with the final real closing. Once this is done I will add logic to open more pending order when box boundary reached. I will send you a version soon for testing. Then the next step would be to modify TP's so that we have broker side closing.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Already done. But still there was a problem as the ea would only retry 3 times to close each set.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
?...sorry.. am i right to say that basically this EA trades around a price point and just stacks buy above and sells below?... because from the trades you have in demo.. it seems to be that way....

--- 帖子 #347 ---
ok, thanks Kash.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
shiva can you please provide the exact settings you are using for armada. I need to test the upgrades to the EA. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Hi Kash, I am using the default settings OOBE, Out Of Box Experience and not Out Of Body Experience Timeframe is irrelevant really but for sake of clarity, I have it running on a 5M chart.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Hi shiva, Thanks for this. Yes I understand that the default settings should give you a high return on armada because of stacking but you should also get boxed in more quickly (at least what I think). I will try the new version with defaults and see what happens. Thanks @Pips Since yesterday I have been toying with the idea of expanding the grid as necessary so that we don't get boxed in. So I was thinking why start with 60 trades? Why not just start with 4 and as soon as one side of th box gets hit we expand that side by another 2 and so on. That way we should only have open trades and at the max 4 pending orders at any time. This will reduce the closing times. I have also already done this last and it works. I have also coded the cancellation of equivalent orders it have to test that when market opens. So now it's really time to think what settings to use for the backtest as we will never get boxed in but need to optimise the settings for broker use and profitability. TP is the next thing on the table if I am a bit busy and its complex so will have to wait a bit. Let me know if you need anything else.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Shiva could you please do a favour and check what is the max number of trades you had open at any given time during your testing period?

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Hi Kash, how do I do this? I have no clue.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
For this you need to look at your trade report. The EA should be closing all open orders at the same time. So when you see a set of orders closing, you need to count the number of trades that were closed at the same this. This should give you the number of trades that were open during the cycle but had to be closed when the Target Equity was achieved. Shiva, also, can you please kindly do a screenshot of the EA settings. I am in no way able to replicate 4% equity rise over the 5 days. It takes me months to get that rise. This is important because you may have stumbled upon a set of optimised settings.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Also, whats your leverage?

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Sure, give me a few hours, I will post these. Leverage is 1:500 Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here is the statement sorted by closing time, I can't see how to calculate simultaneous open position lol Attached File(s) steady_gold_armada_statement.xlsx 570 KB | 482 downloads

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Damn it.... keep on blowing my account with the increasing grid size.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Please don't take this the wrong way, because I really appreciate your help and taking initiative to improve the system. I don't think you'll be able to use backtesting at all for this. I do agree with your idea to start with a lot less trades, I would use 5 a side, and add extras if opposite orders are opened, maybe 5 more per other side opened? It shouldn't blow the account, unless the broker doesn't allow hedged orders to use no margin. If you have the EA coded to close a hedged set of orders, just make sure it doesn't affect the target. When all the trades are closed, the EA has to make a net profit, preferably close to the target in settings. It's kinda tough to figure out when trades closed on shiva's account, because some trades are new ones that hit target really fast with just 2-3 trades, and started over again, all in just 1-2 seconds, but may appear to have been part of an old set. That's one of the strong advantages of the EA. I've tried figuring out Kosmo's history, but it's ridiculous. He has mediocre latency. And he only increased the target to 2 (0.2%) and changing the buffer to 2 only adds $0.02, so that's inconsequential, yet his EA went to town...and drained the demo bank. !!! While the best setting would be to take full advantage of 0.10 spread, I'll never be able to use it. I'm stuck with 0.5-0.65 spread, minimum, unless we change the coding to remove the "*spread" to use just pure settings for the gridlevel or distance. Having the smallest spread\gaps takes priority up to the point that margin becomes a problem. Their is a way to mathematically figure this out, I just have to ponder it. It is a matter of knowing how far price has to move and open new orders to hit target, for given losers. Look at go4's Finfx explorer (#50)...It shows on Dec 5th at 4:50pm there was 4 loser buys overcome by 12 sells, so 16 total orders with same spread as on my account, about $0.66 between trades. So we know only 8 of those trades were using margin. That comes to 3 new trades needed per loser, so adding 5 should work. I'm pretty sure the gap between trades is irrelevant for the math. I think it takes the same number of trades to overcome losers, as long as the gap is consistent between orders. With 1:300 margin, a $1000 account can theoretically open 230 non-hedged 0.01 lot trades with the margin available. Margin is a far away problem, IMO.

Hey Pipster, Please find attached my detailed statement. It looks like I've been too optimistic about the 10 sec cycle closure; from what I can see, it's more like 20-25 sec. I still don't mind as long as it's racking up profit. Surely, you can make more sense of the data, so I'd appreciate your comments. By the way, Kosmo is a woman, lol.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
kashTrader, I believe you missed my post (as quoted below). Would appreciate your reply... a simple 'yes' or 'no' will suffice as I know you're very busy with other improvements for the EA. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Your results looks impressive kosmo

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Hi Kosmo, I should be able to add that but would have to wait as its lower priority. However, I have already built in a kill switch for my testing. You can ask the EA to stop trading after this current cycle has reached the desired Equity. I am doing extensive testing over the weekend. It turns out that the original 30 approach gets boxed in 2/3 times this year alone. It spells disaster as you would end up loosing your entire account. I am working on the grid expansion as discussed with Pips. Also, am trying to address the trade closing scenario by closing hedged trades early. That way I envisige we would never have more than 10 trades to close. Also, the next iteration would be setting the server side TP. I will get on to your request as soon as I can. But you can at the moment manually stop the EA from trading after the current cycle. Thanks

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Is this Demo or Live?

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Thanks, Kash. There's absolutely no rush. I'm happy enough that you have this feature on your list. Surely, I can stop the bot manually as I did yesterday, but having it automated would be very handy indeed.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
I wouldn't dare to let this loose cannon (with all due respect, Pipster) anywhere near my live account, yet. Demo, of course.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Sorry, girl! hard for me to tell! Ok, after looking at your statement, it's even more amazing to me the amount of profit! It looks like the opened orders are closing within 3 seconds, so that's actually quite good. It's the pending orders that are taking the extra time, because there is so many of them. You also have commission on your account, which takes 0.06 per 0.01 lot away from profit, but won't affect gridlevels or buffers, yet didn't cause any negatives! Commissions only took away $23 from $494 gross profit, netting you $471! It seems to me we may have stumbled upon something that we need to be careful not to overlook. You have and equity target setting of 2, so 0.2 percent. And you have so many pending orders that I think the EA has enough time leftover to comb through and look for open orders and close them, too. I didn't see any occurance of any late opened orders, though. Let me ask you to please continue running your version of the EA for at least the next week without any changes to how you're doing it now, including only running it during London. ~kashTrader... getting boxed in with 60 trades on my account would only make me lose about 30%, not the entire thing!

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Too early to get excited, tradeforlife. These are one day results. Once I see any kind of consistency, that's where the fun starts.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Thanks for your comments, Pipster. One correction: the commission is 0.03 per 0.01 lot, and 0.06 per 0.02. That's exactly what I'm intending to do. If we're really on to something here, it's got to prove to be repeatable, first. I'm really glad that Kash did take on board the daily target feature as I strongly believe this might be an additional game changer.

I have two running now my Alpari uk and Armada, the Alpari is set up as standard and is making a recovery! The armada account is set grid to 3.0 instead of 1.0!! Just managed to have a look on my vps because been away all yesterday and see that my armada account is up 20% but still has a trade running its in + but not sure if it should be open! I will keep them both running for a while and keep up update with results! Keep up the good work

--- 帖子 #369 ---
The way things worked out last week. I prefer whiskey over forex any night. In lay language: "Great Scotch!"

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Hi Guys, I have been doing a lot testing over today and last night. I have coded various version of the EA... 1. Expanding gird when both sides are taken out 2. Progressively making the gap in the grid larger as you move away from the initial positon and so on.... However, after intense testing, I am back to square one. As always suspected (but with still faint hope) that this grid will give good returns almost all the time but will fail eventually blowing up your account. With the expanding versions you will surely blow your account now matter what configurations you try unless you have unlimited equity and are trading with extremely small lot size. With the version proposed by Pips you will get different results. Some settings will not cause account crash but a large % loss. However, these % loss will happen often and ultimately blow up your account. On the other hand there are other configuration which again will happen very infrequently but will be sufficient to blow up your account. Unfortunately, I don't see a way around. Pips, in the period you have been trying you must have seen this happen. Infact one such unavoidable instance would happen between the 12 Nov - 4 Dec period. Sorry guys.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
I 200% agree with you friend. I have worked on some similar project in past and found the same what you has written.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
So here's my trial of your system. I'm running Chandan655's ex4 file from post #32, your original ex4 file creates an error on my platform every time it tries to execute a trade, however the other file seems to work quite well. http://www.forexfactory.com/puppet81/19

--- 帖子 #374 ---
being able to backtest a system saves so much time and energy.. farward testing before backtesting is such a waste of time.. a system should first pass a backtest and then pass a farward test before going live, you have skipped step 1 which is very important and went straight to step 2, thats a recipy for disaster, code the EA again and give it the ability to be backtested.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
@Kash, With all due respect for your effort and initiative, I think the way things are going, I'm not surprised that you don't see a way around. Please don't take it the wrong way, but you're chasing an illusion here. Rather than try and make it a 100% winner, why not focus on perfecting what we already have on our hands - a tool with potential. Please, read on. @everyone, In my view, the logic of the EA itself doesn't need to be changed. All that needs to be done is to eliminate any remaining execution bugs, so that it opens and closes the cycles without any hiccups. There's no need to try and make it a 'set and forget' Holy Grail which never gets 'boxed out'. The simple truth is that it's just a tool . The built in settings, although very basic, are good enough to start with. It's our job to use this tool to our advantage, by selecting favourable market conditions to trade with it (simply put, the market needs to be moving). Once the execution side is perfected, the next step could be to think of some additional features, such as different triggers or filters to activate/deactivate the EA. Then, we will have a more versatile tool, even though still just a tool... Happy trading.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
I feel your pain, brother. Having been locked into similar boxes, it can be hard to see the light, but I do like where Kos is going with this... Kos, great eyes on the idea and to be 100% honest, it is completely different than my norm. Rather than trading against the cycle it looks to have the greatest success trending into the trend... FUCKING BRILLIANT!! I think I have a little bit I might be able to add, but will need to do it in my own specific way...might just give you a little better handle on things as well as make it a little more versatile towards other instruments... Kind of exited about the idea, really... Will see what I can whip up over the next short period of time and find a nice place for the posting! Keep your chins up in this merriest of seasons!!

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Hi Kos, Its not really about the Holy Grail but its about finding where the limitation of the current system exist. Pips pointed out that during this testing when using the current grid size he never got boxed in. However, the testing reveals that no matter what configuration you try you will always get boxed in. Also, if you use an expanding grid at one point you will get a margin call. However, with the expanding grid, the situation happens very rarely. I am still to figure out how but I want to find out ho many times this has happened. Looking at the results it seems to me that it happens rare enough to be handleable. For example, we start with 1000 and run the system. We should be able to double up pretty quickly with the expanding grid. Once we hit 2000 we withdraw 1000 and restart. That we when we hit one of those events we loose 1000 but hopefully by then we have amassed 3-4K. So, we restart giving us a winner. The problem remains when we keep money in the account and let it grow.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Pleasure to see you here and ready to roll, Magix! Thank you for taking it on board. From now on, it can only get better! Glad you find the idea exciting. So do I. Apparently, it can be quite a constructive excercise to go beyond one's norm sometimes. You know how sceptical I am about autotrading... yet, here I am, lol. Maybe it's because I've already had some success trading in a similar way manually, that makes me so confident about what can be achieved here.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Kos... Half in the bag, but 2/3rds the way through a thought and code... We've played this a little different, thus the cause of a lot of previous misery...I think I can go dynamic with an H4 pogo and an M1 trigger...SL in play and rock this fackwagon idea. A pilot is only as good as it's navigator...are you down?

--- 帖子 #380 ---
There's really no rush, Magix... I think the EA is a good base for any add-on trigger or filter, so I'm very interested to see your magic woven into it. As long as its original logic is not lost in the process, it's all good. Down? Let the bygones be bygones... Upwards and forwards!

--- 帖子 #381 ---
http://www.kitco.com/images/live/nyg...07787682455684 Let's see what this week brings us. Kosmo thanks for your correction (2nd ). Your EA still has closed more trades this morning than mine has opened since starting! Kashtrader...this EA may have some limitations, but trying to see if it was boxed in via backtest is guaranteed to give you false results. Are you even using 99% verified tick volume? The backtester will NOT close trades on actual equity target. Nov. and early Dec. were some of the best times. Just look at those moves! If you're so worried about it, you can limit the times to known trending sessions, like Kosmo has with LO. You can even just trade the first few hours of NY on Thursdays, with the unemployment report. Or, the FOMC for a few days afterwards. There is ways to minimize trading while ranging. I find hunting for every opportunity despite ranging the most advantageous. Magix, welcome! I have seen your previous contributions. Let me ask you to keep the discussion clean, (no **** words, please). Ideas are welcome, but I'm not interested in fundamental changes.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
Thanks, Kash. I value your input. If we never try, we'll never know. So, let's keep on trying, until we nail it.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Yep...I see your trades finally closed, since the market finally made up it's mind to breakout. I'm really curious to see why it shows a significant loss...maybe the market whipsawed back down after the initial spike up? I wasn't watching it live, so the only way to know is looking at a statement. It was up over 50%.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
London hasn't been generous today. The EA's taken a beating, albeit not that big, so it'll be interesting to see if and how it recovers throughout the week. I left it running past London close today (so it did catch a little bit of the latest spike up), and was surprised to see it close the last cycle once price overshot the top of the box, even though the net P/L of the open trades was still negative . Is that a bug or is it something that can be controlled by the settings? I thought it should only close the cycle when the target is reached, otherwise just carry on DD. (??)

--- 帖子 #385 ---
That loss is what surprised me! It will only close trades once target is reached, but it doesn't account for commissions, which, if you have enough trades open at 0.03 a trade, still doesn't add up to over $100. My guess is there was some kind of retrace while the trades were closing. When your broker sends you the daily statement, you'll be able to see the closing price for those last trades, and if it changed a lot, then we'll know that was it.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Yes, exactly. It was up by about 2% around 11.00 London time, and then began to slide after the NYO double top, hitting the lower sells, before the spike up. Pips, you said you traded it manually. That's exactly what I intend to use it for. Actually, it could do as a script for that purpose (so if anyone's up for the challenge to code one, please do get in touch). But what do you do with the EA? Setting the activity time around the clock and just hitting the AutoTrading buton on and off? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
mine was up by 4.4% last week but there were few trades open from friday. one lesson learnt was either we need to close all the trades by friday close of market or we should not mess up with the EA on monday when market opens. I tried to change the start time of EA and did something which messed up i think and my account went down to -8% at one point of time, now it is slowly recovering.....

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Do you think it was just really close to target when price went over $1208? Or did it go well past 2%? The only thing I can think of is commissions. When I traded manually, it wasn't with this system at all. I was only using that example to point out I learned it's better to use small lot size, small target, and hope for large volume-something my account lacks, and yours has plenty to go around. You could use this system semi-manually, by setting the times up, though. EDIT...I looked through your explorer, your buys closed with prices varying from xxxx.23 to xxxx.65...that's $0.42, which is a lot of price move while trades were closing. Oh, well...this might make us have to think twice about 0.10 gaps between orders. Still, you're way ahead of anyone else. This is a good example of how advantageous having TP, so these trades could close on broker's side, saving valuable milliseconds.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Neither. When it started closing the trades around 1202, it was still carrying a lot of negative P/L. That's why I was so surprised to see the trades close where they did. The trades never got anywhere near 1208 as they all closed within one minute - 21:04. It was the next M5 candle (starting 21:05) that reached 1208. If the trades had closed 5 min later than they did, it'd have been more probable that it was so because they reached the target. But this wasn't the case. I still don't understand how the commissions could play a role here; they just add to the negative side, so should not affect cycle closure at all. Please see the below chart, showing how it played today. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I don't mind expanding the gaps to 0.20, but the unjustified cycle closure has nothing to do with that, does it? I'd really like to get to the crux of the matter here, to be able to eliminate the problem. Whether it's the commissions or a bug in the code or the gaps. No good trading with a faulty tool...

--- 帖子 #390 ---
i run this ea on last thursday, up to know no closed order, resulting floating -280usd something wrong? when i started there was alert error no 130 but only came up once (usually when it came everytime we close, the new alert will come up right away) the broker is fxcm thanks

--- 帖子 #391 ---
I have exactly the same case, loss around -$100 with error no 130. I am using ICMarkets.

Hi Thepipster, just create a new $2,000 usd 200:1 demo account with FXChoice on my laptop which is always on.

hi thepipstr, how can modified the time starting with the brorker time and close with it , because 11 to 11 is not correct , pls advice

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Still testing and doing OK but this is what I do now in order to avoid the EA closng all trades unexpectedly (maybe there is a bug in the code?) Attach EA and let it set orders with a $30 spread betweem furthest buy stop/sell stop Remove EA once all orders have been set Attach trade manager EA and set to close all after +1% equity target reached

--- 帖子 #396 ---
~Kosmo ...I'm stumped. I know the coding on the EA isn't the problem, or this problem would appear on every trade set. My guess is somehow the broker manipulated the floating equity level, or something along those lines...??? My EA closed all trades in a big loss on a set, too. It has come back some since then. So, I need to research to see how that happened, too. Nothing like this happened when I was testing before my VPS problems. ~energetic and t3ddy...if the loss is floating, that's normal-we just wait for the market to move far enough to profit, like this morning. If the EA has suddenly closed all trades at a big loss, without going up to the target of 0.1% of account balance, than something's wrong. Just be patient and let the EA do it's thing. ~jpdlegault and msdogan...thanks for posting your explorers. Please commit to keeping them running for a few months. ~Msu1 if you change the time, just make sure the stop time is 1 minute before the start time so that the EA will continue to run. You can't have the same exact setting for stop and start times.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
.. I also joined your test group. Lets see what is happening :-)

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Sorry have been really busy but mine its still going well

--- 帖子 #399 ---
...very good! time will tell I think the loss problem has something to do with something lagging. Having calculated TP and SL so trades would close on broker's side will solve this, it's just a big undertaking to implement.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
@ Thepipster, you say: Does that mean you have coded logic into the EA to close trades in a loss in certain scenarios?

--- 帖子 #401 ---
http://www.kitco.com/images/live/nyg...07787682455684 It does not mean that...The EA should not close trades unless the equity target is reached. That said, the EA does have a setting for equity loss closing all trades when they have hit a equity loss target, but that is 9999, which is the same as zero account balance, this won't be activated with our current other settings. Welcome Mucky! Everybody, as you can see on the chart, Gold is finally really making a move up. This is what we patiently have been waiting for. When it makes a sustained trend or move without much retrace, this EA will start racking it up.

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Hi Thepipster, I have been receiving these errors, error 130. Thought you might want to know ... http://www.forexfactory.com/jpdlegault#79

--- 帖子 #403 ---
jpdlegault...that error is ok, sorry if it's annoying. it's caused by the EA trying to place pending orders right next to current price, but the broker won't allow it, the EA will still place the other pending orders, and it will work normally. I usually just drag the box out of the screen. If you're brave, you can figure out the minimum pip distance our broker requires, and change the buffer setting to that. If you're like me and are watching the market, you're thankful the EA is running now. Think about it. NFP was on friday and the market was pretty much flat at 1195...now, when there's not any notable scheduled news, gold is up $30 just from NY start. My balance is now coming back to starting point (???). party time!

--- 帖子 #404 ---
EA had closed all trades before that big move. So i missed that action. I couldnt catch it. My laptop has crashed and i had to restart my laptop again. After that ea closed after some time all positions. May be we shouldnt restart mt4 while it has open positions. Because of any error on our pc we may need restart mt4 but this time there should be errors like today.

--- 帖子 #405 ---
oh no! any open trades are in jeopardy because the market will have moved a lot. I recommend looking into a VPS, which is a reliable remote server that runs 24\7. Then you can turn off your laptop whenever you want, and not worry about crashes. Amazon has a free tier 1 instance for a year.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
That's a clever way around it, thanks for the suggestion, dambuster. Still, I hope someone will finally figure out what's causing the unexpected cycle closures... A few questions, please: - what's the spread on a1pari? - what's your GridStep setting? - what trade manager do you use? I can see you've already bravely gone live with it. Looking good.

--- 帖子 #407 ---

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Hmm... I don't really buy it, since you say you've experienced the same, with a different broker. I'd appreciate if you could elaborate on the below a bit more. Still trying to understand what we're up against here.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
All your trades are open, and hedged. You'll have to manually close them all, and the EA will start over automatically from that point. It could be the trades are too close together, so you can change the gridlevel setting to 10 or 20, if you want. ~kosmo, I'm not sure, just speculating on that part. I know being able to have calculated TP and SL setup to simulate the same goals would solve that problem. I tried experimenting with equitysentry, a public trade manager while formulating this EA. I added the functions into my EA, because the sentry was too slow, IMO. The target is calculated off of increase of equity compared to account balance. Commissions don't get factored into this, so if you're targeting 0.2%, when all the trades close, in a perfect world, you'd net 0.194%, I think. Not significant enough to be the problem, in other words, I agree with you. Let's let the EA run awhile and see if the problem repeats itself. You did have a $0.42 change in price while trades were closing yesterday, which is enough to lose a significant portion over a number of trades, but it's a different problem if all your trades are closing when they never reached positive territory.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
So maybe it's better if try to restart with your suggest setting or not? or you prefer tha i continue with this avcount waiting for recover? Regards

--- 帖子 #412 ---
When all your trades are hedged, it's impossible to recover by itself, notice your P\L hasn't changed at all. Yes, you have to close all of them and start over. You will have lost 22%. It's ok, I was apparently down 14%, and made it all back today, according to trade explorer. Why it went down doesn't make sense to me, and is the current subject of question with Kosmo

--- 帖子 #413 ---
I am confudes a little now. At first message it is written dont change any settings just let the EA work. But now i read close open trades and so robot can cycle again from begining. Which one is true ? Should we manage our trades after robot opened trades ?

Many thanks!

--- 帖子 #415 ---
New start wit 200gridstep and 200 buffer as suggested above.. Is it right? Regards

--- 帖子 #416 ---
The EA works without changing settings. Some people are having problems, and their solution is to have a separate trade manager. That's up to them. Other people have had problems with all their trades being opened, the only way to fix this is to close everything. None of this applies to you, I just recommend you use a VPS (remote server) so you don't have to worry about if your laptop crashes, and you will have to close your opened trades when you restart MT4. The EA will lose track of those. ~Cescof...sure, try those settings, they seem to be working for dambuster, he's getting 0.50 between orders now. Since he took the risk of going live, we can observe for slippage, too.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
I see. The SL function is already there, so we still need the TP to be coded in. Is the SL setting in pips or equity? I understand that it manages a cycle as a whole, not single trades? I'm glad you said it, as I was going to point out again that I don't believe the price slip was the case yesterday. So, at least we know it's not the commissions.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Ok, done for today. I didn't wait until London close, as you can see the last cycle closed around 15:35 GMT, and that's when I turned it off. Why? The move up seemed exhausted and I expected PA to go sideways from there. Spot on. It recovered well from yesterday, with a little bonus on top, and tomorrow's another day. Happy trading

--- 帖子 #419 ---
The EA can have SL, but it's not programmed in the way we want it. You can assign an individual fixed SL in pips to each trade, but it will be the same loss for each trade. The risk of this is twofold...if a trade closes on SL, the opposite trade will still be open and present an opportunity for it's own SL to be hit, doubling the loss. The other risk is when a trade is closed, even with SL, it throws off the equity target, messing up the EA. I have the SL function there, but I haven't even experimented with it. The EA does have an equity SL, too, but I found that because the trades get hedged out, it loses it's usefulness. It is the setting labeled equitypercentageloss, set at 9999. I have not experimented with the BE setting, either. I think those things are more trouble than they're worth. The SL we want is the same as the TP we want. How it should work is, when a pending order trade is opened, all the same direction trades are assigned a TP at the same closing market price ($1230 for example) that is calculated to give an overall net profit that is settable. At the same time, all the opposite trades are assigned a SL that is at the same closing market price ($1230 in this example, same as TP). Then all opened orders will close at the exact same time, because the broker will be closing them. If new trades are opened as price moves about, the EA will have to calculate new TP and SL on all orders. I think if someone want's to implement this idea, they will also have to program a growing grid, that starts small.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Thank you for the thorough explanation, Pipster. I fully understand it now. I have one suggestion and one question. Suggestion: To keep things neat and transparent, maybe it'd be a good idea to add a paragraph to the first post, where you list the necessary improvements, and the progress. Thus, if we're lucky enough to have a talented coder stumble upon this thread, it'll be a quick and handy reference point. For example: - SL&amp;TP function to be added (with a link to your above post) - unexpected cycle closure to be eliminated, etc. Question: In the first post you say: I'd appreciate if you could explain. Sorry if it's been asked already. I'm going at my own pace here. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
http://www.kitco.com/images/live/nyg...07787682455684 Thanks for the suggestions, Kosmo. If you could help me with figuring out the unexpected closure problem by posting a statement when it's available from your broker, I can start working on that. About the max possible drawdown, look at kashTrader's trade explorer http://www.forexfactory.com/kashtrader/58 . It currently has all orders opened, no pending orders left. Now, the spread is smaller than average, but the floating loss is about 2.4% Up to this point, it can't lose anymore because all orders are hedged. It's true that if he were to close all trades, and start EA again it could get hung up, but my point was centered around the worst possible scenario in one instance of time. The 30% figure comes from the spread and gridlevel setting I use, which is average among most brokers, and assumes the user will not change settings. Having less spread is a limited advantage, and the drawdown is far less, but price can range it into a lockup. Gold has the breakout characteristics that make this EA work well with gridlevel gaps of 0.40-0.60 over time, or more numbers of orders with ~0.10 sized spread. This part below will only be relevant for a few hours. Here's a couple of explorers that are similar to my broker\settings. Note they have a start entry point close to mine. http://www.forexfactory.com/mucky/77 http://www.forexfactory.com/spyderman/65 http://www.forexfactory.com/dambuster/20 -he increased his buffer and gridlevel, so gaps are about $0.50

I registered VPS and setup the EA on that. I am newbie about vps i hope it would be fast and work without problem.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Yay! good luck. If you don't mind, make your lots size and profit public.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Thanks for another clear explanation, Pipster. No more questions, for now. Please find attached screenshots of yesterday's 9th/last cycle (the Ninth Circle of Dante's Inferno comes to mind, lol). I hope the answer is there to be found... Fingers crossed! Note that the last entry on each page is repeated as the first of the next.

Thanks, kosmo! wow...21 seconds to close trades 21:04:11-21:04:32 and...$0.43 between when lowest and highest buy close price, and $0.24 between lowest and highest sell close price! Still lost $67 for the day before subtracting commission! Buys had $6.49 spanning amount from lowest to highest orders, with 57 buys. Sells had $3.74 spanning amount from lowest to highest orders, with 36 sells. I just mention this to show the range of box of orders... 57 buys slipping $0.43 would mean about $24.51 lost, 36 sells slipping $0.24 would mean about $8.64 lost, ....multiplied with the 0.02 lots... totaling an average of $66, very close to the actual $67! My conclusion is these trades took too long to close...21 seconds. I'm guessing price flickered up high enough to hit the target, then retraced really fast. We can see with the math that had all the opened trades been closed at the exact same time, there would have been virtually no loss. I've had some time to view my own statement, which did very well after the first rough loss of the period. The price changed $0.20 while those trades were closing, moving against me in the 5 seconds it took. Oh, well...i got a positive balance today ! This definitely makes the case for trying to get TP and SL so the broker closes all orders at the same split-second, instead of waiting 20 seconds, since there are so many orders. Let's keep testing!

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Hey everybody. I've been doing some research on how to implement having the EA place and modify TPs and SLs to hit target equity. One idea I have would be almost a total re-write of the code. The only things that would be the same is the lot size being calculated according to account balance. Basically, the EA would start with just 2 buys and 2 sell pending orders with TP already placed to hit a settable target. For this example, we will use 0.1%, so the target has the spread calculated so that we net 0.1% profit. We would want as close of a pip distance as spread allows possible. Lets say for this example the gap between orders and buffer to each side is $0.50. This means in order to profit and close trades, the TP would be set $1.25 from the first level's order's price. Continuing with the example. Lets say the market moves a little up and opens the first buy order. Immediately, the EA would cancel\delete the closest sell pending order, place one more sell pending order at the 3rd level away from start price, and modify the TP of both sell pending orders to $2.75 from the closest sell pending order (remember it used to be the 2nd closest.), and place a SL at the price of the cancelled sell pending order for the opened buy order. It would have to continue calculating TP and SL, cancelling appropriate opposite orders when a pending order is opened, placing new pending orders, etc. In my opinion, this looks like way too much trouble! So, I have a better idea... I think since the focus of the goal is to close the opened orders via TP and SL to have instant capture of the target, without such massive latency slippage, the current EA can just be modified to calculate mathematically the appropriate TP and SL and modify all orders, pending and open, as new orders are opened. Simplicity is better. I don't think we have to worry about closing hedged orders early, since they will also have SL\TP. That will simplify calculating, because the EA still has to calculate lot size, and target based on what it can see with floating equity, account balance, etc. While it would be nice to have the EA start with a few pending orders and add new ones to grow the "grid" if needed, it's not completely necessary, as long as the EA closes all pending orders with no orphans before starting the next new cycle. So, unless someone wants to tackle the first idea, please give consideration to my simplified idea.

--- 帖子 #428 ---
I think we must test the first EA for 1 or 2 months. After that we can say different suggestions. It is so new we must be patient.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Thanks for the analysis, Pipster. It's hard to argue with the math, and your conclusion makes sense in this particular case. BUT, it happened again today! The terminal was losing connection time after time on my VPS, so I restarted it, and that's when the EA started closing the cycle. There was no logical reason for it; no spikes that could get the price anywhere near the target; the floating P/L was well in the negative. Please see the attached screenshots. This is getting really annoying. There's no way to get reliable test results with an EA that refuses to work as it should at its very basic level. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #430 ---
If you're having connection problems with the VPS, that can cause the EA to lose track of the profit target. Then, when you restart it, it sees the target as 0.2% above current equity, which is actually a loss. I was watching your explorer a few hours ago, noting it only had sell pending orders left, all buys were open. I could see it had successfully closed a basket of trades earlier today, and didn't see anything unusual up to the point it closed everything. It had a floating loss of 200£ the last time I looked at it before you posted. If your VPS is acting up, it will be a threat to all EAs, because something could happen after it disconnects, making you lose lots of money while you're not able to catch it.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
http://www.kitco.com/images/live/nyg...07787682455684 I edited the first post to include this, but anybody must be aware if MT4 is closed for any reason while EA is active, it will not know the original starting equity, but instead start with whatever the equity shows on MT4 startup, which will most likely net you a loss, since the target will be actually negative. I'm sorry, but this is a MT4 limitation, there's no way around it. Make sure your computer or VPS is reliable.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
I see, thanks Pipster. So, it's actually my fault this time. Before I restarted the terminal, I had tried to recover the connection with the 'rescan servers' option a few times (which worked for a few seconds each time), and it didn't affect the EA then. So, I presume it was only the actual restarting of the terminal that spoilt the party. Oh well, we learn something new every day...

--- 帖子 #433 ---
I think we need to be consistent in our initial goal to make the best of the EA as it is now, first. It has a lot of potential, and the instant SL/TP function will surely make it even better. Hopefully, someone can implement it...

--- 帖子 #434 ---
I agree...I want people to be able to run it for a few weeks on current settings to allow everybody to see the robustness of the EA. We will just have to ignore accidents in judging the results. We do want to know if there are issues, of course. I've learned a lot just by posting this thing and seeing how it's working for others. Give a few months, and this thread will be catching servers on fire.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
just a proposition, although i'm not running the EA. I was writing EAs and considered the fact that if u have long running EAs and your profit is based on balance, it may hit profit calculation issue when u restart it. or it messes up when u run it for multiple counters. You can actually do this instead, write the current account balance or equity into a flat file using the functions available, upon the start of a new trading cycle. When the EA starts, in init() it loads the balance/equity written in the file into a variable, rather than what's on the account. If there is no file, it will default take what's on account of course. This will allow u to run the EA on multiple counters, even if the profit is based on balance/equity. Just specify the OrderSymbol as part of the file name.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
We are ok for testing with current method of calculating equity. The only significant change that will benefit us right now is being able to calculate the TP\SL that would correspond with the equity target. News this morning is all pro-USD, so we'll see if gold makes an extended move down...

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Hi Thepipster, my first demo test got screwed up when updates were added to my laptop and restarted it. I re-created a new explorer with a new demo account. I don't have a vpn account so this will have to do, and yes I changed my win updates settings to prevent this from happening. Sorry about that, it's a new beginning for that test.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Cool beans... (how many people use that saying? I ought to poll it) I made sure I turned off windows updates when I launched my VPS, and recommend everybody do the same. YAY! gold went down enough to close my trades. ~msdogan...lookes like your EA is doing good! You do still have your lots and account locked within your explorer. You don't have to show these, but it helps for evaluating results. You can change the settings within explorer to public for those categories.

--- 帖子 #439 ---
@ Pipster, re your recent PM: between 2 and 4 seconds to close 30ish trades, faster if fewer and a bit longer if more (VPS with ~3ms ping)

--- 帖子 #440 ---
I havent turned lots to closed. Interesting when i look my explorer it says it opened to public

--- 帖子 #441 ---
http://www.kitco.com/images/live/nyg...07787682455684 It will say public on the general settings, but if you look down, you'll see where you can itemized lot size, account balance, etc, and it will say private. ~dambuster...thanks, that seems about the same as mine right now.

--- 帖子 #442 ---
It was saying just budies and i changed it to public. Thanks for your help i hope now you can see.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Live aacount closed all trades on that last spike down and a +/- 10% retun in 6 trading days is nice, thanks Pipster! Shutting it off now for the festive season but will leave the demo running GLA

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Congrats on that...mine is showing what happens when you wait for good things... I would consider bringing the EA back online at least on the first day of the year, if not a couple of days before. Gold can make some long distance moves. Look at the beginning of this year. ~msdogan...nice to see, and good results!

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Thanks. I hope this goes on for long time. And we can make money. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Bummer on my VPS demo. Just went down far enough to hit last sell order then headed back up. If it doesn't head down I'll be in lockdown. I'm up to 28% DD. I've switched to a .2% equity profit on this one. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Mine's gone completely pear shaped today. All buys triggered, and only a few sells left. It'd have to go straight up another $40 or so to dig itself out of the hole. The present settings surely are spike friendly, if the EA is activated at the right time (e.g. manually), otherwise it's a little bit of a hit and miss. Regardless, I'll continue testing it as is, until it either blows or doubles.

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Time will tell. We have a mixture\variety of configurations with the testers here, and we'll be able to see how smaller spreads \gaps compare to larger ones.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
I'm a sucker for grids so really love this EA and the thinking behind it. However, it's somewhat of loose cannon in it's current incarnation and needs quite a bit of refining yet I am confident it will turn out to be quite a nice little EA to have in your portfolio

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Yep, this EA solves the problem of hangers\stragglers of standard grids. You just have to figure out how many open trades your account can withstand over the long run, to determine appropriate grid size. Having them too close appears to cause problems of having too many trades. However, if they are too far apart, we may be waiting a very long time for trades to come to profit.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Absolutely. For me, this is the baby steps phase with the EA. There's no doubt in my mind, though, that it's a powerful tool. The rest is just fine-tuning. Just to confirm, Pipster; the equitygain setting = 1.0, equals 0.1% of equity as the target, right? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #452 ---
yes! that calculation is correct!

--- 帖子 #454 ---
I have mine set @ a full 1%

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Are you sure? that would mean you have a setting value of 10. This means on a $10,000 account the trades would close to leave you with $100 profit instead of $10 with value of 1 setting.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Yep, remember that I use a trade manager to babysit the trades as I got burned with the EA closing trades seemingly at random and for a loss The 10k demo closes whenever the equity reaches + 1%

--- 帖子 #457 ---
ok, well it will help avoid getting stuck with too many trades if you move it to 0.1% ...it's up to you. even with 0.1%, the volume can still give you decent profit, i.e. 100 trades closed at 0.1%, instead of 5-6 at 1%

--- 帖子 #458 ---
I would absolutely agree Thepipster, 0.1% is better but... The EA is currently not stable enough to be reliably left to it's own devices and run unnatended, immediately reopening orders once the 0.1% has been achieved. So, the only way for me is to have the trade manager do it's thing, then manually reset everything which means a minimum delay of 2 minutes (resetting start/stop time) before new orders are set. During that 2 minutes, which could easily be 3, 4, 5 or more if you are not at your desk or paying attention, you might miss several profitable close cyles in a fast moving market

--- 帖子 #459 ---
I see...yep, then you gotta do what you gotta do. I will be here a couple more hours, then I'll be out until saturday. Please feel free to comment or ask questions, I'll respond when I'm back.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Right... the few remaining sell stops have been triggered today. With no pendings left, and the negative floating P/L of over 50% of the starting balance, there's no point in waiting for recovery. I'll start a new tester on Monday, with some more sensible settings this time. Will provide the link when ready.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Starting a new demo account on FXCM with this EA running on it. Wish I could use Armada but guess this will have to do. I was wondering how this would work on a big news day on a currency pair, like the Eurodollar for instance. The levels/lot size and all that would have to change, but it seems with the prospect of a big shift like on NFP day it might be interesting.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
http://www.kitco.com/images/live/nyg...07787682455684 New week everybody! Let's see what happens. FOMC on Wed. To those who have been using Armada, you still can, I just recommend changing the gridlevel to 30, that way you have a "normal" grid size, you'll still have a spread advantage.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
I havent changed anything mine setting is grid: 1,0 is it correct ? and what does it mean ?

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Yes, your setting is correct and fine for your broker. It is the distance between orders plus spread. Your orders have a good distance between them!

--- 帖子 #465 ---
ok thanks lets see what will happen on wednesday

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Here's my new tester . The settings are rather conservative: $0.40 gaps/ 30 levels. I suspect it'll be a slow earner as the target has been set at 0.6%. Pipster, I'd appreciate if you could update the link in the first post, as this one is nowhere near 'unbelievable' at the moment, lol. Happy trading

--- 帖子 #467 ---
you had a good start on the new demo, but you only have 15 positions per side. You need at least 30. whatever....you're making more today than mine has the whole time here. Green with envy. You can use more levels, if you want. See, you still have a way lower spread. This means trades won't open until they are that much closer to the pending order, so less orders are opened that would end up against you. Also, the market doesn't have to move much to get you into positive territory, and when it does you're making more profit on a given trade set.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Demo going pretty well at the moment

--- 帖子 #469 ---
yahoo! I'll say...

--- 帖子 #470 ---
Hey Pipster. Just so you know, this is my Steady Gold trade explorer now. http://www.forexfactory.com/spyderman#47 The other is running something else. Thanks

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Well, you must admit that it's much 'slower' than the previous one, lol, and today's nice drop certainly helped. Yep, that was my thinking behind the new settings. The only thing I'm still not sure about is how exactly the buffer works? I have it set at 10.0, but the initial gap between the first sell and buy was only $0.30. And it then widened as subsequent cycles opened and closed... what's the trick here? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Hi, Quick suggestion: consider exiting trades when TDI Red green goes above/below 50 level. Please check if is reasonable. Best regards, Dragos

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Two things. The buffer would be 10 plus spread, so the spread would need to remain unchanged for the distance to stay the same. Your spread may have come down from $0.10 to $0.05-$0.06. But it probably is averaging a $0.40 distance. The other thing is if your broker has a minimum pip distance rule, the EA may have skipped the first level of orders on some cycles, but been able to place them when the spread was higher. Not in my opinion. I like to have profit when exiting trades.

--- 帖子 #474 ---
I didn't change the default settings, and there are 30 per side now. I'm not sure what it was doing when you looked at it, but it seems to be working now.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
~dgodfrey...I'm trying to decipher your trade explorer. It says 16 lot size right now, but it shows the profit and leverage of 0.16 lot size. It seems your equity target is 10%, though! This does give you great returns when the market moves so far without retrace, like it did this morning, but also leaves the door open for you to get trapped easier. It's up to you if you want to continue testing this way, it won't hurt in demo. It could be if FXCM displays the lot size differently, that the EA is interpreting the equity target differently. The recent extended moves in gold shows the worth in waiting. I made 3X the profit in the last 8 hours than I have since starting the trade explorer. Usually, the market is flat before FOMC, but we have a ruckus of news happening. Russia's gone mad off the deep end, RUB and oil is tanking. I think interest rate is the key words the market is waiting for on FOMC, but the market may appear to not react, immediately. If it does this, watch what happens the rest of the week, and beginning of next week. Usually FOMC is followed by a big market trend move that goes on for several days, just the thing we like for our EA!

--- 帖子 #477 ---
You guys are clobbering me! Scores: Me 5% Kosmo 25% dambuster 20% dgodfrey 55% 72% 92%! msdogan 35% !

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Remember though that I am using a trade manager which I attach immediately after the EA has set its trades and which closes all at +1%

--- 帖子 #479 ---
Right!...it seems all listed have a higher equity percentage target than me...I will continue testing at current settings for a couple of weeks, and request everyone else continue at their current settings, too. You guys just might prove having a little more equity target works better.

--- 帖子 #480 ---

Glad to finally see yours in the green, Pipster! My 'slow earner' (lol) took me by surprise today, but dgodfrey's is just out of this world!! What's the twist in the settings there?

--- 帖子 #490 ---
I think because of how the broker shows the lot size, the EA is using a 10% equity target, which is working well for such big moves like today's. If the market goes flat, he might be waiting a long time to take a profit, though.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Ahhh... the good old leverage.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
But his actual lot size is 0.20, which is correct. it's just the target that's changed.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
I havent changed anything all settings are default. But i didnt understand why Ea started open 0,02 lots despite balance is almost same !

--- 帖子 #494 ---
It is correct for the EA to do that according to the math. It's 0.01 per $1000, so $1001 is dipping into the next $1000, next 0.01 lot. that's why 2001 was the beginning of the new millennium, not year 2000.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Yep, my bad. Thanks for clarifying that.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
http://www.forexfactory.com/dgodfrey/11

--- 帖子 #497 ---
@pipster I'm not sure what would be different broker to broker as far as targets as a percentage of equity increase, that would seem to be just a calculation. Here's my setup, I think all I changed was the start time to get going on Sunday night. Attached Image

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Your settings are exactly correct, recommended, and default. It is the calculation that is affected by how your broker displays the lot size. FXCM displays 0.1 lot as 10 lots, which makes the EA think you're really trading with 10 lots, instead of 0.1 lots, in it's calculation for equity target. The actual lots being traded are still 0.01 per $1000 of account balance, but the target is 100X more, or 10%. That's ok. Don't change anything, we want to see what happens long term on your account, as is. It may be we have stumbled upon an improvement. There are a lot of people out there who would be really, really happy to make 100% a month, even if it was only 1 day in a month. This shows it's worth the wait while markets are flat.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
I supposed 0,01 for every 1000 usd. I thought after it reach 2000 0,02 lot will be opened. ok it's style a bit different

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Error No: 131 ????? anybody Cheers

--- 帖子 #501 ---
It is addressed in the first post...next? http://www.kitco.com/images/live/nyg...07787682455684 I'm kidding, it just means the EA will be placing the next closest order it is allowed to by your broker, it's inconsequential.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
@DamBuster: For the trade manager EA you shared earlier, how are the parameters used for "Profit Target" and "Profitable Trade Amount". Does the former address pips and the latter $$ ( the redundancy of this assumption doesn't seem right )? How do you use it with grids such as this one?

--- 帖子 #503 ---
I calculate the $ amount of +1% of the equity and enter this value into the Profit Target parameter The Profitable Trade Amount parameter can be left alone and is only of significance if you set the Close Profitable Trades Only to True

--- 帖子 #504 ---
hmmm.... &gt;100% return for 13 days is an interesting return on your FXCM demo account. I will try one and see with the same setup of yours.... But of course, I will do long term testing see if there's any "Batman's trap" the whole year....

--- 帖子 #505 ---
@pipster, here's afternoon arround 5:05 PM. My VPS is also set to my local time, 5:05PM. StartingHour and StoppingHour, is that in 24H format? If so, then the value if I want to run now, should be 17, correct? I've tried set to both 17 and 5, and of course future minutes (5 minutes after current minute), but no order was created after passing the time, and no error. Is there anything wrong?

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Open your market watch window to see the broker server time and folow this example: If market watch broker server time is 17.35.15 then Set StartingHour to 17 Set StartingMin to 37 Set StoppingHour to 17 Set StoppingMin to 36 Check that market watch broker server time is 17.35.59 or less as EA is attached If everthing else is set then the EA will start placing orders on the first tick after 17.37.01

--- 帖子 #507 ---
OK, got it and it is executing. Many orders was created, and I got error Sell Order failed, Error No. 130. My account FXCM Demo, starting is USD 5000. UPDATE: I guess that error should be fine after googling, I got this " Your pending order price is 'too close to market' ". After got a little look at this, technically, this is the same "old" trapping method, which I'm also using in my TradeExplorer. Probably a bit different logic as it creates many buy and sell. Honestly, this strategy is interesting to know after I decided to start trying. Good choice to use this on XAU/USD, high movement, high profit, and very friendly with trapping method. And as I observed many times, the enemy of this method probably is only flat market / sideways. But see the bright side, 90% of the time, market is always moving up and down, right? As other's said, it depends on the spread, and/or broker choosen. So, I may see the result in 2 - 3 months in front. I would like to ask some questions: Once tested OK, if I would want to start Live with only $100, still impossible , huh? How is the strategy if I would want to exit from this? The reason is, at some point of time, people would want to get big withdrawal (if got a profit). Withdrawing, it will be safe if no open trades of your strategy. Quite scary seeing so many open trades.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
so I am testing this since 24h as I couldn't be much in front of the pc. Yesterday I opened a demo with 5000 USD and reserve Broker, this Ea handled fine with many +pips. Today I put this Ea on my primary broker with 500 USD on demo. It started fine with 0.01 lots as expected and closed all pending orders and open orders with only almost 1 dolar of gain in short time, then I wait and it does not show any reaction. After 1 hour I restarted the Metadtrader and Ea again. After 1 hour it opened again new orders and pending orders and closed all them in 30 minutes with almost 1 dolar gain. So my question is , is this normal behave, do I have restart the Metatrader again to get again new orders ( also in such moment I understand to change time starts, this is not my main question) It just surprised me because it closed all orders and pending orders and I did not get the point if it will start again automaticly without my touch. )) Maybe my test time to understand this was too short.

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Exit is simple to make withdrawal. Just push the button above the Metatrader to ececute automatic EA. Then close all open orders, manually it will take maksimum 1 minute. Or use a script to close in one time all open orders and pending orders. (google that it is easy to find , ı am not using it) Then after your withdrawal again push the button above the Metadtrader to restart your EA. Maybe also you neeed to restart the Metatrader because this EA uses the account equity and need to re-calculate it perhaps.

--- 帖子 #510 ---
I do really know how to close. many yrs doing all kind of trades, and myself is an IT guy, how do I not know how to close trades? Am asking about exit strategy if I would want to withdraw. The reason I'm asking this, let us put up an example. I got profit of $2500 from my trading starting from $5000. But I'm still having $500 hanging in there. How would I make sure that all open trades are closed "naturally" by EA without opening another new trades, before doing withdrawal? So I just hope that this EA is not creating orders like "forever" if I would want to run it in VPS. There must be some exit strategy for this, rather than just close the open orders manually.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
I wouldn't start with anything less than $1,000, and then only when you've demoed it long enough to be confident. You are right about this being a trapping idea, we are ambushing the profit, when it comes to us. Similar to equity millipede, or fishnet ideas. It doesn't hurt us when the market is flat, just makes us wait longer. As freedom48 pointed out, you would want to close all trades, preferably just after it had taken profit, and turn EA off to withdraw. Most brokers don't allow withdrawls while orders are open. You can change the stop time temporarily, then the EA won't open new trades after that, and before the start-time. ~freedom48 ...I would start by checking that the stop-time is 1 minute before the start-time, otherwise if your server's time is between them, the EA won't trade. If you trade with less than $1000, the EA's profit target is only $1. But, don't get hung up on how much profit it makes at one time. I made over 4% yesterday, after waiting 11 trading days. When the market does move, the winners will add up. FOMC ahead!

--- 帖子 #512 ---
StopTime.... I see... didn't notice that Frankly, your EA just giving me another idea. But, I'll put it up on another time to research. Hope this trades giving me a good result, I'll do test it out in my VPN, for at least 2-3 months. I'm following dgodfrey , starting with FXCM. And, sorry for not putting up the result in my signature. I got my own stupid strategy there

--- 帖子 #513 ---
As the Pipster pointed out, the FXCM account is different in how they term what one lot is, in that it's 100 times the size other brokerages use for the same amount of investment. IE, 0.1 lots at Armada is 10 lots at FXCM. No big deal, except internally the target that the program creates uses lot size in it's calculation, so the target increase in equity that the program is trying to reach to close is 100 times larger using FXCM as the broker. I'm fine with that, it's working like a charm in a moving market. The downside is that I could get a perfect box hedge more easily in a jittery sideways market, in which case I would have a 30% haircut or thereabouts.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
BTW, thanks for the info on TMv1, dambuster. I like that program!

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Which makes it worth testing for an extended period of time, to see if it needs a haircut, and if it makes so much profit that a haircut here and there is worth it. You can always add more steps, too. So, what do you think about the auto-compounding? You've been able to experience doubling the lot size, safely. You can see your profit "curve" has a curve to it. It's ok, I'll keep tabs on your explorer. If your account has the same lot size display anomaly as dgodfrey's, it will make it interesting to see if it actually turns out similar results. I see you trade a lot in gold, it's my favorite! I have tried and tested so many variations of grid, it's crazy. I've tried limit only orders, TPs on limit only orders with equity target on stop entry orders, TPs on stop entry orders with equity targets on limit orders, standard grid with closing everything when the account could actually net a profit, SLs, TPs, on and on. This is the only idea that worked, so I'm sticking with it.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
I like the auto-compounding, it should be consistent risk. $6k for a haircut is scarier than $3k when the account was new, but 30% is 30% lol. Just hoping that drawdowns are few and far between.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
~sigh~ My computer keeps saying its going to autoupdate in a few minutes. Hope that doesn't screw things up. Guess this would work better on a VPS. If I shut down without closing out the trades and restart, will the program understand whats going on or will I have to close all the trades manually?

--- 帖子 #518 ---
It will mess up the EA to restart MT4 It will read the floating loss as the new baseline to target from.

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Well, guess I'll suck up a $1200+ loss then and start it up again. Wonder if the code could include a manual override for the equity?

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Restarted and the grids back on. A bunch of volatility just now for some reason, opened the grid right into it and got a couple of error 130's

--- 帖子 #521 ---
http://www.kitco.com/images/live/nyg...07787682455684 ...sorry that would be FOMC it will be moving around for a bit, then settle on a big move, probably down, over the next few days. I would consider changing the settings on windows autoupdate. it can be very annoying. If you go with a VPS, you have to change them anyways.

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Yeah, wow. Talk about timing, lol. Got most of the sells and now it's up in buy territory. Easy come, easy go

--- 帖子 #523 ---
I just opened a new demo on FinFx. I love this EA, it looks very promising, I just wonder how the results would translate to a live account.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
I love it too, except when it hits all the stops on one side and then reverses

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Count me in the fun club too. It went through today's roller coaster rather gracefully, lol. Just waiting for a convenient moment now to turn it off and add more levels.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Yellen's press conference had tons of contradicting answers, thus the up, then down, then up again, then down again. It should start trending down after market reopens in a little more than an hour. I would like to see $1180.

I would like to see it down around 1175 for sure. Anywhere but up! All but 2 of my sell stops are hit.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Hi Just started testing this EA seemed to be fine opened and closed some profitable trades but now for some reson none of the pending orders are being opened and the price field is yellow, i have checked and there are now error messages Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Hahahaha..... Finally I found someone in common... I should add you in my buddy list.... Gold is different indeed, the characteristic is quite unique... The only thing I can't beat is that gold requires a higher capital. My strategy requires $100 at least, yours is $1000. Anyway, I got so many losses which is not closed. Is this due to changing the timeframe in the middle of running EA? If so, I guess I need to stick and keep the chart as it is, no need to change this and that.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
If gold goes down again probably account will be blow up

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Why? If you ran default and it has taken all 30 trades either side you should have a perfect hedge with about 30% DD

--- 帖子 #534 ---
whats cooking up guys, some folks running negative 40%down few having lady luck with the bot

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Because there is no pending orders all orders are in trade I use default settings.

--- 帖子 #536 ---
If you run default settings, including 0.01 per 1000 then the worst that can happen is around 30% DD - no way can it blow the account unless somewthing got changed or your broker is messing about

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Drawdown is %44 now balance 1381 equity 765 If it doesnt go up it is a big problem. If there would be pending sell orders i wouldnt be afraid but now i am afraid

--- 帖子 #538 ---
are you guys planning to stop this thread after blowing respective test accounts..., if its blowing accts consistently why not reverse copy the strategy and gain $$

--- 帖子 #539 ---
from the looks of it , can blow even if you reverse copy too.., need ultra speed execution tiny spread on gold like LMAX/FXPIG for this bot to succeed i presume

--- 帖子 #540 ---
@Pipster Soooo, now that I am boxed, with all the stops taken except 2 sells, what's next? To hit breakeven gold would have to get to something over 1400. Is the plan to wait on that, or to pull the plug on the box, manually stop out and restart?

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Interesting that yesterdays move resulted in a $30+ zigzag. My bad luck to be anchored in the middle of that, instead of at the ends. The movement is there, just that my timing was perfect to lose money. Trying to anticipate the extremes to establish the grid would be a wholly different approach I guess, might be worth looking into. Also, Pipster, I guess you looked at the antithesis of this approach? It seems that with so much time spent in the red, taking the other side of these trades would correspond to time in the green. Unless the spread screws that up. And of course, along that path lies unlimited risk without SL's , unlike this.

--- 帖子 #542 ---
http://www.kitco.com/images/live/nyg...07787682455684 Well, we've had some surprise news, SNB comes after FOMC and has a negative interest rate move. Gold went the opposite of what I thought, plus it's going the opposite of the way it normally interacts with the dollar basket against other currencies. Some of you say you're boxed in. Now is a good time to look at possible improvements. Look on your platform and see how much free margin you have. One step we can take is adding more steps (no pun) so the EA has opportunity to dig out of the hole sooner. Another step is increasing the distance between orders, so that less steps are using less margin, and the box is bigger. Reversing the EA doesn't work over the long run. This EA is made for the long run, gold may be obsessed today with staying at $1200, but sooner or later is will be at $1100 or $1300. The more distance the orders have between them, the slower the profits, but safer the EA is going to be. With a fixed drawdown of 30% or so, there is enough free margin to add twice as many steps, 60, to make EA work. Then we just have to wait. I have had to wait 2 weeks at 20% hanging down for the market to move enough to make it. Now, if someone really wants to try the limit order only version, I can post it, but you would have to know when to turn it off while market trends, and around news time, use the SL function, and target known ranging times, accepting the risk that gold can make unexpected, crazy moves right out of a slow, flat session, like Tokyo.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
That is one of the gold's characteristic I think. I observed it many times. I would say that the chance of moving up to $1100 or down to $1300 is like 50-50 with some waves up and down then staying at the same position in $1200 . Even on this week most likely moving then stay. One thing for sure, it is moving.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
I think we must add more steps and option manage lot size may be reduce lot size for 0,01 for every 1000 usd. Ea should open 0,02 lot after 2000 usd not after 1001 usd.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
An observation: the EA kept closing trades (at seemingly random intervals) mostly for a loss I have now changed EquityGainMultiple to 10.0 (+1%) and it seems to be working just fine. This leads me to suspect that shooting for 0.1% leaves it prone to barely blipping into profit, it then closing trades while the price falls away again resulting in losses Will keep watching

--- 帖子 #546 ---
What can I say... I like what I see. Attached Image (click to enlarge) We'll see what the future brings, but my thoughts are in agreement with dambuster; it's pretty clear that wider gaps and higher equity target play a vital role here.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
I agree! Let's keep testing.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Absolutely. We have to eliminate the 'lady luck' variable from the equation, first...

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Kosmo, do you mind saying how you have modified the settings? Im thinking that a reboot on the bot on my account would be in order, and I'll change the profit parameter to take a profit at 1% (unlike the current equivalent 10% on FXCM brokerage calculation). My feeling is that the 10% target, while spectacular when it works, is setting up this box all too easily. FXCM has a 40-50 point spread, so what would you suggest as a reasonable step size?

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Well, I manually exited for a sizable loss, putting myself almost back at the beginning balance. Here are my current settings, with adjustments for step size and target. Since I'm using FXCM, I took the EquityGainMultiple to be 1/10 of the default, effectively making it 1% gain target. Attached Image

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Well, scratch that. I did restart it, but just with the equity target modified. Whenever I tried to modify the step size, it only opened two stop orders, one buy and one sell, after giving several error 4107's for invalid price. Guess I'll have to look at the code and see what I'm doing wrong in the settings I used. Right now I'm shooting for 1% equity gain on default settings.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Here are my present settings, dgodfrey. Attached Image Your spread is closer to Pipster's, so he's probably the best person to ask that question. But, following the logic of my settings, proportionately, I'd say $1.50-2.00 gaps, with the target at 0.6%. Pipster, please do correct me if I'm wrong here.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Thanks, I'll redo the grid step to decrease my box likelihood hopefully.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
That worked on the grid step, now at around .75 between steps. Thanks again : )

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Looks like you got it. There is a huge difference between 0.1% and the 10% you were targeting. Lots of room there.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
how to share my trade explorer?

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Go to settings and put it into your signature

--- 帖子 #558 ---
a bit confused, my Steady Gold, nothing was closed from the start of this strategy until now. I guess something wrong. Is somebody could tell my why it is not closing the orders till 3 days or more? For now, I'll close it off, restart the strategy again.... UPDATE: got 3 Steady Gold in my TE, Armada, AGEA, and FXCM.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
All orders are filled since wednesday but ea doesnt open new pending orders. I have %1674 margin. Total orders 58. Ea should open new pendings orders to make profit but how ? Is there any settings in it ?

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Nope, you are boxed in, hedged and the EA will not open any more orders. You have 3 options: Close all open trades and start again Extend the grid manually to say 35 either side of the current box Remove EA and trade out manually

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Hi everyone, my testing is not doing well. Should I continue and let the ea recover from its pit. Could be interesting to see if this possible for the ea to do should gold gets out of ranging?!? Personnally, I am curious of the outcome. This is one of the reason I did not test with a 50k account but with a 2k account. Once I send this reply, I'm off for an appointment. Should be back and check any reply in about 2 hours from now For now I let the ea do its things. Will see!

--- 帖子 #562 ---
An observation about FXCM : The fills are pretty far off the mark, not much matching the desired fill price with the actual. This is in demo, not sure about what it would be like in a live account. It could be lagging I guess. When I compare the fills to ATC brokers it's pretty poor, as ATC is right on the money for the most part. Update: Just checked the latency and it's averaging about 80ms, compared to an average 60-70 for ATC.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
I changed the settings from 30 to 60. All orders are cloesed immediatly and started a new cycle. But why ea still open 0,02 lot ? Account is under 1000 usd !

--- 帖子 #564 ---
http://www.kitco.com/images/live/nyg...07787682455684 The EA only closes trades when the equity profit target is reached. Until then, all your trades will float around until the market moves far enough to add up to net profit. This is an unusual outcome after FOMC, you can see other currencies moved a lot, especially usdjpy. But, gold will make a move sometime. As mentioned by others, the EA doesn't add more orders to the ones already placed. It sounds like we need 60 orders to overcome weird ranges like this post-FOMC. This EA has had much higher than expected returns for some of you, so it may make you impatient for the next move because you're thinking it will continue to make this above average profit. Patience is key!

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Did you change whilst the EA had open trades or was already attached to the chart? Seems that is a no-no for this bot. Once it is affixed, don't change anything, don't shut down or restart your terminal, just leave it alone else it will do strange and possibly unwanted things

--- 帖子 #566 ---
The EA will close and restart the cycle if you: close and restart the terminal change the timeframe change the settings So, once you get it running, leave it alone. If you want to change anything, wait for a cycle to close and turn off autotrading. It's a sensitive creature, lol.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Are you sure about the timeframe Kosmo? I think I remember ThePipster saying it didn't matter, or was it simply the timeframre you attach the EA to doesn't matter but changing it once it's attached does? ThePipster, can you clarify?

--- 帖子 #568 ---
I don't want to speak too early just because mine is doing well at the moment, but I'm not so sure whether we really do need more levels. After the false start of my first tester (60 levels and $0.10 gaps), once I've changed to wider gaps, it became much steadier. This post-FOMC range will be a good test for my present settings.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Yep, the TF you attach it to doesn't matter, but when you change it while it's running, it'll restart the cycle.

--- 帖子 #570 ---

--- 帖子 #578 ---
@Pipster: Just wondering if it would be possible to stop out the trades instead of hedging them. The reason would be to save the double hit on spreads that a hedge imposes once the hedge is closed, as compared to simply closing the trade and not hedging. The effect would be to hollow out the center of the grid as the market wallowed around the middle of the grid. When I closed out that boxed grid I paid around an extra $280 on spreads that could have been avoided. ($20 x 0.5 x 28). For instance, if the price action hit a buy limit order then the corresponding sell limit order would be cancelled and a stop loss would be put on the resulting open buy order at the cancelled sell stop price. Only one spread hit would be taken if it was stopped out, and only one commission would be paid if applicable. The reason I was asking is that I know that your logic uses the account balance versus equity to pull the trigger on taking the profit, and a starting balance variable would have to be used instead, since the balance would be floating.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
I have downloaded it and took it on a test drive back testing....it never gave me one trade and i dont understand why.....tried different pairs, reset setings, readjusted them....nothing no trades for me

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Earlier in this thread Pipster explains (many times) why backtesting won't work on this EA, kind of why we're doing this test.

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Well, I was asking, just want to check that the logic in your EA is really up and running, coz seen nothing from there (no closed trades) and have idea in detail how your EA is working. Currently only 2 of 3 demo acct of mine has already closed order. So I guess it is running and up. Anyway, I am keeping it running, we'll see till end of this year.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Still stuck to 1197 like sh!t to a shovel...

--- 帖子 #583 ---
http://www.kitco.com/images/live/nyg...07787682455684 You can do that by making a setting in SL and turning SLs on. The reason I don't use it is a hedge effectively closes one trade, so one loss...but if you hit a SL, than the other trade could possibly hit it's SL, too, which will make you lose twice as much money. I believe the equity target gets changed to a bad number, too.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
In the scenario I was talking about, once you hit the trade on one side the other one would be cancelled, so there wouldn't be the "other trade" to get hit. A hedge is effectively a locked profit or loss, it really doesn't matter when you get out unless you deconstruct it. Which we don't do here.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
That's possible, but not in the scenario I was mentioning. I'm assuming both trades have already opened. Your scenario has been mentioned, but is part of the advanced programming someone would have to step in and do. I'm not versed enough to do that complicated of coding.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
This EA still is full of surprises (read: imperfections)... again, it unexpectedly closed a cycle in negative, around 3 a.m. GMT. There was no price movement to push it to the target; the closing price was arond $1199 - a level that price had visited at least 6 times since the cycle opened - still within the post-FOMC range. The Experts and Journal tabs are showing nothing that could cause the closure, no account disconnections either... Am I missing anything?? Now that the price finally broke out to the downside, the balance is recovering slowly, but that's beside the point... Pipster, have you considered/tried taking the bot to the Platform Tech forum? There must be someone knowledgeable and kind enough out there to help us... All I can see in this thread is some well known coders just lurking and moving on... Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Mine did similar even after not changing timeframes and not touching anything Oh well, back to letting the trade manager take control once the EA has set it's grid Hopefully this can get sorted out soon

--- 帖子 #588 ---
I really don't know what's going on. I haven't had any inadvertent closings like that, and haven't seen anybody else with that problem, besides dambuster, as long as they're not changing their TF, or settings. I have decided that price is going to continue down, and have closed all but one buy trade, leaving 30 sells open. The EA is still going, so it will only close trades when the original equity target is reached. Since it didn't close everything on me, this leaves open the possibility to use the SL function, mentioned by dgodfrey, I just would recommend a high setting, maybe $20, so that the market doesn't leave you behind in the wrong direction.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
I'll work on the coding for doing the SL scenario I mentioned, it would be good to avoid getting hit twice on spreads and commissions. It shouldn't really change any other behavior or performance - just a different way to skin the cat to save a little money.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Just a little more and it should recycle. BE for me is just over 1177, the recycle should occur around 1175-1176

--- 帖子 #591 ---
This will repair it pretty fast if you're right, hope you are. I wasn't thinking this was part of the system though. I guess it's one way out of the hedge box.

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Dambuster is with a different broker, so at least we know it's not a broker related issue. I didn't touch anything either (I know its usual limitations by now). I understand the use of SL is an option, but I'd rather see the existing problem solved than have to go around it with the SL in play. There must be something in the code that makes the EA unstable. As long as the EA is unstable at its very roots, there is no guarantee that using SL will make any difference.

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Mines up a lot ATM, but not closing as it should by the money management I put in it. I had it closing at 1% equity increase, it's already well past that. I'm not home to fix it now, sure hope it doesn't bounce back up before it takes the profit.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
UPDATE : target reached Imagine riding it all the way down from $1200, scaling in along the way... Now, I wouldn't dare do it live (just yet), with the EA as unstable as it is, but I'm sure you get the idea of its potential once it's 'healed'... the rest is just a little awareness of pure and simple PA.

--- 帖子 #595 ---
YAY gold is doing what is was "supposed" to after FOMC. (why did it wait so long?) You can see my explorer simulates what trades would have looked like with a perfect scale in, now 100% PROFIT. But, there is no way of know when it will happen ( thelast 7 trading days is good case in point). We just have to wait and snipe them.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Very nice drop, finally away from that damned 1197! TM closed all EA trades at +1% and have just reset

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Why sell low (right after FOMC), when you can sell high... There was the channel support line in the way that price perfectly respected and bounced off of, resulting in the second failed rally. Then, it was romancing with $1200 for a while, confirming resistance, and then - hey ho, down we go!

--- 帖子 #604 ---
@ThePipster, would you mind to explain in details technically for each and every parameters in the screenshot below? Why I'm asking this is because of some broker, doesn't reflect the same as in Armada. I know this could be because of different spreads , but if you can explain it, I can try to find another settings that fits with another broker than Armada. If you see in the 1st screenshot below, In Armada (left), the order created was so tight, but different in another broker (right, still loose after changing some parameters).

--- 帖子 #605 ---
It is because of the spreads. The buffer and gridstep adds more distance between orders. If you use value 10, it adds $0.10 to the distance.

--- 帖子 #606 ---
Here's a modified version of Pipster's EA to address this issue. I'm using version 765. When a trade is opened from the pending grid pool it's opposite number is deleted. No hedging should occur. A stop loss is in the place of deleted side for the opened trade, these are put in on initiation of the grid. This version should function the same as the original, but should save half the commission and spread cost. Of course, with no hedge, it won't be possible to step out of the hedge grid one side at a time, such as Pipster just did. A comment is put in the place of maxloss to say what gain is being sought. The default grid spacing, etc. are in line with Kosmo's settings. A flag is placed in the inputs to allow the time check to be bypassed. ("UseTimeOfDay") Set this to true to make the EA wait on the clock. Any errors or loss of functionality is purely my fault. I have it working and it seems to be doing fine. I'll put up a trade explorer for this version too.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Thanks, though. Is the pic below the best illustration for your EA?

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Here's a chart using the non-hedging version. Just going sideways in a narrow range, hollowing out the grid. No open positions at the moment. Since the sell positions are put on after the buy positions in the code, they overwrite the buy text on the screen. The buys are there though. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #609 ---
I put up the code for a version that doesn't hedge the trades, but I put in a request to have the post removed. I had used a different method to store the starting balance on the account and it caused a reset when MT4 was turned off and back on. Not good. I have put Pipster's method back in but I'll test it a while before posting the code. Sorry for the confusion if anyone is trying it out. The difference is in using the Get and SetGlobalVariable functions in MT4, which are stored for a while on the computer. Got hammered a little on the open - gapped open past my stops on the two open sell orders on the non-hedged version. Guess that's a weakness in having no hedge.

--- 帖子 #610 ---
No, that's a standard hedge you're looking at. This EA only has stop entry orders. As everybody can see, we had a big gap up after the holidays, so my closing all the buy trades caused a margin call, but the EA will still be trading from a smaller balance. Of course, if this had been a live account, I never would have closed those trades, but just added more on each side, and sat and waited. I was inpatient, and wanted the EA to be able to continue cycling so people could see how it works. I will leave it running at the lower balance so that everyone can see the longer-term results, until someone can implement the TP\SL idea. Thanks, dgodfrey, for your efforts, on coding SLs so we don't have to close so many open orders. That should help protect profits. There are still trade explorers on the first page that show the EA doing very well.

--- 帖子 #611 ---
My one currently kickin' a$$

--- 帖子 #612 ---
I guess that's just done manually? I dumped my trades when I got boxed, but I should have just maybe added to it as you say. Just closed out my trades at a small profit and opened it back up on the standard hedge - I had the wrong lot size on it, too small. The non-hedge is working too, closed out for just over 1% profit as requested and reopened. That gap was good to you, Dambuster!

--- 帖子 #613 ---
So, is your version doing ok, then, with keeping the original equity target, despite closing trades to SL?

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Yeah, it was working before that way, but I had to put back in the global variable functionality to maintain an accurate starting balance when the market closed and I shut down the computer. After I put back the global variable I deliberately closed and opened it a few times, turned off the MT4, etc to check it. It's working like your original program now, as far as holding onto the starting balance. It was working before without these latest changes as regards to taking SL's. I have it running on an explorer called "Steady Gold No Hedge" separate from another one with your original code.

@Pipster and/or dgodfrey Seeing how Wednesday (24.12) and Friday (26.12) played out, I have a thought/request/suggestion. For the original version, would you be able to code in a visual aid, in the form of two horizontal lines (custom colour), showing the BE area and the target area on the chart, for every cycle? For those who, like myself, will be using the EA as a semi-auto tool, it will be an invaluable help in decision making, based on PA. Have a look at the picture. I run this test without manual intervention, but if I was using it for live trading, the third bounce off the ascending support line (marked as 'BE area') would be my decision point to reload the cycle. Why? Because I could see that PA was very reluctant to go lower; it formed a 123 pattern around the support line and broke out to the upside. Now, seeing all this action so close to my BE point, with no chance to reach the target, it would be a perfect place to reload the cycle and grab the rally instead, with minimal DD. I hope you understand and are able to add the feature. Many thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #616 ---
I had been thinking about those numbers, Kosmo, just in the vein of reasonable expectation to get a return. That's why I closed out that box, there wasn't any reasonable expectation for gold to get back over $1400 anytime soon. Do you have any idea about how they should be displayed, though? I was thinking that if they were just lines and close by they would probably get masked by the grid itself. If they were far away (like my 1400+) you wouldn't know where they were. And there will be two sets of BE's and targets, of course, on the buy side and the sell side, unless all the orders on one side are already filled. Then there would only be one way to make a profit - on the filled side. They would also necessarily be hypothetical, since they would assume perfect fills with no slippage in the trades that might happen on the way to those levels. Kind of tricky, in that getting to the profit line, for instance, might involve hitting additional stop orders, which would alter the profit line. What I'm trying to say is that although the breakeven or profit target might exist at a particular price point now, by the time you got there it might have moved to another price point in some scenarios. With respect to your example chart that's probably not the case for the sell side, but probably would be for the buy side. I'll see if I can tinker with it anyway. I'll just stick in the custom color lines and we'll see how that works. Sounds like fun

--- 帖子 #617 ---
I'm glad we share the idea, dgodfrey. What I have in mind is just simple horizontal lines. Even if the lines themselves get masked by the grid, still the price level will be highlighted on the price scale, and that's all I need to see. You actually made me realise there would need to be two target lines, or target projections. But I think there will only be one BE line - once trades get open, no matter what the proportion between the number of buys and sells, there will only be one common BE level for all of them. And of course, it will be moving up and down (as will the target projections) as price fluctuates and subsequent pendings get hit, so the lines need to auto-update to show the current BE/target levels. I imagine that the lines will reflect, and be based on, whatever chosen settings. I don't mind if they only show approximate levels (the more accurate the better, of course); it's just meant to be visual aid. Based on current PA as well as the number of trades currently open on each side, I simply want to have a quick reference point to better picture the probabilities. The chart I attached in my previous post was very rudimentary, indeed. It didn't really show the whole story, i.e. by the time price reached the marked BE area, I had more sells than buys open, and the actual target was just a few levels below the orange support line. It was clear, though, that price wouldn't go any lower. As it was also clear that it started changing direction, had I had the BE/target lines in place, it would've been much easier to see it was high time to reload. I'm sure you'll come up with something clever.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Might the attached be similar to what you are looking for?

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Looks like it might be a step that way. I've got the coding done, I think. Just need to test it to see if it's really going to work or not. Only puts up the numbers in the comment block at present, I'm not really sure you can do indicator stuff from within an EA like put objects on the screen, I'll have to check on that.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Very useful, thanks! All we need now is the target projections. @dgodfrey - maybe it would be easier to modify the indi to show targets, rather than try and implement it in the EA... (?)

--- 帖子 #621 ---
I'm not sure. It would make it easier to go with a standalone indi, if I can get all the info from the way the grid is structured somehow. It's not working yet for what I've already got done, just giving me some bogus number. Gotta comb back through the algorithm and see what I did wrong

--- 帖子 #622 ---
This version fixes a problem the original one had about resetting and reinitiating the program if MT4 was turned off. It holds the initial balance values in global variables that should persist, as Pipsters hedged version does. If you want to try this at all, use this version instead of the other one. I asked admin to take that post down, but they are being slow to respond.

Thank you for sharing,but got lots of these alerts....

--- 帖子 #624 ---
This question gets asked every 2 or 3 pages........... It simply means that the EA tried to set a trade to close to the actual price and the broker refused it. Quite normal and nothing to worry about

--- 帖子 #625 ---
@Kosmo: Got it working after a fashion. I'm testing it a some to see if the numbers stay correct. It's only displayed in the comment block at present. I'll check into drawing those horizontal lines. Or would this be ok? In this screenshot there's only one buy order up, and you can see that the profit target on the buy side is closer than the sell side. That's because to reach the sell side you would incur a hedge loss with the existing buy order as you moved there, whereas on the buy side no hedging is incurred. These numbers assume a straight line shot toward the targets, picking up the pending stops as they are hit.

http://www.kitco.com/images/live/nyg...07787682455684 Glad to see you guys are putting on your thinking caps! Just so you know, if you can code a line that shows a calculated price for BE and profit target, it is the same math that can be used to place a single TP and SL for all trades to get them closed on the broker's side! This would make a huge difference in the outcome. This Friday will mark 1 month since starting this thread. We now have some time the EA has been running to step back and examine the results, and see if there is any immediate improvements we could make, besides coding in a single TP and SL for all trades. The first one I see is my 0.1% equity profit target isn't making me much profit on my account. When I have a string of winners, the equity line remains pretty flat. I think I need to increase it to between 0.3% and 0.5%. I've been able to see the improvement on other's accounts who used an increased amount. I also see that too high of an amount would be detrimental, aka, 10%. I also see that I need to use 60 steps, instead of 30, and I have the usable margin to do that. I would say at this point, dambuster's account is the model account, showing the expectation of return I have experienced in the past.

--- 帖子 #627 ---
About that, Pipster. At present my numbers are based on calculated values for the grid. Because the spread changes in my account, so do the numbers. It would be much better if I stored the real values for the grid as it was created, similar to the arrays used to store ticket numbers in the no hedge version. My results are off some, checking it now my values are incorrect for the sell side after the overnight action. Back to the drawing board. It sure would be nice if I could just read the values for the stops directly from the pending orders, but I don't think that can be done. You can look at opening prices, but not pending ones

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Another cycle closed on that drop, nice

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Is there a way for the EA to plug in a fixed number for the gaps, and just have that as a setting that the user would have to calculate for themselves? For instance, if the spread seems to average $0.40, and the desirable gap is $0.50, then the user would have the gridlevel as 10, and then put 50 in a new setting, (maybe gridcalc, or something?) and the EA calculated off of that number (50). Then it would just add more math to do when more orders opened in a way that the TP\SL would have to change.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
How did you worm another cycle out of that??? Dang! @Pipster Sure, that's easy enough. It could be set by the external inputs to any value, then that would be applied rather than having it float as it does now.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Would it be possible to also have a "StartNow" function so that it would trade the moment you drop it onto a chart rather than have to set start/stop times?

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Boom, and another

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Hi Friends, is it possible that when I backtest the Ea with current spread, that the EA crashed, because I have 3 digits after comma and the spread indicator shows me 300 pips spread? Do someone else have the same problem? I think the real spread is only 30 pips and than is the EA really really profitable....

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Yes, that's built into the non-Hedge version already. Just a flag you set to use the time or not. Looks like mine cycled too . I have 1% target, but I guess my grid spacing must be different than yours.

--- 帖子 #635 ---
That would make it THE BOMB!

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Many thanks for your time and effort, dgodfrey. If your testing confirms that the numbers are accurate, I'll be happy with it as is. I'm getting a little confused... Doesn't the original hedged version have this problem? If it was fixed, I must have missed it. Please clarify. Here is the version I'm using. I'm pretty sure it has no such fix.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Someone's having a ball here, lol. Keep it up! Mine's been miserable since the Friday rally. The only way out is up...

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Hey Kosmo - It probably does. What I was referring to was a more insidious problem where if I turned off the program it would lose track and close out all the trades, then put the grid back on - usually at a nice loss. I'm still not getting full use of the client terminal global variables. When I turn off my no hedge version now, though, it does retain the original starting equity as it should on restart. I haven't tried that on the one I'm running the regular demo on. BTW that's the version that I'm using to make the changes to. Still have some work to do on the BE stuff, but I think I have it on the run. I'm also putting in the other suggestions from the last few posts. On another vein, I think dambuster is using a tighter grid that we are (I am using your settings for the most part). I did get one cycle to close out today but he had at least 2, lucky dog Oddly enough, the no hedge version failed to close at all, but the settings I have on that put the grid at nearly $1 per level, guess that might be too much.

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Yesteerday, my steady gold was so steady. Hehe @dambuster, how much % equity did u set?

--- 帖子 #640 ---
1%

--- 帖子 #641 ---
@ dambuster - what grid size are you using? Here's a version of the program with a few changes: The Spread, Buffer, and GridStep are all literal and displayed in cents. So a GridStep of 35 will place each trade $0.35 from it's neighbor, for example. Some comment script has been included on how the trades will be initiated on your screen. If you get error 130's, 4107, etc you don't have enough buffer and spread selected for your broker's comfort. There is a flag ("UseTimeToStart"). Leaving this as false will cause the program to start immediately. The biggest change is that the breakeven and targets are displayed in the comment block. These are accurate as far as I can tell. Targets are based on the "Gain Sought" field of the comment block. I knew I'd find a use for those arithmetic series from algebra, lol. Naturally, they are hypothetical and based on the number of existing and potential hedges that will be made, plus hitting the stops exactly on the numbers on a straight line trip to the values shown. That is to say, use them as guides, and as the trade progresses they are probably going to change when the price wanders around. One caveat, they are only really accurate if they lie within the grid, as (for now) the algorithm assumes the grid goes forever. I'll fix this in a later version, but for now it's good inside the grid. If they are outside the grid - they are are most likely too close.

+/- $30 ish depending on spread when EA triggers

@ dgodfrey: thanks for the latest version which I have now started running. Do you know if it has the same issues as the original one viz: Do not change timeframes? Possible random closing of entire cycle whijlst in DD?

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Steady Gold BET just closed a cycle which means I am oficially past the 50% mark (this just in December!!!)

--- 帖子 #645 ---
WOW - What just happened on GOLD! I've just loaded this EA and made 500 in an instant! I am getting many MT4 error 130's on almost all of my buy orders. Does the EA keep trying to open the buy orders? The gap is bigger between buys and sells.

--- 帖子 #646 ---
http://www.kitco.com/images/live/nyg...07787682455684 Excellent!!! ~Dgodfrey...thanks for your updates! I'll wait until we can have a version that places TP and SL at the calculated profit line before downloading and starting a new demo with it. People can test your version to be sure of the math. I don't have time to view my platform on VPS, so I wouldn't be able to observe the comments to see it for myself (sorry). I think it will help us be able to see any improvements we can make to gain an edge. ~Fxtrader08...yes, gold just made a straight up move, great for this EA. The EA will not just keep placing pending orders, it will place the number in the settings. Once all the trades are closed on reaching profit target, the EA will automatically place orders again. The gap is your buffer setting. If it appears big, it's because your broker widened the spread during that big move up, then brought it back down while the EA was placing the orders.

--- 帖子 #647 ---
I didn't change anything in the mechanics except fixed the spread, buffer and gridstep variables to be just what the inputs say. So I guess the same issues are there. The program depends on some client terminal global variables to hold its place, and I was having trouble getting those to work the way I wanted. I'm wondering if they are working as advertised. They are supposed to be semi-permanent, stored on the hard drive on the computer for up to 4 weeks between uses and can be seen by any MT4 program. If all that were true, anyone using more than one copy of this program on different demos would be having some conflicts because one of the first things the program does is wipe out all existing globals - so if you had a first demo running and cranked up another the first would have to reset. All that to say this is definitely a work in progress and not stable. @ fxtrader08 - I'm not even sure what your screen is showing, but those are definitely not the right numbers for BE and Targets. I suspect something in your settings is way off. I would suggest sticking to the defaults on most of the stuff and increasing the buffer and giving it another shot.

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Do you mean 0.30 is distance between orders? Any chance you might post your settings? I thought you had before but I couldn't find them. I know you are triggering more often than I am, just curious about what values you are using.

This is what I was using with the original (post 1) EA: Lots=0.0 LotPercent=1.0 UseBE=false BE=100.0 LockIn=0.0 UseSL=false SL=0.0 Buffer=200 GridStep=200 Slip=50.0 NoOfSteps=30 EquityGainMultiple=10.0 EquityLossMultiple=9999.0 StartingHour=21 StartingMin=56 StoppingHour=21 StoppingMin=55 Now using the Steady Gold BET (dgodfrey modded) with: Lots=0.0 LotPercent=1.0 UseBE=false BE=100.0 LockIn=0.0 UseSL=false SL=0.0 str=Enter Spread, Buffer, GridStep in cents str2=Bid+Spread+Buffer = BuyGrid start str3=Bid-Buffer = SellGrid start str4=GridStep = Distance in cents between trades Spread=200 Buffer=200 GridStep=500 Slip=50.0 NoOfSteps=30 EquityGainMultiple=10 EquityLossMultiple=9999.0 UseTimeToStart=false StartingHour=11 StartingMin=30 StoppingHour=11 StoppingMin=29

--- 帖子 #650 ---
It will be interesting to see how the BET version compares - $5 gridstep per trade! I hadn't thought to make it so wide. It could be that your results are also helped by your good fortune of using a broker with such a low spread, sure wish I could. I'm stuck with the $.50 guys

--- 帖子 #651 ---
The "GridStep=500" gives me a grid with 0.50 intervals. Could be that's because I have a 3 decimal broker (Alpari UK)?

--- 帖子 #652 ---
That is exactly what I meant, as pointed out here . Ok, read your reply to dambuster, all clear now. WOW!! We are REALLY moving forward now, and fast! Thank you, dgodfrey! Very impressed with your skills. Can't wait to test the new version.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
I should still have enough RAM on my VPS to add another tester. I'll set up the BET version exactly the same way as the original and observe, as time permits. Wonder if it'll make much difference with the new 'literal' gap settings (i.e. spread excluded as far as I understood (?)).

--- 帖子 #654 ---
May I join the party? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Just when I thought my case was lost, it comes back fighting in style, lol! Sorry dambuster... it's just over 58% now, with an account set up 10 days later than yours.

--- 帖子 #656 ---
No doubt - guess that will have to be on the list for future improvements I'm in deep drawdown now on my demo while yours is blazing ahead. I'm going to start a demo run on an account using BET with your setting running on my broker just to see the difference the spread makes. I think it's significant.

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Hey Kosmo, no it's not that it's not there - it's just that you set it to a nominal value. Also, it doesn't factor into the step size, that's controlled completely by GridStep. It does factor into the BE and Targets a little, as well as the middle distance between the 2 halves of the grid.

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Hey Kosmo, are you having any trouble with executions on your grid when there are sudden moves? I just looked and the problem is that all my trades are bunching at the same levels - I have 5 of the grid buystops executed within a few cents of each other at 1206.60. That's why I'm not reaping the benefits.

--- 帖子 #659 ---
That also happens to me, but suprise suprise, only on the live account when price rockets... slippage...

--- 帖子 #660 ---
I guess it begs the question then - whose demo is more like trading live? Maybe it's just their way of telling me to not get my hopes up

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Ok, got it, thanks. Following the scary experience from Friday, I have another thought... would it be possible to devise and code in a formula, which will calculate how many pendings are needed on the other side to balance the opposite trades already open, so that when price changes direction from, say, sell to buy (after already having triggered a good portion of sells), and reaches the other side of the box (buy), it'll still hit the target without price 'getting out' of the box? In effect, it'll add pendings to the other side of the box on the go, based on how many opposite trades are already open. I'm sure it'd be a great weapon against getting boxed out, as long as there's margin left, of course.

--- 帖子 #662 ---
Haven't really looked into it, but I guess I'd better do, before going live, lol!

--- 帖子 #663 ---
That's not a bad idea - the mechanism is implicit in the calculation anyway. The algorithm assumes that those orders are there even if they're not. All you would have to do is, if the target is outside the box, have the program fill in the trades at least to the target. Sounds pretty doable. In fact, the program could just use that to build the box on the fly, starting with a small box (and less trades to cancel) and increasing it as required to cover the hedge.

--- 帖子 #664 ---
I do beg your pardon, Sir. This is an understatement! Fantastic! I'll leave the algebra to you then.

--- 帖子 #665 ---
I'll think about how to do what you want there, Pipster. I need to make an improvement in the program anyway, to poll the actual orders and get that value built into the calculation on what BE and Target is. Could pull that all together with building out the box, and have all the open orders set to take profit or stop out at the target.

--- 帖子 #666 ---
And here I thought the British were the masters of understatement

--- 帖子 #667 ---
Don't know about that. I only live here, lol! But my roots are Slavic, hence the creativity... (another lol!).

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Just to be clear, the BET version does calculate based on the current P/L, it's just that it uses the theoretical grid to find what the target and BE value needs to be. I will have to figure out a way to get the open trades worked in there to do an accurate calculation of the target rather the what they should have been doing had they been executed perfectly. Obviously, with all my trades bunched at 1206 instead of marching steadily upwards from 1201 to 1206, not as much will be contributed by those bad fills.

--- 帖子 #669 ---
http://www.kitco.com/images/live/nyg...07787682455684 ~kosmo! Now you see what happens when you're patient! ~dgodfrey...looks like your demo trades more like a live account. Gold can have some slippage when live. I like the idea of starting with a smaller box, (maybe 10 orders?), and growing it. Hopefully doing that doesn't make the math harder. So, with your "BET" version, I could set the grid spaces smaller, since I could override the spread?

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Yes, the spread is no longer part of the grid step calculation. It should give you exactly what you set GridStep to be. Dambuster found that for 3 digit brokers the number needs to be 10x larger than what the 2 digit brokers need. I'll fix that in the next go round. Example: GridStep = 50 gives $0.50 between steps for 2 digit brokers. Gridstep = 500 gives $0.50 between steps for 3 digit brokers. The same logic applies to Spread and Buffer as well.

--- 帖子 #671 ---
... as well as the equity target so mine is set to 10.0 which equates to 1% with my 3 digit broker

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Absolutely, but that's just one side of the coin; the other is believing in your settings.

--- 帖子 #673 ---
End of year musings... is gold heading for $1250 (?)

--- 帖子 #674 ---
@ Kosmo - we can hope! How's this for slippage? Instead of another gain, the %gain has gone from over 20% to just over 8% Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #675 ---
Just watched the BET version sweep past the sell BE prediction, and noticed that it was when the ASK price hit the BE value it was pretty much even money. So that number is off by the broker spread if your chart is only displaying the bid line.

--- 帖子 #676 ---
Ouch! What can be said other than F.XCM is a joke (with all due respect, lol)! Maybe it's time to do some research . They're trying their best there and the site is a good starting point, but some of the info needs to be taken with a pinch of salt and confirmed at the source. Suffice to look at Armada's spread info...

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Good to know. I'll tick the 'show Ask line' in chart properties.

Well it needs to breakout somewhere - hopefully the buy side as I've three trades open (on demo). Seems to be hovering around 1200 at the moment. Coin toss......

--- 帖子 #679 ---
You are right about that. Just went through the list of brokers what I can get a live account with - not exactly encouraging lol. I am going to give IKON a shot, at least their spread is a little tighter (or so they say). The good news is my BET version (probably) cycled, according to where the market is and what the target was at lunchtime. I got a 10% cycle on that account this morning because I had the wrong target - and it got hit anyway I'm back to the more sane target now, and this is the second hit on it at the 1% level. I would link it to an explorer but I seem to have lost the investor password. Guess I'll start it over so I can.

@ dambuster I'm happy for you, sure wish I had access to the London brokers!

--- 帖子 #682 ---
http://www.kitco.com/images/live/nyg...07787682455684 Grief! I didn't even have that kind of slippage when trading live, manually! I'm guessing the broker's server is a long ways away from their liquidity provider, and they are allowing some kind of simulation of order sending. Regular demos have zero slippage because...well, you know.

--- 帖子 #683 ---
@Pipster One thought, given these jerky moves this instrument is capable of: The BE and Target values are based on a projection of hypothetical fills, so if the orders had standing SL's and TP's based on that and the market leaped beyond the projected BE or Target, you could get a nasty surprise when the orders collided, trying to fill then stopping out at once or taking profit at once regardless of the opening price they got. Or part of them wouldn't fill at all given the criteria, while others did and made the situation even worse. I know that in my example chart previous I would have been able to hit a profit cycle, had the fills not been so bad. If I had standing orders for SL's and TP's I might have realized a sizable loss.

--- 帖子 #684 ---
true....how true slippage works live is basically the price moving while the order from your broker is still on its way to the liquidity provider. The best way to beat this is use a broker that has their live server right next to the liquidity provider. Then your orders will beat the others when a pending order is triggered open. For example, if you have $10,000 laying around, if you open a Pro account with Finfx, you get the server that is literally next door to the US Comex floor, and their liquidity provider, so slippage is almost nil with a 0.3 millisecond latency. Plus they have a VPS sitting on the same server you can use, so zero platform to broker latency!

--- 帖子 #685 ---
A VPS provider I used in the past and will most probably use again, has a very handy latency chart , measured from their servers to various brokers. Another option, which I haven't tested yet, but am very tempted to, is the recently launched MT4 VPS hosting service . Quite simply, we're spoilt for choice!

--- 帖子 #686 ---
I'd like to use something like that. I would still have to have a broker for the VPS tho, so I'm open for better than what I have with FXCM . Just watched my BET version clip the buy side BE calculation, that was on the BID line. And I suppose that makes sense, sell on the bid, buy on the ask.

--- 帖子 #687 ---
Hey Kosmo, I got the lines on the chart as you suggested initially. I guess I must have had something I read a long time ago in mind, but drawing objects isn't any big deal from within an EA. It must be setting indicator buffers or something else. Anyway, I'll let it run a bit to see if they move as they should. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I set up the BET version exactly the same way as the original, and discovered that the Spread setting doesn't seem to have any effect on grid spacing. Original setting: GridStep = 40.0 ($0.40) + spread ($0.10) added automatically =&gt; gives grid spacing = $0.50; BET setting: GridStep = 40.0 ($0.40) + Spread = 10.0 ($0.10) =&gt; gives grid spacing = $0.40 (?)

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Does it mean you've managed to make the target calculation take into account the trades already open and update the average on the fly? That would be just perfect!

--- 帖子 #696 ---
Grid steps are literal in the BET version. Just put in the spacing you want in the GridStep variable, and that's what you will get. The first (inside) orders are placed based on the current Bid price, the Spread variable and the Buffer variable. After that GridStep takes over completely. The positioning of the BE and Target lines calculate the hypothetical loss, not the real one. Slippage is not taken into account as yet. I'm going to rework that in the next version in an effort to be able to set SL's and TP's. Most of the time it will be pretty close, but if you get a situation with slippage like I posted on that previous screenshot, it's likely that those lines won't be accurate. Sorry! I'll put up the code then, have to wait for lunchtime, lol. Got my day job to worry about

Thanks for clarifying that. As for the rest, I'm sure we'll get there eventually. Nothing worth having is easy!

Hey dambuster, I think I have this problem solved, as well as some others. Got the orphan trade thing fixed, too, at least I hope so. Testing it now on a couple of platforms from different brokers, no problems so far. I did turn the mt4 off and back on, switched timeframes, opened up the input box and changed things - it stays stable right through all that.

--- 帖子 #703 ---
Hello - thanks for your message. I didn't change any of the settings. Does the attached look right now? Many thanks for your help with this. How mathematically could this EA go wrong? I guess there could be a big range and it could tag each of the buys and sells thus causing heavy DD.

--- 帖子 #704 ---
Excellent, just what the doctoer orderd, thanks!

--- 帖子 #705 ---
WCS = all trades opened = hedged DD of approx. 30% The solution, adding orders to the grid, is being worked on

Hi Pipsters, Here's my trade explorer http://www.forexfactory.com/jstan#67 .

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Dear sir : Test the ver2 SL just not work .... please check or somebody can help me to setup

--- 帖子 #708 ---
Does it appear to be setup correctly based on my chart? Also how much RAM do you think we need for this EA? I ask because it took an awfully long time for my trades to close and the pending orders to be cancelled. I also noticed that the orders are cancelled from the furthest away from the price down to the order close to the price. I am worried that during the process of closing the trades, the price actually touches on one of the pending orders and so this gets opened. What would happen with this trade? I assume the EA wouldn't manage it as the cycle should be closed.

--- 帖子 #709 ---
@ fxtrader08 I found that for certain brokers the time it took to close the trades was much longer than others. Slippage numbers will cause orphan trades at times, that's being fixed but for now setting slippage to 0 should take care of that. The program prioritizes open trades first then pending ones. It has redundancy to try to close the trades left open but only a couple of times. That's also being fixed. @gimin, I'm not around today much, got my day job lol. I'm putting in a lot of error trapping to try to make it easier to do the setup, it varies a lot by broker. I'll try to help tho when I get back. Crazy morning so far in gold. Got a bunch of movement but it was slippage city on my accounts.

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Got one issue with the one I'm testing though - it didn't cycle at all Of course that's not bad because it took out all the sells and the price was out of the box, so the gain was substantial lol. But looks like a little more tweaking is in order.

--- 帖子 #711 ---
I'm almost at 10% DD on a cycle. Would be great have a feature that says stop after this cycle or something. I hope it recovers - it tagged a few sells and is now well on the buy side at the moment but I think it might range a little!

--- 帖子 #712 ---
If you want it to stop after a cyles simply put the start time at say 12.45 and the stop time at 12.46.

--- 帖子 #713 ---
Yeah, ranging is what gold does best

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Thanks - Should it be on M5 or M15 TF? I see some showing it on M5 and some on M15.

--- 帖子 #715 ---
Timeframe is unimportant, just dont change it once the EA starts to trade

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Thanks for the latest version, dgodfrey. I'll load it and see how it goes. For now, some observations as for the first BET release: - timeframe: I had a cycle open and well in the negative on the M5; changed timeframes to higher a few times, and when back to the M5, it closed the cycle in the negative. Once a new cycle opened, I started changing the timeframes again, and this time it was stable. Strange, isn't it? - settings: changing the settings while a cycle is open doesn't cause a closure - restarting the terminal: restarted the terminal while a cycle was open; it didn't close the cycle, but soon after restarting the terminal the target was reached, and then it failed to open a new cycle.

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Just to be clear, the version that will clear up the stability issues hasn't been released yet, it's BET v2.1. For now, just be careful about doing anything that causes the program to re-initialize (turning off MT4, changing parameters, changing timeframes, etc). Those things may cause an inadvertent cycling at a loss. Also, because of the coding in the older versions, it would be best to only run one program on one MT4 platform. Running more than one instance probably will cause conflicts, and the program may cycle randomly. That would be per computer, of course.

--- 帖子 #718 ---
The cycling issue is fixed! So this should work much better. I'll post the code later today when I have some time to explain the changes and the rationale. I've reworked the inputs a good bit. Maybe we can give it a shot next week. It should also account for the different lot sizes between brokers automatically, as well as 3 digit vs 2 digit brokers, so that will be good feedback to get from the group. It's looking good! One interesting thing - I have three accounts running the code and because the price of gold ran away from that low where I started the program, completely beyond the box, profits were over 25%, and that wasn't even at the max. This could be useful to try some swing trades if gold ever gets really moving.

--- 帖子 #719 ---
Over 30% gain today in the test accounts with the new version Just saw it cycle on cue, right when it hit the target line. Nice day in the gold!

--- 帖子 #720 ---
I´m down heavily today....thats the thing with this EA - you cannot compare with eachother because it all depends when you load it up on the chart. None of us will have the same results. I've been caught in the heavy swing up and now the downward turn....... I think the DD needs to be looked at in detail to avoid such high DD. I have 12 buys and 12 sells open.

--- 帖子 #721 ---
That leaves you in a reasonably good position (if you have followed the advice of 0.01 lot per 1000k) Sometimes you need a lot of patience with this method - ThePipster mentioned he had to wait over 10 days for decent breakout before it closed in profit on a recent cycle...

--- 帖子 #722 ---
All the trades have a 0.03 lot size on an account of 2700. One cycled closed earlier at a loss of 200. I don't think the risk reward is good with this system. 200 loss to gain 24 seems too much doesn't it?

--- 帖子 #723 ---
It shouldn't have closed at all, that's the thing. Hopefully this update will stop that kind of thing in the future.

--- 帖子 #724 ---
Lot size is OK but you must read the thread, then you will realise that the EA is still in beta form This means it has some bugs such as cycles closing in loss or problems when changing timeframe or restarting MT4 etc. It's a work in progress which is why ThePipster shared it with us and dgodfrey is doing a stellar job ironing out the kinks

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Well I've burned my fingers! Hopefully the new version can recover what I lost :-)

--- 帖子 #726 ---
http://www.kitco.com/images/live/nyg...07787682455684 Don't worry about the DD...it is normal for this EA. You just have to be patient for price to move far enough to profit. You may go a week without seeing trades closed, if the market is flat.

--- 帖子 #727 ---
Here's the new release. Because of the issue of the arbitrary shutdowns and not being able to do normal things without messing it up, I would advise you all to try this version. It's my hope that all those stability problems are fixed. Please read the explanation carefully. There are some important changes. Attached Image The variables: TradeAmount : The percentage of your account balance to trade in dollars. The program uses this to calculate the correct lot size for your boroker. This should work regardless of what your broker calls 1 lot. Example: $1000 account, you want to make the trade size $1, then put 0.1 here, 1/1000 of your account. This will scale with your balance, so it is naturally going to compound. You can adjust it as needed. NOTE: If you put in a value that results in a lot size less than what your broker allows, the program will correct your entry to the lowest amount allowable. Another NOTE: The compounding occurs in $1000 steps, i.e. your balance rounded down to the nearest $1000. Unique: This is what should fix the stability issues. Unique is used to identify this instance of this program running on this computer. You need to put in a number you can remember to assign a unique global variable to your computer's memory which stores the beginning balance at grid initiation. You can use this program on as many MT4 platforms on a computer as you want (I have 5 going right now) to check brokers, inputs, etc. Just make sure each one has a different unique number. And don't forget it in case you have to restart it for some reason. The program can then be turned off, timeframes changed, all that stuff without danger of resetting the beginning balance figure and taking a loss, or for corrupting another instance of the program running on the same computer, causing it to recycle unexpectedly. Spread, Buffer and Gridstep: Enter in cents. Even if you have a 3 digit broker, the program will correct for that and give the proper steps. UseSlippage : Setting this to false will make market orders of your trades, and you will get the fill on exit that you get, regardless of what the price is by the time the trade clears. Leaving false here avoids orphans, because the program will redundantly search for orphans until all the trades are closed. If you set this to true and the value in slippage will not allow the trade to be executed, you'll get an alert that the grid is corrupted and you'll see the orphaned trades. Just be aware in a fast market market orders might help or hurt a lot. Of course, being stuck in some trades on the wrong side of a runaway market isn't going to feel too great either if you use slippage, and the program won't run again until all the trades in the ending cycle are closed. Target : Enter the percentage of your account you want for a target gain. Example: Target=1 will set a target of $10 on a $1000 account. UseTimeToStart : Set this flag to true to stop and start at specified times given below the flag, or to false to ignore the time settings. And that's all for now. I'm going to try to make a dynamic grid in the next version that will reach out to the BE and Target lines if necessary. As you can see here: Attached Image (click to enlarge) only a few more buys and my BE and Target on the sell side will be beyond the grid, and also will be inaccurate if the grid isn't present. I'll also work in the actual P/L so the numbers will be more accurate.

--- 帖子 #729 ---
Outstanding work dgodfrey, thanks!

--- 帖子 #730 ---
dgodfrey, are the attached image is your current settings?

--- 帖子 #731 ---
Just looking at the settngs, has the option to trade fixed lot sizes really been removed?

--- 帖子 #732 ---
Yes, other than the unique number, but those are just some settings. Spread should be reflective of what your broker's spread really is. Buffer is just where you want the grid to start, it could be small for close up to the current price, or large if you want more wiggle room. GridStep can be anything, just try stuff to see what has the best effect. I should say that a couple of the big gains were because I was doing testing and the trades didn't close on target, but ran away in my favor and I closed them manually. In my first demo I had the target set at 10% of the account balance by mistake and made over 100% gain in a day. But then I got boxed in during volatility and gave most of it back. Getting in a hedge box is easy if your target is too large, but too large is relative to GridStep and the number of steps and a lot of things. I think experimenting with a wide range of settings would be instructive, on demo accounts of course. I did I can see how I should have left that, I'll put it back in the next release. I was just trying to simplify the differences in brokers and what lots are for each. Guess that's my own biases creeping in. I like compounding. I'll put it back in and post the new version this weekend. Sorry!

--- 帖子 #733 ---
Here's a version with fixed lot size if you want to go that route. This release is identical to 2.1 except for this minor change. Be aware that if you use a fixed lot size less than the broker allows this program will set it to the minimum.

--- 帖子 #735 ---
No problem Shouldn't have taken it out in the first place lol. One thing I noticed, there's a code remnant that will cause an alert box and reset if you make the TradeAmount = 0. Even if you use fixed lots, leave a value in TradeAmount. It will be ignored.

--- 帖子 #736 ---
Thank you for the updates, dgodfrey! You've managed to contribute so much in such a short time. Can't wait until tomorrow to see the latest version working. Not to mention the dynamic grid - when it arrives, it will be pure fun to watch!

--- 帖子 #737 ---
A similar idea has been hovering in my mind for some time now. Not to say we should try and push things too far, too fast, but it's surely something to bear in mind until we're sure the EA is perfectly stable and bug-free. The next step could be to try and apply some optional (indicator based) add-on triggers, which would activate the EA (or notify the trader) only when the market is at its extremes. Of course, anything indicator based will only be approximate, but with the use of manual confirmation, there's always room for discretion to pinpoint the entry. In effect, the scale-in grid will become a very precise sniper, with minimal DD. By adjusting grid spacing to the timeframe, it'd be up to the trader, whether to use it for day- or swing trading.

--- 帖子 #738 ---
Mulling over the numbers today I came up with some analysis of what we're doing here. Just for your information. An interesting thing is that one effect of a constantly growing grid is that the returns are exponential in nature. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Assume that the grid spacing is set to $0.50 and the amount traded is $10 on a $10k account (0.1 lots for 1lot=$100 brokers). A move either way of only 5 grid steps will hit a 1% target, ie $3.00 away from the origin, assuming there is a $1.00 buffer from the bid when it was started and no hedging took place. Sounds good. But you will reach 2% gain before you get to the 8th step, and a 10% gain is reached in just over 18 steps. The growth of your return is exponential. Make the same assumption, and do a grid with the setting at $0.30 steps. Now, to get a 1% return you will have to move about 6 steps, but that's only about $2.50 from the origin because the steps are smaller. W00T! No brainer, you think. Here's the catch. Your box is much smaller, around $20 top to bottom, with 30 cent steps. With the step size at 50 cents its about $30 top to bottom. The smaller step size is much more likely to build a boxed hedge. The closer steps will also build an inside hedge loss faster in a sideways market as the price wiggles around. With the steps closer together you're going to get that hedge loss going faster. And one other caveat that came up from this: The bigger the step, the bigger the DD if you get boxed. You need to consider that risk. Early on Pipster told us the risk of loss building a perfect box hedge was 30% DD, BUT that's with 0.30 as the step size. (Actually with the above scenario and a $1 dollar buffer it's around 32% for 30 cent steps) But if you increase the step size to $0.50, that same max DD figure goes to almost 50%! Rule of thumb: step size, in cents, is roughly equivalent to the percent DD if the hedge you build with it is boxed perfectly @ 30 steps. And yes, it does get almost to complete DD when the step size is $1.00, a 100% DD. Of course by that time your hedge is $60+ from top to bottom, so what's the likelihood of that? Upshot: Smaller stepsize: easier to get to the target, easier to build hedge loss in sideways markets, easier to build a max DD boxed hedge, less risk if you do. Larger stepsize: harder to get to the target, harder to build hedge loss in sideways markets, harder to build a max DD hedged box, more risk if you do. And we may be shorting ourselves by making the targets too small. There is probably some optimal range of numbers - lets find them

--- 帖子 #739 ---
I was observing this same thing, Kosmo. How nicely you take profits originating at the pivots in price, how miserable it is in the middle of that range. There must be something we could do about that. I got creamed during that Yellen announcement, made a perfect boxed hedge. At either end of it I would have been golden.

--- 帖子 #740 ---
Another thought, weekend gaps where you might have the following scenario: Friday night close You entered at $1995 with $0.50 gridsteps earlier in the day so you have a grid going from $1980 to $1210 Price had moved from $1995 to $1998 and you picked up 6 buys Price had also moved from $1995 to $1993 so you have 4 sells Market closes at $1997 Market opens with a gap down to $1985 and 16 sell stops all get triggered at that price Market then reverses back up Ouch...

--- 帖子 #741 ---
I'm thinking along the lines of an auto-grid. When you start it the grid will build to one step beyond your target, and fill in when the target moves due to hedging. That way there won't be nearly so many trades to close and it should be much more nimble No need to declare how many steps, it will be on auto.

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Yeah, and another thing about that: Watch out around holidays! Ikon opened at 1AM GMT, while FXCM didn't open until 6AM GMT on Friday, with the market already moving for hours! Talk about getting hosed on the gap! FXCM showed a 50 pip gap on EURUSD while the other brokers had no gap at all.

--- 帖子 #743 ---
Hmmm, dynamic grid should reduce that risk dramatically

--- 帖子 #744 ---
Yeah, a gap without the buy or sell stops present would just adjust the target and fill in the possible grid from the current point. It might get messy though. Like, you have the hedge out to the target 6 steps away on the sell side ~$3 away and the market closes. When it opens it's $6 away and none of the trades that made the target possible at that level are executed, instead they all go off at the new price. Now you have a big hole in the grid $6 wide, and what goes there? What happens if the buys and sells overlap? Like you had 3 executed sells and the price gaps down leaving a hole. Do you fill in the hole with buystops to the new buy target, which will mean buystops below the open sell orders? Hmmmmm

--- 帖子 #745 ---
Wouldn't you have to add more pending sells as well in case it touches on those new buys and goes down further putting those buys into a loss position - I think without further pending sells - you wouldn't reach your profit target. I think we need to have the same amount of pending buys and sells to make this strategy work....not sure though! Just throwing it out there

--- 帖子 #746 ---
Well, you only ever need as many as it takes to reach the target, but the target moves. Gaps, slippage and hedging will make it move, sometimes a lot. In that gap down, the slippage would push the sell target away, and the sell stops you mention would be put in place to reach the sell target (unless you got lucky and the new price put the gain beyond the new sell target value). The buy target would be pushed out as well, but perhaps to a different amount, and the buy stops would fill in the intervening gap. There will be a different number of them, but only enough to reach the long or short targets

--- 帖子 #747 ---
That would be a huge step forward. An intelligent grid! Now that dambuster scared everyone with gaps (lol), we've got some serious thinking to do... maybe something along the lines of laying a fresh cycle over the one in trouble (but starting at the current price), so that the new one keeps beefing up the balance until the bad one is leveled out. It's adding more risk, as it'd burden the margin, but some of the open trades could actually get 'double hedged' that way... (?) Just brainstorming here.

--- 帖子 #748 ---
Thanks for the analysis, dgodfrey. Very succinct and a great reference point for any setting adjustments.

--- 帖子 #749 ---
It would require a bigger account size for sure and how many cycles could you have open at one time? I dont think very many if you're the average Joe with a small account. Two, maybe three. If its already 0.01 per $1000.....

--- 帖子 #750 ---
While working on the next version, I came across another potential issue. There may be a conflict if you are running two instances of this program using the same broker on the same demo server. If you do and get trades closed down out of the blue, it could be that. The fix is easy but in the meantime, try not to set up your demos that way. Dont use the same demo server from the same broker to run more than one copy. Otherwise no troubles. May not be a problem anyway, but better safe than sorry. I'm assuming there's no cowboys out there running two live versions from one broker on the same live server

--- 帖子 #751 ---
Burning the late night oil, I guess I'll regret this in the morning Anyway, here's a thought. Kosmo and I were thinking of catching this movement at likely pivots using indicators, but when I put up a Choros indi (which just puts horizontal lines on the screen at regular intervals), look what pops out at the $10 grid level on the 1H chart. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The idea would be to trigger a new grid at the $10 bands, like at the white dots on the chart. You can see how the price often blows through those or bounces off them completely. If you had a profit at that level, regardless of whether it was what your target was or not, close out and restart. I'm not saying to take a loss, if it's not profitable just keep going to the next band. Going back to my earlier post about targets and exponential gain, a $10 move without hedge loss would be worth over 10% trading 0.1% per trade at $0.50 grid spacing. Surely 3% wouldn't be too much to ask then, assuming you did have some hedge loss to overcome. Like I said, anyway, I'd take it whatever the gain was off the table and reinitiate the grid at the $10 band when the price got there. Of course, the EA could handle all that if it was set up to do it. By the way, here are the Choros files if you want them. The points are set up for 5 digit, so I think if you use 200 gridspace with 100 band it gives you the $10 spacing.

--- 帖子 #752 ---
Another thought, would closing all pending orders 5 mins before market close and then reopen them when the market opens avoid a possible black swan event? The EA would need inputs such as DayOfClose, HourOfClose, MinuteOfClose and then similar imputs for market reopen Just a 2 cents thought...

--- 帖子 #753 ---
Thats already in there except for the day of close. The "UseTimeToTrade" function could be modified for that, But what would you do at the market open if it did the big gap? Deleting trades out of the gap manually would mess things up, but I guess it would be better than them all going off at once. I guess you would also need a variable for day of open as well.

--- 帖子 #754 ---
I don't think that the UseTimeToTrade would close pending orders? So, the vraiables would need to be: DayOfClose HourOfClose MinuteOfClose To close all pending orders and then: DayOfOpen HourOfOpen MinuteOfOpen for it to reopen all previously closed pendings as long as the market hasn't gapped?

--- 帖子 #755 ---
I see what you're saying now. I was thinking of it wrong. Yeah, that would work. Also, you see that big gap in the chart around Christmas? That's FXCM's feed through ATC. But they didn't open back up until 08:00 GMT on the 26th. Ikon's chart shows they opened at 01:00 GMT. And Ikon has a $3.50 gap while FXCM has an $11.50 gap. Nothing like making a bad situation worse. More to the point, if you close out all the pendings and not the open orders, you are exposed to the unhedged trades. For each unhedged trade you had, assuming 0.1% on your trades as exposure, you would either make or lose 1.15% of your account on that FXCM gap. That could add up pretty quick. Maybe the prudent thing to do would be to hedge the unhedged trades and lift the hedges you put on when you open, assuming you had any. It would cost you the spread on as many trades as you hedged, but that's just like insurance.

--- 帖子 #756 ---
That sounds like a plan

--- 帖子 #757 ---
Hello - I got a message on v2.11 which says the "Grid is corrupted". This was at the point of closing a profitable grid. It left a huge numbrt of sells open which I closed manually. Only difference from the default settings is I set slippage to 0 and true.

--- 帖子 #758 ---
That's why it was corrupted. Your broker was unable to close the orders without slippage so it left orphan trades

--- 帖子 #759 ---
Just like spyderman says The program won't try to close trades that the broker rejects due to slippage if you have that protection turned on.

--- 帖子 #760 ---
Got two quick closes, nice way to start

--- 帖子 #761 ---
Quiet night after that rowdy open on the currencies. Talk about abusive. Some big boys went out gathering stops in a major way. I was looking at one of my platforms and noticed that I was flirting with getting my target, but just not quite. Attached Image (click to enlarge) But check out the BE line on the sell side- could that be right?! So I set up an analysis of hedge loss and what it does to the BE line, and by inference to the target line. Here's what I found: For every opposition open trade created in a move (Buy vs Sell in my case) a potential hedge is made if the market reverses. If the market went down from here for whatever reason, every one of those buys would get hedged out, and until I ran past the level where there weren't any more to hedge, I wouldn't stop losing money. And I only pick up speed making up for all that hedge loss after moving a while. What the charts told me was that BE was uniformly about 2.5 steps farther away for every hedge that got made. That's regardless of step size. I have 11 buys opened so that means I'll have to move around 27-28 steps into the sell zone before I hit BE. Just what the chart shows. At that range the target comes pretty quickly, but still, that's a lot of movement just to get on even ground. And should it just barely miss - lets say it only goes 20 steps into the sell side and then comes back out - well then I've got to have a 50 step move to the upside to make any money. Bummer. So what about step size? Well, consider a $5.00 move that for some reason doesn't cycle. Maybe you've already got some hedging going on, whatever. That $5 move is about 9-10 steps on a $0.5 step size, it's more like 16-17 steps for a $0.30 step size. If it reverses and goes the other way, you'll hit BE around 23-25 steps away on the $0.5 grid, but now you've got to go around 40 steps on your $0.3 grid setup. 24 steps is $12 on the $0.5 grid. 40 steps on the $0.30 grid is also $12......but you're way out of the box now on the $0.30 grid, 30 steps is not enough. Plus you are carrying around 24 open unhedged trades on the $0.30 grid compared to 14 open unhedged trades for the $0.50 grid on the way to BE. The larger grid is a lot more conservative from the standpoint of margin. I did try a $1.00 grid - it was the same. A $5.00 move eats up 5 hedges if it reverses, will need to go to around $12 on the reverse, but you'll only have 7 unhedged open trades exposure. So there you go. A move of $x away from inner grid that doesn't cycle takes about the same $2.5x move the other way to BE no matter which grid spacing you use, but you'll have a lot more money on the line with the smaller grid size. And have a lot more risk of building a hedged box in 30 steps. There is one advantage revealed by the charts for the smaller grid spacing - targets come quicker. An unhedged move of $3 or so will clip a $200 profit with the $0.30 grid, but you have to move over $6 to get $200 from the $1.00 grid. Here are the charts in a zip if you are interested. They've got the P/L lines for 1 through 10 hedges for various grids. Attached File(s) Hedge Charts.zip 350 KB | 301 downloads

So essentially your saying this current grid I have open will never be profitable? I now have 20 sells open and 18 buys open and price is on the buy side with heavy DD. Double what I had on Friday. Should I just take the hit now? It looks your article is saying I need to have a grid which reaches 50 levels on the buy side to work out profitable?

Too late - Just topped up my account with more capital - Guess what happened? IT CLOSED ALL OF MY TRADES AT A LOSS.

--- 帖子 #764 ---
I sure hope you're not trading live! Its been stated numerous times that this is a work in process. I dont know why it would have cycled, maybe it read the infusion of capital as a profit. I'll try to model that, if I can figure out how to add capital to a demo. Be careful! We're all trying to figure this out but we're not exactly getting paid for it.

Small issue with one of my Brokers on BET V2.11 It calculated .85 for the lot size but broker wouldn't except the .05. I changed manually to .80 and it took off. So don't know if others had challenge with lot size rounding or if it's just my broker (ForexBroker Inc.)

http://www.kitco.com/images/live/nyg...07787682455684 ~dgodfrey...you're using your thinking cap, now! I think you coding those lines has helped you visualize the components of the system, and how changing variables can change the outcome. Now, the answer to the gridlevel size is about how much free margin the account has compared to how far gold has to move (how many positions has to open) to hit profit. You may be on to something with your $10 entry area idea. I've tried different timings, like starting the EA right before a news release. Sometimes it works, sometimes it's like the last FOMC. The thing is price can rake in the profit when there isn't any scheduled news. (again, like the day before FOMC). There is also a balance of how much profit to take, as sometimes getting more closures at lesser percentage wins more $$$ than 1 big closure. Keep thinking!

--- 帖子 #767 ---
This is brilliant! Psychological levels trading (or round numbers if you like). Now that you came forward with this simple idea, I start thinking that maybe we'd just be waisting time trying to find the right indicator, when all we need is a good reversal point and some momentum to get us to the target in as few steps as possible. What else could be more effective than the good old PA trading: previous swing high/low, supply/demand zones, daily pivot points, support/resistance, and last but not least, the round numbers. As for momentum, I was thinking about ATR(14). When it goes above $1 on the M5, nice moves happen. This alone could be an effective trigger for the EA. I'd love to test the $10 bands idea, if you're willing to code it.

--- 帖子 #768 ---
I'll check that then and try to fix it. It sounds like a rounding issue. I'm not sure what they've got going on, should be easy to take care of tho. I'm going to run an account at the higher grid spaces to see if I can hit that 1% more without getting so boxed in with losses. Since the charts show that the movement in quantities of $10 bands are there, we should be able to take advantage more of the bigger moves and not get boxed in so easily. I'm running FinFX side by side with FXCM , and the FinFX is doing much better because it's not showing the slippage that FXCM does. FXCM is exaggerating slippage I think. But I think FinFX may be minimizing it. I do have that in the works, I was trying to get it to go last night but it kept immediately closing out the trades as they were created lol. Soon tho, as a side release to see how it compares.

--- 帖子 #769 ---
I understand that the dynamic grid will make sure that we don't run out of steps (as long as margin allows). From what you write I gather that maybe wider spacing combined with smaller targets is the way to. It wouldn't trade as often, but when it does, there's higher probability of reaching the target in fewer steps. As we collect more data through testing (the average no. of steps to target), we could then try optimising the risk, since wider spacing isn't as demanding for margin. I'm pretty sure that's what the case may be for the $10 bands. Say, 1% risk/$1 move, and a target of 3% shouldn't be out of reach...

--- 帖子 #770 ---
Fantastic! Thank you!

--- 帖子 #771 ---
I do like the idea of using the ATR for this, but have you noticed how gold lurches in price? It just sort of hops to new levels skipping lightly over prices on the way. It almost behaves as a thin market, but that's kind of hard to believe. So a couple of issues - would the ATR lag the move too much, getting you in after the lurch is over? And what would it be like to initiate the grid in the midst of such a move? I did notice one thing that happens I'd like to change. When the EA cycles it wipes out the open orders first before tackling the pending ones. That makes sense. But when it starts closing the pending orders it starts closing the ones farthest from the bid first, buy stops and sell stops. That leaves the opportunity in a moving market for some of the pending ones on the inside to be triggered, and that will lose you money because they're just going to get closed immediately after. Guess that goes on the list, lol. I agree. With it being an open ended question as to how many trades you'll have open at any time in a dynamic grid I think Kosmo's observation about small targets and larger grid sizes makes sense. Don't want to burn up all the firewood on the first cold day

BET v2.11: changing the NoOfSteps caused a running cycle to close in the negative; it does remain stable when any other setting is changed as well as when restarting the terminal and changing timeframes.

--- 帖子 #773 ---
Ok then. I didn't try that scenario when I was testing it. I'll have to see why that happens. It might be that it messes up the calculation on running profit somehow. There's also FXTrader's observation that changing the account balance with a deposit will cause it to cycle.

--- 帖子 #774 ---
Have noticed it too. In a fast moving market, it can either work to our advantage or just as easily bite into the profit if price retraces fast. Great news that you're going to fix it!

--- 帖子 #775 ---
http://www.forexfactory.com/cescof/68 this trade explorer has gaps over $2. You can see it hasn't closed trades in over 3 weeks. Those are probably too high of gaps. The most ideal is to have the smallest lot size, the closest gaps, the smallest profit that won't slip into negative while trades are closing, and the grid with the highest number of possible orders, which can be placed as pending when they are needed only. The compromise goal is seeing how much each of these would have to be increased to make the most money without a margin call.

--- 帖子 #776 ---
So..... it's worth thinking about this. A hedged trade is exactly the same to a broker as a loss against your account, even if you haven't closed it out. You don't want the drawdown to go too far or you'll get shut down for that, even if you haven't realized the loss by closing the trades. Many brokers release the margin on hedged trades. But they're not going to let you take an unrealized loss bigger than your account, of course. My point is that margin is more likely to be limited by drawdown than anything else. So what is the number of steps in the box past which the unrealized loss gets too high? Here's an analysis of gridspace and how many hedged trades you have to make in the box to reach 100% drawdown. And how big of a box that hedged box would occupy, in dollars. Attached Image The number of steps is for one side of the box, think of it as hedged pairs. This is also for 0.1 lots, or 0.1% of the balance per trade, double that per pair. $1 inside buffer. As you can see, the smaller the gridstep, the more steps it takes. But also it takes a smaller box, in dollars, to get you blown out. What looks reasonable given how gold moves? I guess we'll have to figure that out. I think at some point you're going to run into a situation where you'll have to pull the plug and start over, and probably more often with the smaller grid space.

--- 帖子 #777 ---
My vote is 0.50 or 0.60. However, the entry point does make a difference, too. This isn't an idea that can be turned into a risk\reward scenario. That is strictly for directional trading. This is a bit of a statistical play on inevitability. There has to be some DD to get the win out. The DD is always going to float more negative than we could reasonably place a profit target.

--- 帖子 #778 ---
Ok, so here is the price grid version. There are some corrections in it to other things as well. Attached Image Price Grid = dollar step distance in price that the grid will trigger on. 10=$10 round number price grid: 1190, 1200, 1210, etc. Sensitivity = a window above and below the price grid level in cents that either the bid or the ask has to be inside of to trigger the grid. For example, with sensitivity set to 40 and the price grid trying to trigger at the $1200 level, when the bid is between 1199.60 and 1199.99 or the ask is below 1200.40 down to 1200.00 the grid will trigger. Just be aware that if you have a number here less than your spread, the bid may be outside the sensitivity window when the ask triggers it. MinGridGain : This is how much in dollars that will recycle the EA when it reaches the PriceGrid level, even if the profit is less than the target. If you don't want it to cycle here, put in a ridiculously high number and do back flips if you get hit. Also addressed: Trades are closed from inside out on recycle, instead of outside in. From spyderman's issue, the EA will round the lot size to the nearest size the broker will accept below the number it was trying for. The EA is based on version 2.1 and 2.11. All the other settings there apply here. You can still use this version without the Price Grid, just like 2.11, by making the Sensitivity window exceed 1/2 the distance from band to band in the price grid. That would cause the bid or the ask to always be in the window. Let me know if there are issues. It's not been tested a whole lot, but it seems to work. USE VERSION v1 below- sorry folks, had a bug where it wouldn't work with Sensitivity less than 100. Like I said, didn't run this one much. I'll try not to be so quick next time

--- 帖子 #779 ---
I tried to replicate this and I couldn't. I put in different values and it reinitialized (as evidenced by the lines disappearing and the comment block going away) but it came back on fine, no cycling. If you have it on an account you aren't tracking, could you try again to see if you still have the problem?

--- 帖子 #780 ---
To those who downloeaded the version above, I'm sorry about that. I was testing it with a wide window and didn't see that it wouldn't open with the sensitivity less than 100. Wrong data type and a silly error I still haven't seen it recycle with a small profit at a price grid level, so this one is definitely in the beta phase. I watched this one initiate a grid at Sensitivity = 50. Also, this one adds a feature that draws a vertical line on the price bar where the grid is initiated. Makes it easier to see when it started.

Thanks for all your hard work dgodfrey and others. I had BET 2.11 going along pretty nice then woke up to a closure with 7% loss. Not sure what happened there. Was running on VPS so don't think that should be a problem.

--- 帖子 #782 ---
http://www.kitco.com/images/live/nyg...07787682455684 ~dgodfrey....cool! Thanks for your refinements, it will be interesting to see results of starting it at certain handles.

--- 帖子 #783 ---
Not sure what that would be, either. I've got it running on 3 platforms and it's been stable. If you can figure out what caused it let me know. Make sure about the unique number, but even that wouldn't be an issue if you're running only one copy. The EA stores the beginning balance in the computer's memory as persistent (4 weeks) data, so you can stop and reset the EA without killing it. I wonder if the VPS messes with that variable somehow? I wouldn't think so, and besides, you probably didn't try to do anything to it anyway in the scenario you just mentioned.

--- 帖子 #784 ---
Yeah, for sure. What I've done is set the percentage on my copy out there to 5 running at 0.75 gridspace - 5 puts the target line just at the next price band if there are no hedges. Then I set my MinGainGrid to $50 and let it go. That will get me 5% in a perfect move and whatever less than that at a profit if there is one. If there's no profit to be had it will just keep going. Just doing some alternative thinking about bouncing between the $10 lines. Also, be careful about setting the sensitivity too low, if the market is blowing through the price band the prices could just skip a skinny window all together, I suppose, and leave you on the sidelines watching it run. I'm trying mine on 50 now.

--- 帖子 #785 ---
Hi dgodfrey just trying your new £10 grid ea, when i first loaded it it opened a load of pending trades with green lines and then started trading which drew yellow lines on the screen and then it closed all trades in profit but didn't start a new cycle could you post a screen shot of your working just to see if i have the same test settings or could i have your settings

--- 帖子 #786 ---
That version is working correctly then. It only triggers at the even $10 levels, so it won't restart til it sees one. The other version (2.11) will restart right away. I'll post my settings when I get home but check out the thread for better info

--- 帖子 #787 ---
This scenario is perfect if we could make the EA to activate only on turning points or strong continuation breakouts, when we could grab as much as possible of the move and then stop until next such opportunity, isn't it? Otherwise, we're in the game of balancing the spacing and targets in order to avoid being boxed out between breakouts.

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Another useful analysis. Thank you, dgodfrey. Looks like with my 0.5 spacing and 40 steps, I could only add another 4 steps before the risk gets to 100%! And yet, it's already been in deep DD twice, and somehow managed to recover (today included). What's more, the TE shows only 30% max DD, while myfxbook nearly 37% (?) As strange as it may seem, such overall DD is more than acceptable.

--- 帖子 #789 ---
Very true...but if we could figure that out perfectly, we would actually be better off just directional trading, IMO. The entry is always the nemesis.

--- 帖子 #790 ---
Yes, I am still in the move from 1210 because it had those sell trades going off while it wallowed around at that level. Picked up 6 sells at 0.75 Gridstep to hedge out and that pushed BE past the 1220 line. Unless it keeps going it might get nasty.

--- 帖子 #791 ---
Yep, I confirm it did it again, but only when I changed to a higher no. of steps. When changing to lower, it remains stable and reinitializes fine, without cycling.

--- 帖子 #792 ---
That recovery is great, but I wouldn't think that you could always count on that. In my analysis, I was looking at what was possible. In this situation I'm in now Attached Image (click to enlarge) it's not that I'm in bad shape. A little bull flag building on a strong runup to 1220 makes it look like it might continue. But those DD numbers I was talking about were speculating about loading up on buys, and then the market reversing and heading down from here. Check out my sell side BE. To get there I'm going to be drawing down a pretty good bit. If the market stops short on the downside, too, and heads back up I might get that 100% DD before I get a recovery stroke, because the range to recover will become larger and larger. I guess anything is possible. I don't want that one time you don't get the recovery to cost the whole account. I'm going to snug up my target closer to BE and hope for the best.

--- 帖子 #793 ---
I'll take another look at it then. I was changing the number of steps from 30 to 36 and not triggering it, I know for sure. I'll look at other higher numbers and see if I can make it happen.

--- 帖子 #794 ---
WOW! You're spoiling us, lol. Thank you for the new toy. I'll load it today and will report back if anything's wrong. And no need to apologise - we'd be nowhere without you! Could you please explain how MinGridGain works? Didn't quite understand...

--- 帖子 #795 ---
What it does is set a threshold low number that will trigger a cycle when it gets to a round number. Example: You have a Target of 2%=$200 on your $10k account. The price reaches a new round number and the P/L just happens to be $30 at that moment. If you had the MinGridGain = 20, the EA should close out and cycle there to make a new grid at that price level. The idea is one of S/R. Those levels are the likely reversal points, so why ride a small profit into a big loss if the market reverses, instead of making money off the reverse? I have mine set on 50, but then I have my Profit set on 5% too lol. I'm just testing what might be possible to get.

--- 帖子 #796 ---
Here's what I'm using on $10 Gold Attached Image These are awfully ambitious on Target, mainly because I wanted to test MinGridGain recycling and to test an idea with perfect runs. 75 the GridStep is pretty wide, compared to what others are using. On the other demo I have this on 50.

--- 帖子 #797 ---
Absolutely. After mine had triggered all buys, it was still well in the negative. Had it been a live account, and had I not have anticipated continuation up, that's where I would pull the plug out.

Thanks. On to testing.

Just a quick glance at where we are. H4 chart. After a successful retest of the $1175-1170 zone, looks like we're back in the channel. If it finds support on the lower trendline, $1250 might be on the cards sometime soon...

http://www.kitco.com/images/live/nyg...07787682455684 ~dgodfrey I was looking at your V1 explorer and it seems it hasn't had a first cycle, is this correct? Or did the first round net a loss?

--- 帖子 #804 ---
It hasn't cycled yet. I was trying it on 5% target to see if the MinGridGain function worked, and it missed the mark a little ($-60) so it's still on the first cycle.

--- 帖子 #805 ---
Slow night on the thread, guess most of us are in drawdown while the market is back at the 1210-ish level. Anyway, here's my $10 grid image and some thoughts on maybe how to handle this particular version of the program. Took most of this post down. It's tedious and hard to follow, so I'll try to put it up in a more succinct form later today.

--- 帖子 #806 ---
I like your idea. So, you're saying close all un-hedged, positive $$$ trades every $10? And close enough hedged trades to net a profit, leaving open the other hedged trades? Your idea may be a good compromise to try to take some trades off the market at profit, while setting up the next move to have some meaning, instead of just a retrace on already opened trades.

--- 帖子 #807 ---
Yeah, every trip $10 away nets some positive trades and usually a few hedges. Use whatever's positive to pay for as many of the hedges as you can with the profit, or all of them if that's the case. Don't realize a loss, just reset the hedge at the next level and let it go to the next $10, netting another batch of positive trades. That way you take all the profits off the table when they are still profits and before they become hedges themselves on a reversal in the market. Just trying to see how we can keep the number of hedges down to keep from eating up the accounts. I'll post the details in a better fashion this evening.

--- 帖子 #808 ---
Here's another enthusiast of the idea. Who could possibly complain to work with a bot that has intelligent, proactive and preventive MM built in!

--- 帖子 #809 ---
What you also may want to watch out for is if it starts looking like just a standard grid, it won't work. A standard grid being, for example, buy and sell orders every $10. When price goes straight for $80, it loses huge. I don't think that would be a problem if you're just trying to net a profit, but leaving orders open if profit cannot be obtained.

--- 帖子 #810 ---
I think the difference here is the reset, there are buy stops and sell stops always available on reset at each $10 level. A straight line move would only be adding trades that favored that direction, whatever the direction was. You wouldn't be adding contra trades except in volatility around the $10 levels, which would be hedged off immediately once the move continued, and hopefully resolved at each $10 level as it continued.

--- 帖子 #811 ---
Two observations for the $10 grid: - draws the vertical line on the first cycle only; no lines for subsequent cycles; - when closing a cycle, it closes open trades first, which is just as it should be, but then closes the pendings outside in, not inside out.

--- 帖子 #812 ---
.....

--- 帖子 #813 ---
I think I've got those issues fixed in the next version already. I'd like to wait on getting this next change in place and release it all at one time if possible. A Note: I'll release it under a different version. But if you rename it to the old version and import the language file into metaeditor, you should be able to compile it on the fly and not effect your current grid. I recompile a lot while writing code to try out and it doesn't reset things. It will overwrite the old version, though. You'll just have the one renamed one on your program at that point.

--- 帖子 #814 ---
Sounds perfect, many thanks!

--- 帖子 #815 ---
So, to recap, here's the idea once again: To reset the grid every $10, closing all unhedged open orders (all will be at a profit), use the money from the gain to pay down your hedge debt, or pay it off completely. Don't spend more money on hedge debt than the profit from closing the unhedged orders netted you. Start fresh with a new grid and hope for a clean run and no hedges, which pays off handsomely. Here's a worksheet excerpt to show what's possible. There are choices to make. Attached Image (click to enlarge) These scenarios are for GridSteps of 30, 50, and 75 for comparison. The Gain No Hedging column is what a clean run between 2 $10 bands would net, with some loss possible due to spread. As you can see, grid step 30 pays off at over 13% assuming 0.1 lots, and that's because there are 27 steps along the way, so you're carrying 2.7 lots assuming 0.1 each. Higher settings pay less because there are less trades paying out. For when the volatility around the $10 line ranges out to $5 on either side of the line before proceeding, the $1 Buffer vs the $3 Buffer is this - no trades are set closer than $1 away from the $10 line, or $3 away in the $3 case. As you can see, the returns diminish with a $3 buffer, but the payoff is in the net when you do have hedging - the $3 buffer will always carry less hedge loss - there are always less trades to hit in volatility. This also assumes that no buystop/sellstop trades will be placed within a $1 band around the target $10 line. There's no point in picking up trades that close to the target. The two main columns to look at are the Gain No Hedging and the Net Profit/Hedges. The last assumes that the market moved just shy of $5 against you during the step between $10 levels, and hedges were picked up. It shows the money remainder you would keep after paying off all you could, how many of the hedges you picked up will remain, and what their net loss is for each one. Just to be clear, the loss mentioned for hedges in the last column is for each hedge pair remaining. So what if you had a $5 buffer? Well you could still pick up some hedges, there's nothing magic about $5 away. But lets say you didn't because your buffer was so large. Attached Image Not bad, you still make over 1% on the clean runs, and any run with less than $5 volatility will be clean. Well which ones are more frequent? Here's a chart from the last couple of weeks or so. Attached Image (click to enlarge) There were 18 crossings with 5 clean runs, meaning no volatility ranging more than $1 out from the relevant $10 line. There were 9 that had less than $5 volatility around the price band and would yield various amounts of hedges. The $3 buffer might cover some of these to yield no hedging. Many would have covered the hedge loss completely and still been profitable. (It's only when you get out near $5 volatility that the move will leave some hedges left over). And 4 that went heavy, more than $5 in volatility and a lot of hedging. Ugly stuff. They're not all maxed out, but the first one looks pretty rough. What is the max DD due to hedge loss from a complete hedge between the bands? (IE when it goes just over $9 to one side and doesn't trigger the next $10 level, then reverses to the level on the other side) If you always trigger on the $10 bands, this is the maximum DD possible in a single run, and there are no profitable trades to offset the losses. The worst case scenario not counting slippage. Naturally all this hedge load will be carried on the next ride between the $10 lines. 30 GridStep would be -26.5%, $2646 DD on a 10k account at 0.1 lots. 50 GridStep would be -17% DD 75 GridStep would be -10.5% DD You can mitigate the risk of this considerably with the Sensitivity setting, making it high enough so that you gather in the near misses anyway. I'll code it so that the grid won't build over top of the sensitivity window. Now I'm not suggesting that these GridStep settings are in any way the best, they are just the numbers we've talked about. I'm going to start on the code for this, I'll have to figure out the best way to selectively close hedge pairs. (BTW there aren't any two opposing trades paired together in reality, this is just a fiction I use to make the math easier). One thing that worries me is all the trade overhead coming at once around that $10 line. I'm hoping that it doesn't get backed up too much trying to get all those orders out. There won't be as many though, with only the next $10 to cover on either side. Hope this helps visualize what we're talking about.

@dgodfrey, I saw your Steady Gold BET V2.1 demo , that is based on ur BET v2.1, am I right? Just wondering, FinFX in your Trade Explorer, suppose to be standard spread which is avg 38. So, is the low spread thing is still applies now? or now even we can actually use this with standard spread?

--- 帖子 #817 ---
It's 2.11 or 2.1, they're the same except for a automatic lot size correction pretty much. And some people wanted fixed lots, that's in 2.11 as well. The spread is a number you can select in the inputs, just put in your broker's average and it will work fine. FinFX is pretty liberal about saying the fills are on the money, perhaps too much so. FXCM on the other hand gives really bad fills, so the truth lies somewhere in between I suspect. Let me know how your broker does on that if you decide to run it. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #818 ---
Looks like we're tee'd up for NFP Friday. Should be interesting to see what comes next.

--- 帖子 #819 ---
My broker gives higher spread avg actually, abt 49. Not sure whether it is ok for Steady Gold. But so far, I've applied it with the normal Steady Gold version (no BET, no hedging, this is the version I downloaded from the first page). It was OK actually, with modified inputs by making the grid more tight. 33% for 21 days. But at this times, it will be just like flat. I guess I need to wait and see, interested to wait for NFP....

--- 帖子 #820 ---
Yeah, v2.11 doesn't really mess around much with how the system works, it's more about getting it stable so when you switch timeframes, turn off the computer, or do anything to cause it to re-initialize it doesn't crash the grid. And it adds BE and Target hypothetical lines to the chart. You really should be ok about the spread, I can't think why that wouldn't work. The figure you mention is the same as FXCM and it runs fine on that. v2.11 has a 50 cent spread by default. With FXCM, it's just that they have so much slippage as to make a grid meaningless.

--- 帖子 #821 ---
ooh... so that is part of the v2.11 feature now? I suppose I don't have to do anything with the inputs when applying v2.11? Except for grid size (well, this is based on preference, whether more spicy or less spicy) and my broker's average spread, am I right?

--- 帖子 #822 ---
Check the post on page 37, post 727. The way the inputs work are detailed there. The version 2.11 is the one that corrects a couple of small issues that came up. I feel stupid about it, but I really don't know how to link to another post using this editor I only recently started really doing anything in the forums.

No prob, been there before. Top right side for each post there's "# Post 822" thing after "Quote" and "Cleanup", right click, copy shortcut. Will check for the explanation. Thanks for the hard work! I do feel fun in this thread though only replied once in a while but I read it most, because of the strategy, the kindness of the people contributing... keep it up! Will try v2.11 next week (after I got memory slot for my VPN...hahaha... out of memory already by running 10+ of MT4).

http://www.kitco.com/images/live/nyg...07787682455684 ~dgodfrey...I think your idea has great potential, we just need to put it to test on demo to see how it goes. I also think, if you want to use historical prices\charts to test, I would choose the last FOMC meeting news, because that's the one that hedged out everybody. If you can make that one work, I think the EA would become unstoppable.

--- 帖子 #825 ---
Looking at it, I think it would go one of two ways. Attached Image

--- 帖子 #826 ---
Looks pretty good. It's probably a good idea, once you implement this, to test with various buffers, like you have in your calculations. That way, we can see which settings net the biggest profit over a significant period of time (like 3 months). I think the buffer will be the setting to change, not the gridsteps. I think 0.50 on that is the reasonable compromise. I like how it allows some profiting, while keeping potential losses floating until they can be ultimately overcome by a straight move. on another note, FF keeps taking my explorer off my signature!! ARRRRG!!! I put it back on, now.

--- 帖子 #828 ---
Yeah, I think all those trades up close to the $10 line are just hedge bait, they get taken in a lot in volatility. So much so that I think they probably lose more over time than the potential gain in a no hedge move of the trades snugged up on the profit side.

--- 帖子 #829 ---
Does this EA run off grid? If not what indicators is it based on?

--- 帖子 #830 ---
It's under development, one of the things we're working on now is using S/R lines as deflection points for grid origin. Details are in the thread.

--- 帖子 #831 ---
@ Pipster Kosmo is having pretty good luck using the $10 grid on a low target and doing catch and reset during volatility - hitting the target then resetting on the same $10 line.

--- 帖子 #832 ---
Thanks for the quick response.

--- 帖子 #833 ---
good! she needs to post it on an explorer.....(hint, kosmo, for you :nerd:blush: OOPS! I see she already did...very nice! ~kosmo...did you do something to keep the BET version from placing new orders once price had moved up to 1220, and cycled?

--- 帖子 #834 ---
A few more thoughts about the $10 grid, and some possible answers to nasty situations. Remember from the chart on this post the very first example was of a heavy hedge. Actually it was the heaviest of the them, an example of maximum DD if it was left to run. As much as -27% in hedgeloss with GridStep = 30 and 0.1 lots by the time a reset was done. Attached Image (click to enlarge) But Kosmo has been taking some nice 1% bites and resetting the grid in volatility lately, which got me thinking of a solution. One thing I didn't consider was that at the moment the momentum died in that surge upward, there was a very nice profit available. As much as 10% on GridStep=30. Also from this post we found that there was a multiplying loss effect of 2.5:1 upon market reversal regardless of step size, and as it turns out on the $10 grid the $5 dividing line approximates the no profit on reversal boundary line nicely. (it's not exactly that for all gridsteps because of where they happen to land and the size of the buffer, but close). Added NOTE: Reading back over this and looking at the charts, I may have created a sense that as long as the volatility hedge trades created by movement around the $10 line occur at prices less than $5 away, the overall P/L at the next reset will be net positve. That's not true. There certainly is no chance of a net profitable position at the next $10 line if the contrary volatile movement exceeds $5, but the tipping point at which the cycle is net negative upon completion is really a little less than $4 away from the $10 line, regardless of the GridStep setting. Still, you have to have some room to let the grid do it's stuff. As long as the price stays under $5 away on the opposing trade side, the hedge pairs generated are very manageable. And with the deciding price set at $5 away the market has a chance at least to run without immediately triggering a BE event in volatility. So here's a TP/BE protective idea: Consider that if the price exceeds $5 away on either side in volatility, you're not going to make any money on the opposite $10 reset line if the market goes that way. As a protective measure then, why not just get out should the price exceed the $5 line (or so, depending on step size) and then reverse to the BE area? You'll be ready for the next time the grid resets and you won't pick up any more hedge pairs than you already have. The profits, BE's and stepsizes are compared here. These numbers assume a loss of $0.50 due to spread. Attached Image (click to enlarge) As you can see with this protective view, the 0.3 stepsize makes a compelling case - over 2% profit at the $5 line and the most wiggle room to BE of any of them. On the downside though, should the price not reach $5 and reverse, there will be larger hedge losses to cover at the next reset using 0.3 as compared to others. See here. So that's the idea, be proactive about near miss reversals, have the ability to allow BE protection. Allow it to hit the next $10 band if it will or take the money off the table at some nominal target beyond the $5 line, but don't get trapped in Max DD. Here's the view of the amended chart above using this idea. There will be times, probably quite a few, when getting out will be unnecessary and leave you gritting your teeth on what might have been, but that's just trading. And check out the bonus that happened in this case! A nice reset for a clean run with no hedges for max profit. Attached Image (click to enlarge) And one last note: Again looking at the chart on this post , you can see that 3 out of 4 of those heavy hedges would have been setups for clean runs instead, just like here.

--- 帖子 #835 ---
dgodfrey, Thank you for the wealth of knowledge and ideas included in your recent posts. What an interesting read! Especially the latest development, the protective BE level, is something I would be very thrilled to test. On paper it looks powerful and promising. Yes. My thinking was very simple here, and as it turns out, quite in line with your observation that the $5 level is the make or break point for our $10 runs - set the target in such a way that it will be reached before price gets to the $5 level. Having this in mind, the question we should be asking ourselves is: what the target would have to be (within the $5 band), so that it can be reached easily either in a straight line (clean, no hedge scenario) OR by the opposite $10 level, in case it does pick up some hedges on its way to the original target, and then reverses. Following your 2.5:1 hedge ratio, it'd seem that we should be aiming at a target within $2.50 from any $10 level. The rest is figuring out grid spacing, risk, and buffer so that our effort is both - feasible and worthwhile. NOTE: Just realised that my thinking doesn't cover an expanding triangle scenario, lol. Imagine one step up, two down, three up etc. What's the solution here? Killing the grid at some loss until the next $10 level is reached?

--- 帖子 #836 ---
Not sure what you're referring to, Pipster.

--- 帖子 #837 ---
I did think about that, how because of volatility you could get that scenario. That would be worst case of course, with all the buy and sellstops opened between a $20 range before it gets to the next $10 band. I tried to find one of those and really couldn't, but some came close. Setting the GridStep then, you have to consider worst case and the kind of hole you would have to dig yourself out of. With GS=30 it's over 27%DD, GS=50 yields around 17%DD and GS=75 runs about 10%DD for the perfect storm. Then you will reset and start to dig out. Against that you have to consider the perfect runs there are, and what those mean to the account gain. With GS=30 it's around 10%, against that risk of 27% DD (notice how that 2.5:1 ratio runs all through this?), and so forth. The more you risk, the more you stand to gain - what a shock! Now if we could just know the number of perfect runs compared to the perfect storms, lol. Unfortunately the numbers just don't really add up for a target this close with a reasonable buffer, mainly due to slippage. 1% on GS can be as close as the $3-4 range, but that turns out to be right where the tilting point is, the price that if the market should turn and head the other way it's pretty much net zero gain at the next $10 level when closing out everything. Fortunately if you don't pick up any more hedging than $2.50 volatility gets you you can still make money on the reset. I guess with a 1% target there might be a sweet spot - you either get your 1% or breakeven at the next reset (unless it's the line you just came from, what you've been doing lately). I guess that's market justice being meted out - there's no safe place in the grid. No guts no glory lol. I'm almost through with the code for the $10 resets and patching up the hedgeloss hole with the gains. That was easier than I thought. I'm in the middle of a rewrite, the whole program crashed and won't initialize now, got me scratching my head. After the rewrite I'll put in the BE trigger and we should be good to go. Some changes - no mention of NoOfSteps - there won't be more than fit to $9 away, controlled by GridStep and Buffer. Less trades to close and open ought to make it faster when cycling. No MaxLoss function, since you don't really have the runaway loss situation and you can stop it whenever you like. No slippage function - that's just an open invitation to orphaned trades and corrupted grids. No BE or TP lines, those just add to the overhead and are kind of irrelevant to what this version does. And Buffer will be absolute - Buffer=100 will start the grid $1 away from the $10 line. Probably some other stuff. I've tried to clean it up and make it more efficient. Hoping I can get it done and released this week.

--- 帖子 #838 ---
What would the worst case DD be and the perfect run gain for GS $1 (effectively net 0.9 after spread)/$1 buffer/0.1 lot? Considering gold's volatility, expanding the GS still feels like the right way to go to me. What if it'd be 1% gain per step? Am I right that two steps would give 3% well before it reaches step three? Wouldn't that be worth a try? Here I go again with my 'wider GS, higher risk, tight target' theory, lol. Or maybe it should be the other way round, i.e. tight GS and higher risk; then the target could be even tighter (in $ distance). I can't stop thinking that we've been somehow overlooking the risk per step factor vs. target in our calculations so far. I like where you're going with the changes for the new version. Are you going to keep Sensitivity though, or is Buffer going to take over its function?

--- 帖子 #839 ---
You have it right with the second choice, the trade density implied by GS=30. But that's assuming that we hold the lotsize constant. it's really more about how many lots you trade. The thing you really have to look at is the average entry price of all the trades in the series, and the quantity of lots. If I trade at GS=90 and lotsize=0.3, or GS=30 and lotsize=0.1, I'll be in nearly the same place after a few dollars movement, because both the average entry price and the number of lots traded will be nearly the same. There is something to be said for the finer granularity of the smaller GS, but the main reason for the wide disparity of results in the previous posts is that I was holding the lotsize to be constant for all GS, and that puts GS=30 with a lot more money on the line in the moves. So with the above said, you can see in a move between lines, have GS=100 will result in an average price about $5 away from the closing price (just like in all the GridSteps) . Then the question is how much exposure do you have? With only 8 trades if you hold lotsize constant, you will only be looking at a result of $400 or so on a $10k account. With GS=30 and the lotsize the same 0.1, the average price is nearly the same, but now there are 26 trades executed for almost $1200 profit with the same 0.1 lotsize. And given that the 2.5:1 rule of thumb holds true throughout, I would expect a Max DD of around $1k for the GS=100 with 0.1 lots. All these numbers are just off the cuff, but I hope I'm being clear.

--- 帖子 #840 ---
Looks like it's going to make a stab at 1230, hope I'm getting a reset there on this version.

--- 帖子 #841 ---
Thanks, dgodfrey. It's all clear, only sinking in slowly with the amount of math to digest.

--- 帖子 #842 ---
No problem! And nothing to be ashamed of lol. It's only cause I'm trying to write this code that I am getting this stuff.

--- 帖子 #843 ---
http://www.kitco.com/images/live/nyg...07787682455684 At the time you didn't have any pending orders placed for over 24 hours. I was just wondering why. ~dgodfrey ...having a smaller equity target doesn't necessarily mean smaller gains overall. When you have a straight move, as long as the EA can close and open orders fast enough, it can take profit on every 3-5 trades worth of moves, which add up. Then, when the market doesn't move so much at other times, the target is small enough to still close trades. I understand you have a minimum profit setting that will help take advantage of this, so allow that minimum to be fairly low. Also, it may be a moot point when $10 levels are used for trigger points. ...speaking of which, is your $10 level EA not have any pending orders after hitting $1230? Or did it open them and then profit?

--- 帖子 #844 ---
You got this one right. The $10 grid is just loving today's bounces between $1230-1220.

--- 帖子 #845 ---
Your question referred to the BET version, but I suspect you meant the $10 grid which only activates around $10 levels, hence the pause in placing the pendings, most probably. There's no manual intervention on either of my TEs.

--- 帖子 #846 ---
@dgodfrey Would it be possible to incorporate micro lots in the $10 grid for smoother compounding? I have the target set at 4%, i.e. initially £40 on £1k account/0.1 lot. As the balance grows, so does the gain sought, BUT not the lotsize, which is still 0.1 after nearly 40% account growth. It means that the price has to go a little further each time to reach the target. I understand it'll jump to 0.2 past £2k, but with micro lots it'd be a much smoother ride.

--- 帖子 #847 ---
@Pipster - the version I'm working on now will have times between the $10 lines when no pending trades are out there. It's waiting on the extremes, hopefully. I've got a partially finished version running on an explorer as Steady Gold SR Grid - took two rounds last night on the GS=30 setting and Profit=2% to net a nice profit I just have to put the BE functions in I mentioned in the last posts and it's time to test this thing.

--- 帖子 #848 ---
Sure, that's just changing a number in the code. I might put it as an input option to select since not all brokers do micros.

--- 帖子 #849 ---
Fantastic, thanks! x2

--- 帖子 #850 ---
It would be really nice if someone would buy several yards of gold right now...I need 1242 or more to get out! Early dec. resistance at 1238...

--- 帖子 #851 ---
Just remember if you're using the BE and TP lines, the grid has to extend to them or they're going to be overly optimistic. They calculations assume the grid is there.

--- 帖子 #852 ---
Entered another account with a different broker. Here's my other trade explorer link http://www.forexfactory.com/jstan#29

--- 帖子 #853 ---
@Thepipster, just want to confirm the basic idea of this EA after a month running it. Basically EA will create multiple buy stop and sell stop at the same time, to form a grid. Once the price moves to something, where in Total Profit will exceeds the target or positive, then you'll close all of them at the same time and then start a new cycle. Am I right? I got this working on my broker, AGEA. Which has .49 (average) spreads . But of course, a modified settings of it. And this is not even using v2.1 or v2.11, this is the version that you've posted on the 1st page which is still buggy with changing timeframe. Here you go: http://www.forexfactory.com/radityo.ardi/53 , age is 25 days. Below is my settings. am running another settings with GridStep 11 (instead of 13), and EquityGainMultiple 3.0 (instead of 1.5)

--- 帖子 #854 ---
Thats pretty much the deal on the version on the 1st page. The idea is that if the market lurches away from the current price there will be profits to be made in the trend. The object is to not get a hedge box built wherein all your stops are taken out on either side before you hit your modest target. Your grid step + spread kind of gives you the spacing of the orders. It's been a while since I looked at those inputs, probably Pipster could tell you better what works for that.

--- 帖子 #855 ---
ya, that is what I've stated. I'm using the version on the very 1st page. @dgodfrey, what is the differences of the 1st page's version and v2.1?

--- 帖子 #856 ---
@dgodfrey, it is weird, my 2.1, some chart have the BE line, and some dont have (both are XAUUSD). how to make the line working back normal?

--- 帖子 #857 ---
A bit of homework wouldn't hurt. It's all been already explained in detail by dgodfrey in this thread.

--- 帖子 #858 ---
Hah! Price went right up to my target, made me lose 1 dollar, and went back down! Now, it needs to go down some more. So, here we can look at the 1240 handle with the $10 entry points idea, and see that a bigger buffer might help, but we'll have to see how price plays out. I only like a small buffer because I want the EA to be able to replace orders that can hit profit target quickly as it re-cycles, if price moves in a straight line. Using the $10 entry points idea, there wouldn't be any need for that, so a bigger buffer would not hurt.

--- 帖子 #859 ---
Sort of frustrating, still exterminating bugs lol. At first blush it looked like an account drainer then realized it's only carry more and more hedges, never getting rid of them with the profits. So the balance went through the roof while the equity dropped through the floor, lol. Back to the drawing board on my accounting functions You can read about it here , there's also some more with the 2.11 version as well. Mainly stability issues were solved. I noticed that on one of the ones I was running as well. The same code that handles some of the accounting functions mentioned above is at play here I suspect, but I haven't had time to chase it down. It reads the accumulated hedge loss and the hypothetical gains for a move in one direction or the other and finds where they net zero dollars. The part about hedge loss and hedge pairs is pretty simple, but isn't working despite reliably that. I'll have to write something more robust, probably just grab some of the iExposure code like dambuster suggested. That indi always works to find what I need, so I guess I don't have to reinvent the wheel.

--- 帖子 #860 ---
I went ahead and took down the SR explorer results until I get the code straightened out. Not much point in running buggy code results.

--- 帖子 #861 ---
@periphery If you are looking at the 2.1 results on a chart that the EA isn't actually running on, there's not any horizontal lines on other charts. It's only set to draw them on the chart the EA is attached to. I'll check to be sure when I get back to the computer.

--- 帖子 #862 ---
@Pipster Did you get out manually? How did that level you got out at match up to the BE line on the chart?

--- 帖子 #863 ---
http://www.kitco.com/images/live/nyg...07787682455684 Help me understand your profit taking plan. The way I understand it you have a global target that you want to achieve overall, while closing sets of unhedged trades at local profit levels, which allow a cycle to be started over without an immediate loss, but may be carrying some DD that has to be overcome so that the global, overall profit can be finally realized. Does this sound correct? Nothing manual, the EA reached it's target. price must have slipped a little...the EA has cycled a few times since then for a little profit.

--- 帖子 #864 ---
Kind of, if I understand what you mean . The first thing with the original idea is that it's non-discretionary about the entry point. Sometimes you enter a new grid at a good point, other times not so much, but thats entirely random. So one idea was to catch places where there is some likelihood of good movement away from the entry point one way or another to be able to get to the target quicker. The second thing with the modification is that there are opportunities constantly, which are necessarily passed on with the original idea if you had several hedges already in the same range as the opportunity. Once you get a pretty good size hedge box going, you have to wait a long time while the price oscillates where the hedges are. The SR version tries to capture some of that activity as profit and pay off on some of the hedge loss at the same time, and hopefully all of it, enabling a clean start to a new grid rather than being stuck on the sidelines waiting for a big market shift.

We've missed you, dambuster! Here's a script that might help some of you that got into my situation. I'm completely boxed at 17 steps out on 0.50 GridStep. Attached Image (click to enlarge) So I wrote this little script to fix that. It's pretty self explanatory. Use exact lotsize. The StartingPrice is the next step in either direction. The Stopping Price is wherever you want it to go, hopefully away from the grid lol. NOTE: Be SURE to put the unique number in you are using on your program, or the orders it creates won't be closed by the EA. This is for Version 2.1, 2.11 and BET. Here I've added stops out to the BE lines on the chart. Just drag the script onto the chart and fill in the information. If you don't put numbers in it won't do anything. BTW it only does one side at a time. To do both just run it twice. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #870 ---
Thanks for your help, Shug.

--- 帖子 #871 ---
Another gem from dgodfrey, thanks

--- 帖子 #872 ---
So at this point in my demo of version 2.1 BET, it's worth revisiting this post. According to my parameters (GS=50, 0.1% of my account per trade lotsize) my maximum box size before 100% DD in the account is around $45 top to bottom. If you look at the dollar distance between my upper and lower BE and TP lines, and the space the current grid occupies, you see it's about (wait for it) $45. In other words, if what just happened to 17 grid steps happens to the rest, the account equity will be zero. My current DD in % terms is about 17.5% of the maximum. So is it worth taking the risk of 100% drawdown waiting on the system to hit my target, or should I just pull the plug here, take the bite into my profit, and start it up again? What do you think? I really don't know lol. I guess I'll let it go and monitor it for the market to get at least close to an edge of the box, and hope I can at least reduce to bite. It means I'm going to have to think about being around watching and waiting to pull the plug manually at some point though should things get shaky. And wonder if some strange overnight move consumes my account while I'm not here.

--- 帖子 #873 ---
I have put up a poll so people can give their opinions on what dgodfrey should do from here.

--- 帖子 #874 ---
Thanks for the script, dgodfrey. May we never have to use it though, lol! FWIW, here's my opinion. Rule no. 1 - cold blood. 17 steps of $0.5 isn't that many considering gold's ADR. It's been trending up since the beginning of Jan, and I still think it'll have a go at $1250 sometime soon (technically possibly even up to $1265, albeit not necessarily in a straight line, lol!). 17.5% DD isn't much. Mine has recovered twice from over 30% DD, precisely because I had more steps available; otherwise I'd have been boxed out too. So, I think adding more steps in your situation is the right decision (no, I will not suggest doubling the lotsize on the added steps... ). If you keep monitoring the PA, and even if it struggles to reach the target, chances are you'll still be able to get out manually around BE. Let's be patient. We can all learn a lesson here on how to manage such situations as they develop.

--- 帖子 #875 ---
Hey dambuster! Welcome back.

--- 帖子 #876 ---
Yeah, it's that non-straight line that got me where I am now! Lol. How about a dip back to $1215 then a blast to just over $1250? Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water.......

--- 帖子 #877 ---
@dgodfrey for the extension script, does the unique number should be the same with unique number in v2.1?

--- 帖子 #878 ---
Yes, the numbers must match

--- 帖子 #879 ---
Yeah, if they don't match the EA will ignore the trades, and won't close them when they're opened or use them in calculations.

--- 帖子 #880 ---
That's the route I'm going to take. It's looking bleak, but the trend has been definitely back up after finding that base below $1200. Besides, with it more or less evenly divided, I don't really mind if it goes up or down, as long as it doesn't yo-yo too much in the process. Go test $1200 again! $1260? I'm all for it. Here's hoping for some kind of big move, anyway.

--- 帖子 #883 ---
As far as I can see, today's move up and the added steps managed to bring your DD down to around 10%, but it still hasn't cycled, has it? Let's see if we can get to $1265... that should help.

--- 帖子 #884 ---
Way to go, Kosmo! Your advice yesterday was timely, to say the least! I manually recycled my 2.1 account this morning, I had put the target way out there and it just missed triggering. But it was quite an improvement over where it was before, that's for sure.

--- 帖子 #885 ---
http://www.kitco.com/images/live/nyg...07787682455684 yay for everybody else. I've got only a few sell pending orders left, but all buys are opened...mucho DD. So, dgodfrey, lets pretend I want to close the unhedged in-profit trades, and pay off hedges, so to speak, at the current price, since all buys are in profit. Would you just close the 5 highest profit buy orders, then calculate how many hedged orders to close to equal a small net profit? Then leave all my other orders open, while opening a new grid? ~Kosmo...superb! what are your settings on the BET version? I see the grid spacing seems to be $1. I'm thinking the $10 entry points are a very good idea combined with good buffer.

--- 帖子 #886 ---
When I've been backtesting the EA I'm working on to test this (not that it's really functional right now in all aspects) I do notice a run on effect - the steady accumulation of hedges, rather than them getting paid off. It seems (with the new EA) that it can never make quite enough to pay off the old debt, which piles up until the account is drained. So that being said, I wouldn't advise you to follow that route ATM. I just don't know yet whether it's as constructive as the old method.

OMG!!!! I just read the news on CHF!!!! I wonder if anybody had some shorts on it. That's what happens when a central bank has too much control, IMO. When they let it slip, all the artificial facade is stripped away! Well, that explains some of the big moves lately...looks like the EUR went down 500 pips in a flash, too.

After all, we want to be in as close to the $10 level as possible, counting on price moving away from it. There's always the risk of picking up some hedges anyway, and if so, the wider the buffer the greater the hedge loss to overcome.

--- 帖子 #890 ---
Thanks...The buffer, I think, has a window of usefulness to it. If it's too big, than yes, the gap is too big to make much sense to overcome. But, too small, and a hedge is practically guaranteed, which is more negative loss to have to overcome, too. If we had a $3 buffer, that is $6 loss to overcome to beat one hedge. If we had a $1 buffer, but had 3 opposite trades opened before price moved far enough to hit profit target, we would have to overcome a total of $6+$4+$2=$12 loss to profit...see?

--- 帖子 #891 ---
Very true... So, the question is, what's the optimal 'window'? Anyone?

--- 帖子 #892 ---
Game plan completed, $1265 hit, what's next? Top of the channel $1275-1280, after a retest of $1250? One thing's for sure; we will find out, eventually.

--- 帖子 #893 ---
Last night on the SR version I was working on I was backtesting to see if some variables were functioning as they are supposed to (they weren't, lol). But one thing I put in to reduce the hedge load was a buffer setting of 600, which allowed a window $6 to either side. I was getting very few hedges, and it seems that once it gets past that point it "wants" to go to the next $10 line, almost attracted to it. I had to bump up the lotsize to allow it to trade enough volume to make any money, but it seemed like an idea worth trying.

--- 帖子 #894 ---
A $12 negative to overcome might be better than 12+10+8+6+4+2=$42!!!

--- 帖子 #895 ---
Yep, I see what you're saying. Thanks, will give it a go.

It's interesting that Gold closed sustaining it's rise, but oil went right back down....EUR in the tank.

--- 帖子 #899 ---
Yeah, it's pretty bad cause of course most traders would have been long at EURCHF at 1.20, where the Swiss had it pegged, waiting on a little bump in the only direction it could go. Until the Swiss yanked out the rug - voila! - and you get that instant 2000 pip sinking feeling.

http://www.kitco.com/images/live/nyg...07787682455684 From Finfx website... Due to the Thursday’s dramatic move on the Swiss franc by the Swiss National Bank, a number of brokers have announced that they “can no longer meet regulatory minimum capitalization requirements because of significant losses”. A considerable number of brokers went bankrupt and closed down. FinFX adheres to strict risk management policies and has an extensive range of internal policies and procedures to ensure high standards of business processes; thus we were able to overcome unprecedented volatility. FinFX would like to inform our clients, that our business was not affected substantially. FinFX will continue to operate normally. Good, because a lot of other brokers are going down the tubes, including FXCM , Alpari, Fxpro , IG markets, Excel NZ...etc. They did stop trading on CHF pairs for awhile, but are allowing it again now.

--- 帖子 #908 ---
@dambuster I know what you mean, I have a live account with ATC, which is an IB for FXCM. Had me worried on Friday, before they got a bailout loan from Leucadia National. I guess you have a level of protection there in the UK with segregated accounts, but in the US the accounts are mingled with the broker's funds by law, and no protection is offered. The law for "our protection" from Congress, which of course does the opposite. Moral: Don't leave much at the brokerage here in the states. If you make money, take it out quick! Some multi-service brokers (like IB) will segregate any money not used in margin at the end of the day into other protected accounts , but still...... Soooo, I can't make any sense so far of the ideas I've had with the grid beyond the $10 grid EA I already put out there - new versions are not helping, only hurting so far in backtesting. Still got buggy code trying to track and selectively take out hedges with profits, lots of problems sucking up all my time lol. That being said, I did go ahead and get v1.2 ready for the $10 grid, and fixed a couple of issues Kosmo pointed out. - it now draws vertical lines reliably at grid initiation, and also there's an added color for a grid termination line, should it end and sit dormant before reinitiation. - it has a micro-compounding flag if you want that. Note that if you use a fixed lot size no compounding is done and the trade amount variable is ignored. - it tries to close the pending trades from the inside of the grid to the outside. (I haven't seen this work yet - it might still need some tweaking). - New feature - dynamic grid : With this set to true, the initial grid built is 10 steps out from the $10 line initiiation. If the pending trades are filled so as to push the BE lines beyond the grid it will automatically fill in to the BE line on either side. If this is set to true, NoOfSteps is ignored. If you are new here, a more complete explanation of the inputs are at post #727 and #778. A word of caution : Grids have the potential to blow out accounts if left untended. Removing profit regularly is a good idea. The dynamic grid is guaranteed to consume all the money in the account in certain market conditions. Keep an eye on things and don't let it get out of hand! Having a fixed grid will give you time to consider whether to continue should the box become completely hedged, whereas the dynamic grid will run until it stops due to no equity or hits a target. Also, it will put a ton of pending orders on the screen, especially with low GridStep, and the more you have, the more time they take to close when the EA recycles. The BE and Target lines are counting on the pending trades to be there to be accurate, so they're necessary, but just be careful. I will probably just work using this version as a base, because you can easily make the $10 grid EA to behave like the v2.11 BET EA - just set your sensitivity window wide open (like &gt;500 with the PriceGrid at 10) and it will completely encompass the space between the $10 lines, making the two EA's indistinguishable. There is a grid reset feature that takes the money off the table at the $10 line if the P/L is greater than MidGridGain regardless of whether the target is hit. This is disabled if the Sensitivity window setting is &gt;200. So if you like the 2.11 version and want a dynamic grid, just jack up the Sensitivity and you'll have it with this version. By the way, those pesky Global Variables are necessary, but stick around a long time. If you want to make a clean slate I've included a couple of scripts, one to help identify them and a second to wipe them out, selectively or otherwise. About updating - if you stop the existing EA and open this one with the same unique number, it should recognize the existing grid and not reset. I haven't tried this. That would be no. It rewrote a new grid on top of the old one. It didn't close the old grid, though, or reset. Just ignored that there were trades already there. NOTE: Uploaded files again at 05:28 EST with code to close the grid more efficiently. There were two downloads at that point if you guys want to overwrite the previous file.

I think you will get your money back because client funds are put into a separate account and are not treated the same as the brokers own money. 50k is covered though under this scheme. http://www.fscs.org.uk/what-we-cover...sation-limits/ However, I see there was talk of FXCM actually buying Alpari UK...... I honestly think you'll be fine but appreciate you have money tied up with them which could be put to better use with another broker! I'd have them on re'dial asking for my money back asap.

--- 帖子 #910 ---
About backtesting - with the resets at fixed intervals ($10 lines) we should be able to backtest this with a swipe at validity. One thing I noticed was that the month leading up to Christmas was especially hard on more aggressive settings, while the month (til now) after has been very rewarding for aggressiveness. One combination of settings I found made almost 500% after Christmas, but cratered the account before Christmas. In general, the settings that do ok before Christmas are the most conservative ones. 1% target, 0.1 trade amounts, 100 or 300 buffer, 50 step. Settings like this don't yield nearly as much after Christmas (20-30% is common) as others, but they make about the same before Christmas. All the tests I did assumed closing out before Christmas and reopening after - that gap killed about everything. The settings mentioned above yielded around 60-70% for the whole period if you shut it down, but that dropped to around 10% if you left it running. If anyone has settings they find that work well in all seasons it would be good to know.

--- 帖子 #911 ---
Whatever the situation, I truly hope it'll turn out positive for you. If you're already looking for another broker, there's an interesting discussion going on here . Plenty of survivors to choose from, with the quality of their execution under careful scrutiny. Good luck, dambuster!

--- 帖子 #912 ---
Absolutely wonderful! Thank you for not letting go of your efforts to push things forward, dgodfrey. WOW! The dynamic grid has arrived (yes, I did read the word of caution, lol)! Also, thank you for your input on settings/seasons. Now that we have a robust tool, we can finally focus on finding ways to optimise the performance, depending on market conditions.

--- 帖子 #913 ---
Thanks, Kosmo! The trick with the original was that it really couldn't be backtested - it was completely dependent on where the first grid initiated, so the outcomes were totally random. Start in one place, you got one outcome, start a few $'s away, and it gave an entirely different result, regardless of settings. Since the $10 grid trades have the same entries, we should be able to backtest effectively. I don't have a good history to test with, but I might look into that. Still, what's important is that the settings we pick be robust in several market conditions, because we don't know what's coming next. I'm not so concerned with max money output as I am with settings that will take a lot of abusive market conditions and still not crater. When I stumble across settings that hold up where others blow out the account, I'm willing to take a little less should they not be optimum for a trend like the one we've been in this month.

--- 帖子 #914 ---
~dgodfrey...thanks for the updated EA...I will probably start testing with it, if it runs ok without bugs for everyone. Good luck on your broker situation!

--- 帖子 #915 ---
Thanks, I think I'm ok with the broker thing. FXCM is talking about buying out Alpari - how's them apples? But I bet there's some risk analysis folks out looking for jobs today. I'm hoping the code works well too. I might have to go back to the inside out closing of pending orders and do some more, that's kind of tricky. It would seem to be just FIFO, but for some reason it doesn't do that when you just reverse the order of closing that was there. Still, that won't keep it from working.

--- 帖子 #916 ---
How not to love pure and simple PA! Isn't that a perfect place to short? Let's see if we can get back to $1250... NOTE: Gold closing in one hour today.

Sure hope so, a nice $30 shot would be cool Was doing some backtesting and for the period from July til Christmas, had one setting that yielded consistently high results, as much as 1000%. But along the way it showed a negative account balance at one point, so that sounds pretty flaky. Oddly enough, the equity during that period was flat, what does that mean? Attached Image (click to enlarge) I'm wondering if I can code this so that it regularly makes withdrawals. That would be cool to backtest.

--- 帖子 #919 ---
So far, gold is starting this year identical to last year. Last year it was russia threatening ukraine. This year it's a hedge against the falling DOW and other stocks, as oil stays low. (I filled up my car for $1.75\gal) .

--- 帖子 #920 ---
~kosmo...are you still using the same settings as before on your $10 entry point version? Or did you expand the buffer? Your's is doing really good. The good spread helps, too.

--- 帖子 #921 ---
Hey Pipster, Yep, all settings are the same, no changes to the buffer. True, it's gaining fast, but with such aggressive lotsize, DD can get nasty, like right now. It's already recovered once from nearly 60% DD, and I keep the original settings on purpose, as a 'stress test'.

--- 帖子 #922 ---
http://www.kitco.com/images/live/nyg...07787682455684 ok...yeah, it should really be 10% of that gain, which is still really good. I guess we'll see what today brings. Had I expanded my grid I would be ahead now...I probably will put on the latest BET version when I visit my VPS again. ~dgodfrey...do you have $10 entry points on your v1.2?

--- 帖子 #924 ---
This EA was written on build 765, I don't know about compatibility with earlier versions. The only one of the EA's here with any validity in backtesting would be the $10 grid versions, since the others use random entries in any timeframe that aren't duplicated either live between accounts or in backtesting.

--- 帖子 #925 ---
Just found a bug in the latest code, it will overprint the grid if you try to change timeframes or parameters while the BE and Target lines are displayed. If it hasn't activated any trades it won't do it. The problem is it loses track of the grid top and bottom and creates new pending orders that overprint the existing ones when the program re-initiates. I'll patch it and release asap, but in the meantime try to avoid changing things if there are open trades. When I fix this you should be able to remove the defective version and install the updated one using the correct unique number without waiting for a cycle to end.

--- 帖子 #926 ---
Thanks for letting us know. I haven't loaded the latest version yet, waiting for the $10 to cycle. It has today, but I've missed it.

--- 帖子 #927 ---
Still haven't gotten that bug ironed out. I hope to have something this evening or tomorrow. In the meantime I guess just use an older version without the dynamic grid. Sorry about that.

Kinda dull here while price ranges around below 1300 here. Slow it goes.

sideways.... I gotta close 1 of my EA, and start a new one with wider gaps. Because of all of BUYs and SELLs are touched, so break-even price is even wider and harder to reach in a short time. Some cycle are closed with profit down like a stalled airplane. I think wider gaps will be safe in the case of sideways. Am I right? Below, last one is the one (SG 100 v.2.1) I started last night, with Buffer of 100 and gaps of 150. I set for smaller Target actually. But we'll see in the next 1 month.

The one thats doing best for me atm is the one I've tracked the longest - it's using BET v2.11 and has 0.2 lots with a 1% target. Buffer is 100 and GridSpace is 50. It's cycled a lot this week, seems for it to be easier to hit targets in normal market oscillations with the doubled lot size.

Happy for you, dambuster! Good luck going forward. A few questions, please: - which broker are you using? - any comments on slippage (I presume you're running it on gold)? - are you running it between certain times or round the clock? - any manual intervention? Many thanks.

--- 帖子 #943 ---
You're right about that, Pipster... 334% gain in under a month (with no positions open atm) is not to be sniffed at, lol! The original one is looking poor though; all sells triggered, only 7 buys left. The only way out is down, but if gold is going to continue north, the end is near. Good luck with your $10 test.

I've been working on some other things but I didn't forget about this thread. Here's a fix for the instability in $10 grid v1.2, where it was overwriting the grid any time it re-initiated. I hope it works, I've tested it and it seems stable, but of course you need to verify this for yourself if you decide to use it. In demo mode for sure. Some things have changed to get this version to work. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Added stuff: PendingBuffer - this is how many pending orders that will be added to each side of grid. The EA will add enough to maintain this number of pending orders at all times. I don't think it will work if you have less than 3, it might mess with a check routine in the EA. It should be a number that will let it react to sudden moves, and would have to include some thought about the GridStep. With GridStep at 50 and PendingBuffer=5, you would be able to have to have a one tick move of $2.50 in the price to swamp the orders. UseTradingHours - I've redone this feature to make the EA only set a grid between the hours given by the starting and stopping hours. This should allow you to keep it from starting a new grid in the off hours when significant movement is less likely. The hours are server time. Default is false - it trades all the time. I did clean up the code to make it run a little faster. One thing I noticed in backtesting was the occasional orphan that messed up the grid, and I try to trap for that. I tried it out a few times live, changing parameters and turning the platform off and on and it didn't overprint the grid. Like the other $10 grid EA's, you can use it to trade like the standard BET version 2.11 by opening the Sensitivity to be more than half the distance in dollars between the lines given by the PriceGrid variable. Good luck trading! I'm running this version now on my TradeExplorer, opened up to trade like BET 2.11.

Thanks dgodfrey! Q: can the pending buffer feature be switched off, perhaps setting dynamic grid false?

--- 帖子 #947 ---
i already run the $10 grid v.13 since 2 hours ago but still no open pending post at the moment, is it normal?

--- 帖子 #948 ---
@ dambuster - yes, like the other one, setting dynamic to false will force it to use the NoOfSteps setting instead. I hadn't really thought to test this, but I didn't change that part of the code so it should work. Or you could set the PendingBuffer to equal the NoOfSteps setting, which would always leave that many pending trades. @ periphery - depending on the setting for Sensitivity-- if you have if on default settings it will have to cross a $10 even price to initiate. The last was around 6:00 or so at $1280. If it did cross that and not initiate then there's something wrong.

--- 帖子 #949 ---
As always, you are a gentleman dgodfrey Final question, am I right in thinking that in attaching the v1.3 over the v1.2 it will not take over the exisiting trades but simply create a new grid?

--- 帖子 #950 ---
I'm not sure about that one. If it's got the same unique number it shouldn't overwrite the existing trades, as it sees them there. But I haven't verified that.

--- 帖子 #951 ---
Thanks for the fixed version, dgodfrey...if I can scrounge up some time to update my VPS with it, I'll put up a new trade explorer with it. http://www.kitco.com/images/live/nyg...07787682455684

I hope it works, I've tested it and it seems stable, but of course you need to verify this for yourself if you decide to use it. In first of all thanks... what time frame should be used to run the EA??

--- 帖子 #955 ---
It runs on any timeframe, I've got it on 15m. It only looks at prices.

--- 帖子 #956 ---
Is your v2.1 explorer the one you put the v1.3 version on? or is it the v1.2, as far as the name?

--- 帖子 #957 ---
It's on $10 bet - I didn't know how to change the name. It started on Bet V1.2 but I've migrated it around with the changes, and commented here when I did. The settings on it are going to make it behave like the version 2.1 BET though, with the sensitivity window open to make it trade all the time. One thing to remember about doing that, though, which I just found on my own as well. If you open the sensitivity window up to make it trade a like v2.1, you will have to alter MinGridGain to be more than your target value or it will cycle out early. I just noticed my own program has a Target of 1%, which translates to around $210 currently - but MidGridGain was set at $100 and it's been cycling out on that instead. The reason is that if it was used properly (looking for the $10 lines) it would take the minimal MinGridGain to recycle on the line if it was available. But with it wide open like I have it, it is now always cycling on the smaller number. To fix that, just set MinGridGain to a large number if you use it with the Sensitivity wide, and it will cycle on the Target number instead.

--- 帖子 #958 ---
So to help someone as thick as me, if mingridgain is set to say 150, but target is say 200, it will jump out at the next $10 line if 150 is hit or close irrespective of P/L at the next $10 line? I ask as it cycled this morning on a $10 line but ended with a small loss (am away so cant check if it was due to slippage/fast move or slow closing)

--- 帖子 #959 ---
yeah, if it's &gt;= MidGridGain when it sees the next $10 line it will get out short of the target; it will exit at above the MidGridGain. That was a valve to let you reset on the $10 line even if the target wasn't reached, as long as it met some profit expectation. The trick is, if you have the Sensitivity wide open to allow it to reset at any time, it will always exit on the MidGridGain, because it interprets that it's always at the $10 line. Just a quirk that comes into play if you are making the EA mimic the BET v2.11 like I'm doing on my main demo account. I think I have the default on MidGridGain set at $10, so it might have had a small loss due to slippage if it was showing a modest profit.

--- 帖子 #960 ---

--- 帖子 #961 ---
you're kicking it! http://www.kitco.com/images/live/nyg...07787682455684 I think I would want to try it with the sensitivity around a $1, and let the minimum target be maybe half of the normal target equity, and let the $10 entry levels do their thing.

--- 帖子 #962 ---
so did i have 9 cycle already ?

--- 帖子 #963 ---
@periphery the gold lines are markers for a new cycle. The aqua lines are targets hit. There is a time between the aqua and next gold while it is waiting to cross the $10 line. So each gold line marks a cycle. On the screenshot I put up, I've got the sensitivity set for immediate reentry, so there's no aqua lines because it recycles right away. On an active day there will be a bunch of cycles if there's no waiting.

ok, i will do. Please tell me what's the benefit of using this grid system apart from loosing or big drawdown.

--- 帖子 #967 ---
By their nature grids are non-directional, and don't depend on indicators or timeframes. All you need is sufiicient movement away from the origin of the grid and it will be profitable. The part that gets you burned is the flat times with prices doing small oscillations, which (in this system) creates floating losses in the form of hedged out positions. The way most people use them is to only trade on very small accounts, and remove the profits frequently, knowing that the max DD is going to come - it's inevitable. Occasionally you'll lose an account doing this, the idea is that the amount you gain and remove will be more than the loss.

Did it do it on both your explorers? it looks like the smaller one netted a loss, too. I'm now blocked out....that's why we're testing. Looks like Kosmo's did the same thing...maybe margin call? I'm not sure. What about the settings on the equitytargetloss?

No problems here: Account 1 with Steady Gold BET v2.11 behaved normally and netted around 6.5% Account 2 with Steady Gold BET v2.11 has been boxed in since 20th January, had iits grid extended by 8 steps on January 29th and I traded out manually during NFP (would have needed $1225 to close automatically)

Another observation: I wanted to close some pending orders shortly before market close in case there was a black swan event over the weekend with a view to using the grid extender EA to put them back on when the market reopens. However, as soon as I closed one pending order the EA cycled and closed everything. Will try amending the pending orders to say $500 away from current price just before market close and then put them back where they were shortly after the maket reopens Will report back if this works without the EA cycling

I didn't try that, but what might work is to toggle the auto trade button to off, then manually take off the trades you want. As to getting them back on, I'll have to play with that when the market is live and see what it will do. It could be at present you'd have to remove the EA and resinstall the missing trades with the extender, then put the EA back in - sounds like a pain and I don't know if it would work even then. I'll see what I can find in the code and get back to you.

I don't think it was margin call. It happened shortly after I switched from v1 to dynamic v2. I wasn't watching it too closely, but one thing I remember seeing before the first negative cycle was that the TP lines were outside the box. Could that be it? Then I changed to v3 and it had 1 or 2 more negative cycles (NFP included). It's recovering slowly now. I'll wait for another cycle and change back to v1.

oh no dont change anything can you invert your strategy you've got a winner

--- 帖子 #978 ---
I have an inversion "version", but it doesn't exactly work that way. You can lose big when the market trends. It uses limit orders instead of stop entry orders. I've posted a old version here, someone will have to convert it like they converted the first one. Basically it could have advantage if used with an SL that stops it when market trends, but allows profits to build up while market ranges. Feel free to experiment with it. Attached File(s) SteadyGold LIMIT.mq4 14 KB | 625 downloads ~kosmo...so the losses may have been caused by switching the versions? It seems the version you were running for awhile there really did good.

--- 帖子 #979 ---
Having the BE and TP lines outside the box on the dynamic version is normal, depending on how much the other side is filled out. It's only going to put 5 pending trades up, no matter where the BE or TP lines are. I'm trying mine on 10% target to see if it will build back. What is shown in the explorer as v2.1 BET is really the dynamic version with the Sensitivity opened up to allow trading all the time. Still don't know why it closed at a loss there, if it had behaved it would have been able to break out of the box.

Why does it work differently on different brokers time frames?????????

--- 帖子 #736 ---
Not by switching itself as I only switched once a cycle completed, with no open trades running. The fact that the negative cycling occured more or less at the same time as dgodfrey's, could mean a bug in v2 and v3; no problems with v1.

--- 帖子 #737 ---
Thanks for the explanation, dgodfrey. We're both using the dynamic version, and we both had negative cycles around the same time, while dambuster's using BET 2.11 with no problems and I've had no problems with the v1 either. Maybe keeping it simple is the way to go. Could you please add micro compounding to BET 2.11 and $10 grid v1? We'd then have two reliable versions with all the bells and whistles. Many thanks in advance.

I haven't been on much lately, have a project that's absorbing all my time it seems. I did look at one thing last night, just out of curiosity and because it was quick to do. 1. This system's results will always be random, because of the potential for a boxed hedge that absorbs the whole account is always there. 2. Because of exponential growth in returns, it should be possible to occasionally hit a home run. So I ran a backtest from the day after Christmas to today, optimizing for target. And another one for Oct 1 to the day before Christmas. The results, as you might expect, were random. For instance, asking 10% return with 0.2% trade size gave a handsome profit. Asking for 9% with the same trade size destroyed the account. How is that possible, since you actually made it easier to hit the target? Because the points at which grids were initiated in the two trials would be different - and if the grid initiation points are different the outcome is either winner or loser, regardless of what you ask for in terms of profit. Some very low targets bombed the account, asking for a 20% target yielded a 650% return from Oct to Christmas. Well, here's an idea, then. Using a small fraction of your total investment, and asking for a large return target value, start a new instance of the EA each day for X days, based on your total investment. A certain number will fail, a certain number will grow huge, because your initiation point is different in each case. Or just do several as above, except all on the same day with different targets. Some fail, some grow huge. And in the end you'll collect more from the winners, hopefully, than you lose in total. This should work because you can only lose down to margin call on the losers, but the winners can win any amount. Limited loss, unlimited gain.

Another use of this EA is for general "discretionary" trading, and using it as a trigger pull. So, when you would normally open a trade according to whatever strategy you use, whether you buy or sell, you can instead just initiate the EA, and let the pending orders be placed, and if your strategy is fairly good at getting ahead of a big market move, the EA will take care of any negative movement from your decided entry point. You can use it as a one-time tool, instead of all the time, in other words.

Hi dgodfrey, What should we do if all the buy &amp; sell grids have been triggered and we have a balanced buy &amp; sell orders. This would create a situation wherein we are locked in a floating drawdown. Do we remove the EA and manual trade out of this lockdown or just close all the open orders for a loss ? I've encountered this one time and puzzled on what to do.

--- 帖子 #742 ---
Depending on equity and risk sentiment you can: A: close all and start again B: remove EA and trade out manually C: extend the grid with the extender script

--- 帖子 #743 ---
Hi dambuster, Thanks, I would like to experiment with b &amp; c. For b: depending on where price is on our grid do we close orders from in going out or vice versa. have you tried trading manually in a full hedged position ? For c: do you have the extender script ?

--- 帖子 #744 ---
b: yes c: it's in this thread - click attachment icon, top right of page and search for it

High leverage took its toll; my $10 grid is down to 50% after reaching nearly 600% gain in less than two months. Still, that's 5:1 if the money was withdrawn regularly. The next tester will be toned down to half the leverage and half the target - twice the wiggle room for margin. The original is building slowly again, after I reset it manually for a small loss.

--- 帖子 #746 ---
I think that version, with the configuration you were using, except for the high leverage, seems to be the best performing out of all the versions so far. http://l3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/.W...m/dt150225.gif Dilbert is on a roll on this the last week. Pretty funny.
