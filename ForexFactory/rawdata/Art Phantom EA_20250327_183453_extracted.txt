First of all, this thread is a little modification from the original EA from Basket 14 EA System thread. So all the gratitude to MC and everyone who has contributed. I start a new thread because I think this EA has enough potential to merit a separate one.

If you want to understand exactly how the EA works, Basket 14 EA System reading is a must. I will not explain something that MC has done before better than anyone.

The EA is called Art Phantom for D' Artagnan because it opens real trades only for 3 pairs relevants for each session: EUR for London Session, USD for New York Session and JPY for Tokyo Session.

The 3 pairs are: EUR/JPY (Athos), USD/JPY (Porthos) and EUR/USD (Aramis), The Three Musketeers. Each 60 min for one version, 30 min for another version (Tim' s Suggestion) and each 15 min for the last version, D' Artagnan could call one of the Three Musketeers (sometimes two) in order to achieve the target (PP). Musketeers are only available once, twice or four times in an hour, depending the version.

Trades could be: Buy Athos, Sell Porthos and Sell Aramis, so if D' Artagnan call The Three Musketeers and they are all together at the same time we have "all for one, one for all", a perfect syntetic hedge. So with only 3 pairs we could reach this situation very quick if market goes against our position and DD could be under control very soon.

This EA follows a really simple strategy: it will open Real Trades only if the Phantom Trade of this pair is in profit and if all previous Real Trades of this pair are in profit.

We have 3 versions:

1.- Art Phantom Extreme: possible call at min 0, 15, 30 and 45.

2.- Art Phantom Full: possible call at min 15 and 45.

3.- Art Phantom Light: possible call at min 15.

DD would be similar in all versions but with Extreme we must reach this situation quicker, recovery must be quicker too and Profit Target would be reach with less pair movement. Obviously trades could increase too.

The Three Musketeers could use differents swords: EUR/JPY, USD/JPY, EUR/USD; or GBP/USD, EUR/GBP, EUR/USD; or GBP/JPY, EUR/GBP, EUR/JPY(Charvo' s Suggestion), or any others you want to try.

I' m not a coder, I' ve only made ( and anyone could) a very simple change: just open Metaeditor, try and check errors with Compiler. You will learn a lot if you try.

These EA' s are in their first test stage so they need more time to know exactly their performance.

About Settings: with 10.000.-$ demo account, 500:1 Leverage, MMTU = 0.4 and P.P = 1.0 seems to work splendid.

Art Phantom Full: since 18-11-2010, Gain: + 3,46%, max DD: - 6,10%, Lowest Margin: 1.482,63%, actually Floating P/L: + 18,21.-$, 8 trades open.

With this EA, a 26 pips movement is enough to reach 1% profit target, as I saw last Friday, so the potential is really high.

Enjoy it.

Welcome Pluto2

I will follow  and testing the light version on a small demo account but also be around at MC's threat.

Nice name. I like the story of this Ea. One for all, all for one. Let's see how noble and fierce it fights.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Thank you. Let' s see how it works but I have great confidence in this EA...

--- 帖子 #6 ---
thanks a lot! will start demoing on Monday, and will report my results.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Thanks Charvo. I will wait for your results with great interest.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Good work Caillou

I assume that the Phantom3.30_suv from the old thread is the same as the Art Phantom Full?

And the only difference is you have made the basket pairs external variable options to choose as we like?

Thanks

Tim

--- 帖子 #9 ---
calliouu : I am testing presently the following :

Phantom3 _suv

Phantom3_30_suv.

The ones in this thread are the same as above or different?

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Great work Caillou and very creative btw... Hope to run one of these live, soon.

edit; forget about FF and html (it doesn't work). May have to do iFrames one of these times. oh well !

--- 帖子 #11 ---
less pairs, less DD and more peace of mind.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Hi Tim,

Yes, Full Version is the same as 3.30. And no sorry, the pairs external variable options to choose is something that must be done for someone with better coding skills than me. Now if we want to change pairs we have to change inside the code but is extremely easy and quick to do.....

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Hi Navk,

The same, only one different version even more dynamic: extreme version, I will test tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Me too, I hope to do it very soon.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Exactly, if you reach the same profit with less pairs, why complicate your life?

--- 帖子 #16 ---
I think the next step for the basket EA's is to include some cointegration calculations, although this is technical to say the least I'm trying to figure it out...

Some papers regarding this:

http://tradingwithmatlab.blogspot.co...n-testing.html

By the way I will test these EA's from monday onwards...

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Interesting Saidar. Next week we will see the potential of this approach.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Couple of threads here at forex factory also covering this, but they are not really going anywhere at the moment.

Think the reason is it is kinda difficult to implement, but still one of the best methods out there to open multi currency trades I believe.

At the moment the EA is opening the same lot size on all pairs, implementing cointegration will enable us to calculate different lot sizes for each pair for maximum profit.  At least that is how I understand it.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Me too

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Something similar I had on my mind..

--- 帖子 #21 ---
First basket Phantom3_30_suv got closed.

I put this in FX solutions/australia demo a/c. They charge premium fee for all open positions since friday. Is this normal sawp charges or some other fee / Any idea ?

I started with 4833 $ Presently the equity is 4783 $

--- 帖子 #22 ---
I am with Alpari UK and no charges for me. With Art_Phantom_Full since Thursday I' m 8.51% up !!! But Weekend Gap went in my favour.....sometimes it will go against but I' m sure the EA could recover.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
This one is phanotom3 _suv or phantom3_30_suv?

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Hi Caillou,

Have loaded all three EA's on demo we'll see how they go.

(MC's Phantom 6 2a didn't fare well for me, resulted in severe 28% DD! I bailed, couldn't take it on the chin for much longer...)

Phantom3.30_suv

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hi Pet,

Let us know your results. I' m going to start demo with Art_Phantom_Extreme, Art_Phantom_Full is doing extremely well, 2.5 days, 8.51% up, -6,10% DD....but it' s too early....

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Can we use both Extreme and Full versions on the same account.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
I would not do. You will have a possible call at min 0, 15 ( for both), 30 and 45 ( for both). So use Extreme version and increase MMTU if you want, just my opinion.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Another hit: +9,51% up.....

--- 帖子 #30 ---
I have the Extreme open since sunday opening, nothing closed yet, DD is 1.5%

--- 帖子 #31 ---
I' m going to test this in 1 hour, DD -1,5% is really good......how many trades?

--- 帖子 #32 ---
open since sunday (g/u ,e/u, e/gbp)  nothing closed yet, +0.2% equity,

opened 0.4lot (balance 10000)

--- 帖子 #33 ---
9 trades 7,20 lots open (balance 100000)

dd back to 1%

--- 帖子 #34 ---
So you are testing with EUR, GBP, USD, results are not comparable, Art_Phantoms used EUR, USD, JPY, because JPY is more weight for Asian Session....

--- 帖子 #35 ---
no, I am testing with eur/usd/jpy, art phantom.

I have another platform where I also test G/U,e/u, e/g, the phantom 3.30,

those are not mixed

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Ok, so for Art_Phantom_Extreme, wich are your settings, max DD, Lowest Margin, floating P/L now and open trades?

--- 帖子 #37 ---
everything standard, did not change anything,  MMTU  0.2

PP 1

lev 400:1  marg 4265%  low margin 4229%  max floating DD -1.73%

floating p/l -0.96%  open trades 9

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Which broker you are using. I am using SIGTrader with Art_Phantom Full. Its keep opening new trades but not yet in Profit.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Perfect, Lowest Margin high and DD is under control, let´s see...

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Hi Reachjj,

I use Alpari UK, my last hit was at 8h12 (GMT +2), now I have exactly the same open trades like you, but 0.22 lots and floating P/L -107.34.-$, so we will have +/- the same closure at similar time...

--- 帖子 #41 ---
anyone thought about putting the profit target lower?

got 0.6-0.7 % on g/u ,e/u e/g, for a while ,adding positions and coming back to b/e, wonderig if putting target to 0.65 would be a good idea?

--- 帖子 #42 ---
I have just started demo, 10.000.-$, Leverage 200:1, MMTU:1.0, PP:1.0

http://www.myfxbook.com/members/Serg...-extreme/65441

--- 帖子 #43 ---
when you use higher MMTU (1 instead of 0.4) does it change the lotsize? bigger lots?

--- 帖子 #44 ---
thats interesting..  Lets wait for closure of this basket......

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Of course, Lot size will depend Type Account, MMTU and Leverage. As Leverage is smaller than with Alpari, I increase MMTU because I want to compare each EA with same starting lot size....

--- 帖子 #46 ---
i changed mmtu to 1 on g/u (200 lev)  and to 0.5 on art extr (400 lev)

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Is it very difficult to make it work with Other EAs. Is it possible to modify the code to addup the Open Trade profits and decide whether to close or not instead of just overall account balance.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
I' m sure it is possible, a coder could do. Now if you want to close all open orders manually there are scripts for that. I will post one in 2 hours..

--- 帖子 #49 ---
My g/u went from +0.7 to -1.55, with higher lotsize would most probably hit pt.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Extreme, full and lite loaded at same time 6 hours ago. Extreme and full just closed at 1%+ within 1 min of each other, lite is still active. Max DD on extreme 2.94%, full 1.98%.

Will post details in myfxbook in due course...

Pete

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Amazing!!!!

--- 帖子 #52 ---
extreme max dd -2.07 13 deals, pl -1.6%

g/u phantom  max dd -2.44, pl -2.2% 13 deals

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Second initiation of Extreme closed yet again for 1% after 1 hour, first init of lite closed 15 past this hour for 1%, second init of full and lite are both in progress...

Version = Art_Phantom_Extreme

MMTU              =  0.3

PPCT               = 0.25

Max Float Down = -0.36% ( as shown on screen )

Total Trades     = 9

Duration           = 6 hours (estimated from 1st trade to closing )

This batch lasted through the sleepy asian time. As I set up the EA on a GBPJPY, some ticks are missing which causes the winning trade not being triggered at the stated intervals.

Looks good and looks like another batch coming up

Art_Phantom_Full: +10,48% since Thursday, max DD: -6,10%

Art_Phantom_Extreme: +2,10% in 4 hours, max DD: -0,47%, last hit with 3 trades in 30 min !!!!!

With this EA, we have 2 possible opposite scenarios:

1.- The safer: when we have the same number of trades of each pair, perfect syntetic hedge, any movement will produce a very small profit/loss

2.- The most risky: when we are very close to reach the target, unbalanced situation, 4-5 trades of the same pair. In this case if a big and quick movement against our position arrives, DD will be big.

So the danger comes with an opposite movement big and QUICK, because big but slow will give our EA time to open trades that will compensate our initial position. But if movement is very quick, EA will not have time to do that, only when the DD is already considerable.

Yes, I´m sure EA will recover but the more DD, the more time it will need, the less profit we will have.

So if you are in situation 2 near Friday news and Weekend Gap, maybe it is a safest approach to remove the EA, close all open orders when they are in profit (on Friday morning for example) and re open the EA on Sunday Evening.

This script will close all open orders.....

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Yes, it looks very good, .................

--- 帖子 #59 ---
first batch closed ! +1.18%

changed pt now to 0.5

max dd was 2.10

--- 帖子 #60 ---
One more closure for each one:
-Full: +11,63% since Thursday morning

-Extreme: +3,14% since today morning

Are these running under the same account with different magic numbers ?

If running the same account, I will try it

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Going with this speed, 100% monthly? gr8 EA at last.... Hope it continues to earn like this...

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Hi Caillou, thanks for this work, certainly looks promising. Also thanks to everyone who contributed to developing this method before you

I'll start demo testing in Extreme and full in Activetrades (ECN) and TDFX (Both $3000 standard account). And will share results when prompted to

Would you recommend starting with a MMTU and Ppct of 0.25?

Cheers

art_phantom_extreme has not taken any trade since i loaded this EA on sunday open.

Settings :standard a/c, equity :5059 $, 500 : 1 leverage, MMTU 0.5, PROFIT 1.0

Calliou : Is there anything i should check to make it to open trades?

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Sometimes this happens for the broker, the min lot size and the min increase. For example I have just noticed that my demo with FXCM for Art_Phantom_Extreme, after 3,14% up, doesn´t open trades, because min lot increase is not 0,01 so just be sure that you have 0.01 increase and your min lot is correct for you MMTU.

I had to stop my demo and reopen a new demo with Alpari UK

--- 帖子 #70 ---
No, different accounts. I´m sure that with only one EA version you will have enough...

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Hi Ian,

I´m not a big fan of small PP. Of course it is too early but in my demo test with Art Phantoms, Six Phantoms and Basket EAs a -1% DD is extremely easy to reach, so it would be easy to reach too with the same trades the same PP.

That´s why I have a PP:1.0 but as I said it´s too early....

--- 帖子 #77 ---
The settings is for me to try out and see whether safe to use this to rescue my dying mini live account

The next batch is set with a higher PPCT ( with a dollar profit target of $22) and putting in place MPTM's basket trailing profit ( start trail at +$6 and trailing by 80% of profit )

Stay Tune

First Closure +0.96%, 5 trades, 45 min, 22 pips movement, amazing !!!

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Caillou you seem to be getting far better results than mine (I've got 7 trades in light DD for the last 4 hours, almost all of them losers except for two small winners), are you using the settings from the first post?

Somewhere in one of the related phantom threads mentioned that the precise moment you start running the EA has very high impact on its profitability, it makes sense to me since the first trade pretty much determines how are all the following going to keep flowing.

Do you have any comments on this?

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Hi,

Yes, the same settings from post 1. How much DD are you talking about ? And 4 hours is nothing, EA could recover from 4, 8, 12 hours or more.

And yes, someone said in Basket 14 thread that the start time has very high impact, true but only for the first closure, the next start time is absolutely random so I don´t really care about start time.

We have to be patient, one closure in 45 min is not habitual, is great but not habitual. We have to test this EA in 2 concepts:

1.- How quick it reach target: very quick.

2.- How quick it could recover from DD: we have to see that.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
second batch closed, pp 0.5.

third one also, makes a 2.35 % for the last 24 hours.

g/u, e/u, eu/gbp did not close yet

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Cointegration helps create a stationary series or non-stationary series to trade counter-trend/trend respectively depending on the type of cointegration you apply. The idea is that distribution that is cointegrated will always come back to a mean that you are optimizing for. I'm sure LTCM did this and failed because they doubled down every time it went against them... and the spread between the russian bonds and others went too high it caused LTCM to get margin calls essentially. The fact that you only need one situation to lose makes it almost impossible to profit in this type of environment in the long run. You can win 99 million ways and be happy but that 1 situation will take all profits from the 99 million pops.

I'm now looking at applying R:R to choose the trades that I desire.. not necessarily hedged to achieve a goal without losing your shirt. What I get from these types of EA's is the idea of "not putting all your eggs in one basket"

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Hi guys,

I have been running the 3.30_suv (Full Art version), on a live account since Thursday 18th Nov (4 days). Although there is obviously differences in the times we are starting our EA's and also in the risk applied and target percent. i am finding the live results are slow compared to what you are all getting on demo accounts.

This is most likely due to the odd trade not being entered compared to the demo account (or the odd trade being placed that the live account didn't have), since most brokers demo data is crap.

My results to date:

Using 0.3 MMTU and PP taeget of 0.25 giving a lot size of 0.02 mini lots i am achieving on average about 1 close per day. I am going to double the MMTU to 0.6 to see if this will speed up the closers.

I am ok with this result and as it compounds it will grow the account nicely (assuming there isn't a big blow out for the next year or two....

The good news is that the max DD has only reached about -0.75% and margin used has maxed out at about 10%. This is extremely encouraging as the EA has been operating through all the Asian sessions and over the weekend. (And I am running live on IBFX 50:1 leverage- so it would be tiny margin used on other brokers)

I would suggest we all go to small live test accounts as I think there will be issues with poor data quality and some unrealistic expectations from demo accounts.

EA recomendations (for some programmer.... I know you can't do the coding Caillou)

1/ Include a start and finish time entry window that allows for a trade sequence to begin only within a time period. Having an equity pop late in the US session and then getting a new trade sequence start with 12 hours of sideways movement only creates DD and margin usage as equity pops in this period are low. I believe this is an important function for a more efficient live traded EA.

2/ Have a max % stop loss for a fail safe (so that if a trade sequence drops below a certain DD all trades will close out. and the EA will look to start again at the next session start time based on point 1).

I think these are needed to truely trade this EA live on a bigger account.

Will keep you posted on live results.

Tim

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Great post Timmy and I agree that the 2 recomendations that you have suggested will enhance this EA big time. Many thanks for sharing this Timmy.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
For no 1, the trading time must be revisable. I didn't test Jag_Phantom because it is hardcoded and the EA reads the timing wrongly on my platform. For example, when it is suppose to be Asian session, the EA reports London session.

For no 2, this is easily achieveable by MPTM. However, after closing by MPTM, have to test further whether EA will reset accordingly. I didn't see it doing that and I have resorted to manual closing when I am trying out the basket trailing stop

If you are like me trying out with MPTM, watch out the dollar profit target. I saw dollar profit target flicking from zero to designated amount, designated amount to zero. However, after several restarts of the MT4, the problem didn't come around.

Hi Guys,

Here is some discussion on how the risk grows and what we can do about it.

Firstly let me say that the whole idea of these baskets is to allow the imperfect hedge to naturally dampen down the volatility within the trade sequence and so minimise the DD. We need this situation - and risk - to achieve our profit targets.

So how do we get drawdown within the trade sequence (open basket)? It occurs when we get a solid move in one direction and those pairs that are in the positive at the trade entry time (be it every hour or 30min etc) will effect a series of trade entries, we then get a sharp and strong reversal that takes some time for the other counteracting pair(s) to effect a 'dampening' of the trade sequence through the pseudo hedging process.

So you will always see the most risk to the trade after a big move in one direction - such as either a move from a larger DD position towards profit, or a solid move that takes the position close to our PP target (if the initial DD is small).

SO why not do the following to eleviate some of this risk:

Reaccess the entry for the Phantom basket for the rebalancing pairs only (since they would at this point be well into the negative - and unable to help rebalance at this stage if there is a reversal). So they have a better chance of giving a trade entry to begin to effect the hedge as the market reverses. This rebalance does not mean these pairs would open trades on a small reversal, but would start to open trades if there was X % of a reversal on the main pair(s) that are driving the sequence towards an equity pop. And only after the net contract risk was X dollars (or cents depending on account size) per pip movement.

So in other words the number of trades in one direction has to be causing a net contract risk of X per pip movement (this defines just how big our exposure is at the time i.e. how many one sided trades are open) and then if X % of a pullback occurs (this defines our potential acceptable risk for volatility increased DD) - then the EA resets the zero point for the rebalancing pair(s). So the EA can then effect the pseudo hedge more efficiently and rebalance if the reversal continues.

I know that there are reconfiguring versions out there is Phantom Addsix land but these reconfigure all pairs... but I am referring only to the rebalancing pair(s) (triggered only on the processes above) and of course if the market goes strongly the other way after this rebalance then the EA would look at doing the same for the old pairs that would now be needed to rebalance the hedge yet again.

Hope you can follow me...

I think this and my other recomendations should allow the EA to function as it should without allowing to much DD and give us a system that has limited risk, but trades as it should.

I wouldn't get to cute with changing the trade sizes etc during the normal functioning of the EA - this won't change the direct risk dynamics. We just want some risk management around the most risky period for the trading sequence - that being when a potential sharp DD situation could arise after a strong move (and lots of one sided open positions) followed by a strong reversal.

Tim

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Hi,

I agree the trading time start and Finish window (obviously the EA would continue trading beyond this time if there is an open trade sequence), needs to be a variable.

I have never tried the Jag versions as he is running six pairs active.  I assume the MPTM is a close all function?

Doesn't sound like the coding is that good anyways.....

Phantom3_30_suv :

16 open trades. Started placing trades since sunday open. Basket did not close yet. Lowest margin 421 % on MMTU 1.0 and Profit 1.0 setting.

I will watch out tonight what it does. Comparativeley, lighter version works very well with another broker demo a/c.

MA_Phantom_extreme : I loaded this alpari demo a/c and since sunday open it has not placed any trade. Can you guys guide me, what could be wrong with it? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Phantom3_suv :

Next basket got closed. Present equity 5668 $. Equity up by 13.3 % since 17 nov. 4 Trading days. 3.32 % per trading day. Cheers !

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Some of the things you can check:

No 1) Anything wrong as seen from the EA's comments? for example, dollar profit target is zero

No 2) Check whether the infamous global variables are still around. There should be one whole list of global variables starting with the related magic number. If there isn't any, you have to restart the MT4.

Regards

Ian

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Malim,

se the chart wherin i loaded the EA. All seem to be fine but not taking any trades.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Hi Tim

MPTM ( ManageByMagicNumber, Basket stop loss settings )

Do watch out for the dollar profit target flickering problem as I have described earlier. It will start appearing once you set MPTM to work. If you didn't see any flickering, it will be okay

Regards

Ian

--- 帖子 #93 ---
What about the Global Variables messing up this EA? Read something about it, I don't remember in which phantom thread.

Should we delete them from time to time? I've noticed they do refresh constantly

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Valid and creative points made Tim, if the EA can be coded to reset the zero point for the rebalancing pairs, I will certainly trial it with interest! You are indeed a thinker.

On another point I agree that the start trading time should be variable. Major volatility occurs during the London session, so why not open the EA at Frankfurt open and conclude trading after the basket closes at 1% PP? Then rinse and repeat. The likelyhood of 1% being achieved at this stage would seem to be far higher during this period (granted more testing needed!). Why be greedy?

I'm from Oz so a variable starting time is not so important for me, but for those sleeping it would be ideal.

I will set up additional platforms to test this volatility period from Frankfurt open and see...

Other than that, the only thing would be the Phantoms start prices will be refreshed when you either Change Time Frames, Remove then Add the EA again, Change an EA setting, Restart MT4 terminal, etc, etc - you get the picture.

Not much of an issue really.

EDIT:

If you do see the Phantoms being reset as an issue, please follow my instructions in the following post:
http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...33#post4171933

When all the trades are closed, that's the only time it will reset the Phantoms, as it does currently.

Caillou：

art_phantom_light open 4 positions of buy eurjpy on Monday morning.  of coz, now i am in serious DD now.

one suggestion that I've thought about long ago is that the EA should avoid entering new position at a similar level.  for example, the 1st eurjpy is at 6 pips profit, in fact, this is not a significant proof telling EA "market is good, enter more", but the EA in fact did enter the 2nd pos(in my case, even, 3rd and 4th) when market in fact did NOT move at all.

In other words, if a pair remain a few pips positive, but not moving for 3 or 4 hours, the EA will enter quite a few positions.  Then if market starts moving against us, we'll be in serious drawdown.

this is my suggestion: all previous positions have positive pips at least 20(just an example, or 100) is the prerequisite to enter more pos. instead of previously, all pos have profit > 0.

to test your idea, it may be as simple as changing

if (PL_Array[i] > 0.0 &&

to

if (PL_Array[i] > 20.0 &&

or

if (PL_Array[i] > 100.0 &&

whatever dollar value u prefer.

Give it a shot?

Whoever is trading live.. careful.

my idea was to open strongest pair according to pip value which the specified pair is moving. So from the certain Phantom point we open every pair which made at least 20 pip move from the opening price of Hour candle.. But that would be totaly different EA and I dont wanna hijacK THIS THREAD..

--- 帖子 #105 ---
This is interesting for our analysis.  I had a live sequence close out at the open of Monday after making the equity pop due to the weekend gap.  So i ended up getting a new sequence start at the open of Monday also.  However as I am running the 'full' version (ie looks for trades every 15th and 45th minute) it had twice the chance to balance out the negative E/J trades (I had three of these early on Monday).  It gave me several U/J trades and this helped balance out the trade sequence.  Then as the market tanked I had a series of 8 E/U trades which cleaned me out for a nice profit.  This is exactly how the EA should work - and this is on a live account.

Some observations;

1/  How come you have such a big DD issue?  Why did you not get any hedging trades?  This seems strange.

2/  Maybe you have got a few hedging trades - but since you can only get one per hour the EA has not been able to rebalance the hedge sufficiently???  Can you confirm?

3/  Or maybe your risk (effectively your MMTU) is to big for your account, thereby creating rapid DD before the EA can rebalance (and possibly exaserbated by point 2)????

We need to understand what happens with this EA when ever anyone gets a DD blow out of any sort.

Can you elaborate on your situation?

-----------

Rather than create an arbitrary barrier to the hedging system of this EA by blocking it from trading every 20 or 100 pips of an existing trade - I think we'd be better off allowing the EA to perform as it is meant to and simply allow the EA to look to trade more often (ie use full or extreme versions) to allow for rebalancing.  Also as I mentioned in earlier posts - we need to effect the risk around the trading process for this EA rather than blocking the way the EA should naturally trade.

Also possibly using smaller contract size would mean a greater chance for the EA to rebalance.  Of course it will also take longer for the EA to close out profits - but I can live with this if it means lower DD due to the EA having more of a chance to balance out if the trend reverses.

Just my thoughts.

(By the way I have tested a similar design trading system using fractal entries and one of the functions we tested was a blocker to stop it trading within x pips of existing trades.  This had a negative impact on the EA's profitablility.  Of course it may not on this EA - but these types of system limitations impact on the direct function of the trading system and often don't add to the system capability/profitability)

Tim

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Hi, Tim, thanks for your comments.  It never occur to me that limitation on system may be negative.  i feel your comments have merits for me...

my case is this:

i have 2000$ in demo (i try to demo with the fund that i may put on LIVE), so 2000$ is good for me.  Alpari UK, 200:1.

i, apparently, misunderstood MMTU, thought it is for the basket (it is for each position, now i know). so I set it as '2'. I set ProfitPCT as '1'.  These two values are much higher than many ppl testing here, i know.  I just wanted to see what happen with larger values, since I want the winning pos to run longer. i know it is wrong now.

then after Monday, 1st day of demoing 'art light', 4 buy eurjpy, 8 sell eurusd, 4 sell usdjpy, were entered.  hedge was not formed impartially.  the DD of 1000$ is mainly caused by eurjpy, but shorts of eurusd do considerably offset the floating loss of eurjpy.

shorts of usdjpy have floating p/l of a few pips generally..... so it is eurusd in the hedge now saving my ass.

i'll keep an eye on how this basket evolve forward, and report back.

any other details needed?

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Thanks Charvo - that explains a lot.  I was a little concerned that your hedging didn't kick in but running MMTU at 2 is going to be a killer - especially with leverage at 200:1.  I trade it live with MMTU 0.6 on a 50:1 leverage account.  PP set for 0.25 (but will likely move this to 0.5 for a larger live account).

Your contract size would be ($2000*2%*200)/10000 = 0.8 lots.  I run a $1200 live acocunt and the lot size is 0.04 lots.  So you are running contracts 20 times bigger for an account that is only 1.67 times bigger!!!  (I know you realise your mistake - just wanted to point out the math to everyone)

-----------

I suspect that the system is more efficient with a higher PP than 0.25 that I am running.  But I want to see if this will allow me to maintain equity pops in good market conditions whilst limiting the chance of bigger DD's based on the idea that for the EA to hit a larger PP we need it to build more positions as it moves in the positive direction - and this means there is a greater chance for a pull back when we have a lot of trades open to hit a larger PP - and hence the chance of the large reversal DD... as discussed earlier.

Also, I just had another equity pop - so far that is three this week.  Max DD -0.54%  And I am up 0.75%

cheers

i got another pop in 'full' ea

anybody doing this manually ? without EA ?

I copy trades from EA to live account manually. its a pain bit there is no other way for me. placing orders is not an issue as i have to do this only at 15, 45 min. but closing the positions when total PL reaches 1% is a problem. as i have to monitor it. i cant be in front of system 24x7.

any other solution ? i am using oanda. is there a script or conditional orders to close the trades ?

Version = Art_Phantom_Extreme

MMTU = 1.0

PPCT = 0.5

Max Float Down = -1.79% ( as shown on screen )

Total Trades = 11

Duration = 12 hours (estimated from 1st trade to closing )

Profit (estimated for 4 batches) +1.7%

Tried basket trailing stop but because of instability didn't continue to try. This is the second day I saw the EA closing with long duration during Asian session.

Stay tune

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Hi Tim,

Regarding MMTU, I understand the calculation for lotsize eg. for my demo:

($500*0.2%*100)/10000 = 0.01 lots, but for Charvo

($2000*2%*200)/10000 = 0.8 lots.

As you have said the MMTU is very high, but how does one account for lot sizes on his statement being at 0.24? One would think according to the calculation that they should be at 0.8 which of course would be absurdly high for the account size.

I'm obviously missing something here and would really appreciate some insight into this!

Hello everyone,

I wake up this morning and I saw so many replies that I have to take time to read carefully.

Tim: as always very good observations. I think too a start and finish time entry could be a very good option for this EA. About % SL I don´t like it, but it is just my opinion, I think it is just a way to feel safer but for me it is more important to try to help the EA to recover for any serious DD situation or to avoid that. For example your Rebalancing Pairs Idea is absolutely brilliant. We need a coder for that.

Roundrock: Art_Phantom_Full is doing better than any other version. I will talk later about that.

The-Game: you are right. This link is MC´s FAQ. It´s a must.
http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=252690

Sidhujag: Thank you for your advice....

Charvo: I absolutely agree with Tim´s reply: "we need to effect the risk around the trading process for this EA rather than blocking the way the EA should naturally trade."

Rondrock: I was with Oanda a few weeks before, for me the best broker I have ever been but I move because I won´t trade manually anymore.

Actually, Lowest Margin: 936,43%, max DD:-9,88%, Floating P/L: -526,02.-$, open trades: 20

Maybe 15 minutes is not enough time to see a significant movement and Art_Phantom_Extreme opens too much trades that overload a pair creating an unbalanced situation too often.

As you can see in the picture, a member of this forum is testing several EA´s (thank a lot again, I hope you don´t bother to publish your results, always anonymous) and results speak for themselves.

It´s too early but with same settings, same start time (Sunday Evening), Art_Phantom_Full is the winner so I will open a new demo with this one and sure we can improve its performance with all your brilliant suggestions.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Pipchaser your broker may only take certain lot sizes and so if your MMTU is calculating a non standard fractional lot size then it may not open trades.  Eg If you broker only takes lot increments of 0.05 and you have a mmtu that is calculating 0.06 lots per trade, your platform may not trade.  Check this out with your broker - you may have to change the mmtu to effect an exact multiple of the brokers lot sizing requirements.

Tim

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Maybe Charvo changed the mmtu and this changed his contract size and only produced a statement for this?  He will have to tell us why his statement shows 0.24 lots and not the calculated 0.8 lots.... not that it really matters now.  But still good to have a full understanding of any potential blow out situation.

Tim

--- 帖子 #118 ---
my Phantom_Extreme freezed for unknown reason after opening 4-5 trade. So, I will test the full version now after readting the potential

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Hi Caillou,

The only reason for an over all % SL is for a worst case scenario.  I wouldn't want to run a large account with this (which I will do in due time), with out the comfort of, say a 20% drawdown emergency stop loss.  Otherwise I agree with you.

This is why I am keen for some nice programmer to come along and code the recommendations we are considering.   They should help create smaller DD's. (Although after 5 days I have had six closes through all types of markets and (so far) the DD has maxed out at a very mild -0.75 percent)

Tim

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Perfect. It could be an option, wich could be use or not. I´m with you, I hope a programmer feel interest and code this suggestions.

Hi Navk,

Of course the more calls the more trades, that´s why I have rejected Extreme version. Between Full and Light, I´m not sure. My Art_Phantom_Full has just closed the first profit 1h30 later, we have to test more.

Obviously if with less trades we reach the same profit, better with less trades, let´s see.....

--- 帖子 #127 ---
I agree with less focus on Art_Phantom_Extreme Caillou, due to greater DD and the sheer number of trades it opens, but the lite version still warrants attention... (all versions opened at the same time, one day after you)

May we add another modified version to the arsenal? OK, great. Artful_Phantom3_Calm_4D, or AP3C4D as we'll all come to know and love it,  only takes new trades 4 times per day at GMT 0, 6, 12, 18.

It closed its first basket after the second trade group. 200:1 leverage, $6200 account using 0.4 MMTI & 1% PP. Max floating DD was 0.13%, lowest margin was 6767.95%. I'm also testing some other settings but I MUCH prefer this version so far.

I also think another EA could be used on the same account with this version as the numb.er of trades won't get out of control.

Testers anyone? Anyone?

Cheers !!

--- 帖子 #132 ---
@ Tim

My lot size 0.24 is actually due to the EA took my previous account balance value of $5000. I had 2000+ DD from last week using other phantom EAs.  I guess that's how the EA's lot size got confused, because on Monday i shut down all other EA only start running 'Art Light'.

And this morning, US. Est, the basket recovered from -800$ to +$300 and closed.  damn, is it luck or algorithm? I need demo more...

Caillou, and Tim, let me know if this is what you want:

when equity reach a negative %, close the biggest loser? or what ?

I did not want to cause unnecessary confusion/mess by adding different versions of EA, but i could try if a mod is advisable and agreed.

Hi TradeRunner

Thank you for this new version. Sure is very interesting. So it is like Art_Phantom_Full with calls each 6 hours. But don´t you think it might missed some big moves like today? And why 0, 6, 12, 18 and not 2, 8, 14, 20?

Sure we have to try but only 2 calls (6 and 12) during London Session I find it very little but time will say.....

Thanks again

Perfect Navk,

Will wait for your results with great interest. We have to compare between Full and Light % Gain and % max DD, difference in gain must be high to choose Full Version because DD would be higher too.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Hi Charvo,

I was referring to closing out the entire position when the equity reaches X% negative.  Only want this as a last resort fail safe.  I would have it set well out from normal DD.  But to trade a decent sized live account this would be usful.

-----

Traderunner - thanks for your version.  I was thinking that it should be an advantage for the EA to trade more often so that it can react more quickly to market reversals.

So the Art Extreme should be more efficient than all other versions.  The key here is to look at the contract size you are getting from your light or full version and devide it accordingly.  So if you are trading 1 lot for example on light - you'd possibly want to trade 0.25 lots for extreme.  (So the MMTU would have to be set accordingly).

I think this would solve the added DD risk based on the total number of trades and it should make the EA more efficient in responding to reversals and so actually improve the DD.  Wouldn't this EA be much more efficient and quicker to react.

Still, the key here for best efficient reversal is the recalculation of the basket balance for the reversal pair(s) so they can open trades more quickly to rebalance the hedge after a big move in our direction followed by a sharp reversal - but only after the value per net pip move within the open trade group reaches 'x%', and there is Y% reversal on the open pair(s) that are driving our open positions to profit. (See my earlier posts).

Again, the addition of an "Allow Trades Window" - with a start and finish time window (set in EA as variables) to allow the EA to begin a trade sequence (and of course it could keep going past this time period for as long as it takes to close out with an equity pop), would also cut down DD as we could ensure that it does not reopen trades during the slow Asian session.

Maybe Traderunner would consider coding these modes....

Tim

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Hi Tim,

Absolutely agree with your start and finish time option.

What I' m not sure is about the better performance of Extreme Version. To take a trade each 15 min could overtrade a pair without enough power to continue the move. I agree with you that it would react more quickly but this could be solved with your "Rebalancing Pairs Mod".

I think this modification could be very interesting....

phantom3_30 (full version ):

Next basket got closed. Present equity 4963 $. Up from 4783 $ since sunday open.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
I haven't had time to get involved here yet but I really like this thread. Thanks Caillou for making it a separate thread. I think it simplifies the input and tracking tremendously.

Charvo, I have posted a couple of times on the other threads about closing biggest losers at a user defined margin level. It is basically just imitating the broker margin call procedure, but at a higher margin so that you never reach the margin call. I'm not sure what you mean by "equity reach a negative %", but I suppose it could be initiated by equity rather than margin.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Keeping a close stop loss target is not ok. We have seen a DD upto 7 to 8 % for certain versions of this EA. Even after reaching that DD, the EA quickly recovers and closes in profit. In my opinion only an emergencY stop ( say when DD reaches above 10 % ) should be considered to close major losing trade..

--- 帖子 #155 ---
Hi Frazerd,

You are welcome here. For those who don' t know who is Frazerd he is one of the creators with MC of this EA' s so with your presence this thread has risen its category.

I like your idea about imitate the broker margin call procedure, it could help the EA to reach profit in difficult situations. Let' s hope someone could code this.

Thanks Frazerd

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Not a creator, MC gets all the credit for that. I have just been helping him with testing and evaluating for quite a long time.

Hello all. Im trading Art Phantom Extreme and Full with fine results.

As Im not coder. Could someone here please be so kind and provide exactly same version of ArtPhantom Extreme "reverse"?

EA puts Sell instead of Buy and vice versa..

As Im permanently in DD (at the end All trades ends in profit) I would like to try reverse EA next to MPTM with Global SL closure set to 0.5 of equity..

I need it for testing purpose only..

And I would be glad to come back with my results..

Thanx Karel

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Here is another possibility. Any time a loser exceeds minus user defined % of Last Flat Equity close it. For example my AddSix_03ax, attached, has 53 open trades. It is a $3000 account. If it had closed any losing trade that reached -.5% (-$15) it surely would have closed long ago. There are currently 18 trades that exceed -$15.

You would not want to make the number too low, because some of those losers could become the winners that contribute to the next equity pop. -.5% seems like a reasonable cut off to me. Any other thoughts on this?

--- 帖子 #159 ---
I made some tweaks to the full strategy and ran through my backtester. I used a $10,000 account balance, traded 2.0 mini lots per trade, and a take profit of $50 per basket. Since I am in the US, I used 50:1 leverage. There are a few other specifications about the strategy that are different from the full EA, but that is not really important at this time.

I started two baskets per day: at 2 AM ET and 8 AM ET. A conservative spread was used, commissions calculated. However swap was not included. The goal of the test was to see if and when we would get some serious drawdown. It is backtesting, so of course it is not perfect. But there were some crazy days over the past 6 months that needed to be looked at.

For November, very nice results...maximum drawdown of -6.47%. Profit over 30%. No real problems.

For October...started getting a little scary. I had a 10% drawdown basket, a 20% drawdown basket and 1 basket that took 28 days to finally close at TP. The account would have survived and made over 30% profit.

For September...well...1 basket closed at my stop loss of $5000. 2 other trades that have not hit stop loss but would still be active to this day - both hitting substantial drawdown. A couple other baskets with over 10% drawdown.

How accurate was the test? Well, that is rather difficult to say. I think it is accurate enough to indicate that there were baskets in the past that the account may not have survived. Thus, chances are very good the account would not survive trading the strategy in the future.

My point: Don't be sucked in by the nice performance you are seeing in these few days of trading. Obviously, there are market conditions in the past (and most likely in the future) that could kill your account.

One other thing...the exact time the Phantom trades are opened for a basket is very significant. I've seen baskets take over 20 hours to close using a certain time for the open of the Phantom trades. But then changing the open of the Phantom trades by just a minute or two and the basket closed in less than an hour.

--- 帖子 #160 ---

Unless he converted the code into mql5 and ran it through MT5 terminal there is no way you can backtest a multipair strategy in MT4 terminal.

It is like the trim and reverse concept but without reversing because EA already does that adding winnings pairs (oposite from loosing pairs). I've always thought that cut loosers is a profitable approach.

Caillou,

I wrote a custom script to backtest.

The attached file contains summary statistics of the 3 month test. Detailed stats are available but I don't feel like accumulating all that data.

By the way, before I made several tweaks to the strategy, I compared the results of my backtest with the demo results you had posted on that external website - the results were surprisingly quite consistent.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion.

It is just so incredibly slow to test different variations of these strategies using forward testing on demo accounts. To me, it makes more sense to use history data to get general ideas of how strategies perform under different conditions.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Mate, don't get defensive, I obviously had no idea you can backtest a multipair strategy like you have done.

I said that because when you go into Strategy Tester, it only allows you to pick one pair to backtest with and that's it.

Congrats to you for being able to backtest this multipair strategy in MT4.

Mind sharing the scripts?  I'm intrigued how you did this.

It may be a profitable approach if done on a moderate scale. Trim and reverse did not work well because the reverse trade, more often than not, became a loser too. MC and I tried a basket strategy several months ago that trimmed biggest loser every 8 hours. That also did not work.

I think that closing only very large losers might work well, especially with these EAs which we have now refined to the point of only needing to figure out how to limit the number of trades it takes to close and prevent large DD. We already know that they can recover from a pretty large DD, but it takes time and time is money, plus there is certainly a limit to how much DD they can handle.

ZZ's programming is way beyond the pathetic strategy tester in MT4.  however, multipair backtesting is for sure not impossible, and it is realised in other threads if you read into them (like t101's method).  I personally believe that ZZ's backtesting is trustworthy.

Hi Caillou.

I think the AP3C4D version may catch the big moves just as well as the others as it did today. The one account that closed had only five open trades and two other accounts "lounged" around all afternoon in about 0.5% profit. Had those been a live account I might have decided to close manually but still, they had only 6 open trades.

Of course it's too early to tell but I can only say that I'm much more satisfied with the AP3C4D than with any other version. Far fewer trades and much less draw down and maybe just as profitable. There's also (so far) plenty of margin and equity left for manual trading or for using another EA.

I'll see how it goes..............

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Frazerd, i'll try to come up with your mod first.

it is great suggestion, and fit my trading mindset too.

if someone also read nanningbob's v5 thread, this is the key improvement recently he got.  similarly, if a trade is not profitable in 8 hours, he close it.  this is very similar to your suggestion..

phantom3_30 (full version ):

Next basket got closed, present equity 5010 $. Up from 4783 $. 4.75% since sunday open, 21 st nov.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
I have been trimming losers on phantom6-01x. I do it manually because I couldnt figure out how to code what I do. Its probably easy enough to code but my programing skills are primative at best. Anyway I close out any trade that reaches negative  2x the $ profit target. Example if $profit target is $10.00 I close any trade that reaches -20.00. Now I dont have any proof that this works because I would have to run 2 demos and trim one and not the other. But for me it seems to be working out ok as the few trades I did trim ending up being even bigger losers.

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Extreme version:

One more basket got closed. Present equity 5276 $. up from 5059 $ since today 22 nd nov.. Good result in a day !

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Keep us posted on results.  When we have another big market move and everyone checks in with results we can compare to yours (roughly) and see how your version went.

I like the idea - just aren't sure that you will catch those moves during fast market action.  Six hours gap is a long time between drinks.

but has the basket closed in profot (considering the losses taken from losers) ?

pl post your EA, i can add that code to clsoe the loser that reaches x times the dollar profit.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
if the results are true and accurate, then i have a solution for this huge DD issue.

lets say in a month you get DD above 10% 3 times. or take 5% DD 4-5 times. dont take the trades as per the original EA. let EA run and get into 5% DD, now buy/sell this basket so that you are ahead of others by 5%. set the PP at 5% (anyway basket will recover the DD). with this approach, you can tame the DD issue. you cant blow out your account, because that would have required 5 times the account to blow out by the original EA

this 5% can be variable. you will get less opportunities with 5% DD as most baskets close below that number. so you are missing those profits. but when you get that 5% DD basket your PP is 5%, so you recover some. overall this may not give same PL as original EA, but surely wont blow out yr account.

to test this concept, have 2 accounts. on account1 start EA. if and when the DD reaches 5%, start EA on account2 with PP 5% and watch this account2.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Hi zznbrm,

Good work!  Please continue with your testing and provide any and all testing analysis.

Some analysis of your results.

1/  Do your results reflect the combined effect on the account of both EA's combined DD's - since you were running two baskets per day?

2/  Can you run one copy of the EA and have it run 24/5 through the sample period you were testing for - so we can see it enter after the close out of the last equity pop.  These usually occur during times of high volatility and so further equity pops can occur in quick succession.  The way you have them opening at a stated time each day means the EA is unable to take advantage of further trade flows.

3/  Your risk is MASSIVE, you are currently trading 50 times my position size for an account that is only 8 times bigger than my little live account ($1200).  For five days in the market I have taken out 9 equity pops or approx 2.25% profit in a week of live trading.  Since my risk is much lower than yours I have only had -0.75% max DD to date. (Sure it's only 5 days...)

4/  I can live with 8- 10% per month profit (compound this for over 100% p.a.).  I appreciate that I would not have a risk 1/50th of your risk - but it will be WAY smaller than what you were seeing.  So a risk of, lets say 20% of your worst DD ~50%, so I might see a ~10% DD (just a guesstimate), based on your results.  (Note my profit result is disproportionate to yours since my EA is running 24/5 and not just twice per day.  So, like yesterday, I get multiple equity pops (four for the day).  At 0.25% each.

5/  Assuming realistic risk management is applied then the primary issue as Frazerd/Caillou mentioned is that the trade sequences that run for many days will cause us to miss out on profit.  So it would be sensible - if you are trading with good risk management (and therefore conservative DD), to open a second EA on the same pairs, that will likely keep spitting out the equity pops (simply because it will be started at a different time and day from the first) - maybe in a sub account. This could be initiated if we are stuck in a sequence for more than ~3 days.  Once the original EA spits out a profit - go back to just one EA running...???

I would be keen for you to test the EA over the same period with more concervative risk and if possible maintain it running on the basis of 24/5 as we are.  And, if possible, add a second EA to trade whenever the original goes for more than ~3 or 4 days.

Please do not take my comments as criticism.  I am really keen to see more of your analysis.  Especially why/how the EA ended up being stuck in a sequence for so many days.  What was the specific dates and what was the market doing that created this situation....

Thanks

Tim

but has the basket closed in profot (considering the losses taken from losers) ?

Hi Roundrock,

Yes, it has closed multiple times. Please keep in mind that when you close a loser (or winner for that matter) your equity does not change, only your balance. We dont care about balance only that equity reaches our target.

I dont want to hijack the thread with a phantom 6 ea so this will be the last post over here. This is the EA Im running. Its the basic Phantom6_01x only change is I use different pairs than tthe original.

Hi Caillou,

Here is the screen shot. I started the EA with default setting, and balance of 10K. Still no position open till now.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Hi Thorn, Roundrock

This may work well as it won't disrupt the trading system for the EA.  All you are doing is extending the profit requirement based on the equity target being the same at all stages.

Roundrock can you recode a version of the Art full with this worst trade close out function in it?  (Full being the best version so far I think).  Also can you make it a variable that uses a multiple of the $ target value.  So 2 x $target would mean any trade that exceeds this $ value would close - and it has to be the worst looser also.

I think it is worth testing further.

Tim

--- 帖子 #184 ---
here you go.... i added a external parameter CutLoserMultiplier, you can change this from default 2 to whatever number. this is a multipler of Dollar Profit. losing trade should have a loss greater than this to cut short...

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Thanks Roundrock,

I will set up a couple of demos and run them at same time. One with the trim and one without. It will probably take a few weeks of trading to see if it makes a big difference.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Timmy,

You can copy the code off that phantom6_01x_A EA that roundrock coded up for me. I think it does what you are looking for.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Well, I guess it is better to be defensive than offensive.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
here you go ...

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Thanks charvo!

Each basket was a separate test. Each basket started with $10,000.

I did not run the EA for my tests. I created a customized script to perform the tests.

But yes, the idea is to eventually run my test script in the same way the EA runs. I just have not done so yet. Again, the results I posted were for a particular test case - to determine the kinds of drawdowns to be expected over a 3-month period for particular set of inputs.

As I stated, I really just wanted to point out that the last few days were pretty good for this type of strategy. For the one set of tests I posted, you can see that Nov was very good, but Oct and Sept were not as promising.

I used the same risk Caillou was using for his tests. He posted results on an external site - looked like a $10,000 account trading 0.2 lots. I assumed it was a standard account. So, for this test I though it would make sense for me to use something comparable - 2.0 lots on a $10,000 account (MBTrading account...similar to a mini account). I have messed around with many variations (lot size, tp size, minimum margin levels, leverage) - you only saw the output of one of those variations.

I hope your live trading continues in a positive direction.

I'm not thinking about profit per month or anything like that (not yet anyhow). I'm trying to determine the effectiveness of the strategy during all (most) market conditions.

That is all something to think about as the strategy progresses.

I appreciate your observations. Yes, it is obvious to me that the strategy will have many successful trades regardless of risk/tp levels. However, as is the case with all strategies, I am more interested in the bad days and how I can minimize the impact of these days on the profitability of the strategy.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
wow, you quick, RR.

i just finished my mod per frazerd's suggestion:

when margin level drops to an alarming level, the EA will close the biggest losing position, until the margin level rise over the alarming level again.

though it might do same thing as yours, i think that i just upload incase it is useful to anyone.

mine is based on art_phantom_light.mq4, and my coding may be easily moved to the other versions.  if you open the code, search for "charvo added", those are the lines that I added on Caillou's original coding.

there are two new external var:

1. LowMarginKillLoser, this is the switch, if true, the "kill biggest loser" is in effect.

if false,  the EA is exactly same as Caillou's original.

2. AlarmingMarginPer, this is the % of margin level that will trigger the "kill biggest loser" function, of coz, when 'LowMarginKillLoser" is set true.

default is 500, means 500% is the lowest % margin the EA will stand.

Also, on screen comments, under margin info, there is one more line stating the alarming margin level.

there is very slight chance for a bug, if there is, let me know, please.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Hi Charvo,

Better to code your ExitBiggestLoser() function in the following way, since MC is already tracking the Biggest Loser Real Trade.

Inserted Code void ExitBiggestLoser()
{
if (BiggestLoserTicket > 0)
{
OrderSelect(BiggestLoserTicket , SELECT_BY_TICKET, MODE_TRADES);
if ( OrderType() == OP_BUY )  OrderClose( OrderTicket(), OrderLots(), MarketInfo(OrderSymbol(), MODE_BID), 5, Red );
if ( OrderType() == OP_SELL ) OrderClose( OrderTicket(), OrderLots(), MarketInfo(OrderSymbol(), MODE_ASK), 5, Red );
}
}

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Charvo,

If the margin is less than 500 %, it cuts down biggest looser, ok. In that case, the overall basket will be loser considering the fact that it had already accepted loosing trade?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
dang, thanks a lot, man.  i didn't pay my attention there.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
the fact is the EA will start accept losing trades, and stoploss happened.

however, the overall basket might recover faster, this is the point frazerd elaborated at the other phantom EA thread.

take an example, you have 3 pos of eurusd, -100 pip, -200 pip, and -300 pips.  these -600 pips make your account lower than 500% margin.  then EA starts killing the -300 pips pos.  after the pos is stopped, the account is only having two pos, -100 and -200.  and the EA now has better chance to recover and close back at 'profitpct'.

or in the above example, the -100 and -200 pos may be +10, and +50, so after -300 is stopped, the EA's basket is now in positive side.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
That's okay   This way it will guarantee that you close "THE" Biggest Loser.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
So the overall is -300 +10+50 ? This my question.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Thanks for this roundrock. It is exactly what I was looking for in my earlier post except it's based on ProfitTarget rather than Last Flat Equity, same difference since Profit Target is based on Last Flat Equity.

And now I have it for the 3 pair EAs as well. Thanks again for that.

Thanks to you also, charvo. No, it does not do the same thing as roundrock's mod. In fact, I may try using both of these in one EA. I figure the rounrock mod will come into play first and close only losers that exceed the CutLoserMultiplier * Dollar Profit Target and in most cases that will keep the margin above whatever margin level I use for your mod. Then on rare occassions when margin does reach that margin level, your mod kicks in. I think they might work well together.

Thanks again to both of you guys.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
A recap on the 3 versions guys (all opened with a $500 acc.100.1 lev, 0.01 lots, 1%PP on the 22/11):

Extreme: too many trades accumulating due to 15 minute opens (28 trades still open after 24 hours as I write this).

MFDDown: -14.62%

Balance: 518.60

Equity: 457.65

Will jettison.

Hard: 13 trades still open after 15 hours.

MFDDown: -4.91%

Balance: 526.44

Equity: 504.33

Will monitor

Lite: 4 trades open for five hours

MFDDown: -1.41%

Balance: 546.42

Equity: 546.67

Much smaller baskets overall and comes to PP rapidly. Check out the stats:

https://www.myfxbook.com/portfolio/phantomlite/65693

I know its early days but I'm opening a small live account using the lite version today 20 minutes after Frankfurt open. This will allow the pairs to better establish themselves for a potential trade open at 15 minutes into London open. Will keep you posted...

--- 帖子 #199 ---
yes, this is in fact also what i wanted/posted at the phantom thread long ago: use a hard stoploss for individual pairs...

i strongly recommend that you allocate some serious consideration to this 3 pairs version, since i figure/feel that 3 pairs are more sensitive to overall(14 pairs) market movement, and not easily trapped in drawdown like 6 pairs originals.  In other words, when 3 pairs are all traded by the EA, they are the top and bottom of 14 pairs ranking(i understand this right?), their momentum are stronger, therefore the move will be longer, usually.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Be careful trading live as I found that your MM is wrong. Your Extreme and Hard version are trading at $0.01 per pips while the Lite versions is trading at $0.10 per pips.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
In all three versions I've set  MMTU at 0.2 (0.01 lotsize) which is 10 cents per pip. Same setup with live lite.

Hi Zznbrm,

Thanks for sharing your results. What I think it is sure is that we have to "cut loosers" in some way in order to help EA to recover quickly.....

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Please check your myfxbook Hard and Extreme profile. They are trading at $0.01 per pips. Only Light verison is trading at 10 cents per pip.

Example your EURUSD trading on 23/11/2010 Phantomfull, which closed with 108.3 profit - earn $11.09. That about 1 cent per pips.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
I agree with you that the less trades the small DD but we have to control too the gain.....

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Guys, to prevent that this post has 1000's of different versions of the 3 basic EA's isn't the following a good idea? :

If someone can combine post #192 with Roundrock's modification of the CutLooserMultiplier and post #194 with Charvo's Low Margin Kill Looser modification (with The Game's suggestion in post #195) for all the tree versions and pm that to Caillou. Then he can put those versions in post one with the normal names (as the new default EA's) and a brief explanation of the new variables and of course a thank you for the ones who came with the mods.

(Maybe set the CutLooserMultiplier with a default high number and the LowMarginKillLooser by default on false to keep it simple for newbies who haven't read the whole thread?)

This way I hope to prevent this thread being "littered" with a lot of different version. The most "die hard" followers of this tread like these two ideas, and so does Caillou I believe. So why not make this the standard?

PS. By the way. Thanks all for the contribution so far! A lot happened here last night when I was asleep  !

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Thank you Roundrock,

I will test it....

--- 帖子 #208 ---
A good mod too Charvo but don' t you think it is better a title for the EA without your name, just my opinion....

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Want to give everyone some perspective on how the dynamic of this system works.  We HAVE to find a way to stop huge drawdowns, a death trap is waiting for us if we don't do it.

I partially rewrote the same concept to MT5 using 6 pairs to get an idea of how it performs, see the attached graph.

As you can see it took about two years to fall down to hell,.  But the thing is it can happen any time, this needs to be solved.

This is NOT accurate, as the multi currency tester in MT5 is still faulty, but it gives you a good idea.

Also this is not the original code, but it does not matter, I tested almost every variation of entries, entry times, different baskets etc they all reach the same conclusion sooner or later.  But I don't even have to tell you this because it is obvious the EA cannot go on forever without losing.

We need some sort of way to stop the losers, I know there is already an EA doing this will test it sometime this week.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
I think it is a good idea. If you send me a pm with each mod for each 3 versions with a brief description about the mod I will post in 1 ( please an EA name wich describes the mod, not the author)

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Thanks for that RoundRock.

For the short term I think one other mod mode is crucial.  A start sequence/ Finish sequence mod.  So that we can ensure that trade sequences only start after the Asian session.

Look at today (GMT) for example.  We had the big move down and then all through the Asian session it has been consolidating.

As a result the Art Full version that I am running live (P3.30_suv) made three nice equity pops through the big move down and has then opened a bunch of trades that have simply pushed up the DD (although still not that big for my risk), as the market has moved sideways but with some volatility.

I think this is a major drawdown saving mod!!!!!!!  If it can be restricted to open from early Europe and not allow it to reinitiate trade sequences after midday US session i believe it will save significantly on DD over time. (Obviously if trading sequence is active after the finish time the EA just continues with that sequence until the equity pop.)

Roundrock are you able to code in this one to your 'A' version??????

Thanks

Tim

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Thanks for that Saidar.  Yes it will always produce a death trade at some stage when you don't run stops (although most trading systems will invariably do so also).  The trick is to limit the risk but NOT the trading system.

Tim

--- 帖子 #213 ---
YES !!!!, you read my mind Tim. I have never had a good performance during Asian Session with any EA version, only adding trades without sense and after that London Session has to recover. I think like you that we don' t have to trade Asia, only from 8h00 to 20h00 (GMT+2) for example. If Roundrock could code this, DD will decrease significatively, maybe we wouldn' t need to use "A" cutter, who knows.......

--- 帖子 #214 ---
A good idea will be to remove an x amount of money from your account every y months, so that if the death trade happens you don't lose everything.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Pleased I am not alone on this.  Hopefully he can do this.

Tim

--- 帖子 #216 ---
And I would go further: if a basket is still open after 20h00 (GMT+2), the EA would close the basket at Breakeven....all possible to avoid Asian Session

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Saidar - unfortunately that won't really help.  It is no different to running a max SL percent.  This is what Roundrock has coded for us.  So while we look to limit the DD through various mods- we at least have the assurance that their is a 'death trade escape parashute'.

The best way to use the overall max SL percent function (or what ever Roundrock has called it) is to establish what sort of average risk we are getting and set the max % SL at greater than, say 3 standard deviations away..... the only trouble is we have to rely on faulty MT5 for an approximate idea of what constitutes less than 96% of all Draw Downs.  But this would be better than nothing  - so please keep at it Saidar for your analysis.

But would help to know over what time was your equity curve running, and what was your risk (MMTU, Account size, leverage).  Also can you calculate the max DD figure that incorporates ~96% of all DD's in your sample period??

Thanks

Tim

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Saidar and Zznbrm,

Is it possible to know results for a limited time trading, for example from 8h00 to 20h00 (GMT+2) ?

Thank you

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Yes maybe this would also help....maybe.  But make that mod capable of being turned on or off as a variable so we can test out seperately.

Hi all,

Started running the above version on a small live account on Monday (Australia) open.

Equity - $1100, MMTU - 0.1, pt - 1.0 .

5% up as of now with maximum DD of 2.73%. This is the most consistent performance and least DD I have had with any version.

I intend to set StopAfterNoTrades to true on Friday morning with a view to not having any positions over the weekend. I will then start afresh Monday open so I do not need to worry about opening gaps or catastrophic events over the weekend.

I try to think in these terms. 255 trading days/year. If you trade 235 of them and you can average 0.5%/day with a $10000 account you will end up with 32000. If we can average 1% that swells to 102000. Compounding is a marvelous thing.

So far so good. Thanks to all the brilliant coders out there.

Regards.

--- 帖子 #225 ---
@Caillou,

first of all thank you for taking MC's EA to a higher level. I like it a lot.

Like I mentioned in the thread before, it is maybe better if the new ideas/mods  would be melted in the tree basic EA's to prevent the thread to be  filled with too many different version. That way everybody is trying  different version so the results are too hard to compare.

Please take a look at this version. I'm no coder either, but copy pasted the mod's post #192,#194 and input from #195 together. THANKS FOR THESE MODS !!!!

Feel free to test this one. If you and the other people here like this version, i will "make" the FULL DELUXE and EXTREME DELUXE also.

Also notice that the CutLoserMultiplier is set to 3 and the LowMarginKillLooser is on by default and is set to 200. Play with these settings

All we need now is the option to select the trade hours!

EDIT: If you don't want to use the CutLoserMultiplier (CLM), set it at a high number like 999. If you don't want to use the LowMarginKillLooset (LMKL) set it on false. That way you have the "normal" light version with a different display while running.

I am doing the same Caillou, I will open lite daily during Frankfurt open with the expert setting "stop after no more trades" set to true.

I'm in Australia so I can do this on a daily basis manually, that way we can minimise the drawdown that can occur during the Asian session meanderings.

I'm happy with 1% a day...

5% per week

Just had a thought for you guys trying out roundrocks mod that will trim losers. If you are using a US broker you may run into a problem trying to trim a loser because of first in first out(FIFO) rules. I ran into this problem on my IBFX demo when I trimmed manually as sometimes the big loser isnt the first trade on a pair. Should work fine on a non-US broker. Leave it to my government to screw up another good idea.

Phantom_Full

Starting $10,000.

Leverage 100:1.

MMTU 0.8

PP 0.2

+$110.65 (~1%) after about 24 hrs trading.

Lost count of how many basket pops.

DD -3.5%

Should I increase MMTU or PP for better performance?

Timings Coding

--------------

Caillou,

The values I used here will stop the EA from Adding trades between 00:00 and 10:00 (GMT+2), which is during the Asian Session.

The EA will still be able to close trades even if the open trades go into the Asian Session.

In the external variables section at the top add these lines:

Inserted Code extern bool   UseTradingHours     =    true;
extern int    StartHour           =      10;
extern int    FinishHour          =       0;

On the first line inside the AddIfNeeded() function, insert these lines:

Inserted Code   if (UseTradingHours &&
TimeHour(TimeCurrent()) >= FinishHour &&
((TimeHour(TimeCurrent()) < StartHour && StartHour != 0) ||
(TimeHour(TimeCurrent()) < 24 && StartHour == 0)))
{
ResetPhantoms();
return(0);
}

I haven't tested this yet obviously, should work fine though.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Made a mistake... Timings coding is off limits until I say so.

Your EA won't trade! D'OH!

EDIT: Okay Caillou, you can use the timings code now

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Sorry I wish i could program.  Do you mean StartHour = 0 and FinishHour = 10.  If so this is different in your code you show in your post??? (You have it the opposite way around there.)

Also you mention that it will "stop the EA adding trades".  Does this actually mean that it will simply stop a new trade sequence opening up in this time period?  Or stop an existing trade sequence from adding any further trades during the designated time period???  We need the former.  If you mean the latter is not what we are after....

Sorry to get on your case - just need to understand what exactly you are working towards with this mod..

Thanks

Tim

--- 帖子 #246 ---
What I posted is what I meant.

Basically StartHour is when you want the EA to start being able to add trades

FinishHour us when you want the EA to stop adding more trades.

The second bit of coding basically makes the EA stop adding trades when the current hour is between the FinishHour and StartHour.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Does both

EDIT: I'm going to get some much needed sleep now  zzzZZZzzz

Phanotom3_suv ( lighter version )

Since yesterday, the basket has opened 13 trades with a DD of 3.6 % ( 214 $ ) and margin 610 %. Yet to close.

--- 帖子 #254 ---
I'll work on that tomorrow unless someone else gets to it before me.

BTW, why would you still want to add trades during the Asian Session if this is the session you want to stay out of?

Anyways, sleeping time for me now, later!

--- 帖子 #255 ---
If it stops entering trades for an existing trade sequence during the Asian session - it will be drastically interfering with the function of the EA.  I wouldn't use this mod in this form.

We only want to have a start and Finish period for the EA to start a trade sequence.  Inside this period it can open new sequences - outside the period it cannot.  At any stage if a sequence is running then the EA can continue to add positions as normal whether in the Asian time period or not.  (So if it starts a sequence right at the end of your time period window, it might still run through the Asian session.)  Caillous additional option was to have it close out any trade sequence  at the begining of the Asian session if you happen to have one still open by then.

Hello all, I have been participating on this and the other thread about basket trading for months. And tested diff version. I appreciate all fellow traders' contributions. Am waiting for the final version with timing and Roundrock's cut loser mod combined. Hope that will be our final destination.

Edit:  Also if one day the timing plus cut loser combined version is created, anyone has any suggestion on concerns about the time? What I mean is that diff brokers have diff GMT, not sure how to set those values correctly, and also we need to take day light saving into account?

LF

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Hi Pete,

Did you get your 1% always before Asian Session? And what is your max DD avoiding Asian Session ?

Thank you

--- 帖子 #268 ---
I have only one word to describe these Eas is "Gr8"

I will post my results on friday. Started ea today only and closed 4 times with profit.

I was trying to modify this ea for eurchf eurusd and usdchf.. but still not successful.

I think there should some poportion between take profit target and lot size. because when u trade with large balance and small lot, it will take more time to close basket. Currenly I am using balance $500 with 0.01 lot size. It is working fine for me. Just $5 pofit target.

Cheers!!!!!!!!!!

May god bless you.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
If anyone is using the 4D version I think it might be a good idea to increase the MMTU. I've noticed several occasions where it is in profit but not quite reaching the profit target.

Perhaps a setting where 30 to 40 pips would reach your desired profit target and where 7 or 8 trades would not do too much damage to margin (still testing).

And to all the US population...  Happy T-Day !!

Best of Regards,

TR

Thank you Tazmann,

I was testing for a while your Phantom_Add02_taz version on the other thread and results were spectaculars, but always damn DD appears.....

--- 帖子 #272 ---
yeah, thats long been since removed from my testing, the ugly dd ghost appeared pretty quickly, and since there's no way i'd live trade with that probable outcome, no reason to keep testing

The alternate pairs of gj/eg/ej sure don't seem to work out very well, so those 3 demos might be dropped here soon as well.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
I am using now the Full A from Roundrock with the CutLoser option, this EA is opening and adding 2 E/U everytime? everyone else has it?

is there a reason for it?

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Any chance of mixing this:

http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...58&postcount=1

with AP (E,F or L)?

Maybe Im wrong but this could be safer for the DD and faster for the TP.

Note: this is just a sugestion that more capable/experienced traders could evaluate. If you think it doesnt deserve a try, thats perfect for me.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
on my demo the art phantom full A  from Roundrock is not accurate,

A)it is adding phantom loosing also

B ) it is adding 2 positions, 2 batches together, and closes them at different times.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
I tried both Full (3.30 suv) and Extreme, Full is doing good. Extreme I had max floating dd of -14.04%

I am not gona post details here, because I will delete these account soon, and will compare the "pure full"  to   "timing + cut loser"   at same time once the "timing + cut loser" bot is coded.

regards,

LF

--- 帖子 #277 ---
a new version,

according to suggestions:

1. now the EA kills "biggestloser" calculated by metacoder original logic;

2. now a new position of a pair is only added when all previous positions of this pair have more than "PipStep" floating profit (in pips). note that PipStep is in 4-digit, but it is automatically adjusted to 5-digit broker......well, u try and u'll know.

i incorporated 2. is because I saw many times in Asian session, when pairs are not moving, the EA still keep adding positions at similar price levels, which is totally unnecessary and RISKY!

--- 帖子 #278 ---
Wonderfull ! maybe you can do the same for the full version, so we can test both and see which has better results?

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Thank you very much Charvo,

Your mod 2 is a attempt to make Asian Session a bit less looser.....we have to test this...

--- 帖子 #280 ---
i have ditched my extreme alternate pairs demo (the one that was horrible already this week) and replaced it with a slightly diff version.

It's charvo's he just posted, however its full version, and doesn't kill loosers.

So basically, its the full version original, but with the condition that adding to winners only happens when they are 20 pips or greater in profit.

Will let u know how it pans out comparatively.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
I believe that with Timmy's thought about using Roundrock's kill loser multiplier and Stop trade sequence during asian session will be greatly helpful to dd. If we use the kill loser when it reach certain level, that'll be just like an emergency stop, if this is the case, why not keeping our margin at healthy level all the time with the multiplier developed by Roundrock instead of waiting till last minute?

I am still looking forward for the version based on Timmy's thought. Will test it thoroughly when it's coded by fellow traders.

regards.

LF

--- 帖子 #282 ---
it opened up a second position with only 2 pip difference ?!

something not working well yet !?

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Good Morning!  Hmmm... no takers for coding the StopAfterNoTrades timings?

Okay, watch this space.

**********

See Attached.  It is the Extreme version but I have highlighted what I have ADDED with:

Inserted Code /*** the-game START (Added) ***/
.
.
.
/*** the-game END (Added) ***/

I have also highlighted what I have MODIFIED with:

Inserted Code /*** the-game START (Modified) ***/
.
.
.
/*** the-game END (Modified) ***/

I said MODIFIED as I have rearranged the order of the code as they were in the wrong place for this Timings code to work properly.

The Start (7) and Finish (19) hours I used are what Caillou has asked for, which is based on London Time, which is GMT+0

So if your broker's server time is GMT+2, like GoMarkets, just add 2 hours to those times.

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Hello the-game. I appreciate your help so much. Please forgive me, can you kindly post the EA with the Full version? And also with RoundRocks kill loser multiplier? therefore, "kill loser multiplier" plus your "timing".

I am so sorry, I see that you highlighted the parts that you coded, but I do not understand any programming at all, I am afraid I will ruin it but combining those two functions to "full" on my own. even a simple copy and paste.

Please, I am not being lazy, and I apologize for my lack of knowledge.

Hi Caillou,

Some observations from demo (lite version)

From 10 succesful baskets the following were opened:

6 in London session

2 in Asian session

1 in New York session

1 in Frankfurt session

8 baskets closed in London, New York or after Frankfurt open and 2 closed during the Asian session (1 NY, 1 London)

I cannot comment upon DD by avioding the Asian session as I have only instigated this on my live lite account yesterday.

Once I have more stats I will post results.

It makes great sense to me to avoid the Asia session due to its ranging nature, we need volatility to avoid larger basket sizes.

Pete

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Re: Close all at start of Asian session for any open basket - my comment was that it would impact too much on the function of the EA.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Low Profile (and everyone else),

I'm feeling generous with my time and I've had a bit of time free, so I knocked this up.

See attached.

You'll see where my timings coding is by searching "the-game", and you'll see where roundrock's cut loser trades coding is by searching "roundrock".

I've also added a flag called "CutLoserTrades" in case anyone doesn't want to use that function.

P.S. Everyone: All my attachments have my mod where the Phantoms don't get reset if you change a setting, restart MT4, restart computer, change timeframe, etc, etc... you get the picture!  Of course, as per usual, they will be reset after the EA closes all trades.

P.S.S. When trying different variations of the base EA, make sure you press F3 and Delete all the Global Variables (Ctrl+A then press Delete).

--- 帖子 #295 ---
From my testing on my EA which is similar... as much as I hate Asian session it has outperformed anything else. The baskets close quicker due to GJ and EJ... but my basket selection is also different I use high ranging pairs like GBPNZD and EURNZD to help out. The spread is stupid but if you look at total range over the day (tickvalue*pip range - spread) you actually get more bang for the buck with these pairs... SILVER/GOLD/FDX is actually even better... I'm testing a new idea to search thru the list of available pairs on my broker and calculate the highest ranging pairs based on $1/pip and take those trades... so far seems good.. but I'm trading 10 symbols so it actualyl can incur high DD if there is whipsaw... but most of the time it will be alot quicker to get your 1% profit since the pairs give you more money. Forget pip movement... look at silver.. each tick is $5 and it can make you $400 at 0.1 lot on a normal day right now.

If you think back to the idea of the OP.. the hedge should help out in DD situations.. so if I have 10 symbols it would be alot harder to minimize DD.. but also will be alot quicker to get higher % profits. It's all about balance and maybe choosing higher ranging pairs and not limiting trading (only 3 pairs out of a basket of 6) might actually be better. If you are limiting your pairs then you can have a case where your 3 pairs trade and are in DD while your opposing side doesn't trade because the 3 pairs you chose to trade are being outperformed by the phantom pairs. Ofcourse if this never happens then its ok but all it takes is one case to destroy the account.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Yep been saying this all along.  Just waiting for everyone to get all these other variations out of their system.  This is the most logical starting point to cut down DD.

Please someone code it alone -by itself - with no other mods - for the most successful version - that being the FULL version.

Tim

--- 帖子 #300 ---
timmy, in your second last post above, did you mean you wanted charvo's "low margin-kill biggest loser" coding in the Full version or did you mean you wanted roundrock's "cut loser trades that are a multiple of the negative Dollar Profit Target" in the Full version?

Because Art_Phantom_Full-Timings_&_Cut_Losers is based on my timings and roundrock's cut loser trades that are a multiple of the negative Dollar Profit Target coding.

--- 帖子 #301 ---
I've updated this one as well after finding the same timings bug.

Might want to re-download.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
If you consider that strong move will eventually occur to take you to profit then DD becomes the overriding factor to manage.... And getting tov higher % profits quicker is secondary. (Live to fight another day... and make some averagely nice profits along the way).

Further I do not believe you will get all three pairs in the negative for long since the cross is absolutely tied to the two primary pairs - you only get the negative position whilst the hedging pair(s) kick in. And the more volatile the market at the time of the reversal the greater the DD (since the market moves further against the open positions before the hedge trades can kick in). But the three pairs have little relavance to the original 14 pairs in the Phantom basket - and it really only serves to choose which pair(s) start the sequence rolling - since the EA can only place trades when all other open positions are in the positive anyways.

Tim

--- 帖子 #303 ---
The only way around this is to have the EA check if the one of the three pairs we are trading is the Biggest Phantom Winner before Adding a trade.

This coding has been done before in other Phantom EAs on seperate threads, but others in this thread may see it as a condition that may well restrict the EA from performing at it's full potential.

I like the idea of checking if EU, EJ, UJ is a Biggest Phantom Winner before adding a trade to it.

Reason being we are only trading 3 pairs out of the 14 Phantoms, meaning if one of these 3 pairs is the Biggest Phantom Winner, then that is a very strong signal to get a trade in on that pair.

But for now, I would just like to see how the EA runs without this check.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Ah I was under the assumption that the 3 pairs are the only ones being traded even after the sequence starts. Well that might make more sense then if these are your anchor pairs... and follows T101's model closer to what I was thinking since when the anchor pairs jump then the rest of the pairs are to follow.... then it may be irrelevant to worry about the number of pairs other than the fact that if you have too many.. it will be harder to hedge your position during whipsaw. Might be a sweet spot based on account size and risk per trade/vs profit %.

Ofcourse I do agree on fighting another day thats a fundamental principle that should be followed... and I'd argue that having a strategy that may allow for quicker profits (to be able to transfer money out and have the rest market money to play with) and also be able to hedge its position be more important than having a slightly less reliable hedge mechanism and way slower account growth. Its a ratio and should be weighted 50/50 but really depends on your personality.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Great point there, forget about my post above... for now

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Hi the-game,

Thanks for coding these mods - much appreciated.  I have been a full time trader for many years - but never learnt to program which can be frustrating, when on the odd occation I find a topic of interest such as this one.

So your version (which I can't load until the next equity pop) has variable timings (or are you saying the start/finish times are fixed.  Hopefully you have them as variables - but if not then I would suggest 0600 to 1600 GMT as the trade sequence opening window.

I like your safty feature mod that does not alter any of the settings unless there is an equity pop.  So a connection failure won't stuff up the EA when it comes back online...yes?

Roundrocks cut loser trades (based on the multiple of the -$ profit) is fine, since I can put it out to a large number to get it out of the way.

I think that Roundrocks function roughly allows a 1% DD per multiple (I did some very rough calcs), per 0.25% profit percent.  So if you have it set for 6 then the first trades start closing out at negative 6 times the $ profit and this will roughly be at about a 6% DD (don't quote me on this) when the pp is set for 0.25%.  So with it set at 6, it would be a DD of approx 24% if pp was set to 1%.... very rough guide.  Needs further analysis.

Tim

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Guys,

I don't think the original EA followed T101's model and I will modify my EA to follow it...

The real pairs (or in phantom 6 the 6 pairs) actually should be anchors...and you trade only when an anchor is your best phantom.

Timmy brought this up and I forgot about it but it triggered me to remember how T101's system worked.

He had two versions.. when an anchor becomes your best phantom you buy the whole buy basket because the rest of the basket will follow)... likewise for sell.  If you get whipsaw (your buy and sell anchors switch between best phantoms) then you are completely hedged synthetically because you bought and sold the whole basket... you now have all pairs open... but the whole point is the anchor leads the way and reduces whipsaw over choosing secondary pairs. The anchor is the pair that gets traded with the most money... GU and EU for example.

The other version just waited for a pair to dislodge the current anchor and become the new best phantom... then you would simply buy this phantom... this is how I believe Basket 14 EA works... just trades the best phantom out of 7 pairs for BUY/SELL baskets. Problem is you aren't hedged if there is whipsaw and your basket becomes uneven causing DD.

I'm going to make a new version for my phantom EA to fix this...but after I reread some of that thread.

--- 帖子 #308 ---
Yes, they are variables that you can change

Even without this "Don't reset Phantom's unless close all" mod, the EA will continue to work as-is.

I just put it in there as I don't like to have my Phantoms initial prices reset to different prices everytime I tinker with the settings or accidentally change the time frame or need to restart MT4 or my computer.

--- 帖子 #309 ---

timmy, can I ask what's your reasoning for using 0600 - 1600 GMT as the trade sequence opening window?

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Hello the-game, again and again, I thank you so much. I just started the "pure full"   VS   "the-game version".  I will let everyone knows the result as time goes along. I dont know any coding, i'll do my best to test everything and let everyone knows what's best.

btw, the-game, not sure why, the full is functioning normally, but you version, there is no text shown on the trading screen, I believe it's because now is asian time so no trading, that's why there is no text on the chart, dont think it's a bug. Will let u know when Asian session pass and if this problem still exist, i'll report back.

Please, from my heart, thanks!

Hi the-game,

There is a small bug in your latest EA.  Nothing happens if the new trading hours feature is enabled & it is outside of trading hours.  It is getting stuck continually resetting phantoms.  The following change fixes it:

Inserted Code if (UseTradingHours)
{
if (TimeHour(TimeCurrent()) >= StartHour &&
((TimeHour(TimeCurrent()) < FinishHour && FinishHour != 0) ||
(TimeHour(TimeCurrent()) < 24 && FinishHour == 0)))
{
[b]if (StopAfterNoTrades && TotalTrades == 0)
{
ResetPhantoms();
StopAfterNoTrades = false;
}[/b]
}
else
{
StopAfterNoTrades = true;
}
}

EDIT:  Looks like you beat me!

EDIT2:  My change doesn't do anything - I'm full of it!

--- 帖子 #318 ---
If you are basing your times off timmy's suggestion of 6-16 GMT, then yes, those times are correct.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
the game, was ready to send you my print screen of journal and expert tab info. then i saw ur new post, ok i'm gona replace it with the new one.

Don't be so hard on yourself, how else are you going to learn?

I made many errors before I was confident with MQL4, and I'm a Java Programmer by trade!

It's a common mistake using the current charts Bid/Ask, instead of the Symbol's Bid/Ask.

BTW, I love the PipStep mod... I was thinking the same thing this morning when I saw many EU sells within 3-5 pips of each other.

I've got my own private Extreme going with the timings mod using timmy's suggested times and your pip step mod at 10 pips.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
You could use any time around these times - pre Europe (so maybe 0700-0800, and finish just before lunch in the US session - if I have my timing correct...)

Hi all

Attached is my screen.

At least, the EA is not running during Asian time.

From what I gather from the source code, the EA is actually using the time equivalent to the Broker Time.

Stay Tune

Ian

--- 帖子 #333 ---
mallim, that is correct, it is using Broker Time... I'm pretty sure I've mentioned that in my post

But you can always change the StartHour and FinishHour in the EA settings, if you need to.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
There you go. Sorry, I was not by my computer.

good trading!

LP

--- 帖子 #335 ---
maybe I should test "the-game" version with the extreme instead of full, because full will have far less positions than extreme, and then we use timing and cut loser filer which will result less trades again.

on the other hand, with extreme, with the filter(timing + cut loser) turned on, may generate better result regarding equity curve.

Mind sharing your opinions?

Thanks

"The game" EA has start hour 7 and finish hour 19. Is this london open and Newyork close hours?

Well none out of 3 ea able to close single basket in last 12hrs.

Extream: dd increase to 8%

Full: dd is 4%

Light: dd is 6%

Both Extream and full booked same profit while light booked 50% less than these two.

Well now i am able to edit this ea... experimenting with other combination.

Lets hope for the best.

My idea of trading such strategy is
Ea should open all 3 pairs at a time on begining. ie when we start EA

and then it should at winning pair to existing basket.

Looking for opinion of experts on this idea!!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #340 ---
If I change the 0.0 in the EA in, let's say,10.0 does the EA then check if the OpenOrder is at least 10pips in profit before adding a new order for that pair? And is it in pips or dollaramount?

If it is in pips, wouldn't it be easier to make that 0.0 a input variable rather than working with pipsteps? Or am I missing /overlooking something. No offense or criticism, just trying to learn

(I'm still no coder, but learn a lot from watching the modifications you make and compare them to earlier version)

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Thank you very much for all your help.

Would it be possible for you (if you have time) to post an xtreme version with close+timing  + pipstep (10 or 20). this could be the ideal combination

Good observations. So many variables to think about......

--- 帖子 #348 ---
No, you will need charvo's PipStep coding to achieve what you want. Just have a look at his EA (light something or other) and you will see his relative mods for PipStep, just copy and paste in the same place. Just don't copy his low margin killer code!

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Do it yourself using my instructions in my post above this one

Ok, thanks. Wish it was so easy as i posted. But I know which version of Charvo's mod you mean, so I''ll have a look.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Sorry man - the-game did.  Just checked back.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Hi The-Game,

What I wanted is for example if start time is 7h00 (London Time), at 7h00 the EA starts running as usual. If end time is 17h00 (London Time), the EA will manage the basket if a basket is already trading till it takes profit and when it takes profit it will stop running till 7h00. If at 17h00 there is no basket trading, then the EA will stop till 7h00.

Tell if I made it clear now.

Thank you

--- 帖子 #353 ---
The EA must NOT close a basket at 17h00, it must continue trading until it reach profit !!!

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Why bother reporting on the PhantomSix EA's we are all focused on the 3 pairs trading here......

We discussed the logic of trading fewer pairs and that the DD from 14 pairs (original) or 6 was going to be a greater than if three pairs were traded before we were asked to split off .... but people like to keep on with what they like - even if its against reason, so just keep posting those results on the other thread...

Tim

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Yeah, this is what we need.  I assume The-Game's mod does it this way???  (Can't run new version until equity pop)

Tim

thanks.  am a little confused. have your Full-timings & cut losers on demo,in Strategy it is supposed to open every 30 min, but it opens every 15 !? is this the xtreme version ?

Today a copy of yesterday: lots of trades during Asian Session and recovery in London Session.

Gain: + 9,15 %, max DD: -5,22% (4,58% daily)

http://www.myfxbook.com/members/Serg...tom-full/65746

Could not close EA before Asian Session because basket was not in profit.....

Sometimes the more trades you have, the quicker the recovery is.....

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Yes, I hope so.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Yes, I looked at the code and it is the Extreme version (every 15min), although the name says it is the Full version.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
I have a suggestion :

If we ad the pipstep on this last EA, but we put different values on Asian session, ex: 5 pip for london and US, but 20 pip for Asian, like this if the EA is still open in Asian session and continues trading but is ranging, it doesn't cluster with to many trades.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Excellent obervation, we have to think: worthwhile trading in Asian Session ?

--- 帖子 #362 ---
even if not, but the existing trades have to continue, this would lower DD and risk on those trades

another improvement on those remaining asian trades was mentionend before (I think it was your idea) is to lower PP to be

--- 帖子 #363 ---
Interesting - if i follow you correctly you closed out your Asian trade from yesterday (following big down leg) in this London session.  I am still locked in a small DD and have not closed out at all today.

so i wanted to compare your risk to mine.  I checked your results and worked back to find that you have a risk 6.6 times greater than what I am trading on my small live testing account.

Considerations:

Your max DD is 5.22% mine is 2.1% - there may be a good reason to trade high risk like you are on the basis that you will get 'boosted' quickly to profit, but there always lies the risk of the bigger DD than what my account is likely to see.  However in the short testing period we have had - although you have over 6 times the risk you only have ~2 1/2 times the max DD to date.  So the fact that your net pip target is 6.6 times lower than mine has got you clear of prolonged trade sequences and so when the break out to the positive direction occurs you can achieve it more rapidly.

(Of course it may all be due to different trade sequence start periods - but as time goes by this comparison will hold more and more weight.)

I am thinking that some sort of volatility filter could define the size of the risk.  For example, what if the trade size was related to a basic ATR coefficient of some sort (it would hold across all pairs, and would change for each new trade sequence).  I will think on this further.

The key here is we are looking to reduce the DD and not inhibit the pure function of the trading system.

Tim

--- 帖子 #364 ---
are you still trading with 0.4 mmtu (400 lev) and PP 1 ?

--- 帖子 #365 ---
As always brilliant thoughts Tim,

Untill we have modifications checked, I´m going to close manually (with script posted a few days ago) all my open trades from 17h00 (London Time) and remove the EA till 7h00 ONLY if my basket is in profit (small, big, whatever) but if the basket is in loss, I will let the EA running with "StopAfternotrades" option switch on. Then at 7h00, I will switch off this option.

Hello, the-game, I think the robot you coded for us last night was the Extreme instead of Full? Because now I can see it opens trade at each : 00, 15, 30 and 45 min.

Maybe the full should only open at 15 and 30 min?

Probably confusion between what we were both thinking the mod was doing/not doing.  If you really can be bothered refer to our dialogue in posts 251,252,253,and 261.  I asked if it did one of two features and you said both, one of these features was exactly this function.  I made the comment that if it was the case I wouldn't trade it with that function.

No big deal here - we had a lot going on and I was not sure of exactly what you were coding at the time and you probably weren't sure about what I was on about.... forget it and lets keep moving forward.

Hi The-Game,

Is it possible to code this: when we are at the end time (i.e. 19h00) and a basket is open yet, then to close the basket when it is in profit, not P.P. % profit but wathever profit ?

If we consider that the max DD can be minimised by running a larger contract size (bigger risk) then can we use this to our advantage (of course we know it will mean a much bigger DD at some point in time when the 'Fast Reversal' pattern occurs...but put this aside for the moment).

Lets consider the system as a thought experiment.  We know that the target in terms of net pips in the positive direction is smaller, the bigger our trade size.

So if we have $1000 account and a $1 per pip contract and we have a 0.5% target (pp) then it will take 50 pips net of the hedging effect to hit this target.  So $2 per pip (calculated in the EA by MMTU and broker leverage) would mean we need only get 25 'net' pips to achieve the target.

Imagine then if we had a target of only, say 10 pips, to get to our 0.5% target.  It would do this much quicker than any of our current setups, but would run the risk of a BIG DD at some point.  However based on the analysis we have done to date the DD under most circumstances is smaller with the bigger contract size RELATIVE to the profit achieved (Caillou's profit was about 9% versus mine of 2.5% for a similar period and he is running 6.6 times the risk, yet his DD was ~5% versus my ~2%).  Simply because the EA can get to its pp target much quicker and not allow itself to get bogged down with many hedging trades.  This has shown to be the case even in sideways markets.

Now margin will not be an issue since the number of open trades will not be high. One, because the pp will get hit quickly in most cases, and two, because we can look to limit the risk by trading only in higher volatility periods.

How do we establish a higher volatility period.  My approach: take your Euro/USD 1 hour chart and add an ATR(6) to it.  Then take an SMA(20) and run it on the ATR indicator.  You can clearly see periods of higher volatility each day as you come into the London session (ATR crosses up over the SMA).  There is the odd day where this indicater does not show a big move after the ATR(6) crosses above the SMA - but it usually catches the big moves (the indicator just does not try to predict a direction - hence it is usful.  The EA figures out the direction).

Further filter - we want to only run a large contract setup for our EA if the ATR(6) is greater than, say, 20 pips (twice our example target).

It is not perfect but we now have a strong chance of running a bigger contract size in more active market (pseudo volatility), and achieving our target of only 10 pips to reach our 0.5% pp within an hour or two.  This means we could run it several times during the active period and ensure we are closed down well before the Asian session begins (in most cases I would suspect we can achieve this).

Now to further limit the DD I would only allow a max DD of say 10% of equity (this need to be assessed futher) if it goes further then either kill off the biggest loosers or kill off the trade sequence completely.

This would be an interesting version to test.  Just need the two ATR filters as above coded into it for testing.

Food for thought....

Tim

--- 帖子 #381 ---
To achieve that I think the best solution  would be to make 2 PP; 1 for trading hours, 1 for non-trading hours ,then you can put the PP for non trading hours at 0.01.

P.S. If we can also code a separate pipstep for non trading hours-as long as it is not closed to only open new pos if it is 20 pip positif-, could be ideal

Hi Navk,

My question is: since when do you have this -8.80% DD, since today London Open ?

--- 帖子 #387 ---
my art_full is running since last 24 hrs and yet to close. right now i have 13 trades.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Yah, london open, it started trading. At one point of time, the max DD was - 8.8 %, right now the DD is - 4.6 % with 18 open trades.

You can see the screen shot showing max DD OF 8.8 % which i posted earlier.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Cailliou :

see the screetshot attached.

--- 帖子 #390 ---
I have some doubts about the benefit in cutting biggest looser. If we decide to close the trade of the biggest looser pair is because we think that doing that we are helping the EA to reach the profit quicker, so because we think that the biggest looser will continue to loose.

This is the same as thinking that it is better to trade the biggest winner pair because this pair will continue to win. But why it is more probable that and not the opposite ? Maybe it is not strong enough to follow this movement.

If a pair has already lost i.e. 3 times the target, 300 pips, what is more possible to happen ? To continue to loose or to recover ? Nobody knows.

Whith another EA version from 6 pairs thread it recover a -15 % DD in 30 min......

I think the option of cut loosers is just a matter of psychological security. Of course we have to minimize the DD but I think that cutting the biggest looser is not the solution. Maybe I´m wrong, don´t know.

For now, I prefer focuse my attention to limit trading hours to control this DD.

It could be very interesting if someone knows how to extract DD information from MT4 to Excel in order to have some charts like DD X time, to calculate max, min, averages......

hello ,sorry for my english-

is it possible to program the ea -

if a position is 50 to 100 pip loss in short, we take on -

then the long position is opened, a trend-position?

illustration.

eurjpy open short  position 50 pip go long- trend is long-

ea open eurjpy long position - trend increase

i hope you can understand me?

Cailiou:

My observations:

All the EA s which you created are fine, sometimes the DD is more but still it recovers from that position and close in profit. If an emergency situation occurs, let us say when the margin reaches less than 300 percent or DD is more than the acceptable limits, all open trades or loosing trades shall be closed. This should be left to indivedual's choice. The principle of all these EA s you created are "never loose" so it should be allowed to run.

Another idea would be to close the EA after 2pm EST and switch it on around 1 AM EST when london opens. If there are open trades during this time, it can allowed to run but should not add more trades during this time.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
I agree with you, we don't know which direction it is going,

we should concentrate on trading hours and pipstep.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Cutting the loosers would not be a good idea for these EA'S  as these EA are created with synthetic hedge principle, if the EA cut loosers and PA reverses, the account might get stopped out quickly.

you cannot leave it open and not let it ad at all, you never know what can happen, but you can code a min.profit, for ex. it only ads if positions are 20 pips in profit

--- 帖子 #398 ---
DD is a function of lot size. make sure you trade appropriate lot size. check yr MMTU.

if you have 100 open trades, then the DD shouldnt exceed 10%. thats the thumb rule

--- 帖子 #399 ---
As long as the open trades after 2 PM EST upto 1 AM EST are hedged synthetically you have no issues. Adding to winning trades can happen after london opens.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
you are not really hedged, a trade was opened because phantom was positive, now market can turn around, if you don't allow new trading, you will not be hedged and can loose account

--- 帖子 #401 ---

Callou: All EA's you created are fine. Some finetuning you do, it work excellent i am sure. All these days i have been seeing wiining baskets, just past two days, i see the trades are not getting closed.

My suggestions:

1) EA s should not open trades after 2pm est up to 1 am est.

2) Open trades after 2 pm est can be allowed but an emergecy stop loss should be in place.

3)Winning pair in the earlier hour should be added as new trade. The screen shot which i posted shows euro/usd was looser today but adding on to trades.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
If the winning trades are added to basket, the basket would have got closed. Pl check the coding so that :

1) Winnig trade in the past hour should be added to basket of trades.

2) Time frame setting for traders to choose EA "switch off time "

3) Emergency stop loss in case if trades go in opposit direction during EA "no trade " time.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
you are right, I suggest 6 durimg london & NY session, and 20 for trades that are still open in Asian session

--- 帖子 #413 ---
The EA is opening trade every hour.

If the open and close price of the hourly candle ( or high and low for that hourly candle ) is more than 10 or so, it can open another trade in that direction of the trend since daily trend will prevail throughout the day.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
but another concern we have is that recovery from loss will be a lot quicker with more positions on hand.

gona do some research on that.

Extream version looking out of race now.. dd increase to around 10%

Full version is doing great job 3 basket closed.. dd is not concern

Light version looks very lazy only cut one basket in 36+ hrs. dd is around 5%

From this preliminary results i think full version is looking good but its too early to draw any conclusion

Apart from this i am using following stategy manually.

Opening all 3 pair with the help of script. and then using this EA to balance this basket. results are good till now.

Another experiment i am doing is i modified this ea for 4 pairs

Buy EU and UC &

Sell GU and EG

These are pure hedged pairs. Trying same method as above phantom eas.

and Also I have modified this ea for 2 pairs ie... EU and UC

one EA for buy and other EA for sell

Attached this two eas to 2 diff charts...

Lets see what happen.

Anyways I very eager to see the final version of this phontaom series.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
I agree with you.  I don't think it will really help at all - unless you are desperate for the margin (but then you're trading to much risk).

Tim

--- 帖子 #417 ---
You make the point about needing an emergency close out option - either kill off all losers or all open trades (ie the entire position), then in the next sentence you point out the absolute crux of this whole trading approach " The principle of all these EA's you created are "never loose" so it should be allowed to run".

Well in this last sentence you are dead right and this is what we must adhere to through all the development.  So I think the only emergency option is to close out all trades at a fixed DD %.  This needs to be far away from the usual drawdowns.  BUT definitely don't close out all losers only at a big DD point - that is a recipe for disaster.

Tim

--- 帖子 #418 ---
I think this idea is worth exploring also.  Maybe a minimum pip gap can be initiated when the ATR(6) is below its 20 period moving average - in other words the EA could initiate a pip gap between trades when the market is very slow.... would need testing to see if effective.  It might help minimise DD during quiet periods.  But will not inhibit the system functionality as the market breaks out into a direction.

Tim

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Yes though the whole idea of this EA is "never loose" but again it depends on individual' s risk tolerance. So i said an emergency stop by way of closing all open trades at certain DD, Say 8 to 10 %. If this option is there, it can be used by Traders, if they wish.

Trading on a leveraged money, one must have stop loss.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
This is not a bad idea.  But 20 pips might well be way to much and could disrupt the actual functionality of the system, considering that the range during an Asian session might only be 30 pips.  It is important the EA does not end up with big gaps due to this pip gap function.  Consider when we see a fast move and then it allows a trade to open.  We have a new trade with a big gap.  If it pulls off there is no capability for the EA to place any further balancing trades on that pair until it moves significantly in that direction again... we have seen that this situation often causes more DD.  A pip gap function could cause this very issue - so we have to be careful.

For what its worth I like the idea though and would consider a London and NY gap of say 5 pips , and an Asian gap of say 10 pips to test out.  Need to have these as variables.  (And I would still only have trading through the Asian session if a sequence was already opened in London or NY.  I still wouldn't have any sequence initiated during Asian session.)

A question for experienced coders: is it possible for an EA to manage the P/L and close trades taken in 2 differents accounts of a same or different broker?

--- 帖子 #422 ---
I think of course it is possible......

We can create an EA1 on account 1 with real trades of account 1, phantom trades of account 2 and when the P/L of real and phantom trades reach the PP, it will close the real trades of this account ( and the same for the opposite EA2 on account 2).....

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Interesting - keep us posted.

I have been wondering about the single pair EA version of this.  If we were to use, say E/U only as buy and sell - no other pairs.  So when E/u is positive in the Phantom basket - and all other trades are in profit - we Buy, and if negative and all other trades are in profit - we sell.

Surely this will give us a profit as price action moves in one direction just like the 3 pairs EAs are doing for us.... and will act no differently to the version we have now, just with one pair, and much more efficient on rebalancing...???

Why do we need three pairs, I know we talk about needing the imbalanced hedge to profit - but in reality this is just creating a net E/U, U/J or E/J synthetic that we profit from, so at the point of taking pp we have a net synthetic pairing that has run far enough to make profit.  Could we just do the same with one pair.  We could even create a one pair EA for each of the three pairs and run them seperately if you wanted to capture any/ all of the moves from these three pairs as we are doing now .....????

This whole game comes down to profiting from the functions of entry times, and volatility/momentum. No different for one pair or three...

Because the most important principle of this EA is to use a perfect syntetic hedge to stop a loosing decision and to take the right one at this moment and again and again till we reach profit......and what is the most perfect REAL HEDGE ?

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Are you going still to post a Full timing version ? ( the one we are currently testing is the xtrem version-to much trades)

--- 帖子 #428 ---
This should do the trick.  It should at trades at 15 and 45. Rest it behaves the same. I changed the default input variables such as MMTU, PercentProfit and TradingTimes. Be aware and adjust them if needed.

And here is the Light version also:

Fantastic ! Thanks a lot.

would you know how to ad the pipstep from Roundtrack to this? I couldn't.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Just for fun and to understand the principle of hedging. Open, on a demo account, 0.1 lot of the following pair at the same time (or quick after each other)

Buy EURJPY

Sell EURUSD AND USDJPY

Look how much the starting loss is (because of the spread) Let it run for while and notice how the total loss changes only a bit, and how the profit/loss of the 3 individual pairs change.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Yes, only ONE pair. For non U.S resident no problem in the same account but for U.S resident maybe 2 accounts is the way to do that.

Any coder could modify Art_Phantom_Full to trade only EUR/USD ? EUR/USD must be in Phantom Buy Group and in Phantom Sell Group. Then when we run the EA a Phantom Buy Trade and a Phantom Sell Pair for EUS/USD begin. Each 30 min (at 15 and 45) if the Phantom Trade is in profit and if all previous Real Trades are in profit then the EA opens a Real Trade (Buy or Sell).

As I' m not a U.S resident I have no problem to test it on the same account. If the performance is ok, we could create 2 EAs for US residents.

Less trades, Pure Real Hedge to stop loosing direction, advantages are obvious.....

Any coder ?

Perfect syntetic hedge happens when we buy all pair at the same time. So as i said in above post.. I trying this...

buy/sell all 3 pairs at a time and then balance this basket with this ea

--- 帖子 #438 ---
Yaa me too desperately looking for this strategy. I was trying this for two pairs EU and UC.. but not able to code. so i created 2 diff eas.. but no trade till now!

--- 帖子 #439 ---
Correct, and when this perfect syntetic hedge arrives after a small loss, then the loss will not move till you break again this hedge....

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Please, explain me what is wrong in this EUR/USD example movement:

1.-  8h00: 1,3600.   Phantom Trades start ( Buy and Sell)

2.-  8h15: 1,3610.   Real Trade Buy

3.-  8h45: 1,3620.   Real Trade Buy

4.-  9h15: 1,3590.   Real Trade Sell

5.-  9h45: 1,3640.   Real Trade Buy

6.- 10h00: 1,3680.   Close Basket

Results: trade 2 (+70) + trade 3 (+60) + trade 4 (-90) + trade 5 (+40) = +80 ( or wathever PP)

I know it is a bit late here in Spain and maybe I' m tired but " This strategy will not work" ..... why ?

--- 帖子 #441 ---
I am with you on this one.  It will work just the same as a three pair basket, but with less DD as the reversal is most efficient.  Also less spread costs (especially if you do it on the E/U).

Further if we could code in the ATR filter I mentioned this would be more efficient that a straight - arbitrary - time filter that we have now.

Tim

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Thank you Tim,

I was thinking I was going crazy. I will never understand why someone with his own thread instead of trying to improve his EAs must go to other threads to say "this will not work" and leave...... He must not have too much confidence in his EAs.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
What are you on about?  If you make a statement like this please provide your reasoning.

It will work no different than running 3 instruments (pairs/crosses if you like) versus just one instrument to do the same job - and more efficiently.

This EA lets price action be the ultimate decision maker on which way the it goes to profit.  Doing this with one instrument or three it does not matter - just more efficent with one pair.

The key for us is to get a good filter that allows trade sequences every chance of completing within a market with some momentum.

As mentioned put an ATR(6 period) on your 1hr Euro/USD chart and attach over this a SMA(20 period).  Everytime the ATR(6) moves = or > than the SMA then you have potentially some momentum. So this could be our volatility/momentum filter.

The time filter we have now will ensure that we don't start trade sequences within the Asian time zone as well.

And with a reasonable level of risk we can make ~5% per week (trading, say once per day for a 1% pp) and the EA will dig itself out of most flat periods with only a small pip target if the risk is set correctly - should the expected market momentum not eventuate for a particular day.

Finally an overall emergency Close all at % DD can allow us to sleep well.

Time will tell what level this would best suit.  But I'd likely place it at ~20% to start with...to catch to big daddy death trade.

Any coders keen to convert the full version with these mods (could convert the-games latest full version with time filter & close out worst trade).....

I am sure this will give us a powerful EA that efficently trades the net movement of the Phantom pair within the basket, that has an edge by only trading during volatile periods and never duringthe usual quiet Asian session.  The other 'edge' for this EA is that it uses pure price action to define its direction - no bullshit indicators (the Momentum indicator I mention above only indicates market volatility and possible momentum).

Tim

Well said. Hope a coder could help us.......

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Good evening, I' m going to sleep. See you tomorow.....

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Sleep well Caillou

I assume everyone understands how to put a SMA(20) over the ATR(6).  If not, just drag the SMA over the ATR then click on the "Apply to" and click on 'Fist indicators data'... and you have the moving average of the Average True Range on the same indicator.

For the SMA I use either period 20 or maybe 12.

Have a look at it - it breaches up over the moving average nicely ahead of the daily move - on most days.  It won't tell you which direction the market will go (so it is a useful indicator for us - no bull$hit prediction of the daily move), the EA will then use price action to get us into the right direction and take us to profit.

Cheers

Tim

Well the R:R is not good enough given the edge it provides.

Based on what people have been showing backtests/forward tests... the 20% mark is easy eclipsed before you could actually make 20%.

If the EA provides a stable equity curve long term through different types of market environments... ranging to trending back to ranging then it will be on to something.

That being said.. the amount of time to test it is not worthwhile as it is...

If someone uses this idea to provide a vehicle to create long term equity gains I will invest 100k in them that's how confident I am that you are just wasting time.

That's not to say the idea isn't good. You may apply R:R to actually increase your odds... but then its not the same EA... the idea of using a basket is what I got out of all of this. The more instruments you look at to base the same decision the better your "edge" is. I am just telling you so you don't get false hope and waste time.

If you really want to get somewhere with this strategy or any strategy you have to find a way to test it better.. I've been saying this forever but alot of effort is wasted on just tweaking on times and other features that may or may not get a better EA... if you can backtest you can prove what you have is actually good through different types of markets aswell as the limitations to know what you should expect.

Mt4 is obviously easy to implement but its also easier to lose your account aswell than to do something proper and figure out a way to backtest either through Dukascopy or some other platform that allows multicurrency backtesting.

FWD testing is just half the battle and you can't purely rely on it with this type of EA because we as humans love to temper and test different settings as soon as we think it will help for a certain instance of time without understanding the full implications of the change you just made.

So I would love for my own EA to prove me wrong but even as its up 10% DD got up to 10%... that to me is not good odds esp with the state of the markets and what they can do in one day even with the best money management.

If you're happy with the fact that any day you may lose your account hoping to double up so you can have a free ride then go for it... but I warned you in any case. Some of you may understand where I'm coming from but to the ones that don't then disregard me and continue on... its better proving someone wrong now that you got motivation (and no that's not reverse physcology if that's what you're thinking)

I really do hope for everyones prosperity... The big dogs have all the money and we would be happy with their crumbs... I would rather one of you have it instead of them since the greedy bastards are what got the countries in this mess in the first place.

So what's your stance? You think I'm wrong? Please elaborate...

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Sure you let PA be the dictator but at what odds? How do you define odds with this system for expectancy of profits? The only way is to FWD test and make sure your 20% DD won't get hit before your 20% profit.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
ATR filter may work and volume may be even better but there usually is a "set up" time when the big boys will lure in the pigs and buy at a discount or sell when it is expensive. This is done a few hours into the session.

With your EU example yes it will be less DD.. but at what cost? Won't it be harder to reach your PP? This comes back to the original problem and you're running in circles.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Sure Caillou that's great... my EA with the same concept also closed in profit today... but give it a few weeks and you'll see. Set your DD cutoff to say 20% as Timmy says and in 2 months lets see the balance. Then try on a real account with minimum money say $500 and see the same result. That's 4 months wasted and $500 cleaned out. I've done this before on ideas that seem good at first... and I've looked at basket trading and other strategies for a long time... but it ALL COMES BACK TO MM AND R:R.

You will never win with martingale.. see LTCM. And with the kind of Risk to Reward this system offers the long term equity curve will be decreasing.

If you don't believe me then ask a 10+ year trader on here... Hanover had a good spiel about why Martingale sucked even if your system hasn't lost in 10 years.

A little story... I made a scalping EA for EURCHF... called it the super scalper it hadn't lost since 1999 in backtest and FWD test for 6 months. It made 1000% every year because of big lot sizes... however the SL was set to something like 20% of my account. I went live and it hit SL 2 weeks after I started. I couldn't handle the fact that an SL was hit so I doubled down (that was the Greece incident)... and eventually had to manually intervene to get myself out after like 80% of my margin used.

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Firstly let me say that this is all an experiment - and that the reality here is that the initial EA will likely produce a negative expectancy. I am not blindly doing this assuming that it can be profitable in the basic form. I have been trading for a living for many years and would not have survived if I couldn't find a system with a true edge. (I mainly trade news after the event)

The idea of using a basket simply allows price action to dictate which currencies are strongest and to let the market dictate what the mix of pairs will take us into a net profit position.

To create a positive expectancy we need an edge for this system. The EA is simply a tool to take advantage of price movement in its simplest form - and the more pairs we trade with the greater the potential DD as the more unrelated currencies take longer to react to each other, than say two primary pairs and there associated cross. (The three pairs approach as we have it currently)

The 20% max DD is relative to risk and purely arbitrary. If I trade small contacts it may not be hit for a long time. Now that is not to say that I have made more than 20% every time it gets hit -BUT - if I am able to apply an edge to this process then I have a chance of doing so (positive expectancy). Maybe applying a volatility/ momentum filter will help with this.

By using a one pair 'basket' (eg E/U ) we can backtest filter ideas to see how they impact on the functionality of the EA. You may well be right in that three pairs may work out to be more contructive as a basis for the EA to work with.

Of course this EA will fail in certain markets as it stands - you are not telling us anything we don't know already. Currently it will always fail under a fantail pattern (ie ever increasing range at both ends - with price bouncing back and forth). So being able to backtest ideas with a one pair basket will help to manage this. it maybe that the failure pattern can be 'contained through filtering and that the EA is then able to make profits greater than those losses at the fail safe point (what ever we deem this as).

Explain what you mean by applying R:R to increase the odds. You do not present any constructivity to your argument. Certainly if you push out the target pp to a larger number and filter it on the basis of a longer term trend, then it can be done with the EA pretty much as it is. For example with another filter such as a simple SMA of longer period. When the price action crosses up over a long term SMA filter and the EA moves into a net profit based position to the buy side (which it would do) then the EA simply maintains the pp as open and will look to close all when the price action reverses back over the long period SMA. This will provide excellent R:R using the base EA we have developed so far but with these type of additional filters.

This is all future development ideas. I agree with the sentiment of the other comments you make, so feel free to bring something constructive to the table.

Tim

--- 帖子 #452 ---
By the time SMA crosses the ATR the best setup has already passed in alot of cases.

Feel free to go to my thread to see what I'm talking about regarding the R:R.

You wait for a breakout then get in with min 10:1.

We again come back to testing... if we can test multiple pairs we can identify if its better to even have multiple pairs vs single pairs through backtesting. Yes single pairs will allow you to dictate when reversals happen quicker but then again you will fall for more headfakes aswell. Applying multiple pairs is like averaging your position.. by doing this you are hoping to catch the trend but at what cost we don't know yet. If we can conclude that the cost isn't as high as the benefit 51/100 times then sure we can have an edge... but at this point through fwd testing all I'm saying is we are wasting time that we can spend on actually improving our success in forex by focusing on the testability of our idea.

Whenever you program something you have to have a way to test its parts and test it as a whole... we are missign half the picture of testing the idea. I think by doing this we will see glaring problems with the logic we deduced to put in the EA even though it may seem likes to be according to everyone's best interest.

I did put something constructive ont he table... if you see it then it may be of benefit... but I'm certainly not taking anything away other than those who think it may be a nuisance to tell others what's right and what's wrong.. and I'm only doing so because I've been here and done that and gone full circle before.... you learn from your mistakes so why not teach others before they make the same.

You don't want to limit your exposure to testing just because Mt4 doesn't allow it... this is not acceptable and shouldn't be for anyone who is not serious. If you see a problem with this then you will have a way harder time being successful  in this environment. Being able to test single pairs may be all you need to test this strategy but then its really the same strategy we started with and not one I am commenting on.

--- 帖子 #453 ---
I looked at your thread and never posted because you spent a lot of time speculating about "when the big boys come into the market", and what the market does, and how you have set your EA to work with this etc, etc.  The market is just all the price movement - sometime it is Hedge funds, sometimes it is sovereign funds, sometimes it is news events ...whatever makes the price action is the market.  Speculation is a waste of time.  Patterns you think you see are just the human brain trying to make order out of chaos.  Your story on your Euro/CHF scalper is proof of this.

As to your second point.  Why would it be harder to reach the pp - if you have three buys and 1 sell then price moves up - you will hit your pp with a one pair EA.  Same if you have a buy 3*E/U, Buy 1*U/J and Sell 1* E/J,  its just the synthetic net resulting pair that moves you to your pp (the example is not exact only to prove a point).  It might be quicker or slower since the timed 15 and 45 min entry period effects which pairs also open and when.

Both setups get effected by the fantail failure pattern (although more complex for the three pair model).

It is all about the EA simply managing the price action, with smart filters built around it - this is why this EA has potential.

Tim

Hi Sidhujag,

So according to your opinion, do you think this Art phantom full is better off in terms of long term baskettrading? I am asking this because I would like some expert advice before I do the real money test for months.

Thanks a lot

LP

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Not if the EA is already active and moves into a net direction.  In other words you are already into a profitable move then use some sort of filter (I gave you a simple SMA as an example) to kick in and maintain the trend and not to close out until the price action reverses back over the SMA.  The EA could continue to add buy side positions as normal and the profits could be huge with a decent run.  Good R:R to me.

As the trend dies then the EA closes out for its profit.  The idea here is that the price action goes into a profit first before the trend filter holds the trades open.  If there is not trend and the price moves back and forth in a negative position then when the volatilty indicator shows a decline below its average maybe the EA can kill off the trade for a small (partially hedged) loss.

All ideas we can apply to our tool.

Agree with your other comments. I have no issue with what you are saying.

Tim

--- 帖子 #456 ---
I don't speculate "when the big boys come in to the market" I follow fundamental principles from what I learned reading about how to be successful. The knowledge passed down from someone who makes money to those who want to make money.

There has to be a time to enter the market... either through your SMA/ATR cross or knowing that market is open or closed.. that's all I'm saying... instead of entering blindly you can follow some kind of rule that will give you a better chance of closing quicker.

My scalper didn't take any fundamentals into perspective that's why it failed.

Some mathematicians say the market is noise and all random.. but tell that to the larger traders who make millions based on the same signal and can predict price of the next swing to the few pips.

By being net hedged synthetically you are essentially just paying spread except those times when the arber's aren't at work (usually never) and you get a few pips your way before they do get arb'ed. Like I said you are averaging your position but your cost will be the same in the end. Lets see the demo... lets see what the DD is like. I'm still analyzing my own baskets... all I did was set the phantoms to open at london open... look at the code its almost the same but a little cleaner to avoid you having to refresh the globals every day.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Well lets see...  I think we can agree that we are all still in learning mode. Knowledge is power.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Yes I liked your coding - you changed the globals to arrays as I recall.  Much better coding as I understand it (I am no coder).

I agree about the synthetic hedge - it it just paying more spread and in itself holds no advantage.  But from a phycological perspective it can help - many traders perfer having this mechanism to usurp there responsibilty to picking a direction - especially in choppy markets.

Tim

--- 帖子 #459 ---
THanks,

I also added a BE after H1 ADR (200) pips to avoid winners turning into losers. In any next version I'll probably make it so it won't add trades unless your previous one is already BE. This will make sure that you aren't adding risk to your basket but your offloading the same initial risk to a different entry point hoping for a little more movement to get your PP. Again can't test to see if this is a good thing or not.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
I wouldn't trade live until atleast 6 month testing is done.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
I'm not Jag but will offer my opinion anyway. I don't know how some people seemed to achieve such spectacular results with A P F. It simply didn't work that way for me and I won't be running it on a live account. That might be "much to my dismay" but from my own results, I don't think so.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
I will read your thread.

I beleive that three pairs will be better than six - time will tell.  Can you code your version for just the three pairs e/u, u/j, e/j?

On this idea of adding trades once other trades are at BE - you may find you water down the functionality of the EA so far that you will get it spending much more time in limbo since its opportunity to consolidate trades in one direction (and so take a profit) becomes too limited...???

I understand what you are trying to achieve.

A possible way to 'speed up' the trading process to test the mods might be to run a version that opens trades every 5 minutes and make the pp a lot smaller, or the risk a lot bigger,  to see how your mods effect the process in a shorter time span.  The EA should show up its faults pretty quickly under these condition...

Hello there, I believe it's right to continue open new positions because it will finish off what's left in the basket, once the current basket got close within this asian period, there will be no new basket(sequence) open, i believe that's how it works.

good trading!

Hello LP

I just thought I'd drop back by. I've been testing, running and cursing at EA's for the past four years or so. That may make me a relative newcomer to EA usage but I've “dabbled” in stocks trading since some 20 years ago and I'm currently a full time trader (of various and sundry instruments).

Currently, I'm testing EA's on 1pipfx (same as InvestTechFX), IBFX, ACM, and VantageFX. Also forex.com which has improved significantly after the large fine (but that's another story). After you've done this for a while, you get a “feel” for what might work and what might not. Sometimes I'm a bit hasty in my decision but “time is money” and I prefer to get on with it.

My idea #1 is to test an EA on the worst account, this presently being ACM. If it can survive the worst account then it stands a chance on a better account. I tested A P F and it did great the first trade sequence. It did survive the next but only closed after nearly 3 days and the margin level reached 180%. This was under basically “normal” trading conditions. For me, this is unacceptable.

Mostly, I just think that the 1 hour trade frequency is to “frequent”. If I cannot prove that then it is not so. Therefore, I've been making adjustments to the 4D version and the results are promising. I've had 3 accounts close with 1 to 3 trades and very TINY draw down (sometimes in just over an hour) and I'll post more about that eventually if things go well. I don't care about the Holidays because this version takes few trades (so far) and it will continue to run until I prove to myself that it doesn't work.

So far.... it just might.

Hello all,

My experience with APF on a small live account this week has been good. Certainly not proof of long term success, but one must start somewhere.

There seems to be much debate about adding this mod or that mod to improve this method to a point where lots of stuff gets constantly tested but nothing gets tested or traded long enough to see if it will succeed.

The whole idea of hedging is not to use indicators to try and find the direction of the market but to enter positions that will exploit the synchronization or non-synchronization of the basket currencies.

All versions do this but the downfall is large DD due to adding to positions. APF does not appear to suffer the large DD (MY max is -4.85%, currently -2%) . My APF has for the first time hit margin of <500% (that's my lower limit that I prefer). My solution was to pick a currency (in this case EUR/USD)  that was, for example losing $1.50 and one that was in profit for $1.50 and close them both.

The result was no change in account balance or equity but margin back to acceptable level.

At the moment the market cannot find its rhythm, so all we can do is manage the margin until it does.

In my opinion, not trading in certain periods is not the answer because then you are saying that forever and a day the market is no good during the Asian but good in the rest. The market sways as do various sessions, Asian may not be good this day, week or month but it could be the Euro or US session that does it next. I believe we should let the EA monitor all markets 24/5 and make its decisions accordingly.

When the market, like today is indecisive, I have closed some positions with no other net effect other than to restore margin. I am back to where I was yesterday waiting for the market to decide.

If, in the end I have too close all positions for a 1% loss against my gain this week of around 7% and wait for the market to sort itself, then so be it.

There is no holy grail so lets not try and find it. I am going to continue testing APF on a small live account, if it loses in the end, well that is the cost of doing business.

This EA is the best so far that I have seen because it does not try and determine what the market is doing, it lets the market decide and then jumps on for the ride.

That's my view, comments welcome.

Regards.

Hi TradeRunner,

Can you reiterate what "4D" verison is?  Is it the 4 trades per day version?

If so what other filters are you running with it?

Tim

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Very good point, and I do believe that cancel both (one earn one lose) is a very intelligent solution. you are right we should let the EA runs on its own, if we interfere it, then it will not be fully function as it should.

sincerely, very good thought again.

LP

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Hello Trade runner,

I am glad I see your post, cuz I now have another platform loaded on gomarkets with your version. Now I am testing 4 versions, 2 are the-game's version, one cut loser on, and one off.   3rd version is pure APF.   4th is your version. I will start them all tonight here in canada 12:55am sharp. will let you know how they do when i get enough stats. since gomarkets only allow 2 months, so after 2 months, i'll renew the account and start them all again, for a total of 6 months, then i'll let u know indeed which one has more potential. Like AA said, we gota try it right? haha

good trading to all!

Sorry guys, have edited my previous post, was using DD where I should have used Margin. No real change to my basic thoughts, still believe in letting the EA do its thing over all market conditions with a little manual involvement to manage

margin.

The only thing I did not mention was for those who felt comfortable, a close all function at variable DD level as insurance against a major catastrophe.

Hi all,

After having a good look over several of the other threads I am still convinced we are in the right track with three pairs trading.  (Although there is no reason why six pair basket EA can not create other risk mitigation options)

I am unsure that limiting the risk by placing stops on trades and/or moving them to BE etc during a trading sequence is neccessarily the way to go.

I am not sure that interferring with the EA's basic functionality (that being the creation of a constantly changing synthetic hedge) is not going to work in the long run.  This needs to be proved - so we need to keep tabs on Jag's work.  He might prove otherwise.

The time filter seems to be accepted across all variations.

I would suggest that the volatility filter that I proposed could also help the EA.

Increased R:R is important.  I am thinking that instead of a pp target, one option to test would be the use of a longer term trend filter.  This will create some real R:R, and is not some arbitrary risk reward ratio that we simply set.

Version = Art_Phantom_Full-Timings_&_Cut_Loses (I think it is extreme ... )

MMTU = 1

PPCT = 1

MFDD = -1.65%

Total Trades = 10

Duration = 10 hrs

This is the first time I see a basket closing during asian time....

Stay Tune

Won't shutting down several Euro/USD trades (be they positive or negative) destabilise the synthetic hedge position.  What if price action reverts to the positive side for that pair?  You are missing two of the contracts the EA has placed...

There is a Holy Grail - R:R and MM.

Tim,

When you refer to e/u, u/j, e/j are you saying to trade these if the phantoms are winners out of the original 14 pair basket during trading time?? Or are you saying that these are the only phantoms and also the only pairs to trade so you will get more trades.

Also after session ends would you keep trading to keep the hedge from wandering off or would you postphone until volatility picks up again by using the volatility filter?

art_phantom_fulltimings_cutloosers :

Max DD of 15.78 % and lowest margin 614 % on a 500:1 leverage account. Screetshot attached.

I dunno why EA is not cutting loosers here? What is the criteria?

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Hi Jag,

The original 14 pair basket sets the phantom zero point for each pair and then it is simply a matter for the pair to be in the positive and all other trades in the positive for the EA to place a new trade for that pair.  It will add no more trades than your version (unless you are employing the rule of only the most profitable winning pair in the Phantom basket is opened by the EA).

I would use the volatility filter in future - for now manually until someone codes it.  It might be better than the time filter and allow the EA to trade through the more volatile Asian sessions also.

Although my preference is for the EA to run once per day in the business market session (London) then wait for the following day - so I'd use the time filter also.

It is also worth looking at the idea of a pip gap between trades that ensures there is no build up of positions close to each other if the market is ranging as it is currently.  It shouldn't be a problem in a fast moving market.  (An external variable so we can set it and test gap width.  I'd consider ~10 pips for this gap.)

The EA trades every 15th and 45th minute.

Hello Tim,

It doesn't really destabilize the hedge, it just takes it back to a previous position and restores margin. This morning I closed 4 EU positions and 2 EJ positions with no loss of balance or equity. The DD stayed the same but the margin is now back to a comfortable level. I am now back to yesterday: 4 EU, 3 EJ and 2 UJ. When the market decides its direction and moves the EA will respond accordingly and start adding to only winning combinations.

Will it all work in the long run? Not sure, but what I do know is that if we continually keep adding modifications, indicators, widgets or whatever else we will never have tested anything for long enough to see if it will work.

RR and MM are certainly pre-requisites if trading in the normal way of trying to pick individual trends, I think when hedging a basket in the whole market context, then a different way of doing this is required. Still trying to determine the best way to do that, at this point managing excessive margin is the only solution I can come up with.

Regards.

Will be interesting to see if removing positions stuffs up the functioning of the EA (ie creating an imbalnce in the basket -that leads to greater DD as a result) or if you maintain profitability. Hopefully the later. Keep us posted.

I have harped on about several filters virtually from the begining of this thread. See my post above. None of them are designed to interfere with the functioning of the EA. I am certainly not keen on applying any BS indicators to try and predict a direct or any other 'widgets'. If I could code I'd have them all in there (time filter is there, but also volatility filter and max % fail safe options are not yet) and spend the time testing them. That's all I've ever been after.

For me the only further development would then be the addition of a longer term filter for exiting to maintain the profitable positions for greater pp. This can create a better R:R. In other words a flexible pp based probably on trend and/or volatility.

No other widgets - and no disrupting the functioning of the EA as it is meant to work.

One of the most common sense replies I have ever read. This is the second time I read to let the EA run 24 h, including Asian Session (the other one was from Vienna).

My Art_ Phantom_Full was not closed yesterday because it was not in profit so I let it during Asian Session, and it has just recover. Now + 11,75% since 23/10, max DD= -6,82%

Sure the DD will increase, maybe to a level wich the EA could not recover? I don' t know, nobody knows. Has someone test APF and reach a DD wich has not been never recovered?

We have to think about a possible help for the EA to recover when a certain DD level is reached but we have to let the EA do its job.

In this EA the edge is not the entry point, the edge is " the perfect syntetic hedge".

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Any coder could modify pure Art_Phantom_Full for just EUR/USD pair ?

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Morning all, have been lurking on this thread for a while now and am seriously impressed with the outstanding work and contributions

Special thanks to Caillou, the-game, Julesvh and others too numerous to mention

Although neither a coder nor an experienced trader (more of a newbie) I am happy to contribute by way of posting results achieved from a small GBP 1k live account started yesterday using Art_Phantom_Full-Timings_&_Cut_Losers.

So far:

Profit TD: 2%

UTH: true (default settings adjusted for broker time)

CLT: false

Max DD: -1.79%

Leverage 500:1

MMTU: 0.4

PP: 1

Kepp up the great work

Hello all,

After being in the doldrums most of the day and manually closing some neutral trades (see previous posts) the EA did its thing and closed out again for its 6th profit this week. I did allow for a closure of 0.5% on the last one as I prefer to start next week with a clean slate. Below are my results for this week (name and account number removed). The max DD figure is wrong, it was actually -4.85%. The reason for discrepancy is that I had to shut down my computer for about 3 minutes during the week. I did it just after trade open time, I do not believe it affected the results in a major way.

I hope I have attached the results correctly.

Regards.

At last the basket closed. Now I changing the parameter:

MMTU 1.6 (doubled from previously 0.8)

PP 0.4 (double from previously 0.2)

Other variables remain the same.

Let's see how the performance

Another Closure: +12.66%, max DD: -6.82%, since Tuesday, recovery capacity of this EA is incredible....

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Version = Art_Phantom_Full-Timings_&_Cut_Loses (I think it is extreme ... )

MMTU = 1

PPCT = 1

MFDD = -1.65%

Total Trades = 10

Duration = 4 hrs

Just my humble opinion. Neutralizing basket and allowing it to continuing is a great idea. I never thought of that

This is the only EA which I am quite comfortable to deploy to rescue my mini live account

--- 帖子 #492 ---
I have notice that at 13h15 (GMT +2) all previous EUR/JPY trades were in profit and the EA didn´t open a new EUR/JPY trade.

Anybody has notice something similar ? Maybe a similar problem like Navk ?

Really really strange.....

--- 帖子 #493 ---
I had since this morning both versions (xtrm & full) on 2 demo's

both on 0.5 PP , xtrm closed 4 times , full 3 times ,

full has a max dd 1.85%.

xtrm is running since yesterday, closed in asian session with max dd of 5.3%

start time 5 end 17

another close for xtrm ,2.5% since this morning

--- 帖子 #494 ---
But that basket got closed for me, euro/usd reversed, so the basket got closed. lol.

Anyway, the technical problem shall be looked at.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
calliou:

The EA"s concept you created seem to be working fantastic.

We can even continue to try testing in this way with out changing the concept. Only the MMTU shall be set such that we dont get stopped out, which i feel rare.

Let us contnue testing in this way for more days.

The cut looser option do not seem to be ok, i am running that EA and it cut down all euro/jpy (loss trades ) during europeon session, and profitable trades are running, but it has very high profit target to aciheve.

Also if euro/usd reverses at this time, the a/c might get stopped out. I am attaching a screen shot for your view.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
I made this mod, which has all the options as Art_Phantom_Timings_&_Cut_Losers-version from The Game.

The display is changed to my preferences.

But, it also has a "TradeonMinute A,B,C and D" input. So instead of a extreme, full and light version, this can be all in one. If you want to trade it as light, fill in 15 at A,B,C and D. If you want to trade it as full, fill in 15 at A and B and 45 at C and D. If you want to test to try and grab some momentum movement, fill in 10, 20, 30, 40. If you want to test..... Ok, you guys get the point. Play with these settings if you want.

Another new feature is the "Open_Loss_To_CloseTrades" input. If you don't want a TOTAL loss greater than, say 200 dollar, fill in -200 (Attention: it needs to be with the " - " !!!)  When your open profit reaches -$200, it closes all the trades and resets the phantoms to start all over again.

Feel free to test on demo. Haven't test it myself. If you don't like this version, fine. No hard feelings. I learn a lot making these mods. But maybe we get too many inputs this way so it becomes too hard to compare results and versions......

EDIT: CHARVO'S PIPSTEP IS ALSO ADDED. If you don't want to use it, set it at 1 or 0. (Don't know for sure if setting it to zero will cause problems) We have to test or maybe Charvo knows.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Good julesvh,

I shall give it a try.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
I agree with you. We have to test it this way more time, I have a lot of confidence, for now, the performance is splendid. I had stopped my Art_Phantom_Full Demo (closing manually trades open in profit before weekend gap) with +12.74% Gain, 4.25% daily, 106.01% monthly, max DD: -6.82%.

On Monday morning I will start a new test in a small live account.

So Navk your past problem not occur again since the basket get closed?

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Thanks JulesvH,

What I like is that we have all variables as options, so we can have pure or modified version.

If it works ok, you can send a pm with a description of each input and I attach it on post 1 instead of 3 versions.

Thank you, very great work

I opened a new 5000 $ 200:1 demo and started before europeon session on 26/11. Untill not three baskets got closed. WOW!

Simply fantastic!. I would like to run it through as i want to test this EA for all conditions including week end gaps.

Present equity 5148 $. Lowest margin 2207 % and Max DD 0.57 % !!

--- 帖子 #501 ---
Hi,

I have been watching this thread with great interest. My compliments to all contributors, in particular to MC, Caillou, Timmy for his incisive observations and JulesVH for the sterling work in putting all variables as options.

It has been mentioned before, but can Jules, or anyone else, also code in, as an option, a facility to close out a trade sequence after the trading window has closed once a basket reaches x% of the Dollar Profit target.

Keep up the good work

G

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Really Impressive. Please share your results with weekend gap, I´m sure it will recover if gap goes against our main position but it is important to know how quick it could recover.....

I not sure if anything wrong on my side but my light demo performing better than my phantom full, but both do not seem to match the good results being shown here(mainly full)

Phantom Light 500:1 leverage MMTU 0.3 PP 0.7
http://www.myfxbook.com/members/zealvix/demo-d/65989

Phantom Full settings same as above
http://www.myfxbook.com/members/zealvix/demo-c/65988

Both without any mods, only started a few days(might that be the reason?) ,started within a few seconds of each other

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Yes, I saw some demos with a better performance for Light Version. What are your max DD for each version ?

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Light : Max DD -2.4 Lowest margin 3420%

Full   : Max DD -5.18 Lowest margin 1746%

--- 帖子 #509 ---
With these results if I go live, it is clear for me: Light Version is sure more safe but with better gain, no doubts.

Maybe we have discarded too early Light Version, if market goes in our favour Full Version would perform better, but if not, Light Version would be more stable....

So in the long run, Light Version could be the winner......

Excellent report

--- 帖子 #510 ---
Version = Art_Phantom_Full-Timings_&_Cut_Loses

MMTU = 1

PPCT = 1

MFDD = -1.65%

Total Trades = 4

Duration = 1 hr

Profit = +1.3%

This is very very very short timing. All trades are related to EURUSD.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
Is it that if your initial balance is large, the different timings have to be use?

For example, my account is 3000 USD ( then MMTU 1 and PPCT 1 ) running extreme is okay however might not be so once the account hits > 5000 USD?

pl tell what you want. i can spend some time over the weekend.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
I think it all depends of your appetite for risk, this week we have had very good days for this type of EAs, so no problem for Full Version but if worst days comes, and they will come, Full Version could stock more trades, more DD and psychologically Light Version could be less stressful especially if you go live.

Maybe if somenone wants to go live, he could start with Light Version, and when slowly you trust this EA, then jump to Full Version, always if Full Version shows in the long run a better performance than Light Version, thing that has not yet done.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
Navk, what is your max DD for Light Version ? Could you post resuts for Full and Light together? Thank you

--- 帖子 #516 ---
Good morning all, please, maybe a bit off topic, will we have problem as MT5 going to replace MT4 soon. Even though I asked my broker about it, they said they'll provide both platforms, but i dont trust them as they are pure sales ppl.

any inputs are welcome

good trading!

LP

--- 帖子 #517 ---
i edited my above post, have a look.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Hi Roundrock,

We need to modify Art_Phantom_Light or/and Art_Phantom_Full to trade only EUR/USD.

EUR/USD must be in Phantom Buy Group and in Phantom Sell Group. Then when we run the EA a Phantom Buy Trade and a Phantom Sell Trade for EUS/USD begin. Each 60 min (at 15) or/and each 30 min (at 15 and 45) if the Phantom Trade is in profit and if all previous Real Trades are in profit then the EA opens a Real Trade (Buy or Sell).

The trades would be closed when we reach the PP profit.

Would it be very difficult to code this ?

Thank you

--- 帖子 #519 ---
EDIT: CHARVO'S PIPSTEP IS ALSO ADDED. If you don't want to use it, set  it at a low number like 1 (Don't know for sure if setting it to zero will cause  problems) We have to test or maybe Charvo knows.

If you already downloaded it. Please download this version so you have the latest one.

--- 帖子 #520 ---
calliou:

In my opinion both vesions are good and keep the MMTU preferably 0.5 and Profit 1.0. What i have seen DD does not seem to be an issue but at times the margin. So keeping low MMTU should help.

I kept MMTU 0.6 for lighter version and trades placed with 0.1 standard lot, so at worst i faced low margin 420 %. DD should not be an issue as the basket recovers from worst situation.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
Yes as I said it is just less stressfull psychologically, but this is a very good reason too, we have to trade confident and relaxed. If gain is similar, less trades and less DD is determinant:

--- 帖子 #522 ---
O ye, Jag, I had very similar story.  The system capturing retraces, doing martingale, OR SEEKING SURVIVOR LUCK will explode right after I finished "nice" backtesting/demoing and started LIVE.

now i realised that it is a rule, it is not about luck. it definitely happens.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
i can code this but cant test it as my broker doesnt allow same pair hedging

--- 帖子 #524 ---
No problem for me, I could test with my broker.

If this EA works good, I think I have a solution for US residents.

We need 2 Eas in 2 different accounts, then we can create an EA1 (Buy EUR/USD) on account 1 with real trades of account 1, and phantom trades of account 2 and when the P/L of real and phantom trades reach the PP, it will close the real trades of this account ( and the same for the opposite EA2 (Sell EUR/USD) on account 2). I don´t know if I had explained well.....

Well before this, if you could code it, I will test to see its performance.

Thank you very much

here you go...

i am not placing the welcome trades (buy, short) on startup. i dont see any value with it. rest is as per your spec. as this is FULL version, it trades every 30 min

pl be aware i didnt test this at all. let me know any issues

--- 帖子 #526 ---
I can also test it

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Woauuuu, Roundrock, you make me soooooo happy!!!!!

I will test right now......

--- 帖子 #528 ---
I shall test too .

--- 帖子 #529 ---
it placed the first order (buy) 13 min back

--- 帖子 #530 ---
It seems work absolutely perfect, I have an incredible feeling with this one.....

--- 帖子 #531 ---
pl take the latest EA from same post. i fixed a bug

--- 帖子 #532 ---
Done. Will start test on Monday Morning........

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Done.

Have 2 open trades.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
This is completely different than phantom...Really gr8 man. I would suggest to start new thread to monitor its performance. I havent check what changes you have made but i am planning the same method with two pairs EU and UC.

Well another disturbing thing in this ea is 'profitpac' something like that.. Can u replace this with simple take profit target in dollars?

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Thanks Roundrock.  this version should work on the MT4 backtester - but I can;t get it goning.  Can anyone else get it to work on backtester??

(Hedging with broker on backtester not an issue.)

Tim

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Question,

Using all symbol trades in profit- What happens if you have a sell trade and the market reverses. Your sell trade is now at a loss. If its at a loss how will the EA make a buy trade when it checks and see that all trades for pair in profit? Or am I missing something here? Its been a long day.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
I updated my EA to include some of Tim's suggestions for testing.

new ea is 2a.

Haven't done the 3 pair thing... do it in 2b maybe.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Hi guys,

I set my live APLite "stop after trade" input to true after taking 1%  and I didn't reset the input due to the US bank holiday-Thanksgiving.

My question is, do I reset global variables for the week to follow this weekend or leave it as is?

--- 帖子 #539 ---
I am still running demo's on Lite and Full and still believe that the Lite version has greater merit:

--- 帖子 #540 ---
good point. i fixed it

--- 帖子 #541 ---
ZZ, will it be very difficult for you to test it with "pipstep" incorporated?

in other words, a previous position of a pair xxxyyy MUST have at least "pipstep" floating profit to open a new position, instead of merely > 0.  in this way, EA does not open multi positions at similar level.

my feeling is that using very small MMTU, plus "pipstep", the EA seemingly should be very difficult to get in high DD.

--- 帖子 #542 ---
1. extreme, default pairs

2. full default pairs

3. light default pairs

4. full, default pairs, but with pipstep 20 (started late, wednesday I believe)

All started with 1000, 300:1 leverage, .4 mmtu, 1 pp

Stats after one full week (except #4):

1. 4 closures, current balance 1040 (up 4%), current odd -$32 (3.2%), max dd 9.3%

2. 7 closures, current balance 1077 (up 7.7%), current odd -$40 (4%), max dd 8%

3. 4 closures, current balance 1040 (up 4%), current odd +$4 (0%), max dd 8.8%

4. 0 closures, current balance 1000, current odd -$2.5 (.25%), max dd 1.9%

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Thanks Jag, I will have a look at it.

Tim

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Impossible for me too....

--- 帖子 #545 ---
For now I agree with a best Light Version Performance

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Is it possible to reduce our exposure to risk?Maybe. What do you think about this....

Our biggest risk situation comes when we have an unbalanced basket (for example 5 Buys, 1 Sell) and then the pair goes down. What about if the EA check the Ratio Buys/Sells and when it reach a certain level (4, 5,...) (we have to fix this or made as an option) it closes the basket as soon as the P/L becomes positive (no matter how much) ?

Of course we will loose some winner baskets but we will avoid the most risk situations.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Can't backtest too.

Not really a coder(though learned some java in the past), but it seems the EA is still keeping track of all the other symbols etc with plenty of related variables(same for art phantom), might that be the problem?

--- 帖子 #548 ---
I think this mod with Charvo' s Pipstep could decrease DD very significatively.

Roundrock, could you help us one more time to make Art_Phantom_Full_Ratio_Pipstep_EU (we would change the name obviously) ?

Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #549 ---
Maybe....

--- 帖子 #550 ---
i rewrote the code so that we can backtest. this is a single pair phantom strategy, you can drop to any chart any timeframe. it will trade that pair and that timeframe. if you drop it on EU 1 Hr chart, then it will trade EU pair and adds are done on start of the hour. if you drop it on 30min chart then it trades every 30 min at start of bar

when you start EA , it remembers the current price. then at start of the next bar, if the pair has moved up (with respect to start price), and if all prev Long trades are in profit then it will add a Long. same thing on short side. if total PL exceeds the Percentage Profit it will close the basket and resets the start price and new cycle starts...

i need to do lot of cleanup of code, but its working. MMTU, PP can be changed as you like.

now i request all of you to tweak the MMTU, PP to come up with the results. need analysis on how many max trades opened for any big DD. In such situation if we reduce the MMTU, does it solve the DD issue without effecting the profitability.

we need to come to conclusion on whether the idea will work at all in all market conditions ? if so, what would be the ideal MMTU, PP for a given leverage, account balance

with this EA, you can backtest and also firward test on demo.

PLEASE BE AWARE THIS IS NOT SUITABLE FOR LIVE TRADING. I cant guarnatee its bug free.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
with 10k account 200:1 leverage, MMTU 0.2 (lotsize 0.1), PP 1%

H1 chart

Nov 2010. i got 10 pops. that means 10% profit

M30 chart

Nov 2010. i got 22 pops. that means 22% profit

on H1 chart, i tested from Jan 01 2010 till date, account didnt crash. it ended up with 70% profit

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Hi Roundrok, excellent work as always. I' m not at home now. Do you have more results: 6 months, this year, ....

Would it be very hard to code with Rate and Charvo' s mod in order to backtest it?

Thank you

--- 帖子 #553 ---
And for Forwardtest on Monday is it better this version or your last one?

--- 帖子 #554 ---
I just tried it now backtest, it is not working, it is not closing all the trades when it has to, just randomly

--- 帖子 #555 ---
before you start backtest, you need to hit F3 and delete the global varaibles. it closes when the PL reaches the PP.

you can see the print statements in journal.

only the last cycle will be closed by the backtester as it reaches the end of testing period

--- 帖子 #556 ---
i would suggest this one, as its more convinient and we can try different TF and different pairs.

my initial testing reveals 30min is better than 1 hour

i tested this for full year 2010 on H1, it survived !!! it ended up 70% profit

--- 帖子 #557 ---
I imagine you run for backtest 24h with above settings? So if we load on M30 it checks at min 0 and min 30?

On H1, not the better TF and without any mod it recovers any DD during 2010? Veeeeeery promising results

--- 帖子 #558 ---
%

Caillou, my focus right now is to have a basic EA with original idea that we can backtest to see if it survives !!!  once we prove that it can survive, then we can add tweaks to improve profitability. so lets backtest the basic idea and coemup with results

if it survives, i would be happy with a consistent 5% monthly return (without any fear of losing the account) with simple system rather than trying for a 10% return with tweaks that may be complex and/or inconsistent

my immeadiate goals are

1. prove it survives

2. arrive at optimum settings (MMTU, PP for given leverage, account balance)

3. build confidence in the system to go live (after cleaning up the code)

--- 帖子 #559 ---
did it , still not working

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Absolutely agree. Let' s test the pure version and later, with optimum MMTU and PP we could add mod if needed.....I know it is early yet but as I said before the recovery potential of this EA is amazing....

--- 帖子 #561 ---
as i mentioned i tested on hourly chart and M30 Chart. this EA places orders at start of the bar. that means for M30, at 0, 30 min.  on hourly chart at 0 min

regarding recovering DD, i didnt analyse the results in deep. but it survived and closed the year in 70% profit. we can see the report and figure out how many max trades between each pop. lot of times its around 10 trades. but since some are long and some are short the total DD is not much. you get max DD when the current price is near the start price.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
can you try for just 2 days ? and then see the jornal, report and see whats happening ?

when you say not closing, what does it mean ? is it not closing when it hits PP ? or when it hits PP, its not able to close all the trades ? lets say we have 10 trades when it reaches closure, instead of closing all 10 trades is it closing only few of them ?

pl give more details. pl note after a pop, it places 1 buy, 1 sell at same price ... dont know why but thats what they mentioned. pl give more details..

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Hi Zznbrm,

A few observations:

1.- You mention Charvo twice, this is not Charvo' s thread, this is not Caillou' s thread, it is the thread of every person interested in Art_Phantom EAs, so if you want to speak only to Charvo, please send him a pm.

2.- Obviously, your test doesn't reflect Art_Phantom EAs's operating mechanism, so your results might be better, worst but sure not the same than Art_Phantom EAs so please, don't confuse anyone.

3.- If you have rewrote Pure Version, please share it or otherwise don't sell us something that you are not going to share.

Thank you very much

--- 帖子 #564 ---
charvo is the one who specifically asked for the test. So, I addressed him but posted here so that others could see the results.

My results show the "problem" areas - the points in time where the strategy has potential for some serious drawdown. I think that can be very useful information. In fact, you can use this information to analyze the market during these potentially bad times in order to adjust the strategy for maximum longterm profits.

There are a quite a few variations of the Art Phantom EAs...too many in fact. I think the thread is quite confusing anyhow. But point taken, I will not post test results again.

Like I stated, I have every intention of sharing the version I created once the thread goes in 1 direction, not multiple directions like it is now.

Well, now that I think about it, it appears I have overstayed my welcome. I wish you much success with your strategy.

FYI, the opposite of "win" is "lose", not "loose".

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Caillou, I'm sorry but I do not understand how to load the EA and in those charts...Can you help me ?

opened 4 pos, then closed 2 of them  (PP 0.5)

then opened 6 new pos ,closed 1 of the first and 4 of new for 0.4 p

then opened 2 new pos -not on right time- same time as last was closed,

then closed 3 positions-with loss and opened same time 2 new-...

Hi roundrock,cailou,

Thanks for your EA. I shall test this latest version.

I have a question. Can i use this EA in different pairs in same account?

I mean in one 5000 $ account, i will use this EA in euro/usd ( 30min) and euro/jpy ( 30 min ) ? or only in one pair?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Let's wait for Roundrock, but if we have one balance for both pairs, maybe the  2 EAs will close all trades when the General Equity Target is reached.....

I' m not sure......

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Hi Jag,

I don't understand why you're always talking about a 20% SL, this EA has not a SL, no MC's or mine version has never had a SL, we are just testing an idea and I prefer concentrate my time in how we can help this EA in recover a DD.

Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right but what I' m sure is that this EA will always recover if we are able to maintain the DD below a fixed level. This level and what to do in order to not to exceed it is what I'm going to concentrate. If we achieve this, who needs a SL?

And why the original idea is the best one? If we follow the original idea why are we talking in this thread? An hedge is possible with 6, 3 or just 1 pair but yes, is differeent, with just one pair the correlation is 100% always, not 90% or 80%.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
You don't bother me. What I said is with this strategy a SL will not work in the long term, because you have to put the SL enough far to give the EA a chance to recover and if we do this, as you said the R:R is so bad that in the long run it will not be profitable.

So sorry you are wrong, this strategy has not a very bad R:R, because there is not a SL.

That is what I think that to make this EA profitable we have to look for something diferent of a SL. Maybe I will not find it, then I will reject it and look for another strategy.

But for now I have enough motivation to look for something different of a SL.

Maybe I like to waste my time but for now it is my time and I will do with it what I want.

Maybe as you said I'm wasting my time, but at least I believe in something, and I defend to the death, till I realised I'm wrong.

You said an EA without a SL will never work, maybe there is something different we can try.

Thank you for your advice, but show me only one EA with a SL that works under any market. You can't because if you could, you would not be here in this thread looking for something. Me, I believe in this EA and that's why I have no time to write in others threads. For now all that I need is at home, in my thread. Could you say the same?

--- 帖子 #574 ---
Honestly sid, Just MHO; I don't think anyone really cares about your negative thinking regarding the experiments in this thread. You're acting like this great know it all parent that wants everyone to not go down the same road you already did when in fact you probably didn't listen to the same advice given to you by others and going down this road is the very reason you know what you do. Why not simply allow people to live and learn in their own way. Who knows maybe someone might see something you missed... err... maybe this is why you're cluttering up this thread so much with your na-do-tell attitude? I can say that I for one have read every post from the beginning including MC's Basket14's and this is the only time I felt taking precious space by posting here was needed. Hang, listen even contribute but stop the darn dragging down of this thread and it's higher thinking with your negative attitude please.

TJ,

Sure I may have missed something but this why I ask the questions on why a certain decision was made... like why do you choose to use a single pair? I brought up my point on why I think it doesn't do any good.. now its up to you to prove me wrong... isn't this what public forums are all about... many minds are greater than one? Sorry if I sounded like a "know it all" I'm usually annoyed by that myself I just try to learn from people making money and apply the ideas.. atleast I try to... so in doing so I'm simply stating opinion... like I said before demoing will prove everything and my first post today was all about this.. to gather statistics on the win rate to understand when to cut your loss.

Isn't ensuring you always have an SL right up there with don't hold positions over the weekend in trading 101?

Anyways maybe you can humble us on what you think if you're wasting your precious time letting everyone know that I'm "cluttering" up the thread.

But I agree I'm probably too negative and I'll tone it down to simple questions. I don't want to get anyone disinterested in the thread just because of my responses... I'm sure there is potential here for anyone who wants to put in the work.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
Now I'm wasting my time and as you said time is money so I'm sure I don't bother you if I said thank you and see you, I think I will not improve the EA with this discussion so thanks again for your advice.....

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Oh, one last thing, I don't have to prove you wrong, this is not a competition, not for me, I think you had better try to improve your EA, maybe you have forgotten a little.....

--- 帖子 #578 ---
And come on, you really think someone could get disinterested in the thread because of your responses? Really? Your negative attitude only shows your desire that anyone could achieve what you have not succeeded in achieving......

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Totalitarian never! A lot of people had critized but with constructive attitude, not destructive attitude.....there's a big difference, I'm not the only one who as noticed that.....

--- 帖子 #580 ---
I already apologized for the destructive view and said I wouldn't put it down anymore. What more do you wan't Spaniard?

Just like you haven't figured out the basics of trading maybe someone will come in here and not bother with it because people having conflicting views.

Don't give up your trading style until the end... hopefully you trade live one day aswell... add liquid to the market for someone else lol

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Spaniard? I think I never insulted anyone, and much less to want someone to lose his money.... No comments.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Lets keep this thread from going where too many have gone before. Keep the egos in check. If you dont agree with someones point of view or idea, fine, move on to the next post. Threads getting long enough without reading 2 pages of a pissing contest. If you want to use a stop then use it, if you dont then dont. Lets face it we all are not going to agree on how to run any system. I personaly think there should be some kind of protective stop on the EA. Others dont, thats fine it is their money to do with as they please. Lets just keep it on topic guys please..ok.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #583 ---
But I will not allow any insult, ok?

--- 帖子 #584 ---
this version works only on one pair. but its easy to make it work on multiple pairs simultaneously. but its not recommended due to MMTU issues. you could easily get into a huge DD with multiple pairs

if it works well on one pair, we will make that change later

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Toning it down would be nice thank you.
We're not trading T101 here the last I checked, also it is not my place to humble you. Cluttering up the thread with non-thread related messages (like this one) is what I ment by that.

I for one get disgusted when a perfectly good uplifting thread like this one becomes a dart throughing contest just because one person out of hundreds feels like he is the only way to success in the thread and will not allow the moderator lead according to that persons ideals... throwing around his weight as if no one else around has been where he has.... trust me man I been there and surely many others here have too. Like I said previously, offering help, suggesting helpful ideas which are in the 'spirit' of the moderators plans are what make threads really good; if that were not so, then there would be no need for thousands of threads. Only one would ever be needed. Since everyone has their own tunnel-vision-views there would be no need for different topics, moderators, sets of followers and different points of views. That one thread would have not only your poignant views but everyone elses too to destroy any semblence of order there too.

TJ

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Yes you make a good point. Maybe I need a drink lol

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Hi, Caillou:

Thanks a lot for your creative idea and this thread.  However, I'm writing this post to ask that do you really think that your comments below is not rude?

No, this is not for me, this is for ZZ or anyone else who is talking about normal/serious stuff.  sometimes it might seem deviating/unrelated, but suggestions may be politely made.  Are you sure that this is the way they treated you when you propose your ideas including 3-pairs?

again, this is not for me, i still can PM ZZ for his results, but am upset to see such unfriendly, unkind, and meaningless confrontation.  after all, ZZ is introducing his analysis and results, not bragging how to be a great forum poster.

--- 帖子 #588 ---
i fixed the issue, uploaded the EA in same place.

earlier i used position to get the order for close, that didnt work properly

instead i am now using ticket number, so no issues

MQL is such a premitive language, its hard to understand why some simple things dont work. besides there is no debugger... its like cloding in dark

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Well done all who have contributed. I have been following this thread from the beginning. Eagerly checking each day to see what the latest updates are. I will start testing the single pair version as of monday and will share results.

Once again, Thank you all. Keep it up !

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Hi guys, just resending a previous post!

I set my live APLite "stop after trade" input to true after taking 1%   and I didn't reset the input due to the US bank holiday-Thanksgiving.

My question is, do I reset global variables for the week to follow this weekend or leave it as is?

Pete

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Thank you Roundrock

--- 帖子 #592 ---
I'm really sorry if I was unpolite, and I apologize for that. Maybe my english is very poor, like Zz suggested and could sounds rude sometimes.

Anyway sorry Charvo and Zz but I will never, never talk here about nothing else that Art_Phantom EA....

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Hi Pete,

If you want to follow your test next week at the same point before the weekend, don't delete the global variables....

--- 帖子 #594 ---
ok , it works now,thank you very much for fixing. I did a backtest with fxdd-fixed spread on e/u  ,nice result for nov. about 30% before closing it out for 20%  DD 33%

--- 帖子 #595 ---
What is exactly your problem?

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Yes, very nice results.....

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Thanks Caillou, I was just concerned that new trades on Monday may be triggered by old data from Thursday evening (Australian time)

Pete

--- 帖子 #598 ---
We have:

1-when to open

2-when to exit

The system is more defined if we have "3-when to stop" as proposed above

--- 帖子 #599 ---
From observation, let's say:

Extreme - fair/ok

Full - better

Lite - best

It's getting better as the interval increases (from 15 min, to 30, to 60 min). What if the interval increased to 75 min, 90 mins , or even 120 mins?

I just summarize my observation. May be someone has already done the test.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
vanupips, thx for posting results. can you tell us the MMTU, PP settings? are they default ?

how did you figure out DD ?

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Good observation Sayembara

--- 帖子 #602 ---
hello,Caillou,roundrock!

Please do not annoy,

they both do a super work-

I can admire her as a programmer-

I test all of them -

with me everything is on my home server

Please keep up the good -

honest words have never harmed -

if we all trade work here would test the team organize we were already on-

I  am thinking of working groups - each group focuses on a version and  provides them with data - currently being tested each what he wants and  post his idea is a good thing, but if we would organize us we would  be much more effective -

unfortunately no one has done the world-

but I thank you for the very good work here in the thread-

we stay cool and think of the ultimate goal making money!

Best Best regards

vienna

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Absolutely agree, next week I will organize that...

Thank you

--- 帖子 #604 ---
if you have not already noticed, there is a option to use trading hours filter. so you can only add during your favorite session, if you want. just change UseTradingHours to true and set StartHour, FinishHour properly (broker time)

--- 帖子 #605 ---
One more time, excellent work Roundrock. Thank you

--- 帖子 #606 ---
After Finish Hour will the EA manage the basket already open till PP adding new trades if conditions are met or not?

--- 帖子 #607 ---
I did not see this option ? can you lease post it again with this hour filter.

OK, have it now.

My backtest without fiter:

30min E/U from jan till now 95% DD 70%

15 min looked better ,but I only succeeded the backtest for 6 month, sometrhing went wrong , does not work.

1H did not succeed in backtesting, got errors.

I replaced now the ea with new version with filter, but it is hard to backtest , it is suddenly going very slowly, I have no idea why

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Whoever is interested in strategy tester for full(30min),PM me with email , will send it

--- 帖子 #609 ---
yes it will manage the trades 24x7

it adds only during the specified window

i guess its same behaviour in all such EAs posted here

--- 帖子 #610 ---
hi vanupips, how did you measure the DD as 70% ? becuase right now the EA doesnt have that feature to measure DD

--- 帖子 #611 ---
Perfect

--- 帖子 #612 ---
roundrock,

We won't be able to use this single phantom unless we are allowed to hedge, right? thanks

--- 帖子 #613 ---
I think you are right but if it works, there could be a solution for non allowed hedge brokers......

--- 帖子 #614 ---
Am allmost done with backtest 30 min from jan till now with time filter :

+ 30% , max DD about 20% (this is aprox, looking at strateGy tester)

PP is 0.5

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Roundrock or someone else

Can you please point out where exactly your latest version for single pair is placed in this thread?

Well I am looking forward for two pairs EU and UC with same method.

Thanx in advance.

--- 帖子 #616 ---
I load the 'EA on a chart (eg GBP / USD), and then what? He manages all the pairs ? Or should I load the EA on 3 graphics? I do not understand the logic of how it is handled basket.

What EA? Please read the thread, I'm sure you will find your answers

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Hey vienna!  I'm glad to see you here

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Hi Caillou,

I think vienna's suggestion is a good one.

You may include me if you like. I have 8 computers at my disposal all running 24-7   of course I already am testing several versions now but only running a couple days so need more time before I post about them.

I feel one problem is the versions are updating so fast it's hard to know which ones to continue with and which ones to kick in favor of starting the newer one.  While I'm not at all against quick version updates, if you have the mind to instruct: 1) which to test, 2) for how long and possibly even 3) the settings you'd like to see tested out to us, I think that could help alot.  Just MHO is all.

TJ

--- 帖子 #621 ---
May I suggest you post the backtest so we can see that it is viable.

Regards TJ

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Hi TraderJoe and everyone,

You're right. As I said before Vienna's suggestion is very interesting. The thread in only one week has gone extremely fast what is good but we have to make a calendar, in this way we will set goals and time to achieve them.

About the EA, please correct me if I'm wrong, I think "Single_Pair_Phantom" is the best candidate to test seriously for 2 reasons:

1.- In my opinion, the performance might be better with only one pair: the main advantage of this EA is the Hedge and with one pair it could be more efficient, less trades will be taken and less spread for each basket.

2.- With only one pair we could do backtests, a big advantage that we must use.

I have not rejected the 3 pair version but I think it is better, easy and quicker to test 1 pair version.

Our main goals would be:

1.- Set optimum MMTU and PP for a good Gain/DD.

2.- Set if needed some filters to minimize DD.

What I suggest is:

1.- Week 29/11-3/12:

a.- Trough Backtests we have to set Goal 1 and maybe we could find 2 optimum settings: aggressive and conservative, each one with a different MMTU and PP. For now I think most people have used MMTU:0.4 and PP: 1.0. I think 2 traders would be good to confirm results. We will call them Trader A and Trader B. We have to test EUR/USD, M30, for this month, this year and a more bigger time (we can decide this).

b.- Trough Forwardtest, we have to think about Goal 2. For this, a brainstorming could be interesting, then we can choose the best ones according to all our opinions. The more suggestions, the more possible potential.

2.- Week 6/12-10/12:

a.- If needed some filters, we could ask Roundrock to include in the EA the best winners modifications. One more time, thanks in advance.

b.- Trough Backtests, we have to test the new EA version with mods. for aggressive and conservative settings. I think the best in order to compare first and new version is that these backtests were made by Trader A and Trader B.

3.- From Week 13-12/17-12 till ???:

a.- We can make a Forward Tester Team: 50% with aggressive and 50% with conservative settings, the same day, at the same hour, with diferrents brokers, each member could start a demo in order to compare results and test the stability of the EA.

b.- After some weeks of test ( we have to fix how many weeks), the same Forward Tester Team could start a live trading with a very small account (or not, it will depend of each trader), in order to compare results between Demo and Live.

If we arrive to stage 3-b with good and stable results, I think we could feel proud. After that it depends of each trader.

As you suggested TraderJoe, I count on you.

So the first thing is to have Trader A and Trader B. Any voluntary? Of course, we can have 2, 3, or more, we only have to organize....

--- 帖子 #623 ---
I think we need a spread filter.

My version just traded a EJ buy with a 24.5 pip spread!

Is there any way of tracking the normal spread for each pair besides going to your brokers page and looking up the typical spreads for each pair?

--- 帖子 #624 ---
Pair: EURUSD

TF: M15

Starting Capital - $1000

Leverage - 500:1

MMTU - 0.4

PP - 1.0

*** I've added the PipStep = 10 mod in my own backtester as the only filter ***

Period: 02 Sep 2010 to 26 Nov 2010

M15

---

EDIT: After a second backtest, the account was STOPPED OUT LOL!  FORGET IT!

******

Using the same settings, but on the following time frames:

M30

---

Last Fully Closed set of trades at 23 Nov 2010 17:20

91.25% Profit

H1

--

Last Fully Closed set of trades at 23 Nov 2010 18:25

73.87% Profit

H4

--

Last Fully Closed set of trades at 23 Nov 2010 18:12

18.44% Profit

D1

--

Last Fully Closed set of trades at 23 Nov 2010 03:06

17.39% Profit

So far, the results are telling me that...

The higher the timeframe the lower the DD (lower risk of margin call), but lower profit expectancy.

i.e. - M15 was a profit monster until the margin call.

Using that information, I would use Art_Phantom_Light as it gives good profit with lower DD than Art_Phantom_Full.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
if you mean manual tracking? or built into the EA shown onto the chart?

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Hi Caillou... so we go with the 1 pair basket version till it is proven one way or the other, then if needed, we can pickup again with the 3 pair version and prove or disprove it.

In order to avoid assumption errors I suggest the full name of the EA each person decides to test be redundantly posted somewhere in every post where any kind of test or settings results are posted - No Accronyms! - there are just too many versons floating around to be able to keep clarity going within a team without doing this, IMHO.

Need (at least) 2 team members (maybe 4) to confirm Results for testing MMTU=0.4 PP=1.0 on two separate platforms.

I'm thinking we should also have some diversity of leverages for instance 500/1, 100/1 and or 50/1 in these tests too.

TRADER A MMTU= 0.4 PP=1.0 LEVERAGE=?

TRADER B MMTU= 0.4 PP=1.0 LEVERAGE=?

NOTE: We need a full (common fields) list of Settings to be tested before we can begin to hand them out.

Above are two i.e., [MMTU= 0.4 PP=1.0 LEVERAGE=] are their any others, if so what are they?

NOTE: Backtesting should only be used for the purposes of finding MMTU and PP settings close enough or "in the ballpark" so to speak for Forward testing purposes. This way we can save time getting close enough to forward test and find the MMTU and PP sweet spots.

On a Personal Note: I have had many hours behind the backtest wheel and my suggestion here is to only use 99% backtesting.

I am currently working on building (hopefully have it soon) an up to date (data-wise) 99% backtester (maybe someone else here already has one? Although I do currently have a 99% backtester with about 3 years of data but the data is not current and ends somewhere in 2007-2008 I believe. Nevertheless, it can still be used to dial-in an "in the ballpark" setting for MMTU and PP to forward test from there. If you'd like me to use it let me know meanwhile I'm still putting together the updated one.

Regarding the brainstorming. I'm thinking a skype room (or equivilent) or even a separate thread may be best for brainstorming since that type of activity might caues too much commotion and clutter in this area? Then the agree ideas could be brought into the thread. How do you feel about this?

We need to continually refer back to Caillou's post #631 as we continue to avoid having to quote such a large message everytime.

TJ

--- 帖子 #627 ---
166,25% ????

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Caillou is looking for team members to take on some of the testing Caillou && RoundRock will be needing.

Those interested please reply with how many systems can you reasonably test at the same time.

My opinion is that one normal computer should be able to run at least 2 platforms if not 4.  More is certainly doable but then again it does depend on that particular computers nuances and what you are currently already running on it.

---------

If you are not experienced at running EAs but would still like to help, I found a couple of tutorials on youtube which should help get you up to speed. I was going to post them but then realized posting these links may be against FF policy so just google "How do I run an EA on MT4" and you'll find plenty of help.

If you wish to be apart of the team please sound off and I'll make a list.  Please keep the messages as brief as possible

TJ

--- 帖子 #629 ---
start with $1000 ended up with 2662.51, Net Profit  is $1662.51, meaning Net Profit % is 166.25%

Doesn't matter anyway, my second backtest was STOPPED OUT, meaning my account had no margin to trade with.

I'm not sure how reliable the MT4 Strategy Tester is if it gave me two different results in the space of 15 mins between each test.

Maybe it downloaded more data? I don't know...

EDIT: Seems like when it catches a HUGE bull run, therefore will add many buy trades, then the trend suddenly goes short that's when you can experience margin call.

For now I'll be sticking to my Art Extreme with just the PipStep = 10 filter

--- 帖子 #630 ---
My computer can easily manage 2 platforms running at the same time, 24/7. Would be glad to help with testing the 1 pair EA, let me know which EA/settings to test

Still, there's a couple of questions I still haven't gotten around: Somewhere along the thread sidhujag shared a code (based on the 6 pair EA's) that didn't rely on the global variables to work, but instead used a different type of calculation for the baskets (I have to mention that I am no coder).

From what I understood, this type of coding for the "phantom" EA worked better than the one we're using right now? Maybe (Probably) I'm mistaken, but can someone please elaborate a little about this specific issue? How often do we have to delete the global variables for the EA to work fine? I still haven't got this piece of the EA figured out.

Thanks beforehand and sorry if this question has already been answered before (I don't recall it though).

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Hi roundrock,

The Trading Hours code you implemented in the backtester version of Single Pair Phantom does not use the StopAfterNoTrades flag, it simply just stops the EA from trading at all.

During the non-trade hours, the EA should continue to try and "finish" an existing sequence of trades or if there isn't any open trades, just don't trade at all.

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Yes, I think it is easier to start test with 1 pair.

Perfect for the full name of the EA.

Maybe Trader A 500/1 and Trader B 50/1 ?

Pure Version has only 2 settings: MMTU and PP, I think Time Filter or other filters must come later.

Maybe a new thread called "Filters for Single Pair Phantom" where each filter might have a brief description and the possible advantages in using it.

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Thank you TraderJoe for your help, thank you very much....

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Hello acostafulano,

Ok I have your request to help appreciate that, please confirm after reading the below.

As far as the EA's to be tested, as per Caillou's post #631 (please read if you haven't already) we will not be testing any of the phantom6 or 3's right now although we may head that way in the future after we have exhausted the newest creations by Caillou and RoundRock first which is based on a 1 (that's right "one") pair hedge. This may sound odd at first but when studied closely it is a very interesting prospect. For any questions regarding any of the phantom6 EA, please refer to the 'Basket 14 EA System which is monitored by MetaCoder. Also please read post #1 of this thread to be in understanding with the direction of this thread.

If you still wish to be a part of the EA testing here please advise.

TJ

Hi,

Thanks for your collaboration,

If you start a demo, you don't need to delete the global variables never, unless you start a new demo.....

My pleasure

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Okay... just trying to solidify which way we're headed at this time and remove any guessing for us who left our crystal ball at home

I'm assuming EU is the current pair choice?

I am also assuming "Single Pair Phantom.mq4" Post# 558 is the ONLY EA we are testing right now or are we still testing Full, light or others beginning right now?

Again we really need full filenames plz to get off on the right foot.

Okay Trader A 500/1 and B 50/1 good.

Pure Version? I don't see an EA named Pure Version, I assume you mean Single Pair Phantom.mq4, please verify?

The Filter thread is a good idea but first we need to make a list describing these filters. If you or someone can simply list the filters one by one I'd be happy to look them up and put descriptions to them. Anyone plz?

--- 帖子 #645 ---
hi the-game,

thanks for testing. in my view 1000$ starting capital is too low for this kind of phantom systems. try with 10k

or adjust your MMTU, PP. current settings are very very aggressive for 1000$

--- 帖子 #646 ---
it does exactly as you mentioned.

it doesnt add any new trade outside the window. but it tries to close at any time if PP is reached. you can test this in forward testing today

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Hi Roundrock,

No you need to re-read his post.  You are misinterpreting what the-game is asking.

We want the EA to continue placing trades after the trade window finishes to complete a trading sequence - if the sequence is not closed out for profit during the trading window.

This is critical so that the functionality of the EA is not disrupted.  So whenever there is an open sequence of trades the EA MUST have the ability to open positions as normal to close out for a pp even after the trade window closes.

The trade window is only there to limit the OPENING of trade sequences to the higher volatility period (or whatever period we set it for).

Tim

--- 帖子 #648 ---
I agree wholeheartedly, MC stated that $3000 is the absolute minimum for his Basket14 EAs.

But I just like to test with $1k to filter out the good settings.

Round rock,

I uploaded this EA ( single pair phantom) in euro/usd 30 min chart with following settings :

5000 $ standard a/c 200:1 leverage. MMTU 0.5, pROFIT 1.0.

I opened the chart and went out. When i come back i have noticed that the two trades ( one buy and one sell, both 0.13 standar lot) closed in loss, but there are more trades running with 0.13 lot size. When i was watching the screen it placed new trades ( one buy and one sell) but with 0.03 lot size this time and not 0.13 lot.

I attach the screen shot here. Can you tell me how the two trades get closed? i was under the impression that the whole basket will get closed in profit. Thanks in advance.

Inserted Code    if(UseTradingHours && StartHour < curHour && FinishHour > curHour) {
AddIfNeeded();

}

Hi the game,

Hi All

I saw the concept of controllers being in use in Asirikuy and in MAXX's bot (Master_EA)

Just my opinion if we are moving towards single pairs implementation, we might want to look at having a controller.

Here are something which the controller will do

1) As implemented in Asirikuy's Atoyl, the controller will check on correlation and gives permission for the trade to occur.

2) In MAXX's Master_EA, the controller is being used to check on the equity level.

There might be other useful things such a controller can do. But I don't have any exact things in mind

Just my two cents of thought

Hello all,

I have missed something with the single currency phantom that everyone is commenting on. If it only trades a single currency, how it is a hedge if it is not hedging against another currency in a basket.

I have tried to read back in the posts to find the answer but have missed it somewhere along the line. If you are using that method (single currency) why not just trade one currency in the conventional way.

Sorry to be a nuisance, but could someone briefly explain the logic.

Regards.

hi all, i'm new to this ea.. and when i tried to backtest, no results were showed..but when i go live this morning..it start to trade..sell 2 x 0.02lot EU  and sell 1 x 0.02lot UJ.. so, i try to redo backtest after i closed the trade..but still no trade...not sure why..^^

HI aajduk,

We have breifly commented on this in discussions between me and Jag in earlier posts.  You are correct there is no true advantage in trading the pure hedge.  EXCEPT the phycological one.  Where the human defers the direction of the single currency to the EA but does so on the basis of accepting the cost of additional spread in lieu of not being wrong in the trade  - since it ultimately wins out (assuming you have enough margin and equity)

The single currency EA, at the very least, allows us to backtest the viability of the filters we want to use with the three pairs EA.

Of course if we can create an edge through the filters we use - then they should work on the single pair EA just as well ....

Tim

--- 帖子 #659 ---
Thanks Tim,

So in other words it will open trades in both directions over time until the weight of trades of one direction overwhelms and hits the profit target.

Hi,

Yes, EUR/USD, Single Pair Phantom only for the moment, sorry, when I said Pure Version I mean without using any filter.

I think we have to backtest 3 variables:

- Timeframe: H1, M30, M15 (something else ?)

- MMTU: 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0

- PP: 0.5, 0.75, 1.0

- Time tested: November 2010, 6 months, 1 year, x years

Please check that, maybe I'm missing something

--- 帖子 #661 ---
That's exactly right.

--- 帖子 #662 ---
Roundrock, or anyone that can code.  Can someone please fix the Single Pair Phantom, roundrock (the version with pip step and time filter),

so that it will continue to trade an open sequence after the trade (sequence start up) window is closed.

The Ea is a waste of time as it is - since it often takes days for it to get into positions to continue trading... and so can take days to close out when it should have done so much earlier -  results are worthless until this fix is done.

Tim

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Very interesting approach. I have to look at this controller.....

Thank you

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Thanks for this report Navk.

Maybe we have to wait this week doing forwardtest before any backtest in order to be sure that Single Pair Phantom EA works perfect. Thus we have time to report any problem and we can bother again Roundrock and ask him to correct any anomaly......

Hi Vienna,

I'm not with my PC now, in 1 hour I will start the Single_Pair_Phantom EA test but for you the EA works properly? I said that because Navk have posted some problems.

Thank you Vienna

Hi,

It (the "Single Pair Phantom.mq4") is working fine.

Tests provided were produced on my 99% tester with 2.5 years of data (not current).

I tried to keep the dd below 30%.

I absolutely had to install a disaster SL or the ea's would crash every time on every setting and timeframe. I used a 100 pip stop.

With the 100 pip stop the stop only got hit one time.

The ea's run best on the 5m TF.

Settings that worked best hover around MMTU 0.2 to 0.4 PP 3.0 TO 10.0

The higher the settings the higher the DD

The MMTU causes more DD when raising than the PP.

Also, I tried the pipstep EA that was uploaded earlier and could not get it to take trades on the tester so I added the pipstep myself and ran it. It sucked compared to the regular "Single Pair Phantom.mq4" ea.

The file names hint at the settings and all the settings are at the top of the reports.

Going to bed now..

TJ

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Ohhh TraderJoe, we won a lot of time with your work, thank you very much.

When you say a 100 pip stop is for each trade or for each basket ? And how you set this SL, I mean did you modify the EA ?

Thank you very much

--- 帖子 #669 ---
I believe it's for each trade, buy and sell. The TP line goes right on the OrderSend() line i.e., OrderSend(Symbol,OP_SELL,Lots,Bid,Slippage,STOPLOSS,TP,comment,Magic,Color);

I'm not a coder and not even sure if the digits are correct because I haven't studied the original code but it seemed to work. I'll post that ea here and maybe RoundRock will take a peak

TJ

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Thank you, will test it....

--- 帖子 #671 ---
Sorry but for me, Single_Pair_Phantom EA doesn´t work properly, if I load in M30 it adds a trade wathever minute I load it, and not only in min 0 and 30.

Is it work ok for everybody ?

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Hello everybody,

just my few thoughts about that EA, regardless wether it is single or 3 basket :

MMTU : For example I have a Alpari UK micro account with down to 0.01 lot sizes and a MAX MMTU total of 2.0 lots. Also there is a 100 trades limit.

Thus I calculate : 2.0 / 100 = 0.02 lots base size to have optimum usage of my account. Now, for every 1000 eur I will use 0.01 lots, thus brings me up to not trade all of the EAs below 2000 EUR at least.

And my rule of thumb is for every 0.01 lots = 10 euro profit, 0.02 = 20 euro and 0.03 = 30 euros.

So at 2000 Euro account size I will use 0.02 lots and pp of 1.0 maximum.

If you run higher lot sizes on a micro account, you will soom be no more able to add trades to the account.

Now, some thoughts about the profit target : wouldn't it be a good idea to insert a break even strategy for each trade that already went positive (don't let a winner turn into a looser) ? I mean if we set a profit target at the beginning of a basket and have some positive trades already, why should we let them turn against us BEFORE the basket target is reached ? Close them out at least at break even or some choosable amount of pips and let rest run on ...

I hope you understand what I mean, sorry for my english too

--- 帖子 #673 ---
it added a 'buy' while previous two 'sells' have been in profit, it closed the 'buy' order in quite a loss, and following that, at 30th minute following, it opened a 'buy' order again. Profiting orders(sells) are still open...

--- 帖子 #674 ---
While we are at our first test stage for one pair phantom, APF is doing as always extremely well. It has recover from -10% DD in 2 hours...

Simply Spectacular.....

--- 帖子 #675 ---
Yes, Breakeven feature is something we must think seriously....

--- 帖子 #676 ---
Are you talking about Single_Pair_Phantom EA ? If yes, I´m with you. If this EA have some bugs, then backtest results too,.....

I´m going to try Art_Phantom_Full_EU EA, I want to see if this works ok....

Art Phantom Full:

Basket still floating since Friday. I found that the EA open 2 trades after the market open gap. The market reversed and these 2 trades are the extra loads to overcome.

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Hi everyone...

Right now I am not testing single pair ea... But I would like to stick with 3 basic version of first post of this thread. Out of these three full and light version is doing good so far.

Well single pair phantom discussion is going on. but i tested this ea for two pairs (EU and UC) and results were not impressive. The problem I saw is two pair ea keep struggling to close basket with profit. It create band of upper and lower price trades and keeps revolving in between.

I dont know how sigle pair ea is working..Please post resuls those who are testing this ea since morning.

Regards, TC

For me, the Phantom3_suv (lighter version) has recovered from 4 % DD and has closed the basket. Present balance is 6045 $ Up from 5000 $ since 17/11/10

21 % in 9 trading days !

ART_PHANTOM_FULL : The full version has opened the basket od trades on friday and has 17 open trades and margin is 980 %, DD 0.007 %.

--- 帖子 #682 ---
use this EA that has SL option. The StopLoss is paarmeterized. make sure you give this as per your broker. for FXCM UK its 1000 for 100 pips

--- 帖子 #683 ---
The single pair phantom has more problems, it started to place welcome trades at 0.13 lot size - two trades ( it closed in loss ), then continued to place additional two trades at 0.13 lot, then placed 0.03 lot, and now it is placing 1.22 lots. The present margin is 115 % any time it will stop out.  I attach the screen shot.

Round rock, pl note and see the problems. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Art_phantom_full :

The basket what i was talking about with 17 open trades just got closed in profit.

Present equity : 5205 $.

Up from 5000 $ since 26/11.

4.1 % up in two trading days.

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Ditto

--- 帖子 #686 ---
Calliou: I am extremely happy with t he performances of art_phantom_full and lighter vesions. The lighter version had a max DD of 6.6 % once but still it has recovered and since then i am seein a max DD of 4 %. This is quite ok for me.

--- 帖子 #687 ---
I am very impressed with this EA, i have been looking for a good EA for over six month's now and i think i have found it, i started to trade this EA on friday with my hotforex demo account and my equity is currently +190 pips, very impressed, but does anyone know how to change the lots size as all of my trade's are micro lot's, can someone help please? Good job though guys!

--- 帖子 #688 ---
I´m really happy too. Another closure for Art_Phantom_Full, now +18.17% in 1 week......

--- 帖子 #689 ---
Broker  = Easy Forex

Version = Art_Phantom_Complete

Success:

1) Able to configure for 0, 15, 30, 45.

2) Time settings also okay

Failure:

1) Upon reaching dollar profit target. EA doesn't close the basket trades.

Status:

Revert to the original version

--- 帖子 #690 ---
My APF demo is also performing nicely, MMTU 0.4, PP 1.0... Up $156 on a $3000 acct.. That's 5.2% in 4 trading days... Not bad at all! ;

I'm currently using Art_Phantom_Full-Timings_&_Cut_Losers, with the trading hours disabled, but still I noticed some issues with this version:

1. I haven't noticed any "loser" get cut

2. Even though this is supposed to be the "full" version, it's placing orders every 15 minutes.

Am I using the right update?

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Caillou which version are you currently getting this performance with?

--- 帖子 #692 ---
The "cut loosers" option did not work for me too. Try using the original versions posted by Caliou in the first page. It has no issues and fantastic results.

--- 帖子 #693 ---
Hi,

I´m using Art_Phantom_Full (Pure Version) from post 1, the original. I don´t want to use any filter for now, because for now, the EA doesn´t need it. When it need it (if needed), I will look for one.

My only doubt is weekend gap (results are without any manual intervention), because DD could increase quicker and then the EA will spend more time in recover...

So if I were live, I would stop manually on Friday when the floating P/L is in profit and reload the EA on Monday morning...

--- 帖子 #694 ---
Art_Phantom_Full_EU seems to work perfect so if you want to try the one pair version I suggest to use this one.

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Awesome. Will do that then, thanks for the suggestion

Still, The 15 minute version was performing quite decently

I'll give the REAL Full phantom a try

Cheers

Diego

--- 帖子 #696 ---
Will set up two accounts then, Art_Phantom_Full from post 1 and Art_Phantom_Full_EU

Will get back with results in a couple of days

Thanks a lot for sharing your efforts

art_pahtom_full-timings_&_cut_losers

MMTU 0.4

PP 1

Max DD to date-5.62%

Question: Is it necessary to reset global variables aftert each basket closure?

--- 帖子 #699 ---
pl mention tghe exact EA name you are using. if you are using a stoploss version, its possible it closes the orders that hit SL.

--- 帖子 #700 ---
No

--- 帖子 #701 ---
Yes, another closure........

--- 帖子 #702 ---
Gracias Caillou

--- 帖子 #703 ---
Hi,

I've been using the single pair phantom.mq4 from post #558 , I believe it  has no stop loss.

Regards,

--- 帖子 #704 ---
This one is doing really great too, gain is a bit lower but DD is half than Full Version:

- Full Version: max DD -13,92%

- Light Version: max DD -7,44%

--- 帖子 #705 ---
This EA (3 pairs &1pair) give excellent results when there is a trend, this has happened the last 2 weeks, we need to find a solution for when it ranges. Nice results for today are not enough to make it succesfull long term.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Calliou :

My lighter version had the best performance than yours. It yielded 21 % with a max DD of 6.59 % since 17/11.

Anyway full crdits to you only.

--- 帖子 #707 ---
I fully agree with you. For the last three weeks or so, the performance had been excellent but the euro was trending a lot. We need to see the DD when euro is range bound.

--- 帖子 #708 ---
Extreme since 21st November..

--- 帖子 #709 ---
I agree with you, it is extremely early yet. But when it ranges, we don´t know this EA´s performance, maybe worst, maybe better, we don´t know.

When the problem will arrive (and it will arrive), we can think in the solution but for now, I can´t resolve a problem if I don´t know the problem.

When it ranges, maybe Full Version is better because a very small movement (just 25-30 pips) is enough to hit PP but, we don´t know..

But I absolutely agree with you that it is too early, we have to test, test, test.....

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Yes, but mine is since 22/11.... anyway, full credits to all of us

--- 帖子 #711 ---
But for me, the EA s you created are the best performers i have ever used. I hope..hope it will maintain its performance during ranging period too. I am waiting for that to happen. Once it survives that period.... we can go with it for sure.

--- 帖子 #712 ---
hi guys..I am testing full with you.. excellent results at the moment..let's hope in good results in range markets too.. I have one question.. what is the importance on lotsize? do you believe that the lotsize could influence performance..?

--- 帖子 #713 ---
Art_phantom_full:

Untill now the DD has never crossed - 2.27 % and lowest margin 974 %.

The EA has successfully closed four baskets since 26/11. I will watchout this for more days.

The settings:

5000 $ standard account with 200:1 leverage.

MMTU 0.5, Profit 1.0.

If the performance is maintained, i will go with this settings for my live a/c too as it places less trades, DD less, no margin issues. All seem to be good with this EA and this setting.

--- 帖子 #714 ---
Important is MMTU, lotsize has no influence.

--- 帖子 #715 ---
navk,

I hate to drop a turd in your punch bowl mate .... but the simple logic of this type of trading will ALWAYS cause a death trade drawdown at some stage - unless there is some sort of fail safe SL or filters.  So while you are getting great results from this excellent EA (and I truely beleive it is a great concept), we still need to focus attention on how we can limit those occasional, very large DD's without killing off the system.

So please everyone do the testing on AP full and light etc, but take off the rose tinted glasses and keep developing for these filters.

The single pair EA provides an excellent testing tool to develop these filters etc.  (And may turn out usful as an EA in its own right)

The Single Pair Phantom WithSL, roundrock seems to work well and we can test to learn the dynamics of using a straight SL.  I am seeing some interesting results and dynamics.  Will discuss once I have some further constructive comments.

Tim

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Tim,

Did Single Pair Phantom With SL EA work properly for you? I haven't test this but as it is a modification of Single Pair Phantom and this one does not work well, I'm not sure.

What I'm sure is that Art Phantom Full EU works well but I can't run any backtest with it. So we have to be sure before test filters with an EA that the EA works as we want through forward test.

And I would love to be sure like you that something ALWAYS happen in forex, really, me I doubt everything.

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Of cource, we need to know the occasional stops which can erase the whole profits. I am checking/testing the single pair phantom with stop loss EA too. Today i uploaded into my chart and yet to trade.

Note : When some one mods the basic EA with filters, it would be preferable if they add some notes to indicate what modifications have been carried out from the basic EA so that the testers can change / alter the settings in order to optimze.

--- 帖子 #718 ---
I have seen here a Phantom EA with "CUT LOOSERS" option i just dragged it in to my chart and tested for a day. It cut down lossers and created a very high profit to achive with profitable running trades.

The price reversed and the account got stopped out. The basic principle of ths EA has been defeated by this modification "cut loosers". So in my view, if the Creator explains a bit about what the modification is, it would be nice.

--- 帖子 #719 ---
I have just noticed that Art_Phantom_Full_EU does not work properly for me neither. It closes trades with a loss and opens at the same time 3 Buys and 1 Sell.

For now, I think we can't test one pair version yet.....

--- 帖子 #720 ---
Today , Single Pair Phantom : MMTU  PP default

Closed and open

Roberto

--- 帖子 #721 ---
As we discussed previously - any addition to the system that disrupts the functioning of the EA - such as cutting losers - will likely have a negative impact on the EA (almost guaranteed over the long term)

We need a serious coder like Jag to refine what we are doing - and not adhoc changes.  (Or you Roundrock - but need focus to get the whole thing done without little spin offs here and there).

Project summary:

1/  sort out the single pair EA - so we have a tester EA to test filters.

2/  Add time filter (already available), add volatility filter (Jag has done so on his six pair EA - could ask for code), add SL per trade (done by roundrock - and I think the SL part is working - not sure yet about that version the actual EA for placing trades yet), add an overall max DD% SL to shut down an entire trade sequence (I suspect this will be much safer than closing individual trades at individual SL's - since the overall SL does not change the functioning of the EA, by upsetting the open basket of trades).

3/  Test these base filters and then consider any other general filters.

4/  The final stage is to look to add some trend or momentum filter(s) and hold the pp open (such as till end of trend/reversal) to achieve a solid R:R result, and give the EA an edge and positive expectancy.

Testing the basic 3 or single pair EA at the moment is like playing a soccer game without the goally and one of your strikers - you can play the game and against a weak team and you will win well - but when you come up against a tough team you'll get your shorts handed to you.

Come on guys lets get constructive and hopefully we will get some consistant programming to get this baby happening!!!  All we have at the moment is a pretty EA that we all like the look of .... but it will kill you when you go live as it is.

Tim

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Thanks RoundRock

--- 帖子 #723 ---
Hi all,

I have noticed my EA trading against the trend for the E/J and U/J pairs.

You can see the outcome of this when MOST of the trades for these pairs close in a loss, sometimes in a relatively BIG loss.

[E/J: (13/21) 61.9% trades closed for loss, U/J (9/14) 64.29% trades closed for a loss]

E/U pair is currently a sell pair and agrees with the current E/U trend, so this is the only pair that has been working the best and 95% (38/40) of the trades made have been closing for a profit.

I'm thinking of adding in a trend filter to prevent each pair from trading against it's own trend.

What does everyone think about this?

--- 帖子 #724 ---
Round rock,

Thanks for this EA which has stop loss option.

I am assuming that if i set a stop loss of 1000 in my fxcm demo, and if my EA place trades at 0.1 lot, the basket will stop out after the DD reaches 100 $ Right?

If this is right, then i would say keeping a 1000 pip stop loss is small simply b'cos for the basic version of the EA, we have seen sometimes a DD even 10 % but recovers the floating loss and closing in profit.

What is your opinion? If you ask me, i would say we should keep only emergency stop for this EA, means 15 % or higher depending on lot size and individual" risk tolerance.

Your inputs? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #725 ---
I don't like indicators...

So for now I will just add trade flags for each pair so that they can be manually set to true for trading with the trend and set to false for don't trade at all.

If someone likes to further develop this concept with the use of indicator(s), feel free to do so and just make use of the Trade flags below.

Add the following to the External Variables section at the top of the EA file:

(You will be able to change these in the EA settings)

Inserted Code extern bool   TradeEURUSD         =    true;
extern bool   TradeEURJPY         =   false;
extern bool   TradeUSDJPY         =   false;

Now, copy and paste the two lines of code I have inserted in the same place in your AddIfNeeded() code

(Don't copy my whole function as mine is vastly different and won't work with your EA)

Inserted Code //+------------------------------------------------------------------+
//|                     Add to winning trades.                       |

Hi guys,

Have tested Single Pair Phantom With SL (the one RoundRock added) and sorry to say it was very hard to get to make a full pass. In fact the only settings that allowed it to complete a test was leverage 100, $5000, 15m, mmtu 0.3, pp 1, and sl_190_to_200. If I change any of these one iota from these settings the pass would not complete. I'm sure there's a reason but I don't know what it is yet.

2 things.

can you make sure you have the same EA thats posted here (i have updated that several times and each time i mentioned it here. but i didnt change it in last 24 hrs. pl check the timestamp).

when you have issues with the EA pl provide clear info on whats not working and also look at the Experts tab, it gives useful info on whats happening. for example, here you can see 5 trades being closed

I can get it to run with pretty good results using high mmtu (say 5) and low pp (say 0.1).  You can run the SL at 100 pips.

Using 50:1 leverage.

Results (assuming the Single Pair EA_roundrock is working correctly) were, 25k profit, 22% max DD 22% a $50k account. (For 1 April 2010 to end of November)

The time filter was critical.

Tim

--- 帖子 #731 ---
Dont you think 100 pips stop loss is less? Assuming that the basket places many trades? At present the EA ( art-phantom-full- EU ) has placed already four trades, and do not know hoe many more will be added.

--- 帖子 #732 ---
Just need to fix the Single Pair PhantomWithSL, roundrock EA so that it will continue to trade after the (open sequence) trade window.

It will be very interesting to see what results we will get then, with the single pair system.

Tim

--- 帖子 #733 ---
ummmm... not sure if you realize what a jab some of those comments are.  I really don't appreciate the negative innuendos spread throughout your message here.

I'd say RoundRock is a pretty serious coder, wouldn't you?

Personally I wouldn't care if there were 50 serious coders here (in fact that would be really cool) as long as they are kindred sprits and want to go along with the intent of the thread and team members Caillou has put in place who follow his lead in general regarding this round of EA's.  I mean it is his thread and if someone dosen't like it then they should go find a thread they do like or start one of his own instead of trying to hijack or through mud around this and complicate the messages with crap like "we need a serious coder".

Re: Your summary list:

1. agreed

2. Not so sure about this because it's a little too soon.

I know from experience that when you add filters to any code, even though you may alleviate some of the problems for which you added the filter(s), there's always an opposite cost, a price that insidiously destroys the original robust ingenuity of the code.  We want and need the purest code we can have that works and you don't get that by piling on a bunch of filters on without lots of testing first, forward and backward.  Rome wasn't built in a day so let's cool our jets a bit on the filters. First we need to have a good mechanically working ea that is what we want on the basic level.  No one is going live with these EA's yet and if someone does they'll will be warned way before they get on line.  If they still do it then that's their choice, they know the risks.

3. more filters

4. more filters

Funny, I already thought we were being very constructive - everyone has been getting along perfectly, we been together what? 3 days? - then suddenly you pop in and say, we're not serious, we're adding adhock changes and we're not being constructive (why you would try to sneak that one in is beyond me  )

We already have a Coach, so if you want to play on the team with us, please understand to be apart of any team including this one is to become one with the members on that team - not another coach to lord over it or the team becomes destroyed.

It is true that We do need good ideas and people that genuinely want to help including all serious coders (jag too if he'd like to team up) but it's only common sense that we need the members to be apart of the whole group and not the second and third leader of it.

Okay back to work

TJ

--- 帖子 #734 ---
Is less than what?... not sure of your question.  Are you suggesting that the SL should be bigger? If so I'd agree on the basis that when testing on the single pair EA it is most efficient without this sort of stop loss.  You can see for yourself if you test it and make it bigger and bigger SL you'll get better results each time.

I don't like the individual trade SL , but at least is is something to test while someone gets to the other filters and fixes the single pair EA.

We would be better served with an overall max % DD SL, and other filters to improve the R:R and expectancy (and so reduce the chances of this overall max SL being hit).

Tim

--- 帖子 #735 ---
Untill now i can say that the original EA s posted in first page works fantastic. The modifications/improvements suggested by many dont seem to be ok, but let us wait.

I only hope that the modifications will improve the performance and not spoil the fantastic EA created by Colliou.

--- 帖子 #736 ---
The only filters I would add to the original EA are as follows by priority:

1) PipStep

Most useful to prevent over-trading

2) Trade with the Trend

Again, most useful to prevent trading against the trend (if I can get it just right)

3) Trading Hours

A conservative filter allowing the EA to avoid opening a new trade sequence during hours considered outside normal trading hours.

I personally don't use the Trading Hours filter as the PipStep is enough (if big enough) to filter out the chop during the Asian Session, plus if there is no chop, the EA will still be able to trade normally.

The following filters, I personally will NOT use as any pair can reverse at any time and become profitable:

1) Cut Loser Multiplier

2) Cut Biggest Loser when Margin is less than Alarming Margin Level

3) Stop Loss

Just my $0.02 on filters.

--- 帖子 #737 ---
My hurried typing and poor sentence structure.  Not meant to have a go at Roundrock at all - just happened that the thought of focused developement came into my head after mentioning him as the other coder that could do the work... sorry for that if you were offended. (And to you roundrock).

I know these guys can code I am not trying to offend them at all.  My point still holds, though change the words if you like....  could be changed for 'serious development work still required'.  Was not meant as an attack on anyone.

Reply to rest;

I am only suggesting filters that will not inhibit functionality - so your comments are in line with my thinking.

I accept that we need to fix a couple of issues with base EA - but a variation needs to be settled on.  All of these filters etc can be added with flags so they can be tested individually and combined after this.

i will leave off on development if you want to go slow.  Sorry if you think I am over imposing.  Not intentional at all.  Just trying to be constructive.

Moving on.

Tim

for the-game,

Concerning trading with the trend. I trade a phantom 6 concept manually on my Oanda account. This isnt the place to get into what I do but it follows the basic concepts of these EA's.

One filter I use is the 24 EMA on the hourly chart. After trading for a month I can tell you it works well to only take a trade that is on the correct side of that MA. Im not a coder so I couldnt figure how to add that to an EA so thats why I trade it manual. Now it works good for a 6 pair basket, but 3 pair or 1 pair it may limit the recovery trades if prices reverse I dont know. Maybe something to try. I had made a post about a month ago on this very subject in the phantom 6 thread but no one seemed to think it was a good idea.

But I know on the EA's Im testing now (mostly 6 pair baskets) the majority of the losing trades were taken on the wrong side of the trend. You guys testing, eye ball it yourself you will see what I mean.

--- 帖子 #739 ---
I'm trying the ADX indicator (yeah, yeah, I know I said I don't like indicators), but I'm using it a little different.

I'm just taking into account the +DI and the -DI lines on the H4 time frame.

Example:

EJ is a buy trade, so if +DI > -DI then allow the EA to trade EJ

EU is a sell trade, so if -DI > +DI then allow the EA to trade EU

UJ is a sell trade, so if -DI > +DI then allow the EA to trade UJ

So far it is working as I have expected, but time will have to tell.

EDIT: thorn, sorry, but I absolutely loathe MAs with a passion

--- 帖子 #740 ---
I made a new filter based on PipStep called PipStepStart.

Basically it won't allow a trade on any phantom in profit until the phantom is in X pips profit

Rough example:

EU phantom is in profit 1 pip, but my PipStepStart is 5 pips = NO TRADE

EU phantom is in profit 5 pips, and my PipStepStart is 5 pips = LET'S TRADE!

I made this filter because a pair would sometimes get into 1 pip profit when it was time to trade then reverse as soon as the trade was made.

But I'm thinking if used with my trend filter, it may restrict the EA from it's full potential.

--- 帖子 #741 ---
first of all thanks to all who are doing back/forward testing of this. there are known issues and bugs in this, i am going to work with Calliou to fix this. only after we fix these issues we will release this here

again appreciate everyones effort here

--- 帖子 #743 ---
My friend, I have to disagree this time, rmb the EA you made me few days ago? with the cut looser and time filter, I compare it with the pure Full, the result is so different, and if anyone think the Full is already so good, then you all will think the mod version the-game made is fantastic amazing. Please, the game, the cut looser is a big help, I dont say it because of some theory I made up with, I say it because I tried it. Now please, be kind again, please combine the Art_full_triming_cut_losser with the pip step in it. Then I will do further analysis. I will post everything in detail when i test them long enough, dont want to confuse anyone or make up theory, I only go for practical approach. trial and error.

the-game, can you kindly code it with the full version this time as you did it with the extreme version last time.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #744 ---
LP, do you have a statement to show me?

I want to analyse it first before committing any more time to your request.

Please include what Cut Loser Multiplier settings you had used.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #745 ---
yes sir, i'll do so when I get home. again, thanks for your help again.

sincerely,

LP

--- 帖子 #746 ---
LP, uh, don't worry about it, after reading what you wanted, it was an easy mod.

See attached. Go for GOLD!

TH = Trading Hours

CL = Cut Losers

PS = PipStep

--- 帖子 #747 ---
great, gona try that when i get home, btw, the setting is default, then multiplier is 3, 4 works too, reason i chose 3 because 2 was too tight, doesn't perform well. dont know why, but i'll go for what the result tells me to. again, trial and error, now i have 4 platform running, 2 months later, I will choose the best two, and compete with this one u just posted, and after another 2 months, i'll be able to pick the best, and then go live with 3000$ USD. for 3 months, better if i could test it for one full year, experience both the quiet and volatile or in other words, ranging and volatile market conditions.

best regards.

LP

--- 帖子 #748 ---
Hi LP,

I'm testing this Trade with Trend filter if successful (looking good so far), you probably won't need to use the Cut Losers Multiplier filter any more as it won't be trading against a pair's trend.

--- 帖子 #749 ---
I'm also trying this filter where I half the PP during Asian Session (AS).

Reasoning is because there is usually not much Price Action/Volume during the AS.

BUT there is still money to be made during the AS, especially during those rare times there is actually enough Price Action/Volume.

--- 帖子 #750 ---
the-game,

You're on the money for me. (Although not sure yet about pip step...) I agree with you.

Cutting out losers: .... sure its theory Low Profile - but that does not mean that it can't be fact.

The 'theory':

Why should taking out losing trades from the basket be any more effective on the net result than leaving them in... after all the EA is designed as it is since we are making the statement that we do not know the direction of the market and we will let the market decide which way it will go (weighted trade distribution). So why would you want to take out some of the trades just because they are losers at a given moment in time. Six hours later they may be the winning trades that get you to your pp.

Some trade sequences it will help - others it will casue them to take much longer to complete their equity pop. All it will do in the long run is cause a greater chance of a possible death trade DD on one of the trade sequences it destabilises because the market reverses back into the direction of the loosers you cut.

I can understand if you are desperate for margin - but then if it is that bad we should have killed of the trade, and reset for a better mmtu setting to suit the account size and broker side leverage.

i am sure we can see this theory demonstated on the single pair EA over a decent sample period if you wanted to try it.

Tim

PS Trader Joe please don't think I am coaching here - merely trying to be constructive in the development process.

--- 帖子 #751 ---
thanks Mallim - keep up posted!

--- 帖子 #752 ---
Tim, I agree with you, fully few days ago, today part of it. Because what I think and experienced is that during the huge dd brought by those big losers, the EA is still trading, which it react to the most recent trend according to "add to previous winner". so these new trades now help to reach pp, and experiment told that cutting big loser and add these new trade at same time tend to reach pp faster. and this is what makes the diff between the mod version and the pure version. I hope the worst situation come along soon, so I can see if this stand still. another reason I do not suggest to use 1 pair EA (beside backtesting) is that using few pairs, even one of them is not in good shape (raging, not going anywhere), the other pairs in the group may be well trended.

best regards.

LP

--- 帖子 #753 ---
Sure - i understand where you are coming from, but like I said sometimes the cutting of loser trades will help  -and your example displays this, but for the same reasons in reverse cutting losers (losers at that moment in time) will be very distructive to the sequence, and cause additional DD by going back in favor of the cut loser trades you just took out (an hour, 3 hours, 10 hours ago...).

It adds no net advantage to the EA to cut losers.

Can you see you are just discribing a single situation that suits your perspective.  Look at the trading concept as a whole.

I am not trying to be agressive or nonconforming here, so please don't be offended by my arguing your point of view.

Tim

--- 帖子 #755 ---
I'm absolutely agree with you, this could reduce DD significatively.

--- 帖子 #756 ---
hhh...

So EAs are working fine (Full and Light)... and for this credit goes to EU and GU. since these are falling from many days... and we have these two pairs in sell side. These are two positively correlated pairs.
But what if these two change direction?

So to come up with this issue I started ea with (EU UC and EC) today. Since EU and UC are negatively correlated, both will move in opposite direction.

Lets see the outcome.

For now, I think the Pipstep Filter (thank you Charvo for this) is the best one to test. What I suggest is to include this in Art_Phantom_Full from post 1 and to start a forward test for Art_Phantom_Full and Art_Phantom_Full_Pipstep.

For both start at the same time, same broker, same MMTU (0.4) same PP (1.0) and compare results.

We have to decide the number of pips for Pipstep mod.

What do you think?

Thank you The-Game

Why do you think that if you could program you would do better than coders who are in this thread?

My "Spaniard" father taught me that with HUMILITY and work we can achieve everything and I think he is right.

--- 帖子 #772 ---
Thank you The-Game, I know, but I´m a bit busy with so many tests, my full time job,......

Maybe we have to decide first with wich mod we want to compare Art_Phantom_Full. I think PipStep might reduce DD but it might reduce gain too because sometimes we will need a bigger movement to reach the profit (less trades will be taken in one direction).

What I suggest is to make today 30/11 a list for the modifications we want to try and decide among all wich modifications we are going to test.

Then we can decide a day, an hour, a MMTU, a PP, and different traders with different brokers and different leverage to start the comparison.

--- 帖子 #773 ---
My suggestion:

1.- PipStep: it can reduce DD (but gain too) but it will let the EA the possibility of recover without interfering with its operation. We have to decide (if we finally decide to test this mod) how many pips for PipStep.

Very good comparative Tazmaan.

According to your results, in my opinion the winner is Full Version (Pure, without PipStep mod). Of course with Pipstep (maybe 20 is a bit high) DD is much less but gain too.

Thank you

Thanks, will test it.

--- 帖子 #792 ---
yeah, suprisingly light is catching up this week, kinda came out of nowhere to close the gap it seems lol.

I am giving the pipstep version more time, as it did start late, so we'll see over the next week or so if there's something there.  the dd is definitely reduced as you can see.

I never checked the coding to see if it was setup correctly to work with both 4 and 5 digit brokers without adding the 0, but in my case, I have it set to '20' on a 5 digit broker

hi G, no there is live acct running i just u suppose delete your account info from the jpeg.

so do i need to attach the EA with only one pair example GBPJPY 1hTF, and not all the pairs mentioned in the first thread.

please explain

thanks

sami

--- 帖子 #806 ---
Sam, you have 3 different charts that I can see in your screenshot, and all 3 of them have the ea on them.  You should only be running the ea once.  If you want to test a bunch of different variations, you need to setup a separate mt4 installation for each one.

This also explains why you have 3 trades opening at the same time in your open trade screen.

And I agree, you really should not be running this ea live, especially if you aren't understanding the above :/

--- 帖子 #807 ---
hello everyone, first point no honestly its not running on live account, i think thats asking for trouble, its a demo account i just delete the account number from it thats (no reason) and thank u Taz i think understand now u must run the EA only on one pair.. please please correct if its the case.

charvo made his mod so that if you enter 10 for PipStep, it will convert it to 100 for 3 digit or 5 digit brokers, otherwise it leaves the PipStep value as-is.

--- 帖子 #817 ---
it's all relative, you are using 0.1 lots because of your ~100k account, whereas I am using 0.02 lots, because of my ~1k account.

I wouldn't worry about the dollar value, only the pip value (right-click on profit column and select Profit -> Points.

--- 帖子 #818 ---
I think my trend filter is working as intended, my EA only traded EU and UJ sells and all trades closed for a profit.

It did not trade EJ as it is a buy and it's current trend is short.

I'm not saying that all trades will ALWAYS close for a profit all the time, but a majority of them should close for a profit.

This is because it might add another trade just before the trade sequence closes

or

Trades were added early in the trade sequence, but then the short term trend for those early trades has momentarily reversed because the other pair was stronger.

Hi thegame

What trend filter are you currently using? Has it been posted here already?

Would you mind sharing for testing?

Thanks a lot

--- 帖子 #820 ---
I won't share until I know it is working as intended for more than just one day.

Phantom3_suv ( lighter version ) :

The EA placed trades 14.00 hrs, 15.00hrs, 16.00 hrs and then did not place trades. Finally it placed two trades euro/usd sell at 2.00 hrs. There was no trade for 10 hrs and then at the same time places two trades.

Is this normal ? Calliou and others pl reply. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #822 ---
Not at all... constructive criticism is a good thing

--- 帖子 #823 ---
Sounds great.

--- 帖子 #824 ---
ok noted thanks.

I just got home.. (bet you can't tell by my rash of sudden messages )

I'll be posting which ea's i'll be testing in a few minutes and what you might filll that slot with if you haven't already

TJ

--- 帖子 #825 ---
Wonderful! thank you.

--- 帖子 #826 ---
Good report tazmaan! We need more of these kinds of reports.

--- 帖子 #827 ---
Awesome ! thegame!

--- 帖子 #828 ---
Everyone is doing a great job reporting their ea testing but I would like to suggest that even though it may seem a little silly we redundantly add the ea name, settings, leverage on account and any other information pertinent to that parcular ea.  This would be really helpful for us who are trying to keep track of most of it

TJ

--- 帖子 #829 ---
I'm thinking pipstep should be tested between 10 to 15 area.  I don't see any reason we can't start the testing using thegame's recent Art_Phantom_Full_TH_CL_PS ea uploaded in post #756 do you?

let me know asap so I can get it started.

TJ

I think this ea has inbuilt loss cutter function... I applied it to EA and and results are not good because of this extra function..

Ea is struggling to reach break even also...

It will be much better to use basic ea strategy for single pairs.

Let first test basic strategy then it will be fine to add other functions like loss cutter etc.

Regards

24hrs

--- 帖子 #834 ---
No, if the EA places 2 trades for same pair at the same time is not normal, strange. Something similar happens to me and you before, all works perfect and then something strange happens.

Maybe a coder could check the code of EA's in post 1?

Thank you

--- 帖子 #835 ---
Thanks for the feedback...

--- 帖子 #836 ---
Of course TJ, thank you

--- 帖子 #837 ---
Has anyone done a backtest for Single_Pair_Phantom (last version) from Roundrock?

My VPS is very slow. I think it could be extremely interesting.....

--- 帖子 #838 ---
I might be able to do it tomorrow, on 99% tickdata.

Just need to know what settings you'd like tested, and on what pair, so i can prep for it.

--- 帖子 #839 ---
Thank you very much Tazmaan

I think EUR/USD, M30, MMTU: 0.4 and PP: 1.0 (no use of any filter) could be good settings to compare with Art_Phantom_Full.....

--- 帖子 #840 ---
Actually, I just tried to backtest on EU 1hr (since I already had tickdata prepped for that timeframe) using defaults.  It appears the ea has some issues that need worked out still.  Anyone else have any issues backtesting it?

Appears maybe pp closure isn't working right.  Can provide logs and screenshots if roundrock needs

--- 帖子 #841 ---
Thanks... appreciate that

--- 帖子 #842 ---
In my forwardtest trades are opened correctly but I don't know if closures are correct because my first basket has not closed yet....

--- 帖子 #843 ---
I"m currently running it on my 99 tester. There seems to be some kind of problem. It begins by opening about 20 trades (buys) and then closes one for profit then just seems to get stuck there and then suddenly completes the whole test in big splat so to speak.

I'll have to study it a little more before I can give a good report but I can say for pretty sure there's something wrong with the ea.

TJ

EDIT:

It's not closing trades till the margin runs out I think. That's why there is no activity till the it finally ends and suddenly closes all the trades on 'Close at stop".

--- 帖子 #844 ---
20 trades at the same time? For me it opens trades correctly, strange. Anyone else is testing this version to compare?

--- 帖子 #845 ---
I think what's happening is that it's not closing the trades when it is supposed to and continuing to open trades as if the earlier trades closed. There is some kind of closure problem with the ea. I'm sure its no big deal and just an oversight RoundRock will catch right away.

Looking more closely, it's not opening 20 trades at once.  (just looked like it at first because of how fast the backtester works  )

TJ

--- 帖子 #846 ---
Latest basket, started on Monday with AFF, just hit 10% dd

Thank you,

Reduce the DD is what we are talking about here since the thread is started...

What are your settings ? (MMTU and PP)

--- 帖子 #854 ---
Try light version...

--- 帖子 #855 ---
Please someone demotest following pairs for this ea (Full and Light versions). I am testing since yesterday buy having some problem in EA. Its not opening pairs correctly.

--- 帖子 #856 ---
Ok,

I will test light version

thanks

Hmmm... be intersting to see if and how it recovers...

--- 帖子 #859 ---
hhh.. it will take some time may be 10,20+ hrs

--- 帖子 #860 ---
Yes, the most important for this EA is its recovery potential, let´s see.....

--- 帖子 #861 ---
Here it is.. So far one closure since yesterday.

I have trimmed the code to remove unused pairs. Hope it works ok.

--- 帖子 #862 ---
Basket still open since yesterday, with -$730 floating. Look forward for a good bounce soon.

Yes, it´s now when it has to show what it is capable to do.....

--- 帖子 #864 ---
Will be interesting to see...

--- 帖子 #865 ---
Thanx very much.. I will try it now.

Actually I have modified basic ea for above pairs but there may be some problem.

As far as results are concern it should close atleast 3-4 baskets in a day. But lets check it again..

--- 帖子 #869 ---
The art_phantom_full : A basket still has 16 open trades and with a max DD of 10.82 %. Yet to get closed. Have to watch out what will happen. Quite interesting b'cos i was waiting for this kind of situation and see how the EA recovers from such a DD. Lowest margin 956 %. on a 200:1 leverage a/c with MMTU 0.5 and Profit 1.0 setting.

--- 帖子 #870 ---
Hello guys,

I'm testing the Single Pair Phantom and so far in profict. I noticed the stoploss option which by the way is great. It controls the losses much better. However, it will be great if the similar option can be added "take profit in pips or $. I'm currently trading with a low balance and is difficult for me to see a fast positive return. My demo currently shows a profit of $15.00+- trading at 0.01 only for two pairs, but I don't know when it will close. This profit might soon go into a loss. Your help is greatly appreciated. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #871 ---
Thank you Navk for sharing your results

I have just change my Art_Phantom_Full test by Art_Phantom_Full_TH_CL_PS with MMTU: 0.4, PP:1.0 and PipStep: 10 (no Limit Time and not Cut Loss)

One hour ago my APF closes 16 trades, DD: -4.12% and closes with only +0.6% because during closures market moves against my position.

I think with 10 PipStep we could avoid so much trades taken with only 2 or 3 pips profit, DD will be reduced and I hope Gain not get too low.

I will inform you about this.

--- 帖子 #872 ---
I too now have changed 'trading hours" false for this EA like yours, let us see.

--- 帖子 #873 ---
Please excuse if this has been asnwered before but I cannot seem to find it on this particular thread. In settings what are:

Bailout (currently "false") is this an  emergency close all open trades feature?

StopAfterNoTrades (currently "false")?

UserTradingAllowed (currently "true")?

TIA

--- 帖子 #874 ---
pl use this EA to forward/back test. it has options to set stoploss, set trading hours, show comments in the screen.

by default they are set to false, false, true.

for backtesting change show comments to false to speed up the testing, otherwise it will be slow

if you are using stoploss, then make sure the pips digit issue is handled properly (100 = 100 pips or 10 pips ?)

--- 帖子 #875 ---
Hello guys,

Is it possible to add the option to set the take profit in pips instead percentage?. I'm trading with a $500.00 balance on a 1:200 and is difficult for me to determine the right profit percentage. I think by adding this option will allow us to control and/or see faster profits. I had to pairs on profits early today by like $15.00 at 0.01 and already when into loss. I don't see how I can make this EA go to the positive side, no matter what profit percentage and/or what max margin to use. Please help. Thank you in advance.

--- 帖子 #876 ---
Is this the same you posted in your earlier post.799 ? Thanks.

I uploaded the your EA in post 799 and running.

--- 帖子 #877 ---
Another baskt closed. Equity 5091 $. Max DD 0.58 %.

--- 帖子 #878 ---
This one does work roundrock, thanks

--- 帖子 #879 ---
This one appears to be working.

--- 帖子 #880 ---
DD now over 17%

--- 帖子 #881 ---
since the ea's being tested are changing all the time please post which ea and set on each report to help clear up some confusion

--- 帖子 #882 ---
The one thing I notice on this single pair ea, is that it is opening both buy and sell in the same cycle.  Now, I have not noticed this happening in all of my testing on the multipair ea's so far, so I am not sure if it is to be allowed or not.

IMO, it should only be able to open 1 direction while previous trades are still open.

--- 帖子 #883 ---
Thanks again Roundrock, will try inmediately...

--- 帖子 #886 ---
Amazing....

--- 帖子 #887 ---
This DD is absolutely unacceptable for going live in my opinion so I recommend you to try Art_Phantom_Full_TH_CL_PS with Pipstep: 10-20 pips, DD will be less.......

--- 帖子 #888 ---
MMTU __ PP __  ?

tks

Roberto

--- 帖子 #889 ---
The pip step filter helps the basic version, it looks to me. But we need test for more days. As long as the max DD is not more than 6 to 8 % one should be happy.

--- 帖子 #890 ---
MMTU 0.5; Profit 1.0; Pip step 10; Trading hours and cutlooser : False.

--- 帖子 #891 ---
Does that mean take the current art_phantom_full off the chart/trades and apply Art_Phantom_Full_TH_CL_PS which should take them over (with same magic number of course)?

--- 帖子 #892 ---
thanks.

BTW, please read post 893

--- 帖子 #893 ---
I have already done that, remove APF and load APFTHCLPS, when a basket has just closed of course....

--- 帖子 #894 ---
Single Pair Phantom

I'm having some trouble getting this ea to complete a pass in the tester.  I'll work on it more tonight when I get home to see if it can complete with some kind of setting/timeframe.

TJ

--- 帖子 #895 ---
Mine went fine with latest version, on h1 eu

--- 帖子 #896 ---
what lot size trades was your demo opening?

--- 帖子 #897 ---
What seems to be happening on my particular basket (now 20 open trades) is that:

EURUSD falls, EA opens sell trades

EURUSD reverses, EA opens EURJPY buy trades

EURUSD/EURUSD reverse again, EA repeats getting itself deeper and deeper into DD.

Unless a breakout and clear trend happens soon its only a matter of time until this whipsawing wipes the account

This is probably known as the death trade mentioned here and there on this thread

--- 帖子 #898 ---
Me too, I think closure is not correct, let´s see forwardtest.....

--- 帖子 #899 ---
In my demo a/c i tried this single pair EA, but even after reaching the target, it was not closing...

Now i loaded the new single pair EA which has pipstep, stop loss options.

Hey guys

I have finally got my art_phantom full EA to work a few days ago, however yesterday it opened a basket and made its 1% but since hasn't opened any further trades, is this normal.

Ive attached the statement

The Ea traded very well, but has gone to sleep and wont wake up

--- 帖子 #901 ---
Important are open trades, not closed trades. Could you provide us settings and currently open trades?

Thank you

--- 帖子 #902 ---
Ok np

I currently have no open trades (nothing opened since the last profitable session closed)

I am using FXCM with a 100000 demo account

My settings are

--- 帖子 #903 ---
I think the problem must be your broker and minimum increase: it must be 0,01 to trade always due to MMTU setting.

--- 帖子 #904 ---
How do I set minimum increase?

--- 帖子 #905 ---
It depends on your broker, ask him or move to another broker........

--- 帖子 #906 ---
I think this was addressed when the lotstep code was added.  Not sure if its in these art versions though.

--- 帖子 #907 ---
Ok thanks for the advice, Im going to try Alpari US...have people had success with these?

--- 帖子 #908 ---
I'm with Alpari UK, any problem for now....

--- 帖子 #909 ---
Ok thanks for all your help

Ive set it up on alpari US

I do just keep this running 24/7 is that right

--- 帖子 #910 ---
It depends, in my opinion I would avoid weekend gaps but each person is different.....

--- 帖子 #911 ---
----

Culling the lossers every 2 hours and then allow to fill-in the closed pair with a winning/ trending pair would be a good idea. Alternative pair must be identified, say if we have an 8 pairs, we only run 6 pairs in one time. We can also close winning pairs that is losing momentum to improve our equity and keep the basket filled. I am not sure though if the basket will allow it as I am new and learning the concept. Also if our Total_DD_Max execeed 3% (or ??%) exit our trade.

Edd

Thanks,

Edd

--- 帖子 #912 ---
Again, it's all relative, you are using  MMTU and PP settings that were made for an account of at least $3000.

I know I use the same account starting capital and settings, but I am testing for the worst case.

--- 帖子 #913 ---
Looks like my trend filter was too slow as it kept adding trades to EU and UJ while their trend went LONG.

It also detected the EJ trend too slow, only adding trades near the end of the rally, hence not catching the biggest move for EJ.

I'm going to try something else now.

--- 帖子 #914 ---
and the beat goes on .... dada da da da....

--- 帖子 #915 ---
I'm posting this Backtest (what I could get of one) of the lastest Single_Pair_Phantom(fix2) ea.

I'm hoping it might help RoundRock determine if it is working correctly and if not where the problem might be.  I simply can't get it to run through the tester all the way through.

TJ

--- 帖子 #916 ---
market will be range bound due to jobs data tomorrow. so be careful

--- 帖子 #917 ---
PipStep will come in handy.

--- 帖子 #918 ---
Yap...

That is correct.

For greater success of this ea these pairs should be replaced with highly -ly correlated pairs ie EU and UC. I have done that and demo testing from today.

Earlier I was trying for the same but not successful with ea. U can search that EA in previous post.

Regards,

24hrs.

--- 帖子 #919 ---
Well AP full DD increase to -27%

Little serious.

--- 帖子 #920 ---
Absolutely agree. The most difficult week to trade always with NFP on Friday. If a trader or EA survives this, we have a good trader or a good EA......

--- 帖子 #921 ---
Here's the backtest you wanted.

Do with what you will

As a note of interest, the h1 same settings made a little more profit, without the massive dd that almost busted the account (and probably would have in real trading).

--- 帖子 #922 ---
Thank you very much Tazmaan.

Yes, Art_Phantom_Full without any filter could produce a very serious DD.

For now I'm between Art_Phantom_Light and Art_Phantom_Full_TH_CL_PS with 10 PipStep.

So with this Single Pair Phantom version closures were correct?

--- 帖子 #923 ---
They seem to be, assuming the fact that it hedges (trades both directions on same pair) is correct.

I'd be curious to see what affect a pipstep input in this single pair version would do, maybe roundrock could add it in.  If not, I'll look at adding it in myself tomorrow maybe.

Sleep time for me

--- 帖子 #924 ---
My Single Pair Phantom EA in forwardtest didn´t work well. Since yesterday afternoon it only opened a Sell trade, and it would be opened some Buys trades.......

So I´m not sure that it works properly.

Finally, Art_Phantom_Full recovers and closed 23 trades with +1.91% (during closing, market moves in our direction). But I still think the PipStep mod is a must.

--- 帖子 #925 ---
Managed to close the basket BUT.... the profit down to $302. Don't know why...may be delay (or not responding) in closing the open trades? Anyway, better less $100 than less $700

After the basket close, new basket still open with -$600 floating.

Phantom_Full

Starting $10,000.

Leverage 100:1.

MMTU 1.6

PP 0.4

Profit $302.

DD -7.5%

--- 帖子 #926 ---
How many open trades did you have ? The more trades open, the more risk to close with a % different that your PP.....

--- 帖子 #927 ---
I suggest post the latest PS, or CL, etc version on front page for easy access. Now I'll use the attachment window to get the file with latest date.

--- 帖子 #928 ---
Yes, now 24 open trades since Monday and over 18% DD wwith no end in sight, only digging itself deeper and deeper into the $h1t

--- 帖子 #929 ---
Untill we define the best version, I think it is better to let post 1 like it is now, otherwise this page would be full of versions......

For now, in my opinion, maybe Light Version would be my choice to go live but it is too early yet....  the higher the TF, the less noise.....

--- 帖子 #930 ---
I saw the tester report and discover one thing.

The EA has to close the winner trades first, and then the losers.

At this time the EA close the trades randomly.(the first trade will be the first closed trade...)

Is it correct? Or am I an idiot?  (this is not so important?)

--- 帖子 #931 ---
yes, thats a good point, we should close winners first and then losers. right now it closes the order in which they are created.

closing orders is a pain and in backtest it takes time. we can close by position or by ticket number. if you use position, then you close 1, the position of rest changes and next order position may not be same as what you are expecting.

i am using ticket number to close.

--- 帖子 #932 ---
can you check the Phantom Start Price in the screen ? if the price goes above this, buy should be placed provided all its prev buys are in profit

today my SPP closed one pop.

--- 帖子 #933 ---
Art_phantom_full_TH_CL_PS :

Three baskets got closed since yesterday. Present balance : 5271 $ up by 5.4 % since 30/11 ( 2 days.), Max DD : 2.91 %.

Does somebody know how to add a "max floating profit" in the screen.

I would like it to reset after an equity pop.

--- 帖子 #935 ---
Art_phantom_full_TH_CL_PS :

Another one closed. 5315 $.

--- 帖子 #936 ---
Hit the key board button F3, delete all variables, then go to experts, properties and change Profit factor.

--- 帖子 #937 ---
No, thats not what I mean.

In the EA's, you can see the "max. floating drawdown" (Since the EA is attached) I would like someting simular, but for the max floating profit in a session (from eauity pop till equity pop) For visual reference. It may help finding an optimal PP. (only when it is set to high)

--- 帖子 #938 ---
Glad to see that others are having several porifitable closures

sadly mine is still on 24 open trades an MaxDD now at 18.6%

Art_phantom_full

--- 帖子 #939 ---
Art_phantom_full:

Mine also still running with a max DD of 13.56 % and 22 open trades. If i go live, i will not go with this version as we all seen the max DD reaching up to 18 % and no guarantee that it will get closed.

I suggest you try the new version : Art_phantom_full_TH_CL_PS. It has pip step option and that helps the EA to place trades in right direction.

--- 帖子 #940 ---
Thanks Navk, will certainly do that as soon, or if, this basket closes as I am on a live account

--- 帖子 #941 ---
one more pop on my SPP

MMTU 0.2, leverage 200:1, PP 0.5  10k standard account

--- 帖子 #942 ---
i added that code in my phantom addsix series. it doesnt help much exept you know it went into profit before going down and resulting in big DD

--- 帖子 #943 ---
Art_phantom_full_TH_CL_PS :

Another one closed. 5368 $.

--- 帖子 #944 ---
I will test again...

--- 帖子 #945 ---
It was around 20 open trades....(1 day of floating). Can consider this as isolated or random luck.

I have exactly the same EA, same settings except MMTU: 0.4 (no big difference). Mine now max DD: -6,07%, floating P/L: -451,02.-$ (10.000.-$ demo account), waiting for its recovery....

--- 帖子 #947 ---
Euro/usd is a sell pair, euro/jpy is a "buy", usd/jpy is a sell pair. ThIS EA has been placing only euro/jpy and usd/jpy and closing fast for me.

--- 帖子 #948 ---
Yes, start time for loading EA is important for first closure.....

Hello,

great work,thanks all friends who are so helpfull to improve this EA, however I am not the expert on so many codes and I need really some understable language and helps here. I following this thread since one week and read all posts. So I am many confused of many coders to improve several versions on the EA which are changed since the first post. Even the EA becomes another profile for one pair, but I prefer the three pair option, however now I am considering to follow the 'ART_PHANTOM_FULL_TH_CL_PS'  more like the Light version. My problem is :

I used this version on a 5 digit platfom. My original platform is with 4 digits. The matter is my broker not allows me to use an EA, so I try to watch the entries on 5 digit and used them on my real account on with 4 digits. However as I am not confidence how that will be effecting, I am not trading it in real in the moment. The other problem is my real account Metadrader allows in minimum 0.1 lot trading. Thats a hug different with the demo 5 digit platform as this one allows 0.01 micro lots. I would like to understand if I find a 4 digit platform for demo, will this EA react like the same like it does now. Where I need to change the specifications of lots . In the 5 digit platform it opens now 0.02 lot entries, but inside the preferences Lots is 0.1. Use Smallest lots is false. Why if my demo acccount is 5.000 USD, it presents me LAST FLAT BALANCE of 10.000 USD. The other thing is on the demo account the leverage is 100:1 but on the chart it is written 50:1 leverage, a confused point.

Sorry, I am not in such experience like many people here in this thread, but I want to use this EA on my Original platform with settings below:

100:1 leverage

0.1 minimum lot entry

Balance of 5000 USD

4 digit platform

MMTU is that appliying for a stop loss, or for the entry sizes of lots? How that  counts as well.

I can find a 4 digit demo platform, but I need to understand firstly this basic explanations.

Sorry for my less knowledge..

--- 帖子 #950 ---
DD now @ 19.2% and rising

--- 帖子 #951 ---
Hello Freedom48,

MMTU is for entry lots sizes, according to type of account, balance and leverage.

If I remember well for a standard account the formula is: Lot Size = Balance * (MMTU/100)*(Leverage/100.000).

Just make sure min increase for your broker is 0.01, because if balance increase, Lot size will increase....

Try on your demo account differents MMTU and see Lot size....

--- 帖子 #952 ---
Hi Dambuster, I´m really sorry, since it´s your live account.

Maybe it will recover but if I were you, I will try to help the EA.

I´m not absolutely convinced of this strategy but with a -19,20% DD, I think you have to do something.

What I suggest is to apply a cut looser strategy, for example you can close manually each trade with a loss = 2 * Profit Target.

I have no tested that but I know that someone on the other thread is doing that with good results. Finally EA will close all basket with the same Equity Profit Target so the loss is only temporary.

Please if you do that could you share how is it going ? It could be a very good test.......

Thank you and I think this could help.

[quote=navk;4216386]Art_phantom_full:

Mine also still running with a max DD of 13.56 % and 22 open trades. If i go live, i will not go with this version as we all seen the max DD reaching up to 18 % and no guarantee that it will get closed.

Art_phantom_full:

DD - 17.5 %, 22 Open trades.

--- 帖子 #956 ---
If possible change broker and change account type.

It will be very risky to trade with 0.1 lot size on live account with less balance.

--- 帖子 #957 ---
About Cut Loss mod, my first opinion was not very positive, but after reading post 262 from Frazerd in "Phantom 6 System" thread, I think a bit different.

I recommend you to read that, make much sense to me the last paragraph.

--- 帖子 #958 ---
hello you see my report,

all version profit system-

i like this-

best regards

vienna

--- 帖子 #959 ---
can someone explain the edge with this system ? you are taking a random start price and buy if it goes up and sell if it goes down. but if the market goes up and down in a range that keeps expanding to a point that your account blows out.

how can you avoid the big DD and the death trade.

with more pairs, chances of one pair getting into a good trend and hence help us reach the PP are more. with one pair, that chance is less plus the ideosynchrocies of that pair plays a major role.

--- 帖子 #960 ---
Hi vienna,

Are you running all separately or some together with same magic number?

thanks

--- 帖子 #961 ---
i was a silent viewer and tester for this thread, but i think that this is the time to participate and share my results! I would like to thank everyone who has contributed in creating this EA specially Caillou!

I am using the full version in the 1st post on my live trading account. Leverage is 1:100.

I set the lot size to constant 0.01 , MMTU=0.2 , and PP=0.1%

0.1% on my 2000$ account yields a PP of 2$ which means 20 pips. I have started the EA on 23rd of November and just closed the last basket today. A total of 470 pips were made during this period. I know that it is not alot of money by using 0.01 lot size , but still it is profitable , and no worries about the DD since the lot size is small. i have had 2 big DD during the test period and the maximum was 550 pips.

Thank you all, Keep it up!

--- 帖子 #962 ---
Hi Poltroni,

Thank you.

Did your EA recover from those big DD without any mod?

--- 帖子 #963 ---
Now we are testing this,  the edge of 3 pairs and 1 pair version. Normally if the market is range, all pairs will range so the problem is not solve with more pairs in my opinion......

--- 帖子 #964 ---
Yes Caillou. I have not done anything or closed any trades which are in loss. Usually i try to close the EA if there are no open baskets at 7:00 PM europe and start it again next morning. but if it is in DD , then i just leave it to recover by it self

--- 帖子 #965 ---
Art_phantom_full_TH_CL_PS :

Another one closed. 5489 $.

Sorry guys, only i am making profits today.

--- 帖子 #966 ---
Yes, I think you are the only one. Congratulations !!!!

--- 帖子 #967 ---
Hi Vienna,

what are the settings you used in the Complete Version for A,B,C,D and how long was it traded, I not saw the trade history just on this chart only the profit. You used a demo platform 4 digits with micro lots of 0.01. Is the complete version Light or full

--- 帖子 #968 ---
Art_phantom_full_TH_CL_PS :

Another one closed, 5544 $.

Totally seven baskets closed and overall profit today : 393 $

--- 帖子 #969 ---
How many closures today Navk ? (still 10 Pipstep?)

--- 帖子 #970 ---
yes, 10 pip step and all other setting false.

What i noticed is it has been placing trades in the direction of trend ( TODAY ). Adding a trend filter should help this EA in my opinion. Like the ones super trend or trend magic inputs to this EA.

Note : Pip step may not be necessary if we add trend filter. If you see other threads you can get trend magic inputs. Unfortunately i am not a coder to modify.

--- 帖子 #971 ---
Yes, maybe, so many things to test.....

--- 帖子 #972 ---
I think The-Game has done something similar and he was not absolutely satisfied....

--- 帖子 #973 ---
Hello Caillou, I have to disagree with you this time. It is the fact that every pair is correlated, but they have pretty significant difference in terms of movements when they fall out of the correlation range at times.

On the other hand, I have been observing your myfxbook account, I see you change account name/EAs frequently. My humble opinion, maybe try each one for at least months before making decision or adjustments? that way will have sophisticated evidence to show either they work or dont work.

Thanks

LP

--- 帖子 #974 ---
My full version is nowhere near in trouble either, sitting at -1.5% dd right now, and still has never peaked past 8%.

--- 帖子 #975 ---
Hi LP,

Yes, you are right, I have changed a lot from one version to another, very frequently. I know that with a few days it's not enough time to know if an EA will work but for me, sometimes I only need 1 day to know if I don't like a version. To know if I really like a version is totally different, I need a lot of time.

That's why I try one version, I find a mod that I think it could improve this EA then I rejected the first one, and try the new one, and more, and more and more....

Sure I'm wrong but if I don' t like now for example Art_Phantom_Full without Pipstep mod, I think it's a waste of time to spend months with it. But as I said if I like Art_Phantom_Full_TH_CL_PS I will try for months.....I reject what I don't like quickly, I try what I like slowly.....

Just my opinion.

--- 帖子 #976 ---
A DD < 8% is really comfortable.....

--- 帖子 #977 ---
I agree, as soon as it goes over 20% or so, usually ends up in the trash for me.

(unless its putting out 10% per day or so

--- 帖子 #978 ---
What leverage are your accounts using?

--- 帖子 #979 ---
PipStep should be at least 15 or 20 so that you don't accumulate too many pos at a ranging level.

PP set at 1 is too high.

these 2 factors combined, you have a ”lethal weapon“

your LIVE trading should be more conservative.

now that u r in 20% DD, you might try these two:

1. delete the biggest loser, one by one, so that you have all opened positions in hedge. for example: you have 4 pairs with opened position:

LONG: 5gu, 3ej; SHORT 3gj, 4eu;

so you close 2 gu losers, and 1 eu loser (well, eu might not be loser, but in order to form a hedged basket, you might have to just close 1 ej), then you will have:

Long 3gu(you cut 2), 3ej; and Short 3gj, 3eu(you cut 1)

now, this 3:3:3:3, is a good hedge, your DD will be fixed at this level mostly.

2. adjust your EA's PP to some 0.01 or 0.02, anyway, very small value, so that when market moves, your EA will take out your positions faster, hopefully.

This is my advice, but you take your own risk.  good luck.  however, Low PP, and some PipStep value are safeguards to your capital, don't loose them in future.

Testing all on 300:1, 1k balance

--- 帖子 #981 ---
OK; thanks.

--- 帖子 #982 ---
I agree too now, I'm trying x4 multiplier, although I think x3 is optimal.

--- 帖子 #983 ---
Phantom_Full still floating at the moment. I will switch to Phantom_Full_TH_CL_PS if Phantom_Full reaches DD of >15% (now still below 10%). It is up to the EA to save itself from being replaced

--- 帖子 #984 ---
i added pipstep logic to it, this mod is not working at all. its taking too many trades to close. with one pair, we need some momentum (in terms of number of pairs, number of lots, number of pips) to help us reach PP. With pipstep number trades is reduced but also profitabality. i havent measured how much improvement it made in terms of DD

with 3 pairs, it may be a different story

without pipstep, withput stoploss, without trading hours filter this EA gave 26 pops in last 15 days. with 200:1, MMTU 0.2, PP 0.5 H1. but if i run this from jan 2010, results are scary especially at begining. it almost hit 0 balance in feb-mar

--- 帖子 #985 ---
yep, already makes a difference.  that last report I sent showing like 90% dd, a simple pipstep addition of 15 on that same run, decreased the dd to 50% with same profit.

Will play with it some more, even though I see no benefit at all to running a single pair version

--- 帖子 #986 ---
I have applied your latest version (not pip step) and I am completely surprised.

Starting balance: $500

Profit: $60

Time frame: 15min

Lot size: 0.01 PP: 1% MMTU: 50%

Duration: Less than 24hrs

--- 帖子 #987 ---
What's your max floating dd% and your lowest margin %?

--- 帖子 #988 ---
Serious Request:

Those who are testing 3 basic and other pipstep version of this EA are also requested to test following versions from next week. I have started testing following version simultaneously with Art phantom and getting some surprising results. But I doubt consistency of these EAs.

Art Phantom Light (4 pairs):  (Sell EU, UC and Buy GC, EG)

Starting balance: $500 (1:100 Margin)

Profit: $25

Time frame: Light version (1Hr)

Lot size: 0.01 PP: 1% MMTU: 50%

Drawdown: -$18

Duration: 3 days+

Comment: Very steady, less trades, almost negligible drawdown

Art Phantom Light (EUC):  (Sell EU, UC and Buy EC)

Starting balance: $500 (1:100 Margin)

Profit: $47

Time frame: Light version (1Hr)

Lot size: 0.01 PP: 1% MMTU: 50%

Drawdown: -$10

Duration: Less than 24 hrs

Comment: Same Ea as basic EA but different pairs. I really doubt about its consistency becuuse...

Total profit of Basic light version for 4days = Its 1 day profit

Art Phantom (Single Pair):  (Sell EU Buy EU)

Starting balance: $500 (1:100 Margin)

Profit: $60

Time frame: 15 min

Lot size: 0.01 PP: 1% MMTU: 50%

Drawdown: -$8

Duration: Less than 24 hrs

Comment: It really shocked me. I cant express more. Just test yourself.

PS I haven't used pipstep strategy till now. I would like to test basic strategy for at-least one month.

Those who will test this ea please post your results in RED color so it will be easy to identify.

I have attached all these version in this thread, Just check out.

Regards,

24hrs.

Very interesting results, we have to test more....

Thank you 24hrs

hello,

Take your time and look at the report-

i dont have any confidence in mt4 backtesting. atleast my data.

i run exact same test 2 times and i get different results both times. i dont know why ?

also when you start yr EA has great significance on profitabality. start price has a major role. same with all other phantom EAs

may be TraderJoe can test this and report the results with diff combinations. before we take a final call on it. with trading hours, with SL, with pipstep....

--- 帖子 #997 ---
My testing is all done on 99% dukascopy tickdata.

Granted, backtesting is still backtesting....but at least I don't waste time with shitty metaquotes incomplete data

--- 帖子 #998 ---
Hi roundrock.

One of the reasons for inconsistencies with backtesting is that each backtest takes the current demo spread at the time that it starts. Therefore if you have fluctuations in spread, especially when the spread increases on some accounts just prior to market close (e.g. over the weekend), this can affect backtesting results.

Cheers,

swnke2.

--- 帖子 #999 ---
Thank you Vienna, I will check that slowly.....

--- 帖子 #1000 ---
Absolutely agree....

--- 帖子 #1001 ---
hello,

my accounts are active around the clock,

I test slowly, so I report on Friday.

I will start from january money with real-

until then I test and it will show which variant has a safe ea.

--- 帖子 #1002 ---
With wich version do you feel more comfortable Vienna?

--- 帖子 #1003 ---
hello,

I tend EURUSD at the single-variant

I've got three different types of it -

were posted as they -

the first variant without the chart display is very well-

I will see what is really better-

best regards

vienna

--- 帖子 #1004 ---
HELLO Caillou,

has anyone ever tried this variant with an ea?

buy - eurusd

buy - eurcad

sell -  cadusd

Did I miss something?

I would try ea if there is one.

best regards

vienna

--- 帖子 #1005 ---
Of course you can, but if you want to be hedged, you must Buy EUR/USD, Sell EUR/CAD, Sell CAD/USD.....

--- 帖子 #1006 ---
thank you

I've tried to program this, but I'm really lost -

Unfortunately I can not ...

Bad luck ...

Hello guys,

I'm currently testing the single pair phantom. It is currently up about $24.00 and this is only trading 0.01 lots with a $500.00 balance. I have the dollar profit target set at $2.62(shows on the screen). However it already passed that amount by a lot, but it does not close. Can anyone tell me what I maybe doing wrong. Thank you in advance.

--- 帖子 #1010 ---
are you running any other EA also on same account ?  pl copy the messages from Experts tab. that gives some clue

--- 帖子 #1011 ---
DD now at a painfull 26.05%

--- 帖子 #1012 ---
jobs data didnt help the EA

--- 帖子 #1013 ---
Hello Roundrock,

No, I'm only running this EA, but in two pairs EU/US AND GBP/US.

--- 帖子 #1014 ---
art_phantom_full:

It reached 26.5 % DD. I am manually closing all trades.

Phantom3_suv: Present DD at 5.2 % Want to see if it recovers.

Art_Phantom_full_TH_CL_PS: Present DD at 4.9% and want to see if it recovers DD.

Though it is not preferable to run any EA during NFP, i just wanted to test if these EA 's withstand such volatility.

Vienna, change pairs in "Add to winning pairs"...

Phantom_Full

A big breakout in the market just zone. Basket closed after 2 days of floating. Drawdown remains at -7.9%, so amazing.

I now confirmed why my profit reduced from $400 to $300 2-3 days ago. It was the slow close_all_trade loop. I think the EA took 5-6 minutes to clear all the trades and the market went opposite direction before all being closed. Today the opposite happened. I got some trade closed at the beginning of the breakout but many more closed 5 minutes later almost at the top of the breakout. Now my profit jumped to $1200.

The EA is saved, no replacement

--- 帖子 #1017 ---
Hello Navk, can you keep all of them open? And not to close them all because this is the perfect time, its good that today is a bad day for this bot. Then we'll see its weakness and can improve it. I'm so happy that the news today made the EA worse.

P.S.   I will appreciate it (based on the condition that you are not trading it live now)

Thanks

LP

--- 帖子 #1018 ---
Yes, i did not close any of them. But will check after few days.

--- 帖子 #1019 ---
you cant run more than 1 pair simultaneously. it uses AccountEquity, AccountBalance variables...

--- 帖子 #1020 ---
I think, you can add the hedge option, for the "cut the losers" version. It's better cause the second chance. If the EA close the trade, it doesn't have this second chance. At the "cut the loser" point, hedge it, and give a second chance. If the price turn again into right way, double the original trade at the original trade's price and that point we have the "original" loss, but we have the next chance. If we don't have it, let the hedge on the way... (it's like we close the loser trade). It's a good way to save the account from the big drawdowns. The another thing is as I mentioned: If the EA close the trades, close the winner trades first!

What do you think?

--- 帖子 #1021 ---
My AP Full still ticking right along with no issues whatsoever.

Still has yet to peak past 8% ODD

--- 帖子 #1022 ---
Do you mean to close a winner trade if it reaches for example 2* profit target? Mmmmm, maybe you're right, maybe it's better to close the biggest winner than the biggest loser.

If market goes in opposite direction after the closure, you win with it. If market still goes in your direction an inmediate new trade will substitute it when the EA will check. If we cut the biggest loser for placing a new trade you need all previous in profit and for this you need more time.

I don't know if I explain well or maybe it is an absolute nonsense.....

--- 帖子 #1023 ---
I was thinking about it, and I missed one thing... The problem is as we know, the big DD. Sometimes (worst case) the EA open a lot of losing trades. We don't know how many trades will be loser... BUT. If we simply hedge it at -50$(example) we add more chance to recover. Why? Because: We have 5 opening trades:

PP: 500$

1. - -100 $

2. - -150 $

3. - -190 $

4. - -200 $

5. - +120 $      ---> To recover: +1020$      (This is big DD)

1. - -50 $

2. - -50 $

3. - -50 $

4. - -50 $

5. - -50 $        ---> To recover:  + 750$     (This is not so big DD)

Why not closing? Because of the second chance. Is it good? Maybe. We can make a free trade. How? So we have two trades. On is a buy, one is a sell(the hedge) we have bad day because we open a buy, and than we are in a bear run. BTW we hedge it at 50$ sot it's not so bad  Then the market goes bullish(yes) We achiveve the hedge-sell position and the EA says it's okay to buy. Nice, we close the hedge position at 0, and than the primary buy at 0, or we let the position to turning to profitable. If the market doesn't turn to bullish, or we cannot achieve the starting price, we let the trades to flow and it's like a lose trade (-50$) with a second chance... and able to turning in the future...

So what do you think?

I'm not sure if I understand you. You say to cause an hedge situation each time we reach a DD= -10% PP for example ?

--- 帖子 #1025 ---
No. The hedge situation is when a position go to loser. -50 $ exsample.

--- 帖子 #1026 ---
I see, but I think it's better to decrease rather to increasing the number of trades each time you get to a big loser.....

--- 帖子 #1027 ---
You're right, but dont forget that the hedging is a stop loss "method". But it's better cause of the second chance. I think this is one of the ways, to make a big profit. You are absolutely right about decreasing  But this is only seems like increasing, in the reality is not increasing. You aren't increasing the loser trades. (the loss is stoped). BTW the system is amazing, and respect for everyone, who developed the EA!

--- 帖子 #1028 ---
I have to think about it. I'm with you, I love when the basket reaches an hedge situation. It happened to me today before NFP and nothing moves, it's the safest situation you can have.

Since I read your first comment, I can't forget the idea of cutting winners. What about if when a loser trade hit for example 2 * Profit Target, we close the trade AND when a winner trade hit the same, we close it too? The Balance will be the same, number of trades will decrease and we will limit the maximum for a winner and loser trade. And the most important, I think we could increase the speed for EA's reaction for openning news and fresh trades.

I think someone (sorry, I don't remember his name) is doing manually something similar with success.

--- 帖子 #1029 ---
Sorry, but can you explain it again?  I'm lost. Sorry.

Edit: I think we speak about nearly the same thing  I call it: Free trade, or non loss trade  Check the pic.

--- 帖子 #1030 ---
Caillou...

can u explain what modification to be done to change time frame ie full to light version?

I am not able to find out...

Thanx in advance

--- 帖子 #1031 ---
It's a bit difficult for me to explain. Basically I'm talking about the "Cut the biggest loser" strategy + "Cut the biggest winner" strategy but as I said before maybe it's a total nonsense.

About you idea, when a loss trade reach -50.-$, we hedge it, and we do the same for each trade with -50.-$ ? I want to understand you because it could be a good idea.....

--- 帖子 #1032 ---
I can't open metaeditor now, I'm not in the office but I think it's in the beginning of "Add to winning pairs", just delete the 45 checking.....

--- 帖子 #1033 ---
You get it! Yes. We hedge the -50$ trades.  As I explained, it's like a stop loss, with a second chance. So in Worst Case, the hedge will remains for years... like an "opened stop loss".

--- 帖子 #1034 ---
Ok, I have to think about it.......

--- 帖子 #1035 ---
I continue to make adjustments on the 4D version and an occasional 2%+ daily ain't all bad (running with another EA). I'll continue tweaking and post a final version if I find it.

I'll likely try moving away from trading EUR pairs due to the higher margin requirements. At 50:1 margin, 1 lot of EUR is $279 +, GBP pairs are $317 or so while NZDUSD requires about $152. That's worthy of consideration.

Further testing needed.

TR

Thank you TR,

Please keep posting your results.......

--- 帖子 #1037 ---
In my own thread somebody asked me about my hedge system and I think we have to talk about it. The question was, what happens when we close the hedge position at 0 loss, and the price turns once again to short direction. (the candles turn short if the price is between the hedge and the primary position).

I think we can add the third chance, example at -100$ or somewhere. I think we can't lose the 2-3-4-5... chances... it's so unreal. If we win only one chance, we win back all of the losses. Of course we have to make a good money management system customized for each pair. And remember this system is working only if we have a hard time and big losses.

--- 帖子 #1038 ---
I' m going to read your thread, sounds really interesting......

--- 帖子 #1039 ---
Good morning

After extream now I stopped testing full version. (DD -$200+, for 0.01 lot size, 20+trades running, 1:100 margin).

Light version is still under control.

Started single pair phantom testing on 5m 15m 30m 60m timeframes.

Regards,

24hrs

--- 帖子 #1040 ---
24hrs, it is because you are testing with MMTU set to 50 (50% of your margin), is that correct?

--- 帖子 #1041 ---
Yaa may be....

but I dont give more importance to MMTU.. and I will not mind to use even 90% MMTU either. I dont think MMTU makes any change even if it use 10%... Just only less trades, but very less hopes for recovery.

But 30-20 trades with more than $200 dd is not justified for any EA.

--- 帖子 #1042 ---
Despite closing the biggest loser last week, Max DD now on 27% with art_phantom_full

Although very dissapointing, as its on a live account, I will let it run its course either to a margin call or to recovery...

--- 帖子 #1043 ---
Phantom_Full

1 Basket closed, carry over from last Friday. Plus 2 more baskets today since I use low PCT. If EU keep going south, going to close another basket soon (I saw EU bouncing back up just now).

MMTU 1.6

PCT 0.4

DD -7.9

Cum Profit since day1 $1300

Opened another system:

Phantom_Full_SinglePair

1 basket closed, but now EA stop trading? Will wait for some more minutes before restarting the EA.

MMTU 1.0

PCT 1.0

DD.. (i guess EA reset it to zero?)

--- 帖子 #1044 ---
It matters because it determines the lotsize your trades are opening at.  If you lotsize is too high relative to your balance, of course your DD is doing to be too high.

I STILL have yet to see dd over 8%, and I have been running full untouched for the 3rd week now.

Hi Tazmaan,

What were your settings, leverage and account balance for your Art_Phantom_Full? Running 24/7?

An 8% DD is really comfortable.

My settings are the same as dambusters, however I am running 300:1 leverage, thats the difference I guess.

I am still on .01 lots

--- 帖子 #1049 ---
Hi.... for the sake of clarity can you please explain. It does say in your "myfxbook" that the DD is 13.57%. And if your monthly gains are 39.47% then your daily gains must be close to 2%. Is that correct?

Also, if your balance is 1k, what was your beginning balance.

Sorry to ask so many questions but I'm just trying to get the full picture.

Regards,

TR

--- 帖子 #1050 ---
TR.

The dd shown on myfx is based on closed trades.  I have been tracking my actual dd and it hasn't gone higher than 8.1%, so what happened was all negative trades closed first in the group, then the positives, which made it calculate the dd higher is all.

As far as the daily, it hasn't been running a month yet, so it's just calculating the daily/monthly based on the 2+ weeks its been running (I believe this is my 3rd week now).

Starting balance was 1k

--- 帖子 #1051 ---
Got it ! Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1052 ---
Thank you for explaining that to him

--- 帖子 #1053 ---
You think you can avoid the unavoidable. Or more specifically I thought the "Artful Phantom Dodger" might dodge the inevitable. It didn't.

On Friday it got caught in the NFP follies and had been "stuck" since. Meanwhile the CR 3 EA had been steadily making profits until it reached the APD's Equity Profit Target, causing the APD to close trades for a loss.

I'm sure a programmer could fix that but that ain't me so maybe I'll tweak this or adjust that or....

Still, the account is up nearly 1.5% per day even after the loss..... I'll consider whether to continue this "experiment".

--- 帖子 #1054 ---
MMTU will only prevent you from overtrading and not from DD. Insted of MMTU, if option like 'maximum no. of trade' would be better alternative.

Suppose for single pair phantom if we can restrict max no of buy trades and sell trades (say total 20, 10 buy, 10 sell) then it will create pure hedge and we could able to freez drawdown at certain level. Same for 3 pair phantom (say total 15, 5 trades for each pair)

I am testing APL from last 10-15 days. It havnt clossed any baskets in last 4-3 days. It has trading all three pairs but unequal in proportion. Drawdown is increasing.

Just think on option 'Max no. of trades'

Regards

24hrs.

--- 帖子 #1055 ---
May I ask you what exactly, do you think MMTU does? How does it prevent you from over trading? What is it for?

--- 帖子 #1056 ---
I decided to stop Phantom_Full and switch to test Phantom_Full_SinglePair. I think the EA can reach another basket, only I dont have patient to wait the slow drop (the price hovering at halfway to my positive PL).

So, already opened new account. testing at:

Since last Tuesday the same basket, 13 trades, floating DD: -7%, goes between -8%/-6% for 1 week, extremely boring, will wail till basket close and end for this demo.

Too early for conclusions but sounds goooooood.....

--- 帖子 #1063 ---
I have Art_Phantom_Full_TH_CL_PS on one demo, a version of Art_Phantom_Full_TH_CL_PS that I modified myself on another demo, and TradeRunner's version that trades 4 x per day on another demo. The thing is that none of them have made any trades at all over a period of several days. I have restarted platforms, deleted all global variables and restarted - the obvious things - but nothing seems to kick them into life.

Does anyone have any special trick to this?

--- 帖子 #1064 ---
All previous trades were in profit?

--- 帖子 #1065 ---
None of these have ever traded. All started on fresh demo accounts and this is the first time I have ever tested any of these.

--- 帖子 #1066 ---
Then the problem might be your broker and MMTU......

--- 帖子 #1067 ---
Make sure that ALL 14 pairs that the EA displays on the chart are also showing in the Market Watch window (that's the primary cause of the Phantom EA's not taking trades).

Another closure, + 2,64%, for 12 hours test......

--- 帖子 #1069 ---
Hi,

I have done a lot of forward testing on demo accounts (VPS) and think, that Art Phantom too often opens position into the "wrong" direction. This of course ends up in draw downs that all of us are hardly trying to avoid.

After analyzing the forward test, I decided to use a trend filter. As QQE Advance gives reliable results, I quickly hacked together a modified version of the Art Phantom EA now using QQE. From my observation it gives better results than the other variants of the Art Phantom. But please try for yourself.

Put the attached modified EA in your /experts folder and the QQE indicator in the /experts/indicators dir. The Art Phantom QQE introduces a few new parameters (scroll down to the bottom of the input parameters):

QQE_Timeframe: The timeframe QQE uses. I had good results with 60 (= 1h) and 30 (= 30m).
QQE_SF, QQE_RSI_Period, QQE_WP: leave these as they are unless you know what you are doing!

Furthermore the actual trend of QQE is displayed in brackets right to the Phantom pairs.

The massive use of QQE consumes a lot of CPU power. Please don't complain if your machine is getting slow

One final word. While using this modified version of the Art Phantom, I usually leave the PP very small (like 0.2), especially when using small timeframes (QQE_Timeframe=30). This results in frequent trades and quick (small) profits. Looks like I prefer to have some small money quick in my pocket

Cheers,

Andy

--- 帖子 #1070 ---
You're EXACTLY right. There may be other ways to overcome this problem than what you're suggesting but as far as I'm concerned, you're suggestions are welcome.

I'm very near to scrapping the whole Phantom EA idea. I know there's potential but I haven't the time/patience/coding knowledge to "get it right" and there are other alternatives.

Kind Regards,

TR

--- 帖子 #1071 ---
Thank you Andy,

Will try this. Do you have any forwardtest results with this filter? So entries would be filtered by QQE but all trades or only the first trade of the basket?

Thank you Andy

--- 帖子 #1072 ---
Ah! Could be it. Will have to check. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1073 ---
Awesome, thank you for sharing!  I was about to throw away the idea of adding a trend filter after my attempts didn't do so well.

I will try QQE now

--- 帖子 #1074 ---
Caillou,

I don't have any forwarding results at hand, because my demo broker accounts expired just before the weekend and I'm starting new one with a different broker.

The way I'm using QQE with the Art Phantom is simple: if the phantom trades indicate to open a new trade (winner or looser) it will only be done if it is in the direction of the QQE trend (no position will be opened against the trend). Everything else is untouched.

This might not be a perfect solution and I know that there are much more talented trades in this threat around, so I'd be willing to quickly program reasonable suggestions/changes.

Cheers

Andy

--- 帖子 #1084 ---
Single pair ea looks promising. i m testing on 15, 30, 1h tf.

but i think that EA (without pipstep) is having some problem.

Sometime it closing basket before touching profit target. Or sometime it never put trades though trading hr option set false.

Please expert coder like roundrock... fix this problem.

--- 帖子 #1085 ---
Hi Hopfi2k,

Your QQE filter is a good idea which I will be testing.

Could you possibly modify the EA so that the QQE filter starts to operate after a user defined time (Minute X) that a trade sequence initiates.

In this fashion the original Art Full or Art Light EA can start to work as originally planned and if in the course of time the trade sequence should get bogged down into a rut, the new revised mod will then ensure that thereafter we trade only with the trend as a way of rducing risk.

That should minimise DD, leaving us to consider a strategy to nudge the basket to a profitable closure.

In this quest, the first thing to consider would be to reduce the Dollar Profit Target after Minute X by a user defined percentage.  Perhaps this could be coded as an option.

Another idea would be to increase the MMTU after Minute X to speed us onto a basket closure to a reduced Dollar Profit Target. Perhaps this too could be coded as an option.

Clearly, forward demo testing will be rquired.............

--- 帖子 #1086 ---
I've attached single_pair_phantom_pipstep-ts-be3-qqe.mq4. This has the following filters added; stoploss, trailingstop, break-even, and qqe.

--- 帖子 #1087 ---
Thank you very much Cybernerd,

For now Single_Pair_Phantom looks extremely promising. Have you check all the code? 24Hr has found some problems. My demo runs ok but just since this morning, maybe later those problems will come...

Thank you

--- 帖子 #1088 ---
always give exact EA name. with so many EAs floating its difficult ti understand what you mean

if you are referring to single pair phantom, then you can run only one instance of this on MT4. You cant have M15, M30, H1 on same MT4.

If you are running only one TF on MT4, then pl copy paste the comments from Experts tab

--- 帖子 #1089 ---
Sorry for your inconvenience... i have attached same version i m talking about.

I m running 3 instances of mt4. for 15m 30m 60m timeframe each. EA perfomance is promising for all three. But i observe following problem.

1 Ea clossing basket without touching TP target

2 Ea stop opening new trades sometimes. (trading hrs set false)

Do I need to make any change in my mt4 and I dont know about coppying comment frm expert tab.. will you please explain how to do it?

Well apart from this if we replace EU UF and EC in basic AFL it working gr8 but here also EA is doing some problem. If you have time will you please code AP light for this pairs. I humbly requesting you because it works gr8 with low dd and less trades.

Regards,

24hrs

--- 帖子 #1090 ---
i am sorry, i didnt write this EA. Somebody took my EA and did some code changes

if your intention is trade a single pair phantom, then please use 'Single Pair Phantom'  It has support for pipstep, trading hours, stoploss

--- 帖子 #1091 ---
Hey it is the same version. I only change the name to identify from my expert folder.

--- 帖子 #1092 ---
why dont you take the latest EA from the attachments and test it. this will make sure everyone is on same page

--- 帖子 #1093 ---
I agree, I had some problems with DD (not showing Max but Current DD) with Single_Pair_Phantom version without Pipstep mod.

I´m testing last Single_Pair_Phantom version and DD is showing correctly so I suggest everyone who wants to try 1 pair EA to test the last one from Roundrock.

--- 帖子 #1094 ---
Nicastro,

Thank you very much for your suggestions!

What I already have implemented (but never disclosed *g*) is that the "distance" between the main (thick line) and signal (dotted) line of QQE is continuously measured. If they are too close than trend will be shown as "RANGING". From my observations, the closer main and signal lines are the bigger the chance of a trend change is. In that case, no new trades will be opened.

Coming back to your suggestion (sorry for the small "excursion" above), I'm not sure to how that would be beneficial. E.g you open a sequence of trades, unluckily, just before a trend change. Now you are slowly facing DD getting bigger and bigger. If QQE would start delayed, the only thing it will do is preventing opening of more trades, because they are against the trend. Whith the current version, it would not have opened a sequence of trade from the beginning, as long as they would have violated the current trend direction. The downside of using QQE is, that trend - depending on the timeframe - will always change. On lower timeframes quicker, on higher timeframes slower. That effect is especially in ranging markets a problem. I was thinking of using a multi timeframe QQE solution, e.g. checking of trend on M15, M30 and H1 is in the same direction before opening a position. That could be coded easily.

What we never should forget is the fact, that loosing trades are part of the game. We can filter and filter and filter 'till we don't trade anymore at all

A "reasonable" DD is also part of the game (whatever reasonable is...). It is impossible to hit the "perfect entry point" (well, sometimes you are lucky, most times you are not  ).

For most EAs, ranging markets are the time of frustration (in terms of DD). To filter out ranging market situation is (maybe) possible with a multi timeframe QQE approach, because multi timeframe trends will only match if there is a trend. On the other hand, this will reduce the amount of trades (and some guys like their EAs to produce lot of "action"  ).

If you fellows here vote for the multi timeframe QQE approach, because they too think it makes sense, I'd be read to code it.

A final word to ProfitPcs. The profit calculation in the current versions is a little bit strange, and doesn't make too much sense (at least for me). Why? Well, try a demo with very small balance (200-500$) and run the Art Phantom with 0.01 lots. After your first profitable trades, your balance (margin) will increase and your absolute Profit Target too! That means, that while your position size (0.01 lots) is staying the same, your Profit Target increases, making it more and more "difficult" too reach and therefor increasing the risk of DD, because the Profit Target can't be reached. In other words: the longer you run the EA, the higher the chance of DDs. (This of course only applies to small balance accounts, what real accounts usually would have...).

Sorry for posting so lengthly.

Cheers

Andy

--- 帖子 #1095 ---
Hi Andy,

Your position size is NOT staying the same, it will increase in the same proportion as Profit Target.

You should read Basket 14 EA System thread...... just my opinion

--- 帖子 #1096 ---
Caillou,

As I said: "...with very small balance...". The position size will stay small, because the account balance is too small. I just pointed out, that you'll face this "problem" usually only when trading live, because usually you start trading live with small account balance.

When dealing with $10k+ demo accounts, position size will be recalculated of course correctly.

Cheers,

Andy

--- 帖子 #1097 ---
on this, i have one idea. right now biggest issue is the DD. sometimes when the price goes in a slowly expanding channel, then it keeps adding orders in both direction, but unable to move enough in any one direction to meet our PP

Can we limit the number of trades ? lets say we dont add beyond 10, then we will not add new trade, we can contain the DD. but it will reach PP only when it moves enough in one direction.

i am trying to see how we can avoid that death trade..

After 2 (or 3 days) in ranging market, basket closed just now. Previous test I used MMTU > 1 & PP 1% and ended up with larger DD%. The EA still managed to close the basket. I restarted with new account with smaller MMTU just to see how big the DD will be i.e. to get relationship between DD and MMTU. I would expect low MMTU will give low DD, but with slower account grow. If DD low, may be suitable for small account when going live. Time will tell...

Art Phantom (Single Pair)

MMTU 0.4

PP 0.7

Leverage 100:1 @ $25000

DD -1.5%

I have taken the ones at post 998 and testing. Thanks. Will publish the results once i have.

--- 帖子 #1106 ---
Love to see the perforamance with qqe. i'm not testing this yet though since I'm testing the early version of SinglePair.

Since the EA can close 2-3 basket in 1 or 2 days, it is also good to test if we can close the basket at breakeven (or even at a small lost) after xxx hours of trading with assumption EA can make up the loss with 2-3 addition new basket close.

--- 帖子 #1107 ---
I am simultaneously testing both version (998 started today & 886 started from Monday), but surprising thing is that both are putting trades in opposite directions.

I am testing post 886 ea from last Monday on 15m, 30, 1hr tf.. results are fine for 30m tf and very good for 1hr tf but problem for 1hr tf is that sometime it stop trading or closing basket before hitting TP target. I restarted that ea 2 times since then.

I not able to find where is the problem..in ea or in my mt4

somebody please help me solve this............................

--- 帖子 #1108 ---
Well everybody here talking about single pair phantom... I am still optimistic about art phantom light.

Basic EA is not doing good with original pairs but its working absolutely fine with EUC.

--- 帖子 #1109 ---
2 more closures on M30 and M15, not sure about the best TF........

--- 帖子 #1110 ---
dont test 886. always take latest 998

--- 帖子 #1111 ---
problem with that approach is we may end in DEADLOCK. lets say we get 5 buys and 5 sells, then no more trades, this will result in DEADLOCK. It cant reach PP.

we need to get out with BE or slight loss. wait for few bars before we start new cycle

in short,

1. no more trades after total 12 trades

2. when we reach this state, change PP to slight loss and try to get out

3. after bail out, no trade till few bars (to wait for new range or breakout)

--- 帖子 #1112 ---
Absolutely agree, the problem with this strategy is not the possibility of blowing your account (of course, it could happen but you will have time to react before that), but to reach a situation with same buys and sells and not move for a loooooong time......

So Roundrock could you code your suggestion ? Maybe the "max total trades" before changing PP as an option ?

Again thank you very much

--- 帖子 #1113 ---
I've been following this thread and the two by metacoder.  Congrats to everyone who contributed on developing this system.  I would like to share the results of my testing.

I'm using the version of the single phantom ea I posted yesterday.  All my backtests have been performed on metaquotes 90% data.  Alpari UK is my broker.  Unfortunately, thats the best I can offer.  I've run all my backtests from Jan 1, 2008-to date.  This takes forever, but fortunately I have a fast gaming system.  if you are just testing a couple months, you don't see the whole picture.  There are alot of death trades out there waiting.

In order to complete a 3 year back test, I had to start with a 10K balance and reduce the settings to 10% of what most of you are running; MMTU: 0.04 PP: 0.10.  (starts trading with .02 lot size.  Minimum account size for this would be 5000 trading .01)  Also it needs a TF:1hr, I was unable to complete with the lower timeframes. With this setting it completes the three year run.  I'm not really concerned about the profits at this point (3635.39).  I want to see the danger areas and reduce the DD.  this gives us 50% max DD and a PF of 1.05.

I then added the QQE filter.  I believe this is hands down the best filter/improvement we have seen and should be added to all the versions of the ea's.  I left the QQE default settings the same, but changed the timeframe to 240(4HR).  After testing (30min/1hr/4hr/1day), this seems to be the optimal timeframe.  Net Profit:4569.48, MaxDD: 29.77%, PF: 1.14

Next I included QQE and a stop loss.  Optimal SL for my testing is 2250 (225 pips).  Without QQE, optimal is 2500.  Results are; NetProfit:6391.54, MaxDD:20.27%, PF: 1.25

One negative thing I've noticed about adding the SL.  With the test using just QQE there was one big DD in 2008, then 2009 and 2010 were fairly smooth without any big DD's.  After adding the SL, the 2008 DD was more than halved, but new variance/chopiness was added.  This appears to be due to reversals after we cut losing trades that would have come back.  There is probably a better solution than SL yet to be found.

I'm not completely finished testing with the other filters, but so far it appears that none of them add value that I can see.  As has been previously reported, pipstep reduces the DD slightly, but greatly reduces the profit.  I haven't tested any of the time filters yet.

Increasing the MMTU and PP, always results in eventual death trades.  I know some of you are seeing great profits running MMTU:.4 and PP:1 (so am I), but history shows us these setting will eventually lose all.  Please don't take this as negativity on my part.  I am very positive about this EA, I just don't want anyone to jump in prematurely and lose real money with this.  We need to find a way to dig our way out of the DD or another better filter to prevent it.  This is getting very close.

Thank you very much CyberNerd,

The more I think about it, the more convinced I am that Roundrock´s mod could avoid this big DDs.

I think too we are close to reduce this situation.....

EUR/USD, M15, 10.000.-$, 500:1, MMTU: 0.4, PP: 0.5, started test 5 hours ago, max DD: -0.63%

If we could backtest with lower TF than 1 hour, is it possible ?

--- 帖子 #1116 ---
point me to the exact ea (too many versions running around) and the timeframe you want tested, and i'll run it for u

really shouldn't get overly excited about results after 5 hrs tho

even results after a week or two, really don't tell you much

--- 帖子 #1117 ---
I know, I know but if I don´t get excited now, maybe I will not get later, so I like to live the present, just in case the future is worse.

Single_Pair_Phantom from post 998 (Pipstep 0 and the rest of filters false), EUR/USD, M15 (and M30 if is not too much), MMTU: 0.4, PP:0.5, 10.000.-$, 500:1

Thank you very much Tazmaan

Without filters, I wasn't able to complete a 3 year run on 15 or 30min timeframes. I just tried again with QQE+SL filters. 15min still dies at the end of year1, 30min makes it all the way. Net Profit:8047.45, MaxDD: 27.07%, PF: 1.25. Profit was a litle more with same PF, but DD is higher.

--- 帖子 #1119 ---
CyberNerd,

Thanks a million times for your extensive backtesting session. Great job!

Interestingly bigger timeframes work better, so H4 is the optimum according to your backtests. I think using the H4 for determine the trend and using a M15 for entry (that has to match the trend) should improve results. Unfortunately you can't backtest it any longer (not MTF support in MT4...).

Since it really looks like QQE is a solution to get a "smoother ride", I'll try to do some more enhancements...

Cheers

Andy

--- 帖子 #1120 ---
that's not a problem in MT4.

H4 is 60 minute x 4 = 240 minute.

if you use a EMA(5) for example on H4 timeframe, it is same thing for you to use EMA(80) on M15 TF.

--- 帖子 #1121 ---
Great analysis, and contributions.

Backtests are always painful to run and summarize.

there might be one alternative to SL in pips, if you are looking at some other possibilities.

maybe, SL in hours might be a way.

if a basket has been opened for more than 72 hours, exit it!

or Roundrock (or who) suggests a wonderful idea: after 12(or you name it) trades, exit it.

when we live in the "PRESENT", we will not be able to run away from "DEATH TRADES" if we do not want to take a LOSS.

--- 帖子 #1122 ---
Untill now, art_phantom_light has closed four baskets, the max DD was only - 1.54 %.

--- 帖子 #1123 ---
Hello Hopfi2k,

I have some ideas I would like to experiment with. Maybe you could assist? I'm not an MT4 coder, but I can sometimes hack other peoples code and get it to do what I want.

What does QQE return when a symbol is ranging? 0=downtrend, 1=uptrend. Does 2=ranging? The reason I ask is I would like to test not opening new trades when ranging. Currently the logic prevents opening short trades when the trend is up and long trades when the trend is down, but it will open trades in either direction when ranging. (or am I confused?) I suspect we might further reduce DD by only opening orders when there is a trend.

QQE might also be a good 2nd check when cutting losers. Overall we had improved performance when using a stoploss, but it made the results a little choppier in places due to reversals after the cuts. We might try only closing losing buys that exceed our SL and QQE=1(down trend) and the inverse close losing sells when they exceed SL and QQE=0 (uptrend). Implementing this is outside my abilities as we can't just set the SL when the order is opened. It would have to be tracked by the ea. Implementing this along with the other CL-cutloser code would probably be easier.

I don't know that either of these suggestions would actually help, but I have a feeling they could and backtesting will confirm or refute.

--- 帖子 #1124 ---
Hi all,

I took the latest ideas (credit go to roundrock) and changed the QQE version as follows:

1. Only open a position if trend of QQE_TrendTimeframe (default H4) AND QQE_EntryTimeframe (default M14) match. In other words, QQE for both timeframes have to be in the same direction.

2. If a maximum number of open trades (Reduce_PP_afterMaxTrades, default 12) is reached, the ProfitPct is set to Reduce_PP_to (default 0.0). This should in theory allow the basket to close more easily at the price of no profit (depending of the Reduce_PP_to setting).

I didn't spend time in testing this, so don't blame me if something goes wrong

Cheers,

Andy

--- 帖子 #1125 ---
Thanks a lot Andy.

So "Reduce_PP_to" can be a negative value ?

--- 帖子 #1126 ---
In theory...yes.

Haven't tried it yet, but I'll have a look into the code.

Cheers,

Andy

--- 帖子 #1127 ---
Thank you. Will test tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #1128 ---
CyberNerd,

The "RANGING"-question was a good one! Seems like you are having any eye for details

Ranging indicates, that main and signal line of QQE are closer than 5 pips. Whenever main and signal line are coming close, either a trend change is ahead (crossing) or the trend is weak. Instead of getting caught just before a trend change (main and signal narrow, later crossing), I decided its better not to open a position rather than risking to be trapped on the wrong side of the trend (by indicating RANGING which maybe is a bit confusing, maybe I should call that situation "FORBIDDEN" or "WEAK"?)

Your idea of cutting single losers when exceeding SL and QQE trend is opposite is something that I can quickly implement. Give me 15 minutes.

Cheers,

Andy

Here you go, m15 and m30 since jan 2010 (not all the way til today, didn't feel like going thru the painful process of updating my tickdata after 11/26, which was the last time I updated it).

--- 帖子 #1130 ---
Hello again,

...here comes another new version of the Art Phantom.

This time adding CyberNerds idea of closing single looser pairs if SL hit and the position is against QQE Trend. (good one, CyberNerd!)

New parameter in settings SL_per_position. Default is 50 (pips). If a position goes 50 or more pips into loss and meanwhile QQE trend changed, this position is closed.

Again, this is totally untested, use on your own risk

Cheers,

Andy

--- 帖子 #1131 ---
Thank you very much Tazmaan, but Pipstep is set to 15? I'm forwardtesting with Pipstep set to 0. I'm not sure about the advantages of this mod with one pair version.

Don't worry, thanks for your backtest.

--- 帖子 #1132 ---
Sorry, appears I missed changing that.  Rerunning them for you now

--- 帖子 #1133 ---
here they are

--- 帖子 #1134 ---
Thanks again Tazmaan.

I think now settings are correct but there's still something different with forwardtest. I mean with the same settings, in my forward test, my initial lot size is 0,2 lots to reach 50.-$ profit, that it is 25 pips movement for one trade.

In backtest initial lot size is 0,04 for the same profit, so 125 pips for one trade. With my lot size the first profit in backtest would be reached with 3 trades, not with 17 as show the backtest.

I think leverage must be much lower with Gomarkets (I have 500:1), MMTU with Leverage and Balance will determine Lot size, then I think results can not be compared with my forwardtest, maybe they will be better or worst.

Anyway, thank you Tazmaan

--- 帖子 #1135 ---
I believe my gomarket demo platform that I use for the tickdata backtesting is set at 300:1

I can't change it to 500:1.  I can play with the mmtu to get it to line up if u want me to, will just take tweaking that is all.

Not pretty

--- 帖子 #1136 ---
excellent analysis. this will really help everyone. just to make sure ShowComments should be false in backtesting to speed it up

--- 帖子 #1137 ---
Reduce_PP_to  cant be 0, it has to be a small negative like -0.1

with 0, we could reach DEADLOCK. if there 5 buys and 5 sells in equidistance from startPrice, then max net profit is 0 (minus spread) whichever way the market goes beyond the range.

--- 帖子 #1138 ---
I added bailout code to the existing EA. All prev features still exist, this is an additional feature

I added 3 new external parameters

TotalMaxOrders --- If the basket reaches this many trades (in both directions together), it stops placing new order

BailoutLossPct --- When we reach TotalMaxOrders stage, we look to bailout with a small loss. this is a positive number, but still a loss

BailoutCooling -- After we bailedout with a small loss, we will wait for market to give us a new direction. This is how many bars we wait after the bailout before starting a new basket. my suggestion is atleast 10 bars.

If after reaching TotalMaxOrders , we are in profit, we will close the basket and take whatever we get. if we are in loss and loss is greater than BailoutLossPct , we will wait and hope for a closeout at BailoutLossPct .

During backtest we need to vary TotalMaxOrders and derive a optimum number thats not too big nor too small. Right now i put a number

12. this is just a guess, so dont take it as final. keep changing and get a feel...

in case you want to turnoff this feature make TotalMaxOrders as a large number like 999

i havent tested this a lot. i ran one cycle its working fine, but cant guarantee bugs.. pl report any issues

--- 帖子 #1139 ---
Thank you Roundrock, great work.

Is it possible to add ( I think we don't have it in this version) the feature "StopAfternoTrades" ?

Thanks again

--- 帖子 #1140 ---
i need your support guys, i've been trading EURUSD for years and i'm tired of manually trading it. so finally i've made my 1st EA, and i wrote my strategy of trading there, it still have some bugs that i'm workin on fixing it, but I have tested it on MT4 tester and attached are the results on monthly bases.

I tested it on 10,000 USD equity, trading with 1 lot standard each.

my question is, is the Tester accurate? can i rely on it as its live trading? or would the performance be different on the live trading?

please advise ...

--- 帖子 #1141 ---
"StopAfternoTrades".  what does it do ?

--- 帖子 #1142 ---
If this option is set to "true", after the current basket closed, the EA will not open any new trade untill you set it to "false" again. I think this could be usefull if you need to make a withdraw, deposit, ......

You can find it in versions from post 1.

Thank you Roundrock

--- 帖子 #1143 ---
Great work roundrock. I like 'max no. of trade' option.

For me max no of trade before clossing basket in profit is 14 for 30M TF and 30+ for 15M TF... and for 1hr tf no of trades will be definitely less than this....

--- 帖子 #1144 ---
Thank you 24Hrs, will test with your max. No. Trades....

--- 帖子 #1145 ---
Thanks again Tazmaan,

But if you look at the statement, for M15 you have only results from 1-01-2010 till 21-01-2010 (with a lot of trades closed because of the test) and for M30 from 1-01-2010 till 26-03-2010.

So I think as I said before it is not possible to backtest this EA with MT4 in M30 or M15. Any suggestions ?

--- 帖子 #1146 ---
I´m backtesting the last version of this EA for 1 week (from Monday till Friday) in different months. I am not able to test for more than 1 week with lower TF.

I have tested M1, M5, M15, M30, H1 and for each week (I have tested randomly 20 week from 2010) always best results were for M1 !!!!

--- 帖子 #1147 ---
I have tested from Wednesday till next Wednesday (including weekend gaps) and results are the same: the best performance for M1.....

--- 帖子 #1148 ---
Basket still floating. DD less than 1%. May be 0.4 MMTU is too small for $25000. Going to up it a little bit.

--- 帖子 #1149 ---
Nice report.

I am using low MMTU because I feel once in a while the market will do big damage. Other testers are using big MMTU and that is good since we can compare the performance when the market reversal happens. If they are about the same, I would straight go for big MMTU in future test.

--- 帖子 #1150 ---
Wich TF are you testing Sayembara?

--- 帖子 #1151 ---
I have this log comment while using single pair phanto pipstep-ts-be3-qqe:

"Error entering trailing stop, error 4054, incorrect series array using"

any comments, please...

--- 帖子 #1152 ---
After backtests, I have noticed that:

1.- EA had always recovered from any DD (sure there will be trades wich blow the account but I have not found yet).

2.- Big DD usually comes after weekend gaps. I think there´s no filter to avoid this DD, after wich EA will take a lot of time to recover. Maybe we can try that: on Fridays, if we are in profit we close manually the basket and wait untill Monday to load the EA again; if we are in loss, we can force an hedge situation: if we have 4 buys and 2 sells, before Friday night we can open manually 2 sells, and remove the EA, then weekend gap will not affect our floating P/L, and EA could recover faster on Monday...

--- 帖子 #1153 ---
Caillou, can you explain this weekend gap issue with an example ? does it come after basket is full ? can gap favor the basket ?

--- 帖子 #1154 ---
Of course, the gap could be in our favour or not. It will only impact in our P/L if we have on Friday evening an unbalanced basket (imagine 6 Buys, 3 Sells).

On Sunday evening, if the gap (imagine 70 pips) is bullish it will favour our P/L, if the gap is bearish it will damage our P/L.

Any sudden movement (gap, NFP news) will prevent our EA to adapt to the new situation slowly, as it normally does (each 15, 30 or 60 min).

One week the gap gave me +5% up, other week -4%....I think it not worth the risk so if we have an hedge basket before gap, it will have no effect.

--- 帖子 #1155 ---
That's because those are the dates where it gets stuck in a ton of trades and can't close for pp

--- 帖子 #1156 ---
we need to make a change. before bailout buys, sells should be equal. else we can blow out the account. assume 8 buys and 4 sells, market starts going down. it never comes back, goes down to such a leevl that yr account is gone

--- 帖子 #1157 ---
Unfortunately this is the achilles heel in what is otherwise a brilliantly concieved and executed strategy

--- 帖子 #1158 ---
Each time I have tried to run a backtest for more than 1 week, at the end of the first week I get all trades closed like happens in your backtest, so each week I have tested (+/- 50 differents weeks) we have a basket wich the EA can't close for PP......so we have a "death trade" each week? And if the EA can't close a basket for PP, why it close the basket? Should not the EA leave the basket open untill the margin reach 100% or whatever %? Because when the basket get closed the margin and the balance is extremely high in my backtests......

I don't understand anything about backtests.....

Great report Vienna!

I agree with you, Single Pair Version is the best version of Phantom EA's in my opinion.

And I only believe in forwardtest, backtest has no credibility for me.....

Thank you Vienna

--- 帖子 #1161 ---
I'm testing on M1 exclusively

--- 帖子 #1162 ---
Regarding big DD and recovery, there is an area worth investigation in my opinion. The EA shows strength in closing basket after a big DD which is good for a peace of mind and confidence in trading. The question is, can we make more money by dropping a basket and catch-up with several quick, normal speed basket close. I am not sure how to to do this comparison though. I think testers can compare when the time comes...we do have many versions of the MMTU & PP.

Weekend gap does give impact, good or bad depending whether the initial direction is a fake or not. A big jump once market opens really catch the EA attention. As proposed earlier, waiting until several bars might help or put another no-trade filter, if day==monday && time <=4 for example.

--- 帖子 #1163 ---
not yet. in my backtesting several unpleasant things have happened which can be easily validated with little commonsense.

to avoid big DD, i added Max Trade filter, lets say its 12. we have 9 buys and 3 sells. net 6 buys, if market goes in opposite direction (it did), its like a falling knife. soon it hit zero balance.  now lets say we have 6 buys, 6 sells. net zero. but we are always stuck with the loss thats always LCOKED no matter what the price moves.  lets say your start price is 1.2550. we have buys at 1.26, 1.2620, 1.2640, 1.2660, 1.2680, 1.27 and sells at 1.25, 1.2480, 1.2460, 1.2440, 1.2420, 1.24. now total net loss is 400 pips no matter where the current price is.

dropping basket whenever we reach Max Trade is more dangerous. loss is 10% per basket whereas profit is only 1%. and we get into this situation regularly (atleast once a month)

if market is trending this strategy works (like most of them). when its stuck in a range, we are dead

why should this strategy work ? whats the edge ? we are taking a random start price and adding a buy above it and short below it.  if market doesnt move enough to reach PP, we will keep adding more trades and the situation gets worse. the basket reaches a stage where either you are stuck with a huge DD or stuck with a locked loss. if you have enough DD to wait for market to move in our direction then it works. for that we have to work with very very small lot, then profits also go down drastically

in case of multipair, we have several pairs and there is a chance atleast one or two will push it in our favor. and due to good mix, we dont get into huge DD situation as if one pair goes up some other will come down.

right now i have exhausted all ideas and filters to make single pair strategy profitable without a death trade

--- 帖子 #1164 ---
I totally agree with you. I find that AddSix versions (2a,1a,3b)  works much better due to the fact there is some pair or the other to bail us out.

This is what basket trading is meant to be according to me.

--- 帖子 #1165 ---
Single pair phantom is working good for larger (1hr) timeframe (till yesterday). It is clossing avg 2-3 baskets with less trades (max 8 pairs) with controled dd..but because of EA problem I was not able test it for fully one week. But now testing with roundrock new EA. Now I want to see effect of weekend gap.

As far as multiple pair phantom is concerned I am demo trading APL with EU UC EC pairs but here also I faced some problem with ea. But yesterday i again work on EA and started testing... hope so it will work..

My idea of basket trading was..

1. Open three hedged pairs at same instance

2. Give them time settle down say 60m

3. And then add wining pair at interval of say 15m.

And don know how it will work.

--- 帖子 #1166 ---
why do you need step 1 ? anyway you are going to add winning pairs.

also you mentioned till yesterday. is that forward testing or backtesting ? are you able to backtest for 1 full year ?  whenever i do backtest i get different results for same EA and same settings..

you can use this EA for backtesting.

--- 帖子 #1167 ---
Thank you Roundrock,

Maybe you are right, I don't know. Effectiveness in the hedge (and the hedge is the only real edge of these EA's) is bigger with one pair than with 3, 6, 14....

Only forwardtest will decide, but as I said this is only my opinion....

--- 帖子 #1168 ---
I still think that Floydian666 idea could be a very interesting mod. to test, basically it's the same as "Cut loss" strategy but instead of closing is hedging a losser trade. If a losser trade reaches a % PP (this could be an option, for example loss= $ PP) then the EA will hedge this trade (open a buy if we have a sell and the opposite).

I know that Roundrock doesn't think this could be an advantage but if a coder could add this mod to Single_Pair_Phantom version from post 998, it would be great......

Thank you

--- 帖子 #1169 ---
Hi andy,

Thank you for taking the time to respond to my post.

I have been testing Phantom Baskets for some 6 weeks and have whittled down the most beneficial as being Art Phantom Light. My observations show that this EA is profitable during the active period of 7AM to 2PM GMT. A Trade sequence opened during that time closes at PP within 150 minutes at a very respectable DD of less than -6%.

In my experience, the opening of a trade sequence during this time window is not an issue. Art Phantom Light does so efficiently. Using QQE to filter opening of a trade sequence would be like gilding the lilly, and to our detriment, missing an opportunity that will not come round for another 60 minutes.

With Art Phantom Light, seeking to trade beyond this time window is courting a DD problem. It is a bigger DD problem if you are using Art Phantom Full and exponentially more so if you should seek to use the Extreme version.

With Art Phantom Light, a sequence opened after 2PM lingers for longer and the longer it takes to close, the greater the DD and the greater the risk that the basket will drift for hours on end. Often until the next day where the opportunity cost of not being in the maket at its most active period (7AM -2PM) becomes considerable

There is of course no way of knowing when a drifting basket will arise, but as sure as eggs are eggs, a drifting basket will arise and hence it is important to have measures in place to control the risks posed by them.

A multitime frame QQE would be a very effective risk control measure. A 4H, a 1H and a 15M QQE, would definitely ensure that trades are with the trend. I see that you have already coded a 4H and 15M QQE indicator. Can you please add to it, as an option, the 1H QQE suggested so that if acivated all 3 indicators would need to be in agreement?

I am pleased that your modification at #1142 gives the EA the facility to reduce PP after a set number of trades. This will hopefully get us to a quicker closure of the basket and move onwards and upwards from there.

As you can probably tell, I am not a coder. I would not know where to start- even on a simple cut and paste operation. Would it be possible for you to code that:-

a) QQE would set in only after a trade sequence contains a user defined number of "X" trades

b) That MMTU can be altered to "Y" after a set number of trades

c) To set a user defined total maximum number of orders that may be comprised within a trade sequence

With all these in place, I think we can keep the DD beast on a leash

I hope that these can help fellow traders

Sincerely

Giuseppe

Oh, Roundrock, your generosity has no limits.

I think the only way to test a mod is doing forwardtest so next Monday I will start with this one...

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #1172 ---
Sorry Roundrock, just one question: if the trade A has a loss=%PP, then the EA will open an opposite trade B but if later the same trade A becomes a winner and then reaches again a new loss=%PP, the EA will open another opposite trade or not ? Because once a trade A is hedged, we don't have to hedge it again anymore, neither A nor B.

I don't know if I have explained well, or if it is possible to code like that, sorry.

Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #1173 ---
hedge is placed only ONCE per trade. also hedged trade can be hedged. lol. i added a cap for number hedges, sometimes market goes up and down in a range, then we keep getting real trades and hedged trades, soon DD multiples. CLM must be above 3, else you get too many hedges.

pl redownload the EA

--- 帖子 #1174 ---
10k , 200:1 MMTU 0.2, PP 2, lot size 0.1, H1, CLM 3, CLCap 15, since jan1 2010 --> closing balance 17800

10k , 200:1 MMTU 0.2, PP 1, lot size 0.1, H1, CLM 3, CLCap 15, since jan1 2010 --> closing balance 18100  Max DD 48%

10k , 200:1 MMTU 0.2, PP 0.5, lot size 0.1, H1, CLM 3, CLCap 15, since jan1 2010 --> closing balance 15100

so higher PP is looking better. also CL Hedge concept is looking better (thanks caillou)

without CLM

10k , 200:1 MMTU 0.2, PP 1, lot size 0.1, H1, since jan1 2010 --> closing balance 15700   Max DD 61%

10k , 200:1 MMTU 0.2, PP 2, lot size 0.1, H1, since jan1 2010 --> closing balance 15600

dd on those roundrock?

--- 帖子 #1176 ---
Its confusing...

which ea i should test from monday.. lots of versions

--- 帖子 #1177 ---
Hi Roundrock,

So now each time a trade A reaches loss=%PP, we hedged with trade B but trade A and trade B could be hedged more than once? Is this correct? And CAP limits the numbers of times the EA hedges a trade?

So it's not possible once a trade A is hedged by trade B to bookmark trade A and B in order to not get hedged anymore?

If all that is correct, I think it could be easier to just add "Cut loss" mod. (classic version) to Single_Pair_Phantom.

I prefer the hedge mod but I think that to make it works properly we need that once a trade A is hedged by B, A and B could not be hedged anymore.

Thank you Roundrock for all your time and effort.

--- 帖子 #1178 ---
i updated my results

--- 帖子 #1179 ---
Lets A is long trade and is in loss, reached CLM. Now a hedge short trade  B is placed. from now on there will not be any hedge trades on A. But hedged trade B can run into loss, another hedge trade C is placed on B.

for hedging we take original trades as well as hedged trades.

CutLoserCap is for entire basket. not for one trade

--- 帖子 #1180 ---
Thank you, all clear now.......

So is it possible to not hedge trade B? Because trade A and trade B are hedged and the loss is locked forever so if we do that maybe we don't need CAP mod.....

--- 帖子 #1181 ---
done.  both A, B will not hedged again, pl take EA again

--- 帖子 #1182 ---
Thank you Roundrock.

Like this, trades hedged will be less, we are going to lock a loss when it reaches CLM and we are going to maximize the authentic potential of this EA: the HEDGE.

Now I can't run any backtest, I'm at home with Macs, and on my VPS a backtest is extremely slow. Tomorrow at the office with PCs I'll do.......

--- 帖子 #1183 ---
i got worse results with this mod. it hit 0 balance.

Hi Roundrock,

I have noticed that with last version (with CLM mod) the EA doesn´t open any new trade after a few hours running. I had tested with 2 differents brokers, differents leverage, CLM: 1.0 and CLM: 2.0, CLCap: 100 and the same problem.

Any idea?

Thank you

--- 帖子 #1189 ---
For a new trade open, the Phantom trade must be some pips above or below "Phantom EA Start Price" or just above or below ?

--- 帖子 #1190 ---
Can anyone point me to Art_Phantom_light with trading hours? I have searched and searched but cannot find it

TIA

--- 帖子 #1191 ---
if its above or below start price it places orders. no other filter

--- 帖子 #1192 ---
Hi

Why not try the one at post 504

--- 帖子 #1193 ---
are you saying EA is not placing any new orders at all ? or it places some and then stops placing new orders ?

also pl copy paste the log statements from Experts tab. this gives usefule info

--- 帖子 #1194 ---
I have tested on 2 brokers, 400:1 and 200:1, after the first closure in one case and after 3 trades in the other, no more trades opened, really strange (no message on "experts tab").

--- 帖子 #1195 ---
I will try again.....

--- 帖子 #1196 ---
Art_phantom_light ( 4 pairs) has been running good in my demo since 7 th dec. Has closed five baskets since 7 th. Not much DD too. Max DD was 3.31 %

--- 帖子 #1197 ---
did you see this kind of messages ? also are you using any filters ? like UseTradingHours,....

/*

Attach to any chart, any timeframe. Do not attach to more than one

chart.

These are the pairs we trade:

For InterbankFX

---------------

Group 1, The Phantom Buys

6.  EURCHF

Group 2, The Phantom Sells

7.  EURUSD

8.  USDCHF

Initially, buy the phantom buy group of pairs and sell the phantom-sell

group of pairs.

Every 30 min, add a real trade of every winning phantom pair if the pair is

EURCHF, EURUSD, USDCHF, but only if all previous trades for that pair

are winners.

Close all when current equity exceeds ProfitPct above last flat equity.

Well I am testing above ea for EU UJ EJ from last Monday... and glad to say that it has just closed last basket after 3 days (ie after Thursday)

It has really outperformed. Max no of trades are limited to 12

But I want to test this for EU UC and EC.. I am sure it will do well!

Regards

24hrs.

--- 帖子 #1202 ---
Which EA you are talking about? Can you give me the link for download? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1203 ---
Actually I´m testing 3 Single_Pair_Phantom versions, all 10.000.-$, 500:1, MMTU:0.4, PP:0.5

1.- EUR/USD, M15, without any filter.

2.- EUR/USD, M1, without any filter.

3.- EUR/USD, M15, CutLoserCap:100, CutLoserMultiplier: 1.0

Today is not a good day to compare, the big move for EUR/USD is doing his job and all versions are doing extremely well, will wait this week....

--- 帖子 #1204 ---
cailou: I am testing single pair phantom too but in 30 min TF, it closed one basket but since then huge DD, presently at 10.92 %. I am not sure whether i am testing the correct single pair version. Can you give me the right link for download? Thanks

--- 帖子 #1205 ---
Hi Navk,

With Stoploss, TradingHours and Pipstep: I had tested version from post 998 and it works perfect for me.

With Stoploss, TradingHours, Pipstep, Totalmaxorders and Cutlosertrades: you must use version from post 1188. I only have tested this version for 2 hours, for now it works ok.

--- 帖子 #1206 ---
None of my single pair phantom doing well.

either not closing basket even after profit target or not opening trade properly

SO i stopped testing single pair phantom

--- 帖子 #1207 ---
Cailou.. my sincere request to you as you are inventor of 3 pair phantom..

Please do test art phantom light with pipstep for EU UC EC.

I have requested RoundRock to correct that EA.. If you can please please do it..

Regards

24hrs.

--- 帖子 #1208 ---
Hi 24Hrs,

Single_Pair_Phantom from post 998 works properly but anyway, you want to test Art_Phantom_Light with Pipstep for EUR, USD, CHF, with wich settings (MMTU, PP, Pipstep)?

Do you want me to test this version or to code this version? Maybe Roundrock is busy now, if tomorrow he can´t do it, I can try, I´m not a coder but I can try....

--- 帖子 #1209 ---
anybody who is saying a particular EA is not working, pl copy paste the logs from Experts tab. otherwise its impossible to fix the issues.

navk, always go to attachments and take the latest file if you are confused on what to take. just do a search on file name...

Me too testing ea from post 998 but sometimes it stop trading or opening trades very late.

Well I am testing AP full with pipstep for EU UJ EJ and its doing well. It has recover from minor dd after 3 day.. this is really gr8.

But I think there is more scope with EC UC EU... I am trying to do it with just replacing pairs from "Add wining pair" but it is not working well. Opens EC pairs only.

IF we will get that ea we can demo test simultaneously and compare results.

Regards,

24hrs

--- 帖子 #1212 ---
Ok, I will try this morning.....

--- 帖子 #1213 ---
I am testing the ones at post 998. The trading hours true or false?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1214 ---
False...

--- 帖子 #1215 ---
Hi 24hrs,

I have looked at the code for changing pairs to EURCHF, USDCHF and EURUSD but we have to change pairs from Phantom Sell Group to Phantom Buy Group and this is a difficult change for me. I can change pairs but not moving from one group to the other group.

I´m sorry but my coding skills are extremely limitated.

--- 帖子 #1216 ---
most of these EAs are copied from one EA, there is no externalization of pair names, its so tightly integrated with the  code, its hard to do such modifications. i tried once last month, it took a lot of time. but the end result is original pairs are only doing better than my modified pairs.

so stick to the pairs

--- 帖子 #1217 ---
Caillou,

Would it be possible for you to provide a version of Art Phantom Light but trading at 45 minutes past the hour?

I am thinking that 2 versions of Art Phantom Light running on separate accounts could provide the action but without the DD experienced with the Art Phanton Full version.

This is a wonderful EA - I doth my cap to you sir.

Season's greetings go to all contributors to this thread

--- 帖子 #1218 ---
Done.

--- 帖子 #1219 ---
After a lot of versions tested, once again I changed my opinion (). Until today, the most interesting version of all Phantom EAs (just my opinion) is Phantom_AddSix_03bx_CLTHPS with these settings:

- 500:1

- MMTU: 0.4

- PP: 1.0

- TH: False

- PS: False (I´m not sure about the advantage of this setting on this version)

- CL: 2.0

The same settings as Frazerd unless PipStep.

I´m still interested in Single_Pair_Phantom version but for now only for testing modifications (like TH, PS, CL) because the more optimized gain and DD are, based on my results, for AddSix_03bx_CLTHPS version.

I´m not going to post results since it´s too early, but I recommend you to test it, the results will leave you speechless.....

I am interested to know is there any standard porporton for lot size, Profitpac, margin etc...

How much is thd diff if I set PP to 0.1 instead of 1.0?

Suppose i want to test it on live for say $1000 (Margin 1:100) what should be lot size and profitpac?

Thanx in advance.

Regards

24hrs.

--- 帖子 #1230 ---
starting demo 25K

in the begining using 0.13 lot.... target is 200 pips

then i use max margin to use......2.0

i use another EA to set the profit at $151..

Caillou,

I have tested this this AM.  It works fine. Thanks

I´m happy for that.

--- 帖子 #1233 ---
Well still waiting for answer.

There is no option to set lot size in  Ph_AddSix_03bx_CL_TH_PS.mq4 so wht settings (PP MMTU) should be done in order to trade with 0.1 lot.. or how much account balance to be maintain for the same?

Regards

24hrs.

--- 帖子 #1234 ---
The only thing I know for sure is that for 500:1, 10.000.-$, MMTU: 0.4, PP: 1.0, standard account, initial lot size is 0.2.

--- 帖子 #1235 ---
hey for 0.02 lot size my config is 100:1, $1000, MMTU: 0.4, PP: 0.5

--- 帖子 #1236 ---
Is there any way to increase lot size without increasing acc bal

--- 帖子 #1237 ---
Increase mmtu of course

--- 帖子 #1238 ---
you need to understand the repurcussions of increasing/decreasing any parameter. pl understand each one. why are you stuck with 0.1 lot size ?

check with frazer's results, he mentions the right set of paramters...

--- 帖子 #1239 ---
Can you point out where are frazers parameters. I am not able to see here.

--- 帖子 #1240 ---
Really I can not understand why simple things made complicated in phantom eas. Cant it be simple if these have "Lot size" and "Take Profit($)" options.

--- 帖子 #1241 ---
I think MC's intention is not to complicate anything. With MMTU and PP the EA will automatically adjust your lot size and take profit depending on your balance. If you set a lot size and take profit, each time your balance increases, you have to change manually these parameters.

It would be more simple, but less effective.

--- 帖子 #1242 ---
One more time for the dummies (no offence, just a phrase!):

Lot Size = Last Flat Equity * (MMTU / 100) * (Leverage / [Standard or Mini Units])

e.g.

Starting Capital: $5000

MMTU: 0.4

Leverage: 500:1

Standard units = 100,000 (By the way, Mini units = 10,000)

Lot size = 0.1

Let's say the EA has grown your account to $7500 and there are no trades placed yet

Last Flat Equity: $7500

MMTU: 0.4

Leverage: 500:1

Standard units = 100,000 (Mini units = 10,000)

Lot size = 0.15

As you can see it will automatically calculate the optimal lotsize in relation to those factors above.

So as your account grows, your lot sizes grow.

When that happens it will grow your account faster while using the same proportioned risk as when you had started.

Phew - HTH!

Cheers,

TG

--- 帖子 #1243 ---
in all his results excel file, he mentions these parameters. he posts on other threads like Phantom 6...

pl note there are so many flavors to these EAs and the parameters change for each. you need to do some tweaking, forward testing to arrive at right set. if thats alreadt done by someone, you can copy...

but in any case you need to understand each of them. pl read FAQ by MC

--- 帖子 #1244 ---
single pair phantom:

The profit target is only 50 $. Now the profit is 500 $ and still the EA did not close the basket. Is there anything to be looked in coding ? Reply pls.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1245 ---
Hi Caillou,

In all the Art Phantoms, there are variables inputs for Sunday = 0, Monday =1, Tuesady=2 etc each with an ascending number.

Do you or anybody else know what these vaiable inputs relate to?

Could a coder use these inputs (or create others) to control the number of baskets that the EA closes on each day after which number the EA will not trade on that particular day - there are some traders, like this writer, who is happy with 2 basket closures per week day.

Perhaps someone can give this some thought

--- 帖子 #1246 ---
Sorry Nicastro,

I have never used these inputs. Maybe a coder could help you......

--- 帖子 #1247 ---
what it 'should' be is 0 for false, 1 for true.

Only one way to tell other than waiting for an answer, set them and see what it does

--- 帖子 #1248 ---
Yes, these inputs could be used to control the baskets closed on each day.[/quote]

Anybody able and willing to code this?

--- 帖子 #1249 ---
Caillou with wht setting you are testing Ph_AddSix_03bx_CL_TH_PS.mq4

I put cut losser 1.5 (by default) and PP= 1 on very small account of $500.

Now equity is $483 but profit target is still $505. I dont know how much time it will take to recover.

Have you set CL true?

--- 帖子 #1250 ---
Hi,

My settings are: MMTU: 0.4, PP: 1.0, CLM: 2.0. And yes, actually in small DD but DD. I want to try something different because when you are in DD, although a small DD, the big problem is that during all this time, you have no closures.

So when the basket get closed, I'm going to set to True StopAfterNoTrades option and run the EA at London Open and at New York Open. If before these 2 openings the PP is not reach, I will close manually if the loss is small or let the basket untill it closes if the loss is big. So I will have max 2 closures per day, but I will open a basket only at the start of each session. I have noticed that when a basket is opened at the start of one session, it closes usually faster.

Maybe in this way we can avoid some DD.........

--- 帖子 #1251 ---
It has been very tough days for both addsix_2a and adsix_3bx-CL EA's.

The first one has 28 open trades and DD 3.8 %. The second one has cut three loosing trades 300 $ and has very high target profit to close.

--- 帖子 #1252 ---
Yes, it's not effective to have a basket open for a long time in my opinion. That's why I will try to reduce this time....

--- 帖子 #1253 ---
That's funny, goes to show you how when you start it matters.

These past 3 days have been very GOOD for my addsix 2a actually
http://www.myfxbook.com/widget?id=70...pe=1&color=red

--- 帖子 #1254 ---
This is the first time i am seeing many open trades after so many days of demoing. Any way i shall allow it for more days and see.

--- 帖子 #1255 ---
Perhaps I'm being dumb but I've read the entire thread and have tried both APF and APFEU over the past 6 hours without a single trade.

I have an MB Trading account and although sometimes I get the window flashing with Buy and Sell trades appearing as though they're being made at the top of the window, no actual trades have been made yet.

Could this be my account or have I done something daft ?

--- 帖子 #1256 ---
cant complain much.... it closed 5 times on wednesday before getting this big basket. so it happens.  i can guarantee you the next basket after this one will be faster...

i like calliou's idea of not starting a new basket during asia session. thats why i am using TH option

--- 帖子 #1257 ---
did you navigate to another 'profile' ? or close the platform ?  pl check the logs in Experts tab

--- 帖子 #1258 ---
Hi.,

Now I am testing with CL true and CL false on 2 diff platforms.

CL True is struggling to rich break even

CL False closed one basket in 12 hrs

But according to you wht is correct option, set CL true or false?

Does setting CL true gives more profitable trades?

--- 帖子 #1259 ---
I' m not sure about CL advantages. When I start with 2 baskets per day, I will set CL option to False......

--- 帖子 #1260 ---
Is it possible to restrict no of baskets. how?

--- 帖子 #1261 ---
Hi every one! Who can tell me what does MMTU mean please? In Art phantom EA use MMTU but I dont know.

--- 帖子 #1262 ---
Only one basket with StopAfterNoTrades, after that you have to set this option False again for a new basket but manually.....

--- 帖子 #1263 ---
i modified the APF to externalize the smbols, this will allow traders to check with other pairs if they want. buy is always 1st pair, sell is always first 2 pairs. this is fixed. also you cant buy 2 pairs and sell 1 pair.

selection of pairs has to ensure proper hedging. EA doesnt care what pairs you select. default values are as per APF so that existing traders dont need to change anything

--- 帖子 #1264 ---
Good work Roundrock!!

--- 帖子 #1265 ---
Roundrock, cailou:

Single pair phantom has been doing well in my demo.

I noticed that it places trades immediately after closure of one basket, if time interval between basket is given it would be good. It can be left to individual's choice to choose EA sleeping time.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1266 ---
I've posted this on a couple of other freds about the subject but havent had a reply as yet.

Being a very successful gambler with my own automated Betfair algorithms and a reasonably successful part-time FX news trader (which I'm about to take more seriously), I'm interested in the mathematics of this system.

I can't quite understand the logic behind 'buy the pair in greatest phantom profit on the hour'. I appreciate the fact that we're dealing with synthetic hedges but because I don't know the FX market as well as many on here, perhaps someone could outline the maths involved, or at least point me in the right direction.

I've read this thread and most of the other phantom-based threads but the logic behind the concept escapes me. I'm not necessarily the sharpest knife in the drawer but I generally can understand stuff once its explained.

My own view of the FX market has been that any analysis of historic data is generally meaningless when applied to predicting future movement and whilst I understand this current system is not attempting to predict future movement per se, it is using historic data to determine an action. And I'm wondering what the logic is that is driving that.

Good work roundrock (as always).. I will first test this ea for EU UC EC. Does it has CL TH PS options?

Right now I am testing Ph_AddSix_03bx_CL_TH_PS.mq4 and it is doing well.

It will be gr8 if we will have ea like Ph_AddSix_03bx_CL_TH_PS.mq4 for single pair.

--- 帖子 #1268 ---
Some interesting thought. I am also seaching for this answer. Mean while will you mind to share your automated Betfair algorithms?

Thank you Vienna

Will have a look

--- 帖子 #1272 ---
Thank you Dambuster

The more I think about it, the more convinced I am about the need of limiting the time to trade. Next week I will run the EA only at London Session and New York Session.

Let's see how it goes. Otherwise, if we let the EA 24/7, I'm sure a big DD will come, it's unavoidable.

--- 帖子 #1273 ---
I can live with the DD but what gets to me with this system is that if the basket doesn't close quickly it will get into a long, drawn out trade that can last for days, even weeks. And at the end of it you either get a 1% equity profit that is probably all eaten up by swap or you get margined out.

It just does not seem to be a long term profitable strategy without some way of avoiding these tedious week long trades for negligable profit

--- 帖子 #1274 ---
Hahha. One of the reasons I'm looking into other possibilities is that the edge I have enjoyed for about 3 to 4 years on Betfair is slowly evapourating. This is happening because as time moves on, any marketplace will become more efficient and also in the current climate of falling liquidity, I can see a bleak future for my alogos.

Sadly they work best in marginal markets which are not very efficient but also are the first to be affected by falling liquidity.

One clue I can give however is to think how some markets are linked together, like in football. You'll often find one of those markets is more efficient than the others......q.e.d......

I enjoy maths and like to understand exactly why something works. These Phantom systems do seem to have a lot of positive trading data from users, so it seems that there is something going on. But I dont quite understand what the process is that is driving it. I'd like to know that if possible and will spend a little time digging around.....Any help would be appreciated from those better equiped than me.

Betfair arbitrage?

--- 帖子 #1276 ---
hi navk. good to know its working out well for you. during my backtesting it gave around 70% profit this year with CLM 3 and CLM Cap 15. this is without TH, PS. when i added TH for this, it came down to 50%. on H1. May be with TH, we should reduce it to M30. Somebody has to do all these combinations on backtesting...

regarding your mod, i dont see any advantage in that. can you eloborate on why you need that ? lot of times the momentum of the market at basket closure will help the next basket ...... in any case it opens the next basket at 00, 30 min.  but if the basket closes close these times, then next basket starts immediately. i can add this mod, but lets hear from others too

--- 帖子 #1277 ---
it has all the options, pl see the input variables...

can you explain wha do you mean by having single pair ea similar to addsix_03bx.....

--- 帖子 #1278 ---
No, not arbitrage, although I've done that too. I've also done bookmaker/bookmaker/Betfair arbitrage and that did well for me for a while but the bookies soon restrict your bets and it becomes a waste of time quite quickly.

--- 帖子 #1279 ---
thats the problem is a crooked game forex isntt much different

--- 帖子 #1280 ---
I agree. MT4 was built specifically for brokers to steal money from their clients. One day a good book will be written about the FX con. But that's not to say the tables can't be turned, at least temporarily....

--- 帖子 #1281 ---
I noticed that after closure of basket it places the first trade immediately for the next basket in the opposite direction of the trend. For example the previous basket closed due to more sell trades, the next basket opens with a buy trade. By the time it places another sell trade ( in the direction of the tend ) , the buy trade  looses a lot. See the attached chart with trades open, you can get what i wanted to say.

--- 帖子 #1282 ---
hi navk, i checked the code and my charts. after it closes the basket, it resets the start price and it places buy/sell at bar close based on how the bar closes. lets say basket is closed at 14:16 and you are on H1 , then order is placed at 15:00 based on 14:16 base price. i dont see any issue. its not against trend, the base price is reset after baskt is closed. if you want, we can skip first bar and place the first order at 16:00, this will allow more time for trend...

--- 帖子 #1283 ---
By mistake i uploaded this EA on 5 min chart. May be that was the mistake?

just not sure why my trades won't close even hit the ProfitPct.

I'm using original full version on live.

--- 帖子 #1291 ---
Be carefull on live, I have noticed that sometimes, it happens to me with Full Version, Add_Six_03bx and Single Pair Version, always live, never demo, when the EA has to add or close trades, suddenly I lost my connection to the broker.

It's not an internet problem, I run on a VPS, ...... Isn't a bit strange?

I am testing Art Phantom Light operating between 8am GMTand 2PM GMT.

These I find as the most profitable times to trade. Typically a basket openend within this time window will close within 150 minutes. Two closed baskets per day at PP of 0.5 is acceptable.

The first basket this AM was openend at 8.15 and it contained 4 x EU trades and 1 x USDJPY. Normally a basket will open with a max of 2 trades of diffrerent pairs.

Can anyone explain why the EA should have opened 4 EU trades?

--- 帖子 #1295 ---
To: hopfi2k

Hi Andi,

I thought I had better report on the performance of the QQE mods introduced by you.

Since my last post on 11 Dec on the subject, I have been running the EA with the mods on demo and have found that the mods slow down the operation of the EA considerably. In one instance of running the EA with the 240M filter, it took 6 days for a basket to close taking it through a weekend. At this rate the swap took over 20% of the PP. DD was very respectable at -8%.

However, the opportunity cost of waiting for the basket to close was high. 6 Trading days of on average 2 closures per day is substantial.

So while the QQE idea is excellent, the economics sadly do not stackup in my tests. I will continue with the testing after the Xmas recess in case my tests should have been unduly influenced by the season's slowdown.

As things stand, we are still left with the problem of nudging a recalcitrant basket to closure. My ideas on this are:-

a) To have a user defined option that alters the MMTU after X number of trades in a basket. In this way one can slow down or accelerate the basket to closure (especially when combined with (b) below) while keeping the concept of the hedge being the edge in tact.

b) To have a user defined option that alters the PP after X number of trades in a basket - on the latest version of the mod, this will not accept anything less than +1% - this is too high especially as often people are setting the PP to 0.5. The user should be able to set the PP to say +0.1% so that the basket can close at near on BE.

c) Further control measures to be provided by: (i) an option to set QQE into operation after a user defined number of trades in a basket and (ii) ability to set a max number of trades in a basket

Andy, can I please ask that you take a look at these ideas and see if you can take the time to code the necessary changes.

Best Wishes for the season

Giuseppe

To Caillou,

I have been testing Art Phantom Light_45 over the past week. It works perfectly. I have noticed though that the baskets it opens take longer to close than the Art Phanton Light at 15 minutes past the hour.

Is anyone else having the same experience?

On other matters:-

a) I have noticed that typically it is one or at the most 2 pairs in a particular basket that is taking us to closure at PP. These (this) pairs are manifesting good momentum whose potential for profit is curtailed at the point that the basket is closed. The momentum continues beyond closure of the basket.  But we are gaining no benefit from it until at best, the next 15 minutes past the hour. Why not capture that momentum by opening ONLY ONE new basket immediately after closure? Perhaps at reduced MMTU and/or PP and if it does not close at the next 15 minutes past the hour then revert to the usual basket disciplines.  Any thoughts on this?

b) Could any of the coders on FF make a mod that enables a user to set the maximum number of baskets that the EA will open on any particular day. At the present StopafterNoTrades has to be reset after every basket closure.

Seasons greetings to all at FF and especially to you Caillou and all the other coders on these threads who have together generated such a well conceived and executed EA

thanx for posting your results but will you please explain...

what it means?

me too faced same problem.. but with single pair phantom

--- 帖子 #1299 ---
Hi Caillou which ea you are testing these days?

I m testing Add_Six_03bx.. very decent performance but still good.

I m still interested in art phantom. Are you getting good results?

--- 帖子 #1300 ---
Hi 24Hr,

I was testing Single Pair Phantom on M5 and M30, and Add_Six_03bx with good results on live account, but suddenly, when I was at +10% gain, I have noticed that I lost connection to my broker in closures and each 5 and 30 min with Single Pair Version.

When I was in demo I had never problems, I had heard a lot of things about brokers manipulations when you trades EAs in live account and you are in profits, but it is impossible to know for sure. What is really strange is that in demo I had never a connection lost with my broker and in live I had only in closures, so the EA only closes some trades, but not all.

Do you know someone who has real success in live accounts with any EA in long term ? I ask you that because as a broker trade against our position, if an EA has success, it is very easy for them to break the correct operation of an EA........

Maybe I´m getting crazy ?

Change your broker. Find one, like MB Trading, that charges commissions. I have been with MB for a couple of years and have found them to be honest eventhough I am profitable with them. Their prices are better too.

I must admit I have only had an MT4 account with them for a month or two but hopefully things will continue in the same way.

Sadly the biggest problem with EAs is that MT4 was designed right from the start to be manipulatable by brokers. This is one of the reasons brokers give it away because they know they have plugins available that allow them to manipulate prices.

Most retail brokers are bent, almost by definition, so another alternative is to get an account with IB and trade currency futures instead.

However most people trade with silly leverage and over extend themselves, so in many respects they only have thmselves to blame when things dont work out when they move from a demo account to a live one.

--- 帖子 #1304 ---
I'm using IBFX US...

--- 帖子 #1305 ---
Sorry 24hrs, yes, Alpari UK.....

--- 帖子 #1306 ---
The problem is not one broker or another, the problem is the broker system. It's extremely easy to disconnect you from the broker, then the EA will not work properly. In manual trading this has no effect.

I know profitable manual traders for years, but I'm still looking for someone with an EA who could have the same success....

--- 帖子 #1307 ---
If by 'broker system' you really mean MT4, then I would agree. As I said previously, the reason for its existence is that it allows brokers to play around with the data and connections. Naturally some work arounds would be to trade manually copying the EA signals, re-writing them for a platform like Ninja and/or trading currency futures rather than spot.

But at the end of the day, FX needs greater regulation to stop all this cheating.

Hopefully an exchange like LMAX will eventually attract some money away from the bent MT4 brokers (and when I say brokers, some are simply acting as bookmakers).

--- 帖子 #1308 ---
The US is actually putting through a law so that any brokers in the US must give details of traders positions taken vs how long it took for trade to process vs how much the fill deviated from market compared to other brokers... this will tell the governing agency which brokers are acting under bad faith and failure to hand in this information will be a few hundred $ per day penalty.

Good thinking to try to eliminate bucketshops.

Hey its shocking... and very serious too...

But will you please explain what difficulties you faced with this ea. Last time and for the first time I ran one ea for more than 2 weeks but I haven't faced any problem with ea.

Is your account is still active or it is deactivated? I mean can you trade with same account?

Have you tried to restart mt4 and ea? Whether that ea is working?

I am not sure but I read somewhere that GIVE CUSTOM NAME TO YOUR EA to run properly. In my first case i have given custom name to my ea.

Will you please raise this issue in phantom 6 thread (I am not eligible for this).

and my final question is...
CAN WE TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST SUCH BROKERS?

Overhaul of the forex is needed. Fees and commission alone ie one area that needs attention by regulation authorities. I am not against spread, but it should be applied afterthe transaction is done not affront. A spread of 4 pips is something big that may alter the flaw of trend that affect your position.

--- 帖子 #1316 ---
Maybe it is just a coincidence, I don´t know and I can´t prove anything, it´s impossible to prove anything. I have only said that in my live account, when I reach a 10% gain, in 3 times I lost my connection to my broker when the EA was closing a basket. This never happens to me in demo acconts.

It was only an internet connection lost on my VPS, nothing more, nothing less.

I have only suggested that it is very easy to manipulate the correct operation of an EA, I can´t prove anything, since a connection lost could be caused by many variables, but it is very strange that it only happens to me in live accounts......

Hey, if you are sure about your broker, perfect. But me for now, I will continue trading manually in live accounts, because I have no confidence .....

It is just my opinion and my decision.....

--- 帖子 #1317 ---
Ohh.. so its just internet connection failure. Well how will you trade this manually?

Is there anybody testing this ea live? Can we trade this ea live?

My Single Pair Phantom closed the basket after 10+ days (EU price went up) and despite the year end market situation.

Leverage 100:1

MMTU 0.4

PP      0.7

DD      4%*

*Long basket duration is the price I have to pay to achieve this low DD. I like low DD, but the trading duration for a basket is way too long. Planning to test another MMTU/PP combination to accelerate basket closing, but undecided yet. Or may be to open another basket when the current basket is caught in sideway movement.

--- 帖子 #1330 ---
No no, now I'm sure...there's an error in my report, leverage is 100:1 instead 500:1 (ea doesn't read correctly this account parameter only on alpari demo).

BTW, now I am $5613, so many baskets closed in this 1st week ... I'm starting to think about the right broker for this bot in a live trial perspective ...

In the meanwhile I'm doing:

- some research to make me sure there is no statistical way to quantify the dd risk (whitout multipair simulation)

- running 4 setups on servers, playing with MMTU and PPct.

I'll chose the best performer with dd under -20%, wouldn't you?

I am not able to test this phantom ea for more than 4days. After 4 days my demo account shows "Invalid Account"

Is the anybody face same problem? What the solution on it?

--- 帖子 #1338 ---
The EA not supposed to trade 20 trades in a minute. And it should close the basket with profit before the 20-trade-per-minute incident happened. You should investigate why it did so. Regarding the codes, I pass. So far every EA on this thread open a trade per specified duration...at least the EAs I tried.

--- 帖子 #1339 ---
Got the same problem with other brokers?

--- 帖子 #1340 ---
Some broker demo accounts are only good for 30 days. I ran into that problem testing on MB. Look for an unlimited demo broker like IBFX just as an example.

--- 帖子 #1341 ---
May be its because of demo account got expire. i m using alpari-uk demo account.

I really want to know what will be the best combination for Phantom EAs (PP, CL, PS)

Right now I am testing Add_Six_03bx with following combinations...

PP=1, CL=2, PS=1

Results are good but not impressive. It takes on an avg 1.5 das to close basket.

Anyone testing with some other combination? and having better results?

Regards,

24Hrs.

--- 帖子 #1343 ---
I had a demo on alpari-us and it did expire after 30 days if I remember. Not good if you want to test for longer term. As for the settings you mention in other post I think it depends on each person. I dont test 03bx, have been testing mostly the phantom 6_01 EA's or some of my own variations of it. I have had better results using a lower PP, usually in the range of 0.3-0.5%. For cut loser multiplier usually 1 or 1.5 on a 50:1 leverage demo. I have been testing for 3-4 months now and find the lower PP reduces the chance of extended drawdown, and although the lower cut loser multiplier does give you more losing trades I feel it helps the EA recover faster when the market gets choppy and you get stuck in those 3-4 day basket opens.

My longest running demo is a phantom6_01x with settings of MMTU-0.5,  PP-0.25, CLM 1.0, lev 50:1 (I dont use pip step or trading hours). Since 11/24/2010 total profit 12.48% max drawdown 5.56%. I have tried many different variations of mmtu, PP and different leverages and so far this has worked the best, even made it thru the holiday weeks with no problems.

--- 帖子 #1344 ---
Hi,

Is there any way that the close all function contained within the EA itself can be made to work quicker. It is not unusual to take over 30 seconds to close baskets of upto 20 trades so that we are largely guessing at the PP result.

Sure, sometimes we get more than we bargained for - but more often it's less.

I'm not winging - but it would be an improvement.

Well with PP=1, CL=2, PS=1, it closses on an avg of 3-4 baskets per week.

Next week I will try for CL=1 (remaining same) Lets see what will be the results.

I am near conclusion that this ea make avg 20-25% return per month. and thats sufficient.

So plannig to go live from 1st Feb 2011

Not sure if "Old Ticks" affect the EA. Seems to make the EA stop trading. I'll keep testing & monitoring.

Hello all phantom lovers...

I want to know whether broker spread make any difference on PP or Cl.

I am testing Add_Six_03bx from last 2 months with following settings

Account1. $500 PP=1 CL=1 PS=1

Account2. $500 PP=0.5 CL=1.5 PS=1

Out of this account1 is doing fine... clossing 4-5 baskets per week but right now recovering from big dd... currently trading at BEP.

But account2 is nowhere in competition... it loss allmost 25% account balance and dont know when reach TP target. I am clossing this from next week.

For 1st account CL= -$5 and 2nd account CL= -$3.45

As per my knowlegde, there is difference in spreads for live account and demo account. Live account has more spread than demo.

Suppose if 1st account settings are used for live trading, broker spread will play major roll and may cause to reach -$5 quickly (as that of 2nd account) and will blow up account.

So the question is how CL is calculated? Does it have same (-ve) pip as that of PP?

Regards

I had a strange (apparently unusual) experience on my $10k demo with Forex.com with the extreme EA. I saw in the original basket thread that situations may arise where trades may not be opened unless the marketwatch window has all the symbols on display. I hadn't done so when I had started running the EA, I was using the default visible ones on display.

Maybe it was just luck on the day/timing with the bullish activity with the Euro, but I had 65.17% increase in the account equity from 8pm Thursday until the US close on Friday. 210 trades executed, 1hour average holding time with 1:200 leverage.

I'm curious to know from those who have been testing the EA for a longer period of time if this is normal behaviour, also if anybody experienced the same on Friday. Settings were default.

--- 帖子 #1349 ---
hi thorn, the EA i saw here doesnt have the CLM feature. can you post your EA. Also i noticed you are trading with different symbol set. i would like to test this on my oanda mt4

thanks a lot

Hello,

I downloaded your art phantom extreme EA but it doesn't trade at all. I try different tf but it seems I'm missing something somewhere... can anybody help me please????

--- 帖子 #1351 ---
Dear guys,

first post for me in this forum, and after i read all the forums threads i think, and read all the thread here, i decided to go with Ph_AddSix_03bx_CL_TH_PS in two live accounts.. so i will post here what happened in my account ..

i think demo is not enough guys or even the backtest, you have to RISK some of your live account to see it LIVE trading ...

and ALSO you have to intervention the basket sometimes.. DONT LEAVE it PLAY ALONE.. thats my advice... close some trades to make the leverage and margin breathing again and not squeezed.. and  let the profits run .

--- 帖子 #1352 ---
Thats gr8

I was also planning to go live with this ea till last week. I am demo testing it from last 2-3months on VPS. Its performance was fine. But in last week this ea works surprisingly...

My setting were PP=1 Cl=1 Pipstep=10.

With this settings it clossed nearly 5-6 baskets in first 2-3days (of last week) and then after wed its performance was worse of all my testing. It eat up all profit and cut losser continuosly for almost 10-12 times. Fortunately it recovers and rich at break even on friday night. So over all gain for last week was not even a single basket.

I test this ea on 3 terminals on mt4 for balance $500, $1000, $5000. I observed that even with same settings it shows differnnt results for different terminals. So my gain for last week was like ($500=$4 , $1000=$6 and $5000= $-750) I observed that this ea is little bit lazy on large balance.

Well it will be interesting to know what setting you are using for live trading?

From this week I changed settings.

For first ($500, $1000, $5000) setting are PP=1.0, Cl=1.0 Pipstep=20 and

For another ($500, $1000, $5000) settings are PP=1.0, Cl=2.0, Pipstep=20

Lets see..... Please do share your results

Regards

hi 24hrs, for 1000$ account what is your MMTU, Leverage and the lotsize ? is the lotsize 0.01 ?

--- 帖子 #1354 ---
Hi roundrock...

For all account size MMTU=0.4 (i don think it makes any difference)

Leverage=1:100

Lotsize= $500=0.01 $1000=0.02 $5000=0.1 (i think its automatic and there is no option to change lot size)

Regards,

24hrs.

--- 帖子 #1355 ---
on a 500$ account, 0.01 lot size is very high. in my view. i can understand the lowest you can trade is 0.01 lot, but i recommend atleast 3k account for this.  otherwise you will run into DD issues.

--- 帖子 #1356 ---
As I said earlier lot size is calculated by ea only. There is no option to change lot size. If you trade with $3000 lot size may be around 0.06.

--- 帖子 #1357 ---
you cant change MMTU, but you can change your account size

--- 帖子 #1358 ---
Hello All

I have been testing the Art Full dual QQE EA and have had good results and now want to trade it live on a mini account.

The problem I have is when I put it on any mini account demo or live message keep appearing in the expert and journal tab like this "2011.01.27 07:28:44    QQE ADV CHFJPY,H4: loaded successfully"

every second, the Ea Runs fun but this takes all my PC's memory and eventually MT4 give an error out of memory.

I then need to reboot the PC. which is about every 40 min.

Has anyone had this issue or have a solution.

thanks

--- 帖子 #1359 ---
The iCustom calls to qqe are most likely the problem. The easiest and most efficient solution is to remove the iCustom calls and replace them with an internal function to calculate the qqe values.

--- 帖子 #1360 ---
in your code, search for "icustom("

then you find the line of calling qqe

then add " if (Minute() == 1) " in front of this line

this is less efficient than zz's, but might be easier for you to do.  cheap 1 cent.

--- 帖子 #1361 ---
Hi all,

Well my testing of Ph_AddSix_03bx_CL_TH_PS is doing fine with settings mentioned in last post... will continue to demo test for this month...

Its approximately 7-8% up for this week.

But main problem I face with MT4 terminal is demo account becomes invalid after 3-4 days. Because of this I cant test continuosly. Somebody please tell me the solution? Its alpariUK.

There is lot of discussion going on phantom 6 thread.. but i am satisfied with phantom strategy used in above ea.

Regards

24hrs.

--- 帖子 #1362 ---
Hellow.. This will be my last post in this thread.

My search for success in phantom ea is over.

Thanx all coders especially mc, caillu and others for their gr8 contribution!

Regards,

24hrs

Bye Bye!

I am having great success with the original Art Phantom light. Basket closure at 1.04, trade only during London and NY session, start 2:15 hours after London opening to let trends establish.

I did not trade around the holidays and I do not trade on big news days. (except last Friday, that's why I have the open float:-) Common sense is needed.

So far I am up $743 with $112 float. The key is to have relatively small baskets trade. I have 'shirt-protection' of $250.00 enabled using 'All Purpose Trade Manager'. I am not going to allow a huge DD.

--- 帖子 #1364 ---
Wow I totally missed this thread. Anyone still trading this EA?

--- 帖子 #1365 ---
I think everybody interested in Phantom EA's (including me) has been posting in Phantom 6 System.

For me the best performance is your Phantom6_01 test posted a few minutes ago. I have started a new test with your settings and will post results in the other thread.....

--- 帖子 #1366 ---
how was the result?

--- 帖子 #1367 ---
i will test your EA, thank you
