I got this system, free, in an email from a guy named Martin Alexander. You can probably find him by searching for "Martin Alexander" Slingshot. I won't post his link, because I think he's probably a system seller. I've looked it over and made a few trades and it looks good. Pairs- EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/CHF, USD/JPY TF- 30M Trade times - 7:00 GMT - 20:00 GMT In the descriptions below, the "previous bar" must have a H-L range of, at least, 15 pips. Long entry- Bar goes below the Low of previous bar. Then Goes above the Close of the previous bar. Enter 1pip + spread above the Close of previous bar. SL- 1 pip below Low of current bar. Exit at close of current bar. Short entry- Bar goes above the High of previous bar. Then Goes below the Close of the previous bar. Enter 1pip below the Close of previous bar. SL- 1 pip + spread above the High of current bar. Exit at close of current bar.

got the email also yesterday did u get also the auto-scalper EA a while ago? must say the 30 min setup is interesting isnt it? clear video also great job done martin

--- 帖子 #3 ---
I ran the auto-scalper for a few days and lost a ton of money on a demo account. This one does look good. I made about 100 pips with it this morning.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Is that the same bar that extends beyond both ends of the previous bar(an outside bar) or is it one 30 min. bar extends one end of the previous bar then the next 30 min. bar extends the other end of the original bar? Thanks for any clarification

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Neither of those. Wait for any 30M bar to complete.=Bar A. Start watching the next bar.=Bar B If B goes below the low of A, then turns and goes up and above the close of A, that's a long entry. If B goes above the high of A, then turns down and goes below the close of A, that's a short entry.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Sounds to me like an outside bar. Either up or down. These are normally very good on higher timeframes like 4H and 1D. Not really looked at them on 30M.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
No. It's not an outside bar, Read the post I just made.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Are we concerned whether bar A is an up or down bar when we compare the activities of bar B to it. Would that have any bearing on the trade decision? Thanks for sharing. looks good dave

--- 帖子 #9 ---
It's not an outside bar, it's simply a break of a specific range in a specific direction. Example: If it breaks the previous high first, and then the previous close. Enter short. If it breaks the previous low first, and then the previous close. Enter long Fundamentally it's a simple system. What I don't understand is whether or not it matters if the previous bar is long/short/doji, etc. Billbss, what happens if the previous bar has absolutely no movement? (Open = High = Low = Close) Or some combination of that?

--- 帖子 #10 ---
I got this email too. I believe the setup bar also needs to be a min of 15 pips high to low per the videos.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Is there an indicator to trace a line at the previous high, at the previous low and at the previous close?

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Why is this anything more than just rolling dice? C'est a dire...Why should this work? Profoundly Perplexed Pippo

--- 帖子 #13 ---
He states in his rules that there must be a separation of at least 15 pips between the O and C of the setup bar (A). However, in his examples he does not observe this. He shows some trades coming off of near dojis.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Just your eyes. You could use the horizontal line draw tool.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Are you sure it's open and close as opposed to high/low?

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Not entirely sure. I'll watch it again and post what I find. Won't take but a minute.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
I was wrong. High - Low must = 15 pips. (minimum)

--- 帖子 #18 ---
No. It has no bearing.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Hi all, Yup, I received an e-mail about this method as well. I usually trade the 1hr timeframe rather than the 30 minute so I just did a quick visual check going back just a few days (see attached chart). If you are fond of the Keep. It. Simple. Silly. principle of trading this would certainly qualify and might prove to be a rather relaxed way of scalping especially on the 1hr timeframe. One might decide to use something like the 5 min for stop loss management and try staying with some of the trades a little longer for greater gains.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
I can see a bit of a concern with this method already...... As I was sitting and watching this current bar form, I noticed it become a valid entry. Within the first 15 minutes the bar dropped below the setup bar fullfilling the first criteria. Price then proceeded upward triggering a valid entry at 1.3665 (1 pip + 2 pip spread) with a stop then at 1 pip below the bar (at this point in time) at 1.3653. (12 pip S/L) Of course, that didn't last (see attached chart) and therein lies my concern...... an initially valid setup becomes a loss as the entry bar goes through its formation cycle while the market breaths. I am thinking that this might happen quite often and off the bat, I can't really think of any way to over come this concern. I may yet conclude that this may be one of those methods that initially looks good but in practice ?????????

--- 帖子 #21 ---
It may. To do a good visual backcheck on it, you need to drop down to a 5M chart. You can't be certain whether a trade was a winner by looking at the 30M. I got lucky and traded 4 or 5 live trades today and won them all.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Hi Bill, thx for bringing this up here. Looks like just my cup of coffee Is this meant to trade the mentioned 4 pairs simultanously?

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Hi please kindly help me to delete unwanted custom indicators. Thanks so much

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Yes. You can trade them all. I noticed, today, that it generates quite a few trades. You could probably just concentrate on one pair, if you wanted to, and have several trades a day.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
O.K. the charts illustrate what I mean. I guess they don't always happen this way but some obviously do and I suppose that is the "cost of doing business" and something to be aware of.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
It was definitely a loss, although a small loss. Losses will happen.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
I just entered a short on EUR/USD. It's not trade time yet. We'll see what happens. I went short at 1.3676 I'll exit at 0600 GMT. EDIT: +12 pips

--- 帖子 #28 ---
ok i just woke up, so still foggy. but is not tomorrow NFP and one of his rules is that no trades that night until a 1/2 hour past the NFP release. So no matter what happens tonight, his rule is to not be trading this set up

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Yes that is one of his rules. I'm going to trade it anyway, until about an hour before NFP.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
cool, was just saying it so really any winning or losing trades won't count towards are over all thoughts about the set up. anybody have the indicator that paints other time frame bars on a chart, can't find mine.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
found 2 mtf candle indicators gonna test them out...this 1 the best that i have. So 30 min candles added to a 5m chart

--- 帖子 #32 ---
On your MTF Candle chart - the colored boxes are ?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
5m chart, 30 min candles. so were trading a 30 min set up, but i'm also watching how the 5m bars are moving. using for testing right now. welcome back. hope your doing well

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Flew over your house on way back. Was going to throw a bag of peanuts at you until I realized that was my airline lunch AND dinner!

--- 帖子 #35 ---
... if you watch his videos you will see that some of your highlighted "trades" are incorrect. ( revised - not incorrect ) .... you do not use a short (down) bar as a setup bar and enter a short (down) trade on your entry bar. ( revised - you can ) edit: Sorry , i am wrong, as pointed out by one of the forum members - in video2 at 07:16 there is an entry for long after a long setup bar.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Ohh so that was you who flushed as the plane flew over....LOL

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Are there any rules about reentries on the same trigger bar?

--- 帖子 #38 ---
none

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Thanks for that, I couldn't find my copy of the MTF candles It's essential to use this for backtesting, there is no way of knowing from a 30M chart whether the trade was successul or not unless the opening price of the trigger bar is at (or very close to) the top or bottom of the final bar Andy

--- 帖子 #40 ---
to clarify edit: blanked out web address on image

--- 帖子 #41 ---
billbss I guess you were talking about that autoscalper. Yes, its a piece of crap since it had also killed my demo account so fast. How did you figure out the rules of this great EA? When I was watching it, I was wondering why it was opening short positions while price kept going up. It seemed to me it was like a countertrend scalper only - not good especially if price kept forging upwards.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Are you related somehow with Martin? With "none", do you mean there are no rules for this or no reentries allowed? Thx

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Another question that comes to my mind: How much minimum time we need to have left on the signal bar to take a signal?

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Is possible for someone to post the EA please. Many thanks

--- 帖子 #45 ---
LOL .. no she is my daughter, and we are not related to Martin nor know him personally, we are both on his mailing list. She is here by me now and the answer is that the video did not give any rules for reentry on the same bar. Hope this was helpful.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
It was helpfull, thanks I hope I didnt sound like I have something against Martin. I just try to get my head around it, and it sounded to me that Jnita might have more info than we have. And she has his url on the screenshot. So I figured I could ask Thanks again

--- 帖子 #47 ---
No problem. unfortunate he does not supply his source codes and that indicator is his "oracle" indicator, which has his details hardcoded into it. Glad to be of assistance.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Here is an indicator I just put together to make it easier to see the Larger OHLC on smaller time frames. I also included the Grid that makes the verticle lines and set the defaults at 30 minutes.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Having trouble downloading the grid. It's being read as an HTML Document Attachment and not an indicator?

--- 帖子 #50 ---
It down loads fine when I just tried it. Maybe something to do with FF server temporarily Edit: I just re-uploaded it to be safe. It works for me to down load.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
I just added the ability to turn the Price labels off if you want to. And because people will ask for it. version 4 has alerts when price drops below previous 30 min low or climbs above previous 30 minute high.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Just tried again and it downloaded fine. Think it WAS trouble with FF server previously! Thanx again!

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Here is an EA for this system. I am not a professional coder by all means, with that said please test and let me know what you think. The EA will give you some errors in the journal, but that is a small bug I need to fix. From my understanding of the strat. the EA follows the strat. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Thank you. A little feedback- On the 1530 GMT bar, your EA opened a pending order only for USD/JPY. It should have opened one for all 4 pairs. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Nice run. I will do some serious backtesting this weekend on this.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
I had two winners and a small loser on that last bar. Have a winner working on this bar, but it's early.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
I guess I'm mssing something. How do you have more than one trade on a bar when the exit is the close of the bar? Can you post a chart of your trades, Billbss?

--- 帖子 #58 ---
thatwasme, did u look at the video ?? coz the setup is wrong if u look at the last bar it was an up bar... so u should have waited untill it broke the high and then wait for it to go back to the close of that last bar and then take a sell trade u did the opposite.... just my thought

--- 帖子 #59 ---
thatwasme, sorry 4 that post.... just looked at the video again and you are right sorry 4 that

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Yes I have watched the video 5 times now and downloaded it as well. at 6:11 into the part1 he states that the open needs to be near the previous close and the low needs to be penetrated, but he does not say anything about the need for a previous up or down bar. only the trigger is 1 pip above the close of the previous bar and the SL is below the entry low.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
You are right. If you look at 7:16 of video 2, he shows an example of a long following a bull setup bar.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
look at the picture in 1st video, it shows a long set up and a short, there different bars

--- 帖子 #63 ---
The rules do not state that. In video2 he shows a long entry after a positive setup bar. He may show it more than once.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Hi Bro..."No Indicator System". I like that... Just small question..What about trend direction?...Or we just enter trade when condition meet?...No need to watch trend direction ?..tq

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Yup here is his screen shot

--- 帖子 #66 ---
That is correct, according to the rules as I interpret them.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
thatwasme, i stand corrected.....

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Well judging from your avatar, the show was worth the price of admission. LOL. No problem.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Ok thanks...Will try next week..

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Thanks for the heads-up, i totally missed this and as stated only followed the rules as per the 1st video ... will be interesting to see if it is as successful now.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Nice work! Has anyone actually backtested this to see under what conditions the best trades are made? I'll take a look at this weekend. From the naked eye it looks like these setups can provide very favorable reward:risk trades. However, this can only be determined by looking at smaller time frame charts to see how many times the price reversed to take out your stop loss after the initial signal.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
16 pips on the last eu trade sold @ 1.3474 and ended at 1.3456

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Good Afternoon Bill, Haven't visited with you for awhile, so I was very pleased to see you authoring this thread. If this trading method has caught your attention then it HAS to have some merit. I realize that it's still very early in the process, but your enthusiasm is contagious. I will further acquaint myself with the startegy over the weekend, and start trading this on a micro account after the weekend. If there is anything I can help you with in your development of this trading method, please PM me. Folks, if you are not familiar with Bill, he is definitely one of the most astute forex traders extant. We are fortunate to have him in our midst!

--- 帖子 #74 ---
thanks, nice work

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Bob, Thank you very much for the kind words. I'm not sure I'm worthy of them, but thank you This needs a good backtest. My wife is a little under the weather, but if I have time I'll try to go back at least 30 trades per pair, this weekend. That should give us an idea if it's worth pursuing. I want to emphasize again, this is not my system. I have not contributed anything to it. Martin Alexander is the author. I want to make sure the credit goes to where it belongs. I tried it yesterday morning, had several winning trades, and thought I would share it. It also made money this morning. If I can get the backtesting done, I will post the results here. I think a few more folks are doing the same thing.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
break even on the last half hour usdjpy trade

--- 帖子 #77 ---
and according to the rules its WEEKEND have a nice one evrybody

--- 帖子 #78 ---
It's a little past 1900. There is another hour left, if you want it

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Just had a couple of small winners on the last bar.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Yes, I just caught this little one for 26 pips

--- 帖子 #81 ---
I was having the same problem and just remembered the"magic number" needed to be changed for each currency. No time left today to see if that corrects problem.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Thanks. I didn't even think of that. I'm not an EA man

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Would be this a good synthesis if i give this to a friend who does not know english??

--- 帖子 #84 ---
It looks good to me. Just remember that the setup bar must be at least 15 pips from High to Low. Looks good

--- 帖子 #85 ---
I forgot one thing- The open of the second bar must be close to the close of the setup bar. You didn't show that in your pictures. It is anyway 99% of the time. The only time it wont be is a big news release or a Sunday opening after a weekend.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
I have not read the whole thread yet..but I must says...T DNA got it right... The Price Action that we will be looking for the very high quality reversal candle....the higher t TF,,the more valid it becomes..... It could be bull/bear engulfing...or doji.. It can be named as Wiseman1 in Chaos Trading system...... The only fallback I see it..the trader can reap better return if he trades in general trend in mind.... Bravo... Sonic

--- 帖子 #87 ---
I have been trading this for the last few days and yesterday, maybe it was the day before net me over 500 pips. Today I did not because of non-far payroll. Thanks for the EA timefreedom. BTW, I am back to my multiple daily entry system with fewer rules, but am up almost 23,000 pips since Dec 1st, 2008. One thing that I have also noticed is that there really could be a s/l limit, because some bars can be 40 pips on the stop, and I would reather just lose 20 and move onto the next trade, since some trades are for a small profit. The good thing here is that eventually the big trades come and if you would have traded non-farm payroll today using this system, you would have done near 300 pips....the big ones do come.... So, a max s/l might be a good idea.....

--- 帖子 #88 ---
28hrs from the first post and you have a ea set up and custom indicators.i think thats fantastic .i have a copy of the of the forex scalper from martin running to see how it performs.then i stumbled over this strategy be interesting to see how this works out

--- 帖子 #89 ---
This is a great idea... I'll check it out too... my other thought is that these are key reversal bars and to consider rules when I'll hold part or all of the position for a longer term trade.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Thanks, man! Very cool...

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Hi Bill, Happy New Year Bill! I'd like to wish you and your family all the best for 2009. Thanks for bringing this mechanical system to our attention. I call it a N.E.T system.... "No Emotion Trading" system. Time will tell, but so far this one looks good! Thanks Bill,....T-Wolf

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Thank you, Thunderwolf. I wish the best to you and your family. I'll try to do some backtesting on it this weekend. It looks pretty good, so far. I hope it holds up.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Great point. Backtesting on anything over 1 min bars can be misleading in some cases.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
I've already gone back over quite a few. 5M is usually all you need, to be clear about what happened. Sometime you have to zoom in with 1M.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
I don't find a link to D/L Slingshot? Please send reply to me email address

--- 帖子 #96 ---
The grid with the MTF OHLC is great - really helps in seeing the action up to the point of entry and using other methods to filter the trade or take a larger position.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
I just finished visually backtesting eur/usd mon-thursday on 1 min charts. It is not accurate up to the pip since I didnt add +1 of the close for entries. I just noted the trades on paper and dont really want to hack all numbers in here. But here are a few stats. A spread of 3 pips is included in all trades. First considered entry bar 7.00 gmt, last 19.30. Monday: -26 (my result was +4 in 10 trades -30 pips spread) Tuesday +148 (+169 minus 7 trades x 3) Wednesday +56 (+94 minus 13 x 3) Thursday -11 (+10 minus 7 x 3) Total for the week +167 Total # trades: 37 Wins: 19 Lost: 18 Hitrate 51% Average win: 22 pips (-3 spread) Average loss: 8 pips (+3 spread) Most consec. wins: 4 Most consec. losers: 2 Biggest Win: 83 Biggest Loss: 15 If somebody already did the same period on E/U could you please compare if I am about right or way off?

--- 帖子 #98 ---
I'll try it out.

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Thanks for the person who posted the EA, I will forward tets it on demo, happy to provide results if anyone is interested. http://www.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon10.gif

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Very interesting system... I will demo it starting next week and see how it goes. Thanks billbss for sharing. Fox

GBP/USD Mon-Thu Monday: +98(my result was +126 in 7 trades -28 pips spread) Tuesday +10 (+169 minus 7 trades x 4) Wednesday +53 (+101 minus 12 x 4) Thursday -88 (+56 minus 8 x 4) Total for the week +80 Total # trades: 36 Wins: 20 Lost: 16 Hitrate 55% Average win: 23 pips (-4 spread) Average loss: 15 pips (+4 spread) Most consec. wins: 4 Most consec. losers: 3 Biggest Win: 54 Biggest Loss: 49

--- 帖子 #102 ---
EUR/JPY my plan was to trade E/J instead of swissy and usd/jpy. So I backtested it. Backtesting this one was a major pain, and the result also. There have been bars where an entry was triggered and stoped out, and another entry was triggered etc, so I had 1 bar with 4 entries. Even though it ended profitable, its pretty stressfull. (the sequence was -2 -5 -5 and finally +28 on the same bar). Not sure if it is practicable, but there appear to be no rule for this problem. Monday: -76 (my result was -32 in 11 trades -44 pips spread) Tuesday +142 (+182 minus 10 trades x 4) Wednesday +7 (+55 minus 12 x 4) Thursday -75 (+31 minus 11 x 4) Total for the week -2 Total # trades: 45 Wins: 24 Lost: 21 Hitrate 53% Average win: 16 pips (-4 spread) Average loss: 11 pips (+4 spread) Most consec. wins: 6 Most consec. losers: 4 Biggest win: 42 Biggest Loss: 28

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Here is the EA with some bug fixes. I tested EURUSD, H1 for three months, Oct. - Dec., and the results are a lot better than on the M30. Please take a look and let me know what you think. @ Bill Make sure you change the MagicNumber for each currency you intend to test the EA on. Note: Keep in mind that this EA is not a finished product thus the usage of Beta in the EA name. Please use only to test the strategies validity. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Dan, those all look good. I'm going to try to do the same kind of backtesting. If you were doing reentries, I won't do them. We'll compare notes. Thank you for your help. That was a lot of work.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
That really looks good!! 1H may be they way to go. It looks like you've proven it. I'm sure you're right about the magic number. That was my screw up. I can't thank you enough for your help.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Bill, I have usd/chf and will do usd/jpy tomorrow or monday morning. I didnt check for the 15 pip range, I simply forgot since I used MT. To trade I use Ninja trader which has a bar range counter indicator, that made me simply forgetting about checking the setup bar range. But 95% or more of the trades should be fine by the rules.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
USD/CHF Monday: +125 (my result was +165 in 10 trades -40 pips spread) Tuesday -33 (-1 minus 8 trades x 4) Wednesday +-2 (+54 minus 14 x 4) Thursday -30 (+14 minus 11 x 4) Total for the week +60 Total # trades: 43 Wins: 15 Lost: 28 Hitrate 35% Average win: 31 pips (-4 spread) Average loss: 8 pips (+4 spread) Most consec. wins: 2 Most consec. losers: 9 Biggest win: 168 Biggest Loss: 21 Swissy was something special in the 4 tested days. There are 2 huge winners with +168 and +99. If you wouldnt have caught them, and traded most others, you would have lost a chunk.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
I tested auto-scalper with MT strategy tester and it didn't perform well.

--- 帖子 #109 ---
If you want to use the #MTF OHCL indicator that I posted on a 60 minute or any other time frame for that matter, simply change the input timeframe to the required time frame in minutes. (only standard MT4 timeframes allowed) and change anything in the grid that is 30 to 60 or what ever timeframe you wish.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
I will have to take a look. Thanks TF. I don't really have the internet connection to back test, but it would be currious to see a equity curve for GbpUsd, UsdChf and UsdJpy as well. Have a great weekend

--- 帖子 #111 ---
CHF has always been a rogue pair...IMO.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Hi TF, I noticed that there is no option to set the trade time (0700-2000) with your new version and that it trades all hours. Was that intentional? Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #113 ---
I may be doing something wrong in my back test or maybe difference in Brokers causes different results. Can you tell me if I handled the trade below correctly ? Blue lines are setup bar high and low. Red is setup bar close. Bar #1 broke low Bar#2 moved above Close for a long entry Bar#3 moved below Bar#1 for stop out

--- 帖子 #114 ---
It looks correct to me.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
I don't think that his chart is correct accoding to my understanding Here is a chart with a trade the way that I understand it. Attached Image (click to enlarge) 1st...price of current bar needs to break the high or low of the previous bar 2nd...if it breaks low you are looking for a long trade 3rd...if it breaks high you are looking for a short trade 4th...once a break occurs, you then enter when price comes back and goes either 1 pip above or below the close of the previous bar depending on trade direction This is my understanding of the system

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Here is the next two trades... Attached Image (click to enlarge) I have the wrong price in the text...should be 1.5157 For the 2nd trade, since I was not in profit after the close of the entry bar, I would have stayed in until I either hit my s/l or a bar closed in profot...that is my adjusted rule My othe radjusted rule is that if a s/l is over "x" pips, I automatically default to "x" pips for the stop and not the bottom of the bar....most of the time is is around 20-25 pips. Also, the bar next to the 2nd set-up in this chart may have been a entry as well which would have resulted in a loss...I did not check the 1M bars for confirmation on this

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Your explanation is correct and your chart is correct. Abnormalone's chart was also correct. He had broken it down to 1M, to see the details of the movement of the 30M bar.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
On my chart the price broke the low of preceding bar. then moved above the close of preceding for a long entry. Same thing your saying, just the other direction for a long trade instead of a short trade.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
I guess on your chart I see bar #1 having a lower low then bar#2

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Bar number 1 had a lower low then the previous bar, but it did not come back over the close on the same bar....is that why you used bar #2 as your entry bar? My understanding is that all this had to happen on the same bar

--- 帖子 #121 ---
He was showing a 1M chart, not a 30M chart. The blue line, at the bottom, represented the low of the previous 30 1M bars, which would be the same as the low of the previous 30M bar.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
My chart is a 1 minute bar and the whole chart represent one 30 minute bar. I'm just showing what happens in side the 30 minute bar. My results for the little bit of backing testing I have done seem to show that the worst trades are when the close is only a few pips away from the high or low and you end up with a stop that is to close to your entry as shown on my chart. I also noticed that I seemed to get better results if I only made trades in the direction of the general trend.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
How do you measure the general trend?

--- 帖子 #124 ---
I had a 89 SMA on the 30 min chart that I just happened to notice was moving up on the one min chart and for the last day that I tested. The long trades that day were a lot better than the short but I would not consider this enough of a test to make a conclusion from.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Hey Dan, just double-checking your totals and I wrote in red the ones that don't seem correct. Can you tell me if I am misunderstanding?

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Will the Stop loss and Take profit which are set to 0 in your EA over ride the Stop loss and Take profit as described in the rules?

--- 帖子 #127 ---
gotcha

--- 帖子 #128 ---
It may be good and needs to be tested.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
I wonder if it would be good to set a limit for close to high/low of say maybe 8 pips or so, or if it is closer then that it has to penetrate the high/low by "x" pips. One of these two might help from getting false entried when low/high is very near to the close.

Any back tests for the first 5 hours of NY session? I'm wondering how many bars under 15 pips were calculated when the back testing was done. Those were bound to be losers. Looks like EU and GBP are worth trading. Paris

Hey TF...I do not believe these backtested results at all my friend. Whether it is the EA or the backtesting. I personally did a manual backtest for about 4 days beginning in January and checked my results with the backtested results....completely different. I took every obvious one trade during the timeframe specified, left out questionable wins that were not obvious, added questionable losses that were not obvious and then subtracted 150 pips from my profits incase I missed some losses. I also left out more questionable wins and still came up with over + 400 pips in profit on eurusd M30 chart. Using the same lot size as the backtester, none of the wins came up identical However, I did use a 20 pip s/l instead of the default s/l, and left the trade open until I could close in profit or hit my s/l I have also found this works on most all tf's from M30 to D1 and so I am looking at trading all TF's for those 4 pairs. ...but once again, I think the results are much better then what your backtesting shows, unless it is your EA that is off a bit. Hope that this is helpful.... P.S. I just did a visual to the backtested results to looking at teh chart above it and blatantly many trades were missed by the backtesting and so I have confirmed just how inaccuarte those backtested results are......

--- 帖子 #133 ---
In the backtest, your 20 pip s/l did not function and what is pip buffer?

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Damonl; I have a new updated EA coming soon. I did not code in for SL and TP usage since it is not part of the strat. I agree that MT4 EA backtesting is not very accurate but it's a start to validate the strats validity. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Damonl; We need to keep the testing criteria the same to get consistent results. If you incorporate a fixed SL then your results will be different. I think for now let's test the EA and make sure it follows the strat. to a "T" and then we can start to optimize if needed. What say you? TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #136 ---
I am with you...The problem I see is that all these 5-7 pip stop losses will keep nickel and diming your account, and indeed that is what is happening...but one step at a time. What is the "pip buffer" in your EA?

--- 帖子 #137 ---
One other thing I was thinking about is this... If close&lt;5 pips from high/low, then piercing bar must go above high/low by 15 pips before it is considered a valid entry If close is between 5-10 pips then 10 pips of piercing If close is 10 - 15 pips then 5 pips of piercing If close &gt; 15 then 1 pip of piercing is enough.... Just something to think about as this moves forward

--- 帖子 #138 ---
For a more conservative entry you could simply wait until the second bar is completed too. Then, only enter if the close of the second bar is above the close of the first bar. Consider a LONG setup: There is the first bar. Then the second bar breaks below the low of the first bar. The original rules of the system say that you should enter (go long) as soon as price is 1 pip above the close of the first bar. You might even set a stop/limit entry order to do this. Some people expressed concerns that the second bar could change a lot through its development. By the time the second bar has completed, it might not look like a very promising setup anymore. Here is an alternative entry that would be more conservative: Simply wait until the second bar is completed too. Then, only enter if the close of the second bar is above the close of the first bar. That way you know you still have a bullish situation. I haven't done any testing with this. I suspect it would have fewer trades, but a higher win percentage or a higher average winning trade. It's hard to say if it will be more profitable in the long run without any testing, but this might be useful for those of you who trade with a daily profit goal. This way you can select higher-probability setups.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
I think we need to determine the profitability of the system as it is, before we talk about changes. If we don't know how it performs, as written, there is no way to know if a change is an improvement.

--- 帖子 #140 ---
COMPLETELY AGREE!!!

--- 帖子 #141 ---
I am not sure it performs very well actually as it is, but it has good features....TF did a backtest for the last 3 mohths, but the prevous 6 months prior to that saw a tremendous amount of loss, such that the last 3 months didn't even make up for a portion of that.. GbpUsd gives us an equity curve that is almost all downhill, but as TF said, let's make sure we get the entries right and then go from there... But that was all back testing and I already think that is not accurate...... Let's see what we can do with it.....

--- 帖子 #142 ---
@ Damonl; Based on the strat. rules we should use a one pip buffer to enter all trades, thus the pipBuffer external EA option. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #143 ---
When I do back test all I see on the Results page are Buy side trades, no sell side. I checked and made sure EA was set for Long &amp; Short.

--- 帖子 #144 ---
A few changes to the EA to more closely reflect the strat. rules: Added the following changes: *Only Trade between 7:00 and 20:00GMT *Previous Bar Range Needs to be at Least 15 pips *Fixed SL and TP Function *Trade Status and Previous Bar High, Low Range Comment Added Note: Please test and let me know if the EA is trading per strat. rules. Once the EA is trading per strat. rule then we can start to optimize. TimeFreedom

I'm looking at your new version on a visual backtest. It's opening trades properly and begins at the right time. It stops trading one hour too soon (1900). It isn't closing trades on the close of the bar. It closes them on the next bar. Thought you'd like to know.

I watched the videos quite a few times now. When he is explaining "why this works" he is talking about the traders psychology causing the PA. If we follow this psychology to place our trades, we should only trade setups where the setup bars close close to the low or high (low for longs + high for shorts). After all the psychological reasoning is a "continuation" of the setup bar, which then reverses and traders close positions. At one point in the video he is showing a long trade after a long setup bar. Even though the close is still close to the low of that bar, so it could be considered still as a long setup bar. Any comments?

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Picture perfect cable entry outside of the trading time. Trade was upto 32 positive and ended with +12.2.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Are you adding the spread to the stop loss Dan? Martin claims high accuracy and profitable but i don't see that in your back testing. You have more losers than winners. This can't be right? Paris

--- 帖子 #151 ---
I simply backtested by using the bid prices and added the spread later for simplicity. In my backtests, I did not check for the minimum range of 15 pips, I did not add a 1 pip buffer and I didnt care if the setup bar was an up or down bar. I simply looked if there was a new low/high with a break of the previous close and took the close price of the setup bar and calculated the difference up to where a SL would have been triggered or up to where the entry bars close would have been. In my interpretion of the method, we should look for setups like in the image I just posted above.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Bill; I will fix the stop trading time to 20:00 in the next EA update. As far as the EA closing at the open of the next bar I don't really see a big difference. What I mean is we have to wait for the current bar to close before closing the trade and the best way to determine bar close is to use next bar open. Again I am not a coder by trade and continue to learn. If any coders out there can help with this subject matter it will be greatly appreciate it. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Man that is some complicated code. Nice of you to share. Advice: Always buy on the Bid and sell on the Ask... these are MT4 constants. That will properly handle spreads . The way you have it now (even though well thought out) is not correct.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
I'm not a coder either but I believe it is impossible to close a trade at the closing tick because you can't determine the close till after it happens. If you fix the stop trade time at 20:00 people on different platforms won't be able to adjust if their broker is in a different time zone. I use FXDD and I believe 9:00 - 22:00 is a match the same hours of trading the system calls for.

Your opinion is very much appreciated. I will make the Bid and Ask fix as you recommended. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #162 ---
TimeFreedom, I'm sorry, I should have been more specific. It didn't seem to be closing on the open of the next bar. It was closing on the next bar at a price I couldn't see any pattern to. Let me try the new one. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
TimeFreedom, Here is what I've determined, so far. I visually tested it on EUR/USD. It has a 2 pip spread. If you are exiting the trade on the Open of the next bar, it is working properly and closing at the correct price. It is not opening orders at the correct price. On Buy Stops- It is adding 2 extra pips to the correct Buy Stop price. On Sell Stops, it is subtracting 2 extra pips from the correct Sell Stop price. Example- If C of previous bar was 1.3700, it sets a buy stop on the next bar at 1.3705. It should be set at 1.3703 If it sets a Sell Stop in that instance, it sets it at 1.3697. It should set it at 1.3699. I hope this helps. EDIT- The 2 extra pips I alluded to above, is also present on the GBP/USD test. It has a spread of 4 pips.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Yes....this is something I noticed as well. Same with the exit at the wrong price now that i go back and look again....

--- 帖子 #165 ---
I believe the exit is correct. He's exiting on the open of the next bar rather than the close of the trade bar. The ones I've tracked were at the proper price.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
I haven't looked carefully at the EA, but from your comments the exits have to be correct... How could you exit at the close (the last tick) of the trade bar? By its very definition, you don't know the bar is closed until you get the first tick that belongs to the next bar. So if the EA works the way you guys say not only it is correct, but it is the only possible way to do it.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Here is another update to the EA: *Fixed the EA to use pipBuffer instead of minStopLevel *Fixed the EA to Allow multiple pairs to be forward tested. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Trade made on EUR/USD @16:40 FXDD time Sold 1 pip below previous close Closed at the closing price plus spread which was 1 pip better than the open price of new bar. Just did a Buy on GBP/USD at 1 pip plus spread above previous close Looks like its right on the money

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Awesome....I did something a little different in that I only traded in the direction of what I call my MACD Momentum Builder trades. Yes....I wold have missed out on some trades, but I feel better going at least what I deem as momentum. I am then also looking at going into a lower TF chart to follow a fast momentum there to see when i should exit, although this is just preliminary at the moment. On M30 today I was 4 for 4 today with eurusd, 3 for 3 on usdjpy and 2 for 2 on gbpusd....i really don't like trading usdchf in this was and so I passed. On H1 today I was 2 for 2 on eurusd. A pretty good day. I will start forward testing the EA on a demo account now as well

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Here is a discrepancy using your latest version: The red vertical line is the end of the 1/05/09 13:00 bar. The blue horizontal line is the LOW of the 13:00 bar. 1. The 1st arrow shows the new 13:30 bar going below the LOW of the 13:00 bar during its first minute. 2. The 2nd arrow shows price exceeding the CLOSE of the 13:00 bar. This occurred during the 13:31 bar. The trade should have been entered at this time. The SL should have been set at 1.4476. 3. The 3rd arrow (13:35) should have hit the SL. At the bottom of the chart is the EA's record during this time. It shows a winning trade. It seems to have ignored the activity prior to 13:36.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Hi Damoni, Could you elaborate on how your MACD Momentum Builder works? 11 wins out of 11 trades is very impressive! Bob

--- 帖子 #172 ---
This EA looks very interesting. I am testing this on FxPro which has fractional pips and seeing a lot of OrderSend 130 error messages in the journal. Would it be possible to make the code fractional pips aware?

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Hi, Wouldn't it be more useful if the chart shows "Previous Bar OpenClose Range" instead of "Previous bar HiLo range"? Since OpenClose is more important..if it is &gt;15 pips, HiLo pip difference wouldn't matter so much. I am not good at programming ,...If I understood correctly, process flow is more or less (I use BUY example): 1) Calculate Open-Close for bar(1) 2) (may be) compare diff CloseBar(1) &amp; Openbar(0) within xx pips to proceed 3) wait for Bar(0) low falls below Bar(1) low to activate pending buy or just go into ready-to-order mode 4) send BUY order if price is 1 pip above CloseBar(1) 5) Close order when Bar(0) changes into Bar(1) at new tick of Period() For #5, why dont use the template: bool New_Bar=false; if(New_Time!=Time[0]) { New_Time=Time[0]; New_Bar=true; } Once new bar arrives, then close order. Therefore, no need to use time to activate close order. Some of the above points may be repetition of what being discussed. This is just a rough idea of the whole process. I notice fine tuning/correction (e.g Ask, Bid usage) already incorporated. Cheers,

Hi Bill..I'm back Please take a look chart below...Point A when OP...Point B when TP hit (Sorry,i didn't follow the rules.Just TP 10)...please correct me if i'm wrong.thanks

You forgot the chart

--- 帖子 #176 ---
sorry...

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Bill; Please make sure you are using Beta04 which takes account of the external pipsBuffer and not minStopLevel which is adding 3 pip buffer to the trades instead of 1 pip per the rules. FYI, I noticed that using a 3 pipsBuffer gives me better results. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #178 ---
I can't understand what you did. At Point A, you say "top+1 pip" You should have been looking for it to go below the Bottom - 1 pip.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
I'm almost certain that I was using 4. I'll do it again, when time permits, and let you know if I get the same results.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
Sayembara; The rules clearly state to determine the bar's HiLo range and not OpenClose range. For #5 please take a look at the EA and make changes you see fit and note your changes in the EA. Also make sure to change the EA version when making changes. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Sorry again...It should say " Buy sTOP1pip+spread at close of bar A". i mean "Buy Stop at close of bar A+1+spread"...

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Okay- Evidently I was using a version other than Beta04. This time I found something else. There were 2 trades executed during the 13:30 bar. There was a 13 pip loser and a 23 pip winner. This would have been accurate IF you have it programmed for reentry.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
I believe that was correct if you used a 10 pip TP.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Sorry again...It should say " Buy sTOP1pip+spread at close of bar A". i mean "Buy Stop at close of bar A+1+spread"...

Hey Bob...I will try it is harder to explain that it is to show except on this forum it will be just as hard to show. Im' using the Max Macd in Color with settings of 12,26,9 and changing colors 0 &amp;1 to match my background color as I am not using them at the moment. Attached File(s) MACD_inColor.ex4 4 KB | 386 downloads Please follow my instruction in the chart below Attached Image (click to enlarge) The 2nd indicator down is the MACD. You can see that I have written some text there. First written you will see "lower low from last time MACD was red". This means that momentum us down and ii am looking for short trades only. 2nd you will see "lower high from last time MACD was blue:. This means that we are still looking for short trades. 3rd you will see "lower low" from the last time MACD was red. This means that we are still looking for short trades. 4th you will see "higher high" from last time MACD was blue. After the bar the closed higher then a the last highest blue bar we start looking for up trades only. 5th you will see "higher low" which means that we are still looking for up trades. 6th you will see "lower high", so there is again no change as we are still looking for up trades because that was the last breakout direction. Unitl we get a lower low we will continue to look for long trades..... Hope this is is helpful

Okay...I haveput version 4 on a demo account with back bay just because I still have an open demo account with them. I have placed the ea on eurusd, gbpusd, jpyusd, gold and silver, all on both the 1H and M30 TF's I am expecting gold and silver to have too big of spreads the way the EA is right now, but I wanted to just get a visual on what to do with a larger spread.

no doubt a bad night for straight trading this thing. I think straught trading this without a filter will have diassasterous results. I did not trade it because I want to see if we can get the EA to do what we want. I will go over my filtered results in a minute.

So far, here are the results following my filtered version. USDJPY 2 for 2 off M32 charts - notice that both the M30 adh H1 were showing tradeing direction to be long according to my filter. For eurusd we would have had 1 win and 2 losses on the M30 For eurusd H1 we would have had 1 win and 1 loss For eurusd our one win on the M30 was opposite the direction of the H1 at the moment it was taken, and the win would have to have been left open until s/l was hit or a bar closed in profit...as it turned out it woul dhave been the next bar. For GBPUSD M30 we would have had 4 wins and 0 losses, but we would have had to make sure that once again, that we kept the trades open until they hit out s/l or closed in profit. GBPUSD H1 would have given us 1 win today and both the M30 and H1 we giving filters for trading in the same direction. It is also safe to say that I did not check as to the original s/l rule as I think that rule is flawed as well, but if it goes that far, that is something that can be optimaized later because if we are making solid and good trades, the s/l should be able to be figured out. We'll see what happens the rest of today..... Here is the rest of today eurusd M30 a small win

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Closed 3 more trades for -18 pips. This raw system does need some refinements/filters. Carl

--- 帖子 #197 ---
agreed.... s/l needs to be adjusted and I believe that I have a good filter explained back a few posts, but we wanted to wait and see how it played out before adding filters. Accoding to what looks like will close, according to the way I see this needs to be traded we would have taken 1 more win on eurusd M30 aNd M15 and depending on our s/l rules, the gbpusd trade may have eiter closed in a loss or would no quite of hit our s/l and would still be open for this bar.....depends on the optimized rules.... The way the s/l is now, it just nickel and dimes you to death

--- 帖子 #198 ---
I was also going to ask this same question as I am seeing many setups where the total bar is considerably more than 15 pips but the OC are somewhat less. Even so, the trade is moving as predicted. Also, this chap is not very good at explaining his setup, he explains the setup bar, then the O of the entry bar, the confirmation, the exit and then starts mentioning very briefly the entry point.

I've tested this system with two different EAs that I believe to be properly programmed. Over the last year, each pair looses around 5,000 pips. I do not believe it is a profitable method. I consider it another system that looked good at first blush and didn't pan out. I personally, don't spend time trying to make a system work with filters and indicators, that isn't sound to begin with. I think the time is better spent working on a system that shows more potential. If anyone wants to keep at it, feel free and I wish you success.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Does that include manually trading this system?

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Google that. You can go directly to his website and download the videos to watch over, and over, and over... or not. Carl

--- 帖子 #203 ---
I agree to an extent, but I think adding one filter and one indicator with some adjusted s/l's is really not taking this thing too far, and from waht I have shown over the past 2 days is pretty good you have to admit. remember taht I told you originally that it would not work, I am glad you have validated my original conclusion...now I am saying that I have something that looks promising..maybe, with a little effort, that will become self eveident to you as well. And beyond this filter and adjusting s/l's, i to am not going to go any farther, but to not test a hypothesis will ultimately keep us right where we are at with our trading.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Judging from past history, I think it will lose money if it's manually traded or traded with an EA.

Very good of you guys to lay the cards down. The quest continues.

--- 帖子 #207 ---
The system looks good as I see it. Here's what I think needs work: This seems like a bull/bear trap type system. Those systems work best after long candles. So instead of setting the high/low minimum to 15 pips, make it open/close range of 100 pips. Or something larger than normal for that chart. Bull/Bear traps are counter-trend systems. They are not looking for a trend reversal, they are looking for a small retracement. That being said, I suggest looking for few pips, no more than 10 because this is against the trend. What is the overall trend? Determining the strength of the trend also helps best when trying to gauge how strong the retracements are going to be.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
This sounds like the infamous TRO technique, except that Avery uses the 1 hr TF instead on 30m TF. And if I remember, for it to be successful, you need very low spreads for it to be profitable. And still then, it's about 70% wins vs losses. Odds are not too bad.... Part of the issue is trading against the 1 hr candle which is verbotten in the TRO system. Not saying this is bad, but maybe a different tf is in order here.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
I added my comments at the end of your statements below..... This seems like a bull/bear trap type system. Those systems work best after long candles. So instead of setting the high/low minimum to 15 pips, make it open/close range of 100 pips. Or something larger than normal for that chart. Interesting idea...probably a good one, but maybe we can be successfull without waiting for those long candles Bull/Bear traps are counter-trend systems. They are not looking for a trend reversal, they are looking for a small retracement. That being said, I suggest looking for few pips, no more than 10 because this is against the trend. I'm not sure about this, because i am see the s/l for gbpusd to be 40-45 pips with eurusd and usdjpy to be about 30-35 pips....i'd rather end up with 2 pips while still going after the big runs, but this as well could be optimized in an EA What is the overall trend? Determining the strength of the trend also helps best when trying to gauge how strong the retracements are going to be. Exactly......I have put up a good filter a few pages back that I see determines trade direction momentum. yesterday gave os 11 0f 11 wins, and today min of 3 losses, max of 4, but the 4th is questionable because it would not have hit either the 40 -45 pip stop loss for gbpusd and is still currently open. we would have won around 10 if my recolection is correct, using the MACD filter..... I also sugest not just closing the trade at the close of the first bar if it is not in profit...either let it hit our s/l or close in a bar in profit. Maybe after the close of the 1st bar, the s.l can be adjusted or something, but that can happen later if we want it to.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
The gbpusd trade I eluded to earlier that maybe would have hit our s/l....here is the results... If we would have had a s/l of 40-45 pips for gbpusd (after all it is the hourly and M30 charts), the s/l would not have been hit and after the close of the recent bar would have ended in profit...... another win the way that I see it Yesterday 11 for 11, today 10 for 14 We also curretnly have a long usdjpy open from the M30 chart set to close if in profit at 16:30 GMT

In your testing, did you let it take every single trade signal, 24 hours a day, or did you restrict the trading hours? It can make a big difference. I've programmed this system. I didn't use MT4, I just wrote my own raw program because I don't trust MT4. I'm working with a little more than 3 months of 1-min data for the EUR/USD. I am still working on my program, working out some bugs...but so far, it seems to be profitable during certain market sessions. Here are some results from 1-minute data for EUR/USD going back to 10/06/2008. They might not be correct, but here's what I got so far. GMT 10:00 to 11:00 ---&gt; -13 pips 11:00 to 12:00 ---&gt; 123 pips 12:00 to 13:00 ---&gt; 1 pip 13:00 to 14:00 ---&gt; 371 pips 14:00 to 15:00 ---&gt; 119 pips 15:00 to 16:00 ---&gt; -90 pips As you can see, if you cut out the first and last hour in this group... 11:00 to 15:00 ---&gt; 614 pips This means, for example, if you restrict the trading time to just between 13:00 and 14:00 (GMT), it produced 491 pips over the past 3-months. Again, these results might not be correct because I'm still working on my program. I think it's very important to use restricted trading hours when you do back testing. When I finally start using a system, I will be trading it manually. I will not be using an automatic trading program. Therefore, I must only look at the back testing results for the hours that I can be at the computer to trade. It doesn't make sense to look at historical results for trades that I would never have a chance to make because I wouldn't be at the computer at those times. Maybe someone could help me check if my program is working properly. I could select some random trades that my program generates and you could check them against you manual back testing.

Yes...the last 3 months were quite profitable but don't nearly make up for the amount of money you would have lost the 6 months prior to that...I think the guy that threw this together just saw this in the short term, got excited and sent it out...but in reality, prior to that it really bit the big one.....

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Update....using the filter, just closed a nice gbpusd trade making our win/loss ratio today of 11 for 15 If we can't find a way to make an 11 for 11 and an 11 for 15 profitable, then we really should just drop this and move on.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
just took two more small wins from eurusd...one from H1 and the other from M30. Really too small for me, but yoiu never know when the big one will appear.... Using the filter gives us 13 for 17 today...not too bad....

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Damn, I guess I should get some more data.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
I noticed while doing visual back test that if you wait for a new bar to advance in the same direction as setup bar then move back and retest the close of set bar then make your trade in same direction as setup bar you have a better chance of a successful trade. This would then be trading with the current trend instead of against it. Can not come up with a set of rules that have a high % of winner yet, but I'm still working on it.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
In theory this would make sense...have to see what you can come up with..... We just had 2 more eurusd trades trigger...1 for a win and 1 for a loss so that puts us at 14 for 18 today I believe

--- 帖子 #218 ---
TimeFreedom, First of all, thanks for all your work and the great EAs. I am testing your 04 with TP5, yet some trades close at higher pips. Can you explain? Can I run your EA on a same platform with another EA? Do I have to change the magic # for each pair I trade? Thanks again Regards, Ploto2

--- 帖子 #219 ---
You might not want to put it on a live account.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
just closed a usdjpy trade and a gbpusd trade both in profit using the filter... That puts us 16 for 20 for the day so far. That is probably it for the day since it is 20:00 GMT by my book. So, using the filter 11 for 11 yesterday and 16 for 20 for today...somthing I think that is worth persuing..... What do you think Time Freedom? Care to keep going with it?

--- 帖子 #221 ---
i got an e-mail a few days ago showing the slingshot now i have read most of the forum and i think you guys missed one of the moves. when you have a set up bar for a long position you have a bar thats heading in a short direction with a minimum of 15 pip top to bottom. the entry bar as i understand it continues in a short direction untill its below the lowest low of the setup. and then turns around and gos in a long direction. i think thats were it got its name slingshot it pulls back FIRST then makes a move

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Let me encourage you guys to keep up the great development work! Damonl's results in particular point to further experimentation.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
Here is the last update for the M30 SlingShot strategy just the way the author intended it to trade with no filters/indicators, etc... *Fixed. EA was not modifying SL with multiple pairs. *Added option to turn off Alerts. @Damonl Yes, I would like to continue and backtest your ideas. Please post your rules as clear as possible for me and I will take a shot at it. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #224 ---
i ran V4.0 last night in visual mode just to watch the trades and it does trade alot but i dont think its trading by his rules. i saw hundreds of trades it missed and ones it got into that just did not fit the method. maybe my setting are wrong

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Thank you bill for your research. I accept your conclusion. I had reached the same. I won't be supporting the concept either. A good trader needs to accept when the trade is wrong. Thanks for testing it.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Pluto2; My answer's are in blue within your questions. TimeFreedom

--- 帖子 #227 ---
I tested it also, using my own EA, with trading hours, without trading hours, for the last 3 months, for one year and for 3 years. The 3 month test was the only profitable test in all six majors. That tells me that the method is not robust and is some what a curve fitted method.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
i found my self looking through charts and there are hundreds of winning bars. and before i was thinking EA i traded for the last few days and was not in losing territory. until i attached the EA. no worry's just paper. i think it needs work but its not bad as far as the premise.

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Basically, this is what I am seeing 1. We need to trade with the trend. I find that watching momentum with the MACD is a good way to determine trend. An expanation of this can be found in Post 187 On This Page 2. S/l needs to be adjustable as it would differ for every pair 3. it would need to keep the trade open until it hit the s/l or closed in profit on any bar. I think this just about does it. Beyond this we would probably need to see good testing results to persue this any farther, but the trading the last few days has been good 11 of 11 and 16 of 20 is way better then anyone could expect. Let me know if you have any questions about the MACD filter, as that will probably be the hardest part to program. BTW...I have made more the 250% in since Dec. 1st and have open valued at over 200% from my daily strategy, which is kind of like the one we used before with all the rules that worked well, but which I thought was too much work. This is much eaisier to follow once you get it, and soon I may be taking the rules down and pursuing other things with it...I'll be glad to add you to the signals list when I get to that point...on me This is more of a scalper strategy, which i am kind of against at the moment, but i really like this for some reason....enter trades not based on indicatros....maybe it can be something special.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
i'm running v5 right now in visual and its. i can tell you its not following the system. i'm not modifying anything just placing and testing. and watching the action and seeing were its entering and exiting. i think its just thinking if it passes one highest hi or lowest low it just entering and thats not how this system works. if the close of the setup chart is low then it has to go low first then come back and get intered. maybe i'm not setting it up right

--- 帖子 #231 ---
damonl - Thank you and many others for the insight into this system. I found this thread over the weekend and just finished reading/studying all the comments. I would like to know if I understand your trend filter - my comments are numbered and correspond to the numbers in the attachment. 1 = higher high trend = up 2 = higher low trend = continue up 3 = lower high trend = continue up 4 = lower low trend = down 5 = higher high trend = up 6 = higher low trend = continue up 7 = lower high trend = continue up 8 = lower low trend = down 9 = lower high trend = continue down 10 = lower low trend = continue down 11 = higher high trend = up 12 = higher low trend = continue up In each case we are comparing one set of blue bars to the immediate past group of blue bars or comparing one set of red bars to the immediate past group of red bars. The trend changes, for example, on the close of the specific bar which is higher than the highest bar in the immediate past group of blue bars. In my definition, a "group" can be a single bar, for example, red changing to blue for one bar before changing back to red. Thank you - Gary

--- 帖子 #232 ---
any of you have a tested EA that works out of the box thats free

--- 帖子 #233 ---
No, and I must have tested hundreds. I have not found one EA that consistently works, period, commercial or free.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
TimeFreedom, Will my SL and TP over ride the EA's TP ans SL? Or, which ever will occur first will activate? Thank you. Regards Pluto2

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Ok, so you had 16 of 20 wins, but what was the net pips? what was the net on 11 of 11 day?

--- 帖子 #236 ---
16/20 wins = 75% win rate. That's pretty good. What's your Reward:Risk?

--- 帖子 #237 ---
I have tested and tested and it’s not entering right. and I have an idea for exit instead of exiting on close you can set a really short trailing stop maybe 2-5 pips just to chase any trend a little farther. I know its not apart of the system but when you can automate so much you can change the rules like you can split the trade in 2. One with normal s/l and one that has a really short trailing like 5 pips that triggers when your 10 pips into profit. That way if you bar runs up your pips and then retreats before close you might get a little more profit and if the trade does not work you might break even or even win just a few pips. But I have been looking at the strategy for a little bit and when I do it with out EA I’m in the winning area. just ideas that can be tried because we are using automation another idea is can we calculate the average size of bar over last 3 months and come to a better more dynamic size than just 15 pips

--- 帖子 #238 ---
I've tested this as well and I think it has potential. This does not need additional indicators and/or filters, it needs more exit options. Exiting at the close severely limits the profit potential. I agree with the previous poster about adding a trailing stop, along with the user option of NOT closing the trade at the close, just letting it ride. Possibly a breakeven stop as well for testing purposes. The most important part of any trading strategy is the exit, not the entry.

--- 帖子 #239 ---
have you looked at the entry vs the ones on youtube that this is based on?

--- 帖子 #240 ---
No, I haven't. However, it still needs better exit options. The entry is really not that important; one can enter at random and with an intelligent exit strategy make profits. 95% of traders are losing money, and 95% of traders are focused on the entries.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
I have used the slinngshot system succesfully and the trades which are 98% good are those that are confirmd by the upper H1 time level. The ea smokes keep up the good work, I know didly about coding but I hope my observation helps in the development.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
but according to the author it based on a fear that other traders are causing lets say the set up bar is trending short and traders are thinking its going to continue trending short then the entry bar starts trending short too but some hickup happens and it starts going long and traders everywere are closing up because they dont want to be the loser. that signals our entry into the long position while fear is driving away the other traders we are capitalizing on it. so in this case entry is about what others are thinking. after that some of you might think i'm just EVIL

--- 帖子 #243 ---
A+

16 for 20 and 11 for 11 gave me a net positive pips. . Your question is easily testable if you took the time to test it yourself, then you wouldn't need to ask me this question.... I am not your free ride!

--- 帖子 #245 ---
HMMM...i don't really know...my s/l is set, but my take profit is at the close of a bar in profit...could be 1 pip, could be 200 pips which happend on friday after non-farm payroll..... 1 step at a time...I rarely set t/p's anymore...rather adjust s/l's. I would guess that average is 15-20 pips though i would guess to the high side of that...... I still think that as we go here we will find a way to go to some lower5 TF's and time the exits even better then relying on the close of a bor in profit

--- 帖子 #246 ---
no need to get mean about it.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
I ask because I rate systems using the following formula: (Reward / Risk) * Percent win * 100. So, if this system has reward/risk of 2/1 and a percent win of 75% that's a success score of 150. Average system here is somewhere around 50-60 success score. So I think you can understand my excitement.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
didn't mean to sound mean

--- 帖子 #249 ---
yeah...i hear you...i wish i could give you a better answer, but to be honest i don't know...i think that the entry is very good. today was a very hard market to trade...yesterday was easier and had we switched to lower tf we could have taken some nice trades......1st thing for me is get the win ratio in our favor and i think that may be done although manually backtesting this would be impossible so the long term is still unknown.... we'll see what happens....

EurUsd 2 for 2 +11 pips and +8 pips GbpUsd 1 for 1 +18 pips UsdJpy 2 for 2 +6 pip and +16 pips So...using the fulter we are 5 for 5 for 59 pips Personally this method still scares me because it is a scapling method which I am not into as I think it just deletes most people's accounts, but at times this trade can run hundreds of pips......Hopefully an alternative exit can be found as we get into this more that will let our pips run and still cut our losses... we'll see what happens I guess....I'm going back to bed for a few more hours

--- 帖子 #253 ---
I agree there is a better way to exit this trade trailing stop or something. I heard of a ratcheting trailing stop never used it before. It might help with zeroing in on more pips

--- 帖子 #254 ---
I tested this system at 08:30 EST and caught 60 pips on a demo. But, my other systems all indicated a sell on the E/U and even fundies were a no brainer. This system only confirmed what everything else was doing. But can it stand alone? Only time will tell. Until then the most important aspect of it is its Stop Loss. Gotta have it.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
I have never heard about this before and would like to know about it. What can you tell us?

--- 帖子 #256 ---
I set my TP to equal the SL. I add the spread +1 pip so that if I hit 50% strike rate, I am still profitable (barely, but I can still stake claim to "proftable" trades...LOL). Once the price has broken the Hi or Lo, I set a pending order 1 pip above or below the close of the setup bar just like the original rule. I simply let the trade run to either SL or TP. This becomes more of a "set and forget" setup, that frees me from my computer...and also frees me from anxiety and stress as I let the market do its thing. Sorry, I haven't compiled a win/loss record because my trading has been very spotty due to having to shovel tons of snow...this coupled with subzero frigid temperatures here in Wisconsin. Let's just say trading this way I am "profitable". LOL Bob

--- 帖子 #257 ---
EurUsd 1 for 1 +69 pips GbpUsd 0 for 2 -45 and -45 pips One trade is still open here and is up 50 pips at the moment UsdJpy 3 for 3 +11 and +12 and +9 pips This gives us 9 for 11 for 70 pips with one nice trade open at the moment for GbpUsd I have been using 45 pip s/l for gbpusd, 35 pip s/l for eurusd and 25 pip s/l for usdjpy for the record.... I must also say this...both losses for the GbpUsd went against two things that I have not mentioned yet. 1. If you are looking for a long trade and price of the current bar breaks first above the high of the previous bar, trade would be off. This protects us in large whipsaw markets. 2. for the 30 Min bar, the pending trade closes 5 Min before the close of the bar and 10 Min before the close of the H1 bar rather than waiting for the next bar to open.... Once again, we will take losses so maybe none of these other 2 things are necessary, but I wanted to put them on the table for something to think about.... Got to head out for a while and will get the rest of the days trades in when I get back....adios

Hi, I just found this thread. Some days ago I got this system like billbs and make some quick EA. I tested it on Alpari data from 06.2004 to 11.2008 original rules without MM - fixed lots. Results are mixed 1. EURUSD it's profitable but look at 2007 - almost all year down 2. GBPUSD - most profitable, but 2008 flat 3.USDCHF - in the beginning profitable later losses 4. USDJPY - dissaster ! Of course that was only first look, there could be some problem with backtest on 30 min, modeling quality etc. maybe this system has some potential but it need some research (eg. exits: tp, time exit not necessary on next bar, trailing stop, trade with trend, partial close etc.) . One should be careful especially on USDJPY. It was only quick test for me, I don't trade this system. I sent this results and some description to Martin at Forex-auto-Scalper( I was curious especially about very bad results on usdjpy) and got very "professional" answer :"EA is working on EURUSD only". Auto-scalper yes, but not my EA. Guys on forex-auto-scalper don't read or don't understand what they read Good Luck and Regards, Andrew

--- 帖子 #260 ---
I think its and algorithm that starts with a larger distance than normal and over time closes the gap until it closes the trade. And I think it basis its ratcheting effect on the time frame given so if you were to give it 1 day it would ratchet faster than if you gave it 1 week or 1 month. I also heard that it calculates the starting distance by figuring out the hi/low’s of many bars before it. I’m not sure but I think it sets it self higher than them. I would get it for you but my old computer had it on it and HD crashed. So I don’t have it. i never messed with it just somthing i was looking at a year ago. but i was really new to the idea of forex then.

This should get us through the rest of today's trades EruUsd 3 for 3 +5,+12, and 0 Pips GbpUsd 3 for 3 +54,+9 and 0 pips UsdJpy 4 for 4 +19, 0, +13 and +2 pips Totals for the day using the filter and additional rules: 19 for 21 for 184 pips Another nice day of trading with a very high win% of 90%

--- 帖子 #262 ---
instead of an EA thats going to do the work why don't we try just an alarm method and EA the alerts to signal set up and then one for trigger. keep the human figure in the mix. my eyes hurt staring at the screen

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Hopefully Time Freedom is working on an EA, but maybe he is not. I have not heard from him in a while. Personally I hate day trading and refuse to waste my time trading anything except end of day trading, and that works out well for me.....2 to 3 hours a night and I am done until the next night..pretty successful with it as well, I would never be able to make thoughs types of profits day trading. We'll see, I am still looking at getting an EA done.....

--- 帖子 #264 ---
dmjservices made reference to a ratcheting stop loss. I did a little research and came up with the following indicator which is a bit old but interesting. I've included a document describing how it works - the document does not specifically mention how to set the various parameters but I messed around a bit and found it wasn't to hard to configure to rachet up the stop loss to preserve some nice profits. Because its an indicator, you have to take the info from the screen and manually enter the SL but that's simple enough to do. I monitor my trades on both the M30 and M1 charts for any particular pair. I put this indi on the M1 for a while and actually used it for a couple of trades which finished for nice little profits. It will take more experimentation to test it out. If anyone has experience with this and knows if its a waste of time, please let us know. I'll post the results from my efforts to let you know the good, the bad and the ugly! Parameter settings I'm using on the M1 charts are all default except Atr_Length = 30

Hi Damonl, Brutal winter weather forecast for tonight -20 degrees below zero farenheit here in Prairie du Chien. What city are you located? BTW, please keep posting your trading results...it really gives me the confidence to move forward with your filter. My simple trading alternative is working out well, but prevents me from making larger profits because most SL's are relatively small. No matter, I'd rather have a higher winning % than a lower % with a greater amount of pips. I simply ramp up a larger lot size and end up with more profits this way. Bob

--- 帖子 #268 ---
you have and ideas why?

Here is the first trade update for today.... EurUsd 5 for 5 +52, +18, +18, +12, +80 with one very promising looking trade that is currently 66 pips in profit GbpUsd 5 for 5 +8, +4, +14, +17, +58 UsdJpy 1 for 2 +8, -25 That gives us 11 of 12 so far for 264 pips....shapping up to be a very nice day again indeed

Okay, here are the rest of the trades that would have been entered for today along with the final tallies EurUsd 1 for 1 +111 pips GbpUsd 2 for 2 +52 pips and +3 pips UsdJpy 2 for 2 + 43 pips and + 7 pips Total Results for today: 17 for 18 giving us a win % of 94%. Total pips today would have been 480 pips. Definietly this is a system worth pursuing with the filters and making into an EA. Anyone out there willing to give it a shot? I have not heard from Time Freedom and so do not know if he is doing anything more with it or not. Enjoy!

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Those are outstanding results. What time do you start trading? The EA should be programmed to trade your rules exactly! Carol

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Yes....I think it will happen, the resutls this week have been very good. I think I may start a new thread with the revised rules so as people don't have to week through what really won't help them.

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Good idea. If Time Freedom isn't available, perhaps RR would do the EA.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
what additional rules and filters did you add- i have read but dont want to go thru 19 pages again either. have you talked to ronald the programmer in this thread- im sure he can build it. i would like to see it

--- 帖子 #277 ---
RR has been around, so maybe he is thinking about it...I have talked with one other person as well, but it will not be free...I was qouted $150, but have not heard from him now for a few days. Don't know if I want to spend the money on something for testing...

Lol, I guess it's hard to lurk. I'm watching this thread guys. Don't worry. I'll put together an EA once I have an idea of what type of system this is. It's either trending or counter-trending as I see it.

PM me with very clear instructions for entries, exits, filter rules and Stop Loss and Take Profit and enter multiple times on a single bar, ect, and I will modifiy mine to do it.

Ronald, I tried to backtest the EA from 01-2008 to 12-2008 on the E/U and not one trade was made. Is there some setting we need to change in order to backtest? Thanks, Superdevo

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Ronald makes all of his ea where you have to change lot size or MM by default but RR I did that and didn't take a trade either. what gives buddy?

--- 帖子 #288 ---
I have been doing it manually too with great success but a working ea would be great to free the eyes and fingers from the computer. I noticed that the trades made on the H1 with confirmation on the 30M are more accurate with a 98% return rate. I can write what I see but cannot even program a remote.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Hey RR....I don't do everything the same as it is described on page one, but some things are the same. I will still move forward witha new thread, since we deteremined that the original Slingshot method was flawed. I will get to that soon.....

All fixed. Problems with the TradingTimes function.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Many thanks for the mods.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
I wouldn't be so quick to judge. Guys, run a visual backtest in the strategy tester. I see plenty of wicks which could potentially be captured with this system. Set TP to 5 pips, don't take trades with SL greater than 5 pips, etc.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
Thanks Ronald......it works now. Now I just gotta figure out what MM to use, so the account balance doesn't look so much like one long valley!!!! Everybody needs some peaks now and then!! Superdevo

Why would I enter a trade if my target was only 5 pips? It's like going to work a job for $2.00/hour. c ya

--- 帖子 #295 ---
You can leave the EA alone. And let it trade itself. Then distribute across pairs, and that $2.00/hr turns into $20.00. Remember, I aim for high accuracy, not high pips. You know why? Higher accuracy means higher risk.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Hello Ronald, What's the 'pip buffer' for? And isn't range a bit large as default? Or is that the daily range? TP of 5 and SL of 5? serious? thx, todd

Bro....I am up over 30,000 pips since Dec 1st with another 15,000 positive pips in my account....I am not going to waste my time with 5 pips.... But if that is what you are into, then I say go for it.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
damonl are you using the EA only during specific hours? Thanks and congrats on 30,000 freaking pips! Impressive to say the least. todd

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Not bad at all =D. I'm up a little under 10,000 net pips as of January 1 (took a month off in December, and I REGRET IT!!!). And that's not from splitting lots. Does your pip count include split lots? Anyway, while you do things manually, I spread out my pip collection across 34 different EAs, and 20 different pairs. The vast majority of my entries are managed by EA, the exits can be managed by EA, but most are managed by me. If I can sleep at night knowing that the EA can consistently grab 5 pips with 1:1 R:R or better all night, then I would be stupid to pass that up. Because to me, that is free pips. 5 pips/trade * 10 trades/day with 2 losers, comes out to net 30 pips per day per pair, tack on 20 pairs...and I'm sure you can see where I'm going with this. [EDIT]: Split lot example: I take 1 lot and close 0.5 every 5 pips. I count that as a 10 pip gain. Some people count that as a 15 pip gain. (10 pips from one 0.5 lot and 5 pips from one 0.5 lot)

the pip buffer is the +1 to whatever rule. I made that adjustable just in case someone wanted something.

I am really not using any EA, I basically do end of day stuff on the daily chart. So far any EA that has been made for this system has underperformed considerably.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
That is good for you RR. You have put your talents as a programmer to good use. However, what you are doing is not duplicatable unless everyone were to buy your 34 EA's. So I think that is great for you my friend.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
For the record to everyone else reading through this exchange, I am not selling any of those 34 EAs. You can find them spread throughout ForexFactory in their appropriate threads where they belong. Source code included, and completely free of charge, just like the one in this thread. If I do catch anyone trying to sell any of my EAs, I will make sure to obliterate your advertising campaign and bring down the website. You have all been warned .

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Dude, I don't know what all your EA's are, but if they are that good, then I'd like to take a look at them. Personally I have seen 3 EA's from systmss that were introduced here on FF that I bought and later returned because they really wern't any good. Probably not yours, but if you think that people don't come in FF and take ideas and EA's and sell them, then I would definitely think again. Basically i just trade daily charts on 24 different pairs using 18 different entry strategies......Thanks for your EA's then, I will take a look.

Ronald the TP and SL don't seem to be working properly on the latest EA. I set the TP and SL to 5 each and right now I have a short opened on the GBP/USD showing NO TP and a 9 pip SL short E/J no TP and 9 pip SL long E/G no TP and a 20 pip SL Any ideas? edit: Ok my fault on the TP issues. Forgot to change from false to true. But the SL issues I can't figure out. I do have SL set to true. thx, todd

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Did you enable the Override of the SL? If you want to put in your own SL you need to enable the override.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
I think that it is s/l + spread, but 5 profit and 5 loss is a major disaster...already tested it for eurusd,,,,but with 20 pip on euggbp...it must be something else then

--- 帖子 #308 ---
I'm not so naive to think it doesn't happen. It's already happened twice, and I had fun sending bots to continuously click on their ads to raise their advertising bills, and having some of my end users put up the free version of the EA wherever the thief tried to advertise. I'm prepared to counter those attempts. As for how you trade, it's similar to mine in the sense that you use several different entry strategies to try and build into a trend across several pairs. The execution of course is different. Who knows, maybe I can just use that as my manual system and develop another EA to handle the rest...yeah, yeah, I know, wishful thinking =D

--- 帖子 #309 ---
How to enable override?

It's in the properties change from false to true. todd

Hi Ron, trying this out, the buy max trades per bar seem to work, the sell doesn't. Looks like the remaining trades logic is under the signals only section. Love your work! if(SignalsOnly) { if (SignalMail) SendMail("[Signal Alert]", "[" + Symbol() + "] " + DoubleToStr(Bid, Digits) + "Sell Signal"); if (Alerts) Alert("[" + Symbol() + "] " + DoubleToStr(Bid, Digits) + "Sell Signal"); if (PlaySounds) PlaySound("alert.wav"); RemainingTrades--; }

RR Thank you for your effort, its appreciated. I've been trading this system 3 ways - as originally proposed by Martin Alexander, set and forget approach by Bobcat2 and the very nice effort by domonl with his Max MACD trend filter. The results using the original system has been unsuccessful. The other two have provided a positive return. Using the macd trend filter as suggested by damonl (which I've also applied now to Bobcat2 approach has been most successful. Is it possible to add the macd trend filter to your ea with the option of using it or not? I believe this entry filter has significantly increased my wining percentage - the exit strategy remains an open discussion. My winning percentage is excellent (although not as good as damonl); I'm exiting manually based on price action and using the TP/SL as backup if I have to leave my computer for a bit. My trades which have closed using the TP or SL have provided positive pips although not as profitable as when I manually close them - either way its been a winner over the several days I've been trying the modified system. For those who might ask, I've been using the SL's suggested by damonl in an earlier post. I am currently working on ideas on exit strategies other than the two I've mentioned above and will report results when I believe I've executed enough trades to be statistically signifiacnt. Thanks again - Gary

--- 帖子 #315 ---
Ordersend... Is your lot size 0? Pavatar: I'm implementing the ideas from damonl's new thread. I'm having a little trouble with the logic involved. If you can help me come up with some code to determine previous red segments and blue segments, that would be great.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Lot size is set to 0.1

--- 帖子 #317 ---
RR, can you look at past macd bars and once it goes from negative to positive you have one segment completed. Then you store the highest/lowest value of that segment..

--- 帖子 #318 ---
Sounds simple in theory, right? I still need to figure out highs/lows in those specific ranges, and that's where it starts to get tricky.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
RR, please send me the copy of your .set file if you don't mind, cheers!

--- 帖子 #320 ---
yep sure does.. I am a programmer too, just don't have a lot of time to do coding on forex. I would think you would need a nested If statement and if you can read each macd bar value from current to past...Then once the value goes from + to - or vice versa you could tell the cutoff of the segments and can store the high/lows in each segment, but yes it is easier to say than code... I also know how painful it is getting something to work right

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Set file is already applied in there, except for the lot size.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Many many thanks!!!

--- 帖子 #323 ---
RR - I have been working on some code as well for the trend filter - not as talented as you however. I'll keep working at it and send it along for your comments if I can help solve the puzzle. Thanks - Gary

Hi Ron, First, big thanks to Damonl for his creativity and hard work and also you Ron; we should call you Ubiquitous Ron because you are everywhere on this forum helping out!! Trading can be a very dark cloud over your head and it's your generosty that helps lift that. I like you equation Ron and it would be nice to have all the available results on one post--updated, if possible to better assess the data. I had a look at the results based on the stop for cable (45) from Damonl's new thread and applied your equation. I got 1/3 * .90 * 100 = 30 The system wins a lot but the R:R is heavily against us based on the results. Hopefully, I am wrong! Thanks for your hard work. Gray.

These settings from RR's EA seem to work using IBFX data from 10/1/2008 for the EU 1hr... I just ran it on GU and it did not work for it. It doesn't appear to work for the 30m either for EU, but it is still above $10,000 on the tester so the settings could be played with. I focused on the 1hr because I got it to work. I also ran it for the entire year on EU 1hr and it was not good in the beginning... Now I only have 1minute data bact to october and 5m back to March... I figure with the bigger stop 5m should be good, but you never know. Anyway, somebody can see if these same settings work on their broker. I had to change the start times, used a 40pip stop and once trade was +30 I set it to +1, and used a 20pip buffer. The buffer prevented a lot of trades as well. Also, the ea is set to close next bar, but a lot of times the very next candle would've been positive whereas the ea closed at negative, so this could be changed. extern bool EachTickMode = True; extern bool UseTradingTimes = True; extern int HourStart = 7; extern int HourEnd = 14; extern double Lots = 1; extern bool MoneyManagement = False; extern int Risk = 0; extern int Slippage = 3; extern bool UseStopLoss = True; extern bool OverRideStopLoss = True; extern int StopLoss = 40; extern bool UseTakeProfit = False; extern bool OverRideTakeProfit = False; extern int TakeProfit = 100; extern bool UseTrailingStop = False; extern int TrailingStop = 50; extern bool MoveStopOnce = True; extern int MoveStopWhenPrice = 30; extern int MoveStopTo = 1; extern string Remark2 = ""; extern string Remark3 = "== SlingShot Settings =="; extern int MinRange = 150; extern int PipBuffer = 20; extern int MaxTradesPerBar = 1;

--- 帖子 #337 ---
i had made a candle pattern indy, thought id mod it to show slingshot entries it will alert, should be very useful for this strategy the alert is a thump sound, in editor, you can copy n past the loud alert in if u like

--- 帖子 #338 ---
hell, not to get off subject, thought id post the tools to make trading this easier the following tools use money management the risk% is calculated per sl lot size of all trades are diferent this is default for ibfx mini if using a diferent broker, note this risk 2 for ibfx mini = 2% risk 0.2 on most other brokers = 2% il post a few screen shots of the setup process the first time this expert is ever loaded on a new platform, you must activate 2 objects these objects then set a global variable, theyl never need activating again regardless if ea is reset or whatever

--- 帖子 #339 ---
heres the files tester-tools is the ea trendchaser companion is a blank indicator so that the chart stays clean the 2 scripts are designed to trade the lines, using the lines for sl also if the ea is on, and you move a line the sl will be updated if you dont wish to move the sl, the ea is not needed, the scripts will trade the lines regardless if the ea is present to place a pending order, use the red and blue, buy/sell labels is the companion a pending buy is opened at red line, with sl at blue line opposite for sells theres also tp lines if you need them

--- 帖子 #340 ---
i dont think automating this strategy is a good ideah, from what i see in history, you need to cherry pick these trades just 1-2 trades a day is enough to get rich in his first video, the example bars looked good, the setup bar was long, and closed near the bottom i believe that pattern will have a high win rate one rule i see that could do good, is if close is atleast under 20% away, in the setup bar, this gives good rr ratio

--- 帖子 #341 ---
How do we attach it to the chart? To the expert folder or indicator? I tried expert folder but can't do anything.. EDIT: Ok.. got it.. should attach it to indicator folder.. Very useful indeed.. Thank you very much!!

Hey Trend Chaser...does your "trade the lines" EA only manage certain trades or will it manage all open trades for that pair?

--- 帖子 #343 ---
all trades

Hi RR Could you please change your Slingshot EA to trade only once per opened bar as very often after order closed with a profit it opens another positions which end up with a loss. Thanks a lot.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Hi, Thanks for sharing your ideas. Can you post for me please your EA. my EA is not working. please help me. Thanks, Pad quote=thatwasme;2472546]PM me with very clear instructions for entries, exits, filter rules and Stop Loss and Take Profit and enter multiple times on a single bar, ect, and I will modifiy mine to do it. Mine meets all of the requirements of the original method exactly, so it should be easier to modify. Also I have Automatic money management built into mine and it adjusts automatically for a 5 or 4 digit broker. Please be clear and precise.[/quote]

Hi Solofx. Can you just clarify what you amended manually to get it working please. I noticed that RR kindly posted his code at 1.58 on the 16th and your comment followed a little later in the day. I haven't seen an updated version from Ronald so your findings would be apprciated. Thanks in advance. Nigel TQO23

Wrote an EA and running it against EURUSD... Running it for the last two day..Not great results as of now... Verified the trades by checking the M1 chart..saw that most of the trades were in profit at some time but closed at a loss in the end(at the end of the 30min bar)... introduced a profit management function to my EA...Moving the stop loss to open price once 10pips in profit is seen.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Hi Ronald. Firstly I admire the work you are doing writing, and then sharing your EA's. However it does make it very hard to raise concerns or challenge when you are putting so much effort in. Have been testing your Sligshot EA having been running manually for a couple of weeks, with some success. Today the EA placed 2 losing trades where the trading system rules did not appear to have been followed. Reference to the attached chart:- Trade 1 should have entered 1 pip above the 12:00 setup exit level, ie 88.94 instead of 89.07. This is a classic case where the trade price dropped below the bottom of the setup bar and then came back up above the setup bar exit price. Stop should have been around 88.88 ie 1 pip below the bottom price of the 12:00 setup bar. Trade close should have been at the exit price of the 12:30 bar, around 89.00 although your code may manage the exit price differently. Trade 2 was another buy which should not have triggered as it should have been looking for a sell after the previous buy trade. However this trade just did not follow the rules for entry and as such should not have triggered. It may well be that I'm missing some here and without the knowledge of how your code works I could be misinterpreting what you want to happen. However if I simply apply the rules as detailed in the info provided by Martin Alexander the EA just doesn't appear to be following them. Appreciate your comments. Regards Nigel TQO23

--- 帖子 #350 ---
The EA was designed to follow these rules: Long entry- Bar goes below the Low of previous bar. Then Goes above the Close of the previous bar. Enter 1pip + spread above the Close of previous bar. SL- 1 pip below Low of current bar. Exit at close of current bar. Short entry- Bar goes above the High of previous bar. Then Goes below the Close of the previous bar. Enter 1pip below the Close of previous bar. SL- 1 pip + spread above the High of current bar. Exit at close of current bar. I ran a quick visual backtest and everything looks ok. I'll leave it running for awhile and I'll go over the trades in the chart after my nap. (32 hrs with no sleep kills =D)

--- 帖子 #351 ---
Ron, here's something that happens if you came across it. When the bar closes at the very top or bottom and the next bar opens, it gets in the trade right away, because its right there and hits the high or low and it goes negative fast and hits the stop. With the EA on is there anything to prevent that. even if you do it manually that always produces more stoploss. Can anything be done about it.

--- 帖子 #352 ---
I agree that is a problem. How does the original system creator solve it?

--- 帖子 #353 ---
i would create a buffer maybe 1-10 pips just so it had to go and come back

--- 帖子 #354 ---
What does martin alexander say?

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Trying to send a message to him, but I still didn't get anything on it yet.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Ron why don't you add in the EA that: When Bar is closing at top or bottom,next bar open the EA will add a Safety Buffer of 15 pips to go higher,and then it will put the sell stop at preivious bar close and 15 pips to go lower and then it will put a buy stop at preivious bar closed.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
I can, but what's the basis behind that? I firmly believe that this system is a counter-trend system, adding a pip buffer defeats that purpose. Personally, I'd probably just ignore those type of bars altogether because they are usually signs of a reversal

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Hi Ronald. OK it looks like your rules follow what Martin says but there are a couple of criteria that must apply before a trade is entered. 1. Setup bar MUST have a minimum difference of 15 pips between high and low to be a valid setup bar. 2. Open of next bar MUST BE BELOW close of the setup bar (for a long trade) , even 1 pip I think you look for the minimum 15 pips but do you look for the opening to be below the close of the previous bar (in a long trade)? It doesn't appear so on Trade 1 of the chart I posted a couple of messages ago? I've looked at the video again and at the examples he walks through but every one shows that the market moves a few pips (in some cases significantly) before it reverses and crosses the previous setup bar close, which triggers the trade. With regard to opening trades at the top/bottom of the setup bar I agree that a buffer needs to be inserted here but it's a "suck it and see" situation regarding what this buffer should be. How about an "opening trade buffer" parameter that users could input based on their attitude to risk and possibly market volatility? Welcome thoughts on this from more experienced forex traders than myself. Keep up the great work. Nigel TQO23

--- 帖子 #359 ---
TQO23, With slingshot system, we dont alternate trades...just take which every trade is triggered.fyi.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Thanks for clarifying BRK15BRK15. So this is not the Martin Alexander slingshot system then? If it is in any way based on the MA system then what are the rules that allowed it to open the trade number 2 as per my chart below? I think it will partly be removed if you can resolve the issue of getting in a trade when the close is at the top/bottom of a bar. I'll keep watching the thread with interest. Regards Nigel TQO23

--- 帖子 #361 ---
I have not noticed trades opened based on the situation you described above. But logically, these kinds of trade hit the stop very fast!! I think evern Martin will avoid such kind of setups. The currency is bound to move up and down few pips and will for sure cause the trade to hit stoploss. Thanks for bringing up the situation...I will include in my EA, a code to ignore such kind of situations. Losing few trades(not a big deal). other way to circumvent this situation is to wait for few minutes like say five and let the M30 bar have enough history. But again you will lose few pips here as you waited. on the other hand the code will start having too many checks...no longer a KISS system.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Hi BRK15BRK15. Long post, please bear with me. Firstly can you clarify something for me please re the owner of this EA. Is it you or Ronald Raygun or has it be co-written? OK moving on and forgive for repeating something here but I'm desperately trying to understand how this EA has been coded. On the 4th Feb @ 07:10 forum time, I asked if Ronalds EA followed the entry rules as per Martin Alexander's original email outlining the system. Ron responded:- The EA was designed to follow these rules: Long entry- Bar goes below the Low of previous bar. Then Goes above the Close of the previous bar. Enter 1pip + spread above the Close of previous bar. SL- 1 pip below Low of current bar. Exit at close of current bar. Short entry- Bar goes above the High of previous bar. Then Goes below the Close of the previous bar. Enter 1pip below the Close of previous bar. SL- 1 pip + spread above the High of current bar. Exit at close of current bar. The rules look perfect but I responded to say that there should be 2 conditions before a trade is opened (see post 5th feb @ 04:48):- 1. Setup bar MUST have a minimum difference of 15 pips between high and low to be a valid setup bar. 2. Open of next bar MUST BE BELOW close of the setup bar (for a long trade) , even 1 pip. I haven't received a reply yet but I think that Ron is working on the problem where trades are opened when the closing price is at the very top or bottom of the bar. This morning I have another example of a losing trade, SELL, where the entry rules do not appear to have been followed (see chart). In this example the GBPUSD trade entered at 1.4626, closed at 1.4630, loss of 4 pips. If the rules had been followed the trade would have entered at 1.4635, closed at 1.4626, a profit of 9 pips. I actually had another example but screwed up on saving the screenshot!! Can you just enlighten me please how this should work for entry and can you repost the latest version of your EA if it is different to Ronalds' please. I've just printed off the code for Ron's EA, don't know what I'm looking for but intend to have a coffee and see if I can make anything of it, got to start somewhere!! Many thanks. Nigel TQO23 By the way thanks for responding re alternate trades, I confused 2 trading systems!!

--- 帖子 #363 ---
You are using Ronald's EA I think.... I have my own, I have coded by myself like I said in the previous post. u r welcome.....

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Oh boy you guys are picky =P This part below: 2. Open of next bar MUST BE BELOW close of the setup bar (for a long trade) , even 1 pip. Was not mentioned in the rules I put up for the EA. Do you really expect the EA to follow that if I didn't put up a new version yet? The trade entry was off by 9 pips. Are you absolutely sure that wasn't caused by the spread?

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Thanks Ronald. Certainly wasn't being picky. I'm new to this and as stated before just trying to understand how these EA's get coded. If it wasn't in your code then my question has been answered. Good point about the spread, might well have been a factor. Another lesson learnt! Thanks Nigel

--- 帖子 #366 ---
I am not conversant with writing an EA but I have back tested and forward tested (in real time) Slingshot and I have found these things that may contribute to making the system very profitable. 1. Add an additional entry qualification. Enter when the signal bar close is in the upper/lower 25% of the bar. This keeps you out of those pesky losers. 2. Set the Stoploss level at the current bar Low that exists at the time the trade is entered. 3. Associate a maximum number of pips with the Stoploss. I am using 12 on the EURUSD. 4. Exit the trade at the Open of the new bar as it occurs at its first tick. Maybe these can help. Regards, KeithN.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Like many, I received the email about Martin Alexander's Slingshot system and watched his video. I didn't try it out as I'm concentrating on other trading strategies. However, by curious chance, today I was also watching a video from a Mark Jones about another product (completely separate, and not related to forex). And there's the thing. In each, both presenters introduced themselves as 1) Martin Alexander, and 2) Mark Jones. But it was the same person - same voice inflections, tone, manner. Highly professional, but clearly the same person. So Martin Alexander/Mark Jones: are you simply a voice actor, or are you a genuine forex trader? If you lie to us about your name, why should we trust your product?

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Because it's free...you're not losing anything by trying his methods out

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Just because it's free doesn't make it okay for (if he is) a fake to peddle their wares to the unsuspecting. I get a regular stream of emails from Martin Alexander, each claiming this latest system is the holy grail. I think it's reasonable if he's at least open and up front about what his actual name is!

--- 帖子 #370 ---
He's taking time to come up with his own systems (I think) and then giving most of them away for free. Even if most of them don't work, what have you got to lose except a demo account? He's not forcing you to buy anything to use his products. In the end it's up to the user to decide whether his systems are legit or not

--- 帖子 #371 ---
do you trade every EA live that comes your way. no i doubt it well i watched his video and he said people were asking for a mechanical method of trading. and he said heres what i got. i havent payed anything yet for any of his EAs and you always follow rules about your EAs too. for me i have to understand how its trading and i demo till i double my account before i ever use an EA.

I'm not lol I was just saying that people seem to be hating on the guy's system because he's a "vendor" like you said, without giving his system a fair chance. I know this doesn't apply to everyone

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Has this system bit the dust?

--- 帖子 #375 ---
Probably. The concept is sound, but when people here that there is another thread with "Version 2" of the system out there, naturally they think that Version 1 is obsolete.

--- 帖子 #376 ---
I am not sure the view expressed in posts 364 and 365 is correct, namely that the price of the trade bar has to "open" above or below the high or low of the setup bar. The original trading logic says that price has to move (but not open) above or below the high or low of the setup bar, and then rebound (slingshot) back to the close of the previous bar to enter a trade. If one is trading intra-day, the close of the setup bar is likely to be the same or very close to the open of the next bar. Comments and clarifications welcome. Steve

--- 帖子 #377 ---
I don't understand why this thread died, as well as its subsequent branch offs?! Martin Alexander is now sending e-mails for subscription of some type in order to get his latest EA shortcut order system... NOW he wants to get paid, but NOT by me!!

--- 帖子 #378 ---
It died because it's no good. The branch off died because it tried to put lipstick on a pig and wound up with a pig.

WOW, thank you very much for your quick response Bill! I did however notice that Damon has been MIA since April, think that has anything to do with it in general?

--- 帖子 #380 ---
I don't know where he is.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
In my mind, there is ambiguity. Some of the posted results (in the Slope Trend EA thread) seemed fruitful, others unsuccessful. Damon reported he was taking a vacation, not that he was abandoning the effort because it wasn't working. Gary (Pavatar) hasn't been around either. Steve

Dear Friends, I read the slingshot thread and I've come across and idea I want to share. I want someone to back test if it is possible. I’ve been trading for about six months, I think it is better said I’m learning. I’ve seen quite a few indicators and read on price action. I find myself to be inexperienced to follow a discretionary method. So I’m trying to device a trade method that works on price movement (not indicators). I want help of forum members for the same to make the get more precise rules for the system. I'm writing blue print, we can make fine tune it to make it more robust. TF: Daily It happens on rare occasions that previous day’s close = Today’s Low / Today’s High. Mostly, price moves on both sides of the previous day's close. a. Trend continuation: If there is an uptrend, Price moves dips below today’s close and then it continues the trend and if it is downtrend vice versa. b. Trend reversal: In case of reversal after an uptrend, price first moves in upward direction (continues trend for few pips) and then it falls down to close as bearish bar. The close is well below previous day’s close. I was thinking how to make a strategy to capture the big move on at least on one side of previous day's close the either side of the previous day’s closing price, as the closing price happens to be an important price point. I had one plan, 1. If price moves 20 pips on one side of the PC (Previous day’s close) then place entry order on the other side of the previous day’s close at close +20 points. 2. When entry point is triggered, scale out ½ position size on 30 points and BE rest of the position and put a trailing stop loss. 3. To cover Negative up-bars / Positive down-bars, if price reaches the High / Low, trigger entry at 20 points i.e. High + 20 - Buy order/ Low – 20 points – Sell order. Negative up-bar is a bar which makes HH (compared to previous bar, but closes below previous bar’s close) classic e.g is Pin bar and positive down bar is vice versa. Buccas13

My appologies go out to BILLBSS for being late. Found this thread by googling it. That pig with the lipstick on is smiling at you. It sounds to me that it is a wild boar. Any ways, I might have a fix for this problem. Simple solution too. If RR is up for 1 more program change let me know. I tried Damon's Singshot 2 without much success.

I really like this method, and just found this EA. Is anyone still trading this with any success?

thanks for the EA. Which TF you tested ? in my view this works well on higher timeframes. may be daily logic is simple. current bar broke the prev bar low but failed to go down and instead reversed and even crossed the prev close. so its a failed breakout or false breakout. we hope to catch the reversal. but with any PA startegy just one signal is not enough. need to check the long tern trend, fibs, trendlines, support/res lines, big round numbers, news etc. on daily timeframe, take this signal and look for some more signals and then trade

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Hi i back tested it with all time frames like 30M, 1H &amp; daily TF. I dint mixed this with any other signal just tested the raw strategy since i too thought it as a good idea, but the results are really bad. But as per the strategy we are just targeting one candle profit not targeting the big trend moves so i think trends &amp; other indicators has nothing to do with current price action since our target with the strategy is one candle movement profit. but i think some more tuning is required like TF or SL or other things. because this works when trend actually reverses. if the price is reversing then i think no need to check weather its Support or resistance because the reversal point itself will act as Support/Resistance thats basic logic of this strategy &amp; i feel no indicator is needed moreover if you look in detail we are trading against the trend because this strategy picks up patterns like Bearish / bullish engulfing which are trend reversal patterns. let me know if any other things you know from your side. regds Muzamil

It looks simple but an efective strategy quote=billbss;2457624]I got this system, free, in an email from a guy named Martin Alexander. You can probably find him by searching for "Martin Alexander" Slingshot. I won't post his link, because I think he's probably a system seller. I've looked it over and made a few trades and it looks good. Pairs- EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/CHF, USD/JPY TF- 30M Trade times - 7:00 GMT - 20:00 GMT In the descriptions below, the "previous bar" must have a H-L range of, at least, 15 pips. Long entry- Bar goes below the Low of previous bar. Then Goes above the Close of the previous bar. Enter 1pip + spread above the Close of previous bar. SL- 1 pip below Low of current bar. Exit at close of current bar. Short entry- Bar goes above the High of previous bar. Then Goes below the Close of the previous bar. Enter 1pip below the Close of previous bar. SL- 1 pip + spread above the High of current bar. Exit at close of current bar.[/quote]

We ran with this for a while. Another step to get us where we are today

--- 帖子 #296 ---
People still trading this system?

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Any update on this system? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Regarding the slingshot strategy, im doing some serious back testing with forex tester 2. I've also recorded back testing vids &amp; uploaded them to my youtube channel under my name Tyrone Archer. I will only trade this on daily, weekly &amp; monthly bars. Results look good through all market conditions. So far every pair I've tested produces profits. Don't get me wrong. There are plenty of losses but on the long run the account is up. If anyone is trading this strategy too, give us look up. Maybe we can improve this strategy between all who trade this.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
regardless Bar A is a red or green candle?

--- 帖子 #300 ---
pic totally different than what happened here. Trade so you get tiny bit of profit even invert. RR. rmember Bars1 must be &gt;15 pips so get it wrong once you lose &gt;16 pips think about that.
