first sorry for my english. I'm a Chinese fund manager &amp; programmer for eight years. i produce an EA, it worked very well since then. today i want to share with you guys who are finding a good way to make some money and make his own way to build a system ...just because i think every one should get a chance to learn knowledge from others who are knowledgable FREE (i don't know if you can understand what i mean,sorry for my english again!) I learn every method by anyway every time now i am appreciate to the people who are selfless to share .and thanks again. so i decide to share with you my friends. but because of some reason ,i cant give EA to you ,but i will give all indicators and all the method to you, you can trade manually. its works well for many years . and i get about 30% profit this year from 1.1 to today. LETS look at the picture, the most important things in my system is about four lines, i will call them white1 white2 yellow1 yellow2,1 is upper and 2 is down line. the key thought of my system is about SAFE ENTRY. its important. safe entry can save you every time, even you are in an wrong trade, safe entry can make you lose less. safe entry is about resistance and support. i will explain the system next post. IF YOU GET ANY QUESTION ,POST HERE WELCOME ANY COMMENTS.Free speech here the second picture is my EA backtest six months result. the EA base on this system not exactly the same. EA add some judges. but only this system is enough to help you make money. notice :i m sorry to ppl,because there is a big mistake in post28,thanks Xjack to propose it. entry in nothing-short: first make sure you are in a notrend by the way i posted, then when price touch white1,here is the entry for short. entry in downtrend-long: first make sure you are in a notrend by the way i posted, then when price touch white2,here is the entry for long. exit in uptrend: if the uptrend become "nothing " you should close your trade exit in downtrend: if the downtrend become "nothing " you should close your trade it 's wrong, and the right version is: entry in notrend-short: first make sure you are in a notrend by the way i posted, then when price touch white1,here is the entry for short. entry in notrend-long: first make sure you are in a notrend by the way i posted, then when price touch white2,here is the entry for long. exit in notrend-long: if the uptrend become "nothing " you should close your trade exit in notrend-short: if the downtrend become "nothing " you should close your trade i m really sry to this mistake,that must make some misunderstandings. and i will give you guys some advice of every day's trading ,or give you the trading plan to help you make some pips. so i suggest you to have a good look at each of my posts here. finally good luck to every one.

in this post i will explain how to use this system. first i classify the market into trend , notrend(forgive this word ,you know what i mean) and "nothing". uptrend: white2&gt;yellow1 white2[0]&gt;white2[1] downtrend: white1&lt;yellow2 white1[0]&lt;white1[1] the picture will show you what is white[0] or white[1] . white arrow is white[0] yellow arrow is white[1]. means white[0] is NOW, white[1] is last candle do you understand??? so this picture is in an uptrend (white2&gt;yellow1 white2[0]&gt;white2[1])

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Hi Please post the indicator and please post the Chart with full details like Time frame and pair name etc Thanks

--- 帖子 #4 ---
1 run in USD/JPY only . very important. if your CAD/JPY spread less than 2.0 you can try CAD/JPY also.but USD/JPY is your mainly currency 2 run in 2h chart only! second important thing ,only run in 2h chart! i will give all indicator to you when i finish the explain.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
so this picture is in downtrend.

--- 帖子 #6 ---
but this picture is in "nothing" nothing is not trend or notrend. remember that. uptrend nothing: white2&gt;yellow1 white2[0]&lt;white2[1] downtrend nothing: white1&lt;yellow2 white1[0]&gt;white1[1] "uptrend nothing" and "downtrend nothing" are all nothing we don't trade in "nothing"

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Bring it

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Sounds good! I am excited to learn more.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
can you guys understand what is trend or "nothing"? next i will tell you what is "notrend" this picture is "notrend" "notrend" is very importand and it's difficult to understand ,but i can explain it in Mathematical method pay attention, "notrend": both white1 and white2 are between yellow1 and yellow2 . AND white1&amp;white2 are in opposition to yellow1&amp;yellow2 look at the second picture, two arrows shoot two direction,up and down.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
so this picture is not "notrend" because both yellow and white is in down direction. this picture is "nothing"

--- 帖子 #11 ---
i think i should give you guys the indicators at first time,,,so you can learn quickly,sorry. i have upload the new tpl ,it can be used

--- 帖子 #12 ---
if you have any problem with trend/notrend/nothing please post me ,i will give you answer i don't know can you understand the three classification

--- 帖子 #13 ---
All clear so far, where do we enter the trade?

--- 帖子 #14 ---
now the most important thing coming! entry in uptrend: first make sure you are in an uptrend by the way i posted, then when price touch white2,here is the entry for long. entry in downtrend: first make sure you are in an downtrend by the way i posted, then when price touch white1,here is the entry for short. tp:20pips(if you are new in this system or you can choose 40pips) sl:30pips exit in uptrend: if the uptrend become "nothing " you should close your trade exit in downtrend: if the downtrend become "nothing " you should close your trade this picture show two entries short and long ,and both of them get tp

--- 帖子 #15 ---
i post it.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
lets look at this picture, first we are in an uptrend, then we make a long in the white arrow. but after 6hours,the candle show that the market are become to "nothing" so we close our trade in "X" we lose little pips. this is the important of safe entry.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
if you guys are learning ,please post me in the thread to give me some power,,, i feel i m playing a offline game now............

--- 帖子 #18 ---
then i will show you how to trade in the notrend.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Hi, Do you mean we have to create a H2 chart in the MT4 for the USDJPY? and the template you've posted doesn't show the white lines.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
1 yes you should make a H2 chart, its easy 2 sorry i ll check it ,

--- 帖子 #21 ---
deleted

--- 帖子 #22 ---
this ex4 can help you to create H2 chart.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
sorry this one doesn't have any indicator attached to it, no lines on chart. one more thing are the arrows plotted by you or is it generated by the system?

--- 帖子 #24 ---
sorry for my mistake, i upload a new tpl, its OK.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
no there is no arrow in your chart, you should find the entry by your mind. its easy if you read my post.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
yeah this is clear, was just confirming. I've created the H2 and used your last template but still showing only yellow, plz see the image..

--- 帖子 #27 ---
It's ok for me, H2 with template, i will test your system liunliun, thanks Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #28 ---
trading in notrend is very same as trend. the main direction is white,if white is up direction then make long vice-versa entry in nothing-short: first make sure you are in a notrend by the way i posted, then when price touch white1,here is the entry for short. entry in downtrend-long: first make sure you are in a notrend by the way i posted, then when price touch white2,here is the entry for long. tp:20pips(if you are new in this system or you can choose 40pips) sl:30pips exit in uptrend: if the uptrend become "nothing " you should close your trade exit in downtrend: if the downtrend become "nothing " you should close your trade look at the first picture the arrow is the signal of short, then you get your 20pips, the second picture is downtrend-long, price touched white2,then makelong you get your 20pips!

--- 帖子 #29 ---
this picture we are in notrend-long,but after four hours we found that white2[0]&lt;white2[1] so we become "nothing" then we close the trade and lose nothing, only 1pips maybe.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
hmmm strange, it couldn't on one platform but tried another broker and it's working now. thanks guys.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
as i said, if you are familiar with this system, you can set the tp with 40pips every trade, but if you are new in this system ,using 20pips is fitable for you.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
the main key is support and resistance, white is S/R and yellow is the index of the direction, so be careful of white turnning direction.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Thanks for the strategy

--- 帖子 #34 ---
this picture shows a good notrend-short trade, get 20pips for you or 40 pips for me easily. why i decided to set take profit to 40pips in this time,because yellow is also a support/resistance, and this entry is far away from the resistance(yellow2) so we can get 40 pips !

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Dear Liunliun, Your indi ( yellow) is vey like Kumo in Ichimoku... when i put ichimpoku in to, it has show as nearly the same ..

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Following your work. Thanks and Regards

--- 帖子 #37 ---
hi datdle i don't have that ,can you share with me? thank you. i think its normal that the indi is like each other which is not used by single candle,how to use is important . do you know what i mean? sry for my english

--- 帖子 #38 ---
thanks .best wishes to you .

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Hi, it looks vary interesting, I will try it out. Do you have .mq4 files for your liun_interval_index.ex4 and liun_interval_trend.ex4 indicators ? Would you share it too ? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
one more important thing i forget. just trade one time in a trend or notrend, what ever win or lose. the first trade you made must be the best entry in this trend or notrend

--- 帖子 #32 ---
can you please mark all possible entries in this picture?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
hi, yes i have it beacause i am the maker ,but i m sry i can't share it ,sorry. and i want to say, indi is not important, anybody who are good at math can copy a indicator in one day. but how to use it is important. i give you the indi,but i also tell you how to use and what to notice,that is important,and that is the experience of my whole career, follow and you can make money or be successful /

--- 帖子 #34 ---
red means win trades yellow arrow means lose trades its easy to find those five entries, but to be honest, i will not entry at the second yellow arrow,that is what i will tell you something else about the system. sorry i check the chart, i found that we don't take long in the first yellow arrow, because the yellow1&amp;yellow2 are not in sync to down direction.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Hey Liun, I'm a bit confused with the candles now and last when I look at your charts so I hope you'd clarify it to make it clear. For example when you say white2[0]&gt;white2[1] does it mean the now candle is bigger than last candle by close or body of candle or the whole candle including whicks? As for entry as per my understanding once the now candle is close and it is bigger than last candle then we wait for price to touch white2 and only then we enter long. Correct? Thanks for your time.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
hi walker,sorry for my english so i can't get you all because of your long sentence................ white2[0]&gt;white2[1] just means the value of indicator ,is none of price business.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
oh ok now it is clear Thank you

--- 帖子 #38 ---
lets see 2017.03.24.16:00 usdjpy h2.here is the picture. the first arrow we are in the notrend-long, so we take long at the first arrow.but after four hours at the "X" we found white2[0]&lt;white2[1] so the market become "nothing" so we close the trade,we lose about 2pips. second arrow we are in the downtrend, because we are far from yellow2 so we get 20pips win trade. third arrow, we are in "nothing"!!!! we don't take any trade. because yellow1 and yellow2 are not in sync.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Can you explain why this is more effective on a 2 hour chart pls.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
h2 less swings and more profitable. 4h is too long

--- 帖子 #41 ---
You just complicated the whole thing, if FIRST yellow is wrong entry because yellow1&amp;yellow2 are not in sync to down direction, Do you think second Yellow entry sync?

--- 帖子 #42 ---
yes In my chart

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Subcribed!

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Is there anyway to backtest this strategy? Liun can you share the results from the time you´ve been trading using this trategy? Thakx

--- 帖子 #45 ---
yes i can。 i have an ea for this system i can show u guys the result

--- 帖子 #61 ---
thx

--- 帖子 #62 ---
really cool strategy!

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Thank you for this strategy! Can anyone recommend a way to run mt4 on a Mac and the right broker to get this working?

--- 帖子 #64 ---
I hope we make some green pips from this strategy Subscribed....

--- 帖子 #65 ---
following but still yet to understand

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Your deposit will be destroyed in long time perspective. Do you know - why? I share it with you, and for FREE too. So. The forex trading with leverage - is the extremally high risky business. And TIME - is the very critical factor in this business. Than more time your deposit presents, than more risk exists that your deposit will be wiped out by giant spyke or "reset candle". So 120% in year is almost nothing here. You need almost 1 year of time to get back your invested money! No chance, bro! Only " short-time invest low money - bite big money and run - reinvest low money etc." logic can help you to make money here, not the other one! I don't tell that something is wrong with your system, but with your moneymanagement - definitely.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
thanks for your advice, but i think you don't know my MM, and i didn't mention it, and i think high profit don't means high position(u know what i mean.). i work for privately offered fund,so the risky is first thing that i think about. thanks

--- 帖子 #68 ---
So that all is not forex about :-) 120% in a year for fund is perfect! Good luck and thank you for your method!

--- 帖子 #69 ---
good luck to you too my friend

--- 帖子 #70 ---
yes you can . you can manually test the usdjpy from 1.1 to now.and you can see lots of pips.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
thank you Liun, its look good. may i can use it for small time frame like 5-15min? or 1min? Thanks

--- 帖子 #72 ---
Here , you can see some Support/resistance are nearly the same...

--- 帖子 #73 ---
I dont have a H2 time fame option on my demo platform ( XM Forex). Can someone please tell me if there is a reliable indicator to get an H2 time frame? Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
KUNGFU OR TRADING?

--- 帖子 #75 ---
follow to try....

--- 帖子 #76 ---
yes my friend ,you can have a try, but i suggest you don't do that,because in my long career i don't think small time is good to trade. if you trade in 5m-1h,you should get small tp and sl.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
ehhhhhhhhhh maybe. but i think there are lots of differents between them.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
i upload the H2 chart in this thread,you can find it. good luck.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
FF changed my name of thread to "chinese kongfu"....interesting.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Interesting strategy, I would love to give it a try. The template works fine for me however I'm not able to convert my chart to 2h. I tried it with Period_Converter_Opt, I've allowed DLL imports and set PeriodMultiplier to 2 on a 1h chart, but I don't get anything...any ideas? Cheers, Diez

--- 帖子 #61 ---
open h1 then add period into h1chart nothing to set。 then open offline chart you can find h2chart good luck

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Can you tell US the hitrate you get with this strategy?

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Hi liunliun, intersting strategy....would you be able to show a trade to take when the next one appears...might help your explanations better..thank you

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Hi liunliun Thanks for this 2h strategy. Question: Is buy 1 and 2 correct?

--- 帖子 #65 ---
From what i recon it's been said to trade only one time during trend.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Thanks for sharing your idea. Do you have the source code (*.mq4) for these indicators? I think setups like this generally can work OK and they seem to have an OK win rate and risk to reward. I've been testing your setup with some modifications for the past few hours on various pairs on H1 with good results so far. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Tgs why dont you trade the h2?

--- 帖子 #68 ---
H2 is available on MT5 but I don't think it's available on MT4 without using some sort of offline indicator. I just find H1 to be easier in general for the amount of chart time I want to spend. I think a system worth learning should be robust to smaller time frames so just use the time frame that you prefer based on your personal preference and see if the system holds up.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
very good answer goddluck to you

--- 帖子 #70 ---
hello tgs are you a chinese？ sry i cant give you code sry isgoodluck

--- 帖子 #71 ---
1h you will have more exit signals not good

--- 帖子 #72 ---
2isnot an entry。

--- 帖子 #73 ---
ok noproblem

--- 帖子 #74 ---
we cannot open google because of the firewall

--- 帖子 #75 ---
I'm not Chinese. Okay but due to the high CPU usage of the indicators, I can no longer continue testing. Here are the results of a slightly modified version of the system so far but again, I'll stop testing now since the indicators can't be fixed without source code. Thanks for the idea anyway. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #86 ---
hi tgs. thanks for your hard working on this method. i must admit my indicators will use lots of cpu performance，that is because its a very old old code i made . also its easy to make an EA for this system to retest, but need to do some change. and last question,,, i can't see the logic of entry in your picture/ good luck to you .

--- 帖子 #87 ---
indicators are not important , THE DEADLY WEAPON IS "SAFE ENTRY" , safe entry is very very very important. i saw the people in Europe , America, they just pay attention to the method (like how it works, for example when a+b+c&gt;x then entry) the thinking of them are very mathematical,i don't mean that is wrong or what, i just want to say philosophy is also very important. Chinese like saying philosophy,so many of them using system without math,they are more subjective. so i think we should using math method but don't forget philosophy.

--- 帖子 #88 ---
summarize your idea as following, my friend: 1 work on H2 Chart only 2 one signal one trade, if in uptrend we buy once at white line2, then we will start again until all white lines bounce up from yellow line 1 (right?) 3 if we trade long, Close[1]&lt;white line2 = close order. for sell vice versa. 4 TP is 20-40 pips depending on how far the trade was taken from yellow line.

--- 帖子 #89 ---
everyday i open this page i can see "xiaomantou小馒头" is viewing now. interesting name.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
1 yes 2 your answer is right, notice: both white1 and white2 go back into yellow. 3 i don't know what do you mean.sry 4 yes , when you open a trade,now yellow become a important support/resistance. i suggest noob(sry,i don't know if its rude to call new people in forex) choose 20pips tp.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Hello friend on your first post you mentioned the EA backtest , So I request you can you please upload the EA also based on your system ? It would be great share and help to peoples.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Seconded

--- 帖子 #93 ---
This needs source code made available or exact info on what each of the 4 lines are so we can replicate it into a more efficient indicator. Otherwise you may as well close this thread because the indicator is not efficient enough to use longterm.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
if you think its useless you can close this thread,but why should I close the thread? thank you.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Liun, Thanks for your good work. Quick question. If White[1] is last candle, Which candle is White 1 [1] ?

--- 帖子 #96 ---
upper white is white1, lower white is white2

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Why was my post deleted...

--- 帖子 #98 ---
thanks！ is this a valid none-trend long signal? White line 1 is above yellow line1

--- 帖子 #99 ---
dear liun can you post your charts that how see sell and buy with stoploss thanx

--- 帖子 #100 ---
no its not.because that time white1 is out of yellow1.

--- 帖子 #101 ---

对啊，它NND，为什么把中文帖子都隐藏了呢？不会中文可以学啊，逃避不是办法，当初都怎么学英文的？ liunliun 兄直接用中文发帖就行，爱看不看。

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Hee, guys! There is no super reason to focus on H2 timeframe. Use H1 or H4. H2 will not make you happy and will not turn any trading system to profitable trading system, including this one. Cause there is no statement that could proof the only H2 is tradable timeframe by this TS.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
to be honest i don't like people who make a conclusion indiscreetly ,but i accept any suggestion,so thank you. i wanna tell you ,you can't judge if a system good or bad without test for a long time, i post this system yesterday, and you said its not profitable today, without any reason...i don't know why. as for H2,i said H1 have too much swings in season or in one day, h4 is too long will ignore many important details. people should sleep ,so we put one day as a trading cycle,so in my experience H2 is the best timeframe for trading.

I'm interested with this system. Learning it from your entry

--- 帖子 #141 ---
1 in the uptrend , white2[0]&gt;white2[1] should be comfired all the time . if not,market are become nothing. 2 white2[0]&gt;white2[1]means now the white2 line is upper than the previous candle's white2 line. clear?

LiunLiun... Patience my friend, I get a sense you are almost to the edge of your nerves and goodwill. You know what you have here and I think several of us realise it and appreciate you for explaining it all. Ignore the morons and push through, I was taught to ignore the bullies and they will lose interest. Regards, Chris.

dont mind the distraction

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Thanks for you sharing this incredible strategy. If you can post here any backtested statement, that would be great to see what's consecutive losses or wins in order to set proper RR. Besides how about to tell us the exact settings of these Bollinger bands. If you have already shared that, sorry for asking again. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Hi Liun, Simple System with not too many indicators. Subscribed and learning. Trying to understand the rules and DO's and Dont's of the trading strategy / system. Lots of green pips to all. Thanks Liun for sharing this strategy.

What i notice in this thread. Someone share their life positive work and ppl start complaining, trying to change it and making all kind of bad comments about it. And you wonder why professional traders dont come here and share their stuff...

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Hi Liun, I have downloaded the template at post no 24 which you have mentioned is the correct template. I noticed that the template has 3 indicators but the chart only shows / indicates only two set of bands. I just seek your clarification if the template is right. Is there a third set of bands that should show on the chart. Thanks and Regards

--- 帖子 #157 ---
yes there is one indi i didn't upload,its like two moving average lines. because its difficult for people,and its useless in manual trade. so i did not upload. these two indi its enough for you to make money, trust me and trust yourself.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
thanks for understanding my friend, good luck to you .

--- 帖子 #159 ---
good luck

--- 帖子 #161 ---
i want to say,if you cannot confirm whether or not a system is profitable, and you can't make EA to retest.then you should put your chart back to six months ago,and take notes with every day's profit,then you can find the answer,don't be lazy.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Subscribed. My thanks and respect for the initiative! Cheers

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Hi Liun, Thanks for your reply. Thanks for your reply. I just wanted to make sure that I do UNDERSTAND your system and indicators loaded on the template. Now my doubts have been cleared. I will test the template and if I need your help , I will revert back to you. Thanks once again. Simple system.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
you are welcome ,green pips to you

--- 帖子 #165 ---
cheers and good luck to you

--- 帖子 #166 ---
I made an indicator to see the setups better. Contains only the trend rules. I reduced the signals, the next signal is allowed, when the liun_interval_index bounce back between the liun_interval_trend lines.

--- 帖子 #167 ---
hi Liunliun, interesting method. subscribed and thanks for sharing your method. Greenpips to you.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
maybe its useful to the people who don't want to read my posts one by one. but one thing you forget, trade once in one trend.good luck to you my friend.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
I have a little question liunliun do you watch the charts all day long ? or do you only look at them at the open of a candle? Is it possible to make an alert when the price hits white 2 or so?

1 i watch the market all the day,that can help me prove experience from market. 2 if you can program its not difficult to do with it.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Thanks bro. but i have some question for these: the "sell signal" seems late?why not sell at #1 and #2? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Hi Beertje, Nice addition to the setups. Is it possible and could you add an popup and sound alert to the indicator that you have coded. That would ensure that we dont miss any signals in case we are not at the terminal at that particular moment of time. Thanks and Regards

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Because the signal come only when the price already tested back the white line.

--- 帖子 #183 ---
OK, but at first please check it. When the signals are ok, I will make it. The "nothing" is not realy clear. It is "nothing" (for example on the upper side), when the white line is above the upper yellow line and goes downward? And what I said, the signal comes in when the white line is "checked".

--- 帖子 #184 ---
reply to Demandsupply and beertje. we don't need to open a trade until the candle close and confirmed. we just pull the trigger when the price touch white line in trend and notrend. as for "nothing" if the market is not trend or notrend,it is nothing. clear? we just trade in trend and notrend.

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Hi Liun, Pls do not mistake me. I am still not very clear with the notrend and nothing. SO MY SIMPLE REQUEST TO YOU IS VERY STRAIGHT... PLS UPLOAD CHARTS OF TRADES ALREADY EXECUTED BY YOU AND HAVE IT DULY MARKED WITH EXAMPLES OF TREND, NOTREND AND NOTHING. PLS MARK THREE TO FOUR CASES OF EACH ON DIFFERENT POSTS, SO THAT WE ARE ABLE TO SEE AND CLEARLY DISTINGUISH as to exactly what you mean and what you see. I feel this would really help all the traders including me. AND ALMOST everyone will have their doubts cleared ONCE for all without any room for any confusion. So when you get sufficient time, before any further doubts are raised by others, if you do this, we would all be obliged and would be able to learn the system and strategy as you visualise and see. THANKS AND REGARDS, YOUR EFFORTS TO SHARE THIS PROFITABLE STRATEGY FOR FREE, IS VERY HIGHLY APPRECIATED.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Just practicing..sell right now on notrend correct? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Hi there, looks like you need to wait for a buy .....but - 4 days before there was a notrend buy, so officially (?) we have to wait for a trend trade.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Hey go5 yes so white determines direction so we need to wait for a buy off white 2 (lower) and whit[2]&gt;white[2] in price?

--- 帖子 #189 ---
I don't quite get your question, see post #2 etc...

--- 帖子 #190 ---
可以问你下面这图青色箭头是notrend up对吗？然后整个蓝色长方形全是nothing?

--- 帖子 #191 ---
hi liun, some questions: 1. is this system only for USDJPY and CADJPY, or other pairs could be also traded? 2. why did you install the same indicator two times? 3. and which settings of these indicators are right one? thanks!

--- 帖子 #192 ---
He already answer your question about indicator . I think another indicator is for his EA and it useless for manual . about other pairs i want to know too. this system is pretty safe but need long time to find entry . If we can use with other pair it would be awesome. sorry for english

--- 帖子 #193 ---
no error entry。 my friend youshould get what is the market now and what is white1 what is white2

--- 帖子 #194 ---
go5 very thanks to you to answer others question,thanks again.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
liunliun, i think evryone is waiting for your live chart trading example. Its 10 pages already but I cant find you show any trade example so expect some poeple to come in and express their doubt soon. Its just easy to point out entry on a historical chart.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
picture is too small, i can't see the arrow

--- 帖子 #197 ---
@ liunliun You said only &gt; and &lt;. how about white 1 [0] = white 1 [1]. and when candle touch white 1 or white 2. but yellow 1 and yellow 2 is not go to same direction or one yellow is flat. what will we do i have a lot of question it will be good if you post chart with explain why in why out. Hope you understand my question. Thank you so much your system is very goooddddd

--- 帖子 #198 ---
i think this system its very very very easy to understand, and its very very very easy to make a EA to retest ,if you can't program, its very very very easy to retest manually. it just spends your ten minutes to retest six months' result,then you can get anything you want. in this system ,there is no HF（High-frequency trading） there is no special MM, there is nothing you can't get by your manually retest. this system is objective system, everyone can get the same result by retest. by the way, i give you the system,and give to the way to use it, that's enough,why should I give you the proving of this system? why should i prove it can make money to you ?if you are a investor, and you have at least one billion,then i will make Chinese tea for you ,and tell anything you want to know ,as for result? its too easy,you can get at least five years' result by me, you can even find my shares profit from some Public fund website about three years ago, then i create my own Private Offering Fund ,although its still not big enough(about 1/100 of the public fund,but this one is belong to me). that's all what i want to say. I think maybe i understand you,although i can make money ,I still learn every day ,I will ask the people how to use his system,but i won't ask how many money do you get,because i can find out whether or not its a good system . I'm just a man who make money by myself,and oneday i want to do some good thing ,that's all, if you are so lazy ,please leave this system.

--- 帖子 #199 ---
liunliun this is confusing, on the first picture(first yellow arrow) you said " no buy because yellow1&amp;yellow2 are not in sync to down direction". but in the second picture (the last red arrow)you said buy is ok, but if you see the yellow1 and 2 are also sloping down same as the first chart. Kindly Please explain. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #200 ---
one trend one trade, have a good look at the real entry in your first picture with first arrow,yellow arrow is entry, red is what? upload: the yellow arrow is not the entry sry, yellow arrow is the point when price touch white. and that time two yellows are not in sync. that is why you don't take a trade in first arrow.

--- 帖子 #201 ---
tell you again. don't put the system on the other pairs, or on the other market.its dangerous. i loss lots of money in my own fund in 2015(fund trade in Chinese shares) the method i trade in forex is base on in shares,but with many differents. so you 'd better trade it in h2 and usdjpy. its safe, i will answer sam69 and kaiout when i get time, i will tell you guys what is the reason to trade usdjpy only.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Liun, Just perused through your thread. You are doing a good job. People do test your patience and running a thread is a tough business. Thanks

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Liunliun.. thanks for sharing the system. Ive been trade using Bolinger Band and Moving Average (BBMA) system and the philosophy were same as yours.. Still waiting for entry BUY once the price touch White2. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #204 ---
ok i understand now not in syncd but the second chart is the same the yellow are not in sync, why its ok to buy on the second chart while no buy on the first chart?

--- 帖子 #205 ---
你好， 看了很多遍，还是很糊，可以用中文解释吗？

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Hi liu, thanks for sharing your system. In the Post 28 above, I think there are some mistakes: entry in nothing -short -&gt; entry in notrend -short entry in downtrend -long -&gt; entry in notrend -long Am I right? And I want to confirm that, we trade only the first signal both in trend and notrend except "nothing", right?

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Another question, you said: But in the Post #10, you said it's also nothing when both yellow and white is in down direction. So, acctually, the nothing have the following 3 definitions: 1. white2&gt;yellow1 white2[0]&lt;white2[1] 2. white1&lt;yellow2 white1[0]&gt;white1[1] 3. when both yellow and white is in down direction Right? Or if it's better to think that if something is not trend and is not notrend, so it is nothing, like below: if (xxx) // trend ... else if (yyy) // notrend ... else // nothing ...

--- 帖子 #208 ---
yes i think there maybe some mistakes in there i have not found. sometimes i use iphone to post,so if i wrong i will fix it. when i have time , i m going to answer you ,now i have something to do , good luck to you .

--- 帖子 #209 ---
OK, looking forward to your answer. Good day.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
god, you are correct, these are two big mistakes will make people misunderstand!!!! but how to edit it,i can't edit the post why. how to let people know that two big mistake.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
You can refer to this in your 1st post, which is where everybody is supposed to start anyway...

--- 帖子 #212 ---
From the samples you posted I noticed that we only trade long in uptrend and only trade short in downtrend, but we trade both long and short in notrend, is that correct?

--- 帖子 #213 ---
Things are really messed up here. Please Liun, post new rules

--- 帖子 #214 ---
hi Is it the entrance to buy?

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Things will clear up when commenting live trades In this case, the white index is already lower than it was at the entry but the candle has not closed yet, so what is the rule here, close now or wait? Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Trend Picture

--- 帖子 #217 ---
NoTrend Picture

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Nothing Pictures ------------------- I stand to be corrected note that the last 2 candles on your chart is what determines Trend, NoTrend and Nothing. which means Nothing can happen any time during Trend and NoTrend trading. lol, enjoy

--- 帖子 #219 ---
Hi Liun, ITs because of so much confusion that I suggested you post trades already executed by you with clear markings so that we can learn the system properly. We basically need the trade that you took, WE DONT NEED THE NUMBER OF LOTS, OR NUMBER OF PIPS THAT YOU PROFIT ETC. Only the basic entry marking the trade in trend, no trend and nothing. So please consider all our request and when you get time please post them so that we do understand the system clearly. THE SYSTEM AS SUCH SEEMS SO SIMPLE AND MANY TRADERS WOULD BENEFIT. Thanks and Regards

--- 帖子 #220 ---
The slope of the yellow was not mentioned for trend, neither was the second yellow. The same thing for "nothing".

--- 帖子 #221 ---
please post chart it will help us a lot .please

--- 帖子 #222 ---
that's right go5,you are smart and thanks a lot to to Tobben's summary ,although there are some mistake about trend. in uptrend and downtrend, we can ignore the direction of yellow.because the yellow is slower than white in usual.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
to kaimot and demand. you persuade me ,i can give the chart to you when i arrive office next time .and i will tell you the reason of usdjpy and h2.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
very good. we trade long in uptrend short in downtrend long in notrend-long(white go to north,yellow go to south) short in notrend-short(white go to south,yellow go to north)

--- 帖子 #225 ---
thanks to you tobben my friend,i have saw your hard working. and i see the problem you have in your post, i had answered them in the new post,you can find the answer ,good night.

--- 帖子 #226 ---
I think the most secure way to trade this method is the Trend method. And applying one trade per yellow crossing.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
thank you and good luck to you ,and i don't know the sentence " and running a thread is a tough business." mean,any one who can tell me?

--- 帖子 #228 ---
no ,notrend is the safest .

--- 帖子 #229 ---
second chart two yellow are in sync my big brother...................they both go to south.

--- 帖子 #230 ---
Oh, thanks

--- 帖子 #232 ---
"running a thread is a tough business." i mean handling the discussion about your trading system... Example: lots of doubts to answer, why this, why that, i don't believe, prove this, prove that etc.........

--- 帖子 #233 ---
yes a few more trade examples would help alot thanks for your nice system again!

--- 帖子 #234 ---
Hi Liun, Please do not misunderstand me for any of my comments. The system and strategy that you have shared seems to be very easy and I am very much interested in learning it properly so that I can be profitable on a long term basis. I am not seeking any get rich soon strategy. So please bear with me for my comments and do not take any comment as negative in any manner. Your efforts and time taken out to explain each and every detail and to clear the doubts of the followers is deeply and highly appreciated by one and all including me. Thanks for all that you are doing for us. Regards

--- 帖子 #235 ---
What's stop loss of of apply Liun?

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Buy entry for NoTrend. Is it correct entry?

--- 帖子 #237 ---
Hi Liun, I try to upload the indicators that you provided but it seems like not working. Can you give the steps to me in order to activate it into my chart? Btw, i'm using Mt4 platform. thanks Richard

--- 帖子 #238 ---
hellow guys i am new in this thread especial thanks to liunliun for share this system with all us i read all thread so i made this picture to explain what i understand so if i am wrong please said me green pips for everybody

--- 帖子 #239 ---
some body know what i need to do to convert the period from H1 to H2 becauses i put the indi "Period_converted_opt" on indicators files of MT4 and them i atach the indi to mi chart USDJPY and nothing happen some body can help me explain me if i am do it something bad please

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Try this.

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Both white lines inside yellow lines and all moving towards same direction is also NOTHING. I guess?

--- 帖子 #242 ---
thanks mate i gonna use it

--- 帖子 #243 ---
hellow tobben yes mate i guess too the same that happen in the non trend option

--- 帖子 #244 ---
You need to click file and click open offline and find usdjpy h2 then open it

--- 帖子 #245 ---
thx so much mate it work perfect

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Thanks for your summary, but you missed a situation of nothing is "when two white lines is runing between yellow1 and yellow2" which mentioned in #Post 10

--- 帖子 #247 ---
ok thanks for your reply. So when the two yellow is in the same direction they are in sync. If the are in opposite direction such as expanding or squeezing, they are not in sync.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
i think it did not validated entry because it close below the W2 and it become "nothing". Liun can correct me if Im wrong. maybe the red arrow is a sell entry? Liun?

--- 帖子 #249 ---
as you asked, this is the recent one month's result on chart, i think if you really understand this system ,you will get the same answer with me. this is the Ea running result on live account. ea don't set sl/tp but you should set it in manually trade.

thanks a lot.&lt;3

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Please can anyone confirm if this is the right setting for the 2 indicators?

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Hi liunliun, I am new to this thread and read some of your posts. i don't know what your white and yellow lines are, can you explain them to me (pm or here?) You can do it in Chinese, I will be able to understand you. Also what are the conditions for entry and exit? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Is this setting correct?

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Your settings are the same as the template liunliun posted before.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
the best i think is that we dont get hit the full sl every time. that a real cool thing. the only problem i think is with a job besides trading its hard to look at the charts the whole day. Can anyone make an alert when price hits white 2 ? i cant ....

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Hi, I think the second one is not needed. Delete him from the chart and you see no difference, anyway I did not see. You also can change the colors of the both indi's to see what is what. BR

--- 帖子 #262 ---
just remain four lines that is OK for you . two yellow two white.

PA has touched the upper White line.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
yes you get the point of this system. as for your second question, this system just take you about two hours a day,so i think you can solve it. good luck to you .

--- 帖子 #267 ---
good luck to you . demo first,when you are familiar with this system you can work on live account.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
yes and the first one is a very good entry,because it is far away from yellow1,so you can get 40pips tp at that time.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
eh................................................... you don't know what is yellow and white???? yellow line is yellow,white line is white.... in chinese: 黄色的线就是yellow 白色的线就是white. any question?

--- 帖子 #270 ---
eh... liun2.0 what are they... good luck to you .

--- 帖子 #271 ---
sry i don't know why doesn't it work, step for setup: 1 put the ex4 to "/mql4/indicators" 2 put the tpl to "/templates" 3 click on the chart then chose the templates, 4 its done

--- 帖子 #272 ---
good luck to everybody. if there isn't nothing in there(i learned this sentence from the TV series" Prison Break", t-bag used to say like that"i don't do nothing",and i don't know whether or not it is wrong ) i 'll go to play pool. green pips for you guys.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Wait me bro!!!

Thanks for the share, its appreciated. Your English is a million times better than my Chinese so not need to apologise I am going to check this out and try it. Thanks again

I started to program an indicator, to see better the setups. For free of courese. I am not intrested in this forum, it was just a help.. But if you dont need it, I do not continue. Good luck to your Thread... I dont need this strategy...

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Hi liun and beertje,i had some request,is that this system can function at mobile phone MT4,what indicator need to setup........thank sir

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Beertje, is it the same as Liun indicator? Can you make an EA based on this since Liun dont want to share the mq4. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #284 ---
can you convert your indicator to MT5 platform?

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Hi, Should be a sell trade now !! BR

--- 帖子 #286 ---
sry maybe not. you should use a mobile computer with windows7 or higher.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
of curse i don't mind, you are helping others ,why should i get angry? just keep doing it ,and good luck to you !

--- 帖子 #288 ---
sry i can't my broker is MT4. you can go to get an MT4 demo account for signal, mt5 for your own broker.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
are you hinting me to give your the mq4? just a joke don't mind it... actually you can get green pips now just use ex4.

--- 帖子 #290 ---
感谢分享，有想过开一个中文版的吗?

--- 帖子 #291 ---
whats difference than using different bollinger bands ? dont think there is a magic indicator can help you... delete all indicators and just try to see how price starts a move and when it returns...

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Here is a chart showing trades since Mid January too today on GBPUSD. Sure the Euro dollar would also work. Two pairs on long term trading can give you more than enough pips and with less headache of the screen time. Using the mainstream idea here that this trader is showing us, yes its logical to make pips. But how, in simplicty learn how to trade and then a system like this helps you to follow the market. Do nt just expect someone to give u an indicator and away you go and for sure why would he not keep the MQ4 - if you learn how to trade then you already know how this works. learn how to re - load on a position as you know its gone up but really its still in a down trend and then of course learn how to re -load on a position as its gone south but you know its really in an uptrend. Using this great trades idea i have a chart to just outline how if you can stand to long term trend then yes you can be a success in this game.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
And here is the Euro USD using the same principle from the middle of Jan to today (which i also trade).

--- 帖子 #294 ---
est 4,000 pips Since January you;d be banking on these two pairs alone - if you calculate the draw down effect on the trading account you might just even get some sleep at night too .. so yes not only is the trader correct here but be thankfull he took the time to get you guys here too.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
The strategy seems to be good . I was wondering If someone could Convert this strategy into EA . I have tried but Couldn't develop good algorithm. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Liunliun, First of all thanks for your strategy Please explain this to me You say "white arrow is white[0] yellow arrow is white[1]. means white[0] is NOW, white[1] is last candle" But when you explain uptrend you say downtrend: white1&lt;yellow2 white 1 [0]&lt;white 1 [1] Here what is "white 1 [1]"? Is it same as "white[1]" If you don't mind, can you please explain the "trend" using another name for "NOW" candle and "LAST CANDLE" Ex: white[0]=NOW white[1]=PREVIOUS

--- 帖子 #297 ---
In this picture, can we enter on red arrow or should we avoid it since white1 touched price on yellow arrow?

--- 帖子 #298 ---
WHITE1 indicator value on present and previous candle, white1&lt;yellow2 white 1 [0]&lt;white 1 [1] so you can figure out if its going up or down

--- 帖子 #299 ---
you can visualize WHITE and YELLOW as two clouds, when they cross - start looking signal entry from last point where they touched after the cross, keep in mind that there are different conditions for signal when clouds penetrate each other

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Hi, If we see in the text White1, White2, Yellow1 or Yellow2; the lines in the chart are ment. White1 = upper White line, White2 is lower White line in the chart. If we see White1[0], this is the actual bar of the upper White1 line in the chart If we see White1[1], this is the previous bar of the upper White1 line in the chart BR

--- 帖子 #301 ---
How can i see what the indicators are measuring? i try to develop the base algorithm for EA

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Hi, How about this white_10 = iCustom(Symbol(),Period(),"liun_interval_index", 1.0, 1.0, 1.2, 0.0, 8.0, 8.0, 1, 0); white_11 = iCustom(Symbol(),Period(),"liun_interval_index",1.0, 1.0, 1.2, 0.0, 8.0, 8.0, 1, 1); white_20 = iCustom(Symbol(),Period(),"liun_interval_index",1.0, 1.0, 1.2, 0.0, 8.0, 8.0, 0, 0); white_21 = iCustom(Symbol(),Period(),"liun_interval_index",1.0, 1.0, 1.2, 0.0, 8.0, 8.0, 0, 1); yellow_10 = iCustom(Symbol(),Period(),"liun_interval_trend", 0.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 20.0, 20.0, 0, 0); yellow_11 = iCustom(Symbol(),Period(),"liun_interval_trend", 0.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 20.0, 20.0, 0, 1); yellow_20 = iCustom(Symbol(),Period(),"liun_interval_trend", 0.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 20.0, 20.0, 1, 0); yellow_21 = iCustom(Symbol(),Period(),"liun_interval_trend", 0.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 20.0, 20.0, 1, 1); BR

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Hey emonts ! That is easy part. The hard path is developing the right algo , and just allowing one trade per trend .. Hope you can help.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Try this, upTrend = false; if (white_21 &gt; yellow_11 &amp;&amp; white_20 &gt; white_21) { upTrend = true; } if (!previousUptrend &amp;&amp; upTrend &amp;&amp; nbrOfBuyTrades == 0) { // look for touch of W2 if (Ask &lt; white_20) { // open buy trade OrderSendReliable(_symb, OP_BUY, startVolume, Ask, slippage, 0.0, 0.0, magicNumberBuy, "Uptrend trade", 0, 0); previousUptrend = upTrend; } } if (!upTrend) { previousUptrend = false;} BR

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Thanks Forexior and emonts Now it is clear to me So when he says "uptrend: white2&gt;yellow1 white2[0]&gt;white2[1]" he means uptrend: white2&gt;yellow1 and white2[0]&gt;white2[1] correct?

--- 帖子 #306 ---
See post 2 BR

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Thanks. Now I think I understand the strategy correctly. It's so simple and that why I like it. Time for back testing!

--- 帖子 #308 ---
please don't change the system as you image...where is yellow on your chart.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
that's right.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
If you read my post correctly you would of realised i do not trade your system i trade something similar i have no need to trade your system, no need to even think about your system and no wishes to try and even go near you system i came across you post as it is similar to how you trade that is all, period. My chart does not have your indicators on them because i dont use them - i have my own system i was outlining how with one of the indicators you use it is possible on two pairs to make 800 - 1000 pips on average monthly which seems to equate to more than your estimates if i think 30 percent per annum , in simplicty i would not trade your system i trade my own. HERE IS MY QUOTE AGAIN - from that post. Using the mainstream idea here that this trader is showing us, yes its logical to make pips. USING the mainstream idea here - OK

--- 帖子 #311 ---
ok good luck to you

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Btw you should loose the fear of the markets - it shows in your system especially as your idea has alot more potential to it and on a safe level too. But then what works for one will always inspire another i suppose .. make em green those pips hey bubba

--- 帖子 #313 ---
to be honest ,i don't really understand your post,like what is btw……

--- 帖子 #314 ---
i think that is obvious

--- 帖子 #315 ---
you know nothing, and you like ppl in Chinese bbs just say "trade is very easy ,we just sell on the top ,buy on the floor" but where are top and floor is a problem with no answer.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
太麻烦了，而且我毕竟不是卖方法的，你们能看懂就好了。

--- 帖子 #317 ---
trade manually ,you can get it/

--- 帖子 #318 ---
white[1]&gt;x means white1[1]&gt;x and white2[1]&gt;x is that clear?

--- 帖子 #319 ---
wont you show the other traders your losses that you aquire to make the 30 percent per annum. as your system is now making less profit then before - the markets change your system has not and your getting caught out. I think its obvious why you are here but best let your story unfold one piece at a time .. I will come back in 6 months time this room will be empty and you know it - your fishing here for ideas from other traders in the hope they can improve your system as it needs it and so do you .. outta here and hey newbie traders be reallly carefull around here this guy is fish out of the water still very very slippery ok

--- 帖子 #320 ---
although i have not seen whether or not your answer is right, thanks to you to help others.

Yes my friend now everything is clear to me Thanks for sharing this. Back testing now (Manually)

Liunliun, in post 44 you say "its easy to find those five entries, but to be honest, i will not entry at the second yellow arrow, that is what i will tell you something else about the system ." regarding the chart below. Can you please explain that?

--- 帖子 #295 ---
You need to see the doctor bro before it gets wors T !

--- 帖子 #296 ---
ok

--- 帖子 #297 ---
i agree.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
hello buddy. welcome here. 1.now is notrend-short.you can find an entry when price touch white1. 2.go back to see post243.it will give you a better answer than i give. good luck to you ,green pips.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Thanks Liun!

--- 帖子 #300 ---
请问你有把这个做成EA 吗？让机器来判断岂不是比人一直盯着轻松一点？你的策略的关键是你的那些指标，entry和exit都是比较好判断的。

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Thanks a lot. Green pips.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
hi liun, is this a "no trend short"?, it seems like become "nothing" after 6 hours right?

--- 帖子 #303 ---
emonts, can you explain these parameters in plain english )? i'n not yet familiar with mt4 programming language(i have a programming background) thank you too liun!

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Absolutely, But I wouldn't have entered the trade, I don't know about Liun. My reason : at the point of entry white 2 has ready become NOTHING. I.e not sync with white 1. Cheers

--- 帖子 #305 ---
liunliun, it seems that the yellow line has no use. its just there to label"trend" or no trend" or nothing". But the entry is based on the white line no matter what the direction of the yellow line? agree?

--- 帖子 #306 ---
white_10 = iCustom(Symbol(),Period(),"liun_interval_index", 1.0, 1.0, 1.2, 0.0, 8.0, 8.0, 1, 0); This is calling a custom indicator: Symbol() = pair Period() = timeframe "liun_interval_index" = custom parameter 1.0, 1.0, 1.2, 0.0, 8.0, 8.0 = are the external parameters of the indicator 1 = buffer of the indicator to read 0 = bar index, this case actual bar The best is read some existing inidicators code and try to understand. MT4 language looks much like C#. BR

777 i think yellow line is more useful than white line. white line just tells you where to entry,(really easy ,touch to entry,). but the yellow line is the long term support and resistance,it tells you where the market will turn(maybe turn).

--- 帖子 #343 ---
sometimes you don't need to confirm the entry with touching white. if the price is close to white,like just 2 pips ,you can open your trade.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #345 ---
You recommend only USDJPY and CADJPY(If spread&lt;2) pairs correct? Is there a specific reason for that? I mean does this work only with JPY pairs? Or pairs with very low spread?

--- 帖子 #346 ---
活學活用 舉一反三。 i don't know how to translate to english, you ppl go to google to get the answer

--- 帖子 #347 ---
spread depends on your broker. you can have a good look at usdjpy cadjpy audnzd these three pairs ,they have safe,clear,clean,obvious,trend or notrend in H2 or H1.for example you can check eurusd,its too difficult to make money,because of some quant funds

--- 帖子 #348 ---
So when we have a spread under 2 pips we can trade cadjpy, usdjpy, audnzd?

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Great thanks

--- 帖子 #350 ---
..............no、

--- 帖子 #351 ---
okay

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Liun, usually at what time you trade? Do you choose specific sessions? (London session/ New York session etc)

--- 帖子 #353 ---
london more. but both these are ok

--- 帖子 #354 ---
You can't get more than 5 trades in a month. Too small I think

win is everything. newbie want to make quick money with lots of trades,but only successful ppl in market know long term is the key.. every body had thought short term is better than long term,but when they trade more they will find the answer. how do a normal man win the game in short term with beating quantfund/Atomic clock/hf trade?

Hi there! How do you know which buffers are corresponding to which lines? I am new to programming EA so can't figure it out, thank you! Also, my offline H2 chart is not updating, how can I make the EA react with the most recent data? Thank you again!

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Agreed!

--- 帖子 #358 ---
You have to keep the 1h chart opened for the 2h to update

--- 帖子 #359 ---
And also the offline chart unchecked in the properties, right? It seems to work now, thanks!

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Hi, Normally open the indi and select the color tab. There you see colors. So first color is normally buffer 0. But is not always the case. What you also can do make small indi with the iCustom call. Just try buffer by buffer and give alert and compare value with chart. You must keep H1 chart with indi open anyway. Had also problem in updating when using OnTick() So I activated the OnTimer() function and this one checks every second. Works for me. BR

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Thank you! I will try it later. Btw how do you backtest the strategy? We can't choose H2 in the tester...

--- 帖子 #344 ---
thanks tobben for your help. So when in "no trend" situation, white 1 and white 2 must in sync right? how about during uptrend or downtrend?

--- 帖子 #345 ---
jarrodt, if you know what is "nothing"in market then you can get your answer.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
I have not done back test. In general i do not believe so much in back test. So we have to believe the thread owner. BR

uptrend if you have enough paitance , daily can help you make lots of pips.

thanks tobben and have a good day.

It's an up trend. But not sure if this method works with CADCHF. Did you back test on CADCHF?

--- 帖子 #354 ---
hi liun this is the h2 chart of usdjpy on 12 april. Is this correct on "downtrend short"? after 6 hours then the white1[0] is &gt; white1[1], so it become nothing and we should close the trade right?

--- 帖子 #355 ---
yes, but after 4 hours already it become nothing....

--- 帖子 #356 ---
in fact the pre candle you marked is the close of your entry.you may loss about 1 pip.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
ok thanks liun for your guide, im getting a clearer picture of your system now.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
hi liun how about this chart it showing "no trend short", when the next 2 hours "x candle" shows that white 1[0] is &gt; than white1[1] and it become nothing. when do we close the trade when it become nothing during the market? 1. close it after x candle close? 2. close it once we saw "the moment" when white1[0]&gt;white1[1]?

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Hi LiunLiun, Just want to ask if your indicators are based on modified Standard Error Bands .... thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Wow. After walking through the whole forum posts and manually backtested the strategy for the past year, I must say it is really a smart/safe strategy. You mentioned about safe entry, and talking about philosophy and I find out that you're really an experienced trader. I don't know how you come up with the 2 indicators and the use of them, but you're really a genius. it's sad no one discuss the philosophy behind this strategy although you said in many posts. The yellow lines predict the future trend and the white lines are the indicators of the safe entry point. Where "notrend" could be the confirmed reversal point of a top or a bottom of a wave. And the "uptrend""downtrend" could be the end of a wave. When it becomes "nothing", it means possible reversal. and we shall not take a second entry because it has more possibility as a reversal. As for the other "nothing" scenarios, which mean we can't tell it's long or short at that moment. So the strategy don't open trade. This is my understanding of the philosophy behind the strategy. It indeed ignore most fake signals and only trade when the price action is confirmed as "safe entry" Amazing! Thanks for sharing selflessly!! 順帶一提，我也是說中文的，不過我來自台灣，很高興能跟你學習！

--- 帖子 #361 ---
no,base on nothing standard.

--- 帖子 #381 ---
this question has not a nochange answer. if the candle will close in ten minutes,we can see it as closed. at that time i think we should close the trade after x candle close.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
hi guys, is this a valid entry because the yellow 1 and yellow 2 seems not sync to the same direction

--- 帖子 #383 ---
I think the yellow lines are like bolinger bands. When they are in opposite direction mean there is momentum.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
aceon, how do you predict the future with the yellow lines? Can give an example. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Maybe using the word "predict" is too much. It's just my wild guess, yellow lines might provide a suggestion of the future direction of the price action. Like the line in Ichimoko. When you check the past posts, Liunliun mentioned that the yellow lines are more useful than the white lines. So my wild guess is based on that. But I agree with you about the momentum

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Is there anyway you can post mq4 for these indicators so we can help clean up/optimize the code? I built an EA for it but backtesting with these 2 indicators is some of the slowest backtesting I've ever witnessed.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
The indicators used a lot of CPU for me when I tested the system but when I asked for the source so that it could be fixed, the answer was no. I assume the indicators might contain code to eventually expire and perhaps he plans to sell the indicators at that point.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
maybe you should buy a new computer. do you think it is reasonable to ask something for a stranger? 伸手黨 go to ask the answer of these three words in google translate.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
nothing can predict the future include yellow. we just trade as we know, we don't guess the future.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Hello LiunLIun, I want to thank you for your strategy, I'm trying to understand because I'm french but your indicators are actually going to expire? This would be real false hope for us

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Liunliun, after following your system for a few days and watching some setups play out, I really like what I see. This system is simple, focused, and should make a good system especially for novice traders. Why do I think so? Because of the philosophy and the principles it advocates: 1. Focus on one setup, and learn to trade it well. This setup, as I understand it, is to capture the second leg of a directional move. Markets do not move in straight lines, they move in steps, waves and zigzags. This can be described as 1-2-3 or A-B-C patterns, Elliottwavers talk about 5 waves in a trend move, 3 waves in a countertrend move... It doesn't matter here, in all these patterns there is always a second leg (The "C" in ABC). And this is our focus, we try to capture this second leg. Nothing else. Here is a picture to illustrade the A-B-C patterns in some of the setups I have observed over the last 10 days (USDJPY, 1 hour chart). The small red arrows (a bit hard to see) show the entries the system would have given me when price touched the "white" indicator lines. Attached Image (click to enlarge) 2. Trend, Notrend, Nothing. As our focus is on directional moves, we only want to be in the market when there is a high probability of directional moves. If the market is in a "trend", this is easy, we trade in the direction of the trend. And if the market is in a trading range, going sideways ("notrend"), it is also easy: we can trade the directional moves from one boundary of the range to the other one ("buy low, sell high"). But when the market is in transition ("nothing"), then this system keeps you out of the market. Excellent! Some novice traders make the mistake of entering the market as soon as a trendline gets broken, assuming that this means we have a new trend in the opposite direction of the broken trend. When in reality we have "nothing", until a new trend is confirmed, or a new trading range is confirmed. 3) Low risk entry This part of the system is really smart: using the "white" channel type indicator to find a low risk entry point, during the retracement or consolidation phase ("B") after the first leg of our directional move ("A"). This is an idea that I have now included in my own trading system - which uses different markets, timeframes, platforms, indicators... but this principle still works! So, my thanks go to you liunliun for sharing your ideas. It takes years of experience to come up with a design so simple, where anything not essential has been removed, and it still works. Well done!

Hi kinitex The white bands seem to be Standard Error bands with Linear Reg. length of 13 and smoothing 3 ... that comes 90% close. Yellow bands is the same indicator with different settings ...looks like displaced bands ...still try to figure out what is the middle average line .. if find that then it's easy to replicate the bands

yesterday, my ea robot give me two trades with 60pips by two method, yellow is short,using the main system.the two whites almost in yellow,so we can see the white as a downtrend. red is long, i mentioned yesterday at post 411, anyone get it? the reason for long i mentioned at post329.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
notice that post 329 is really important, maybe more important than the main system. Mechanical trade can't beat man's mind.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
wait for yellow spot. that is the safe entry. safe entry is everything.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
ok i tell you the reason. why we trade usdjpy. do you remember that i mentioned audnzd either. 我用英文說實在太難了，你們是否介意去google翻譯一下，sorry about this. 1,最重要的一點是jpy的形態很柔和，他們在一定範圍內的方差很小，就像一條蛇一樣，而eurusd像蜈蚣，身上都是刺，xau像工地的腳手架，或者像子母“Z” 不夠柔和。 2 第二重要的一點是jpy在一個交易日內2h最多只有兩個轉勢，這能很好的約束tp和sl。 3 所以jpy是最適合散戶交易的品種。

--- 帖子 #438 ---
I dont unerstand with this White2[0], white[1], yellow[0] (if any), and yellow[1] (also if any), You only mention white1, white2, etc Thanks Bro!

--- 帖子 #439 ---
How to generate the H2? Sorry, I forget the steps to generate... Thanks Bro!

--- 帖子 #440 ---
1.The most important thing is that the form of jpy is softer, they are within a certain range of variance is very small, like a snake, and eurusd like a centipede, who are thorns, xau like the site scaffolding, or like the mother "Z" Not soft enough 2.The second important point is that jpy in a trading day 2h up to only two transitions, which can be a good constraint tp and sl 3.So jpy is the most suitable for retail trading varieties BR

They are planing to include those pairs on NSE and BSE but till now they have not allowed it. even after allowing the liquidity will be major concern..... if you hold indian citizenship then you are allowed only to trade inr pairs, that too transaction should take place by NSE or BSE. if you are in relation to any big politician or business man who owns few multi-million dollar company, then above rules are not for you..

--- 帖子 #448 ---
But how can I know that the market will reverse or continue the current trend? 英语好费劲，还是用中文吧，是不是因为原趋势触碰到阻力后的反弹力度越来越小，所以判断这次反转的可能性就很高？post 329有点不好理解，希望能进一步讲解一下，谢谢！

go back to see the post, both two of yours are not entries.

I, too, do not understand the conditions for opening deals. A lot of water and little specifics. If someone understands the exact rules - please show on the chart in which places to enter, where to place a take and where to put a stoploss. For an early thank you to this man!

someone upload the picture to summary the system ,i think it can help you to understand. but i forget which post is ,,,, actually its very simple.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
I understand second one is not an entry but why isn't the first entry?

--- 帖子 #478 ---
The first entry according to post #29 and the second #34 of the author rules.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
have a good look at them. someone who understand can help him. some really simple rules i don't want to repeat again.

--- 帖子 #480 ---
The first entry (in post 472) is not allowed because white1 is bigger than yellow1. See post #9 for rules. I think the second entry is a legitimate entry. Because white1 and white2 are both between yellow1 and yellow2. And also , the white lines are in sync, as well as the yellow lines. And they are opposite to each other. So, it should be a legitimate short in the notrend-area according to the rules. What do I miss here ? By the way, why are the yellow lines in post 472 white ? They look white to me. Also, their appearance is different from the one in my chart. Is there a parameter problem ?

The second one - a "No-Trend" trade is following another "No-Trend" trade - thus the "Trend-No_Trend-Trend" sequence rule is broken. No Entry. LiunLiun- correct me if I am wrong. If you think about it the 2nd trade is a "W" pattern's 2nd bottom. This system (somehow using displaced bands ) avoids entering a trade in the wrong direction. I am taking some liberties here in putting this theory out. This is my own understanding not the author's. Wish you well.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
YES YOU ARE RIGHT，congratulation to you. green pips.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
Hey Chris, Not sure if you are still following the thread. What Liun means is (as far as I can understand) we take entries when the market is 1. In trend 2. In "No Trend" When the market is in "Nothing" we do not take any trades. Also when market changes from Nothing to No-Trend, we do NOT take trades based on No-Trend rules. We wait until Nothing becomes a Trend and then in the next No-trend phase we can take the entries. We only take trades when the market is in the cycle of Trend&gt;No-Trend&gt;Trend&gt;No-Trend ....... Is that clear now? I think " majasan 's" reply above will also help you to understand (Liun will confirm or correct me if I' wrong)

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Hallo Liun, Why is your system (see automated system above) taking this trade : USD/JPY Buy 108.614 Apr 19, 2017 1:07am Sell 108.813 Apr 19, 2017 3:05am ?? It is in the middle of nothing, according to your explanation in post 488. Therefore, it should not trade.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Could you explain, on which rule your decision to go long, is based ?

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Actually he means to long UJ

Is there any way we can add these custom indicators to metatrader mobile (Android/iOS)?

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Custom indicator on mobile? that would be awesome. But I dont think there is a way for now.

--- 帖子 #510 ---
thanks for sharing, liunliun . what's the time frame of your great system? in my opinion,it is essentially a breaking-though system? anyway, those foreign guys love kongfu more than us.

i don't understand those disgusting people.. it's liunliun's indicator, he can do whatever he pleases with it.. just thank him for sharing and that's it.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Hello there, this is my first time registering to forexfactory. i love the rules of safe entry of this system. im having a hardtime to understand it and took 2 days to read and reread the rules. here i post a picture of current market, from my understanding, if the white1 and white2 are entering yellow 1, we will see notrend, and we will standby to sell usdjpy. is this correct? please advice. ps: im back to forex after 10 years leaving it because of the frustration. now i see new hope.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
hi kimie. yes you are right. and i wish you success,good luck to you ,never give up.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Hi liunliun it is possible Analyze. this charts ( AUDCHF H1 &amp; H4 ) Is correct buy ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Hai liun thanks again hehe. this strategy have many secret that brain storming lol. i keep repeat all your post. at your post at usdjpy M30. we can open sell at "notrend" because the rule is 1. nothing - 2. trend - 3. notrend. am i right?? need more exercise for your post at 329. if can need more example from you for that pattern. hehe thanks liun for great job. many thanks. always be healthy and God Bless you

--- 帖子 #542 ---
something wrong with your picture. i m going to teach you the post329 next week if you guys need .

--- 帖子 #543 ---
hi ahhamid, Can you share the dashboard of yours ? I need this. Will spare me the time to switch between charts. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
i think the Shanghai A-Stock will enter a very very big long term uptrend next week. Celebrate the Big bull market

--- 帖子 #545 ---
thanks liun, need more practice really for pattern at post 329. if dont mind, please add more picture. oh my pict wrong?? okay still more practice then , hehe

--- 帖子 #546 ---
from my understanding, "nothing" can be in 2 situation. 1. "nothing" inside yellow 2. "nothing" outside yellow. if "nothing" inside yellow, we will wait for "trend" if "nothing" outside yellow, we will wait for "notrend" the uses of "nothing" is to : 1. get out of the market, take profit or cut loss. 2. to stay away from market and wait only for "trend" or "notrend" to identify "nothing": 1. if its a downtrend, you will wait for price touching white1 to enter position, only pay attention to white 1. if the angle of white 1 are higher/slightly higher, close your position. the line will look like this " / " 2.if its an uptrend, you will wait for price touching white2, only pay attention to white 2. if the angle of white 2 are lower/slightly lower, close your position. the line will look like this " \ ". please correct me if im wrong, i will edit it fast.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Then I will buy some 300ETF from next week. I am waiting for entry for a long time.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Hi Liumlium, I agree , Shanghai Composite looks good for at least a bounce up to 3300 from this support area .... so a good entry point here. Do you have to recommend any particular stocks ?

--- 帖子 #549 ---
This is a great idea. I still have trouble understanding post329 too. Please explain it when you have time. Thanks Liun

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Made in China? it will break after a couple of months and no refunds.....

--- 帖子 #551 ---
you are a SB, out of this thread.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
just ignore him. i was skeptical like him long time ago. back then, i saw everything as a scam. now im back and put myself down to earth to learn. please comment on my previous post. i need to understand better.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Hi Kimie .. Thanks for your explanation.. Help a lot.. i will screenshot this post as my revision...

--- 帖子 #554 ---
yes two nothing.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Analyzing the past is not a problem. Make examples where the input will be on the first candle on the right.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
my understanding of "nothing" based on previous examples of liun is, when, after you enter (for buy),the price will closed below white1 ...and vice versa for sell. thus you only have lose small pip or BE. Liun will correct me if im wrong.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
right now we have sell open on UJ, sl 20 pips.

--- 帖子 #558 ---
what a big gap. more than 100pips.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Did you sell on the top around 110. 40 ?

--- 帖子 #560 ---
no. a little late. sell at 110.18

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Very strange how different our charts display todays market open gap. Also my indicator set is giving completly different picture compared to what Kimie posted above. This is not good.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Kimie's chart was from before the open took place. It is the same as your chart when you remove the 2 opening candles.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
ohhhh poor baby cant take a little joke. Sir, with such soft skin and so emotional you wont last long in this world!

--- 帖子 #564 ---
please, i think you should reconsider how you respect others before saying someone can't take a little joke. I dont see any problem with merchandise made in China, Bangladesh, India or even Pakistan. Yes they break over time, but you are the one who boiught it on first place for cheaper deal. Why don't you consider yourself a *cheap scum* first? If you don't like this thread (made of china?) , you can stay out of it. Nobody is asking for your opinion. But if you have any idea on improving this system, i believe the op and everyone here are more than happy to hear from you.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
As i said, this is not the business for someone so emotional. And i do not need to lower myself to your level by hurling insults so will end this discussion with you here. Feel free to have the last word if you wish, knowing it will be but a pointless post. My advice would be to toughen up a little if you want to succeed in this or any business. Good luck to you

--- 帖子 #566 ---
thanks for your advice, that's real educating. truth is you hurt the feeling of op, as he just wish to share the system and improve it with the community. Yea we could be emotional sometimes, but i just can't sit tight reading you commenting how bad china product is, clearly we are all here for forex learning and sharing, not to discuss how bad a china made product gonna be. good luck to you too.

trade in trend ,never against the trend that will help you protect your account when 20158.24

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Hi Liunliun. First of all many thanks for teaching us this system and am eager to learn more. I am currently back testing this via my automated system and find the results encouraging. One question, as you wait for closure of the price, is there a limitation of how deep the price can penetrate through the white line? Thx and keep it going!

--- 帖子 #576 ---
sry i don't know what you mean. if you trade manually, you can pull the trigger when price close to white(distance&lt;5pips or less)

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Got it, so you trigger the trade not after the close of the candle, but rather immediately when it nears the white line.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
Sorry for the delay. I holidays. Need one dashboard ?

--- 帖子 #579 ---
yes u got it right

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Firstly, 谢谢你 liunliun for contributing your system and for your continued guidance here. I am new to Forex and have been practising with a demo account for one week. I found this thread yesterday and have just finished reading all previous pages. From your feedback to others I think I have a good grasp of the rules. However, there are certain cases where I'm not 100% sure whether the chart has transitioned into "nothing", "trend" or "no-trend". I have attached an annotated screenshot showing the state I believe each segment of the chart to be in (supplemented with cfudge's diagrams). If you or others could be so kind as to offer feedback, I'd be grateful. Thanks! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Your entry looks correct, exit is premature - candle had not closed so W2 ended UP, not down. These graphics for the rules are not a 100% correct, better read Liunliun's posts until you get it.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Yes exactly, White 2 dipped lower but candle hadn't closed yet, jumped on it too early. Could have made about 40 pips.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
What I don't understand is that for a "trend" to transition into a "no-trend" it must pass through a state of "nothing" (i.e. the white lines must swing 90-degrees across the yellow channel, and that turn involves bending of white lines). By this reasoning you would never be able to make an entry if you excluded all potential entries in a "trend/no-trend" phase that was preceded by a "nothing" phase. Am I missing something?

--- 帖子 #584 ---
As Liunliun said before- 'indicators' are not the main point here. Understanding the market is. - If I may take the liberty to remind you that in Turtle's strategy - there is a less quoted and forgotten rule. You don't take the trade of a 21 day BO -breakout if the last trade was a success - but if it travels ahead and reaches the 55 day BO then you do take the trade. This system kind of helps you to stay away from the first shorter time frame BOs- probably when White is below Yellow, but enters at the White and Yellow cross ( no-trend), and then above when White is well above Yellow- which will correlate to 55 day BO. - Apologies to Liunliun if I had diverted his system - my assumptions above can be wrong. But what I wanted to say was not to depend on the Indicators too much but only to the extent it shows where in the trend you are and hence adjust your appetite for risk in the particular trade in that particular instant in that particular instrument.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
can you tell me which ma you use with macd and its settings please thanks

--- 帖子 #586 ---
its difficult to trade now. uj maybe go into a downtrend.like the image. but in a long term , there is a strong uptrend.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Took +40 pips a while ago. Got in a bit late - not that easy to catch the right moment, also because of the repainting whites...

--- 帖子 #590 ---
this thread is dead?

--- 帖子 #591 ---
No its not dead. I think those that grasped the concept are trading it and there is no need for endless charts of trades. It is all here to absorb and hopefully profit...

--- 帖子 #592 ---
who got the sell just now? i missed the signal.

--- 帖子 #593 ---
i missed it too i place my sell order @ 112.6

--- 帖子 #594 ---
its a beautiful entry, no retrace. can you load up some picture so others can see?

This information was the missing piece of the puzzle in my trading journey. It looks like it my robot more stable and profitable. I did not copy the system but was inspired by the classifications of the market. For yours and my inspiration, this the USDJPY backtest over 6 years. No tricks no martingale. I have the same results for GBPUSD and trying different markets now as well. Hope you guys have similar results using Liun's advice.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
what MA are you using for your entry rules?

--- 帖子 #599 ---
did he said he used MA for his entry rules?

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Just wanted confirm that the approach from Liun is valid and the philosophy behind it is working for me ( I am using a similar system, just did not classify the market in such a manner). I don't want to hijack the thread, but was excited as it seems I am finally leaving the breakeven period of my trading journey.

--- 帖子 #601 ---
just guessing the entry point.

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Hi Kimie, I'm using the same entry point as Liun.

--- 帖子 #603 ---
sell signal appear.

--- 帖子 #604 ---
I exited with little profit, because white1 goes up

--- 帖子 #605 ---

Hi, can I buy your mq4 files of indicators? I really need them and I would be glad to get them.

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Pls. read line 5 in post #1

--- 帖子 #620 ---
guys don't PM me to ask me if this system is a fake.. the guy jarrodt get 20% profit in last month.

--- 帖子 #621 ---
here is a complete EA (very basic) , but i don't have good results in BT. Maybe LiunLiun can tell us more about what he added in his EA ? thanks Jeff EDIT : please look further down, because this version is not OK

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Hi Liun Which other pairs can be used with this strategy other than USDJPY?

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Appreciate your effort! Couple of comments after running it on H1: Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #624 ---
the missed sell does not touch the line, i will only sell if the price touches the line, not if it is very close : in the picture the price does not touches everybody is free to modify the EA if i made mistakes or to improve it , i'm not saying it is perfect but i followed the rules carefully

--- 帖子 #625 ---
could you try this version? i disabled "notrend" (you can enable it as a parameter) so we start just with dntrend and uptrend for now until we see clearer Jeff

--- 帖子 #626 ---
These buy/sells are OK but: * close prematurely (either the deactivated TS kicks in anyway or the logic does not wait for the candle to close when looking at the slope of the yellow WHITE and exits). * you have to sell after one trend buy. Regarding the NO-trend: I find it better not to wait for a complete touch on the pullback (within 5 pips or so). Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #627 ---
nice work bro. keep it up. now we can backtest it and prove it from 5 years back. but it should be running on 2hours chart. can you modified that?

--- 帖子 #628 ---
something wrong in it like u said. btw GO5 do u get ur green pips with this method?

--- 帖子 #629 ---
pen &amp; paper or EXCEL can help u to backtest the method... not difficult.

--- 帖子 #630 ---
finally , in this month, i suggest u just trade in trend. i think it will come a big trend.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
i didn't see any exit rules so i just put an SL and/or a Ts, but i'll look more into it. you want only alternating buy/sells? not two consecutive buys/sells? i can do that please confirm/infirm ok i'll modify it, you're talking about 4 or 5 digits 5 pips? here is a version for H2, i just put '120' instead of "Period()", i'm not sure, i've never used H2 before, please try it and tell me if it works Jeff

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Yes Liun, working fine. The only thing is the missed trades - which is where an EA could come in handy, even if it were semi-manual...

--- 帖子 #633 ---
Thanks for the new version. The exact rules are "hidden" in the thread, sort of... One of them is to always switch from notrend to trend trades to notrend.... So you can have two buys: buy notrend, then buy trend. Not "buy trend" 2 times (risking exhaustion of the move). Exit can be tricky (apart from SL): in a buy, exit when the white 1 is down but not on the fly, the candle has to be closed. Entry is on the fly and like Liun said, a couple of pips distance is ok (pips - not pipettes).

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Great ! Good to see here some fresh activity !

--- 帖子 #635 ---
i think the successives closes you pointed out earlier come from the "noThing = true" part of the code which closes all the orders if conditions are met. this part can now be disabled in parameters now as well as the period can now be selected in params sorry i don't get this part at all. ! could you rephrase ? new version v3: TouchesAddin (this is to trigger buy/sell even if the price doesn't touch the line) ECN noThingCloseAll and period H1/ H2 thanks Jeff

--- 帖子 #636 ---
Ok, I, ll try to put it another way: Suppose, a notrend builds up and you go long on the pullback. You win and it pulls back again (still in notrend): you pass. Then it goes out of the yellow and a trend trade comes along: you take it (2nd long in a row). Another trend long comes up: you pass. Now we reverse and the same thing for shorts... Version H2 and 03 is very slow all over sudden and not taking trades.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Hi Liunliun! So been reading through the first like 20 pages of this thread, looks really promising! One thing i havnt seen anyone ask "so far atleast" is: What about holding trades over the weekend? what about news? is there any rules to it, do you avoid it? And also thank you for taking your time and energy trying to teach the masses !

--- 帖子 #638 ---
1 I never hold trades over the weekend. 2 I don't trade through the news.

--- 帖子 #639 ---
太长了 看不懂， goodluck to you .

--- 帖子 #640 ---
Hi Liunliun and everybody else, I've been following this thread and came across a few questions. Does the white line have to be in sync with the yellow line when the white line is beneath or above the yellow line. because at the first arrow on my picture the previous candle hits the white line but lines ar not sync, the seccond candle however hits the white line, but this time the lines seem to be going in sync.

--- 帖子 #641 ---
So if a trade is open on friday, it have not touched TP, not close to being stopped out.. what do you do? just collapse it, no matter if it's + or -? same with news? sorry if i'm repeating the question somewhat..

--- 帖子 #642 ---
i usually play pool on friday night., so there is no trade in friday of mine.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
what do you call a "pullback" , when price changes direction? but which price white1/2 or yellow? i need precise strategy (like white1 &gt; white2 , etc) and english isn't my mother tongue

--- 帖子 #644 ---
Maybe this graph makes it a bit clearer. Watch out with white 1/2: the indicator labels are 2 and 1 (the other way around), don't know why. Yellow labels are ok. Note the buy with green letter: the white 1 is not "up" as required but it was before the candle closed. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #645 ---
This looks very interesting. I will give it a good look over the weekend. It looks like a momentum method.

--- 帖子 #646 ---
liunliun, 您好, (我住在深圳和芝加哥).... Have you ever tried this system using a range bar instead of a 2h "time" bar? I will experiment with this system using various ranges, say 9 to 20 range. I have found that using range bars instead of time bars smooth the swings out. I have seen a system similar to this using range bars and two different Keltner Channels with different settings. The idea was to trade on the momentum reversals. 你好 Suggest an edit Nǐ hǎo 你好 Suggest an edit Nǐ hǎo

Hello. A question. We said that a trend up is when W2&gt; Y1 and when W2 [0]&gt; W2 [1] this seems clear to me it is correct. I did not understand how W1 should behave, should she also follow a trend up or can she go down? Thanks for the answers and sorry for my English.

Hello Liunliun, Thank you for the interesting system. I have a major question: do you re-start MT4 every 2 hours? Your lines keep repainting. How do you handle it?

I got similar idea on using the indicator. First of all, Please study the usage of indicator: envelop (You can Google the usage of envelop if you donno) Try to entry for breakout of white lines (index) one. Most of the time, Yellow Lin_Trend look reverse way from Lin_Index As the thinner Lin_Index is the way what the market go, When you feel white thin Channel kick into Yellow zone. Open trade follow white thin channel go. When Yellow Zone make fat and Hoz. view (non-trend), no entry. When white thin Channel try to break though Yellow zone, Open trade follow white thin channel go. If you feel white thin Channel straightly pass though Yellow zone Let the profit runs. Besides, you can kick off LIN_Trend and use other MA to make cross. Even HMA with LIN_Index can easy to make strategy. just study how Lin_Index behave and make gold/dead cross to fit the second entry
