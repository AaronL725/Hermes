I like this system because: 1. Keeps me out until trend is starting 2. Gets me in early in a new trend 3. Keeps me in while trend develops 4. Gives colour coded entry signals 5. Specific exit point 6. Filters out bad signals 7. SL is small (10-15 pips) 8. TP anywhere from 10-50 pips per trade. 9. Few losing trades (if stick to rules), yet actively trading most of session. 10. Small Time frame, 5 mins Visually back testing it produces 40- 100 pips per day (Late Asian and London Session) on GBPUSD, also trying it on EURUSD but so far prefer GU. Today's trading on GBPUSD has produced around 88 pips (If taken all entries at correct time and stuck to the exit rules. Please note it is NonLagMA not actually Hull indicators - If anyone knows the difference between the NonLag and Hull please post. I thought they were the same - apologies. Chart Indicators and Settings: 5 Minute Chart 20 Exponential Moving average - set to close Three NonLagMA indicators in separate window, set to 15, 30 and 50 set Fixed Min to 1 and Fixed Max to 2 to straighten indicator (note NonLag indicator now does not have yellow as it was confusing people) Pivots, Today's Open, Yesterday's High and Low (when I say Pivots in future I mean all pivots, mid pivots, Yest highs, lows, open etc) I use 2 pivot indicators one has yesterday's high/low, today's open etc, and the Autopivot as it shows previous days Pivot lines but not highs or lows. Candle Timer, Current Price (optional) RULES Trading times: late Asian and London session. SIGNAL (tells us direction bias) 1. NonLags all same colour ( Red Short , Green Long ) Risky to enter on the signal, price has often moved away from 20 EMA and we get stopped out on on the retrace. ENTRY 2. Wait for price to return to EMA and close in direction of trade below EMA for Short and above EMA for Long I prefer correct colour candle for the direction also also. If we wait for the reverse to EMA, we can have smaller stop loss, higher probability, and less false entries. 3. Check NonLag's still right colour for the direction of the trade. If they are not this is indication price trend may not be following through on signal. Sometimes just waiting for 1 or 2 candles we get confirmation. 4. Try not to enter if price too close to a Pivot point eg if we want to go long and price is 4 pips under daily pivot not a good entry point. EXITS 1. PIVOT POINT - take profit at the pivot point you are trading towards. Price gets magnetised to these points, (these can be Daily PP, R1,2,3, S1,2,3, Mid points, Open, yesterdays High, or Low) ALL these points tend to be either stop and reverse, stop and consolidate, or slow, reverse, or continue). Either way can be good exit point as price is often indecisive at these points. If candles are strongly going towards the pivot point, or if NonLag's all stay right colour consistently, consider holding to see if price goes to next pivot point especially if its a mid pivot point. 2. SIGNAL OTHER WAY (3 NonLags opposite colour to trade) Consider exiting also if 2 of the 3 NonLag's are wrong color . Using this exit usually gets us out of a bad trade for either a couple of pips, break even or a few pips loss. Rarely should we watch it go to SL as there will usually have been an indication by the NonLag's that price was reversing. It is better to get out with a few pips loss and perhaps re-enter later. STOP LOSS Approx 10 - 15 pips, use your own judgement some pairs may need 15 others may need only 10. If we get the entry right, price often moves quickly in our direction so stop loss not an issue. But if you try to trade in low volatility or ranging times you may find stops being tested more often. If we wait for the EMA retrace to enter, stops are hardly ever looked at, exits will then tend to be for a few pips or break even at worst if the trade doesn't follow through. TAKE PROFIT 2 or 3 pips from the pivot you are trading towards. If price misses by 5 pips or more it usually comes back for another go. Alternate methods, take 50% at pivot, move to break even and let rest ride to next pivot.

subscribed, im interested in any m5 pivot system cause i search for s.th like that for my own system ( see signature)... hope we can make it kind regards Jonas

Thanks for taking the time in sharing your system. Would like to get entry &amp; exit rules with indicators if possible. Chango

Hi Phanti, thanks for your interest, I have found i can't stand NOT having pivots on my charts no matter what or whose system I am using. Sometimes I am in trading rooms or live webinar and the operator will say, oh look at that price just move back suddenly, and I type in the chat box "well it was the daily pivot point!" and they usually ignore me cos it's not part of their system to look at pivots. So I agree, to find a pivot based system that works consistently would be great. Hopefully I am on to something here. The problem I have with pivots is not quite knowing once it reaches a pivot which way it s going to go, it often fakes up or down and I get whipsawed to death around the pivot point. Next post I outline my rules as they are at present which keeps me out until a direction is determined.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
filter it out with some indicators. never use toooo tight stops.... looking forward Phanti

--- 帖子 #6 ---
Exponential Moving average - 20 set to close on chart. 3 -NonLagMA (Hull MA) separate, set to 15, 30 and 50 Hull settings may need to be adjusted for currency and after forward testing. Daily pivots, and Open, Yesterdays High and Close I use both the ##SDXPivtos cos it has yesterdays high, today's open etc, and the Autopivot is handy cos it shows previous days pivot lines but unfortunately not highs or lows. Market Open Times (adjust to your time zone) i use http://forex.timezoneconverter.com/ to check. Default settings are not correct for anyones timezone I don't believe. This indicator also has half hour warning setting which is handy. Candle Timer, Current Price (optional)

--- 帖子 #7 ---
This is why I have made this system, it has nice tight stops, but doesn't whip saw me out My rules following.

Hi! Im new here at FF..thanks for your contribution! looking forward to know more on ur system...looks like it have a great potential!

SIGNAL 1. NonLags (HMA's) all same colour (Red Short, Green Long) Risky to enter here, need larger stop loss and trend may reverse and continue in other direction. ENTRY 2. Wait for price to return to EMA and close in direction of trade below EMA for Short and above EMA for Long If we wait for reverse to EMA, can have smaller stop loss, and higher probability, less false entries. 3. Check HMA's still right colour If they are not this is indication price trend may not be following through. EXITS 1. Price touches a Pivot point Price gets magnetised to these points, (these can be Daily PP, R1,2,3, S1,2,3, Mid points, Open, yesterdays High, or Close) ALL these points tend to be either stop and reverse, stop and consolidate, or slow, reverse, then continue) Either way good exit point. If candles are strongly going down or up to the pivot point, or if HMA's all stay right colour consider holding to see if price goes to next pivot point especially if its a mid pivot point. Notice even the trade I mentioned earlier where i missed the 20 pips and exited for 5, it did go on to the R1 pivot point (shown on chart for short entry) 2. SIGNAL OTHER WAY consider exiting if 2 of the 3 HMA's turns wrong color, but wait for candle close as the colour changes during the candle as it moves. STOP LOSS I start with 15, and when 7-10 pips in profit move SL to 10 pips. Tend to use 15 pips on GBPUSD and 10-12 pips on EURO. If we wait for the EMA retrace stops are hardly ever looked at, exits will then tend to be for a few pips or break even at worst if the trade doesn't follow through. TAKE PROFIT - 2-3 pips away from the pivot you are trading towards, but watch in case you miss by 1 pip. If it misses by 5 pips or more it usually comes back for another go.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
dont like to set fix SLs....each trade might need a individual stop loss regarding S+R levels. do the check. phanti

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Nice work, but wheres the template?

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Hi Julie, Thank you for posting your system! Are the pivot indicators as you posted them set to the settings that you use? I'm using a later version of TzPivots on my charts, BTW (the ones from THV4 - attached here, if you're interested). They're supposed to be improved. Regards, Spot

Stop losses and take profits as always would be personal preference and personal trading styles. I am only stating what I am using, as i said this may change as we forward test it. And it may change for different currencies. I developed this system specifically for its small stop loss, and higher probability of success and not hitting stops often. Just pick any day, late Asian-London session, the EMA entry after the signal nearly always results in trade going in the right direction, and not going towards the stop much at all. That's the beauty of the wait for EMA. Just while I was typing this there was a trade on the pound, immediately after entering price continued in the right direction, not even 1 pip towards my stop. Now to decide whether to take profit at Open or wait for R1, it looked like it may form a pin bar so I took profit at Open for 20 pips. Stop Loss size may not make much difference if the system proves to be reliable. But looking at the trade I just did, if price had reversed and went to a stop loss of 23 pips (being just above the recent high) it most likely would have signaled a new entry long or the 2 HMA exit, so would have exited before that anyway. If price moved very quickly against me as it does sometimes, I still would prefer a smaller stop loss, this i also why I move the sl to 10 pips once in profit. So I am still happy with 15 pips at present on the pound.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
15 pips is huge. keep on.

I apologise, I have tried so hard to get my templates off my metatraders but for some stupid reason they do not show in the list when i try to copy the tpl file. This is very annoying to me cos if I change metatraders I have to make new templates. Only a few show up there and not the ones I want. Even though they show up fine in my metatrader platform. I have a new pc and windows 7, using GoTrader MT4 but its the same on the Askobid platform too. OK found a work around I saved it to the desktop folder instead of the template directory Doh! I would still like to know why i cant see them all in the normal template folder. But anyway here is my template - Market open is set for my time Perth West Aussie and please note the default hours in the market open indicator are not correct I don't think for any timezone. I changed NY, Tokyo and London and Sydney to my timezone. The pivots default to Tokyo open I haven't changed that.

Hi Julie, One method of setting stops is to divide your position into 3: 1 .Take Profit on one portion at a specific amount (or distance from entry); then move SL on remaining two positions to just above/below your entry (i.e.: break-even). 2. Take Profit on second portion at another location (i.e.: Exit one portion at Open for 1st portion; then exit second portion at R1). 3. Use a trailing stop on last portion, or let it run and get out as you please. See Mark Douglas' book, "The Disciplined Trader"... an excellent book. I will likely evntually use this type of exit strategy as I get used to your system, but right now, I'm just trying it out with your suggested exits. BTW... do you ever re-enter if the trend looks like it's about to pick up again? - i.e.: if price bounces back off the MA and the Hulls line up back into trend; or, if price breaks another major level? Thanks again for sharing your system, Julie! - Just yesterday I wrote down what I was looking to create in a system (I'm constantly researching and trying things out). Your points 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 10 are my major requirements (especially the first point!). I've been trying your method out this morning during London-New York overlap (this is my time zone) on GBPUSD, GBPJPY, GBPAUD, and EURJPY. So far, I've managed to capture a few pips on each of the pound crosses (25+ pips on GU and GY; still riding GA - currently at 25 pips as I type; these are all with spread taken into account). What's great is that your system has kept me out of EURJPY, whereas I was whipsawed pretty bad on it this morning on a system I created yesterday and was trying out this morning too (see why your point # 1 is the most important to me!). Regards, Spot

Now I'm not that trusting.. But very similar to other charts i watch...NiceGuy, NiceGuy w Ribbon(Marcuss chart),....nice entry for quick pips. Good job Julie1585 +do your thing....don't listen to the sudden appearance of the coaches cheers goldsurfer

--- 帖子 #19 ---
Yes I have used this method too, but as i don't want to be in the market while the price decides what its doing at the pivot, happy to take all at pivot. yes I haven't covered the re entries yet but once a trend is developed its easy to re-enter next time it touches the EMA and closes back in the right direction as long as colours of NonLag's are holding strong. I assumed the GBP and EUR crosses would be good too, but I found I was stuffing up my testing by having too many charts open while I was developing the system. So I focus on GBP and a little on the EURO. The crosses can produce more pips, but have higher spreads . Do you co-relate the pairs, so that you have the Majors open and look at direction of say GBPUSD and USDJPY if both going same way, then the trade on GBPJPY should be good. I bought a system that taught co-relation trading but I haven't traded any of the crosses much.

To find your saved templates, go to the Templates folder and then click the "Compatibility Files" menu bar on the upper side of your windows explorer

I looked for an example for a day the system doesn't produce many pips, and found that at least on that day it also doesn't produce too many losers. 25th Mar, there were at least 12 signals but only 3 valid entries, one Break even trade and one -7 pips and one +22 pips. You can see price going above and below the EMA many times whereas in a good trend price mostly stays on the right side. Example of good day following

--- 帖子 #22 ---
This example gave 156 pips for the day, 30th Mar, no losers. 4 signals, multiple valid entry points. Notice price touching 20 EMA then bouncing along it. There were more entries but I discounted some if they are too close to a pivot point and don't give the trade room to mature. Those I disqualified have a blue box highlighting why they were disqualified.

--- 帖子 #23 ---
what kind of moving average magenta one?

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Oh thank you so much. Such a simple fix for a very annoying problem.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
20 EMA set to close. I go that idea from the http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...=285131&amp;page=1 - he uses 18 EMA with Momentum Indi on 1 hour, so while i was trying to make it fit a smaller time frame I noticed that price often bounces along the 18-20 ema in all timeframes 5m+ The 20 EMA basically ends up being your trend line. Looking at todays GU you almost don't need any other indicators just go long above 20 ema and short below it. lol Can't get much simpler than that. And it produced about 140 pips today.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
thanks bro

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Julie, Good job with your method. I may be wrong but this looks a lot like bounce trades from the 20EMA and in that respect is very related to the CHOROS thread (although we mainly use the 10 ema, 35 sma and 50ema there). We also use Pivots a lot. Your novelty of using the Hulls as filtering is very interesting. Kostas.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
lol, I be a sis

--- 帖子 #29 ---
I'm impressed ;D Thanks julie.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
ha sry .... i call everyone bro ...doesnt matter if its a him,her or even an animal

--- 帖子 #31 ---
Julie, thank you for your system. Here is a question: what if after we have a signal and trigger candle forms (rejection of EMA20) - one or more NonLagMa indicators change color, is signal still valid or they should be the same color?

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Anyone get this entry on the pound today? 91 pips if you stayed for the full ride, I missed it. You can see on the chart the signal was right on European Open (Tokyo Close) and entry just after London open. After a horrible Asian session I got disgruntled and left the pound and started looking at the Euro instead. I did do a couple of small pound trades during Asian session, but I am going to put a big sign on my screen, GO DO SOMETHING ELSE DURING ASIAN SESSION.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Julie, the big move was only because of major news for GBP. In your first post you said to be careful at news time. So you had taken the trade regardless the news? PS: On my chart the color for the first MA was yellow at the candle close you pointed at. So no entry... Cheers, Olarion

--- 帖子 #34 ---
I agree. All three weren't green until the close of the big candle. It appears the same on Julie's chart.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
100 % fundamental...worked with any system

--- 帖子 #36 ---
Good question, I have two answers to this. Firstly IF there was a strong signal earlier as there was on the big pound one, and the entry comes later without the 2 big NonLag's are changing colour to me that signifies good entry, strong trend in place. I don't like to enter if candle is wrong colour, and NonLag is wrong colour. The higher NonLag's never changed colour - good sign. This candle was also closing above the MR1 so to me perfect entry point. For instance would not enter on the smaller green candle in the red patch on NonLag, nor the bearish engulfing candle next to it. That's why the entry is the bullish candle above MR1 and NonLag is not red. Short answer, yes to yellow, if other factors support it. Secondly - the Non Lag Indicator that is not in a separate window actually doesn't show the yellow and I did toy with the idea of having the NonLag's on chart instead of separate so we don't get the yellow. I may go back to having the small NonLag's on chart and re-organising colours.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Firstly 'be careful' doesn't mean don't trade, to me it means tighten stops, be aware, watch more carefully. I saw this trade after the fact as I mentioned I missed it and was asking if anyone else got it. Don't trade if you prefer not to, surely you would make your own decisions regarding fundamental/news trading, I only put that in to remind people to be aware of the fact that news will/may affect the trades. I tried to make the rules as simple as possible and I could add 3 or 4 more rules around yellow colour, news, also add in candle patterns etc but I wanted a system with simple colour coded entry and few rules. I don't do fundamentals and don't care what caused the move, I am however happy the system showed a valid entry, albeit confused slightly by the yellow factor. I have to admit I prefer 2 colour NonLag's and the NON separate one shows it as a valid entry. Actually if you look very closely and zoom on a colour change candle the marker is half way thru the center of the candle and it is yellow on the left and green on the right, I read that as green, meaning at the close it turned green. So entry is at close/entry of next. I have been counting those candles where it changes as the colour of the change, if that makes sense.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Is this considered a setup now on eurgbp?

--- 帖子 #39 ---
After some screen time with these indicators, I found out that It would be useful, imho, if NonLagMA_separate indicator would be displayed like some small rectangles or something in one gorizontal line, it's more visual frendly, imho, because in real time it is hard to see whith what colors last candle closed and candle which is forming currently.

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Firstly thank you to all who have looked at and commented on this system. I really appreciate people who are taking a look and giving me some feedback. What I would like is for people who are trading the system either demo or live to post their charts and results showing entry and exits. I would also like to see charts of trades on different currencies and times if you think the system works on that currency. If anyone has suggestions for better settings for the NonLag's or even the EMA for a particular currency feel free to add your input. Stop losses used and take profit/exit ideas also welcome. But please be specific. Phanti mentioned my stop loss I thought the was saying it was too small, turned out after a number of posts he thinks its too big lol. Wish I had known, I spent time assessing a larger stop loss, didn't realise he wanted it smaller. Anyway I now tend to agree after another few days of trading will probably amend it to 10-12 pips even for the pound. If it proves feasible it may go to 8 who knows, why don't you guys give it try and see how you go. It does sort of depend on your entry compared to candles entry, and also if a pivot point close by etc so can be adjusted and I do adjust mine. 15 pips seemed to be a cover all and worked for most trades. But if you look away, news happens and your sl gets taken 15 pips is a lot I agree. The more people that try the system and try different currencies/times/settings the better off we will be. I don't really want more indicators unless they are particularly apt for this system and can be colour coded

--- 帖子 #41 ---
Attached indicator will solve the "yellow block" issue.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Use this setting to "straighten" the indicator in the indicator window.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
No, it doesn't make sense. At the close of that candle you don't know if it will be green at the close of the next candle or not. You can't know that until the next candle closes. I think you're trying too hard to make a winner out of a set up that would be a no trade under your original rules. That trade would have been entered a few minutes before a major news announcement. There is no way to "be careful". You either trade into news or you don't. That move could have just as easily gone the other way and gaped below your stop, particularly if you had tightened it up.

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Now with new indicator, thank you Gleneagles,we can see that on the close of that rejection candle all nonlagMAs where green. P.S. Gleneagles, do you have the version of the indicator where yellow dots available? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
hi glen, in this indicator , wich lenght do you use ? thank's

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Sorry , this is the only one I have.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
It comes from a different trading system so the settings may not be optimal. I have not tested it on a 5M system, I just converted the settings to apply to a 5M chart. Best is to stick with julie`s settings until it can be established that other settings work better. This can only be done through proper back/forward testing.

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Gleneagles the trailing dots which indicator is that and the setting? im confused from the lot i have?

--- 帖子 #49 ---
ok lord ! I try ! today I 3X 12 ! :-) but I wont improve the stop! for now I use 20 pp fixed !

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Candle entry proven to be valid many times over. Not trying too hard, just noticed entry and asked question, only discussed it cos someone asked if yellow was valid. News is news, stay out or stay in, I don't advocate either - I have no opinion on news trading and have taken out the offending "BE CAREFUL" note from the rules post. I don't do fundamentals.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
Nice thread Julie. I cannot see the HMA in your zipped file on the 1st page, can you or anyone please provide a link or post this indi, also what settings do you use on the HMA. A quick point that was raised a few posts ago about tight stops I would agree that's the way to go with this method ( I trade a fairly similar method) as I use to have larger stops but as a fulltime trader I've realised that when an entry is not good better to exit the trade or use a tight stop as this method lends it self to that. If entry is timed well you should see price move in your direction fairy quickly, in fact if price does not move so fast in my direction than I prefer to exist the trade early.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Thank you its it great, just attaching to chart now, its actually exactly what I wanted when i was setting up my template. I looked for a bit and made do with the one I had. This is gonna make trades so much easier to identify.

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Hi kdx, It is in there its called NonLag MA_Separate but you dont need it now use the new one Gleneagles provided its great. Put 3 on the chart set to 15, 30, 50 and on common tab put fixed min 1 and fixed max 2. its soo cool.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Hull MA is quite different from NLMA (Non Lag MA) . The indicators posted and used are NLMA. I am sure it was just typo mentioning Hull in the thread title

--- 帖子 #55 ---
My thoughts exactly. And when I follow the rules it works well. Except it is troublesome in Asian market but as I am awake and its my daytime I am itching to trade - tried today and won a few. Need to be quick with exits at pivots as it retraces fast at times and doesn't always touch.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Thanks appreciate you taking out the time to reply. I think you are right as I quickly scanned through the thread again it must have been a typing error. Thanks

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Thanks for pointing that out, no I didn't know, they look so a like on the chart and seem to change colour at the same time so I presumed it was just someone renaming the indicator. gee will have to change all my posts to take out HMA and put in Non Lag lol.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
I just Googled to try to find formulae, or even plain-text description, of NLMA, but couldn't. Lots of MT4 code, which can be reverse-translated, but do you know of a source for description? Thanks, OQ.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Attached chart shows Hull MA and NLMA both settings 50 on 5M chart. You can see from the histogram that they are quite different.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Julie, on most of the trades you entered right after the 3 MAs have the same color...why did you not wait for the pullback? Have you changed the rules? ENTRY 2. Wait for price to return to EMA and close in direction of trade below EMA for Short and above EMA for Long Cheers, Olarion

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Hi QQ, Let me see what I can find.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
got a long signal on gbpusd and eurusd. closed eurusd +50.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Thanks. All I could find is, like, this generic: "This indicator tries to remove the typical moving average effect lagging effect using a decaying cosine wave that determines the magnitude of the coefficients in the equation of a Linearly Weighted Moving Average (LWMA)." (from http://www.fxstreet.com/metatrader/a...6-5ff82573def2 ) So you're spot on saying these are very different than Hulls. On the basis of the abover, they're probably more in the digital filter family. It's the "oscillator" part that really has me interested, though.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Yes , you are correct. Various versions of MA`s or the calculation thereof exist. The idea is to remove or reduce the lagging effect. Try ALMA as a search prompt or ALMA MA. The difference is in the calculation or method of calculation. Arnaud Legoux is suppose to be an expert on MA , google him. I don`t dig too deep into the mechanics of the stuff , it keeps me awake at night

--- 帖子 #65 ---
um no, pretty sure all had a pullback, new chart shows what I mean. We get a signal often it is hard to enter on this signal as price has moved away from EMA so wait for pull back and enter once its passed EMA and closed on the side we want to trade, check the NonLags are the right colour, enter at close of candle. I also prefer candle to be the colour needed for trade. If its wrong colour I wait for next candle cos sometimes this means its reversed. If its a continuation and no opposite signal has been given can just trade the next pullback taking the first signal as still valid. Sometimes price hasn't moved away except for the signal candle and it immediately reverses on next couple of candles, the trade in the middle for 15 pips was like this, i took the entry line off so you can see the candle went thru EMA then closed other side of EMA so can enter there. Although it was right on yesterdays low line so actually not good entry but I thought it looked very bearish.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
Excellent can you post charts to show us your trades, entries and exits Looking at Euro now and wondering what other entry point I can use as pullbacks didn't come back to EMA. Could step off the pivot points I suppose, but I don't usually like using pivots as entries, I use them as exits. Ideas anyone for this current 65 pip move - got a signal but never touched EMA not once lol. Seems to be bouncing off the 10 EMA.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
hmm, might explain a different problem I was wondering about. My original system (with HMA's) seemed to get more pips, will have to look more closely at this issue. Can you please post the HMA you have that is separate like the NonLag I only have HMA's for on chart. Thank you so much for your help with the indi's.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Hi I really like your trading system. Have you tried it with AUD USD pair? Regards Bloo

--- 帖子 #69 ---
I did for a second and a half, I don't like the Aussie, I keep having a go cos I live there (which is sentimental I know) but I find it often moves in the same directions often as Euro and GBP but for much less pips. But as I said not really perservered with it.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Thanks. My thoughts Exactly. Although I don't live there. Reg Bloo

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Hey Can you also add Buyers and Sellers info to your template. That can be quite helpful at times. Reg Bloo

--- 帖子 #72 ---
this is one way

--- 帖子 #73 ---
julie, yes, sometimes you don't get a pullback on the breakout, does present question as to how to enter trade. i entered on the next candle pullback to 13 ema. i don't know how to post charts.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
Here it is.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
hi julie, on eur usd signal for short now on m5 but not london session !

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Change first NLMA period to 4 or 5 or add another indicator with setting 4 or 5. The pullbacks will trigger a short signal in an uptrend and a long signal in a downtrend. If the trend continues, the short indicator settings ( 4 or 5) will quickly roll over again as is evident on the chart. You can now take the next "confirmed" signal 3 or 4 blocks again. Possible re-entries marked on the chart. The advantage is that you are entering when the trend resumes , not during a retrace and a possible reversal. Edit: Just a suggestion, if you prefer to enter on a retrace , stick with what you are comfortable with.

Hi, yeah I should be in bed, its nearly 2 am, that's why I don't trade this session and I have no experience trading it. Pullback occurring now, its probably going to go back to pivot, will probably have to wait and see what it does at the pivot.

Funny... I don't like the CAD, but I live there... I've had a go a few times, but it doesn't move enough for me on short TFs with the spread. I prefer AUD over CAD!... Yesterday you asked me about correlating the pairs. I tend to trade AUDUSD, EURUSD, and GBPUSD, for their lower spreads positive correlation with each other (a move in all 3 can confirm overall sentiment). Lately, though, I've had a lot of trouble with AUD. As I prefer 5min TF, I've been getting whipsawed on AUDUSD, then missing out on the burst after getting scared away. I'm not a fan of USDJPY or USDCHF. I've just started experimenting with GBPAUD, and so far I like it a lot. Once it gets going, boy does it move. It's interesting to watch, because I've been able to see which currency has influenced it the most: sometimes it is AUD, and at other times it is GBP. I find it to be positively correlated to GBPUSD, which makes sense, so if there's a move on GBP, it will move with that. However, if AUD is in play, it will be negatively correlated with AUDUSD. I've noticed that GBPUSD, GBPAUD, and GBPJPY work nicely with your system. I'm going to focus more on those, as I like their big movements. During London and New York sessions, the spreads are low enough for the moves they make (I'm with Oanda ). I'm staying away from AUDUSD right now, and I'm on the fence with EURUSD. I'll post some charts later. I'm working on them. I got burned on my first two trades this morning on GBPJPY and GBPAUD, so I stayed out to work on some filtering methods. Of course, in working on that, I missed out on the huge move on GY that followed! (the one that stopped out my short)... BTW... do you always wait for a pullback to the EMA? - Do you forfeit the move if there is no pullback?

--- 帖子 #80 ---
That looks interesting for strong trend entries. Will have a look at that tomorrow. Thanks

I hate watching a trade move very fast and I am not in it, but I am trying to Trade a system and not just hop in and chase a move. With the 5 minute charts at least it wont take too long for another signal and/or entry in. Gleneagles see post 76 has suggested a possible alternative if no pullback and good trend by using the NonLag set to 4 or 5 and using them to get back in. Looks good will look in more depth tomorrow.

Hi Julie and other group members, I’ve done some searching and found another NonLag EMA SW indicator in dot form (or “lights” as the style is known in the THV forum, from such indicators as the MTF Trix and SwissArmy). This indicator I’m attaching here is called MTF_NonLagMA_v7.1 SW.mq4, and it includes the yellow-coloured transition period between green and red that we’ve become familiar with. I’ve compared it against the original NonLag_MA Separate.ex4 indicator that julie1585 provided, and it matches. You will need to change the colours (if you don’t want to be confused), as this indicator was designed for a different trading system which uses non-standard colours for up and down. The pre-set colours are,: Aqua = our Yellow (transition), Dark Violet = our Green (up), and Yellow = our Red (down). I suppose you could always change the colours in the mq4 file, via the editor, so you don’t have to keep changing it whenever you attach the indicator to a chart. I also retrieved another MTF NonLag MA used for that system, which puts 4 time frames in one window, but you cannot adjust the time frames, just the period. This indicator is not needed for TrendPipper, but I include it here for anyone who wants to play around with it. The filename is MTF_NonLagMAv7.1_4TF_Bar.mq4. IMPORTANT: you need the standard NonLagMA_v7.1.mq4 indicator (and .ex4 file too) in your indicator folder in order for either of these two SW indicators to work. You don’t need to attach it your chart, but you definitely must have it in your indicators folder (and do not change the name), as the other two indicators are dependent on it being there. If you don’t have it in the folder, the SW indicators will cause your MetaTrader to hang when you attach them to your chart. Import all the attached indicators to your MT4 experts/indicators folder. Attach the MTF_NonLagMA_v7.1 SW indicator to your chart, and put in the TrendPipper settings (i.e.: Length = 15, etc). Make sure to leave TimeFrame at 0, as that is the current time frame of your chart, but you can play around with other time frames (though that is not needed for Julie’s system). You will need one window for 15, another for 30, and a third for 50. Enjoy! Spot007

hi julie, i have a couple of custom indicators that should help your system.

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Thank you Spot for those, will give it a whirl. What's the difference btw, any improvement on the ones we have? I really don't want the yellow in my inidi so I probably won't use it, but will look at the mtf version. Cheers, J

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Thanks Pipdude, they could be useful for some. Need to put the EMA to 20 for both, then it changes the candle colour as the price crosses and closes over the EMA. We don't want 20 and 21 as is in the default as this is a MA crossover and not part of my system. I tried them out, but I like to see my real candles as i am a Steve Nison convert and can't help look at candle patterns now. But thanks for those, some people might find it very useful and I like that is it colour coded Cheers, J

julie, settings for that indicator are 1 20 1 1 0 0 0 0

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Some people were asking Gleneagles if he had one that showed the yellow. I was hesitant to try his version, as I like having the yellow too. It shows that the indicator is about to turn around. The SW indicator that I attached gives the same signals as your original Separate Window indicator. I suppose it's a matter of preference! I included the MTF version for anyone who wants to play around with it. I haven't done anything with it yet...

Hi all, Anyone trading this system today? I only traded GU, system seems to be holding up, IF stick to the rules. And that's the issue I need to deal with still. I am not disciplined with my trading, but if I keep proving to myself the system works by hi-lighting the trades each day I will eventually get it through my thick head. Please don't pick on me for the news trade (lol), I forgot to check as I had visitors, was expecting the 4.25/4.30 candle to be an entry candle, my mouse was poised on MYFX TradeManager, to enter at close and I just saw a flash of red and my finger just clicked on the trade the second the smaller candle closed, which also happened to be news release time, the exact second I clicked lol. There was a big pause and my entry turned up half way down the chart but my 10 pips sl held and it went on to add 30 pips in my account (26 pips if trade taken at close of candle as per system). This is a small micro account with some left over funds in I am using at the moment. So it should give real action not just demo trading. Not sure I would have actually taken it, had I waited for close, the candle being so large and it closed on today's open so not great entry point, but the system did prove it to be correct to enter at the close and as I was actually in the trade I included it. I am going to do these charts daily, if only to prove to myself sticking to the rules makes pips. Whether you actually take the trade the system suggests or not is entirely up to your sense of trading at the time. I did not take a couple of entries, as they were too close to a pivot point. Am finding I am late to the party sometimes and my entries are on top of a largish candle, this is not ideal so one trade I put in a pending order at my preferred entry point to get a better fill and that worked well too. The system made 80 pips (and I just closed another trade on GU for 10 pips), but not counting that if you take off 2 pips per trade for spread (mine is sometimes more and sometimes less) and 2 pips for exits being 2 pips away from pivot that's 20 pips off for the 5 trades, so feasible to have made 60 pips today. Tomorrow my goal is: 1. Trade this system, only this system, and stick to the rules. 2. Close trades with 2 NLMA wrong colour preferably before sl hit. 3. TP at Pivot points. 4. Make 30 pips profit. Anyone want to compete with me to see how many pips they get on GU trading this system to the rules? Might help me be disciplined and I always love a competition. J

--- 帖子 #101 ---
I'll compete with you tomorrow! I'm half way 'round the world from you, though, so you'll have a head start. I could use a dose of discipline myself, btw... I traded GY this morning (New York time zone): executed a Long at 10:00, EST. Did not wait for a true pullback, and also waited for a better feeling that price was breaking out of consolidation. I exited around 10:52 EST, just below the Open pivot point (which was 139.50), and netted about 52 pips, with spread factored in. Entry: 138.903 Exit: 139.422 I missed the move on GU, and did not take any more trades since. I may trade tonight (early Asian session, if markets are active and setups look favourable). There's Employment Change and Unemployment Rate coming out in Oz, so there may be some movement for a while. Spot

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Hi Spot, Excellent, glad you are able to make use of the system. So we're on for tomorrow. I just need to trust my system, every day it proves to me it works, yet I don't stick to the rules. Tomorrow morning I may go thru a few weeks and see when is the most opportune time to start trading the system to try define a GMT start time. Will look at volume and candle size and of course profitable/non profitable trades. Oh after I do my tax, I must do that first. J

I'm in on your forex day parade !! Just one question, when i was trading the system today i noticed when price comes comes down to the 20 ema one of NON LAG's turn red most of the time . This made me gun shy a couple times today. But as soon price took of from that area it was a good trade and turned back green. Is their anyway to tweek these NON LAG's ?

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Hi Julie, After the lags turn red or green, what if the price never re-traces to 20ema? We don't have a trade then? Thanks TradeStar

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Used a fixed TP of 15 pips . 6/6 90 pips Pity I only trade 3 days a week otherwise I would have taken up the challenge!

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Geo, Have you tried playing around with the settings to see if they can be tweaked? You could probably try playing around with the "Price" setting, which is usually the type (i.e.: smooth, simple, weighted, etc). I'm not sure what the "filter" setting does, but it is something that you could try. I also posted a multi time frame version of the NonLag yesterday, which is the one that I use. Although I'm just using the standard settings as provided by Julie, you could download and install that indicator and play around with different time frame settings to see if that helps... If you figure something out, please share! Spot

--- 帖子 #107 ---
Next time you see it can you post the chart so I can see what you mean. I think I understand. I think you mean the 15 NLMA, top one on my chart, yes it often goes the opposite colour you want during the pullback (because it is the most sensitive) but if you don't wait for this to change it can mean the pullback is actually a reversal and it keeps you out of the trade. As for tweaking, I was playing around with filter to get rid of the 1 block entries in the middle of trends but ended up putting it back to default 0. I also tried changing the NLMA numbers, 10 instead of 15, 20 instead of 30 etc but again went back to the ones I have been using. But this is all on GBPUSD, I am mainly just studying that and want to get the settings right and be happy with them before adjusting for a different currency. I also tried adding another EMA but actually the system works just fine as it is for GBPUSD, sure it misses some trends but it does catch a lot of pips each day and not many losing trades. The area I am disappointed in is when I originally started this template/system I had it set so it was catching long trends, i have some charts saved somewhere and they had 50-80 pips trades on them. So whether I had different settings or indicators or perhaps I wasn't always intending to exit at first pivot point, not sure. I should have made notes as I was going along but I didn't, it just sort of evolved. I will try to find the charts tomorrow and see if I can see the indicator settings on them. Oh geez, its 3.30 am g'nite J

--- 帖子 #108 ---
This was a problem we had the other day on EURUSD, see post 76 http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...0&amp;postcount=76 Gleneagles suggested adding a smaller NLMA set to 4 or 5 to catch small pullback, or could enter on green candle after the reds, or add a 10 ema, but I haven't been looking at Euro much, and haven't decided yet if we need it. If it happens a lot then we should look at adding something in permanently. But sometimes the move is just a sudden strong move and I don't see how we can catch those, if there is no retrace.

Thanks now go to bed! lol Have been perusing your thoughts for a few days now. Like what I'm seeing. Will set up my charts soon so I can start monitoring. Will promise you many stupid questions, however I will try to only ask them once. (unless my a.d.h.d. kicks in ). Thanks for your time. Darryl

Hi Julie, I'm with IG Markets using IT-Finance platform (not MT4). They don't have Non Lag MA or Hull MA indicators. I found one from ProRealTime website but it can only do the Sq-Root numbers (such as 4, 16, 36) MA. Is that the same with yours? TA! E.T

Hello everyone, i just started reading about this strategy yesterday and i put it to test today. I have added Bollenger Band and 200ema. My goal is to be consistent and make 10/15 pips a day. My first trade was successful. I waited for the pull back at the 20ema after the breakout of lower Bollenger Band. I also draw a blue trend line of previous support turned resistance. I took my profit at 200 ema. STOP - 1.4328 Enter - 1.4322 Exit - 1.4312 10 pip profit.

Hi ET, No one seems to know what the Math is behind the Non Lag, it has been pointed out it is different from Hull but I started to test this theory and found the Hull coloured wave moves drastically around depending on which setting you use even for the one constant of 50. More on this later. For now all I can suggest is open a demo MT4, set up template and watch for trades, then enter on your platform. I believe many people trade this way if their platform is non Mt4. I have done it myself when I was with FXCM . J PS I replied to your pm before I saw the thread so ignore me asking you to post to thread

Ok took me a while to see your point, cos to me it looks like a classic example of a perfect trade. Moving away from EMA after the ENTRY candle is a good thing, it means trend is strong and holding. Entry was after a perfect pullback to 30 EMA. more aggressive entry on the first red after pullback but I find some of these are not reliable, most reliable is when all NonLags are red, you give up a few pips, but in return less losing trades and stops rarely encountered. Does that answer your question? The only issue I have with moving away from EMA is the SIGNAL candle, it is often far away and this is why we wait for pullback, after that we hope it moves away as long as we are in the trade. Sometimes it doesn't pullback and we get left out. That is something I will look at when I have more time. The main reason I wait for pullback and not enter on signal is to keep SL small. Notice if you enter on signal you need a larger stop loss and often have to sit and worry thru the trade being negative, is it going to turnaround or not? If we wait it doesn't necessarily get us a better entry price but it does mean it usually doesn't turn around on us more than a couple of pips. And you don't have to make decisions, stay in or get out only to find it does turn around right after your stop gets hit. (oh dear brings back bad memories!!) The SIGNAL tells me which direction SHORTS: EMA = resistance and the PIVOTS = support. LONGS: EMA = support and PIVOTS = resistance. Use the EMA angle for confirmation and stay out of trades where price moves above and below EMA and EMA is flat. Notice after London closed, the flat EMA, smaller candles, lower volume . In a word Yukky! Gee wasn't I s'posed to be doing my tax this morning lol. Anything to get out of that. J

Hi 50 cents. Nicely traded as it fell away from the MR1. Trade entries that coincide with these pivot points can work out really well. Can I just point out for people learning my system it is not exactly to my rules as it didn't cross the EMA. Sometimes price hits a resistance and drops away but then continues back to EMA, see chart example here the other day on EURO. Similar entry to yours today but it retraced 13 pips after rejecting a mid pivot. After pullback to ema entry price is slightly better and earlier entry probably would have been stopped out if using 10-15 pips depending on spread and fill. Sometimes at the pullback to EMA it just keeps on going, so my system is for price to cross it and close back under the EMA for confirmation. Thank you for posting your trade. Please continue to post as we can all learn from each other. J

Hi guys, I'm in the New York time zone, so I haven't begun trading yet. I've been trying to get up around 5:00 - 6:00 my time to catch the juicy movements in the London morning session, but it can be challenging, depending on what time I get to bed the night before. I slept in today. There's been some pretty scary swings with the EUR and GBP news today, so I'm happy to have stayed out! I will wait until the markets settle down a bit... Anyway... I thought I'd share something which may be helpful to you. I've added a couple filters to my charts: the ADX and the Momentum indicators. Added 14 period ADX (standard MT4 indicator). I love the ADX. It’s is a wonderful indicator on its own. It can be good at signaling entries, but not necessarily for exits. Makes for a decent filter, which I typically use it for. 10-period Momentum: it signals Long when above 0 (or centreline, depending on which version one is using); Short when below 0. I’m using the version Momentum-ZL.ex4 (attached here, if anyone wants it). I do not use the ADX and Momentum as entry signals on TrendPipper, just direction filters. If one or both of them don’t match with what the other indicators are saying, then it is safer to wait until they line up. I've pretty much made the ADX a standard component of my charts, no matter what system I'm using. See attached chart. Well... good trading today! Spot

Hi Pipdude, Great trade, you got the whole trend. But what is your exit criteria? Cos there were three exits when all the Non Lags changed colour, and your candles changed also.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Hi Spot, I actually had the MOM indicator in my original template for this system. I had got the idea from the MA + Momentum thread for 1h. But I had dropped it I think when I ended up with 3 Non Lags, as it didnt seem to filter out actual trades. let me know if it saves you from entering bad trades. note: it has very large arrows (which you can turn off) and a very loud alert on as default which thankfully you can also turn off. I tried altering the defaults but it wouldn't let me save it. here is the colour coded one for you

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Thanks for the indi, Julie! - I like the two colours. I've been using ADX for a while now, but got the idea for adding Momentum as well from another system. When I look at my charts now, yes, it does appear that having the Momentum may not be necessary, as the NonLags do an excellent job. I think I'll remove it to save some space, but will keep the ADX. London-New York overlap is crazy this morning. Have not made any trades since logging in. The swings are way too fast and large for my comfort (not that there have been any good signals anyway on account of those swings). I wonder if options have anything do with this... However, there is a Long move in play on GBPAUD that I've missed: as I type ths, it's up around 50 pips over where I would have entered. The good stuff seems to have happened overnight during my time zone... so no competition from me today... you win!

Haha, no winners here. I got 2 losses before news, my stops got taken, one was badly placed other just touched then bounced off it, I jumped back in short and got my money back on the big news candle.I seem to trade the news candles better than my system lol. After that each candle it was like 20 pips stretching from one daily pivot to the mid pivot. Crazy. I drifted off and went back to test NonLag settings, there are 6 variables for price so I presume they are moving averages of some sort, the 0 we are using still seems to be the best. J

When euro interest rates get changed, and that major pair is supposed to start a new down trend (daily &amp; weekly charts) the entire market tends to respond like a crack smokin' teenager with a major hormonal imbalance. Other than that, it's trading as normal. I've put on 8 trades this week prior to today. Today, no trades. I'm also a tech trader, but sometimes, no matter how good your analysis &amp; record is, fundies will mess you up, but only if you trade during those rare times like today or nfp. totally imho

Hiya Geo, well done. No trade on my chart price didn't go thru EMA and mine seems to be in a very different place and angle to yours. Is your moving average 20 EMA? Actually not sure which line of yours is the EMA, cos the green one is nothing like mine. But as long as you know thats all that matters. But so glad people are making pips from this system. Nite all, J

Julie, my 20 EMA is the red line inside the channel. The green is the 50 EMA which i use. Its a habit of having it on any chart i trade. Like to only take longs above it and shorts below the 50 EMA. Not trying to change your system. When i post future chart i will leave it off !! lol Have a great day..

--- 帖子 #154 ---
There was a huge uptrend in Majors after last week's NFP... lots of pips to be made, and this system would have assited with that! But agreed.... your crack smokin' teenager analogy is appropriate for today...

This looks like a very good system. It would be nice if someone would come up with an idea for an alert when opportunities are looming. Watching the 5 min all day will make us blind! Thanks.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
I'm sure you are aware that a 60 ema on the 5 min chart is same as 20 ema on 15 min. A close and open on the other side of the 60 ema can be a good signal for a trend change.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
thanks for reply julie, yes set my tp at pivot line(ms1), manage to get 10 pipsi think that i need to keep posting the chart here to train myself

--- 帖子 #159 ---
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ An alert would be cool. What I do to make this endeavor more reasonable is to limit my trading to major market open times. i.e.; Sessions: Asian: 1st 90 minutes Eur/London: 1st 3 hours US: 1st 3-4 hours (btw, I stole this whole time constraint idea) There, of course, are times when the market moves during off times, but who cares? This way you can trade only one, two all three sessions without putting in more than 8 hours. If you really want alerts ask a programmer to work his magic, or start a skype group. When skype msgs come in they have a nice tone to wake you up. Can I steal your slogan? I promise to use it wisely. In return I'll share mine; "With a pure heart, The path is Clear" ~ DW

Hi, I've been searching around a lot but I still cannot figure out how the nonlagma is calculated. I do not know anything about coding, but looking into the code I realise there are several variables such as alfa, g and beta in the calculation. Anyone can look into the code and enlighten me how is the MA calculated? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Julie, Just wondering about the pivot indicator you're using in your template. I've compared a few different pivot indicators and several are in agreement with each other but not quite with the one you're using here (the THV4 TzPivotsD (Black).ex4.) The one on the left in the picture is called vS_PivotsD_v4.mq4 and it seems to me to be the best overall pivot indicator of that group. To compare, both line up on the main pivot point and high and low from yesterday, but most of the other levels are different. Is there a particular reason why you picked the pivot indicator you're using? For instance, is there something about how it calculates the levels that you believe is more accurate? By the way the EURUSD is moving a lot right now, providing a good example of moving around pivot points on these charts.

Hello Julie Great thread! Do you pay attention to the angle of the EMA before entry?

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Thanks!!!

--- 帖子 #172 ---
In the TzPivots, you can choose whether the pivot formula calculates using daily values or fibonacci values. They're usually quite close, but I noticed in the pictures you posted that you have the TzPivots set to Fibonacci, and your vS_Pivots are set to Daily (easy to tell by the central pivot line: "FPV" signifies Fibonacci, while "DPV" signifies Daily). It's a matter of preference, but I've switched mine to Daily since using this system. In case anyone is interested, here are the user manuals for the TzPivots.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Geo, Can you pls share the blue and red indicator below your EMA? Will that help to filter out bad trade?

One of my accounts is linked to a private EA that constantly loses money during new releases but does very well during normal trading times. I'm having a serious language problem with the guy using the EA on my account. Is there anything I can do on my platform to turn this guy and his EA off before new releases and then turn him back on again when I want him to trade my account? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Dynel, I just watched EU break out of the range too just a few mins ago. If you had entered Long an 2 hours ago, you would have been stuck in the range, with the market against you for a while, and of course, stopped out by the revrse seignal on the NonLags. So, what helped you decide to get in now and not then?

--- 帖子 #179 ---
gbpusd long signal entry 1.6357. my entry is more aggressive, julie's pullback entry after signal is more conservative, safer, and better. but i would not take this aggressive approach on a countertrend entry, too risky. i would definitely wait for pullback. my SL is very tight, or breakeven with this more aggressive entry. julie's system is a sound strategy. i like it.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
even the best system is useless if you do not see price action. hope I could help.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Thx Dynel, In your attached image, you highlighted the Bullish Engulfing pattern. Do you use a pattern recognition indicator, or did you draw that in yourself for the purpose of showing an example?

Sanyax, No system is perfect... you must accept that some trades will be losers... Dynel14 has a very valid point, which I often forget: Price Action comes first! BTW... some people use other filtering techniques, if you've read the other posts... (and even then, you may still end up with a bad trade). I like to use the ADX... PS: The market does not care about you. Nor does it care whether you make money or lose money. It does what it wants in the moment. Just because it did something one way in the past does not mean it will do it again now or at some other point in the future. Have no expectations, and you will be happier (easier said than done.. I struggle with that myself every day). I empathize with you, though... I hate whipsaws!

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Sanyax, look at your 20 EMA its flat as a pancake. Make sure when trading off any EMA it had some trend to it !! Good luck &gt;&gt;&gt; See it, Draw it, Trade it ...

--- 帖子 #187 ---
sanyax, i can only offer my opinion, but it's about where and how you've made these entries. first of all, you made a very aggressive short entry on a countertrend trade, which is a risky entry to make. did you wait for candle to close? after signal occurred you didn't wait for move down, and then a pullback. you would have avoided this trade, if you had done so. on long trade, your entry was at the high of the day, a very risky entry, a big no no. you made a very aggressive long entry. did you wait for close of candle? after signal occurred you didn't wait for move up, and then a pullback. you would have avoided this trade, if you had done so. i would not have made these trades to begin with.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
This is what i get for tonight... Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #189 ---
hi sanyax. here's my opinion about your 2 losses: first of all, julie states that you are not supposed to enter at the signal candle, but it's safer to wait for a retrace to the 20 EMA. you entered at the signal candle in both trades. i am finding that this rule MUST ALWAYS be obeyed when signal candle opens AND closes beyond the 20 EMA, because you have a higher probability of sl being hit. i do enter on signal candle only when it opens on one side and closes on the other, provided that candle is not too large, and the close is near the EMA. trade 1 short: besides the above rule, you sold into R2 and into the 60 sma (or coral) - i strongly suggest you add it to your chart -, which provides strong r/s. also, if you check your 15 mn chart, you sold after a doji-hammer which signals a possible downtrend end, and uptrend continuation. trade 2 long: you were way too far from 20ema, and you bought after 2 overly extended bull candles, with hidden divergence (i use RSI set to 6 periods) - price makes a new high, RSI does not. the correct entry could have been 5 candles after your entry - but you had 2 red nolags before, besides divergence and a shooting star on 15mn, so no trade.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
From what I can see there is no need to add loads of new things to the chart which will only confuse someone that is not used to trading. Take the rules, set them in stone and don't try to sell on top of support and don't buy at the high of the day (especially one brought about by high risk news) wait for a pullback to the 20ma. Waiting for a pullback you might think you are missing the boat but that very rarely happens, and if it does, go to another currency and look for another trade.

Hi, first of all thank you very much for sharing this system, I am following and do well with excellent results. My English is not very good, not if I am putting well.

I notice you have the Daily Trading Range indicated in the panel on your chart. The display also indicates the average daily range. At the time you took the trade the high of the day was formed indicated on the the display ie 114 pips. It was only a few pips below the average daily trading range for the pair i.e 121 pips. Taking a trade near the high/low of the trading range when the average daily trading range has been achieved/exceeded or is within 10% of the average range is a low probability trade. The chances that the pair will exceed the average daily range are against you. There is a high probability that PA will retrace or consolidate once the average daily trading range has been hit.

--- 帖子 #196 ---
With regards to your first trade (short) , it appears as if you took this trade 5 minutes before a " Red Alert" economic news announcement. The reading was a lot better than expected causing the sharp upwards spike in the price. Unless you are an experienced news trader and/or gambler rather wait for the PA to settle after the announcement 10M-15M before considering a new position. The time indicated on the calendar is GMT +2 .

Hi all, Sorry I have been absent, been busy getting ready for my trip and flying to Queensland. Hopefully will be able to contribute more now I am set up here on the other side of the country. Thank you all for your contributions, observations and trades, and special thanks to the guys helping others with answers to questions. Your doing a great job with some very helpful answers. It was more up to date one and it has the daily candle and also I liked the labels being on the lines instead of having to mouse over to see which pivot it was. Spot pointed out we need to set the pivot to daily not fibo. I don't think its made it to my rule page yet but yes, when trades are successful you can see the ema was angling in the direction of the trade, a trade often fails if the ema is flat and price is moving above and below the ema. So glad you are getting pips, please don't be shy about posting your successful trades, we can all learn from them and positive confirmation that the system works by many people was one of my main reasons for starting the thread. Trading a system confidently, with discipline is about belief. You need to believe in the system even if it produces a few losers. Because it is often then that we say, bah it doesn't work and move on to a new one just to start the whole process over. The more positive trades we see the more confident we feel and when we see losers we can analyse to see how weed out not so good entries. J

my first trade in real and succes 14 pip

--- 帖子 #211 ---
hi. i missed all the action today. after NY upmove, i was waiting for a pullback. i entered at the hammer, but since in my opinion it was against the rules - 2 red nonlegs had developed, and i felt i anticipated the entry - i bailed out at first sign of weakness at the highs. it would have been a nice trade had i stayed in a little longer, or if i had re-entered at the close of the bull candle. i entered for these reasons: 1) frustration at missing the previous upmove 2) hammer off daily open and pivot 3) hammer breaks previous low, but RSI makes a higher low 4) break of short term TL and immediate 5mn high.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
your entry is good. sure not with this system, but be flexible and look for price action first!!!

Hi Julie and Gang, Thanks Julie for a very straight forward trade system. Read through this thread middle of last week and have traded it Friday and today with good results. +27 x 2lots on Friday and +37 x 2lots today. That is mixed between the EURUSD and GBPUSD , traded between 7am and 11 am EST. Just wanted to share my results so far. Take Care

--- 帖子 #217 ---
I am guessing that your channel is basically two ema's 20 ema high and 20 ema low am I correct? PGPB

--- 帖子 #218 ---
yes, very true. any ideas on how to filter out false entries?

--- 帖子 #219 ---
on that chart i had a 13 ema high, low, close channel, sometimes price doesn't pullback to 20 ema, so i use something tighter to price. i like to use these ema channels with fib no's 8, 13, 21, etc.

--- 帖子 #220 ---
i went back over trade signal for last night's ranging by eurusd. if you would have used most conservative entry method, 3rd arrow, you would have avoided all false entries, except one, next signal would have had a winner. remember, the setup, is a trade signal, not an entry signal. you have to wait and see if setup gives you an entry.

--- 帖子 #221 ---
3rd arrow, wait for close below green line, marking previous low.

Don't mind me pipdude i think you re doing great already.

eurusd and gbpusd breakout around open of asian session short 1.4431 and 1.6328

--- 帖子 #224 ---
both asian and uk sessions opened with breakouts, downside, then upside for eurusd. 2 entries prior to asian open, but after the open, there are entries, but i don't see them matching up with indicators. your entries would have to be aggressive. uk open entries, again don't see any entries that match up with indicators, but aggressive. my entries for gbpusd and eurusd were aggressive, since they were at open of asian and uk, i did so, looking for price action. if you ignored indicators most conservative method entries ok. let me know if i've missed something.

Pipdude, are you using the settings of 1 20 1 1 0 0 0 0 for the MA candles indicator. I notice you are using ema bands looks like you have an ema 20 set to high and the lower one set to the low at both sides of the normal ema 20, are using this so that you do not take a trade whilst price is in the ema bands? I've not been using indicators for a long time so I'm out of touch with them but I notice on the Nolag indicators they change colour ie from green to red which is normal, however when price moves quickly in one direction they all seem to be one colour changing the dots from before is this normal?

--- 帖子 #227 ---
hi. i only traded CPI today. had 2 orders, a buy stop above 1.6320 (small 15mn high), which i cancelled as soon as i was at +20, and a sell stop below S1 and coral.

I guess u guys have a full stomach filling those pips on cable... just a suggestion... i did enter with 1min TF... u will see nice entry since waiting for the entry in 5m is waiting too long and those profit pips are passing by while waiting in 5m TF...

--- 帖子 #229 ---
Hi everybody, Can you post your actual results with this system (not just positive) because testing this method for 3 days in strictly applying the rules, for me it looks like the casino (50/50). In addition, input signals are generally contrary to the signals that are given to me by my system that has a score of 70/30. Julie thank you for your work

--- 帖子 #230 ---
yes, i use those setting for ma candle. yes, ema bands are high, low, close. if i understand correctly, if nolag indi changes color anytime after close of candle, that is not normal, and called repainting, which is not good.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
i do not see any repainting, nonlag changes colors only while the candle is still open, which is normal.

--- 帖子 #232 ---
to me, nonlags are just another confirmation: i use fractals and price action on higher TF's to guide me for direction, and my personal favourite, RSI divergence.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Thanks for the reply, yes that was my point I've noticed on several occasions the dots change during and after the close of the candles when I say change for eg if looking at nolag ma30 it suddenly changes green for say 3 dots than all of a sudden the green dots are wiped and they are all red what good is that yes you may see a sudden burst in price in the opposite direction but that does not help. Repainting to that extreme is not going to give a clear picture especially when backtesting. All that said this method does however work I don’t want to change what Julie has set out here but I ultimately look for divergence and candle patterns basic PA and look to take the trades of 1 min from a candle pattern of M5 preferably at a good pivot or S/R level if the Nolag did not repaint that really would help. Would like to hear the views of Julie and others on this.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
please try this, i don't see any repainting. in the common tab, check fixed minimum 1, and fixed max 2.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
nonlags have turned red after triple top HS with divergence and news fakeout. entered when 1mn closed below pivot after re-test.

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Thanks for that Bubola, I am currently using the same nolag you just posted. I hope that I'm wrong and that they do not repaint if so than I need to get my eyes tested.

Hi figaro can you post a chart please where you think it is 50/50 because that has not been my experience. I have posted quite a few charts where i mark all the signals and entries and usually it only has either 1 or 2 losing trades and often none. This is on the GBPUSD, can you tell us which currency and session time you talking about as this also affects the outcome. Sometimes people have thought there was a trade when in actual fact they are going against my rules so please post a chart when making an observation for us all to see and discuss. It will also help us to refine the rules if we can see how it works on "losing" days. Sorry haven't had time to post charts of last few trading days as I am on holiday.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Hi KDX, I have not seen the Nonlag's repaint, the last square of all 3 of the non lags are only set after the candle closes, so you can sometimes see all 3 being green and if price suddenly drops all 3 will turn red and when candle closes may stay red unless price reverses in the same candle, I have not seen it go back and change colour of earlier nonlags after candles close, which would be repainting. Would all users of this system please check to see if they agree with me, as i for one, do not like using repainting indis. If you put the nonlag back on the chart you can see this quite clearly as the MA line moves up and down and changes colour as the current price fluctuates. Particularly evident in high volatility. This to me just confirms we need to wait for close of candle before making trading decision. J

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Hi Julie, Just to confirm that the indicator I posted does NOT repaint. Once the candle is closed the colour of the blocks "on the left" will not change. Obviously during any open candle the colour may change because of price changes. Wait for closed candle for confirmation of 3 blocks in the same colour and then look at PA with the opening of the next candle is the way to go.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Hi Vyrexus, I would like to comment on your losing Euro trade, there were multiple exit points, all well BEFORE sl would have been hit. Firstly i think you took some profit at (your..see PS) R1 which was fine, and it went on to touch YH, when it failed to cross above, and it produced multiple dojis and some bearish engulfiing candles, I would have exited balance of trade at either R1 or YH and especially after the last bearish engulfing. Even if you didn't exit then, you had 15 NL turning red as a warning and 30NL then turning red which is 2 nonlgs red, and finally all 3 nonlags turned red which is a signal short. The nonlags are your guide of new direction, not only for entry but for exit. Please read the exit criteria on the first page. exits are Pivots, 2 nonLags or signal other way. You had all before stop loss J PS I am not absolutely sure but I think your pivots may not be correct, my pivot indicator (which shows yesterdays) doesn't not have R1 at the same place as yours, if you are using TDxPivots please change to daily pivots not fibo pivots.

Hiya Pipdude, Queensland is great thanks, but busy dancing alot in the evenings so may have to consider trading early asian while i am here. You seem to be doing well in that session. But gee guys what you trying to do to me and my system, first its nonlags are repainting, then it has discrepancies, lol I dunno. I am glad it doesn't repaint nor have discrepancies though. Thanks Glenegle for confirming, I never thought it did, just needed someone to confirm. Off dancing now, will try trade Asian tomorrow. J

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Hi Julie I think I did point out that I had not been using indi's for a very long time Its only the past 2-3 months I have gone to much smaller timeframes and added indi's as I traded of larger timeframes so Maybe it was me as the dots change very quickly. I'm pleased they dont repaint as I've said this method works. To further Improve accuracy I use PA, candle patterns I trade 1m for entry 5m for setup charts.

hi, an awful london session for g/u. i ignored all long signals, as we were already near max ADR, and i saw RSI divergence. i hesitated a little to go short, i wasn't sure we would break out of the range. 2 lots out at +15, 3rd lot closed manually when price went back to R2.....and now of course it drops like a stone

Hi pipdude, Appreciate if you can share your template. I am using julie template. I want to compare because on my chart there is indeed a sell signal for eu, but the price didn't retrace to ma(20), so no entry for me. edited: sorry notice on your earlier post you are using ma(13), but still appreciate if you can share yours. thanks

--- 帖子 #260 ---
thanks julie, i have change the template with your latest update.

--- 帖子 #261 ---
the template of my latest post is ma candles set at 20 ema cross, a THV3 T3 ma set at 8, 0.4, i will also use 13, 21, or 34 ema bands, set at high, low, close, ATR projection indi, and latest version of nonlag ma indi. i don't wait for pullback to 20 ema for entry, i enter after the close of signal candle. i rely on choosing a signal that will likely breakout. price action and time of day. my familliarity with how eu moves, and noticing patterns in movement, also eu is less volatile and consistent in it's price movements, but i don't recommend this kind of entry.

Hi there Julie/Gleneagles, Thank you for this system and the indicator. I took some trades today and like the system very much. Please do let me know if I have not followed the system in any way. Thank you. On the EURUSD my efforts resulted in the following results: Positive - 5 Negative - 1

--- 帖子 #263 ---
On the EURJPY the results were as follows: Positive - 6 Negative - 0

Hi Julie, Annoyed at not having the same results as you, while I started again and I realized that I did not have the same input signals that other Mystery Mystery! ... After two hours of searching, I found it! In fact, I do not know if it's a bug in my PC or Metatrader but I can not put together my system Renko and your system on the same platform if it's a catastrophe! So I installed your system on another PC and there .... Miracle! it works! That said, it's good to know! Attention to the coexistence of EA Renko with another system .... But I repeat: the problem may be only my own PC. Julie, pardon for having doubted your method and Thanks again for your work. friendly Figaro

--- 帖子 #266 ---
I envy you and keep up the good work. I was thinking, can you explain more about your profit taking or you mainly rely on your experience on eu movement? Im looking to improve my target, though i have a daily goal but there is always room for improvement. A chart of gu i entered not long(16pips) posted below.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
kola, here's an example of seeing familiar price movement. notice lines of S/R on chart, and how price made a strong move up to test high, but failed to break and con't higher, price will often, then break lower even more strongly past support, this is a familiar pattern.

Hi there Gleneagles, Thank you very much for your encouragement. I am an ardent follower of your approach to trading and do examine the trades as shown in your charts that you post each week in the other thread. I really like your "Little bites lead to a big banquet" approach to accumulating pips. And oh my what a banquet!!! May the PIPS be with you.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
kola, my daily target is the ATR projection lines, 3 to 4x a week price will hit them, 1 day a week will surpass them, 1 to 2x a week won't get hit. today hit for +100 pips on eu short.

Hey thanks for the info, can you please post your atr projection lines indicator? Thanks alot in advance.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
hi kola, pipdude have share the indicator in his previous post http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...7&amp;postcount=98 but i am not quite sure on how to use it. pipdude, if possible i would like you to explain more on how to use it.if the market movement has reach it daily atr, would you be looking for a reverse position? example, when a pair blows its north ATR, would you be looking to a sell position or you will stop trading for that day. thanks in advance

hi julie &amp; guys, on friday i have enter a sell position on eu, it hit my sl, but after that the price move to my direction. needs your guys wise opinion on which part do i do wrong/ should improve Attached Image (click to enlarge) as you can see I open the trade according to: a)NonLags all having a same colour(Signal) b)price retrace to ema(20) and close below in ema line(colour is red) c)During my opening, the NonLags again having a same colour(red) d)the price is not too near to pivot level e)the adx(14) is above 20(means the trend got enough strength support,correct me if i am wrong) i exit the position because a)set sl approximately between 10-13pips b)2 of the 3 NonLag's are wrong color(in these case green) c)previous candle close above ema(20) in green colour appreciate your guys opinion thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Hello Vyrexus I am new to this system but any system like this will also require you to have a good understanding for "price action". You may want to visit this thread http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=232466 and pay attention to posts by Paulus In the chart you posted price never broke the "number 2" point. (see thread about trading 123) I would have never taken a trade short until the low, about 6 bars previous had been taken out. You were right about price going to drop, you just go in too soon. I have been backtesting this method with the attached indicator. You can set MA1 to 20 ema, and MA 2 to a larger number (I use 55). I find that this keeps me in on the right side of the trend, and out when things are changing. OK...Question for you. I see that you have a red line drawn when all the blocks lined up, is that an indicator or did you draw that line? (if it is an indicator, can you let me know where it is?) Thx!! PGPB PS. If my introducing the 123 pattern is not in line with this system please let me know.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Thanks PGPB, Really appreciate your feedback.i would pay attention to the thread you referred, hope can learn from time to time. i didn't wait for the price to break the previous low because i am afraid the trigger is too close with the nearby pivot point.and according to trend pipper's rule is not a good entry when trigger occurred near a pivot point. also what convince me is the triggered candle(with arrow) is respecting my trend line which i draw earlier(yellow colour). see pic Attached Image (click to enlarge) Regarding your question, the vertical red line is drawed by myself manually. lets just hope there is indicator for it in future. I also have question regarding the indicator.what are the setting you used for ma1/2's price and method. Is it 0 respectively?because i check method 1 is sync with julie's ma(20). correct me if i am wrong. thanks again.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Hi Vyrexus, According to your chart entry looked fine and to the rules, but when I checked my chart I noticed you entered right on the daily open price (not marked on your chart) and it bounced around there before finally breaking through. Please note in my rules pivots are all pivots, incl mid pivots, yesterdays high, yesterdays low and todays open prices as these are all magnets and price either bounces, breaks through or hangs around while it decides what to do. Personally I still use 15 pips for GBPUSD but can use 10 pips for EURUSD. Pound moves slightly more eratically. The next entries made up for the loss as the trend took hold. So you were a little unlucky in the entry you took got stopped out, but if you had 15 pips it would not have. Hope that clarifies things for you. J

--- 帖子 #278 ---
hi again, personally i wouldnt pay too much attention to a very short angled trend line on 5 min chart unless it coincided with one from a higher timeframe. If you want to check for trend notice the 20 EMA at the time of your entry was flat. Trend had not quite developed yet, and if you add a 60 sma the 20 ema was still above it, a few candles later the 20 ema went below the 60 sma and the trade was good. I am thinking of bringingin the 60 sma, but do not want to make it into a moving average crossover system as I think crossovers are very unreliable. But you can add an extra filter only look for longs if 20 ema above 60 sma and vice cersa. J

--- 帖子 #279 ---
hi julie, glad to have you back, how your new place?hope you can settled in quickly. thanks for your input.i guess i should have stick to the rule which is 15 pip sl.should have taken into consideration the broker spread as well. but your method is still working fine to me. i didn't pointed out earlier after the loss i have re-enter again on the next retrace. manage to bank in 30 pips. also curious to know why my pivot line and your line is different. i am using the THV4 TzPivotsD (Black) indi.is it similar to you? for your info my broker is on gmt 0 and i am living in gmt +8.what is the right setting for me? thanks again.

--- 帖子 #280 ---

julie, using the 60sma reminds me of another system, 5m intraday system. http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=11854 also sonic r. system http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=114792

--- 帖子 #282 ---
Hi Vyrexus, yes thank you all settled in. I use the THV4TzPivots indi that was posted here same as you. I have broker set to 0 as my broker has 0.00 at Asian open. I don't need to tell it what my timezone is. Make sure you also change Open and Yesterdays High/Low to True and Pivots to Daily not Fibo. J

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Hiya Pipdude, yes there are some similarities, I tried the 5m Intraday system a while ago. All systems (esp ones using MA's) will have similarities and similar entry points it is after all the same input data. I just wanted a more simple system that was very visual and had few bad entries. Thank you Pipdude for your continued support and posts of how you use my system. Your contributions are extremely valuable and helpful to me and other traders. J

--- 帖子 #284 ---
hi julie, okay i have change the gmt setting to follow the asian session open, i hope i have a similar line with you Attached Image (click to enlarge) based the current chart, would you be looking for a trade trigger to occurred or you only trade during late asian session onwards. say the price retrace to ema(20) and close below open line but failed to close below MS1 line, is this a good entry also? sorry if i keep asking a newbie question, hope it didn't annoyed you guys. but i really appreciate your answer. thanks

--- 帖子 #285 ---
julie, thank you for the kind words, you are very welcome.

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Hi Vyrexus, My open is actually Sydney open not Tokyo so our open lines will be different, if your 0.00 line is Tokyo then set it to 23 and you should get Sydney. Yes your chart was showing an entry signal and I entered short after close below MS1 and got 15 pips and exited at yesterday's low. I prefer late Asian and London but since I am over here I am trading early Asian. Please don't worry about asking questions, other people read this and learn from the questions asked. And it helps me to refine exact rules when I get queries. So thank you for your input and interest. J

--- 帖子 #287 ---
thanks julie, my broker time 0.00 is start at GMT 0, since sydney start at 2200 GMT, i guess my correct setting should be -2. i have change it accordingly. on the ealier trade, i am so glad i manage to recognize the same signal as you but my question is some time the pivot line is too close with the nearby pivot line like yesterday low and s1.what happen if all the rules is meet, except that the price is close between the pivot line and since the range is tight, would you consider it to be a trade opportunity or not?

--- 帖子 #288 ---
eurusd short signal, entry on pullback, 1st exit +70, hit ATR.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
julie, in this trade i ignored the long signal to get a better pullback entry on an earlier short signal, i know i definitely broke some rules here, but at what point do you sacrifice a better entry for what you may consider a false signal. with any system i always seem to run into this dilemma. i'd really like your comments on this. and how do you personally filter out false signals?

--- 帖子 #290 ---
eurusd short 2nd exit +100

--- 帖子 #291 ---
Filtering out false signals is often a matter of being disciplined (which I am still working on myself). The signal looked good but the entry candle was a small doji sitting right on S1 and under Yesterday's low. The overhead resistance stifled the long trade and to me it felt like a short all day. I like to take the entries that come when price closes on the right side of resistance, those trades seem to take off better. You got in 10 to 12 pips earlier for the short but ran the risk of it moving thru the resistance, it will sometimes work and other times not. I tend to want to trade that way also and would prefer to get in at the top or bottom right on resistnce or support but too many trades don't follow through when I jump in early. The pivots help me filter out bad spots to enter trades, but I am finding I exit too soon and miss the rest of the trend. I am going to try your ATR indi for exits. But it requires patience as we have to sit thru slow tmes and retraces. It is proving to be quite reliably giving you around 100 pips or more per day. So with my system's entry and your exit strategy we could have a very profitable way to trade. I actually intended this system to be an "entry and ride the trend" system, but with the pound it ended up closer to a scalping strategy and that may be the way it works, scalp the pound to pivots and ride the euro for the day. I don't have as much time or consistency while I am on holiday but will certainly be looking to write rules for scalping and rules for longer trend trades, when I get chance. J

Hi Vyrexus... Setting SL is a personal thing... some people recommend having a wider SL, just to give the move some room to play. 1. One option is to use an ATR multiple. Look at your info panel in the top left corner of your chart ("THV V4 Info")... at the bottom, you see 3x ATR SL. The number beside it is 3x the current candle's ATR (20 Period ATR). When you enter your trade, you can glance at this figure, and set your SL to that (it is wide enough to give the trade some room); at the time of your trade, 3x ATR (20) would have been 21 pips. If Price then starts to move in your direction, you can move your SL according to the current number in that panel as it changes (i.e.: 3x ATR away from current Price) - in this way you'll have a trailing stop of sorts. You can also use the built-in MT4 trailing if Price moves your way. 2. I sometimes use the Gann HiLo indicator (attached here; standard settings) to take my exits. It is the blue line on the attached chart. It helps make the decision making a little less stressful. If Price goes against me and crosses over to the other side of this line, I take my loss. However, I will use it to stay in my position (at least part of my position if I've already taken some profits elsewhere) until Price flips to the other side. I also sometimes use it to get back in if the trend is very strong. I have found that it is often wise not to ignore the signal to take the loss when Price flips over (as with any other SL method). Take care to avoid the temptation to use this indicator as a stop and reverse signal: it gives great signals in trends, but will whipsaw the hell out of you when Price is moving sideways. Also note that you must wait for the close of the candle to confirm that Price has crossed to the other side, as only the close confirms whether a flip takes place or not (it can go back and forth during the current candle). --- BTW... my Non-Lags did not show 3 red lights until 8 or 9 bars later, when Price broke Support. My 15 non-Lag showed yellow at the time of your trade. The yellow lights signal non-dierction, so I'd rather wait. When price really moves, they will turn red or green, and entry will not be too delayed (in my experience). I posted these non-lags earlier in the thread. Some people don't like the yellow lights, but for me, they are a filter of sorts. Had you entered there, the value for 3x ATR (20) at the time was also 21 pips, and you would not have been stopped out on that big bull candle 10 minutes later (probably the US Core CPI news release). However, had Price continued to move against you, you would not have lost more than 21 pips. I also like having a 60 EMA on my chart, for the same reasons Julie and others have talked about in this thread (I think Bubola uses the Coral - from the THV system, which is also fine). I'm just on the fence about whether or not it is good enough that Price is above/below it, or if it is better to wait for a cross (which is not part of the system). That did look like a bit of a messy session... Spot

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Hi PipDude... When you're posting your trades, would you be kind enough to note the times (and time zone) of your entries and exits? - This would be helpful for those of us in different time zones who are trying to see what it woud have looked like on our charts at the time. I've tried to do this when I've posted my trades. I guess I'm really asking everyone if we could all do that. BTW... I've tried that Average Daily Range indi of yours in the past, but didn't pay it much heed. Maybe I'll give it a second look. Looks narrow for EU and GU today, like they're trading outside of the range, but you could have ridden it from bottom to top on GBPAUD! Thx... Spot

Hi Pipdude, I think may have your gmt times wrong, the long signal and then entry was around 7.35am gmt and entry around 8.30am gmt after London open. My broker is +1 gmt. Anyway I would prefer charts to be posted rather than times on here as it is of no use for people reading the thread at later dates if they have to go hunting for gmt times and have no chart for reference or view. I exited both my longs in euro and pound, was trying to stay in and not get edgy at the pivots where I would usually exit. But I have your ATR levels indi and pound just touched the H4atr line so I exited there. Not sure what the different lines are and what the labels mean. Notice the signals and entries before London open failed and were stopped out. I will consider waiting for London open for more reliable signals. J

Not from today at least. Please. Many thanks.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
I'm no expert, but I've watched this thread and tried it out on a smaller account I have when I've finished for the day my normal way of trading (yes I'm sad, its a hobby ) but in your second image you have marked them all as signal, when in fact it should be signal, wait for the price to cross the ma and then come back the same way as the signal. So in fact you wouldn't have gone in on your first horizontal line you would have waited until it went over the ma and then back again which means you wouldn't have entered until the 3rd horizontal line.

kola, sometimes at breakeven, sometimes 30 to 50 pips, depends on price action.

could have maybe done it this way to get your entry, otherwise entry would have been further down, after indi's closed all red again. i also took this trade, but with my setup. but i didn't want to post it, because i wasn't sure about my setup and entry. julie can we get your comments on this.

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Hi Dortmunder, Yes it is definitely a valid setup/signal. What I am finding tho is on the euro the pullback does not always go right back to the ema20 as it does on the pound, but I would have taken the short, it looked very bearish. There were a couple of other entries one of which may have been stopped out as it retraced back to R1. J

--- 帖子 #323 ---
hi pipdude, i see that trade you hilighted slightly diffrerently. Note my chart, the signal you had is not a signal for the later trade as itself a retrace of the long trade and it continues for 33 pips from that short signal candle. Also the earlier short signal became invalid in my book as price continued to stay above the ema20, valid signals have price going above for long and below for shorts, then the pullback to the ema and hopefully continuation of the signals direction. Price never went below ema20 after that earlier short signal until much later. But it certainly gives a indication trend is slowing tho and with the overhead resistance of MR2, ATR and R2 the next signal short was successful. Hope that makes sense, let me know if it doesn't guys. J

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Hi Juli, thanks a lot for your precious input! After watching your image I have the impression that my entry came a little bit too early. If you compare my arrow with your arrows implemented in the chart you can see that. So that implicates that there is one crucial point that is still not clear yet to me. That is connected with your 2nd condition for the entry: "Wait for price to return to EMA..." Perhaps it is because I am not a native English speaker, but what does this exactly mean? Does price have (i) to cross the EMA or (ii) only to touch the EMA or (iii) is it sufficient if price moves just some pips in the direction of the EMA? I would be grateful for some comments on my thoughts

--- 帖子 #325 ---
ok firstly I developed my system for the GBPUSD and it moves slightly differently to the Euro. I am still dveloping rules for the euro. To understand the rule I will show you how it works on the pound using a recent example. After the signal price move up but nearly always I noticed it comes back to the ema 20 before continuing, in the past if i entered when it looked bullish I would get stopped out, by waiting for the pullback and price crossing back above ema we get a better entry and usually stop is not visited. I prefer if the price moves below the ema and then closes back above this is clasic entry point. Care needs to be taken entering too close to reistance tho as a significant retrace or end of trend can occur at resistance. Pivots and reistance are not marked on this chart, Just trying to show the basic rules.

Not much to post about over Easter, plus it was public holiday here Tues also. But its back to it today, I am going to assess all trades over the last few weeks using my rules and compare results for Asian and European sessions on the GBPUSD. Particularly looking at how many trades (entries not signals) were losers and which session produced the most pips. I will post each days trades as I do them and colate the total results when I have done a few weeks to get an overall picture of the best way to trade this system. I want to see whether it is best to exit at pivots and re enter or stay in from beginning of Asian and or European. J

The yellow seems to keep us out of losing trades. The signal is a candle or 2 later but this does not matter as we wait for pullback anyway. Your choice which you use but my examples will have the 3 colours and entries/signals will be slightly different to mine if using 2 colour.

julie, what does the indicator clock with the left arrow means? can i shift the position of that clock cos it's overlapping the current price number. newbie to MT4 here. thanks

--- 帖子 #344 ---
mid asian session, short signal, pullback, entry.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
It just tells you how much time left on the candle., i use P4L Candletime, not sure which one you are using. Can't seem to move it but you can change the font. J

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Hi pipdude, I traded the euro today too, i was late with my entry but I stayed in for the duration, moved sl to breakeven when up 20 pips or so and did one move to trail. Got 43 pips out of possible 74. The second trade I placed then was out (lol), came back to missing the exit at 73 pips, but got 40 pips. Also got 33 pips and -10 pips on gbp. Ended up with 100 pips, not bad considering I was distracted and went dancing lol. (just demo tho while on holiday) j

--- 帖子 #347 ---
G'day Julie I'm a complete sucker for higher low lower high type systems off 5 mins and always open to have a look and learn. Regards.

--- 帖子 #348 ---
julie, i'm glad to see you had success trading the eurusd, and trying to stay in longer. i was out 2/3 of my short, when it hit ATR line.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Hi V, nice to see you here. I read your posts on various threads and love your insights and trading ideas. Let us know what you think of the system. Oh and V pointed out to me something i forgot to mention, i had used a 10 ema on a previous post for the EURUSD, its optional but can be used to get into trades that take off without us and price doesn't go back to 20 ema. In those situations you can use the 10 ema as entries along the trend. J

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Early days yet but I'll watch with interest. Didn't have UC up but today for some reason that was a give away. It went first at 11 chart time. Eur then signalled 11.15 chart time returned to 20 ema for a nice hammer hl close. GU signalled and pulled back to 20 ema but 15 NLMA red. Signalled again 11.20 and pulled back to 20 ema. A look back may be interesting to see how often NLMA switching to red avoids losing trades compared to good angle on ma's suggesting trend may continue. Good luck with your thread.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
hi julie, saw your explanation on 10 ema earlier, does that mean we only look for retrace to 10 ema if the price has touch 20 ema earlier.Other wise follow the original rules, and this is only recommended for eu. correct me if i am wrong. thanks vyrexus

--- 帖子 #352 ---
Straightforward lower high in terms of system.

friday's trade results for eurusd, there was a lot of chop and whipsaw, ugly day for trading, stopped out -5, +0, +0, +40.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Thanks Julie for this wonderful stratergy. God Bless you.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Aren't there any NonLag Ma indicators for the Yen pairs?

--- 帖子 #356 ---
For EJ change the minimum/maximum under the indicators common tab to 100 and 200 instead of 1 and 2 as you have for the others.

--- 帖子 #357 ---
how long do you all usually wait for pullbacks to the EMA line before you all enter? cos i am sometimes impatient, whenever i see an up-up-and-away situation (such as today's USD erratic movement) i just buy in straight away. i dont have much time on the monitor, so i cant really wait for the prices to pull back. is there any automated script for this?

--- 帖子 #358 ---
ohammond, I tried changing fixed min/max to 100 and 200 for USD/JPY and still can't get nonlags to show. Do you have any other ideas? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
I messed around with the settings and it works if you do 0 and 100 for UJ.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Thanks, I am going to try it.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
ohammond, thanks for the suggestion. It worked. I took my first trade with this system on the GBPUSD today with a gain of 42 pips. I thank Julie and all who have contributed to this thread. I love the simplicity of the Trendpipper system.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Finally,I was able to set them up. USDJPY fixed min/max =0 and 100 GBPJPY fixed min/max =0 and 200 EURJPY fixed min/max =0 and 300

starting 5/2/11, 1030am est. usa, eurusd long, then short signal, entry and exit. http://C:UsersOwnerDesktopabo.gif

--- 帖子 #364 ---
can anyone comment, i tried 2 trades both losers. the 2nd one featured below http://img849.imageshack.us/img849/7620/49701530.gif i entered on 3 green, and when pulled back to EMA. i exited when 2 of NLMA turned red. i think it so happen that after i exited my trade, it shot up 15 pips again. how do i avoid this?

--- 帖子 #365 ---
eurusd long stopped out +0, long 715am est. signal to exit at ATR lines.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
I would say your entry was a bit late in the move. It signalled then pulled back to the ema and then the entry a lot further back, a lot better entry as it was also bouncing off a support line when it did it.

--- 帖子 #367 ---
Hello Pipdude. can u teach me how to use ATR? and can u share the ATR indi? Coz i already download the ATR indi from this thread and the result pretty different with yours. Thx.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Hello julie. I wonder how can i get the nonlag with the yellow collors? Coz i already download it and I just get the blue and red collors. I to use with the yellow coz I think it is more accurate. Thx.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
scuderia, ATR measures average daily range. i use it to project profit targets. with the eurusd i try to enter a trade, and then wait for price to reach the ATR lines, before taking profits. 3 to 4x a week price will reach ATR lines. results may vary depending on when ATR lines start. they start at the 0 hour on your charts. and depending on when your charts start at 0 hour varies with broker, from 5pm to 8pm est. usa. so, ATR lines may be different. mine starts at 8pm est. with forex.com .

--- 帖子 #370 ---
scuderia, here's nonlagma you wanted.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
Thx for the explanations pipdude. Can u sent me the indi too? coz i download one from this thread it shows like RSI. thx. i will learn to use ATR when i have the same indi u have. Thx for share the indi and share the nonlagma.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
Posted elsewhere. Eur higher low, push up from 25 psych level/D pivot/POC combo. Good angle on ma's.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
for ATR indi click on attachments page 3, scroll to LFL-ATRprojections, see post as well.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Thx pipdude. So can tell me how this ATR works? I don't understand at all. Thx.

--- 帖子 #375 ---
I have had success with this system so far... thanks julie!!!!!

--- 帖子 #376 ---
Anyone can tell me, Is there any different to use the indicator on nonlag,nonlagv5 and nonlagv7? because i feels the colors is different each one. I am just curious though. thx.

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Hello is there any different rules to the nonlags, nonlagsV5 and the nonlagV7? because i find it pretty different. need help's here. I tried in demo and the result is fantastic but when i experiment with the those nonlag. i get diff results. Thx 4 helping.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
didn't i already explain how this indi works? ATR means average true range, the number of pips price moves on average on a daily basis. if ATR is 100, and price moves 100 pips it will reach ATR lines.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
notice this long trade of eurusd for today with signal to exit. price moved 93 pips and ATR is 111 pips. so price reached ATR line. ATR lines are an approximation of ATR, lines placed above and below ATR.

--- 帖子 #380 ---
it is a good system . Thanks but i am afraid Nonelog repaint because it's been set for bigger TF

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Ah i get the hint now. And then what about the ATR projection up and down for?

--- 帖子 #382 ---
And someone can tell me about the different about nonlag, nolagv5 and nonlagv7?

--- 帖子 #383 ---
It is simply a projection for your take profit, more often than not, as pipdude said, it reaches it.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
how do i get the ATR?

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Go to the paper clip at the top of the thread, click on hide images and you will see a link for LFL-ATRprojections.

--- 帖子 #386 ---
It doesn't repaint, it only changes colour when the candle is still open, once closed it stays the colour it is.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
i agree, i have not seen this indi repaint.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Is there an alert indie for this system? Thanks all

--- 帖子 #389 ---
so if you enter a trade, what TP level will u put? 111 pips? 93 pips? sry dont rly understand!

--- 帖子 #390 ---
made one loser today again. am i just unlucky or am i missing out anything? http://i55.tinypic.com/2isz40z.gif

Support and resistance levels/key areas, in this case the round number 4100.

Hey Guys Can you please share what template and indis are we using right now as the forom is flooded with great suggestion and indicators. But it is still not clear what version have we finally decided and using for this system. Can you please help me out a bit. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Try this... Hope that will help u

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Thanks Can you also please share the tpl file..

--- 帖子 #395 ---
how much SL do you people usually put? for EURUSD?

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Good general rule of thumb would be above below the last swing high or low. Typically this would be give or take 15 pips.

--- 帖子 #397 ---
Hi Julie You might want to play around with this http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=295396 as its an ea undergoing testing with pull back to ma's as its basis.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Hi Julie This is a good system, thank for sharing it. I have read through the thread, my question is how do you trade the "trend trade".

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Hello julie. At the first time i try this one it is profitable. But lately it not making any progress. any suggestions? for this past week. thx.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Morning, new to the thread and experimenting with NonlagMA. Entered with long signal 04:15 EST @6468. Hard to figure out why it turned at 6488. Not sure which Pivot Indicators you guys are using. Was my entry wrong so close to the MP or didn't I see the proper Exit level? Appreciate your comments. Ridgeback update: I see a 4h R1 at 1.6489. Are you guys using the 1H and 4h resistance and supply levels as well or mainly/only the dailies?

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Hi all, Sorry I have not been trading the last month or so and only checked the charts every now and then. Too much going on in RL atm to concentrate. Hope to get back to it this week or next and focus again. The day I did have a look I also noticed the system was up and down, price changing direction frequently and not at pivots. Haven't got any definite answers at the moment sorry guys but will be looking into its consistency. I did notice early asian was trending better so may have to be flexible as to time frame, and it really is a trend system primarily, if price is not trending well may need to get out with 10 - 20 pips, when its there, cos it seems to reverse on a whim and take out stop loss. Just a quick observation one or two days last week. If anyone is trading the system successfully or not for that matter please feel free to comment. Pipdude - are you still using your version of the system? Julie

--- 帖子 #402 ---
welcome back Julie, my main question would be which of the pivot indicators you are really using. AutoPivotIndicator_v5 gives me a DP of 64883 today, which can't be correct. cheers Ridgeback

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Hi Ridgeback, I am using THV4 TzPivotsD (black) for daily use as it give daily candle and labels on the actual lines which i like. When I want to look back I addd Auto-Pivot Plotter V1-V41 and the mid level one so that I can see the pivots on previous days. These both seem to give the same pivot levels and work fine for me. j edit: this is correct tpl file, my apologies, the other one I loaded yesterday had wrong settings

--- 帖子 #404 ---
Hi, How do you get the arrows at the signals on your charts? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #405 ---
thanks for your reply. What settings do you use on TzPivotsD? Do you leave it at GMT +0? If I do I get quite different pivot points compared to http://www.actionforex.com/markets/p...2010040873429/ Ridge

--- 帖子 #406 ---
why wasn't the entry at 09.55 @1.64855 valid?

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Hi Niksan, these are added manually to the chart using the edit chart options in MT4. If you haven't got them click on View, Toolbars, Linestudies to add the toolbar to your Mt4. Now you should have access to all the options, right click on the line studies, customise and you can add or remove the buttons you want to see and use. Add Arrows to your line studies toolbar. J

--- 帖子 #408 ---
check you have changed it to DPV (Daily Pivots) and not using default FPV, (Fibonacci Pivots) should have 1 in the box not 2, and yes I leave GMT at 0. For me having 0 GMT means the new day starts at beginning of Asian session, being Australian that works fine for me, I have noticed the pivots used on other websites do differ, not gone into it much as I can see my daily pivot is recognised by price action. For example right at this moment gbpusd is finding resistance at DPV, so even if the real daily pivot for the rest of the world is something else, price is still recognising this pivot. I don't like getting too bogged down on the whys and wherefores, you would have to go study pivots elsewhere to find all the answers to the intracacies of pivots. j

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Hello, dear author tell why when I have established your template, at me indicators are represented by squares instead of lines as at you on scrinshots, thanks

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Hi bmwdream, You are right, we changed the nonlag to show blocks instead of lines, by changing the minimum and maximum values in the common tab to 1 and 2 to straighten the line. I have changed the jpg chart example to reflect this. Julie

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Hi Julie, you still use the nonlag indicator ? Can you confirm that it doesn't repaint itself ? Thank you!

--- 帖子 #412 ---
hi, It doesn't repaint, but as the candle is forming say its going short the current nonlags may turn red but if the candle finishes higher they may turn green. you need to wait for candle close for final colour of last non lag block. it does not repaint older blocks, many people have confirmed. J

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Good morning Julie, do you still trade using this system ?

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Hi ttaro, Er well I am sort of using it but encorporating it in my scalping on the EURUSD these days. Using the 5 min to determine direction and trading/scalping the euro in that direction. The system itself if not quite as cut and dry as it was on the Pound as price doesn't pull back to the 20 ema as often on the euro. I find its most helpful to notice when price pushes through the 20 ema, when it does that on the 5 min a new short term trend is usually forming and it becomes safe to scalp in that direction. Sorry can't be more helpful as I am not trading the pound at present.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
An interesting wee system Julie ! Have I got the gist of it?, my take on the signals &amp; entries is attached. HX

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Hi there Highlander, Yes as far as signals and entries go they look pretty good, but i take a judgement call on closeness to pivots as support or resistance and both those entries although they worked out great this time may have come a cropper on possible pivot bounces. If there is enough momentum or its news driven it will push through the pivots anyway, but if not you will get some losers that don't follow through if you enter too close to pivots. PS the 2nd trade I would be less worried about the Ms1 but the first taking it long up into daily pivot can be very risky. Just my thoguhts on pivots. J

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Hi Julie, thanks for that I just wanted to make sure I understood the signal/entry combination correctly. Cheers HX

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Hi Julie I have a question regarding stops. Do you place the stop at the Hi of a short entry candle and the Low of a long entry candle as illustrated on my attachment? Also after a failure would you re-enter as indicated? Cheers HX

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Good and simple system but the thread has been dormant for quite sometime.

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Hi Julie, try ema 34 for the EU, thanks for the good forum.
