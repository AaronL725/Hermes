Opening price US30

We all know about the volatility of the US30 asset. I will leave a simple way to operate this asset every day.

As soon as we open the US30 asset market we will take the opening price and place 02 pending orders, being.

200 pips above the opening price (BUY STOP)

200 pips below the opening price (SELL STOP)

I'll leave a template ready with the Daily open line indicator and Expert Esike.

In my template I put a suggestion of:

Stop 100 pips

Tp 50 pips

TS 35 pips guarantees 2 pips of profit

Today opening price was 31.564

BUY STOP 31.764

SELL STOP 31.364

We had the victory at the sell stop

See the image of today's victory see the image of how your chart will look.

green pips

Very good Robson. Let´s go on each day. Somebody may be not in accord with such risk/reward, but I know you have backtested this strategy and you already have seen it is good.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Good morning flashpaul. Thank you very much friend. I will try to put the results here every day. A hug

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Visual backtesting is good, let's see what forward testing brings about.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Exactly. We know that the ideal is to have a favorable Risk x Reward; 2x1 or 3x1. Time will tell what we can change. a hug

--- 帖子 #6 ---
I have done a visual and backtest of this strategy from 04/01 until today 2/3.  Sometimes there are days in which orders are not opened.

It is not an accurate backtest, but we have had two SL of 100 pips and 22 TP of 50 pips for a total of 900 pips in two months.

I don´t have calculated TS.

It should be very interesting if somebody may do an EA do a backtest more accurately.

Basically, this is a strategy that functions and surely can be improved.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
isnt it better to just take a chance towards long or short and than tp 100 pips sl 35 pips?

--- 帖子 #8 ---
[quote = hibra68; 13434446] non è meglio rischiare solo con un long o short e piuttosto che 100 pips sl 35 pips? [/ quote]

35 pips SL are too tight for such volatility assets as this.

At 16:00 of own broker, there is high volatility and 35 pips of stop-loss can be caught easily.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
I follow this asset always, every day. It might be a good thing to do the following: Divide the batch into two entries.

STOP 100 pips

1st TP 50 pips

2nd TP 200 pips / 150 pips or 100 pips

2nd entry with 50 pips TS.

Arriving at 50 pips will close Tp of the 1st entry and the 2nd protected entry.

Just a suggestion

Does the opening price varies from broker to broker? For me the Candle opened at 31413. I use ICMarkets EU.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
I noticed here ... really Ic markets 31.413 (difference 7 pips)

I use Valutrades yesterday opening 31.564

Yesterday Ic markets opening 31.567

I believe that the difference being small, will not have problems

Let's keep watching

Goodnight This US30 asset is fantastic, take it easy. I have other ways to work with him.

I will continue to place the entries with a distance of 200 pips, but pay attention to the following.

Now look at the bottoms and tops ... place the pending orders above and below those locations.

A hug and stay green.

I did place those position at tops and bottoms,its working fine I can see this clearly,the magic with US30 is maintaining an ADR 400+ pips consistently,this is why some days you just won't have a trade and that's fine.I trade the daily range in my telegram channel,if this is fine tuned ,you'll get 90% + accuracy.Keep it up good work,thank you for sharing this fantastic system which requires zero indicators

Hi forex 1x8

Can you show a chart, bit confused what open time you are trading is it start of the day at midnight or 14.30pm my time in the UK

Thanks

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Friend good afternoon I put here just one suggestion to make it easier.

But I work in another way.

This asset is enough to accompany in M30 or M15 to facilitate the VISUALIZATION.

1) I only buy above the opening line. I only sell below the opening line.

2) OPENING PRICE IS A GREAT FRIEND. PUT THIS ON YOUR HEAD.

3) PUT OUT PENDING ORDERS IN THESE TOP AND BACKGROUND GROUPS Place pending orders and let Esike act.

Go and see previous days ... just place pending orders below or above those points.

A hug and good weekend.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
see the operation I did a little while ago.

down 30.855 sell stop at 30.850

--- 帖子 #34 ---
I do not do operations at the end of the day, especially on a Friday, but I will leave an example of how I work.

see that the high of the day was 31.266

A simple BUY STOP at 31.270 would be another 50 pips in your pocket.

NOTE: Do not operate at this time.

It was just an example.

1 yellow high of the day

2 blue break from the day's high

Good weekend

Thank you for the EA, but is it not possible to code the EA for Mt4?

In the first test the TP is 50 pips and TL 35 as shown in the strategy.

ts  sell stop 30.455

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Friends know what the biggest problem of small fish operators? DO NOT HAVE PATIENCE

The topic is the opening price of US30 and see that we already have other assets in the topic.

The method is very simple, it does not need any EA. It requires little time to place only 2 pending orders. And what happens? People have no patience. Today was the 5th day of operations.

day 2/3 TP

day 3/3 TS

day 4/3 TP

day 5/3 2x TP

day 8/3 TS

We can change the TS or not even have it. We can change the TP.

The topic is US30 because I only tested US30.

What operators lack is PATIENCE.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
I WILL EXPLAIN A LITTLE BETTER WHAT I DO IN MY OPERATIONS.

See that as soon as the market opened, the price went up and at that moment we do nothing, the price went up and went down. So we leave a pending order above the high. The high was 31,737, so we left a pending order at 31,745 (No. 6)

Important to remember (ABOVE THE OPENING PRICE, ONLY PLACE BUY STOP AND BELOW THE OPENING PRICE, ONLY PLACE SELL STOP). AT THAT TIME THE LOW DAY WAS 31,629, THAT WE HAD ON THE FIRST M30 CANDLE. THEN WE PLACE A SELL STOP AT 31,620 (Nº1). THAT I DID, BECAUSE I LIKE TO TAKE THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY BELOW AND ABOVE. SEE THE PEAK WE HAVE AT 31.668 (No.), I HAVE ALREADY LEFT A BUY STOP ORDER AT 31.675

SEE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES WE HAD No. 2,3,4 THE MORE DEPTH, THE MORE DANGEROUS THE PRICE RETURNS, BUT THE OPPORTUNITIES EXIST.

EARN 1% A DAY, YOU DO NOT NEED TO STAY LOOKING AT A LOT OF PAIRS, YOU DO NOT NEED TO STAY LOOKING AT A LOT OF INDICATORS, YOU DO NOT NEED ANY (EXPERTS). REQUIRES PATIENCE ONLY.

GREEN PIPS FOR EVERYONE.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Brillant!!! You know what it takes to trade for a living forex1x8,like myself.Some will take all of 2021 and beyond and still not understand.The method is simple US30 ADR presently is just perfect for such operations,the only thing I would add is the daily pivot if I have too but unnecessary, less lines/indis/lag on my chart is healthier for my trading.When I lose trades and levels become invalidated my entry price in real time and not some indicator i was looking at hoping for a delayed response.Keep up your good work

good thread title

also Nasdac--great volatility first 30 min of each US opening

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Yes brother, Salaams....

You are right,I don't want to make mention of it here too much,however i did adjusted it to 150 pips,above and below DOP.

Post #46,it can be traded exactly the same,thanks for the advice

soo, first 30 min candle will be the reference point? sell below and buy above. Or is it from the opening price of the day? Meaning you will often take a trade in the first 30 min? Or wait for first 30 min candle to close and after that put your stop-orders in? You only take one trade per day?

[quote = ulle73; 13442475] {quote} soo, i primi 30 minuti di candela saranno il punto di riferimento? vendi sotto e compra sopra. O è dal prezzo di apertura della giornata? Significa che farai spesso uno scambio nei primi 30 minuti? O aspettare che i primi 30 minuti di candela si chiudano e poi inserire i tuoi ordini di stop? Esegui solo uno scambio al giorno? [/ Quote]

Every 30 minutes  "IF" the high or the low of M30 does a new DAILY high or low, you can set a buy stop or a sell stop with 50 pips of SL.

This is what I have understood.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
There are many questions ... but I will try to explain something.

Not necessarily the first 30 minutes.

This US30 asset gives us hints.

We know that this asset has a daily ADR of at least 400 pips.

He in Tokyo and London usually makes 100 to 250 pips in that period.

Always try to observe (very important) 1st low, below the opening price.

1st high, above the opening price. The price usually breaks these PRIMARY entries and we always win 50 pips. Just look at other days spent on your chart.

I do a few trades a day, but try to win on the primary entrances. price goes deep and comes back ,,, price goes up a lot and comes back ...

Just look at the active US30 ... we don't need anything else. Celebrate a wedding with US30 and you will be happy for the rest of your life.

ts buy stop 30.855

--- 帖子 #56 ---
I just want to say thank you...

--- 帖子 #57 ---
We all know that the head was made to think and not just put on a hat.

I like to leave suggestions for us to analyze.

Something very interesting to test could be the following:

SELL stop 80 pips below the opening price, with a stop of 100 pips. (stop will always be 20 pips above the opening price) Place 160 pips of TP.

BUY stop 80 pips above the opening price, with a stop of 100 pips. (stop will always be 20 pips below the opening price) Place 160 pips of TP.

Having a favorable risk versus reward is always good.

These suggestions are always to facilitate

--- 帖子 #58 ---
This is backtest of a lifetime ,I will try using my head for that purpose only,any hat found at home will be dumped ,lol

Thank you again

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Let's start a new approach, but without losing sight of it.

Opening price was 31.898

The first low, below the opening price is 31.894, so we will leave a sell stop at 31.885.

Price is going up, we will continue to observe. For now, only the sell stop at 31.885

--- 帖子 #60 ---
No. 1) 1st low, below the opening price is 31.894, so we will leave a sell stop at 31.885.

No. 2) Price tried to rise and came back from the high at 32.007, on the M30 candle of 22:30 yesterday.

No. 3) 1st high, above the opening price is 31.997, so let's leave a buy stop at 32.015 (above 31.997 today and above 32.007 rejected)

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Hello,

SL at 100 pips? Thank you.

Hello forex1x8, great system.....however sideways buying and selling,when the market is at this state, at liquidity zones HH and LL will eat up profits once earned previously.Your initial post #1 has been back tested and shown excellent earnings and low drawdown.US30 does not sit flat all day as history has proven.Just something I noted and needed to mention.Thank you.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Hello,

Have you experienced a whipsaw when trading US30? This normally happens when the price action based on volatility fills both your buySTOP and sellSTOP and almost immediately hunt your stopLOSS?

934rex

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Hey Rex,welcome to FF my friend

Good question,in trading all instruments whipsaw is possible,the thing is are we going through that lol...or stay far and observe.The trading system setup with rules will either allow you to trade this condition or not.Well,filling BS and SS actually the range in pips are so far apart,one will hit TP allowing 50 pips most times,hunting SL might just be losing 100 pips.I backtested his main strategy as in post #1 for 2021 thus far and it seems as though leaving a gap in price before it makes a decision for direction is a good thing,rather than sitting at the pc waiting for the next HH or LL,the idea of entering at the 1st high above OP and 1st low below OP can add even more to this system together with 200 pips BS/SS.Everyone has a different style,check it out,we can discuss further...

--- 帖子 #66 ---
@SCSSTNT Are you trading the system today?

What do you mean by: "leaving a gap in price before it makes a decision for direction is a good thing"

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Thank you friends, scsstnt and 934rex for participating.

Leave here something that is clear to me, at that moment:

BUY STOP 32.040

SELL STOP 31.860

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Your open price is different then mine.

When I used indicator in post #1

I'm getting an OP of 31932

I have sell stop at 31732 and buy stop at 32132

hmmmm

Will attempt this with the OP on my chart.

Thanks a lot for sharing this.

--- 帖子 #69 ---
In the begining i thought i was reading charts wrong for OP but now i think i also have the different open price on my charts.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
So far we only have 158 pips of ADR.

For this ADR to increase, the price will have to break the day's low at 31.871 or the day's high at 32.029

that's why:

BUY STOP 32.040

SELL STOP 31.860

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Hi sofiecoco, Yes I am trading the system today.

"leaving a gap in price before it makes a decision for direction is a good thing"

Let me define the above,in markets when ranging or consolidating,we somewhat get whipsawed in the present conditions opening buy/sells SL being hit and overall having crazy drawdown.US30 as forex1x8 and I mentioned has an ADR of 400+ pips,if we consider the data from the last 20 trading days.Lets says you place BS/SS 200 pips from OP,this means 50% of 20 day ADR,we backtest this data and assign 100 pips SL and TP as 50 (the main idea is to let price breathe,many times the OP of the day will get broken,eg: buy above and a retest will occur back to OP or lower and it continues up).Overall win-rate calculated.When I do this backtest i'm looking for losing streaks,if its very minimal thats fine,a higher losing streak i can use some mathematical formula and apply loss recovery,only if things get out of hand.Thanks for asking.....I trade full time BTW :-)

--- 帖子 #72 ---

Market structure broken on M1(early visibility) ,my initial run was 50 pips to the finish line but price stumbled I closed for 28 pips @32124.50 I saw it there,a mirror image of yesterday's high,break and retest lower.When an active trade has almost hit TP,never allow a winner to become a loser.This will allow you to have almost zero drawdown and minimal losing positions.US30 is amazing for everyday,every session trading,lets make this thread a hit!

I think those 00 levels are called psychological numbers. Because traders tend to buy and sell at those levels. Most times, they axt as Supports & Resistance or DemandZONE and SupplyZONE.

You're in the 10% that actually earns in trading,congrats,thats how you minimise DD

Psychological levels are market price levels which are often key levels in forex denoted by round numbers. These round numbers frequently act as levels of support and/or resistance. Psychological support and resistance consistently work because of fundamental human disposition.

Just a very particular opinion.

In the world of investments and financial mechanics, anything can happen ...

ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN

What I'm going to talk about has nothing to do with our method, but in this case, I think it's important.

See how the D1 candle closed ...

I believe that today's candle is also red ... so that means, that we will have the price below the opening line.

SELL only

This is a thread about LEVELS without the use of any indicator and neither about candle patterns. No need to add other instruments. Robson is here to testify the goodness of his strategy with trues results.

But I am a hard head and love to study candles and I beg pardon if I am going to share my analysis of the D1 candle and how, in spite of the red candle about yesterday, it was reasonable to suppose that the trend was going on.

I think that a deeper analysis may be useful without complicating anything.

Friends good afternoon

I can't understand what's going on in your head.

For just 1 week, I opened this topic to show how I am succeeding in the Financial Market.

I am showing how my entries are in advance and then I put the results in a real account.

In the initial 200 pips distance system of the opening price, there was still no STOP LOSS.

I have also included it as my tickets, which I do every day in a very simple way. Success is there.

After a week after so much effort to keep posting everything I do, what do we see?

These first put a lot of indicators on the topic.

What do you intend with all these indicators?

Do you want the indicators to predict the future and show us where the price goes? or is it just for the aesthetics of the chart?

Friends as patients of patience, discipline and focus, not indicators.

See the graphic of # post 01

It must be hard to believe that someone makes money in such a simple way, as the chart in # post 01.

I thought a lot about opening the Topic, because it only gives me work and nothing else. I found that with a system as simple and profitable, as people didn't need anything else. MISTAKEN.

Here at Forex Factory it will always be like this, I have been there before.

Let's continue the work. I wish you luck with the indicators.

The method I explained is very simple, I believe that I don't need to explain anything anymore.

A hug to everyone.

[quote = forex1x8; 13446142] Amici buon pomeriggio, non riesco a capire cosa ti stia succedendo per la testa. Per solo 1 settimana, ho aperto questo argomento per mostrare come sto avendo successo nel mercato finanziario. Sto mostrando in anticipo come sono le mie voci e poi metto i risultati in un conto reale. Nel sistema di distanza iniziale di 200 pips del prezzo di apertura, non c'era ancora STOP LOSS. L'ho anche incluso nei miei biglietti, cosa che faccio ogni giorno in modo molto semplice. Il successo è lì. Dopo una settimana dopo così tanti sforzi per continuare a pubblicare tutto ciò che faccio, cosa vediamo? Per prima cosa mettono molti indicatori sull'argomento. Cosa intendi con tutti questi indicatori? Vuoi che gli indicatori prevedano il futuro e ci mostrino dove va il prezzo? o è solo per l'estetica del grafico? Amici come pazienti di pazienza, disciplina e concentrazione, non indicatori. Guarda il grafico di # post 01 Deve essere difficile credere che qualcuno guadagni in un modo così semplice, come il grafico in # post 01. Ho pensato molto all'apertura del Topic, perché mi dà solo lavoro e nient'altro. L'ho scoperto con un sistema semplice e redditizio, poiché le persone non avevano bisogno di nient'altro. ERRATO. Qui a Forex Factory sarà sempre così, ci sono già stato. Continuiamo il lavoro. Ti auguro buona fortuna con gli indicatori. Il metodo che ho spiegato è molto semplice, credo di non aver più bisogno di spiegare nulla. Un abbraccio a tutti. [/ Quote] poiché le persone non avevano bisogno di nient'altro. ERRATO.

Dear friend, it is not a question that traders likes indicator; traders look to have control about trading. Your trading system is based only on statistics and on the hope that every day it goes on gaining or, at least, the sum at the end of the week or the month is in gain. It is a very simple system, a "set and forgets" system. Very good for newbies but not enough for experienced traders who can work all day and are used to analyze the chart. You too did not stop working only with 200 levels on daily open, but added daily high and low and also work on these levels.

In this thread, you have offered a very good basic idea, and we thank you for this but everybody, and this happens with every thread, likes to suit the strategy conforming own personality, experience, and instruments. No one strategy of Forex Factory remains pure as in the beginning and this is the richness of the dialogue.

I am in accord that somebody has gone out too much from the original thread, and it can cause confusion, but until everybody can give their own contribution with educating attitude, why not? If it is not concerning about the thread, we can ignore it.

Now let´s go on because we are going on well.

Abraço irmão.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
IMPORTANT!

To support the original thread I want to remember that since 1 of march we have had seven-win trades with 50 pips and one defeat with -100 pips.

Total gain until now, 250 pips.

Trailing stop has not been considered.

Take care that pips can be much more if we divide the lot into two trades, one with 50 pips TP and the other trade with 200 pips of TP.

For example, today the price has done 300 pips above the 200 pips level.

This opportunity can solve the possible loss of previous trades.

I invite you to test the strategy on a demo account without adding anything.

Ok, I'm a bit confused. Can anyone please explain how last March, the Dow Jones plummetted like never before due to bad news regarding Covid-19, and yet since then, not only has it recovered but continually makes new highs, almost on a daily basis. How?? Who is pumping this money in (we are not talking about small-time investors here)? Is Biden now lobbing billions/trillions into it as Trump did, just to make things look better than they actually are, whilst also negating one of Trump's so-called legacies (1st time ever hitting 30,000)? This is all despite the fact that there has been nothing but bad news and total chaos since last March....racism and the black lives matter movement; impeachments; alleged rigged elections; Capitol riots; delayed vaccines; more and more covid deaths etc. It's like all news, whether it be good or catastrophic is good for the Dow since last March. If Biden kicked the bucket in the morning, Dow goes up. If Biden was told he would live for another 50 years, Dow goes up. If Trump kicked the bucket, Dow goes up. If Trump declared his intention to go again in 2024, Dow goes up. Anyone care to enlighten me? Would very much appreciate it

Unfortunately all good ideas, this happens. hard for most to trade without indicators cos they look so cool. then we have an inherent need to feel successful too. I would rather take what is presented in its form and if i have refinements, use that myself instead of having to hijack and bombard someone else thread.

There is also always a need for an EA. like if all the indicators and EA's worked for you, use it and leave people's thread alone.

thank you forex1x8 for a simple yet very effective system you using.

Let's go to work.

You were able to analyze that, in the great majority of times, we have a strong movement of the US30 asset as of 16:30 (broker).

We will set a target for the next 50 business days of operation.

We are going to set a goal to win 100 entries of 50 pips.

We have 2 entry models.

1º) Pending orders 200 pips away from the opening price.

2º) Orders pending on the tops and bottoms that appear during the day. Above the opening price, we only place BUY orders and below, we only place SELL orders.

Challenge launched, let's try together to win 100 entries of 50 pips.

Come on !!!

Which is better to use, ADR or ATR ?

10Q

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Mate

one easy click and you can get pretty much anything... one explanation. I hope this helps

What is ADR and ADR?

First things first - What is ADR - ADR is simply the average of intraday (High-Low) value. This excludes Gaps. So - What is ATR? - Here is a better explanation. Essentially ATR is a range calculation which includes Gaps as it calculates from PDC (Previous Day Close). So it essentially boils down to the significance of Gaps.

Why not a buy trade at that level?

Hello lorecavoli,

The high above OP which at that time was the HH previous candle has a busy stop and reaching that candle you highlighted,the gain was just 38 pips,going for 50 and TP hit next 7 candles,so there had an active trade going on.

I guess you said you don't trade on Fridays.

Thank you guys very much for good work done, kudos! I been reading  this Post for a while.

I have a question for you guys.Are you guys following the 200 pips below or above the daily 30 minutes opening candle or trading the HH or HL below the opening candle?English isn't my mother tongue so you guys should pardon my grammatical errors.

SELL STOP 32.395

You know why ... at that moment ADR in 198 pips. we know that the average ADR is 400 pips. For this ADR to go to 400 pips, the price will have to go up to one side or the other of our entries.

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Well, the week has ended. Let´s go to see the results of pure strategy +200/-200 without TS.

We have had 4 days with + 50 pips = 200 pips of gain and one day with a loss of 100 pips.

Total 100 pips.

Different results are with Trailing Stop. The loss is clearly minor, but also the gain. But it is difficult to see if the price did runs without coming back and to take TS.

All this working a few minutes in the night. No other work is needed. All the rest of the day you are free to do whatever you want or you have to do.

Let´s observe that on days 8 and 10 the price hit not only 50 pips but did run until the next level +400. This means 200 pips more of the gain.

This means also that the loss of day 9 of - 100 pips should have been recovered by splitting the lot into two trades if money management allows it.

Another observation is that, on day 9, the price came back to the line price. This means that for those who can follow the market he can recover the loss. But about this let´s talk another time.

Good weekend to this group and green pips.

Good evening all. Thanks to forex 1X8 for the thread.

I've run some trades on a small demo. Image and trades are attached. All trades had the trailing stop and all winners got to full TP. (The aqua and red solid lines show the previous day highs and lows. The only losing trade could not get above the aqua line).

Five winners and one loser, for net 300 - 100 = 200 pips.  (sorry chart doesn't show 4 March trade which was a winner).

--- 帖子 #186 ---
For both methods?

--- 帖子 #187 ---
jeanlouie made a Boxes_from_Open indicator lately which could be helpful for this - don't know - I'll add the file(s) here which produces such a chart.

You have to adjust the pip digit parameter for your need (it's now set to 10 - my WS30 has only 1 Digit).

If not useful - ignore or delete - I didn't read every post here

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Good morning everyone.

I will try to explain in a simple way what method 2 is.

what is ADR? Simply put, ADR is the difference between the high of the day (32.952) and low of the day (32.777) see the image. At the moment, we have 174.60 pips of ADR.

We know that the greatest volatility of this asset occurs after 16:30 (broker)

We know that this pair at least has a daily ADR of 400 pips, right?

Let's reason !!! If the asset has an average daily ADR of 400 pips and when it arrives at 16:30 it has 174.60 pips of ADR, it is likely that it will run 225.40 pips. So for this ADR to reach the daily average of 400 pips, this asset will have to run 225.40 pips down from 32.777 or up from 32.952, so at that moment we have to stop.

BUY STOP 32.960

SELL STOP 32.765

responding to friend Lorecavoli # post 186 Answer: we will put the stop 20 pips below the opening price and our TP will be half (50%) of the stop. see how it will look.

BUY STOP 32.960

STOP 32.834 (20 pips down from the opening price) 126 pips of STOP loss.

TP 33.023 (63 pips). (50% of 126 pips of stop loss)

SELL STOP 32.765

STOP 32.874 (20 pips above the opening price) 109 pips of STOP loss.

TP 32.710 (55 pips). (50% of 109 pips of stop loss)

NOTE: I WILL LEAVE THE ADR IMAGE INDICATOR

A HUG

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Great call bro!

I don't have time for indicators. Waiting all day for the Indicator gives a signal to lose money.

Those who want to make a profit in the market, have to forget indicators.

This should be quote of the year,lol

The only indicator is my brain,I told many trading friends that ,some may disagree,if they continue to lose,maybe they should adopt this habit.

Why would you follow a lagging indicator,when price is showing you its real time value,this is enough in trading,I'd add horizontal lines and my one and only ADR (no lag) Indicator,which is based on mathematical average of 1-20 days period.

Hi today, Dj30 scored Sl by trading the traditional method from post 1.  The previous week was fruitful because it was 5 TP, while today, unfortunately, the first SL

--- 帖子 #203 ---
200 pips away today was STOP LOSS. So I suggest reading # post 188 and trying to run it every day. The buy and sell position every day is better positioned. just look at previous days when I also put the entries.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
Sorry that we hit SL today,it will happen and is a guarantee in trading,keep going,recovery will happen soon,don't stop.......of course when you risk well enough no panic or fear,this trading system is not famous for long losing streaks. 58.2% ADR = 305 pips so far,another trade is still possible

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Is it worth trying today and am I set up well ?

--- 帖子 #206 ---
The biggest tip that this asset can give you is your ADR.

Arriving at 16:00 (broker). Look at the high and low of the day and place the pending orders.

Another great tip.

Look at the high and low of the H4 sail from (13 to 17 hs) ... price most often breaks the high and low of this H4 candle from (13 to 17 hs).

I like simplicity. see in the image the break of the H4 candle that closes at 17 o'clock (broker) see how many days you would have won. do you really need indicators?

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Am I reading the ADR today - 304.75 pips. Does this mean that the price should still go 96 pips above today's high

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Note that to get 400 pips of ADR the price will have to break the low at 32.652 or go above 32.952.

I think that today it must be difficult, but nothing impossible for this asset.

Look for 16 o'clock Broker tomorrow to look at the high and low of the day and place the pending orders.

Operate safely, wait tomorrow. This asset has great opportunities every day.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
And how do you set TP and SL at the breakout of H4 decision candle with Hi / Low and the time of the 16 o'clock broker ???  Also TP for 50 pips and SL for 100 pips or maybe otherwise ???

--- 帖子 #210 ---
What I put here serves only as a suggestion.

I have been talking about TP and defined Stop, simply to facilitate the operator.

see that I already suggested stop loss in # post 184 (a good idea) Regarding the TP, you can place 50% of your stop loss.

The ideal for any professional trader is to earn 3x1 in their operations.

Are we able to win 3x1 with the US30 asset? WE HAVE, but we have to create a method and start doing it every day.

An asset that runs 400 pips of ADR per day, I believe it is feasible to place 33 pips of stop and 100 pips of TP, but we have to do it.

a hug

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Today SL has been hit.

The price came back to Open Line. It does this very often.

It is possible to recover the loss for those who follow martingale strategies.

Greetings FX1x8 - Thanks for the thread which gives options to trade this big beast. I am working on a way to establish some rules for the different ideas you have produced so far. The first plan is the one posted on page 1 - the Open Price Trade. I think I have the conditions covered as in the chart below so can you please confirm this is what you are looking for with the daily open?  Attached Image (click to enlarge)

My GamePlan 2 uses your H4 Sail idea but I need your help to establish the timing please.

The candle that CLOSES at 1700 Broker does generally seem to break the range of the previous bar. Can you confirm if I have interpreted your idea correctly. Chart is attached also.

My next step is to get a better understanding of how you are using the ADR  - I think I am grasping it but will post again a bit later to see if you can help a bit more. Many thanks to you,

ADR currently 17.1% = 92 pips

We expecting a powerful breakout soon,lets see how this goes

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Me shows 89.50 pips, so today a very small ADR, so actually at the entrance of New York Sesion there should be a big price move

--- 帖子 #217 ---
Good morning ...

let's get to work.

day high = 32.996

day low = 32.903

Very low ADR, 93 pips only.

A great opportunity to win a lot of pips.

BUY STOP 33.010

STOP 32.935

TP 33.085

SELL STOP 32.890

STOP 32.975

TP 32.815

1) stop 20 pips below and above the opening price

2) tp a little higher, because ADR is very low

3) High and low can change at any time.

Green pips for everyone

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Yes Nolan exactly,it usually does,only time can tell,should be 100 pips (50x2) if price reaches ADR max or even 80%+

Forex1x8 H4 Sail Trade - I think the OP has given us a great idea with his Sail Trade. If anyone is interested in a quick look at how productive this might be I have applied a freely available Daily Line Box indicator from FF threads to his original H4 chart from post 206. Below the H4 is the H1 chart showing the breakouts. The indicator is attached.

Goodnight Friends

look at my # post 219.

You put so many indicators that get in the way. It doesn't matter which TF you use.

At 16 o'clock (broker) the high and low of the asset was the same value at that time.

The high was32.996 The low was 32.903 Place pending orders below and above.

Stop loss 20 pips below the opening price for the BUY STOP pending order.

Stop loss 20 above the opening price for pending SELL STOP orders.

Stop inventing ...

Very simple.

[quote = WooDex; 13454895] {quote} Ciao, sto cercando di capire i tempi, gli orari del nostro broker potrebbero essere diversi. Quindi diciamo per esempio, stai prendendo 4 ore negli US Open o qualcos'altro? Grazie {image} [/ quote]

Don´t stress yourself with timezone.

What time is in your country when in your broker is 16:00?

In that time you go to look what are the last high and low of the daily price and place your pending order.

Hi @forex1x8,

Many thanks for sharing your strategy. I´m opening a new demo account and I will be posting the results here. I also will be practising with Hong Kong index as I live here and it´s quite volatyl as well. For instance have a look at this visual test using 200 pips as per the original strategy.

Cordiali saluti, CGN {image} [/ quote]

I have seen it just now HK50 and it should be very interesting!

Maybe it should be better to test it with less space as 150 pips or 100 pips so as to catch the initial impulse at the opening.

It's no use.

They are stubborn.

Has no patience

They are using the ADR indicator I don't know what for.

The ADR indicator is just for us to know if the ADR is low or not.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Let's go to work

Try to explain one more time.

High of the day so far 32.909 so the BUY STOP will be 32.920

Low of the day so far 32.802 so the SELL STOP will be 32.790

What will the stops be?

Opening price was 32.888, so the stops will look like this.

BUY STOP 32.920 STOP at 32.868 (20 pips below the opening price)

SELL STOP 32.790 STOP at 32.920 (20 pips above the opening price would be 32.908, but as we have an increase in that value, we rounded it up to 32.920)

Place the TP at least 50% of the STOP LOSS value

green pips

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Here is my US30_M30 chart for your kind perusal and comment(s), plse fx1x8.

The marked candle spiked just above the +20 entry level, but I was awake and moved the entry, simply because I could see it was running out of steam so to speak.

Otherwise rather simple and effective way to trade.

Looking forward to this afternoon's opening @ Chicago opening.

Continued success to you in spite of people wanting to do their own thing.

Hercs.

You are talking about daily open right now? i got mixed up between strategies explained in here.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Unfortunately for me, but SL and TP were only 2 pips and the price turned back. What broker do you use if you can ask ??  I had Tp set to 50 pips and unfortunately I ran out of 2 pips and the price dropped to SL

--- 帖子 #253 ---
we are in a great channel of congestion

put buy on support bounce

--- 帖子 #254 ---
My broker is Valutrades.

Any questions, contact me forex1x8@gmail.com

I will not talk about brokerage in the topic.

A hug

--- 帖子 #255 ---
he does not seem to want to answer that, sometimes he say daily open +-20 pips, then sometimes he say swinghigh/swinglow +-20 pips....

--- 帖子 #256 ---
no, it depends on broker. If i use 2000 pips this is what it looks like

--- 帖子 #257 ---
[quote = WooDex; 13456064] {quote} Stai parlando di apertura quotidiana in questo momento? mi sono confuso tra le strategie spiegate qui. [/ quote]

You are right to be confused.

Here there are two strategies: one that I call +200/-200 and which is at the beginning of the thread.

The other one is a strategy of the breakout at 16:00 of own broker on US30.

Robson is now talking every day about this second strategy.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
I'm talking about the second strategy because the price is not coming in the distance of 200 pips.

And I already explained that this high and low strategy of the day is much more favorable.

Everything is very clear. What I see is that people don't want to follow what I do and insist on staying on topic. They do neither.

Who doesn't want to follow what I'm doing, just follow another path.

Everything is very clear.

In # post 148 I talk about both methods.

--- 帖子 #259 ---
so taking orders on every +-20 pip low/high swings, a choppy day you will get killed? Also, what TF you use when using the swing high/low trades? since that will matter as well.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
Is it good example in the right chart circled with red?

Daily High and Daily Low before 16:00

Thank you

--- 帖子 #261 ---
They asked me, why at today's BUY STOP 32.920 entrance did I put a TP of just 50 pips?

ANSWER :

See the highs of the day 15/03 at 32.992

of the day 16/03 at 32.996

Always put my TP before, so I don't have to face this resistance zone, that's why my TP was 32.970

--- 帖子 #262 ---
could you please share your template and indis? thanks, easy and clear!

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Here you go, but they are just for visualizing, does not do any impact, decisions would be the same as without them.

Attached template is only for US30 (DJI30)

I think that fits the second strategy of forex1x8

--- 帖子 #264 ---
You can see how different brokers are, because today the price made a new high Your new high is on 16.03, and today hmm It's a fight with windmills when it comes to brokers, unfortunately

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Buy at HOD (high of the day) created when ADR had not been exhausted,less than 100% of course, SL should be 20 pips below OP (opening price) ,TP ''AT LEAST'' 50% of your SL as suggested.Never let a winner turn loser,always lock in the profit,that zone was hard to breakthrough earlier...I use FBS,but Valutrades seems decent with low fees

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Price in a crate.

Just put:

BUY STOP 33.010

SELL STOP 32.790

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Done, thank you

--- 帖子 #268 ---
Will your buy/sell stops become invalid at the end of day? Are you keeping the market structure in a crate until breakout occurs? Thanks

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Come on

If it doesn't break, it's because the crate remains, so why take out pending orders?

If it remains, you can leave.

We don't have that control.

At any time, these zones are violated and no indicator will warn you.

You will be asleep and you will wake up with a profit.

always simple

Green pips

--- 帖子 #270 ---
Its an interesting strategy that looks simple and straightforward enough however there is some confusion of what to follow as there seems to be 2 different approaches here.

We have the one on the first post and then another approach later on. I think this is what is confusing some people and if the OP could clear this up on the first post perhaps it would help a lot.

--- 帖子 #271 ---
ok I understand,generally I know market structure but your method, I was just asking so I'd be clear about your style of trading more as we follow.Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Everyone already knows that we have 2 methods. It is confused who wants to be confused.

1st method (200 pips away)

# Post 01 is the simple way, but it is more dangerous and there are days when we have no operations, and operations can be activated with the price already sold out and we take a stop.

2nd method (daily highs and lows)

This method requires people to think a little, but nowadays, the WORLD is too lazy to think. I already explained in the days:

03/15 # post 188

03/16 # post 218 and 234

today # post 248

I print the entries, and explain why stop and TP.

Just keep a clean graph and nothing else. Tops and bottoms of the day.

Lazy traders want to know what?

Alerts Red indicators for selling

Green indicators to buy

This has to be taken more seriously.

There will always be risks. See that I showed the tickets in advance on the 15th, 16th and today and explained.

To be drawing on the graph after it has already happened. A ready-made engineer already has many.

Green pips

--- 帖子 #273 ---
See what I say

Leave pending orders ....

Victory comes, even though you are sleeping.

TP + 50 pips

--- 帖子 #274 ---
its been Fed Interest Rate Decision

Good job

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Thanks for your reply. Perhaps if the 2nd method is recommended by you over the first method you can explain it on the first post in more detail for new readers to learn and understand clearly without confusion.

A new high at 33.068

Do I need to say what has to be done?

--- 帖子 #277 ---

--- 帖子 #278 ---
As I said

"Do I need to say what should be done?"

BUY STOP at 33.075

+ 50 pips

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #280 ---
you have your opening line way off

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Sorry friend, but you are more lost than blind in shooting.

See what I said in # post 277 The high became 33,068, so we placed a pending BUY STOP order above that high.

The method is to place pending orders on the highs and lows that are forming.

Above the opening price, we place pending BUY STOP orders with the Stop loss 20 pips below the opening price.

Below the opening price, we place pending SELL STOP orders with a stop loss 20 pips above the opening price.

The price moves like we're going up and down stairs. The problem is that the operators have no patience and want to take the elevator.

The opening price today was 33.029. We will only sell and look for a SELL STOP when the price crosses below the opening price. As long as the price is above the opening price, we will only look for tops and place BUY STOP.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
forex1x8, I think that ulle73 was quoting Binne's chart lol

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Ok get some rest,you seems you over-worked my friend,take it easy...they just ask more to learn exactly what you do,as its new to everyone.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Hey buddy -  I am using AxiTrader MT4 which has a server time of GMT+3. My opening could be different to other brokers for sure. Means too that the candles will form differently. Principal still the same - Buy Stop order above latest High if price is above the open or Sell Stop order below latest Low if price is below the open.
Stoplosses 20 under the low if going LONG or 20 above the high if going SHORT.
The OP has suggested various ways to skin this cat - work out which one suits your style and make it your own.
1. Daily Open 200 move
2. H4 Sail Trade looking for breakout at the 17.00 candle
3. Crate / Stairstep trades where pending orders are placed above or below latest highs & lows with stops of 20 above or below the Opening Price. Target at least 50%        of the StopLoss. Use the ADR to tell you where you are during the day and help to see if price has room to travel.

I am not around a chart for the H4 Sail Trade 1700 time frame ( 3am here in NZ ) so that leaves me the Daily Open which I will adjust to suit my style or I can look at the new highs/lows forming throughout the day and place Stop Orders as needed. Thanks to Forex1x8 for the ideas. I have had a look at these strategies on other high volume / fast moving instruments as well and they look promising too. ( Bitcoin / Dax / HangSeng ) Principals are all the same.

Hi, i do not get it. According to what strategy you have placed orders?

daily how/high before 1600 is clear.

buy stop is 100 pips from daily opening.

Green lines is your orders.

Blue lines daily High/low

What i do not understand is, why non of these buy/sell stop fit one of 2 strategies.

Thank you!!

P.S.

It might be H4 candle high low before market open, but then we have different candle heights, because those levels of buy/sell does not fit to my broker H4

--- 帖子 #297 ---
WooDex,you need to calculate the highs and lows right now,place pending orders buy/sell SL as suggested 20 pips below OP when buying and 20 pips above for selling....volume,volatility all present at the moment,this is where ADR shots to maximum on,best time for taking profit

--- 帖子 #298 ---
At 32 pips in profit,target was 41 ,I will NEVER watch my SL (83 pips) being hit without moving into break even.If I don't do this,I rather sit in a casino all day and gamble.That's why we TRADE,you can change the outcome,reduce risk increase profit before the game is over!

What I undertood is that at 17 of your broker you check your swing high and swing low and then you set buy stop on the swing high with a stop loss 20 pips below the opening and set a sell stop on the swing low with a stop loss of 20 above the opening...

HelloFRIEND,

Cost of a pip depends on your LotSIZE and Broker used.

For Hugo'sway,

For a 0.01 LotSIZE = Micro LotSIZE, 1 pip move = $1.00

For a 0.1 LotSIZE = Mini LotSIZE, 1 pip move = $10.00

For a 1.00 LotSIZE = Standard LotSIZE, 1 pip move = $100.00

Then you can do the multipliers of 2x, 3x, 4x, etc

Let me know if you have additional questions.

As long as the OUTCOME is INCOME.. We are Gucci good

Hi thanks,

I mean the real value of 1 pip in US30. Let's say, in EURUSD it is 0.0001. How much in US30?

--- 帖子 #340 ---
At Valutrades

01 pip

Lot 0.01= $ 0.10

Lot 0.10 = $ 1.00

Lot 1.00 = $ 10.00

--- 帖子 #341 ---
You have to wait and don't rush.

Place orders after 16hs (broker)

High so far 32.997

Download so far 32.871

--- 帖子 #342 ---
Yes Paul, it depends your LotSIZE and Broker you are using.

No fixed value amount.... it's ALL relative.

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Thanks for pointing that out.

The values vary with Brokers.

Good catch.

I heard that INGOT BROKER is very good for US30 as well..

Friends my name is Robson, I'm from Brazil.

I've been in the market since 2007. I've already lost a lot of money.

I'm here to try to help and make sure you don't lose as I already did.

I don't want anything from anyone. I'm not a candidate for anything ... (laughs)

I've used all kinds of indicators you can imagine and I've just lost money.

That's why I created the topic ... to say, that you will not be successful in the world of investments and traders with indicators.

We will continue the work in a simple way.

Just a few hours of daily dedication.

Good weekend for all.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
What is puzzling most users here,is the manner in which you are rounding off prices and placing them to buy/sell stops......maybe it needs some further explaining,like how many pips from low of the day or high of the day you're entering trades. Thanks again Robson,by the way,the screenshot,that's your platform.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Exactly.

This is the setup ... see # Post 01

Regarding rounding, I can say the following.

The price usually punctuates ... leaving pending orders at least 10 pips from the low and high.

The price when it breaks, goes away. There is no reason to keep saving pips.

WhattaDUMP on US30!

--- 帖子 #352 ---
OB - order blocks,but i'm not going to discuss that here,but glad you asked,an important thing,FBS has its expiry on the DOW today,platform is locked!

Another great reason to be trading US30 on Valutrades,I have seen the platform rates/fees are very low,this is Robson's choice,decent broker

--- 帖子 #353 ---
Thanks for your time again Robson,do have a great relaxing weekend,be safe with the family

--- 帖子 #354 ---
See why placing a pending order and not working with any Indicator.

DOESN'T GIVE TIME TO FOLLOW THE MARKET, WAITING FOR INDICATOR SIGNS.

SEE JUST THESE 02 FIRST CANDLES OF M1 AT BREAK

01 minute candle nº 1 (Opening 32.871 and low 32.831 40 pips)

01 minute candle nº 2 (32.835 aperture and 32.801 low 34 pips)

These first two candles break more than 70 pips in just 2 minutes ...

Whoever went to the bathroom stopped winning. When the indicator shows what the operator has to do (kkkkkkk) ... the price has already gone ...

--- 帖子 #355 ---
You are right! Price Action is key. See Price Action on M30.

Looking like we might get some retracement b4 another dump.

Thanks very much, Robson.

I agree about being patient and therefore I don't wish to mess it up with such action.

Continued success to you.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
I would like to clear some simples and basic concepts for somebody who is a newbie or comes from other trading systems with indicators at the cost to repeat what Robson already has spoken repetitively.

We are working only on the breakout of daily levels BEFORE 16.00 hours. Robson adds more o less than 10 pips up the levels to open pending orders because the price can pick the daily level and come back. We need a true breakout.

The price is so speedy in that hour indicators are too slow for giving some interesting signal.

Only some experienced and quick traders can anticipate the movement of the next candle with some indicator, but, at the moment, we don´t need indicators.

The only indicator we use is ADR.

It measures the number of pips of each day, 5 days, 10 days, and 20 days.

The medium of pips of every day is 400 pips.

Sometimes it takes two days to complete 400 pips, but it does 400 pips at least.

So we have two true pieces of information: US30 does at least 400 pips and h: 16:00 is the hour oh higher volatility.

The fewer pips it does before 16:00 hours as shown in the ADR, the higher will be the volatility at 16:00 and we can take advantage of profitable trades. The strict is the canal between daily high and low before 16:00 hours, the violent will be the breakout. It is how to work with assets on news of high impact.

We are far away to exhaust the argument: we have to front and recover eventually losses and to have the right money management. We are all invited to improve the method, but leaving it SIMPLES !!!, without complications and headache.

Happy weekend!

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Good Explanation FlashPaul......Averages work well and its part of Math,Add math,Further Match etc. and it does hold true with very high probabilities in trading,I would think ADR is my #1 Indicator for daily range.Think of ADR as your path getting TO and FROM work each day,you drive 50KM from home to work.Some days you go further,to the malls,banks,supermarkets,airports,of course you drive much more than 50KM lets say 100KM.This is when ADR exceeds 100% of its AVERAGE DAILY RANGE like a huge trend develops in US30,an example today 470 PIPS as I now type,however,the AVERAGE for the last 5 days were 326 PIPS.We are never guaranteed 100% ADR EVERY DAY(this is why its termed averages). I can say that in the last 20 trading days US30 ADR has 95% chance of 50-60% of its daily range.Equates to the probability of  95% of the time you'll have 256/307 PIPS per day,based on the last 20 days.

100% of the time you'll have 153/205 pips each day

Why Sell @32440?

For me it's in the middle of nowhere

Where is your DO?

--- 帖子 #399 ---
I see now, fair enough.

I have a cBot in cTrader that will simultaneously place a buy and sell stop order at x amounts of pips away at an exact time of my choosing, with one cancels the other option too, so I don't need to scramble in the noise. You think I should set this for half an hour before as well or you think I should set this to execute right at market open since it is instant and automatic?

--- 帖子 #400 ---
@forex1x8

Where is your DO?

Mine is 32585.00

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Just tried this out for fun with my cBot. Placed a buy and sell stop at exactly 09:29:59 NY time. It ended up taking the buy trade very quickly and then closing in 55 pips profit before the market reversed and plummeted. Anyone else get similar result?

So plus 2 points for me.

Please correct me, when my entry is wrong!

--- 帖子 #407 ---
I'm working on a variation of this strategy as I don't like the inverted RR, will forward test it and see how it compares.

The main rules are the same, but using a different approach with the SL & TP so it has a more favorable RR.

--- 帖子 #408 ---
In my personal opinion it should be better at 16:29 on M30 chart.

Does your EA work also in US30?

Has it a recovery system?

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Agreed, a screenshot would be great, anyways @FlashPaul explained that @Forex1x8 round up / down 10 pips from the HH&LL

--- 帖子 #410 ---
It looks like a kindergarten here.

I showed my pending entries in # post 397 ... Need to draw?

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Maybe there is a difference in Price for each broker...

My last HH has been @32627 plus 10 points for giving a bit room to breath my buy stop would be @32637...

@forey1x8

Why did you choose only 40 points for your profit target?

--- 帖子 #412 ---
It is a very simple logic.

The high was 32.642

The low was 32.449

We had an ADR of only 193 pips (difference from high and low)

What is the simple logic? ADR only increases when high and low are violated.

If we had an ADR of 193 pips and knowing that to reach 400 pips we have to violate the high and the low, so the pending orders at those points.

If the price stays up and down without violating the highs and lows, the ADR does not change

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Excellent chart,english language is quite simple,some still don't understand lol.....I'd love to invite you to my telegram group Robson.....and show you how i trade the daily range 90%,got all my history in trading charts,not promoting anything here and i will not reply to PMs,users asking me to join.....i know the good,the bad and the ugly at FF,since i was temporarily suspended over the weekend

--- 帖子 #414 ---
There's no need for those derogatory comments to people who are interested in learning your strategy. There is apparently still some confusion as to how you make your trade decisions (nothing is clear cut) and as you chose to open a thread and share your strategy here publicly its to be expected to get some questions from members asking for more clarity on the rules and trade decisions.

Perhaps as a thread starter maybe having some more politeness and friendliness and less derogatory comments would come across more approachable. Its just a little advice. If you don't want to take a little time to explain better to member then why open the thread?

Ou você prefere falar em português?

--- 帖子 #415 ---
How many times have I said the same thing? Just look at previous publications. I just published the pending orders in # post 397. Just make a horizontal line in the same place as the pending orders that you will know. People are lazy, they don't even bother to copy my orders to understand. There is no doubt about it. There is laziness and lack of discipline. If you start copying pending orders, you will see that orders are always above the high and below the low. You will notice that I always leave a distance. It is easier to ask than to read ,,, and copy.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
what broker do you use for setup entries? in the initial post you mention just 200

--- 帖子 #417 ---
Sorry, but I don't get it...

When the ADR is only at 193 points, there are another 207 points on the table. I see no reason for cutting down the TP.

I would understand it when ADR would be at 350 for example, showing that the price movement of the day is pretty much exhausted.

--- 帖子 #418 ---
[quote = chinchano; 13463491] {quote} quale broker usi per le voci di configurazione? nel post iniziale citi solo 200 [/ quote]

Broker: Valutrades.

The initial post is concerning a breakout strategy based on levels +/- 200 pips up and below the open price.

Because not always these levels are caught, another strategy is applied before the NY opening market always on US30 and looking for the previous high and low daily price before 16:00 of own broker, rounding about 10 pips up and down.

The ADR shows the potential breakout measuring the difference of pips between this day and previous days.

Totally agree with you on that money management thing!

But Iam just trying to understand the way you trade this system!

That's why Iam asking all these questions. And I thought there is a reason behind it, why you went only for 40 points instead of the regular 50. Maybe a specific level of interest, support or resistance or whatever kind of technical analysis I haven't seen...

At the end it sounds like you are just happy with 40 points on a monday afternoon (at least afternoon here in germany )

--- 帖子 #422 ---
see friend

my TP at entry 32.650 was only 40 pips for two reasons

1st reason) My Stop was 32.573 (20 pips below the opening price). So my stop was 77 pips only (see that I already talked about having at least a 50%  TP)

2nd reason) I like to put my TPs in order not to face the round numbers ... the price was going in the direction of 32.700, so I like to put it before. see what price was up to 32.697 and came back.

Taking the opportunity to see a little more of what I do.

The price, as I said, was up to 32.697, making a new high.

So what did I do?

I put a BUY STOP at 32.710 and see the result. + 80 pips. This asset, we have to go eating piece by piece of the cake.

If the piece is too big, we can choke.

A brotherly hug.

@Andy,I think the 16:00 brokers time works at his local time.I have archives from my broker from.2015 to 2021 and I can tell you with authority that by 16:00 GMT the action on the market is already gone.14:30 GMT is the best to draw your Daily HH and LL.

--- 帖子 #432 ---
thanks kp.  And what time do you use as your 'daily open' ?

--- 帖子 #433 ---
When you read the post from the beginning he gave an indicator that gives the daily open.I will entreat you to download that indicator and add to your trading chat

--- 帖子 #434 ---
The indicator has a time delta value so you can set to any hour.  As we are all in different timezones I am trying to work out exactly what time "open" is and "16:00".  All brokers differ so you can't say "broker time" otherwise the method will create different trades in different timezones

--- 帖子 #435 ---
I use the default time of the Indicator as daily open.And it's normally 1:00 am GMT.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Just check your Broker server time or better still look at your MT4 above the Market watch list. This is your broker's time. I use ICmarket +3 GMT/UTC

--- 帖子 #437 ---
I think there's knowledge in what you just said .So the forex1x8 should kindly tell us which time zone is his broker so that  people can calculate it in their own brokers time zone but for me the 1:00 am GMT and 14:30 H and L works for me checking back from the year 2015 till now

For how long do we hold open pending orders?

Until they get triggered or do we close them at the end of the session?

--- 帖子 #446 ---
That is the question of those who do not have the patience to wait.

See that the ADR as long as it does not violate the low and high of the day, it remains intact at 248 pips.

If the orders are not triggered, what will the operator lose? Nothing.

Start to observe more of what I say. Look at the price, it went up and it was close to the opening price and it came back. So I am talking about placing the Stops after the opening price.

We need entries most likely to win; so I only buy when the price is above the opening price, and only sell when the price is below the opening price.

Trading on the market is the art of patience. There is no point in winning by winning and without knowing what you are doing. We have to maintain consistency in the victories.

If pending operations are not triggered, we end the day and delete it. But we know what we are doing.

ADR still 248 pips. take it easy !!!

--- 帖子 #447 ---
[quote = sofiecoco; 13465234] È il massimo / minimo della candela di 4 ore o il massimo / minimo della giornata? [/ quote]

I have a suggestion to solve this confusion.

Open a D1 chart at 15:00 of own broker or one hour before the NY market open.

Look at high and low.

Mark buy stop 10 pips above daily high in that hour; SL is 20 pips below the Open Line.

Mark sell stop 10 below daily low in that hour; SL is 20 pips above the Open Line.

Mesure the difference between Buy stop and Open Line and set above a TP which is 50% of this difference.

Mesure the difference between Sell stop and Open Line and set below a TP which is 50% of this difference.

That´s all.

There is a possibility to work with break out of H4 and H1 candle.  But this is another strategy that is not concerned with this thread.

Is this a good US30 bot? i made this bot and this was for the year of 2020

Had a profit factor of 1.8

started with 50k ended with over 400k traded 1 lot

--- 帖子 #451 ---
so the last 6 months of the year was pretty much breakeven?

--- 帖子 #452 ---
Slight profit, around 30k

This strategy mainly relies on volatility, better than a loss right

I need to do more testing because if every year is like this where i get a huge bump in the curve and then sit still for the rest of the year that still seems good to me

Mate,

For some reason the pending orders were closed at 21:42:27 ? They were to closed if not triggered at 23:00:00

Anyway no damaged done.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Simple to solve. Change the expiry date of the pending orders to until the next day. At the end of the day you exclude

--- 帖子 #469 ---
Yes, of course thank you all for your assistance in this matter. However, it shouldn't have closed at that time. By the way I have had all most of my pending orders setup at the same time and they did closed if not triggered at 23:00...

Anyway  will try tonight again!!!

--- 帖子 #470 ---
I just setup a demo account with value trades for testing purposes, plus with valutrades it is possible to trade mini and micro lots on the US30...

I have compared the open prices between Valutrades and  IC Markets:

Todays open prices:

Valutrades: 32481.85

IC Markets: 32466.00

It's a slight difference of 15 points....

I will further compare the open prices and have a look how it affects the system, especially when trading towards round numbers.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
Friend The important thing is the price of the highs and lows ... the opening price is only relevant for placing the stop loss. Follow the idea of the job. green pips always

I put a buy stop at 32575.

Its too early to put a buy stop. Wait another 45minutes.

I would like to leave just one observation.

BUY STOP INPUTS at levels 85 to 00, I always place at level above 00 (always level 10).

SELL STOP INPUTS at levels 15 to 00, I always put it below level 00 (always level 90).

I don't place my tickets on top or very close to level 00.

This is important

Friends would like your attention once again.Come on !!!

I see that friends have already understood how I work.

I am satisfied with the results. My account is real at Valutrades and you already know that.

We are now going to the stage of becoming professional.

1) We have a Fantastic asset.

2) We have a good method

But we have to improve our risk x reward, but for that, we have to be much more disciplined.

How to improve risk versus reward?

See, we are most of the time putting a 100 pips stop to get 50 pips. We are getting the victories, but is that correct? I do not think so. Why?

When we get a Stop, it can happen on any day. Stop will profit from 2 days of work.

remember if : our goal is to make a living from operations. our goal is to pay our bills, with the profits obtained from the operations, and for that reason, WE CANNOT HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE RISK X REWARD.

I want to leave a suggestion that we have a 1x3 risk reward.

Risk reward of 1x3 is for example to place a STOP of 20 pips with TP of 60 pips, or 33 pips of stop and 100 pips of TP.

With this 1x3 nomenclature, our wins need only be 30% to be in the 5% of operators that make a profit in the Financial Market.

This is just a suggestion. As I always say, each operator has to do their financial administration.

See that today I did a test, putting 20 pips of STOP and 60 pips of TP and obtained victory.

Green pips to everyone

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Good point. And what do you think of moving the stop loss to breakeven when you are in profit at 1:1 RR?

--- 帖子 #492 ---
Welcome to FF Mr. Marvin,you dive into a deep liquidity pool :-) about 200 metres in depth, always keep the lifejacket very close in case of emergency exit

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Just as an example, see how I put my configuration of 20 pips of STOP and 60 pips of TP, using the Expert Esike that I put in #post 01.

At Valutrades I have an ECN account that charges me $ 6 for each lot. it is worth it.

So my configuration of the way of the image that I am leaving.

60.6 pips of TP, I add 0.6 pips more to pay the commission.

19.4 pips of STOP, because when I take a stop, I lose 20 pips just right, as there will be a commission charge of 0.6 pips.

I put 42 pips of protection, guaranteeing 2 pips. Arriving at 42 pips, the STOP moves, guaranteeing me 2 pips of profit, to pay the commission for the operation.

A great observation that we can make on this asset, is a greater degree of discipline when we place a risk x reward 1x3, is that we are subject to take more Stops and the price goes back to TS. This is part ... The important thing is to have at least 2 full victories in the week. I believe we can get good results, but we need to place orders.

Green pips always.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Thank you

I have to say that I was trading forex since 2010 - 2015 and lost heaps of money... Jumped from system to system and so on... You probably know the game

In 2015 I then fell into some health issues plus kind of a burnout and I had to make massive changes to my lifestyle! So trading was done for me.

Now I feel better and was looking for an easy and simple strategy, stumbled over this one here, and here Iam again in this sharktank

Lets see how the journey ends

Hopefully not with

--- 帖子 #495 ---
@forex1x8

And you don't think 20 points SL isn't to tight?

Sure, we can have 3losses out of 4 trades and are breakeven...

--- 帖子 #496 ---
That is a big question.

I think it's tight, but we have to try.

Making entries for 22,23 and today.

day 22 = TS

day 23 = + 60 pips

today = + 60 pips

I believe that 33 pips of STOP with 100 pips of TP is cool.

It turns out that the operator, has to be very patient to take STOP and TS and not give up keeping at least 30% of wins.

The 60 pips road is shorter than 100 pips. I will continue with 20 pips of stop and 60 pips of TP.

Note that the first M01 candle that breaks the high or low is an average candle with 20 to 35 pips ... it is always an explosion. We have to know how to explore that.

Good luck.

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Well yeah, we have to find out what's working in our favour!

Maybe 25 to 75 or 30 to 90 is an idea too!

I like this strategy and I think with a good RR it can be really profitable.

I've been experimenting with different approaches to the RR and think there are a number of ways to do this, which one is best will need some more forward testing.

One way I've been testing is using 50% of the total hi/low and setting a 1:1 RR so far this has hit TP almost every time.

Another way is it use ADR % as the SL & TP. This is something I'm still working on and needs more work. Like using perhaps 50% of the ADR as SL with a minimum of 1:1. I'm not a fan of the current inverted RR and 1:1 would be the minimum RR to use, preferably 1:2 if its possible.

I also won't open any position if by the time we about to set the pending orders and the ADR is over 50% for the day.

I think with some smart approach to the RR this can be a very good and simple profitable strategy.

--- 帖子 #500 ---
hey mrdfx

do you think this strategy could have potential as an EA

blam

--- 帖子 #501 ---
This is what we need. Just think and do the tests. Thank you very much

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Friend the method is so simple ...

just place pending orders.

See that I have a VPS that the broker Valutrades gives me

I usually leave my ESIKE Experts( # post 01)  on the graph of my VPS activated, so from anywhere on the phone I can look at the low and high and place the pending orders ...

I don't need to do anything else ,,, because when you activate the Esike input on the VPS, it will put the TP and STOP.

We don't need an EA to place these entries.

We just need patience and nothing else.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
ESIKE is a very powerful tool,set and walk away,the only harm to your acct is its human input if you make an error,its really good.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Good night friends.

In pursuit of satisfactory (Risk X Reward) 1x3

For greater security in operations, as 20 pips of Stop Loss can be very short, I leave below two suggestions for configuring the Experts Esike found in # post 01.

1st configuration suggestion image 01

33 pips of STOP LOSS

100 pips of TP

42 protection pips

2nd image configuration suggestion 02

50 pips of STOP LOSS

150 pips of TP

42 protection pips

--- 帖子 #505 ---
I think the 100P TP is easily achievable the question lays with the SL. A bit more work to do!

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Now, before I start. I must confess that unfortunately I have no coding or mathematical skills hence me asking:

Is there anyway that we could have a similar tool as ADR....sort of speak that would calculate retracement..? Can we explore this proposition or is it to far fetch...?

I have seen your skills first hand in a few of your threads, anything there that we could use? Many thanks

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Friend agree with you. Really the biggest difficulty is the stop loss. The only thing I ask my friends is that we don't make the topic complicated. Let's keep the system simple .... I have a very particular opinion that the market is dynamic, we will take STOP LOSS. As the market is dynamic and I believe that we will not always maintain the standard. There are days when we will need 50 pips or 100 pips of stop loss and other days only 20 pips. THE MOST IMPORTANT IS EACH OPERATOR CREATE A STANDARD AND WE WIN IN PROBABILITY. 2 FULL WINDS IN THE WEEK WITH 1X3

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Yes, agreed! I like you I am not interested with indicators (example below) however, if we had an idea of retracement it would provide us with a better probability of winners don't you think? I won't mention it again it is your thread and your method and I respect that.

Anyway, I'll be testing 1x3 from now.

--- 帖子 #509 ---
excuse me

this is of no use

--- 帖子 #510 ---
This is a good idea. I have been trying this too. I have set up my FIB tool on mt4 accordingly. I am trying few other things. If the results are decent I will post them.

--- 帖子 #511 ---
The only thing I don't know about Esike EA is does it only operate after a buy stop or sell stop has been activated. I can not always be at my screen at NY open time in order to set the stop order and it would be ideal if I could find an EA that could set the stop at the appropriate time and level.

Love this method, I believe it is less open to stop hunting by the big players due to it being linked to the actual stock market action.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Since Iam trading on demo, I will go from now on with two orders each (2 buy pending and 2 sell pending)

One is goin for a 1:1 RR, 50p SL and 50p TP, risk 2%, Breakeven +2 at 35p.

The other one will be a 1:3 RR, 25p SL and 75p TP, risk 2%, , Breakeven +2 at 40p.

Just trying

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Friend Mr Marvin See this configuration, placing 20 pips in "Trail Activation", can be the solution to our problems. What will happen in practice? As I said, the 1st M01 candle that breaks the high or low, it is usually 20 to 35 pips. Therefore, by placing 20 pips in "Trail Activation", as soon as the price reaches 20 pips of Profit, the stop loss that in this example starts with 49.40 pips, goes to 20 pips.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
Good one!!!

Will set up the trailing

Cheers mate!

Today the ADR is already at 64% due to pre market volatility so I won't open any positions (well maybe in demo just to see what will happen) but from what I see if ADR has already moved more than 50% before we set our pending orders its hard to reach TP.

A question to all if anybody else has thought on these lines :

We are looking for combined ASIA and London Session BO during NewYork Session.

Can we trade the same BO of ASIA session during London Open Time?

Is this a good idea ...can we try or has any one tried?

Lets discuss this. Everything remains the same except ASIA session BO during London Open.

Got the same levels as @forex1x8

Iam curious too if we can reach a 50p or 75p target.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
New ideas are always good, but don't be fooled by this asset. 90% of the time we arrive in NY with less than 250 pips of ADR.

Only take advantage of the explosion that we have in NY. I have been following this asset for a long time. Entries in other periods (Asia and Lodres) ... never try to win more than 50 pips.

A hug

--- 帖子 #524 ---
what broker do you use for this prices?

--- 帖子 #525 ---
Just the suggestion of a jester.

Follow the rules ... it will make you confused.

If you have a DEMO account, there is no reason not to do it.

If you are in a real account ,,, place the lot of 0.01

We will never know what the MARKET (laughs lol), Sharks want to do ... so, follow the path ....

several times I have seen this asset make 800, 900 and 1000 pips of ADR.

High to SELL STOP is 337.  ADR is about 400, which leaves only 63 points.  Most of the ADR range is already consumed.  What is your TP for todays sell?

--- 帖子 #528 ---
SL on my sell orders!

25p & 50p of SL were definately to tight for today!

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Look at using the h/l of the 5min bar that triggers the order.  So initial SL at say 50, then after 5 minutes move it to the h/l of the last bar.  This gives a really tight SL back within the range.  If trade is good then price should breakout quickly and run away from the SL towards TP

--- 帖子 #530 ---
can you solve my question?

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Everything is very relative.

I put a 50 pips STOp and lost.

Whoever put a stop of 100 pips with 50 pips of TP ,,, is victorious.

- 50 pips

This question has been asked and answered many times, perhaps try reading the whole thread instead of the first and last pages.

I did actually use 100 pips SL,too tight for this instrument,something I need to check os the ATR for SL,an idea I had,I still like your version of 20 pips above and below the opening price :-) I know R2R is life support in trading,its everything

Small loss,this is nothing compared to your overall win-rate,what is most important we never get emotionally sick when it happens,but you rather smile knowing that the system is real,losses occur anytime,actually when my SL gets hit,I'm stronger than before and NOT in revenge mode ever! There are always going to have more days,we accept minimal calculated losses,knowing this is just a temporary state.......trading is a great deal of common sense and no books will teach you that!

Around 50 pips I closed 0.05 and left the other part to run SL moved into +5 pips,which was hit.

2nd trade was a sell limit,yes i did use 100 pips again.However,I was considering the long way up in terms of recalculations 220 pips from sell stop to 20 pips above opening price (stop loss) then divided by 2 gives 110 pips(50% stop loss range),then I figured out 55-110 pips would been hit....then I exit early

--- 帖子 #540 ---
The levels that you quote, on my platform (AVA) happened 2 hours before NY open.

On my platform the low of the day prior to NY open was 32140?

I traded 32170 (200 below the open with 60 SL and lost, 100 SL would have TP

I traded next at 32150 just before NY open and had TP using 100 SL

For me a BE day that could have been so good with my old SL of 100

We learn every day, perhaps leave experiments to demo accounts!

Hi, just one note. Even if it is the US30fut. we can apply the same concept/rules .... and it works ... at least on my side because I do not have access to us30 with my broker.

The market loves to go to our stops, so the stop loss cannot be tightened.

I made a new entry and searched for + 150 pips.

after the low or the high breaks, the price is unlikely to go the other way.

Pice entries may be very different in each broker.

Robson uses Valutrades, but everybody has their own broker and has to look at daily high/low one hour before high volatility time.

On Valutrades this time is 16:00. Open your chart and look at the big candle in H1 in the NY session.

Set your daily high/low trades one hour before this time. In Valutrades it is 15:00 hours.

In the image, the box shows the candles 15:00/16:00 and 16:00/17:00 and the daily high/low at that time.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
So I placed the order in demo just to see what if, and it hit TP.

I set the SL at 50% of the hi/low so the SL did not get hit and TP was set at 1:1 RR so it was reached successfully.

That makes it 4/4 so far this week with my variation.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Interesting ,was is ADR high/low? High/low that price made before 16:00hrs ?

I ignored the ADR for the demo trade. At the time of the pending orders the ADR was at 65%.

Re entry is based on his vast experience. I did not look into reentry.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
I made a post previously which doesn't seem to have caught anyones attention. However initial reviews I've done look good.

Enter the trade after break of the daily h/l level, with an arbitrary SL (say 100). After the current 5min bar closes (so in 1-5 minutes time), move the stop to 5 pips beyond the h/l of the 5 min bar that has broken the daily high/low level.

Initial observations suggest when the break happens, price moves away strongly.

Today is a great day, to see how sharks act.

They put the price up and down, and make the traders take their stops.

Indicator turns red, operator sells .... price goes up to the stop.

Indicator turns green, operator buys ... price goes down to the stop.

Price will only move for real, when it breaks the high or the low.

Anything can happen.

As I said. "Operating is the art of patience"

The Buy stop was triggered and did not arrive at Tp and returned to TS, for a few pips.

What to do?

1st option) Place a new pending order, at the new daily maximum.

2nd option) Do nothing and just wait if the price will trigger the pending SELL STOP order.

What we can't do

1st option) Think that the price will go down because it stopped or failed to win the TP

2nd option) Keep making one entry after another to recover the stop loss

3rd option) In this case today, sell before the price goes below the opening line.

4th option) NEVER change the planning. Taking TS or worse ... Leaving operation without STOP LOSS ... NEVER DO THIS.

Have patience and discipline.

The probability of winning with this method is very high. On the day that doesn't work. ACCEPT ... turn off the computer and go do another activity. Do this, even if it is in DEMO account.

Not forgetting ... "anything can happen"

Today, who put TS did not win, but did not lose money.

Who did not put TS, took stop ... but this is part of the Financial market. Next week we have more opportunities.

Good weekend

Thanks for this great system!

I think I found my sweetspot for RR too.

With a close to 70% winrate, I can happily use TP: 50 and SL: 70 and still have a profit factor of ~ 1.5

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Today hit TP using my variation.

Came close to reaching SL, but did not get taken out. This brings the weeks testing to 5/5, 100%.. Very impressive.

I was lucky today my stop was missed by 2 and managed a profit although I didn't wait for the full TP as you can see.

I am attaching my trades since I started with this strategy on the 19 March, quite happy with the results of course, as you will see also traded a few times on forex.

Those who were patient today and had decent sl were winners.

THIS TEXT WAS FROM YESTERDAY I CANNOT PUBLISH

I am always making some observations.

In post # 571 I said if it broke the high would go to 33.000 I ended up placing a pending order at 32.911, as it created a new daily maximum in the zone of 32.890, I won + 120 pips (see image)

Another observation that I always make, price above the opening price, we have to look only for purchase, thus, as price below the opening price, only sale. So the idea of always placing the stop loss 20 pips away from the opening price. See today how many times the price tried to pass down and failed.

See also the observation I made on #post 583 .... I said: " ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN" Do you know why you said that? Until recently ADR was 269 pips, don't forget ... this asset will always seek a daily average of 400 pips.

I ended up winning a 120 pips entry at the end of the day, putting the buy stop at 32.911

I will leave one more important note for you to note over the weekend.

THIS ASSET USES TO GO FROM ONE ROUND NUMBER TO THE OTHER ... FOR EXAMPLE ... 32.700 TO 32.800 ... 32.900 ... 33.000 AFTER 33.100 .... IT IS NOT A RULE, BUT IT'S A TIP.

THE 02 BEST BUY STOP ENTRY LEVELS ARE:

BUY STOP LEVELS (10 AND 20) WHAT IS LEVEL 10 AND 20?  32.810, 32.820 .... 32.910, 32.920 .... BECAUSE THESE LEVELS HAVE ALREADY PASSED THE ROUND NUMBERS.

THE 02 BEST SELL STOP ENTRY LEVELS ARE: SELL STOP LEVELS (90 AND 80) WHAT IS 90 AND 80 LEVEL? 32.690, 32.680 .... 32.590, 32.580 .... BECAUSE THESE LEVELS HAVE ALREADY BEEN ABOUT ROUND NUMBERS.

This tip is very good

Good weekend

GOOD AFTERNOON FRIENDS.

I have been observing and do not know the statistics, as I did not have time to see the past, but this week I will have a new nomenclature in my settings. Those who somehow manage to see the past, from this configuration please, let us know.

As already mentioned here the first minute of explosion we have an M01 candle with 20 to 35 pips, so I will make the entries this week here in the topic like this:

10 pips of STOP

50 pips of TP

15 pips of TS, guaranteeing 5 pips.

A hug to everyone.

They do a lot of nonsense and don't focus on the rules.

Keep going like this, you won't learn EVER !!! Do you know why?

They do not know how to wait for the best time to negotiate. HAS NO PATIENCE.

They don't know what they're doing ... if they get the entry right they'll post the results here and brag about it ....

If you miss the entries, ... they will not heat up, as they are in DEMO account ... you have no responsibility.

Wait ...

See how many days we earn ... just knowing and having the patience to wait?

I didn't come here to train :-)...I do this for a living and if you don't see that 0-50% (traders should make use of this volatile period) ADR the market moves 100% means everyday, that you can accept 50-150 pips at the  opening before your particular trading session starts tomorrow,not everyday will the market give you a breakout my friend,what is the most volatile period for any trading session? First 2-3 hrs when it now opens......be open to ideas you can learn so much more about US30 in many ways.

It is confusing when things are shared that arent about the strategy.

Appreciate your analysis scsstnt but

Can we stick to discussing the breakout strategy?

--- 帖子 #646 ---
I see a war coming, pity!

I agree we stick to the strategy as per the owner of the thread. If anyone has a different angle they should start their own thread, just my penny of advice.

So far this strategy has proved profitable, for me anyway, so I am going to implement when I can at the time suggested on my own platform, with my own tp and sl settings. If I want to experiment I'll play with my risk , tp and sl but the time is in my opinion sacrosanct.

Good trading all

--- 帖子 #647 ---
I agree with you. Its natural for all of them to find something else.But we should not dilute the purpose of this thread and strategy.

Even though i found few things exciting here and there , I didn't post anything. We must allow the thread operator to run his rules based strategy.

--- 帖子 #648 ---
I want to try something with Esike Trader.

There are sometimes opportunities to get a big ride from the market when it moves a long way, so after reaching my TP 50 for my first trade I want to have the EA allow my second trade to BE at +50 and then trail the stop by 10 thereafter. The second trade would have to be on another chart, so 2 charts open with different EA settings. The TP for the second trade will be how far the ADR has to go to reach 400 for the day.

I am not very good at understanding the EA TS settings, so any help will be appreciated.

--- 帖子 #649 ---
The very nature of the EA is for trending conditions,yes it does give you a long ride,your buying and selling transactions got to be totally different my friend,if you need to catch the early bird.You are guaranteed 200 pips each day on US30,this is why in my previous message I spoke about the reason of catching 0-50% ADR move,but I know its not part of the strategy,just giving ideas and that's where I am today,because of extensive research.I use that word with pride and statistical calculation,because i've have been working with ADR for years now.What might be of great importance is the retracement and tail price leaves at times before big moves.Esike Trader is a great tool.

Friends this past week I have been very busy with personal work.

The method remains the same, look at maximum and minimum and place orders, see hohe # post 685

I have no doubt that I have to do it, the only thing I have to finish checking is the risk x favorable reward. I have already talked about this subject here, but people do not do tests.

I believe that placing a STOP of 10 pips with a TP of 30 pips can be a good ....

As I said, the 1st M1 candle, usually goes from 20 to 34 pips.

We can use ESIKE with the configuration that I will leave:

STOP 10 pips

TP 30 pips

TS 5 pips guaranteeing 1.2 pips

This is just a suggestion of a risk x favorable reward, as you can place 20 stop and 60 TP or 15/45 or 25/75

A hug to everyone

Friend, thank you

I wonder what an EA for?

At 16 o'clock (broker), the operator just has to place the pending orders at the maximum and minimum of the day, until that time and adjust the STOP and TP by the Experts Esike that I left in # post 01.

I don't see reasons for an EA, but if you have any ideas ... please ,,,, feel free.

my email is: forex1x8@gmail.com

in case you want to speak in private.

A hug

--- 帖子 #690 ---
With an ea, you could do a backtesting for several years and thus be able to configure a correct SL and TP, I do not ask for anything in return, only a correct setup of how to perform pending orders.

Sorry for my bad English, I use google translator, I speak Spanish.

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Friend

The EA you want to do must have the following:

1) Magic number

2) Time (start and end) when the operator will choose for the EA to check the maximum and minimum and put O BUY STOP and SELL STOP

3) Distance at which the maximum and minimum orders pending orders will be pending (5 pips, 10 pips etc ...)

4) TP (pips)

5) STOP LOSS (pips)

6) Trailing STOP (pips)

7) spread (The operator will choose until which spread the EA will accept to make the entries)

I believe that this is the basics that we need for this method. This method is very private and simple ... it doesn't need a lot of resources.

Grateful

--- 帖子 #692 ---
I've tried using the daily highs and lows till 12PM (brokertime, backtest showed best results), its working and I have it for forward testing.

The results are quite good but US30 isn't consistent over time, plus it doesn't consider yesterdays high (or when should it).

It also places new stop orders immediatly at the new highs/lows within the same day.

I think I could do better by just manually placing and use EsikieTrader.

since 4th jan 2021 :

--- 帖子 #693 ---
I would be interested in an EA if forex1x8 is ok with that

blam

--- 帖子 #694 ---
I am currently forward testing an EA which has been adapted to trade this strategy.

Back tests prove promising and with a reasonable profit to use as an additional strategy to incorporate, but further testing is needed to find the optimized settings.

I will say that using a fixed SL of 100 pips and TP of 50 did not make a profit in the last year. I am working on some adaptions of different MM approaches and when I have something solid I'll share. I'll also ask the developer of the EA if he doesn't mind I share it here for others.

Oi Robinho,

Your maximum was 33.584.

You set Buy Stop at 33.610. There are 26 pips difference.

So, did you pick that because of those "BUY STOP LEVELS (10 AND 20)" mentioned before at #591 ? Or because of the previous Daily High ?

Obrigado.

See friend, you touched on the subject and today what I've been talking about has happened. Price set the SELL STOp entry at 33.420 and went to the round number 33.400

IT IS NOT A RULE, BUT THE BEST ENTRIES ARE.

1) BUY STOP ENTRIES

1-A) PRICE ABOVE OPENING PRICE

2-B) PENDING ENTRIES AT LEVELS 10 OR 20, WITH SUGGESTED TP, AT LEVELS 80 OR 90, TO NOT FACE THE ABOVE ROUND NUMBER.

2) SELL STOP INPUTS

2-A) PRICE BELOW THE OPENING PRICE

2-B) PENDING ENTRIES AT LEVELS 90 OR 80, WITH SUGGESTED TP, AT LEVELS 20 AND 10, NOT TO FACE THE ROUND NUMBER BELOW.

IT IS NOT A RULE, BUT THESE ENTRIES HAVE A GREATER PROBABILITY TO FLOW.

I canceled the pending order, you know why?

For two reasons

Yes we need to be careful. The drop will come soon.

--- 帖子 #714 ---
A friend asked me, why do I talk so much about the opening price of the D1 candle.?

I answered:

You can see that the opening price serves as a wall ... it went up, we only buy and down, we only sell. But you see, that after the price goes to one side, the opening price serves as a wall, it creates a resistance, so the price does not go back to the other side. (just look at the broker's 21:00 today), price tried to pass up and failed, clearly saying that "we want to go down !!!"

The opening price of the D1 candle anticipates how it will close. If the price is below the close, we will have a red candle, if above, we will have a very obvious green one (laughs) ... This anticipates what we can do in the future, just a tip. What do you mean, anticipate the future? I already had a topic in which I said that when a D1 candle has its red closure for the first time that it has changed ,,,, the probability of the next day's D1 candle, closing red is very big, but that is another conversation.

Note: just one more tip. See that the opening price of the WEEKLY candle (W1) was 33.270. This value is important, because if we have the price by Friday closing a weekly candle below 33.270, we may have next week, a week of low.

I like to see the market in a simple way;

A hug to everyone.

Are you using SL = 20 pips from the open price OR 33 pips from the order (TP = 100 pips) ?

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Dear friend, It all depends on where the price is. I like quick operations. For you to have an idea, I have made trades with 20 pips of stop loss and 10 pips of TP (quick profit in the pocket). If you have time, take a look at the pending orders placed every day and see how many you would have lost and won by placing 20 pips of stop and 10 pips of TP. The suggestions I give here are to make the operator think and not to wait for indicator signals. The market is not easy. We have a great method here, it is enough for each operator to have discipline and do a good Risk x Reward Management.

--- 帖子 #718 ---
Dear friend,

As I can see ADR of us30 is still ~400.

What do you think about your starting idea:

Stop 100 pips

Tp 50 pips

TS 35 pips guarantees 2 pips of profit

?

--- 帖子 #719 ---
4/5 losses, since using BE thats about 12-14 winners in a row for breakeven. This system will not work in the long run

--- 帖子 #720 ---
Friend I work my entries making calculation of risk x reward by percentage.

I will always win the same amount of money or lose the same amount, regardless of my TP and STOP. The only difference is the speed of operations. I'll give you an example with a 5k account.

1% risk = $ 50 dollars

Reward 0.5% = $ 25 dollars

INPUT 1)

STOP 100 pips

TP 50 pips

My lot in this entry will be 0.05 ($ 0.50) per pip

STOP 100 x $ 0.50 = $ 50 dollars

TP 50 x $ 0.50 = $ 25 dollars

INPUT 2)

STOP 20 pips

TP 10 pips

My lot in this entry will be 0.25 ($ 2.50) per pip

STOP 20 x $ 2.50 = $ 50 dollars

TP 10 x $ 2.50 = $ 25 dollars

My risk x reward is the same in both operations, the difference is that one operation will be faster than the other. Whatever my STOP and TP, my risk x reward is always the same.

I have a preference for faster negotiations, because the market changes very fast, but as I said. Each operator has to do the best money management.

A hug and green pips.

Dear forex1x8!

Excuse me, but my question was not about a r|r calculation. It was about profit\loss targets idea based on ADR (as you wrote it at your 1st post). What do you think right about this?

Thank you for your thoughts!

--- 帖子 #726 ---
The ADR of the active US30 averages 400 pips per day.

I just showed in the explanation of # post 722 that we can earn the same amount, without needing the asset to run too much.

We are having days, when the asset is locked, due to what I said a little in # post 714.

If I can earn 0.5% needing only 10 pips, why expect 50 pips? This is an argument.

On the day the asset runs 400, 500, 600 pips, how many times can I earn 10 pips?

There will be days when the asset will run 500, 700, 900 pips ... If I am earning my 0.5%, or 1% a day ,,,, I will be happy in the same way, as today ... until now the ADR 193 pips and I have already made my daily goal.

The operator has to follow a line of reasoning.

How many tips have I given here?

1) Orders pending 200 pips from the opening price.

2) maximum and minimum at 16:00 (BROKER)

3) Orders pending at the closing of candles H4 (from 9 to 13) or (13 to 17)

I gave these tips, and how many are doing?

I already spoke here and I will repeat "I HAVE ALREADY LOST A LOT OF MONEY IN THE MARKET", I found a path with this US30 asset and I follow this asset EVERYDAY.

I can talk without bragging, that I have been making a profit every day, so I am passing this on to you.

I see that most people want a magic formula and do not want to make the effort.

The method is so simple that people don't.

Anyway, one of the great tips that the market gives us ... is the opening price ... Just see now ;;; price went up and down and parked at the opening price ... indicating that bears and bulls are in a great battle.

A big hug

Hi

This instrument is just like any other, it just so happens that it is related to a market that opens at 9.30 NY time, it is a futures instrument so it trades on an expectation of where the real market will go and not what it actually is doing because the real market is only open for a limited time.

The US30 has been ranging since Monday as per the attached chart so for now you can trade that range until it breaks out one way or the other, it is only about 200 so not much above or below the open. The best entries are near the top and bottom of the range and protective trades are outside the range in case it breaks out which it will eventually do. Not this strategy, just saying it for those who tried the 50/100 rule and are suffering a little now!

Hello Larry,excellent point,I trade using Order Blocks and this is why i'm not seeing clear breakouts at times.There is so much money to be made in that range with LTF.This is why i'm not posting charts,its an advanced strategy I'm using,which is not related here.Market makers know at 9.30am the world is going to trade breakout on US30...,you think they will allow 1 billion traders taking 50 pips everyday ! no,no,no,no it don't work this way,they have the best surveillance cameras money could buy.....lol,not everyday this will work,this is why R2R has to be well contained within the range ,so one can survive this until price has a decision for direction,when I'm trading market structure is everything.Yesterday the sell stop entry posted here was actually buy price,believe it or not that's a stop hunt zone,you will always be taken out(unless you scalp a stop hunt),this is where most traders lose money,price reversed from April 7th lows,I'm not saying anything about the thread negative,but market structure means should be drawn accurately before identifying sell stops based on previous highs and lows of the day at least before 9.30am. Trading US30 and any other instrument is much more than just drawing 2 lines,waiting,using round numbers or psychological levels,this is only the tip of the iceberg.

Hello Robson,good morning to you as well,I can hopefully do a framework for the US30 and of course you can take it from there with the pending orders,your system is brilliant,from the post #1 i like it,but these market makers they to give us a hard time,when we go at them with force...I will post a chart,of course will not alter your method in no way,I appreciate your humble reply as always,thank you again.

--- 帖子 #733 ---
We can identify bearish and bullish engulfing candles,keep an eye out from those at major levels and monitor its purpose,with the breakout.You'll have either a retest and sell pressure which means the breakout will not last or a further break and run as you may call it retesting higher prices and we have profit,these 2 things can happen

--- 帖子 #734 ---
First of all, thanks for your attention.

1) What are enveloping candles?

2) These blue line levels?

3) This retest that you talk about the rupture, do you accompany it with a specific rupture candle? Sail M15, or M05, or M01 for example?

Grateful

--- 帖子 #735 ---
You're welcome, engulfing candles,you can refer to the following diagrams and they fall along the blue lines,this is where I expect a directional movement or reaction zone.Depends on where it appears within the structure

Due to copyright infringements i didn't want to publish the writing,it came from a book,but the basic structure are the candle's formation,found at the blue lines.

What does the acronym CS mean?

Low body CsA?

Are these candles at breakage?

--- 帖子 #737 ---
CS - candlestick,those black lines draw there are the level where price comes back for retesting then keep buying or invalidation (breaking low in case of bullish engulfing ,where it no longer respects a buy)

Low body candlestick A - means each candlestick has OHLC function - open,high,low,close

So, I'm a coder. I decided to code some statistics for this strategy.

Later I will post the numbers that I got from the best TP / SL / BE of 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020.

For example: TP and SL used in 2020 yield 700% profit, but the same settings for 2019 were negative.

That's because the market changes, hehehe.

Therefore, I am trying to find numbers that balance the profit between 2019 and 2020.

I will share more details as soon as I put these numbers together in a spreadsheet.

Obrigado.

--- 帖子 #746 ---
Thank you for your attention, friend.

Taking advantage of your goodwill, could you please make a statistic with the following configuration. Always starting from the principle of maximum and minimum from 16 hours (broker)

1) Place pending orders 8 pips above the maximum (BUY STOP) and 8 pips below the minimum (SELL STOP) from 16 hs broker.

2) STOP 20 pips

3) TP 10 pips

Note1) WITHOUT TRAILING STOP

Note 2) WITHOUT BREAKEVEN

Grateful for the attention Good weekend

--- 帖子 #747 ---
Something like this?

Broker time: 16hours

GAP (entry) = 8 pips

TP = 10 pips

SL = 20 pips

Hi forex1x8,

thanks for sharing your experience and thoughts here. I would like to pursue the approach further. My broker offers a trading time of 20 h and 15 minutes (not 16 hours). What does this mean for the strategy? I live in Germany (GMT). So should I determine the high and low of the day before starting US trading. And place an order 8 pip above and 8 pip below? So exactly as you describe or does anything change due to the longer trading time?

Thanks a lot

Putz, foi mal cara. Eu esqueci de mencionar isso no post.

Eu vou editar e adicionar os parâmetros que foram utilizados nos testes.

Mas basicamente foi assim:

2 ordens buy/sell stop (max/min do dia) na abertura da vela das 16hrs (broker time).

(Eu também coloquei uma expiração de 360 minutes (6horas), ela vai ser deletada caso a ordem pendente não seja ativada)

Capital: 1k

Risk: 1% do balance por trade

Na planilha voce pode ver os valores utilizados para TakeProfit / StopLoss / Breakeven.

Por exemplo:

Ano de 2020

Usando esses parâmetros:

Entendi parcialmente

Como pode um drawdown de $ 1.213 e 28.9 % se o stop é de 10 pips?

Acredito o que precisamos é ter um risco recompensa melhor. Vamos levar stop? claro que vamos. Não encontraremos um risco x recompensa perfeito.

Somente tenho que agradecer a sua boa vontade.

Se tiver um tempo, fazer um teste com os H4 do post 754.

Grato

Does anyone know why the metatrader shows MAX DD 15.00 (1.49%) ???

I thought it should be: MAX DD 10.00 (1%) !!!!

As you can see in the pictures, the initial capital was 1k, SL = 10 pips and the risk was 1% (lot size 1.0).

Anyone ?

--- 帖子 #758 ---
Now I understand it =)

1 - opened buy order at 28737

2 - price went up to 28742 (5 pips)

3 - price went down and hit SL at 28727 (10 pips)

NOW IT MAKES SENSE !!!!

Drawdown:

28742(max) - 28727(min) = 15 pips (15.00 : 1,49% DD)

Hi,

Very interesting concept to trade the US30. I see you only talk of pips? Below is a screenshot of the US30 chart for Friday. Please take me thru on taking trades/ placing buy and sell stops. As not one broker is the same.

Open - 33566

High - 33601

Low - 33481

Warm regards.

--- 帖子 #761 ---
At 1600 broker time, put a buy stop on the blue line witch is the high of the day till then. And sell stop the lowest red line, wich is the low of the day.

Set SL/TP.

I think now we have to find ways to improve R:R of the method. If we can improve R:R, this will be a great method to trade US30.

--- 帖子 #763 ---
I guess with that spreadsheet that i have shared few posts ago, it shows all kind of R:R..

you can download the file and open it with excel and see the numbers.

i will do some changes and run again the tests to compare with the previous results.

I know this is a bit of a thread hijack and slightly off topic but can your backtest program run with multiple symbols? I have a US30 open strat thats very simple and sort of hedges. At market open, Short 1 lot US30 and Long 8 lots US500 (these numbers equate to the same margin) and close both when account is $100 in profit, or $200 in loss. US500 generally outperforms US30 in both up and down markets so most nights it should end in positive equity, regardless of market direction. I have a bot that does this but won't backtest in cTrader when you try adding time into the equation...

--- 帖子 #780 ---
[quote = Mr4x86; 13492720] {quote} So che questo è un po 'un dirottamento del thread e leggermente fuori tema, ma il tuo programma di backtest può essere eseguito con più simboli? Ho una piattaforma aperta US30 che è molto semplice e sorta di siepi. All'apertura del mercato, Short 1 lotto US30 e Long 8 lotti US500 (questi numeri equivalgono allo stesso margine) e chiudono entrambi quando il conto ha un profitto di $ 100 o $ 200 in perdita. US500 generalmente sovraperforma US30 sia nei mercati al rialzo che al ribasso, quindi la maggior parte delle sere dovrebbe finire in azioni positive, indipendentemente dalla direzione del mercato.

I would like to take advantage of your goodwill and leave a test idea for you to do.

At 16:30 we have the cover of an M30 sail ok?

I would like you to take the following test.

At 16:30 (broker), place 2 pending orders 30 pips away from the opening price of this M30 candle. Today's Example 15/4 Opening price of the M30 candle at 16:30 was 33.906

BUY STOP 33.936

SELL STOP 33.876

Tests with 30 pips of STOP and 30 pips of TP (30/30)

Tests with 30 pips of STOP and 60 pips of TP (30/60)

A brotherly hug

friend, good morning. Every day I post my entries, everyone just needs to see the result and draw their conclusions. I told my life story here, saying that I have already lost a lot of money in the market .... do you think I will create a topic, where I don't earn anything, just to lie? I have Brazilian friends who follow the topic and some of them, I print every day of my profits. Here I suggest possibilities and friends can see that it works. See the collaboration of the friend TheZenienss. People want a ready-made system, where they go to the beach and when they come back, their accounts are in cash. What have you been doing? even seeing every day the price explode at the highs and lows, what have you been doing? ... you are worried about seeing my personal account. Try to follow what I have done and if you don't want to do it, ignore the topic, but don't be here fixing a problem, because the world already has too much problem. Let's make this topic a collective work, where we can all make a profit. Stay in peace

I've been testing US30 using a SSBO indicator (stairstep breakout box) gives me a ~ 75% win rate on US30 using buy/sell stop orders.

If forex1x8 allows, (not looking to hijack this fine thread) I can share it here with settings.

Friend thanks for your initiative. I don't know what the indicator is going to help.

The pending orders will have to be placed regardless of having a box, to show the maximum and minimum.

The method is practical and simple, but people have to place pending orders.

Having an indicator showing a box and if you don't place pending orders ... it won't do you any good.

What makes us win is not the indicator ... it is the orders pending that we put.

I will talk again about the subject that I wrote in # post 802.

Every day or the vast majority of days we have an explosion at the 16:30 candle (Broker) with the active US30. We have to explore this, as the market gives us few opportunities.

See what I said on #post 802 and see what happened yesterday and today and you can win every day with that idea.

As soon as the M30 candle opens at 16:30 (Braker) we have an opening price for that candle. Today was 33.958.

What's the idea?

The idea is to place 2 pending orders at a distance of 30 pips from the opening price. Today was: BUY STOP 33.988 SELL STOP 33.928

See that the price set BUY STOP and then came back ... but as the price always runs to one side ... we have already left the defense. I'm going to put today's result here.

I HAVE DONE THIS EVERY DAY.

This is just another suggestion that we can do with the US30 asset.

A hug to everyone.

--- 帖子 #822 ---
I thought your main entry was stop orders beyond the daily high and low upto 16:00 broker time.

You seem to have many different methods, all with different SL/TPs

--- 帖子 #823 ---
Friend See # post 818 Maximum and Minimum

See the result in # post 821.

I'm just showing one more possibility, in addition to the others.

You can win with all these possibilities.

See the H4 candles from (09 to 13) and the one from (13 to 17)

maximum and minimum of the H4 candle (09 to 13) Place pending order BUY STOP 5 pips above the maximum and SELL STOP 5 pips below the minimum.

maximum and minimum of the H4 candle (13 to 17) Place pending order BUY STOP 5 pips above the maximum and SELL STOP 5 pips below the minimum.

All these options, just place pending orders ...

Simple system that requires little work time.

The US30 asset is sensational.

A hug

It takes just 5 minutes a day to place pending orders.

--- 帖子 #837 ---
There are 2 methods I do:

1st method) Place 2 pending orders at 16:00 (Broker)

BUY STOP 10 pips away from the day's high (at 16:00)

SELL STOP 10 pips away from the daily low (at 16:00)

Easy ... very simple, because every day I have time, you can even put it on your cell phone. Watching the high and low at this time is very simple (It shouldn't be complicated to do an EA)

2nd method) Place 2 pending orders at a distance of 30 pips from the opening price of the M30 candle that opens at 16:30 (Broker). This method I am not able to do, because manually the price at this time is very fast, this method requires an EA ... (super profitable this method)

There would have to be an EA at 16:30 to place pending orders from the opening price of that candle that you just opened. It has to be very fast.

I will leave an illustrative image of the days 21-04 and 22-04.

--- 帖子 #838 ---
We can have a Stop loss of 30 pips or according to the operator's wishes.

But we may NOT HAVE STOP LOSS ...

What would we have?

we would have a coverage with a folded lot of the entrance that was not triggered. For example today.

Opening price of the M30 candle at 16:30 was 33.124

We would have

BUY STOP 33.154

SELL STOP 33.094

You triggered the SELL STOP in 33.094 and went to TP ... but if it wasn't for TP and you came back?

BUY STOP 33.154 with double lot (2x) would be activated and we could recover the 1st entry.

SELL STOP entry at 33.094 with a 0.01 lot with a financial TP of $ 3 dollars, if it turns ... 60 pips would return until it reached 33.154 ... then we would have an entry at 33.154 with a 0.02 lot with the same financial $ U 3 .... 33.154 was another 45 pips, would cover the loss of the SELL STOP entry and close at $ 3 profit.

Goal of the day 30 pips with 0.01 lot that are $$$ 03 dollars

Price opened at 16:30 at 33.782

We put a BUY STOP at 33.812 (30 pips above the opening price)

We put a SELL STOP at 33.752 (30 pips below the opening price)

Entry SELL STOP triggered with lot 0.01, arrived at TP (great) $$$ 03 dollars in the pocket

He didn't make it to TP and came back and took STOP at 33.812 for a loss of $ 6.

Activates the defense which is the BUY STOP entry at 33.812 with lot 0.02.

Price goes up and goes up to 33.857 + 45 pips with lot 0.02.

So a little while ago I mentioned I was testing an EA with an adaptation of this strategy. The entry rules are more or less the same, but the MM is different hence me not posting much about it. Anyway I decided to give this strategy using the EA a try on a free FTMO trial as the rules are pretty straight forward and match well for prop trading.

It's been 2 weeks so far and the results look promising. Now its just a case of getting the final small bugs out of the EA and then trying on an actual challenge account. I've also been trading it on a small live account for comparison and so far everything has matched up.

This is a pretty good EA strategy I think with some modifications to the pip distance, I wrote a quick and dirty EA to test it and it looks very good on backtesting!

Pip distance used here is 150, and target is $5 profits. Rest follows the strategy as you described, but all that could be parameters.

Account is 100% up in 4 months (backtesting) with little drawdown. 0.1 start lot used

You are not the first person to ask me this as I have received so many PM's asking about this same thing. As I told them I'll tell you the same thing, that is not me or my indicator. I'm not even a coder.

I've looked into that indicator long ago as I've seen it so many times and its actually a renamed indicator called Beast Super Signal. That indicator is found for sale in the commercial section I think so maybe its better to ask them to help you.

I see that some of the contributors have posted successful trades for yesterday with entry points higher than the low of the day at 16H00 (broker), whereas I placed my sell stop at a correct place that is below that low and price did not quite reach the TP of 50 pips before reversing and and SL eventually. Now I know that my sell stop price was a bit too conservative so I actually exited the trade when it was apparent that it had failed at BE plus a bit. I wasn't quick enough with my entry for the open price at 16H30 and that also lost when I entered at the required price a bit later but that was in fact a mistake I will not try that again.

Any comment from the guys who entered at prices above the low of the day?

RESPONSE TO FRIENDS OF #POSTS 908 AND 909.

The maximum and minimum system does not need EA (Experts), as it is very easy and we have a huge time to place pending orders.

We need an EA (Experts) only to use the defense that we can call REENTRATES.

The EA serves to recover the entries that did not form at the first moment for the TP.

The method 30 pips away from the opening price of the M30 candle at 16:30 .... this method needs an EA (experts) to place orders, because at that time it is very fast, and there is no time to place orders pending 30 pips away.

This EA that I am developing, can be used for the two methods that I have been talking about here, just change the settings and change the magic number.

NOT INTENDING TO SELL ANY EA (EXPERTS)

--- 帖子 #910 ---
The EA is needed to backtest the method and understand is it profitable on a long run.

Hey Mcmstar,

Yes you can i have tweaked the Values i use a little i wait for the EU open after the first 30min candle closes i set a buy stop 30 points above the high of the candle and put my SL just below the low of the candle.. also set a sell stop using the same values working on a 1:1 ATM but might go to a trial SL but i think 1:1 most days will be fine for me  the trade is normally finished pretty quick at London open... this was my trade last night see below

I like using the daily open as a stop because allot of times it will act as support or resistance.

Hey ApeyTan, i notice your doing Dax30 as well what perimeters are you using ?

--- 帖子 #940 ---
Performance so far in May using an EA  SL:50p TP:100p  9 wins 9 losses, but with 2:1 ratio account is up 35%

EA sets buy and sell stop orders at high / lows of the last 12h at 1530 server time.

Great results! Seems you have no spread and no commissions! What broker are you using with such a great conditions?

--- 帖子 #942 ---
GlobalPrime, spread is 1.50 pip, no commission on indicies, but there is overnight swap.

--- 帖子 #943 ---
Hi

At 15:30 server time, what time is it in Norway or New York?

I am trying to work out why you had a win yesterday (Wednesday) but my chart is showing a loss.

--- 帖子 #944 ---
1 loss 1 win..

--- 帖子 #945 ---
Broker time, not my vps time.

--- 帖子 #946 ---
I think that you people who are posting about the DAX trades should start your own thread, I think you are chasing away the thread starter who seems to have disappeared probably with his successful EA making him lots of green, or it has blown his account.

Good Morning I just watch.

You're right

I haven't posted much, but I have been trading a variation of this strategy successfully.

Like I mentioned before, I made some changes on the MM side of things, but mostly its still the same. I've also been using an EA as it works as a good tool to back test looking for the best settings.

Below is the results trading on a small live account after forward testing first on demo.

I have also shared an FTMO link to a free trial I passed again this week only trading with this strategy.

This strategy works and I thank forex1x8 for sharing it.

Its simple and profitable, what else do we need?

--- 帖子 #951 ---
Congratulations !!! This is what we need ... people committed to following.

It is no use staying here posting my results alone.

If I were to be alone, I would not create the topic.

Good weekend ,,, earning some money at FTMO, send it here to Brazil.

A hug

Looks great mrdfx. Can I ask were those results obtained using the EA?

Thanks, blam

--- 帖子 #953 ---
Hi, can I ask for the indicator that generates this statement ??? Alternatively, is there any chance you could share it or give it a name ??? Thank you very much in advance

--- 帖子 #954 ---
I am always interested to hear and see what you have to say.  Curios,can you share what you adjusted? Thanks

Hey mrdfx,

what parameters are you using atm ? to enter exit trades ?

--- 帖子 #957 ---
Hello, thank you very much for this indicator, I was looking for it for a long time and you helped me find it

--- 帖子 #958 ---
Can you share the MM rules so we can back and forward test this

--- 帖子 #959 ---
Hi

I also do not post much because I have been trying to find a way to make winning trades with this counter. I am not always in a position to be at my computer at the relevant times and the 16.30(9.30 NY) trade is very difficult without an EA to help handle the speed of placing trades necessary usually.

I have therefor been looking into the trades based on the highs and lows of the 4H candles, specifically those that finish at 13.00 which covers the London open, and the one that finishes at 17.00 which covers the NY open and also the next one finishing at 21.00 which includes more of NY.

I set buy and sell stops 22pips above and below the highs and lows (today first trades set are buy 34408 and sell 34285), stops are 100 no TP, I set trailing stop at 85 pips. I try not to interfere with the trades but if I get a good run early and quickly like when there is news or at the NY open then I may close manually with +100 pips profit. So far this is working out quite nicely because I am away from my computer soon after setting the first trade, the TS seems to be better than setting a TP, but more experience will tell in the long run how good it will be. If the first trade has triggered and not been closed when the next 4H candle has closed I just add the next trades. It is also quite possible to make profit from both buy and sell trades depending on the volatility that day.

I would also be glad to hear about your(MDFX) settings for your trades, ie at what times are your trading what are your parameters for entry TP and SL. I prefer to test forward on my real account with small risk.

--- 帖子 #960 ---
Im doing something similar to this strategy and took the essence of this strategy to enhance my one. Took the today entry manually and wanted to enter again. But felt its going to go opposite and I quit. Enough for the day. Attached results are from the demo test.

--- 帖子 #961 ---
So it seems there's been a lot of interest in my approach to this strategy. I'll share the details below.

Yes blam, I am trading making use of only the EA now. Initially I was doing it manually until the EA came along. Makes things easier especially when I'm not around my PC.

I see bojack has already shared a good one for you.

So initially what caught my attention to this strategy was the simplicity around it, it almost seemed too easy. Just set some pending orders and take profit voila.. Well sort of, but not quite.. I liked how it was a 1-2 trades max per day, in and out on the same day, no holding orders overnight strategy.

I did like the strategy, but not the MM, for me it was too static and the market is never static. Everyday is different and some days there's more or less volatility so some days the high/low box might be big or some days not much due to low volatility, so setting a fixed SL and TP didn't work for me, there had to be a better way so I thought about using the volatility as part of a tool to calculate the SL and TP. That's where I got the idea to use the high/low box itself as the SL and TP. If the high/low of the box was 20000 then I would set the SL and TP at 20000 using a 1:1 RR.

I didn't like the fact of using an inverted RR cos if the win rate is not high enough an inverted RR will not make a good profit long term, so 1:1 was the minimum. Now after testing using the full box for SL and TP it looked like that wasn't working either as it was hard to hit TP many times as the box was too big, so then I got the idea to use half box instead with a 1:1 RR so now if the total box high/low was 20000 then I'd set my SL and TP at 10000. As soon as I made this adjustment I started to see an improvement of the profitability. As the TP was smaller it got hit more frequently. The win rate was not very high, but due to the RR it made profit, not much, but just enough to keep working on it.

I then started experimenting on the pending orders distance, what was better 1000 points, 2000, 3000? After much testing using 1000 was the best overall compromise to get in early enough and still make a profit. Then came the risk tolerance. As I don't like risking much and US30 can be expensive I was experimenting with using only 1-2% per order. Using 1-2% I was getting less than 15% DD, with 1% less than 10% DD which for me is very good. Depending on your risk tolerance this can be scaled up or down I guess.

Now the final part of making this strategy a winner is using something called asymmetric compounding. Asymmetric compounding is a money management strategy where you add the profit from one trade to the next trade. For example, on the first trade we use a RR of 1:2, so we risk 1% to make 2%. If we win the first trade then we make 2% profit. Now on the next trade we will add the profit from the first trade so we will add the 2% profit we made to the original 1% we risking, so now on the next new trade we will be risking 3% to make 6%. If we win then we make 6% profit, and added to the first trades profit we made a total of 8% profit. On the next trade (3rd order) we will reset back to the original RR of 1:2. Now in the case that we lose any trade we simply reset to the original RR. The cycle will go for not more than 2 trades so we will add the profits for a max of 2 trades then it resets back to the original RR. Using asymmetric compounding we aim to capitalize on the wins and maximize the profits. Using this has greatly increased my profits trading this strategy.

Well I think I've covered most of it. I am still testing multiple scenarios trying to optimize the settings further and I will continue my forward testing. Like I said before its a simple strategy and with the right approach it can be very good.

--- 帖子 #965 ---
Good afternoon Friend I deal every day. It's no use posting my results alone. I already know that the method works.

I was wrong. I thought it was a very simple method, we would have more people interested. I cannot stay here in a monologue.

A hug and see my results today.

--- 帖子 #966 ---
Congratulations

--- 帖子 #967 ---
Hi Forex1x8 I have not replied before but have been reading all that you have been posting and thanks for all the work you have done and shared. Can I ask what system are you trading at the moment as I have got a little lost alone the way and lots of people are posting systems that look nothing like your first one can you help me.

Thanks Stormgirl122

--- 帖子 #968 ---
Good Morning Come on !!!

I didn't want to go back on that, but I have to talk.

At some point here on this topic I said that I already lost a lot of money in the Market, and I opened the topic to help people make a little profit.

I spoke here of very simple methods, but which generate profit with good financial management (risk x reward).

I thought people would be more interested, and with that I would be showing several ways to win together. It was a mistake on my part.

People did not follow what I was doing and started talking about other methods, this is very annoying. I ended up discouraging myself, because only I put the results every day, and even seeing my positive results every day, people didn't do it, (few friends published anything). I would just like to help people, so that we can win together. I will leave here the results of the week of my 5 real accounts. I don't only work with US30, but I didn't have time to show my ideas.

A brotherly hug to all.

--- 帖子 #970 ---
Forex 1x8, don't take it too hard. If you offered tomorrow's Wall Street Journal, some would turn it down. I trade the US 30, in and out, down and around, all day long. I see some interest on the forum in this asset and will try to get up to speed on what others are doing. Like stormgirl, I think I did get a little lost and just want to ask if you are still using the original parameters described in Post 1?

I'm not far into this one, but took a quick look at historical opportunities. From 12-21-2012 to date, I make it 2,173 trading days. There were 789 times price got 200 either above or below the open. So, we get triggered maybe a couple of times a week. So far so good? Appreciate being informed what I'm missing. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #971 ---
Good afternoon Thank you for your attention.

See what I wrote # post 802 and 823.

SPECIAL ATTENTION IN POST # 839.

Note: what I wrote in #post 01 was an introduction to the idea. The 02 methods of # post 839 is what we have to do.

GOOD WEEKEND

Probably this script might help you. But be aware of the lot size. Perhaps change it. Anyway you need to sit infront of the PC.

I had made a similar EA for my strategy that can do this. Has anyone already made one or shall i attach it here?

--- 帖子 #976 ---
Hi Forex 1x8 Many thanks for sharing your system, what SL are you using on post 839 ? are you using method in post 840? or are you trying different methods, i was thinking maybe brake even at 20pips with 30pip stop, and trade both sides, cheers Montego.

--- 帖子 #977 ---
This is the recipe to total loss. If a strategy requires Martingale should think of increasing SL so you are not stopped out so early. What about keeping sl at low high of 16:00 candle?

--- 帖子 #978 ---
It is a very simple strategy. I recognized the hedging orders used for US30 as part of another strategy that uses hedges orders to ensure profit rather than a SL

After reading the entire thread and applying the method you have shared, I have to say that you deserve recognition for everything you have done.

Not only have you explained how, with hardly any indicators of any kind, to easily trade an index no less, but you have also been showing your own trades (before and after) in a totally transparent way.

That says a lot about you.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #984 ---
Good afternoon

IntheDark Thanks

Friday and today results.

--- 帖子 #985 ---
I am attaching my EA.

It has all settings needed included such as how many pips lower or higher than current price, sl, tp, trailing sl, lpt size, single trade or multiple entries etc. I made this EA to open a trade on break of high or low during a given period of time set by user. We can use it to open trades at 16:00. If any change needed let me know. I have many such useful EAs which i will give away free as soon as i start my thread as i am new here still that option is unavailable.

--- 帖子 #986 ---
Are you using 100 pip sl and tp? Did you change sl and tp from 50 pips?

--- 帖子 #987 ---
Trading at 16:00 or 16:30 which one is best?

--- 帖子 #988 ---
Thank you forex1x8 for your strategy. Over 9 years of trading what i have learned is that Indices are where i have been able to make money. I trade USTEC and US500 successfully and now because of you US30 is going to be another addition.

--- 帖子 #989 ---
16:30 Open NY

--- 帖子 #990 ---
thanks trader3690, can you suggest which settings to use to autotrade the US30 system as described by forex1x8 on this thread?

thanks, blam

--- 帖子 #991 ---
Good EA Thanks ! only Faults i can find is will only trade one lot on my account wont trade 0.01 cheers

--- 帖子 #992 ---
That's weird, since that EA allows you to adjust the lots.

Are you sure it's not due to your broker?

Many (like ICM) only allow indices to be traded from a minimum of 1 lot.

--- 帖子 #993 ---
Thanks thats interesting, I Didn't know that, maybe its a problem at my end then  Tried all the settings and would not trade on 0.1 or 0.01 weird!

--- 帖子 #994 ---
That would be very helpful

--- 帖子 #995 ---
What a generous idea. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #996 ---
What is the broker Specification for the Index you are trying to trade?

In case you don't know how to find that, in the Market Watch list, right-click on the Index of interest,

in the pop-up window, click on Specification, tell us what it says for Contract Size

--- 帖子 #997 ---
Ok thanks.

--- 帖子 #998 ---
That is maybe with the broker? lots can be set any value on ea though.

--- 帖子 #999 ---
Hi Erebus it says 1

--- 帖子 #1000 ---
So, have you figured out why you can't trade 0.01 or 0.10 yet?

not broker weird, not EA weird

--- 帖子 #1001 ---
Obviously ! 1 means 1 Lot , im not An idiot, But i still find it weird as its just a normal Xm account ...

--- 帖子 #1002 ---
Try take manual 0.01 trade if you do not see Buy or Sell buttons it means xm not allow 0.01

--- 帖子 #1003 ---
Another of my collections. This indicator will help you draw a vertical line at 16:30 to easily mark time. there are 3 options you can select same time for all or different times. i hope it is helpful.

--- 帖子 #1004 ---
Thanks Bud

--- 帖子 #1005 ---
Well i have not started using it for this strategy yet but i am planning doing so asap.  The ea was actually made to trade break of high or low between your selected times. My coder is on vacation if someone can adjust the code so we can just select one candle time of 16:30 i will give the mq4 file.  Rest inputs are all ok. There is option to enter trade at given pips from start of candle too.

--- 帖子 #1006 ---
trying to make it simple

--- 帖子 #1007 ---
No your not an idiot but you learned something new today

Just buy or sell one lot, that's normal

otherwise, find another broker that runs to your rules

good luck

--- 帖子 #1008 ---
Good afternoon Today's results.

NOTE: just friends look at the explosion that we have 85% of the time at 16:30.

--- 帖子 #1009 ---
Hi

You are absolutely correct, but we need your EA to place pending orders on open of the 16:30 candle. it is impossible to do it manually due to explosive movements at that particular time.

Thank you

I suppose that is GMT3, as is the most common broker's timezone.

Likewise, just add 30 minutes to New York opening time.

Hi Forex 1x8, Thanks for sharing, I noticed you have 1 loss and 3 winners, ive read the whole thread, and i still dont quite understand how your trading this, are you trading this as mentioned with no stop loss and double the lot on reverse ? also is it with EA or manual ? and is this the 16:00 10 pip strategy or the the 16:00 30 pip Strategy, kind regards.

--- 帖子 #1020 ---
Hey Forex1x8

Really love this way of trading. No indicators, fantastic ! When you say ' lets work' i am ready and excited to check my numbers to make sure they coincide with yours.

Please don't stop posting as it really does help.

Thank you from Sydney, Australia

--- 帖子 #1021 ---
Bro, ignore the nay sayers, can you continue to provide your trades daily so we can track them as it was great to learn and follow-up.

Are you now using an EA to place the trades at Day-Open and the trades at 16:30?

--- 帖子 #1022 ---
What parameters should we put in Expert advisor Esike? I use the parameters in which it is configured. 250, 150, 25.

--- 帖子 #1023 ---
Thank you very much for providing such a detailed description of the process of how you came up with the approach; including RR, asymmetric compounding, etc.

Do you still intend to share your EA?

If so, I would love to run a variety of tests (different time frames, forward test, TP/SL, other indexes) and report back.

--- 帖子 #1024 ---
I'm a very avid US30 trader, and I noticed your +30 pip Buy/Stop method was pretty active, can you do one more post listing all of your everyday trading ideas? I read that one and the 4Hr one but couldn't understand it clearly with all the scrolling through 50+ pages? I tried to PM but I jut created this account just to interact with you haha thanks anyways.

I'm also trying to use the 9/20 EMA method but any indicators/methods you mind sharing would be great too, I'm like 1 year+ into trading and trying to perfect my craft while working at a bank

--- 帖子 #1025 ---
Okay, tried following all the statements, just making sure....

30 Min TF = Buy/Sell Stops at +/- 30 pips from Opening Price of 9:30 candle (EST)

4 Hour TF = Buy/Sell Stops at +/- 10 pips from High and Low of 9:00 candle (EST)

What are your trailing SL and TP for each method? Thanks as always for putting time in to share, what seems like a profitable strategy!

Blessings,

--- 帖子 #1026 ---
Good Morning

The H4 method is also very simple.

Closing of candle H4 from 13 to 17.

Buy stop 10 pips away above the high.

Sell stop 10 pips below low.

50 pips from STOP LOSS

50 pips of TP

--- 帖子 #1027 ---
Thanks so much for the clarification! I'm assuming by "13 to 17" you referring to the candle before the 9:00 (EST), just a different time zone since you're in Brazil!

If so, I'll backtest and follow up! Does this method work with any other indices?

Thanks again!!

--- 帖子 #1028 ---
The EA is not completed yet as there's still a few bugs that need fixing, but I did speak to the developer of the EA and he has said he's not very keen on sharing the EA publicly. I don't want to push it, but I'll speak to him again when the EA is finished and see if he changes his mind. If he agrees I'll share it no problem.

--- 帖子 #1029 ---
Well as I promised EA for this strategy is almost ready. Testing now and will upload soon

--- 帖子 #1030 ---
Bro, is there already EA on this or no? apart from one i gave earlier as i made new one on it.

Hi, "Trader3690.

I downloaded your first EA, but it does not trade on my platform? I have tested many EAs and have done everything I know to get it to work, without any success. I therefore not only ask you for assistance with present one, but also to let me know what changes you made to the first version, please?

Continued success to you though.

First Trade with New Ea. Placed pending orders...Leverage 1:100

--- 帖子 #1034 ---
After this new one you don't need first one. ATTACHNG IMAGE OF INPUTS I MADE.

This is different will take trade at your chosen time. 16:30 I included 3 different times like if someone want trade at 16:00 too.

Keeping all times same will trade once that time.

You can choose 3 different times of the day.

Included Martingale in opposite direction too.

--- 帖子 #1035 ---
Good Morning

The configuration is wrong.

You put Stop Loss of only 3 pips .... the original idea is a stop loss of 30 pips.

See the result, it was a victory with +30 pips

--- 帖子 #1036 ---
Very interesting! Let me know what's needed for access when available!

Blessings,

--- 帖子 #1037 ---
No i used 50 pip sl 50 pip Tp as strategy says?

--- 帖子 #1038 ---
All inputs you can choose your own no problem... i will leave it open

--- 帖子 #1039 ---
The image you posted in post 1035 is clear.

You took a stop of just 5 pips.

sell entry at 34,601 and took the stop at 34,607 + spread. You have to add one more digit to get 50 pips stop.

it has to be

stop 5000 (50 pips)

Tp 5000 (50 pips)

--- 帖子 #1040 ---
Did you also go long at around 34630?

--- 帖子 #1041 ---
There are 02 methods

method 01) is the maximum and minimum that I stipulated in the EA from (1:00 to 16:20)

method 02) is orders placed 30 pips away from the opening price of the 16:30 M30 candle

My pending orders for method 01 today were:

BUY STOP 34.642 (triggered and open)

SELL STOP 34.554 (cancelled)

My method 02 pending orders today were:

BUY STOP 34.660 (canceled)

SELL STOP 34.600 (win post 1037)

We can still talk about a 03 method which is the high and low of candle H4 from 13:00 as 17:00, today's orders were:

BUY STOP 34,643 (triggered and opened)

SELL STOP 34.554 (cancelled)

--- 帖子 #1042 ---
Thats perfect. Thank you for the clarification

--- 帖子 #1043 ---
surely will do.

Blessings for you too.

--- 帖子 #1044 ---
Oh ok. 500 looked small yes. So 5000. Ok. Haven't tested with that. it is another 0 added so will test that. thanks.

--- 帖子 #1045 ---
Different brokers have different digits so that is ok i get it now. thanks.

--- 帖子 #1046 ---
By the way for method 1 the first EA should work.

--- 帖子 #1047 ---
where can i download your EA?

--- 帖子 #1048 ---
In any of the methods (or in both) when one pending order triggers, do you cancel the other one?

Or only in some situations?

Regards.

--- 帖子 #1049 ---
Friend, the EA has an option to cancel or leave the other pending order active.

The EA I have is not currently available.

The EA I have can place pending orders in the 3 methods I've already talked about here, just change the times:

method 1) put the time from 01:00 to 16:20.

method 2) place hours from 16:30 to 16:30.

method 3) set time from 13:00 to 17:00

--- 帖子 #1050 ---
Ok i tested with 50 pips that gives lot of losses without reverse trade. 5 pip gives good results.

1st week of june, 10 Losses, 5 wins, that is 33% win rate

I'm using a 1:2 RR, so I only need 37,5% to be profitable, however there was alot of sideway action this week so june is currently at a slight loss.

Hoping for a better week next week

Ok. EA is ready. I am giving inputs that you can change too. To take trade at 16:30 make all times same as default. This ea you can use for any time.

--- 帖子 #1065 ---
Hello, the expert only works for me, if I put the gap less than a thousand, but it does not open any operation in the strategy tester, the same thing happens to someone else, thanks

--- 帖子 #1066 ---
Good Morning

method 1)  maximum and minimum of the day + 50 pips

method 2)  open price candle M30 from 16:30 with pending orders at 30 pips far, now 60 pips TP. + 60 pips

green pips

--- 帖子 #1067 ---
Good afternoon,

I followed the instructions to the "T" as per "Trader

3690's" screenshot and the trade was taken correctly - see the attached screenshots from M30 down to M-1 to illustrate what happened as the trade was stopped out and yet when you look at M-1 pictures, there was no indication that that was the reason. The trade hit TP for 7 pts only which is rather sad.

US30 requires one decimal point so if the stop is 50 it will be 500 in the EA and likewise for TP.

I reduced the slippage as that figure defaulted could cause a major calamity.

Kindly assist me in setting it up correctly.

Lastly, if I want it to trade 16h30 and 17h30 when Chicago opens, what should I do with the 3rd time setting? I set it to 00:00 is that correct, please?

Continued success to everyone.
Hercs.

===It is because of the simplicity that I could easily spot the problem(s) with the EA.

I still think this is a great strategy especially using the H4 approach for me.

The EA just makes it so much easier; no offense intended.

Continued success to you.

--- 帖子 #1072 ---
Thanks. The EA uses market orders, I thought it used pending orders.

--- 帖子 #1073 ---
Hi trader3690, thank you for sharing your EA. Can you modify the EA, so that it opens more orders?

The EA only opened two orders and that's it, it should have opened a third order. There is no way to limit the number of orders the EA can open.

--- 帖子 #1074 ---
Thank you

I took the trade manually, I calculated +/- 30 pips from the open candle at 16H30 it is all. place sl at  60 pips target around 50 pips...

On the chart (30 min TF ) you can use the grid ( spaced around 25 pips for the TF 30 min. ) to put your sell stop or buy stop it is more easy!!!!

after that you adjust your stop... I used ' modify or delete order' and I definied level at 50 pips, it is all I did

Sorry for my english..it is not ma native language

have a nice day

--- 帖子 #1075 ---
Mine also worked properly today after adjusting the settings, but the entry does not correspond with my entry levels I drew half an hour earlier. Therefore I would also like to know how the entries are calculated, please.

The Yellow horizontal line is my Hi and the Aqua one is the entry-line which is +10 pips of the high. Any suggestions please?

My manual trade worked perfectly.

It banked 50 pips as you can see.

The coder is not responding to any of my contact attempts although I see that he is on other websites as well.

Wonderful

--- 帖子 #1078 ---
thank you....

look the picture for the peoples are visuel not intellectuel...

3 trades and the rest was more trade with recuperation strategy...

hope is more clear for the gang....for me I used the grid to evaluate the points entry's ( sell stop and buy stop...+/- 30 approximatively)

same thing for to place de target and take profit...no need and EA but for the peoples won that.... it is ok for me

Don't forget the 72 rule: 72/ % /day = nb of days you need to multiply by 2 your account ex.: 72 / 4.33= 17 days...17 days later you have the double of your account... after you raise the lot size and go for another 17 days....

good reflexion

I have back tested and found similar results. Random at best. In my opinion, this basic form of trading is not very sophisticated, yet is pitched as a "revelation" in Dow trading. Look, I've been trading the markets for over 30+ years. If it were that simple, then everyone would be doing it, right? Trading is a game of probabilities and sets of trades based off a static plan that is repeatable. I stumbled across Trader Tom's site (basic and disjointed) and his YouTube stream where he trades equity market CFDs. Again, in my opinion, I find his trading style that of a degenerate junkie gambler. Not very sophisticated and certainly one might be lead to destroy their account if they follow his trades.

Newbies need a more streamlined and risk adverse approach. If your a sophisticated "scalper" then his style might work for you. But then again maybe not. That might be the main reason why everything he provides is "free". I think my mom told me a long time ago, nothing in life is free. So, trade what you know and see. Have a tight and risk adverse trading plan, and block and tackle your way to profits. If we can all make Millions in a few weeks, I don't think we would be in this community trying to learn from each other.

Peace out...

It is quite smart, because when your ADR is beyond 2/3 it is unlikely to reverse if the road is free. I usually trade the opposite logic, when I am late (I trade a lot of reversals) but a retracement from above 2/3 of the ADR is a gift from the gods to ride the ongoing momentum that should not be ignored.

THE STOP LOSS IN THE 2 SITUATIONS ARE THE ENTRY POINT OF THE OPPOSITE TRADE

TAKE

PROFIT DEPEND YOU BUT ALWAYS AROUND 30 PIPS OT MORE...

IF THE MARKET TAKE MY BUY STOP...I ADD ANOTHER SELL STOP WITH YHE SAME LOT SIZE. IF THE MARKET RUN AGAINST ME...i CLOSE THE BUY WHEN THE SELL STOP IS IN ...

2 OPTIONS ...IF THE MARKET CONTINU, WHEN I RECUPARE MY LOSS...I CAN CLOSE ALL ( NO LOSS AND NO GAIN) OR I TAKE THE RISK TO GO OUT WITH A LITTLE GAIN.

Nice work JP. A quick question, if i may, you are basing entries on the 16.30 candle, and that's 16.30 with your broker. What is the actual time for that candle? ie you are in Brazil, so what is the local time of the 16.30 candle. I am on London time (BST).

--- 帖子 #1166 ---
Hi guys,

I wrote an EA to test the strategy but honestly I don't understand how you can get such good results.

Either with the "recovery" option active, or without it, the EA is losing.

Attached you can see the result with recovery (99.9% backtest data quality), this is with US500 but results are similar with US30 or USATEC.

I guess if I'm using the recovery in the wrong way.

At us market open time (which is 16.30 here in Italy) I place 2 pending orders, 30 pips away from current market price.

SL = 60, TP = 60 but I use trailing because most of the times price bounces back, so the TP is hit only a few times.

With this configuration, correct me if I'm doing it wrong, the entry price of one order is the SL of the other one.

When one of the 2 pending orders is activated, I add another pending order on the opposite direction. If everything goes ok, that's it.

If prices come back against me, when SL is hit the 2 pending orders on the opposite direction are activated.

The problem is when the price comes back again and the SL of the 2 is hit.

With just 2 back cases you destroy days of small gains.

Please tell me if my thought is correct or if I need to fix something

--- 帖子 #1167 ---
Try tp30 sl60

--- 帖子 #1168 ---
it doesn't change much.

In my humble opinion this strategy is like flipping a coin, backtesting I don't see any statistical proof that at US open time the price will move with a strong movement in one direction.

The only advantage is given by the "recovery" option.

But still, also that one is not working so good, as it is explained. So unless people here are using a different strategy, or I don't know how they can get such good results with the recovery explained some pages back.

I tried with a slightly different approach:

as soon as one of the pending orders are hit, I delete the other one, and I place one pending order (with double the size) at the daily open price. So when the price goes against me and goes back to daily open price, I close current order and open an opposite one with double the size.

The result is attached.

Not too bad but still there's a lot of work to do..

--- 帖子 #1169 ---
Totally wrong trading time. 16.30 is broker time, not Italy time. After US market open, wait for 1.5 hours later, and you may set the pending buy and sell stop order.

--- 帖子 #1170 ---
Neanche troppo male ..

--- 帖子 #1171 ---
not sure about it. my broker time is equal to my local time. anyway, it doesn't matter, I tested the EA with all the times combinations

I don't know why people who are using the strategy don't respond to this thread, so I did some tests on my own and I attach the result from 2017 to today.

Still not perfect, I will put this on a demo account and see what happens in the following weeks.

@lorecavoli: non male, ma molto migliorabile a mio parere

--- 帖子 #1172 ---

Trade at the opening time of 16.30 broker time. You may read post #839 and #840 for more info. Just curious if there is another way for TP and SL. Need to optimize the risk reward for better result maybe..

to me it works well with a TP 90 and an SL 30 and BE+30 when the price reaches 60. using martingala x2

Now I am also testing with a TP 250 and an SL 50 with BE +25 when the price reaches 100. using martingala x2

Could someone test these two options?

happy new year everyone,

clipi i backtested something similar to this and it wasn't profitable because  the 3 x martingale was contributing to losing profit then account turn negative.  my best testing results came when tp 30 and sl 60 but only using the strategy once or twice a week.  using this method 5 days a week always end up unprofitable.

--- 帖子 #1185 ---
I coded and tested so many EAs during the years, but I've never seen one profitable using martingale.

It blows up the account, sooner or later. It could be fine even for some years, but sooner or later...

anyway I'm coding the 2 methods explained in post 839 - 840, will post some results as soon as they are ready.

@ironshirow: TP 40, SL 30, and move to BE at 20 pips profit.

I don't want to look rude, but this strategy is not profitable. The results are attached (from 2015 to 2022).

So either you are using a variation of it, with some secret parameters, or that's not really profitable in the long run

That martingale is really risky!!

--- 帖子 #1188 ---
yeah i also got similar results of it being unprofitable, especially with martingale.  the only way to make it some what profitable is to trade it once or twice a week, but the one or two days of the week varies based on the chart.

yes sure there are many ways, but if we are here to discuss strategies, and people post pictures and results without sharing the details of the strategy, I don't see the point of partecipating to a discussion, no offense

do you have a myfxbook page for this strategy?

or any kind of report?

just posting random pictures without any explanation it's not so useful...

--- 帖子 #1232 ---
Posting random stuff on internet forums is very useful for posters. It is called ego masturbation, it makes people to feel good.

--- 帖子 #1233 ---
ah yes, sure!!

I just asked because some posts back I asked some questions about the strategy, he just claimed they have a secret telegram group, but if that's so secret what's the point of writing here without any info?

I created the EA with the rules written in posts 839 - 840, and it's not profitable.

I performed many backtesting with different variations, on many indices and crosses, but no luck (as usual with martingale systems).

So I'm wondering what's the strategy used now by TheZenienss and if that could be profitable in the long term.

Without any info, only random pictures, what's the value of this thread?

--- 帖子 #1234 ---
TheZenienss is running an EA from Thiago and his telegram group is @ThiagoEA and is run by Thiago Hottz.

Don't be lazy! It's all been shared here!!!!

I even posted several results of backtests, optimizations and other strategies!!!!!

The group on telegram is not secret, I replied to everyone who contacted me by PM.

I didn't post the link publicly because I respect the author of this thread.

--- 帖子 #1238 ---
yes I read every single post, and it's really confusing. Because you used a lot of different variations of the 2/3 strategies, backtests with different parameters for different years. This is not the way to go to implement and optimize an expert advisor. Infact I've not seen a single backtest report valid and winning for 5-6 years!

Also in the telegram group, no backtest or myfxbook at all.

This looks a lot like a commercial post for the Thiago EA, without any evidence of the real results in the long run.

hey guys great work, but i have a couple of question:

1.  what page is the thiago ea open price party on and what are the settings because i went back the last 30 pages and use search the thread and couldn’t find it.

2.  are you only activating the buy side or the sell side or canceling one side when the other side is activated because most days both side are activated and using the recovery(martingale) will cause big losses.

3.  can you only post charts in one post or only post the us30 like forex1x8(robson) the original poster thread starter suggested.

4.  if you go back a couple of pages some chart days are missing and some of those days both sides were activated along with both recoveries(martingale).

5.  here are some of the examples of charts of the question i asked.  i  only had time to post for us30 and ym(us30 futures) but the same thing applies to ustec and us500

good luck in getting an answer!!

I spent hours coding and testing an EA which is doing what explained back in the thread. It's a losing strategy, no matter what index you use it on, especially with the martingale.

The strategy as described doesn't work, and there are no clear instructions.

As you say in your question, only winning trades are posted, and each day different indices/results, there is no statistic nor history for the "strategy".

So, don't expect much from this thread, it's likely a commercial thread for this Thiago EA (whose statistics don't exists either).

hey guys, how would you have traded last thursday and friday(big news day jobs report) when:

1.buy side and sell side activated

2.buy side recovery activated(martingale) and sell side recovery activated(martingale)

here are the example charts for us30 and us500

how many times do you martingale before you say the trade is unprofitable and you take the loss.  on my original backtest i stopped at three martingale.

You have no reason to explain correct, you can keep everything secret, but so this thread is useless.

what's the benefit for the community?

If I start a thread posting random pictures, do you think it would be of any help to the community?

--- 帖子 #1282 ---
agree somewhat. I (briefly) joined the telegram channel and found it to be a bit opaque and unfriendly. Nothing super concrete due to the brief period of time, and I stand to be corrected, but a 'vibe' based on a few things which I'll not detail in this post.

Another user privately messaged me to say that the EA that Zenienss uses in the screenshots, he's used it himself and found that it's not very good or consistent

here are my demos on US30. i am trying to learn how to trade 4 indexes: DE30, UT100, US30 and India50. having a crazy number of mt4s set. what happens is i take a good care of each one of them, by daily adjusting and twisting their individual settings until no more changes are necessary. phase 2 is to combine different successful set ups, as they are individually successful into different times and conditions. and when mixing all 4 indexes at the same time? something extraordinary happens...

this is just US30. the same way me is trading DE30 and UT100 in this particular example. again. on a demo, as i am trying to learn how to trade these. maybe next week, i will trade them live for a first time in my life... highly likely.

--- 帖子 #1413 ---
#1 Indicator is my brain,it has never failed me since the early 70s . Of course there are many indicators one can use it depends on each trader's style,but my greatest accuracy is naked price action,this will not fail you in the quest for profit.US30 opening price as Robson illustrated is the way to trade the system,with some twists and turns using variation in methods.Low spread,slippage and little or no manipulation...which is hard to find,large capital ICMarkets,another option Tickmill,depends on where you live,there are restrictions.Robson suggests Valutrades,there also have some good reviews.

--- 帖子 #1414 ---

Bearing in mind we're still in the middle of a pandemic, and on the cusp of ww3 with potential nuclear warfare, it is well over 2000 pips up from when war broke out. I wouldn't have thought plowing all this money into indices/stocks was the normal or sensible thing to do and yet it just keeps going up. Gold is another strange one in the current circumstances.

Are you losing money while US30 plough its way 2000 pips upwards? This is the million dollar question ,look at currencies eg: ''EURUSD'' the war is approx 23 days old,what was EURUSD ADR before that?

--- 帖子 #1419 ---
....so US30 should keep going up after 2000 pips up and all timeframes oversold...I mean I know indis lags but I just don't know your strategy and I'm new to the US30....thanks in advance...

I scalp US30 its a beast,more vicious than gold with its monster ADR reputation, not here to stay long term trading this instrument,also trade breakouts when necessary with naked trading no indicators,but I appreciate when traders have a combination of both....hedging is very important if you know the market structure well,that by itself is a different skill.

--- 帖子 #1428 ---
....Thanks for your response...Well I also scalp for a few pips the markets and chose the US30 for his volatility (Monster or Beast as you called him) but like to look at longer time frames for a broad view of the market....I use 3 different time frames 1M, 5M and 15M when the are all in sync one way or the other I take a risk with a hard stop then when in profits I move the stop to lock in profits and let it run or take a few pips as the markets recommend ...I try to do the money the old fashion way...I earn it lol...thanks for your responses good luck and god speed..on this workshop are the longer time frames but with the same lagging indis I use 1,5 and 15M charts...would love to learn naked trading but just don't know how....thanks for letting me butt in here...no disrespect to naked trading or anything.. I rest my case now...

Hi everybody

I'd like to find an MT4 indicator whith open price and open range. Do you have it or if someone can create this ?

You can look on graph that the price react on the Line  (Time Frame M1).

1- On/Off open price at hh:mm with line parameters = for example 15h30 on graph (white line)

2- On/Off Delay of open range in hh:mm with rectangle and line parameters = for example first 15 minutes on graph (Violet rectangle and green/red line)

3- On/Off first minute on graph (red rectangle)

4- On/Off extended line of OPR with % parameters 4 below OPR and 4 above = +-100 +-200 +-300 +-400 on graph (white lines)

Thanks a lot

Hi Rtgs2

Was your trading according post #1 ?

--- 帖子 #1461 ---
Hello guys,

I know this system and have been using it for a few years, but with some ups and downs. We can effectively have many consecutive wins. Several days (or weeks) without losses. The problem is when a loss occurs that can eat up a lot of those profits. Losses can be big, as it is not easy to have a balanced/correct stop loss strategy on such a strong asset and with such sudden movements at the opening of NY.

If you have any useful tips for TP and SL setup, please let me know.

@forex1x8 i'm from Portugal. We speak the same language. Can we talk in private?

Hello Guys

Please can we have new analysis on US30?

--- 帖子 #1471 ---
Shall we continue analyzing

--- 帖子 #1472 ---
I know im late to this, but I have done some basic quantitative analysis on the US30. Ill share the results, im sure this will be useful for those who are developing/trading this strategy. I know i find it useful.

This is for the daily timeframe. Measuring candle size as high to low
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Again daily timeframe. Measuring candle size as open to close.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

.... What would the probability be of price reaching x times the ADR?

Also, if the previous high/low is broken, we have a 70% chance of the current close closing higher/lower than the previous close. This patterns has the highest percentages on the stock indices. Which may seem obvious, but i figured ill put it out there. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

New day new chances! I have managed to get the probabilities of the daily us30 candles being bigger than x times ATR(14).

Measured high to low.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Measured open to close.

I think I've showed clearly where (one of the) edge is, I'm about to explore some risk management and entry options. I'd hope to see some ideas or discussion about how we can expose the gold that was found by OP.

Thanks for sharing that idea with us, I've tested this pattern.

There is some raw edge in this too! Pure gold. And it isn't a little bit. Maybe you could start a thread were we can explore this idea further, as I'm still too young to start my own.
