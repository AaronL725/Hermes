TCO TRADER EA

Hi Guys/Gals,

I have decided to start my own thread for my EA,   I simplified the EA name - TCO Trader

It is based on a couple of 100PipsADay strategies and also Ichimoku and Turtle. Basically it determines the daily trend using 4 different methods (select 1-4) and then uses the Williams% or Stochastic to enter trades on the lower TF.

2 of the Trend Methods by 100PipsADay - He and others are doing very well with it on FF.

100PipsADay 20/50 EMA Method - http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=425041

100PipsADay Third Screen MACD Method - http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=382032

First I want to say I'm very thankful to 100PipsADay and everyone else on the D1 20 EMA & 50 EMA thread. This EA was designed from the strategies on 100PipsADay's thread - D1 20 EMA & 50 EMA.  I'm very excited about these strategies and think they have long-term viability for us. I would like to give back to this community by making my EA available.  My EA is available, for free, I just ask that no one try to sell it on EBAY.  I hope we can work out any bugs and add more features as we go.

TCO Trader EA – Features

The EA will let you select up to 4 different trend methods for a higher time frame - the default with be daily = 1440

Higher TF Trend Modes - can be set to whatever Higher TF you desire, the EA is now designed to work with 1-4 methods so if you can enter up to 4 different methods for the Trend Mode.  All methods selected must be true to determine the overall trend.
Ichimoku - Tenkan Sen/Kijun Sen cross, with a Kijun Sen trailing stop loss feature.
20/50 MA  –  100PipsADay's basic strategy - Now can use other MA methods
Adjustable MACD Trend above/below zero – based on Third Screen MACD strategy - now can use MACD Adjustable, MACD Hanover, MACD Traditional Turtle Channel
Lower TF Trade Entry - can be set to whatever TF you desire.  You can select the Williams % method or Stochastic method for lower TF signals

Williams % entry - also can set true/false for confirmation, which means for a buy trade, the Williams % would go under -80 level and then have to go above
-80 level for a buy trade to be placed. If this is toggled off, the buy trade would be triggered as soon as it goes below the -80 level. For a sell trade, if the confirmation is set to true, the Williams % would go above -20 level and then below -20 level for the sell trade to be triggered. If the confirmation is set to false, it just has to be above the -20 level to trigger the sell trade

Stochastic entry - also can set true/false for confirmation, which means for a buy trade, the Stochastic would go under 20 level and then have to go above
20 level for a buy trade to be placed. If this is toggled off, the buy trade would be triggered as soon as it goes below the 20 level. For a sell trade, if the confirmation is set to true, the Stochastic would go above 80 level and then below 80 level for the sell trade to be triggered. If the confirmation is set to false, it just has to be above the 80 level to trigger the sell trade

Additional Trade Management FeaturesClose All Open Trades On Opposite Signal - can be turned on or off
Time Delay can be set - Lower TF bars delay between open orders (thanks to turtlefan) for this logic. Time Delay from closed order can be set - Lower TF bars delay from closed orders. MaxOrdersPerPair - limit your risk by setting max allowed trades that can be opened per pair.
Standard TP and SL
Trailing SL
Jumping SL
Breakeven SL
ATR based TP
ATR based SL
Fixed or dynamic lot sizes (based on Risk%) Lot sizing based on lot size per $1000 of account equity. Global Trade Profit Target based on percentage of account balance, will close all trades (the entire basket for all pairs) - thanks to turtlefan for this. Global Trade Loss Target based on percentage of account balance, will close all trades (the entire basket for all pairs) - thanks to turtlefan for this. Trader controlled trend determination.  You will be able to override the higher TF trend determination and just tell the EA if you only want it to GoLong or GoShort and the EA will enter the trade when a signal is determined by the Williams% on the lower TF but only in the direction the trader specifies.  Then the EA will manage the trades using the EA's trade management features.    EA can trade per last closed lower TF bar (bar mode), or on current lower TF bar (tick mode). Spread limit check Margin Safety check Pip Step option This EA will open the trade first and then modify the trade with the take profit and stop loss, so it should work with ECN brokers.

The EA was designed to work on a nano account - 1 pip equals $ 0.01 cent.  So those testing on micro, mini and standard accounts please verify your lot sizing is working correctly if you use dynamic lot sizing.

The EA is designed to work on the lower time frame chart.  So if you use the daily time frame for your trend determination and the hourly time frame for the Williams% entry signal, the EA must be applied to the hourly chart.  The indicators in the attached template were edited accordingly so the daily trend indicators display on the hourly chart correctly.  If you use a different time frame for your lower time frame and you use the template, you will need to adjust the periods in the indicator.  So be advised.  The indicator parameters in the EA however, do not need to be adjusted, just the Trend_TF and the Lower_TF parameters.

We will track upgrades and the different versions here in post one.

I have decided to keep the version numbering of the EA internal  So for now on the EA will always just be named TCO_Trader.mq4.   This should make updating your platforms easier when you want to add a new version.

Just apply the EA to the lower time frame chart you wish to trade, make sure the Lower_TF parameter is set to same TF as the chart.  You do not need the indicators on the chart, but just in the indicator folder.

Thanks!   Please PM me or post a reply in the thread if you have any questions.

Hi TCO,

Great and thanks again,

Akira

PS: Am currently running with global profit target, as one of the tests using MPTM.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Very impressive work my friend! I'm sure we'll all be very thankful for your skilled development.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
TCO,

Let me be the first to congratulate you both on the EA and the new thread - SIMPLY AWESOME - wishing all the success you deserve for your hard work.

Hey, I found that book you recommended, you know about programming EA's.

Here is a little something I whipped up for myself but now I can share it here.

The settings on a 1 page document, easy to print out, each heading is highlighted for easy reference if anyone has a problem, might make communication easier.

All the best, E.

TCO: Good evening!

I am so glad that you have opend this thred.

I am subcsribed!

Thank you again!

Regards,

rswamy

--- 帖子 #7 ---
Nice one, I am all ears

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Nice E,  I like the PDF.  Thanks for putting my instructions in PDF format.  TCO

--- 帖子 #9 ---
If your goal is to close all trades when your trades reach "X" amount of profit, you don't really need the complexity of all the MPTM settings, just use 1 the EA's attached.

They are all so simple, they do not even need instructions, someone may find them useful.

Cheers, E.

--- 帖子 #10 ---
No problem too easy, did some minor cosmetic formatting to make it more readable.

Now, a question - you say to put the EA on a lower time frame, so I'm guessing here, if we change time frame to Daily and back to 1 Hour, the EA will stop functioning?

I am used to doing that with khaled's EA, check the 20EMA-50EMA on Daily chart, look back to the 1 Hour for the W%R, and the EA keep running OK.

Thanks, E.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
I'm not sure what the outcome would be.  The EA only looks for trade opportunities when a new bar is created.  So if you leave it on the D1, it will only look for a new trade when a new daily bar is started.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Thanks Erebus for the EAs. I use % of balance as global profit target off MPTM like 0.5%, 1%, etc. I've quickly looked at the codes of the three EAs and see that the target is set at dollar amounts rather than % of balance. Please correct me if I am wrong. Thanks again,

Akira

--- 帖子 #13 ---
I really like your EA my friend......very nice ......

--- 帖子 #14 ---
No, I don't leave it on Daily, just been looking there and back to 1 Hour; anyway, set up new template with 960/1200 EMA's for 1 Hour chart and will leave it alone.

It made 6 trades yesterday, all open and in profit but has not open any since, possibly because there has been no retracements to activate the W%R - I like the confirmation option, I think that will give better entries, thanks for that option.

Also, the Stop Loss & Take Profit by ATR is a feature I will use - only thing, even though I set that plus the position size as percentage, the EA still displays the 0.10 Lot Size and 350 / 250 in top left - guess it doesn't update from the settings used?

See the chart about the comments I made - I will show best trade

Thanks, E.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Well, don't know about you, but it is easy for me to look at my account to see what it is, set the EA to 10% using a dollar amount, do that in my head.

I mean, say balance is $10, 530, so set the EA to close all trades at $1,000 or $1,053 or greedy $1,100 - up to you.

Maybe you use some exotic % of your account that need to use a calculator to work out?

And as your account balance goes up, the % goes up, so you will never reach that number, what to do then?

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Subscribed. Hoped you would open this thread.

--- 帖子 #17 ---
Yes, Erebus. You are right you can do that in your head. And you will need to increase your lot size as your account balance grows. All that moves not in smooth curve but in steps. The reason why I am comfortable with % set is you don't have to compute the amount each time the global target is reached, which sometimes is as frequent as a few times within a day (if set at 0.5% for instance), and across several test accounts going on, let alone you will eventually need to recompute the lot size, perhaps once a week. But as you say, the 3 EAs are very useful, and simple. Not to forget, I like to set the target very small as it helps to cope with the trend change better. But it's the matter of preference. Hope this clarifies. Akira

--- 帖子 #18 ---
hello dear, i am subscribed too,thank you so much for your kindness and caring.

regards

--- 帖子 #19 ---
An improvement to this type of EA's (TCO or 100pips) would be an option of a minimum distance that one position has to have from another, cause I see a lot of positions are opened sometimes in some pairs that range at a certain point....this way you do not have 3 positions that are 3-5 pips with each other.

Now I am not saying to make this grid  trading, no...but every time the williams goes to the o/s or o/b the EA would have to check for a certain distance from the last position opened......but that is just my 2 cents.....

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hi Guys, there may be an issue with the MACD trades,  I think it is only taking longs.  I will have to take a look at it.  So please hold off on the using the MACD trend determination.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #21 ---
Subscribed, and looking forward to where this thing ends up, especially since we are already starting with a great method, it would seem.

Thanks for starting the thread, TCO.

Scott

--- 帖子 #22 ---
TCO,

Thank you very much. I am subscribed.

I wait to try the EA and say you my opinions about it.

With regards,

Maudur

--- 帖子 #23 ---
TCO, I think in the MACD assignment line you need to use mode = 2, nor 0.

double MACD = iCustom(NULL, Trend_TF , "macd_adjustable", MACD_Fast , MACD_Slow , MACD_Signal , 3 , True , True , 2, 1);

With 2 you detect when the two EMAs cross.

With regards,

Maudur

--- 帖子 #24 ---
This is a good point and something worth looking into.

TCO, I am particularly interested in "1) Close All Open Trades On Opposite Signal - can be turned on or off"

If turned on when would the EA close all positions, when the MACD initially changes colour?

I personally would think it is best to let the D1 MACD close before closing all positions and changing direction as I have jumped the gun before manually when I saw a change in the histogram only for it to resume in the original direction the same day.
So when D1 MACD is close to changing it can flick from blue to red many times in the same day.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
subscribed, tq

Hi TCO,

thanks you very much for this EA, I'm going to test it soon, if I got more familiarized with the different settings...

In any case, nice work and generosity from you...!

all the best and please stay tuned.....

Happy Trading, jdva

--- 帖子 #27 ---
TCO, the 100Pips EA requires NO EMA 20/50 cross, just below/above for trend confirmation:

"Price needs to be above / below BOTH the 20 EMA and 50 EMA on the Daily chart. Above = BUY Below = SELL"

How does your EA determine trend? EMA cross often gives later signals...IMHO.

HT jdva

--- 帖子 #28 ---
Hi TCO. In your first post you say:

The trend shift in the 20/50 EMA method is price crossing both EMA's, and not the EMA's crossing each other.

Fahmi

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Hi,

There is an update in Post 1.  I removed TCO_Trader v1.0.mq4 and added TCO_Trader.mq4.   This has the MACD Trend Determination correction, it should now take buys and sells.   Sorry for the any confusion and inconvenience.

Also, I have decided to always keep the EA name the same and the versioning will be kept internal in the EA comments and also on the screen display comments.   I believe this will make it easier to update your platforms with the newer EAs as we go.  You should be able to just copy the new EA to your platform and recompile it or shut down and restart.  I hope I hope.

Thanks for the comments and interest.  I will try to address any questions that I can.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Hi Pirt, you are absolutely correct.  This is not an EMA cross system,  the price just needs to be above both the 20 and 50 EMAs for a buy and both below for a sell.   Sorry for the confusion.  I have edited post 1 and removed the "cross" .   The EA was code correctly, just the post was incorrect.   Thanks - good catch.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
You are correct, the EMAs do not have to cross.  The EA is code correctly, just my comments were bad.    Thanks!

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hi Guys,

Just checking out this ea. Great job TCO.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Hi 4xPIPAHOLIC, I see what you are saying, but I think that is the nature of this strategy.  Sometimes you are going to load up a bunch of trades in a range, and you may reach your trade max in that range, but if the prices takes off, your profits will be great.  If you limited your trade entry with a pip step then you may have only had one trade that hits profit and not multiple trades.  I think this strategy is designed to load up in retracements and then when the trend gets moving again, you will reap the rewards.    So....I think the pip step idea sounds good and is a conservative approach, but it may make this strategy and the EA a lot less profitable.   We can look at adding it as a future enhancement and see if in testing it has legs.  That is what I think anyways.  Might be good to hear from the  others on this.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hi Normtold, when you turn off the "Close All Open Trades On Opposite Signal" switch, the EA will manage trades strictly by TP and SL. It may try to open trades in opposite directions too.  So we may need to look at that.  I'm not sure how 100PipsADay handles this situation.  Once, a buy is triggered, does he stay with that buy until it hits tp or sl and won't open any opposite trades?   I'm in the US and we are not allowed to hedge, so I would get an error message.  I'm not sure we want to hedge for traders outside of the US.   I'm looking for some guidance on this guys.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Thanks Maudur.  I think I have the issue fixed.   I ran some quick back test on visual mode this morning and it seems to be working now.  The fix is in post 1.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #36 ---
For everyone who thanked me for opening the thread - YOU ARE WELCOME!!!    I hope this will make administrating the EA development easier.   Thanks for your interest.   Please please please use good judgement before going live.   Please back test and forward test.  I would forward test this for a good month before even thinking about going live.   Please use good money management, and set the OrderDelay and MaxOrders so that you can trade all the pairs you want and safely without being in danger of margin call.     Thanks - TCO

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Thank you very much for the input, now I'm testing the EA in 1H timeframe. Wait for results to comment. What timeframes recomendais??

Thank you very much, great job.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
I understand what you are saying and you may be right.....I always think about how I can protect the account.....cause in the past whenever I used to think about the profits it cost me.....

I am thinking when we have the major market turn multiple positions like this could be deadly to the account..... but let's think about the last pullback we had......it pulled back quite beep......if it was a major pullback most of the time it would bounce a little higher and it would come down again.....it would add more positions(at the same level as previous) .....and roll over for good, with all these positions

Anyways when we have that major market turn we will see more about this strategy......

TCO, I'm setting up a new demo account to test your ea for scalping M5 using H1 MACD for trend. Are these correct MACD settings for trading on the M5 chart? (standard settings 12.24.9 multiplied by 12). Please advise.

Fahmi

--- 帖子 #40 ---
why hast multiplied by 12?? MACD that would class values ​​if we used in 1H??.

--- 帖子 #41 ---
@pirt666

I think the 2 time frames settings is a bit lower down, could be wrong, and leave the MACD settings as normal

--- 帖子 #42 ---
And the MACD is on the longer time frame , in your case, you want 1 Hour

The W%R trade entry signal from the short time frame, for you 5 Minutes

I think that's right

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Oh.... You could be right, cause with the settings I posted the EA is taking strange trades.

Fahmi

--- 帖子 #44 ---
You nailed it buddy. It trades correctly now. Thanks a lot.

Fahmi

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Is bad. You need to select MACD at 12, 24, 9 but also to select Trend_TF to 60.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
TCO,

Thanks for the hard work.  Look forward to testing this out.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Yepp, you're right. I corrected it now.

Fahmi

--- 帖子 #48 ---
100 pips system calls for an entry as soon as the WPR goes over the threshold.

This EA appears to wait for the close before entry.

Correct? If so, should the EA be changed to reflect the 100 pip system?

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Great EA thanks for sharing

--- 帖子 #50 ---
You have the choice. It's WPR_confirmation. "False" it behaves like 100PipsADay's method, set to "True" EA waits for price to close inside.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
I recommend a TrendTF of 1440(Daily) and a SmallTF of 60(hourly).   Thanks!

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Hi Pirt666, you don't need to change the EMA settings.  You just need to change the Trend_TF to 60 AND THE Small_TF to 5.   I know this can be confusing.  You should be able to leave all the indicator vaiues in the EA parameters as is.  Just change the two TF parameters.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Hi Bill, there is ths parameter in the EA.

WPR_Confirmation = false;

- If set to true, signal must go below and above the WPR_OS level for a Buy, Signal must go above and below the WPR_BO lEVEL for a Sell       - If set to false, signal just needs to go below the WPR_OS level for a Buy, Signal just needs to go above the WPR_BO level for a Sell

I hope this helps...please let me know.   Thanks!

--- 帖子 #54 ---
But isn't it correct to say EA will only take trades at the 1hr candle close if it is OB/OS at that time? This is what the EA seems to be doing for me, only trading at the hour close. So this is slightly different than 100pips system.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
Hi RTN, I designed the EA to look for trade opportunities on the close of the last bar based on the chart you attach it to, which is hopefully the the same as your SMALL_TF.  I did this so that we are not perform all the calculations in the EA for every tick.   This will be less resource intensive and I don't believe we will miss that many trade opportunities and shouldn't affect the overall profitablity of the system.

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Yes, but it needs to close above or below- right?

100 pips system it does not need to close above or below, It only needs to go there, even in mid bar to open a trade.

Is that correct. Checking my account history, his trades open at odd times- not just on the hour.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Hi TCO,

100pips keeps the positions open until they hit S/L or TP but will not take any positions in the opposite direction until one or the other has happened.

I would like to do something different with your EA, when the D1 MACD has a colour change and the daily bar has closed I would like the EA to close all open positions and start looking for positions in the opposite direction (in the direction of the MACD).

--- 帖子 #58 ---
I brought this to TCO's attention yesterday in a PM. I think there will be quite a difference in the trades taken, actually. However, I have no idea whether/how it will affect profitability. Guess only time will tell. I am running my EA on one PC and TCO's EA on another, so I will try to compare trades from time to time. The fact that mine looks for trade conditions on every tick might be why it won't take trades on a backtest, which is somewhat frustrating, even though I don't put much stock in MT4 backtests.

Scott

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Hi Bill you are absolutely right.  My EA will open trades on the Lower TF - so you won't see trades opened at odd times, but on the hour, if you the put the EA on the hourly chart.  I just code my EAs this way.  It is less resource intensive, I don't think we will miss that many trades we may get into some trades later  - which may or may not be advantageous.   So my EA does not trade exactly as 100PipsADay system does.  Thanks - TCO.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Thanks Scott and for helping with the trade delay logic - that was very handy.  Looking forward to the other features you have proposed.  I will probably spend some time this weekend working on some of the new features and testing, we will probably have some bugs found also by then that I can fix.   - TCO

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Sounds great, TCO. Thanks for all your work thus far.

By the way, are you running a forward demo with your EA? Just curious how it is doing and if you would consider putting it on a trade explorer...

Scott

--- 帖子 #62 ---
Hi Scott, well I finally got some time yesterday to setup 3 demos, one for each HTF trend strat  However, I found the MACD bug this morning and I have to apply that the MACD demo still.   I have never setup a trade explorer here, so I will have to investigate how to do that.  Any tips...?   Thanks - TCO.

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Hi Erebus, sorry for the late reply.  This may be a bug where I'm not displaying the screen at the proper location in the EA.  I will double check that tonight when I get home from work   Also, are you using ATR based TP and SL?   I will let you know what I find out.  Thanks - TCO.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
I've been doing the backtest on 1H, I modified WPR_confirmation to false and more or less get the same results I had quesi to true. In several seasons makes a good accumulation of profits but after a while makes minor losses to eventually return to the same initial balance virtually. Something I'm doing wrong?? I configure something else?

Thank you very much.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
There's nothing to it. Just go to your profile page and click on the Trade Explorers link at the top of the leftmost column. There you can give your Trade Explorer a name and then just input your account details (account number, investor password) so it can sync trades and display results. It may take a little while to sync when you initially create it. You can create one for each of your demos, if you wish. Let me know if you have Q's.

Hi TallCoolOne, any particular reason to use 13 as default atr period on the ea ?

I tried to search on d1 20ema&50ema if it was written somewhere the use of this particular value of 13 but i coudn't find ?

is it as per d1 20ema&50ema rules ? indeed i was trying to identify in which manner were choosed the reccomended sl,tp of the d1 20ema50ema thread on the first post.

thanks.

Here is V 392. I have several on one of my backup drives let me see what else I can find

I thought that was what the ATR indicator was set at on 100PipsAday template screen.  I could be wrong.   You can change that setting to whatever you need it to be.  Please let us know if you find a better setting.  Thanks!

There is more, a rar file of 30 mb ranging from v 226 lol. I can't upload it from home but will do it tomorrow from work.

TCO, I am using the D1 MACD entry, H1 wiliiams%,  D1 MACD is blue.

Williams % has gone into oversold a couple of times now on EUR/AUD, stayed there a while and no buys were opened up on that pair.

WPR confirmation is set to false.

The EA has opened positions on a couple of other pairs at 16:39 and 16:40pm.

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Wow, you must not throw anything away, LOL.

I probably wouldn't be interested in one going back that far. Would love anything from 392 through 432. Thanks again!

Scott

Tolex, I would suggest you take your question to the Platform Tech thread (http://www.forexfactory.com/forumdisplay.php?f=69). This thread is dedicated to TCO's EA.

Scott

Hi Normtold. Please post your setfile and check for any error messages in the Expert Tab or the Journal Tab.  I will take a look at it tonight when I get home.   Sorry for your difficulties.   Thanks!

--- 帖子 #79 ---
TCO, no need to apologise, thanks for your efforts.

There are no error messages in the journal.

It has opened 1 buy each on Cad/Jpy and Eur/Jpy but did not on Eur/Aud and Gbp/Aud using the same set file.

On my other 2 platforms trades opened up on all 4 pairs mentioned as soon as the williams% went into OS territory with Khaled's EA.

I really would prefer it if positions opened up as soon at Williams% goes into O/B O/S just as 100pips specified with the strategy.

Quite often those positions immediately go into profit like Gbp/Aud, Eur/Aud and Gbp/Nzd just did.

I am getting an error message when trying to attach the set file to this post so have sent it to your e-mail address.

All the best

Norman

Hi Norman,  I think you can rename the set file to SETFILE.TXT and will allow you to save it here.

My EA won't open trades at the same time as other EAs because my EA is based on the lower TF bar close.  For the moment that is just the way it is.  I may consider allowing the trader to toggle that in a future upgrade and base trade entry on the current bar and not the previous bar.  Let me noodle on it.   I"m not sure we are missing out on that many pips and the trade could continue down  for a buy trigger for awhile after it goes under the oversold level of -80.  Are you seeing 100s of trades where the entry is comprimised by waiting for the bar close or are you seeing onsie twosie today?   I think we need to consider the big picture and 1000s of trades for many pairs throughout the year when worrying about missing a few pips at trade entry.  But saying that.  I don't think it would be a hard change go make it happen and it could be controlled by external EA parameters.   Just my 2 cents.  Thanks!!

--- 帖子 #81 ---
TCO please read post 415 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...88#post6690888

and post 864 http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...42#post6719942

There was another post but I cannot find it.

The reason I would like the EA to open positions as soon as Williams% goes into OB OS is because 100pips has traded that method successfully for 18 months and he thinks that parameter is important.

I like all the other options you provide especially the option to close all positions on a change of D1 MACD.

All the best

--- 帖子 #82 ---
hi, on this thread, it's clearly mentioned that, on default setting this EA takes positions on Willams% OB/OS levels once  bar closes (60 min bar).

If you want to use like 100pipsAday EA, just, change it to false

rs

--- 帖子 #83 ---
I would like that too. We just missed a long entry on GBP/AUD because it dipped under 80 but didn't close there.

With the delay bug in 100 pip's EA, this one is still the best one to use.

--- 帖子 #84 ---
TCO, I have implemented the Close-Out-After-Certain-Profit code in my EA and am just waiting now for it to hit the figure I specified to make sure it works properly. If it does, I will email you the code for your consideration of adding it to your EA this weekend. Hopefully I'll see some more pips so the test can be completed tonight or tomorrow.

Scott

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Hi Norm,  I know this posts are there.  My EA is not designed to trade like that...as of yet.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
The trade data shows OK for all open trades now, maybe it was just a matter of waiting for the first hour to pass, let the EA refresh the data?

Yes, I am using ATR (14) x 1 both for Stop Loss & Take Profit

Most open profit from surprise pair of EUR-CHF

Have closed loss on USD-CAD & AUD-NZD

Have closed profit on NZD-JPY, CAD-JPY, USD-CHF & EUR_CAD (3)

This is with risk of 0.5% by 4 max trades = 2% per set

As on the chart shown, only 2 trades opened, so I thinking maybe go with 1.0% by 2 max trades next week

Looks great so, not as many as the other EA, but nice & steady profits thus far

Thanks again for your efforts, much appreciated

PS: on edit - forgot to mention, using Breakeven stop of 10 pips after a move of 60, you can see the lines on chart

--- 帖子 #89 ---
Interesting, yesterday this opened a SELL trade, but if I closed that now, it would open a BUY trade

Anyone else have this trade?

Guess this happens when MACD is so close to center line and market is range a little bit

--- 帖子 #90 ---
Great Scott.  I hope it works.  Is it designed to close after a certain profit per pair for for the entire basket of trades?   Look forward to seeing the code.

I was going to work this weekend on the bar vs tick option, the .01 lot size per $1000, and the trader determined trend method features.....but we are going away to Chicago for an open house for my niece so I may not get in as much work as I want to.

So be patient guys.  Improvements and features are coming.    Just need the time to work on them.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
TCO, it seems to work fine, but of course further testing will be good to do. It is based on the entire basket, not a certain pair. Also, I made it to be based on a percentage profit rather than a dollar amount. That way, it is not something you have to update unless you just want to. The percentage is set in the parameters. I will shoot you the code soon.

Scott

--- 帖子 #92 ---
TCO, thanks for sharing the EA.  I have been testing it using the 1H for trend and 5M chart for WPR OB/OS.   I have been doing this to generate a bunch of trades and check that I understand how your EA works.   I have it loaded on the EU, GU, AU, USDCAD, and UJ 5 minute charts.   It works exactly as I expected it to.

The EA worked great yesterday when the USD took a beating and every other currency took a baseball bat to the USD - up 2% during the NY afternoon session.  However, in the sideways chop leading up to NFP for the last 10 or 12 hours, it got clobbered.  Just like everything else, if you catch the trend, you're golden.  Look out for the consolidation periods.  I am using the ATR based SL and TP, so I think this contributed to the whipsaw trading during the sideways movement of the currencies.   The EA would identify an OB/OS condition correctly, but because the trading range was so tight for the previous 13 or 14 candles, the SL and TP were very small.  I am using 3 ATR for SL and 6 ATR for TP over the previous 14 bars.   Invariably, the trades were stopped out during this tight trading range.

Not sure if I have discovered a possible bug, or a user error.   I turned of the EA about 15 minutes prior to the NFP announcement and turned it back on about 5 minutes afterward.  I got a USDJPY Sell trade while the price was at the bottom of the range, and while WPR (5M) was in the oversold territory.  Admittedly, I should have waited at least another 10 minutes for the market to settle down and to enable the EA, but I have been enjoying watching it trade.    See the two charts below.  the second one is simply a zoomed in chart of the first.  the short entry was at the bottom of the  candle at the dotted line.  I had turned on the EA well after the WPR had left the OB area.  The WPR was not quite into the OS zone when I enabled it.

Thanks for taking a look.

TCO:

I am also running your EA on a 4H trend / 15M entry demo,  using ATR based SL and TP.  Have you considered an ATR based trailing stop?  Perhaps along the lines of once the price is 2 ATR's in profit, trail by 3 or 4 ATR.  once price is 4 ATR's in profit, trail by 2 or 3 ATR;  as price continues, continue to tighten the trailing stop and let the market close the order when the move has been exhausted.

This process could certainly be done manually, but since we have the computer and EA doing all the rest of the work, why not this too....

T

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Greetings TCO - thanks for opening a separate thread for your EA - it will be interesting to see how the respective EAs perform over time.

Still running manually and my rules follow the original thoughts with the following criteria.  Not sure if any of these features are possible nor how much effort that would entail.  I'm sure Erebus has some thoughts on all of this.

Follow the Day MACD line crosses _ looks like 100pips is not paying much attention to the MACD bars

If Day MACD lines cross, close any trades open from previous trend.

Open new trades as Williams crosses into overbought / oversold per the normal rule set, but with the following criteria.

Only accept additional trades if Williams has crossed 50 and then returns to overbought / oversold - see attached image

6 hour delay for accepting new trades.

SL / TP can be discretionary, but the current approach of SL 260 / TP 320 is as good as any for initial settings, OR TS of 1 X Day ATR7 once profit reaches 320 - this way, you are not limited on max number of open positions as you have locked in profits (you'll still need an account size that'll cover the margin depending on broker rules / leveraging)

A separate alert may be useful but until I have figured out how to code in MQ4, unlikely - my last code writing was Fortran / Basic / 8800 machine code and needless to say, that was a wile ago!

All thoughts and critique welcome

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Hi Scott, sounds nice.  Looking forward to it.   I made code changes to the my test version of the EA today, to trade based on ticks and not close of the bar.  I will do some testing with it and see how it goes.   The trader will be able to toggle this on and off.   Thanks - TCO.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Hi Traders,

I have applied the TCO EA in to my Alpari UK Mt4 1 hr charts and I am getting error alerts. Please see the attached picture. Anybody has any solution? Thanks in advance.

Roy

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Hi TPC, thanks for your testing efforts.  I think there is bug somewhere when the EA is first applied or turned back on, it will open an oddball trade sometimes.  Not sure if I have variable not getting reset or what.  I had that happen to me too. I may have to apply some internal print statements and do some backtesting to see if I can find it.  So I will keep looking.

I have written the ATR based trailing,  jump stop and breakeven SL before in an older EA.  I will look and see about making that a future upgrade feature.  I was waiting for when someone was going to ask for that.....

TCO

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Hi Roy, are the trades that are currently open, opened by the EA, if so...then I would say there is an issue with the broker server not executing the trades and it is timing out when trying to open it.  I haven't run across this issue with IBFX.  Hopefully it is a temporary issue.  Not sure how to help you otherwise.  TCO

--- 帖子 #99 ---
We might want to consider a RefreshRates() command in there prior to the OrderSend() command. I didn't see one in there presently. Might help with some brokers. Just a thought.

Scott

--- 帖子 #100 ---
Hi TCO,

Thanks a lot for your quick reply. The present trades as you see now on the chart are opened by the EA. As you assume, it could be a broker server problem!. I loaded the EA yesterday, so far only two trades opened. I shall then try another broker.

Thanks again.

Roy

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Hi BritPip, it looks to me like the line cross matches up when the bars cross over our under the zero line.  That is what the EA is using for trend determination.   As far as excepting new trades based on crossing over the -50 level on the WPR and then back to the OS, OB, is this a method that you are currently using for trade entry manually?  It is working.  How long have you backtested this idea?

Guys, I don't want to just muck the EA with a lot of it might be nice....to have this or that.   I know it would be great to add the feature and be able to back test the heck out it...but first let's make sure the EA is working as designed right now with the 3 trend methods on the higher TF and with the Williams signal on the lower TF.  Lets make sure the trade management features work as expected.  Lets forward test the current EA on demos and make sure it is profitable before we start adding the nice to haves.   I would love for BritPip so show me you are getting a hit rate over 50 % with and positive R:R on your manual strategy enhancement.  The I would say by all means lets code it in this EA or create anew EA around that idea.     I appreciate the ideas and I want to keep hearing the ideas, but I'm not just going to start adding code to the current EA because of one screen print.  We need to know there is a basis for adding the code.

Please don't misread this.  I'm not mad, but I only have so much time and I want to put the best EA out that I can.  So please take that into consideration when asking for improvements and features.   Thanks...

--- 帖子 #102 ---
TCO,

No problem - this is what I am currently running on my live account with manual entries.  I only got into this approach in the past couple of weeks, so the criteria is only up for discussion - I really don't expect anyone to code this without a significant return rate.  Currently since getting back in the pool last month I am up up over 800 pips and the win/loss ratios look good, but it's only 5 weeks and there are 2 different methodologies in play.  I am running with 0.02 lots per entry with leverage 100:1.

I'll certainly run the data once I have a statistically sound baseline - other than that, keep up the great work ans have fun in Chicago.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Think Brit, sounds good.  We will keep this in consideration for possible roll out.  Thanks for your efforts!

--- 帖子 #104 ---
Hi, Britpip7. Would you please share your EA setting here?

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Hi all, just want to ask which timeframe is better use?

Thanks and much appreciate!

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Depends on your RISK appetite

This EA is based on 2 famous threads by generous member

http://www.forexfactory.com/100pipsaday

Read those to get some understanding, but I can tell you that both are using the DAILY charts

There are 3 trading methods with TCO's EA, and at least 5 combinations of time frames to choose, so you have a lot of choice

Best do some heavy duty back testing.... or just go with the flow, Daily & 1 Hour has been proven to work

Regards, E.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
I am only trading manually - no EA loaded.  Currently watching the activity on the 3 threads and forward testing using 0.02 lots in a live account.

I watch my chosen pairs on my daily multi chart and then switch to the tri screen view if something looks interesting.  Following 100pips rules (mostly) for third screen strategy.

--- 帖子 #108 ---
, you are so great!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Did you resolve your Error problem with TCO EA?  I had that problem.  If it is like mine it is in the auto trade manager. Take it back to fixed lot size and that should resolve this.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Hi Alpine,

I didn't solve the problem yet and I can't. Is your broker same as mine? I have decided to test the EA on some other broker and see what happens. I leave the problem resolution to the computer geeks in our thread.

Thanks for asking.

Roy

--- 帖子 #111 ---
I do not think it has anything to do with your broker. How many lots are you trading with the ea? Do you trade mini lots? What is your balance ?

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Hi Alpine,

I just started on an Alpari UK demo account with $10,000/= balance and 0.01 lots when the EA started showing up error alerts after nearly one day when the currency pairs got ready for trades.

Regards,

Roy

--- 帖子 #113 ---
There will be a new version soon.  Hold on.  But check to make sure you are only trading one of the strategies, and ST is set by ATR, and you are not using money management.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
I have exactly the same problem. I got only error 128 instead of actual trades. No matter what lot size i'm using constant or dynamic the result is the same. My broker is Alpari NZ. So it looks that the bot doesn't like this particular broker.  Is it programmed to make the necessary adjustments for a 5-digits broker?

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Hi Guys/Gals,

Update in post one.  The EA has been updated along with the instructions.

TCO_Trader v1.2

- Close all orders after certain profit percentage reached - thanks to Scott (thehenryfam) for coding.  That is all orders for all pairs.  The entire basket.

- Manual Descretionary Trend Determination - where trader can select GoLong = true or GoShort = true, will still use Williams% on lower TF for trade entry.

- Trades can be triggered on close of last lower tf bar or now they can be triggered on current bar(ticks). Settings for tick mode - CheckOncePerBar = false and WPR_Confirmation = false

- LotSize .01 per $1000 option added

- Verify LotSize for min and max size allowed by broker, lotsize also normalized

You should be able to trade more like the 100Pips method, by opening trades as soon as the Williams% dips below the OS level or above the OB level

CheckOncePerBar = false

Hopefully the issues with lotsizing have been solved.  Please test thoroughly.

Please update with the TCO Trader EA on post 1.  Please verify your settings, because new settings have been added to the external parameters.

Please report any issues.

Thanks for all your help

TCO

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Does it close all including other trades not placed by this EA?  Do I need to turn this on for each pair or only one?

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Hi TCO,

thanks for EA updating, I'm going to test the new feature for opening trades as soon as W% dips below/above OS/Ob level...have set options CheckOncePerBar and WPR_Confirmation both to false...is that right?

HT jdva

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Good question Alpine.  I should have explained that more.  It will close all trades for all pairs.  So be aware.  If you want to close all trades based on a certain percentage gain of the account balance, I would set it as default true on all charts.   Thanks!

--- 帖子 #119 ---
Yes HT jdva, that is exactly right.  Set both to false and it should be pretty much be inline with 100PipsADay rules for taking trades.  Hopefully!   Please let me know if you have any issues.   Thanks!

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Hey TCO!

I've got some question for you.

Where i can download ex4 file?

TCO_3rdScreen_multi_strategy

i do not see that ;-)

--- 帖子 #121 ---
...but your time delay option is working much better....!

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Hi Veni,  I simplified the name to TCO_Trader.   Just download the TC_Trader.mq4 in post 1.  It should be always current with the latest updates.   Copy the TCO_Trader.mq4 to your  to the experts folder and either compile it or close/open your MT4 session, this will create the exe version.  It should be ready to be loaded on your charts then.   Please read the instructions for the settings and make sure they are set correctly.  Let me know if you have any questions on the settings for the method you want to trade.   Thanks and good luck - TCO.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Hi jcva, I didn't know the time trade delay was not working.  I think they posted issues with the other EA on 100PipsADay's thread, but I think our time trade delay was working solid as designed.   Please let know if you have any issues.   Thanks!

--- 帖子 #124 ---
sorry, TCO, I meant better than 100Pips EA time delay, your time delay is working fine from beginning on and all other options I'm testing too...ATR, 20/50 emas on 60/1440 tfs, at once opening trades getting into W% OS/OB levels...at odd times, whether works better or not will show us the future...not using TS, BE, Jump Stop, Dynamic lotsize etc., using Close Trades On Opposite Signal enabled but so far no opportunity...

Very nice work TCO, thank you very much,

Happy Trading, jdva

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Hi folks,

I'm demotesting on 20 pairs, I dont care about trending or not, that's hypothetical IMHO...nobody knows which pair will be trending in furure and when I only select currently trending pairs I might probably miss pairs which are now in consolidation and will trend tomorrow...

Happy trading. jdva

I'm thinking maybe other new features, would be

ATR option for jump, trailing and breakeven SL,

PipStep between trades for those who requested it

Margin protection limit

Maximum pairs limit.

Nice work TCO. Congrats to 100 pips and everyone on an interesting strat. I believe the move to BE/jumping stop/ and Pipstep may be the answer to the DD problem during consolidation and trend changes. The pipstep would minimize loading up exposure around a congestion area. Like all trend systems there will be some DD. The system has a solid entry method for sure.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
TCO, no issues so far, option CloseTradesOnOppositeSignal occurs this night on sold EURJPY and GBPJPY with losses of 150 and 165 pips, the new opened buys are currently slightly in the red, no trade for GBPCHF....all other 17 pairs show green pips together +4% on equity....!

Hi Scott,

I just wanted to let you know I had 2 baskets close with 3% profit last night.  One on my Ichimoku test demo and one on my 20/50 EMA demo.  The MACD demo is close to the profit level so it should close another soon.  Thanks for the code, works like a charm.  TCO

--- 帖子 #142 ---
No problem, glad it worked for you. I had another basket close on my demo as well. Something about locking in those gains that feels nice, especially since we never know when these trends will finally end and switch around.

Scott

--- 帖子 #143 ---
I hear ya Scott.  Slow and steady eddie profits.  My goal a month is only 6%.   So if you do the math on that over 10 yrs.  It could be very nice.  So I like the idea of basket trading, spreading the risk, taking what the market gives us.  Nipping at it and locking in the gains.  Time will tell.  I have   Close_Trades_On_Opposite_Signal = true, so I think that is where the potential hits will come on the trend reversal.  So we will keep an eye on it and see how it works.  I'm going to demo this method for at least a month, maybe more before going live.  I will get my trade explorer set up tonight so others can track my progress with the 3 trend methods.   Thanks - TCO

--- 帖子 #144 ---
I have link my DEMO account to my Trade Explorer, all stats are there for all to view

Only opened and first trade on the 5 June 2013, last week

Using the 20-50_EMA method

Stop Loss & Take Profit of 1 x ATR(14)

And move to lock 10 pips profit after trade has moved 70 pips

Just taken out on that on the EUR-USD - why is it dropping like that?

Doing really good so far, thanks TCO

--- 帖子 #145 ---
I noticed in the information settings on the chart mine still shows the fixed SL and TP even though I have ATR set to True.  I would be very nice if we could see on the chart what the ATR settings will use the next time it takes a trade based on the ATR settings.

--- 帖子 #146 ---
I noticed as a default the Buy and Sell Direction settings are both set to false.  Shouldn't they by default both be set to true?

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Hi Alpine.  I agree.  I will work on it.  I would like to display more of the settings info on the screen also, along with percentage of account increase for current trades open.   Thanks for the info.  We will get it ironed out.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Yes, I am very pleased so far as well. My goal is between 5-10% per month. If that can be done consistently, you are right -- things look really nice in 10 years. Before going live, though, I want to see what happens when these big trends change direction. How will these EAs respond to that? That is what really needs to be analyzed with all of the different variations of the EA we have running around here. Which of the settings will handle the flip-around the best? Clearly there will be some losses, but will it be a 25% account cut? Worse? This is what I need to know before jumping in with real $$.

Some will say use PSAR to turn the EA off for some pairs, but honestly I would rather be more conservative with the trading and then let the market take me out. By taking profits, you lock in some gains and immediately reduce your exposure to the market. So if the market should turn not long after you take profit, theoretically your pain shouldn't be too bad.

I am trying one other demo with a slightly different take... I am using PSAR as the main trend indicator and then I am only adding new positions if the existing positions for the pair are already in profit. I am closing all trades for a pair once PSAR is confirmed to have changed. I will let you know how that works out.

Scott

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Great Scott.  Nice to see some new methods being used.  Nothing wrong with experimentation.  If that works, maybe we could add it as another trend determination method to go along with the others.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Hi Alpine.  Those should be both set to false, unless you don't want to use the three current trend methods - Ichimoku, 20/50 EMA or MACD.

Say you have your own proven method for determining a trend, that is discretionary - maybe using trend lines or whatever.

If you feel we are in an uptrend based on your method - Set the GoLong = true,  set GoShort,  Use_Ichimoku_Trend, Use_EMA_Trend, Use_MACD_Trend all to false.   The EA will only take buys when the Williams% hits the OS level.    Then the EA will manage those trades using whatever other trade management features you select for your lotsize, tp, sl   etc.   Select GoShort = true, if you feel we are in a downtrend and set all the other trend variables to false.

I hope that helps.   Please let me know if you have any other questions.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
I see the SL and TP information changes from the default to the ATR when it takes a trade.  That is good.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Sorry Erebus I didn't reply earlier, good to hear.  Good to see someone testing the BE SL.     Keep us in the loop on the 1ATR settings.  Thanks!

Guys, if you post a message in the thread and I don't reply, don't be afraid to resubmit the msg to the thread or send a PM.  Sometimes I miss things.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #153 ---
congrats TallCoolOne, this is by far best EA with a lot of features included that works.

if EA continue to work as expected I will go live, with $4.000

CloseAfterPctProfit = true;

ProfitPct                 = 3;

2013.06.11 15:39:39    TCO_Trader USDJPY,Daily: Account Profit Reached. All Open Trades Have Been Closed

may I suggest couple features

1. enable/disable EA : true/false

2. hidden TP : true/false

3. hidden SL : true/false

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Hi Prozor, I'm glad you are having good success with it and thanks for your kind words.  Please really test it though before you go live.  I would work through a couple of trend reversals so we experience the gnashing of teeth, heartburn and night sweats as we go through some DD, because you know it is coming.  We had a bout of it last Monday and it seemed like everyone was running around like chicken little.     When you backtest the EA you can really see the ebb and flow of DD and profit.   If you go live, I would use min lot sizing too or the 0.01 per 1000 option, until you get comfortable with the DD and profit cycle.  Just my 2 cents.  We shouldn't blow any accounts with these methods if we are smart.   I'm gong to add a margin protection limit to this EA in the next update.  So we won't take any more trades once that level is reached.

As far as your suggested features.  I think they are good ideas and we can add them.  I think with the hidden TP and SL, we should still send the broker a protective SL just in case the markets goes against us and for some reason the EA is not able to monitor the current price to trigger the hidden SL.  I should be able to add these in the next update.  Thanks for your suggestions.   TCO

Hello TCO.  Been experimenting with your new EA.  H1 chart.  Use_EMA_Trend = true, Use_MACD_Trend = true.  Why did TCO_Trader open a buy trade on in the attached pic when both MACD and EMA are trending down?

Thanks for your assistance.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
I got whipsawed this morning so far by the CTOOS option on EURJPY and GBPJPY but nevertheless I think it is an usefull option. I cannot complain about 10% equity increase in two days...! Thx TCO!

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Maybe post your settings screen(s) so we can take a look?

Scott

--- 帖子 #158 ---
EasyRyder, there are 3 different trend determination methods in the EA, I think you should choose just one of them on a single chart...IMO

HT jdva

--- 帖子 #159 ---
You might be correct.  However, if the EA would allow for two, or three, thread determination criteria, it would help to filter out periods of trend change, when you don't want to be in the market.  My opinion, and my experience.  Thanks for your reply.

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Hi EZ, I'm not sure on why the trades were taken.   I know when the EA is first attached, sometimes weird trades are opened and this is troubling.  I need to nail that down.  As far as using multiple trend determination methods as a filter for the overall trend - I have thought of that also as a toggle on/off option.  The 3 current methods seem to be profitable so I'm not sure if there is a need to add that filter at the moment.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
TCO,

thx for considering implementing new features.

ATR_TP and ATR_SL function great so I think you should try to implement dummy SL and TP for protection while real (hidden) TP/SL should use ATR function.

Is that correct?

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Are you using the MACD strategy?

Is your Williams Confirmation True or False?

--- 帖子 #169 ---
no, I'm using EMA strategy, dont like MACD...

WPR set to false

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Which pair? What time period? What settings? What modeling quality?

I have said it before, and I'll say it again. MT4 backtesting leaves a lot to be desired. Don't put a whole lot of stock in it. You are better off forward testing. There are dozens of people forward testing this right now, and as far as I know, all are having positive results. These forward tests are in a real, live market. That's the BEST test of all. Will it always be profitable? No one can say with any certainty. But I'll tell you this... getting good results on a backtest doesn't guarantee good future results either! So my advice to you is to fire up a demo and see how this thing trades for yourself. Kick the tires and put it through its paces in different market conditions and see where it takes you.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
TCO, in the case where "CheckOncePerBar = true" you need to find the a place(s) to reset "New_Bar = false".  I do not see where it ever gets reset.

--- 帖子 #172 ---

TCO: hi!

As reported earlier by Easy Rider, I also could see the same anomoly on my nzdjpy chart trades.

Here is the NZDJPY chart screen with 2 buy trades

This demo, set files set to only Buy mode.

Using ema on highTf=1440 and lower tf=60.Thanks!

--- 帖子 #173 ---
I understand the MacD strategy and am doing well with it.  I am going to also try your settings.  Thanks

--- 帖子 #174 ---
I stand corrected, TCO.  New_Bar is reset in the New_Bar function routine.  Looks good to me now that I see the reset..

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Hi EZ, this is at the top of the code.

if(CheckOncePerBar == true)

{

Check_New_Bar();

shift = 1;

double BidPrice = iClose(Symbol(), Lower_TF, shift);

double AskPrice = iClose(Symbol(), Lower_TF, shift);

}

else

if(CheckOncePerBar == false)

{

shift = 0;

New_Bar = false;

BidPrice = Bid;

AskPrice = Ask;

}

if(CheckOncePerBar == true)  is true.

it performs the Check_New_Bar() function.

Down in the Check_New_Bar(), the New_Bar is set to false.

void Check_New_Bar()

{

static datetime New_Time=0;

New_Bar = false;

if(New_Time != Time[0])

{

New_Time = Time[0];

New_Bar = true;

}

}

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Hi Rswamy, if I understand you correctly.  You have set GoLong=true and GoShort=false, Use_Ichimoku_Trend = false, Use_EMA_Trend = false and Use_MACD_Trend = false?   If this is the case, it will take buys when the Williams% dips below the -80 level. It won't look at Ichimoku, 20/50 EMA or MACD for trend.   You are telling the EA, I think we are in an uptrend, so I only want to take buys when the Williams% has the appropriate trigger condition (< -80).

Please let me know if this is  your understand.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Hey EZ, no issues.  I saw your note at work and started to freak alittle bit.  I checked it when I got home and all good.  I appreciate you checking the code.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #178 ---
Nice....I'm glad it is working for you.  What are trend method are you testing?  What are your settings?   Thanks!

--- 帖子 #179 ---
The delay doesn't seem to be working properly.

I have it set for 6.

I show several occurrences where orders were opened closer together than that.

--- 帖子 #180 ---
-------------------

TCO: hi!

Thank you for the prompt message.

What I mean is, on this example--nzdjpy-- high time presently (20--50 EMA--1440) is on down trend.

Sure, according to set crieria, it should take buy trades when the Williams % meet the trigger condition (< -80 levels).

Though this criteria can be met only when high time frame establishes  uptrend ( on buy mode set).

Presently, nzdjpy pair main trend is at  downtrend.

Iam using= Use_ichimoku_Trend=false; Use _MACD_Trend=false;

Use _EMA_Trend=True

Thanks!

Regards,

rswamy

The template had the wrong settings for the EAs. They should be set to 20 and 50.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Keep you in the loop, no problem, can do much better than that, didn't have much work for this account reporting software I have but now I dusted it off and I like the results; can't wait to hit 100 trades to see the percentage results.

See the screenshot below, to see what I talking about!

And your comment about setting the 3 methods to "false" and using the OnlyLong / OnlyShort filter, has given me an idea of how to set up the EA to make Turtle trades; now with the trailing stop feature, this could be awesome

Big thanks again

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Not if you are putting the template on the hourly chart.  The settings show what the Daily EMA would look like on the hourly chart.  Please read post 1.

--- 帖子 #184 ---
Tell me what you mean by buy mode.  Do you mean GoLong = true ?

If you set that to true, it will ignore EMA_Trend = true.

If you want to use the EMA_Trend for your trading, then make GoLong = false and make GoShort = false and EMA_Trend = true

--- 帖子 #185 ---
Wow Erebus.  Nice results.  That is very nice to see.  I hope it continues for you.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #186 ---
-----------------------------

TCO: Hi!

Yes, I mean  buy mode= GoLong

Now I got it, and that explains everything, perfectly.

Earlier I understood otherway. Thank you!

Regards,

rswamy

--- 帖子 #187 ---
You guys lost me...

Where is GoLOng & GoShort settings?

Are you talking about these in picture or am I missing something as I don't find them in EA settings?

Thanks, E.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Okay..here we go.   In version 1.2 which is now on post 1.    These new settings were added to the EA.

Discretionary_Settings = "Discretionary Trend Settings";

GoLong = false;                          - If set to true will only take buy trades on appropriate Williams% signal, make sure all other trend

determination methods are set to false

GoShort = false;                         - If set to true will only take sell trades on appropriate Williams% signal, make sure all other trend

determination methods are set to false

This would be used by the trader if they had a discretionary method for determining the trend and didn't want to use the Ichimoku, 20/50 EMA or MACD methods.  So they would set those methods to false and set GoLong = true  for an uptrend or GoShort = true for the downtrend.

I'm sorry this is not clear for everyone.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Great, I must of missed the update message, I was away all day yesterday

This is excellent as I mention, I would like to trial the EA but use Turtle Channel as the filter for trend on Daily

But still have the W%R entry function as it seems to catch the retracements just at the right time

So I back to the drawing board, thanks, just what I need

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Is anyone setting up a side by side chart for each strategy?  We need to do that, for say 3 or 6 months to see if there are any major differences.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
Hi TCO.

I'm testing the EA and I think it is a bug with TP and SL for sell orders.

I select TP = 150 and SL = 0.

I made BT. With Buy orders all is ok but with Sell orders TP was not updated.

I saw a code and I found it:

With Buy orders you have:

"if((BuyTicket > 0)  && ((TakeProfit > 0) || (StopLoss > 0)))"

But with Sell orders you have:

"if((SellTicket > 0) && ((TakeProfit > 0) && (StopLoss > 0)))"

It needs to be

if((SellTicket > 0) && ((TakeProfit > 0) || (StopLoss > 0)))

With regards,

Maudur

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Also, I found next:

At end of "if(BuySignal == true)", the EA has:

...

if(BuyTakeProfit > 0)

{

BuyTakeProfit = AdjustAboveStopLevel(Symbol(),BuyTakeProfit,5);

}

AddStopProfit(BuyTicket,BuyStopLoss,BuyTakeProfit);

But, at end of "if(SellSignal == true)", the EA has:

...

if(SellTakeProfit > 0)

{

SellTakeProfit = AdjustBelowStopLevel(Symbol(),SellTakeProfit);  // without 5

}

AddStopProfit(SellTicket,SellStopLoss,SellTakeProfit);

It is correct?

With regards,

Maudur

--- 帖子 #193 ---
I think TCO is running one demo for each of the three trend methods. Should be adding them as Trade Explorers soon.

Scott

--- 帖子 #194 ---
And furthermore, I want a guarantee that future results will be the same as those test results

Question for TCO - re the positions size calculation

- If I use DynamicLotSize = true it will ignore the StopLoss pips and use ATR_SL_Setting ??? I have it set for true

Thanks, E.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Hi TCO, I'm using EMA trend, MaxPos 6, Delay 6h, ATR SL/TP, WPR and CheckOncePerBar false, CloseTradeOnOppositeSignal true...

but this morning I'm getting big DD because of weaker JPY...should have used CloseAfterPctProfit option yesterday..., no matter stii learning...

HT jdva

--- 帖子 #196 ---
Good finds Maurdur, I will make sure those are corrected on the next release.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Hi Erebus it should use the ATR_SL over the normal SL for the dynamic lot sizing.

--- 帖子 #198 ---
A couple of questions if you don't mind regarding V 1.2

The parameter CheckOncePerBar is that just for the trailing s/l or does it affect the Williams% indicator too?

The Parameter Close_Trades_On_Opposite_Signal if set to true will positions close out intraday if/when MACD changes from red to blue or does it wait for a close of current candle to see if there is a permanent colour change?

--- 帖子 #199 ---
I got the answer for first question - YES it does, all my trade opening times are right on the hour eg. 11:00, 13:00 and on the open price of new 1 hour bar

--- 帖子 #200 ---
OK, thanks, got some trades going and yes, that is how it is working

Now just need this market to turn around, what is going on, sure taking out stops on the Aussie crosses

--- 帖子 #201 ---
Thank-you Erebus, I have CheckOncePerBar set to false and it did open a position on Nzd/Jpy at 11:57 when I activated the EA, seems to be doing what I want.

I am forward testing the Close_Trades_On_Opposite_Signal so will see how it deals with a change in D1 MACD.

--- 帖子 #202 ---
yes...you are right, I also got several trades less than 6h apart....but just several minutes till 1h apart form 6h delay...!

--- 帖子 #203 ---
On the same pair?

--- 帖子 #204 ---
not exactly....three xxxCHF pairs, by chance?

--- 帖子 #205 ---
noticed weaknes EURUSD on D1 chart - testing trade only short turn off MACD
Use_MACD_Trend  = false

GoShort         = true

if I understand correctly EA will open trade based on the WPR settings

pro7

--- 帖子 #206 ---
AUDUSD too.... this morning opened at 4:21 and 10h GMT+1

--- 帖子 #207 ---
I don't think you understand. The delay prevents multiple orders from opening within 6 hours (or whatever your delay is set to) on the SAME PAIR.

Scott

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Scott, I do understand for the same pair...f.i. EURCAD trades opened today at 10h and 14h...

HT jdva

--- 帖子 #209 ---
The time delay is per pair.  So you could still get multiple trades open within your trade delay parameter of 6 hours, but it should be for different pairs and not the same pair.   Thanks!

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Hi Norm, let us know how it works, it should close all open trades for that pair, once a valid trade signal is determined.

--- 帖子 #211 ---

Erebus could you post the setting you are using to get the results you are getting for this EA

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Hi Scott, TCO

I'm trading 20 pairs, now I have set the option CloseAfterPctProfit to 10% on one pair AUDUSD and immediately the EA closed all 20 positions for that profit of 10%...is that okay so!

Thank you, jdva

--- 帖子 #219 ---
If you had profits of 10% of account balance for all open trades, then yes it would close them all.  Is that what you were asking about?

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Yes, TCO, that was my question...I understand 10% of balance not of equity, thanks!

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Yes, it uses balance. You can't use equity because you would never reach it. It would be a moving target.

Scott

--- 帖子 #222 ---
Hello, thanks for answer TCO ;-)

Yes, i've got some question,  i can't find any infomation about tp/sl etc.

This is for daily char or meaby h1/h4 etc.?

--- 帖子 #223 ---
of course...thx, Scott!

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Not sure what you are asking.  Did you read post 1 and the thread?  about what chart to put it on.  You can use TP and SL as you normally would.  If you use ATR TP and ATR SL, those will override the TP and SL.  Good luck.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #225 ---
I have mine set to 6 and have seen it open positions on the same pair less than 6 hours apart.

--- 帖子 #233 ---
just for yours info
OrderDelay = *

doesn't count minutes

I have noticed that too..but should not be a big issue...IMO

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Erebus, obviously I'm not smart enough to find that tool you are using...perhaps you may pm me...?

thx in advance, jdva

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Did you enter all 3 words into Google?

--- 帖子 #237 ---
This shows that the "CloseAfterPctProfit" function doesn't work properly. Because in your settings the bot is instructed to close out everything when 3% profit is reached and you have currently 10% open. Strange.

Hi,

anyone has made any reliable backtests with this Ea and if yes what set was used?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Hi Nbelchior, I did some back testing for the 3 different trend methods on all pairs.   I didn't use tick data, I used shift+home key to get all the daily and hourly bars I could from my broker.  It was not lock tight accurate, but it gives you enough of an idea on how the EA works for the given methods.   Especially if you make the template the tester.tpl and watch it on visual back testing.  Then you can make sure the EA handles, lot sizing, TP, SL and the other trade management features like it should on a consistent basis and takes the trades it should based on the strategies.  Some things that I have learned over the years.  If the EA isn't profitable in back testing, it is probably likely it won't be profitable in forward testing, not always the case, but usually.  Also, if the EA is profitable in back testing, it is not a guarantee that it will profitable in forward testing.  If you visit 100PipsADay's two threads that are listed on post 1, you can tell the methods are rock solid and seem to have long term viability - they are robust.  They work for multiple pairs over a sufficient amount of time.  I think the EA's on those threads are profitable, I think this EA will be profitable.  It is just a matter of identifying the bugs, making sure the EA operates consistently 99% of the time and all the features work.  No EA is set and forget.  You have to monitor what trades are taken daily to insure the EA is operating like it should.    I know this is more info than you asked for.   But there it is.    Thanks - TCO

Ah did you mean to post to this thread?  Not sure what you are trying to do.  For this these strategies to be successful, I would put the EA on more pairs.  The pairs that I would AVOID, just my personal preference, are EURCAD, GBPCAD, GBPCHF and NZDCHF   I'm sure other traders here have different thoughts on what pairs to use.

Thanks!

Hi Erebus,

its a very good setup you started with Trading. Congratulations!

How do you select the pairs to start the EA ?

All the mentioned Pairs at once, or do you select specific pairs to a specific time to start with, to avoid DD right away (e.g. in case of reversal) ?

Erebus, nice results... what was your starting capital with the demo? Or am I missing that in the screenshot you provided?

Thanks TCO  for all you do!

Are you trading 1 cent pips on a mini account or 10 cent pips on a standard account?

Hi fxarcher,  my real account is .01 per pip. So I trade my demos that way also.

Hi TCO,

I find a difference in the parameters you posted as 'EA Instructions', in post No.1 and post No.247. The parameter, extern int shift =1 is missing in the parameters given in post 247. Are you using a different version of the TCO EA than the one given in Post #1?

Post #1

Use_Ichimoku_Trend = true

extern int    tenkan_sen = 9;

extern int    kijun_sen = 26;

extern int    senkou_span = 52;
extern int     shift = 1;

KijunSenSL = true;

________________________

Post# 247

Use_Ichimoku_Trend = true;

tenkan_sen = 9;

kijun_sen = 26;

senkou_span = 52;

KijunSenSL = true;

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Hi Roy, I believe the shift is now an internal variable and no longer selected by the trader, because it is determined by CheckOncePerBar variable.  If CheckOncePerBar = true; then shift is set to 1, if CheckOncePerBar = false then shift is set to 0.   Sorry for the confusion.  I'm not in front of my trading PC at the moment so I'm not sure, but I'm almost sure it isn't in the external parms anymore.

--- 帖子 #260 ---
TCO Thanks for the reply.

Not to put to fine a point on it, but I still do not get if it is .01 of a standard account, which would be 10 cents per pip or .01 of a mini account which would be 1 cent per pip.

My guess that on a small account as you are describing you are trading at 1 cent per pip given the volatility of this EA. You probably mean $.01, is that correct?

Sorry for the bother

TCO - what pair(s) did you use for the Ichimoku strategy to net the posted result?

--- 帖子 #263 ---
I know you didn't ask me, but that is what I am doing, fxarcher. Pips are a penny apiece on my mini account. Trading .01 per $1,000 in the account. Very satisfied with the return achieved so far with that setting.

Just running it on all pairs to test out the operation of the EA.

Yes, it is still going good, a little under on the open trades right now, but has booked 23% profit, can't complain.

It is still the original EA before the latest upgrade, running on my VPS, I will makes changes on the weekend

maybe start another demo with the actual pairs recommended by 100_pips

hi TCO...

thanks for all your effort to make a profitable EA..

just one request

can you add a little arrow to indicate Daily trend and OB/OS WPR, as in 100pip EA..

i think can be useful for those who like take trades manually..

thanks.

Hi TCO,

i use for my account 90K the setup "lotsize calulation 10000 / 0.03."

I get different lotzises 0.24 and 0.27 (the one with 0.18 Lot is a manual trade).

Is there a question there?

What is your base currency?

The NZD is less than the AUD so yes, the position will be larger to maintain same risk

Super Simple Stuff really

On Edit: I am thinking you are using the Dynamic Lot Size to calculate the trade size, if you are using fixed size, please dis-regard my remarks

I have no idea whats going on here. The long and short of it is that I get no Stop loss and Take profit when I set the EA to your set as in your post 226.

I get an error message 141 (To many requests) Any ideas?

fxarcher

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Hi Erebus
Thanks for sharing your set file and the info in post 226.
I am trying to translate the unbelievable large swings (10 000 pips +or -) into a workable strategy that could be used on a small live account after some more testing.
I thought I would limit the number of entries per pair to 2 and extend the in between hours to 12. I am  also trying the Dynamic lot sizing for the first time.
I am running your identical set file on a FXCM Demo and got some trades shortly after of which only the 2nd trade placed the SL/TP.
I entered the SL/TP on the first trade manually and as you can see that on every subsequent trade the EA took did not place a SL/TP while giving me a POP UP error message #141.
I originally had the same problem without the error message on Khaled's Third Screen Strategy- D1 MACD Ea.
I wonder of anyone else has this problem.
Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
The large swings are the market of last few days, some pairs had at least double the ADR, well, it wouldn't be an average if there were not big days & small days range!

Those errors could depend on how you start the EA up; What I do is ensure there is enough data or price history for the indicator to read from. I start with 1 pair only, disable Auto Scroll, click Zoom Out to the max, then hold the Home key to load data on 1 hour time frame, when that stops, switch to Daily and same again.

Only then do I put the indicators on, get the chart the way I want it, check if there may be any chance of trade signal due to where price is (maybe W%R) only then do I put the EA on and enable it.

Once that is stable, saved the Template, open another pair, refresh the history as before, all looks good, apply the Template and so on.

If it is only when you first started up, that's my best guess, but if it is continuing problem then must be an EA programming fault perhaps.

Hi Prozor, I get this error a lot with Ichimoku, it is try to reset SL based on the Kijun-Sen Line,  I think is working most of the time, but sometimes not.  I have to look into this in backtesting and visuall mode and see what is wrong.  Just keep an eye on your SL for  now.  Make sure it is where it should be.   Thanks!

--- 帖子 #285 ---
Hi Jazny,  I can look into this.  I have never done that kind of display before on the screen.  Khaled only allows the exe file to be used. So I can't see how it does it.  It won't be a top priority,but a nice to have.   Thanks!

Hi Prozor, nice suggestions.  I do want to beef up the display screen, showing more of the trade settings.  Like trend method used, lot size method used, TP and SL methods used,  time delay and max trades allow. So at a glance the trader can confirm the EA has the correct settings.   Thanks for the suggestions.   Hopefully in the next release that I'm working on, we can add this.  TCO

Hi Armyda,

I googled it.....

If you are using "every tick mode", it looks at lower timeframes and generates a pseudo tick file.

In this case, the volume numbers on the lower timeframe, when added up, don't match the volume numbers

of the higher timeframe.

Thank you

Close on opposite signal.  I understand what the opposite signal would be for MacD, but for the EMA and Ichimoku is it just when the EMA's or Trend line cross the other direction?

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Even though your attached settings show close after profit percent disabled, that sure is what it looks like. The total profit for the closed trades is about $98, which is right at 3% of what your balance would have been previously. Bear in mind that if the close after profit pct is enabled on ANY of the pairs the EA is running on, it will close ALL trades.

DEMO ACCOUNT REPORT

$100,000 Account opened June 5, 2013 - first traded same day, so 8 days results

All statistics available in Trade Explorer, click on Trade Report and see much of what is here & more

Summary: Profit +$20,000 - Open trades +$8,500

Closed trades 157

Win Ratio 73% - using break even +10 pips so not sure if this is skewing the win ratio, any Quants reading?

Take Profit / Stop Loss is 1 ADR or ATR of Daily price data : RISK is 1% and Max of 2 trades per pair

My logic behind this is that the W%R catches retracement entries perfectly on the 1 hour chart, trend resumes, take the money & run

Example shown below was the largest winning trade so far, by dollar value, not pips, due to the Dynamic Lot Size option

And there is current open trade on that chart, you can see the entry, break even +10 and take profit line

Also show, the ADR projected High & Low from current Low & High, I will attach the Indicator for you

But with great power comes great responsibility - use it wisely

This is a pair that the Third Screen Strategy does not recommend; I take a portfolio view

Bit like the shotgun view, got to hit something, if your trading is better, not need to be reading here

If not, something to consider using, I may try to tweak say Take Profit at 1.1 of ADR and Stop Loss to 0.9 of ADR

Have a great week end everybody, all the best for next week folks,

E.

Hi All

A quick question on the TCO EA, it may have been answered already - don't think so though.

If I am using the 4 hour as my anchor chart - trend, and 60 minute to take trades off using the TCO EA.  I am wanting to use the Ichimoku as my trend indicator, does the EA know to use the 4hour Ichimoku as the trend or does it use the 60 min to determine the trend and trade.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #303 ---
TCO,

Thank you very much for your contribution to the Third Screen strategy. I wish you great success in your trading. I actually found this thread through Erebus and I thank Erebus for pointing in the right direction.

One question I have within your EA is that when we set WPR confirmation to false, does that mean position will be opened as soon as WPR levels have hit even if the current bar is not yet closed and WPR may in fact retrace back from OB/OS levels? Or does the bar on the hourly first must close and WPR closes inside OB/OS levels. Hope I make sense.

Also I would like to make a request on your next upgrade to the EA, if you could kindly add stochastics as an alternative choice to WPR. It is recommended by Dr Elder that stochastics can be used as a screen in replacement of WPR for conservative traders. I've been using stochastics instead of WPR with much success in my trading of Dr. Elder's system. IMO, it provided a better representation of PA movement then WPR, as you know WPR tends to stretch quite a bit and often times touches WPR levels and retract before the candle close triggering a trade, only to continue further on the next candle thus placing that opened position straight away into DD. I hope I make sense. I've been using stoch settings 14,3,3.

Thank you once again.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
I think it may be safe to assume you didn't take the time to open and read the instructions that accompanied the EA on the first post. I'll answer it for you since I actually took the time this morning to read through the thread and the instructions on the EA.

You need to set the trend TF to 240 and 60 for the lower TF. Set Ichimoku to true for trend and turn MACD and EMA trends to false.

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Thanks MXFXTrader for handling the questions.  I know it is confusing.  In the update that I'm working on ..I'm trying to make the trend method selection easier, we will see.

I also want to make the screen display better and improve the instructions doc also.  Just takes time.   Thanks!

--- 帖子 #306 ---
HI MKFX,

Close Bar Mode - Looks for trade opportunities when the Lower TF bar has just closed (Less resource intensive when you have many charts or mt4 apps open)

if you set CheckOncePerBar = true & WPR_Confirmation = false, the trade will be taken when bar closes and the WPR is below the OS or above the OB.

if you set CheckOncePerBar = true & WPR_Confirmation = true, the trade will be taken when previous to last bar closed while the WPR is below the OS or above the OB and the current bar closes and the WPR is above the OS or below the OB.

Tick Mode - Looks for trades opportunities on every tick (More resource intensive, performs all calculations on every price change)

if you set CheckOncePerBar = false & WPR_Confirmation = false, will take the trade as soon as WPR dips above the OB or below the OS.

if you set CheckOncePerBar = false & WPR_Confirmation = true, will wait for the dip to come back before taking trade.

I hope this makes sense. Kind of hard to explain. But there is it is.

As far as stochastics, it wouldn't  be hard to add the code, just adds more complexity, more confusion with external parms.  When Erebus listed all the external parms in an earlier post.  I was thinking.....this looks complicated.  Would I even want to trade this EA and have to make all these decisions.  That is why I''m trying to make the parameters easier and cleaner.....and why I need to make the instructions better.  I will think about the addition.  It wouldn't be hard to mock up a quick and dirty to use stoch instead of WPR and see if there is much difference in backtesting results

Thanks for the suggestions.  We will add it to the list of possible added complexities.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
Hi Erebus, it looks like you are on top of your game with what you want to do as far as making these strats work for you.  Very impressive.  I'm sure we all appreciate and look forward to more of your guidance.  Thanks!

It must be the Basket option, it closes the trades once profit reaches a certain percentage. I changed mine to 10% ,default was 3%

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Question on Dynamic Lot Size.

If it is set to 1% of equity then the EA has to base the lot size on the SL that is specified. Correct?

If the SL is 500 pips and the equity is $1,000 then no trade would be opened. The minimum lot size is .01 lot. That would be a risk of $50 which exceeds 1% of $1,000. Am I on the right track?

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Thanks TCO for the reply.

Just want to confirm that for close bar mode(cpu friendly) - Set "check once per bar" = True.  When it is set to false then it becomes Tick mode(heavy cpu uasge)? I was just wondering because I didn't see the option for "close bar mode" you described in the first sentence.

Thank you for considering the addition of stochastics. Like I've mentioned, I've been trading the system with the use of stochs and I find it much smoother then WPR, as it actually gives better representation of when PA is OB/OS. The setting I use is 14,3,3. Thanks for considering it.

Also, any way you can add an Arrow to the top right of the EA that shows the direction of the daily trend, similar to what khaled did on his EA? I know his EA is in ex4 format so I have no idea what code is used for that to take place. Maybe we can send him a pm and ask. You may already indeed have something in the works that is similar.

Anyways, Thanks you once again for your contribution to the Third Screen Strategy and the FX community. I'd give you a vouch but I'm not authorized to do so yet, being new to FF.

MKFX and TCO

Thanks for your reply,

Another question I have to you and others, who may know the answer,  if using the 20/50 ema as the trend indicator does the EA wait for the cross of these 2 ema's to determine long or short? or like the manual method that 100pipsaday uses, one waits for price to be above/below these ema's to go short/long immaterial of ema cross??

Thanks

I told myself to stop posting on this forum but I will answer you. WORK IT OUT YOURSELF.

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Dear Erebus and all people here (starting from TCO, very nice EA, indeed! Clear coding, easy to trace...),

congratulations for your results, and best wishes that this will go on.

Being used to verify and self-test things, I have a question open. Looking in your trades in Trade Explorer I find something that I cannot easily reconcile with your "break even + pips" statement above, at least without further explanation. My interpretation, so far, is that you change the stop loss to breakeven (=entry price) as soon as trade reaches +10 pips of profit (correct me if I am wrong).

If therefore this is true, looking at many of your Trade Explorer past trades (and I did it because your results were much better than my backtests) looks quite strange. I just paste one here:

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

So: if math is no opinion, this trade for instance had to be closed at breakeven much earlier than when it was closed (for a good profit). How/why?

Please understand this applies to a lot of your recorded trades, this one is just one example. Can you please explain which are your precise settings about this issue, or where I am misunderstanding? Eventually: would it be possible for you to post the complete .set file so we have a common starting point for backtesting and optimization?

Win ratio of course is very high if you include all the BE trades, of course this reflects to a R/R lower than 1:1, if your SL = TP at +/- 1 x daily ATR.

From the few, very initial, to be much further verified first backtests on my side, anyway, the system "as is" would show a PF of 1.2-1.5. Not bad at all for being the initial testing round w/o further optimization.

Best regards

BL

Thanks,

sorry for asking.

Jumping here and there between three threads is not always easy. Sorry and good luck to all!

BL

EDIT: now the question concerning the win rate is still more open.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
It would be good to put an option to take trades based on profit distance in pips and not in Time delays. it doesn't really make sense adding 5 or 7 positions 10 pips apart and this is because it won't matter how you set the "Order Delay" setting. The break out can happens now, 6 hours, or 2 days apart. I think a 50 pips distance condition should be ok before looking again at the Overbought oversold condition.

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Hi TCO and all,

Should i set a specific magic for each pair?

Best regards

PT

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Simple, as per my settings shown, Break Even is set for +10 pips not at Break Even=0, and must have in Profit of 60 pips before that is triggered

I could leave Break Even=0 and the reporting software would report as BE trade, but instead it is a Profit trade; this is why I mentioned that fact

I could get a lot of BE +10 pips trades as winners, Win Ratio is high but profit per trade, not so much

It is up to you how you want to trade in real account

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Erebus: hi!

On your settings  (post#226), under discretionary settings, shows GoLong=False; GoShort=False.

In this last image, it showing , direction=Sell (AUDNZD).

As TCO explained earlier, when EA trades with discretionary trend settings like shown here (AUDNZD), EA overrides long trend settings (1440 trend), right.

My confusion is , whether these results obtained are based on discretionary trend settings or other way.

Have a nice weekend!

Regards,

rswamy

--- 帖子 #324 ---
You are confused? Mate, you have me confused !!!

AUD-NZD is a SELL - is it not? by the 20 / 50 rules!

ALL the trades shown in the Trade Explorer or any report I have published are taken strictly by the EA running by itself on a VPS.

And take note - it is the original TCO Multi Strategy EA which did not have those settings of GoLong / GoShort

The image I posted was taken from local computer using the new EA, I was just sharing the settings in use

I am in the process of moving the account to another VPS, so I will update to the current EA = TCO_Trader

And maybe tweak a few settings, gotta love Dropbox, so easy to move files to New York!

PS: still trying to understand why you asked this question, reviewed my images - is it because of the top image where the Sell is ticked?

That is only from the reporting software and nothing to do with EA settings - hope that is it, can't see any other reason, no discretionary setting has been used, and if I wanted too, I would certainly set it for sell anyway

--- 帖子 #325 ---
Hallo friends,

Erebus, thank you so much for the kind reply although mine was a dumb question.

Now, just going on with preliminary analysis. And, surely, not to rain on your parade, but, you know what happens with your set on long-time testing, isn't it?

In spite of that I think the tool is really promising, and I will work (on my own) on it for quite a long, I think. I cannot ensure any timeline ...cause I'm a quite busy man and often travelling for the job (so few time for sitting down and programming). But, if I manage, I will try to contribute.

I need first of all of modifying something in the script (e.g.: ATR multipliers for both SL and TP are integers in the moment, and this is bad for what I have in mind...).

P.S.: all the tests were performed on high-quality Alpari Data Sets with every tick precision. There is just a duplicate EURUSD made with control points, because for optimization the every tick is unfeasible. You might see that, even if the precise numbers are different, the overall picture is maintained in the control points simulation.

It doesn't seem to make sense till all your positions zoom to 3 X ATR profit and you cash in.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
No, you can use the same magic number for every pair for the same EA.  If you have a different EA on the account (not recommended), then you use a different magic number.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
1000 * 0.01 = $10.00

$10.00 is maximum loss per trade.

SL = 500pips

10.00 max loss per trade/ 500 pips = 0.02 lotsize

--- 帖子 #330 ---
.01 lot = 10 cents per pip.

500 SL = $50

.02 lot - $100

If I had it set for 1% risk on $1,000 equity, I assume neither trade would be taken.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
Hmmmm, doesn't look good does it?

But that is only for 1 pair, I don't think the back tester is yet available that could run 20+ pairs simultaneously as a portfolio?

Yes, I set up the TCO Trader EA and I discover I can only set the ATR Take Profit as whole number - if TCO is reading this, is it much of a problem to change that to allow a single decimal place for calculation?

So, I could use 1.1 * ATR for Take Profit and 0.9 * ATR for Stop Loss

It is only math and programming, must be possible

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Hallo friends,

Erebus: surely changing the ATR multiplier from int to double is easily done. Let's see who will manage to do it before. (If this would be me: I'll immediately post, but cannot promise).

No... it doesn't look good, you're right. And no, there is not (and will never be, I fear) a possibility of backtesting multiple pairs on MT4 (and MT5 has been so badly developed by Metaquoters that backtesting doesn't make sense there because you cannot feed the system with good quality data but just use what they give you, i.e. very bad data series).

But there are around possibilities of bypasing this problem, which for instance rely on sql databases storing several tests performed via MT4 on single pairs and then generating the result you would have had by running all of them at the same time. I belong to a fee-based community having and developing such systems (just goolge forex mechanical and you'll see...).

Nevertheless there is no much hope that, if you put together the three pairs I was (just as a start point) looking at you'll come out with a profitable portfolio, so far.

Please, don't be discouraged. But think that your last ten days were quite a "spike" in the probabilistic up and downs of a system performance. So, be just careful.

The most striking effect of your live test is that you had a very consistent edge in reaching those "damned" 60 pips before touching the stop loss, and this is very promising. My idea (and more to come) is to:

1. Change that hard number of pips before trailing at breakeven in something adaptive (= relying on market changing dynamics), i.e. just making it dependent on ATR

2. Having the possibility of fine tuning the SL & TP levels as said.

3. With those in place, systematically measure the accuracy of the system at different levels of R/R (and fortunately those are already adapting, because depend on the ATR)

And then see the captured edge, how much it is, how stable it is across time and currencies (stable = statistics... non parametric tests and hypothesis testing...), eventually use conditional probability or add advanced trailing mechanisms (hint: not only trailing stop, but also trailing take profit...).

Just a question of couple of months, actually...  The whole requires writing and re-writing the EA one or more times for getting a non-trading, but data output and analysis version.

But this is how systems require to be developed, probably.

Your efforts here are very nice and appreciated! There comes anyway than a time in which number cruncing and lonely sweat becomes more necessary than lot of discussions...

When I manage, if I manage, I'll keep you updated.

Bye

I understand your explanation very well. Just want to clarify the tick mode. If we set it up as tick mode with check once per bar to false and we set WPR confirm to True. What is the behaviour of the EA? Does the previous bar need to close inside OB/OS zone FIRST b4 the current candle that exits OB/OS levels triggers the trade? Just want to clarify/confirm.

Also there shouldn't be any problem with the EA if we change OB/OS levels instead of keeping the default -80 and -20? Correct?

Thanks again TCO

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Hi MkFX, yes the previous bar will have close above the OB or below the OS.  You can set the OB and OS levels to anything you like, that is why I made them parameters.  Thanks!

Hi billbss,

1000 * 0.01 = $10 is equivalent to

1000 * 1% = $10

0.01 in this case refers to your 1% of risk nor to 0.01 lots.

with regards,

Maudur

--- 帖子 #336 ---
I can't get an answer that I understand.

Let me put it another way:

If I have set the EA for DynamicLotSize = true

EquityPercent= 1.0

My SL is set to 500 pips.

My equity is $1,000

An entrance signal appears. What will the EA do?

Notice that I stand to lose $50 on this trade.

--- 帖子 #337 ---
Here is the actual calculation in the EA, if the dynamic lot sizing is selected and you have a SL

double RiskAmount = AccountEquity() * (argEquityPercent / 100);

double TickValue = MarketInfo(Symbol(),MODE_TICKVALUE);

if(Point == 0.001 || Point == 0.00001) TickValue *= 10;

double LotSize = (RiskAmount / argStopLoss) / TickValue;

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Thanks TCO. Fully understand now.  Have a wonderful Sunday.

--- 帖子 #339 ---
Just my 2 cents, Set the TP to 3000 or higher and use the jumping stop as the exit (TP) will improve the RR significantly.

--- 帖子 #340 ---
Dear TCO,

thank you very much for your nice work here.

I would like to give a little contribution by pasting here a slightly modified version of the program (TCO_Trader_BL1_0) that you can use and peruse (even changing name) as you prefer. I am grateful to everybody if the Copy-left notice will be preserved, and again there is no stupid one around trying to sell it on ebay...

The only little variations I have introduced are reported in the versioning heading, but here the highlights:now it is possible to set the ATR_TP_Mult and the ATR_SL_Mult also to fractional numbers; I added a feature to the Break Even protection device, so that now it is possible to chose whether to specify a hard pips number when to shift the stop loss at breakeven, or a fraction of the (long TF) ATR. Please: not BOTH, but EITHER (read the code and look at the badly ringing alerts if you try to set both!). Of course it doesn't make any sense placing here a multiplier of ATR equal or bigger than the above mentioned ATR_TP_Mult, but this is just good sense, and will produce no harm to your trading account. To everybody!

PLEASE CONSIDER THAT I HAD VERY LIMITED TIME TO TEST THESE FEATURES. I can only say that „under normal conditions“ they seem to work. Use at your sole own risk! I decline any responsibility. (I.e.: just demo, demo and again demo!)

I have anyway some specific questions, for you TCO, about your code.

Rows 151-157, CheckOncePerBar true test:
Inserted Code if(CheckOncePerBar == true)
{
Check_New_Bar();
shift = 1;
double BidPrice = iClose(Symbol(), Lower_TF, shift);
double AskPrice = iClose(Symbol(), Lower_TF, shift); //why the hell? BL
}
Why do you set Bid and Ask equal to Close in case of bar-wise operation?

Row 260, within the BuySignal == true management routine (but is it true in the SellSignal, below), after closing (eventually) orders in the other direction and managed the max total amount of orders allowed:

Inserted Code UsePoint = PipPoint(Symbol());

Why do you repeat it here after having made it already in the init?

CloseAllTrades() function, row 1110-1113,

Inserted Code if(result == false)
{
Sleep(0); //why the hell? BL
}
Which is the meaning of this Sleep(0) statement here? [Sorry for the „hell“, but it is useful for finding comments with my SciTe search function].

Is there a specific reason why you define the

Inserted Code LastOrderTime(...)

function as an int and not a datetime?

Last question, and this is more about trading philosophy. In your code

Inserted Code // Place Buy Order
int Ticket = OrderSend(argSymbol,OP_BUY,argLotSize,MarketInfo(argSymbol,MODE_ASK),
argSlippage,0,0,argComment,argMagicNumber,0,Green);

… orders are always taken at market.

Now, as you know, I get lost pretty easily in long and multiple forum threads. But, as far as I know, one of the tenets of Mr. Elder's triple screen, is that, exactly, after having looked at the long and the intermediate time frames, you get trades in the short based on „momentum“, and what he explains is that you achieve this third screen by placing pending orders some pips above/below the signal bar extreme. So: where did this third screen get lost in this long community-discussion? Unfortunately implementing this feature in your script would require from my side much more work than I can afford now, and probably I would prefer making it by introducing some more relevant architectural modifications to your code, just because of different „coding styles“, you know. But definitely, I think this is a quite serious/relevant feature missing.

I will be so happy in learning something more from you, or eventually to help digging out some minor issues to be improved.

All the best BL

EDIT: EA removed as per OP request.

TCO: if you will be so nice and reply to the questions I am very thankful.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
BetterLife, I appreciate your looking at the code and looking for issues and bugs.  I don't appreciate you posting another EA version.  My new update will be handling  the ATR multiplier as defined as double and not int.   This will be released with the next EA update along with other fixes and improvements.  Please remove your EA so that we don't get a bunch of versions of different EAs.  Then we have to start answering support questions about this EA or that EA.  This thread is dedicated to the EA I created.  Please list and issues or bugs and possible code improvements or strategy improvements in the thread or by PMing me.

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #342 ---
I am very sorry for this misunderstanding.

I remove immediately the EA.

If you didn't manage to download it and you want to have a look, let me know how I can send it to you.

I just wanted to be useful, no other intention.

Bye

BL

--- 帖子 #343 ---
Thanks BetterLife,  I appreciate your cooperation and understanding in keeping an organized thread.

As far as the issues that you brought up, must of them are just cut and paste things from previous EAs or other code.  So they are not an issue and don't pose an issue with how the EA actually trades.

The Code here

if(CheckOncePerBar == true)

{

Check_New_Bar();

shift = 1;

double BidPrice = iClose(Symbol(), Lower_TF, shift);

double AskPrice = iClose(Symbol(), Lower_TF, shift); //why the hell? BL

}

Was done so we could use the same variables for either Bar Mode or Tick Mode.

If we are using bar mode, we really only car of the last bar's close was above/below the EMAs or above/below the Kijun and Tenkan Sens, for tick mode we are checking if bid or ask are above or below.  That was my way of making the coding in the main trade logic section easier to handle.

--- 帖子 #344 ---
Hi All

Could some answer the following related to the EA see below setting explanation from the txt document explaining the EA;

CloseAfterPctProfit=true;                - If set to true, EA will close all orders after certain profit percentage reached

ProfitPct  =3.0;                         - Percentage profit to reach before closing all ordersDoes the above mean that the EA will close all open orders on the MT4 paltform regardless of open orders that have not been opened by the EA? Or will it close orders pair specific e.g. the pair that the EA is loaded to, if loaded to eurusd the EA will close if profit is 3% on the eurusd pair? What is the 3% based on equity or balance? Thanks

--- 帖子 #345 ---
1) It does not close pending orders, just actual executed orders.

2) It closes orders from ALL pairs, not just the pair on which you have the settings attached.

3) The percentage is based on balance, not equity.

Thanks for the reply, this will help

--- 帖子 #347 ---
In the settings display located top left, even though I have TP and SL set to true using ATR levels, it still shows default hard 250 SL and 350 TP. Is this normal?

Would also just like to reiterate my request for an arrow showing us the higher TF trend on the top right corner of the screen under the smiley face, so we don't have to flip chart to remember the main trend direction. Something similar to Khaled's EA. Not necessary to have both the higher and lower TF arrows like he has. Just need the higher TF arrow only.

Thank you once again to TCO. I'm running the EA this week.

GL this week, and happy trading everyone.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #348 ---
And it close all orders regardless magic numbers. It is for all open orders not only for open order by this EA.

with regards,

Maudur

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Exactly. The code would need to be amended to have it only close out orders for this EA.

TurtleFan

--- 帖子 #350 ---
If it does, can it have the option to close by magic number or close all, I actually like the basket strategy.

--- 帖子 #351 ---
In the meantime you can use a MTF Macd Indi on H1 Chart.

- Green or Red - Lines below the blue line is Trend Short,

- Green or Red - Lines above the blue line is Trend Long

Cheers

Tebis

--- 帖子 #352 ---
I have made a change in the coming updated EA that will close all orders using magic number.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #353 ---
I've only been exposed to EA's last few weeks as I've been a manual trader throughout my trading experience, so can someone tell me what magic number means? What is it's purpose? I like things the way they are now except for what I have requested with the next update.

Thank you.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Hi MKFX, a magic number is just another identifier for a trade.  Usually the  EA will confirm the pair (symbol) and the magic number to make sure it is opening and managing the correct trades for that EA.  If you have another EA operating on your account,  you want to set the magic number differently for that EA, so that both EAs would be able manage their own trades for each symbol.

So if I wanted to use 2 EAs on an account and I open a EURUSD chart for EA1, I might make the magic number 00001 and then if I opened another EURUSD chart for EA2, I would make that magic number maybe 00002.  So EA1 will manage all EURUSD trades with a magic number of 00001 and EA2 will manage all EURUSD trades with a magic number of 00002.

I usually don't operate more than 1 EA on one account, so I just sent my magic number to 00000 for each account.

I hope that helps.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Hi TCO,

I'm very happy with your EA and I explicitly appreciate your efforts for making it still better....!

I have a suggestion on the CloseTradesOnOppositeSignal option. If set to true it should require two consecutive closes above/below trend indicator in order to take actions. But I dont know whether this is difficult to code therefore forgive me if it does too much work for you.

The reason for that request was a loss of several hundred pips on JPY crosses on June10th as market just looks for one day above EMAtrend and then reverses again the next day below trend.

Many thanks and stay tuned...

Happy trading, jdva

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Thank YOU for your continued work, TCO. Much appreciated.

TurtleFan

--- 帖子 #357 ---
Hi jdva, thanks for the suggestion.  One thing to remember when you add more complexity to the EA trying to avoid losses - a lot of times you miss out on trade opportunities that may have been more profitable. if we wait and  require two consecutive closes above/below trend indicator in order to CloseTradesOnOppositeSignals we may never get the second signal and we may miss out on the huge trend move going the other way.  With trading we are going to have losses.  We just need to make sure our profit runs are greater than our loss runs. It is the nature of the beast.  We will have drawdown, we will have some whipsaws.  We need to take a look at the big picture. Are we just having a brief run of whipsaws before another big move.  Or does the pair whipsaw all the time.  Do we want to add complexity to the EA where the juice may not even be worth the squeeze.  Do you see what I'm saying?

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Yes, TCO, I do understand you and of course you should be right.....and make the EA managing trades on K.I.S.S.!

--- 帖子 #359 ---
I'm wondering why on one of my platform, the settings that is displayed on the top left of charts has TP/SL set at a fixed number when I have ATR turned on both. The open position reflect the ATR SL/TP parameters but the setting displayed is all the same 250 SL/350 TP. Doesn't do that on my other broker. Must it be the broker feed?

ADD: My other broker displays GBP/USD TP/SL not according to ATR settings. It's also fixed at 250/350. All the other pairs are ok with this broker except G/U. Strange. Any idea?

ADD: Just did a test on the broker that had only one pair(G/U) displayed wrong by restarting MT4, now all pairs show 250SL and 350TP within the display settings top left of chart. Open positions are fine and has SL/TP based on ATR settings.

TCO,

Receiving Error 4109- Open sell order. Error 4109: trade is not allowed in the expert properties. Going off like a pinball machine.

Charts set up on tick mode with WPR confirm set to true.

Edit: Pinball alert sound went away when I changed tick mode to "candle close mode". Left WPR confirm set to true.

Sorry for all the questions but I want to try and eliminate any potential errors.

TCO, I was running demo today with KijunSenSL = true and got the following error message.

Hi MKFX. the display isn't working. In the upcoming upgrade.  The display will be improved.  Thanks.

Hi EZ,  I have seen that bugger.  The EA appears to be moving the SL correctly with the KijunSenSL.  I'm going to turn the alert off in the update.  Thanks!

Hello everyone....

On the EA I got an error on one pair " Add Stop/Profit-Error 128: trade timeout

also I am using the same set file and one of the trades it shows the tp/sl and on the other it does not show anything.....

Any idea what this could be....thanks

Brokers are known to re-boot their servers on a daily basis, maybe you caught that just when it was happening.

Unless it keeps giving error on continual basis, probably not much to worry about

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Hi MKFX, I believe that error comes from trying to hedge.  Opening a buy when you already have a sell trade open or vice versa.  The is error should be fixed in the next update.   Thanks!

I am new here. Nice to join and be able to contribute.

Thanks to all for your work, and specially to the creator of the EA!

I have made a portfolio with Erebus settings (thanks to you) and am demotesting since yesterday.

All is going normal but I got this morning an alert:

2013.06.18 08:59:57 '555023': order buy 0.03 GBPNZD opening at 0.00000 sl: 0.00000 tp: 0.00000 failed [Not enough money]

In fact, the margin level was at this time above 3.000%, so no problem with margin.

After this alert, other pairs opened several positions without any further problem.

Take this only as a report.

My broker is ActivTrades (demoserver), 1:400.

--- 帖子 #379 ---
Great news TCO!  Would you say that the new updated EA can replace the last version on charts with open trades - in other words will it carry on trading my demo that is currently being traded by the previous version correctly, given the settings are the same?

Also, regarding my previous thoughts about a weekly filter which really is the third screen - please check this post, if it can be coded it may be something to look into:  http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...79#post6760079

Thx

Thank you for your selfless generosity, and contribution in helping your fellow brethren.  May GOD bless you and your family abundantly.

Hi Telac,

The EA should pick up where it left off.  Please verify all the settings.  The way of selecting the trend method has changed.  So if you are using MACD you would enter a 3(three).  Thanks.

Trend_Method = 1       <- - Select 1 of the 6 trend methods.   Ichimoku is currently selected.

1. Ichimoku Only

2. 20/50 EMA Only

3. MACD Only

4. Ichi & EMA & MACD

5. GoLong Only

6. GoShort Only

I can add the weekly filter to the MACD strategy on the next update.

--- 帖子 #382 ---
What you are posting there with this link IS NOT a desription of Dr. Alexander Elder's third screen strategy. That particular poster has come up with his own trading system and IS NOT Dr. Elder's system in which he describes. I suggest you read his book, or at least the first post on 100pips "third screen strategy thread". If you want to trade off the weekly chart then use 10080 as your High TF and 1440 for the Short TF. The EA and 100pip's system is a variation of Dr. Elder system. It's only missing the third screen which you need to read to understand what it is. It is NOT what you have posted. There isn't a need to add a filter to the weekly EA, IMO.

I vote to K.I.S.S

I only request Stochastics as a trigger oscillator as Dr. Elder describes can be used with this system in replace of WPR.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Hi MKFX, thanks for the strategy clarification.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
MKFXTrader,

First of all let me make clear that I did not advocate the post I referenced link as part of Dr.  Elders specific system.  Dr. Elder uses various indicators to identify the components of his system.  Any set of indicators that is best able to determine the weekly trend is good.  I apologize and it was incorrect to say that we were missing the 3rd screen - it is the first screen that we are missing.  A very good nutshell overview can be found here and it is taken directly from Dr. Elders book:  Inserted Video

I understand what you are saying about the time frame choices - however, even 100pipes has made it clear in several posts that the weekly trend is important in making good trade decisions with his strategy, that is why he often posts the weekly bias.  The time when this is obviously most important is when there is a trend reversal - and this is where 100pips advocates using PASR on the weekly chart to look for possible turning points.  100piips actually took time outs trading his 20/50 strategy due to looking at longer time frames showing the possibility of a reversal.

A weekly filter would definitely be useful and I dare say 100pips would agree.  Here is a direct quote from a post he made:   " I am a firm believer in Price Action @ Support / Resistance (PASR) especially when it comes to the larger time frames e.g. weekly & monthly. This helps me to identify potential trend reversals which will then in turn help me to make better trades on the D1"

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Video not needed, as I've read the book. 100pips use of PA at SR is understandable but is NOT Dr Elder's system. Yes, Dr Elder mentioned different oscillators in his example of the second screen. His trade example in the book was also using Weekly as the trend and daily to pull the trigger using the third screen(missing in 100pips system). But Dr. Elder also says it can be used with any TF choice, as long as it is in multiples of 5 or more.

What you posted as a link was the poster's own trading strategy using various methods like RSI above..., yada, yada, ya... If you want to use the weekly as your trend then I've suggested the settings within the EA. Change the trend TF to weekly, and daily as trigger TF. You can also just manually set EA on whichever pair to trade only long or short. If you want to use the weekly searching for S&R then I think it's fair that you should do it manually. You don't need an EA to do that for you, unless you plan on writing it yourself, for I would conclude that it would be very time consuming. It's safe to say TCO has done a great job giving us what we currently have. Would you agree? Besides, as you already know by being a trader, everyone draws and recognizes S&R differently.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Fantastic new updates,  on new upgrade maybe include ability to change Comment.  That way if we are running two strategies we can tell them apart.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
MKFXTrader,

It was never my intent to pick an argument with you on Dr. Elders system - after all, everything we have here is due to 100pips and his utilization of some of the principals of that system.  TCO is working on an EA and asking us all for observations and suggestions and I have simply given mine based on what 100pips has said; and he has already graciously agreed to add a weekly filter in the next release.  Of course we can all look at the charts and make our determinations about when or when not to run the EA or to simply trade manually.  However, the very purpose of an EA is to automate and all I was trying to do was to suggest a modification that could help to improve that process.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Nor was it my intent to argue either. I was only merely pointing to the fact that a weekly filter is not needed with this system. If you feel the need to use PASR on the weekly, it would take no time to just flip to a weekly chart and mark your own S&R levels since everyone draws them differently and then run the EA. Not to mention, it would be very labor intensive and probably cpu heavy.

Cheers. Happy Trading

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Hi Alpine, this is a good suggestion.  I will added it to the next release.  Thanks!

Hi ToolCoolOne

Very good job TCO

I tried it with demo account but the problem come from when you put it on the chart for the first time  as we knew that you can put it on the chart  at a  different time with different price and the same type of order will taken so the result will changed

but at all it is very good job from you

also TCO what is the ability to let the EA deal with multi pair from one chart ?

Sorry for my language

Thank you very much

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Hi Sasco, sorry I'm not sure about the issue you are describing.

The EA is not designed as a multi-pair trader to be attached to only one chart.  It must be loaded on every chart of the pairs you want to trade.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #392 ---
I'm getting the same error now on Usd/Jpy.  Runs for the hourly bar while the trade is valid then stops.  Anyone come up with a fix yet?

Spydie,

Download the new updated EA released today.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Mine was not an EA problem. Come time find out my platform was bad and stopped everything from trading. I reinstalled it and that did not help. I had to make a new directory and reinstall ( not over previous version ).

Already have version 1.3 running.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Hi Spydey, when I look up the error, it looks like your broker is not allowing you to trade.  I haven't gotten this error.  So i'm not sure what the issue is.

Weird.    I'm using the same broker as I have running Khaled's ea and it's trading Usd/Jpy fine.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Never used EA's in my trading before last few weeks but, I didn't know brokers could prevent you from using EA's. Are they also able to see if it's an EA placing trades? Does it leave a footprint or something? Can they see how it's programed and what indie it's running? Thx

Sure Afarensis, when I get home I will put my 3 set file on here.  I also have a demo for Ichimoku and MACD, I just need to get the trade explorers set up. I have been busy getting v1.3 coded and the new instructions done and haven't done it yet.

Combine Strategies.... I really like how you have a number for each strategy. Much cleaner.  I'm wondering if it would be to restrictive to combine EMA and MACD  or Ich and EMA strategies....

I also noticed in he information screen we can select Tick or Bar method, but I did not see an option in the EA for that choice.

Gary

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Gary,

It's under the setting "Check once per bar" - Set to true for bar mode(Only check at close of candle on the lower TF) and false for tick mode.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #403 ---
Thank you. I have never trade the tick before. I'm thinking the difference is that it the price can hit the OB or OS and take a trade without waiting for the end of the 60 min bar.  Is that the difference?

Could I unselect "Check once per bar and also check WPR confirmation to true? Or would that be logical?

Just a thought.  There is a lot of concern in the Third Screen Forum and the 20/50EMA Forum about getting caught when the trend reverses.  So maybe something like this would help.

We are using Lower TF like 60 for the trigger to take the trade.  Maybe we should look at the higher TF 1440 to decide where to trade that pair at all. For instance when the 1440 is OB like maybe past -95 we should stop trading until it come back down on the other side and start shorting. When it is over sold on the 1440 TF of say -10 or lower we stop trading that pair until it came back to -20 ......

Gary,

to combine EMA and MACD would be powerfull. (I see Nanningbobs 10.4 trendtrading and 100pips MACD Trading)  Less trades but more secure.

Perhaps it is possible to code. TCO made allready an amazing product.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
I'm thinking more reliable and maybe safer to go one notch higher on the TF and get longer term trades.

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Yes. Please refer to post #306, #312, #333 and #334.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #408 ---
If you wish, you can use Weekly (10080) as your trend TF, and daily(1440) as your lower TF(trigger TF) as Dr Elder writes as an example in his book. I recommend though, reading the trading threads of the particular strategy to answer any other questions you may have pertaining to strategy. The EA also has instructions as to the settings.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Yes I do understand that.  I am also concerned with finding a way to stop trading the 1440tb is OB or OS to avoid the potential of a trend change during a trade.

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Hi Gary,

CheckOncePerBar    if set to true, you will be in bar mode, if set to false you will be in tick mode.

I thought about allowing just 2 strats to be combined for trend determination.  Maybe I will add that as a future option, it just adds more complexity and i'm not sure it is worth the squeeze.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
That will be a judgement call on your part because as you know the saying goes "there is no such thing as PA being in oversold in a downtrend, or overbought in an uptrend". That is why often times you see oscillators staying in OB/OS areas for long periods of time during those conditions. This is also why using Dr. Elder's strategy of pulling the trigger on the lower TF while using the Higher TF trend works.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #412 ---
TCO,

Do we still need to leave the chart on the lower TF(trading TF) for the EA to trigger the trade? If this is true, then is there any way you can change this at next update? I remember Khaled's EA, it didn't matter what TF you left the chart on. Thx

Cheers

--- 帖子 #413 ---
If you are tick mode, it shouldn't matter, but if you are on bar mode, you will want to keep it on the lower TF.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Hi Guys,

I posted my set files in post 1.   If you want to use them just download them and rename back to *.set for each file.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Question: What the heck are you going to do when there are conflicting signals, MACD is Green, price is under 20/5 EMA's ???

See example below

Also, you can do this now manually, use setting GoLongOnly or GoShortOnly, but time consuming as every chart has to be checked

Maybe we need another TREND qualifier? OH, wait, I have one

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Well if you select all 3 trends which is number 4 in the trend selection menu.  Then all 3 have to be in uptrend  for the EA to take a buy or all 3 have to be in a downtrend for the EA to take a sell.  So I think it will a more conservative approach.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
So basically, this is what tebis request but not quite, going to end up with 10 to 12 choices for trend determination

Anyway, update on my demo, heaps of TP hit yesterday, closed EUR-GBP manually, 3 full SL hit, marked "X" (thanks GBP )

The small TP are trailing stops hit, saved the account for sure!

Some draw down as I post, about $1,000 - click below to go to Trade Explorer, there you can see more statistics

Thanks to TCO, an awesome EA for sure

--- 帖子 #418 ---
Nicely Done - As this is more of a PASR discussion than the EA, thought I'd throw in my comments

The question on trends becomes interesting as to which you believe in.  I have always had the RSI 10 running in the background (each to their own and not suggesting this is in the EA) purely as a sanity check.  IF PA does not break and close above / below the 20EMA (2oEMA acting as a dynamic S/R) and RSI has not closed above 51 / below 49, then I view the moves as a pause with a good possibility of continuation.

MACD on day charts showing an upturn with daily candles setting a new LH / LL would never convince me to go long.  Now if we are hammering a strong support level then the game changes.  AU current example.  9400 becomes a key price level which PA has been using as support, so looks like a strong Demand Zone is setting up and looking for PA to move north and close higher before entering.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
TCO

2 bugs if I may regarding display status in v1.3

1. show settings = false / doesn't delete text from the screen

2. TP and SL on status is always "0"

suggestion regarding status window

countdown from last to the next trade - this way user will know when EA will execute next trade.

simple number for example if EA is setup for 8H delay as soon it is executed timer say 7H and counting, because when EA executed in 07:59 next order will be ready to execute in 15:00 with 8H delay

thx pro7

PS hope that in next release you will include hidden TP and SL

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Hello,

Congratulations TallCoolOne for this beautiful EA, I would like to know what are the currency pairs recommended and not recommended for TCO Trader..

Sorry for my eng.. im Italian..

Activemax

--- 帖子 #421 ---
You did read Post #1, right?

The EA is mainly developed for the 2 strategy named there, and in those threads, the pairs have been mentioned many times; just today 100_pips gave the current stops & take profits for the 20/50 method in that thread.

I have had over 200 trades using the 27 pairs of Global Prime (dropped EUR-NOK) the results below, trades of 30 pips and less are classed "break even"

But I wouldn't ignore a pair because of those results, what is to say the conditions next week may favor all the less profitable pairs and the winners may produce less pips?

A lot depends on how many pairs you want trade, how many can you trade, what style of trading do you intend to do, what sort of risk can you take on?

Good luck

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Thx Erebus..

All its Clear.. ;-)

--- 帖子 #423 ---
No problem, I forgot to mention, those results are from using SL / TP of 1 ADR of Daily chart, so R:R = 1 only

I am now testing using 1.1 * ADR Daily for Take Profit and 0.9 * ADR Daily for Stop Loss, to possible increase profit margin

So you can see my trading time is less than the originator of these methods

But still seems to be OK

--- 帖子 #424 ---
TCO Trader EA v1.3 in action, 20/50 method

already at my break even +10 pips, so risk free trade

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Hi Erebus, just wanna ask if you are using 20/50 method with TCO Trader EA of H1 TimeFrame .

As i am new here, i am spoilt with so many trend method .. which got 6 method, not sure which 1 is suppose to work the best.

AS for SL/TP , do you guys play 200/300 just like the EA set?

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Hi, EREBUS, some questions for you:

a)Your new set from post #368 has some modifications compared with the former set you included in post #226: Profitpercent for closing  the basket is now 20.0 (previously was 3.0); this is an important variation. Also I noticed that now WPR confirmation is set to “false” (previously was “true”). Also BreakEvenProfit is now 65 (previously 60). May be there are other modifications that I did not noticed. May be you so kind to say something about the logic of these changes?

b)In post #417 you say “The small TP are trailing stops hit, saved the account for sure”. My question is if these trailing stops are made by the EA or manually, because in your set the trailing stop parameter is “false”. If you find that the trailing stop may be useful, wouldn´t it advisable to implement this feature in the EA´s parameters?

Thank you very much for your contributions and good humor!

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Hi Prozor,  thanks for the feed back.  I should put an object delete in there if show settings is false.  I would think most would want the screen display.  I would just turn it off for back testing, which should make the test go faster.  I see that sometimes the TP and SL are 0 on some charts.  I will look into that issue.

I'm not really sure the hidden SL buys us anything and it would add a lot of complexity to the EA.  I like the count down idea.  I will think about adding that to the next release.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Hi Guys,

I wanted to add a trade explorer for my MACD demo but I guess we are limited to 2 explorers on a thread (unless someone can tell me how to add more).  So I will give weekly updates.  So I will post a weekly report for the MACD demo.  I'm also going to start a demo for the combined (Ichimoku & EMA & MACD) strategy, just to see if combining them has legs.   Thanks!

--- 帖子 #429 ---
1. Yes, I am, I have published many reports right here in this thread, please read it

2. The recommendation is to leave the EA run on the 1 hour time frame; it gets the signal from there, so that is what I am trading

3. Trend will have to be by your own definition, as you can see, you are spoiled for choice, but for 20/50 we know it is the 20/50 MA's

4. All my result so far have been using a Risk : Reward of 1 Average Daily Range of DAILY chart, so if EUR-USD Daily range is 90 pips, my Stop Loss & Take Profit will both be 90 pips

5. I am now experiment with 1.1 * ADR for TP, 0.9 * ADR for SL; so again for EUR-USD that would now be TP = 99, SL = 81 - the object being to slightly increase profit

Click on the Trade Explorer link in this message bottom left - from there you can EXPLORE many TRADES, have a look, it is fun

Erebus,

What is your setting on the T channel? 20/10 or 55/20? Thx

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Turtle is 20/10 and I look at Weekly 10/5 to see what is going on there, my Turtle Trade Explorer no doing to good right now

--- 帖子 #432 ---
That might be the per thread restriction, but how about just under your name? Then link it in your signature like me

A/J Chart 20/50 rule. One trade open. 3 max set. Let's see.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
The T trend looks more promising then the 20/50 EMA, no? Looks to give good trend change breakout signal. Maybe a good HTF strategy filter.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Hi Erebus, may i ask if you change your TP/SL on a daily basis base on the ADR of the day?

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Hi TCO,

on which daily time period is the ATR calculation based on? I'm using a 20period (one month) and get slightly different values as on the screen display. I'm also getting some zero values for SL/TP but otherwise the new version works well. Thanks for the double data ATR format and the other useful features.

Thx and happy trading, jdva

--- 帖子 #438 ---
I'm using 13 for ATR, but you can set it to what works best for you.  I'm aware of TP and SL showing up on the screen display as zero sometimes.  I will look into getting the fixed.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #439 ---
TCO,

What I have noticed is that TP and SL only shows up when a trade has been opened on that particular pair. I have mine set up on ATR and this is how it works. It will also happen when you restart your MT4. Even though you have open positions on the pair. It resets the TP/SL to zero until a new position is opened on that same pair again. Just FYI

--- 帖子 #440 ---
TCO, what I mean is my ATR20 shows 190  pips and on screen display it is 216, ATR period in EA is set to 20.

--- 帖子 #441 ---
Hello TOC,

Just finally getting the new bot set up and it fired off 3 trades without setting TP/SL.  I have it set to do this by ATR - please see the screen shots.  Am I missing something in my settings?

Thx

--- 帖子 #442 ---
Do you actually use the EA yet?

One of the options is to have the EA set the Take Profit & Stop Loss based on the ATR or ADR = same thing

So yes, I guess that can change from day to day, but I don't have to do anything

See the picture

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Erebus, good trading!.. Just a note on NZDUSD results.  It is surprising that NU took such a loss -- it has been trending nicely for the past two months.   Took a recent pullback and now it is consolidating, but trended for 800+ pips from April through mid-June.  Any thoughts on this?  You will note that it maintained a nice down-trend for three months.  Just necessary to trade the pullbacks and give it room to move.  That is what WPR%  and the TCO trend logic does.  Maybe a different trend strategy would have produced winning results?

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Sorry, I nearly missed this post, only your 2nd, pretty sharp questions, not your first rodeo?

I may have posted the wrong set file, in any case, I try to set a very high profit percent becuase I don't want to use but if it ever reaches it, well, I will take it

I do like the W%R to be True, yes I do

By the trailing stops, I meant the Break Even stop +10 pips, my mistake

Now I have that set for 75, no reason

You can see this picture and last post, should be all the information there

Please post your demo results for whatever setting you will try

Good humor, good gracious, I am grumpy old man, just ask my wife

Thanks,

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Only started the demo on 5th, I believe it was, there was a huge pullback during 11 to 14 and that is when those trades took place, this is how a portfolio works, some winners, hopefully less losers

History shows 1 full TP, 3 full SL and 4 BE +10 pips, so not bad for 8 trades

I'm sure during that trend you mention, it would capture many pips, and it probably will in future

You can give it room to move when you run your demo; I have my stops and sticking to them

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Hi Telac, I will do some more testing with this tonight.  Sorry that the TP and SL aren't getting set.  I havent' had that issue yet.  I will check to see if I can determine what is the cause.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Thansk MXFX, this makes sense, the display TP and SL are not the external paramters, I set the display TP and SL when we actually have a confirmed trade signal.  I will have to look into this to make the external TP and SL the default display TP and SL even before we have a trade.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Hi Guys.  I know we have a few bugs.  I will try to get those ironed out.  I kinda like where the EA is as far as features and presentation.  Here is what I'm looking at for a few future enhancements and fixes.

- Adding two trend method combinations - Ichi & EMA,  Ichi & MACD,  EMA & MACD

- Trade Comments - describing trend method

- Display number of bars from last trade - so trader can anticipate when the EA will be trade ready for that pair.

- Possibly add stochastics as an option to use instead of WPR

- Fix display TP and SL where it shows zero

- Make sure the EA is always setting TP and SL

I've had requests for hidden TP and SL, also ATR based jump, trailing and breakeven SL. I'm not sure they are worth the squeeze to add more complexity to the EA and are they really going to be used.   I'm sure there are others that were requested.

I would like to get some feed back on these before I spend the time coding.  I think we have a pretty stable EA, that seems to be profitable at the moment.  I would love to get about 6 months under our belt and really see how this EA functions when we have a few trend cycles and some ranging markets.  I think the first 6 items will done rather soon - not sure about the others.

I just like to know what everyone is thinking about this and get some feedback.   Thanks!

BTW, many of you have said many nice things and given thanks and your appreciation.  I know I haven't responded to all those kind words, but I do appreciate it.   I'm glad I can give back and make this EA available and keep making improvments like we are.  Thanks for the interest and your patience.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
Stochastics added without eliminating WPR. Just added as another trigger oscillator.

Maybe you can consider Erebus' turtle channel as a high TF trend indi. I can send you the mq4 file if you want to take a look. I think it gives a smoother breakout signal then 20/50 EMA's. Would be nice to test it based on that trend indi. Love to see how it would work combined together with MACD strategy.

Thanks again TCO.

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Hi MX, yes we could make the oscillators a and/or combination.   We could try the turtle also.  I would need the indicator and the rules for trading it.   Just another trend method to add - here we go.....oh my, and every combination will grow geometrically.  Oh well.

By the way, I was able to add the TCO Trader MACD explorer to my signature.  So all 3 methods can now be watched.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #451 ---
Hi TCO,

Strange because it was only the first 3 trades; since then there have been several more all with SL/TP set and I didn't change anything.  Anyway, thanks for all your work here.

I think it will be the same, max 3-5 pips difference

don't bother with hidden TP & SL if this will add more complexity to the code

thx pro7

--- 帖子 #454 ---
The EA is programmed to select TF per our settings.  So it should not matter what TF the chart sits on.  If I am wrong let me know.

--- 帖子 #455 ---
NOT TRUE. Besides, the use of stochs gives not only better entry, but lower DD. It's a better representation of PA then WPR which can stretch and retract all while bar is still open. Stoch is much smoother. I've been using it on my live account. Dr Elder suggest Stochastics as a replacement for WPR.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Wow, great ideas.  I do not know if Stochastic is better than WPR, maybe that is not needed.  So far I am finding higher profits with the EMA and the Ichi methods. A combination I think would really be helpful.

Thanks for everything.

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Hi TCO

I downloaded the EA yesterday and it looks really exciting.

I've never traded with an EA before, I suppose I didn't like the idea of something opening trades for me, but for some reason was really drawn to your thread.

I ve begun to run some tests on a demo using the 20/50 EMA method, not sure if this is the best one, but will give it a go.

Just wanted to ask about closing trades, should i do this manually when in profit, or do I let the EA close them.

Cheers

martin

--- 帖子 #458 ---
Please don't say Stochastics is not needed, unless you have actually used it with this system. I've been using it on my live account with better results then WPR as per Dr Elder's recommendation. Look at this example A/U chart during FOMC release. All within this ONE hourly bar. Look at where WPR is and where stochastics is.

--- 帖子 #459 ---
MKFX what setup you recoment for stoch also can you share stoch.mg4 that you use on yours charts with green and red OB OS

thx pro7

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Update A/U chart.

Although this chart is using the 20/50 strategy, If you're trading the MACD strategy, a buy trade would've triggered and now you are currently over 120 pips DD while stochastics is barely broken the 50 level yet, much less being oversold. So how is stochastics NOT needed again?

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Hi UK, welcome to the thread.  I hope it all goes well for you.  I'm closing all trades at 3% profit at the moment. You can download my set files in post one and use them.   It might be better to just set atr tp to 3 and atr sl to 2 and let the chips fall where they may.  You need to find out what you are comfortable with.  Look at Erebus's method.  This may suit you too.

--- 帖子 #462 ---
TCO,

I was wondering if the trend shows ranging, will it open a trade at any time? This particular questions pertains to the current G/U 20/50 strategy. Thanks

--- 帖子 #463 ---
I can see your logic.  I am testing all three strategies and the MacD strategy is not doing very well in comparison to the others.   I see that maybe switching to Stochastics might help that some.  Thanks for the charts.  A few minutes ago we had a big move and the MacD strategy took a big hit, while the other 2 survived and actually made a big profit move.

--- 帖子 #464 ---
1. Define "ranging"

2. What is "current" G/U 20/50 strategy? Was there a previous G/U 20/50 strategy?

3. If you are not already doing so, I strongly suggest that you run this EA on a DEMO account and watch it in real time

4. To the best of my knowledge, once the trading conditions have been met, the EA makes the trade

5. There are endless possibilities of settings, so how to best answer your vague question?

6. When the student is ready, the teacher will appear

--- 帖子 #465 ---
erebus,

The word "current" pertains to the G/U chart not the 20/50 strategy. I just want to confirm no trade will take place when it shows ranging.

--- 帖子 #466 ---
What you need as your signature is the picture below

And me as your business manager

Go 20 / 50 GO

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Well, that is easy, you obviously have it running just fine, so are able to answer your very own question!

If the green price label on your chart shows where it is, looks like it is neither above BOTH 20/50 or below BOTH 20/50, so therefore = ranging

Did it trade or not?

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Why you insist yelling at me, with your all caps and bold lettering on? I've only been courteous towards you in all of my post, on each thread. If you can't be courteous back, then just ignore the question, or me altogether.

Erebus: Good evening!

On my demo I am using your current settings.

Today's my results reached almost 50% of your results, amazing!

Thank you for all the guidance and constant help.

To all, TCO, 100pips, Erebus, thanks for this generosity.

Regards,

rswamy

--- 帖子 #470 ---
When it is ranging the price should be between the EMAs.  So technically we are not in a trend according to 100PipsADay's strat, if I understand it correctly.

--- 帖子 #471 ---
I like it.....lets go pro.

--- 帖子 #472 ---

--- 帖子 #474 ---
Thanks for your help TCO, all makes perfect sense. I decided to give Erebus's settings a go, as he seems to be having a lot ofsuccess. (thanks Erebus)

But looks like I got off to a bad start after yesterdays volatility, just woke up to find 6 trades all got stopped out.

Here's hoping for better things today

--- 帖子 #475 ---
The formula to calculate Williams’ Percent Range oscillator is similar to the one used to calculate the Stochastic Oscillator:

WPR : %R = (MAX (HIGH (i - n)) - CLOSE (i)) / (MAX (HIGH (i - n)) - MIN (LOW (i - n))) * 100

STO : %K = (CLOSE - MIN (LOW (%K))) / (MAX (HIGH (%K)) - MIN (LOW (%K))) * 100

Where:

CLOSE – current close price;

MIN (LOW (%K)) – the lowest bottom within the number of %K periods;

MAX (HIGH (%K)) – the highest top within the number of %K periods.

%D = MA (%K, N)

Where:

N – smoothing period;

MA – moving average.

as you can see in image below when you setup period =1 and %D =1 you have STO = WPR

I ask you to share indy (pointed with arrow) and what setup do you recommend, you didn't answer

Yes, I am well aware that Stochastics is smoother. The settings I use is 14,3,3. As for attaching the indicator, TCO doesn't want us posting other indies or EA's in here.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Yes, best stick with the rules, I wouldn't mention any names either

Now speaking of Stochastic, I had a look back about 6 pages but can't seem to find the discussion on it?

Or was it in the 20 / 50 thread?  I will try MKFXTrader setting of 14,3,3 to start.

Just wondering what might be an appropriate setting, and why, for the 1 hour charts, thanks

--- 帖子 #478 ---
Hi TCO,

My greetings

I have joined the thread now and started trying two of the trend methods

1.All three combined

2. 20/50 EMA METHOD

These I am trying on demo accounts . I have gone through all the postings number of times and keep on reading new postings( old ones also to understand more)

Trying Erebus settings as I find them more successful and understandable.

I feel if following two filters are added in your next EA update,:

1.  TURTLE CHANNEL as higher TF trend filter in 20/50 EMA trend method as suggested by Erebus , and,

2.  Weekly TF trend as filter in MACD trend method

These two filters may improve the trade success on above two methods.

I am grateful to you and other contributors for providing a wonderful EA whose chances of success seems to be very high with excellent trade management capabilities

--- 帖子 #479 ---
I can see where using this particular Stochastic and settings, may have kept those people that take multiple positions, out of 3 losing trades as shown

Of course trade "A" would be a loser no matter how you entered

And the current signal remains to be seen if it makes any pips, but as long as it goes down far enough to set off break even, then no loss at least

The EMA's on daily are being pushed by price, shows how delicate the math is within the EA to trigger the entry

Time will tell ...

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Hi New, I'm glad you have joined the thread and I appreciate your diligence in reading all the posts. I think adding the turtle channel should not be a big deal.  The actual logic is very easy and I should be able to add that as a trend method.   There seems to be some difference of opinion here on this post in regards to the Weekly TF trend as a filter for the MACD trend method.  This statement - "These two filters may improve the trade success on the above two methods".   There might be a lot of methods that MAY improve the success of the the two methods. But do they.  Is it worth adding more complexity to the EA and adding more external parameters that confuse more than it helps.  Have you gone back looking at historical weekly charts manually, marking the beginning of the uptrend and the end of the uptrend and then drill down on the daily and hourly charts to see if it kept out of more bad trades than good trades, or did it keep us out of more good trades than bad trades and did it do it on a majority of the pairs or was it a onesie twosie thing.   This is what we need to consider before we muck up the EA with (this might work better stuff).  Don't get me wrong....I'm not mad....I just get concerned with adding this and that and 2 months from now, we don't even know what this EA was based on or supposed to be.   Maybe a little of it is my fault because I added the Ichimoku method and the combined 3 methods.   Also don't get me wrong, I like to tinker and add new stuff and strats, but we just need to be careful with how complex we make this EA.  So......please do a little historical checking of some pairs and look at the weekly, the daily and hourly for all pairs and see if it really has legs.   I can also tinker on my side and add some of these ideas to my test version and do some backtesting.  If it doesn't really improve profitability significantly then I probably won't add the extra complexity to the released version.   Thanks for your interest and good luck will all of this.  TCO.

You should see my live example comparison on page #23 of this thread. It will show live behaviour of both WPR and stochastics during yesterday's PA. If one was trading the MACD strategy using WPR yesterday, they would've automatically been in draw down as soon as the trade would've opened at O/S level. Stochastics is much smoother in it's workings, and as Dr. Elder describes, it is for conservative trader.

Dr Elder writes in his book:

For conservative traders, choose a relatively slow oscillator, such as

daily MACD-Histogram or Stochastics, for the second screen. When the

weekly trend is up, look for daily MACD-Histogram to fall below zero

and tick up, or for Stochastic to fall to its lower reference line, giving

a buy signal. Reverse these rules for shorting in bear markets. When trend following

indicators point down on the weekly charts, but daily MACDHistogram

ticks down from above its zero line, or Stochastic rallies to

its upper reference line, they give sell signals.

Add: Of course he is using weekly and daily TF as examples in his book. We use daily and hourly, but same concept applies.

Cheers

Hi everybody, and thanks to TCO for this great EA. Also wanna thank Erebus explanation. Really helpful!

I'm testing since yesterday the system with the same Erebus settings. Only 20-50 MA method. But I don't know if it's doing well... Just one single opened position in 16 hours, in USD/CAD. Is that posible? I repeat that I'm using just the same Erebus settings. I've set "true" the WPR_confirmation. Should I better set to "false"?

And another question. The position is 80 pips positive but no TP fixed, when I've set that ATR option to 1.1. Is the Ea calculation automatic for the TP, I guess... Could you help me on that?

THANKS!! You all are doing a great thread here!!

Toni

--- 帖子 #483 ---
thx

TCO in his post ("- Possibly add stochastics as an option to use instead of WPR") ask "I just like to know what everyone is thinking about this and get some feedback. Thanks!"

I answer it will be the same...

MKFX thx for clarifying Stoch setup

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Hi Guys, on my way to work today.  I had some thoughts about keeping the code in the EA simple.  I think we can add more trend methods and lower TF signal methods.  I just need to make sure I keep the code clean and optimized.  We can add the weekly filter as a toggle to the MACD method.  If traders want to you use it they will if not they won't.   I will create two lower TF signal methods - one for WPR and Stoch.    The tricky part comes when wanting to use multiple trend methods.  I need to simplify that process.  Maybe I can list all the trend methods and I can allow the trader to select up to 3 methods.  These would be all inclusive.  Meaning if you pick method 1 & 3.   The both 1 and 3 have to be in an uptrend for the EA to allow buys based on the lower TF signal and if you use close on opposite signal then both 1 & 3 would need to be in a downtrend and have lower TF signal before the buy trades would be closed.  So these are things to think about.

So Trend Method Selection might look this in the parms.  Of course 5 and 6 would be mutually exclusive.

1. Ichimoku Only

2. 20/50 EMA Only

3. MACD Only

4. Turtle Only

5. GoLong Only

6. GoShort Only

Trend Method 1:   1

Trend Method 2:   3

Trend Method 3:   4

So the above example would use Ichimoku and MACD and Turtle to determine Large TF trend direction

The above select could look like this:

Trend Method 1:   1

Trend Method 2:   0

Trend Method 3:   0

Then only Ichimoku would be used.

The Lower TF methods

1. Williams %

2. Stochastic

Lower TF method 1: 1

Lower TF method 2: 2

Both methods would be used for Lower TF signal confirmation.

Lower TF method 1: 2

Lower TF method 2: 0

Only Stoch would be used for Lower TF signal confirmation.

MACD Settings would have this added

MACD_Fast = 12

MACD_Slow = 24

MACD_Signal = 9
MACD_Weekly_Confirmation = false.

Set MACD_Weekly_Confirmation to true to also confirm the trend using the weekly MACD.

Does this make sense?

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #485 ---
TCO,

I think that would be one awesome EA. A Lamborghini of all EA's. Can't wait to test drive it.

Stochs would just need ability to input OB/OS levels, settings options and confirmed(true/false) like WPR is currently set up.

--- 帖子 #486 ---
Cristal clear

agree with MKFX Stoch OB/OS levels option setup

hardly wait to test

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Right on the Stoch stuff.  I will make it happen.  I should be able to work on it this weekend - if the boss(my wife) lets me.  If mama ain't happy, no one is happy.  Maybe I should put that as my signature line.  Anyways...thanks for the input guys.  TCO

--- 帖子 #488 ---
That's an International quote too.

BTW- I think for stochastics to be in OB/OS, both the K period and the D period have to be under/below those levels we set. For confirm, we just need K period to cross D period and poke through OB/OS levels like WPR is set now.. No need for both K and D to exit together for it to be classified as confirmed. This of course if it's possible to code. I'm not sure..Any thoughts?

--- 帖子 #489 ---
Hello TCO,

I'm not a user of EA's but since this was based on my buddy's system, it caught my eye so I decided to throw it on my demo this Monday to see it work.

Now this is strange and I have no idea if the EA is responsible but, since placing it on an EJ chart, I've had several GU and Gold shorts closed without any interaction from me. I just finished a live chat with support at LiteForex (SIGTrader) and they have tracked the close requests as coming from my IP at my end. I have since disabled the EA and placed some more trades so I'll watch to see if it happens again.

Again, it could be just a strange coincidence and I have some problem with the platform after 10 months of trading it. I am currently going through the trades that were closed on GU and Gold to see if any of the EA's TP targets match the close price. I have checked one Gold short and it closed at 520 pips so that doesn't really match. Oh, the EA did not initiate any trades on EJ all week.

Do you think it's possible for the EA, on an EJ chart with no open trades, to close trades across other pairs? Seems unlikely to me but thought you'd like to know in case.

Anyway, just thought I'd mention it as I think what you're doing is really great.

Chris

--- 帖子 #490 ---
I'm wondering if you had the CloseAfterPctProfit = true.  Please check your settings.  Did you read the instructions and understand all the settings before adding the EA to your charts?   You have to be careful.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #491 ---
Yes to setting, and yes to reading.

I had it only on an EJ chart. Not GU or Gold.

So "if" it was the EA (and it may not have been), even if I had the wrong settings, I wouldn't think it would effect pairs it's not attached to. I'll know better once I have traded for a while without it. If I still have the problem then it's not the EA. If I do then it might be.

Thanks

Hi Tco,

I am grateful to you for your kind reply to my post and educating me.Please decide what is the best,least complex and most accurate for the EA, I have full trust in your capabilities.I will keep on posting if any thing I would like to suggest or I would like to learn from you and others. In the mean time waiting for your updated EA,demo on three trend methods of present EA is on.I will try to post the trade explorer after a week's performance.

Hi TCO,

first thanks you and all other people that contribute to this big works.

Wenn I  can just write my 2 cents, I will add too following:

CCI indicator

and (total SL each pair), (Total BE each pair) ,(Total TP  each pair),(Total Trailing SL each pair)

This options will open much more possibility to money management.

Please think on that.

Thanks you.

Hi TCO
First I want to thank you for all your efforts and sharing the EA with us.
I opened a new demo account on Tuesday with FXCM-UK to run the EA and FXCM might be the wrong broker for running this EA. But most of the time the SL and TP are not set and I get the message: “error 141- too many requests”. I can insert the SL and TP afterwards and as I use the settings of Erebus later also the SL is moved correctly to BE plus 10 pips. And when the EA tries to open more than 1 trade at the same time I get the same error. I looked through my charts where now the field SL and TP was filled with data but no trade and just added the template with the EA again and when I am quick enough the trade will be taken. But that is not the way to go and it would be nice that the EA can do all on its own and the trades and SL/TP changes are taken by the broker. The EA made nice profits so far.

Is it just FXCM or might you have a look at the EA that this will no longer happen. Thanks for an answer.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
For those using the percentage TP.  Are you also using the percentage s/l or just setting your s/l's on each pair?

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Your assumption is incorrect. With the EA attached to ANY pair on your trading platform, as long as the CloseAfterPctProfit=true, it will close ALL existing orders on ALL pairs (or instruments) in your MT4 trading platform once the specified amount of profit is reached on the whole account (computed from previous balance). The script simply loops through all open pairs and closes them one by one until there is none. Thus, if you are going to use this option, it will be best to keep this EA on its own iteration of MT4.

Hope this helps,

TF

--- 帖子 #498 ---
What happens after closure.  Does it immediately fire up again?

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Personally I have the TP and SL by pip set for each pair (mine is presently 350 TP and 250 SL for each pair). I use 3% take profit on the whole account.

TF

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Yes sir.

TF

Perfect! Thank you for the answer sir. I thought perhaps I was losing my mind...lol

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Wow. This EA is going to be bloated (if not already) if we keep putting everything but the kitchen sink in it. Is CCI really going to be that much different than W%R or Stochs? Do you have any proof of this?

Ahhh,

So first one to the finishline wins

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Hi Erin, thanks for your kind words.  I'm sorry about the 141 error.  I have not seen this error with IBFX.  I wonder if the EA was trying open many orders at one time and then perform the TP and SL modify and this overwhelmed the FXCM.  I'm not sure.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Hi Spydey, I'm using ATR TP 3 and ATR SL 2 on every chart.  I'm also using 3% profit on the whole account for trade closure.  I'm not using and loss % to close all.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
Right on. Some have expressed concern that this arrangement will hurt the R:R, but I have not found that to be the case. Thus far I am having just as many or more TPs get hit as SLs. Often times on the way to 3%, some trades will hit TP, which actually makes it a little harder to get to the 3%, but it's all good.

TF

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Hi TCO

Thanks for your answer. When only 1 order is to execute SL/TP are not taken – it happened just again. When there is more than 1 order at the same time only 1 order is taken. Both get the error code141- too many requests.

I will install another demo and run the EA there.erin1

--- 帖子 #508 ---
I hear ya Scott.  After this next update, I will not be adding anymore trend methods or lower TF methods.  We need to lock down the code and let this hummer do it's thing.   Man my ema basket just zoomed to 3% profit.  Crazy crazy..

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Most excellent. I plan to go live with this in July. Thus I am fully expecting it to stop working on July 1. Just the "glass half empty" mentality that I can never seem to fully shake. This system just seems too good to be true thus far. We had some real tumult in the market the last couple of days, and this thing just sailed right through hardly missing a beat. Hoping it can continue.

So TallCoolOne no human intervention till now on your demo account ? or just minimal intevention ? especially I'm interested on the ema account .....

'though I see it's a short time since the ema account it's started ....

you know it's hard to believe to a 100% fully automatic making steady profits for long time without human intervention or account blowup at the end ....

maybe who knows peaking 3% each time and close basket on trend and only human intervention at main reversal point it could go fine ...

but let me ask you 3% close all basket for all pairs or single pair ? I guess when total 3% target reached on all pairs close all orders on all pairs.

--- 帖子 #512 ---
He just answered this question bro. Did you bother to read any part of the thread or used the search function? C'mon man.

If you guys want to use the EA, then learn and read about it! Read the thread, skim through it, or read the d##n instructions that came with the EA. Don't ask the same question that was JUST ANSWERED. It's like groundhog day on these threads.

No intervention so far, but like you it is very early.  I'm hoping to just go automated and now have much intervention, but if you want to give God a good laugh..just tell him your plans.

Brought to you at great expense and huge personal hardship, today's 20 / 50 report

Yesterday - 25 closed trades - +$2,658.63

* I only just thought about using the MT4 History day setting to screen this out

* Now I can go back on daily basis for each day

Currently as I type, 24 open trades, give or take +$8,000

I don't know what I was thinking yesterday, but I wanted to reach 50% gain and I thought it was FRIDAY and would never make!

Now, I realize it is Friday, and the Trade Explorer is saying EQUITY = $158,000

So, see what today's trading brings

--- 帖子 #517 ---
TCO,

That looks so great the way you have that laid out, and so logical, it will be an awesome update to an already awesome EA !!!

First up, my thoughts on the Weekly filter, nice to visually check but probably not be much used in my trading, as you know, my TP & SL are based on ATR Daily, so the Trend as per Day chart is good enough for me.

As I mention, if anyone sees something that bothers them on Weekly chart, don't trade that pair, or for trend change, you probably see signs on Daily already IMHO.

What I do think might be more useful, in some cases, is the option to select, Price under/over 20/50 EMA's AND 20/50 EMA's Crossed Over

If you look at the grey areas on the chart below from April - May 2012 of GBP-JPY, you can see where I mean

As for the Turtle Lines as filter, I don't know, I like it as a visual and confirming but if too much trouble programming, don't bother.

Back to the GBP-JPY, we are in much the same situation right now if you look at Daily, got a few trades in that area because price below 20/50 but now it has gone up while 20/50 did not cross.

I know others have posted about being caught on the YEN retracement on other pairs; of course, never a guarantee, but should be easy to code right?

I think that this would be of special help to the original rules of the big target / stops, whereas I got by with fewer trades, closer stops & targets and not burned at all.

Thanks as always, E.

1. Ichimoku Only
2. 20/50 EMA Original (Price under / over)
3. 20/50 EMA Crossed Over
4. MACD Only
5. Turtle Only
6. GoLong Only
7. GoShort Only

Hi TCO

Been running a few versions of the new 1.3 trader with great success, Thank you.

The EA took this buy trade , but i thought that it would not take buy trades unless the Daily candle closes above the 20/50EMA or does only the price simply need to be above the 20/50 EMAs? I am also running the previous version TCO Trader which did not take this trade.

Thank you

Fxarcher

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Hi fxarcher,

Not TCO but I can tell you that there are 2 settings you need to check, comprehend and use them in the way you want them to act according to the price action.

First, CheckOncePerBar, this is the 1 Hour bar, if true, then when trade conditions are met, the trade is opened on the start of new hour and bar opening price; if false, trade is met in real time, when trading conditions are met. You can look to your open trades to see if they are all on the hour eg 11:00, 12:00 or odd times eg 11:13, 12:42

Second, way down the bottom, WPR Confirmation also for the 1 Hour chart, if false, then a trade is opened (as long as 20/50 rule met) as soon as the indicator reads a value above or below the -20 / -80 lines; if true, then the line must first cross over the -20/-80 line, and then back again, then, depending on the setting of CheckOncePerBar, a trade will open immediately or wait until the hour rollover.

So, go to your 1 Hour chart, see where the trade opened, check the EA settings and you will see why it opened.

Hope that helps, E.

Good point, being that was 100_pips, we must assume that is how he had khaled program the EA for his method

I have been under the impression that price only had to be above / below both EMA's to qualify

Something that needs to be checked and clarify with TCO in regards to his EA coding

Not sure what his timezone is and when he surfaces

Hi fxarcher,

I believe you have your setting to use macd and not to use 20/50 ema so that could be why your ea took that trade

Hi TCO,

Well, my FXCM demo have the same 141 error too running on my VPS with EA on 12pairs. I ran the EA on Alpari UK for 1 week and did not encounter that same error.

Anyway, i did some modifications to the OpenBuyOder,OpenSellOrder and AddStopProfit functions to introduce retries/delays to circumvent the broker server lags and is monitoring the EA behavior now.

Erebus,

Can you clarify if you are using tick mode or bar close and also WPR confirmed yes or no? Just want clarification as I have seen a few of your settings from previous posts, and each are different when it came to this. If not then what settings of the described is most efficient in your experience of running this EA? Are you still using the setup from post #226 or #520 or #442 and #444? Maybe you have different setup for each demo. I'm test running multiple setups, but I haven't ran it as long as you have. Thank you

Hi all,

Am using TCO Trader EA with 20 EMA & 50 EMA.

Read 100PipsADay Thread on how this system works and my understanding is to look at Daily Chart for Buy or Sell Signal.

Price above 20 EMA & 50 EMA = Buy

Price below 20 EMA & 50 EMA = Sell

We then look at H1 on William % Range for Entries.

Now my question below is in this 2 pics shows that price in Daily is above 20 EMA & 50 EMA so we should be looking for buy positions right?
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Next in H1 shows that William % Range is OverSold.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Now why did the EA enter a sell trade here? Trying to figure this out.

Would someone be so kind to tell me where have I understood the strategy wrong.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Hi fxarcher,  it will take the trade on the close of the lower TF bar if you are in bar mode.  It will take the trade if the Bid goes above the EMA on tick mode.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Hi fxarcher, I see what you are saying here.  This might be a good filter to add.  Make sure previous D1 bar has closed above or below the EMA and then make sure the currently hourly PA is above also.  These changes would be more inline with 100Pips strategy.  Thanks for pointing that out.  I will make this change on the next update.   TCO.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Nice Dark,  keep us posted on your fix and let us know if it clears it up.  I would hate to have to add that to the EA but we may have to.  Thanks for your efforts.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Hey Hennessy,

I've got same doubt as you in AUD/JPY pair. I was going to post same question. If you look daily chart price is above EMAs so we have to look just for buy positions. Two times the EA opened a sell order when the William % Range was OB in 1H TF. That isn't make any sense regards to EMA 20-50 estrategy.

By the way I'm using same Erebus settings posted in this thread in #226 post. Just the EMA estrategy with WPR_confirmation set to true.

Can anuybody help to clariry this problem?

EDIT: soooorry, I've just seen the problem with the wrong EMA settings on the Daily chart, just solved!

Thank you in advence

Toni

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Yes.

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Mate,

you might have the same problem as me. Check ur EMA settings. Ensure that the settings are as posted above.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Oh my.  What's going on today? Need an espresso.

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Hi Hennessy, I think I see the issue. If you are using my template.  The template is designed for the lower TF chart.  So what you are seeing on the hourly chart are the daily trend methods as they look on the hourly chart.  So when you switch to daily chart, the trend method indicators will not be correct.  What I suggest is you open a fresh daily chart and put a 20/50 ema on there.  You will see we are in a down trend.  I know that is confusing.  I just like to see what the Williams % is dong on the lower TF since that is the trade trigger, so I adjusted the trend TF indicators to look how they would on the hourly chart.  So you don't have to keep switching between charts.  You can always look at the lower TF chart and see things as they are.  I zoom my charts out quite a bit so I can see all the trend methods clearly on the chart.  If you are going to use tick mode and not bar mode, then you could use 100Pips daily charts and switch back and forth to see the daily and hourly.  Whatever suits you.  Sorry for the confusion.  I hope that is clear.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Hi TCO,

thank you for your prompt reply. So meaning to say the settings for the H1 EMA settings are correct at 480 and 1200?

Attached Image

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Yes. You can go into properties(visualization) and just set it to read on the hourly TF only, then add another one to only show on the daily and have it set up to read 20/50.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Ok Guys, I'm seeing some confusion on the template and indicator settings on the charts.   There can be an issue here or not.  It depends if you use bar mode or tick mode.  Please look in the post to know what the difference is.  If you are using bar mode ( less resource intensive) then the EA must go on the lower TF chart.  If you are using tick mode ( more responsive trading, more resource intensive) then you can use the daily chart or the hourly chart.  The template that I posted is designed for the hourly chart.   The on-chart indicators in my template have had the periods changed so that they look like they should on the hourly chart.  So you are seeing the daily trend on the hourly chart...basically.  So if you switch to the daily chart, the trends will not be correct as far as the indicators on the chart.  So please keep that in mind.  If you are going to use tick mode and you want to use daily charts for the EA then I would use 100Pips template and then just attach my EA.  Then you can switch to hourly to see what the Williams % is doing.  The indicators on the chart have no affect on the the decisions that the EA makes, all the indicators are coded internal to the EA, it doesn't use any information from the screen.  The charts are just for our visual benefit.  But I want to reiterate, if you are going to use bar mode.  You need to be on the lower TF chart, which for most of us is the hourly.     You could stick the EA on a naked chart with no indicators and it will still do its thing.     I hope this is clear.    I know it can be confusing.   Please please let me know if anything is unclear about this.   Thanks!

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Yes, absolutely.  This is how the trend would look on the hourly chart.  So the settings had to be changed.   If you left it as 20/50 on the hourly chart, then we would be looking at the hourly 20/50 trend and not the daily 20/50 trend.  Thanks for the questions.   I know when I issued the template there was going to be some confusion.  I started doing it this way along time ago, because I hated switching charts. so I just set up the lower TF chart so that I could see the daily trend on the hourly chart.   TCO

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Erebus,

I use same settings as you since wenedsday but the EA just opened 5 trades in all that time: 2 EUR/GBP, 2 AUD/JPY and 1 USD/CAD. Is it posible? Are your statistics from past weeks? Don't seem to match my trades with yours...

thanks, and go on posting your thoghts, very helpful indeed!

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Very clear TCO!!!

I'm using bar mode, I'll keep the EA and template in 1H chart.

Thank you!!!

--- 帖子 #549 ---
TCO,

I think it's going to be nice to be able to mix match HTF trend following strategies in the next update. I see potential by using a couple of filters on the daily, while using Stochs on the hourly to pull the trigger. It'll be more conservative, but efficiency is all that matters, no? Can't wait.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Actually, am starting to understand what TCO is trying to say here. His template is meant for H1 so that we can keep an eye on the WPR for triggers and at the same time view the daily trends on the H1 chart itself without having to switch the need to back and forth.

Edit: Sorry didnt read ur previous post as above. But thanks for the clarification TCO. Prefer your template, lesser headaches of switching back and forth.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Yep. you got it. If you ever want to switch to the daily, just add the indie again and set it to read only on daily with 20/50 settings. It's just multiplying the settings by TF. Good to know for your future reference.

--- 帖子 #552 ---

Only 5 trades? How many pairs open / charts open?

There are 37 open trades right now, all you have to do is click the link in this message, go to Trade Explorer and do research there

I have made all settings "Public" so you can see all information, dollar amount, trade size, time, price, everything!!!!

Here is screen shot of all open now, including high light the trades you mention, I have the same 5 - check the price, small difference will be broker that's all

Wednesday was 19th right, it is all there, don't know what more can I do?

Down now -$1,550

Statistics are from account open on June 5, only 2 weeks now, I didn't make anything up!

Good luck

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Thank´s for the reply,

THANKS IN ADVANCE

AMIR

--- 帖子 #557 ---
I don't know what happen. I trade 18 pairs, all with TCO EA and your settings. It could be maybe a broker problem... Since I wrote you I have 4 more open positions: USD/CAD, AUD/JPY, EUR/AUD, AUD/USD. But, in instance, the EA doesn't open the EUR/CAD which was looking similar as EUR/AUD.

Any idea about this problem?

Toni

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Erebus, I would like to ask you why you run in tick mode (CheckOncePerBar = false).  I cannot argue with your results -- I applaud you.  You will get more trades, but at a penalty it would seem.  Daily candle will not always be closed above/below 20/50;  will whiplash around 20/50;  trade platform slows down even more when running large number of pairs, as we all are;  might want to trade on a VPS when trading live because of duration of open trades, and VPS's do not provide the necessary resource to trade large number of pairs.  But again, cannot argue with results.  Can you share your thoughts on this?

Hi TCO,

Just noticed that even when you set Williams to false the ea still uses willams values to enter a trade.

I am not sure about this ...

Could you please check it out.

Best regards

--- 帖子 #566 ---
I agree, certainly not more stupid questions, hang on there are no stupid questions

What do you think it means when you set William&R to false? How are trades suppose to be taken then?

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Well Amirsaid,

I'm currently testing TCO EA on an Amazon VPS ( Win 2008 R2) which is free for 1yr and monthly hours below 750hrs. The specs are not great especially the ram (only 640MB). CPU is an Intel Xeon E5 running at 2Ghz though.

Can't complain since its free and my FXCM Mt4 is still able to open trades, though i see that the server is giving error 141 when all pairs start to open trades at the same time.

Will see how it goes.

Cheers,

ck

I'll drink to that lol

--- 帖子 #570 ---
You better study the Third Screen Strategy or 20 EMA - 50 EMA method again

Not sure which you are following, but BOTH use the W%R as the trigger to enter a trade

Not sure what do you think is the entry parameter for a trade, please explain.

Refresh the settings

extern string Williams_Percent_Settings = "Williams % Settings";

extern int WPR_Periods = 14; - Leave next 3 settings as OOTB default

extern int WPR_OB = -20; - Overbought level

extern int WPR_OS = -80; - Oversold level

extern bool WPR_Confirmation = false;

- If set to true, signal must go below and above the WPR_OS level for a Buy

- If set to false, Signal must go above and below the WPR_OB level for a Sell

i have stopped smoking and drinking from 7 years ago with forex 2 year right now i.ll  going to start making two again

--- 帖子 #577 ---
Looks like there is a small error in the above explanation  as I see it.

This is the code:

Trend_Direction = "DownTrend";

if((WPR_Confirmation == true && WPRprev > WPR_OB && WPRcurr < WPR_OB) || (WPR_Confirmation == false  && WPRcurr > WPR_OB))

If set to TRUE , Price has enter the zone and come out of it for trade to take place.

Whereas if set to FALSE, simply on just entering the zone trade happens..

So if set to TRUE You are somewhat ensured that you are entering just when it is about to turn at OB/OS

--- 帖子 #578 ---
TCO,

Doesn't seem to be anyone(newbies) taking the time to read this thread, read the actual strategy threads, or even reading the instructions that comes with the EA. I am lost for words.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Hi Amirsaid, sorry for your confusion.  I know a lot is going on.  My setting files are in post one.  I'm testing all 3 current trend methods - Ichimoku, 20/50 EMA and MACD all on separate demos.   If you download them and use them you will have to rename them from .TXT to .SET.    Erebus is using a different method and he has generously posted images of his set file and has explained his method very well.  Good luck.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Hey MK.  I really appreciate you, Erebus and everyone else fielding the questions.  Frankly, this EA is a little befuddling.  There is a lot to it.  Many features, differences from the original strats - like the Williams % confirmation.  So I understand the confusion.  Plus the template stuff.  You look at post 1 and I would be .......why do I want to trade this thing.  OMG....so much to set up.   So it is okay if we get a lot of questions.  I'm not too worried about it.  That is what this thread is for and why I never attached the EA in 100pips thread.  I can't imagine how popular that would be.  With all these questions.

I think once I get the newest proposed updates done, we will be pretty much done with new development for the EA and we can make sure we get all the bugs fixed.  We will get a bunch of new posts in regards to the changes, but then is should settle down and we just trade the thing.

I appreciate all your help!!

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Hi Erebus, I forgot to replay to this.  Thanks for your kind words.  2 things to address.  I"m not sure the turtle method will work or not.  As far as the calculation for the turtle method it looks pretty easy.  So i'm not even going to call the indicator.  just put the actual calc in the EA.  I just need to test it along with the indicator to make sure it works correctly.  For the template. I tried to add the turtle channel to the lower TF and change the periods to represent the daily trend on the hourly chart, but that isn't working. ..So I need to rethink that for the Turtle.    As far as the 20/50 EMA Cross method...I will add a toggle to the EMA parameters  - Use_EMA_Cross = false.   If set to true, then the 20 EMA will need to be above the 50 EMA and price above both for the EA to trigger a buy signal when we have the appropriate Williams % trigger, vice versa for a sell trade.     That should not be too bad to code.   Thanks for all you do.  TCO.

--- 帖子 #588 ---
very interesting !

TCO, how to change the lot size?

--- 帖子 #589 ---
The EA has 3 methods for lot sizing.   Fixed Lot, Risk Based , or Lotsize per Balance

FixedLotSize = 0.01         - Fixed Lot Size to be used if DynamicLotSize is set to false

DynamicLotSize1 = false        - Set to true to have EA calculate lotsize based on risk entered on the next paramater

EquityPercent = 1        - Risk Percentage used in DynamicLotSize calculation

DynamicLotSize2 = false        - Set to true to use .01 per $1000 Account Equity

LotSizePerBal = 1000

LotSizePer = 0.01

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Hi All

It is Friday, and I am sober but thrashed and I don't know if I am hallucinating.

This is a 1 cent per pip account I started  running 2 days ago.

I have attached a screenshot of both the Terminal and the Input settings.

Please don't shoot me, but I am down 25 000 pips. The EA appears to be only taking buys.

Fxarcher

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Wow fxharcher,  not sure what to tell you.  You settings look good.  Only Buys that worries me.  Can you run a couple of back tests - one with your current settings but with CheckOncePerBar = true and one with your current settings as they are and tell me if the you get mixed buys and sells.  What TF chart are you putting the EA on?  Please let me know what you find out.  We need to get this fixed.  My  EMA demo is getting buys and sells but i'm using bar more.  Also, please confirm that the order delay is working also. By looking at the trades you listed above, it appears that it is.  I will run with your settings when I get home and see what happens.  We will get it figured out.  I'm pretty sure the NZDJPY trades should be sells....so i'm think there is a bug in the EA logic somewhere or you have it on the daily chart and tick mode isn't working on the daily chart.

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Can you post your settings again because I can't see anything. I don't have my magnifying glasses with me.

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Sure you have Short & Long in the settings ??

--- 帖子 #594 ---
This is the second time I have see a note referring to the TF of the chart.  Since all the setting for TF are in the EA why does it matter what TF the Chart is on? Am I missing something?

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Hi Fxarcher,

I think I found your mistake: your settings for the "Williams % settings" have to be -20 and -80 instead of 20 and 80.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Yo Olarion.......BIG KUDOS.....NICE.  This is it.  It is always going to be overrsold with those settings.   Nice catch!!.    Thanks!!

So fxarcher, make that correction and on Monday, hopefully, things will turn around.  You may want to start a new demo.  Please tell me this was on demo?

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Hi Gary, please read post 1.   Please read the instructions and please read the thread.  You should know all you need to know about TF and when it is important and when it isn't.    Thanks!

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Yes thank you Olarion!

TCO

It looks like I transferred a Tpl that was changed with some mistakes on it and changed it to these settings, not catching the mistakes.

So, lesson learned...always start a new platform with a clean Mq4 file.

Yes it was a demo.

I am not sure that the Buy Trade on the EJ that was earlier discussed was caused by this screw up, or was it?

So I think that the question still is does the EA require the Daily to be closed above the 20/50EMAs before taking a buy trade?

Thank you.

Have a good weekend

Fxarcher

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Yes I believe the previous daily bar should close above the EMAs before we take a buy.  I will need to change the code and make this part of the next release.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #600 ---
I know you want to get EA updated soon, but try not to work too hard over the weekend mate. Find time for family.

--- 帖子 #601 ---
TCO,

EA has opened both buy AND sell positions...I am using version 1.2..what could cause this?

--- 帖子 #602 ---
Crobbins. What strategy are you using? What do you have the EA set to? Looks to me you have it set to MACD strategy. MACD is flipping to the long side.

--- 帖子 #603 ---
20/50 EMAs

--- 帖子 #604 ---
Sorry but I can't see the attachment. I can't enlarge the picture. Maybe you should just download the new update v1.3, as the layout is even more user friendly.

--- 帖子 #605 ---
try this...click on the attachment...then put magnifying glass on and click once again and it should then be large for you to see well

--- 帖子 #606 ---
I don't know if it will solve the problem, but you shoud set "Check once per bar" to TRUE.

From your statement it looks as some SELLs and BUYs were opened during the same hour...anyhow the D1 trend should not change that quickly...

--- 帖子 #607 ---
please see attached...it appears to me that more than 6 hours elapsed between these trades

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Nothing is wrong bro. Look at PA last two days. Yesterday price closed above 20/50  EMA and today it retraced thus opening the buy position. One buy position may have opened on an hourly retrace yesterday of a breach above 20/50. Nothing is wrong. May also due to your broker server time as well. If you want, you can disable until you get more of a trend or set for positions to be closed out on opposite signal.

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Yes, between the SELLs are min. 6 hours and between the BUYs are 6 hours.

But between two BUYs and SELLs there was opened one trade each in the same hour...

12:28 buy

13:00 sell

20:09 sell

20:57 buy

It's quite strange, I would install the latest version 1.3 from scratch and try again.

--- 帖子 #610 ---
His sells and buys are on different days. Nothing is wrong.

--- 帖子 #611 ---
I agree that since the daily candle closed above the 20/50 that nothing was wrong to begin to take the buy trades.  However, according to the intention of 100pips, the EA should not allow hedging.  I believe that is also TCOs intent but hopefully he can let us know if this is otherwise.

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Those are the rules within Khaled's EA. It is not the rules of the strategy. My guess is either Khaled didn't have the experience to program it any other way, or he made the EA for 100pip based on FIFO rules since 100pip lives in the U.S.

TCO's EA, only has an option for you to close on opposite signal. I don't want an EA to be setup the way khaled has his programmed. I would rather suggest turning off the EA on that particular pair when you see a potential change in trend, and you have positions open. Logic tells me though, it would be best to cut your losses and go with the new trend, instead of holding onto the position and waiting for it to hit your SL. This is if you are truly trading the third screen strategy, and not trading as a long term position trader.

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Hi Crobbins, it was not my intent to allow the EA to hedge, but to only trade in one direction.  This should be fixed in v1.3 in post 1.   Thanks!

--- 帖子 #614 ---
E...just curious

Which setup is that you found to be the best so far?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Hi crobbins,

Set "Close_Trades_On_Opposite_Signal" to true.

If set to false the open trades will go until TP or SL and the EA will open new trades following the latest valid signal until the max.order is reached.

Hi TCO,

I was just looking at the latest in the other threads and noticed this: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...61#post6771161

Dear TCO / Erebus & Co

I just want to thank for your work. I'll test the TCO 20/50 and the thirdscreen from 100PipsAday run together on two demoaccounts starting the same time.

I just wonder what "Global Trade Profit Target based on percentage of account balance, will close all trades (the entire basket for all pairs)" really means. Does it close all trades opened from the bot identified by the magicnumbers, or does it close every trade (even manually, and other from different EAs opened trades)?

thank you

PBPTaker

--- 帖子 #619 ---
I believe that it will close every trade that is open in the account regardless of how it was opened.

I can give you a CloseByProfit EA that will only close trades for the pair of the chart it is applied to if you like

Problem is, you can only run 1 EA per chart, so need to remove the trading EA and apply the Take Profit EA

Or have a complete set of charts open in another MT4 running side by side, not as silly as it sounds

As I will be trialing something along these lines for a few weeks

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Hi TCO/Erebus,

Thanks for sharing this fabulous system and EA. I have been manually demo testing the third screen system for a little while now and also have the EA attached to various charts. The results from the EA as well as from manual tests have been extremely pleasing.

The reason for this post was to congratulate you and others in this thread for their contribution and ask a question which is pondering in my mind regarding the macd_adjustable.mq4 indicator. I can see that it is very efficient in discovering the main trend without even missing it once. And the kind of success which I am having makes me wonder if their are any re-painting indicators used in this strategy.

Because I have been often fooled by repainting indicators and doesn't want to put my trust in this system to only realize later on that the indicators repaint.

Please confirm that their are no repainting indicators used in this system.

Thanks and regards,

Ravs

--- 帖子 #621 ---
Hi Erebus,

A simpler way to accomplish the "2 EA's on one chart" is simply to open a second chart on the same pair on the same MT4 platform so you'd have one chart with the TOC EA and on the other you can dump any other EA or script you want.  I do this all the time with the "Close all orders after account profit reached" EA and the "Close all orders after account loss" EA.  Works fine even with the main EA running on the same pair - just needs to be separate charts for each EA and in this example actually ends up being 3 EA's running on one pair - just separate charts.

Cheers and thanks so much for your input, help and great ideas on this thread!

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Hi Erebus / Telac

OK, thank you. I'll use CloseOnProfit on a second chart.

Nevertheless it may be a cool future feature that the bot would only close his trades identified by the magicnumber.

But ColseOnProfit should do the same. No hurry.

Thank you / best regards

PBPTaker

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Hello TCO/Erebus,

Thank you for this excellent EA. I have a question regarding the charts this EA should be used with. I'm running two demos, one with FXCM-USA and the other with AxiTrader.

in FXCM MT4, the charts used are Non-New York Close 6-day Chart, while AxiTrader use New York Close 5-day Chart only. There is a big difference between the two charts on higher timeframes such as D1. So the question is, which charts do you recommend to use with your EA, 5-days (NY close) or 6-days (non-NY close)?

PS. Your post #1 "Higher TF Trend Modes - can be set to whatever Higher TF you desire, the EA is designed to work with one method so if you mark one true, mark the others false." However in v1.3 notes you says: " All three trend methods can be used for trade filter", so maybe you need to update your earlier statement to limit confusion.

Hi Telac, I can test the next update with the  MACD3SS indicator.  It shouldn't be an issue.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Hey PBP, the CloseAfterPctProfit feature in V1.3 will close all trades for all pairs with the same magic number.  So you should be able to use multiple EAs on the same account if that is your wish.  Thanks for your kind words.  Let us know how your testing progresses.  TCO.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Hi Ravs, as far as I know it doesn't repaint,  but maybe some of the Third Screen experts can enlighten us.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Hi TCO, I am demo ing the two strategies from 100pips. My conclusion is the 3ss is beter than the 2050 ema.

And will go live next week with your EA using macd trend and 3 percent profit and breakeven settings similar to erebus settings. I will run it on a small live acccount with only 4 a 5 pairs.

Wish to thank you for your great EA!

--- 帖子 #628 ---
There are NO repainting indicators used with the systems. You may want to study the behaviour of WPR though in order to better understand how it reacts to violent PA moves while the hourly bar is still open. Though, once a bar is closed, the WPR will mark it's level but nothing repaints. Most repainting indies come in MTF form. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #629 ---
Dear

if you use CheckOncePerBar to true you will not suffer any repaint from this system

but if you set it to false all indicator all over the globe is repainting within its time frame as Price change but all indicator used in this system doesn't repaint as the candle end , this system and all effort from TCO are very good

Please check all what i said by yourself

--- 帖子 #630 ---
TCO, Telac.  I have looked at the code for TCO_Trader.v1.3 and MACD_adjustible.  I cannot find source code for MACD3SS.  TCO_Trader.v1.3 does not sense the MACDline or the MACDsignalLine.  Rather, it looks at the histogram data and gives an uptrend of the histo > 0 and a downtrend if histo < 0.  So switching to MACD3SS will not make a difference in the Histo data.  The first question should be "is it correct to sense the Histo data instead of the MACDline/MACDsignalLine data?"  The MACDLine applies the Fastema and Slowema to the histo data, and is therefore smoothed data.  Similarly, the MACDSignalLine applies the Signalema to the MACDLine data, and is again smoothed.  The trend that one comes up with will be slightly different around the zero-crossover when using histo data vs MACDLine/MACDSignaLine data, because of the ema's applied to the histo data.  100pipsAday uses the cross of the MACDline and the MACSsignalLine as the trend change signal.  TCO_Trader.v1.3 does not currently do that.  This is the first question to answer.

If it is decided that the MACD lines should be used, then MACD_adjustible might be a bad choice.  The code has been re-worked by different coders and is not very clean code.  The buffer management is a mess, and difficult to follow.  I would suggest finding a different MACD indi -- maybe MACD3SS?

In summary:

1.  TCO_Trader>v1.3 does uses MACD histo data instead of MACDLine crossing MACDsignalLine as the trend indication;

2.  100pipsAday uses the MACDLine crossing the MACDsignalLine as the trend indication;

3.  In my opinion, MACD_adjustible is a bad choice because the code has been modified by multiple coders and is difficult to follow.

4.  If you want to use MACDline cross MACDSignal, find a good MACD indicator and sense the MACDline and MACDsignal registers to determine trend.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Dear TCO

your system isvery good one and in my opinion you can make update involve

when we set WPR confirmation to true it take an order once the WPR goes to OB and then to range area and this will take the order early roughly as we set it to false so we can let the order to be taken after % change(retrace) from highest level roughly 20% from the price not from the WPR indicator and the WPR must leave the OB area

i.e another confirmation to trigger order called

PriceAndWPRConfirmatin  mean price retrace 20% from high (for the last candle) and WPR leave OB area (sure this for sell and opposite for buy)

--- 帖子 #632 ---
Hi EasyRider, I read entire TSS Thread and 20%50ema thread and if I'm not wrong yes 100pipsaday does use mainly MACDLine crossing MACDsignalLine but he also said to someone else who asked that histo can also be used without any particular difference ... I'm also I don't see big differences ....

--- 帖子 #633 ---
This sounds very confusing. Right now you already have a choice where WPR must exit OB/OS levels for a trade to occur. You just set confirmed to true. When you set it to false it just has to enter OB/OS zone when in tick mode, or close inside the zone if set to bar mode. I think anymore choices then this will be very confusing.

--- 帖子 #634 ---
OK, actually I thought that this must be the case (because coding an ea without to use the magicnumber for each trade-manipulation makes no sense to me, because each time when if coded little mq4 snippets I had to identify them by the magicnumber). For me it is always important to know if an certain ea is manipulating other ea's trades. I have had allready some paid eas which closed manual opened trades.

I'll start tomorrow the third sceen strategy from 100pips with no traling stop with the SL / TP levesl from 100pips. I'll let the TCO run on 20/50 with SL / TP according to the ATR and with Closeonoppositesignal=true on the same pairs. I'll create two myfxbook-links asap to let you know the results. Thank you PBPTaker

--- 帖子 #635 ---
I agree with you.  I have spent more time than I should have today looking at the two (Histo vs MACDline), and agree that there is very little difference.

Oh, it's just my version of the EA for the 100Pips 20/50 EMA method. At the beginning of the 20/50 thread, I had fixed the problems that Khaled's EA had and had added some other features, several of which have now been incorporated into TCO's EA. It has worked well for me from the beginning. Once TCO introduced his EA and decided to share it on a thread, there was really no reason for me to do the same with mine, and I'm glad it never came to that. I'm glad to see TCO is going to put the cap on his EA after v1.4. Otherwise, I'm afraid some folks wouldn't be satisfied until it had 100 possible indicators built into it.  In my opinion, it's got PLENTY of features and options as-is and just needs to be tested thoroughly at this point to clean up any bugs or inefficiencies.

I totally understand what you mean & how to do; now, do you do that with 25 pairs / 50 charts on a regular basis?

If so, more power to you, I just cannot do it that way.

Much easier for me to drag & drop the MT4 broker folder to make an exact copy, run 2 instances of it, the profile is already there, open it, make a new chart with required EA, new Template, apply to all charts, save new Profile

I use the Change Template All, Script a lot, if I make any changes to my settings, indicators, chart, whatever, so if I lose the ability to do that if I have 50 charts open

And I'm not going to go along and apply new Template to 25 chart every time I change a setting

Thanks for you concern, E.

Bit of a train wreck this morning, no news or anything, so not sure what is driving this, profit taking?

Maybe turn around when Japan opens?

I will let it run, close to some stop losses anyway....

TCO and turtlefan

I had thought of writing you to argue that very point.

I am so glad you see it that way.

I have tried to run various settings, and to be frank, none worked as well as the settings that 100Pips and Kahleed had coded in their EA's.

I am very thankful for their pioneering efforts!

To go live however, I could not see my self trading what amounts to a "Black Box" with no Idea what lurks inside regardless of the great work and good intentions of the people who created it.

So to bulletproof the original strategy which has proven itself to work so far in some very favorable and also some very trying market conditions, is in my opinion the right thing to do.

I for one would rather be in a Land Cruiser than a race car for the long haul.

Thank you for all you do

Just a bit of a pull back hopefully A lot of pairs getting close to critical Supports and Resistance as well

--- 帖子 #646 ---
It has recovered a lot, now taking another breather a few hour before New Yaark opens

The IRONIC thing is, the early pullback gave ideal entries for anyone starting out with this method today

For instance, here is an account I just happened to start today to see if I can make 5% per week with the 20/50 method

Now if I closed everything now, I would have 4% in the bank and still 4 days left to make the other 1%

But I am also trialing a new Take Profit theory, so let it run and see what happens

Cheers, E.

--- 帖子 #647 ---
Can anyone tell me how does the 'Close After Percentage Profit' together with the 'Take Profit' settings works?

Does the trade automatically closes to whatever percentage stated of the 'Take Profit' amount?

--- 帖子 #648 ---
After the percent of profit you set example 5% from your balance is reached all order that taken from this EA will close even it in loss or profit ( totally profit ) without looking to TP you set it

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Sorry my brain is on a holiday. Need to put into numbers in order to understand clearer.

eg. Account Balance (equity): $1000

Close After Percent Profit: 5%

Once account balance (equity) reaches: $1050, All Trades open on EA will automatically be closed?

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Yes for all orders taken from this EA only  if you download the last version in post 1 (v1.3)

--- 帖子 #651 ---
Ok gotcha mate.

Thanks for the clarification.

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Hey TCO,

Where are you today? Big weekend?

Say, can you look at this chart, why it is taking a BUY when the W%R is on top at over bought area?

Had a break even trade earlier in the day and it bought at the over sold area, nothing changed

Thanks, E.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
Hi E, that is strange, not sure why it took that trade so late.  I see you are in an uptrend but that trade is at least 8 bars late.  Please keep an eye on it and let me know if you have anymore rogue trades like that.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Hi Guys,

Still slowly working on 1.4.   Very busy weekend with graduation open houses,  house work and yard work.   I will try to get it completed this week and either roll out this week or early next week.   Thanks for your patience.

Kind of funny how my Ichi Demo has kinda tanked, hovering around break-even at the moment and the EMA and MACD are doing pretty good.  It will be interesting to see how this develops.   Thanks for all the input lately.   I appreciate the guys answering questions on how the EA works.    TCO.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
Hi TCO, Is it possible to have the EA enabled or disabled tekst showing in the right corner in your next update 1.4? Thanks for your great EA, love the breakeven function.

--- 帖子 #656 ---
Hi Jasper, yes that is a good suggestion.  I will make it happen.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Hi Erebus,

It will be helpful for TCO if the expert log files can be examined on why the trade was taken today?

I believe the log files are found in "expertslog" folder with today's date as file name.

Cheers

Hi Sabbah, I have no idea which is better to use.  This is something you will have to work out for yourself.  Thanks!

TCO,

Thanks for your answer.

Just for reference, which one do you base your tests on (5 or 6 days chart)?

--- 帖子 #661 ---
I use IBFX and they do have a 6 daily candles for a week.  The Sunday Candle is from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM EST.  Not sure if it makes a great difference or not.

--- 帖子 #662 ---
Hi Guys, for those people here who wanted stochastics as an alternative lower TF signal - were you expecting the selection to be either Williams % or Stochastics...correct?    Not being able to select both at the same time.    Please let me know.  I'm ready to code the lower TF signal method with the new trend methods and I wanted to confirm that.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #663 ---
TCO,

To be able to select the use of either WPR OR Stochastics on the lower TF, to trigger the trade. Not an option to use both at the same time though. Wouldn't make sense. Thanks TCO

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Hello!

I wanted to reply to earlier inquiries regarding error 141 when using FXCM’s MT4 platform:

Error 141 is ‘too many requests’ and typically occurs when there hasn’t been enough time between the last request and a new request.  Mt4 is built to only send and receive 1 request at a time.  Sometimes you can get away with sending 2 at a time, but if your local MT4 platform is sending a request after request after request, within a handful of milliseconds, then it will generate error 141.

To fix this does require some modifications to the code, but essentially if the code is modified to only send a request when the previous one was confirmed, or delay each request by X milliseconds, then error 141 should be avoided.

Final thought is that if this EA is running on multiple charts, then there may be issues where the EUR/USD instance of the EA is sending a request at the same time as the GBP/USD and the USD/CHF and the AUD/USD and……  This will generate the same error even if each instance of the EA is only sending one order request at a time; this is because the MT4 platform is sending multiple requests at once.  And the solution is the same, either delay each request by a few milliseconds or have the EA wait until the last request was confirmed before sending another.

Hope this helps; best of luck trading to everyone!

Brad

--- 帖子 #665 ---
Thanks MK, that is what I was hoping.  I just going to make the lower TF toggles on or off.  If both are on, it will assume Williams %.    TCO.

--- 帖子 #666 ---
Hi Brad, thanks for you insight.  I might have to put some delay code in the order/modify sends.  I will probably target that for post 1.4.   TCO.

--- 帖子 #667 ---
Hi TCO. I'm testing your EA with great interest and high expectations. I like your approach with it.

For some days I noticed that the EA did not open that many trades as before until I realised that the max_spread setting was the culprit. By default the setting is set to 5 but most of the symbols have a larger spread. So I had to manually change the max_spread value, and I have lots of charts opened  What do you think about calculating the average spread between London close and NY close and then set the max_spread as a % or multiple of the avg spread?

I have also noticed an misbehavior of the ATR TP and ATR SL. Please see attached sshot. Some symbols show a working ATR SL and TP and some not. If you wonder, I have set 3 different copies of your EA each with a different trading method, but they all have the same SL and TP settings.

Thank you.

Aimak

--- 帖子 #668 ---
The reason only some pairs show SL/TP is that a trade has to open first before the SL/TP is calculated and shows in the settings. The reason it also resets back to zero is if you have to reboot MT4 or you lose an internet connection and it reloads. This has been discussed previously.

As far as max_spread settings, I think what you propose might just be complicating the matter. Just change the max spread manually, save the template and load it on each chart you have open. Simple solution.

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Yes, agree, too complicated, and how about use an ECN broker or at very least, one with decent spreads, maybe even don't trade those pairs - the max spread is there for a reason, save your cash!

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Dear TCO

all of us appreciate your effort and for sharing your system

when the EA close all orders in case of percent profit or percent loss or we close any order manually the EA will open another order at the same time specially which in loss as the WPR will be nearly at the trade mode

so the EA need sleep time before start trading for any pair closed either manually or closed from automatically from the EA

I'm not programmer but try to think so I think you need to look at the history orders date  with magic numbers before initialization

Thanks very much TCO for your effort

sorry for my language

--- 帖子 #671 ---
Hello TCO and everyone,

Still running V 1.0 demo, since 6-6 on 6 pairs. Running very conservative lots .01 nano units at IBFX and up about 3.5% account. Turned on breakeven and jumpstop last week, both are working beautifully. Breakeven profit 40 with breakeven SL 5 and jumpstop at 25 seems to lock in profit tight. First moves SL to 5 at 40 profit then sl 25 at 50 profit and so on. Too tight for swing trades but for tests the stop options work great. Will upgrade to new version soon. Thanks for the great EA!

edit: 3.5% doesnt look like much but with nano lots profits are 6000+ pips.

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Hi TCO

Can you pls share with us what are the settings (including take profit, whether its ATR/acct % etc) you used for your demo acct?

Have you started your own EA on Live? Do u leave it automatic or manually adjust it as well?

BTW: I just need the EA to attach to the chart and the rest I can copy to experts/indicators will do? (except the .txt files which are meant for my reading and understanding).

Thanks for this and your hard work to make 20-50ema more stable. I have since "discovered" that 20-50ema sometimes did not calculate the SL properly. Eg Sl=160pips, but the calculated sl would be like 170pips somehow. I would then look at my trades everyday and fix the SL manually. I guess the EA grabs the price at pt of creating the trade then use MT4 functionality of SL/TP to place those levels. If market moves very fast, then sl/tp will be relative to current price, and that accounts for slightly higher sl than 160pips set. Strangely the TP is always correctly set.

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Erebus

Again, thank you for this contribution. Instead of being pesky and asking all sorts of idiotic questions and bugging ppl with settings, etc, this time round, pls accept my contribution (although EA was not written by me). Its a powerful order management EA that allows you to place sl/tp, by symbols, close profit by pips/$, per acct etc. Its called swiss army knife. Pls download and used on Demo to try it.

Note: Original author has also included older versions for log purposes, so install the V1.51 and read the 2 page pdf included for your own understanding. Its simple enough to understand and only ONE ea to attach to experts folder. Place it on any chart, any timeframe, as its not dependent on tick data. It also does reverse trades (hedge) but its upto you whether u would like to let loose this logic.

Have fun, gals and guys

--- 帖子 #674 ---
I posted somewhere about not liking the look of the price action of EUR-JPY & GBP-JPY because the 20-50 EMA's had not crossed and wondered whether that should be part of the trend filtering, did you see that post TCO?

Anyway, I wasn't quite sure what the Close On Opposite signal would do but now I found out, it closes the current trade AND then the EA opens a trade in the opposite direction, awesome, you can tell TCO that it works

Here is the situation on EUR-JPY, on 1 Hour trading chart; you can look to your Daily chart to see how price is crossing the EMA's

Thanks, TCO !!!

--- 帖子 #675 ---
Hi everyone. First of all, thank you TCO for a great EA. I started testing on monday. I use EMA strategy and 14 pairs 5% total TP and 3% total SL.

--- 帖子 #676 ---
Hi Rainman, thanks for the report on the SL methods.  Good to hear.  I hope all continues to go well for you.    TCO.

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Hi YM, my settings are in post 1.  You can just rename tco_ema.txt back to tco_ema.set and put it in the experts/presets folder.  I'm currently using 6 hour delay on my demo accounts, but will probably go back to 12 when I go live.  So I have not gone live with this yet.  I was thinking of going live in July.  Thanks for your kind words.  Good luck.  TCO.

--- 帖子 #678 ---
Hi E,  I understand that you wanted the option for the EMA cross.  I have added that as a on/off toggle in version 1.4.  Thanks1

--- 帖子 #679 ---
Good Luck. I hope all goes well.  Thanks.

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Hi TCO

Thanks for this reply, I am that blur and didnt realise that u have given me the settings, LOL! TCO, I saw your post in reply to Erebus rgds v1.5, but its still 1.4, waiting anxiously,

PS: Its looks more stable than original 20-50ema and hope to have great results to share with everybody and also hope members of this forum would have a use for Swiss Army knife. Cool tool.

--- 帖子 #681 ---
Aw, MATE, you are awesome, I think that will be a reallu big improvement !!!!

Even with my short term. swing trading targets, eg. daily ATR, I figure that will screen out those pairs in trend transition (up to down and down to up)

And, no reason for the longer term traders not to use that, they have time on their side, and once they cross, the trend is (maybe) confirmed, so stick with the trade

Looking forward to 1.4

--- 帖子 #682 ---
ymleong, is there source code available for the Swiss Army EA?

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Markets are so directional - less, unless you count UP & DOWN as a direction?

How pathetic is this, I put on a "feeler" trade, AUD-USD, sell, main trend is down, between Frankfurt & London open, has never been in profit

So I turned EA loose, immediately I have 5 trades in profit?

Come on!!!!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #684 ---
TCO or Erebus,

Just wanted to find more info on the Ichimoku trend usage on the HTF. Is the trend based on price action being above or below the Kumo cloud? I think this is correct interpretation, but I just want to confirm. If this is confirmed then just want to make sure it is programmed in the EA as such. For example the chart attached.

--- 帖子 #685 ---
Erebus,

Can you please explain this intraday method of trading?

Your SL/TP parameters too?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
Hey MK,

You can use the Kumo cloud to determine the trend.  If above the cloud it is bullish, if below the cloud, bearish.  However, my EA is not using the cloud at all.  It  is using the Tenkan Sen and Kijun Sen for determining the trend.  Sometimes these cross under the cloud, where the TS crosses through the KS, but i'm using that as a bullish signal and sometimes they cross above the cloud where the TS crosses below the KS and I'm using that as a bearish signal.    Thanks!

--- 帖子 #687 ---
PA has sucked since FOMC.

--- 帖子 #688 ---
Mate,

Never traded Ichimoku, never even researched it, probably should in case it is good strategy, TCO will be the only one to help you here, sorry,

E.

--- 帖子 #689 ---
No problem at all!  I hope I was able to provide some help with the EA!  The other thing I though of after that post is that the 'delay' type logic that will make the EA work in a backtest is different than the 'delay' logic that works in live trading.  In the EA's that I've seen, for live trading they typically have code to handle a good number of error messages, maybe 20 or 30 error messages, whereas the backtesting logic may have some minor changes to order entry/modification logic.

Hope this helps, thanks again!

Brad

--- 帖子 #690 ---
OK. I've only had experience using the cloud in the past, but weren't sure how it is programmed here. No way for it to just have PA below or above the cloud, except doing it manually? I find it to be a very good trend identifier by just having PA either above the cloud for long or below for short. I use custom settings as you can see by the cloud on my chart.

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Which part? The feeler trade or the EA ?

--- 帖子 #692 ---
I have not coded it for the cloud.  In my backtesting using the normal Ichimoku trend determination of PA over cloud, PA over TS and KS,  TS over KS and CS over PA, it didn't do as well as just TS over KS.   Like I said earlier.  I'm pretty much done with new development for now.  I want to get 1.4 out with the 4 trend methods that we have and test it and get the bugs out.  We keep adding stuff and really haven't tested what we got yet.  Lets get a baseline for all the methods and the EA and then go from there.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #693 ---
Agree, but have you seen this surprise speech coming soon?

--- 帖子 #694 ---
The EA.

I see your SL/TP parameters are set for intraday, rather than longer-term as 100pips does.

I am interested in seeing how successful this is.

--- 帖子 #695 ---
Stick the EA on a demo account and give it a run, that's what I do!

You have been here long enough to do plenty of trial runs

--- 帖子 #696 ---
No, I wasn't looking for any more changes to the EA. I just wanted a clear understanding of how it was currently programmed. I'll just continue to use it manually on my charts. Really, it's not a big deal at all. Thanks mate.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #697 ---
Yep. I hate knee jerk reactions but whatever needs to move the market.

--- 帖子 #698 ---
Hi TCO,

the EA functions are working really good.

I use the EMA Version of the EA on all charts, where MACD D1 is in confluence (e.g see pic CADJPY). Before i start the EA on a chart i proof PA manual !

The DD is low. I got 8 trades (within 3.5 Days) -> all winners. It is far to early to say it works all the time, but with your future "EMA/MACD" Version it will work automated, so we will see in the next weeks ....

As soon as PA is near prev. Daily high/low (purple lines), or Weekly high/low (yellow lines) i put my AverageTrailing EA on the chart to trail all trades of the specific pair, so i dont loose any profit.

Cheers

Tebis

PS. Att. pic of trailing EA. Perhaps we have the TrailTradeExitOption in a future Version of TCO Trader.

--- 帖子 #699 ---
Can you attach a daily TF chart, and point out what your trying to explain about confluence? Are you saying you're waiting for MACD and EMA to be in alignment b4 you turn the EA on? thx

Cheers

--- 帖子 #700 ---
Thanks Tebis, for sharing.  Not sure what you mean by TrailTradeExitOption.   TCO.

--- 帖子 #701 ---
YES !

--- 帖子 #702 ---
He said he use a Trailing Stop EA after entering a trade, so that must be a setting within that EA, can we have same in TCO Trader is the question, I believe

EDIT: see picture, once you start that, it can get complicated too, so many options for trailing

--- 帖子 #703 ---
We already have a trailing stop option in the EA, are we asking for another flavor of trailing stop - based on ATR?    I know I have coded a previous EA a long time ago with ATR based jump,  BE and trailing SL.  I could try to find it.   However, that adds a lot of new parameters to an already bloated EA setup.  How many are really going use those added features?   Is it worth mucking up the EA with more and more external parms if only a few traders are going to use it.   This is what I'm thinking about.   So....team...what are you thoughts on ATR based jump, BE and trailing SL features?     Thanks!

--- 帖子 #704 ---
For me, it is just fine, I go for a target, get the target, be happy

If you make 1% per trade, believe me, you will not make much more using a trailing stop

If you are long term trader, should not be using trailing stops anyway

What I mean is, look to any of 100_pips methods and results

He uses big targets and stops, nothing about trailing them

Everyone is greedy and going for the one, big winner to save their account, not going to happen folks

Good night

--- 帖子 #705 ---
TCO,

it means an Option to "exit of trades with trailing of more than one trade" at the same time.

The Pic cadjpy shows

1. entry 92.041

2. entry 93.497

3. entry 93.598

Average is calculated 93.345.  PA is at 92.955. So we have an average of 40 Pips profit.

If i want to close the trades I put on the Average ea with setup minimum Profit 1$, so that the EA starts with trailing right away and trailing Pips with 5 pips. It closed all trades with 93.018.

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Yourself. pippy and Erebus have done a great job for sure - but isn't it all starting to get too complicated when the original 20/50 is working. Just my thoughts TCO. Trading should be kept simple. How on earth you guys manage to code these things is way beyond me! Maybe sometimes its better to go back to where it all started and think again. I trade cable mainly for a living and very rarely have more than two lines on my chart. Anyway the EA is good using the 20/50 still and up 47% for the month live. Wine bar time lol.

--- 帖子 #707 ---
The EA TP/SL parameters/options are more then enough. Don't make the EA unnecessarily bloated as it is not worth it.

--- 帖子 #708 ---
TCO,

The EA works pretty good and needs no more function. I just wanted to give you informations how i use your EA succesfully. I dont trail permanent. I started weeks ago with TCO EA and TSS EA on different Accounts. Unfortunatly I got the wrong timing and big DD. On June,19th you all know we got a big DD of 14% because of the news of Big Ben.

I thought to find the best possible entry to start the EA later with a live account. We all know: Livetrading is different.

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Can't be more agree!

Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication

Most of us focusing on settings, i haven't read much about Money Management using this EA

Claudia1, i prefer whiskey cola....especially Chivas Regal

--- 帖子 #710 ---
Hi Claudia,  I don't know how I do it either...it is magic.  Anyways.....I liked the EA in 100PipsADay thread,  I still have that EA on a demo $600 demo and it is up over $800 now,  except I wanted an ATR based TP and SL and I wanted to be able to close trades on opposite signal.   So that is why I developed my own.   Also, I like the option of being able to pick either the EMA or MACD for the trend.   I could see myself opening two live accounts - one for each method.    I have always been intrigued with Ichimoku and I wrote an EA for that and was doing some testing with that when I started reading 100Pips thread and thought that the Williams% signal on 1 hour TF would be a neat way to trigger trades using the Ichi trend, so that I why I made it a third option.  Actually for what it is worth, the Ichimoku did the best in all my back testing  So I thought it would have legs.     My demo accounts are only 13 days old and the Ichi is kinda lagging behind,  and the MACD is now doing the best, but it is early.   So....I think it is worth exploring these new  trend methods and we will have another soon, with the Turtle.  Not sure how that will do.   So there you have it.     That is how a bloated EA gets created.   Basically you have an EA that decides the trend and takes trades on the Williams%, soon another option...Stochastic...but basically that is all we have.   Decide the Trend...wait for the lower TF signal..boom..easy peasy lemon squeezy.    So I think as far as more trade management features....we will put a hold on that.  There are a lot of very good trade managers out there that can do the job.   Steve Hopwood has created an excellent one.  I really do appreciate the suggestions, but I for now.  I'm going to draw the line with what we have in the coming 1.4.   I will probably also try to include the order delay/confirmation changes so we can rid of those pesky  - too many requests errors also compliments of CK.

Oh yeah, as far as keeping it simple.  How simple is it..once you have the EA coded the way you like with as many contingencies coded for in regards to trade opening logic and  trade management logic and you just let the EA run as automatically as possible, with very little intervention. Knowing it is coded well and tight and should give you a good equity curve. I just can sit and look at charts all day...waiting for trades.  So this is my method..  It takes a lot of work to be able to do as little work as possible.   I think Bill Cosby said that.   Thanks!!

Trailing stop is built in TCO EA.

But if you use trailing stop, then it is no more 100pip's strategy. It become short term trading.

--- 帖子 #716 ---
MACD MTF indicator on hour chart is the same idea as shift=1 day MACD indicate.

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Not so.  If you run MACD on the daily chart with shift = 1, your signal is at least one day old when you see it.  One day old is a lot on an hourly chart.  If you approximate daily signals on the hourly chart by using equivalent MAs lengthened to equate to the daily chart (12, 24, 9 becomes 288, 576, 108), the one day lag in signal is reduced significantly.  I have been going to suggest to TCO that he mode the EA to use long MAs on the hourly chart, but he has enough on his plate.

--- 帖子 #718 ---
Question for you, TCO.  Is it possible to have the EA manage a trade that I add by manual entry?  I tried this, and the EA did not pick it up.  Maybe a magic number issue?

--- 帖子 #719 ---
Just for the record, there is discussion on using 20 / 50 MA for trading here, now they are up to how to exit?

Even read the last 20 or so posts, you will get the idea, be interesting to see how they evolve their method.

--- 帖子 #720 ---
Hi TCO,

Currently your preset (tco ema.txt) has the settings for profit %=3 whereby EA will close ALL open trades. Will behavior affect other trades (manual or other EA trades)? Shld I placed a magic number to ensure EA will try to behave itself and closed those that only belongs to it?

Coz swiss army knife affects whole acct, unless u specify the cur or EA magic number of comments

PS: LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT, it closed all my 20 trades with profits except 2 with small losses and I gained like 380+pips, which is abt 3% on a $100K acct. Its more stable this way, coz it conserve MR, and keeps profits in pockets, rather than having dragged the trades thru mud (sorry 20-50ema had a "habit" of either having like 1500pips one day and then trades got dragged to the muds and got like 100+pips next day, which meant trades got retraced A LOT!)

--- 帖子 #721 ---
Please explain how ANY trading strategy can be blamed for the pure price action of the traded pairs?

No, you can't, so therefore, what you are talking about is the right place to take profits or stop losses

And this depends on the trader style and objective, many times a long term trader will get dragged in the mud

Setting short term, daily targets is probably more your style as is mine

So I use ADR to take profits, and miss the MUD

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Erebus

Agree, so TCO_Trader has a smarter logic of take profits built in and LOL I can shelved the swiss army knife! TCO parm of acct percent meant trades may closed like 20-50pips but it doesnt get dragged into the mud for longer term!

PS: Although 100pips caution me against using 20-50ema on Gold, I got 7 out of 7 hits in my live acct and all went 320tp! LOL! This pair actually can experiment with 250sl and 500tp as this pair had gone thru like 1000+pips last week, cant wait to c whats it can do further and ROL! I am sitting on a "Gold" mine, I traded auto (full auto) on gold using 20-50ema. I have yet to test out TCO_Trader on gold, but it may close early coz of daily profit target that I set inside TCO parm (which is default to 3% which TCO has kindly shared with me his own person settings)

So those members want to try the original 20-50ema on Gold, pls do and set your own sl/tp, but mine has been sl=160, tp=320. Its DIY and no guarantees that just cos I got 7 out of 7 hit, it meant its a true super EA for Gold. Markets are not yours to control. Be smart abt $ mgt, and profits will be yours to had.

PPS: So far automated 3ss and 20-50ema can cause a heart attack if theres ur real $. Hmmmph....TCO must be have adopted your daily target style too!

BTW: Erebus, do u know whether EA is smart enough to only closes its own trades when profit target is reached (if I had set eg 3% within the TCO_Trader ea). I dont want it mess with my Gold trade by 20-50ema EA cos Gold had been hitting "gold" at 320tp and I dont want an early close off. In fact all my Gold trades have a 2-3 days "development" time and its kang-ching kang-ching

Hi every one,

Thank you for this thread and all the information that you had shared.

I have a question, by how much do you increase your lot size while your account is growing ?

--- 帖子 #724 ---
For some reason the ADR TP/SL isn't working ?

Any ideas on what I am doing wrong?

--- 帖子 #725 ---
Tok,

Every thread you're on, you ask questions that have been answered many times over and over and over again. I just answered this as late as a day or two ago. I'll answer it one more time just for you. Next time, please use the search feature of the thread or actually spend some time reading it. Out of courtesy for your fellow trader, you can't be doing this on every thread bro.

SL/TP calculation only shows in the settings display when you have a trade triggered by the EA. No trade, no SL/TP shown in settings.

--- 帖子 #726 ---
On the demo as linked in my signature, I am using 1% risk per position, so naturally, as the account grows, the position size grows accordingly

I may have started out too ambitious with 1% although the account was up 50% now only 30%

The market may start to move in our favor soon, either that or take losses and see if there is are new trend developing

--- 帖子 #727 ---
That was not what I was referring to.

I meant, even when the trade is triggered, on some pairs, it shows a 'default' SL/TP that I was using for my 3rd screen strat, and others it shows the proper ADR settings, as you said above.

Weird.

Hi All

Could anyone give me some advice on lot size?

I have the Dynamic lot size set to False, and want to increase the fixed lot size, but after I change it, the trades are still opening in the defailt 0.01 size.

Thanks in advance

Martin

--- 帖子 #731 ---
Hi EZ, the EA manages trades based on magic number.

--- 帖子 #732 ---
Toinou, there are 2 dynamic methods for increasing lot size as your account grows.

DynamicLotSize1 = false        - Set to true to have EA calculate lotsize based on risk entered on the next paramater

EquityPercent = 1        - Risk Percentage used in DynamicLotSize calculation

DynamicLotSize2 = false        - Set to true to use .01 per $1000 Account Equity

LotSizePerBal = 1000

LotSizePer = 0.01

--- 帖子 #733 ---
Hi UkMarting,  do you have DynamicLotSize1 or DynamicLotSize2 set to true or false or both.  What are the other parameters for the lot settings.  What is your account balance?   This will help us in determining the issue.   Thanks.

--- 帖子 #734 ---
Hi TCO

Thanks for your reply

The account balance is £920.00

Dynamic Lot Size 1    FALSE

Equity Percent    1.0

Dynamic Lot Size 2    TRUE

Lot Size Per Balance    1000

I have tried changing the Fixed Lot Size from 0.01 to 0.02 and 0.1, but still get the default lot size when the trade opens, however the amount I have changed it to is displayed on the screen info.

--- 帖子 #735 ---
Hi ukmartin,

I believe you should set both DynamicLotSize1 and DynamicLotSize2 to "False" in order for the EA to use the correct FixedLotSize you have entered.

Cheers

Hi TCO,

Am I right that based on demo, the MACD method seems to have more profit factor and slightly higher win%, whilst the EA had lower?

INTERESTING, u created 3 demo to test out the 3 most popular method include ichi

AWESOME!

PS: he....hee.., I just rename the tco_macd.txt to tco_macd.set and thats the settings u used for demo for MACD?

--- 帖子 #737 ---
EUR/AUD confirmed downtrend. Everything points to a turn to the downside. IMO, MACD with other filters to confirm higher trend is the best strategy. Good trading.

--- 帖子 #738 ---
Hi YM, yes that is my MACD set file...you got it.  Yeah it is kinda weird how the 3 demos are doing at the moment.  EMA started out red hot and Ichi did too..  Then Ichi kinda tanked and now has come back a bit.   EMA is tanking now...but maybe it just loading up for next trend extension...we will see.    MACD started slow now it is doing well.  I think that is how this system will be no matter what trend method you select.  You will have these pull backs and then extensions...just takes patience.   At least none of them are losing big time....yet....   I have my order delay set to 6 for all 3 methods, but I'm thinking about going back to 12.  I hope that helps.  Good luck.

--- 帖子 #739 ---
Thanks, TCO

I got fants results (which I uploaded) for Gold trading the original 20-50ema, maybe u would like to experiment with your won TCO_Trader EA? It works well with 20-50ema, but tanked big time with 3ss, NONE of my gold trades survived 3ss harsh logic, 3ss will buy, 20-50ema would sell, and 20-50ema would win. I also submitted a "court" case just for fun. 7 out of 7 hits, thats not to be sneezed at, and 1000+pips all automatically managed. What more do ppl wants? I told mark, who is also a member of 20-50ema, (in fact he intro me to the EA), that if he had a small capital, why not risk 10% of his capital to just trade Gold with 20-50ema and wait till his capital grows a little b4 applying 20-50ema to other cur pairs. You can go and check out my funnier than Santa falling down on his rump post regards Gold with 20-50ema http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...48#post6779048

Hi TCO

If the order hit stop-loss and the daily confirmation trend didn't change its mode , Mathematically WPR will be in trading mode so it will open another order in the same direction which hit its stop-loss at the same moment

so the EA need sleep time before opening another trade

Thanks Tco  for your hard work

--- 帖子 #743 ---
Hi MKFX,

Can you guide me. My chart is showing opposite then yours. It has buy order today morning. Yours showing down trend mine showing uptrend. I don't understand whats happening.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #744 ---
I had some errors in the past so I stopped using the trailing stop.  Is anyone using the trailing stop now?  Is it working well?

--- 帖子 #745 ---
You need to attach a daily chart so I can see what you're saying. Attach it as a file attach to the post. Don't attach as a doc file.

--- 帖子 #746 ---
Hi MKFX,

Thanks for reply. attached is the file. Also can you send me your EA setup. In two days my all trades went negative.

--- 帖子 #747 ---
Hi Sasco_me, why would it hit it's stop loss at the same moment it opened the new trade.  The SL would be reset once the new trade is created.  Please confirm.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #748 ---
Your EA is buying because your setup is using EMA trend method. In my post, I mentioned I was trading MACD method.

--- 帖子 #749 ---
Sleep time is you manually turning your EA off if you've determined a possible change in direction on your chart. Don't turn the EA back on until you receive confirmation of the change in direction. Even though you're using an EA to pull the trigger, you should always have some manual interaction with your trades.

--- 帖子 #750 ---
Hey Scott(TurtleFan),  I noticed by your trade explorer that your EMA hasn't dropped much in equity.  That is great.  I should have stuck with the 12 hour delay.  I think I will change mine back tonight when I get home.    Keep up the good work!!

--- 帖子 #751 ---
Yen pairs are very undecided and ranging at this time. I wouldn't be trading yen pairs until we get a clear direction. Just my op. Here's an example of G/J chart.

--- 帖子 #752 ---
Thanks for the kind comments, TCO. I appreciate it. Being a conservative trader, I opted for the 12-hour delay right from the beginning. Less aggressive, but much safer. On these types of days, you really appreciate that.

Sorry to say, but there are a lot of people learning hard lessons today. I have been warning about it since the day this method was introduced (mainly on the original thread), when I saw people using lot sizes that were way too large for their accounts. Greed has a way of blinding folks and causing them to throw caution and common sense to the wind. I learned those lessons the hard way back in my earlier trading days, and I blew more than one account in the process. Greed is deadly to a trading account.

I will take my demo's equity curve and profitability factor up against anyone else's in here at the moment. A lot of people like to flash their 30-50% monthly gains when the going is good, but you don't hear much from them on days like today because their accounts are getting hammered. And if you look at their profitability factor, it's just a disaster waiting to happen. I fully expect days/weeks like this, and I have prepared for it.

A word to the wise is sufficient.

Good trading, all.

TurtleFan

--- 帖子 #753 ---
Great post Turtlefan. I too use a 12hr delay.

--- 帖子 #754 ---
Hey...just way to be smart guys.  Great that you are sharing your methods with the rest of the team here.  My MACD is doing great at the moment, but i'm still going to switch that to 12 hour delay also.    Nice job!!!

--- 帖子 #755 ---
So...just curious.  The team members that were asking for the pipstep?   Are you using it and how is it working out if you are?   Be very interested to hear.   Thanks!

--- 帖子 #756 ---
I have had some success's recently using 1440 / 240 instead of 1440/60.  My thinking is 240 may need a larger SL, but is more stable. I have WPR True / confirming so the direction should be moving correctly.

I like EMA and Ich better than MacD

Just a thought.

--- 帖子 #757 ---
AUD/CAD looks like a confirm break towards the upside.

--- 帖子 #758 ---
Hi Gary, that is good the hear also.  It will be interesting to maybe try different trend method combos when 1.4 is released.  I wondered about the 4 hour time frame also for the lower TF.  Do you have a trade explorer setup?  It would be interesting to track your progress.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #759 ---
Keep an eye on E/U in next day or so. Looks to be some divergence on daily, plus PA is approaching TL.

Ditto on the Trade Explorer request, Gary. Would like to see how that setup is performing if you care to share. I do like the 4H charts.

Hi TCO

I have written at post 643 that I'm starting two demoaccounts together. One with the third screen strategy, and one tco-ea with erebus settings. Unfortunately, I missed the dynamic lot size setting, thus the tco ea did open bigger trades than the third screen which opened his .01-trades.

In my opinion both stategies are not really compairable, since the tco-ea according to erebus settings is closing all trades on 3% profit and 3% loss. So the tco-ea does his work in a mid-term view, and the third screen in a long-term view. Probably both used together on a account would be good.

Both accounts are in a small drawdown now. The tco-ea did start with 5% up, but is now about 3% in negative. The third screen ea went never into the posive, it has about 0.5% in drawdown.

@TCO: I wonder if closeonoppositesignal should close a trade if the signal did change? I mean if the ea is showing "current trend: UpTrend", shouldn't it close a allready openend sell trade on that particular pair?

Thank you

--- 帖子 #763 ---
Absolutely.

Here are my settings in case anyone is wondering:

Delay=12

Max Trades=8

Lot Size=0.01 per $1,000 in MINI account (IBFX, 50:1 leverage)

TP=350, SL=250 (every pair)

No trailing or jump stops, no break even adjustments.

Currently I do not close trades and open others on opposite signal. I fear that might lead to a lot of quick losses in a whipsawed market.

Entire basket closed at 3% profit. I do not close all trades at 3% loss.

Note regarding the Max Trades... Perhaps given that the delay is 12 hours, I don't know that I have ever seen 8 trades opened on one pair. I think I have seen 5-6 perhaps. The most trades I have had opened at one time was in the neighborhood of 110.

My goal is between 5-10% per month. Two months in I am at 25%+, so well over my goal. Planning to go live with these settings next week.

TurtleFan

--- 帖子 #764 ---
Thank you,Scott

Very useful information

--- 帖子 #765 ---
Thanks Turtlefan!  I'm very impressed with your results and as you have said, going for a more conservative approach will see us through the rough days we have had recently.  Can I ask... do you have WPR Confirmation to true?  Or do you just enter your trades immediately when WPR goes OB or OS?

Also I noticed from your trades that you do most of the majors and cross pairs.  When you go live next week are you planning to use all of these same pairs?

--- 帖子 #766 ---
I do NOT use the WPR confirmation. Entering as soon as it hits OB or OS, just like original method.

At this point, I plan to use the 21 pairs that I've been demoing. I don't typically like to cherry pick them, because today's loser might be tomorrow's winner.

Is the ATR based on a 14 day ATR? Just wondering if this is the same as what 100PipsADay had on his screen.

--- 帖子 #770 ---
Firstly, thanks for the EA and thread.

My feedback:

I am a tweaker and developer - so find it easy to change things to suite my own strategy.  Here is where my tweaking is at.  While I like the EMA20/50, I like TChaser strategy better (which uses 4 EMAs 8/12/24/72) and is therefore just a little safer on volatile days) - so essentially I added an additional method to the EA.  Also, having fixed BEs,JSs,TSs doesn't make sense, this should differ per pair and more specifically should also be a function of the ATR as is the case for the TPSLs - which I duly did.

Also while %R seems to work for most, I like a little confirmation on such a critical signal in the EA.  CCI(14) is just the man for the job since it almost duplicates %R but is a little more conservative/smoothed - which I also duly changed the EA such that both Williams and CCI must signal before it trades.

My results sofar:

I'm actually using a small live account ($1K; fixed spreads of 3pips on most pairs) and at this very moment stand at +10% for ~30 trades (only lost a handful) over last 48hrs - which were killing Icho and EA20/50 alike on the standard EA.  In general my TPSLs are much smaller, my trades finish much quicker, almost 0 swaps, still using 1440/60, TickMode, MaxOrders=2 on 11 pairs plus gold and I'm manually increasing lot from 0.01 upto now 0.05 as confidence grows.

Only "bug" I found thus far is that the EA will open a new losing trade immediately when it just lost a trade on a pair.  Meaning, the trade is lost, Open Trades is now 0, but instead of waiting OrderDelay it opens the next trade in the same direction immediately which it then obviously also lost.  Happened to me today when I lost a $20 Sell NZDUSD at 6/26 12:00 hour and then another one right after it (an order which opened and closed within 2mins on the same bar even though my OrderDelay is set to 6).  If not for this, I would have been +15%. The primary reason for this is that OrderDelay only works on currently opened trades. So if there are no more open trades (because it just lost the one it had), the EA is free to put another losing trade in the same direction if the signals allow.  Is the primary reason I brought in the CCI as a safety measure.  This may not necessarily stop the issue, only a proper delay after a trade closes of OrderDelay time will.

And I'm still tweaking....

Happy pips e1!

--- 帖子 #771 ---
Greenster,

Sounds like you have some great ideas, I especially like the setting of the BE in relationship to the ATR as I use ATR for my TPSL all the time.

Have you contacted TCO about any collaboration on EA development? I am assuming you used his code as a starting base for the changes you mention; please correct me if wrong.

Once finished, do you plan to share?

Thanks, E.

PS: Looks like I may change the demo account to MACD settings after last few days correction & most claiming that was handled better by MACD method

--- 帖子 #772 ---
This system works great, the only thing I have against it is there is no defined exit points.

I'v been trading a different style and noticed that my entry points could possibly be this system's exit points.

last night I looked at my charts, closed the EA's open positions and took 5 manual trades shown in screen shot( basically I trade the MA's cross on the MACD), 4 out of 5 are in + area

I normally look for the trend reversal. Ill show it on charts, I entered based on the weekly, I could have gotten in earlier on the 4hrs .

Since this system has re-entry points,  I feel that trading my normal lot size and exiting periodically is no problem.

with enough brain power(which we have present) we can figure out and exit strategy, I really enjoy this system.

Cheers,

Jad

--- 帖子 #773 ---
I am still running V 1.0 but I will be upgrading this weekend and will give pipstep a good run. It should limit exposure during ranging days.

Also turning on the BE and Jumpstop are doing a good job of limiting exposure as well.

--- 帖子 #774 ---
Erebus, no not yet and yes of course.  My idea is to optimize it best I can without losing the original idea of having a very adaptable EA which can basically used on any pair with trust while not being fearful or greedy.  For this I need time, while my tweaking may be good at this time, it may also tank in the next 48hrs or 48 weeks in different market conditions.

Since TCO put a copyright on the EA, but effectively handles it as open source, I see no harm in going with his original idea in sharing everything with the community.  However, I do not want to confuse things here with another branch of TCO trading. So unless I'm satisfied that my branch can beat the standard version (1.3 at this time) consistently, I'll keep the risk on my own account instead of spreading and risk to everyone.  Also why I use a live account - so that my tweaking is effectively felt being either sweet or painful.

Also I'm still, as my nic implies, a newbie trader (3 months). Best case I think would be to share with TCO only and have him incorporate into the main branch anything that seems worthwhile.

PS: Another one of my wildhair scheming ideas is to have the EA automatically squeeze existing trades - that is, while starting out with a trailing sl, the more the trade gets into profit the closer the EA makes the TSL (initially we may start at 50pips trailing, but after having made 100pips, we only use 20pips trailing, etc), and more importantly to have a Leading TakeProfit, i.e. the more we get into profit the further away I put the TP (initially we may start with a 100pips TP, but as we get to 90pips, we move the TP to the original 100+10pips for ex.)  This way, if things go your way, you may very well get 150pips from an original 100pip trade - without taking too much risk since the SL is also following closer now.  Of course, your trades are then guaranteed to be stopped out 100% of the time since your trade can never reach the moving target (TP).  Only time you will ever hit TP is if the PA moves too fast for the EA to adapt or your MT4 is not running.

Dear fellow trader,

Dear TallCoolOne,

For the first, I'm sorry if my english not good ,

This is my story,

I've been following the discussion about this EA for some time,

I am the traditional trader who does not like EA because I have had bad experiences with it,

So we finally decided to start looking for the "holly grail" of our own,

Initially we were alone trade, passed the peak and valley forex candlestick daunting,

We divide the 12-hour trading time for each person because forex running 24/5.

I know we're still a beginner, but management has always been our savior,

though in the end we are in a sideways account of his own and tends to fall.

Finally one of us gave up, of course, unpredictable and that is not me.

I then fend for themselves, forming their own system until I find a system that I think works.

It's been 3 months I use this system, it has not produced because there are still some that are less.

But there is only my problem, I'm not a robot that can trade 24 hours a day.

Until it finally arrived, I posted, arguably also the outpouring of my heart,
I have to make my own EA.

So, for all the friends I want to ask, is there a guide to make EA can I learn?

If there is please let me know, send the file to me, I would be very grateful to you.

And if this system really works, I will contribute back and I would love to take you with me.

I respectfully,

Chandra.

--- 帖子 #776 ---
Hi Chandra

Your English is good! If I were you I'd write out what you want the EA to do and there are some very good coders on this forum who will do it for free. If you really want to learn it yourself http://book.mql4.com/ maybe a starting point.

Good luck whichever way you choose to go

--- 帖子 #777 ---
Thank's claudia1 ,

I know many good coders here but I will build it with learning the code,

because if there are a changing from my idea it will be difficult to confirm the coder.

--- 帖子 #778 ---
Basicly you're saying; Let's not use a TP... If you can't reach the target, why use it? Lol

Hi TCO

Thanks for your reply may be i can't express what i want i'll give you an example

assume if the EA open buy order EURUSD at 1.3050 with sl @1.2950 and TP@1.3150 in this case trend confirmation either MACD or MA cross or ICH will be in buy mode and WPR will be in OS

in case the market go against us and EURUSD go down and SL triggered at 1.2950 in this case we have the probability that Tend confirmation still in buy mode but 100% WPR will be in OS

so the EA will open another order at the same time the previous order closed

So all the EA need is sleep time before open another order

THANKS TCO

Salam kenal rockrobb,

Yes and No

You still want the TP to be there though, for these cases:Quick Spike in the market which happens faster than EA can change your order You temporarily don't have internet access MT4 is not running Better to have the TP there to bank the profits than missing the opportunity altogether?  Without TP all you have left is SL.  Moving TP just out of reach in a normal slow trending market though, may just earn a few more pips than you originally planned on. Of course, if you trade 24/7 and manage trades actively and is emotionally stable, you do not really need either SL or TP!

Hi HG,  I bought this book about 3 years ago and it has been very helpful to me - Expert Advisor Programming for MetaTrader 4.

Check it out here: http://www.expertadvisorbook.com/

--- 帖子 #784 ---
Hi Sasco, so what you are saying if we have a trade close (profit or loss?) we want to use our normal OrderDelay from the closed trade before opening a new trade?    Is that correct?   I can see what I can do.  I have queried the closed trade history before.  I don't think it will be too difficult.  I will could see if I can get it into 1.4

1.4 update - I'm close to being done ( I think..I hope).  It appears that all the trend methods are working.  I'm also allowing the trader to select all 4 methods for one chart if they want.  It looks like stochastic is working, but i'm not seeing a big difference as compared to WPR%, but this is backtesting, maybe forward testing will show a difference.  Also with the help Darkgsg, I added the order send/modify delay logic to avoid the 141 errors.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #785 ---
Correct. Forward testing will show a BIG difference in behaviour of stochastics in comparison to WPR, not back testing.

Pretty pumped up, can't wait for v1.4 release. Thanks TCO.

Hi TCO,

My AUD/USD sell trades are still open? I use MACD as trend, the trend has shifted to up, but my aud trades are still open and I have Closed on opposite signal on? Should the EA not close my sell positions on the Aud/usd?

--- 帖子 #787 ---
Hi Jasper, did you get the appropriate opposite trade signal with the Williams% on the lower TF?

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Hi TCO

Thanks exactly that is what i want

--- 帖子 #789 ---
Thanks a lot, Great thank's to you, TallCoolOne,

--- 帖子 #790 ---
No, only MACD Daily trend has changed. As we speak the trend on the Aud/usd has switched again to downside on the daily with MACD method.

If I understand correctly then not only trend change but also W% has to give a signal in opposite direction before trades will be closed by EA?

--- 帖子 #791 ---
Hi Jasper, close on opposite signal means if you have buy trades open. you will need to have a sell trade signal to close all the buy trades.  Since you only have a trend direction change, and not a trade signal yet, the EA will not close the trades yet.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #792 ---
Hi All,

Firstly thanks to TCO, for this thread and well sending me the EA and other files before even this thread was started. I am pleased to see this thread grow and carry on the wonderful and easy strategy which was put forward by 100pips, and thanks too all the active contributors, you all know who they are

As for coming to the test phase of this EA, my observations are that this powerful EA has lot of potential, but I've not been able to get my head around using it properly as I've been testing other EAs so far, and meanwhile the versions have updated here.

I restarted a demo acc yesterday, and I am experimenting with '5 - long only/6 - short only' trend strategy options. I am using two extra indicators from FF to make sure I am on correct side of daily trend, and yes I am here to share and care for all, but don't want to mix up and add more indicators so not posting anything to make it confusing. Feel free to ask by email or if TCO is happy, I am more than willing to share it all.

My thinking is as below:

After going through good and bad phases of trend strategy demo accounts, I've realized that I won't be able to make each and every pip out of the market, but if I learn how to make most of the pips without giving back any, I'll still be in green at the end of everyday/week. With this thought I moved on to understand the trend, and how to know if it is long or short  . Now this is a question which has million answers and million questions, but I am just going to pick the one I feel comfortable and go with it. And I believe from my reading and trials of various systems that people on FF have already done a wonderful job at answering this question.

Once, I am confident of the long term trend which I've identified on daily charts, I am going to unleash the TCO EA for either long only or short only trades. For now I am thinking of 6 hour time delay and max 2 positions, these would be with fixed TP and SL.

With 2 positions I hope to be opening and closing min 1 and max 2 positions in 24 hours. I am thinking of experimenting with TP = 2 ATR, and SL= 1.5 ATR, or a similar proportion. Thinking behind this is that if we are on correct side of long term trend, we are less likely to hit SL and more likely to hit TP. As we'll be constantly hitting TP or SL, we'll also constantly be opening new positions, this way bagging all the pips and not exposing ourselves to sudden reversal and wiping out loads of pips due to multiple positions.

As I said, this are all thoughts right now, I am going to wait for ver 1.4 and start new demos and may be live trading someday.

This won't be completely automated strategy and I am happy to intervene once a day or more if markets go volatile, I am happy to do this because that way I am in contact with markets and constantly updaing myself with information and making sure I am keeping eye on each pair for reversal. I have also accepted the fact that making money isn't as easy and so happy to put in hours I can to make it full time job and also work fulltime as I do now to make it even more profiting

I'll wait to see what everyone else thinks about above, and I might keep editing the above (for good) as my brains keeps sending more ideas to my fingers

All the best..

I would just like to present another example of how using stochastics instead of WPR can improve your entry within the TSS strategy. Attach is the E/N charts. First chart shows where stochastics was not yet fully in overbought zone(both lines) but trade was open based on WPR even with my settings of OB/OS zone at -10 and -90. It was also open a couple of bars earlier meaning WPR already touch -10 OB zone. Had I taken the pics when the trade was actually taken using WPR like it shows a couple of bars back, stochs would probably be even further down from where it presently sat when I took the still shot. In fact as you can see price action continues it's uptrend and position moves into negative DD over 55 pips even though stochastics hasn't even entered OB yet.

Second chart shows my manual entry at OB zone using stochs where both line pretty much in Ob zone and have leveled off. Using stochastics would've prevented at least over 55 pips DD and only one position open instead of two.

This is just an example of one pair. I can attach examples of multiple pairs and the results would be the same. Add the DD to the amount of pairs you are trading and you're talking about triple digit DD easily.

Hope you guys find this helpful.

--- 帖子 #794 ---
Yeah I sort of agree and disagree lol. Don't like stochs. I'm using 20/50 still with success. Going off topic a bit I trade cable and today was a good example of pure price action trading using pivots.

--- 帖子 #795 ---
I agree. This is about the EA and it's efficient usage within Dr. Elder's system.

--- 帖子 #796 ---
To give fair representation of the W%R, don't forget that the way the W%R enters quickly on some trades has been addressed with TCO adding the confirmation setting in his EA.

Here is my exact entry shown with that setting in use, about 32 pips draw down thus far ; how does it compare with your stochastic?

--- 帖子 #797 ---
My manual entry is 1.67448 and I have posted an updated chart. Didn't go into DD very much when I took the actual trade. This IMO is a the most optimal entry. I'm not knocking WPR at all. I'm only pointing out the comparison based on Dr. Elder's suggestion of using Stochastics instead of WPR. He considers the use of stochastics as conservative.

--- 帖子 #798 ---
Hi MKF,

You gave a good example of how it works with the stoch (stochastic) approach.

There is however another side to this coin : You will miss trades because the stoch will not reach the required lines -20 or -80. In that case, you might miss a good trade.

A few examples happened just a few hours ago :

1) Buy cadjpy at 9172 6 at 1800 hr.

2) Buy audjpy at 91.10 at 19:30 hr.

For both trades, the stoch did not make it, but the regular ea took the trades.

Both these trades are 25 to 30 pips in profit at the moment. of course it is difficult to say what the endresult will be.

What I want to point out however is : It is very difficult to compare both methods and to make a decisive choice for one of them.

The stochastic approach :  more conservative, less trades, less drawdown  ( less profit perhaps)

The usual        approach :  more aggressive, more trades, more drawdown ( more profit perhaps, because more trades).

--- 帖子 #799 ---
That may be true in some instances, but personally I want to trade as efficiently as possible, by taking the conservative approach. Since It allows me to trade many more pairs, my risk is spread out more evenly. So in the end, it all works out, IMO. Besides, my order delay is either set to 8 hours or 12 hours. I haven't decided yet. Trading with these higher delay time, I want to achieve the most optimal entry as possible. I'll take quality over quantity any day.

Good to see you on the thread here. Cheers

Hi, TCO,

Q1) Do I have to apply the template or is it ok if I just placed all the TCO templates, indicators into respective folders and the EA will trade as usual? Unfortunately my vps cpu=1gb and with 5 MT4 running in parallel, its going like an old guy climbing a hill. (instructions said: Apply template, attach ea etc)

Q2) Ok, this is totally silly, but I assume if I select ema method, then it will behave like 20-50ema, except that I got add'l stuff like ATR for sl/tp which I can used and Profit % to close all open trades. Similarly, if I select MACD it will behave similar to 3ss?

Q3) I have try searching, but I think my post was yet answered. Will the ea when closing all open trades (if profit % is set) only closed its own trades, or do I have to set a magic number to enforce the rule?

--- 帖子 #808 ---
Hi

Excellent thread TCO!  Although a forex junkie for many years, this is my first post at FF.  I have been looking at the 20/50 EMA method and can see huge potential in the simple format of trading with the trend and entering on pullbacks (which is what the method is attempting).   However I wonder if the main problem with the system is inevitable huge drawdown when the tide is turning...? In other words the winners look after themselves, but when you are fighting the tide, using Williams % confirmation you can load your cart with lots of bad apples that all go on to lose big-time.

I wonder if anyone out there can look at adding a standard setting supertrend indicator line (MA period 10 and step 3) to the hourly chart as another method of trade entry (as is currently the Williams % OB/OS).  My thought is that in a downtrend, for example, you place a pending limit to sell at the supertrend value line.  Once a trade is entered, you wait until the price breaks the now lower supertrend line before placing another pending sell order at the new higher supertrend line.  In other words, you cannot enter a second trade until the price has gone some way in your favour and broken another lower supertrend line.  The advantage is that you won't miss any Williams % confirmation entries (indeed the entries might be more finely tuned) but when the price continues to move against you, you won't be adding to a losing trade.  I am not a programmer and would love for someone to just add the ability to set up a pending limit order at a given indicator value.  Often the supertrend level is around the Williams overbought/oversold levels anyway, in fact very rarely would you get a worse entry level, it is usually better.

I have used supertrend for a few years and tended to use it not on the initial break of the line but on the pullbacks to the line.  I have found with the hourly time frame that under 100 pips should be sufficient for a stop loss before I am questioning whether the logic of the trade is still valid.  I use the xsupertrend indicator, from this thread: www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=329399.  I have tried to upload the indicator below but don't know if it has worked (first post at FF!!).  If not, the indicator is in the first post of the thread.

By using maximum trades per pair of 2 with a 6 or 12 hour gap between trades, you should get most of any reasonable move, which would also limit exposure massively from the potential of 8 losing positions.  For example, take a look at the GBPAUD hourly chart over the last week.  Williams % would have got you into many losing positions, whereas using the supertrend indicator level as a limit buy would have resulted in one loser only as the upper supertrend line hasn't been touched/broken until today (setting up a new limit buy).

Just drop the indicator on a chart and eye-ball it for yourself.  I have merely looked at placing limit sells at the supertrend line when the price action is below the MA ribbon on the hourly chart with stops of 80 (a bit more for the kiwi/aussie crosses with higher ATR's) and targets of 200. I am not trying to change the system/strategy at all, just my two cents to attempt to still give us the good trades but eliminate some of the bad ones.

Hats off to TCO and all the other contributors on what is currently the hottest thing here!

--- 帖子 #809 ---
Good to see FF back. Didn't realize how addicted I had become.

I'll see if I can answer these. TCO can correct me if I err.

1) The EA does not rely on the template for its operation. You could put it on a plain chart with no indicators, and it should still function properly.

2) You're overcomplicating things. The beauty of this EA and all its settings is that you can combine any number of varying parameters however you wish. Sure, you can model it after the original 20/50 EMA or the 3SS by choosing the corresponding settings, or you can come up with something very unique that has not been tried before. It has enough settings to keep us busy testing for quite some time.

3) I believe in v1.3 (current version) the EA will close ALL trades on your platform regardless of magic number. However, I *believe* I remember TCO saying he was going to code v1.4 so that it would utilize the magic number to do this, so it would then be possible to have trades from a different system that would not be closed by the TCO EA.

Hope this helps,

TurtleFan

--- 帖子 #810 ---
The magicnumber option is already included in version 3.

Unfortunately, the default at this moment is 0. That means, at this moment, without further notice, all orders with magicnumber 0 will be closed.

Orders produced from your direct manual trading also have the magicnumber 0. So, these will be closed as well.

What you must do is : change the magicnumber to some number unequal to zero (for example 763659) and recompile the source file. Then you are set.

Otherwhise, take extra care everytime at startup and change the value of variable  "MagicNumber" manually.

--- 帖子 #811 ---
Ah, didn't realize it had already been implemented. Thanks for the correction. I don't do any other trades on my demo so had not had reason to use it as yet.

Hi, YM.  I think Scott handled the questions for me.  Thanks Scott.  But just to confirm.

Q1) Do I have to apply the template or is it ok if I just placed all the TCO templates, indicators into respective folders and the EA will trade as usual? Unfortunately my vps cpu=1gb and with 5 MT4 running in parallel, its going like an old guy climbing a hill. (instructions said: Apply template, attach ea etc)

No template or indicator is necessary on the screen.  But if you are using bar mode, you need to be on the lower TF chart.

Q2) Ok, this is totally silly, but I assume if I select ema method, then it will behave like 20-50ema, except that I got add'l stuff like ATR for sl/tp which I can used and Profit % to close all open trades. Similarly, if I select MACD it will behave similar to 3ss?

You don't have to use ATR based TP/SL, just an option.  You don't need to use Profit % close either.  If you set  CloseOnOppositeSignal  = false and WPR_Confirmation = false, then it should operate very much like 100PipsADay 20/50 EMA strategy.  The same with MACD, should operate pretty close to 3ss.

Q3) I have try searching, but I think my post was yet answered. Will the ea when closing all open trades (if profit % is set) only closed its own trades, or do I have to set a magic number to enforce the rule?

Version 1.3 should close trades based on Magic Number.

I hope that helps.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #814 ---
S3 Signals,  interesting approach.  Maybe this could be a future enhancement along with Greenster's tinkering.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #815 ---
I'm still curious about the results from H4 TF - Seems to give more steady results to me

--- 帖子 #816 ---
Could you post a chart to show where you would avoid trades and where you would take a trade ?

Thanks.

Here is my chart of gbpaud H1 at this moment together with your indicator.

--- 帖子 #817 ---
THANKS TCO and Turtle, yes should be busy with those different style of trading, I am not testing ichi, but testing both macd, and ema methods. I want to set WPR=True to see whether it will increase the profitability. TCO, pls keep us in loop rgds V1.4, I did not output the text on screen, but I assume since I downloaded abt a few days ago that the link is for V1.3. Pls let me know how I could check this

Thanks again for the clarification on closing when profit % is set to true, will note this and set a magic number to enforce the rule.

Hmmphh....wonder, if I placed used both methods on same acct but different pairs, how it would look like?

I kinda noticed that 3ss demo acct had like sell for eurjpy, but 20-50ema had buy eurjpy, hmpph....INTERESTING, 20-50ema is positive, while the 3ss is negative, but some trnx 20-50ema had like sell and 3ss had buy and of coz when these opposing "decision" happen (trades were opened same day but different timings on both demo accts), its either 20-50ema that is positive or 3ss.

Rexio

I have GBPAUD as a potential buy only as per 20/50 daily EMA's the pair is in an uptrend (hopefully I am reading this right!).  So my pending limit buy would be at the current supertrend level, around 1.6447 on your chart, about where one of your sells was initiated.  I expect if the price ever gets down to the supertrend level (the line will go up as new highs are made), the Williams % indicator will be showing oversold and TCO's genius programming would grab it anyway.

Hope that helps.  As GBPAUD is motoring upward, the supertrend has level has now risen (another hour completed) to about 1.6455.  So you would need programming to keep updating the buy level if necessary.  If tends to only rise if new highs are made otherwise it flat-lines.

To upload a chart, do I save it as a jpeg pic and just attach it with my post?

--- 帖子 #820 ---
rexio,

I have been looking at that chart too, here is my 2 cents, as you don't say which method you are using for trend on DAILY, I must mention that I look at this for long trades using the 20/50 EMA method

So, since late last Friday, price is below the SuperTrend, so it looks good to ignore all W%R Buy signals all week, and using the break upwards of the SuperTrend would be an excellent BUY and in the direction of main 20/50 EMA's

S3 mentions about using Limit orders to enter, not sure if he would pick this trade up then as it not returned to the now lower SuperTrend line?

I'll be looking at it on the weekend some more I think.

--- 帖子 #821 ---
Hi YM, release 1.4 is close.  I decided to add an option to have an order delay after closed trades too.  So, I'm testing that.  Also, had to tweak the screen display a bit, since now it will be possible to select more than one trend method, I had to make sure the trade comments and screen status were displaying that information correctly and the information for Stochastic also.  I hope to complete it this weekend and roll it out before the new trading week starts.  Thanks!

Hey Big E, where did you trade explorer go?  I see EMA is bouncing back today.  I wanted to see how your account was recovering.

--- 帖子 #826 ---
It is still there but my signature gone; I will fix it now, darn FF had big problems today

--- 帖子 #827 ---
I was using the MACD approach.

That confuses the discussion, as I see the pair gbpaud in a downtrend at the moment.  MACD D1 is below zero.

--- 帖子 #828 ---
In that case, you are looking for SELL, then I can see 2 entries early in your chart, same place as the W%R signals, where price pulls back to the SuperTrend and a Limit Order would trigger as S3 has mentioned

Have to wait for him to confirm, how do you see it?

E.

--- 帖子 #829 ---
Rexio what are the indicators in your chart?

--- 帖子 #830 ---
Hello TCO

This is my first post on FF.  So, G'Day (equivalent to 'Hello' in Australia) to everyone on this thread.

Firstly, a BIG 'thank you' for all your effort in putting this EA together.  It is simply fantastic!

I have two questions based on the chart attached.EA has opened two trades but the trade comment is registering open trades as only being one. Order delay - I understand this refers to number of bars before EA will consider another trade.  However, EA opened another trade after only three bars. Would appreciate your taking a look at this.

Once again, thank you so much for all your wonderful work, TCO.  This EA is a keeper!

Have a wonderful weekend!

--- 帖子 #831 ---
Wow, I have been running a full demo for EMA and ICH, both have been underwater all week, but Wow! Today they exploded in profit!  So I have got to learn to keep my hands off and let the EA do its thing.

1)  W%R second chart .

2)  xSupertrend(10,3)  from S3signals.  You can find more information about this indicator at :
http://www.xaphod.com/supertrend-ind...etatrader-mt4/

ignore the arrows. They do not belong to this system or EA.

--- 帖子 #833 ---
Erebus, you're spot on.  My buy signal was before rexio's chart period using the 20/50 EMA trend confirmation.  Price came back to 1.6444 (supertrend level) on the 19th June before it flew up 400 pips.  Since then on the 21st there was a buy at 1.6717, which (depending on your trade management) was a loser (after being up over 60 pips) and no new trades since.  I have a pending order limit to buy, currently at 1.6461.  One thing's for sure, the supertrend line will get hit at some point.

Per rexio's chart where he has his sell arrows, the supertrend line above them would have been perfect place for him to enter (I wouldn't have because it was against the trend using 20/50).  Per his MACD system maybe it was; I don't follow that strategy.  It is surprising how many times the price touches the supertrend line and bounces.

--- 帖子 #834 ---
Thank you for your answer and your time. today was a really nice day. I will keep demo your EA, and thanks again for sharing.

Have a nice weekend.

--- 帖子 #835 ---
Hi S3 signals,

If I understand you well, your approach is as follows:

a) 20/50 ema gives the main trend direction. Right now, for example, this is Long for gbpaud.

b) Entry on a touch of the xSupertrend. First touch would be the green line at currently 1.6461

Is that correct ?

Which timeframe do you use ?

--- 帖子 #836 ---
Totally correct.

However, I tend to determine whether trend is up or down based upon the MACD ribbon on the hourly.  I don't know if this correct, but seems to give a good approximation to the bigger picture on which to base my trade, rather than go to the daily each time which is a pain. If you were really smart, you could optimise the parameters on the supertrend to get the best outcomes.  That, however, is probably the subject of another thread and another way to waste one's life.  For example, if you reduce the multiple from 3 (to say 2) you will see that the line becomes tighter to the price action and gives you more hits (trades), but also potentially more losses.  The standard parameters of 10 and 3, is fairly calm and distant so less noise.

If placing pending buy/sell orders at the supertrend was ever incorporated into the EA I would as happy as Larry, whoever he was.

--- 帖子 #837 ---
What is this : "MACD ribbon on the hourly" ?

--- 帖子 #838 ---
Sorry, my mistake, MA ribbon, not MACD.  When I loaded the TCO v1.3 from page 1 some time ago (I'm not sure if it's the current EA still) the template appeared with the filled in MA ribbon already there, which is presumably the 20/50 MA's on a daily shown on the hourly.

I am familiar with xSuperTrend, (good indicator) but what indicator is giving you the arrows?

--- 帖子 #841 ---
Thanks for this. Looks like it is doing well for the first two days, but we'll need to see it run a lot longer before drawing any conclusions on its performance versus the hourly. Being a turtle, I've always been a big fan of the longer timeframes. Incidentally, what are your stoploss settings? Any different?

TF

--- 帖子 #842 ---
So far which strategy are you inclined to believe will lead the pack?   I am favoring EMA, but according to the Trader Explorer it looks like MacD is setting the pace, or am I reading it wrong?

--- 帖子 #843 ---
S3,

To carry on with the SuperTrend conversation, (hope TCO is still cool with this?), why not go all out and determine the Daily Trend from SuperTrend also?

Case in point, the GBP-AUD example as used previously, trend changed on Daily on 5 April 2013 and we should look for entries on 1 Hour chart ever since.

I have studied SuperTrend indicator a lot also, mainly on 4 Hour, and have noticed this point on ALL time frames - it often allows a second chance entry at the same level of the break after a retracement

See the charts, first for April change and then yesterday's 1 Hour chart, so I didn't have to look far to find this price action; you can look at your own charts and see this very easily.

So, looks to me SuperTrend would keep us out of the recent pullback on Daily candles, but still give great & safe entry signal on 1 Hour chart yesterday - very interesting.

I am with you about using an EA to take SuperTrend trades but I go more for the break, not the pullback method you mention, you would have missed out yesterday on this chart.

Regards, E.

PS: TCO, can you see a v1.5 coming in the future?

--- 帖子 #844 ---
A few more charts to elaborate the SuperTrend possibilities

You trying to complicate things busman! Hey have a look at GBP/JPY on the 60 min - the chart looks a bit messy but its in consolidation ready for a break. When this thing goes it can be fun. Good luck!

--- 帖子 #846 ---
No, this is way too easy!

I have been looking at all the charts, yes, GBP-JPY has been confusing both MACD & 20/50 EMA methods due to messy up & down action (ranging)

On daily it is RED, so perhaps something will be clear next week, watch for it, nice round number 150

Thanks

--- 帖子 #847 ---
Erebus

Interesting take on determining the daily trend.  However, I think we should be careful about changing the essence of this thread, or hi-jacking it.  TCO's EA is great; all I was looking to do was to refine an entry point without Williams %.

Also, your suggestion to take a second bite at the trade after a break would miss a lot of trades where the supertrend line is touched but not breached(I'll try to post charts later today) .  I would say that in my experience, the best, best trades arise from a bounce where the price action dips past the line but doesn't close in breach.  Your suggestion would miss these.  yes, the example you quote was missed, but there will another place higher up later to get on board (hopefully that doesn't lose!).

Thanks for your efforts.  I feel a separate thread coming on sometime!

I think we are now in setp 10 the life of a system in forexfactory.

"10. It’s just that little thing left to do! After a while, noticing that a large number of people posting in the thread get mixed or even bad results, someone has an epiphany. All we need to make the system really great is an indicator or something to tell us if the market is trending or ranging. But not yesterday or last week or last hour. What is it GOING to do next?"

http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=347075

--- 帖子 #849 ---
Yes, that's right!

For me it is because: I have time on my hands, I am great with MT4, it is raining out, it is week end, and stuff

Plus my real account, while being UP 13% per week for the previous 3 weeks was pegged at 0% last week, so there is my bad result

So, yes, maybe doubt the system

Anyway, no a big deal to screen all trend determination methods is it?

After all, if traders could agree on definition of trend, this trading would be so easy!

--- 帖子 #850 ---
I really would like to see some trade entries as you suggest because I can't see them.

Now, first thing, I am not saying to take second bite, I am just observing the price action, it moves in waves and does often retrace back to the recently broken SuperTrend line......... so IF you missed the opportunity and felt the risk was right, then, understanding the price action, a nimble trader could enter if he wanted. Also, the retracement entry is what we look for and in the cases shown, it is definitely a confirmation of trend continuation.

Second, I don't understand where you say I would miss a trade when line touched but not breached? If the line was in the direction of the main trend, trade entered, line not breached, then price must reverse and take out the stop loss - how is that missing a trade?

This is why I need your chart examples, take the GBP-NZD, for me that should be entry now as Daily is Green for long, SuperTrend is hit on 1 Hour chart, you say to wait now for retrace back to lower SuperTrend 150 pips for entry?

I guess that plays in with my retracement observation, so if it doesn't get your entry, take the original break entry on the way past with stop order.

We see what happens next week

--- 帖子 #851 ---
I've had a chance to look at the Xsupertrend on various charts and can see it as a possible addition to the HTF trend. Though, I would hesitate to incorporate it's use on the lower TF to pull the trigger. The result is not as efficient as my current usage of stochastics as the trigger. Of course, unless you want to use supertrend on the lower TF to trigger trades on breakout in the direction of the HTF trend. In this case it would just be another trading strategy altogether. I also didn't see much in a way of difference when comparing it's use to the daily 20/50 EMA method. I'll post a pic of an example of E/A daily chart below.

This is making the system a little too complicated for me. Let's K.I.S.S.

Agree - the original 20/50 works for me. If it works why change it. Like all systems/strategies you will get bad times but......... I dunno leave it as it is lol.

--- 帖子 #853 ---
I have two charts covering all trades on GBPNZD in June.  I use larger stops for GBP and EUR crosses against the kiwi and aussie dollar, as ATR is usually much greater than other currencies I track.  I use 110 pips, but you might want to make it 125 pips or more.  My target is generally 2.5 times my risk, or 275 pips in this case, and I tend to move stop to break even after 110 pips.  All other pairs can usually live with 80 pip stops, depending on volatility.  It is crucial for me to get my stops down to the leanest I can live with without hampering results, as it allows me to make targets lower, and enables me to get more out of my initial risk.  I tend to risk 1% per trade, so I would rather enter a trade knowing that I can lose 1% over 100 pips, than to place half the stake size risking 200 pips and have the trade potentially tied up for longer. For such a large stop loss on an hourly chart to be hit might denote a change in trend and if not, then I should still be able to get in at a better price after taking the loss. Everyone's approach is different.  C'est la vie....

In summary, there were 7 trades.  3 winners, 3 losers, 1 break even.  That equates to a return of 4.5% for June from this pair.  Much fewer trades than using the Williams % I agree so probably a lower return, but then I haven't tied up anywhere the same amount of capital.  So, like for like, I consider it less stressy when things are turning against me.  If I could achieve just 1% a month from each of 12 pairs, then I am would be over the moon.

I have uploaded 2 charts.  Not done this before so hoping it works.  If it doesn't, hopefully someone will educate me.

Erebus

Sorry, forgot to add that 2 out of the 3 winning trades in June would have been missed if you waited for a breach of the supertrend line.  In contrast, you might have escaped one of the losses.  The bounce from the supertrend line tends to give good trades and if your stop loss is at a sensible distance then it should give you enough leeway to buy at the line.

Hope this helps.

Perhaps if discussion continues, should start own thread.  However, I firmly believe in what TCO has created here in a fantastic EA that I now use.  It is that that has started me thinking on refinements that might make it even stronger, rather than to create something else.

Good weekend to all.

There is no trend definition that will always be the best. Personally above/below D 50 RSI level has been a good rule of thumb. The legendary EA writer Steve Hopwood (now gone elsewhere) always wrote that into his lower TF EA's as a standard filter. Almost sorry I brought that into the discussion.

In the example you give with the supertrend entry, there would have been significant drawdown (most likely hitting stops) compared to when the 20/50 buy signals kicked in. So 20/50 would have been better there. Daily MACD cross is often quicker than above below the 20/50 ema's and of course those trades often work out fine. Though not always, if I recall D MACD on EURAUD is signalling sells and of course we are still happily buying above the emas.

Use another strategy whilst waiting for your preferred trend method to kick in. All you can hope for is to have something that gives you an edge and wait for it to kick in. You can back test and find numerous examples when 1 trend definition beats the other, you'll probably drive yourself  trying to figure it out. Like I said no 1 trend definition will always give the best returns IMHO.

--- 帖子 #856 ---
A quick observation.......the entries are pretty close to the trend indicator.....if it can be programmed to close the trade once the bar closes on the other side of the trend indi......then this can be a great r:r system.......according to this pic....we would have to investigate it deeper  with other pairs of course in case it is just this pic that looks good......

Thanks so much to everyone (especially 100pips, TCO and Erebus) for their work and contributions with regards to all these related strategies. I'm currently setting up my own VPS demo account to start trading on Monday.

1. I would like to get your comments/recommendations with regards to the "Close trades on opposite signal" setting, not sure which will work out best (or worked the best in the past). I have tried some backtests with Strategy Tester but it is incredibly slow. I'm a bit scared by it opening and closing many losing trades in ranging conditions. I believe 100pips just leave trades open until they hit TP/SL and just ignore opposite signals but would like to get your thoughts?

2. I'm a bit stumped with money management , (one of the reasons I will just demo this, would prefer less than 30% drawdown) - do you think this is reasonable: $5000 account, 20 pairs, max 4 trades each, 12h delay, 0.01 lots, leverage 50:1 (max on my Oanda demo acc)?

Will appreciate any comments/advice.

--- 帖子 #858 ---
I still think you would have missed 2 of the 3 winning trades in June if you waited for the line to be breached. However, on the flip side, the first loss would have been avoided and replaced with a win.  So still better to be buying at the line I would think.  Needs a bit of testing and chart-searching.  There will always be examples of winners and losers with any system.  For example, with the TCO EA, it is often a better entry if you enter when the first candle closes in OB/OS, rather than when the indi closes after it has pulled out of OB/OS.  Probably the same with supertrend, I don't know.  Placing limit orders at given levels is simple and works for me.

My main point here (with suggesting supertrend) was to investigate an indicator change that would still give us the winners, as the TCO EA does with Williams %, but to AVOID the large drawdowns that will inevitably come with Williams % (as we have seen earlier this week).  It seemed to me this week we were adding more weight to the boat whilst trying to row out against an incoming tide.  Will end up on the rocks at some point with more losses, rather than manning the boat with just a couple of oarsmen and, hopefully, catching the turn.

Erebus was up over 52% at one point in his Trade Explorer and now is at 15%.  Still great figures, but if you had pushed the boat out for the first time when at 52%, you would be currently down 37% (I know he has high risk stake sizes but it is still relative to whatever risk you take).  If that was you, you would not only be bailing out your boat big-time, but you'd be bailing out of this system and, sadly, be moving on to yet another imaginary 'holy grail' system somewhere.....the curse of failed traders everywhere.  Losses are inevitable, but to give back two thirds of what was made is the true potential cost of this system as it stands.  Even if you were trying to make 10% a month and set your stake sizes much lower than Erebus, you might be down 6% - 7% already, and your belief in the system would be severely challenged.  When, actually, I think it is nearly a fantastically successful system.

Two cents from a boring Saturday.

What is "HTF" ?

--- 帖子 #861 ---
higher time frame?

--- 帖子 #862 ---
It was rainy here also. So there was time to create what I call "the entry line" . It looks like a compromise between S3signals and Erebus.

The solid line in the chart is the xSupertrend indicator.

The dashed line is the line, where I would like to take an entry after the break.

Red dashed : short entries.

Blue dashed : long entries.

As example chart , I chose GBPNZD, H1.

--- 帖子 #863 ---
And here, especially for Claudia2, as she mentioned a possible breakout scenario in GBPJPY :

The chart in H1.  In theory, I would be in a long position  at 150.56 right now with this method.

The SL around 150.14 somewhere as this is the reversal area.

Thank you TCO. Can't wait to test drive. A couple of questions.

When is Stochs OB/OS? Both K and D have to touch or close in OB/OS zone, or just K? Also did you mean slowing not show in the stochs 14,3,3 settings?

Can you elaborate on closed order delay? How does it work?

Thanks TCO

Some interesting ideas here, and I appreciate your thoughts and insight. I'm always open to hearing alternative entry/exit tactics. My initial gut feeling on this is that your suggestions would really just mean fewer entries (though perhaps better entries), which would certainly serve you well on a potential trend turn; however, I think it would also necessarily mean you would not be building up as many positions when the trend is in your favor, thus capping your profit potential on those runs. It's the same old trade-off that we always must make. It's a matter of finding settings that will give us adequate/acceptable profit without risking the farm in the process.

There are other ways to limit risk and downside, though. One is to use the 12-hour delay, which is what I have done in my demo to this point and plan to continue. The others, of course, are position size and max positions. I also bank profits on my basket of trades every time 3% profit is reached, clearing all stranded positions off the table. In the almost two months I have been testing, my maximum drawdown from top equity achieved is 3.6% and from top balance achieved is 1.4%. That's pretty darn good and definitely something I can live with. Granted, two months of success does not guarantee anything, so all may change in the next month, but I'd certainly rather be in this position after two months than the alternative. As Claudia said, why try to fix what isn't broken? I think with the current system, you go in knowing that you'll have trending periods of making money followed by intermittent periods of ranging where you give some back. Like other trending systems, this should be looked at as a long-term method, and panic won't get the best of you.

TurtleFan

--- 帖子 #870 ---
That's a good post and thanks for my reference. 20/50 works if you let it but as you say it's a longer term method. Basically I'm a day trader (ex bank) but I like it and up 46% or so for the month on live account. Why change? For sure there will be draw downs but it is a very simple system.

--- 帖子 #871 ---
Hi MK, It should be both K and D have to touch or close in the OB/OS zone.  I did mean slowing.  Order closed delay works just like order delay, but it uses closed orders instead of open orders.  This will stop the EA basically from trading a pair if it had an order close within the delay period.  If you don't want to use it, just set it to zero.

--- 帖子 #872 ---
AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME

Congratulations on a superb piece of work, and many, many thanks.

Even though you worry about it becoming bloated, the user settings panel remains clear, concise and easy to use.

The finer tweaks of Activate EA, EMA crossed, MACD on HTF are seamlessly integrated; a pleasure to use.

Everything is in this EA, trend selection, choice of entry, position sizing, take profit & stop loss, what more can we possibly need?

I will switch to this on my demo account, let the current open trades do what they will do, from then on there will be fewer trades due to new settings.

Thanks again TCO

Just wanted to share an interesting analysis I just completed on my results thus far. Of course we know this system is most vulnerable at the trend turns. If we're trending more than we're ranging, we're making good pips and good money. Listed in the attached PDF are each of the pairs I have traded so far, along with how many trend changes each had in the past 54 days, along with number of pips gained/lost. I define a trend change by a close from one side of the 20/50 to the other (has to close across both). If a pair had two or more crosses of the 20/50 (daily TF), it was deemed non-trending over the selected period. That all said, here are some basic observations from the results:

1) Of the 21 pairs traded, 12 (57.1%) were trending over this time period.

2) Of the 9 pairs that were considered non-trending, 4 of those actually finished with positive pips (nice!).

3) The average gain for trending pairs was a positive 2,729 pips, while the average gain for non-trending pairs was a positive 206 pips.

4) The average gain for pairs that finished with a net gain was 2,414 pips, while the average loss for pairs which had a net loss was -268 pips.

In summary, when there are at least *some* good trends running, they will more than make up for the non-trending pairs' lack of performance. I was pleasantly surprised to see that even some of those pairs that had changed directions multiple times still were in profit in the end. All in all, pretty encouraging, I think. The question is whether half of the pairs will be trending each month. Doubtful, but hopefully the method can at least keep its head above water in those off-months.

Enjoy the rest of your weekend!

EMA Cross, just what it says, does the 20 EMA line cross over the 50 EMA line

Often you will see that price can spike above both lines, but they have NOT yet crossed, a trade may be entered but then price decide to go down (or up) again

Or the market is ranging for a few days or weeks, some above, some below, look at your charts

Why to make it true? Up to your trading style, aggressive, leave it as is, cautious, make it true as it is more confirmation of trend

Not sure about the Comment question; can you explain more details or where you see this mentioned?

Hi Mr. TCO,

Thank you so much for releasing EA v.1.4, it is while that i am watching this thread but now decided to apply your EA on Demo and share its result with you.

Just a question, i am sure that you explained it somewhere but i couldn't find it, what are the files with .txt and where and how they have to be used?

tks a lot.

Hi Turtlrfan,

That is an excellent analysis. This puts a lot of faith into this system provided the markets keep on trending. In this strategy some of the pairs are always trending so their gains are far more (remember we are also using multiple positions) at the end of the day than those which are ranging. At the end of day it is the overall design of this strategy that brings you many many more pips.

Thanks to TCO for putting all the risk and trade management features into one EA.

Regards

--- 帖子 #882 ---
Thanks for the analysis TF. Is it possible for you to share your settings and how you handle TP/SL? I remember you saying that you just wait until one or the other to hit. Thank you.

Fxarcher (or anyone else),

Back in post #590, you showed your EA settings and had the input window enlarged so that you can view all of the input settings.  Can you let me know how did you enlarge that input window in MT4?  At the moment I can only view about 8 input lines at a time and can't find any option to resize the window.

Thanks.

Just click on the image a few times I just did and could see it all clearly. Don't understand it but can read it. That's a lot of pips to lose I'm sure TCO will point in the right direction.

Hi guys,

i have a short question regarding the profitability of TCO' EA. I'm currently experimenting with TCO's EA sind 2 weeks or so and i'm trying to find some good settings. However, if i do some backtesting with the EA i can't get a linearity regarding the profits.

If i do find some settings, that are good i.e. for the last half year and i'm trying the same settings for the last 3 years there is never a big plus to the profit how you would expect it with a good EA in terms of linearity.

Am i thinking here in the wrong direction?

BTW : Yes I'm new to trading.

--- 帖子 #886 ---
Thanks Claudia,

But what I meant was actually in the MT4 program, when you have the input window up and are entering all of the external parameters for the EA.... how to enlarge that actual window in MT4 so that I can see more than just 8 lines at a time?  (as below)    Fxarcher and a few others seem to have done this as shown the in previous posts and I was just wanting how they did it.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #887 ---
Good points, turtlefan, well reasoned and compelling.  Can I ask you what you risk per trade and what your return has been to compare against your drawdown figures?

Generally, I agree with the principle - if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  Personally, if I could achieve comparable results with just 2 trades rather than 5, I would.  Just my preference, because my original stake sizes would be higher than if I foresaw that I could go 5 trades deep before I come up for air.  It is personal preferences, I realise that.  I just would feel happier with a 10% monthly return with potential for a 10% drawdown, rather than a 50% return with potential for a 50% drawdown.  Can't see how you can have one without the other.  In other words, higher risk clearly leads to both higher returns and higher losses, at different times.

I (very quickly I might add) eyeballed the 12 pairs I have been following with this system, but trading up to 2 signals per pair from the supertrend line and arrived at a return of 40% for June (only a first cut look, say 30% then!).  That was risking 1% per trade, stops of 80, apart from kiwi/aussie crosses at 110, and targets of 2.5 times risk per trade.  I don't know what the overall drawdown was, but I would guess no more than 10%.  June had some cracking good trend breaks (especially for kiwi/aussie crosses) so perhaps one swallow doesn't make a summer.  I am not looking to change the vehicle here, the route or add some new fancy sunroof or sound system - just toying with tweaking the suspension so it's a softer ride FOR ME.

I expect when we all have more forward tested data, it will become obvious the pro's/con's.  In the meantime, still many thanks go to TCO for the work and creative mindset that has got us all to this point.  Happy Sundays.

Just wanted to say a huge thank you for all of your hard work and how helpful you have been to everyone here.  It really is much appreciated.

I was using version 1.3 last week and was very happy with how it all performed.  Really looking forward to trying out version 1.4 this week.

One thing I can't seem to figure out though....  Just loaded ver 1.4 onto the charts and for some reason the screen display will not show.  I have made sure that Show_Settings is set to true and the DisplayColour is one that is visible against the background of my charts.  The only thing that shows is the small TCO_Trader and smile face in the upper right corner, but nothing else.  I've tried it several times and can't seem to get anywhere.  Haven't changed any other settings in MT4 from when I was using ver 1.3  Any suggestions?

Hi Mohsen, the text files are my set files for the three demos that I'm running, one for Ichimoku, 20/50 EMA and MACD.  FF won't  allow us to upload any files with a .set extension.  So we rename them with .txt.  If you want to use them, just download them and rename them back to .set and save them in your experts/presets folder.  Then you can load those setting to the EA when you drag it to the chart.  I hope that helps.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Tech10Ken

I use a program called Snagit. They have various Screen capture modes, this one is called Scrolling.

So to be clear, you can not use it to open and modify the Input settings in the Input window,but I do use it to print the Default settings out. I then create my other test settings in columns the the right which I name and I then save in the .set files after modifying the Input window. That Window like many other features in MT4 is designed to make things hard on you.

I have also used the "Input Resizer" which I got from Steve Hopwood's site. It comes as an indicator and EA and it resizes the actual input window. Check it out first at http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?p=3831885.

I have recently stopped using it, even it was very helpful because I have some problems on my main computer which I am trying to trace and identify.

One other trick item that I find extremely helpful is a small program I use all the time called CrossHair By Richard Janowicz. It lets you put a crosshair on anything...Screenshots, pictures, anything that appears on your desktop. You need to Google it.

Hope this helps

Hi Pret, I was pegging the RPMs on my CPU also.  I started trying different things, changed the bar history and bars on chart to 5000.  That didn't work. I removed the turtle and stochastics indicators, that didn't work.  The only else that I changed from 1.3 was that I added XAGUSD chart to my portfolio.  When I removed it my CPU went back down 01 or 02 for my mt4 terminals.  That might not be the issue for you, but if you are trading XAGUSD, you might try removing it and see if that helps.   Thanks!

Hi there, S3. I know exactly where you are coming from, and appreciate your wanting to keep risk in check. I feel much the same. My goal is to average 5-10% per month. I would be tickled pink to get that consistently because I fully understand and appreciate the power of compounding. I'm not looking for 25-50% per month gains because, as you said, you can expect to have drawdowns of the same size at some point, which I want no part of. In the two months I have been testing, I am getting about 13% per month, so a little higher than my target. The drawdowns, as mentioned, have been only 3.6% from top equity figure. If I eventually feel that the risk is too high, I will likely address this by moving from 8 max positions down to 5 or 6.

By the way, I didn't mean to suggest that you should stop experimenting with different settings or other indicators to maybe find something even better than what we currently have, but I'm just wondering if it will in fact show any improvement in the end. TCO will have to decide whether he eventually wants to add supertrend as another LTF trigger or not. I know for the moment that we have plenty to play with/test in the latest version.

In any event, wishing you a week full of pips,

TF

EURGBP can't make up its mind which direction it wants to go. I am going to leave it on my demo but not trade it on the live account. I think my general plan of action going forward will be to leave all pairs on the demo account, and remove the worst one or two from the live account and then re-evaluate the situation each month. Once a pair starts trending a bit more, it gets promoted back up to the live account.

Hi TCO
I installed the EA v1.4 on demo accounts with IBFX (16 charts) and FXCM (8 charts) without any problems.
But when I started to install it on ActivTrades I got also problems with the CPU. I could only manage to install it on 3 charts. With the next chart the CPU gets problems and under the Experts tab there is the message: shutdown by timeout. That might give a hint.
But it is weird that it happens only with this account.

Yeah, I'm not sure why the high CPU usage. I put some print statements in the EA today.  It it wasn't even cycling through any of the logic...but I was still getting 25 % cpu usage per mt4.  I would expect that the print statements would show up because we aren't receiving ticks at the moment. but why the 25 % cpu usuage.  When I dropped XAGUSD, it went back down to normal amounts.  So I don' tknow what the cause is.  Hopefully we can get it straightened out.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #921 ---
Something doesn't seem right. I have 16Gb ram and my cpu usage is hitting 100%. Also the turbo fan is kicking in and properties is not allowing me to open the EA to make changes. This is all that shows up on my chart once I rebooted MT4. Any idea?

Add: Just FYI-When you delete the EA, object 16-20 stays on the chart and doesn't clear with the rest of the settings. You have to go into objects list to clear. When I go to add the EA back onto the chart, it shows the smiley face but no settings and you cannot pull up the properties of the EA to make changes. It also kicks cpu usage to 14% with only one chart with the EA attached. No problem when I delete and replace with v1.03.

Hi pret

Hi MKFXTrader

I now made the charts big and I also found these items on the bottom still on the chart with the EA removed.

There is a typo in the mentioned function. A for-loop without a break-condition.

Thanks for your help with that Fxarcher.  I understand all that now.  Much appreciated.

I see. I'm sure TCO is looking into it. That's something he needs to fix as I know nothing about programming.

--- 帖子 #929 ---
You may have got that from the other site, but it originates from here

http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=299017

Which is a mote point because the best option is to run RESIZE ENABLE  as described in that thread

http://download.cnet.com/Resize-Enab...-75447319.html

Input Resizer can & will hang your Metatrader platform just when you least expect it, and can least afford to be re-booting it

This I have found out for sure

--- 帖子 #930 ---
Thanks Erebus.

I originally thought there might be a simple option within MT4 to resize that I just wasn't aware of.  I think I'll just leave everything as it is.  It's not that important and certainly not worth any potential problems it might cause to Metatrader.

--- 帖子 #931 ---
You can run RESIZE ENABLE with no problem, it is for Windows and helps with all programs not just MT4 - just read about it at that cnet link

--- 帖子 #932 ---
Hi TS, this would explain why I was getting high CPU usage for XAGUSD, since I didn't have a previously closed order so there would be no break out of the for loop.  I will make the updates that  you suggested and repost version 1.4.  Thanks for your guidance.

Thanks for your reply, turtlefan.  Can I ask what percentage of capital you risk on each trade?  I think by closing at 3% this might have a major positive impact on your results (could be very relevant for all of us), so could I ask how many times your basket of trades has been closed at 3% in the two months?

Thanks and impressive results!

Hy ... I'm trying new 1.4 for many pairs EA  doesn't open any order.

Look at above screen  i suppose it's the right moment to open a sell order... What's wrong?

Any suggest?

--- 帖子 #939 ---
Hi TCO and/or PC Experts,

I'm using 2 accounts with 25 pairs each an same PC, everything seems to work properly (only FF pages are loading slowly), CPU usage 10-20%.

I have a lot of open positions, should I still update to the "new" EA 1.4 (just corrected by TCO) or remain on the "old" one. If updating...how to do, simply override or delete and attach the new EA? What happens then with the open positions?

Many thanks for support and help!

cheers, jdva

--- 帖子 #940 ---
5 posts - how long have you been using MT4? have you used an EA successfully before now? checked all the MT4 settings?

EDIT: you don't mention which strategy we are using, they don't all give signal at same time; and that chart, too busy, maybe it is TCO template, I don't know, I didn't use it, but really you need to narrow the indicators down to just the ones you need for the time frame you are on!

--- 帖子 #941 ---
Thanks TCO the CPU is down to normal now

--- 帖子 #942 ---
Hi jdava,

The new EA should continue to manage existing trades as long as the trade strategy/Take Proft/Stop Loss/Trend method/William%R values settings are as per your old EA.

Else, you can close all your trades in positive pips and start the new EA version fresh.

Cheers

ck

--- 帖子 #943 ---
Hi TCO,

in addition to the earlier mentioned typo in the code

the new "last closed order delay" - logic is buggy:

see "Bars since closed order" is 0 or sometimes -1 when there is no closed order with the magic number

so there will be no trades taken, unless there are earlier trades with the symbol and the magic number

jdva,

you can deactivate the logic with ClosedOrderDelay = -1 or 0

TCO,

one more thing: the trade history is often randomly sorted, the first hit is not the latest in your logic

best regards TSGarp

Hi TCO,

Thanks for everything. Love your new 1.4EA. Today morning I have loaded two charts for E/U one with your new template & new EA, second with EMA indicator only. I feel both chart should look similar as far as D1 concern, but they are not. Why I don't know. Can you please guide me. I am not professional like you. Appreciate your help.

Bomi

--- 帖子 #953 ---
Yes , they look indeed different. One is black, and the other is white.   That is not good.

--- 帖子 #954 ---
Hi Bomi,

If you are talking about the appearance of the chart they are different because of difference in formatting, i.e. colour of bars, background colour etc, which you can change if you right click on the chart and select the last option 'chart properties' I think, I am at work so can't do it for you and send you screen shots.

If you are talking about the data, I think they are showing exactly the same data.

Please let us know what you are referring to when you say they look different, is it the data or is it the appearance of the chart ???

--- 帖子 #955 ---
Hi Bomi,

I don't know what exactly you want to compare. You must look in the template what indicators you have with which parameters. Then, you can compare that with the other chart in the same way.

The first thing I see, is that you have the EA attached to a daily chart. I think, that should be an hourly chart.

Also, the stoch and the W%R belong on the hourly chart , not on the daily. So : switch to hourly !

And here is a job for you to do : Check out, which parameters are needed for the daily MACD.

--- 帖子 #956 ---
Hello Bomi

Your second chart is correct in the first chart the EMAs arent 20 and 50 EMA review your settings

--- 帖子 #957 ---
I think he's talking about the different EMA looks - I am wondering this myself aswell.

I want to start testing some H4 settings with EMA+MACD in 1.4, i know i have to change the "60" to "240" from the LTF signal. But do i also have to change numbers in the EMA settings, when i want to trade a higher TF?

--- 帖子 #958 ---
Thank you guys for reply. I have attached the screen shorts in word file. My question is - first chart has template with MA ribbon filled 2x14 indicator into it & second has only indicator attached. (MA ribbon filled 2x14) but in the first chart PA is above the MA ribbon, While in second chart PA is below MA ribbon. Both charts are Daily.

--- 帖子 #959 ---
tested Stoch with following setup in v1.4:

extern string  Ss0 = "-- Stochastic Settings --";

extern int     Stoch_KPeriods = 13;

extern int     Stoch_DPeriod = 1;

extern int     Stoch_Show = 2;

extern int     Stoch_OB = 89;  // Overbought level

extern int     Stoch_OS = 13;  // Oversold level

extern bool    Stoch_Confirmation = true;  // Stochastic signal signal must go below and then above OS for buy and must go above and below OB for sell

extern bool    Use_WPR = false;             // Signal Method Selection

extern bool    Use_Stoch = true;

USDCAD open buy trade stoch @ 30

AUDUSD MACD say it is Up-Trend

it seems it doesn't work properly, will test more and post results

--- 帖子 #960 ---
Nothing wrong with stochastics as I have positions open based on parameters. How did you come up with those Stoch settings anyways? If you're going to use those settings, mind as well just use WPR.

Also, A/U is downtrend based on MACD.

Add: E/U just opened short based on Stoch. I saw it live, as both K and D hit OB line. There's nothing wrong with stochastics function.

--- 帖子 #961 ---
The problem with the MACD D1 of AUDUSd is :

At the moment , the MACD is in a transition from negative to positive. Therefore, during the day, depending of the price, the MACD will sometimes be positive, sometimes negative. The signal will be stable, once the daily candle has closed.

Therefore, it is very well possible, that you get a short execution, based on a negative macd and a half hour later you see a positive macd  in the chart.

By the way : For AUDUSD, based on the MACD D1, there is a major reversal going on from negative to positive.

I say MACD , but in reality I mean : (macdvalue - signalvalue).

--- 帖子 #962 ---
Hi TCO

I have no longer problems to take trades with the new version using the FXCM demo and the EA is running fine in 3 different demos.

I thank you for all the work and also thanks to all who gave hints and help.

--- 帖子 #963 ---
Hi Mones, you shouldn't have to touch the ema settings. if you change the lower TF to from 60 to 240 for the EA that is.  However if you put the template on the 4 hour chat, the EMA will no longer be correct.  Current the fast ema is 480 and the slow ema is set to 1200.  This is so that the daily 20/50 is adjusted for the hourly chart.  If you go the 4 hour chart for your lower TF chart, you will need to divide those numbers by 4, so they would be 120/300.  That is how the daily EMA would look on the 4 hour chart.   As far as the EA you only need to change the lower TF from 60 to 240.  That is all..  I hope that helps.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #964 ---
TCO,

Just wanted to confirm the "close after percent loss" usage. Is it percent loss per pair or total of all open positions? Can't remember what has been said, as I've not used it before. Thanks

--- 帖子 #965 ---
TCO can you please check my query. appreciate your help.

Bomi

--- 帖子 #966 ---
Bomi,

Please read the WHOLE thread carefully again.

Then come back with your questions.

--- 帖子 #967 ---
All trades, having the MagicNumber used by your EA, will be closed.

Keep in mind that the magicnumber at this moment is zero by default. If you leave the magicnumber at zero when you start the EA, all your manual trades will be affected (closed) also.

You can change the magicnumber at startup of the EA.

--- 帖子 #968 ---
I noticed that the MA ribbon is not the same as 50 and 20 EMA, Do I need to change the settings on the MA Ribbon indicator?

--- 帖子 #969 ---
Read it to see where others had this question already, and please actually check the settings of those EMA displayed on the charts before posting

HINT : make your very own templates, don't use canned template and then blame someone who is trying to help you

Really, folks, it's not rocket surgery:

1. Decide which method you will trade, example only - original MACD with W%R entry

2. Apply to the Daily chart only, the MACD

3. Apply to the 1 Hour only, the W%R

4. Apply the EA to your base chart - have EA button in OFF position as you set & double check the settings, save a SET file

5. Apply any other indicator of your own personal use, eg. Candle Time etc.

6. Change to all time frames to check to see which are visible & where

7. Save As Template, including the EA

8. Using previously posted Script, apply Template to all charts

9. Check all charts, cycle to the time frames, make adjustments, save, fix any problems, repeat above steps until happy

10. Click the EA button to ON

--- 帖子 #970 ---
Hi guys,

When you are in doubt about the magicnumber of your order, have this script here.

Enter the ticket number and it will show you which magicnumber the order has.

--- 帖子 #971 ---
You need to read and understand the thread, the method and decide which you will trade

Set up your charts to reflect the method that you want to use

You can have blank charts if you like, the EA doesn't care, it has internal indicators for data reading and trades from those values

The charts are there for you alone, therefore you decide how pretty they can be, how much information do you need to decipher how a trade works

Notice an over used word in this post?

Yes!!!!

YOU

--- 帖子 #972 ---
Hi Erebus,

Good explanation from your side.

Allow me to post once again, your chart template for the MACD (third screen ) method : It is my favorite template for this method. (With thanks to Erebus) .

I added the stochastic(14,3,3) because that is used also now in the EA.

Perhaps you have similar templates for the Ichimoku method, the 20/50 method and  the turtle method . But people should be able to make themselves these templates.

--- 帖子 #973 ---
No problem, I have not looked at your current settings, but just a reminder for folks -

Just because the EA can use the Stochastic, you do not need to see it on your chart UNLESS that is the method you are trading

In which case, remove the W%R indicator as it will not be in use and only cause further confusion for your eyes

Think about it, the Daily can have 1 or 2 ways for Trend determination, hence, show those on chart

The 1 hour chart has only 1 method for trade entry, only use that indicator

As I said before, it's not brain science

--- 帖子 #974 ---
Question : Why does AUDUSD give a SELL at this moment ?

Answer : If you have "CheckOncePerBar == true" , then the EA will only take the MACD value of the previous day.

In this case that means : the previous day is minus. However, the current day at this moment shows already +.

Anyways, the EA will take a sell.

If you have "CheckOncePerBar == false", the EA will take the MACD value of the current day, which is now + at this moment.

In that case, it should take a BUY.  But, because the price is not yet in the oversold region of W%R, right now, nothing will happen.

--- 帖子 #975 ---
Perhaps I start :"NAKED TRADING".

I don't want anything on my chart. No confusion at all !

( See my chart of GBPUSD Daily timeframe).

--- 帖子 #976 ---
Does the chart with the EA have to stay on the lower TF, or can we switch to see the Daily and the lower TF as needed?

--- 帖子 #977 ---
You may switch to any timeframe. The EA works independently of that.

Added: You may incidentally, shortly inspect the other timeframes, but for a correct working of the EA, you must return to the lower time frame. That is the hourly timeframe in this case.

--- 帖子 #978 ---
Hi,

Beware that the EA will only open new trades on the close of a new candle bar if " CheckOncePerBar == true"  (Bar Mode). Thus, if the EA is in "Bar Mode" and you leave the EA running in a Daily timeframe chart, the EA will only open a trade when the Daily candle closes?

Regards
ck

--- 帖子 #979 ---
My demo got that trade with " EMA Turtle " settings, W%R set to confirmation

That is the best explanation of the why the MACD does what it does when price in that ranging stage, best bookmark that for further questions

Thanks

--- 帖子 #980 ---
What is the difference,between 'EMA' and 'EMA Turtle' ???

Sorry if this question sounds noobie

--- 帖子 #981 ---
Yes, very noob question, so here is usual pictures for those that cannot read or cannot be bothered to read even POST #1

Pay attention, how you guys got thru school.....?

That is assumption of course, you could be bank robbers for all I know

--- 帖子 #982 ---
That is a very interesting question.

One can read in the first post :

The EA is designed to work on the lower time frame chart. So if you use the daily time frame for your trend determination and the hourly time frame for the Williams% entry signal, the EA must be applied to the hourly chart.

I will leave the final answer to TCO.

As far as I can judge, all indicators are calculated in the correct timeframes. ( hourly= Lower_TF or daily = Trend_TF).

However, if the EA is attached to the daily chart, and is in "Bar Mode",  it will calculate unfortunately only once per day .  It should calculate once per hour.

Therefore, always attach the EA to the hourly chart. Then for sure it will calculate per hour.

It is no problem, if you look incidentally a moment to the hourly chart, but it should not remain there.

In tick mode, it will calculate all the time, but that is an unnecessary  load for your computer.

TCO, could you confirm my vision ?

--- 帖子 #983 ---
What is the connection between "Ema Turtle settings" and MACD ?

I don't see how the "ema turtle settings" explain the behavior of the macd.

--- 帖子 #985 ---
What is "EMA turtle" ?

I understand that we use here the "Turtle" method. That applies to the highest high of the last 20 or so candles and the lowest low.

But what has "EMA" to do with it ?

Is that an exponentially fast moving turtle ?

--- 帖子 #986 ---
Thanks rexio

--- 帖子 #987 ---
Hi Rexio,

Perhaps its a combo of 20/50 EMA & Turtle trend selected for trend determination.

--- 帖子 #989 ---
....thanks darkgsg and TSgarp for answer and help, after the rollercoaster ride yesterday and night I had to close all positions because of high CPU usage this morning for profit. I installed now the new updated EA 1.4 (thx to TCO) on my TE.

Happy Trading, jdva

--- 帖子 #990 ---
Okay team, not sure how much is joking or how much we are be serious about this....

If you CheckOncePerBar = true, then the EA must be on the lower TF chart.  That is the way it is designed and that is the way I like it.

EMA turtle means that the EMA method and the Turtle method have been selected for trend determination.

Automated Trend Methods

1. Ichimoku

2. 20/50 EMA

3. MACD

4. Turtle Channel

Trend_Method_1 = 2

Trend_Method_2 = 4

Trend_Method_3 = 0

Trend_Method_4 = 0

The EA will make your screen display trend method be EMA Turtle, along with your trade comments.

If you select 1 (Ichimoku) and 3 (MACD), the screen display trend method will be ICHI MACD along with the trade comments.

You can select all 4 methods if you want.   You  can select them in any order you want.  As long as you select 1-4.

I hope that helps.

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #991 ---
Thanks TCO.

This was a very clear answer. I am sure it helped with a lot of questions. Not only is the term "Ema Turtle" clear, but also how this was derived and how to apply more than 1 method in general.  You also made clear the use of the timeframes.

Personally. I test only one method, the MACD/Stochastic on 4 pairs. I see others do other combinations.

Together we have a good testrun.

Everything runs fine thus far and it looks like all major errors have been detected.

Perhaps in the future we can write a user manual out of all the questions and remarks and place that in the first post.

--- 帖子 #992 ---
Hi Rexio, MK has brought it to my attention that he uses the low/high to calc stochastic.  So i'm adding options to stochastic where you can us high/low or close for price method and you can use 0 - SMA, 1 - EMA, 2- SMMA or 3 - LWMA for MAmethod for stochastic.  I running a bunch of backtesting, using the different parms and it seems that stochastic does better than WPR and also using the close confirmation seems to do better also.  Very interesting.  So we will have another release soon with the stochastic options added.     Thanks!

--- 帖子 #993 ---
all my setups always use Fibonacci sequence numbers - IMO it is natural order

extern int     Stoch_OB = 89;  // Overbought level

extern int     Stoch_OS = 13;  // Oversold level

extern bool    CheckOncePerBar = false;       // true will open trades on close of bar (bar mode), false will enter trades on current bar (tick mode)

extern int     MACD_Fast = 13;

extern int     MACD_Slow = 21;

extern int     MACD_Signal = 8;

extern bool    MACD_Weekly_Confirmation = false;

--- 帖子 #994 ---
Nice thoughts on those natural numbers.

Anyway, i'm running ver 1.4 EA on MACD with 9,26,9 and using william %r(14) for trigger at default -20 & -80 levels, Close All Trades at 3.0% profit.

And the EA did a basket close of all trades in profit today at about 1230pm (London time).

Cheers,

--- 帖子 #995 ---
Nice darksgs...good to hear.  I've created a spreadsheet to record my testing results.  I'm just recording profit/loss and PF for each test.  It will be for every pair that I would consider trading for each trend method.  I'm testing these combinations.

WPR w/o confirmation

WPR w/ confirmation

and these with confirmation and without confirmation

Stoch SMA on high/low

Stoch SMA on close

Stoch EMA on high/low

Stoch EMA on close

Stoch SMMA on high/low

Stoch SMMA on close

Stoch LWMA on high/low

Stoch LWMA on close

This should give us a good idea what works and what doesn't.  Not definitively, but should give us some good direction.   Thanks!

I was actually observing using TCO ea with MACD method, and was thinking of testing it with WPR% confirmation to "enforced" ea to confirm the trend b4 taking trades. YES, I placed on 1hr chart and default check Bar closed so EA could check that on 1hr rather than placed on Daily then set to false, and EA struggles painfully with my grandfather's VPS cpu to work that hard.

TCO: SO HAPPY to see a NEW ea and newly updated indicators including turtle (this goes into experts/Indicator right?, If I am mistaken pls let me know, coz instructions let this out). I think I will take off the template after the forward testing coz with at least 20 pairs, CPU is crying! Do keep us informed of your test results. Could we bother u to upload these? OH, before I forgot, there is a free EA, EA analyzer that u can used against html report generated from Strategy Test report. Have fun! (I cant remember who is it from, but is a full working copy and as far as I know its bug free, it used to be sold but its now free for FPA members) File is too big even after zip, its 33.6 mb, pls let me know how I can upload this biggie if u think u need it or google it if u think its useful

Hi YM,

You do not need the Turtle indicator for the EA to use the Turtle Trend Method.  I put the necessary logic in the EA to determine the Turtle Trend and it does not call the indicator at all.  The indicator is only for the chart and if you don't use it on the chart, you will still be okay as far as the EA functions.

I will try out the EA analyzer and see how it works.  Also, I will upload the testing results when I complete the testing.  It will take some time.  I'm halfway through the MACD testing now.  Thanks!

this system won't work this way of automatic trading.

no matter how hard you code, how complicated indicator you add, it won't work ---- 99%, in my humble opinion.

i've tested this idea in ForexTester (i'm surprised that no one has tried some solid backtest).  the performance is random when you set TP/SL fixed. in other words, it is a loser.  even if you test it in MT4, i don't think you'll have consistent + results.

if interested, i can post some stats later after work.

but this system can definitely work if you watch the higher TF (daily/weekly) and adjust TP/SL using a bar-by-bar analysis that seems what 100pips have done.

--- 帖子 #1002 ---
Wow...i guess we should all pack up and quit.  No need to waste our time any longer guys and gals.  I wish I would have known a month ago before I coded this EA and setup my demos.

--- 帖子 #1003 ---
don't be let down.  you have to know one way fails so that you take the other route.  i spent my whole last week testing this "auto" idea......

i've traded this LIVE for 1 month.  results +.  100pips did in his thread agree that this'd better be an automatic entry system, but need a trader's intervention on SL/TP.  what i did is only 1 hour scanning thru the market during the weekend, to pick the trending pairs (very simple, just look the daily chart and determine in a minute: up? down? or not fxxx moving?), then drag EA to those trending pairs.  and this simple 1 hour (maybe even 15 minutes) work cannot be coded into an EA (i've knew coding for 6 yrs), but this work, i guess, is the key to make the system work.  if we really want to follow 100pips way, remember he is not fully automatic.

another thing, if you run backtests and read its trades history, you can spot lots of ridiculous exits.  it makes you think.

of coz, wall st pro can code much better, but we'd better do some manual work instead. and lastly, i've recently realised it is easy for a profitable trader to code, but difficult for a good coder to trade (since i code too).  and it is the trader that we want to be.

good luck, your coding skill is still valuable.

Maybe you support your statements with some proof ?

--- 帖子 #1007 ---
Hey tough guy. I suggest you take your own advice and look at your own personal edit status where you state "Backtest is meaningless (to me)". Do some forward testing then maybe you can report back with something of value. SL/TP is always going to be up to each individual trader. There isn't a one shoe fits all. It really is based on your own personal trading style and what you are emotionally able to handle. Much like how difficult it would be trying to convert a position trader to scalp or vice versa. The emotional makeup and comfort level is not the same.

Order Management EA from EA-Coder (freeware) for download. Almost pull out my hair coz swiss army knife closed off 2 of my 4 positions when they total abt 52pips. The reason was that I had placed 500 as profit pips, thinking that 500 meant 500pips right? Wrong! It meant 50pips, so for 500pips per acct, u had to enter as 5000. In addition the EA had some sort of unknown bugs whereby it can sorta ignore some trades and didnt manage to do a basket closed

So this is hopefully a better version, enjoy. As usual, works with symbols, acct equity, pips, with break evens (NO hedging ability) though but with trailing as well

IMHO: If u need the EA to hedge a trade (unlike TCO trader which MANAGES it by closing a trade when an opposite direction is detected, provided u have set to closeonopposite), then u have the wrong EA. It meant that EA is nearly always taking the wrong direction to trade. TCO trader is not what I would call hedging coz trend changes and fast in a fast moving market, EA are not that intelligent, it detects the trend (eg u attached to 1hr chart and it read the bar close at 1hr, if u set this to use checkonceperbar), but within next hr, a huge move could whacked out the conditions, thus EA had to closed those open trades and trade along that trend that is current. Hedging meant opening buy/sell AT same time (at least my trading knowledge, despite being limited, have learnt this fact and hopefully I wont get pancaked for this comment).

Turtle, I am with you here, I made $5k on demo acct. ALL ea's are not that smart no matter what the nots u did or didnt. IMHO some suggestion Charvo,

1) Calculate your risk in advance and make sure that you have set risk % of acct equity/balance/free margin (whatever tickles u) with some reasonable guide line, eg, 1-5% is conservative, >5-10% is mid aggressive and >10-15% is aggressive, >15-20% is highly aggressive and anything beyond that, well, it maybe just turned into margin call (* Not a bible, just my own personal preferences, subs it to any numbers u like)

2) Track performance of ANY EA EXCEPT those by God, in a demo acct, track which cur/trading method is best of breed, eg, TCO trader had ema, macd and ichi etc

3) BE PATIENT, then apply that same settings to your live acct. Be as REALISTIC as possible, eg, if u are going to use $5K as Live acct, test your demo with $5K. If u blow ur demo, u are either doing something wrong or u shld throw the EA away

4) Use ORDER MANAGEMENT to manage your orders, any sort of SL/TP settings can and MAY FAILED. FYI, even GOD sent a flood to destroy earth when he learned that man have become too evil and thought that he was doing something wrong in creating us.

TCO: I am so happy with the result that I will be going live in August with my tuned settings. Pleeze Pleeze Pleeze dont retire coz of just one guy, WE who have been following your developments and testing your EA is happy with it. ALL of us here is awaiting your greatness of V1.51 or V1.6.

PS: Maybe we shld set up a fund, whereby all of us who make profits from it contribute just 3% of their profits and that shld be enough for TCO to get a new buff shine laptop. (* BTW what are u doing w a laptop, shld we get u a new buff shine tablet instead, then u can even bring this with u to the "john" and code away while waiting for some "output")

EquityPercent setting. I have set this to 3, from default of 1, my equity is abt $105,000K (b4 trade was taken) and EA makes a Buy AUDCAD @ 0.96071 with 1.56lots. Here's my calculation: 3% of 105K=$3150

1.56@0.96071/400 (400 is the leverage)=$374.68

Anybody any idea hows the calculation works?

BTW I assume that if I changed the basis for LotsizePerBal=1500, and leave lotsizeper=0.01, then EA is forced to create 0.01lot per $1500? I have yet to try this, coz I prefer using acct equity % as its easier to reduce or increase it. With equity percent, I just pre-determined what % is comfortable for myself, and I prefer slightly conservative at this pt, so I have used 3% of equity as basis. It also meant I dont have to keep changing this if I am ok with profits made at this risk.

--- 帖子 #1020 ---
Hi MK,

Yes, i agree that it should be the other way round normally. But i place the SL far away as i'll usually manually managed my trades every hour or so and they should not get hit that full SL. Anyway, if the trade crosses my virtual SL which is abt 1% of my equity i'll close them though

Still fine tuning as we go along.

Hi TCO,

Hope you are joking . Not everybody will talk to our liking and if they are not confident they will move out of the thread.

You are doing great job, we know this EA is working, we need to test it lot and go on fine tuning, and fine tuning needs all comments negative as well as positive.USE WHAT YOU FEEL HELPING DISCARD USELESS ONES.

Hey TCO. I had a long E/J position open up at 10am my time and for some reason there isn't a SL/TP attached to it. Weird. I didn't have any problem yesterday with E/J, nor today with any other pair. Any idea?

Add- It generated a SL/TP within the settings display, but not on the order itself.

--- 帖子 #1026 ---
I do agree w u, with good risk and order management, whether its via manual or EA (crystal ball not acceptable), The ATR SL can be set to 1, and ATR TP can be set to 1.5 or whatever tickles u. You can still make profits. I left it at defaulted of 2 vs 3 (SL vs TP), and so far, the trades have closed b4 those SL/TP even got hit, by the acct % closed settings. I have now also included Equity Sentry EA (which I contributed in this forum), to closed per ACCT equity of 500pips.

The ATR calculation by the system is also not that accurate as it based on stats (data that is over & done with) to do this. * even if u choose current price, just whats current when u are talking abt FX? If u dont use ATR, and used fixed Sl/TP (maybe based on support/resistance levels of last/current day's values) its still stats (history). U can even choose Pivot calculator EA and based SL/TP on this value, again, stats

So whats the value that u shld put, whether it be 1.5, 2, or whatever can or may be right or wrong. Its too much left to argue. If u left it at lower levels, it may closed your order b4 it can reach its potential. If u put it too much, there would be some trades that can get too high floating negatives. One can do a strategy test to come up with "best" level to use for this, but its still not fool proof.

As usual whenever someone expects things that used stats to calculate to be fool proof, then its no wonder we are now in 21st century, and yet what stats we easily accept, eg, in 2012, average of 1.7 babies are born to couples 25-35yrs old, yada yada.

So we have 2 ppl, giving birth to 1.7 children. Thats stats. Only fools will depend on them to proof anything!

PS: Additional info on ATR (for those interested in further "research" on a "fool-proof" way of defining SL/TP

True Range

Wilder started with a concept called True Range (TR), which is defined as the greatest of the following:Method 1: Current High less the current Low Method 2: Current High less the previous Close (absolute value) Method 3: Current Low less the previous Close (absolute value) http://stockcharts.com/help/doku.php...e_true_range_a

I thought the Close at xx % would close all trades, but now I see it only closes the ones with the magic number that is the same as the EA, is that right?  I think it would be better to close all to refresh.  If you only close the ones with the matching magic number you may be closing the profitable only trades and keeping the bad.

You wrote the above last week.  Can I ask what percentage you risk per trade, your overall return and how many times you have closed the basket at 3% in the two months?

I am still trialling taking signals at the supertrend line; seems to be working fine.  In fact, I think results would be similar with just one trade rather than the two I was suggesting last week.  For me, this still is preferable to potentially opening up to 4 or 8 from the Williams %.  I am up about 7% overall this week from 12 pairs and probably could have got more but closed the basket at about 5% today (risking 1% per trade and, apart from one pair, just carrying one trade per pair).  Drawdown hasn't been great; from memory not more than about 3%.  Can I ask how are your results this week to compare?

Many thanks.

Hi Guys, in his diligence for checking the code, Rexio found a defect.

if((Use_Stoch == true) && ((Stoch_Confirmation == true && Stoch_Signal_Prev < Stoch_OS && Stoch_Signal_Curr > Stoch_OS && Stoch_Main_Curr > Stoch_OS) || (Stoch_Confirmation == false  && Stoch_Main_Curr < Stoch_OS && Stoch_Signal_Curr < Stoch_OB)))

{

Lower_TF_Method = "Stochastic";

BuySignal = true;

}

Stoch_OB must be Stoch_OS

It shouldn't greatly affect the way stoch is trading, but be aware.  I will make the correction when release the new stoch parms.  I will probably keep the version number 1.4.   Thanks!

Nice catch Rexio!!

--- 帖子 #1032 ---
Greetings, S3.

Well, it is impossible to answer that question, as it is different for each trade. I am using 0.01 lots per $1,000 in my MINI account. That was as aggressive as I was willing to be with this. The drawdowns would be too much for my liking if I went higher than that. I realize this means I am risking more on some pairs than others on comparable trades, but once I get a decent equity built up in the account, I can move to a fractional lot size based on a percentage of account. Does that make sense?

I have probably closed the basket 5-6 times in the two months I have been running the demo, although the total return (28%) would indicate that it has occurred more often than that. I could probably figure it out by looking at the closed trades, but probably won't go to that trouble since there are over 1,000 completed trades in that time period.

Sounds like you have had success as well. Good job. At the end of the day, there are a lot of ways to follow and trade off of these trends. The end results may be very similar, actually. I went live starting this week, and I opted for the MACD trend with W%R. But I will continue testing other combinations to see what might be best long-term.

Trade well,

TF

Hi TCO,

Thanks for sharing your system and fully supported EA with the community. The results of the EA look excellent, but during the years I had some hard lessons with EA's.

I am a programmer myself, but was never able to come up with a profitable strategy. I coded many EAs but most of them failed during back testing.

I want to contribute to this thread as well, so I thought that I could do some back testing for you on my tick data (its 99% modeling quality).

In the attachment I have some back testing results on version 1.3. If you want me to put some extra effort in it, please send me a PM.

Another thing regarding the EA. I am currently running it and it took a sell trade on EurUsd a few hours ago for 1.30115, SL=1.31960 and TP=1,27325. I was thinking, is the TP not a bit too far away ?

Then again, it will probably never hit TP, cause the EA will close all trades when the account profit is hit. But why is it so far away ?

Regards,

MeAgain

Welcome MeAgain. You can actually change the TP/SL parameters to reflect ATR value or change the hard TP/SL value on each individual pair if you wish.

What do you do on Friday with the NFP report (USA)  ?

--- 帖子 #1038 ---
Welcome, MeAgain. Good to have you on board. Thanks for sharing your backtests. Very interesting, indeed. I noticed the worst performing pair was EURCHF. That is not a pair that was in 100Pips' original list, and I'm not sure about others here, but I am not trading it with this system. Looks like there are a couple other extra pairs in there as well, but it is good to see the results of all of them nonetheless. Good work.

--- 帖子 #1039 ---
I'm not sure yet, but I'm incline to just avoid tomorrow with those two rate decisions, and may trade as normal on Friday. I expect NFP to come in inline, or above expectations.  I'll just evaluate tomorrow. Alot of people in U.S normally take off on Friday, when a holiday falls on a Thursday. 4 day weekend. Financial markets will probably be on light volume, which could mean exaggerated price swings on both days, so be careful.

--- 帖子 #1040 ---
exaggerated price swings ???

So yesterday was normal?

Just kidding, be careful is right!

--- 帖子 #1041 ---
Man, that was some crazy PA. Look at that shooting star. Is that the XSupertrend indie you're using on that hourly chart?

--- 帖子 #1042 ---
You know it is; and on the Daily also with 20/50/200 EMA + MACD, I figure out the trend is UP

--- 帖子 #1043 ---
As long as the MACD D1 is negative, I consider the trend DOWN. That relates to the macd strategy.

But I have to admit, that 420 pips upwards was a strong hit for me with GBPAUD.

Is the trend really UP now ? Even if that is true, how much more space does GBPAUD have to go up ? Not so much in my opinion.

It did already 2200 pips upwards and that is more than enough.

( but that's an opinion, you never know for sure).

As to xSupertrend, the indicator : It looks nice on the charts, but it is very lagging in nature.

--- 帖子 #1044 ---
In my testing normal MACD is better than MACD Adjustable!!!

--- 帖子 #1045 ---
I've been wondering about that since the major confusion over in the Third Screen Strategy thread when we were told to place one indicator on the chart, but had to have another indicator in MT4 because the EA was taking readings from that one.

Can you tell us what difference you can find between what you call normal MACD and the adjustable MACD used by khaled's EA?

And I wonder why they even went down that road? Surely they would have looked at the standard MACD at some point.

--- 帖子 #1046 ---
Sure. I will try with my little English.

Please look at the attached image.

This chart show 2 EMAs, 12 and 24 and two indicators, Above MACD Adjustable and below Standard MACD (Normal).

In Stardard MACD there are 2 lines. One is the MAIN LINE or histogram and it's a difference between EMA 12 minus EMA 24. When two EMAs are equal, then histogram or MAIN LINE is equal to 0. When EMA 12 is above EMA 24, MAIN LINE or histogram is greater than 0.

The another line in Standard MACD is the Signal line, it's equal to average the MAIN LINE by number of Signal Periods (9 periods in MACD(12,24,9)).

In MACD Adjustable there are two histogram, blue and red (In this case). These histogram are calculate equal to difference between MAIN LINE (In Standard MACD) and Signal Line (In Standard MACD), so when histogram is blue, MAIN LINE is greater than Signal Line (In Standard MACD) and when histogram is red, MAIN LINE is lower than Signal Line (In Standard MACD).

Please note, MACD Adjustable don't show any about EMAs Cross.

I'm waiting all you understand my English.

With regards,

Maudur.

--- 帖子 #1047 ---
Very good explanation, thanks.

Now I forgot to mention that part of the confusion I referred to was caused by khaled saying to put the MACD3SSS in the indicators folder; I have looked at  MACD3SSS and compared with standard MACD, they look the same to me.

I think part of 100_pips success is that he is looking at the MACD Adjustable, which changes color much quicker as shown on your chart, and making discretionary trading exit & entry using that, and once a trend is under way, taking signals / entries from the EA using the MACD3SSS

Which sort of confirm your analysis and testing results saying that the standard MACD is giving better outcome of system, so maybe I need 2 MACD on the chart

--- 帖子 #1048 ---
The indicator macd_adjustable has errors in it. I call it a 'glitch'. It seems that the source code is a mess.

The glitch appears especially then when the numbers of the main line and the signal line are approaching zero.  (When the macd is in transition) .

I want to refer to my post #1035  over here : http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...382032&page=52

--- 帖子 #1049 ---
In the attached image I created the same 2 charts, but now both represented in the same way:  mian versus signal line

a) Thirdscreen way = macd_adjustable

b) Official macd way of calculation

Now you can see at once where the minor differences are.

--- 帖子 #1050 ---
For the use of the macd strategy in the long run this does not have major implications. It is only annoying to have a glitchy indicator.

In this way it is not possible to get consistency with other programs like for example the dashboard program.

--- 帖子 #1051 ---
I am still plugging away at experimenting with taking trades at the xsupertrend line, the lower line in an uptrend and the upper line in a downtrend (probably discussed about 10 pages back?).

I am not a programmer and I wonder if anyone can help me with relevant code required for this or point me in the direction of someone who can?  I am thinking of writing it into the TCO EA as another confirmation stage (as Williams % is) and then I will merrily forward test it and report back here with my findings to everyone.  It may be a wild goose chase or just re-inventing the wheel, but I prefer fewer trades with better entries which I think this will give me.

Would I be right in thinking if I checked the 'check once per bar' as false the EA will check the price based on tick data?  If yes, then I could merely ask, for example, in an uptrend (defined by 20/50 ema or MACD), to check if xsupertrend line was below closing price in the previous two bars, and current price is at or below the xsupertrend value of the previous bar close, and if so, send buy order.  Obviously in a downtrend I would ask it to check if xsupertrend line was above closing price of previous two bars and then check fs current bar price was at, or above, the value of the xsupertrend value of the previous bar close.  As the EA currently covers maximum number of trades per pair and time delay between trades, I think I could control the possibility of taking more than one trade at the same line level.

Many thanks for anyone who can help.  I have attached the relevant indicator (I use MA 10, and multiplier of 3).

--- 帖子 #1052 ---
Hi S3,

Could you surprise us with a chart with one or two examples on it.

I suppose the timeframe would be 1 hour ?

Thanks.

I give it a try here myself.  Here is an attached example of the H1 chart of currently GBPAUD. It is the template of TCO. This means the MACD and 20/50 on it, but translated into a daily interpretation.  Williams is the hourly W%R as usual.

I see 2 sells around 24 june, but they are negated because of the positive MACD.

Then I see a buy at July 1./1600 which runs into a reversal.

What do you do with a reversal ? Do you reverse or trade through it ?  If you hold the trade, you have a maximim DD of around 100 pips and finally you go to TP = 320 pips.

There would be another buy at July 3./0400 .

Summarized : 1 or 2 buys in the period of June21 till now. BUT : I see afterwards, that these buys occur in a time period where the MACD D1 is negative. So they should be negated.  So there would be nothing all that time period from June 21 till now.

Do you agree roughly with this analysis ?

--- 帖子 #1053 ---
Thanks for your reply.

I have attached my chart of GBPAUD.  Using 20/50 EMA to determine trend, I have been only taking long trades for a while.  Two trade opportunities in the chart, both made 2.5 times risk, in this case 275 pips each risking 110 pips per trade.

I have also attached my chart of EURUSD.  I use the 20/50 EMA for trend so I have only been looking for long trades for some time (the MA ribbon is below the price action).  Since 21 June (the start of your chart) I have had only 2 trades which were two long trades, both potential good winners. A potential third trade, a buy at 1.4255 would be currently underwater, but applying a 12 hour delay after the last closing trade (my take profit is 2.5 times risk, or 200 pips in this case; you could have made more) it would not have been taken.  Currently I would be waiting for price to rise to take out the higher xsupertrend line again before looking for a new buy at the resulting lower xsupertrend line thereafter.  So I would want the EA (in this upward trend) to determine whether the xsupertrend level closed below the actual close for the previous two bars (which they don't in the current example) before buying during the current candle when the price touches the xsupertrend close of the previous candle.  So no potential new long trade yet.

I hope that makes sense.  I would want the EA to look at the previous 2 candles and determine whether, per xsupertrend, we are in an uptrend, ie above the xsupertrend line.  If we are, then place buy order when the price hits the xsupertrend value of last close, in the current candle.

So, potentially, four trades here which are 'cherry picking at it's best' but you couldn't fail to make money from them.  In the first chart you might have got stopped out on the first as the price moved more than 110 in your favour and retraced to break even before taking off.  But the second one was clean.

That's potentially 7.5% from these two this week.

--- 帖子 #1054 ---
Hi S3,

Thank you for  your clear explanation.

It is interesting to see for EURAUD that the 20/50 strategy would give 2 winning trades  whereas the MACD strategy would have 1 losing

trade in the same time period.

I suppose hereby that once the trade is entered, only SL or TP decide about the end of that trade. In other words : you trade through a reversal of the indicators.

Now about who is going to program this ?

For the time being, in my opinion,  we should wait for TCO's newest version, yet to be released. Then this version needs time to stabilize, i.e. the debugging phase. All this takes at least 2 weeks after release.

After that , there would be time to look into new adventures, including yours with the supertrend.

I hope that TCO would be willing to program it , because he knows his program best.

In essence the case looks like this :

The EA knows 4 main strategies to determine the trend.(   1. Ichimoku,  2. 20/50,   3. MACD,   4. Turtle channel).

These strategies may be added if you wish.

Once the trendstrategies have been choosen, we rely on EXCLUSIVELY (one excludes the other) one of 2 hourly mechanisms for orderentry  :

1) W%R

2) Stochastic

Yours with the supertrend would be number 3.

Rexio

Looking at EURUSD I had a sell on 27 June @ 1.3053 and another on 1 July @ 1.3051 (assuming 2 sells max per pair which I might yet change).  I have closed one trade and moved stop down on the other.  Individual targets were 1.2853 and 1.2851 respectively.  I closed one before ECB announcements (sod's law!).   The point is if I had left both trades to run, between them they would be up nearly 4% now.

Different ramble:  I sometimes wonder if it might be a good idea to have a monthly target of, say, 2% profit per currency pair, and when they hit it individually, you halt the EA on the respective chart until next month.  I think 2% is reasonable because that is what the EA is kind of programmed for, so we must assume we are hopeful of attaining that target, ie 1 winning trade.  A bit like the old rhyme, 10 (or in my case 12) green bottles hanging on a wall.  As each one hits their 2% for the month they are removed, gradually reducing risk, and trading, for the month.  I am, of course, assuming that individually each pair will get to it's 2% (which is probably a reasonable assumption with this system otherwise we might be all wasting out time) although some will go underwater before doing so.  In other words trade every pair until they individually reach 2% and then delete them until next month.  It might mean some months we get to 24% (in my case with 12 pairs) with two weeks to go and switch off the PC!!!   Another way of doing this might be to have a total trade closure when a combined profit of 6% is hit and cease trading for the month when 2 of these total closures have happened.  I recall from TCO's original analysis he had about 96,000 pips profit in 18 months?  That's 5,300 pips a month and he was risking about 200 pips a trade (from memory)?  At 1% a trade, that's 26% a month, so closing at 24% or even 12% is fairly prudent.    We all know that there are good periods and bad periods of trading.  However, if I was closing at 2% per pair, and ended the month with 8 pairs closed at 2% and the other 4 down 1% each, I'd still be happy with my 12% overall and possibly my stress would be less.  Because I would know that after buttoning down say 6 pairs, leaving 6 to trade, my maximum risk from new trade baskets would be diminishing as the month progressed, ie half.  Imagine if you were up 15% for the month, still traded all the pairs, and then had 10 trade pairs go the wrong way on you and you lost it all.  By taking 'pairs off the table' as they hit target I believe we are less likely to be 'giving it all back' which tends to be the common cycle in forex.

However.............I expect a mathematical genius might prove to me that numerically I might be talking nonsense.  Just some thoughts.

How about if you took the break of the line starting about June 25 ?

I think this gives you 4 entries and probably more pips

As I mention before, I think this is more in line with how SuperTrend is meant to be used

And it would be easier to program in my opinion, not that I know anything about that; not sure about multiple entries

Anyway, has given me some new ideas to work on, thanks for posting

--- 帖子 #1057 ---
Just using stochastics, I had one E/U short opened @ 1.30583 on July 1st. Almost similar to your July 1st short using XSupertrend. I haven't checked last month since my terminal is cleared beginning of the month.

--- 帖子 #1058 ---
I just don't see the advantage of using XSupertrend. If you compare the signals using Stochastics  -vs- XSupertrend, is possible you could've missed this whole uptrend on U/J? You're talking with just a 300 pips TP with each signal using stochs with minimal DD. That's over 1000 pips

Hi Erebus

I am a creature of the pullback.  I tend not to like initial congestion zone breakouts or the types of break that you point out; prefer to wait for a retrace.  Otherwise generally I have found that my stop losses need to be greater, which restricts my risk:reward.  I realise that there are times when I miss the boat, but there are also times when my entry is spot on and better than the initial break.

Also, on the break you suggest, I expect I would have moved the stop loss to break even after the initial fall.  This would have taken me out at nothing on that trade.  I also like the pullback entry point because after the pullback if the trade goes in your direction to the previous low (in this example) you know it has to take that out for you to get to target and bring your stop loss to break even would be above the new resistance level which is safer.  Swings and roundabouts I guess.

--- 帖子 #1060 ---
Hi TCO,

thanks you very much for your big works, I have sett your ea on more demo.

I have noticed I got much time alert with invalid stop and so on, window, is possible to turn off the alert?

Thanks you.

I don't trade the UJ so wouldn't have looked at this.  However, I have attached a chart.  On the daily it looks like longs only, although I don't know why the MA ribbon on the hourly shows  short positions only as I thought the MA ribbon was supposed to replicate the trend on the daily but on the hourly chart.

Anyways.....so we are singing from the same hymn-sheet, if we assume longs only per your hypothesis, then I would have had 2 long trades (1 @ 97.75 on 24 June and 1 @ 97.58 on 26 June).  My first trade would have been a loss of 80 pips (supertrend allows me to adopt a tighter stop loss because generally mean I will take the loss rather than carry a larger drawdown and wait for the creation of another trade opportunity as a result) and my second a 2.5% profit, giving 1.5% profit overall.  I also believe that you might have moved your stop loss up to break even on your first trade as it had been up over 150 pips before it came back to entry before it took off.  If not, then I presume you might be using 175 pips of something of that order, giving you your 5 trades to get 1,000 pips between them.  That is good and a very good chart example for a linear line.  However, you have to compare like with like.

If you are using 175 pips stop loss as your risk each time then 1,000 pips profit is 5.7 times your risk.  Say if you risk 1% on each trade, that is 5.7%.  The UJ rose about 250 pips from most of your entry levels so my second trade would have made 3.1% (using 80 pip stop loss and replacing 250 target with 200 that I use to replicate your example) and my first trade would have lost, so I would have netted 2.1% against your 5.7%.  But this is flawed in one simple factor.  It doesn't compare apples with apples.  If you are prepared to risk up to 5 trades (and indeed it might be up to 8 trades) and I were only to risk 1 trade, I doubt you would be risking as much as I on each trade because your stops are greater and you know you might be in for at least 5 trades deep (4 of your trades were around the same level meaning fingers and legs crossed that the market didn't turn at that point).  So say I can risk 4 times what you risk to be in the same position (I could say 5), my return would have been 12.4% on my winner and 4% loss on my loser, netting 8.4%, using your 250 target level as exit. This is the true comparison with your 5.7% return.  Of course, this depends upon your stop loss.  If it is not 175, but 100 then your return would have been 10%, similar to what I would have achieved.

All I am trying to do with supertrend is to get fewer trades, a tighter stop loss, and not load up the boat with trades around the same level which may result in a coin toss aka. 'double or quits' scenario.  With a tighter stop AND fewer trades I can up my initial risk substantially, compared to what it would be if I thought I could be in 5 deep.

I have attached a NZDUSD from past week.  Daily 20/50 EMA shows shorts only.  You would have up to 8 trades now on average at 50 pips underwater on 8 trades.  Yes, it might come round and make lots of profit but, personally, I just wouldn't want to be there. With supertrend I would have had one losing trade and one break even trade, assuming just one trade per pair at a time.

That's all.  Probably both right, but both with different trading styles.

--- 帖子 #1062 ---
Ho S3,

In my opinion you would not have had the 2 trades , you mention in your post :

quote
if we assume longs only per your hypothesis, then I would have had 2 long trades (1 @ 97.75 on 24 June and 1 @ 97.58 on 26 June

end quote

For both trades, price is under or in the macribbon. I thought you would only take trades, when price is above the ribbon (for longs) ?

The first trade you would have is July 3./10:00 at 100.32 Long.

What is wrong with my reasoning ?

--- 帖子 #1063 ---
If only people start testing different settings with the existing indicators - instead of adding different indicators with the same settings that would be just great

--- 帖子 #1064 ---
I don't stop you. Go ahead. Show your settings etcetera !

What about your H4 settings with EMA+MACD . Long heard nor seen anything.

--- 帖子 #1065 ---
Hi Rexio

Nothing wrong with your reasoning at all.  I was just trying to keep the debate relevant to the trades MKFXTrader took.  I trade the 20/50 EMA trend method and so I don't think MKFXTrader would have taken those longs using that method either, so his whole hypothesis for his trades would have been in question.  If you drill out to the daily and look at the 20/50 EMA's then the price was ranging from UNDER the 20 ema to between the 20 and 50 ema from 6 June.  The price only closed above the 50 EMA on the 27 June.  So, in theory, he shouldn't have taken long trades during that period.  However, he showed 4 trades he would have taken between the 21st June and 26th June so, I thought rather than just say 'you shouldn't have taken them' and 'I wouldn't have taken them' I assumed we both did so we could at least compare the outcomes.  So I thought IF I just blindly assumed for the sake of this exercise that the trend was up, then I would be looking for longs at the supertrend line below the price action.  Then I compared the outcomes.

Perhaps MKFXTrader was using another trend method, but that would make the whole argument irrelevant.  We can all find examples of where one trend method says long and one says short.  It would have made our trade comparison a COMPLETE waste of time if that were the case.

Incidentally, after a long trend like the one in the chart when the supertrend line isn't touched for a while it can tend to get too close to the price action resulting in a loss from a decent pullback.  Indeed, my first trade (3 July) would have been a loser, whereas MKFXTrader's long trade soon after mine would still be running.  MKFXTrader would also have had no long trades from 27 June to 3 July during the big run up.  C'est la vie....

That's 2 days ago sherlock, i don't have the powers to speed up a forward test. Plus i have something running on my profile shown public.

Go ahead, ruin the thread with random nonsense indicators to filter out some bad trades. In a few weeks, this system doesn't have anything to do with the third screen strategy anymore, as everything gets destroyed on this forum.. Though i keep hearing K.I.S.S alot here

I wouldn't classify our trading style as being any different. I am pretty conservative myself in how many positions I open per pair, and delay time I use is either 8-12 hrs. My only point is with the  use of stochastics one can trade just as effectively and efficiently without the need of introducing all kinds of different indicators. I like Dr. Elder's system because of it's simplicity and KISS approach. I understand though, that traders often have their favorite indies that provide comfort. Happy trading S3.

--- 帖子 #1070 ---
Happy trading to you too MKFX (or can I call you MK?)

I don't know if 'comfort' is the right word but I get your gist.

Seems like discussion like ours which may be 'outside the box' strikes the raw nerve of the guys who want to follow a system blind for their 'comfort.'

Good eve, MK.

--- 帖子 #1071 ---
Don't get me wrong, i don't have anything against new indicators which can lead to greater success. But i don't believe we are any close to that stage yet. As i for one, and i'm sure there are many others, are still testing basic settings. I think we should test what we have first, instead of throwing more stuff at TCO to code and bring out a new version every week.

Unfortunately i don't have the experience to do very thoroughly backtests as i'm not a programmer, but the least i can do is forward testing. And i'm more interested in different results from what we have right now, than results with new indicators, which we cannot even compare since we don't have alot statistics.

Edit:

And with that i mean different settings, i.e. jump stops, pipstep, trailing stops, ATR SL/TP's, Tick/Bar mode, different TF's, Stochastic, MACD etc... There's still alot to test before i would consider adding even more to what we already have

--- 帖子 #1072 ---
I agree with you, I come from ea school, I traded for years only with ea and I tried hundreds of ea, I also made myself ea cuz I know mql4 code,  I spent many hours on backtests, you can add all parameters you want and keep adding and adding parameters and I can say to you it's all useless, there will be never no 100% fully automatic ea able to make profit in the long run, MONEY PRINT does not exists ... just stick with base 20&50 or D1 macd systems with manual interventions (what you see with your eyes EA can't see) ... the system you use can be very simple but what makes the difference is the phsicology, money managment of the trader, emotions .... the system is not the main part of the game and it can be simple ... thrust me maybe I can say that after 4 years of ea managing and use ....

I mean for entry/exit logic of the ea, then other things like automatic calculation of lot size, fast entries, automatic set of sl,tp base on atr or whatever you want yes it can help traders ...

I think the goal is a mixture of ea using with human interventions as 100pipsaday already do, obviously if you know what to do ....

with this I don't want to discredit tco trader ea it's a great work and it can help all of us... just use it with your brain ....

just my 2 cents...

--- 帖子 #1073 ---
Hello TCO. I have a doubt you might clarify. Why does the EA show Trend=Ranging when Tenkan > Kijun using Ichimoku method only? Shouldn't it show Uptrend instead?

Thanks for all your hard work and commitment to others. My thanks for your clarification in advance.

Regards,

D

--- 帖子 #1074 ---
Hi Vox,

Could you show a chart ? Perhaps the reason is : When you have  "CheckOncePerBAr = true", then the EA takes the values of the previous day. They may be different from today's values.

--- 帖子 #1075 ---
Perhaps if you at least mention what pair (or is it all pairs) or show a screen shot of chart, then those of us with time to problem solve have somewhere to start from

Thanks, E.

--- 帖子 #1076 ---
Ok, guys here's a chart.

As you can see

Ichimoku current trend says "Ranging" with Tenkan above Kijun

Williams is issuing a buy signal that should be valid assuming Tenkan>Kijun=Uptrend

How does Ichimoku determine the trend exactly?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1077 ---
Hi rexio. This is Ichimoku in H1 TF.

--- 帖子 #1078 ---
hi vox dei,

For the EA when only "Ichimoku" trend is selected , the "Uptrend" is determined by the following conditions:-

1. Tenkan Sen > Kijun Sen &

2. Current Bid Price > Tenkan Sen &

3. Previous Day Close > Tenkan Sen.

For "Downtrend" the following conditions must be true:-

1. Tenkan Sen < Kijun Sen &

2. Current Ask Price < Tenkan Sen &

3. Previous Day Close < Tenkan Sen

Hope that helps.

cheers

ck.

--- 帖子 #1079 ---
Thanks for the clarification, darkgsg.

I took 1 for granted, suspected 2, but never considered 3. If one was to change TF to H1 as I did, shouldn't condition 3 change as well to Previous Hourly Close compare to Tenkan Sen?

It seems the buy on the screenshot which was entered manually and made me inquire about Ichimoku is not valid then.

--- 帖子 #1080 ---
hi vox dei,

Please do note this EA is based on the "Daily" time frame trend with entry on the lower time frame "H1" to catch a ride with the trend, so the Previous Day Close is taken in consideration. the H1 chart is only concerned with the trade trigger either by "%R" or stoch.

U may want to check back post  #1 again to refresh on this EA strategy

cheers

ck

--- 帖子 #1081 ---
That's something I know. Simply prefer having everything set to H1. Appreciate the reminder though.

--- 帖子 #1082 ---
This is the heart of the matter, as I have repeated over & over & over

Put on the DAILY chart the indicators that you are using for TREND determination

HINT: MACD, 20/50 EMA, Turtle Channel or Ichimoku

Then on 1 HOUR chart, use ONLY the indicator you will use to determine trade ENTRY

HINT: Williams % Range or Stochastic

It is not rocket surgery, er brain science, er, I mean, you don't have to be too smart

Or else if you don't , you will get totally confused about what you were doing in the first place

As we see this over & over & over

H1 trend... Is it not obvious, I'm not following 3rd screen strategy, simply using the EA, duh? You assume too much! Learn to give people some credit, and who knows maybe you gain some back.

If you think I'm being rude, think again. You were rude first. Quid pro quo.

Outa here now, that's what I call being smart.

PS: Sorry for the hijack TCO. You're a good guy.

--- 帖子 #1086 ---
Hey, I'm cool, I don't think you are rude, maybe upset a little

You came here, ask a very vague question, gave absolutely no information of the time frame you are trading or the settings you are using, everyone assumes you must be using the standard Daily & 1 Hour, so we went from there.

Probably if a little research was done with the right information, the answer could be found quickly & easily

So, I'm still not clear, and your chart settings were not readable & NO it is not obvious - are you using 1 Hour chart for the Trend and 15 Minutes for the entry?

If using 1 hour for trend, you don't read the W%R on 1 hour, go to the 15 minutes chart, unless you are trying to do both on 1 hour?

You can change the display color of the EA in the settings, white or yellow is good

--- 帖子 #1087 ---
THe answer to your question is in the first post of the thread

"It is based on a couple of 100PipsADay strategies and also Ichimoku and Turtle. Basically it determines the daily trend using 4 different methods (select 1-4) and then uses the Williams% or Stochastic to enter trades on the lower TF."

--- 帖子 #1088 ---
Technically you are correct, that is what the EA is based on, but there are settings that you can adjust to use whichever 2 time frames you desire; this is the problem, for me at least, to figure out which time frame he is reading the Ichimoku trend and then the time frame where he is saying the signal is not correct.

I also quote Post #1

The EA is designed to work on the lower time frame chart. So if you use the daily time frame for your trend determination and the hourly time frame for the Williams% entry signal, the EA must be applied to the hourly chart. The indicators in the attached template were edited accordingly so the daily trend indicators display on the hourly chart correctly. If you use a different time frame for your lower time frame and you use the template, you will need to adjust the periods in the indicator. So be advised. The indicator parameters in the EA however, do not need to be adjusted, just the Trend_TF and the Lower_TF parameters.

--- 帖子 #1089 ---
Can anyonbe help me with the BE parameters please.

Hi TICO,

I have been demo testing EMA TURTLE  and MACD TURTLE trend method on two demo accounts, also in parallel I am running a demo on three screen EA (100pips and khaled) for comparison purpose. Today I found a interesting point which might be useful for improving the TCO 1.4 EA.

On AUD/USD chart, the MACD histogram is showing negative in both the EA, but TCO EA activated SELL whereas THREESCREEN EA activated BUY on same pair same tf.I understand both EA are using MACD3SS for signals.

I think your signal is coming from MACD histogram whereas in three screen its considering histogram and the slope of the histogram also (forgive me I am not a programmer). If this is true, then your EA will go on placing SELL till it crosses to positive(0),where as threescreen is catching turning point on the histogramme itself and placing BUY even if Histo is in negative area.

I dont know if this information is useful, but You and other team members can analyse it if it is worth. Both screen shots are attached here:

--- 帖子 #1097 ---
Khaled's EA is not programmed to take into consideration of the slope. Are you running test with different brokers? If so, then that is the difference. My TCO EA says uptrend on A/U MACD. Khaled's EA is programmed on the cross of signal line, yes, it's using different MACD and it's displayed differently but it works the same. The slope has nothing do with it. There isn't any changes within MACD that TCO needs to update, unless he uses a totally different MACD where it's formulated computation is closer to the the actual developer of the MACD, which I have already mentioned to TCO. You should look into studying the behaviour of MACD, what you're describing in your last paragraph regarding MACD still giving long signals even though it's in the negative, ect... is not correct understanding of macd. The only difference between the two MACD(MACD3SS and Adjustable MACD) you are comparing is one is showing(histogram) the difference between both lines and one is only showing the signal line and histogram. Hope it makes sense. In other words the formula is the same except how it's displayed. Sorry if  my English doesn't make sense in describing. Happy trading.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #1098 ---
Hi MKFX,

Thanks for your explanation, I will try to understand MACD behavior in light of that.However,I am using same broker in both the cases.This was the observation put to all of you for analyzing it's worth.

Your English is perfect, only my understanding of the indicators behavior will need some more study considering your explanation as well.

--- 帖子 #1099 ---
Hi Team,

I appreciate all the guys answering the questions for me.  Nice job.   I guess we will be having a 1.5 release.   MK has asked me to add price method and MA method to the EMA strategy as part of the EMA parms.   I will be adding these options, so it will no longer be EMA, but MA and you will be able to decide if you want EMA or SMA  or SMMA, or LWMA.  Also the stoch parms,  price method and MA method will be added also.  Also I will put a toggle in to turn on/off alerts.

I'm continuing to do my backtesting with WPR vs. Stochastics, I'm on the Turtle Method now.  It is very interesting to see how it goes.  I didn't think the Turtle method would be that great, but for some pairs it really shines.  EURGBP has been profitable with it during the last 18 months, and it really did well with GBPAUD, so it makes you think.

Also guys i'm not sure you are aware by you can optimize the trend strats together and see which combinations work well together.   Just food for thought.  If you put any stock in backtesting and optimizing...using mt4.

You do this kind of setup for each pair and optimize.  It will start with method 1 (Ichi) and step through to method 4 (turtle)..  for both Trend_Method_1 and Trend_Method_2 and you may get combos that are more profitable in comparison to single methods.   You could do it for 3 method combos too.

Start Step End

Trend_Method_1 = 0              1       1     4

Trend_Method_2 = 0              1       1     4

Thanks for all the help and support.  TCO.

second point i wanna mention : Do you guys have any BreakevenProfit Settings? If yes, which are they?

I'm floating right now the 2nd time in a great plus but the ea won't close them. Of course he is not closing them, because i haven't gave him the input to do so. But which setting is here the better?

Dear newentrader,

sorry but I work all day and only at this momet just arrived to my home.

The answer to your question is clear in the image. It's clear for you?

In MACD Adjustable you see only the blue and red bars. These are very differente to standard MACD.

100pipsADay also use MACD Adjustable bars to select the trend.

Hey, on the next release can you add a TDI indicator so we can judge the strength of the current trend? And while you are at it, could you put in an option for RSI with variable periods? Also, I'm thinking a Zigzag indicator might be a nice addition. And have you ever heard of point and figure? If you get time, can you work that up as an option?

Friend, you are WAY too accommodating, IMO.

Dear Maudur, thanks for your reply. I can see orders are matching with MACD Adjustible,not only on this pair but on other pairs also. But my question is 100pips EA uses signal from MACD3SS or MACD Adjustible? If 100pips also use MACD Adjustible then it must be manual interference but here EA is automatically using signals matching with MACD Adjustible.

With regards

--- 帖子 #1109 ---
Hi TCO/Maudur

Its nice you are considering this selection to put in your next release, I have come across an indicator based on MACD which indicates the signal in 'RANGING " or TRENDING" which is basically recognizing as MACD adjustible, it displays reversal in deep green color means uptrend but ranging and light green color if clear uptrend, same way for down trend,in maroon and red color, advantage is , it can help EA to place orders only when clear trending when color is light green or red, taking signals from only those periods and filter other time signals(deep green or maroon) .

I dont know the source of this MACD indicator,its somewhere from FF or Metaquote library.However the same is attached herewith, you can check which one is more usefull MACD Adjustible or MACD Candles or may be both can be added.Idea is to add filters to take more authentic trend signals to place orders and reducing drawdown /hitting stop losses.

(I am continuously comparing  on my Demo accounts of TCO 1.4 EA MACD Trending method and ThreeScreen EA , keeping standard MACD and MACD Adjustible, and

MACD Candle indicators on the charts with respect to orders placed by respective EA.)

Maudur and newentrader,

Are you guys really serious? That is very unnecessary request. We only need ONE MACD. Unfortunately MT4 version is not written correctly, and Adjustable has a bug. We only need to use one that is properly programmed per the original creator Gerald Appel's formula. You also need it programmed with the histogram similar to adjustable so you can measure and spot divergence. Divergence is a very strong non lagging indication of a potential reversal in PA. Thomas Aspray took Appel's formula and in 1986, wrote the MACD-Histogram which measures the distance between MACD and its signal line (This is why 100pip chose to use MACD_ adjustable even though it has a bug). Aspray developed the MACD-Histogram to anticipate signal line crossovers in MACD. Because MACD uses moving averages and moving averages lag price, signal line crossovers can come late and affect the reward-to-risk ratio of a trade (This is why Khaled and TCO have programmed the EA into only taking signals on the flip of the histogram and not the crossover). Bullish or bearish divergences in the MACD-Histogram can alert chartists to an imminent signal line crossover in MACD.

What you're suggesting is very unnecessary in adding the choice of using different MACD to be written into the EA. It will not only be unnecessarily bloating the EA, but open up for any potential problems. Plus those MACD's are not properly written.

I think TCO has been more then accommodating to all of us,  but this request just doesn't make any sense. I have shared with TCO some info on this subject in the past. I'm sure he will look at it and evaluate it when he get's an opportunity. Until then, we should stick with what we have, test and use the hell out of it before requesting an overhaul of the EA when it is unnecessary. Just my op.

Cheers

couldnt agree more with MKFX's post, let's not bloat this EA with unecessary add-ons

--- 帖子 #1112 ---
Hi TCO,

This is a fabulous system.

But I want to make a suggestion which might make this even better.

Currently we assume the end of downtrend/uptrend on the basis of macd_adjustable being above or below 0 line.

But I have observed that the end of downtrend/uptrend is hinted by macd_adjustable even before it crosses the 0 line. Lets for example cnsider a downtrend, we will see that with current implementation macd_adjustable has to be below zero line and sloping downward(i.e -ve slope) to maintain the trend. when this downtrend finishes macd_adjustable slope will transit to zero from being -ve and further to being +ve. Once the slope turns positive even below the zero line(with macd in red), it can be assumed that the trend has changed. And with a little backtesting this concept can be visualised.

Now my suggestion is to have a filter associated with macd_adjustable, so that when its slope is within a certain range, we should not trade. Moreover if the slope changed from -ve/+ve to 0(that is macd_adjustable is horizontal) then an alert should be issued, suggesting that the valus is zero and a reversal might be on the cards.

I hope I am able to explain this clearly.

I think this will eliminate lot of fake signals during the end of a trend, which can result in large drawdowns as experienced recently.

Thanks and regards.

Ravs

If we focus on the slope of macd_adjustable then we will see that as soon as the slope becomes +ve for a downtrend or -ve for an uptrend the trend starts reversing.

Oh my. This is getting too complicated. Soon we will need a 100 page instruction manual. K.I.S.S is the key to Dr Elder's strategy. Please read above post re:MACD.

Hi MKFX / TCO

MKFX Thanks for your opinion, its very informative writeup except declaring request unnecessary in bold letters. We also understand TCO is very accommodative,we only are sharing our ideas of actual observation from our demo accounts for improvement of the EA. Based on our feed back including your opinion TCO can decide it is necessary or not.Very humbly I would like to state that less knowledgeable people like us can also contribute to the forum, and  share the findings on the forum.

I will try to explain again what I wanted to point out,your post itself is talking about this doubt which I am pointing out, please refer your statement.

......(This is why Khaled and TCO have programmed the EA into only taking signals on the flip of the histogram and not the crossover). Bullish or bearish divergences in the MACD-Histogram can alert chartists to an imminent signal line crossover in MACD."....

My suggestion was to address this point only,whether the Bullish or bearish divergence Alerts in the MACD-Histogramme is being recognized and used in the TCO 1.4 or not,the indicators MACD Adjustable or MACD Candles were suggested hoping to take care of this point only,(though not clear whether these indicators are written properly or otherwise,as i dont know coding, but TCO is surely master of coding,he will come to know). if this alerts are not taken care of already in present EA, which only TCO can answer, our suggestion was to look into it.Of course we should use only one MACD ,if it is enough to take care of these trend divergence alerts.This is what we wanted to share on forum and to TCO,hoping it will improve EA, sorry if you felt it unnecessary.

With regards

--- 帖子 #1116 ---
Ok....ok....guys.  Here is what we are going to do.  I don't think we need another MACD.  The MACD_adjustable seems to get us into the trend much earlier than the regular MACD.  MK has asked me to look at Hanover's MACD that is very similar to MACD_adjustable, but isn't as buggy.  If  I can code the EA using that indicator and it seems to work in backtesting in as the current MACD_adjustable then we will adopt it.  Then after that and the new stoch and MA changes, that is it guys.  We don't need other stuff.  We haven't even tested what we have.  The testing that we do have going forward seems to be doing very well.   My MACD demo is up 10.2 % for 18 days worth of trading.  That isn't too bad.   So lets keep our heads.   Thanks - TCO.

Hi ravs_avs,

I fully agree with your suggestion,thats what I have been sharing in my posts.

--- 帖子 #1118 ---
Hi TCO,

Thanks for considering to look at changing MACD.Hope Hanover's MACD is able to address peaks, slants ,divergence/convergence alerts to filter the signals.My demo is also doing better,will try to load trade explorer on my thread.

--- 帖子 #1119 ---
I do fully agree, TCO, let's keep up the KISS method as far as possible, the EA works on every trend selection and we have enough indis with many different setting options to test.

I would rather see working the OrderDelayAfterClosed(TP)Profit feature but unfortunately last time CPU usage got too high.

Anyway, please stay tuned and have a nice weekend!

jdva

--- 帖子 #1120 ---
I second this. Moreover I consider this the only important feature which is now lacking in this excellent bot. All these multiple trend selection methods (EMA/SMA/MA) different types of MACD etc. is not relevant and mere cosmetics, because no single indicator or any combination, can give you 100% correct signal. But the ability to pause the bot if the trades closed at TP or SL, is definitely important. So, I really hope that TCO will consider adding this functionality.

--- 帖子 #1121 ---
Thanks TCO

I'm a simple man. K.I.S.S.

Hi TallCoolOne.

The bug in MACD Adjustable is in this lines, because  it use MODE_EMA to calculate Signal_SMA line. If you want to obtain same results like to Standard MACD you need change this line in MACD Adjustable:

MACD Adjustable

//---- signal line counted in the 2-nd additional buffer

for(i=0; i<limit; i++)

ind_buffer5=iMAOnArray(ind_buffer4,Bars,SignalSMA,0,MODE_EMA,i);

Standard MACD

//---- signal line counted in the 2-nd buffer

for(i=0; i<limit; i++)

SignalBuffer=iMAOnArray(MacdBuffer,Bars,SignalSMA,0,MODE_SMA,i);

If you want to use Standard MACD Line for determine the Trend, is only necessary to use value 3 from MACD Adjustable indicator.

With regards,

Maudur

--- 帖子 #1123 ---
Standard MT4 MACD is not properly written with correct formula developed by original creator of MACD. If anything I would stay with adjustable until TCO decides if he wants to use another correct formulated MACD. I don't think Signal SMA/Mode SMA is the answer.

We all need to chill, go back to school because we are all barking up the wrong tree!

http://www.babypips.com/school/what-...indicator.html

The data showed that over the past 5-years, the indicator that performed the best on its own was the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo indicator. It generated a total profit of $30,341, or 30.35%. Over 5 years, that gives us an average of just over 6% per year!

Just re read the post and you think 6 per cent a year is good? I got stuff bringing in that guaranteed no risk never mind ichi. FX you want to be doubling your money and I know I know I going to get knocked lol. An ywr its late here have a good week.

--- 帖子 #1127 ---
Claudia, I think Erebus was being "tongue-in-cheek" there. I doubt many of us would be content with 6% per year. So far in testing, many of us have done better than that with this system on a monthly basis. Personally, I'm hoping to net 5-10% per month over the whole basket.

You may want to play with Equity Sentry EA (which I contributed in this forum). Set the ES ea to disable EA after basket close settings. Eg if u set AcctEquityPips=500, ES ea will closed when ALL open orders >=500pips and also by default DISABLE any EA including ES ea itself. In this case, u have monitored it closely and once u have some trades closed, you had to physically ENABLE EA again. You may also want to stop trading after a certain loss $ or acct equity or pips lost. All these can be set within ES ea.

--- 帖子 #1130 ---
Thanks for the tip. Will try it in case the next update doesn't have this feature.

--- 帖子 #1131 ---
I would like to repeat my question from this post http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...71#post6799771 since nobody replied to it.

What settings do u guys suggest for the BreakEven TakeProfit Parameters? I'm currently seeing the EA having a great plus for some days but he has only closed loss trades for the moment. I'm starting to think that BreakEven Takeprofit parameters could be useful here but i'm wondering where to set them?

Do you guys, who are running the EA for several weeks, prefer to take the trade until the end or take Profit and get out of the trade?

Greetings

--- 帖子 #1132 ---
Hi mr, I don't use BE and TS...I let close my whole basket at 5% profit with the CloseAfterPctProfit function...but you can choose any percent limit you feel comfortable with...

Happy Trading (HT) jdva

--- 帖子 #1133 ---
This is very personal settings; you can only select by your own experience or what you see on the chart. For me, if the price move 1/2 of the ADR, then I would hate to lose on the trade so I use maybe 55 to 75 pips and then to to BE +10 pips so there is something for the move at least.

Anything less, I think you will get stopped out too much, say if you make it only 30 or 40 pips, this is before the move really gets going; but up to you.

Good luck,

--- 帖子 #1134 ---
Hi TallCoolOne,

I just subscribed and taking a look to the EA. It is very wide however since I am getting familiar with it but I need your help to make this process more productive. Would you please share the *.set file that you use for the EMA settings on the different pairs traded. It will help me a lot to north better all parameters that the EA requires. Thanks very much for the attention.

--- 帖子 #1135 ---
TCO has provided the set files for the demos he is running in his Trade Explorer. They are attached to Post #1 and have a .txt extension.

TF

--- 帖子 #1136 ---
I'm a little bit worried about CloseAfterPctProfit parameter used with d1 macd method, because for example if we use CloseAfterPctProfit at 3% profit

ea will close all trades then it can open again trades based on macd changed opposite to the main overall trend (typically the trend of the 20/50 ema)

for example based on 20/50 we are in uptrend and macd is also on the same direction that is blue so UP too, the ea close all buy trades but then after closing macd is changed to red so ea open sell but I don't want sell because based on PA and 20/50 the trend is still UP.

maybe is it this future already added to avoid this ?  "Order Delay after closed trades added" and if so it seems to not work correctly yet.

with 20/50 method there is not this problem but with macd it could be, though I can force only long or only short but maybe a parameter to automatically disable the EA after all trades are closed by CloseAfterPctProfit function and manual activate again the ea could be a nice thing.

--- 帖子 #1137 ---
I've been trading the CloseAfterProfitPct from the first day and have never had an issue with this. Besides, if you are using MACD for your trend indication, THEN USE IT. If it is showing you a sell, then you probably should be selling. If it is in disagreement with the 20/50 EMA, here's a NEWS FLASH: one of them is wrong! If you want to use BOTH the MACD and 20/50 EMA, then select BOTH of them in your EA settings, and it will only take trades when they are in agreement.

Some of you people are making this way too hard. This EA is working AS-IS. It doesn't need any more parameters or functionality. If you don't want it to trade after a a TP, then just turn the thing off. Yes, this is an EA, but you do have the power to intercede if you really want it to behave a little differently. Personally, I think it's doing pretty darn well on auto-pilot so far.

Thank you turtlefan, yes you are right, just a question because it can happen that after trades all closed by CloseAfterProfitPct I'm not in front the pc, so just just a doubt, anyway it's not a real problem...even if ea open some orders in the wrong direction I can close them if I want when I can back to the pc.

--- 帖子 #1140 ---
Acosma,

Did u go thru the posts here, I contributed the link to download Equity Sentry EA, which I just explained a few posts back to Formatix how the ES ea AUTOMATICALLY (by default) DISABLE ALL ea including itself and you will have to ENABLE it manually. Pls refer to link and see whether this is helpful

http://www.ea-coder.com/forex-softwa.../#.UdthfaxYXbo

Its freeware, and user guide is quite simplified to understand. Try it with demo and tweak to your comfort

PS: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...69#post6800769

I understand why its difficult to search for most things, coz u wont know what u wanted, but its on the same page of your question, your post was 1139, my reply was 1132. Have fun with ES ea. I have been using it even with my live acct. I dont use TCO Trader with acctequity%. With this setting you must have larger and larger lot sizes in order to satisfy that %. Eg 3% of $1000=$30, but as your capital grows, eg, $5000=$150. With TCO Trader u could by default (per TCO set files) use Acct% to open trades, that is, as capital grows lot sizes grows. Which would in effect (supposed) gave u that $150.

But in reality its easier to set a "fix" number of reasonable pips for TCO Trader to "reach" target on 2-3 days trading. After observing, I realised that EA could obtain abt 300pips per day or abt 2-3days depending on conditions. This is to avoid trades being dragged into the mud and getting too much into high negative until they hit SL. By basket closing them at a reasonable "intra-day" profit target, its easier to protect your small acct (esp when u have a small acct)

There is no bible, just your own comfort and observation of how fast trades can hit that target and just how many negatives or how big those negatives can get as trades get in play longer

PS: My live acct reach 300pips within TCO Trader opening trades after just abt 7hrs. The first trade was opened 7/jun/2013, 0800 and basket was closed with total 328pips at 7/jun/2013 at 1530 (7.5hrs to be exact)

--- 帖子 #1141 ---
hi ymleong thanks but I can code myself the ea cuz I know mql4 coding so I didn't looked at equity sentry ea.

--- 帖子 #1142 ---
Hi TallCoolOne on dynamiclotsize2:

if(DynamicLotSize2 == true)

{

int LotSizeMult =  AccountBalance()/LotSizePerBal;

LotSize = LotSizeMult * LotSizePer;

LotSizeMethod = "Lot Per Balance";

}

I see you used int LotSizeMult= ... instead of double LotSizeMult, did you purposely used int type ?

because with int type LotSizeMult is truncated to integer for example 5.9412 become 5.0 so

LotSize = LotSizeMult * LotSizePer;

become

with int LotSizeMult  5 * 0.01 -> after normalization with precision of 2 it is 0.05 lotsize

with double LotSizeMult 5.9412 * 0.01 -> after normalization with precision of 2 it is 0.06 lotsize

--- 帖子 #1143 ---
Yes, that is how I designed it, because if balance isn't $6000 yet, we don't want lot size of .06.    Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1144 ---
Hi TCO & others

TCO: I found my own answer to lot size calculation using acct equity. Your EA logic also took into consideration the SL (which I forgot is the correct way to calculate risk based lot size.) I thought u simply used Acct Equity then cal the lot size based on pair's EP

Others: I am not sure whether this makes sense. 20-50ema trades Gold better, 3ss will just pancaked it, I have tried it for 1 mth and ALL my 3ss gold trades went to SL without a single surviver (worst than Titanic tragedy). Whilst using the original 20-50ema, I had 8/12 trades that hit 320tp. I used 160sl and 320tp.

But this is something "quirky" which I sorta "discovered". I used TCO Trader and ema method to trade Gold, but I set WPR% confirmation=TRUE. BAD choice, coz trade was taken way early and got dragged thru abt 320pips negative. Fortunately when I checked against the Daily trend its a downtrend so EA opening a sell was ok. I changed the WPR% confirmation back to False and set EMA Cross Confirmation=TRUE. The logic, if u wanted to trade that currency pair with TCO Trader BUT using ema method, then it make more "sense" to have EMA Cross confirmation then WPR%. WPR% was adopted by 100pips for his original 3ss EA.

DUD! I am amazed by my own blockheadness sometimes.

But it was a good thing that I monitored my trades (YA its on DEMO) The result? (any changes after my "diligence"), the 2nd Gold Trade was taken perfectly when the uptrend on the 1hr chart had completed its push up exercise and went snakes again AFTER that 1st bar CLOSED down on the 1hr chart. BEAUTIFUL! (Bar closed was coz of the checkonceperbar settings)

--- 帖子 #1145 ---
yes, you are right but the strange think is that it's opening trades at 0.07 with a balance=599.66 and a bonus credit of 176.40 so equity about 786.00

and

extern bool    DynamicLotSize2 = true;      // Use Lot per Balance lot sizing

extern double  LotSizePerBal = 100;         // Per Balance

extern double  LotSizePer = 0.01;            // Lot size

since mine it's a micro account.

based on the calculation it should open at 0.05 not 0.07, I'm trying to figure why.....

--- 帖子 #1146 ---
Basket closed PER cur pair, PER acct profit %

--- An alternative easy DIY solution

DUD! I just realised how I could use acct percent% close on PER TRADE, no need to search for EA or code the ES ea to do that.

Eg, default magic number=0, use magic number eg, 111 for Gold. Place acctpercent% for Gold ITSELF using parms included into TCO_Trader, it will "forced" EA to close trades with 111. Then change ES ea's magic number from -1 (WHICH MEANT ALL THE OPEN TRADES even if those are opened by God himself,  to 0, meaning no magic number). SO when Gold hits acctpercentprofit% it closes EA=111, and ES ea will basket close ALL the OTHERS that had NO magic numbers.

If I wanted acc%profit PER TRADE not just for GOLD? Place different magic numbers with EACH CHART, so TCO ea itself will help to close EACH cur pair based on that %. But in this case, ES ea will have no function. Coz ES ea will have to repeat itself over different charts just to do so due to the magic numbers PER pair

NEATO!

--- 帖子 #1147 ---
Hi,

quote:
You set WPR% confirmation=TRUE. BAD choice, coz trade was taken way early   ???

end quote.

This is strange. According to the sourcecode in this situation, the previous WPR value must be smaller then the current Oversold level AND the current WPR value  must be bigger than the OS level.

In other words : The EA waits with a buy till price gets out of the oversold area.

So, it should not buy too early in any case. If you get a bad price however, there must be another reason.

What I suspect is that you get a worse price because it's getting out of the oversold area and jumping up too quickly.

When you set WPR confirmation = false, the EA looks only and buys only when price is below the oversold level.

Happy Hip Punting.

--- 帖子 #1148 ---
Hi TCO,

Here are the settings that I am using with your EA.

I am manually intervening occasionally to take profit. I close all profitable positions at the end of the week. I also increase lot size at the end of the week.

Regards

Neio

--- 帖子 #1149 ---
I'll be completely honest with you here. For you to have made over 70% on the account in less than 10 days means your lot sizes are way too large to be sustainable. That is a recipe for an account crash and burn.

TF

--- 帖子 #1150 ---
Yes. a lot size of .75 is a lot unless you have $75000 account.

--- 帖子 #1151 ---
I am sure you are both right....I hope to go live at the end of the month. Will probably use smaller lot sizes. I would be happy with 10-20% a month.

--- 帖子 #1152 ---
Hey Rex, somehow it went to sell and next minute Gold started spiralling upwards quickly, but daily chart was still downtrend, thus its a valid trade setup. NOT with the 1hr ema cross, coz I had original 20-50ema running and the 1hr chart indicated one red/one yellow triangle THROUGHTOUT when 1st sell trade was taken (neutral, I guess).

I dont believe that my 2 demos  (original 3ss, original 20-50ema) started at same time, could have such different results for Gold, but there it is. I have all but given up any hopes of trading Gold with 3ss. Although its true that I cant exactly press the ENABLE ea at exact same time, but its started within 3-5mins of each other. I saved up the templates based on 160/280 or 160/320 (SL vs TP) and just apply it to my 3ss as well as 20-50ema. (I know that 100 had a WHOLE long list of different values for 20-50ema, but he did say that he wanted to try to parallel these sl/tp, so I just did it first to see how each handles those same trades)

Its INTERESTING, but I failed to really explain how this works really, it just works! 1359+pips just Gold (in LIVE, 15/18 profitable trades ) and similar 1000+pips in Demo is definitely Great news! I have officially switch to TCO Trader with ema and ema cross=true for Gold (DEMO & Live), using ATR sl=1.2, and ATR tp=1.5, whilst most cur pairs are defaulted as sl=2x ATR, tp=3x ATR. I had ES ea to basket closed on 300pips, so the ATR is "emergency brakes" mostly

PS: Its not easy to trade Gold (coz of the spreads), it needs its own magic number preferably and set to acct percent % profit close to capture that profit. ES ea will ignore it if the magic number is set in ES ea. Eg most TCO Trader out of box had 0 or no magic number, which u could set yourself. So if u set ES ea to have magic number=0, it will deal with manual trades as well as trades by TCO Trader. Then u set Gold to have its own individual magic number eg 111 and set True for Acct % Profit close to easily manage 5-6 cur pairs + Gold. Gold had wider spreads true, but in actuality, once u had the trend right, its a TOTAL fants long positional trade. Within 1 hr, there may be spikes, like what happen to my 1st gold trade and that spike can be very scary (I got spike that went 600+pips). But during last mth, I had already closed 1000+pips on Gold and all SELL trades.

Theres nothing like Gold which had this unique behavior. You are actually better off trading this than silver or "weird" cur like ZARUSD, USDPLN etc (Urgghhhh........ ). You would most likely politely tell me, Hey Read 1st post "Trending EA" meaning instruments that have almost no vol or very low vol, wont work. At least this blockhead (me) had gotten that idea somewhat correctly

--- 帖子 #1154 ---
Yes rec'd their mailer yesterday, its a freeware by BJC or iticsoftware. But I had tried their freeware b4, stoch, 3ema etc. They kinda trade once per mth, and not ncessarily a lot of friendly parms for u to consider and tweak and tuned (NOT to mention, not profitable).

Unless u like watching grass grows, it might be a better "entertainment" choice than using their folder of free EAs. Their freeware indicators are ok though, but since they dont trade, u can use it off the shelves for your chart analysis.

--- 帖子 #1157 ---
Good words to here.  There will always be draw down.  You see it in back testing as well as forward testing.  Just need to hang tough.   In the past I would have said.....this strategy doesn't work....I need to find a new one...flitting around and around.

I have almost completed my testing with 1.5  and also my WPR vs. Stoch testing for all methods.  Should be releasing the new EA and testing spreadsheet shortly.   In  my testing so far for the MA strategies that LWMA is a better choice over EMA, so I may reset my EMA demo with this after the release of 1.5   Also, 1.5 will allow you to choose 3 MACD methods - macd_adjustable,  macd_trad colored(hanover - supposed to be like adjustable with the bug fixes) and macd - traditional.    Right now I'm finding the MACD traditional to be more profitable in back testing, but I still need to complete all my testing with it.   The spreadsheet with have these headers, MACD - ADJUSTABLE, MACD - TRAD COLORED, MACD - TRADITIONAL, MA - EMA, MA - LWMA, ICHIMOKU and TURTLE.  Under these headers there well be test results for these pairs AUDCAD, AUDCHF, AUDJPY, AUDNZD, AUDUSD, CADJPY, CHFJPY, EURAUD, EURCAD, EURGBP, EURJPY, EURNZD, EURUSD, GBPAUD, GBPCAD, GBPCHF, GBPJPY, GBPNZD,GBPUSD, NZDCHF, NZDJPY, NZDUSD, USDCAD, USDCHF & USDJPY.

For each pair there will be results for last 18 mos showing P/L and PF.  Also, the spread has been set to a fixed 4.0 for all testing.

WPR without confirmation

WPR with confirmation

Stoch without confirmation

Stoch SMA on low/high

Stoch SMA on close

Stoch EMA on low/high

Stoch EMA on close

Stoch SMMA on low/high

Stoch SMMA on close

Stoch LWMA on low/high

Stoch LWMA on close

Stoch with confirmation

Stoch SMA on close

Stoch EMA on low/high

Stoch EMA on close

Stoch SMMA on low/high

Stoch SMMA on close

Stoch LWMA on low/high

Stoch LWMA on close

At the bottom of the spreadsheet, there will be a total for each method  so that you can see which ones were most profitable, at least in back testing.  Should be a good indicator for what signal methods work well with each trend method.   I hope anyways.

Dear TCO,

I've been following this thread from very beginning, read it at least 5 times and set up MT4 at least 10 times but for some reason (unknown to me) no trades are opening despite system seems to be activated.

Any suggestions?

Tks, lind

--- 帖子 #1159 ---
Here is one suggestion.  If you are suing Bar Mode, which it appears you are.  The EA must be on the lower TF chart, which would be the 1 Hour chart, not the daily.    Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1162 ---
Wow, huge amount of work!  I also have been doing some testing and optimization for the past 12 months using tick data.  For me the Ichimoku has given the best results for the Daily and generally Williams % better for hourly but for each pair the variables of each have been tweaked to get the best results.  I have found the break even, jumping stop and trailing don't help....biggest factor is the ATR multipliers for SL and TP.  Confirmation seems to always bring better results and for some reason the weekly MACD doesn't seem to made any difference on or off.  I find that the profit factor is best using max 2 positions.

Hi TCO,

Thanks for your great work sharing with all of us.

I need a clarification:

When you choose Manual trend of "Go Long" or "Go Short" , does it overrides the Auto trend methods 1 - 4, and places orders based on the short TF method selection of stochastic or w% ? Or one still have to choose one of the auto trends along with the manual trend selection?

I would prefer first one, means if I select Manual method, it should override auto trend selection and use only short TF (1HR) to place trades according to manual selection and the choice of stochastic or w% .

Kindly clarify.

Regards

--- 帖子 #1166 ---
Yes. Go long or short overrides auto trend. It will still use stochs or WPR to trigger trades.

--- 帖子 #1167 ---
Hi MKFX,

Thanks a lot.

I want to try stochastic for trade placement , as you have strongly recommended it in this forum, but I dont have experience with it.

Also TCO is providing so many permutation combinations of Stoch. Can you help me to understand what he is incorporating and what combination of Stoch is best to use.

Also if you can provide a Good Stochastic indicator here( though it is there in MT4 Indi list, if that is ok to use) with suggested settings to put on the chart (EA does not need it but for manual checking).

With regards

--- 帖子 #1168 ---
Please can I ask for additional clarification here on this?

Will the WPR or stochs trigger the trades in the direction desired regardless of the trend method in use eg MACD says trend is short, but I want only longs for the pair at this time, will a long trigger when WPR gives the appropriate long signal?

A truly fantastic EA, many congrats to TCO and the others who contributed to it. If it has a fault, it may be trying to be all things to all people, I agree with others here to KISS it.

--- 帖子 #1169 ---
Turtle method.

How does this work? Is it simply that a trade will trigger in whatever direction the 20 period high/low is breached, and if so which TF should the ea work on?

Are all the other parameters disabled eg MACD, WPR etc that are used with the other trend methods?

Usually the Turtle is used with daily TF, although I am sure it could be applied to smaller TF.

Thank you for a very friendly thread.

--- 帖子 #1170 ---
Turtle works the same as Ichimoku, MACD or 20/50 EMA as far as this EA goes = they determine the trend on the Daily chart

You can see this when you open the EA settings, surely that must be understandable?

For all trend methods, trade entry is triggered on the 1 hour chart by either the W%R or Stochastic; also you must make a choice in the settings

It is so devilishly simple, I am amazed by the questions repeated over & over, but I guess if you never used any EA before, it can be confusing

--- 帖子 #1171 ---
I was so puzzled by the last question, I went to Post #1 to see if I missed anything, here is the very first things to read, it seems quite clear to me!

TCO TRADER EA

It is based on a couple of 100PipsADay strategies and also Ichimoku and Turtle. Basically it determines the daily trend using 4 different methods (select 1-4) and then uses the Williams%R or Stochastic to enter trades on the lower TF.

TCO Trader EA – Features

The EA will let you select up to 4 different trend methods for a higher time frame - the default with be daily = 1440

Higher TF Trend Modes - can be set to whatever Higher TF you desire, the EA is now designed to work with 1-4 methods so if you can enter up to 4 different methods for the Trend Mode. All methods selected must be true to determine the overall trend.
Ichimoku - Tenkan Sen/Kijun Sen cross, with a Kijun Sen trailing stop loss feature. 20/50 EMA – 100PipsADay's basic strategy Adjustable MACD Trend above/below zero – based on Third Screen MACD strategy Turtle Channel
Lower TF Trade Entry - can be set to whatever TF you desire. You can select the Williams % R method or Stochastic method for lower TF signals

Williams % entry - also can set true/false for confirmation, which means for a buy trade, the Williams % would go under -80 level and then have to go above
-80 level for a buy trade to be placed. If this is toggled off, the buy trade would be triggered as soon as it goes below the -80 level. For a sell trade, if the confirmation is set to true, the Williams % would go above -20 level and then below -20 level for the sell trade to be triggered. If the confirmation is set to false, it just has to be above the -20 level to trigger the sell trade

Stochastic entry - also can set true/false for confirmation, which means for a buy trade, the Stochastic would go under 20 level and then have to go above

20 level for a buy trade to be placed. If this is toggled off, the buy trade would be triggered as soon as it goes below the 20 level. For a sell trade, if the confirmation is set to true, the Stochastic would go above 80 level and then below 80 level for the sell trade to be triggered. If the confirmation is set to false, it just has to be above the 80 level to trigger the sell trade

Maudur,

Are  you using the TCO EA for your trading as shown in your explorer and what are your setting?are you day trading with the EA

--- 帖子 #1174 ---
I explored his explorer and see that ALL trades are on EUR-USD so I do not believe it can be the TCO Trader EA doing this.

Also, he has long EUR-USD and all the trend methods are showing a sell right now, or maybe not after those 2 huge days!

--- 帖子 #1175 ---
So sorry to have troubled you at all.

I was actually hoping I had finally found an EA that would trade the Turtle strategy itself, but I understand that this EA just uses the Turtle strategy as a trend indicator, and then has to wait for the WPR or stoc to give a signal in the trend direction. The classic Turtle method says enter one pip beyond the high/low, no further trigger required.

No need to talk down to people making enquiries, given the name of the option it was a fair question from anyone who knows the Turtle strategy. Please don't be fooled by my no. of posts, under another name I have hundreds of posts and a couple of vouches, and even my own EA.

Well done TCO et al, I like the MACD/WPR strategy, and it works nicely so far. When I have given it a few months on demo and figured out how to trade it I will start it on on my live a/c.

Cheers

Wow! even TCO demo accts have slide faster than Titanic had sunk. What a lousy week for all.

Observed the results and tracking those abt 3wks now, and this is somewhat fuzzy logic results

Cur vs Method

audcad ema

audjpy ema, macd, ichi

audnzd macd, ema

audusd ema, ichi

euraud ema, ichi

eurjpy macd

eurusd macd

gbpaud ema, ichi

gbpnzd ema, macd

gbpusd macd

nzdusd ema, ichi

*** Personal favorite, XAUUSD, ema (not track via TCO demo accts via my own live acct)

* NOTE: Not an exact science from the tracking via demo accts uploaded by TCO, it seems those cur pairs trading those methods, if they are -ve, they STAYED negative quite a lot and even when they are positive, they dont gain much. eg AUDUSD had been on top of the list of ichi, ema since start of demo (via TCO demo accts) Whilst its also somewhat indicated that certain cur pairs just dont "like" other trading methods. I have posted that despite starting both original 3ss and 20-50ema on same day abt 5 mins apart, none of my gold trade survives 3ss. Somehow certain indicators work well with that pair even over the longer term.

*PS: Using mixed trending methods with TCO trader ea on live and my accts have just turned from -ve1000+pips to positive abt 48hrs later. Abt 4 trades hit the sl (at defauled ATR=2). The rest is bravely plugging on. Patience, Risk Mgt (10x risk mgt, vs 3x patience to wait out the trend). Not sure abt how best to tune ATR, will wait for TCO to help with those reports, might be mind blowing!

May the market moves in our favor

--- 帖子 #1180 ---
TCO thanks again for your work on the EA and now the backtests you are mentioning, such a massive efffort and contribution to the forexfactory community.

Something to consider for a future update is the option to close all open trades at the end of a the trading week i.e. go into weekends flat and new trades opening again from Monday.

--- 帖子 #1181 ---
You can make that decision for that and action now, don't need any EA for that surely!

** UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE **

Hi Team, I have posted version 1.5 in post 1 along with an updated instructions. The external parameters have changed. So please verify your settings when using the updated EA. Thanks for your patience. Please ask questions, report issues, bugs and post your results.   I also posted my back testing results.  Thanks!

TCO Trader v1.5

- Added MA Method and Price Method to the MA Trend Method (no longer just EMA)

- Added MA Method and Price Method to Stochastic Signal Method

- Added 2 more MACD methods - Hanover (corrected adjustable) and Traditional

- Added off/on for alerts

- Lower TF Method selection changed from boolean to integer - to make optimization easier

--- 帖子 #1185 ---
TCO,

Thank you very much for all your hard work in programming this EA.

--- 帖子 #1186 ---
Wow, that's a LOT of work there, my friend. Many thanks for sharing your valuable efforts.

I think the most encouraging thing about those backtests is that over the entire time frame (is that a year?), ALL were profitable. So it is just a matter of sticking with the method through the rough patches (like last week). The rest is a matter of degree.

Thanks again.

WOW! WOW! WOW!

Guys a little bit of help here, TCO had done such a great job that I now need a TCO EA encyclopedia to "map" the excel results back to EA settings

Ok, eg, (looking at the excel test results), based on highlighted rows (which is the selected pair to compute the ending total results)

MACD Adjustable

Cur=AUDCAD
NO CON Stoch ema close ==> $609.23, PF=1.72

So, I shld set these parms which "map" to the result above ("map" as in settings, not in results necessarily)

(included the instructions from user guide so that its clear and its color coded for easy reading)

Automated Trend Methods

1. Ichimoku

2. 20/50 EMA

3. MACD

4. Turtle Channel

Trend_Method_1 = 3        - Select 1 of 4 methods

Trend_Method_2 = 0        - Select 1 of 4 methods or leave as zero

Trend_Method_3 = 0        - Select 1 of 4 methods or leave as zero

Trend_Method_4 = 0        - Select 1 of 4 methods or leave as zero

Lower_TF_Meth = 2        - Set to 1 for Williams % or set it to 2 for Stochastic.

Stoch_MAmethod = 1        - 0 - SMA, 1 - EMA, 2 - SMMA, 3 - LWMA

Stoch_PriceMethod = 1        - 0 - Low/High  1 - Close

Stoch_Confirmation = false     - Stochastic signal signal must go below and then above OS for buy and must go above and below OB for sell

MACD_Method = 1              - Set to 1 - MACD Adjustable method, 2 to use MACD Hanover method, 3 to use MACD Traditional method

==========================================================================================================

2nd eg. MACD Adjustable

Cur=AUDCHF
WPR W/O CON, Profit=$908.79, PF=1.75

Trend_Method_1 = 3
Lower_TF_Meth = 1
WPR_Confirmation = false
MACD_Method = 1

==========================================================================================================

Did I missed anything to set? eg since this is tested against ema, shld these parms get set too? Parms NOT included here are assumed to be defaulted as per user guide.

==========================================================================================================

MA_MAmethod = 1;           - 0 - SMA, 1 - EMA, 2 - SMMA, 3 - LWMA

MA_PriceMethod = 0;          - 0 - Close, 1 - Open, 2 - High, 3 - Low, 4 - Median Price, 5 - Typical Price, 6 - Weighted

There are parms and parms and similiar parms, just lost, hopefully someone can figure it out better than me

PS: TCO thanks a lot, u have given so much more than we asked for that once this got sorted out, I will try my best to see how to write a guide to the settings in the EA vs the results u have given. Fair enough? I supposed MACD weekly confirmation is not necessarily to set at all?

--- 帖子 #1197 ---
Fantastic piece of work TCO!!

Can I ask what your SL and TP's were for each pair, ie did you use ATR?  Also what were your max. number of orders and order delays?

Think we've all got some research to do.  Cheers!

--- 帖子 #1198 ---
Excellent question, I can only assume that he used the earliest known parameters of the original method by 100_pips, huge targets & stops

But let's wait and see what TCO comes back with

When you factors these things in, the number of tests becomes huge, making this a gargantuan task

PS: TCO, they need you over at Hopwood's House of EA's

--- 帖子 #1199 ---
Yes I guess that's what TCO has used; I think ultimately what will really transform already great figures is the stop loss/target optimisation.

Also TCO can I ask what percentage you risked per trade or did you use a fixed lot size?

Many thanks again.

--- 帖子 #1200 ---
Thanks TOC!!

Massive work done here and greatly appreciated.  Along the lines of other queries; what parameters where used for the backtests?  Any optimization?  Very encouraging results!

Cheers

--- 帖子 #1201 ---
Yes TCO you have created something special, but we will never know how special until we stop tinkering with it, and do some decent forward testing. The back tests should only give us a clue as to the effectiveness of an EA, but this market is never the same from one day to the next, just too many variables, and then there are our "friendly" market makers, always willing to take our money one way or another.

From my side I am sticking to MACD and WPR and giving it a good 3 month minimum forward test before I put a cent of real money down.

--- 帖子 #1202 ---
TCO,

I have no idea why the EA kept trying to open a buy order on N/U. It did not meet my criteria but what was most important was the EA on that specific pair was switched off (Allow live trading unchecked). Error 4109 kept popping up after the attempts. Very weird.

--- 帖子 #1203 ---
Very sorry Newentrader.   I will try to get that loaded up as soon as I can.  I'm at work right now.  Let me see what I can do.  Seems like when posting updates there are a millions ways to makes mistakes and I'm finding them all.   Sorry for the confusion and inconvenience.   Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1204 ---
The fact that you have live trading unchecked, causes the 4109 error.

The EA tries to buy, but that is not allowed because you unchecked it.

When you are sure, the conditions are such that no buying should take place, there is a bug in the logic of he program somewhere.

--- 帖子 #1205 ---
Hi Guys, thanks for the kind words.  I'm very sorry about not being more specific on the back testing.  The back testing dates were from 1/2/2012 to 5/27/2013.

Starting balance of $10,000, I used TTF = 1440, LTF = 60,  0.01 per $1000 for lot sizing, barmode, 8 max trades, 12 bar delay.  ATR TP 3,  ATR SL 2.   So the only other tweaks are outlined in the spreadsheet under each trend method, under each pair.  This is no guarantee of future success, but it should give us a good indication of what might work going forward.   Thanks - TCO.

--- 帖子 #1206 ---
Okay. the MACD trad colored   indicator has been saved in post 1.  I found it on Hanover's thread.     Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1207 ---
TCO,

Regret but no sucess. I'm doing following:

1)  Copy TCO_Trader EA into Experts folder

2)  Copy macd_adjustable & MA ribbon filled 2 x 14 indicators into the Indicators folder

3)  Copy the template into Templates folder

4)  Restart MT4 platform

5)  Load template onto desired lower time frame (1hr) chart for each pair you wish to trade.

6)  Pull EA over on chart (1hr).

Do I need to change anything in the EA settings or default settings should be enough.

Tks, lind

--- 帖子 #1208 ---
Hi Lind, post your setting file here, and I will take a look tonight when I get home.  Sorry for the difficulties.   Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1209 ---
Thanks TCO for your hard work.  I have this problem.  I replace 1.4 with 1.5.  But after I pulled it over on the chart it still says 1.4 Any clues any body

Dear TCO

Many tanks from switzerland for all you work.

I did search within the forum about how to configure the LWMA method. Actually, I cannot figure out how to configure the LWMA method in the ea.

How can this been configured?

--- 帖子 #1216 ---
TCO and Rexio

Ok. It is definitely a bug. It happened again as I was at the computer. Lower TF was at OB/OS area and met the condition set to open a trade. Although the EA is turned off on the N/U pair, it still tries to open trade but encounters an error code 4109. It continues trying to  open a short position over and over and over, ect.... again. The EA was set up to only open short positions, but earlier it was set up to open only long positions. I changed the setting to see if there was a bug. Hope the info helps.

--- 帖子 #1217 ---
Have you had any trades open now that the EA is on 1 hours charts?

Apart from actually knowing which method you are / want to trade, it should work with default settings.

Have you clicked on top toolbar of MT4?

Hi Erebus, its me, the blockheaded, sometimes fuzzy minded gal (with the blond hair, what do u expect ). I guess TCO is too over swamped with bug fixes and whats not, please see whether u could help me out, reference post
http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...40#post6818940

I am still at the trying to figure it out stage. (As posted once I got this right, I will see how I could translate it to settings Excel that will hopefully help another fuzzy minded person with or without blond hair)

Anybody pleeze, totally lost by the new settings intro by TCO. (Guess its the adage too many cooks spoilt the soup). Although TCO Trader is kinda more like whats called a "Master's soup". A soup whereby u used all kinds of yummy ingredients to boil it, then u freeze unused portion, and add more ingredients and water and boil over and over. (PS: Its an actual dish that even famous world chef made, its used as top stock soup or for favoring or even stiry frying vegs)

--- 帖子 #1219 ---
Yes, but my eyes did not expect that it has something to do with stochastic, so I did simply not see it.

--- 帖子 #1220 ---
On the contrary, I think you have a very good understanding of the settings, the tests and how to achieve them; what I am not clear on is, which method do you want to trade - or do you want to trade each pair as per it's best results settings?

Because as you know, future results will not be the same as past testing for sure!

So as for the referenced post, I can not make out what the issue is that you are trying to address, maybe if you could just make a short post?

--- 帖子 #1221 ---

--- 帖子 #1222 ---
Hi Erebus,

Yes, last 24hrs AUD/USD and NZD/USD were opened and that's it. Have done (I think at least) everything as per instruction but still.... Would you share your EA settings?

I have no doubt this system is great but need to get up and running. By the way 'Third Screen Strategy' and 'D1 - 20 EMA & 50 EMA' are working without any problems and therefore failing to understand why this is not working.

PS - comments made by ymleong are not very constructive

--- 帖子 #1223 ---
Sure no problem, it is right here in Dropbox

Another silly question, you do have the EA on every chart and those are all 1 hour charts?

PS: change the txt file extension to SET

--- 帖子 #1224 ---
Ok 1st issue: if I settle on eg Turtle and stoch ema close with Con, I dont even know whether I got the correct "concept" of what other indicators I got to set to emulate what the EA was trying to do that fitted the test result. Once I get passed the "mapping" necessary for ONE trend method with those indicators to be set under that TREND method, then I can go abt figuring out the rest.

Esp when if u look into the parms, there are TWO sets of ma, one with stoch.... prefix, one without. I am only quite confused over the MA....parms on whether this shld be set cos they had same selections of MA

==========================================================================================================

MA_Slow = 50            - Slow MA setting

MA_MAmethod = 1;           - 0 - SMA, 1 - EMA, 2 - SMMA, 3 - LWMA

MA_PriceMethod = 0;          - 0 - Close, 1 - Open, 2 - High, 3 - Low, 4 - Median Price, 5 - Typical Price, 6 - Weighted

EMA_Cross = false        - Set to true to enforce EMA cross - 20EMA above 50EMA for buys, 20EMA below 50EMA for sells

========================================================================================

Stoch_MAmethod = 0        - 0 - SMA, 1 - EMA, 2 - SMMA, 3 - LWMA

Stoch_PriceMethod = 0        - 0 - Low/High  1 - Close

=========================================================================================

Eg, to use macd adjustable, stoch ema closed, I had to set Stoch.... parms, but what abt MA.... parm? (is this for EMA method specific).

===========================================================================================

MACD parms are self explanatory so I got this correct, hopefully) ie, eg,

MACD_Method = 1              - Set to 1 - MACD Adjustable method, 2 to use MACD Hanover method, 3 to use MACD Traditional method

(This is the column title in the test results under "MACD". To use MACD Hanover, set MACD_Method=2, etc. If I want to use Ichi for eg, this parm is NOT used by the EA)

--- 帖子 #1225 ---
Thanks Erebus. I'll compare your setting with mine. Yes, I did open the tco_trader.tpl on 1hr chart and therafter loaded EA on same chart and like that on all currency pairs. Do you use same settings on ALL currency pairs?

--- 帖子 #1226 ---
I think this is main confusion but simple to answer

First choose the TREND method you want to trade for example MA method or 20/50 as we know

Now, there are options to set which type of MA you want to use, as per your list - these are the same choices you make every time you use a plain MA on any MT4 chart

Make that choice and setting, this is your TREND on the DAILY chart

Now down to the TRADE ENTRY choice; only 2 = Williams % Range OR Stochastic

You choose Stochastic - these settings are same as normal Stochastic you use on MT4 chart

Some other people requested to have this included with the EA, maybe they have some secret settings to use and can reply

What settings were in back test? Have to ask TallCoolOne

Anyway, these are the TRADE ENTRY settings to trigger the trade on 1 HOUR chart

Pretty simple but maybe to many options now for new users, and one must be familiar with the number for type of MA e.g.

0 - SMA, 1 - EMA, 2 - SMMA, 3 - LWMA

--- 帖子 #1227 ---
Hello all,

Just looking for opinions on optimization vs curve fitting.  Which parameters do you think we should be optimizing on the EA?  From my experimentation obviously the ATR multiplier for sl and tp make a huge difference, however I also find that adjusting the values of the daily indicators - particularly MACD and Inchimoku also makes a big difference to drawdown and profit.  My question about this is:  by adjusting these, are we merely curve fitting or do you think it will increase our odds of better trades if optimized?  When I say optimized I'm thinking about a years worth of data updated monthly.

Any related thought and ideas are appreciated

Snap, Gary.

It seems from TCO's parameters that the best methods generate between 8 and 10 times initial capital balance in 18 months.  That, initially, looks phenomenal.

However, a quick eyeball test looks like TCO's average stop loss is at least 250 pips (2 times 125 ATR say, some are 250 some are 80) and his lot size is 0.01 per $1,000.  Am I therefore right in thinking that amounts to approximately 2.5% average risk per trade, with potential to go 8 deep on each pair?

If that's so, I don't think anyone here would risk ANYTHING like that and sleep easy at night.

So I agree, it would be very interesting to see what the drawdown is, because based upon 2.5% a trade, you must be well underwater sometimes.  When I live tested this last week, I quickly realised that it would not be unusual to get 20 to 30 open trades at a time with 12 pairs traded.  That would be over 60% of your account on the line at 2.5% per trade.  So if Mr Average and Mrs Reasonable agree to risk no more than say 10% to 15% of their account tops, they would need to divide TCO's results by 5 say and risk 0.5% per trade (I still think that set-up would have potential for drawdown of 30% in a run against them).

So, perhaps a return of 1.6 to 2 times your capital in 18 months would be what the more sensible investor would plan for.  Still great, but around 4% would be the return.

Am I right with my maths or have I got a decimal point wrong somewhere?  Look forward to hearing about the drawdown and reasons why I can happily risk more!!!!!

Hi S3, that is not correct.  I started with $10,000 balance for back testing.   I used .01 per $1000 lot sizing, so my lot size initially was .10.  Also, the totals at that bottom do not take in account if all pairs were traded together on the same account, were the lot size would have increased to .11 when the balance reached $11,000 and .12 when $12,000 and so on.   So probably the $10,000 +/- profit would be more when taking into account the all the pairs.  I wish mt4 would let you set up testing for all pairs at once.  It would be nice to see the ebb and flow of DD and profit for the whole portfolio.    Thanks - TCO.

--- 帖子 #1237 ---
I hope so, his results would then surely be phenomenal!!

--- 帖子 #1238 ---
Thanks for that TCO.  So am I right (approx.) in saying your test showed $10,000 turning into $20,000 in 18 months by risking 0.1% per trade (ie micro lot with 250 pips stop loss on average)?

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1239 ---
A lot of things would be helpful.  Winning % would also be helpful.  I didn't want to spend 6 mos doing all the backtesting and recording all the results.   Sorry.  We are just looking for good indications of what works and what doesn't.  For example, if you want to use Stoch, it would be a good indication at looking at the spreadsheet that the price method of close, seems to work better than low/high.  We didn't know that 2 weeks ago.  Did we really know that WPR is better for some trend methods and Stoch for other...no we didn't.   Did we really know that all 4 trend methods seem to be profitable.  That you can optimize the trend methods together and different combinations might be more profitiable on some pairs.   Did we know that LWMA MA method seems to be a lot more profitable than EMA MA method.  No we didn't.   So.....a lot of things would be helpful, but it seems that some of this testing should already be helpful.  If you think it would be helpful than please take on some of this testing and present some results.     Any help would be greatly appreciated.   Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1240 ---
Yes, he is using micro lots.

Looking at the results in the first column of his spreadsheet (the MACD Adjustable, Selected Pairs), we see:

Worst result:

STOCH SMMA HIGH/LOW (No CON)

Profit: $3,764.95 (+37.65%)

Best result:

STOCH LWMA CLOSE (With CON)

Profit: $10,628.75 (+106.29%)

Since that is over an 18-month period, you must divide that return by 18 to get the possible monthly return. So the range of return between the worst and best methods is +2.09% to +5.91% per month, regardless of how much capital is in your account.

To many of you, I am guessing that you consider those types of results to be "chicken feed." However, if you understand the power of compounding, you will quickly see the potential in consistent returns of that amount. Obviously this is very conservative lot sizing, and you can ramp up the results by being more aggressive with your order sizes, but I am not sure that would be very wise. At the very least, increasing your lot size will probably give you ulcers during the periods of drawdown that will necessarily come. The key is to be consistent and conservative, and you will most likely be happy with the results in the end.

TF

--- 帖子 #1241 ---
Yes that sounds reasonable.  Please remember this is not a guarantee.   This is back testing and not real life.   There are no slam dunks.  So please test and be conservative.   Thanks!

One thing I also forgot to mention in the testing.  I also used close on opposite signal.  I didn't do any testing with that option turned off.

As far as optimization.  I would consider these parms as possible optimization candidates to find the best combination for each pair.  Just my guess.  Not a guarantee.

To find trend method combinations  you may get where they are all the same.  That would indicate a strong method for that pair

Trend_Method_1         Start 1   Step 1  Stop 4

Trend_Method_2         Start 1   Step 1  Stop 4

and maybe

Trend_Method_3         Start 1   Step 1  Stop 4

Lower_TF_Meth         Start 1  Step 1  Stop 2    <==   to find if WPR or Stochastic is a better choice

MA_MAmethod           Start 0  Step 1  Stop 3    <==  if MA is a good Trend Method, this will help to determine what MA method works the best

MA_PriceMethod        Start 0 Step 1  Stop 6     <== if MA is a good Trend Method, this will help to determine what Price method works the best

MACD_Method           Start 1  Step 1  Stop 4    <==  if MACD is a good Trend Method, this will help determine what MACD method works the best.

Stoch_MAmethod      Start 0 Step 1  Stop 3     <==  if Stochastic is the best signal method, this will help determine what MA method is best for Stochastic

Stoch_PriceMethod   Start 0 Step 1 Stop 1     <==  if Stochastic is the best signal method, this will help determine what Price method is best for Stochastic

Other thoughts, if I made the WPR confirmation an interger value of 1 for on and 0 for off then we could optimize that easier, the same asfor Stochastic confirmation.

If anyone else has some insights in the optimizing process, so that we don't curve fit, but find a robust profitable system.  I'm all ears.   Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1242 ---
I am happy with 4% - 5% a month.  I was basically saying that I would risk about 15% of account in drawdown to get 4% a month if results were consistent.  I did get my decimal point in the wrong place, but ended up at the same result from a risk perspective.

It's a shame we cannot get a handle on drawdown levels but, if reasonable, doubling an account in 18 months is commendable.

Thanks for clarification.

--- 帖子 #1243 ---
So far, in my 2.5 months of testing, it has been reasonable (under 10%).

TF

--- 帖子 #1244 ---
Sure, I understand and I will do some testing.  I do have one question.  Now more than before I like the MacD Adjustable.  In the new EA you have some set up choices that I did not see on the spreadsheet.  What MA was the MacD using, 1,2,3,4 in your test?  Is see the settings for Stoch and WPR, but not for the options specifically for the adjustable MacD.

--- 帖子 #1245 ---
Hello,

first time I respond to You, you did a GREAT job.I never saw something (complex) like this before. It's all tooooooo technical for me but im using your 1.4 version on a $1000 account,trading the 6 pairs we all know (pips at 0.01) and I let it running,once a day i open that account and close all winning trades........my result after 10 days is $81 so almost 10%.Not bad at all for me....so thx again for sharing this great ea

raycoboy

--- 帖子 #1246 ---
Sorry, there is only 3 MACD methods, not 4.   There are no MA methods for MACD.

1 - Adjustable,   2 - Hanover(corrected adjustable)   3 - Traditional MACD

To get Adjustable MACD, you would make these selections.

Trend_Method_1 = 3

MACD_Method = 1

--- 帖子 #1247 ---
Hi Raycoboy, that is an interesting strategy also.  What pairs are you testing and do you close all trades at end of day and then just turn on the EA again?

Nice to hear some new approaches.   Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1248 ---
Did you have Weekly Confirmation on or all, or did you find it made any difference?

--- 帖子 #1249 ---
Im just trading the 6 "headpairs", and when I see I have profit I just close the trade.At the other hand,when a trade is negative,I just let it run.....and so far not one that was closed by the EA.Its also not so that I have many trades running (just one that opened today.....so its not a mess where i pick up only the good trades,just be patient....

greetings

raycoboy

--- 帖子 #1250 ---
Everytime I use weekly confirmation, it seems to make the results less profitable, or not profitable at all.  So I don't use it.

--- 帖子 #1251 ---
Cool one, if your using the "weekly" you need a very strong trend otherwise (I guess you will have to wait a long time) but once it opens a trade you will have big profits

raycoboy

--- 帖子 #1252 ---
I do NOT close all trades TCO,just the + ones, the - trades (if there are)....i just let them run till they become+;than i close them (in the worst case your EA will close them for me) so my risks are much smaller and my profit bigger because 10 times $2 is also 20 no? mb you make the same 20 but I think you have to wait much longer and for example EURUSD i didnt saw a move for 350 pips last times (so far).I hope you understand what I mean TCO

greetings

--- 帖子 #1253 ---
Can you set up a Trade Explorer so we can see this in action?

TF

--- 帖子 #1254 ---
why is the "close order delay" not working?

--- 帖子 #1255 ---
Because I can't get it to work.  The order history is not put in order.  So we are not assured of bring back the latest closed trades.  I'm not going to try and store those orders internally to make sure they are ordered correctly.  It is a huge issue not having this.  Can you document $ lost for not having this feature?

--- 帖子 #1256 ---
Set Files

I will try my best (if anyone find this useful) to upload each Trend Method's set files and its various combinations. With reference to the backtesting excel (which u could download and pls follow along if you intend to download the set files and use them)

Eg,

Trend Method=MACD Adjustable

1) METHOD=WPR W/O Con => set file name

MACD Adjustable, WPR WO CON
2) METHOD=STOCH SMA CLOSE With Con => set file name

MACD Adjustable, SMA CLOSE W CON

Set file name is self-explanatory. Today I will upload the MACD Adjustable set files. If u decide to trade MACD Adjustable this is the set that will help u. Then choose the various methods & just load up that set file and you are all "set" (pun fully intended)

PS: Pls give your feedback whether you will find this useful, otherwise I will keep the settings to myself. Rest of the settings is defaulted "out of the box"

Have fun

Hi All,

Here's something I used for my TCO trader testing

I always assigned a different magic number to each chart, this way u can make use of TCO Trader's parm of setting acct profit close % and get to know just which cur will do well with that method u choose. Its more helpful than using Equity Sentry ea. A little trick is to even cleared out SL/TP to 0, then set acct loss close % as well. Eg if you wanted 3% profit, then consider also 3% loss. Coz thats 1:1. I find it a very neat way to give me somewhat of an indication of what works and what may not

ES ea will help to monitor the entire acct, it does allow u to input magic numbers, but imagine if u want to track like 20 pairs or whatever, and u want each to be tracked more strictly in terms of profitability per cur? You will end up with 20 charts with TCO trader, another 20 charts with ES ea.

If u do a basket close on ALL open trades, u still dont know which cur is more profitable, coz the basket close may happen when some trades had just opened, which makes it looks as if its always lossing $. (a false positive result).

PS: Maybe if we all do this knowledge swap by sharing our own little "tricks" or test results, all of us will gain something

BTW: Someone posted that I had to recompile the TCO Trader ea if I need a magic number there? I just placed the magic number without re-compiling. Pls let me know:-do I recompile once with any magic numbers, or multiple times with different magic numbers.

--- 帖子 #1258 ---
hi ymleong,

I believe you can just change the magic numbers without re-compiling the EA. Just change them before hitting the "Expert Adviser" button.

cheers

ck

--- 帖子 #1259 ---
Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1260 ---
Does anyone have a indicator / utility program that will show profit for entire account by magic number, or by the pairs?

--- 帖子 #1261 ---
If you set up a Trade Explorer here at FF, it will show you profit/pips by pair.

TF

--- 帖子 #1262 ---
Do what I do assigned different magic numbers to different cur or groups. Eg you may create a logical group named major which has all the xxxusd cur. Or logically group macd trend method, vs ema trend vs turtle etc. This way you can track by this group via myfxbook. You can also download via MT4 to analyse. To set the magic number, add the acct to your myfxbook login id, then under "Settings" and column heading "Magic Numbers" enter those magic numbers you assigned earlier and u can then filter these too in myfxbook.

To do a customized analysis via myfxbook, click on that acct under "Home" tab, then on top RHS, click on "Custom Analysis"  then click "Magic" tab, and click on the magic number you wanted to analyse. You can also change the date to analyse per mth, per week etc. Its a drop down calendar selection (on top of the graphics included here)

If u are still somewhat lost, just let me know how I can help

--- 帖子 #1263 ---
Good afternoon could u please put your settings H4 with entry into M15. How many pips Tp and Sl? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #1264 ---
Sorry, TCO you have lost me, I can understand trying to maybe stick to one of the most profitable overall trend method and LTF method, then choosing whether WPR, stoch, etc. But what do u mean by start 1 step 1 stop 4?

--- 帖子 #1265 ---
Hi ymleong, when you optimize using the strategy tester in MT4, you can put check marks next the the external parameters you want to optimize.   When you do this you can also select start, step and stop values.

For Example, lets say we want to find what trend method(s) works best for a certain pair.

We would select optimization on the main strategy tester screen, then on the properties screen we would put a check mark next to each of these external parameters.  We would use a start of 1, at step of 1 and a stop of 4 for each.

Start      Step       Stop

Trend_Method_1 = 0         1            1            4

Trend_Method_2 = 0         1            1            4

Trend_Method_3 = 0         1            1            4

Trend_Method_4 = 0         1            1            4

When you start the strategy tester, it will test each possible combination.  It may determine that the best combination is where all 4 are the same.  Let's say that strategy tester shows the most profitable combination to be Trend_Method_1 = 3, Trend_Method_2 = 3, Trend_Method_3 = 3, Trend_Method_4 = 3.  Then is pretty safe to say that the MACD trend method is the best for this pair.    Let's say on another test for another pair, we get Trend_Method_1 = 2, Trend_Method_2 = 3, Trend_Method_3 = 2, Trend_Method_4 = 3.   Then for this pair, it likes MA and MACD for trend methods.  So we could use that in our settings file for that pair.    So you can do that type of optimization for all the parameters I have listed.   You could also optimize the ATR TP and SL multipliers.  We just have to be careful not to curve fit.

I hope this helps.   Let me know if you have any questions.   Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1266 ---
No wonder I was left scratching my head, I had tried to do strategy test once and turns that into tragedy instead!

I will just use one or two demo and each test ONE trend and ONE method that is most profitable, according to the test results u have shared w us, eg, Ichi wpr wo con. Using different accts or even different magic numbers within one acct will be more helpful than placed a mix pot of cur pairs against various trend, ltf methods etc

But u are right, its just gives us a better over view. If according to testing results, we shld see better results for ichi wpr wo con, but no, reality is often cannot be mapped across to the strategy test report. I assume your current uploaded demo trading ichi, is out of box settings, ie, you only select trend=ichi, but the rest is defaulted, which means wpr wo con, and no stoch for demo coz its running the older version

PS: Hope u find the ea analyser useful? (Did u even have a chance to go download it)

--- 帖子 #1267 ---
Hi TCO,

Just "discovered" something is maybe buggy. I have placed different magic numbers to different cur pairs, with acct profit% close set to 3%. Despite that, its still closing other cur pairs, with different magic numbers. Afraid cant fathom out MQL language, pleeze some help. I think its not counting accountbalance by magic number, its accumulating by entire acct?

Its not opposite signal, coz when tranx were close out, there were no opp trades created

PS: I really dont know MQL language, but I guess its kinda of SQL like, I was thinking that it shld be something like accountProfit(magicnumber) >= (AccountBalance(MagicNumber)*(profitPct/100)

=============================================================================================================

// Global Profit Close

if((CloseAfterPctProfit==true) && (AccountProfit()>=(AccountBalance()*(ProfitPct/100))))

{

CloseAllTrades(MagicNumber);

if(Show_Alerts == true)

{

Alert("Account Profit Reached. Attempting To Close All Open Orders");

Print("Account Profit Reached. Attempting To Close All Open Orders");

}

=============================================================================================================

Hi alpine,

I use Myfxbook (www.myfxbook.com).

When you entry to your account you can analize it by magic number and obtain profit, dd, and all statistics by magic number.

The steps are:

1- Select personalized analysis

2- Select Magic

3- Select Magic number to analize

4- Select Analize

--- 帖子 #1269 ---
Calling TCO, regards the testing results, totals down the bottom, did you mean to divide the Profit Factor by the number of pairs?

That's what I did in this screen shot anyway; I have selected 12 pairs combination, screened by what 100_pips uses and the testing results

I will link Trade Explorer to my support thread, going to trade it with original MACD + W%R method

--- 帖子 #1270 ---
hi ymleong,

The EA is doing its job right from what i see in the code. Although u want the EA to close only your pre-assigned "MagicNumbers" trades, the EA actually closes all your open trades when the account profit is reached.

Why does it do that? It's because all the EA running in the single MT4 terminal, altough on different charts/different magic numbers, sees the entire Account Balance is in profit and thus will attempt to close its own "Magic Numbers" trade.

Hope i make some sense there.

cheers,

ck

--- 帖子 #1271 ---
TCO, as previous post, I have set up EA to trade the MACD Traditional as per original rules

I am using the MACD included in Post #1 since the last update

It shows Green on the Daily so I was watching for a trade entry as W%R dipped on the 1 Hour chart - didn't trigger

So I looked to the EA ans see that is says DownTrend

Any idea why? Does it take reading from that indicator or is it internal of the EA?

Any chance it might be wrong?

Thanks, E.

PS: It did take a trade when I first activated GBP-NZD short, MACD is red and W%R was above -20 so all correct there when triggered

--- 帖子 #1272 ---
Erebus,

Traditional MACD is not the MACD that is posted on the first page. That is Hanover MACD written per the original formula given by the creator of the indie. That indie is showing uptrend on G/U. the traditional MACD is just your basic mt4 MACD histogram with signal line. Depending how it's written inside the EA if it goes strictly by histogram below/above zero, I'm not sure. MACD traditional is currently showing downtrend. You have the EA selected to show traditional MACD but you have a different MACD on your chart thus showing you conflicting results. Hope that helps. Switch MACD's within the EA and put correct MACD on your chart, and you'll see what I mean.

--- 帖子 #1273 ---
Hi Erebus,

I peeked inside TCO's code and saw this code on MACD Traditional :
Inserted Code  if(MACD_Method == 3) // Traditional
{
Trend_Method_Comment = Trend_Method_Comment+"MACD TRADITIONAL";
double MACD7 = iCustom(NULL, Trend_TF , "macd_adjustable", MACD_Fast , MACD_Slow , MACD_Signal , 3 , True , True , 2, shift);
double MACD_W7 = iCustom(NULL, PERIOD_W1 , "macd_adjustable", MACD_Fast , MACD_Slow , MACD_Signal , 3 , True , True , 2, shift);
you'll see that the EA calls the custom indicator "macd_adjustable" to decide whether its uptrend or downtrend. In this case, its looking at the macd line to be > 0 for uptrend and <0 for downtrend.

Not sure if TCO intended this or it was a bug? Need to wait for TCO's to come online

cheers,

ck

--- 帖子 #1274 ---
Dr. Elder's strategy from his book states the use of the slope of the MACD, not the zero cross. That would be true when using the traditional MT4 MACD. Slope of histogram, not zero cross. When I have time today, I'll post where he discusses the proper MACD use.

--- 帖子 #1275 ---
Thanks for the answers guys; I was confused because the name of the MACD in Post 1 is "trad" so I assumed that was for Traditional settings

So, looks like according to the code, it used the khaled macd_adjustable for back testing, so I guess I need to put that on the chart for visual confirmations

MKFX, I know what you mean about the slope of MACD, Elder describes it very well in his mini book "Two Roads Diverged"

Also, I followed Philipp Nels 4 Hour MACD thread for a long time, now in Commercial section

OK, off to change my charts!

--- 帖子 #1276 ---
Now it has taken trade on GBP-USD ?

EA says Down Trend but both MACD are green ?

Actually same for EUR-USD, green MACD but taken a sell trade ?

Need TCO more than ever now to explain this

--- 帖子 #1277 ---
See how confusing this is? The headings for the back testing are :

MACD - adjustable and MACD Traditional

Now you tell me that if I select Traditional in the EA settings, it calls on the adjustable MACD ?

Can you please check the code to see what the"adjustable" setting looks to for trading?

Something wrong there, I just want the settings used to obtain the MACD - Traditional back testing results

And to know which MACD I should display on the chart for confirmation?

--- 帖子 #1278 ---
Quoting Tpc23

TCO: Many thanks for the generous sharing of your work. I am still testing V 1.4 with 4H trend and 15M WPR entry and getting good results. I thank you for the flexibility that you built into the program. May all your pips be green ..... T

Tpc23

Further to Robinho post , Please post your settings for your  4H trend and M15 entry strategy as in your above post, with the SL and TP

--- 帖子 #1279 ---
Sure. I display on a 15M chart.   I make the settings on the MACD and EMAs show the 4H tend on the 15M chart.  I currently like the MACD trend determination method better than the EMA determination.  However,  I leave the EMAs on the chart for visual reference.

MACD settings:  192,384,144

W%R:  no change

MA Ribbon MA1 Period:  320

MA Ribbon MA2 Period:  800

EA Settings:  TrendTF:  240    LowerTF:  15    Check once per bar:  False    Order delay: 6     max orders:  4

I use Dynamic lot sizing based upon ATR.  during this testing phase I have varied the risk percentage from 0.15% to 0.5%.  I am probably most comfortable with 0.33% unless I see that the pair is in a strong trend and then I might increase the risk level.

SL = 2 X the 240M ATR

TP = 4 X the 240M ATR

Trailing stop:  currently true.  I have varied this setting from False, to trail by 40 pips once the trade hits +50.   I have also tried trail by 70 pips once the trade hits +75.     I have also experimented with closing 1/2 the trade at +50 pips in profit and let the balance run with a trailing stop.    Although I am taking the trend from the 4H chart, I am really trading the 15M chart.  My personality leans toward intraday trades, being flat by the close of my business day.   So, I am still working through the use of the trailing stop.  I do not think I have developed the patience or brass cojones to watch draw down that I have seen in the original 100Pips thread.  So, make your own conclusion regarding the Trailing Stop.  I am not convinced that I am near a successful setting yet.

MACD Trend Settings  MACD_Fast  12   MACD_Slow  24    MACD_Signal  9

WPR confirmation TRUE

I hope that helps.  Feel free to ask questions.

--- 帖子 #1280 ---
Good day friend ... thank you for your attention ... you could provide me the entire list of its parameters? grateful

--- 帖子 #1281 ---
I got to thinking about this some and had a look myself, both MACD Adjust and MACD Traditional call on the the "adjustable" indicator

MACD Hanover call on the "MACD trad colored" indicator

Now, I don't know about the code & math in the rest of ?

Another thing, as you can see in the previous post, I have a picture of the results, but there were only 2 for MACD ?

I checked the spreadsheet and the columns for MACD - Hanover were hidden, not that there was much difference in the totals

Hope TCO can clear this up soon; isn't there anyone else using this EA on any of the MACD methods, only me?

--- 帖子 #1282 ---
I am using V1.4 with standard settings for MACD and WPR with CON, still evaluating entries, but they appear to be working. My platform has a Sunday candle which I am not sure if it has any effect on the indicators displayed as opposed to the inner workings of the EA.

--- 帖子 #1283 ---
Erebus,

Attached is the G/U chart. I have mine set to Hanover MACD. Hanover MACD is located on top and MT4 MACD is on the bottom. As you can see, MACD Hanover shows uptrend. If you switch the EA to MACD traditional, you will see it will show as still in downtrend. Reason being, the histogram is below zero. MT4 MACD and Adjustable MACD is similar in that it uses the same formula but just displayed differently. The only difference is the histogram in MACD adjustable only shows the difference between the cross of the signal lines.

--- 帖子 #1284 ---
Thanks for your concern, I am using v 1.5 which has an extra MACD method included. I had no trouble with 1.4 either

I am just confused about which MACD gives the signals for each backtest, and which settings to use to obtain the same trading set ups.

TCO Trader v1.5
- Added MA Method and Price Method to the MA Trend Method (no longer just EMA)
- Added MA Method and Price Method to Stochastic Signal Method
- Added 2 more MACD methods - Hanover (corrected adjustable) and Traditional
- Added off/on for alerts
- Lower TF Method selection changed from boolean to integer - to make optimization easier

--- 帖子 #1285 ---
No, sorry totally lost, I thought the use of magic number is to "enforced" ea to closed its OWN trades when condition tested true. In this case it shld have added acct balance based on magic numbers, otherwise I just dont see how how I can make use of it + acct profit% to basket close per trend method eg (that is, if I had magic no=10 for pairs that trade macd, 11 for ema, 12 for turtle etc), I cant control how its going to close those magic numbers.

Its either I used ES ea to mgt the different magic numbers (ie ONE ES ea per magic number) or I use different demo accts for different groups of trend methods.  Either way, its hair tearing. Its somewhat defeats the purpose of having magic number with acct profit %. I can appreciate that its original purpose is to do a global ENTIRE acct closed regardless of magic number, then why the parm for magic number. Magic number is for........ analysis via myfxbook?!

--- 帖子 #1286 ---
Yes, I have been doing this also, now have 3 MACD on my charts

But as darkgsg pointed out, the code calls on the "adjustable" indicator and not the standard MT4 indicator

Hopefully TCO can shed some light for me soon

Do you know of any MACD the same as MT4 but with 2 or 4 colored bars?

Thanks for your help

--- 帖子 #1287 ---
Yes. Pictured here and attached below.

Thanks, mate, I found this one also. Check this CAD-JPY, would have been spiked in yesterday, up 80+ pips today

--- 帖子 #1289 ---
Hi Guys,  I see there is some confusion in regards to MACD.   We only need the 2 indicators that we have to select the 3 different types of MACD.

MACD_adjustable - uses the 1 and 2 buffers for it's value, which is really 0 and 1 so if you see when I call the MACD_adjustable indicator for the 3SS MACD,

double MACD1 = iCustom(NULL, Trend_TF , "macd_adjustable", MACD_Fast , MACD_Slow , MACD_Signal , 3 , True , True , 0, shift);

double MACD2 = iCustom(NULL, Trend_TF , "macd_adjustable", MACD_Fast , MACD_Slow , MACD_Signal , 3 , True , True , 1, shift);

MACD hanover, which is close to adjustable but supposedly is less buggy.  I make this call.  We use the 3 and 4 buffer to determine uptrend and we use the 5 and 6 buffers to determine downtrend, which is really 2 & 3 and 4 & 5 respectively.

double MACD3 = iCustom(NULL, Trend_TF , "MACD trad colored", MACD_Fast , MACD_Slow , MACD_Signal , 1 , 2, shift);

double MACD4 = iCustom(NULL, Trend_TF , "MACD trad colored", MACD_Fast , MACD_Slow , MACD_Signal , 1 , 3, shift);

double MACD5 = iCustom(NULL, Trend_TF , "MACD trad colored", MACD_Fast , MACD_Slow , MACD_Signal , 1 , 4, shift);

double MACD6 = iCustom(NULL, Trend_TF , "MACD trad colored", MACD_Fast , MACD_Slow , MACD_Signal , 1 , 5, shift);

MACD_traditional can also use the MACD_adjustable indicator to get the the value, we just need to use buffer 3, which is really 2 and the call for that is formatted below. We could have used your normal MT4 macd indicator also.  Maudur pointed out to me that the 3rd buffer from macd_adjustable would return the same value.   So I decide to use that.

double MACD7 = iCustom(NULL, Trend_TF , "macd_adjustable", MACD_Fast , MACD_Slow , MACD_Signal , 3 , True , True , 2, shift);

Just goes to show. The more options and changes we add, we add complication and confusion also.   Just need to take a breath and we will all figure it out.

I hope this helps.  Sorry for the confusion.   Please let me know if you have any questions.    Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1290 ---
Thanks, that's a great big help and sure clears that up, but just want confirmation that to replicate the settings for the back testing results of MACD Traditional -

Trend method = 3 MACD and then MACD Methods = 3. Traditional

I am trying to duplicate as near as possible the trades that would be taken with original 100_pips method

My main confusion was that the MACD I had on the chart was not showing the same as the trade the EA took, as per the posted picture.

All good now, using a different MACD

Thanks, great support !!!

Hi TCO

could u help me out with how I can go abt changing the code to allow acct percent profit basket close with magic numbers? That is, ea is supposed to accumulate profits according to magic numbers and close trades which conforms to the rules set and only those trades with the specific magic numbers. This way I can basket close trades using macd, ema, or turtle etc (I create groups for these methods so its easily to compared than having 3 or 4 demo accts)

--- 帖子 #1292 ---
Hi TCO,

You may try to insert this code for determing Account Profit based on Magic Number. (code is sourced from Forex-TSD)

Inserted Code //Code Functions by wolfe by Forex-TSD
double OPBM(int intMagic)//OrderProfitByMagic
{
double dblProfit=0;
int intPOS=0;
bool boolTerm=false;
while(boolTerm==false)
{
if(OrderSelect(intPOS,SELECT_BY_POS))
{
if(OrderMagicNumber()==intMagic) dblProfit=dblProfit+OrderProfit();
intPOS++;
}
else
boolTerm=true;
}
return(dblProfit);
}

And in the main routine, we can change the Global Profit Close logic to this:-

Inserted Code // Global Profit Close
//  if((CloseAfterPctProfit==true) && (AccountProfit()>=(AccountBalance()*(ProfitPct/100)))) - by TCO
if((CloseAfterPctProfit==true) && (OPBM(MagicNumber)>=(AccountBalance()*(ProfitPct/100)))) - modfied to Get Profits by Magic Numbers instead of whole account
{
CloseAllTrades(MagicNumber);
Alert("Account Profit Reached. Attempting To Close All Open Orders");
Print("Account Profit Reached. Attempting To Close All Open Orders");
}
Have not tested yet whether it'll will close trades based on Magic Numbers Account Profit, but the OPBM() function is tracking the magic number trades correctly though in debug.

cheers

Hey TCO and you code reading guys, I'm sure this was brought up before, but is it possible to read the histogram bars and have an EA trade from that?

Seems to me that is where the markets turn and not when they cross the Zero line, that is when all the draw down happens, trades entered near the turns

I think I will start using this to determine the Daily trend for which way to look for manual trades next week

Have a good weekend all

--- 帖子 #1294 ---
Hi Erebus,

I'm on demo since 1st of Jul on taking the slope of the MACD line (3 bars going higher or 3 bars going lower) rather than zero cross for trend determination. Still early to tell if its better in the long run

Have a nice weekend too!

ck

--- 帖子 #1295 ---
Hi darkgdg, thanks for the code.  We can give that a try to see if how it works.  I really don't worry about it for my personal trading, because I only use on EA on one account so I really don't worry about the magic number issue.  I just think it is safer that way also.  If I want to use multiple EAs, or the same EA with different strategy approaches, I would open multiple accounts.   Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1296 ---
Hi Erebus, what MACD are you using in your examples.  Those look like very good trade examples.   Are those indicative of how the MACD works most of the time or are those cherry picked?   Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1297 ---
It is the one a few posts back # 1291, AllColored MACD

Only cherry picked as far as they looked good, and are the most recent data, sometimes get alternating color but as seen, sometimes gets the turn pretty good.

Be great if the EA could compare say, current histogram bar with 2 previous bars before trigger a trade?

As you see this chart of AUD_USD, there is a lot of chop, no real turning point yet, may even be consolidation before continuation.

I guess it is horses for courses, the really long term probably want to hang in there if entered way up high, swing traders may wish to avoid trading.

--- 帖子 #1298 ---
Darkgdg, TCO: I was wondering where to insert that new calculation codes, the section abt the replacing the test for (global close) acct profit was ok, as darkdgd had already pasted it onto the reply neatly. New sections is also needed to accumulate loss by magic numbers since the original TCO trader had both acct profit/acct loss%

You guys are the greatest, thank you thank you.

PS: are we maybe getting another EA that trades historgram?

PPS: TCO did this mean version 1.51 with magic number & profit/loss accumulation?

PPS: Yes it would seem to be better using ES ea to control per group of trades using same trend methods (ES ea also allow me to specify over acct profit pips or loss by pips in addition to %). But that meant maybe having upto 3 demos. Doable on a VPS, currently running 4 mt4, 1) 3ss, 2) 20-50ema, 3) TCO trader (mix trend methods), 4) Live (trading off a signal provider, Gold with 20-50ema)

Personally, I prefer profit/loss by pips, coz 300pips using 0.01lot and 300pips using 0.10lot or 300pips using 1 std lot ALL translate to different percent of acct balance. Whilst if I set eg 3% that meant each acct had to gain different pips, and acct using smallest lot size will have to "work harder". Eg if acct was $1k, 3%=$30. But in order to gain $30 on 0.01lot (assuming its only ONE trade) it will have to gain at least 300pips, when using 0.10lot its 30pips, and when using 1std lot, its only 3pips.  (If u intend to gain 3 pips, must as well trade manually, its highly possible using just ema cross to do so) And from our demo I somewhat had the confidence that I was doing much better

VPS is fine now, previously when I had 5 mt4 it was uphill struggle.

--- 帖子 #1299 ---
I'm afraid I don't see much of an edge in trading the histogram of this indicator. No reason to ever be long during that trend.

TF

--- 帖子 #1300 ---
And no one is making that claim, however the previous chart show an obvious directional bias where there would be an edge for long or short when the histogram turns.

In the AUD-USD as I said, it is very choppy, the EA probably would not trade or take opposite trades with smaller loss than original method

Who knows unless it is tried?

--- 帖子 #1301 ---
hi ymleong,

You can paste the code at the end of the EA here:-

Inserted Code }

void Del_Objects()
{
string P1$;
int jj;
for (jj=0;jj<=22;jj++)
{
P1$ = "InfoBar"+jj;
ObjectDelete(P1$);
}
}

//Code Functions by wolfe by Forex-TSD <== Paste new code here

double OPBM(int intMagic)//OrderProfitByMagic
{
double dblProfit=0;
int intPOS=0;
bool boolTerm=false;
while(boolTerm==false)
{
if(OrderSelect(intPOS,SELECT_BY_POS))
{
if(OrderMagicNumber()==intMagic) dblProfit=dblProfit+OrderProfit();
intPOS++;
}
else
boolTerm=true;
}
return(dblProfit);
}

Hope its clear!

cheers

--- 帖子 #1302 ---
Hmmm.... you think that AUD/USD chart is choppy? That's actually quite a beautiful downtrend with normal pull-backs to allow one to get on the train. Again, no reason to be long there, IMO.

*** Update Update Update Update ***

TCO Trader v1.6

- Take Profit/Loss on Percentage based on Magic Number - Thanks to darkgsg(ck) for the coding

- Made the Lower TF Signal selection integer instead of bool,   1 = WPR and 2 = Stochastic

Just a quick update team.  Thanks to darksgs, should be able to close trades on profit/loss percentage based on magic number.  Also I changed the selection of lower TF method to integer to make it easier to optimize your lower TF trigger methods.   I have started a new trade explorer - TCO Trader Mixed Bag, which has all the methods optimized for each pair.  I don't have any open trades yet, so it is not visible, but it should soon.  Thanks

So take note the parameters have changed, so if you use the new release make sure you check your settings.  Thanks!

I have Macd Selected but the comment is MA.  Shouldn't the comment be MacD?

--- 帖子 #1309 ---
When did you select it?   Are you using barmode or tick mode?

--- 帖子 #1310 ---
oops when I rechecked I did have the wrong one selected....

--- 帖子 #1311 ---
Hi TCO, members

I am also putting xauusd to the test. What I used was EACH of the most profitable method under the column "ALL Pairs" (its abt same result for selected pairs). Turtle is doing VERY well with gold and went ahead with 50+pips whilst ichi is struggling. MA and MACD has not trades yet. EACH chart has 1 max trade for gold, and 12 hrs delay.

GBPNZD was fants with MACD traditional, turtle is actually good for eurjpy (slightly more conservative compared to 3ss) and ichi is holding well for usdjpy

I will report back on Gold trading since TCO did not include this on back testing and looks like his explorer will not include it either. Spreads is set to 60pips for my demo. All others defaulted in terms of TP/SL settings. May the pips be with you

--- 帖子 #1312 ---
I have "Close on opposite signal" selected form my MacD strategy.  I was wondering how that works. Does it close when the adjustable MacD crosses the center line, or does it wait until it is in a position to open a trade in the opposite direction?

--- 帖子 #1313 ---
It will close on the opposite signal.  So if you currently have buy trades open, it will not close the trades until a sell signal is received. It doesn't matter if the trend direction has changed, it will still need the opposite trade signal to be sent.

--- 帖子 #1314 ---
Does anyone have a mft version of the adjustable macd?  I would like to have everything on the 1 hr TF including the daily adjustable macd.

--- 帖子 #1315 ---
See the chart posted in that post # 674

http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...64#post6775264

--- 帖子 #1316 ---
Not sure if you have been following any of the MACD conversations, here & on TSS thread, but apparently the code in the "adjustable" MACD is not very clean or neat or tidy or logical - choose whichever describe suits your understand of programming best!

So, I doubt very much that would exist, and no coder will be willing to touch it either.

Probably the best you can do is find a MTF MACD, apply both to a chart to see how they compare; if fairly close, use that one.

--- 帖子 #1317 ---
Just to add to that - It will close an open trade on the opposite signal AND then open a new trade in the new direction

So, the signal is whatever trend method selected on the Daily chart being the right direction (which has now changed) AND a valid signal from either the Stochastic OR W%R on the 1 hour chart

All clear?

--- 帖子 #1318 ---
Hi TCO, for your mix bag trading demo,

Q1) do u set acct profit closed or just let trade run till opposite signal closed condition?

Q2) When testing using Turtle do you set Turtle entry confirm?

Q3) What abt ema cross confirm when testing using MA?

--- 帖子 #1319 ---
Hi YM,

CloseAfterPctProfit = true  @ 3.0 %

Turtle_StrictEntry = false

MA_Cross = false

--- 帖子 #1320 ---
Just an update on my experience with V1.4 MACD/WPR

All entries are correctly being triggered according to the strategy, so bug free so far.

I have reduced the pairs to the 6 majors EU:GU:UY:AU:NU  which will allow me to trade a relatively small live a/c in due course.

Giving this a good few months to prove itself, making small changes to risk% and max no. of trades as I go. At the moment have 300% margin level but think this could easily go to 50% to allow full advantage to be taken of a big trend when it hits one (home run!) My sl is 1 x atr and tp 2 x atr, so far haven't hit many tp!

I also close all trades on Friday at about Midday NY. Start fresh each week.

--- 帖子 #1321 ---
Hi Foxmaster,

Please be careful.  Some brokers will start closing your biggest loser when the margin hits 100%.  That is why I select 300 % for my personal account.

Another possibility for us single hitters, would be to close all profitable trades at End of Day. I'm toying around this.  I created a test version of TCO Trader that has the code close all profitable trades when a new daily bar is received.   I'm going to setup a demo account and test this going forward.  Just to see how it works.  I will keep you posted.

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1322 ---
Hi TCO,

I am new to your EA and this forum, it is greatly appreciated to tell me if you have an idea of a message error I am getting on my platform Meta Trader Version 4.00 Build 509 on the Window alert

"hh:mm:ss Sell Trailing Stop- Error 1: no error"

The parameter Use_TrailingStop is false

In any case, if it does not hurt, no problem but a message without explanation is always a matter of concern. Thanks for the attention.

Also, let me tell you that the EA works very fine, I've used other MA based EA's but the entry & exit point were always sort of trouble because in most of the cases erased off the profits either due to the lag or TP was very high. The idea of closing after reach profit is very smart and I am having a quite good return on a demo account which is achieving 3% on average of 3/4 days using the same pairs you show on the  forum results. That is really a great return regardless how many trades are profitable.

Closing all profitable trades daily can unbalance the basket because the trades left are most likely against the trend  of the market due to a reverse or the market is in sideways however letting the trader to decide by adding the option of closing profitable trades will be a plus.

Thanks

--- 帖子 #1323 ---
Hi fxcolca, not really sure why you are getting that error.  Are you using Ichimoku and do you have KijunSenSL = true?

--- 帖子 #1324 ---
Silly me!

I did not mean 50%, rather 150%, do you think that would work?

Thanks for the reply, interesting strategy closing each day.

--- 帖子 #1325 ---
Hi FoxMaster, I'm afraid to tell you it will work and then have you blow your account.  It all depends on your own risk tolerance.     Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1326 ---
Thanks very much for answering my request. No, I am not using Ichimoku. I use MA's which is the closest to Trend Lines. I suspect it can be a remaining of other scripts or EA's on this demo micro account that I use as a lab but I will keep an eye on it and  as I said it does interfere with the functionality at all.

Cheers,

--- 帖子 #1327 ---
It occurs to me that I do not understand how this parameter on the margin works.

On my trading account when I have open trades it gives a % number lets say it is 323%, which when I look at my margin used and free margin numbers I have used about a third of my margin available.

I have been relating your % to this and saying to myself I would like to use at least two thirds of my available margin before I stop adding trades, so what is your 300% on the parameters represent, presumably not the same number as showing on my account.

Sorry if this is already answered or explained previously.

--- 帖子 #1328 ---
Thanks for this EA TCO. I'm still testing it and trying out a few settings. Is there a way i can set this to just open only one trade a day for each pair. I'm using a very tight SL & TP so once that is hit then i don't want to trade this pair again until the next day. Is that possible?

I have set the Max Orders to 1 and Order Delay to 12, but the EA will open a new position once the previous order is closed.

Cheers

NEWEST update from myfxbook- Include MAGIC numbers to open trades and history tabs as columns

After much persuasion, myfxbook has graciously added magic numbers to be included as column which I can choose to display on BOTH open trades and closed (history) trade tabs.

Pls refer:   http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...72#post6826672, http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...42#post6828642

Here both myself and Maudur had posted on how to use magic numbers via custom analysis to analysed your CLOSED trades.

But if you had like 20 pairs trading tco trader ea, mixed bag trading TF, indicators, methods etc which you have previously assigned different magic numbers (like me), then how do you tally your OPEN trades against those methods? TCO trader ea will output comments such as "MACD Adjustable" etc which is the MAIN TF, but you may have selected to use Stoch, lwma close. On another chart of SAME cur pair, you have selected MACD Adjustable, wpr w/o con. And you actually end up having abt 30 charts trading abt 10 cur pairs, with 3 methods. NOW, that is an issue

Now, instead of WAITING for closed trades, you can include MAGIC numbers as a column to your open trades, pls view pic

In the history tab, similarly, you can choose Magic number as a column for your closed trades

How to do that?

1) Assign magic number to your chart. You may choose logical groupings, such as, all aud=1x, eg, 10, 11, 12 etc or all trading macd=1xx, eg, 101-199

2) Download and attach myfxbook ea to EURUSD, 1hr chart

3) Once your acct is uploaded into your profile, click on the more button (refer to open trades with Magic number), and it will present a dropdown list. Tick "Magic". Similarly for closed trades, click on History tab, then click More to open the drop down list, and tick "magic"

Have fun

==============================================================================================================

My college lecturer from Cambridge U (on an exchange programme with SG) who has a double degree honours in Comp Sc and Maths used to said & I quote:

"What technology can do is ONLY LIMITED to your imagination and what technology cant do is also ONLY LIMITED to your imagination. For man has made everything that we now know of much from imagination. The rest is God's work

===============================================================================================================

PS: Hmmmph....looking at my open trades, I would say TCO trader has become more stable (now with the "ability" to allow ALL of us to benefit from back testing by TCO) to have more understanding of whats work best and the results.......BLEW my mind, within 5 trading days, I was already 1000+pips ahead!

Although gold never seems to work with 3ss, its worked well with MACD WPR W/O con both trades having at least 3% (ie, $3000 on a 100K acct trading 1% of acct equity). The new addition of stoch, ma methods, + confirmation have further allow EA to get in a trade when trend is confirmed and suffer relatively lower floating DD.

--- 帖子 #1330 ---
Sorry ftse, it is not designed that way.  I'm not going to code an option to only trade once per day.  Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1331 ---
Hi Ftse,

3 choices:

1) Set delay to 24 & Max trade=1. But it may actually be >24hrs, why? Coz based on exit conditions, the previous trade may keep going for at least 4-5 days. My gbpnzd had been there since 22/Jul and its now currently 300+pips on 29/Jul. If you would like to have a 2nd trade next day (despite whether the previous trade was closed), u will have to either reset the EA or open another chart of same cur and set same settings

2) Use Equity Sentry ea (which I contributed the link in the forum here), the ES ea will automatically switch off (disable) EA (ALL ea including itself) after it closed trades based on loss/profit conditions set in the EA itself. Then u will have to manually ENABLE ea on MT4 so that TCO trader can trade again. This meant it may be more than 1 day, coz u had to wait out till previous trade had closed out.

3) Either write or search for a script that closed open trades based on TIME.

--- 帖子 #1332 ---
TCO

Your mixed bag trading has got some stats now, u are getting profitable for audcad and I am getting hammered, whilst u are getting somewhat hammered on gbpnzd whilst I am having 300+pips results. Abt same fants results for audnzd, although not as many pips. Heres what I used for these cur pairs

audcad=>MA - LWMA, WPR w/o Con,  & MA - LWMA, Stoch LWMA close w/o con

-ve 98.10pips

gbpnzd => Macd traditional, WPR w/o con, & MACD traditional, Stoch LWMA close w con

+ve 973.50pips

audnzd => macd hanover, wpr w/o con, & macd hanover, stoch ema close w/o con.

+ve 553.50pips

** could be u used 4 max trades and I used 2 max trades per method

audjpy => macd traditional, wpr w/o con, & macd tradtional, stoch lwma close w con

+ve 476.50pips

nzdusd => macd hanover, wpr w/o con, & macd traditional, wpr w/o con

+ve 452

Perhaps you can kindly swap notes with me? or let us have a simple list similiar to what I have done above to compare notes and observation?

** I only set 2 max trades per chart, and each cur has 2 charts, with the 2 most profitable backtesting results. Total of 4 max trades for ONE cur

XAUUSD => macd traditional, wpr w/o con

+ve 276.80

PS: Not sure why in forward testing your demo trading ichi was not doing so well, whilst back test showed this as most profitable method to trade. I know u included tons of indicators and methods now, but there must be something different?

Hi TCO!

First I want to thank you for the great EA that you created.

Surely it is the most complete that I have been able to test. I've been doing some tests and optimizations and would like to ask you if possible, add in the next version the option of not opening positions during the news, based on an indicator and minutes before close all open positions, plus a field to set how many minutes after the news it will return to work.

Thank you for your attention,

Thiago.

Firstly a very big thank you, TCO, for freely sharing your EA & its support. May you be blessed abundantly for your tremendous generosity.

Have you thought about including a REVERSAL system into your Ideas.

You have a great trading system, don't give up just because the other

folk's ideas did not help you out. Keep looking for your own Trading

systems and apply them to this trading system you developed. Or use

this whole thing to make a trading alert for a less populated trader system.

Don't give up. But have a little fun experimenting.

@TallCoolOne

Hi Eric,

Hope you're well.

I got what I was after, so I haven't been following this thread for the past couple months.

Just noticed that your EA has now turned into a massive coding monster.

Let's hope that people are appreciative of your Herculean effort.

@Everyone else,

1) Keep it simple...The strategy is very basic...look at DAILY chart to determine long or short, and then use HOURLY chart to do the actual entries.

Everyday, when the daily candle on your chart ends, just spend a few minutes study the charts that contain WHATEVER indicator(s) and WHATEVER method(s) of your choice to determine if it's time to go long or short.  If the daily charts give a signal based on WHATEVER indicator(s) and WHATEVER method(s) of your choice, then turn on the EA to enter long or short.  If you cannot spend a few minutes a day to do this (for whatever reasons, and I totally understand because not all of us have the time), then you're NOT at stage in life where you can trade.

2) NO NEED to have the indicator(s) or condition(s) or combo(s) coded into the EA.  Of the people that requested this/that indicators/conditions added to the EA, how many are still using them now?  Or will still be using them a month from now, or a year from now?  I'd bet that there would be NONE.  Chances are, what you called your Holy Grail today and can't wait to have it coded into this EA, won't be your Holy Grail a few weeks from now.  And the combinations of indicators/conditions are infinite.  Eric could spend his whole life coding, and it won't be enough to satisfy people's needs and their changes in taste.

3) Interventions are needed...knowing when to turn on the EA and when to turn off the EA is the key to financial success.  You simply just CANNOT blindly apply this or any other EA to the market and expect to make money...if it was this easy, then why Elder is still writing books and charging people for his classes?  If it was this easy, then why UBS (or any other financial institutions) hires so many traders (not to "make" the market, but to strictly trade UBS accounts) and pays so much for the super stars?  Think people!!!

--- 帖子 #1346 ---
Hi Yasirfx, you can set the lower time frame to 5 or 15 instead of the default 60.   You might be able to use H4 for trend time frame = 240 instead of default 1440.   The template will need to be changed accordingly.  You can set the TP and SL to what you want.  Just make sure the ATR TP and SL is set to false and set the standard TP and SL to your desired level.   I hope this helps!  Thanks!

thanks

Hi TCO,

You might say it is crazy but pls. tell us how we can make trades reverse as it seams work better in the most of times. i tried to change all sell orders to Buy and vice versa in the EA but i am worry might it make everything mess. Just for testing, would you pls. advise how we can reverse the orders ?

--- 帖子 #1351 ---
Hi Mohsen,

Do you meant that when the EA signals a Buy, you want it to open a "Sell" trade and if the EA signals a Sell, you want to open a "Buy" trade?

regards

ck

--- 帖子 #1352 ---
Good morning everyone ... I've tested and the results are very positive ... I can leave some reports of friends ... some days operação.Testem DEMO account and then draw their own conclusions.I am not able to put the reports, because of the ability

--- 帖子 #1353 ---
Hi Mohsen, you should be able to TCO_Trader.mq4 file and find where the BuySignal is set to true and change it to SellSignal being set to true and vice versa.  I don't guarantee this will work, but that would be a place to start.   Then recompile the program.    Thanks!

--- 帖子 #1354 ---
Hi Robinho, thanks for posting your settings.  I will give it a try.

--- 帖子 #1355 ---
Hi Robinho,

I Didn't get it completely. Should we change MACD setting in EA to this setting or it should be set as you shown in EA setting.

Then in where these MACD and MA ribbon setting would be applied?

tks

Mohsen

Hi TCO!

Congrats to the EA, its really nice. Thanks for sharing it. I have started to do the backtesting on several pairs, but could not yet achieve your results shown in "backtesting.xls". Could you please share the settings: parameters, timeframe, dates (from - to) used in your backtest?

Apologize if you have already shared it, and I just cannot find it.

Thanks,

Zoltan

--- 帖子 #1357 ---
ok thanks, please can you share the results that your friends have had using these settings. many thanks

--- 帖子 #1358 ---
I remember someone posting a list of EA's that close trades when Equity percent is reached and I can not find them now. Does anyone have a good one?  Even better if it has the option just to disable EA's if Margin % is say 200.

--- 帖子 #1359 ---
That was me Post #9

http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...18#post6732218

And for your future reference, click on the "Paperclip" icon up the top right, number is 247 right now, and you will locate all attachments within a thread

You can sort them by type, name, etc, pretty basic stuff really

Good luck, E.

Hi Eric,

I may found a bug: trailing stop, jump stop and breakeven stop work only in case of buy (long) positions (downtrend). The EA applies to short positions correctly (according to rules set in parameters), but does't apply the listed SL methods. Primary SL method and pure SAR work correctly. I tested on several pairs (also checked in visual mode, 99.9% backtest accuracy) and got the same results.

Do u know what can be the problem?

Thank you,

Zoltan

--- 帖子 #1361 ---
Good afternoon ... you have to change the settings not s'po the Expert, conforms the list I put, as well as MACD and MA ribbon ...is not supporting the report file, so I have not put the results

--- 帖子 #1362 ---
robinho have your results been well with the settings since we last spoke?

--- 帖子 #1363 ---
Can somebody who use this EA please give a update how it goes?

--- 帖子 #1364 ---
Hello,

I followed the instructions on how to put the TCO trader EA in MT4, but if I attach the EA to a chart. It is not doing anything? Can somebody help me? I work with MT4 Build 625.

--- 帖子 #1365 ---
Hello friend, you still use the EA TCO? I wonder if it is still active? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #1366 ---
We can't attach this ea too to mt4  build 646. It seems that it doesn't work anymore with new builds...

--- 帖子 #1367 ---
Hello, I wonder if it uses the TCO? Does anyone here still use the forum?

--- 帖子 #1368 ---
