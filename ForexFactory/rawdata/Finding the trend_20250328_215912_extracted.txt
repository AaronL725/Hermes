The GRAIL is not the best trading system, strategy or robot. The grail is the crystal ball . If you know at beginning of the day which instruments will be trending the most, then any strategy WILL make you money. Edit : Traders appearrently have many ways to predict, that something will happen soon. This week, next wek, this year. That's fine. But that does not pay your monthly salary. You need to have an edge TOMORROW. There you have the grail. I have this overview: On each chart I put on the Williams Percentage Range indicator (WPR). It is in the MT4 Oscillator folder. I set the parameter to 150. This is not suitable for trading signals, but I want the overall picture. The indicator goes to a sub window. I make that subwindow size to fill the whole chart. Then I have the template. Put the instruments you follow on the screen, add the template to each chart. When price keep over -30 the trend is upwards - but might be in a range - keep that in mind. Below -70 visa versa. The best is when the price is going steeply OBOS or OSOB. There the really trend is lying. When doing the daily top down, I set all charts to the Daily. This quickly gives me the view of instruments of interest. I note these instruments and then set all charts to H4 and then H1. The list of interesting instruments is now narrowed. Then I can open the charts of the instruments on my list and decide which will be the best for the day. I give the chosen ones a green background colour. This way they are easy to follow during the day. Now you just have to trade the chosen instruments with the trend. Easy! I use WPR but you can use anything you like, just keep it simple. I attach the scripts which I found here on FF. They make it easy to change template and timeframe on all pairs. But what is your take on this? How do YOU select the pairs to trade. Please - I foresee hundreds or even thousands traders will visit this thread. Don't be shy. Give us your strategy for finding the best instrument to scalp for the day. Let us help each other. If anybody do not speak in an orderly maner, my boot is ready. Update 11th August - 5 weeks later Around 850 downloads! Hey people have been here. 433 posts in the thread as today. Most of those are about something else - at least not my methode. As I recall then 2 people showed a short interest. So no help from anybody to refine the methode. What a shame. This really is the grail. During these 5 weeks I have refined the methode myself. I am now able to select the pairs for the trading of the day - sharp as a razorblade. The pairs are allways going in my direction. And I can use whatever strategy I like, I will earn money. However it seems to be wasted time to show my methode for anybody else, so I keep this gold for myself. Update 10 February. Things developes all the time and this post #1 has not been updated. Go to post# 578 for the latest grail robot.

How are you doing this??

--- 帖子 #3 ---
And at any time the charts will do as they like. Today everything is going in the other trend direction and I am getting no trades until now.

H4 needs big stops

--- 帖子 #6 ---
The idea is NOT to trade H4. You use H4 to find the direction of the trend and then you can trade what ever LTF you like.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
As a scalper the very BIG question is "what can I trade? Is there a pair that will trend today?". Well look at the WPR overview table using the Daily TF. Find the instruments which are very steep right now. There you have it. At the table today I would think that scalping is fine at: AUDCHF, AUDNZD, EURUSD GBPUSD. Of cause go to the chart of the pairs and make your top down analysis to be sure.

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Sounds like a good idea. thanks for sharing.

His RiskFighter I believe you are looking at this concept in totally the wrong way. You should not be looking for markets that have already started to trend, you should be looking for markets that are DEAD. A market cannot stay idle for long because money when money is trapped, those traders will eventually panic and create a trend that destroys their own trading accounts. Just find markets that are dead and wait, let them compress into a tight band then follow the volume when it explodes through this compression. An Example - Bitcoin June 2nd - Dead in the water. When it moved it dropped $11,000 in price. June 28th - Dead in the water. When it moved (and still is) it dropped another $7000 in price. Want more? US500 Index June 11th - Dead in the water. When it moved it ran 230 ticks in three days June 24th to July 2nd - Dead in the water, its now thinking about moving and I am long with a Stop. That's still scalping. just not always interday. I suggest to you that looking for daily scalping setups without looking at the big picture is misguided. Hint, here is what I am trading today - Want a interday setup? As I speak EURUSD - its Dead but just now moving Bearish SELL. SELL. SELL. - but with a stop Cheers

Hi Darwati Thank you for this input. I never disliked your pictures. Personly I do think they are too much, but I never said so to you. At least I could not trade the way you do. But your theory and pictures are most welcome into this thread. And as you are still using the strategy that is proof that it works. Respect for that. I don't agree that I should keep buying and finally hit the trend. I go directly into the trend. I will show you by charts when this day is over. And yes, you need algoritmes to find the trend. The WPR is an algoritme. I use more algoritmes to find the trades inside the trend.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Thank you Rick I allways value your oppinion. And you are totally right in your methode. It works. A couple of years ago I even made an indicator that showed the Bollinger Bands using bars. That way it is easier to spot when the bands are widening and trend is starting. Thank you for the input. This is not only for me, but everybody reading this thread. hmm - EURUSD dead? SELL? To me it seems very much trending North. I could have had some nice scalps going north today.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
My strategy is to scalp the trend. Not the start of the trend, that would be swing trading. The teory is, that a trend tends to continue, more that it tends to shift. So finding the trends at the WPR overview makes my day easy. In post #7 I said that WPR told me to trade AUDCHF, AUDNZD, EURUSD GBPUSD today - all of them Long. I only took a short glance at the WPR overview. I did not make a top down analyse. Well, I did not trade today. Lazyness and NFP day. But here are the chart at the time when I would have stopped trading. AUDCHF: Not trending. But I would have had 2 nice trades. AUDNZD: Started Long. 2 trades EURUSD: Long trend. 4 trades - 1 loser. GBPUSD: Long trend. 3 trades And as I take only Long trades today, then I lose nothing if the trend decide to go short. Of cause trend shifting into ranging could be a killer. This is my take right now. Other people have enriched us with their methodes today. Anybody else have some interesting inputs.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Hi RiskFighter Again you need to twist your thought process 100% The Bollinger Band indicator has been one of the tools I used to grow my stock account balance into a 7 figure amount since Covid ended. The trick is to find trending markets, you do not look for expanding Bollinger bands. YOU LOOK FOR SQUEEZES - THEN TRADE WHEN IT EXPLODES Cheers

--- 帖子 #14 ---
That was what I said. You say explode, I say expand. That is the same thing. This is rookie stuff.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
I like to use a mechanical approach that focuses on what the candles are doing right now, and not what they were doing "X" bars ago. This can capture the beginning of a strong trend Try using this simple system. A bullish example.. Wait for a minimum (discretion based on sensitivity) of 3 bars that have not had their lows taken out Make sure the volume is greater than the previous candle on all 3 candles (ascending nicely) Even better if you apply this to a market that's recently had a key level break or test... A variation could be using 6 candles but with no volume confluence.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Thank you Machine. I know you have an appetite of investigating how to best trade the market. This is really interesting - so obvious - of cause it must be making money. And it is a firm strategy that could be handled in a robot. You are a Trading View trader and I am MT4. So have you tried making the TV robot to test it?

--- 帖子 #17 ---
You know I'm not much of a robot guy.. most of the testing I do is through forward testing on live markets. Robots can't replicate my 10+ years of trading experience and my ability to discern good and bad trades, so I don't usually go out of my way to create them. HOWEVER, I do think they provide excellent insight into the potential profitability in the barebones of a method. Try and code one up for the simple system I mentioned and see if it provides you any value.

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Jep - I will. I have a robot allready trading after 3 bars in a row breaking out of a trend. I can fit that into your nice strategy! I agree that a man like you will be better than a robot. I do not have that skill (have also more than 10 years of experiance and knowledge) - weak stummock I guess, so I need the robot. And robots does work, not if you have them running 24/7 - but if you can find the trend and let them run there, then most robots can be profitable. That is why I make this effort to find the trend.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
This trend will not be a signal service, but let me show my thoughts about monday instruments. Monday is monday. You never know what will happen. Many traders never trade on mondays. And the coming monday will be the first day after NFP day, so it is extra hard to predict what will be trending and in which direction. But here is my take on it. The green pairs will have my interest. The reason is that they either 1) have been overbought for a periode and the saying is that the trend is more likely to continue than to stop - or 2) the very tip of the Daily WPR curve is going right into the sky. Some of the asian pairs I will start trading early if I can be awake, but most pairs have until 8 am ECT to confirm my prediction. I might end up trading only a few of them. Of cause, there is never any guarantee, the market does what the market does no matter what we want it to do. And if a pair is trending over a long periode, you will find ranging days once in a while. That might be on monday.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Hi Bro, Thank you for your thought. Oscillator or sinewave are very interesting. Could you add criteria A-B-C-D-E for the Wave, take a look from the reference line (Mean)? A for Start and E for Entry Point. Might be good for H1. Reference line should be line 50 (moving average).

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Thank you. Nice picture! I have a degree in electronic engineering, so I just love sinus waves. Yes, you can call that a Mean strategy. I cannot add those points to my WPR charts, because I twisted the parameter to 150, so the oscillation does not behave the normal way. The purpose of this thread is to reveal the direction of next daily bar. If we can do that, then it is easy to make money by trading lower timeframes in that direction. As I see your picture, then whenever the price passes the mean, you have the Entry Point. Then the next bar will often keep that direction. If that is the case in x% of the cases , then this is a fine tool. Have you made a test for this? The chart you added is the H1. To test my idea you should shift to Daily. So this is a very nice and valuable input to this thread. By the way, I use the WPR tool to identify the trend. But for my trades I use mostly a 50 EMA. But I sometime do change the parameter between 20 and 80 to reveal the line that gives the best trades. Thank you Major. Nice input!

--- 帖子 #24 ---
It has been tested. There has been a thread here for a long time. One of the many facets of PVSRA. The same principle, similar. https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...me-sr-analysis https://pvsrainternationalwithtrader....com/index.php

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Thank you. I have some nice activity for the weekend then. I just looked into you thread: The Recent Only Real Deal in My Head . Are you still trading that strategy? A bit boring yes and only one trade a week does not sum up a lot. But if you are trading many pairs using a robot, then it could be some nice money.

--- 帖子 #26 ---
No. That was just a test a long time ago, when I first got to know forex. Because of certain reasons, it wasn't easy to apply. Now I only trade as a hobby occasionally (using PVSRA) when I have some free time.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Hey Rick been following you for a while now, would love a chance to chat as a introduction, James Yanamor on LinkedIn. Let me know if we can chat, i have background in investment capital &amp; small business... of course a minor background in FX -- looking to be more of a gold trader like you. I like the gold news and pattern completion. I'm moldable lets chat.

--- 帖子 #28 ---
So many traders care about lagging indicators. Well, either indicators is based on factual data - and then lagging, or they are dreaming. I prefer lagging. Look at this chart. At any point this 30EMA was lagging. But the bounces were effective and there were loads of money to take. So what is the problem?

--- 帖子 #29 ---
hi RiskFighter, thanks for sharing. i agree with you in terms of some viewpoints, for example i believe trend is likely to continue rather than reverse. and i think in 80-90% time we should stay out of the market, only enter when there's a good opportunity, no matter it's from technical analysis or fundamentals, or astrology. because i'm not good at price action so i use some indicators help me figure out what's going on. what indicators to be used is not important, as long as they can reflect longterm, midterm or instant market moves, any kind will work, like oscillators. Attached Image (click to enlarge) i consider my indicators like a discussion group, they conflict in most times but occasionally they reach a strong agreement. when that happens it's time to enter. another good thing is even they start fighting again soon there's no big loss, just quit and wait for next agreement.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Hi this chart is not a good example as it mostly trending. MAs will kill you on ranging markets with lots of false signals. That's the issue

--- 帖子 #31 ---
I agree. That is why you need to find the trending pairs. Then all strategies will work. This is exactly what this thread is about. I have also many confluences in my robot.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
What a philosofic post that is . My Granny would understand it when you explain things. Great! Interesting chart. What you say is, that when everything is BLUE, then everybody agree and you buy long - right?

--- 帖子 #33 ---
To take your strategy into this thread - we try to find pairs that will be trending next day, so that we can have some nice scalps. So in your case it could be to find the pairs that turns blue on D1. Exactly on that point the next day is expected to be trending in all timeframes and scalping can begin. Right?

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Thanks for your answer I have put your WPR indicator on a chart with 150 setting as you mentioned but can't see properly how it will determine the trend if any exist. Look at these 2 pairs (1 trending and 1 ranging) and please let me know how you determine which one is trending

--- 帖子 #35 ---
hi RiskFighter, yes, when all indicators are bullish blue, it's a good time to consider buy long. if scalp in lower timeframes, e.g. M1-M15, i expect all indicators strongly agree bullish, must beyond "strong level line" becoz too much consolidations in LTF so no need to enter in a hurry, there are always perfect setups in another pair.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
RiskFighter Interesting Thread My Style of Finding a Trend ?

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Hi Merka You are missing the point. So thank you, this will be a perfect issue to explain by an example. We use EURUSD as the example you chosed. DON'T start at H1. It is useless. On the first chart you see it on the Daily TF. The trend is very clear. Starting on the 27th. June. Passing -70 on 3rd. July. This is your call to follow and possibly trade the pair. Of cause allways be aware - it could be false break out. On the 4 hour chart it is very clear. Now watch the actual bar chart from the 26th. June. You have a wonderfull trend. I would go into that trend at the 3rd. July when -70 was passed. This is the idea of this methode. Trying to foresee the trend and ride it - scalp it on lower TF like M15 or M5 . Use the WPR on the daily - use it with all your charts in one single view and then find the pairs which is in a nice trend. It is vital that the last tip of the daily goes straight into the air or into the ground. Else take a look on pairs which are Oversold or Overbought for a long time. These pairs might be ranging but they could just as well be trending nicely. And if a pair is trending - then it tends to continue trending. ONLY take trades with the trend. That way - if trend was false and changed direction, you will not lose money except for a possible trade you were in when the change took place.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Hi Dave That is perfect. Thank you. I love it. You might use my multichart WPR setup as a shortcut to find the pairs that have your interest? Then use you methode on those pairs.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Guys - this is working. Clever traders share their setups. And we all learn from each other. WHat about YOU - do you have something to share????

--- 帖子 #40 ---
Thank you I have got them in smaller groups eg all USD crosses in 1 group all GBP crossed in another etc etc may I make a suggestion IF you are trading USD Crosses HAVE the US DOLLAR Showing and trade in TANDEM

--- 帖子 #41 ---
You are a clever guy. Got your Tandem advice. Will explore it. I have these groups also. But my brain works best with my multi WPR View. Seing all instruments in one overview and then go directly to the spots. So I don't use the groups. But I should, because they show the overall strange and direction of each currency. Yes, I will do that from now on. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
Allready now we have received utmost valuable input from clever traders. More experienced traders are welcome to join.

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Now I understood better your approach. I use a similar method just using different indicators. As @Dave mentioned above, I use indexes as well for confluence to gauge which pair to pick from the crosses against USD or JPY etc.... I've created synthetic indexes for all majors pairs (USD, JPY, CAD, CHF, GBP, NZD, AUD). But the point of this thread is finding the trend. One way is to find established trend on HTF and than trade lower TFs to scalp in the same direction as you explained. The other approach is what @RickM was suggesting: (look for consolidating pairs and wait for the explosion and scalp in that direction). The best method I know is Elliott Waves analysis where you know the trend even before it starts. Unfortunately it's very subjective and can't be coded. Thanks

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I know I should open a topic on my own about what I'm about to propose, but since the topic is about how to find the trend I'll try to explain my idea in a few words. I open the monthly chart and draw a horizontal line on the opening and closing. Then I move to the daily chart and based on the knowledge of the candlestick patterns, every day I see what happens at that level. If a candle with a strong wick is formed that bounces on one of the two levels and the candle closes above, I buy; if it closes below, I sell. If you want to put the SL put it on the opposite side of the same candle. You can add any indicator for further confirmation, but in my experience this is already enough. Try opening a monthly chart of the last or penultimate month, mark the opening and closing and then move to the daily and observe what happened the following month. You may be surprised by the clarity of the signals.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Tradingview chart start since 1971 (Nixon Shock). Monthly. Right now green candle.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Flash Your idea is very welcome - and interesting!!! What you do is that you guess the direction of the next trade and that is what this thread is about. I would then go to lower timeframes and scalp in the chosen direction. If you find the signal on daily, then I would enjoy scalping on H4 and H1. Wait a minute, can you scalp on H4. Sure and I will explain if somebody does not agree. Flash, I would like to participate if you open a new thread of your strategy.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Dear sir, I am working hard to develop a strategy that is as simple as possible, without indicators, suitable for full-time workers, without stop losses, and which makes serious money, little or a lot. My common thread is as follows: example MN is bullish, the last candle W1 is bullish, then D1 will also be bullish. Nothing new, I didn't invent anything. There is already some old similar topic on FF. This principle applies to all technical analysis tools and indicators. But in D1 you have to know how to seize the right moment to enter. And when is this right time? There are two possibilities: you can buy at the first daily candle of the next month which is already bullish, or you open a buy trade at a bearish candle. Sometimes there will be more than one bearish candle and I add another purchase operation of the same value or increased with a martingale progression if the account allows me and I close everything when, rising, I reach 50% of the entire bearish tracking . This is the basic orientation, then you can refine it. Those who have knowledge of candlestick patterns and moving average behavior (I use ema 9 and 18) can definitely improve the entry point. The strategy is not difficult, but there is risk management that must be respected. In the following example we have a purchasing manual case. MN bullish, last W1 candle bullish and the first candle of the month still bullish. The take profit should be at least the same height as the daily candle between high and low.

Hi Dave A took a look at status ordered per currency as you suggest. AUD seems to be a hit for the time being. The advice to people (Using the best tool there is - MT4) is to have a profile for each currency like I show here.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
So in last week we had US Independence Day at thursday and NFP at friday. That leaves monday with a bad statistic level. I will trade my strategy but with microlots. There are days when you should not trade. Many traders don't trade mondays. I agree, but after the long weekend I need to trade. I just be very carefull.

--- 帖子 #50 ---
My MultiWPR gave me 10 possible pairs to trade this monday. This morning it added to me the AUDCHF. So here is my setup on one of my accounts. Note the buttons with the trade direction. I can with a click decide in which direction my robot should trade. And I can prevent it to trade at all. So I can be very fast reacting. Right now market is very new and I am not trading. Sorry guys. I don't share the robot. It is very complicated to drift it and I am constantly managing the very complicated code. It has for the time being 6 strategies built in. But I can direct you into some gurus that can teach you how to programme robots. It is much easier than you think. You can make your first robot in an hour.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
And here is a tip for you, if you make those Currency Groups. A SIMPLE Step by Step Process - HIGH PROBABILITY TRADES (youtube.com) But start by using my MULTIWPR setup to identify which currencies have this nice behavier.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
See this - setting the MultiWPR to timeframe H1. USD is very week right now. Can be traded.

So in post #21 I marked the pairs green that was the best predictions according to the MultiWRP overview. There were 10 trades - all of them long. I have taken the prices from the Monday daily candle. This is the result. A total of 251 pips. Not a great day. But if you had traded the pairs in the Long direction, Bought at open of the day and exit at EOD, then this would be the profit.

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Hi Dave Thanks for all your charts. Did you trade them all? I see all the Blue and Red line ups where your system signal possible trades. Very effective . I am impressed. Your TopDown analyze did say Long. Would you have taken the short trade at the end of day?

--- 帖子 #60 ---
A lot of questions - very interesting. I will check with my robot. Your tools might be interesting for my robot or maybe a new robot.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Jep, my robot would have had a nice day. But I am not trading M5, so M15 is attached too.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
My dream is to trade from Excel only. According to the motto: enough is enough. The problem of different wavelengths could be compensated via hedge and correlation. My research result so far is = -0 or better = -50, because I don't yet know what I don't know. Interesting thread, thx RiskFighter

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Thanks, this is interesting. What do OBOS and OSOB mean?

--- 帖子 #64 ---
OB = OverBought OS = OverSold

--- 帖子 #65 ---
chart looks great! Where can I find these indicators? Would love to test it out

--- 帖子 #66 ---
In theory, when the price enters overbought, there will likely be a reversal or pullback soon, but sometimes when using indicators such as RSI, the level is already showing overbought but the price is continuing the trend, how to respond to conditions like this? Should I use additional indicators or look more at price reaction patterns?

--- 帖子 #67 ---
OB and OS are indicators originating from trading stocks. You have to be very aware of which indicator, timeframe etc. you are using them in when trading Forex. I use them as a sign to show that trend is continuing. How that? I set the look back parameter to a very high number, that is averaging out all small changes and often it will keep the value in a OB or OS mode, which means that the pair is either trending or ranging. Hmm - both possibilities. Well at least you have then filtered away the pairs that are in an undecission mode, lying between the boundaries. But when it is either ranging or trending when OB or OS, then you need to go into the chart and decide if it is trending and from there put on your own strategy. One trick is to watch the very tip of the WPR. If it is going right into the air or to the ground, then there is a trending pair. Read post #37 again.

--- 帖子 #68 ---
I often get PM's from people that have a good strategy making them money and they suggest making a robot. And I will happily make a robot if someone has a fine strategy. But it require some work, which people does not know. Therefore I will from now on write this post on all my threads. I need these things in order to program a strategy: A written strategy on paper. All indicators, settings etc. When to enter and when to exit. Everything very precise. Either some months of paper back test with results in an Excel sheet or forward test also with an Excel sheet. The testing is vital to show that the strategy is profitabel and to test that the robot and the strategy are working precisely together. Be aware, that a robot will trade each and every setup it is programmed to do. It will never skip and jump to the next setup. A robot should not be trading 24/7. A HTF analysis or something else should tell when to start the robot. This is where it gets hard to test a strategy. A robot cannot think. It is a set of algorithmes and it does excactly what it has been programmed to do. So if you have a fine written strategy, then try to follow it 100%. If you occationly chicken out because you are suspicious about some wicks or other things, then you are not following the strategy and the robot will fail. Also think about a robot running 24/7. It never gets tired. That is a good thing. But if you trade at specific times and specific days, then the robot will fail, if it is not set to do exactly that. Are you not trading when there is red news? Did you tell the robot that? To be honest, all atempts to make the robots that people suggest has failed until now, because thay were not following their strategy 100% themself. So making a robot is quit a piece of work. Also for me. And I can of cause not start my work before I see some proof that it is worth it. But if you have this proof - hell let's do it right away Also think like this: If you make the precise papertest either back or forward, then you have something that tells you, if this will be able to make you a passive income in the future by using a robot. Why not do it? The Excell log must tell: Exact time of enter and exit a trade. Pips taken - negative or positive. Any circumstances worth of noting. Any idea to improvements. This text will be my post#2 in all future threads.

In your first post you said "Easy! I use WPR but you can use anything you like, just keep it simple." Is the RSI as valid as the WPR? If so, here is a very quick and easy RSI dashboard. You can set the period for the RSI, the time frames, and choose your pairs. This example here is using the default 14 period, but you can see how the dashboard works. You can make it change colour above or below a specific value.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Splended. It is absolutely useable. I still stick with my WPR chart, because: It shows not only the value - it also shows the development. How lang has it been trending!! Or is it in a steep trend right now. I can easily change timeframe on all 28 pairs in one handling. Takes 3 seconds. And then I again have the visual picture. This way it is easy to make a top down analysis. When I chose my daily pairs for trading. I begin at the daily WPR overview. There are 28 pairs on the screen. I close the pairs that does not look right. The I have a lot of pairs left for the next test. I shift to H4 timeframe. Close down the charts that does not fit my needs. Now I typically have around 10 pairs on the screen. I open them all to make an analyse to see if they fit my needs. I close a couple and then I put robots on the rest. But you could do the same with RSI. I will show you in a minute.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
It does not work as well with RSI. It is more fluctuating. I think WPR is better.

--- 帖子 #72 ---
In the matter fact I think, that the table you provided is perfect to use together with my WPR for the total analysis. Thank you for this.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
If you put the RSI to 150 setting than they behave almost equaly

--- 帖子 #74 ---
@Dave Do you trade long on lower TF only when your daily candles are above the MAs or you have extra confluences? What about when daily is still showing uptrend but price is showing LLs (can be a pullback or the start of the new downtrend).

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Thanks we have almost similar approach

--- 帖子 #76 ---
These are the pairs that survived my first harvesting for trading today. I am in 5 trades allready, so I think I will find only 2 or 3 pairs to trade today. So there will be some further study to do. Take a look at the JPY pairs. Thay are just so nicely trending. It must come to an end some time soon. But for the time being, JPY is really good for trend trading.

Guys. Linhngoc has put this exactly post with same worth and same EA on 10 different threads this morning. You know an EA can have dangerous content to your PC. I would be carefull about downloading this EA. And he has never done anything else on FF. This is very suspecious.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
I enjoy reading your inputs. But my focus is a bit different. You could say that I am badge trading, not focusing on one pair. I use a strategy which I explained in one of my other threads. But I am getting a bit more clever each time someone are making a post for me to read. I closed 6 ongoing trades this morning. Now waiting for new signals. You are right, that there are not many traders communicating here. I am used to that. If you go out one night to have some fun, then you chose a place where way too many people are gathered to have your beers. It is the same on FF. People goes where the other people are. Quit a shame I think. On the other hand - people are here, but they are not sharing. Look at my post #1. There is 100 downlods right now. 11 traders are viewing the thread right now. Only a couple of people are sharing their thoughts. That is how it is. I will continue to share using threads for yet a while. I am not sure how long I will go on. But I cannot help focusing on trading. I use at least 10 hours every day behind the trading screen. That will continue for the rest of my life.

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Not part of the topic of this thread, but at least I make a post. I exited some trades this morning. Then what if the trend continues? Well in my robot I have a function that I can turn on. If 2 green bars comes right after each other , the my robot enter the trade. So I used that function this morning and I am into the trade again.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Sure, here is the translation: "Thank you for caring about the community. But you are mistaken. I just wanted to share my EA with everyone, because the community has helped me with many ideas to complete it. Sorry for sending it to many groups at the same time."

--- 帖子 #79 ---
I am still suspecious to this Linhngoc guy. Suddently out of nowhere he starts spreading EXE files in many threads. He never had any post before on FF. I don't like it. He is now kicked out of this thread. Hope WEE will take action. I have reported him.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Yes, the trade was obvious. Many ways to get it. And your methode is just a fine as mine. Or better. Vital for me is that the pair I am trading is as trending as possible. How do I trade. Well look into my thread SHA &amp; Tripple MA | Page 2 | Forex Factory My methode is constantly under development, but it is much like that anyway. Or try Williams Fractal indicator. Right now I am also experimenting with a simple MACross. Keep it simple if you can. You might say that it will never work. Losing the account etc. No because I use it only on very trending pairs like AUDJPY. And I only trade in the direction of the trend. And how do I find those trending pairs??? Well that is what this thread is about. Watch post #76 to see the trending pairs for today. Veeeery easy. I sometimes get out too early - I am the weakest trader in the world. The I use the 2 green / red bars to get back in. See post #83.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
My friend Dave think that there is not enough focus from people in this thread. I agree. Lots of visitors, but most of them doing the free ride. OK, I started this thread because I had something to show. That is done. If people don't feel like keeping the thread alive, then it is ok with me. It is not important to me to keep the thread alive. I have said my piece.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
Sometimes a enter for a long trade and suddently the trend will reverse. still don't have a solution for that. How do you deal with situations like that?

--- 帖子 #83 ---
There is obviously something to go for when the Median is passed. RSI??

--- 帖子 #84 ---
The issue must be to be as sure as possible that the trade will be a success. Using all kind of confluenses. Then there is only stoploss left to secure your money. But the problem is then, if you set the stoploss to tight, then it will often be hit by a wick. I therefore often set a very wide stoploss which requires a very large wick to get it. And then I exit the trade manually or by a robot if the bar close under the stoploss. This way the wicks don't get me. You and I talked Hedging in another thread, but if you are really sure of the trend, then don't use hedging. Hedging is there to catch a shift in the trend direction.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
can you please care to explain what interest you about that chart? Yes, its in an uptrend but don't think you mean that

--- 帖子 #86 ---
the candle close under SL is a nice suggestion. Thanks I never have 100% sertancy so when trend suddently changes I use a money management to resist but still working on how to make the MM a bit safer. What % of confidence about the trend you achieve whit all your confluences?

--- 帖子 #87 ---
If there is a short pullback that's not an issue. even 100 pips it's ok. For example your daily chart with the EMAs on it calling for uptrend. As EMAs are lagging, you will not notice a new downtrend start on the daily for a long time. Based on the previous uptrend signal, you entered on the LFT a buy (because you got a long signal from indicators that are lugging) In substance you got cought into a buy right when trend is changing. The only thing can save you in these situations is SL as @RiskFighter was suggesting. Would appreachiate your approach as well @OAPDave

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Yes, I noticed the Murrey level 4/8 but can't remember what are you reffering about for "dim and distance past". BTW, I don't use Murrey levels as I never managed to properly use them. Most lickely due to my ignorance on the subject

--- 帖子 #89 ---
"What % of confidence about the trend you achieve whit all your confluences?" I have no measurement for that. Working with my MultiWPR strategy is quit new, but I really feel good about it. So good that I just now incoorporated a simple MACross in my robot. I will set the robot to trade only in the trend direction which I get from the WPR analysis and then I need no more confluences. My SL will be set at EMA25low +- spread. I will manually follow the SL to BE. From there the MA will handle to exit. PS. Note that I am a grown up and have done many MACross robots in my early days. And I do know they are lagging and will empty the account if they are stand alone indies. Specially the exit is a problem because of the lagging. You lose a lot. But if you are sure that the pair is trending, then I think it can be profittable. Let's see how it goes.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
But here is the problem with my Nowick SL method. If this bar that is ongoing right now reaqlly close like a Black Swan, then there is quit a loss.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
So I was lucky to have the instruments in the right direction this time.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
Agree and marked below is where I'm still struggueling

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Yes, trading inversely correlated pairs can save you from bid DD

--- 帖子 #94 ---
A wise man said to me: "Take profit every day". Meaning - don't think about the amount of profit. Or could it have been more. Just let your stummock have a nice evening so you are ready to trade without fear tomorrow. Well, I had a fine day. This US giant bar probably will be followed by more profit. But I had my share and I closed my robots for the day. Now I will enjoy FF the rest of the day. At some point I will be able to let my robots work as set&amp;forget. Then they would have continued. But for the time being, my trading is SemiAutomatic. And I care a lot for my stummock.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Absolutely! Watch this in TF M5. Jesus that is scary. But you could have gotten out earlier after the first red bar.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Oh, you are showing the M1 here. Yes that is scary and you could have avoided a loss by doing this. But things are happening so fast that you had missed the opportunity with a blink of your eyes.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
Look at this: EURJPY is the same shit. Means you cannot trust any of your strategies right now. Yesterday it was NZD now it is more pairs. I think USD was the problem. My trading is hereby suspended for the rest of this week.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
Yes and wise people close positions before News. I don't.

--- 帖子 #104 ---
I have no knowlegde of News and the impact from news. But looking into the FF calender and seing the numbers for the red news today, I cannot understand that those numbers should be so dangerous at to this market reaktion. So I think it is the robots at the big investing companies that have gone beserk.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Time will tell. I am not trading more this week. Clarification is needed.

--- 帖子 #106 ---
I do not use levels. But from monday at London open I will trust the tip of the WPR on H4. Is it going up or down.

--- 帖子 #107 ---
I do know, that there are lots of people making money where levels are one of the confluences. I just look at what the price is doing. As late mr. Dow pointed out: "All information in the world is in the current price".

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Hi RiskFighter. Please, post your analisys for the nex Trading week. Starting d1 analisys. Ok? thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #109 ---
My analysis is allways for the day. I never look further out. And normally i do it around 7:00 ECT. And specially on mondays I don't rely on the Asian data. I can post it monday as an example. Otherwise it is so simple, that anybody can do it.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Regarding the MultiWPR strategy. I am thinking to extend the boundaries. They are -30 and -70 now. These number gives sometimes ranging results. Not that it is a problem, you can see that with your eye and filter it away. But real trendig conditions seems to put the curve closer to 0 and -100. I will investigate that in the coming week. But still - no matter the number, then the very tip of the curve is good information. A steep tip up or down shows trending curve.

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Did you ever consider that price doesn't move in sine waves? It's more like this if you average (and noramlize) over trends of equal lengths: Attached Image (click to enlarge) And when looking at different average trends, you'll even see a "constant": Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #112 ---
Riskfighter, let me know. For your analisys multi tf, you start from d1 and arrivem15 correct?

--- 帖子 #113 ---
I promissed to share my daily analysis structure. There are many ways to do this, even using only my method. I will be trading the H1 TF today and this is what I will show. Keep in mind, that thursday and friday containged surprices, that affect the curves into this week. Will JPY still be strong trending? And this add to the fact, that this is monday. You cannot trust the Asian market on mondays. EU and US might want to do something else than the Asian. I think it is a waste to use too many timeframes. You might miss trendings if you sort away pairs on the daily that are trending nicely at M15. So for analysing the H1 I will use the Daily, H4 and H1 timeframes. I like to see Pairs that a keeping in OB and OS areas. Pais with a liniare trending performance from Low to High or High to Low. A steep tip of the curve. I will sort away on the daily the pairs that are obviously ranging. Today I will sort away GBPAUD, NZDCAD, NZDCHF, NZDUSD for this reason. More pairs could be sorted away, but I give them a chance to the next level.

--- 帖子 #114 ---
Now looking at H4. Same things as when looking at Daily. I will sort away AUDJPY, EURJPY, GBPJPY. I see that GBPCAD was a fault. It is trending nicely on H1. This leaves me with 17 pairs out of 24 after sorting on Daily and H4. There are really go in the market today.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Now going to H1 timeframe. Many pairs are still in the game. I go for the pairs that looks the best. The GBP pairs are lying steady in the very top of the chart. There you have it. Nice trending pairs. There really a no pairs that I will sort away now based on the WPR analysis. So now comes next step.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Now the WPR break down has enden. 17 pairs remain. Here comes the more time consuming part. On each pair open the bar chart and do your normal analysis. S&amp;R, channels, whatever you normally do. I like to have the Smoothed Heiken Ashi present to support a quick view on the trend. Parameters: 1.1.45.1 Thats how I do it. Then I have the Multi WPR chart on hand during the day on M15 to keep an eye on actual status.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Again - this is my way. Nobody says it is the way that fit anybody else. I fill it is nice and quick to find the interesting pairs and get rit of the noice from non interesting pairs. If you are working on other timeframes, then use the method your way. But be ware, that excluding pairs on to much higher timeframes might remove some nice trends on lower timeframes. And again - the grail for me is not my trading strategy - it is the Crystal Ball which tells me which pairs are trending. Now I will start trading at 9:00 ECT. I will watch the MultiWPR chart at M15 at that time to see the actual curves in order to select my pairs to trade.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
I keep away from JPY today. So this is where I have ended up right now. Many of those pairs are to far away from the mean. That is the backside of finding the most trending. I have to wait to se some pullbacks.

--- 帖子 #119 ---
I may not fully understand what you're positing, but I see it simply through the eyes of an ordinary trader, observing price on chart that have undergone smoothing by brokers or liquidity providers. Prices movement follow liquidity providers as prices fluctuate; if not smoothed, it would be too noisy (no filtering). Unless you are HFT Traders, so we wont be too sophisticated. Some say average some say mean, it does not matter, when price fluctuate, average or mean does the same, and yes its a sinewave. Your data shows a half sine wave when trending.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Not implying anything. I just like to make you (others) awars that price doesn't move in "sine waves". People sticking to the sine wave pov believe that price moves fastest during the mid of trends, and slow towards the start and end of trends. However, surveying trends, the opposite seems to be the case. AND: the momentum at the start and end is (of course always on average) identical, regardless of the subsequent trend duration, i.e. the inital momentum is no predictor of the subsequent trend. Just here to tie up loose ends ...

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Depends on how you view this - If price trends and ranges and those price extremes fit into lengths, as Hurst discovered back in the 60's and Gann etc before that, then you can crunch those prices into Sinewaves, "adjust" the phase of the cycle length to match price action and create a composite index of all the cycles, sometimes (most of the time) you'll have a highly correlated cycle prediction trend direction SP500 Attached Image (click to enlarge) Natural Gas - notice the 2nd LOW cycle Inverted - It was clearly forming a high rather than a low, so you just flip you're trend expectation - traders need to be able to adjust to price action, but the cycle wave was still there and thereafter arrived bang on time again Attached Image (click to enlarge) UK Stock Attached Image (click to enlarge) Obviously it is impossible to work out the expected AMPLITUDE of the price move, as markets run off multiple cycles of varying length, that are all interacting with each other, but you will find more often than not, that 1 cycle dominates price action until another takes over etc The main thing with this is being able to have a high probability idea of turns in terms of TIME - I also have the DJIA from 1900 to 2100 and so far +/- 6 months allowance its been very very very accurate

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Guys, you are being a bit sofisticated now. However your discussion does fit into this thread whitch is about finding the direction of next days trend, so it is wellcome. So by adjusting the phases - do you mean that the x-axis (time) is dynamically adjusted in order to fit the frequence?

--- 帖子 #123 ---
But hey - people with normal brains like me, are still wellcome to join the thread discussing more everyday practical issues ;-)

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Those charts are WEEKS, but you could quite easily do it for days, hours, intraday etc (would be a bit of work, but it could be done Yes - the cycle length remains the same, so say 50 days, but when you place them both on a chart they might be out of sync with the actual low to low, so you have to adjust the phasing so it pulls the set cycle length of 50 days to a low, so that lows to lows line up - once you have a fit, it will always exist, but might not always show up if the market moves to another cycle etc So you can use cycles to predict possible trend changes and then use technicals to trade with/from etc PS- yeah totally keep everything as straight-forward and simply as possible - I just believe that cycles move the markets and finding the cycle you can get 1 step ahead of the pack and then just apply simple trading from the cycle etc

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Very interesting. I will look into this when I get the time.

--- 帖子 #126 ---
So I chosed 6 pairs to trade today using my TopDown WPR method. Here is a sandbox for the day. Not an impressing day, but not a loss either. The trend is bearly holding, is was a real monday. But trend is intakt.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
4 of your trades are long GBP. Is it not a concern that you become overexposed to 1 currency during your trading day? Some kind of news against GBP could really damage your account.

--- 帖子 #128 ---
It is a concern that many people have. Not me. My money management is in place. I am not risking the 1 or 2 % on a trade which is normal. So if I lose 4 trades syncrone, then I might lose 1-2% in all. In my money accounts I am using a scalping strategy. I am keeping the trade for typically 2 bars. If I were swing trading, then I would be more exposed for having several syncrone trades. So in all, I have no problem.

--- 帖子 #129 ---
Hello. what are the indicators that you use looking formarket cycle?

--- 帖子 #130 ---
6:45 ECT in the morning. I will start trading FOREX at 9:15. So I made the filter for today removing non trading pairs from H4 and H1. At 9:00 I will remove from M30 and M15. At this point the steep tip is vital, because it shows steep trends. Then I have the actual trending pairs. I want to have only the 4 best trending pairs, so I will then have to go into the bar charts to judge volume etc. This will surely leave me with 4 pairs that are steeply trending at the beginning of the day and has been trending for a while, which is just as important. Then I trade ONLY in the direction of the trend, no matter what happens. You could in stead of my method just make a top down analysis of each chart the traditional way. What I do is removing obvious non trending pairs very fast. Leaving me with about half the pairs to analyze. And as I close down all pairs that has been vrecked, then I have a nice screen with the pairs left for analysing. Note that I of cause use MT4.

--- 帖子 #131 ---
Todays chosen pairs. Yes - they are all CHF. Nothing else really good right now. But I risk 0.22% on each, so risking less than 1% on 4 trades. And because I am scalping, they will not be trades 100% syncroneous.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Hello, thanks for the nice system, can you post your last template with the MA's and smoothed Heikin-Ashi or the setting of them. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
Heiken Ashi I set to 1, 25, 1, 1. This way it behaves like a 25EMA. So it could be an EMA, but I like the way it shows the trend. Then I use LWMA10 (Yellow) and EMA15. Thats realy all. Then you can use all kinds of Trending strategies to decide when to take the trade. I had a nice week with this system. But today when all is CHF, if they don't work, then I will have no profit. So normally I try to not have same pairs. I trade between 9 and 14 CET.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Thanks for the quick response ! Have a nice day with lots of green pips.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Hi - Actual low to low and high to high cycles that the SP500 has printed over the years, that are dominant for that Index The Blue line is the actual SP500 PRICE weekly and the RED line is the composite cycle index which is made up of all those cycles in the bottom of the screenshot

--- 帖子 #136 ---
OK, That prediction was lousy. It went into ranging.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
You get days like that But you have good Moneymanagment to cover them No harm done Here is a simple thought ?

--- 帖子 #138 ---
I see what you meen. Ranging from a round number and using round numbers to each side. Very interesting observation. You should try to observe if that is a common thing that happens often. That would make it possible to trade ranging price action.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
can you explain your ts? grid???

Monday again. And vacation time. Should maybe not be trading? But weekend has been long and I need to go working. So here are the chosen ones for this day. Not done yet. I start trading in 2 hours from now, so I can go into details with each chart and remove what I don't like. Have a nice trading day.

So I got this tool from JaimeAlejan. It shows that GBP, EUR and JPY are strong and CAD, NZD are weak. This will help filtering the pairs to trade today. Mika's Breakout strategy | Forex Factory Post #10.

--- 帖子 #145 ---
On Thursday, July 18, the Indicator had a cross between AUD vs JPY and entered into Sale, although it had a decline, today the downward trend continues and I place a trade with a little more lotage. Attachment g On Friday the 19th I saw that the AUDCHF was in the same situation and made a Sale. Today the downward trend continues and I return with a little more confidence. Attachment g My other operations are a little more speculative since I like fundamental analysis. The risk is a little lower and they are swing traders. Waiting for crossovers with the Currency Strength Indicator works for now. If anyone uses it, please share your experience. Attachment g

--- 帖子 #146 ---
WOW - I think this is a perfect system to decide the trend of the next day. Thank you very much for enlightning us. I will go into it a bit deeper in the time to come!!

--- 帖子 #147 ---
I just passed the first phase of a challenge with that strategy, so I hope to work with you to better study the trends and make some profits. We are in contact

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Do you use the green and red lines in your decision? for example: only overlaps within the two lines?

--- 帖子 #149 ---
You bet. I look forward to the work.

--- 帖子 #150 ---
I found currency strenght meters to be very lugging. They works only if the trend is lasting longer but on ranging market you will be getting signals and immediatly after price will reverse hitting your SL. but if you are able to identify a trend than you don't need any strength meter.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Yes, but if you take the strongest values compared to the weakest, then you should be able to find trends. Of cause confirm with other tools or by watching. I will use a tool like this only to confirm the daily trend. Maybe H4. Nothing lower. They will fluctuate to much. Jaime does not trade right away. He checks next day if the trade can be confirmed before he take it, to avoid as you say trades, where it shifts back right away. And of cause it is not forbidden to use other confluences to confirm. I think it is worth testing. But you are right, if you are able to find the trend using other methods, then this tool will only be for confirming. I have had some doubts about JPY for the last week because a major shift happened. The tool shows me the current status of JPY. It is coming back. I can use that.

AUDCHF continues down. How do you set SL and TP? Or do you let it run?

--- 帖子 #158 ---
To take SL or TP I use an indicator that automatically marks the psychological levels (Closed numbers where the price tends to bounce), daily levels, weekly and monthly levels, in addition to the famous pivots. I attach a photo and the indicator so you can prove it. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The strategy is simple: 1.- if the price broke any monthly, psychological or weekly level, both bullish and bearish. 2.- the currency strength indicator crosses a pair or everything indicates that it will do so in the next few days. 3.- the general trend at first glance indicates the direction of the price (common sense seeking to go in favor of the trend) 4.- enter operation. with TP at the next weekly, monthly or psychological level (blue dotted lines) and SL above or the last levels and there being some line corresponding to an important level that marks the graph. RR 1:3,4,5,6 In the case of AUDCHF I had to close the operation because my funding account reached its desired percentage but the price continued to fall. If I had the operation open I would let it run until the next monthly level. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #159 ---
I'm waiting for them to give me my new credentials in the challenge I'm doing. so I will be trading just to check the strategy in an account that I almost burned by using it with an EA leaving it at 35 dollars haha. I enter Sale in AUDUSD following the current Trend reviewing Renko Charts of 5 pips each block. The currency strength indicator marks a possible crossover in the coming days.

This is very much interesting. I will investigate it. However right now my head is full of a couple of other projects, so it will have to wait a little. I have traded RENKO for a long time, but had to give it up. Too many losses. I think with the strategies that I am running now, I should start up RENKO again. he he, when I get time.

Hmm - I am not sure what you mean ?? Please explain.

Very nice setup. To me that kind of trading is way to manuel. My stummock cannot have it - it does not trust my eyes nor my little brain. But most traders will have use of this setup. So thank you for the contribution.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
So fine advice ;-)

--- 帖子 #169 ---
I'm going to take a look at this indicator after work, I think it fits my strategy very well. Thanks for sharing. (all that remains is to analyze whether it is compatible with renko candles)

--- 帖子 #170 ---
The levels are the same no matter what type of candles you use. You just have less noise with Renko.

--- 帖子 #171 ---
So what to trade tomorrow? Well the 6 pairs I have traded this week are still going strong, so why not continue! At some point it will turn around. And these pairs all are going strong during the Asian hours. I will be ready.

--- 帖子 #172 ---
Thanks for sharing. much appreciated. I saw your RSI setting on windows 1. great radar to not lose direction. It seems very efficient indeed. regarding the fractal level indicator instead, can you tell us more? I have many indicators but I'm really missing this one

if you want use pm.... and for RSI? what are the set up you use for different tf?

--- 帖子 #178 ---
GBPCHF short entry, I had already made a successful entry yesterday, but according to my analysis, it seems that it will continue to fall a little more, if the SL is not there to help us control losses. Full bearish trend

Now I have to leave. I'll be back at 2pm. See you later. meanwhile you write. Let's just hope that the author of this 3D doesn't get angry because we're going off topic. although I believe that the rsi as set up can help a lot in finding the right direction.

Nice one. I have been playing with the Currency meter of yours. Make a post later.

Guys, what you are doing fits very nice into this thread. Thank you very much for your contribution. I don't disturb your chat because allthough it is a fine system, it does not suite my lousy manual trading skills.

I trade the Asian slot. Begin at 1:30 ECT. As an european this means that I am trading at nights. A bit unconveniant. But then I have all day to investigate other aspects of trading. This night my method told me about many pairs stopping the trend, at least for making a pullback. And yes, my chosen pairs did not give me trading signals. They were flat. So no money for me this night. So I have played with the Currency meter from Jamie - see post 144. My take is to trade the pairs with the 2 most trending and the 2 least trending currencies at the moment for the trading. Use the M5 or M15. This is trading in real time guys. Result was amazing. Again - it is less important which system you trade compared to knowing what is trending and in which direction.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Makes complete sense to me

Hi OAPDave,trying to understand the system ,wold you mind a giving more details about the system and how do you set up your rsi and ma cos mine is just forming a straight line. Thanks

post 201 Weekly: Trend long. pullback in progress. daily;rsi crossed short confirming the weekly pull back. h4 rsi doesn't help me much even if it is clearly short. on the graph the price bounced off the yellow trend line. h1: rsi below 50. still bearish. we wait for the pulback to end and go back long. but what signals should we start from?

Please share how you are using it, on what timeframe and how useful it is when looking for trends. I have done backtesting on timeframes below 1D and personally I find it quite confusing. I like Scalping but I haven't found any strategy that suits me. At the moment Swing Trading is working quite well for me. I am learning to detach myself from money and operate percentages. I have several possible entries in Swing for next week. Tomorrow afternoon in Asia time I will upload them to the thread. Greetings to All

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Trend is only part of the equation, trend strength/quality is also needed. Imho.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
For scalping, the H4 timeframe has too large an interval. This is an example of a good signal (pattern) that often appears during London trading hours, throughout my trading history and observations. Sometimes it doesn't appear, but if it does, it can be used to gain a small scalping profit or intraday profit. This is an Edge.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Interesting reflection, although here we try to focus more on the trend and certain patterns, I think that the structure is in the background although it is a complement that we all use. Example of the analysis that I am doing with EURUSD and my strategy. Attached Image (click to enlarge) I see a structure but a notable change in strategy. In addition, the strength of the currencies may have a crossover in the next week. Attached Image (click to enlarge) For a swing trade, my analysis says that there will be a slight downward trend reaching some Fibo level or until the trend changes again.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
EURUSD on TF 15 to H1 shows a flat trend and a small range of only 44 pips. If aiming for 1/3 of 44, there's a chance to get just 15 pips, which is enough for scalping but will be choppy. A 15 pips SL is too small, at least 25 pips are needed. So, it's not a good pair for scalping or intraday trading at the moment. When choppy you trade always inside (sell or buy to the mean).

--- 帖子 #212 ---
I totally agree, that's why I don't do Scalping, my Stoploss generally go from 25 pips and TakeProfit up to 200 pips depending on the trend. Operations from 1 to 5 days As you can see in the following graph, each vertical line is a day and each Renko Candle is 10 pips that the price travels. So it's easier to see the journey in pips, but there are days when the price doesn't really do anything and the Renko Candles make that clear. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

For Long Term EURUSD no clear direction this time. It is in the middle now.

Hi Jaime I use the meter to see what is trending right now - in this exact moment. I do not use the Cross as you do, allthough I acknowledge, that it is a fine strategy. So everything that is outside the green and red lines is interesting. This is reality TV. I love it. This meter is better than other takes where only the digit value is shown, because you can see what happen in real time. If the value is beyond #2 but pointing down, then it is not time to trade. Here is what I did friday. The pairs that I had chosen for the day were doing - NOTHING! And you can se that on the currency meter. Everything were flat. Then I took a look at the currency meter around 3:00 and found, that AUD suddently was strong. There were some trades. I was to late to see it, but I would have been able to do some pips on the AUD currency, which I had not planned. But pips are pips! So before noon you had a situation where pairs with NZD against JPY, EUR and CHF might have been scalped. So I will use the currency meter (CM) in 2 ways now. 1) I am trading the pairs that I have chosed using my WPR, but I will have the CM on screen to keep an eye on the overall picture and possibilities for extra scalps in other instruments. I am trading the M15 (not allways) I will have the CM present on M15 during trading. 2) When I chose pairs to trade using my WPR methode, I often get multiple possibilities and I chose the best 4 or 6 pairs, but others could have been traded as well. Now I will have the CM to help me chose between the 10 pairs I have as possible trades. Let's say I have 4 chosen pairs on the screen. Then 6 charts which are folded down. But if some of the folded pairs have a nice action on the CM, then I can change to those pairs. This way I might find more trades just when they happens.

Hi Roels... In this thread I am talking about predicting the next days trend. You could say, that if we at the beginning of the day can tell where the price will go and how the daily bar will look at the end of day, then we have an edge in finding trades during the day. Then I say: If you know the behavior of the instrument on beforehand, then any strategy you have will make money. So this is my take on the grail.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Well, I don't know what you're looking at, but I see a downward trend with its setbacks and it's not even necessary to mark trend lines. If there wasn't a defined trend, nobody would trade the EURUSD pair.

--- 帖子 #217 ---
In that case, our understanding is not the same. Then regarding trading, whether there is a clear trend or not (choppy), people still trade. PIC 1 Okay, how will the daily bar move, up or down? EURUSD PIC 2

--- 帖子 #218 ---
An example - look at this guy. Reveiled at the MultiWPR screen, that this par has been in a steep trend on the Daily for the whole of July. Then going to H4, H1 and M30 - still a nice trend which should have given tons of pips. Will it continue today? I bet on it. Might lose, but that is part of the game. If I am right, then there will be some profit fot me.

Hi Any particular reason you have restricted me from sending you a P.M ps So does that mean that you would like me to refrain from posting on the thread as well ?

I totally agree with your analysis with the EURNZD, it seems and according to my strategy I would continue with a buy operation looking for a 1:2 risking .5% of the account, although on the daily level the Currency Strength Indicator shows a small weakening in EUR, maintaining good risk management will probably get a few pips. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #224 ---
I'm glad that this indicator is also working for your strategy, I will continue testing and probably when I have a little more free time I will try some Scalping strategy. I found it right here on ForexFactory in this thread which is much more extensive and complex. It will probably help you, like me, to expand your trading by following trends: https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...ngth-dashboard

--- 帖子 #225 ---
The higher the price goes, the more likely it is to fall soon. When this happens, I generally expect the price to start consolidating in some area for several days until it subsequently falls. There are probably entries for Scalping, but for Swing, as I operate, it is already too much of a journey. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) For example, this is something I notice in GBPUSD. According to my strategy and analysis, I would go for a sell position with good risk management, especially due to some fundamental news that affects the entire UK economy and the USD is getting stronger.

I remember now. We had a conversation on PM. We could not really use the tool because we could not add files. Furthermore it is an amateur User Interface, which I cannot use to have many daily conversations. So I switched of the PM function. Not towards you - that cannot be done, but in total. Nobody can PM me. I can switch it on for a short time, but it will be switched off again. I just don't like the function. It is a little like on public homepages when you have to fill in some text, then you get a little field at the size of a stamp. That is because silly programmers find that smart. Well, I have been a software Project manager for 25 years, and I can assure, that those small stampfields never survived in any of my projects.

--- 帖子 #227 ---
I saw all your post Jamie. They need a little thinking which I cannot do now - I am setting up my charts. Later. So I have today 11 chosen charts. I must say, that July have been very well trending. But nothing is happening as the currency meter tells. So I watch the meter and is ready to trade the selected pairs which will be active on the meter.

--- 帖子 #228 ---
WOW. That is a good thread. Look forward to go deep into it.

Hi No Problem Understood

--- 帖子 #232 ---
We trade in slightly different ways but who care's as long as we are profitable

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Here is how I can use the Currency Strength Meter (CSM) Example: My WPR analysis told me, that AUDCAD have a nice trend on H4 to the north. So I should be trading AUDCAD Long today. However looking af CSM on the Daily TF - I can see that: AUD and CAD lies both below the -2 line and next to each other. This indicates that there are no strength condition for the time being wich can help to predict the direction. It rather tells about possible ranging conditions. Both lines are pointing down. So no sign that one of them will begin to pull off. So - AUDCAD has been trending nicely on H4 for a time, but there is no power in any of them. As I found 14 trending pairs using the WPR, then there is a possibility to narrow the field using this methode. Today I excluded 3 pairs. Then another way to use the CSM. Forget the WPR. Use only the CSM. The curves for yesterday show, the EUR had the most power and were continuing AUD and NZD had low power pointing down. So presumelly best pairs for trading today should be EURAUD and EURUSD in Long direction. This strength difference has been going on for 3 weeks. So if you only want to trade a few pairs, those could be the choice for now.

And your way is absolutely a profittable way.

Just a little ramble Trend Direction is a must Trend Strength is a must We have seen a few ideas how to find Trend Direction So what are our thoughts when we get a good entry in the correct Direction What are our expectations in pips This is just MY OWN view as I am UK based hence I never see the Daily start as in bed sleeping When I open my charts, I want to see how much ADR as already been used and how much is left In general this means I look for pairs with decent ADR Ranges These examples should give clues and show when average ADR as been reached and perhaps which pairs to jump on, when I am at my post ready to trade End of ramble

I just found this very interesting pair. NZDJPY, after several days of consolidation, is starting to break the bearish trend to rise a little. These types of structures are my favorites. They are generated a lot in the EURAUD, one of my favorite pairs, after days of consolidation, it takes off strongly in one direction for DAYS. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Currency Strength in H4 shows currency crosses and in the Daily chart it shows that the two currencies are at extremes. I also like to analyze fundamentals, it is often heard that the Yen will not be able to withstand the capital injection that was made without suffering a significant setback, we do not know but this type of manipulation by central banks tends to correct itself.

Is there a reason you are trading only GJ?

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Well - right now the whole market is in a consolidation. So there will be plenty of those trades for you. It is break out trading and the break out direction should most of the time be a trend continuation, but it can also be the change of overall trend direction.

--- 帖子 #244 ---
@Jaime I have another thread going. There I show my exact trading strategy. I call it MIKA after the woman who shared the method in a very old and closed thread. And for the time being I have a very interesting discussion about Currency Strength Trading with Zorox. I think you should take a look.

--- 帖子 #245 ---
My problem is, that I don't make indicators. There is a difference between indicators and EA's. Roughly you could say, that indicators measures back in time. EA's cannot measure back in time. Because of this difference there are some vital differences in the command set and the way the program is built. So short - I would like to make that indi for you because I like you, but it would be a too time consuming piece of work. In the other thread that I have ongoing, I discuss my strategy - the way I trade. In this present strategy the meaning is to discuss how to find the best trending pairs and predict the move of the next daily bar.

--- 帖子 #246 ---
I have checked for today how the trading had been if I had traded all crosses on the Currency Strength Meter. I checked 10 pairs at the M15. And it was very precise. My robot gave me a signal at exactly the crossing point. More interesting is, that it gave pips in all examples. This can be traded as a scalping maching. So tomorrow I will take a trade exactly at the crosses. RR 1:1. I will begin at the Asian market at 2am ECT. This is exiting.

Well, I have heard no one doing it, execp for Jamei and he is more swing trading. I want to scalp and it is money in the pocket.

@Jaime How is this happening. See the JPY curve on the M30 and H1. Is it repainting?

--- 帖子 #254 ---
On Monday afternoon the AUDCAD had a cross on the indicator, and it had also maintained a bearish trend for days, as my strategy indicated, and today the fundamentals helped a lot with the price development, in 30 minutes the price dropped about 60 pips suddenly. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #255 ---
I really don't know, I would have to check it with more time, I have not detected that the indicator repaints because I use it in D1 and H4 time frames. The movements are much slower in those time frames. From what I see, the upward impulse of H1 with the Yen is the rise and fall in M30. Could you take a screenshot, close the chart and re-enter the indicator to confirm if it gives the same values?

IMO the Alligator is very lagging. When you need 3 MA's to syncronize, then half of the trend has allready been missed. I have made the robot and it was inefficient. It is many years ago since I played with Guppy. Problem is the same as in the Alligator. Many MA's and each of them are lagging. But I think that Guppy is better at keeping you in the trend. And that is the thing as you mention. I am mostly scalping, so I shall not keep the trend. But my bid on it is simply a Moving Average. I use 25EMAlow + Spread for Long trends and 25EMAhigh for short trends. I have those on my chart so that I can follow the situation. I colour them using Smoothed Heiken Ashi with settings 1, 25, 1, 1. So here is my take. I predict the trend using the WPR. The I Enter using my scalping strategy and normally take RR 1:x If you are succesfull in predicting the trend, then nealy any strategy will get you into the trades.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
As something new I have learned this. At the Currency Strenght Meter find steep curves like here on JPY and AUD. Each cross on these currencies with other currencies is a prediction of the comming strong continuation movement.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Keep it simple This is what I use: 10 &amp; 20 Simple Moving averages RSI &amp; W%R Price Price HAS to be above/(below for shorts) both the 10&amp; 20 SMA's for longs - they need to be trending, the angle of the SMA's ideally need to be 1-2 O'Clock on a clock face Price then needs to pullback to the 10 or 20 SMA - you can sell the low of the prior bar or swing (shorts) or buy the high of the prev bar if long You'll find that the RSI is above / below a certain % level for longs and shorts and the W%R will be above -50% for longs and below 50% (most like under -20%) More often than not, price will turn at the 10 SMA These are DAILY timeframes - Wheat and a UK stock Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) If the SMA's have a "bulge" between the 10 &amp; 20 SMA, then its not a bullish signal - but you can test if of Interest - the perfect ones are uniform smoothness of the 10 &amp; 20 SMA's

The only way to take advantage of the trend is to buy or sell when you have a predefined setup and make sure you are in the market before a trend develops. Exit when the market has expanded (multiple MVA's is one way of seeing an expanded market) SMALL LOSSES ...BIG WINNERS. Trade both ways. The losers will be stopped out while the winners will stick. There are multiple ways in doing this.

--- 帖子 #267 ---
It's most likely due a turn upwards very soon I just trade the high probability set-ups, not every wiggle of it - all I want are the high prob pullbacks, follow the trend for profit then out As you can find these set-ups everyday on all the markets out there on some time-frame

Last examples and I'll leave your thread be - once I start, I can't stop! On Intra-day markets I typically target 2R profit, and on the longer term daily / weekly charts trail a stop 2 bars back, as this typically produces greater than 2R over the year per trade as an average - I sometimes sell a portion of the position once up 1R too - depends on how I feel on the day or if I need the money! I personally trade this across 200 UK stocks + forex + commodities + Indexes and there are multiple opportunities per trading day across many time-frames - I prefer 60 min and daily These are live current trades (UK stocks) - Long only examples WEEKLY TF Attached Image (click to enlarge) Same stock on Daily TF Attached Image (click to enlarge) Daily TF Attached Image (click to enlarge) PS - the 2RSI can be used for better timing along with the W%R &gt;-50% - as the 2RSI usually goes OS at the key turns

Last one as I'm very conscious we're hijacking this thread The DAILY TF 2RSI was &lt;25% and the 15RSI &gt;40% (This usually signals some sort of bounce in price) - you can look at the pattern on the daily which was sort of sideways trading range yo-yoing off lows - I'm not bothered about the pattern on the daily, as long as the pattern on the lower time-frame shows bullishness AND the SMA's are 10&gt;20 and there's a meaningful pullback to the SMA's along with 2RSI&lt;25% I choose to trail a 2 bar trailing stop of the low on this trade - entry, stop and exit shown on chart This was a picture perfect trade that did as expected Attached Image (click to enlarge)

so you consider the higher timeframe? if yes, how do you do your top down annalysis. 4hr/15m,1hr/5m.

here I am. Thanks for sharing the posts and indicators. However, I must ask you for help on the use and interpretation of ADR. when today's Hi to Low exceeds Dayli Av it means that today's candle exceeds the width of the average candles of XX days before. this should be interpreted as force ok. but what advantage does it give me? and if instead Hi to Low was &lt; Dayli Av what do I deduce? I don't know how to use ADR Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Ok Would it be an Idea to take you Trend Bias of a bigger Time frame and not take every cross Also when we open we have NO ADR so we can see the ADR expand , it can go the (Wrong way) to our Bias But do we get better results when it corrects Now we have some Targets as we watch ADR Expand ?

ok corrrect me if im wrong,using GbpJpy for example, so we take trend bias of 4hr (which shows rsi over 50)uptrend then go to lower timeframe 5/15min but they are already below 50 so does that mean no trade since 4hr is upternd but 5/15 mins is downtrend using rsi or we drop down to 1hr timeframe ?

Attached Image (click to enlarge) question open to everyone. What would you do on Monday with this graph? the tf is h4. a long reaction is perhaps to be expected. for a trader position, what would you do?

--- 帖子 #322 ---
Trend more often continue than change direction. I would take only short trades on some shorter TF. I agree that some pullback has to occur soon. But note that the WPR is utmost low and give no sign to a change is coming. So until a change shows up, I am following the trend. Proper money management and we will not lose too much during the trend change. When it happens, we are ready to go North.

--- 帖子 #323 ---
One of my trading problems used to be, that I was allways fearfull that the trend would not continue. So I did not dare to trade. And then I followed and saw, that the trend was continuing forever and I lost so many opportunities. Now a days I keep trading the trend and when it change direction, then I have a loosing day. No problem. Loosing is part of the game.

--- 帖子 #324 ---
Always have some method of determining the TREND - this can really help you, being price or moving averages or indicators etc This chart shows a number of factors and it fits into WD Gann's trend determination methods that he mentioned in the early1900's This is the official FED's fund rate for decades and we can see 2 clear trends up and down Higher Highs / Higher Lows on the way up and Lower Highs and Lower Lows on the way down The times when you got lower lows and lower highs in the uptrend were much much smaller than any correction in the uptrend and same applies for the down trend for rallies Watch for a change of trend when the time and price exceeds that of any correction in the prior trend - happening right now Regardless, trading in the direction of the trend is always the path of least resistance From a cycle analysis point of view - there's a clear 40 year DOWN cycle played out, I don't have the price data from the 1930's to show the 40 year up cycle, but anyway, if we've got the cycle right then we should see rising trend up for the next 40 years, along with the periods of double digit rates etc This is one to pass down to the next generations, because you have a way of predicting Interest rates (long term) here which is in 2050-2060 there should be double digit int rates in play and all that that brings economically - This is where cycle analysis comes in, it allows you to forecast the end of a trend, but that's going off subject and adds a few layers of complication Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Wonderfull knowledge.

--- 帖子 #327 ---
So guys. We all have our methods. If we gather all traders on FF then we know it all. Can we make a tiny test here? Each of you - please tell which two pairs you will trade on monday, if you are only allowed to trade 2 pairs. And what will be you analysing? I will show two pairs also - sometime tomorrow, Sunday.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
And The Prize Is ps If this is meant to include me Sorry but I play Walking Football Monday and Thursday mornings and some-times League matches on Wednesday Mornings if my body allows, and I am 75 in October Remember I have No Robot just trade manual when I see a set up Saying that my interest will always be in JPY Pairs only on very rare occasions other pairs

--- 帖子 #329 ---
OK. Yes I cannot expect everybody to work the same way as me. I am 69 and the only exercise I get is my fingers on the keyboard - almost 24/7. My robots are normally not left alone - can be. They are just an assistent that takes the trades I have decided to take. Mondays I might not be trading before London open, but all other days I trade from about 2 am London time. And I am present. I need 4-5 trades to reach my goal. Then I get some more sleep and then I can relax most of the day visiting FF and Youtube to get viser and optimizing strategies and robots. So my habit is to analyse the market at sunday evening and decide what to trade the next day. For the time being I use my MULTI WPR tool and Curency Strength Analysis. I believe to have an edge this way. If I should trade only one currency, then I totally agree that it would be the JPY pairs. They normally also ends up as part of my trading. Have a nice Sunday!

--- 帖子 #330 ---
The Prize is, that we all can learn from each other. In this thread many traders have learned a lot from You. You have been very generous.

--- 帖子 #331 ---
So here is my 2 cents for monday. JPY and CHF are being stronger every day. AUD is being weaker. Two of the pairs I will keep an eye on Monday is AUDJPY and AUDCHF. If you don't want same currency in both pairs, then AUDJPY and CADCHF. Things might go in another direction, but these pairs have been in a nice trend for 3 weeks now. And the trend has been even steeper the last days. Of cause we are awaiting a pullback soon, and it might be on Monday. But if I should fear those pullbacks, then I never get any trades. I go for an edge here, and if I am wrong, then there will be no foot at the table monday, then I can lose a couple of pounds. Amazing.

--- 帖子 #332 ---
traders don't need to "know it all" to beat the market, they need to agree on rules, for example "TurtleTraders". but that is hard since every trader think he/she has the perfect setting, so they will disagree on every rule :/ the only factor that no trader can disagree with is TIME, because they have no say in it since it is a FACT. TIME can organize Direction and PA(HHHL-LLLH) for traders to read the market correctly then plan their trading style, strategy, entries/exits .... etc. TIME= number of TF bars in desired period(session/day/week/month ....) examples for H1 TF, week(120) for direction, day(24) for PA (just remember, this is for reading the market not a strategy) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) cheers,

A fine way to show a trending pair.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
I think I will go long EUR/NZD if the pattern emerges after London Open. So, just this one trade, because I still have one short position in CHF/JPY. I might close it after the market open tomorrow at morning local time. CHF/JPY should have actually been closed earlier when it was around 30 pips in profit, but it was already too late at night. There is a possibility that the Monday gap opens even lower, but the position can only be closed after a few hours because trading is not possible when the spread is too high.

--- 帖子 #335 ---
Hi I have a simply template to trade with Sometimes the trade as gone without me (still in bed) as I trade around London Open Other Times there might be a big gap which I do not fancy or simply I just do not want to trade the template that particular day This is so Simple most guys will just laugh and move on to something a little more Guru_ish I use MY Chart Open, then use the +/- 23% either side as initial entries and stops If my thoughts think the Trend is down I Sell the - 23% Line with the + 23% Line as a initial Stop Opposite for a BUY We have Targets to aim for but also think how to take the Risk out of the trade as soon as possible I have developed a decent money management Method to add to this rather simple method that works well Also I have rules about how many times I trade these 2 levels in a day just in case its a real whipsaw day So in fact the money management could be said to be more important than the actual Trading Method Think Buy account Sell account ? If guys do a little chart watching, there are trades that set up better than others My Simple logic Above OPEN Their is Buying Below OPEN Their is Selling on that day so no need for me to post everyday

I am working hard on my own robots. I am close to have them as I like, but still need some work. Might be better in a couple of months from now. I don't work on other peoples code. I am doing things my way and it is different. I have this function in my robots allready, so if I should do it, it would be using my own code. To be honest it will no be hard to do it.

Update on todays results ? ps Only one problem today They went without me as still sleeping

--- 帖子 #357 ---
He he, same here. I was not sleeping though, but the firework started very very early. I got up 2am ECT, and that was too late. But right now there is a pull back and if it will continue the trend, then my Mika system is ready to take up the fight. Then of cause I have the Sandbox. A robot which takes everything. It is for me to get experience. As it is not real money it just works 24/7. As you see, it would have been nice to trade all 28 Forex pairs today. But that is Fantacy land. Not for real.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Yes you are one lucky guy to have those skills Got to give you a pat on the back ps Ever thought about this ?

If you have found a better fit Good use it then After all its your money ps Perhaps you could post to show me

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Here is why you cannot leave a robot alone to take all signals. A robot is NOT the grail. Predicting the trend is the grail. This is not real money. It is my sandbox where I develope robots.

--- 帖子 #362 ---
TBH that puzzles me but in saying that I have no clue what you are dong ?

--- 帖子 #363 ---
This robot Look at Multiple ADX, RSI, CCI, and the 25EMA channel. All these filters must give accept and then the robot takes the trade. It sounds like a lot of secureness, but the thing is, that in ranging conditions this is a loser and in the process of a pair shifting from long to short or the opposite, it is also a loser. Only when the robot is active on a trending pair it can win. Today we had a trending condition during the asian market and the robot made nice money. But in general the London market were ranging, and all the money were lost - plus some more. I have made around 100 robots in my time and it is the same thing allways. So a robot is a nice assistant, but it does not work unless you find a trend for it to work on.

OAPDave , looking at your operations, I seem to observe that you analyze the strength of JPY and once you have identified the direction of the single JPY you open operations on each cross with jpy (BASKET). then open a position beyond the 23.6 range. Is yours a sort of basket trading on JPY or am I wrong?

That's exactly what that composite cycle Index does that I posted EVERY market operates to cycles - Identify and Isolate those cycles or the dominate ones at least and you have a pretty accurate prediction of the future - unless or until the cycle goes out of favour or inverts - but it will always come back This one is a UK bank stock - 4 cycles, picks out the LOW cycles, which obviously force the high cycle RED line is the forecasting cycle Index in both charts Attached Image (click to enlarge) This is Natural Gas - LOW cycles - I can see a 2 year UP, followed by 2 years DOWN - there is 1 INVERSION of the cycle, where a low became a high Attached Image (click to enlarge) Once we know the expected trend then you can just trade that direction according to whatever you choose to find entry points - swings, pullbacks, moving averages, Indicators etc etc If you go back a number of pages to find that comp cycle index of the SP500 you will see that this weeks and last weeks action was not out of the blue I have a similar comp Index of Interest rates - the 2020 rise was not a surprise These 2 are cycle indexes of the DJIA predicted YEARS AGO - I have the Index from 1900 to 2100 - its +/- 6mths - some turns failed such as the 2013-2016 bear market, but we had the 2015 plunge Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) With this one, notice its moving in a up/down sequence - this FORCES the economic "events/conditions" to be either Inflationary or deflationary in terms of business outlook stock market growth - There is another cycle that starts of ends this cycle shown below, so you can time the circa 18 year bull/bear markets to within a couple of weeks of the start/end Attached Image (click to enlarge) So we can PREDICT that sometime in 2034, this UP trend ends and you can see the effects of the down trends Cycles are the only thing I know that can predict trends of the future

Hi Dave I would not trust that it would go the missing 50 pips late at the day. Have you meassured this over some kind of time? I made a robot recently that sell high and buy low in accordance to last day high/Low. Could as well be last week. I think it is quit finished but I never found time to try it. Should I do something with that robot?

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Yes you are wrong. I find the most trending pairs out of 28 - all Forex minus Exotic. I trade them each in accordance to their own trend. No binding to other pairs. I am using a lot of JPY, because it has been trending so nicely for so long - AND because it behaves without too many large wicks.

But it's the same thing and analysis essentially Go to his videos on the link you've posted and look for the 84 year WAR cycle - that is due RIGHT NOW Cycles simply repeat over and over and over and in the markets we can exploit them for financial gain If you go back 100/200/300/400 years from Covid etc you find major pandemic viruses, so in 2120 we can expect another one etc

--- 帖子 #377 ---
No I know, just showing as an example as they exist down on every time-frame, the smaller the time-frame the more work as time passes by quicker, I just prefer the daily and weekly ones because it allows me a lot of breathing space and i'm lazy But if you think about it, if you've isolated a cycle low on a weekly chart, then the daily should turn up, the hourly should, the 30 &amp; 15 min etc - all you do is wait for price to move bullishly and you're away Everytime you catch a trend, you are catching part of an trend on some time-frame that has made a cycle high or low I'm not trying to convert you, just highlight what is happening in markets Cycles often get distorted because price and time aren't working out to a 2 dimensional chart - we are forced to view on a 2D chart, but behind the scenes, price and time are moving at a higher dimension - this is why if you have a 53 day static cycle, eventually it gets out of whack Anyway - in the chart below - this is why randomly using indicators fails - you need to use the indicator along with the cycle high or low - for perfect timing, which foretells the trend - So indicator turns right near 53 days caught these cycle lows perfectly and you could drop down to lower TF's to trade from etc Attached Image (click to enlarge) The markets aren't random, they are geometrically growing/declining and cycles are a big part of that All I've done on this chart of the SP500 is link the 1974 major low to the 2009 major low with a Gann angle as the 1 x 1 (Sets the time and price advancement to an equal 1 x 1) - the other angles are simply 2 x 1, 4 x 1 etc etc etc - There's some amazing touches of these angles and think about it - most of those touches happened BEFORE we were able to plot the 2009 point! such as 1982, 1987, 2000!

@Dave I have this robot which I have named BreakBack. As for now it measure if price has passed yesterday High/Low and then passes back inside yesterday High/Low frame. Then it takes the trade in direction from high to low or low to high. The frame is yesterday High/Low, but I can maek it anything. It will also be possible to manually feed the robot with levels. Could this be a thing we could try out here on this thread - if I upload the robot here? Anyone in for this experiment??

Thanks I'll trade anything from 15 mins out to weekly - All I'm searching for are 100% picture perfect set-ups, doesn't matter the time-frame, if its picture perfect I'll take it and I trade multiple methods/set-ups - these will be set-ups that have a very high probability of working Eurusd the other day - 30 mins Attached Image (click to enlarge) UK stock - 60 mins Attached Image (click to enlarge) UK stock weekly Attached Image (click to enlarge) The main thing to stress - is that the trades are dictated to by price pattern and momentum indicators - if the price pattern isn't there, i don't trade See this chart - the BLUE circles were all very high probability trade potential - because of where price was in the SMA's AND the RSI momentum indicator position was in perfect positions for that CYCLE to reverse - the extent of the cycle reversal isn't known, but we can TIME the turns accurately Attached Image (click to enlarge) I also trade triple bottoms/tops, double tops/bottoms and price swings but in a very controlled way again it has to make sense from a success basis

You are a real hunter. I admire that. If I had the time, I would study your method on a papertrade basis. In the near future I will. You know - I too am hunting the perfect setup. But I make the rules and code it into a robot, then I just have to follow my little assistant that takes the trades for me. The problem is to get the rules sharp enough, because as Dave says it - using the eyeball - the computer have no eyes, it only has the code that I make, so I must be the eyes.

I have looked at the BreakBack robot that I created sometime ago and never finished. I removed some errors and now it prints the lines from yeaterdays High/Low and it take the trade if thoses lines are passed and then passed back again. You can trade multiple pairs. You can select the weekdays it may trade. You can set SL and RiskReward. You can set it to trade only up or down or both directions. This is only the beginning. There are many functions that is needed. Should it be possible to select Daily, Weekly lines? Or lines at a specific level? Must there be some zones around the lines, so that a small riddle does not disturb and lead to false trades? How do we exit the trade? Can it take more than one trade on the pair? So there is a lot of development to do. Just a teaser. I will make a new thread for this on monday. But only active participants will get the robot. Active means: using the robot and report at minimum weekly results and findings and ideas etc.

OK. It seems that the thread is not doing well enough. And I agree. I do not need this thread. So let me hear if there is somebody out there that want to participate in the thread - and not just be reading. If there are to few people, then let us stop posting and let the thread rest in piece.

See I have in the blink of an eye shown you that I found your post interesting and want you to carry on with your project and any help or suggestions I have I will gladly give I apricate you time and effort to help me to learn So to show I am not rude I have taken the necessary action

--- 帖子 #396 ---
I'll post to the finding the trend thread as time goes by as I've a lot still to give, but it will be as a poster to the thread, I don't want to "own" a thread or the commitment

--- 帖子 #397 ---
That would be good enough for me A fair while ago in fact a number of years ago I was on Andrew Pancholi mailing list Found it really interesting but could never quite justify the costs involved Your charts and looking at a few of those video's have peeked my interest again But at my time of life I am afraid I will not be here to take advantage of some of the cycles also I only trade for fun but learning the approach would keep my brain working Other than here there would be no one in my small circle of friends be interested in the subject I guess that's were the video's are the answer ps Sadly I am not a natural on all things computer as well So that's another learning curve

I'm just aware of him, I've never looked past his website or subscribed - the link you posted, had the "war" cycle right in my eye line, hence why I mentioned it, but apart from that I've not watched that many of the videos The main thing with trading is find a method that suits you/your personality - there's about 16 personality types out there - not all trading methods suit everyone I am very very logical, precise and exact - which is why my trading is precise and exact - some traders can place a trade, have a very wide stop and let things move, I cannot do that, hence why I hunt for those picture perfect trade set-ups across 200 odd markets Cycles are truly amazing - mainly for the big picture stuff in terms of major turns - but you can end up looking at lots and lots of stuff that has little effect on the markets - PS Stonehenge was a cycle counter of the sun/moon and eclipse cycles 56 is an important number in that and its why there are/were 56 Aubrey stones in the circle, so cycles aren't anything new, they've been around for thousands of years anyway............................................................. Here's a couple I would encourage everyone to quickly study The first is something totally separate from the markets - COVID - the chart is totally self-explanatory, governments must know this and yet they "get caught out" Attached Image (click to enlarge) This one is a repeating cycle in the SP500 and DJIA for at least the last 100 years! The chart screen shot was made in 2019 - all you do is add 4 years and look for OCTOBER - Larry Williams discovered this decades ago and it usually bottoms around OCTOBER time every 4 years - in 2018 it Inverted into being a HIGH or it came 2 months late however, you want to classify it Attached Image (click to enlarge) Then you just watch and wait and if things turn the way the cycle is expected, you can take advantage of, however, you choose to - by doing this you also have a possible prediction on trend direction etc Seen as we are trying to catch trends Back in 2019, I had Oct 2022 on my charts for the next repetition and look what the SP500 did in that month

--- 帖子 #399 ---
Yes watched the the video with the War and Pandemic and many other cycles in, found it quite compelling , just need to be about 40years younger with a few bob to really take advantage of this style of trading Maybe the Government new about the Pandemic cycle and used to to try and get rid of us OAPs ? Can I as what software you have to keep check of 200 markets as I have noticed you have shown, lets say not the obvious Uk shares ps For what its worth My Go Compare Idea of the S&amp;P

[quote=Thtpro;14956863]{quote} Lo conosco solo ora, non ho mai guardato oltre il suo sito web o mi sono iscritto - il link che hai postato, aveva il ciclo di "guerra" proprio nella mia linea d'occhio, ecco perché l'ho menzionato, ma a parte questo non ho guardato molti dei video La cosa principale nel trading è trovare un metodo che si adatti a te/alla tua personalità - ci sono circa 16 tipi di personalità là fuori - non tutti i metodi di trading si adattano a tutti Sono molto molto logico, preciso ed esatto - ecco perché il mio trading è preciso ed esatto - alcuni trader possono piazzare un trade, avere uno stop molto ampio e lasciare che le cose si muovano, io non posso farlo, ecco perché cerco quelle configurazioni di trading perfette su 200 mercati dispari I cicli sono davvero sorprendenti - principalmente per le cose del quadro generale in termini di svolte importanti - ma puoi finire per guardare un sacco di cose che hanno scarso effetto sui mercati - PS Stonehenge era un contatore di cicli del sole/luna e dei cicli di eclissi 56 è importante numero in questo ed è il motivo per cui ci sono/c'erano 56 pietre di Aubrey nel cerchio, quindi i cicli non sono una novità, esistono da migliaia di anni comunque................................................................... Ecco un paio di esempi che incoraggerei tutti a studiare velocemente Il primo è qualcosa di completamente separato dai mercati: il COVID. Il grafico è del tutto autoesplicativo, i governi devono saperlo e tuttavia "vengono colti alla sprovvista" {immagine} Questo è un ciclo ripetuto nell'SP500 e nel DJIA da almeno 100 anni! Lo screenshot del grafico è stato fatto nel 2019: tutto quello che devi fare è aggiungere 4 anni e cercare OTTOBRE. Larry Williams lo ha scoperto decenni fa e di solito tocca il fondo intorno a OTTOBRE ogni 4 anni. Nel 2018 si è invertito diventando un MASSIMO o è arrivato con 2 mesi di ritardo, tuttavia, vuoi classificarlo {immagine}. Quindi guardi e aspetti e se le cose girano come previsto dal ciclo, puoi trarne vantaggio, tuttavia, scegli di farlo. In questo modo hai anche una possibile previsione sulla direzione del trend, ecc. Visto che stiamo cercando di catturare i trend. Nel 2019, avevo ottobre 2022 sui miei grafici per la ripetizione successiva e guarda cosa ha fatto l'SP500 in quel mese. --------------------------------------------------------------- HI. Cycles are a representation of prices based on the time factor. I find them extremely interesting but I don't understand one thing from your posts: you are talking about historical cycles on which it is not easy to trade. How do you calculate the duration of the cycles? there are monthly, semi-annual and annual cycles which, if I'm not mistaken, you don't talk about. and how do you represent them on graphs? I'm really interested in the topic.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
Some of the cycles will always hit and miss - it's the nature of the beast Yeah I'm 49 and I sat down and worked out which cycles I might see and which I most likely won't - something to pass down to the kids and their children when they have them If they'd of been looking to do that, they'd of simply let it rip through everyone - they protected you and all - most colds we have now are old pandemic viruses! just milder versions Sharepad - its not perfect, you can't scan intra-day, you have to flick through a list - but its organised and suits my style - it's mainly for fundamentals as you can run every type of financial data filter you can think of, then there's the charting side which is good but limited, especially for cycle work, but you can export the price data out into excel and then import that into other charting software etc - bit of a faff, but I make it work I just find its easier to flick through every chart in my portfolio and eyeball everything - most of the time only a few picture perfect prospects pop up Keep those levels on the SP500 - be Interesting what happens going forward to see how they contain price

... Ignored Hi EOD, Good question - The cycles REPEAT, especially the static cycles, I have a separate page on my charting software to mark the cycles down, simply as vertical lines - I also have other software that calculates cycles automatically and repeats the sequence on the price chart, if you look at the 4 year static cycle I just posted above, that is a simple 4 year repeating static cycle, the reason the chart does not show 2022 and onwards is because I took that screen shot in 2019 and haven't bothered taking another screen shot - it also adds a fair bit of predicting the future by posting about it years before the next cycle date Yeah you definitely cannot trade historical cycles or prices - you need to follow the cycle to its next hit/occurrence, which I let people work that out for themselves The cycle durations are from a lot of hard work and time isolating specific cycles - I'll never show the time periods of those - some are planetary too, those will NOT be static cycles, because the nature of the planets is that they do cycle around the sun in a perfect circle, its an ellipse cycle, so some periods of time a planet will be moving fast, then slow etc If you take the 4th Jan 2022 date - which was the high in the SP500 at the time, the EARTH was at its FASTEST point in its cycle around the sun - which was a nice coincidence, but other timing caused the top I've simply stopped taking screen shots - I might restart, but I cannot reveal the full details of certain cycles I will give you this one for free - This is a chart of CORN - The time Cycle is the planet URANUS - which divides harmonically - the HIGH to HIGH cycles are 120 degrees apart, so are the LOW to LOW cycles RED lines the other cycle line showing the 1/12th cycle which is 30 degrees of the Uranus cycle, shows a UP/DOWN sequence Attached Image (click to enlarge) If you have ever read Gann or Michael Jenkins - they both refer to dividing the circle by 2 or 3 to get the harmonics - What they were really saying is divide 360 degrees by the harmonics of 2 or 3 to find what a market is working out to - sometimes as with CORN its very very very clear, other markets its hard to find anything Look the markets are doing weird and wonderful things on the big stage - its nice to know timing, but its not crucial to trading - to Investing yes They are BUILDING GEOMETRIC STRUCTURES over the years - this is why Fibonacci shows up often, but the other key building block ratios of the Cube and Square are also present - the SP500 Index did not suddenly stop dead on 57.7% as a % fall from the 2007 high for no reason whatsoever Anyway, for the DJIA it recently did this weird thing of using the 2009 low PRICE dividing by the Fibonacci ratio and it converting into a TIME CYCLE! Do the same calculation but use the next major Fib ratio which is 1.382 and see where that date comes out to!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I showed a composite index 4 year cycle of NATURAL GAS Well here is the MONTHLY chart as I have it marked out - Pretty soon that trend is going UP I've enjoyed a ride up in the first wave (out with a trailing stop) and now I m waiting for the lower time-frames to show bullishness and I'll buy again for a buy and hold in my pension fund If it follows its previous moves, it should go up for 2 years then collapse - obviously there will be pullbacks of a half decent nature en-route PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #408 ---
------------------------------------- First of all, thank you for sharing some of your knowledge. so you mean to tell me that I have to look for the cycles by sight, looking at the past? and trade like this? I don't have complete information to have an opinion. but I'm happy if you can make gains this way.

--- 帖子 #409 ---
Hi No worries happy to No I think you're misunderstanding something, let me try to clarify as I probably haven't explained it very well You have to find the cycle in the first place - the same cycles don't repeat on all markets at the same time - it would be fantastic is that happened, but it doesn't - Jim Hurst published a table of "average" cycles that he found when looking at 1000 markets - some of them are a good starting place, but again they will not isolate for every market Just like you and I have different personalities, so do markets and this then spills down to what if any cycles they are working out to - on a deeper level, each market is working out to some geometric structure and that structure forces price action and time cycles, so you need to try to discover what is happening, which is a lot of work - you don't need to do this though - this is why on every market you will find fibonacci ratios, ratios of the square, cube etc and often see harmonic patterns such as the gartley, butterfly etc - the market is working through geometric growth/decline etc Once you find a cycle it is very highly likely to repeat and repeat and repeat BUT, it will also be influenced by larger cycles and sometimes those bigger cycles will override your cycle - nothing is 100% But lets say you find a 100 day cycle that has repeated nicely for say 5 years, the chances of it working on its next occurrence are very high - you don't trade it blindly, you wait for price to act as its following the cycle etc Also if the big cycle is in a downtrend and the smaller cycle is expected to uptrend, then the price action might not pronounced due to the big cycle effect If you take that CORN chart I posted - you have over 100 years of price action backing up the cycles - its pretty nailed on that 2027 will be a high, we are currently at lows within the 7 year cycle - mid cycle - you can profit on the upside and in 2027 when it peaks you can short it for 7 years down into the next cycle low - this is pretty much as guaranteed as you'll ever get in the markets - you have a ultra high probability cycle provable for over 100 years, it was an absolute no brainer to go long in 2020 and a trader could just trade that 1 market and make an absolute killing if they positioned themselves correctly you cannot just come along and say right I'll try a 100 day cycle from this point and expect it to work - you have use past price data to see if a cycle is active - which is a lot of work back testing This is GBPUSD on a WEEKLY TF - I've marked off the major lows - guess what, there's a pattern there, we have a cycle window of 404-435 WEEKS between lows, there should be some type of low 404-435 WEEKS after the last date on that chart, that you can trade in the weeks and months after to the upside The other thing to note is that preceding the cycle dates there's some pretty fierce plunges down - which may or may not happen into the next occurrence Then you would test other low to low cycles, high to high cycles etc to narrow down any other cycles - or you buy software to extract the cycles Attached Image (click to enlarge) Like I said above, you don't blindly trade the cycle dates, you wait for price action to confirm the cycle high or low and then trade in the direction of the expected cycle trend - the cycles just add an extra layer of expectation, you don't need the cycles, if you trade with the trend you are likely to trade along with the cycle anyway - I just like to know if there's any kind of cycle present, because I know 95% of other traders out there won't be looking at them, let alone know about them Hope I've clarified better - if not I'm happy to try to explain further

--- 帖子 #411 ---
If you find a REPEATING cycle pattern, it provides you with a "HEADS UP" of a trend reversal AND trading opportunities I'm only showing the general picture - to take this further you need to develop a plan of action etc But if you trade in the direction of the trend which is being FORCED to move by the cycle - then it is the path of least resistance I tend to focus on the longer term, because I am a lazy person and i prefer plenty of "thinking time" rather than being forced to make quick fast decisions The price of your favourite chocolate is going to rise over the next few years - along with most commodities - be prepared to pay more or give it up! Crude Oil - should be a 4 year cycle low this year and then rise, how much? We don't know, but if it rises, it WILL force a bullish trend on the lower time frames that will be tradable - The cycle might NOT happen, but at least you are AWARE of the potential, compared to average Joe Trader Attached Image (click to enlarge) Something completely different - Who buys clothes or linen? COTTON - another 4 year low to low cycle! Attached Image (click to enlarge) So how do we trade these cycles? Well remember IF we are right on the cycle, the trend should turn bullish You can trade the WEEKLY time-frame if you wish Attached Image (click to enlarge) Or you can trade both the WEEKLY &amp; the DIALY etc or just the DAILY Attached Image (click to enlarge) As you can see the TREND changed to what we were EXPECTING and then we can formulate a trading method/plan to exploit it - HOWEVER you wish I've showed you one of my Indicator methods on the WEEKLY TF - to prove to you that it works and you can definitely trade Indicators in &amp; under the right conditions/ circumstances Notice the 13RSI position on the 2RSI pullbacks - when markets are trending it will hover around those % levels, so you can use it to confirm the trend too

Anyone affected by Interest rates? In 2020 the long term trend turned UP from down - the days of 0% Interest are long gone now 1980 to 2020 is the High to Low cycle - all you do, it spin it now, so we 2020 + 40 years as the Low to High cycle and you can work out when Int rates will go DOUBLE DIGIT - make sure you do not have any debt then! You get the picture of how to use this - and if Int rates are rising then it means bond prices are falling and as bond prices have a maturity date on them that pays out at par £100 per bond, you can pick them up for bargain prices for a nice capital gain if bonds are your thing - obviously you'll need to time the purchase for optimum return, but I'm sure you understand the objective Attached Image (click to enlarge) PS - Central Banks DO NOT set Interest rates - Central Banks are FORCED to set rates that the bond MARKETS have set - the bond markets MOVE first, then a couple/few months later central banks are FORCED to follow suit - GOVTS are the ULTIMATE LAGGING INDICATOR Here's the 3 month T-Bond note: Moved first, FED FOLLOWS Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here's a Brucie Bonus (UK traders will understand) This is the UK base rate since 1900 Notice the 1929-1951 period (which includes a world war) and the period from 2000-2020 Well that PERIOD REPEATED on a planetary cycle Its WHY the economy stumbled in BOTH periods AND its why Interest HAD to come down to ultra low levels You can prove this concept to yourself quite easily - If you get a chart of the DJIA from 1929-1932 and compare it to the NASDAQ100 from 2000-2003 you will see that they are very very similar - because of the planetary cycle it repeated on an exact like for like and that is what forces the price patterns to look similar - I know its crazy and hard to believe, but we do not live in a world that most people think we live in! Attached Image (click to enlarge) Take all these far right actions by groups around the world - coincidence? It might be but its approx 100 years since the Nazi movement started in the 1920's! 100 year cycle again WD Gann refused to mention the planets interfering with markets, he hid behind the term "The Law of Vibration" but he meant planets - google "Ganns 1954 Coffee santos letter" Again you do not need to know anything about planets to make money - I just like to know what the hell is going on, if it has the potential to affect my life and I've pretty much figured out the basics I'm pretty conscious of taking the thread in a different direction, that is not the intention, some of these things need to be explained because they are all related - but if we can TIME big turns, it FORCES TRENDS to change/start, that we can exploit for financial gain to our advantage I've spent the past 14 years delving into all this, I left it last in my research, focusing on Elliott Wave and the like! whereas I should of concentrated on it from the start, but I didn't believe all that WD Gann planetary hocus pocus stuff! Anyway I am meant to be on holidays and I am taking most of August off, so I might be on here that much for the rest of the month - Here's a little task for you: Get a stock market charting universe of 20+ stocks Turn the time-frame to MONTHLY and have price data going back 20 years or more Then flick through EACH stock looking for PROMINANT LOWS (like on the Cotton chart etc) Take a rough time measurement If you get a a regular interval of say 3/4/5 years etc then put that stock on a watchlist If you do not get regular intervals - move on from that stock/market Now on your watch/prospect list move down to the WEEKLY chart and note the L-L expectation for the YEAR its due Then you WAIT for the year to arrive and keep watching WEEKLY TF for BULLISH price action Then when that happens you are on high alert for trading opportunities on the weekly or daily TF's - your choice Use NATURAL GAS as a template - lows were expected FEB 2024, price rose as expected, its now pulling back hard which should force another low on the weekly TF, from there it should form bullish price confirmations etc - that is when we get interested about getting back in (I was in that market, trailed a stop up and got stopped out for a decent profit - just waiting for it to turn back up and I will be back in) Its Important to remember that the market will give you what it wants to give you - you cannot expect a mega trending run, it might or might not happen - more often that not, it does, but sometimes it can be lacklustre!

Yeah its good - Its built more for the fuzzymentalist than the charting trader but I keep asking them to develop it - I'm a lone voice so they will not rush to do unless its easy I keep looking at Trading view but there's limitations there too as to how I would use it will keep posting as time progresses

Talking of BARCHART - Forgot to add this to the COTTON comment The COMMERCIALS [RED LINE] are NET LONG Cotton - this is not their normal position (they are normally short as they hedge prices) and it is often a very big pre-cursor to price rises in the months ahead and as we are expecting a LOW in price that turns into a bullish trend - this is one giant hell of a signal Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Ahh hate it when this happens Had to cut this one short as I have to leave the house for a few hours and the trade triggered!

Here's a live short - this one is a PICTURE PERFECT - ROSS HOOK - No cycles involved just price action If you are not familiar with, worth reading up on - Ross Hooks only show up in a TREND - I call them Gann pullbacks, because Gann wrote about them over a century ago This is the first time I've mentioned Ross Hooks - The Swing File identified this one - but the KEY to this is the STEEPNESS of the 10 SMA - we simple follow the momentum and when we get a decent angle on the SMA, it usually produces a Ross Hook Green Line = Entry Red Line = Initial Stop Pink Line = Trailing Stop Attached Image (click to enlarge) The aim is to WIN &amp; make MONEY - We want to do that the easiest way possible to suit our personalities and style - this is just mine, it might not suit you

So here is my robot which takes break back trades on yesterdays high/low. When it goes beyond yesterday high or low and then pass back into the frame, the trade is taken. But if yesterday high or Low happened at the end of day, then there will be way to many false signals, because the price ripples around the High or Low. This does not work and I don't believe in the strategy. So I have free hands right now. Does anyone have a strategy which is suitable for a robot? This means that the signals are so obvious and sharp, that the human brain is not necessary in order to decide that there is a trade setup. The robot will facilitate to trade in only one direction (the trend).

Here's a quick tutorial on Ross Hooks and 123's - SUPER SUPER easy Chart marked below - IGNORE the Indicators, they have NOT been used - PURE PRICE ACTION Go through the chart - some 123's and RH's are better than others, try to figure out why - This is also a 24 hour market, you might have been asleep or with your family when some of them triggered, I'm just showing you the trading method with 123's &amp; RH's you are a breakout trader - I have underlined picture perfect RH's on the left of the chart only - if you just trade the same market then you will undoubtedly be forced into poor 123's/RH trades - this is why I search for picture perfect trades, it reduces the risk of poor trades It all starts with a 123 swing - if it starts to trend you will find RH's (which are mini 123's) form in that trend - you can if you like trade the 123 swing Like everything in trader if you trade every turn it will hurt you - try to work out optimal trades - notice how the RH's are perfectly contained by strong SMA angle steepness and the SMA's themselves - like I say PICTURE PERFECT set-ups are everywhere, you just have to sniff them out Attached Image (click to enlarge) Here's a UK stock - DAILY time-frame - to prove its a valid concept, works on WEEKLY too! See the 1st RH on the chart? - using the trailing stop method I got taken out of that trade in MARCH 2024 See the bottom swing lows in FEB/MAR - look at the swing line that caused the 123 bull run - the swing line looks like "tweezers", another one happened just prior to the 1st 123 labelled on the chart but it had a lower low - when they happen that sharply, they usually retrace well past the swing high of the formation, which is another trading method in itself you could explore I've not labelled the big 123 sell in May that the swing file formed to avoid cluttering the chart even further Attached Image (click to enlarge) PS a good TRAILING stop is the 20 SMA! As well as the swing pivot points How stupidly simple is this method - a 5 year could it and as I have the mentality of a 5 year old, it is perfect for me! With trading ALL you have to do is have a NET profit of 2.3% per WEEK and over a trading year of 44 weeks and you double an account - do you think you could trade 123's and RH's on forex markets are extract 2.3% a week from them? I know you can if you apply it correctly anyways you get the picture - we are looking for the easiest of the easiest pickings - do it right and you will win at this game Back in the 1940's a great trader published a book which contained this image in it - This is George Bayers Egg of Columbus: The P's and S's are rude words! But you can see the pattern in all 3 charts Attached Image (click to enlarge)

I need the exact rules. The robot does not have my eyes. Rules are something about what value of the indicators are necessary? Is there some timing in it? etc. When you have those rules, then try and go back some charts and check if you really would have followed the rules in the situations and was the result then ok? Not that all trades are winners - I know. If you can define exact rules, then I will look at it to see if I can code it.

Maybe you or other developers can take a quick look at the Golden-Cross Trading-Idea, or forget it if you find it uninteresting, no problem. ( https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...s-trading-idea ).

Totally agree - There are gazillions of different ways to trade the markets - not all will suit your personality and what not - or work, its a case of learning as much as you want to and testing methods to see if they suit you, which obviously involves a huge amount of time Once you find a method or methods that gel with you - its a case of repeat, repeat, repeat and exploit

Hi SwingMan I did take a short look at the Golden Cross Idea some time ago. Left it quickly - I don't remember why, I guess I have been busy with my own stuff. But you have been very energized about it, so let me take a pick on it once more. EDIT: Have read the first pages and I find that you hide stuff from people in order to reveal it in your tempo - if ever. Sorry not the way I want to play.

This has to be one of the easiest money making methods out there - it sets itself up, if it ain't clear DON'T attempt to take a trade One of my friends traded this - I shut up shop after 4.30 pm UK time Ross Hook - Trailing stop 20 SMA - 15 min chart SP500 Price action steep decline, forces the 10 SMA to be steep angle, as you can see price struggles to regain the 10SMA until the trend is over Attached Image (click to enlarge) This charts shows GBPUSD this week Same story/picture - steep price decline forces steep 10 SMA = PICTURE PERFECT set-ups Not shown but you can picture this, as the trend continues you can draw a trendline along the 10SMA to gauge its angle Look for the 123 to start things off - Remember the "Tweezers" too - on this chart the BLUE RH's are picture perfect / the PINK sort of worked and the ORANGE worked but originated from wider bars - I skipped the orange trade The PINK trade wasn't that great BECAUSE of the deepness of the pullback to the SMA's - This turned into my 2RSI @ the SMA's trade which returned better profit than the RH would have given had I taken the RH Attached Image (click to enlarge) If price is motoring steeply its because some unknown force is behind it and you will get 1,2 or 3 bar pull backs with the trend before it resumes - don't gamble on the less than perfect set-ups - I can guarantee you, there's always a picture perfect set-up on some time-frame and some market out there Risking say £250 per picture perfect set-up can provide an incredible income each month That's your basic tuition on the 123 &amp; Ross Hook - trades the trend and is super easy to understand If the angle of the SMA's is NOT steep, then the trailing 20SMA is not as good as it is for the steep angled moves, so you would need to think about trailing stop placement, the obvious are swing high/low pivot points or trailing using some sort of % of Average True Range If you decide to use it - all the best to you I might start a thread on it or continue one of the old ones on here from years ago - I'll have a think over my holiday as I'm not enthused about starting a thread

Ok - So just revisiting CYCLES - because when you find a stock, commodity or forex market that shows the following - you can BUILD a CYCLE from it and once you have done that it will provide you with the ability to PREDICT next turns etc Now this market is completely new - I have not traded it - but we'll use it as an example (Its impossible for me to do this with every stock in the UK) so that you can see just how easy this is It has taken me more time writing this post than it took to find the cycles! So we start with the HIGHER time-frame - WEEKLY For this example I'm only interested in the swing high pivots - they look to have a pattern - there is the bigger up trend then down trend then up trend, that you could explore if using this more precisely, but that is where the time increases researching There looks to be a 3 month high to high pattern in this market - not EXACTLY 3 months, there's ALWAYS leeway Attached Image (click to enlarge) I've marked out with the X the approx 3 mthly periods and we see that there or there abouts we had some sort of high/top that you could have exploited some how Attached Image (click to enlarge)

HI. thanks for sharing. all really interesting. If you open a new discussion I will be there

Please do not continuing delete posts from this thread. It is a strange way to behave. You are not able to understand how a robot works. And how could you. We all have our things that we are good at, and thanks to haven we are diversed. We are good at different things. So it understandable when the majority of people does not know how a robot works. So a robot cannot ever use your strategy, because the robot does not have eyes and neither a brain. It cannot think. It can only follow the instructions given by the programmer. Instructions like this; if RSI is over 50 then buy . But you cannot ask the robot to look left for problems. It must be defined how far left and how does problems look like. Is it long wicks or ranging behavior or one of the other hundreds of problems that the human brain and eye easily observe?

--- 帖子 #440 ---
Thanks,looks like some form guppy? one thing that it has helped me to improve on is the discipline to not enter every trade. it helps define trend for me (rsi/ma cross median and daily open) so if price is not on the side of rsi median crossover and supported by daily open, i hold on and wait for when they allign to look for trade,like gold this morrning on m5,below daily open but rsi still above median so i sit on my hand.same on m1

--- 帖子 #441 ---
On viewing your chart As a general Rule I only sell Below the Daily Open Buy Above The Daily Open (Exception when the ADR as moved up / down to near extremes) By waiting for 23.5% to be passed by Price, to me shows intent to carry on further with the move Its up to you if you drop that % down a little but I have put it in to try and filter out whipsaw moves

RiskFighter I have read and re read your page one post one Although your idea and indicator as been downloaded a vast number of times I think the idea maybe some what forgotten To me it is a rather clever way of quickly giving us the opportunity to see Multi views of our potential trade This can be used to see multi time frame views of one pair or indeed multi pairs Which I think is very very important in trading That being said I am my own man doing things my own way with my own money Admittedly in a very similar manner Now if I had your skills I would be doing ( all the things you have said you have no interest in doing ) Here is the kicker, you are wrapped up in making Robots my strange view is Yes you are correct A Robot is predictable , it does what you have told it to But it still lags AS WE STILL HAVE AN EDGE A I Which lets us solve any changes or conditions we spot very quickly PS None of my thoughts ideas or trading would work without having quick and easy access to multi chart viewa Thank you

For the time being I have problems in chosing the right instrument to trade. They are ranging for hours. I need to make some table that shows when a pair begins to trend. I might use the WPR indicator with a low periode number. Then let the table scan all the instruments every minute. If somebody have better ideas for some indicator to use for this purpose I gladly hear about it. I will make a tool and share it here in this thread.

I know you will not admit it but Your problem is the Fear of Losing You need to work out a good money-management to action when you have a loser which we all have at times Start with a fixed R/R You mention The Grail In the Tread Title which we all know is a bit of a myth

--- 帖子 #458 ---
you don't need "RIGHT AT THIS MOMENT" to catch a trend, when trend start it stay for day's and week's. so, think swing for true trend then daytrade. breakout system/method: BB, for downtrend start it should break bottom band, for uptrend start it should break upper band. Dow(HHHL-LLLH), for downtrend start it should break last HL, for uptrend start it should break last LH. Attached Image (click to enlarge) cheers,

Dave - tsk tsk. You are talking to RiskFighter and you tell me that I need to learn Risk Management. I am an educated Risk Manager. Was the first person in my country to take the education Manager of Risks (M_o_R). Look up that education. I was a pioneer in the 90's in Risk Management. I have the education "Project Risk Management" and have been working as a Project RIsk Manager on large scale projects (10 digits). Have practised risk management on a daily basis in my job for 35 years. Not for the fun, but because it works. In trading I have many layers of Risk management. My robots allways have risk management functions. This is all automated. The robot handle it and I don't need to think about it. Find the right place for the SL (automated). Using math to calculate the lots necessary to lose only an exact amount of money (Percent of your equity). Find the TP by a factor of the risk. (RR). Fully automated. Automated set the SL according to the calculation. But my robots have 2 versions. 1) The SL is a firm point and 2) SL is by the end of the bar (invisible) - this helps avoding the wicks that often take your SL. Next layer. I have a robot that secure, that I can only lose x % on a trading day, then it stops everything. Exits all trades and don't trade anymore that day. Next layer. I have more accounts. Trading not all accounts at the same day. So a bad day hits only the accounts that I traded, not the paused accounts. Next layer. When trading Prop accounts, allways have some new accounts ready for passing the challenge in the next single trade. So if you blow an account, that does not matter, the next account is ready. I Have more risk layers than these. Don't tell me, that I now nothing about risk management. The Grail. I stand with my believe. The grail is not the strategy that you use. It is the knowledge about finding the next trade. What you chose to call it is your choice, but people tends to call an edge like this for a grail. The problem is, when I chose to trade a pair which is trending, and then it goes directly into a range. Then I need to find another pair to trade.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Yes, Dow Jones showed in the 30ties, that timeframes is fractal. But you say that I am right: BB, for downtrend start it should break bottom band, for uptrend start it should break upper band. Dow(HHHL-LLLH), for downtrend start it should break last HL, for uptrend start it should break last LH. That is the starting point of the tool I want to make. I could show in a table all the pairs where price have broken the BB.

Haha You are talking to a seasoned Gambler on all things with 4 legs to the point of an Official Tax Inspection I bet I have created as many Methods/Systems and Recovery actions as you have done Risk management exercises 2 different things my friend To me my Risk is simple If price crosses the fixed stop line before the winning line you have lost no keep moving the lines

You are right. But this is what people call top down analyzes. If you have a trend at D and H4, then the trend at LTF is more trustworthy - I believe. And I top it with a lot of other stuff. But in this very moment I put a robot on 25 pairs at M5 - Demo of cause for the experiance. And M5 does not care about Daily and H4.

You might mean the indicator that draws the many ants in the chart... It's a completely new idea, namely scalping or trading in the direction of the trend, only on the bars with small wicks! In a chart, you can easily calculate statistically that if the two MAs, for example agree long, most of the bars are green (66%) and with a 1/2ATR entry above the low you can make profits very easily. It is possible to scalp only 1/2ATR or to stay in the trend for a while. It is important to use a filter, and the slope oscillator is very suitable for this. One can also trade daily charts quite easily manually, otherwise one can of course use an EA.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
It also seems to repaint every time one changes the defeault moving average period settings

--- 帖子 #531 ---
The buffer numbering starts with 0, try 0 and 4. Post again if you have any comments. There are always problems with repainting, but you should document them if you notice them. The indicator was programmed as a continuation of an older idea, was not intended for publication, so I have to develop it further.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
As I understand it, the entry and sometime the exit is done on the active bar. This means that the bar is under composing and will vary. This is not repainting. Once the bar has ended, then there is no changing in the bar and no repaint.

--- 帖子 #533 ---
It also seems to repaint every time one changes the defeault moving average period settings. I am not sure if I understand you correct - but if you change the conditions for an indicator, then the result will change - that is not repainting. Repainting is if the result is changing on closed bars while the indicator is running and without any invention.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Sure it is. For a long entry, the distance is calculated from the bar low, and the exit from the entry. If the low changes, these values will change too. The first condition is that (1) the entry is above the open. Everything should be calculated and plotted only (2) if the MA directions match, and (3) the slope direction too. (Note for @OAPDave , setting the parameters for the slope is more sensitive with 5/1 and not 5/2).

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) My settings for the moving averages are 2 and 3, the idea is to make the signals close so that one can trade from buy to sell and visceversa, if this can be done this indicator would be no that far from a holy grail, just check the signals even when they repaint they are not too bad

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Hi Swingman Your Indicators are good, in fact dam good Thank you Dave

--- 帖子 #537 ---
OK. So for a Long trade it is when Close[0] - Open[0] &gt; 0,5 * ATR. Make the Entry. TP = Entry + 0,5 * ATR (or let it run). SL = Entry - 0,5 * ATR. And of cause the filters shall be positive. And especially the slope is important. I have never seen the Slope indicator. It must be handy for most robots. I will make the robot for a test now.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
@SwingMan Like this?? ATR = iATR(NULL, 0, 14, 1); LongEnter = iOpen(NULL, 0, 0) + ATR / 2; ShortEnter = iOpen(NULL, 0, 0) - ATR / 2; LongExit = iOpen(NULL, 0, 0) + ATR; ShortExit = iOpen(NULL, 0, 0) - ATR / 2; LongSL = iOpen(NULL, 0, 0) - ATR / 2; ShortSL = iOpen(NULL, 0, 0) + ATR / 2; if(Close[0] &gt;= LongEnter) {Signal = 1;} if(Close[0] &lt;= ShortEnter) {Signal = -1;}

The low of the bar is: iOpen(NULL, 0, 0) Entry after 1/2 ATR is: iOpen(NULL, 0, 0) + ATR / 2; Exit after entry + 1/2 ATR = Low + 1*ATR is: iOpen(NULL, 0, 0) + ATR; Sorry that is what I understand. Enlighten me please. I am leaving now to buy my wife an Icecream at the beach?

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Is OK. Before you have programmed something, there is little point in describing everything here. An example is the ATR, which is used by everyone. I found an alternative by chance and posted the indicator here. https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...2#post14340482 It has been downloaded over 600 times and nobody uses it... The blue line is the ATR, and you can see that in many zones there are larger values and that is disadvantagiously for trading.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
Please take a look a this post https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...9#post14975119 look at the repainting with the settings 2 and 3 for moving averages, the default setting does not repaint, I am trying to trade with it from buy to sell and viceversa so having a tighter moving average setting is more adequate, however, it keeps on repainting and signals overlap.

You are a goldmine. Look forward to investigate that ATR! Thank you for your hugh effort on FF.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
hmm. I can see what you mean. That should not be the case! The only explanation I can think of is, if one of the indicators are repainting.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
You can't get any explanations from me. --I can't see the charts with dark bars on a black background. - There are too many bars to see where the problem is. - The M1 timeframe seems to be too small. You should learn to trade such scalping systems on H4 or H1 before M1. Have you done that? - What indicator is it? - For which MAs are you changing the period? - Why do you want to switch from long to short trading? Perhaps the indicator has a specific algorithm that you don't know. Before making such suggestions, you should test them first and then suggest changes. - How do you determine repainting on Saturday when there are no live prices?

--- 帖子 #550 ---
I will trade this particular system on the 30 min or 1hr, but I was trying to see the repainting signals more clearly on the 1min, I have live prices 24/7 with cryptos on the broker I am with, afterprime, maybe you can see the signals dissapearing/overlapping with the white background, I drew a square over them, I want to know if it´s possible to make it non repaint.

The function for the BarRange that I generally use is this. For an EA you have to adapt it. The ATR calculation is completely omitted, and in the chart where ATR and ADR are drawn, you can see that the values are generally larger (less advantageous for entries). Inserted Code ////+------------------------------------------------------------------+ ////| | ////+------------------------------------------------------------------+ void Get_BarRange() { //######################################################### ////-- Input parameters for Bar range calculation in "SmallWick Signals" //int ATR_Period = 14; //int Average_Highs_Period = 10; //int Average_Lows_Period = 8; //int Average_Shift = 1; //ENUM_MA_METHOD Average_Method = MODE_SMA; //int Smoothing_Period = 14; //######################################################### int ii; double BarRangeX = 0; int limitX = limit; //int limitX = 2 * ATR_Period; for(ii = 0; ii &lt; limitX &amp;&amp; !IsStopped(); ii++) { //ATR_Buffer[ii] = iATR(Symbol(),thisTimeFrame,ATR_Period,ii + 1); //--- avgHighs[ii] = iMA(Symbol(),thisTimeFrame,Average_Highs_Period,Average_Shift,Average_Method,PRICE_HIGH,ii); avgLows[ii] = iMA(Symbol(),thisTimeFrame,Average_Lows_Period,Average_Shift,Average_Method,PRICE_LOW,ii); channelHilo[ii] = avgHighs[ii] - avgLows[ii]; } for(ii = limitX; ii &gt;= 0; ii--) Channel_Median[ii] = iMAOnArray(channelHilo,0,Smoothing_Period,0,MODE_SMA,ii); for(ii = limitX; ii &gt;= 0; ii--) Channel_Buffer[ii] = MathMin(channelHilo[ii],Channel_Median[ii]); //for(ii = limitX; ii &gt;= 0; ii--) // { // OffsetValue_Buffer[ii] = MathMin(ATR_Buffer[ii],Channel_Buffer[ii]) * Entry_RangeFactor; // } }

- Now it's easier to see what you've determined. Please use the MT4 function when posting, because the screenshot is always unclear to me. In general, this is a thread for exchanging ideas and not for editing suggestions.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Dear @RiskFighter, please excuse me for taking up too much space with the answer to @lain7123. Actually, young people should learn to give themselves the answers... - I think I now know what your "repainting" finding means. If you've read, for long trades a signal is drawn from the low and above the open (that's a small wick trading). If the low becomes lower, the signal should disappear. If the program doesn't do this correctly, please let me know and I'll have to correct it. - Regarding the timeframes: it seems that you're young and ambitious, and believe that action also brings money... Not even @RiskFighter has made any comments here, very few from me, and you want to scalp quickly. For this trading idea, the first condition is that the spread is a maximum of 10-20% of the bar range, otherwise there is too little money. Generally for most currency pairs, this is fulfilled on H4, but gold can also be traded up to M15. - If you test with the MAs periods short/long of 2/3, then you have not understood the idea of the system, you have not thought about it. From buy to sell to trade would be wrong with the setting 5/30. You want a quick system and should try something else, there are already some M1 systems here in the forum. --------------------- - Here is a question for you and possibly other readers: there are two TPs drawn in the chart. You should take a profit on the first one, OK. How should you use the second TP, also considering that in a trend very often groups of bars have scalping signals? We also know from the "TradingMadeSimple" thread that an MA(5) trend lasts about 8 bars.

Hi Swingman, I have no time today for playing with the small wicks theory. But since you have seen so much - I am hunting the algoritm behind the Mika Breakout Indicator. I think this is the best indicator I have. But I cannot find anything about it anywhere. I have it from this thread: Mika's Breakout strategy | Forex Factory . Using a few supporting indicators and trading only with the trend, this is very good. However it is a very old indicator and that is why it does not refresh. (I use the AutoRefresh) for that. But I would of cause like to update the indicator, maybe make a new indicator on basis of the algorithm.

It looks a bit like the Donchian, but in the Donchian the price never cross the channel lines. And in the Mika, it does and this is when you should invest.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
The lines are related to AMA, but it is not an AMA, but a variant of an adaptive MA.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
I found it - it is a HalfTrend. With the amplitude = 1. Then the indicator is shifted in some way up and down to make a channel. I will have to investigate that. This is the Mika band wioth the HalfTrend in the middle.

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Great that you found it. I think it is one of @Mladen's versions, with the parameters (1,1)

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Oh yes! Nice. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
That's normal. @RiskFighter wrote that this is a thread for new ideas. Apparently all members are happy with their strategies and systems, so no one needs to exchange experiences or share new tests.

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Exactly. And I am not writing on a thread just to keep it going. If there is no use for it, then so be it. Right now I am studying this thread: Trading system using relative strength | Page 4 | Forex Factory They seem to have great results. I have made 2 batches today. The first was a loss and the second is in minus after 2 hours. So might not be working in todays vacation environment.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
I do know, that I shall play with the small wicks strategy and I have my own Halftrend strategy to develop too, but I can't help surfing this interesting FF site and then things happen. So I often have many projects going.

I works on the strength calculator where the gap, calculating the average gap of each current compared to other currencies. But the result in that strategy only use if the gap is long or short. Not how much long or short. Noted by jusst a plus or minus. That is very simple. Maybe too simple. Seems that a lot can be done. code snippets for the EUR currency. if(EUR) { double EURUSD_Fast = ma(sEURUSD, Fast, MA_Method, Price, i); double EURUSD_Slow = ma(sEURUSD, Slow, MA_Method, Price, i); if(!EURUSD_Fast || !EURUSD_Slow) break; } then if(EUR) { arrEUR[i] = 0; if(USD) arrEUR[i] += EURUSD_Fast / EURUSD_Slow - 1; if(GBP) arrEUR[i] += (EURUSD_Fast / GBPUSD_Fast) / (EURUSD_Slow/GBPUSD_Slow) - 1; if(AUD) arrEUR[i] += (EURUSD_Fast / AUDUSD_Fast) / (EURUSD_Slow/AUDUSD_Slow) - 1; if(NZD) arrEUR[i] += (EURUSD_Fast / NZDUSD_Fast) / (EURUSD_Slow/NZDUSD_Slow) - 1; if(CHF) arrEUR[i] += (EURUSD_Fast*USDCHF_Fast) / (EURUSD_Slow*USDCHF_Slow) - 1; if(CAD) arrEUR[i] += (EURUSD_Fast*USDCAD_Fast) / (EURUSD_Slow*USDCAD_Slow) - 1; if(JPY) arrEUR[i] += (EURUSD_Fast*USDJPY_Fast) / (EURUSD_Slow*USDJPY_Slow) - 1; }// end if EUR

That's normal. If you don't use my indicators, you can't make any profits... If I have not misunderstood, if you're interested in relative strength, you can find some of my strength indicators here: https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...-level-trading .

Exiting. I recently made a robot for the Udine thread. But it was a left hand work and I did not get it to work properly. So I will study the work you have done with great interest.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
From time to time you can write what you are trading (entry, TP, SL, result). This is the only way I can comment.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Very nice! I think that today you are the only one who has heard of Yotov. Maybe you can use his original theory, analyze it in the thread, and comment on what can be used in common with the last indicators.

--- 帖子 #571 ---
There are SmallWick signals for D1 and the slope indicator is also short (on 23, 24, 25 July and 1, 2, 3 August). One can wait for the entry on D1 and make the trades on H1 or M15. I don't know how to use the octaves and quarters right now and I think the GC and SW ideas are sufficient. The GC Stochastic is also useful.

--- 帖子 #572 ---
I laid the final hand on a project today. So in the weekend I will take up the Small Wicks project. Weekends are not ideal for coding because of servers are not functioning all the time, but I can start it up. So sometime tuesday or wednesday I guess I will have the first shot.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
So glad to here that Will my Robot be arriving via UPS, Fed Ex, Amazon or even other means ?

--- 帖子 #574 ---
That is a problem, but you could start by reading the PM I sent you.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Thanks for the reply I am very happy just being a manual trader keep anything that I have contributed as a Gift

--- 帖子 #576 ---
I used some hours on the SmallWick strategy, but did not get close to anything and in parallel I planned a personnal race trading. So I have to put the SmallWick aside for some time while I am concentrading on trading and only trading. But don't I have robots to do that - yes partly, but I need to be present and decide what to trade where, when and how. And I need to secure that robots are still following the trend. Then the robots does the work. Take the trades, make the exits and stop trading for the day, when daily goal is reached. I bought one more Prop account, so I will be trading 3 accounts. It will require my precense 100%.

This is nice indy, I just started to use it with TMA+CG Fast TT developed by Tankk, 15 min chart, works like charm, setting for TMA+CG Fast TT is 50.

So there have been a lot of talk on this thread that was out of the subject. Fine, I am happy when people are talking. But the purpose of this thread is to have a wise guess of the trend direction and which pairs are trending the most. If you can guess which way the pairs will trend - on beforehand, then any strategy will make you money. I like to trade a batch of the Forex pairs. But it is hard to analyze all 28 pairs, so this is a way to make a short cut and remove pairs that are not trending even before I begin my analysis. So this is my latest take. I measure the status on EMA20, EMA50 and EMA100. This robot will colour the background of the screen: Black if those MA's are not lining in a trend direction. Green if trend is Long. Blue if trend is Long AND all 3 EMA's did go up compared to the day before. Pink if trend is Short. Maroon if trend is short AND all 3 EMA's did go down compared to the day before. The idea is to set timeframe on all pairs to daily. Then you can spot which pairs were trending the day before. All not trending pairs has no interest. If many pairs are trending, you can pick the best by chosing charts with colours blue or maroon. I have a Profile with all the pairs that I might be interesting in trading. That will be the 28 Forex pairs, but it could be anything. All charts that are black i close. And if there is a lot of trending, then I also close all pink and green charts. Then I am left with pairs that are trending and the EMA's on those pairs were rising or falling yesterday. NOW I can make a TopDown analyzing on those chosen pairs and select the ones I want to trade today. This was just a quick robot I made. I might improve. If you find the robot usefull, then leave a comment before downloading.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
This is todays situation on the Daily timeframe. I will investigate further the Darkblue and the Maroon instruments in a topdown analyze.

Hi RiskFighter, I like that handle as we should all be risk fighters. Do you consider the %R to be somewhat of a leading indicator? How has results been so far using the method as you described? Best of trades to you, my friend. _____________________________________________________________________

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Hello RiskFighter. Good job !

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Hello Ace %R is an excellent indicator. But I am not using it right now. I had a period where it did not give the expected benefit. But still fine as a confluence tool. You should visit the Squeeze strategy by Machine Learn. I am using that for now. Very interesting.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
Hi RiskFighter, Thank you for your response. I will take a look at the Squeeze strategy. Thak you.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
The batch setup right now. All blue and maroon coloured instruments has the three MA's aligned and the last value of each MA is trending. I use H4 as the batch is trading on M15. So at next H4 bar I will update the batch. I am forward testing 3 robots using this batch setup. Is this method any good? I don't know. Just testing. .

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Hi RiskFighter Thanks A very practical way to find trends.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Can you please remove the pink one and green one, letting only blue and maroon. I think this way will be easier to focus on the right pairs. Many thanks.

--- 帖子 #587 ---
I do just click the close down button on those. It takes only 15 seconds to close down 5 to 10 charts.

--- 帖子 #588 ---
This morning chasing the setup. 1st. screen is the CrystalBowl showing status on all the instruments that I trade. 2nd. screen is when I have closed the pink and the green charts. Now I know which pairs have the 3 MA's aligned at H4 and with the latest price in a still trending position. But from here you must make your normal analyzis. This is only a help to quickly remove obviously not trending instruments. 3rd. screen is a chart that I would not trade today even if the MA's are aligned at this very moment.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Here is another use. I trade the M15. Having this screen open I can in a glance see which pairs are not trending. Are you trading only pairs with EUR or GBP? Then the second screen is for you.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Very nice.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Nice trade on AUDCHF. Two timeframes aligned make trading easier. CrystalBall is great.

--- 帖子 #592 ---
I find the Crystal Bowl very usefull. Only thing is, it is a little time consuming because I like to see the status on the MA's on several timeframes. (Top/Down analysis). Then it´s nice to be a coder, because you can make anything you like. So, I have made this tool MultiTimeFrame. In one glance you get the statur on all timeframes from M1 to Daily. It is on test right now and I have smart ideas to incorporate, so the release will be sometime later. Subscribe to my profile, then you will get a notice when it is released. At this chart the MA's are aligned nicely upward on all the timeframes. All arrows are pointing up. Here is a lot of nice trades waiting on the lower timeframes.

--- 帖子 #593 ---
Another approach to find the best charts to trade. At the buttom you find the Pips29 indicator. It is four different CCI bars showing the direction of the trend. Then I added my Traffic Light. It is the EMA's 20, 50 and 100. They need to be nicely trending and in the process of separating even more. Now I close down the charts where the is a bad situation, leaving more room for the remaining charts. It reveals some more charts to close down. Gol is to end up with a screen of les than 10 charts which are trending nicely. I use timeframe 30, because it goes back 24 hours on the screen.

--- 帖子 #594 ---
This way I ended up with those 8 instruments to trade today. I needed to go down to M5 in order to find enough charts to clo

--- 帖子 #595 ---
Now set the Linegraf to a colour. I used the pink here. The linegraf shows the close of the bar. What do we have? The best trending instruments in one glance - AND the pullback and bounce to the EMA 20. What do we know happens now? Yes a trend continuation which has been fueled and can give some nice momentum. Then go down to M5 and trade the beast. Would anybody like to have an alarm when this happen? Maybe even on you phone so that you can do anything else when waiting for the setup?? Let me know. Only MT4. The best trading platform we have.

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Well, using this methode you find thos very trending pairs and they might even not bounce to the 20EMA for days. Then you can add a 5EMA or 10 EMA or whatever is needed to catch some bounces.

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Hi RF, Can you post template please? Regards Rob Ok, I have it

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Here you are. I will upload the Pips29 in a moment. - Done!

--- 帖子 #599 ---
we would be very happy (:

--- 帖子 #600 ---
OK, here it is. One Indi coming up. Gives an alarm on screen and on phone if you like. When I was in it, i thought I could just as well let it print alarm and send IPhone messages when a chosen level is broken. I have not tested the Level Alarm function, so don't trust it until you see it is working. And please let me know if it is not working. The EMA alarm is tested and it works like a charm.

wow.. you were quick ..ok.. we will test and report .. .. great thank you very much and .. have a wonderfull day
