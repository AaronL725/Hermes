A Simple System that you can Personalize: To anyone reading this thread This thread is not do be seen as advice on trading in anyway- it is to help give some ideas, I take no responsibility for anyone's trading. Winning or losing. If you trade this system, any trades you do take from info from this thread, you do it on your own responsibility. I take NO responsibility for any trades from anyone. IT IS IN NO WAY TO BE SEEN AS TRADE CALLS OR TRADE SIGNALS OR TRADE RECOMMENDATIONS . I would recommend you trade on Demo account until you feel you can take trades on your own responsibility. Do not trade with real money ever - until you can take your own responsibility for your trading. Never trade money you cannot afford to lose as odds are you will lose your money. 85% of all traders loss all or most of their money they trade with. So trading it is very risky BECAREFUL. Tools or Indicators or -Oscillators to be used on this thread Also I have seen thread after thread die on FF Because people add this and that and in a few week it’s not the same thread Only the follow tools can be used 5 &amp;12 EMAs and 20 RSI on our charts - No other tools - indicators and/or -oscillators . SDZ, Trend Lines and Support and Resistance Levels (SDL) are ok. And also Normal Candles - no RSI Candles or trading bars. Let’s all do the same thing and it’s easier to see and understand Anyone posting anything else will be banned - it’s the only way For the 20 RSI - Template - Please read post 8, 10, 11 &amp; 160 Tools: 20 RSI with 45, 50 and 55 levels shown - I normally put a red line at the 50 level EMAs - 5 and 12 closed Standard Candles - Momentum Candles (MC) Supply and Demand Zones (SDZ) Round Numbers (RN) Time Frames: Main Time Frame is the one hour - In a real strong trend I drill move down to 15 minutes chart. But only if I miss the trade on the hour - This is still really an hour trade Look for a good stop on Hour or the 15 Minutes Charts Must be a strong trend on the cover chart(s) - The Four hour &amp; Day show this with the 20 RSI on those time frame. Look for Targets on the 4 Hour &amp;/or Day Charts. (Sometimes weekly) Trading Chart - One Hour Trend and Target Charts - Four Hour and Day (Sometimes Weekly) Trigger charts - 15 Minutes (and Hour) The Secrets : 1. Is to get a good Reward to Risk Ratio (RRR) 2. To do this you have to have great - S.E.T. Rules: (Stop Loss &amp; Entry &amp; Target) 3. Its a great Trend &amp; Retracement System - not a Tops &amp; Bottoms System. You want to get the sweet spot in a trend. Entry: for a buy : (reverse for a sell) 1. 5 EMA breaks over 12 EMA - (Retracement) 2. Price breaks over or is over the 55 Level on the 20 RSI (Trend) 3. Trade is in line with Big Trend on the Four hour &amp; Day use the 20 RSI on these charts (Big Picture) 4. A good Target and good Stop Loss- so a good Risk to Reward Ratio (RRR) 5. A Candle Entry that is simple to see and understand (Entry)

subscribed. Looks very interesting, clean and simple. Going to play with on demo next week using 4 hour time frame. thanks for your work TEB63 I look at your FF journal frequently Keep up the good work!

--- 帖子 #3 ---
I have to say that taking a quick look at the charts, the system looks pretty awesome and interesting.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
4 hour will work- then look to the day and week for cover and the hour for secondary SL and entry good trading

--- 帖子 #5 ---
Love it, simple and yet effective. Yes , of course one will make less orders within a session but they will be much more profitable. I will try this the upcoming week

Can you upload the RSI histogram? thanks in advance!

--- 帖子 #9 ---
1st win - I took the

--- 帖子 #10 ---
its not a histogram it just the area taken out between the 45 and 55 - this is how Oanda does its RSI - I like it

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Here is the normal RSI with the 45 and 55 levels on them I have used this for years and years.

--- 帖子 #12 ---
TEB, maybe if you some day want to change the view or your charts. (perhaps the rsi slope helps . . . )

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Monday afternoon

--- 帖子 #14 ---
thanks - but I only use Oanda now and I am use to their old charts

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Dear TEB63 Maybe you can use the RSI chart bars All the best Dan

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Hi Guys thanks for all the great ideas they are likely really great but to be honest I have used these simple tools so long I think I have a 6th senses about them. have found the simpler the better in the Forex that is just me Some people really like a chart that looks more like art. I just never know what to do with that, To be honest - I use just the RSI The EMA SDZ Candles ( maybe trend lines) Round numbers and that is it really. cheers

What's a "Banker's Candles (BC)"?

--- 帖子 #20 ---
Hi Watching with interest Any particular pairs you focus on ?? Cheers

--- 帖子 #21 ---
I'll definitely give it a try on higher timeframes 4H and above How did you place T1 on your picture? Thanks

--- 帖子 #22 ---
with the hour charts these are the pairs I watch the Gold pairs are best or the safest The cooper pairs will make some very funny moves

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Its a bit crazy today for me. and I have lots on this account so I will likely post less today I hope it has been helpful. regards TEB

--- 帖子 #24 ---
SDZ= as to the Targets and Stop and RRR everyone will have to personals them as to how you want to do them.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Do you trade during news time or make adjustments (move sl etc)?

--- 帖子 #26 ---
if I am trading on the hour not so much. - with this system I really do not care about the news - I might watch NFP - and not trade that day. If an interest rate or national bank pres is speaking on a day esp the fed I might keep that in mind. most times news just lets me get in on a retest or has no effect. The day 20 RSI filters out most of the noise of the news.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Funny you say that, just observing setups the last 2 days, I have to say that you are spot on! Just wanted to hear it from someone with alot more experience. charts below: 4hour analysis and 15 min entry

--- 帖子 #28 ---
is this helpful everyone anyone see anything else?

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Is this another thread that will just die off?

--- 帖子 #30 ---
If I am the only one posting - or it gets crazy or I get bored likely !!! I just have some time this week so I thought I would be a little helpful cheers

--- 帖子 #31 ---
I hope not. I am following along with interest....

--- 帖子 #32 ---
And me.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Had some fun with this last night up 70pips on EJ will post pic when I'm home TEB do u have a minimal RR? ~Dustin

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Hi TEB63, Would you be so kind to share your RSI indicator with green colour on your chart and probably a template. Thanks in anticipation for your quick responses.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
Nice system Teb, thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
the thread is only 2 pages long........explaination of the template/rsi has already been provided in page 1........

--- 帖子 #37 ---
I hope it is helpful

--- 帖子 #38 ---
normal at least 3 to 1 RRR + a little

--- 帖子 #39 ---
Hello TEB63, Would like to know is this strategy advisable for Gold? Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #40 ---
You can for sure, having said that Forex is the best trending market in the world and so this system is better on forex. commodities and stocks are more about SDZ and Trend lines and less about Trend. so you can but likely not as good cheers

--- 帖子 #41 ---
two targets hit 3 to 1 RRR +

--- 帖子 #42 ---
one trade on - its an important point will we go up or break down - I think up

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Hi Teb, What is a bankers candle (from 1st post) "you can make lots between ( my time) 3-5 am &amp; 8-10 &amp; 4-5pm 8-10 pm est" (from a post a few years ago). Is this still the case and what is your time?

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Hi Guys Very nice method you have here Is the same like this method http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=7603 Might find something you can use.The last pages are al 1min scalping All the best Rooi

--- 帖子 #45 ---
lol Its something like what I do but its quite different I traded this system before the thread - ie, boga - was just on the hour one chart They picked up the MTF from my thread. I had a thread before that thread as well.. - it doesn't really matter. The thread you speak of died because people tried it on shorter and shorted time frames ie. one minute and people lost money. When we were in risk on risk off I found 30 min and 5 mins together worked. (I do 60 mins and 15 mins together now) I found when we got back to a normal markets (i) the retracements on the 5 min took out to many stops (ii) on the 30 min I was not getting good RRR targets But whatever workers - as I started with it can be personalize . On a side note - personally I like to plan my trades with LO and retests so, I have found an hour is the smallest time frame I like to study. Then I need to look at the charts 3 times a day and I find all the trades I need in a week. Good luck on the minute trading - pls tell us how you do - post your results - I like to see charts. regards

--- 帖子 #46 ---
With NFP coming up - on Friday I am happy with my 4 trades on this system this week 3 winners and on in B.E. I am a little concerned with this trade though (i) News on interest rates on both the Aud and the Eur (ii) News out of the old USSR (iii) This trade is taking a long time which is normally ok- But we will start seeing the big boys setting up today for the NFP and so we may start to see big swings or a tight market.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Hello TEB63, Last 2 days was doing some backtest on gold pairs and i must say that this look really good, simple and understandable which is most important part of trading for me.Will give it a try... 1.Do you enter after candle close or right away when PA penetrate throught rsi 45/55 lvl on 1h chart? 2.Do you leave trade to hit your SL or TP or sometimes you close on BE. (lets say PA goes in your favor 2:1 and then move to be point,will you close it on BE,or leave to hit SL or you adjusting on market environment? 3.DO you have some kind of alarms when PA breaks throught 45/55 levels? 4.How do you pick pairs for that week,or on daily basis? Hope you understand all questions... Regards

--- 帖子 #48 ---
1.Do you enter after candle close or right away when PA penetrate through rsi 45/55 lvl on 1h chart? always candle close entry 2.Do you leave trade to hit your SL or TP or sometimes you close on BE. Normally I let it run - I may only change to B.E. if or when there is a ... 1. NFP 2. Interest rate changes or talks 3. A change in trend on the 240 minute chart 4. A war or something other wise I normally let it run 3. DO you have some kind of alarms when PA breaks through 45/55 levels? No I eye ball it a few times a day 4.How do you pick pairs for that week, or on daily basis? I Eye ball all the pairs I showed before, a few times a day. I trade on this system bottom up. Hope you understand all questions... Regards[/quote]

Are the 5&amp;12 EMAS so important in this strategy? I think maybe its enough to check the RSI crossing above 55 by closed candle. Just would like to understand a bit better which roll the emas are playing...

--- 帖子 #51 ---
The 5 &amp; 12 EMAs are to get in on a retracement - to get a better entry. The RSI(s) are to read the trend. Candles are to enter.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Ok. So we have to enter AFTER a Standart Candle (PRC,MC,BC) formed after a 5&amp;13 EMA retracement. Is this correct?

--- 帖子 #53 ---
Well yes .... but there is a lot more then that to it Pls read 1st Posting.

--- 帖子 #54 ---
^^ yes i know i did. I read it like 10 times and its very helpfull to me. I ment what i said after checking trends and all the info on post 1. Focusing on the enter process only. I wait for ema retracement and then i enter AFTER a PRC,MC or BC candle forming...

--- 帖子 #55 ---
yes When everything else is lined up. ie. your S.E.T. and RRR and Trend rules are all met

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Perfect everything is so clear now...i only could not find what a BC is in any place. Can you explain or link? or maybe its not to share... Thanks a lot TEB63. Ill follow this thread everyday.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
(BC) .. I have removed them from the 1st list- they are not needed for this system. They have to do with SDZ, but they are beyond were I want to go in this thread. They are kind of there own system with something called banker's ladders. Sorry for the confusion.

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Ok i forget about them then. Im trying this method with previous strong/weak analysis to determine better trends...or you think it has no sense to make the analisis for this system?

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Well they are kind of Opposite to each other. This is a bottom up system. ie. find a set up on the hour and move up to 4 hour and day to confirm The other one you speak of is a Top down system. start with day and move down to find a set up I would not mix them I think you are doubling your work.

--- 帖子 #60 ---
I dont want to drive you crazy with my questions, so im sorry for asking so much ^^ but this is very interesting. Honestly i dont understand what you mean with that this is a bottom up system and the other one a Top down one. For me they are like similiar because we are looking for "the best entry based on currency strength and best moment to enter after looking different timeframes". Again sorry for asking stupid questions, your thread is very helpful to me.

--- 帖子 #61 ---
Hello TEB63, Can you comment Aussie please to see your thoughts 1.On weekly basis i see double bottom and divergence on RSI 2.On Daily there is RSI above 55 lvl,PA is really quite preparing for new push up 3.4h chart could go up at least up to previous high and form 3 top or break throught 4. trigger 1 hour chart preparing for new push above 55 lvl and we can enter on good candle Would you enter in this trade or is you thing that bull move is exausted for now? Thanks in advance...

--- 帖子 #62 ---
well its the thought process here I look every few hours at the pairs. and see if I get a 5 &amp; 12 Cross on the hour. Then I look at the trade from there... I next look at the 4 hour then the day charts ... so Bottom up so its ... hour - 4 hour - day ---- Bottom up On the currency strength we find the best pairs and watch for a trade set up so its ... day - 4 hour - hour ---- top down

--- 帖子 #63 ---
You cannot know if a trade should be entered - until you identify all your S. E. T. Rules -Esp. your Stop Loss and targets Then you can see if you have a good RRR. Finding good entries is easy ...finding good trades is a little harder!!

--- 帖子 #64 ---
Totally understood. I really appreciate your help. Ill be following your thread everyday to continue learning. Maybe i post some charts when i see something interesting (if you dont mind).

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Understand what you mean,i still creating own MM rules but wonder would you consider this trade on 1h chart when it show all rules on 1h chart from post 1? Cause i see that this trade could be per rules when everything line up but I am interested would you enter in those kind of trades from your experianceor you would miss.In this way i could learn faster (i have experiance not newbie but trying to get feel and thoughts from you and your system) I personally wouldn't enter in this one but trying to see are you trade this more mechanically where all lined up or you are picky with your entries! Regards!

--- 帖子 #66 ---
sure post away cheers back later this afternoon

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Again the most important point is your RRR... what is your RRR on the trade. The entry is only 1/3 of the S.E.T rules. How can anyone judge something without all the facts. (there is not even prices on the sides of the charts) Also I really do not want to get into telling others what do to what to trade - please take what you like from the thread and make your own trades. Trade on a demo - trade lots on the demo - &amp; make mistakes and learn. You will loss almost every trade at 1st - the more you trade your winning rate will rise. (with this system you only need to win 1 out of 4 to break even!!) I have been playing with this system for like 8 yrs. So I know very well BUT!!! You can not take my screen time and make it yours. you have to put in your own screen time in. So, on a demo take lots of trades- loss lots of demo money . &amp; every trade that works out or not see why and learn from it. cheers

--- 帖子 #68 ---
Hello TEB! Love your thread! Keep it going. I could use a little help on your general SET rules. I always struggle on determining stop loss and TP. Can you offer some advice or some of your general rules? The 3:1 RR is great. Thanks in advance! SirWolf

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Hy Teb63, Thanks for detailed answear.The fact that you trade this system for 8 years is great and is enought quality info for me to start testing.Will post my progress,thoughts and chart when i start and make clear directions and S.E.T of rules for myself based on your strategy Wish you many green pipos!

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Cool! Have fun! And lose lots of Demo Money!

--- 帖子 #71 ---
The S.E.T. rules; This is the learning side! The screen time side. I look up for targets - 4 hour &amp; day Charts I look down for entries and stop losses - Hours and 15 minutes charts I like - SDZ - and - Round Number- and Swings Pivots. when I mix it all do together I want to get at least 3 to 1 RRR (I like 4 to 1 to get 3 to 1 really) I am not sure what less to say on that. cheers

--- 帖子 #72 ---
for Buy Entry rules: when confirming the 1 hour you get further confirmation on 4hour and 1 day.... does that mean that RSI has to be broken on both timeframes OR only on 4 hour? If it requires both timeframes to be broken, then you are essentially entering on the 1 hour retracement......correct? And from there you then require a 15 min retracement for entry I would assume....

--- 帖子 #73 ---
ok (i) Hour The RSIs have to be over the 55 on all three- hour, 4 hour and day then we look for a retracement. (ii) 15 Minutes The RSIs have to be over the 55 on all four - 15 minutes, hour, 4 hour and day then we look for a retracement on the 15 minute I see this as still a trade on the hour chart. In fact there needs to be a set up in effect on the hour. And you are looking for a second buy signal on the 15 minute chart after missing a signal on the hour. YOU NEED A STRONG TREND IN EFFECT

--- 帖子 #74 ---
thanks for the explaination in previous post, becoming much clearer now.....also, I've noticed that you made reference to "pending orders " in earlier posts. Below is 1 hour retracement on the eurjpy happening right now......any comments would be greatly appreciated in the way of pending orders:

--- 帖子 #75 ---
The 20 RSI is between the 45 and 55 levels its what I call "chop" and so its a no trade set up. So the thought process 1. The cross of the 5 and the 12 EMA - look for a trade 2. The 20 RSI is in chop - no need to look farther - No Trade

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Wed night - 3rd time looking at it today

--- 帖子 #77 ---
EJ set up and GJ set up (little late on this one) Post trades people! Will trade this method when I have spare time and post trades

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Dear Zokynho Your candle are RSI based? Thank you very much Dan

--- 帖子 #79 ---
hi, system look very clear and profitable, can you prefer it on GJ ? thanks

--- 帖子 #80 ---
Hey Dansmol, Yes it is RSI based on.You can find that indicator on this thread,someone posted it. Regards!

--- 帖子 #81 ---
I think there are no tradable setups today. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #82 ---
tomorrow in NFP and I am happy with my total on this is week but the following are pair that I would be watching if I was trading usdcad, audusd, eurjpy, audjpy, eurcad, capjpy, gbpcad

--- 帖子 #83 ---
I like to see real candles. I like to see the red and green or as I have here white and grey it helps judge the strength of movement

--- 帖子 #84 ---
CAD/JPY 1h,4h and daily over 55RSI. So now we are waiting for price on 1h to make a retracement down. When it goes up again we wait for our specific candle to enter. Let me know if im wrong.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Sounds right to me, I'm already in CAD/JPY so it better not retrace down lol

--- 帖子 #86 ---
[quote=ralf86;7380709]CAD/JPY 1h,4h and daily over 55RSI. So now we are waiting for price on 1h to make a retracement down. When it goes up again we wait for our specific candle to enter. Let me and look for an entry the targets are quite good on that pair. I doing a seminar this morning so good trading all

--- 帖子 #87 ---
good stuff post your chart places the S.E.T on it

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Can't post a chart atm because of work, I have eyes on me but I have a quick question. I'm looking at the pair EUR/AUD, its in consolidation. Mas about to cross, lets say that we get a nice bear candle and RSI crosses below 45. Would you take that Teb? Or wait for it to begin its 1H trend and take the pullback?

--- 帖子 #89 ---
[quote=TEB63;7380721] I think maybe that entry is too big retracement. But i also guess its better to loose an opportunity than to loose capital. Ill also wait for that bigger retracement, however i dont think it will happen.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
chop no trade - do not try to out think the market or anticipate it just go with what it gives you

--- 帖子 #91 ---
[quote=ralf86;7380763] nothing wrong with that thinking for sure !! esp with tomorrow. but remember this is a trend following system with retracement to get you a good entry not a retracement system with the trend cheers

--- 帖子 #92 ---
xD it made retracement. Not triggered by half a pip. Should i just put buy limit or we should wait for momentum or price rejection candle on the 15 min?

--- 帖子 #93 ---
EURAUD now: Attached Image (click to enlarge) But we are at support on the daily. If if breaks, we will have a nice move down. But could bounce up. Would you have taken that one TEB ? Edit: all TF have RSI below 45, but 4H candle still not close. When you check RSI, do all candle need to be closed (specifically 4H and D) ?

--- 帖子 #94 ---
I asked Teb about this a few posts above, I wasn't clear on his answer because RSI was &gt; 45 when he posted that but I was saying "IF" we get a bear candle and RSI dips below 45 would you take it?. Well that came true, I didn't take it but I was eying that pair for a few days. EDIT: Fbird, we are supposed to wait for 1H close, but NOT 4h or daily close.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Ok thanks Sicarius. Made a mistake: 1 H RSI was not below 45 on candle close. Now going up lol...

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Let´s see if CHF/JPY crosses 1 Hour TF 55 line, while 4H and Daily is bullish too. Could be a good setup.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
It seems that we have to wait at least one more hour.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
CAD/JPY SL ...what a retracement My mistake was not entering when emas crossed up again after retracement. I entered long later. Great first lesson. TEB63 you think we can trade this strategy on friday?

--- 帖子 #99 ---
I think i found a nice one. 1h-4h-daily over 55RSI. Since there is no retracement on 1h, i moved down to 15m and found retracement crossed. RRR 3:1 What do you think?

--- 帖子 #100 ---

--- 帖子 #102 ---
I do not see anything

--- 帖子 #103 ---
your charts are a bit confusing. your charts are out of order and I and not sure about the extra EMAs on the charts also what is the 4 hour doing? and with NPF tomorrow it might be fun I think your SL is to small remember its still an hour trade even if you enter on the 15 min chart I like a longer trade

--- 帖子 #104 ---
guys I have seen thread after thread die on FF because people add this and that and in a few week its not the same thread Can we only have 5 &amp;12 EMAs and 20 RSI on our charts no other tools, indicators and oscillators. SDZ, trend lines and support and resistance are ok and also normal candles - no RSI Candles or trading bars. Lets all do the same thing and its easier for us all to see and understand anyone posting anything else will be band its the only way. thanks guys

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Youre right. I entered from 15m but as it still 1h trade i should put my targets from 1h. thank you

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Sorry, ill reorganize my template to your style. The aditional emas had nothing to do with this system. I only have them there to check other stuff. Again, ill re-configure the template so it fits yours. C ya tomorrow

hi friends, I am new to this thread and try to understand this system, I have some question to clear my confusion 1: in GBPJPY 15 min and 1 hour show rsi under 45 approx. but in 4 hour and daily shows rsi above 55, so I want to know if we get short signal 1 hr tf can I take it from 15 min or I have to wait for 4hr,daily to coming rsi under 45 ???? 2: if rsi come above 55 in 1 hr and 15 min then can I take long entry ??? because 4hr and daily already in long in rsi ????? waiting for answers sorry for my bad English I like this system and try to understand it properly thanks all

--- 帖子 #111 ---
This is a trend following system, after a pullback. Your Q 1. From Teb's first post, " Entry 1. Trade is in line with Big Trend on the Four hour &amp; Day (Big Picture)" Your Q 2. Yes after a pullback and crossing of the 2 MA if the H4 and D1 stay above RSI reading of 55. HTH

--- 帖子 #112 ---
thank you for your reply, I think I am going right

--- 帖子 #113 ---
Ok The system is really day, 4 hour and Hour - it work on those three charts and we think about these 3 charts. 15 minute chart the 15 minute chart really is more of an advances version - you do not need it for the system. (i) Its an add on. (ii) Its always an after thought. (iii) If you have a strong trend on the main 3 charts and you missed an entry on the hour. Then and only then do you look do you look for a re-entry on the hour by looking for a signal on the 15 min. (iv) An hour entry will always be safer in win rate - the 15 minute entry will always risk less money. In fact the real trading chart is always the hour. Weather the entry is on the hour chart or the 15 minute charts. I hope that helps

--- 帖子 #114 ---
yep this looks really good I would be watching the 15 minute chart I think you may get an enter after the NFP on this. Two things 1. Remember its NFP today 2. Think about do you want to told a new trade over the weekend. Oanda spreads get crazy over the weekend and will take out stop's esp things like gbpnzd I would dump a lot of trades on Friday before noon. esp. any that are not from the my Gold list and so I would not put on a lot of trades on a Friday. esp if they are not from my Gold list - (your here is by the way)

--- 帖子 #115 ---
But what if i have RSI up on all but there was still no ema retracement? Can i go to 15m to wait for a 15m ema retracement and enter from there?

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Yes for sure that is the point of the 15 min. All I am saying is think of it an a re-entry on the hour rather then an entry on the 15 minute. Then your stops and target will be based on an hour chart rather then 15 minutes chart.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
Guys you should use this template so it looks like tebs. Its also better to avoid confusion as he said.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
Yes, then i switch to hourly as its an 1h trade. But as it takes longer for 1h candles to go down (retracement) and go up again so we have ema cross&amp;enter; i just wait for that process on 15m. But then i look at higher timeframes for targets.

Yes I think you got - but just to be clear for others There would have to be a full enter signal on the hour already! That would be ... Both the 20 RSI and the 5/12 cross in place . - not just the RSI cross like in the 4 hour and day. Then and only then do we drill down to the 15 minute chart and look for an entry - which is really a secondary entry on the hour.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
yes its help me to more clear to understand this system and I also re read many times your 1st post to understand it clearly and thank you so much for your info

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Hello Teb63, Is there any particular reason why you choose 5 and 12 EMA's? Regards!

--- 帖子 #122 ---
lol You really want to know? Well 10 years ago now two of the main entry triggers that were a rage everywhere were.... 5 &amp; 12 EMAs cross and 5 EMA and 8 SMA cross As the two pairings have almost the same entry place, I simply choose one. I have used it ever since. Both have hence gone out of favour. I think in fact at 1st they had to do with the number of Days on a daily charting, ie. 5 is a week etc. Then these MA pairings were moved down to lower time charts for no real reason. Which is were I 1st saw them and that is where I picked them up, In fact I do not use then as an entry signal but rather as a retracement signal. They work out to be about the same as a Stoch or CCI or other crossing tools with the same settings but with two advantages 1. Less boxes on the chart (just the main chart one and the box for the 20 RSI) 2. We see the EMAs inter- play with the candles then self Very scientific reasons for them (lol) but they seen to work for me. cheers

--- 帖子 #123 ---
very scientific reasons for them... lool Have question about Money management: You have some fixed rule like 'I can be only in 3 pairs exposed if 7 gives me entry or you will enter in all 7 pairs if you see that there are good opportunities? Regards!

--- 帖子 #124 ---
I do not like more then two trades that are closely correlated. I will normally only have one trade for the cooper list - maybe two. But if I have trade(s) that are up 50 pips or more I may discount those trade(s) ....(I really should move those trade(s) to BE - Sometime I do sometimes I do not) I normal do 4% per entry. I do not like having more the 16% in - again unless some trade(s) are way in the money.

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Ok great,thanks for info. Sorry for so many questions,but have one more..Is there particular sessions that you looking for trade or isn't important for you? I prepared everything to start test from Monday.Will use gold and silver pairs only with entries on 1hour chart (sometimes 15 minutes with strong trend) MM: Will enter in 2 positions always on pair,both 0.5% with 1:2 RRR and 1:3 RRR with second position in BE when hits 1:2 Cannot be in more than 3 pairs exposed if SL is not on BE trade.Thinking to enter on same pairs 2 times if I see good opportunity and SL is at BE. Will send here thoughts and trades so i can learn from you. My template looks like this. Having swing pivots,daily pivot,will draw S and R and trend lines,rsi and Ma's. Let's see how this will work! Highest regards

Closing out before NFP big expectation - so we could see big moves . Do not want to take the chance had a good week 5 - wins as seen in 3 - TP 2 - Close in the money at 92 pips and 36 pips

--- 帖子 #127 ---
LOL ok bad USD NFP and AUD is up lol let see it drop 192k is not great !! 250K would not cover new people coming in to the USA job market and that would not touch those who are out now. Its great watching BBC vs The USA TV the Libs control the USA - if it was Bush in the - the World would be ending (lol) But because there is a Democrat in the white house192k is good lol BBC has it right. But we will have the trends back in place for Monday

--- 帖子 #128 ---
hi , please explain me about TP, i am little bit confused about closed trade thanks

--- 帖子 #129 ---
TP is take profit when the compute closes your trade down at your profit level I closed the other 2 trades because it is NFP I have lost more money NFP Friday - then all most all the other days of the month put together, so I normally close out if I think there is anything funny. today is funny. I would rather not take chances. I added over 3% to this account this week I am happy with that.

--- 帖子 #130 ---
Then i think i understood something wrong. In an uptrend the EMA retracement has to happen on 1h? i though i could enter from 15m ema retracement if i dont see 1h retracement. Because if move is very strongon 1h the emas are not making retracement (they "separate"). Thats why i moved to 15m to look for retracement. Ill be glad if you clear this point as its very important. Sorry for inconvinienve. I read whole thread many times but understood this like this. I also checked the recent AUD/CHF trade and there was a retracement on 1h but 2 candles BEFORE the RSI over 55. So the though process was: 1h rsi over 5-4h also over 55-daily also over 55. Emas on 1h very separated (long wait for retracement on this timeframe 1h)...so i went to 15m and saw retracement about 12 candles later. I went in on crossback. Thats how i understand it and very appreciate any correction. Thanks TEB63

--- 帖子 #131 ---
I think you have it now. but no you never enter on the 15 minute chart unless you missed an entry on the hour. that is why I said - do not see your self ever trading on the 15 minute chart rather only the hour. - the 15 minute entry is still an hour entry The EMAs on the hour will likely close a little - not always. But you must still be in a clear trend. Its best to get in on the 1st retracement on the 15 minute chart after the entry signal on the hour chart by the way. That's it for we for the week. I hoped it was helpful to everyone I am starting a mini vacation and next week back to my normal weeks cheers

--- 帖子 #132 ---
Thank you TEB. C ya next week then. Enjoy the weekend.

--- 帖子 #133 ---
hi man, i think you don't understand my question, i want to say how you set your tp ?? which chart you use for tp ?? i mean 4 hr or anything else???

--- 帖子 #134 ---
I have answered this and is in the 1st post - please read But targets - TP are normally from 4 hour or day

--- 帖子 #135 ---
yes got it, thanks man see you monday happyweekend all

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Looks interesting good luck. Just remember to keep it simple. the more complex the more that will go wrong cheers

--- 帖子 #137 ---
I got 411 pips for the week with this stysyem. One thought for the weekend. I see everyone trying to figure out the market - I am not sure you ever can really. But the best chance to do that is a top down system. This System is not designed to do that for sure - its a bottom up system. We re-act to what is going in the market and we do not anticipate it. Look at our charts 3 or 4 times a day - less when you have trade(s) on. Don't care what was going on yesterday or even 3 hours ago- it doesn't matter - I wiped all my charts on Friday so on Monday I will be totally clean. Think of this system as a dance and the market is the man or the lead and we are partner. - the market is Fred Astaire and we are Ginger Rogers We you do everything the market does but backwards and in high heels (LOL) Have a great Weekend

--- 帖子 #138 ---
nice trade man , I have a question, how many pairs you trade ?? and I was backtest this system, its really good but we not get daily signal, right ??

--- 帖子 #139 ---
I have a list of pairs in the thread - please read the thread. (Post 22) I am not sure what you mean by daily signal?

--- 帖子 #140 ---
i mean we not get daily entry with it in one pair, right ?? i have to wait for complete all conditions to take trade, sometimes i have to wait 2-3 days to get perfect entry ,right ?? hope you understand sorry for to many questions

--- 帖子 #141 ---
well yes we have to wait for all the conditions always or we have no edge. Again you are trying to anticipate a trade on one pair or maybe a few pairs. It does work that way, you can go weeks and not trade a pair. ie the eurchf is a bad pair to trade it can snake for months in chop. other pairs like the eurusd or the audusd you can likely take a trade 1/2 the days. you have to see what the market gives and take that only you do not need a lot of trade to make a lot of pips just a few good ones - I took 5 trades that is a great number for a week. normally more trades means (1) more loses - and that happens! Losing trades last a short time so you end up with more trades-. (2) your trades are highly correlated which is like taking the same trade 2 times - good if you win not so good if you lose.

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Hy Teb63, What is your winning % on trades...I know this is very individual but just curios as you working with this strategy long time and have good umderstanding? Regards

--- 帖子 #143 ---
thanks for explain it, bdw i like to trade in jpy pairs only, audjpy,eurjpy and gbpjpy is on my target, i was backtest with this three pairs and yes these results are amazing with this pairs. waiting for monday. and also i am agree with you that we have to see what market want to say , because market never care anyone, its going with his rules, we have to understand what market want, we all know that trend is our friend .

--- 帖子 #144 ---
lol Well some times really good- like this week sometimes not. - but at 3 to 1 RRR it always works out ok for me. - I think you as a new person should be shooting for a 50% win rate. To be clear if all the trades were the same 100 pips SL Then at 50% win 2 loses @ 100 pips = 200 pips (loss) 2 wins @ 300 pips = 600 pips (Win) A total winning of = 400 pips (Win)

--- 帖子 #145 ---
you may be to small in what you are looking at the pound and eur are very close the aud is quite different of coarse and of the majors for any trend system the JPY is the hardest pairs to trade go for 3 to 1 RRR for sure as you will have lots of stop outs good luck

--- 帖子 #146 ---
Would you advise this system at all for say 1 hour, 30 min as trend and 5 min entry? during certain sessions? Lemme know

--- 帖子 #147 ---
the 30 and 60 not big enough difference. try 2 hour (4 hour if you only have it) 30 min and 5 min only 3am to 11am EST you might get away. but do 3 to 1 RRR because you will be stopped out in the crazy time lol 5pm to 7pm EST

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Hallo Zokynho; can you please give us your RSI above / under 45/55 " indi ? Thx

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Hy yoyotrader, I will post this indi if TEB63 gives permission as this is his thread and he doesn't want another stuff to complicated things.I use this as it is the same thing as RSI indy,only for visual guide! Regards!

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Can someone please explain me that: If RSI is above 55 at Daily + 4h + 1H , what is the unique strategy for long in this thread ? One can enter a trade at any point when these 3 conditions are met and be in profit as long as R:R is good. Correct me if I'm wrong.

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Look also at the emas mention at first post. Your questions are answered if you read the thread.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Believe me I read all. It is you who did not read between my lines. Of course when RSI is above 55 in all 3 TF's, the MA's should be on the same direction too. This is not something to discover any new.

--- 帖子 #153 ---
you can lose for sure if all you are doing is entering with three trends calls on the RSI with Good RRR The MAs may not be in line with the RSI are at all. I have always said finding a good entry is rather easy finding a good trade is not what do you mean reading between the lines?

--- 帖子 #154 ---
On my watch list for now: CADJPY, USDCAD, AUDUSD, AUDJPY, EURCAD, GBPCAD, EURAUD, EURUSD, USDCHF and AUDNZD missing any?

--- 帖子 #155 ---
First of all im sure there nothing to read between that lines you mention. Second you are wrong, in smaller timeframe you can have an ema retracement, so its not following the rsi in that moment ...as TEB already said.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Well, i am keeping an eye on almost every pair but will having into account if its an Golden, silver or copper pair in case os posible trade.

--- 帖子 #157 ---
what times do you usually like to look at your charts? or do you just do it when you can?

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Hi Teb, been following for 3 yrs now. you have been doing a great job.thanks a lot. i have down loaded oanda but the rsi does not look like yours. pls what do i do to get it exactly like yours.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Best times to trade A normally do not start until 8am on Monday (on this system) - I trade in the NY time zone. (sometime after 5am - but it safer to wait) I want to see which way the big boys in London and Europe see the wind blowing. Also just before the euro opening on Monday there can be wild moves as people re-position Esp. after NFP Then I just check 2 or 5 times a day - the more trades I have on the less I look I can look in 10 minutes easy- and 3 minutes more if I look to putting a trade on. As I said I live in the NY time zone so I may check at, (i) If I am up around 4am to 5am 9 (HKD &amp; SGD close) (ii) 7:30am to 9 am (news and FX NY open) (iii) Around noon (London close - NY Lunch) (iv) Around NY close (Aud open) (v) Maybe around 8pm (JPY open) On Monday and Tuesday I may check 5 times on Friday once I like being light on trades over the weekend. (Normally clear house before NFP Friday) I like 3 to 5 winning trades a week with this system I tend to have more loses on Monday and Tuesday- In fact I have often thought of not trading on Monday or at least after the NY close

--- 帖子 #160 ---
on third chart go to trend line and pull it down to the 50% level on the RSI - this is not needed by the way, I just do this so I can see what the three charts in a pair say really quickly

--- 帖子 #161 ---
First time here, interesting.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
AU H1

--- 帖子 #163 ---
where are you going to place your stop and target? the issue with heikin-Ashi candles, it will be target to find targets and stops unless they are swings - like in this case. you will not see most SDZ

--- 帖子 #164 ---
I didn't took this trade as there is divergence on RSI H4 and big number is to close in my opinion + China holiday so expecting some slower movements.If we see break out of big number i will look for entry on 15 min chart! Regards!

--- 帖子 #165 ---
interesting. I would not be to concerned with the round number as it has already taken it out. I do not worry to much about divergence - again its just one more thing - I would be more concerned with the stop loss level the logical place is below .9270 which is about a 22-25 pips stop is small - that can be ok small risk by the way the target on that is great at just under the .9400 what I like about this trade a lot 1. is its from my gold list 2. this one and the eurusd I have found these are the two best - straight movers in the early morning

--- 帖子 #166 ---
So in this case you wouldn't enter in this one TEB?

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Hello Teb, Thank you for your efforts. According to your minimal and clean charts you use, What about using RSI indi in mtf, so we can use only one chart for pair H1 of M15 instead of 3 charts (H1, 4H, and D1) for each pair? Post: http://codebase.mql4.com/8938 Video: Inserted Video

--- 帖子 #184 ---
looks good

--- 帖子 #185 ---
thanks for all your hard work on this! I do not do MT4 This might be good as a screening things. I think there is great value in seeing all the charts. After a wail you can look at say a day chart. and you can see that price is below the "45 level" but its snaking up and down and so the trade maybe just ok etc

--- 帖子 #186 ---
Tuesday morning

--- 帖子 #187 ---
Hi FXA thanks- personalize it for yourself, this is a great starter system. It has all the needed parts. Its a great mid-time frame system. Really I have given the bones - each person has to put the flesh on it

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Thanks great Tebs. You have transformed me into a profitable trader especially with my own tweeks. I remain grateful.

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Imo i think this system is fantastic, but i think it could be further improved by having some exit rules. I understand Tebs has mention that he does it by having a good R:R and also based on some resistance levels, but i believe R:R are not set in stone and we cant always expect to win a 100 pips just because we are risking 50 pips. Rather that putting it that way, why not have some method/indicator to measure when the trend is going to stop for a while and perhaps doing a pullback so we can take some profits too just incase the trend reverse. Or maybe someone already has might wanna share with us =) Just my 2 cents worth opinion

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Anyone catch the AU? I was waiting for setup then fell asleep haha

--- 帖子 #191 ---
For sure find the exit rules that work for you! But I never said nor would I never say I have to look for a 100 pips target for 50 pips stop to trade (1st in a trend system that RRR will likely lose over time - because of spread and slippage.. and Stop running) Rather I see what is the stop to entry - then what is the entry to target and will that give me a good RRR I would not force the trade - if its not there I would not take the trade that is why I say its easy to find good entries its hard to find good trades also I personally do not really work with resistance or support levels

--- 帖子 #192 ---
slow day nothing new really today

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Hi TEB. I have a question: after all the conditions about RSI are lined up (for 1h, 4h and day charts), we see the cross between 5&amp;12 MAs...how big should be the candle immediately after the cross, in order to act? Thanks! And another one kind of personal...if you can answer ok, if not we understand. Do you trade for living or you have also another daily job ? Thanks!

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Slow week

--- 帖子 #195 ---
Teb - Like you I also use Oanda but I don't like the time of the daily rollover, midnight (ET, 11pm CT). I'm an early to bed, early to rise type so I want to trade the 7am 4H - D - W scenario. Question: should I use the 1H or still the 15M to double check an entry if I missed the opening at 7am. I don't think this is likely but still good to know. I tried staying up for 11pm daily trades but the next day isn't good for me and I had many losses when I was asleep but London was wide awake and in full throttle. I would appreciate your comments and certainly respect and appreciate the time you have spent with this thread. piprac

--- 帖子 #196 ---
? - I am not sure you understand the system day roll over doesn't matter

--- 帖子 #197 ---
I understand that trading the 1H can be done anyti8me; I was thinking, and I wasn't clear, that I wanted to use your strategy on D-W-M but I'm unwilling to hang around until 11pm for the new day, the Daily, so I am thinking of the new 4H at my 7am. I will give it a try tomorrow, I want to reduce monitor time and I can't seem to do that trading the one hour. Hope this clarifies.quote=TEB63;7395261]{quote} ? - I am not sure you understand the system day roll over doesn't matter[/quote]

audusd

--- 帖子 #199 ---
[/quote] I see now ok you can place limit orders or you can get an entry signal to trade on the 4 hour chart and still be on the day chart or most times price will come back to or even better price then the standard opening so get in a retracement lower then the opening better RRR

Hello, I am in Aud/Jpy little bit late althought and Eur/Nzd,again missed entry on Aussie as I was sleeping Regards!!

EUR/NZD SL hit! -46 pips Regards!

--- 帖子 #204 ---
usdjpy I missed it lets see if I can get in on a retest

--- 帖子 #205 ---
that is normal I am 1 win (112 pips ) and 2 losers (23 and 45 pips) as well. It looks like I am going to pick up one more of each so I will have 2 winner and 3 losers but my winners are a lot more then my losers,

--- 帖子 #206 ---
usdjpy got in on the retest this is why you never have to chase trades you can get lots if the market is moving

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Sir, so i was right finding entry according to your system ??

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Hy Teb, Not sure if I understood good. You have 112 pips wins and 2 losers (23 and 45),is that mean that you would close winner regardless that they arent currently 1:3 hit tp or this is closed trade and you would cut your currently looser with that winner. Asking this because my eur/aud trade was +106 pips (thought to close it then but this isn't according to rules) in profit,currently is +21 and had more 2 trades opened which may be losers,and eur/aud can also end in losing positions,so not sure are you leavening trades till the end or you playing with positions? Regards!

--- 帖子 #209 ---
no all three trades I let run - the winner was a little more then 3 to 1 in fact

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Ok Thanks!

Hi again everybody, ive been upsent these 3 days as i had to fix some stuff abroad. Ill read all the posts to keep up with your work so we can continue together Glad to be back again.

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Hi guys and great system TEB I'm backtesting a bit, I've a doubt and don't think (and hope) wasn't asked already. If : - I have a good cross on 1H - I watch 4H and RSI is above 55 so no problem - I watch Daily and RSI is above 55 on this candle at this time, but the last Daily candle was in CHOP ZONE Should I wait for a Daily candle to CLOSE above RSI 55 or should I take the trade immediately and take the risk of a daily close in CHOP ZONE? I've seen we've already talked about the candle close, but it was referred to the 1H candle. What about 4H and Daily? Thanks in advance and hope to be clear with my english

--- 帖子 #213 ---
well yes and no.. (lol) this might be a bit strange I do want the candle to be closed on the 4 hour candle chart always on the day chart I have a silly little rule - (because Oanda closes at mid-night) So I call between 4 pm and 5 pm (the NY Close) as the close and not Mid night. (but it would be safest to wait.) so my closed candle keeps moving. but I always want at least a 1/3 of the candle 1st candle over the 5ema. But to be honest you do not need to be in a hurry as there will be lots of entries - re-entries -re-tests and Limit Orders

--- 帖子 #214 ---
I'd like to be on the safest.... So I'll wait for all candles to close above 55. As you said, we don't need to be in a hurry

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Is a 1H cross as good as a resumption of the trend after a pullback? Assuming of course that the rsi on the 4H &amp; D. comply. p.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
J the cross is the resumption of a trend after a pullback - that is kind of the point

--- 帖子 #217 ---
does anyone else have any other new questions?

--- 帖子 #218 ---
Which candelstick patterns you look most? And trade you fulltime? Thanks:-)

--- 帖子 #219 ---
I trade when I like candle patterns mostly Momentum patterns - ie. best outside Candles- rail way - pins

--- 帖子 #220 ---
Hi TEB, can I trade this system on day, I mean all Tokyo, London and New York session

--- 帖子 #221 ---
Sorry, I remembered a comment that "we don't trade crossovers, we trade trend resumptions after a pullback" but that statement was made by Felicia in her "Cornflower" thread, very similar idea but your charts are cleaner IMO.

--- 帖子 #231 ---
Using just 1Hr entry this wasn't valid, right? I'm trying to see the logic but the only MA cross i can see on 1H chart is invalidated because of RSI on chopping zone Am I missing something? Great trade BTW

--- 帖子 #232 ---
why? in fact I missed the hour entry and I dropped down to the 15 min and got in

--- 帖子 #233 ---
When you said on the rules: If you "miss an entry on 1HR" you can switch down to the 15 min, I thought you were referring to a "missed VALID entry" beacuse of, for example, you aren't at the screen at that time.... So just to resume: If we have an invalid entry on 1 Hr we can switch down to 15 min cart to look for a valid entry. Right?

--- 帖子 #234 ---
No not at all !! never see yourself trading on the 15 min charts only the hour charts. So the trade on the 15 min charts has to be in effect on the hour chart 1st. but it was missed so it has to be valid.

--- 帖子 #235 ---
What do you mean for "valid" on 1H? Can you post an hourly chart highlighting the 1Hr candle from wich you did look for a 15 min entry? Sorry for questions but I wanna make sure to understand correctly cause I like your system so much. Thanks in advance TEB

--- 帖子 #236 ---
the hour has to be in trade but the trade was/is missed so we want a good entry so we drop down to the 15 min but we are still trading on the hour also the stop loss from the hour would be very big which in this case might have been ok because we have a very generous bigger target on the day chart I took a smaller/ safer target off the hour

--- 帖子 #237 ---
here is a better one from a trade from before

Hmmmm so i just learned something new now. I didnt know that the EMA retracement in 1h could have happened BEFORE than the RSI`s under 45. As i see in first example, there was an EMA retracement on 1h and after that the 1h RSI also went under 45. I thought i ahve to look for the RSI`s first and then wait for retracement after that...

--- 帖子 #239 ---
it doesn't really matter . But be careful that the two are not to far away, its safer that the RSI crosses 1st - remember its the long term

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Understood. Thank you TEB

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Hi TEB63. You trade the 1HR and drop down to the 15MIN. What timeframes would you recommend dropping down to if you were to trade on DAILY or 4HR timeframes? I would assume 4HR for the DAILY and 1HR for the 4HR, but then do you recommend still dropping down further into lower timeframes? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
I would never trade this on anything less then 60 mins - the 15 min is still an hour trade. as to day and 4 hour charts I would concur

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Today i see some pairs (as AUD/CAD) that have retracement, RSI's on upper side and everything where it should be to enter a trade. However, a question appears to me. How do we manage this system in relation to S&amp;D Zones and RNs? Because I see a possible long trade but near a supply zone and i also see a long that just crossed a RN... Or does this system NOT take into account this SD &amp; RN?

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Hello TEB63! When you see entry on 1h(retrace and EMAs crossing back in wanted direction shown by H4 and Daily TFs), do you enter immediately after EMAs cross and candel close or after that you wait for another retrace and then enter the trade? Of course, RRR must be good... Thanks in advance!

--- 帖子 #245 ---
I will take either trade - the 1st time or the retest

--- 帖子 #246 ---
only trade if you see a good target that will give you a good RRR if you have a Stopping SDZ look at your stop the stop have to make since to the Target RN are secondary to SDZ

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Ok. So i better dont take the trade as i got SDZ and RN too near (no good RRR). Thanks TEB

--- 帖子 #248 ---
yes but it matters what chart your target is coming from ie. your target is from the day chart and you have stopping SDZ on the hour if your stop loss is beyond where price is likely to go back to on the hour you might take the trade if you can get good RRR.

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Understood. Thanks for this info TEB

--- 帖子 #250 ---
people keep asking me can you trade this on short time frames I use to As there is no trades today I pulled some smaller time frame trades 4 hour 1 hour 10 mins I will not count these as my weekly trades and am trading pennies!!! but for fun lets look I have a LO on the GbpCad as well

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Have you traded that frames combination also long time? I mean when there was no the standart frame combination... I also did not find trade setups today...

--- 帖子 #252 ---
I have taken 5 trades today with the 4 hour 1 hour 10 min 3 loses of 23 pips 35 pips and 54 pips 2 more trades with loses of 3 and 10 pips I am down $7.11 and other loses of $1.71 unrealised loses I think I will be down $10 before this is all over lol and hour is the smallest I have found you can trade this system will let you know my final loses are

--- 帖子 #253 ---
Hi. This may have been covered off in one of the posts already for this strategy Do you have any backtest results ? The system seems good on the face of it and relatively easy to test but not sure if its been tested?

--- 帖子 #254 ---
I have years before and so have others please do it our self and post results lost all 5 trades lost $12.14

--- 帖子 #255 ---
nothing at all - looks like the market is turning , hope for a trade tomorrow

--- 帖子 #256 ---
UPDATE! USD/JPY SL hit -33 X 2 AUD/USD SL hit -28 X 2 EUR/AUD currently -45,trade was +111 pips in one moment Looks like market is turning! I like this system but think something is missing,and that the potential turning spot on the market which can get us some bad trades as trend exhausting (no one know when or where)! Think that this system is best to implement in 1st (money wave) on 1h chart and eventually first 2 trades on 15 min chart if you missed 1h entry. In that case you can have 1:3 RRR(even more) but in later stages and entries these % of good RRR decreasing so the exit need some tweeks in my opinion or you will have more losses! So my conclusion is patiente and only first 1-2 opportunity when new day and 4h trend (RSI comes over 55 or under 45) and we will have very high probability trades! Regards!

--- 帖子 #257 ---
when did you enter these trades?

--- 帖子 #258 ---
send me your target on the euraud If you up more then a 100 pips - maybe move to BE trade Wow to see a 150 pip reversal is a lot

--- 帖子 #259 ---
Here are pictures of aussie! Regards!

--- 帖子 #260 ---
......and USD/JPY..... missed entry so reentered at same price 9 pips earlier then retrace on 15 min chart! Regards

--- 帖子 #261 ---
Here you go... Everything is according to rules! Regards!

--- 帖子 #262 ---
how did you get your target

--- 帖子 #263 ---
it was a tough week last week-- very choppy as has been this week the great thing about this system is for the most part it keeps you out of chop

--- 帖子 #264 ---
My general rule is to have 2 positions 1:2 and 1:3 RRR nad after 1st target hit move SL to BE. In Eur/Aud trade first target is above big number which offered my 1:2 and my second is just 1:3 (don't care as my SL is on BE than) but trade never come to that point and was few pips before SL hit! Regards!

--- 帖子 #265 ---
I have nothing again today with this system only thing I am really trading is day systems

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Well that trade as all other was according to rules (even you took that trade ).Thats why i offered my opinion about how to use this system if you we want to be profitable even in not to good trading periods with good RRR,maybe lesser trades but more quality! Just my 2 cents! Regards!

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Yes you are right the 1st or 2nd time over on the hour I have said that That is not the issue last week the market was flat there was very good moves one I got one misplaced I had pips for the week I only look for 3 good trades a week. (by the way with all the funny stuff in Russia that was the reason I closed out the reads on Friday)

--- 帖子 #268 ---
OT: What are your day systems? If you want to share......

--- 帖子 #269 ---
I didn t enter the trade, just wondering what do you think TEB63?

--- 帖子 #270 ---
where would your target be ? that is why I did not take it I could not find a good target also we are in a major SDZ on the Day chart I would want price to clear this area

--- 帖子 #271 ---
Yes, I agree with you, target might be hard thing.....but I think that GBPUSD might see 1.7....

--- 帖子 #272 ---
I seemed to have missed what SDZ means?

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Hi TEB, Just finish reading this thread, did some speedy backtest, your system is very good Thank you for sharing Happy pipping

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Re-entry on M15....what do you think??? Target around 0.81

--- 帖子 #275 ---
Supply &amp; Demand Zones. Google it if you dont know about.

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Keeping an eye on USD/CHF &amp; EUR/USD...

--- 帖子 #277 ---
read the 1st post

--- 帖子 #278 ---
looks good BUT we are going into a 4 day holiday in most of NA, Europe and other areas of the world in fact some countries in Europe start today and have a 5 day holiday so the liquidity will be terminally low after noon so I would not enter a trade

--- 帖子 #279 ---
great stuff please post results

--- 帖子 #280 ---
they are more simple based on pure price action please need to have had a great deal of screen time history to be able do them They are even more LO

--- 帖子 #281 ---
That's odd I two am using the meta trader and my RSI is more flat..

--- 帖子 #282 ---
TEB63 After you are in a trade are you adding to your positions after any bounce off the 55 or the 45 level?

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Some of the image are fine when you click to enlarge them put some do not enlarge very well anyone know how I could go about making them larger?

--- 帖子 #284 ---
sure if I can get good RRR and I am not over my % rules

--- 帖子 #285 ---
closing all trades done for the week See you guys Tuesday ! Happy and Blessed Easter to all who know or who may need to find

--- 帖子 #286 ---
HelloTeb,i am lurking and learnign from you, so best Easter to you and your family,regards ,juha

--- 帖子 #287 ---
thanks and same

--- 帖子 #288 ---
See you next week TEB

--- 帖子 #289 ---
Hey TEB, first of all Happy Easter to you and your family. I'm watching a bit to your trades and I can't understand your entries: NZDUSD 1H Your entry was before the emas cross, and RSI is in a choppy condition. Is in choppy condition also the Daily chart. Why did you enter? Attached Image (click to enlarge) USDJPY 1H Your entry is well before the emas cross and other than that the 4H and the Daily were both in choppy RSI conditions. Why did you enter? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Thanks

Forexcaby here, I am a newcomer to the forums, but have been stalking all of you for about 5 months now. I have learned how to trade through these forums, so firstly let me express my thanks and gratitude to all those that take their time to respond to questions &amp; teach their methods. I do have a question to those using this method, I have read through all the pages but didn't find the answer I was looking for, and forgive me if it was, I must have missed it. My question is what if the MA's cross going long but the RSI hasn't crossed over 55 yet, but 6 hours later it crosses over and it is still in an uptrend. Do we enter or do we wait for another entry when the RSI is breaking or is over the 55 at the same the MA's cross? Also, just to clarify, for short positions we only enter if it breaks under the 45 on the RSI correct?

--- 帖子 #291 ---
When the RSI`s closed above/under- then we look for EMA cross. So we dont care about entering till RSI crossed.

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Okay thanks! So always look at the RSI first. Gotcha, thank you ralf86 !

--- 帖子 #293 ---
I was thinking the same, but what about my post #289?

--- 帖子 #294 ---
I considered I dont have the right answer to your question.I think its better TEB answers to that, sorry.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Hey guys, Think that TEB63 use a lot discretion and experience in this system,thats why he sometimes have different entries and exits,but if you sticks to the rules from post 1 that he describes you will be good in long runs.More important factor for him is to enter in trade which offers good RRR and posibility for price to move. Indies present him compass what to look but experiance and posibility,SD zones,SR and PA gives him edge! This is how I see it,maybe I am wrong. Wish you green pips! Regards!

--- 帖子 #296 ---
I think youre totally right. MM &amp; RRR ist most important. This system is good to watch for an entry but we cant forget that EXITS play also a very important roll.

--- 帖子 #297 ---
On the 1st post Teb said (in part) 1. 5 EMA breaks over 12 EMA - (Retracement) 2. Price breaks over or is over the 55 Level on the 20 RSI (Trend) To me "price breaks over or is already over", means it does not mater which order these occur, only that they have both occurred. Please tell me if I am reading this wrong.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
I think its better it CLOSES above/under...

--- 帖子 #299 ---
needs to be closed when the candle closes is the RSI already over Or does the RSI close over as the candle closes. always closed

--- 帖子 #300 ---
My charts were a little different - I stay to the rules

--- 帖子 #301 ---
Hi Guys one of the things about this system it keeps you out of chop If you look at the market we have been in chop on almost every pair since April 14 or some pair April 15 this is a really long long time to range ......(other then summer or over the Christmas holidays) ie. the AudUsd had just one move if you take out that one move it is flatter then the Eur. chart when people trade in these time, its when people lose a lot of money. I think every one is waiting to see what happens in Russia,

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Yup

--- 帖子 #303 ---
It's a simple method that seems to work. It's similar to the Bagovino Method http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=7603 but has a major difference. I'm not sure there's much more to discuss other than people's trades. Bagovino says, "This method is proven to be at least 85% accurate!". I wonder what win rates people get with TEB's version?

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Don't know why sometimes good thread are not so frquented.... The most tricky part of this system (as all other systems) are SL and TP placements. Hope TEB will be around...

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Something similar to Sidus, try the indicator in the post, if you like http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=278517 Cheers

--- 帖子 #306 ---
TEB63 how would you manage a trade like this? Would you exit after seeing such a strong bullish reverse candle? would you exit because RSI crossed back above 45? I got short @ the yellow arrow once RSI crossed below 45 and how is my stop placement? If this a good area to place it or I am asking for it to get hit here? thanks in advancee.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
if this is the smallest time frame of the 3 charts no I would let it ride if its one of the others two then I would cheers

--- 帖子 #308 ---
you are right

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Hey TEB, don't disappear anymore, your thread needs you.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Anyone still using this method !!! Just for the sake of conversation ... this thing does look to be working well.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
For any one interested I have compiled all the rules/what Pairs/Times to watch charts into one PDF along with TEB's many Trace Examples, and his answers to all of the questions I thought were important to include in the PDF.

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Nice.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
thanks alot for your work...

--- 帖子 #314 ---
Nice thread TEB......... use of the rsi is interesting. What happens if you substitute with Adx?

--- 帖子 #315 ---
I dont think the adx would be a good replacement as it just tells you moment for the current move(bullish or bearish) while the RSI tells us the trend. It could maybe be added on with the system but this is not the thread to talk about addons/modifying the system. please read 1st thread again

--- 帖子 #316 ---
I do not think ADX would be a great idea - But a more simple tool would work CCI, Stoch ETC

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Just and Idea - in the summer slow time must have a very safe system

--- 帖子 #318 ---
@TEB . . . a trend, a target, a tool, a trigger . . . know S.E.T . . . RRR . . . These words haunt my head day and night !! plus my own strength weakness analysis (wish to know yours, but I have some clues ) +70 real pips, waiting TP or TS, really I don´t care, I´m following rules. thank you TEB edit: TP hit (+100) did I mention tks TEB?

--- 帖子 #319 ---
I trade your system once in a while, but I trade with ranges bars, also I use your RSI settings and overlay the ADX won't enter unless ADX is moving up.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Good stuff. Thanks Guys.

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Is someone using this system? It's profitable? I'm searching an intraday/medium term trading strategies and this method sound interesting. Any feedback? Sorry form my bad english and the questions

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Teb has started 72 threads in his time, so he tends to move on from one to another. You can presently find him here: http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=461578 He is well worth following.

--- 帖子 #195 ---
someone asked the win rate on this was I do not trade it anymore but I look up my stats This was from a few years ago Again, I so not trade this system anymore if you are use a 1 to 3 RRR and use good candles/Bar triggers (inside and pin are the best) if you use 1 time frame about 48% if you use 2 time frames about 55% if you use 3 time frames about 59% I think is a very good starter / learning system! In some ways its still my favorite child lol cheers teb

--- 帖子 #196 ---
By the way if someone is learning forex using the 20RSI to keep on the right side of the market is the best tool I ever used other then price action cheers TEB

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Hey Teb,do u use still today your MTF methods with stochastics? Thanks

--- 帖子 #198 ---
TEB, please post a chart example of 3 time frames

--- 帖子 #199 ---
This system loss so many opportunity. It should be tweaked to make more good signal.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
Thanks Teb. I noticed you used the H1 and M5 together, usuallly it is H1 to M15. Does this set of time frames work better....... have you experimented with different time frames?

--- 帖子 #201 ---
use what ever you like I aam not really using this system any more 3 time are better then two time frames but the 1 hour and 5 mins get a lot more trades. once you get good with managing your trades it works well ie, MM and a goof RRR are the key

--- 帖子 #202 ---
sure what ever you like I like simple

--- 帖子 #203 ---
see the 1st few posts I this thread

--- 帖子 #204 ---
thanks for the system : ) a few questions for you: i) do you ever use three profit targets or just two ii) aside from using tagets from H4 and D1, do you ever use fibs with this system and if so are they 50/100/200/400?
