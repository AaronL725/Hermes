2017 UPDATE: I pride myself on posting charts before the fact, and followers will know my accuracy is incredibly impressive, HOWEVER and I DO stress, I do not want this thread becoming a signal service, I URGE all users to make posts and contribute to supply and demand rather than just profiting from the charts I post.

hi, many may already know me here from posting in James16 thread, and Rockys Trading made simple with no lagging indicators thread.

Ive had some nice success mixing these 2 techniques together, and have now created a free to join room on Skype to discuss trading ideas from 5 min timeframes for scalping all the way up to daily etc for longer term trades. I have also added a LIVE trading webinar room with a view of my live desktop as i trade right on front of your eyes.

alot of traders ask other traders that have created a method/system that claim its profitable to ask to see thier statements to see if they are really profitable and telling the truth, notice how they NEVER show you a statement, all they have to do is black out account number and show, but they never do. I GO ONE BETTER!!! i dont show you my printed statement I show you my live screen with my live account all loaded and logged in to see my balance profits trades taken whatever you want!!! IM honest and genuinely profitable and have the live proof

I took a short from eurgbp last night for an easy 50 pips using these combined methods.

Ive since started to scalp using the same technique on 5 min tf, and found something interesting, that the 50 and 61 retraces of a long move on 5 min tf mixed with a supply or demand zone are very well respected for an easy 10-15 quick pippies.

The other method is exactly the same supply and demand, using 1 hour and up for set targets which is even more succesful than the scalping

So lets share ideas and even take trades together in the group.

Going forward I will be sharing my trading over on twitch at www.twitch.tv/deankenny

So please come along join in, it's free. A sub is available if you would like, but not mandatory.

I now believe the ANYMEETING recordings have expired, but a follower of mine managed to record around 2 and a half hours of footage from my recordings, which I shall link below.

UPDATE MID 2016

As many know I had to abandon my sharing and livestreams for the funds I traded for a large Canadian Record Company, in my contract was areas that did not allow me to share or livestream my trading no more.

As of mid 2016, after a good many years trading the funds, I am back  Trading my own funds and also some private funds within the UK.
I hope to become once more active again within this thread and share everything I have gained in knowledge since trading the large fund account.

The webinars and livestreams I did back in 2011, was one of the most transparent seen on FF, not only did I have my trading account on full show, I had everything I did on show, facebook, twitter, writing emails to family, people literally lived my life with me as an upcoming trader. I was a taxi driver at the time and the account opened at $200, when I left to trade funds the account stood at $4,265.44

I am trying to figure a way to once again do these transparent streams again, however, although I am not bothered by followers seeing how much money I have in my own account, since I trade private funds, from family members, to businesses, I cannot of course show these on the screen, so I am figuring a way round this to get something set up.

Proof of trading: Now this is an annoying one, my whole point was never to cherry pick and show everything live, this is why I livestramed it, nothing can show proof better than a livestream as it happens, the webinars were saved I thought forever, upon clicking them today it seems they do not work  Many of my original followers will remember my early success and please chime in if you can, also if any of my early followers have screenshots, or even recorded my streams please get them posted up or mailed to me so I can put them up on page 1 for new followers to the thread.

My bread and butter is using daily charts with monthly and weekly areas marked, and 4 hr for entry. My original scalping method I started this thread of was used to show quickly the success of supply and demand without waiting hours for setup, the scalping of course still works to this day, but as a longer term trader I personally trade the higher timeframes.

HOW YOU WILL ALWAYS BE ONE STEP AHEAD LEARNING SUPPLY AND DEMAND

With all these examples and teachings I make, I will always use a "LIVE" chart. Not a chart picked out from history.

So I bet many of you guys/gals here will have seen a method or teaching using candlestick formations/patterns. Waiting for price to hit support or resistence creating a pinbar for confirmation then clicking buy/sell.

Now please see the chart below, we see the red line, which most teaching would say is resistence now turned to support. As price goes back down to this line we can see a lovely demand level, we know buy orders are sitting there in some quantity, small or large we don't know, but we know for a fact as S and D traders that here buy orders reside. Now as a supply and demand trader we would buy here and enter a long trade. For most other traders they would see this pinbar/hammer form and get in the trade much much later, infact over 30 pips later!!!!!! currently the supply and demand trader would be 50 pips in profit, while the candlestick trader would be alot less in profit and probably not close to a position to move sl or take profits. At 50 pips us supply and demand traders have at least already moved our SL to breakeven and now we have a "RISK FREE" trade.

Go and look for yourself, go away now and look at your charts, look for these candlestick formations, then look left, I assure you this will really open your eyes

--- 帖子 #2 ---
Look at this, i marked  a supply zone, and as i attached the fib look what happened a retrace of 61.8 fell dead on accurately with the beginning of my zone, coincidence, i dont think so

If price reaches this level fast rather than ziggy zaggy its a definite sell to me, aiming for 10-15 easy pips, stop to BE as soon as i can

hey buddy

cant see your pics. can you please upload them again.

thx.

--- 帖子 #4 ---

--- 帖子 #5 ---
no pic

Thanks for sharing I look forward to this thread

--- 帖子 #6 ---
there we go should be fixed now

--- 帖子 #7 ---
if you see my above pic i called this before it took place i went long on the top of that bottom blue highlighted area which is demand and i got the easiest 13 pips in mins. Stop at BE now with quarter of my lots left in

--- 帖子 #8 ---
This has moved alot more since i uploaded this pic, go check M5 eurusd check for yourself, i just got some EASY PIPS right in front of your eyes, all called before the event!!

--- 帖子 #9 ---
And there you go!!!!

im nearly 50 pips up started off as a scalp trade, and now profiting ridiulously because my sl was so small im about 5-1 reward risk here

and as i type its moving up even more!!

Too easy, you want to watch systems where people show you examples after it happened no problem, this is the real deal here, balls on the line trading called and zones marked out before the event!!

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Hey Dean

What are your thoughts on this one?

--- 帖子 #11 ---
yes good, if you look at my chart that zone is just above the zone i have marked, zones on top of zones = more chance of success, if price breaks thorugh my highlighted zone i would then look at the reaction in the zone you have marked, and if nothing happens i will pull out.

But lesson here, zone on top of zone =  more chance of success

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Yes, thats a good odds enhancer.

I am glad you started a thread with this supply/demand methodology. THere seems to be so few good threads on the topic

--- 帖子 #13 ---
if anyone is looking to sell here, dont be too greedy, because we are sat right on a DAILY DEMAND ZONE. so shorting on top of that reduces probability, so i wouldnt look for many pips off that scalp, just remember you have to bear the bigger picture in mind.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
the free trading room is growing min by min, at a rate i didnt expect, very popular.

interesting lesson i just told in the room i will share on here

someone mention elliot waves, here was the reply, and basically a lesson to you all!

"i was once in a trading room with a trader who traded elliot waves.

he was like here is 3rd wave up it will move as much as second wave moved up, i was like but we are coming right into supply, and what happened his move failed and my supply zone took over and went short

simple as that, the market works through supply and demand, its supply and demand that creates the waves, REMEMBER THAT!!!!"

--- 帖子 #16 ---
which leads me to have to say this i quoted in the room

"ppl create all these systems about support resistence, channels, waves etcetc what you got to remember is supply and demand doesnt create one thing, but all the things i mentioned and everything else in the market, if you can identify supply and demand thats all you need"

--- 帖子 #17 ---

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #22 ---
here we go another EASY scalp, i have already taken an easy 7 pips on this with stop at BE

this was called before the event took place, i do not cherry pick!!! look above!!

you can trade with systems that show u EXAMPLES after the even making them look all pretty, or you can come here, where we put our BALLS ON THE LINE and call the zone before hand, price bounce AGAIN second time in a row in the last couple hours to the pip right at the zone for an easy 7 pips.

Best thing is for me, stop is now at BE and could get a ride up, pips are banked and the rest is a free trade, EASY!

now all you elliot wave fans, look at my chart above, can you now see SUPPLY AND DEMAND is creating the waves, by the time you elliot guys entered a trade im already in it and in the positive for 10 pips

--- 帖子 #24 ---
short from supply i just made the quickest 9.2 pips you guys can ever dream of, my supply area was called a couple hours ago now, just reached it and spiked back down FAST!!!!!!!! hows that for accuracy for you, what more do you need, i should be charging for this!!

chart update to follow

--- 帖子 #25 ---
heres my call i called 2 HOURS AGO!!!!!!!

best bit was i was long from the demand and instantly reversed short at supply took profits on my long, and then got a further 9.2 pips on this going short

what more do you guys want, im giving money away here!!!!!

remember guys, 100% accuracy on 3 calls i made today on a 5 min time frame, we all know how hard low time frames are, so imagine the pips you can make doing the same from a daily time zone.

scalping is hard for anyone, but it can be made easier by looking at the pure and simple imbalance of supply and demand.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
guys you are sending me alot of pm's.

again, a 6 pip bounce, i took 5 pips from it and stop to be on remainder, 4 trades 4 profits. 100% accuracy.

Remember im not greedy i will take profits on first bounce up to and above 5 pips. Because zones will break down sometime otherwise market will stay between 2 zones forever

--- 帖子 #30 ---
ANOTHER EASY TRADE !!!! right here

we dont chery pick, we call before zones are reached look above, price entered zone and quickly got rejected i was out for over 5 pips within 1 min. Stop at BE and if she rides higher she rides, dont bother me now its a free trade for me from here.

4 trade and 4 wins, all called in advance, 100% accuracy on 5 min timeframe

dont watch these other systems that rely on supply and demand and show you pretty hindsight charts this is the "BALLS ON THE LINE" approach.

This has been free money right here since i created this thread, with hardly any drawdown, my worst drawdown was -3 pips today

once a zone gets breached delete that zone as its no longer valid, this keeps your charts clean, and only shows you clean profitable areas

--- 帖子 #32 ---
first zone bounced and got profit, now breached but reached another demand zone. remember this is the 2nd touch of the zone, so % of win gets less BUT a trader in my room took this and made some more VERY EASY PIPS!!!!!

This zone was marked out around an hour ago

Hey Dean

I use Sam Seidans S and D but not purely on its own - I combine with other things (trend, PA etc)

The problem I always had when I demoed it was I felt a little blind - i.e I was  trading bounces and zones - which can get tricky esp. as price tends to ignore  certain areas

Anyway, fair play to you for offering to help others

Anthony

--- 帖子 #34 ---
The zones cause the bounces thats what we are looking for, if you adapt it properly, its all play sailing from there, as seen already

i dont show pretty hindsight charts showing what i did yesterday, i show my zones hours before price reaches it, and every zone i mark reacted today.

--- 帖子 #35 ---
one of our traders just took this and got around 20 pips out of this zone

Hey, I have the following levels marked currently where price has not been. Let me know what you think.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
not bad, what we want to see is a surge of red bars out the area, the first one had a small green bar quite soon, so i would be weary, also the bottom of a supply zone is taken from the "BODY" of the last green candle and the top of the zone is the candle of that wick

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Good good, I learnt something new from that post.

--- 帖子 #39 ---
a lesson im teaching as we speak, this usd cad 5 min demand zone was good for 3 touches, 100's of pips made here on 3 touches, first touch went for nearly 90 pips!!! with a 20 pips Stop loss, now that good enough risk reward for you.

Each time it touches less buyers are here, think simple, each time it touches more buyers are filled! so when it comes back there are less found at the level, this chart and analysis is gold in itself, please look at it, its worth more than a thousand forex books teaching you crap!!!

also a nice move off the supply zone on the same pair, for you guys that trade pins, this is what causes the pins, now you can get in before the pin forms.

hi dean,

thanks for starting this! looking forward to finding lots of good setups...

--- 帖子 #42 ---
one we discussing in the room, a new supply formed on the usdcad, so lets do a fib on this one too

so i did a fib study of latest move, and well worked out exactly as i planned, 76.4 was the retrace that landed in the zone and price bounced off it for perfection, im up quite a few pips now, stop at BE free trade from here.

Can it be any simpler ????

thats 7 out of 7 winners for me today on 5 min frame, 5 of these were all called before they happened, and more were called in room.

now let me tell why i DO NOT USE SUPPORT AND RESISTENCE

see chart below

see the first 3 bounces, ppl would call this support, NO biggest mistake in trading this isnt support its demand, now look on the 4th touch price broke through!!

ppl looking at support would be shouting everyone to go short, " ooo its closed below support go short go short"

" its broken support signal to go short"

NO NO NO NON NOONONO do not go short through supply and demand i know its in a demand area and i would go the opposite way, and I WOULD BE THE WINNER, not you support and resistence people.

REMEMBER SUPPLY AND DEMAND CREATES WHAT PEOPLE SEE AS SUPPORT AND RESISTENCE, JUST LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE MARKER

1st chart question.

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Shorting opportunity on EURJPY. Let me know whats good or bad about that one

--- 帖子 #46 ---
not a zone fro me, as price did not leave this zone violently enough for me to eye it as a zone, i need to have a clear eye of price moving away from a zone rapidly for it to qualify.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
nice spot, but next touch if it gets there will be second touch, look to the left slightly you see this is already an area from a bit earlier, so next touch wil be second touch. ill post my chart of this pair up with my zone to show you

--- 帖子 #48 ---
here we go

as you can see zone was found from earlier, quite clearly just before it, so not a fresh zone no more, but none the less if we saw this earlier and did that fib retrace, you see 61.8 falls lovely into that zone, and you would have shorted here for some serious pips!!!!

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Right

so what you're saying is that if a level is itself a bounce off another level, its not fresh anymore?

--- 帖子 #50 ---
correct, more times it touches that level on eurjpy the more sell orders have been filled so there will be less sells waiting there next time, creating more chance of it breaking through, look down too you can see fresh demand working perfectly too for nice pips

if you look even further to the left, is probably the main source of that supply as price come down it went back up one green candle etc and then shot down like a bomb

--- 帖子 #51 ---
i do apologise even i make mistakes, here is the corrected chart

original supply found even further in history, i know its fresh because before it i see price coming down with nothing formed yet until here it stalls then shoots down like a bomb

edit, when i say second touch it means first touch, and third touch means second, again sorry im very simple lol

--- 帖子 #52 ---
i actually went short at 79, at the top of that latest spike on price, as there is a very small supply zone slightly to the left, in this quiet market, is enough to warranty a trade and half out for 6.8 pips stop at Breakeven now. So whatever happens now is all a free trade for me 8 out of 8 for me now today on the 5 min timeframe.

Hi Dean

Really nice charts and explanations your posting.  Followed  you guys over from rockys thread, and still trying to get my mind around this style of trading.  So apologizes if I lurk a while longer until i have something to contribute.  But Again Nice charts

Take Care

--- 帖子 #54 ---
Here are my 2 charts with intraday levels.

(faisal)

--- 帖子 #55 ---
nice eyeing there, only thing i would say is your supply on eurusd is found all the way to the left of the chart, if you look at stall and major drop, the drop you shown as supply wouldve been the trade i entered, look to the left, it wont take long for you to eye the level as it matches up with the level you first marked out

infact thats the trade we took live in the room, and the zone i marked out earlier in this thread hour before it even reached that zone

--- 帖子 #56 ---

all happening live for asian session in room, area called for a scalp, price was only 2 pips away from area called before retreating for an easy 6-7 pip scalp easy easy, thats how accurate these zones can be.

[00:49:39] Dean Guile: getting an early reaction here, be carfeful

[00:49:44] Dean Guile: sellers may have done this early

[00:50:35] Dean Guile: we see reaction at the zone

[00:50:40] Dean Guile: just as predicted

[00:51:41] Dean Guile: so close to my short

[00:51:59] Dean Guile: 3516 would be my entry price hit 3514 and spike for an easy 5-6 pips

[00:52:23] Dean Guile: if anyone got in and took it for 5-6 pips well done

[00:52:46] Dean Guile: u see badass, i how accurate the zones

[00:52:47] Dean Guile: are

[00:52:59] Dean Guile: 3516 i marked, 3514 only 2 pips away was the reaction and stall

[00:54:03] Dean Guile: supply holding here

--- 帖子 #64 ---
how did you determine 3416 was your mark?

[00:57:13] Dean Guile: thats what i will teach you in the coming weeks badass

[00:58:14] Dean Guile: hehe, price moved rapid up to the zone and has stalled right on it give or take 2 pips

[00:58:35] Dean Guile: that kicks support and resistence traders any day of the week

[00:59:02] Dean Guile: and now moving down

[00:59:39] Dean Guile: low as 3504 now, thats 10 pips right there, markets giving them away at these zones

[01:00:18] Dean Guile: if u check my ff thread u will see 3516 marked as a zone on my first post in the thread hours and hours earlier today

[01:00:33] Forex Bada$$: As a support and reiststance trader this is where I would start looking for a buy entry

so what you say is we go short from 1.3507 upto 1.3475??

--- 帖子 #67 ---
no we do not go short, how can we go short at a demand level thats what the novice trader does, how do i know its demand, well because its BELOW current price.

i suggest going through the whole thread, if you have, then i suggest going through again

we sell at supply

we buy at demand

--- 帖子 #68 ---
There we go again!!

unfrotunately my order did not get filled by a mere couple pips but the zone was just missed, but you can see the strength near the area marked for a nice quick easy move up, easy money for everyone.

This area was marked way before this bounce happened look above

ive had pm's galore this evening begging me to to teach them, listen im no forex guru, i just look at the obvious, its so easy once you click please follow and join the room and you will see, i cant teach 1 on 1 would be too much for me so just join the group and get a feel for it.

--- 帖子 #70 ---
well im coming close to 100 pip profit today so close to calling it a day as far as trading goes, an excellent first day in the live room, traders grabbing pips from all angles, some even grabbing some off zones they marked themselves. another day another dollar as they say

--- 帖子 #71 ---
another trader took a long off a zone marked out over an hour ago, he grabbed some very easy pips!! all happening live

[03:11:18] Andrew Sym: yeah...and since u take so many trades a day, t can add up without increasing the risk per trade

[03:11:21] Dean Guile: all good traders lose, too. remember Manchester United won the league last season, but they also lost games along the way

[03:12:03] Andrew Sym: closed long for +5 on that one

[03:12:26] Dean Guile: what trade was that Andrew

[03:12:35] Dean Guile: my zone on eur usd

[03:12:38] Andrew Sym: EU

[03:12:43] Dean Guile: i see price come near it again and went up

[03:12:50] Andrew Sym: from that 3510 area

[03:12:53] trublu: the way they're playing they might not lose this season

[03:12:55] Darryl: Yes. or 2% on 1% risk. All I'm saying you know your not going to sink even if you lost 3 in a row.

[03:13:05] Dean Guile: yes Andrew excellent trade well done

[03:13:19] Andrew Sym: thanks

Just wanted to say thanks for starting this thread. Trying to learn this stuff. I have posted a picture. I would like to know if I have marked this correctly. I appreciate any help you can offer and thanks. Also I dont have skype but would love to join. Never used it lol.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
not bad at all, the top area supply, may need to be confirmed because we didnt get much stalling, we want a little stall to give us our balance to shock imbalance!!

the demand areas below seem good, u see that first area already had 2 very near touches for some nice pips

the area below is roughly correct, need to be adjusted a little but you got the idea, im creating a new chatroom not on skype where its easier, and i can get on voice and will be easier to call zone and trades im taking.

--- 帖子 #74 ---
The top one is confusing to me. I thought it was the best one. Can I ask you where you would put it. Also thanks for the help. I do appreciate it very much. If you dont have time I understand. That would be awesome if we can get to a room without using skype. Let me know when its around and would love to hook up with yall and learn. Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
no probs, if you get a area like that, what you do is move down a TF to 1 min in this case, and you can see price action much clearer and where it was balanced, simple as that i marked the zone here on 1 min, move back up to 5 min and bamn you got your zone. That would be a nice short from up there for a few quick pippies.  its a nice fresh looking zone

Frickin sweet. I see it now haha. Adjusted the one you told me need a little tweaking and its identical. Thats a good sign. Thanks so much for the help.

Quick question. When you say breach the zone we elimnate it. Does the candle have to close through the zone or does a long wick through the zone eliminate it also even if it heads back the direction we wanted it too?

--- 帖子 #77 ---
rules for this differ trader to trader, to me if price is able to push right through a zone and breach the other side, close or not i take away the zone, as its not safe to trade anymore, as sellers or buyers in this zone are not in the same area as first predicted, so i delete the area, and search for more.

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Appreciate the help and answering of my questions. I will note that and eliminate zones like you are doing.

--- 帖子 #79 ---
remember, i need to stress this alot

as soon as we are up 5-7 pips stop is moved to BE that is a rule set in stone for me, i start booking some of my trade, and if the market wants to run it can run the rest of the way with my remaining position. If not then no problem breakeven is fine with 5-7 pips banked on some of the position.

alot of people hope and hole on while ive already collected pips and been stopped on rest at BE

We are only looking for a reaction at the zone, not for a swing

remember " WE ARE NOT LOOKING FOR A SWING"

just a reaction of 5-7 pips or so, and if a swing occurs, then bamn the pips come rolling in thick and fast

--- 帖子 #80 ---
I am on board with ya. I love this strategy. In and out and its how I like it. I hate holding a trade for a longtime and why I hate the H1 and up. Going to practice. Have noticed on the chart we worked on together the lower zone has the 50 fib running through the middle. So thats a pretty good one.

--- 帖子 #81 ---
hi dean, any ideas on upmove or downmove?

price making real nice wedge and possible bear flag later.

my ichis say buy, so im scalping 10 pips buy.

also possible dragon.

--- 帖子 #82 ---
im going to bed soon, so not picking any more i missed the last move upwards on eu by 1.8 pips, nice move up off my demand zone marked on eurusd. But im close on 100 pips today for scalping so im more than happy

--- 帖子 #83 ---
yea you will notice most zones will have a fib of some sort, confluencing with it, also i do trade long term trades, some for weeks taking the market for 400 pips or so, but im showing 5 mins trades because i can show more to ppl faster  just the power this technique has

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Sweeet!!! Got out with 15 pips. Didn't manage trade like I should but happy it worked so was a little gun shy and got anxious.

The middle blue line of my chart is a zone off the M1. It comes off a fib so I like it.  The top one is where i want it to eventually go so we can go short. If it passes that top zone look on the M15 and they have a nice one sitting there for a short. Trust me you can see it. For now it passed through the bottom demand zone so its canceled. It may retest it and shoot back up. But won't take it since the rules say eliminate it if it breaches the zone. Its not as strong anymore. Anyway enough of my rambling just want to give some heads up on possible next areas of interest on the EU.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
Thanks Deankenny for starting this thread, will go thru Sam Sieden's videos and Rocky's thread this weekend and will start posting my learning charts, It's really great you are maintaining the spirit by showing live charts, it gives us great confidence to trade this way.   Thanks again..

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Thanks Deankenny for getting this under way. Love to join you guys get skype set up this weekend. Will follow along on the thread till then.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
I see your an Aussie. Im a Kiwi good to see you joining in mate. This is as close as you will get to the holy grail of trading.

You will learn a heap from Deankenny and the others just keep an open mind.

Hello members,

Just start my day with +10 pips on eurusd (Bought 1.3514 closed +10 pips)..

Here is a link for SD traders about selecting good zones.
http://www.tradingacademy.com/lesson...ed_article.htm

hope this will help

--- 帖子 #89 ---
thank God. I thought I was a retard for picking that zone for a minute there. I chickened out with 3 pips hehe.I bought in at 35169 and closed on that same candle. Here is the zones I have. Only issue I am having is entering. I missed that first touch because I had a sell limit at the top of the zone. I am not sure if I am doing it right but I feel its a conservative way to allow a small stop loss even if I miss a trade. Whats your thoughts about entering?

--- 帖子 #90 ---
This is a little hidden gem I found recently posted on another forum. its Sam S. Odd Enhancer's he teaches his students to rate Supply and Demand zones. If I need to remove this post I will just let me know.

PROBABILITY ENHANCER

Score

Max Score

Strength of the Move

Strength of the move (max 2): How did prices leave the level: strong fashion, or a more gradual move away from the level. Gives clues to supply and demand imbalance at the level. Strongest turn in price level is where supply and demand is most out of balance. So our quest is to look for price levels where supply and demand is most out of balance. The biggest clue in how in balance or out of balance prices are at a level, is how quickly they leave. The more quickly they move, the more out of balance they are.

2

Reward/Risk

1. How far did prices rally up from demand level before coming back to it. That is initial profit margin.

2. If buying at support or demand, where is the nearest area of supply. If risking 20 cents on trade, is nearest supply level 60 cents or farther away? If not, we are not interested in the trade.

Support and demand levels all around, we only want to take the best.

2

Big Picture

Looking at daily charts for big picture. Most of Sam's trades are intraday, but he still looks at daily chart for big picture. Big picture is important to day trader for two reasons:

1. big picture trend up or down - determines which side we want to be on

2. Where are big picture support and demand levels? We dont want to short right above a demand level. We only know that from the big picture.

If we are taking shorter time frame short positions in context of a big down trend, then this gets a 2. If we are shorting during a bigger picture uptrend, and we are close to big picture support, it is a 0 or a 1.

2

Retracements / Tests

We may look at this different than conventional wisdom. Once prices have left a level, (example of picture explanations), sell zone with a lot of candles - we want to enter on the first retracement, it is highest probability entry. First time entry is a 2. second time is a 1. Third time is a 0.

This is all just motion into mass. The mass is the supply and demand, the big stack of orders.

Chopping tree example: Every swing removes some of the mass. The more swings, the more chance to go through.

2

Time at Level

Very much in line with first enhancer - strength. At price levels with supply and level out of balance the most, price will spend the least amount of time at the level. The textbooks talk about this in the opposite way.

At price levels with the most imbalance, price will spend the least amount of time: few candles.

If price is in balance, price will stay there a long time. it is equilibrium, we dont want to trade there. We want to trade at the extremes.

Question: How many candles in what time frame: Be very careful about coming up with a specific number. Changing time frame will change the number of candles. At your time frame, compare the number of candles to time spent at other levels, dont get hung up on specific number.

1

Arrival

How did price arrive come back to the level. We want to be anywhere near other levels. We don't want new resistance levels before we buy, or new support levels to form right before we sell. Strong arrival usually means strong departure at the level.

1

Total score:

The worst possible case is an 8 - This can be a confirmation entry.

Here are the scores:

If it was a 9 or 10, it could be a limit order. - limit order

8 - confirmation entry

7 - No trade if less than 7

Another odds enhancer for short term traders: Time of day that trade is meeting entry. The opportunities that we point out that meet entry in first 45-1 hour of the day, these are usually golden opportunities. Later in the day is often not as great.

Coming from the institutional side of trading, you know, because you see the order flow. Time of day odds enhancer is, in any market, supply and demand is most out of balance at or near the opening of trading in any market. I saw this day after day. Given that, if you are good at picking out levels and turning points, those will be most profitable. If entering in the first hour of the day, the best day traders make their money in the first hour of the day. I don't know anyone who makes money just trading in the afternoon. If they are trading in the afternoon, they didn't make money in the morning, and it will be tougher. After all the orders get processed, usually supply and demand are back in balance.

If you dont know what you are doing, don't trade at the open. But if you do, trade because that is the time when most of the transfer between accounts occurs. Morning is the golden opportunity.

that was a quick 10 pips..... u can be conservative with entereing on top/bottom of zone but this can give u less chances.. and high chances of clearing the zone... look at my chart below it shows the power of touch trade.

--- 帖子 #92 ---
nice article

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Hey Shogeki, Dean and others.

I've been lurking around Rocky's thread for the last few weeks and was a little dissapointed when he said he wont be contributing to often but it's good to see that Dean is picking up where he left off. I'm only new to this world hence why I've never had much to say on here but I'm just trying to gather as much decent infomation that I can then add when i actually know what I'm talkin about. I would like to join the Skype group but i think everyone is in bed when I'm online

Cheers Burkey

--- 帖子 #94 ---
I see and thanks. Missed that GU mark on my chart. I have mine marked around the 5400 area. I will play around with it. I need to practice more because I am just not comfortable with me identifying the zones correctly.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Hey everyone, well this is exploding quite quick, the room has become extremely popular over the past 12 hours or so.

A few answers from some posts i read, no im not an Aussie lol, im from England, someone in the room thought i was from Massachessets last night too, so dont know where everyone getting these crazy ideas from ;P

Pips26, well done you are making pips using the power of this technique already, you dont realise how that makes me feel to watch other people gaining from my teachings, its a wonderful feeling

For the person who posted the odds enhancers from Sam Seiden, absolutely excellent, every just copy and paste that, put it down on Word, print off a load of copies, and start going through it before each trade, its magic trust me.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
It just need practice after some time u will be comfortable with it... i m trying to get more and more hand on it...

btw: 5400 is a good zone

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Hey Dean how u doing??

sorry for today i will join u late in room as i have some issue with my skype.

thnx for ur words really enjoying it.. i m not a daytrader/scalper but trading this stuff really makes some stuff.

--- 帖子 #98 ---
Hey deankenny21, if you add a dollar index chart to your arsenal you will be on point even more tick for tick,only live chart i know is with forexpros click on advance chart put it side by side with  any eur/usd chart (negative correlation) to confirm that you are right !!!!

--- 帖子 #99 ---
Im not really a scalper either, I tend to look for the daily setups, but it works on all timeframes, so I wanted to open peoples eyes to the simple way the market works, forget your fancy indis, forget your macds and rsi gobedygook. All them follow one thing, they follow thier master, and thier master is Supply and Demand

--- 帖子 #100 ---
even better  - just go to sam seidans videos / webinars - spend a few months watching them and add them to your trading

he is at online trading academy

--- 帖子 #101 ---
forgot to add

totally agree with taking indis etc off your charts

they just blind traders to whats going on

--- 帖子 #102 ---
someone said something very interesting they noticed it happen right in front of thier eyes on a 5 min chart, so i thought be excellent to add an explantion here of what he saw. THis person is , well now was an elliot wave trader, befroe trading blind into waves he can now see when the waves will break, and i will show you.

Notice the first supply below, alot of buyers now sat there, price comes down again and of course as we know shoots up, each time it shoots up, it shoots up at a higher price because the buy orders are getting larger at this demand zone earlier, and this creates you upwards wave pattern

Now its got to end sometime hasnt it, you betcha!!! and you can clearly see when, as price goes up in waves it then hits a very nice fresh looking supply and BAMN!!!!!!! the waves have been broken, picking up a lovely fresh set of sellers now wiping out the all used up buyers

When you see it like this, it all becomes ever so clear.

[12:27:59] Dean Guile: did anyone take it, i called this last night before i went to bed

[12:28:04] Somesh De Swardt: hi dean, thanks for adding me too. Fibs make sense, and I do understand them, just not used them in any live trading ive done, tend to use pivot points and other traditional support lines.

[12:28:17] Dean Guile: its moved 100 pips

[12:28:19] Somesh De Swardt: hello everyone

[12:28:37] Somesh De Swardt: things certainly are kicking off!

[12:29:10] Somesh De Swardt: no, didnt get in on that one

[12:29:24] Dean Guile: i was up waiting for it last nightt but got tired

[12:29:29] Dean Guile: i know a few traders stayed up

[12:29:32] Dean Guile: i hope some caught it

[12:29:39] James aka FrenzyPain: only caught 40 pips

[12:29:46] Dean Guile: NICE JAMES!!!

[12:29:50] Dean Guile: 40 pips is 40 pips

[12:29:55] Dean Guile: on a 5 min chart thats excellent

[12:30:01] James aka FrenzyPain: some got more..i think edward if not mistaken

[12:30:08] Dean Guile: excllent

[12:30:46] Dean Guile: i will post the result on FF for all to see

[12:30:57] Dynel Daytrader: james even 5pips on a M5-Chart is awesome, don't be greedy

[12:31:16] Dean Guile: Dynel, if u did what i said here BE asap, price never came back!!!

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Just keep paper and pencil with u guys..... and note every level

--- 帖子 #106 ---
quoted above was my area to sell, no cherry picking or hindsight here, this was marked out HOURS ago during asia the result of this is below, what a nice move!!!! you can look at other systems that show you examples after the event, or you can come here and see the teachings BEFORE!!! it happens, thats real balls on the line right there.

This is great example of it

--- 帖子 #108 ---
Hi Dean

the chart you posted Dean is great dont you think but the S and D theory of the markets is similar to what James teaches on the Public Forum?

i.e. Old Support breaking and  turning into New Resistance in a downtrend

the good thing is about S and D is that it gets traders to think about the picture behind the price as opposed to having indicators

Anthony

--- 帖子 #109 ---
in a way yes, but you even been caught by a false breakout

i bet you have,  i have not, i can see in supply and demand when it really breaks, i posted it here on ff, hold on i will find the teachings and link the post number to this post

here it is
http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...18#post4979718

now most people would have a support line drawn at the top of my zone as support, it closed below at one point, hahahaha to all you support breaking traders, heres a wake up call for you, check it out

Great Thread DK! Thanks for posting!

Please keep the charts coming as they are fantastic for learning from! It's providing a mental twist to pattern trading that I'm using at the moment. Quite an eye opener!

Thanks!

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Would love to be a part of the fun and I am SO glad I stumbled upon this thread. You don't know how much I appreciate this.

I'm definitely into S&D trading, thanks to the recent introduction to a couple of Sam Seiden's webinars I've seen on the subject, but I've yet to put it to good use as I'm still unsure of my spidey sense.

It makes all the sense in the world, I just need to get a better feel for identifying true S&D zones.

Can you do me a favor? I know indicators can sometimes be a big no, no, especially when trying to identify S&D but I have attached one that seems to do a pretty good job of finding break out zones and I wondered if someone could modify it to find the true S&D on an intraday basis.

One other thing.

Maybe you could put together a few screencast videos.

I use CamStudio, it's free and does a fairly decent job.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Now see, this one really gets my attention. You've identified the supply zone and were confident enough to wait for it to bounce off it before selling???

THEN made a killing!!

I'm a chartist and feel I have a good sense of PA and direction, but not like this.

In fact, now that I think about it, a lot of people like ourselves won't trade when the market has this saw tooth look to it because it's not a "trend" or they haven't learned how to scalp.

I'm really looking forward to this.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
I didn't see a link for Sam's webinars in the thread so here it is.

There are three for S&D.

Hope that helps someone, I'm going over them again this weekend to sharpen my eyeballs.

Greetings Dean,

Kindly refer to your Post# 40, my UsdJpy 15 min chart and our most stimulating discussion that took place this past Friday  in your newly created Skype Trade Room.

With respect  to the Pin Bar(PB) that was forming(watching the PA rise then fall), the question that came to mind was: "what was price actually doing  relative to the Supply Zones(nos. 1,2,&3), one atop the other, compounding its effect on price action and the psychology of the participants at the time?"  Referring to my USDJpy 15 min chart is my analysis, interpretation, & trade positions of those events and would greatly appreciate your evaluation and comments.

Oh, and btw, none of the aforementioned could have happened had it not been for you initially bringing to my attention(in the trade room) via your analysis of the UsdJpy 5min chart buy scalp trade(which was profitable and instructional to boot!)

Thanks again and looking forward to Sunday's Trade Room...C U THERE!

Great Job Dean, keep up the good work, Rocky...

--- 帖子 #146 ---
yes you starting to get it, my supply zone is my sell, way up near the money, then that creates the pinbar and PA then creating "SENTIMENT" making more people sell, and then we get the bandwagon ppl joining the new trend and riding causing this price to fall, all while i got in virtually near the top

im glad your seeing this way now, good work, keep it up

--- 帖子 #147 ---
Thanks Dean for all the great work that you are doing here, really learning a lot .I was asking if it would be possible to record the webinar .our time zone is gmt +3thus asia time is like 3 am my time.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
Hi, its not a set lesson or education that im doing, so no point in recording it.

Its a trading room, and every oppertunity i see i speak through each one before it happens and after, and there will be plenty of them to keep one busy.

The webinar is not an hour special, its open for as long as im up trading, so should be running tomorrow night from 9pm my for a good 6 to 7 hours, you can join midway through and still see whats going on and the analysis of each trade and what i see.

Here is a zip file with Trailing stop EAs and scalping scripts that can be very useful with the scalping portion of trading.  The top row  are The EAs and the bottom two rows are scripts.

Edit: it looks like it rearranged the Files back in the original order I put them.  I'll take them one by one:

EAs-------

1. Auto visual order editor +sahars   An EA that creates draggable stop loss take profit and break even lines for your trade.  You have to manually open the trade first then the EA takes over with the inputs you put in for your TP, SL and BE

2. MA trailing stop.  After the BE is reached and you take partial profit this EA can trail a stop for you using a Moving average of your choice as the stop.

3. Trailing stop Fractal Candle  An alternative to the MA trail.  Uses candle tops and bottoms or Fractals.

4.SL-TP move by mouse-  A simpler version of the draggable stop loss and take profit lines.  No BE feature or partial Take profit.

Scripts--------

1.  Drop pending buy or sell.  Drag and drop pending buys or sells on supply and demand zones.  If you drag pending buy above spot price it will create a buy stop  if you drag it below spot price it will create a buy limit.  Vice versa with pending sell.

2. Order buy or Order Sell  Scalping scripts that bypass the order confirmation box.  can be set to hot keys to enter market orders quickly.  They have to be modified in metaeditor  to change the lot size,  Stop loss and take profit.  Once modified and compiled they can open trades with a push of a button with a hot key or a double click of the mouse from the navigator menu.

3. Modify stop loss and take profit scripts.  drag to chart and drop on where you want the TP or SL to move to.  Will then redraw the TP or stop loss.  Will not work if EAs on top are running.  The EA will over ride this script

Hi Dean

Congratulations on a great thread, I am looking forward to join you in a few days, as I will be in hospital from tomorrow, I have been following Rocky's thread but still having problems defining the S & D zones, hopefully will be able to come to grips with it soon.

Regards from Perth (OZ)

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Thank you, and yes will be trading all week so gd luck with the hospital and I will be here when you get back

Best regards, Dean

Hey Dean. The key to what you are doing is in your detailed explanations. You are very good of speaking all about what you are thinking. As a rule (I apologize for this generalization) men are not the best at giving up all of the details of any process. Not because of their intentionally withholding information, but simply because this is the way our brains work. If we know something, we assume (that with minimal explaining) that every body knows we are talking about.

You, on the other hand, have done an exemplary job of conveying nearly every nuance of what this set up looks like, tastes like, and smells like. Speaking for myself, and probably many others, I would like you to know how grateful I/we are.

For those just reading this thread that have not spent time yet with our group, I urge you to participate posthaste. Every moment you procrastinate is costing you money. More important than the money, is the knowledge that once acquired, will belong to you for the rest of your life.

Will be late into the room tomorrow. Going to the Saints and texans football game then at work. While at work I am going to hide and get in the room hehe.

I found these little rules and someone may have posted them. The key rule is #1 and has a great explanation. i will say imo minor is what we are looking for scalping so it works for us. If Dean wants me too post the link i will. its a guy starting from scratch on what to do step by step and is noob friendly. Anyway here is the rules I found with good explanations finding S and D.

RULES:

These aren't really rules, but if finding the strong s&d areas is vital, we need some way of determining if it is strong or weak...

Thankfully that is easy too...

1. The areas have to be : rally-base-drop or drop-base-rally

youre looking for places where price turned..... its only minor s&d if price was moving up, went sideways, then continued up.... rally-base-rally is no good!

By all means note these areas, but theyre not what you are looking for... look at area 2 and 1 on the chart again.... rally-base-drop

2. how long did price stay at this area.... a short time is good! this shows there is a big imbalance between s&d

3. how did price leave this area... gap is excellent... but rare.. so we are looking for a strong move away.... area 1 and 2 on the chart again...

4. how far did it go.... this is your profitability

area 2 dropped about 350 pips... we look for at least 3/1 profit, so a sl at area 1 of 100 pips would of been ok...

5. you also want to have a decent amount of time between prices visit to an area, because obviously if price is constantly hanging around the area, then its not meeting rules 2, 3 and 4.

--- 帖子 #158 ---
thanks Nawlins some excellent input there for everybody to take on board. Only thing i would say is rally base rally are also very good tradeable options too, in the correct conditions, alot of trades i did in the room were infact rally base rally trades, as long as they meet the criteria i have had experience with, succesful experience that is, then i will trade it with no problems at all, but again i will go through all this in the room

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Yep totally agree about rally base rally. Especially when rally base rally falls on a Fib it can be a good entry due to confluence. Gives you that extra incentive to say its not minor. If it doesn't fall on a fib then maybe it makes you say welllll I may pass. Up to each individual. I have been getting ah ha moments all weekend. interacting with everyone so far has helped me tremendously but still have a way to go. Thanks Dean for putting together this for all of us to interact. And thanks to everyone else like pip26 who has helped me also. Look forward to this trading week.

Good lad, the odds enhancers can really narrow down a very high probability trade, i recommend anyone trading this method to also do the same, and print off a few copies, and lay it next to you so when you spot a setup fill out the form and see if it recieves a good enough score to trade

no trade for me, price arrived back too early,

remember rule number2 anyone in my room

if price comes shooting back straight away no trade, a area needs to "MATURE" and be away from the area for a while.

no trade for me, if you did trade it, still good for 4 pips. But didnt meet my rules, next one .

THIS trade was right on the money, i personally missed as i was managing another trade, but the area was marked out with a nice 61.8 fib zone running straight through supply, all right on the money!!! am i magician NO, its just the laws of supply and demand.

This area was marked out an hour or so before price had reached the zone

--- 帖子 #186 ---
I have been watching Sam's webinars. A lot of it is rambling. To me if you watch just one of them its got to be this one. Think of the odd Enhancers posted, study Dean's and others charts, be in the chatroom and watch atleast the webinar name An Important Rule To Consider When Scanning For Trading Opportunities In Forex.

Here is the link. To me this is a great one. Just look at the odds enhancers then watch it. It will start to click.

Again Dean thanks buddy, I appreciate everything you are doing for us.

--- 帖子 #187 ---
19 pips. nice. should of stayed in longer....damn it. oh well happy to see it right. there is zones on top of zones. by the way how and the hell do you post trades you have made pips with the little arrows i see on forex factory. it has those little blue and red arrows. beats the hell out of drawing on a chart.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
Wanted to pass along something I learned from Dean and others to help clarify any confusion for anyone struggling. If you read the odd enhancers or Sam's webinars you will see or hear about 3 to 1 Supply and demand zones. So anything 3 to 1 or better is good rather its 4 to 1 ,etc,etc.The link I posted also gives a good explanation of this in the above post. Here is my trade. again 3 to 1 rule. 12 pip blue zone times 3 equals 36 pips. we have 44...good to trade from.

The chart I provided shows how its done. Now can you take smaller than 3 to 1....I am sure. Guys like Dean may but they are way more experienced than me and see things differently. Basically I am not on their level so this is my conservative approach. By sticking to this rule you can find great zones. It will help eliminate any confusion you may have. Once you gain more experience and seeing price action you may become more aggressive. I just wanted to pass along something that helped me learn to find the supply and demand zones. I am no expert by far and still a newbie. Just figured it may help someone who is struggling. Not trying to hijack the thread so I apologize if it looks that way. I am the student still but its my cheat sheet..hehe.

Yes Dean, thank you again

So I din't mark the supply and demand zones. I think it is a good homework for you novice like me to define the zones by your own and to look why I took this trade.

I trade not 100% like Dean, but the same way to determine the zones.

If you like one more chart with the zones, please ask.

Regards

First time in the room and I just wanted to say how nice it was in there.

Dean, your a really nice person and you treated everyone in the room as you probably like to be treated, with respect and dignity.

It was a no pressure learning zone with no smack talking egomaniacs.

Now, onto the trades.

Sorry Dean, I'm not real good about posting results in the room cause I'm so busy trying to listen, watch and learn while still checking the news and baby sitting a few open positions.

Anyway.

EUR/USD +68 on a short that was a bit outside of Dean's parameters. (Spidey Sense, News & S&D)

EUR/USD +65 and on a long totally within the S&D rules

EUR/USD +45 on a using Dean's parameters.

The S&D principles work but it will take me a lot of sessions in the trading room to be spot on with regards to finding those little bastards as fast as Dean does.

It was an absolute pleasure Dean and I'm looking forward to furthering my S&D education tomorrow, and every morning for the foreseeable future.

Now, the question to myself is..

How the hell did I ever live without Fibonacci?

Thanks again!

For those of you just starting out.

Watch the three S&D videos from
Sam Seiden

when he or Dean mentions Odds Enhancers, refer back to this and print it out.

Hello Dean and all members,

My first chart for today

--- 帖子 #232 ---
Good Morning to all,

Be careful trading the EUR today. Meeting beiing held as right now.

Papandreou, Merkel Meet For Eurozone Crisis Talks.

Along with the ECB and German official chatter.

There is also a Greek Parliament vote on Austerity measures today.

Chatter so far can be found here.
http://talking-forex.com/live?code=dBQ869WseBTwk3cHwUz9

P.S. Then there's this bit of USD/JPY Christmas Cheer. If what I've been reading/hearing outside of the official BS is true, we could be looking at a PEG around or over the 100.00 range.

Close your shorts for the next few days.

AND, something else to keep in mind that I'm just beginning to understand and that goes hand in hand with S&D.

Intraday options that are due to expire today at 1500BST (10am NY cut)

FX COMMENTARY

EUR/USD – 1.3475, 1.3500 and 1.3545

USD/JPY – 76.40/50

GBP/USD – 1.5500

AUD/USD – 0.9850

Source: IFR

Tue, 02:40 27-09-2011

The ideal conditions for this method are: Option expiry is at 10 am EST.  Option size is greater than 500 million USD.  The quote is at the strike price before the news release at 8:30 am EST  The news release is not a major event, such as a Fed decision.  But even without the realization of these conditions sizable  profits can be made with this method in a calm and unexcited market. But  these overall conditions, along with the significance of the news  release, are the main determinants of the market’s mood which will in  turn influence our stop-loss and the profit potential.
What happens during an option expiry?
If the price quote is close to the strike price of the option, option  traders and other market participants will attempt to steer the quote  in direction they desire.
A strong sign that the option traders will defend their position is  the early gravitation of the price quote to the strike price. In an  example scenario, if there’s a European EUR/USD vanilla put or call  option with a strike at 1.2540, and the quote is at 1.2570 at 7:30 am,  the quote will be steered to sit on the option strike value at about the  news release at 8:30 am. After that, as the price reacts to the news,  the quote may move away from the strike price in an unwanted. To  successfully profit from this pattern the trader would need to join the  option traders as they try to move the quote back to the strike value,  and since a lot of people play this game the odds of success are quiet  high.

WOW, just been playing with FIB fans confluencing with FIB retrace and SUPPLY OR DEMAND and come across some even more pleasant trading.

Someone mentioned the fan today in the room, the 61.8 seems to work nearly 90% of the time from backtesting on 5min, mix that in with a supply or demand area and a retrace and this could get even more interesting.

I will explain and show at start of tomorrows session, see you all there.

Heres a trade i literally just took, and used the 61.8 fib to buy from rather than trying to measure out in the zone.

I took it for 6.2 pips on 1/3 of my lots

2/3 of my lots is left in with SL at BE

Great work, Dean - keep it going

Having spent the last 48 hrs reading up on Supply & Demand zones, inc Sam Seiden's, I see there are various takes on how these should be drawn (multiple candles, one candle only high to low, upper or lower wick of one candle only etc) : which is your way of doing it, please ?

--- 帖子 #253 ---
price found upper supply level beautifully, notice how we dont get the big bounce off the supply into the blue 61.8 fib fan comes down and touches price, then BAMN!!!!! price reacts hard, i tried to stay up for this one but fell asleep, but still showing how POWERFUL these fans are mixed in with supply and deamand.

and there you go, bounced off the fib fan and bounced hard.

now this is what causes wedges guys, supply and demand is causing price to wedge in, as you can clearly see by my fib fan lines, people are thinking im a mgician or something, nope not at all, i just know how to read supply and demand with fibs.

wedge being cause by latest down move 61.8 fib and supply and and up is being cause by latest up move 61.8 fan line with demand.

I'm new to the forum here but have heard many great things about it.  I've never heard of Supply & Demand in trading but I know the world is run by it so I'm curious to give it a go in trading.

I'm a bit nervous about joining a trading room because I don't know much about fibs and supply & demand but I'm going to put my fear aside and give it a shot.

I want to thank all of the great members on this forum and Dean for starting this thread.  This is my first post on this forum so I'm looking forward to learning a ton of information and hopefully making some money in the process.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Excellent, i tell you what your already at the right place, i wish i started like you rather trying to find the magic indicator, or the never lose robot.

but by starting with supply and demand you will have a better edge straight away than 95% of traders in this business.

As for Sundays webinar, this is all planned and i will book a slot tonight and you will all get the emails of time etc, so look forward to seeing you all there.

Dean

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Oh, I've been down the same roads as you.  I've been trading for a little less than 10 years with no success yet.  I'm refocusing my energy and dedication to my trading.  I've tried millions of indicators but never really believed in robots.

I'm 28 years old but unemployed right now so I will be trading live with just $50.  I'm not concerned about the money right now, I just want to start trading properly and profitably.  My dedication level right now is where it's never been because I look back at the time I've wasted and I'm ready to become the trader that I know I can be.

I look forward to Sunday and I want to say sorry in advance if I ask too many questions on Sunday.  I'm new to Supply & Demand like I said so I want to make sure I understand things properly.  Thanks for the support and being so helpful to not just me but all members on this forum.

Sunday night, will be another question  and answer session, with a look at the week ahead with possible trading  setups that are occuring, look at the weekly charts see what we got  going on. Promises to be a very active evening, and those that stay a  bit longer will trade the Asian Session with me also Sunday Evening.

So i hope to see you all there.

your trader

I too have been lurking in the background and trying to learn, but thought it was about time I took the plunge and made myself a member. I have been into trading for just over a year now, but have been trading very unsuccessfully.

I had not heard of Supply and Demand before, until I came across this thread. So thanks very much Dean for starting it. It looks a truly amazing way of trading and it all makes perfect sense, although I'm still very confused about it all.

I have been in the live room a few times this week and it’s been an eye opener. I have asked a few basic question in there of which have been answered. I have been made to feel very welcome and would like to join you all again when ever work lets me.

I have plotted some zones on the eurusd M5 tf from today the 30th September and was wondering if I could post my chart up here on this thread for you all to have a look at it, and let me know if I'm doing the basics correct or not, but I thought I’d ask before posting it?

Many thanks for all you are doing for a newbie.

Above is my chart. I have a few questions about it of which are as follows;

1. Have I got the zones in the correct place?

2. Are the zones the correct size?

3. Have I got my entries correct?

4. Would the stops be the opposite side of the zone, or would I need to and a few points?

5. Where should my target be?

Please feel free to add any other comments, good or bad. I'm all ears.

Many thanks in advance for answering my questions.

1. Yes looks ok, but deamnd zone 2 the surge away wasnt enough for me to mark it as a demand zone.

2. THis is something i show you in the room, although you got the core of the size correct you can really make it more accurate by moving down timeframee.

3.Cant tell your entry, should be start of any zone.

4. YEs stop at opposite side + cushion to cover spread and volatility.

5. Target should be opposite zone, moving down timeframe will give you clearer view of zones in the opposite direction.

Thanks for you answers Dean. My whole trading Philosophy since first hearing about supply and demand through your thread has completely changed. Gone are all the lagging indicators I used before, and i'm really pleased with my new knowledge of being able to predict the market with more accuracy.

Im so looking forward to the webinars and learning more.

Right im off now to watch more of Sam's video's

No problem, these answers are hard to give over just text, so this is why we have the room so i can clearly and easily show you everything live straight from my screen.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
alot of traders ask other traders that have created a method/system that claim its profitable to ask to see thier  statements to see if they are really profitable and telling the truth, notice how they NEVER  show you a statement, all they have to do is black out account number  and show, but they never do. I GO ONE BETTER!!! i dont show you my  printed statement I show you my live screen with my live account all  loaded and logged in to see my balance profits trades taken whatever you  want!!! IM honest and genuinely profitable and have the live proof

Hey Dean,

Just wanted to drop by and say thanks for all the time and effort you have been putting into your pip factory. Your free room has taught me a great deal over the past couple weeks, and it has been nearly impossible not to make pips while hanging with you!

Looking forward to spending more time there next week!!

Hi Dean,

Being very new to supply and demand when i first entered the live room it was abit daunting at first. But i was soon made to feel welcome and my questions where answered quickly and politely.

I have not as yet taken any trades in there, but when my knowledge level of S&D as improved, i'm sure i'll be pulling in those pips easily with you help and hopefully then on my own.

Many thanks for what you are doing for us all.

Hi Dean

Thanks for a great webinar last Friday. The explanation on how you ,mark out your zones for a better entry was something that I was having trouble with, now that has become clearer. Looking forward to Sunday nights session ( well maybe not as it is 3am start for me) but yes I feel that after each webinar I am coming closer to fully understanding the concept of Supply and Demand. You are doing a great job and very much appreciated, thank you very much mate.

Hi Dean,

thank you for this great thread.

A couple of questions:

1. I have seen that you are short on GBPJPY, what is your target on this?

2. I would like to open a short on EURUSD next week, at what level should I wait for to open a shrt on eurusd?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #321 ---
Dean,

I have traded with you on 1 session a week or so ago.  Plan to return soon to get a better understanding of your trading strategy.  I know it's not that complicated but have to practice to ensure that I have the correct entry and exit points.  Also, during the session that I attended you noted that you do not recommend when to take a trade and that you are just identifying a possible entry point using your system.  IMHO, a little more emphasis on when to place a trade would be helful.  Just a statement by you to the effect as to when you went long or short.  Then it's up to us to decide to place a trade or pass.

I have another live trading account and we are advised as to when to get in and out based on the system rules.

Otherwise, your willingness to share your trading system with your fellow traders commendable - thanks.

Dr. Jack

Hi Dean,

Watching your video recording (currently at the point when you were ordering your lunch)

Thanks again for sharing you knowledge with us.

--- 帖子 #329 ---
Hey Dr Jack,

thanks for writing on my thread, ive stressed this many times, that i will NOT give out trades as signals llike short and long, i want traders to learn this method, not just copy exactly what i do, i mark out the area, i tell everybody why i marked it, with currency pair and area to look for, the trader in the room hopefully with the knowledge i have taught can act correctly upon price arrival to this zone. Teach a man to fish and all that is what i believe in, even me marking areas down as supply and demand i feel is a signal in itself and dont even feel the need for that, but i cant teach anyone without marking zones i see and explaning why this zone is marked.

I hope this has cleared some thoughts in your head and that im not a signal service. There are many signal services out there paid and free, entirely up to the trader what they do, but i feel i have approached this in a completely new and unique way in which i can mark out prime zones for people ALONG with being able to make the traders in the room progress in thier training education.

Regards

Dean

I followed you here from Rocky's thread (all Hail the Maestro!) Getting my head around fib fans and everything else...I'm excited and looking forward to some interesting Asian sessions with you. I expect the right amount (demand) of sledging between a Pom and an Aussie to take place but let me state here the utmost respect for you having branched out from the best thread I have read in my 2 years in this pursuit.

Good luck and good health to you and yours.

The room and accompanying chat are really friendly and I am loving the sense of community that had been created.

Hi Dean,

Unforuntately I find it hard to attend the webinars due to commitments, would you consider recording the webinars and uploading them? I'll provide you with free webspace if needed.

I'm mostly interested in what method you use to identify your supply / demand zones. I just look at the chart and guess and check volume, but i feel you guys are doing something much better, so if you could explain your method that would be awesome.

Hi Guys,

With regards to supply and demand I've watched numerous videos and seminars by various traders and they are all contradicting each other.

I'm still no wiser as to how to identify supply and demand. If anything, I'm even more confused.

Does anybody have a simple guide to identifying supply and demand. I watched one of deankennys webinars which shows you how to mark the zone but I still don't know how to identify the zone, i think the audio was out of sync because he was pointing to a zone with lots of candles in but said you shouldn't have hardly any, price should shoot out of area fast.

Dean if you are reading this can you tell me excatly where you learned supply and demand and which method do you use, sam seidners? did you just watch one webinar? if so which one?

Please help.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
leeress,

Dean will have another webinar in about 3 hours time. Come and join us. He will explain how he identifies the supply / demand zones.

--- 帖子 #355 ---
Just started to incorporate this into my trading, look forward the webinars.

--- 帖子 #356 ---
Hi Guys,

I was sent back here to look for webinars to learn how to identify S+D, so i don't want to start bugging him and become that annoying person who keeps asking newb questions.

Take a look at this I've identified the bottom red as demand because price shot away violently, is that how it works? price moves away fast so that means there is huge demand at that level.

the 61 fib line appears to be respected, look at price wedge down into the demand zone. This is what makes me think I've correctly identified demand, of course if I'm wrong please tell me.

Basically I would setup a long limt order 3164 and my sl would be 3161, reason being is if price falls back down it will bounce off the demand zone.

The thing I still don't really get is looking to the left, are we saying you cant draw a demand zone if price is comfortable (sideways) historically? If so how far do we look back? 10 bars, 10 days? etc

The other thing i don't get is how many bounces before a demand zone will be breached?

http://content.screencast.com/users/...3b77ea/SD1.jpg

(Ignore the sell order, that's my robot.)

--- 帖子 #357 ---
I'm just learning myself,

but if I'm not mistaken, both your supply and demand zones are a bit off...

I think you need to include the body + the top part of the wick (for supply) and the body and bottom part of the wick (for demand).

The reason why sideways markets aren't that great is because we are generally looking for quick market reactions once the price comes into the supply / demand zone.

But like I said, still learning. Come to the webinar and let Dean himself explain it. It's in the next 15 minutes anyways.

--- 帖子 #358 ---
leerees

I didn't see that area as demand before the bounce, but as it was yesterdays low and a nice engulfing candle, if price tests that area again then maybe expect demand to kick in.

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Another question I have:

If I setup a demand zone on a 5 min chart (using the 1 min chart to tune it up) does it also have to be a demand zone on the 1hr chart?

Looking at my demand zone above when i zoom out to the 1hr chart it doesn't look like a demand at all.

--- 帖子 #360 ---
I really can't make the sessions at 11am, this is the problem. If anybody wants to write out clear instructions for identifying the supply and demand areas as Dean Kenny does it I'll pay money via paypal.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Wow leerees, you really are a lost puppy out there, seems to me is that you have listened to too much crap and cant get rid of it and start with a fresh mind. Until you are capable of this only then will you get what i call "THE EYE" for spotting zones. As i said theres no education or tutorial pdf or videos specifically set in any order regarding how i do it, simply because im doing all this out the kindness of my heart for free! and giving up some trading time to show people what i do. To make a special video or pdf about this would just be too time consuming and at the end of the day my aim is to become full time trader, and doing something like that will knock me far off course, we now have guys in the room who really have taken to this well and developed "THE EYE" like myself and im proud of them, if you can get in the room, im sure there always someone in there to help you.

Many regards

Dean

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Hi Dean,

thanks for the reply, may I just ask which webinar you learnt the basics of identifying supply and demand from? I do want to put in the screen hours to get the eye but if I don't have the basics how can I start?

If you could recommend just one webinar that would teach me this? I know there are sam seidners webinars but he has hundreds and a lot of them are supply and demand with indicators and bollinger bands, i don't want to go in that direction.

--- 帖子 #363 ---
I learnt identification of supply and demand zones through Sam Sieden

I learnt pure price action from James16

I learnt the use of fib ret and ext using s and d through Rocky

I learnt fib fans from Berni, a guy in the room

These 4 things together is how i have come up with this powerful method.

the 2 most powerful thing to move markets is supply and demand and fibonacci, so i thought WHAT THE HECK why not combine them.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Many thanks Dean, which webinar would you recommend listening to on sam siendens site? there are so many of them. Should I just go through the whole lot and ignore what he says about indicators and bollinger bands, or is there a specific one that teaches identifying supply and demand?

--- 帖子 #365 ---
thats the key ignore most of it, remember his videos are a hidden marketing advertisement for his academy, so ignore all the indy stuff, and only listen to stuff when he talks about a zone and placing it, have a pen and pad next to you, as zone as he starts talking about placing a zone, jot down everything key that he says, and for now ignore everything else he is talking about, but yes, go through all his videos.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Cheers dean for pointing me in the right direction. I'll go through all the webinars and see if I pick it up. I think I should be ok.

Followed Dean since Sunday session, haven't really started trading using this method, just monitoring some areas that I've marked using his method, and traded some if the risk reward is very good. I've attached an example of one of the latest supply area I've marked down, you can see that the risk reward for some trades is really good

Dean thanks for posting up the EURGBP H1 on looking at that chart ive just realised why i'm not seeing these trades and thats because my charts are to close to the price action IE zoomed in. Once i zoom out the whole S&D becomes alot clearer.

On the chart above i have the 50.00% fib line sitting right on the 0.8662 supply line. Is that how you have it aswell?

Kev

--- 帖子 #376 ---
yes

i wanted someone to point out normal fib retrace, yes you got it, 50 retrace sits in level too, but now we got to hope for it to move soon so the blue fan can arrive at same time as price

Hi Dean

Feeling very frustrated as can't get into your amazing room today. No idea why as worked perfectly yesterday, have tried 3 browsers all to no effect so will have to ask my questions here until I can resolve the issue.

By the way many thanks for taking the time to share your amazing strategy its really appreciated.

Can I ask you a couple of questions namely;

1) How do you choose the zones to trade and the ones to leave, most importantly how do decide which ones to leave?

2) You have said on several occasions that you use Sam's methods(whoose videos I have watched) but you have added a couple of things like fib levels etc. Can you explain them please?

3) Lastly how would you recommend the best way to trade your strategy?  Is it best to identify supply and demand levels on hourly or 30 min charts then when price approaches these areas drop down to 5 or even 1 min charts for tighter entries?

I've heard you say on the one time I got into your room that you would love to sit down and trade with someone for a day, well I'm only about a 4 hour drive from Weymouth so would love to pop down for a day and talk forex all day long until the cows come home.

I'm going to try and put some supply and demand areas on some charts and post here shortly for your comments.

Thanks again for such a great thread and your trading room which I loved the one and only time I got into it.

Bye for now.

--- 帖子 #387 ---
1. the zones i leave are the ones where price did not leave rapidly enough, im looking for at least a 2x move away on the first candle to be a tradeable zone.

2. yes fib retracements are well known to work in forex, so i thought hell why not mix it in, and when levels fell within zones just made it more powerful.

3. i have a laptop and a desktop, i have 4 different metatraders open, 1 showing daily, 1 showing hourly and 1 showing 5min, laptop shows weekly.

If im trading a 1 hour ill make sure daily is not showing a zone against the way i want to trade, if trading  5 min ill flick to 1 hr the same etc

hope this helps

Hi Dean

Just put this supply zone onto gbpusd which looks pretty cool and meets the criteria I believe.

Only problem is it was caused by the bad news out today so should I count it as a good supply area?

Please note that there was another zone setup just to the left at 2200hrs on 24th.

Would you trade it today if it gets hit?

Cheers Clive.

edit, just realised its also bang on a 50% retracement too!

--- 帖子 #392 ---
Heres some more of my efforts this time on AUDUSD.

Supply 1 I like it as price doesn't hang around and comes down quickly with a candle twice the size of last green candle.

Supply 2 I like but price does linger a little but bang on 0.764 fib

Supply 3 Not too sure as again price hangs around a bit and although close to 0.618 not bang on it.

Demand 1 bit iffy as candle is not that big

Demand 2 I believe is an excellent example of what I should be looking for big candle taking us away from level plus on a big nos 0.9400 and would be a double bottom.

Are there any obvious ones I have missed?

Your thoughts would be appreciated.

If price comes up into a demand area would you buy it? And vice versa if price came down into a supply area would you sell it?

Last question. Where do you place your orders? In the middle of zones front edge or back edge?

Cheers Clive

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Hi Clive, i'll try to answer your question.

I'll pick all the supply and demand 2 on your chart, plus there should be supply 4 right below supply 3 where price bounce before reaching demand 1.

For supply 3 i'd be carefull seing price action there, i'd close my trade if i have some profit.

About demand 1, i'd move to smaller TF to find better level (not that wide).

Some correction here, if price comes down into a demand area i would buy, and vice versa if price came up into a supply area i would sell.

Entri for supply at the bottom of the box SL a few pips above the box.

Entri for demand at the top of the box plus spread, SL a few pips below the box.

Hope that help you Clive

ok it seems as ive reached my quota on anymeeting, and my room is FULL and has been too busy and too much activity for them to let me continue free.

To increase my quota and allow unlimited participants and usage i must pay a monthly fee. Unfortunately unless that is reimbursed somehow i wont be able to continue the room, i looked at Omnovia and they are just as expensive.

Only option is to charge a daily access fee to the room not monthly, but as i said thats a road i do not want to go down

I knew supply and demand was going to be popular, but not 100-200 ppl a day popular in and out the room.

good day today, 3 trades for me, 2 winners and other one open for +60 pips, good day considering its nfp  but supply still works as the law establishes

my 2 winners i closed fully now as london closes and we go into weekend, so after a quiet start to the week we came out well on top.

my personal account as i know a few of you are interested was at $1196 last week, and not including my floating profit i have closed the weekend of $1222

so i am extremely happy

See you all next week, Im hoping to do a Sunday Webinar, if i do will be more around 10pm, as i have football late Sunday night, i will let all my subscribers know via email, enjoy the weekend guys

and heres my live account, first pic shows my balance beginning of week around $1991 and my balance as of today at $1222 in second pic

I truly feel the same way as you on this Dean. As a father myself, this is my favorite scene of all time from any movie. I tell my son that all the time.

If you really want to be inspired, read the book...its an amazing read and well worth the time invested to read it. I could not put it down once a close friend gave it to me as a birthday gift.

Very nice bro really impressive and hit straight into my sould

--- 帖子 #406 ---
congratulations for a very promising thread.

i must say though, the imageshack uploading really sucks.

needless to say if the account is deleted the images will be gone too and it will be a pitty for your effort.

also the images are very hard to zoom and study in detail.

please use the "attachments" function here in FF when posting charts.

it will make reading a lot easier.

thanks again

--- 帖子 #407 ---
Hi Dean !

I hope you didnt miss to short the aud/jpy supply zone that i've seen on your webinar?

Because i just study this charts at the moment and see a nice 100+ pips!!!

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Hi Dean, I too am tired of lagging indicators after trying many systems here at FF (and creating a number of my own) with limited success. I have been trading live for about two years with a slowly dwindling account to show for it, but have not blown any accounts since I am very conscious of MM.

I stumbled across your name when reading Rocky's thread as an alternative to lights, bells and whistles trading and also in a Raz's skype room where your name was mentioned re: supply and demand.

I've read your thread, Kenneth Lee's, and watched/listened to a couple of your recorded webinars (and S.Seidens) and it all makes complete sense to ditch the nonsense I have been previously using. Unfortunately it is difficult to participate in the live room time wise as I'm from Australia (I'm a teacher and must keep a clear head for the mornings here!) but would appreciate your input in the forum. You have been most generous and selfless in your thread and I respect those values greatly.

I'll use the following chart maybe more than once with differing questions if they come to mind, I have grasped the concept of S and D zones but need to make sure I'm on the right track before live trading (I'm ok with that-mini account!).

Dean would you agree with the following S and D levels on the Ozzie 1 Hour? I had to drop a timeframe or two to reduce the zone size and I am unsure about Supply level 5. I know it is from a prior 1 hour pin that the 5 min gave me, as the one hour and 15 min zones were too wide.

Pedross,

Your S&D zones looks good. To increase the accuracy of the zones, generally you do drop one level or TF down, i.e if you're planning to trade of the H1 TF, you mark your potential S&D zone and then go down to M15, and mark the upper and lower limits of your zone.

Then you check by using Fib Fan Lines to see whether the 61.8 Fib Fan Line runs through it. If the 61.8 runs through it, the confluence makes it a stronger S or D zone.

So far while using the S&D technique, I've gained about USD 60 (within a week and a half trading just 0.1 Mini Lots at any one time. Generally even though certain trades can show a 2 or 3 to one reward to risk ratio, I would limit my TP to just 1, to lock in the profits as most of the time I can't afford to be in front of the computer (Work, family etc)

--- 帖子 #410 ---
well said, apart from i see zones that are used now, i would use the first touch of the zone as an indication to a new zone, if its a strong move away it becomes a new fresh zone.

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Firstly, thank you very much for your selfless sharing on how you trade using the supply and demand concept, the many hours you put in FF and the webinars.  I recognise the edge in using Fib Fan Lines to see whether the 61.8 Fib Fan Line runs through then drawn s/d zone and when the 61.8 runs through it, the resulting confluence makes it a stronger one.  What are your guidelines for drawing the most suitable fib fan lines?

--- 帖子 #412 ---
as you can see from the attached chart you can pick any swing point, from the high to the low, as you can see here, i have picked a smaller swing up above, and then the largest swing of the whole chart, and both 61.8 lines ran straight through the supply zone, to me this trade was FREE money way before price got there. ALSO what makes this a more confident trade, is look at price before already rreacting to the fans showing that this is also creating a trendline.

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Thank you, Dean.  Your reply and the attached chart has made itmuch clearer now.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
and of course after all those confluences i didnt even mention the 50 fib retrace too.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
Dean can I kindly request you let me have your fib retracement settings again?

Hi Dean, I'm curious as to why you did not choose the previous zone I have marked in yellow. Was it because your marked zone had greater strength in its move south?

Hi cashforex,

Fib fan is already built in on MT4, you can find it from the toolbar menu Insert - Fibonacci - Fan.

Hope that help

--- 帖子 #426 ---
On your MT4 chart look at the tabs across the top.  Click on  Insert   .

Fibonacci    should be in the drop down menu.  Click on it.   Fan   is there.

Hi Dean

Yes please more webinars! I joined you all a bit late so I have missed some of the earlier webinars that were a bit more educational, could you go through how you carry out your daily analysis routine?

And still a bit confused as to why you leave some zones alone and trade the other ones. I know its something to do with your fib fans but just don't understand how?

Also would love to take you up on your invitation to trade with you for a day, when would be most convenient for you?

Many thanks for all your help very much appreciated.

All the best Clive

--- 帖子 #434 ---
Hi Dean

have a look at chart below. What do you think of the 4hr 2 supply zones I have put on? Any good? Would you trade them?

Thanks Clive

--- 帖子 #435 ---
the touch now is a nice risk reward, BUT, theres been many touches into this area already, taking into account risk reward its worth it, BUT again the touches put me off.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
So maybe I should wait for the price to push up further to the 4hr zone above?

Hi Dean and co.

This is the trade I identified yesterday, supply at 3693. Although the area did get respected i was still stopped out but then price turned around, had my stop been 8 or so pips wider i would have made money.

dean said he wouldn't have took the trade at all so im curious to know why.

did i identify s+d incorrectly? i done it by using the H1 and then zooming in to the 15m to tighten up.

http://content.screencast.com/users/...bac/eurusd.jpg

--- 帖子 #444 ---
as explained entry back into the area was too choppy.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
Hi Dean, which part do you think was too choppy the 1st visit back or the 2nd visit where i took my short?

I'm still trying to gauge what constitutes a choppy entry. I'm guessing a string of green candles with no reds is the kind of stuff im looking for right? As price moved into my entry (2nd revisit) there was a string of green candles so this is why i thought it was a good identifiyer.

price did bounce off the supply, just a few pips higher than i thought.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Hi Peeps, Have i heard correct that there is a skype room for everyone to discuss supply and demand trades in the day?

If so could some kind soul let me know how i go about joining in the room?

Excellent Dean. I've seen several very good higher TF trades. I will be stalking those more now.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Hi,

Wondered whether eur/jpy [M30] coming into a fresh demand zone is a good setup? It has a fib fan of 38.2 for confluence passing through.

My doubt hence the question arises with price having come as close as it has already and pulling away, whether that invalidates trade now?

Are there rules for how close and at what speed price comes near to a zone but in fact pulling away before, lets suppose, before [eventually] carrying on to the zone, negating that setup as being high-probability trade?

Your comments much appreciated. Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
the faliure in this trade is you are using ur indicator as the only thing, you need to see zones yourself and then u will see you could have got in on that move

--- 帖子 #462 ---
hi dean, how are your webinars doing?

i heard many are happy with your teachings, simple yet effective i heard

keep it up man,

keep in touch,

take care.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
Is the painted zone by said indicator wrong? How else would I have got in on this move?

Please, if you would, also, regardless of the specific scenario above, address and comment on the question, in general, regarding price moving towards a zone and then pulling away short of having arrived. Do you consider that a touch of sorts or not?

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Hi Dean,

Good to see that you have made Sam's S/D with Rocky's Fibs to work. Good job!!..

Btw..when is the next webinar. I would like to join too. I m still struggling with picking S/D levels.

--- 帖子 #465 ---
in answer to "How else would i have got in on this trade?"

answer as i already said would be use your eyes, do not rely solely on the indicator.

Morning all,

Think this thread hits the nail on the head, and would like to ask the experienced traders what they use as an entry signal.

Do they enter on the price zone being hit, or do they look for consolidation at these areas, and wait for a break of this when price reverses?

Here's a chart showing some zones for USCHF today (5 mins)

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Trades for today. I was in office. Couldn't trade much. But had EU and EJ with limit orders.

Still working on my limit TP and SL, as sometimes  you have spikes for stop hunting..

Hi buddy thanks for this , and i wanted to tell you you that your charts are realy very very helpful .

I m  learning S n D in a much clear way than Sam's stuff

Also i wanted to ask you What timeframe u prefer are the best to plot them.

what i use to do with SnR is that taking them on H1 , H4 ,Daily then moving down to m5 and m15 to take positions ??

What time frame do u use basically ?

just came from a party...recent trade taken on eurcad..lets see how it goes..

bit drunk at the moment..

--- 帖子 #490 ---
GBPUSD update, took it from the fib and trendline, already took some off for profits, like i did before this was not hindsight marked this out earlier and posted the chart up, and we got the first initial reaction at our fan line and trendline right in supply, will it drop hopefully, if not no worries already got profits from it.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
update: hit the target..

few more in progress..will post later once orders are closed..

--- 帖子 #492 ---
nice trade

--- 帖子 #493 ---
some failures yesterday..

--- 帖子 #494 ---
dude that chfjpy worked perfectly, it came off supply and went down to the demand level and went back up. Why not take profits or stop to BE at least at the first demand level in opposite direction.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
yes, but not good enough for target profit.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
ok. few more trades today. the euraud and usdcad..both good trades...hit targets..

--- 帖子 #497 ---
if that demand zone is not good enough profit margin for you, theres one thing to do, not take the trade, remember the next zone in opposite direction is what we focus on once entering a trade.

--- 帖子 #498 ---
yes correct. that should not have been traded, since it did not have enough profit margin.

I think its a good example of how NOT to trade supply and demand.

many mistakes were made in that trade. oh well we can't win them all..

more importantly its good that i post it , since now the mistake will more fresh in my memory ...next time i take a trade, drunk...lolz..

--- 帖子 #499 ---
yes definately, showing and analysing failed trades are just as good education as the winners, we need to learn from mistakes as well as learn the method

Lovely trading Zamfir. One question: what are your Bollinger Band settings (assume those are BBs on the charts).

PB

--- 帖子 #503 ---
pixelboy, I use BB with 50,2 Setting. This is because i want to try and get S/D at the extreme levels..hopefully increasing the probability of the trades.

--- 帖子 #504 ---
WELL DONE ZAMFIR!!!

thats what i like to see, i dont take that many trades as im conservative but still, you have imressed me!

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Hi Zamfir - Just normal BBands with 50,2? Mine don't look anything like your's when I use those settings.

[confused]

PB

--- 帖子 #506 ---
settings should be 50 - 0  - 2

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Got it - thanks!

Thanks dean,

btw...how many trade do you take in a day?.

I usually get friday's off, so i at my tradestation..most of time..sleeping and watching movies..lolz..

but other days..much fewer..hopefully someday i can quit my job..and trade full time..

--- 帖子 #509 ---
i take around 2 to 4 trades per day

very strict rules, usually lose around 1 per day out of the 3 or 4

--- 帖子 #510 ---
nice bollinger band setup here

--- 帖子 #511 ---
8:47pm London time Friday, im miles away from looking for setups now, enjoy the weekend

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Haven't checked this thread for a while. Seems like more and more people are following the supply and demand technique to trade

would probably drop in the next webinar if there's any.

Good luck to all.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Dean/Zamfir - I've been reviewing a load of charts this weekend and I think combining Deans use of the fib fan with Zamfir's BBands looks really powerful. I'd also like to suggest adding in the round number lines as an extra aid to determining reversal probability, if you're not already factoring them in. The '00' prices seem to work really well with the S&D zones (e.g. 1.3500, 1.2700).

PB

--- 帖子 #514 ---
PixelBoy, I m not really good with fibs, I have tried them and they make it harder for me to make my decision , they confuse me more . I m just not one of those people who get fibs. I have used round numbers , yes they do good. But wait, this week i feel there is a surprise coming up for the S/D traders.

Stay tuned...

Hi Zamfir - Ooo...I like surprises  ;-)  Now I'm intrigued!

Agree with you on the fibs. I always find I see them really easily AFTER the move. Never liked the normal fib re-tracement lines.

I use the fan and only look at the 61 and 88 levels which makes it a bit easier. The only thing I did this weekend was draw the fan from a major high to low and watch how the price follows the 61/88 channel in a downtrend and vice versa for uptrend. Uncanny how it sits in the channel. Gives a lot of confidence when the fan line sits behind a zone.

A big thanks to Dean for this pointing out.

PB

--- 帖子 #516 ---
heres another big GIVEAWAY for you regarding the fans, the 61 fan line is the momentum line it doesnt necsearily act as a wall its wait price uses for momentum, the 88 fan line is the WALL you want to be trading off

--- 帖子 #517 ---
the 88 fan line

For clarification:   Aren't you referring to the  78.6  fib retracement on the fan ?

--- 帖子 #518 ---
no i am not! Like i said the 88 fan line

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Curious...  how did the 88 number come up since it is not on 'regular' fib tools?   Did you experiment and find the 88 ?     The number 89  is a fibonnacci number in itself but not a ratio as  is the 38.2  and 61.8 .

--- 帖子 #520 ---
its been shown in my webinar many times, people cannot believe how much price uses it to bounce, people have already been calling it "THE MAGIC LINE"

also 38.2 and all them is what ALL of the normal retail traders get, remember 95% retail traders fail, put 2 and 2 together here and you will realise where im going with this.

--- 帖子 #521 ---
I am usually not available to take part in the webinars.... so I was not aware of the 88 .

So  buyers and sellers must be using the  88  line otherwise it would not work.  Now I am even more curious as to how that came about.

Of course if it works,  use it.

I am going to adjust my fib fan.

--- 帖子 #522 ---
its not how many buyers and sellers its the size of the order, if Barclays sell something at 1.32 with one order of 20million and 1million retail traders are buying at 1.32 with a combined total of orders being 16million which way is it going to go, down, so we have one winner and 1million losers

its so simply when you just think about how simple it really is!

--- 帖子 #523 ---

I agree with everything you have said.   Still wondering  how  the 88 has come to be a significant number.   That is simply curious.   I can see how the million traders  AND  Barclays  would  trade off of  a  61.8 retracement price.  Curious as to why the reaction is to 88.    Glad you have discovered it.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
I wish I could be up during london to see this in action.  May need to take an afternoon and evening nap just to see it.  The  88 is the fourth root of the .618.  (Its actually off by just a little but thats OK.  I think its an early signal)

http://www.forex-fx-4x.com/fibonacci-basic-tutorial/

--- 帖子 #525 ---
yes as close as, in what you posted the setting is 0.886 in my setting i have 0.881 good enough for me

--- 帖子 #526 ---
Just a crazy thought........

If computers see in zeroes and ones and humans see in fractals by halving quartering etc.  Could these forth root zones be the confluence of the two?  Just a thought.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Evening all, stumbled upon this thread and also apply supply/demand to trading. Currently testing swing and scalp strategies.

Short EUR USD @ fresh 60 minute supply from Friday afternoon and left it over the weekend (aware of the risk associated but like the supply zone).

Chart attached with T1 (near the low from last Friday's sell off) and T2 (rally, base rally location followed by strong buying) the targets.

Happy Trading.

--- 帖子 #528 ---
Hello. I only stumbled in this thread today. Thanks to Dean for sharing. I looked at SD zones in the past after watching several videos by Sam Seiden and could never make up my mind about the right zones. Dean's strategy looks much easier (hopefully) and I mean to hang around to learn more. Before going to bed I tried to challenge my understanding by spotting this supply area on EJ with double confluence on Fib lines and fans at 61.8 level. The price went through the area and then back down , generating a profit of at least 5 pips, before going up again. But a 15 pips stop would have needed to hold the spike up. Would this be counted as a loser? And above all, was that supply area correct?

--- 帖子 #529 ---
would not trade that, market only just opened and u can see the gap there, people like to trade the gap at market open hence the market trying hard to fill it so early, i would at least wait till tomorrow morning for valid trades and zones.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
I wouldn't either of course. Was just checking my understanding about zones... Will look for more, hoping I get access soon to the skype room

--- 帖子 #531 ---
I'd strongly advise anyone wanting to give the fib fan a try to use the values that Dean has provided. I've watched him use them live on his webinar and I've back-tested them across a lot of pairs and time-frames. They work - simple as that. I don't know HOW they work, but they do work and provide a significant edge, and that's good enough for me.

Greeting everyone.

Have not had much time to trade past 2 days. was busy with work. But managed to get few trades.

As you can see the new addition to my analysis is the PnF Charts. These charts help your confirm exactly where the "actual" or real supply demand levels are.

fine example is the usdcad as posted.

gbpaud was best with 75 pips.

please analyse them...

give your comments..

update : on my previous post of  eurusd and audcad trades. They have gone bad , but they are still on. I let them run for experimental reasons with PnF charts. Still learning

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Explain more  ;-)

--- 帖子 #534 ---
Well the PnF(Point and Figure) charts were used in the 19th century. They are no secret in trading.but this method was lost for a long time. It was much before forex trading. It was mostly used in the analysis of stocks. But these days its picking up in forex big time , why ?

because guess what it is used for ? that's right - supply and demand levels.

The PnF charts do not have time in the picture. all noise of time is removed and you are left with only price. take any charts put the PnF charts and mark your supply demands on both time charts and price charts , if they match you have a solid entry. as can be seen from my above posts.

i m still experimenting with them. But i guess you get the point now.

plenty of PnF technical analysis out there. mt4 indicators too. attached is one of them i use.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Thats intersting, zamfir. Can you explain better how PnF help to identify SD areas? Similar to normal bars?  Thanks

--- 帖子 #536 ---
Thanks Zamfir - I've never look at PnF before, but they look like they could be a useful addition to this method. I assume the trade plays out as usual, but you use the PnF chart to jump in quick with a market order when you see demand overtake supply or vice versa on the PnF? Obviously the price on the time chart would have to be in a demand or supply zone.

PB

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Quite simple actually....apply the same principles that you use to identify the supply demand on a normal candlestick chart.

When you apply it on a PnF chart you get more accurate picture, since we are looking ONLY at price.

We need to look at both charts because on the PnF charts the bars are created only when the price moves by x amount of pips. Hence we need to look at both candlestick charts and see where the supply demand levels are, then look up the PnF charts to confirm that we are actually in a good supply/demand level.

This sort of analysis , has helped me avoid taking low probability trades for a while now. But i m still experimenting..

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Not quite PB, you can now actually be more accurate in "set and forget" method of supply demand, because now you can see the exact price where the resistance or bounce is on the PnF charts.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Recent trade on NZDJPY 1H.

As it can be seen on both time and price charts , the price has gone into demand levels on both charts. Trade is now taken ..lets see how it goes..

--- 帖子 #540 ---
I'm not sure I can see how they give a more accurate picture than just zooming into the normal chart. Can you show an example?

PB

--- 帖子 #541 ---
When price on a PnF chart breaks lower isn't it a sell signal?

I'm just referring to the charts here: http://www.investopedia.com/articles.../03/081303.asp

How do you read them the opposite way?

PB

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Yes correct, but look where the price is in ..its in a demand level. LOOK to the left ...its broken a smaller support level but heading into a demand level.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
Another example to help identify a more accurate S/D level. this is on the current AudChf 15m chart.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Hi Zamfir - Thanks for this chart. That makes it a bit clearer. So if the price on the PnF chart had been within the consolidation zone, you would take that as a confirmation signal, or would you be looking for the price to break long on the PnF?

I need to study PnF charts!

PB

--- 帖子 #545 ---
PB, it's not very complicated. All i m saying is try and match the S/D levels on both time and price charts to get a high probable entry. you will get many entries on the time charts alone, but if you look the PnF charts , that will tell you if the price is really in a S/D level.

Same rules as given by Sam sieden apply on the PnF charts.

Hi Forethan - I'm not using the PnF charts. I tried setting them up, but I couldn't get my head around how to use them properly.

PB

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Hi Guys,

if you find PnF charts difficult to use, please don't use them in your analysis.

It's just another way of looking @ S/D levels, its not magic or its not better than

anything you are already doing.

Keep it simple and do what you are doing best now..

--- 帖子 #559 ---
took a long on audjpy today with a nice 2 to 1 reward risk

first chart is my demand level, nice demand level can be seen clearly even for those uneducated in those studies.

second chart, is my confirmation to enter, semafor appeared second one  double bottom to some ppl. HA then closed green with stochs also going  green. and of coure the fail at pivot was in place

entry was red vertical line, and TP was pink horizontal line, aiming for  the m3 midpivot point i put TP just before it as i dont want to be  fighting to tp right on the M3 pivot.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Dean - Your post is very timely. I was just thinking about using something like the symphonie system or BB MACDs on an M5 chart as confirmation for entering S&D trades. I've been targeting them using M30 charts.

Nice to see you're using something similar.

PB

--- 帖子 #561 ---
yes! although s and d for me has been profitable, whats wrong with trying to improve on things. With this i can project easier tp levels and also using price action study along with confirmation can be quite powerful.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
Couldn't agree more. S&D levels seems like a perfect compliment to a short timeframe oscillator system. The other thing you may want to work in, if you're not already are the big news events as, obviously, these are the things which often cause the changes in the big daily swings. I've just switched to using OANDA for my entries and chart analysis and am really starting to appreciate seeing the news event flags at the bottom of the screen. Just another thing to put price into perspective.

Hey Everyone..

Just Finished reading this Whole Thread of the back of finished reading Rocky's thread, and he clearly states not to complicate things, and no need for any other Indicators, especially Lagging ones.

Lets face it , that's why we started reading this Thread as it was all Price-action alone.

Yes, we will get losers with any system, and it needs to be accepted and not tried to filter out with lagging indicators , which will only lead to more unnecessary clutter.  So keep it Simple Guys .

Look forward to studying the charts, and point out Trading opportunities in the future.

Have a good weekend all, from the Sunny West Australia

Market is not moving today..i guess people are fearful of greece..

yesterday the jpy crosses moved a bit. i m in three of them NZD,EUR and GBP.

so far ok. but they are moving very very slowly...net +150 pips..

i guess week is closing..

There is not much to post. once i close the trades i will post the trades.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
150 pips! not so bad mate!

how much is your target?

I m trading these JPY crosses on higher timeframes H4. expecting atleast another 100 pips.

But like i said market was very slow this friday. Lets see monday evening.

Hi zamfir, you strike me as a trader with a lot of sense, would you mind recommending a good broker...i am not so happy with my current broker although i would still want to keep my account with them open..

you all here started a very helpful & very informative thread, kudos to the great Dean Guile....man, you started something that spans across the globe now!

Hi Guys,

I agree 100percent with Apple15 we should not try to complicate things, as I have been following this simple PA method from sam,and rocky's system for about couple of months Know and i took my demo account from $50k to $100k, and, i all we need to focus on is the Correct S/D and trade those zones and watch the $$$$$$$ roll in, i don't even use the Fibs as i find them too confusing, i just use my vision to locate the S/D Plain and Simple, i tried all these messy indicators before and believe me they force you to over trade, with this method all you need to do is mark out your S/D and then set limit orders and relax

Alright guys,

Good lesson coming up.

Last week i had taken trades on the JPY crosses. esp the EUR GBP and NZD.

All of them failed today. Why you ask?. See the attached charts.

But i had also taken NZD/CAD. good 60+ pips their.

Why one worked and others failed ?

The higher time frame S/D are very powerful. this is the lesson to be learned here. ALWAYS make sure you are on the correct side by doing Multi-Time frame analysis. Sometimes we get in a hurry and don't take time to do MTF analysis. But it is very very important to do it to know where you are in the bigger picture.

we hear a lot about MTF analysis in the videos and forums, but unless you experience it , you will never learn the lesson.

Again most important lessons summed up.

1. ALWAYS do MTF analysis before taking any trades.

2. Higher TF S/D levels are very very powerful. learn to use them.

See attached charts.

comments welcome.

--- 帖子 #572 ---

Good 50 pips

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Well my fellow traders...Another loss another lesson.

Listen up!..

recently took a trade on cadchf on 15M , lost 40 pips on 2 trades. each 20 pips. But what went wrong!!

Analysis.

1. On the Monthly chart we are just out of a demand level.

2. On the H4 we are inside a supply level(when the trades were taken).

3. On the 15M which side do you pick ,Supply or demand?

See the charts for the answer.

Experts comments welcome!!

Hello everyone, I've been studying the zones and would like to know if I'm identifying them correct. Here is a gold daily chart that I drew up. I had the zones placed before it got to that lovely turn around point to go short. Also had that bearish gartley for more confirmation. I'm still studying the fibo's since I've never used them. I understand them , but I feel like I never place them on the right high and lows.

Hi Zamfir,

I would like to trade on the M5 TF what is the Hire TF i should be looking for the correct Zone to confirm My Entry

This is my Understanding

If we are to trade the Daily TF we should wait for the Monthly Zones form S/D

Daily TF for H4

H4 TF for M30

M30 TF for M5

Is this Correct Please advise

cheers

cash Forex

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Hey Cash,

Well, you see the S/D levels are on all TFs, but the higher you go , more reliable they are. But you know the problem with us traders, we are impatient.

you need to scan for levels on all TF , right from 5M to H4 for intraday. if the level looks fresh on any of the TF , set your PO and take it , risk will be low, so will your losses. Don't over analyze the HTF and LTF , it will only confuse you. But if you get a good level on say H4,take it.

When you scan and if you find a level on M5, just seen where you are placed on a higher TF above M5, upto H4.

I m now posting on Ken's thread. you can browse and see my M5 charts. Most worked pretty well.

Just use PO to minimize your risks. Do not enter on M5 w/o them.

Good luck!!

--- 帖子 #598 ---
Hi zamfir,

Thanks for your clear explanation, it seem a bit more clearer now, also sorry to bug you with another question, I downloaded the Sup/Dem II indicator from this thread it seems really good how it picks out the all the Zones,

It highlights so many of them it makes really hard to pick the correct one hence had quite few trades gone wrong, what would be your suggestions should keep using this indicator or should i just pick out my Zones Manually, but then I think I might not pick the correct Zones, before i downloaded the indicator I was marking out my Weekly's , Daily's, H4, and trading of them but with very few trading opportunities Im really confused as to how can i use this indicator effectively, some time the zones i look at the PA does not move away far enough or the Candles are not strong enough but the indicator still has marked it as Zone, Or should I just only look for Strong Suppl/Demand Level to place my PO

cheers

Cashforex

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Get rid of that indicator and ALL other indicators.

If you use any indicator with S/D strategy. you WILL make mistakes. Indicators only cloud your judgement.

I suggest you use a clean chart and identify the S/D levels. you can see my charts , they are without any indicators and the S/D levels work!!.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Hi zamfir,

I have del all of the indicators, and makes it a bit more clear now, just another thing, say for argument sake Im looking to Trade the 4H and i have marked my S/D on the daily, chart, now should i wait for the PA to reach the Daily S/D level before i look for trades on the H4, is this the correct way to trade this method

if this is the case then we would not get enough opportunity to trade in a week we may lucky to get one or two trades a week and if one does not pan out then other one does then Risk on reward is not good then, wouldn't be better to trade short time Frame eg 5M that way we can get more trading opportunity, the reason i want to learn this system ASAP so i can leave my daytime job which gives me the shits,

CashForex, first thing is DO NOT QUIT YOUR DAY JOB.Everyone in forex trading wants to do this badly. But we are no where near to trading for a living. It requires hard work and dedication for few years and after that may be.

Im looking to Trade the 4H and i have marked my S/D on the daily, chart,  now should i wait for the PA to reach the Daily S/D level before i look  for trades on the H4, is this the correct way to trade this method

Not necessary to look for Levels on Daily and then wait for it to reach in there and then look at H4. there will some difference. Like i said the levels are there on all time frames including 1m. But the levels are more reliable on higher TF(H4 onwards). But when you choose any TF, look where the price is just one level higher, so that you don't run into the opposite level on a higher TF.

E.g if you see a good supply level on H4, see daily to make sure you are not running into a Demand level on the daily,because then it would be a total disaster.  if the level line on both daily and H4, that's the highest probability you have to get a good trade.

if this is the case then we would not get enough opportunity to trade in  a week we may lucky to get one or two trades a week and if one does not  pan out then other one does then Risk on reward is not good then,  wouldn't be better to trade short time Frame eg 5M that way we can get  more trading opportunity

Yes, this is why i said we as trader when new are very very impatient. It takes a while to get hold of your emotions in this business. I used to very reckless in my trading earlier. Bad idea. Some days you will have 2-3 opportunities , like i had yesterday. Its OK to trade 5M once you have become very very good at picking levels. Also good way to practice is on 5M.

Hence what is necessary to become good at this method

1. picking good levels with good reasons.

2. Good entries , tight stops. This is because as you can see the best entry's are the one's where the the price goes no where near the Stops and moves away to your target. Many examples of this in ken's thread i have posted.

3. Good exits, this one will be slightly harder, as it depends on person to person and Time Frames.

4. Setting POs and let go. This is very very important, if you cannot do this and you might as well pluck out all hairs , go mad to reach your levels , only to get a bad entry with big Stops. Remember if you use PO's , your risks will ALWAYS be smaller then instant orders.

Now first practice , practice and practice some more at picking good levels.you can demo trade until you're good at picking levels , after that start small with real money(emotions) and you will learn to discipline yourself in setting PO,Stops and Targets.

I suggest you keep posting your picked levels in here , so the seniors can guide you and help you analyze the trades.

And more importantly DO NOT quit your day job. we all have long way to go in this business.

Good luck!!

Hi Alvin,

looking at your chart @ 30m. My h4 chart looks a but different. after zooming to 30m. i found the levels.

have a look. Be safe.

--- 帖子 #610 ---
Thanks Zamfir, yes it is a supply on M30.

On H4 the drop looks very nice, the risk reward looks good too.

I'll close half of my position and move the rest at BE+1 pip when it get there.

How about the supply zone I have on H4?

Thanks again for the reply

Hi Guys,

Just wondering what is the best time to trade as i start work at the start of the Asian session so only time I can trade this is about three hours before the Asian session starts that's about 6:00am in the morning for me in Australia is this good or should this method should only be traded the first hour of Asian session

Or is it best to trade the open of the London session

like Sam mentions the price imbalance normally happens the first hour of each trading session he states lot of the traders make their money start of each session, so according to him is it good to just trade the first hour of each session Asian or London

Any Advice on this matter would help me heaps

Cheers

Depends on what kind of trader you are, i my self usually trade H4 chart and i use limit order.

Once I found the supply and demand zone, i put limit order and let the market do what ever it wants to.

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Time does not really matter, obviously ny close until asia opens theres no volume so nothing happens anyway, but you just need to mark your zones out and take the trade no matter what session we are in.

--- 帖子 #614 ---
As far as I'm concerned, once you begin to see these levels, you now have an integral basic road map to quality trade entries.

My particular style is to always fine tune my zones by checking 1m charts, at least for levels current to the last few hours. These zones work way more often then not. Reaction happens at these levels to varying degrees. The trick is to be ready with a tight stop in case the reaction is muted by market conditions. Also get some pips out very soon, (5-8 pips) and get stop to BE.

Thanks again Dean. Awesome stuff!

Hi bros,

THis is a great thread. I just go through from the first page to the last one. I may miss many good information. So i would like to ask for a few questions here, thanks for your answer

- Is the timeframe for trading is 5 minutes, i saw many picture by dean is with 5 minutes

- What would be the SL, just the high/low point of the support/resi zone?

- I see dean said, move the SL to be if it passed 6~7 pips. But where is the TP? thanks!

Hi Dean, i added your skype, will you please let me in your skype room?

My skype id helloworldsh, thanks!

Hi Dean,

I just found this nice thread...

I'm just learn about supply & demand method.

Can i still join your skype group?

I made few hundred pips since Tuesday on Daily tf EURUSD, EURJPY & GBPUSD [Demand zone] & USDCHF [supply zone].

Do you think we still can buy on EURUSD, GBPUSD & Sell USDCHF for today?

--- 帖子 #625 ---
YEs no problem, you are more than welcome to add me.

Yes the demand this week on daily tf on these pairs was so obvious it was free money all the way, of course if your still looking to buy always be careful on a second entry into demand.

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Cable supply level im looking at, if it can reach it, for its continued move southwards,

--- 帖子 #627 ---
1. The TF can be any TF u wish to work on, scalpers can work on 5 min, swing trades can work on 4hr, daily even weekly.

2. The sl would be the other side of the zone u are working with

3. This is for scalping only, TP will always be at the next zone in the opposite direction.

Hope this helps,

Dean

--- 帖子 #628 ---
Dean, I've marked a SZ on the chart. Got fib 61.8 and 23.6 on the zone.

How do I mark DZ on the grey circle? Is there a DZ there? Is it level on top of level?

--- 帖子 #633 ---
the supply you marked is not the greatest for coupe reasons.

we want to see more of a conolidation, and also its a drop base drop.

The drop base rally and vice versa are the best, but in a strong downtrend then drop base drop are very good.

well there i go again, i posted the chart i quoted i think last week sometime

Hi, I followed Rockys thread and now I am very happy to see you continuing with supply and demand. I tryed to contact you via skype and I will try it again, thank you for this nice work. I am trying to trade with rockys way combined with  Ken Chow. Keep up the good work...

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Hi Dean,

nice to meet you again here after Fratelli's thread....

I've added you today in my Skype and hope to follow you soon.

I'm reading your whole thread, but can't wait to join the trading room to see better how to define properly S/D zones.

I think the right identification of Supply/Demand zones could be the real keystone of  successful trading. Thanks for sharing your knoweledge.

I have a Suppl/Demand indi you posted in another thread. Do you still use it?

BTW, just to make some exercise: Here is a Daily Chart of EURUSD.

Have I correctly identified nearest SUPPLY/DEMANDS ZONES?

--- 帖子 #649 ---
I'm happy today..... Why? Coz I made 10 pips.......

You could think: "This guy is crazy"!

I'm not... and I'll tell you why

Yesterday I read 1/2 of this thread and drew a Demand Box on my 5m EURUSD Chart.

Today I set a P.O. (Buy Limit @ 1.3140 SL 1.3130 TP 1.3150) and went out from my home.......

Price bounced right there for >20 pips !!!

I was wandering in the dark until yesterday, jumping from thread to thread whare many people explained complicate theories about market. And the thinghs were two: 1) Nothing worked as they said 2) The sentence was always it's trader's fault in misunderstanding the market (or the whole trading itself)....

Here I've read plain and quiet explanations about how market works, and I've been able to understand and identify in my chart at least one of the Supply/Demand patterns: Rally/Base/Rally...

Well...it worked.....

Maybe beginners luck...? I think not....... and, if we look @ the chart now...the same exact zone became Supply zone.....

Is it just a fluke?

Thank you very much Dean!

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Welcome AZ, so glad people are still getting something from this, it is one of those light up in the dark moments, the moment you finally click on it will change your world

Nice daily supply zone hit on eurusd almost to the pip, with the 38.2 also running through it.

--- 帖子 #652 ---
I'm eyeing off this demand zone on the H1.  It scored quite well in the Odds Enhancers (9/10) and has the Fib Fans going for it - if it reaches that area at that time that is!

Unfortunately, I can't catch your live sessions Dean but I'm very grateful to be able to listen recordings of past ones - thanks very much for that!  In the handful of demo trades I've taken I've been amazed at the accuracy of the S&D method (along with fib rets and fib fans, of course).  Thanks so much for that, too, it's given me new hope that I could be successful at this one day!

Sorry for gushing but it's exciting stuff

Regards,

--- 帖子 #653 ---
You have to be very careful here you just commited the first and most popular rookie mistake of supply and demand, what you marked is a swing low and is NOT a demand area, for an area to be vaild we need conolidation of price an equlibrium if you will.

--- 帖子 #654 ---
Dean, I just stumbled upon this thread and wanted to thank you for sharing so much of your knowledge. I'd like to join your Skype traderoom, and have added dean.guile to my contacts in Skype. Can you relate the remaining details of how to join the room? For example, is there a specific time it's open?

Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #655 ---
Thanks for the clarification!  Would this mean that the zone below (as per screenshot below) would be more appropriately labelled a Demand Zone?

If I've understood correctly, we want price to be in balance/equilibrium at the 'base' before rapidly moving in either the buyer's or seller's direction?  If so, would this then be termed a Drop > Base > Rally?

--- 帖子 #656 ---
I thought about it some more and realised that what I originally marked as a Demand Zone doesn't fit either of the descriptions Drop > Base > Rally or Rally > Base > Rally.

Back to looking for proper zones!

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Hey Psd,

If you having problems locating the correct S/D why don't you download the S/D indicator which Dean has uploaded, I found it really useful and use it on all my charts, takes out lot of the stress locating the correct S/D hope this helps

one of Sam Seiden's Odds Enhancers is TIME AT LEVEL which is described as:

In a post above Dean said:

I understand that my area was a swing low and not a Demand zone - that is very clear now and I thank you very much for pointing that out.

What I'm not clear on is whether or not we want equilibrium.  Are the definitions of equilibrium different in each case?

/psd

--- 帖子 #661 ---
Basically what we want to see is sideways price action, but not to a point of extreme consolidation, around 3 or 4 bars is the best to look for and then the shoot out from the area. SL and SH are only 1-2 bars but remember to always look left, that second time u attempted to mark a demand zone u have to look left and you see this is already one thats in action.

--- 帖子 #662 ---
Excellent, thanks very much for explaining it!

/psd

--- 帖子 #663 ---
This was one of my recent trades from this post

http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...78#post5374878

notice the sideways action, for a few bars nothing major

lots of fighting going on, pins up and down then finally the bears pushed and quite hard when they won, so selling here was a no brainer for me.

--- 帖子 #664 ---
That makes sense, thanks again!

Here's one I missed this morning - my own fault.

--- 帖子 #665 ---
not bad

rally base rally here, only one bar wide, but of course these will work, but they are not as strong as the ones mentioned earlier. Also try plotting a fibs, sometimes you will be pleasently surprised when fib levels fall perfectly in line with these levels.

--- 帖子 #666 ---
I plotted a fib ret on the H1  from the obvious low to the obvious high and the gray line you can barely see is the 23.6 though, from what I've read, 23.6 isn't that important.  I think you guys say the 50 and especially 61.8 are good?  I haven't got around to using Fib Fans as I want to get the basics down first

Yeah, I have recently made notes in my 'rules' to look at the big picture trend then look for drop > base > rally or rally > base > drop zones as they have a higher probability of working out.

Sorry about the image quality, too - it looks great on my monitor but I think the resolution is too big (about 2500x1200) so the server must lower it and it makes it barely legible.  I'll start uploading them with lower resolution but zoomed in so hopefully they will be clearer.

--- 帖子 #667 ---
good, but now watch the magic really hit you hard, its ok doing the extremes but remember, as long as its a swing low or high you can use it as a fib point, now look at chart 1 38.2 from this fib runs smack bang on your levels you marked, now even better chart 2 using this swing low as our point we get the "MAGIC" 61.8 running smack bang also through the zone. Just doing these simple things really shows you the power of an area. IT even still impresses me, when i plotted these fibs just now.

--- 帖子 #668 ---
Wow, that's fantastic!

Thanks so much for showing me that, a fib ret isn't much help if I don't know how to use it

--- 帖子 #669 ---

Hey FOURX, sorry for the late reply.  No, I haven't attended it actually I've only listened to the first of the recorded sessions from post 1.

All I've read is that you probably need to add Dean to Skype, in other posts he says his username is:

sorry for the lack of response, the skype chatroom is still active, but to be honest im more active in this thread where i can posts pictures and charts, i had to stop the webinars as my own trading was being harmed so i had to concentrate back on my trading. I also got an oppertunity which is another factor in leaving the webinars, but the recording are still on post 1 for all to watch.

Hey Dean, like you I study Sam's techniques but went away from it.  Started reading your thread and giving it another try.  Would love your comments on this daily chart.  Thanks....Dan

--- 帖子 #678 ---
hi and welcome, sorry for the delayed reply.

Only thing i would advise although it seemed you have made some good profits on these areas, what i would like to see is more of a "surge" away in price from those areas rather than what i see on this chart you attached, this just give a very high probability of a profitable trade.

--- 帖子 #679 ---
I entered this near perfect trade 2 weeks ago, and now im sitting very pretty on this one, beautiful supply zones, notice we have consolidation, what makes it perfect is its not too much consolidation and also not too little 3-5 bars or so is perfect, and have been waiting for that level for a while, im about 190 pips up on this so far, max drawdown was about 40 pips, SL is 70 pips, so thats a kick ass risk reward right there.

These levels can be found numerous times, nice consolidation of 3-5 bars, sharp initial drop out that area, and also price travelled alot further away, and also been away for a while allowing orders to mature in that area for a while now. and just for confluence i ran a fib extension, just like i learnt from Rockys thread and 161.8 sat absolutely perfect right through my marked level, i would be a fool not to put my sell order in there after doing this analysis.

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Hey dean

I am a new member and stranded here. Some time ago I went to see sam taught about the SD, then I tried to practice but still has many difficulties, especially in identifying the primary zone, the price sometimes pass right in my zone. Hopefully here I get enlightenment.

This is a great thread I hope this thread will be busy as in the beginning so I can get the answer to that question later

--- 帖子 #681 ---
Hi Dean,

I was inspired by your recordings. Been trying to learn about S/D but still having some struggles. Are you still running the room? (Recently added you on skype)

Thanks

--- 帖子 #682 ---
Hi dean

Just started reading through thread and really want to get involved in s+d trading. Could you with your own words describe how to pinpoint supply and demand levels please, the exact method you use - what you look for, where you draw it. Ive had a small look through sam seidens works but to be honest I still feel lost! Just looking back over some of your charts I think to myself why diddn't he draw the supply level there, or here. Just trying to get the nailed down as in my heart I know this is the only way to trade

Thanks

--- 帖子 #683 ---
Hi, i recorded a few of my webinars that can be found in post 1, most of them i start the first hour or 2 teaching and showing ppl my trades and techniques.

--- 帖子 #684 ---
Hi Dean, just watching some webinars now, just have a quick question I hope you can answer. In the screenshot below, (taken from your webinar)  where the green rectangle is, we dont see much consolidation/balance - just 2 candles and second one extends past first by quite a bit. Does this matter too much? as long as we see a violent surge and then confirm it with fib levels?.

And just wanted to see if I could spot the previous supply zone. Is that correct where I have marked?

Oh and you dont sound like a brummie, so whats going on supporting villa! ha. You're teaching a scouser now.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #685 ---
IT may not look like consolidation on H1 chart but down on m30 or m15 it would have, but look left to and see if its fresh.

--- 帖子 #686 ---
Ok, learnt something then by going down a timeframe to tidy the zone up. What are your thoughts on this from today. First shot shows 5 min tf, second is 1 min. I first had a wider and less accurate zone just by looking at 5 min then drawing it out. Swapped down to 1 min and got a much more accurate zone and price touched and retraced perfectly to the pip.

Diddnt think it was a great zone still due to not a violent enough move down, feels a little harder to judge on smaller timeframes. What do you think of it though? and reguarding take profits, im thinking your using fibs to give you an idea when to take - generally closing half off and moving sl to be? Thanks

Also, on gpb/usb I cant seem to get the zones marked right. The top zone looks the better one (which hasn't been touched yet). I went into m1 and amended the size of zone.  Why wouldn't the second zone I drew (bottom one) be a zone? Is there too much consolidation?

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

And last one...usd/cad. To me this looks like an excellent zone except its a little over consolidated before it, just really wanna know your thoughts on these screenshots. Notice the 61.8 fib lands perfectly on this usd/cad. Thanks again, hope I'm understanding it slowly

ah well trade got stop loss taken but it done as predicted which has made me happy. Any tips on why it got taken out? was my zone not correct?. Happy to just predict something like that though before it happened.

I try to practice to place the zone Supply and Demand, please response from you. If any I would appreciate knowing his mistake

--- 帖子 #690 ---
Demand 1 is good, nice little consolidation then price went away, demand 2 and 3 not so good they are more swing lows

--- 帖子 #691 ---
Thank you Dean has answered my question, Connecting to the previous question, your comment of the zone demand but no supply a comment to the zone does that mean it is correct.

You say demand 2 and 3 are not so good because of low swing and I still have a word from you before "commited the first and most popular rookie mistake of supply and demand, what you marked is a swing low and is NOT a demand area, for an area to be vaild we need conolidation of price an equlibrium if you will." it often happens to me.

Next I want to ask whether the definition of a swing low or swing high? Please be explained, sorry with this stupid question but I really do not know it. The rest of the chart

http://i2.lulzimg.com/451da20d9d.gif

--- 帖子 #692 ---
easiest way to explain a swing low, is if its a V shape then thats a swing low, most probably a reaction to a already consumed area. A real demand zone will look more like a U shape, where 2-4 bars occur alongside each other before bursting away, we would now know this is a fresh area where the buyers have won the battle, so high chances a retest the buyers will be in control again.

--- 帖子 #693 ---
Hi Dean,

Thank you for the thread..

I'm so new to this S/D thing... Could you (or anyone here) help me with my S/D zone?

Thanks

--- 帖子 #694 ---
Thank you for your explanation of the dean thanks now i understand about the swing, then I will try to find the zone that the real supply and demand, and hopes to reduce the error in determining a zone.

After getting an explanation from you for the EURJPY pair above I like the demand zone 1, as you say this is a new area that you also meet the criteria described as a U shape and Fibo 61.8 coincidence, actually I also do not understand very well how to draw the Fibo I was just looking at your thread.

--- 帖子 #695 ---
hey dean is still there, I want to ask is related to the last question, I am happy because I mark the zone of fun yesterday and bounced about 120 pips but I do not entry because I was new in this school system and am learning, I hope someone here lucky.

Yesterday before bouncing seems to make the base or the equlibrium price first, and now the price of the equlibrium test (white box), I was confused but want to ask what I saw yesterday formed an equlibrium in a short time in the test zone anymore now is it likely it will be penetrated . How is your response is associated with SD.

dean, nice work. since i learned and used supdem i haven't used fibs. i can see it is rather good for confluence tool to measure the strength of a zone.

i will spend some time today to back-test this.

here is of my first back-searches i did using a fib and an extension..

Hi phi1ipp,

I don't know if i can call myself experienced but i'll share the levels i'm watching on audusd with you guys.

I'm not a short term trader, my trading chart is on H4, sometime i go down to H1 to find levels so i can reduce my risk.

Red line is sup and dem on D1

Dotted red line is where i'll take my entri (from H4)

Orange is sup and dem on H4

Dotted orange line is where i'll take my entri (from H1)

Hi Alvin,

thank you for the reply. May I ask you a question how do you plan your TP level?

--- 帖子 #704 ---
Picture perfect trade, textbook!

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Dean (or anyone) how important is it to you that price retraces back to our supply/demand level in a strong fashion? I notice Sam Seiden doesn't talk about this much, I also know he doesn't give everything away. Im sure I heard somewhere you took his paid course.

Will you only take trades which leave in a strong fashion and return to zone in a strong fashion?, Also notice how the trade diddn't 'mature' for awhile....and also if may look like that zone has had previous touches, but if you look back I wouldn't of called it a zone at previous touches, because price diddnt surge away strongly enough, I'd love to hear your take on the trade (or anyone with experience) and any planned future wedinars? Thanks

--- 帖子 #705 ---
Hi phi1ipp,

sorry for the late reply, i got some problem on my desktop.

my TP depends on the situation, but usually when i gain 1:1 (example if level is 30 pips wide and price has move away from level 30 pips) i'll close 1/3 or 1/2 of my position and move stop to BE then close the rest of position on support/resistance or opposing level.

my english is not good, here's the link to my chart on audusd trade http://screencast.com/t/sZPBJ0W6NDD6

1 is where i'll close 1/2 of my position and move stop to BE

2 and 3 is where i'll might close the rest

hope it help, happy trading

--- 帖子 #706 ---
Could someone also explain why after I spotted a supply level (top two horizontal lines) another supply formed a bit further down.  Why would I of not taken the second supply level down as a proper 'level'?. This is where I seem to go wrong, I'll mark out a good supply level and whilst waiting for the reversal to come back to it, I'll spot another level and draw it in and try and trade from that.

I havent gone down timeframes to tidy the level up, just wanted to show as an example. Is it to do with not doing fib studies on them? or am I missing something else. I'd be grateful to anyone who can explain it, especially dean!

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

You could even argue there was a demand level forming under the second supply level I drew out, as price started to take off again. So 2 losers right there, as first zone wasnt hit. Been watching some of your vids too...still seeking the answer to this question though . Thx

PS. Just done a fib study on it, and 23.6 fib level was right by the second 'supply' area...whats up?!

--- 帖子 #707 ---
Just another example of a losing trade.

My question is how wide the supply zone should be in terms of SL placement?

1) Is my zone defined correctly?

2) Where the SL should be? Above the upper supply?

Alvin, thank you for your answers! I'm watching Dean's video but they're bloody huge  14 hrs!

--- 帖子 #708 ---
Not that I'm the most experienced with it but your zone seems correct, but you put your sl a few pips higher than top end of zone, which you would still be in the trade as it stands. Just brought same chart up and it did indeed turn into a loser. It was also nearer to an m15 supply level and a 1hour supply. You also had fibs lining up. So maybe it was just a loser, not sure if dean posts here anymore seemed like a good thread too. I'd like to see an answer

--- 帖子 #709 ---
Yeah, i got losing trade too on audusd, i didn't watch it move 1:1 cause i went to sleep, should've take some and move stop to BE, but lost is a lost, there's always another trade around

I'll try to answer your question according to my opinion

1. On low timeframe it's best to trade rally base drop and drop base rally. Drop base drop on low timeframe is less reliable then high timeframe.

2. On majors usually i use 5 to 10 pips above supply level.

And yes, Dean's videos are huge, lol

Here's the same M5 chart, don't know if i drew the zone correctly

I see you are scalping.. I scalp too with 8pips sl and and 8pips target..This looks interesting will check your thread

--- 帖子 #711 ---
Its worrying dean has gone and that in the later posts his method changed from simply supply and demand to adding ridiculous indicators from symphonie thread. Theres deffinately something to supply and demand, but it looks like most have stopped trading deans method.

--- 帖子 #712 ---
Hi Chewz, both your levels are way off, those are not supply areas at all.

--- 帖子 #713 ---
hey buddy, that supply area you picked for your trade was a really bad one, i dont even consider it a supply zone. i would have never taken it. One of the main things to consider is " how did price leave that area? you need to see long abnormal candles away from that area. I dont trade smaller time frames, lowest ill go is 1H but if i did, id look at overall direction from a higher timeframe and trade it in that direction too. Here is an example of a supply area, notice the "violent move away from the area" hope this helps. I have been trading this method for the last 2 or 3 weeks and damn, its the best thing ive discoverd in forex. its all about picking your levels.

EDIT: 20 mins later - read 2 post below to see what happend when price touched this 5 min supply area.

--- 帖子 #714 ---
I am posting my 3 trades taken this week with real supply/demand areas highlighted and my entries and exits, notice the large candles. Those are true supply and demand areas. Also you will see I exited them early cuz price really moved away alot. The last trade was taken 30 mins ago and I expect the price to move much more. I hope this helps you guys identify the areas, dont just pick any, pick the really good ones.

If you got any questions, just holler but mind you, im still learning to master this method too. So far, this is the best method I have used in 3 and a half years of trading and I only been trading this method for 2 or 3 weeks.

--- 帖子 #715 ---
mind you, the 5 minute eur/jpy supply area i mentioned above as an example was not that great as only after posting did i realize that the overall trend was bulish, even so , as soon as price touched the level, it just dropped. so you would have risked 3 pips and gained 12 pips (4:1).

Its dropping more as i type.

--- 帖子 #716 ---
Hi guys have not been on FF in a small while as you can probably notice, yes i very much still trade this method as my core of anything i do. Its my bread and butter. Alvin for one knows that i still do   anyways ill try get myself on here a bit more, been busy doing stuff with Xbox but i wont get into that

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Welcome back, Dean!

Are you still using your skype room for sharing your method?

--- 帖子 #718 ---
Thanks, again i havent been on skype in a while, i got overwhelmed on there by people adding me and non stop people talking to me i got lost in skype in the end, so im giving that a break.

--- 帖子 #719 ---
Hi Guyz,

wanna share my today's trade with you. TP was defined as two times risk which was still lower than min value after the supply zone had been formed.

Thank you Dean for nice thread and sharing your  method!

--- 帖子 #720 ---
No problem, keep it up, try to look for more consolidiation rather than a V or shape

Waiting for a PA to climb up to the Supply. It looks pretty promising

--- 帖子 #722 ---
Remember this post?  I had a pink supply zone above with a pending limit order to sell at this zone. I decided later that it wasn't a proper zone. Not a super drop down, bla bla bla... and deleted the order! Just take a look what's happened later  Now it's a m15 chart just to make it lil bit shorter to see!

In the night I was absolutely sure that it's a good S-zone with confluences of Fibo Retracements. Good lesson for me to be self asured and confident!

PS - A pink zone below the PA is a Demand zone where I went long with a TP at dashed line around 1.626x

--- 帖子 #723 ---
Wow thats a bummer u deleted the order, but its still nice to see what you predicted happen, the confidence is always good, but dont let it get to you too much to turn it to greed, keep a cool head and look for the next oppertunity by the looks of this post you have and have pulled off nicely good job

--- 帖子 #724 ---
Nice trade phi1ipp, i didn't get those two

Here's where i draw my levels http://screencast.com/t/YVCB3Ms8dv

And keep the confidence

--- 帖子 #725 ---
That's how I would have drawn mine as well; the bottom of the supply zone would touch more candle open/close levels. Attached is the zoomed in screenshot.

--- 帖子 #726 ---
patiently waiting for this AUSUSD 15M setup, dont really trade the lower timeframes, but will give this one a go. Daily trend and 4 HR trend both showing bearish although keep in mind big news coming out the US later today.

Hi guyz,

had a zero profit trade from yesterday because of an incorrect TP level. Now watching for a PA to reach my pending orders. Wanna share with you. Please comment

Here's a nice level on aussie, nice turn after small touch

I didn't watch it got hit, it was a limit order.
http://screencast.com/t/i7GI8q4D

--- 帖子 #731 ---
Great  But I wouldn't have taken that as I usualy don't take such a levels. I prefer to look at huge rallies or drops.

BTW An interesting question I would ask Sam if I had a chance how does he treat levels that look like steep rally on H1 while on M15 they are 4 "white soldiers"

--- 帖子 #732 ---
The answer he would give, would be, if your trading the H1 and u see the zone, then trade from that chart, only ever move UP a timeframe to check for obvious zones that u could be trading against, try not to go down TFs if ur say trading on H1.

--- 帖子 #733 ---
So , 1st trade on 15M, +30 pips, gona give this lower timeframe a go from now on.

--- 帖子 #734 ---
Another 2 trades taken on 15M

EURGBP +20 Pips

GBPCHF +15 Pips

Should have held on to them much longer but still testing the lower timeframes. I must admit, lots of potential on the 15M

So 3 trades today total 65 Pips

--- 帖子 #735 ---
Very good, that first top picture you attached is absolutely perfect, price consolidated while the battle occured and broke upwards with "FORCE, price had been away for a while then was all of asudden attracted to that area like someone wanted it there so they could get filled  when price got there no surprise it shot up, pictures like that make me proud.

--- 帖子 #736 ---
very quite these days, guess everybody is making money

--- 帖子 #737 ---
I had couple of losses as well and couple of near touches which were very frustrating. Price nearly came to my pending orders and then strongly retraced!

A lot of reading as well. Found an archive of articles by Sam Seiden and other authors on TradingAcademy.com

http://lessons.tradingacademy.com/ar...?ny=2011&nm=11

Still fighting with a TP level definition. Now it works for me as an opposite level. On 15 minutes charts it's about 30-40 pips, sometimes smaller.

--- 帖子 #738 ---
so far only took one trade this week, that went well. its been a really slow week, not many S+D areas. For the higher timeframes even worst, nothing worth trading. Dont see this week getting any better as markets seem to be moving only in 1 direction mostly.

--- 帖子 #739 ---
open your eyes more and you shall see the light, you telling me you have not spotted this?

--- 帖子 #740 ---
Yup, spotted that one last week, already have my order there waiting, still been a slow week, i have about 10+ potential zones but none have been hit yet, nothing on higher timeframes. on a normal week i would have already closed about 3-4 trades on the 4H.

Was bored today so took this scalp off the 15M AUD/CAD

EDIT: TP Already hit

--- 帖子 #741 ---
Isnt this just so fustrating, missing ur trigger by 1 or 2 pips

--- 帖子 #742 ---
HAPPENS to the best of us, i had this demand zone on my radar for a while on the H4, all with a 50fib running through it too, was too perfect but missed my entry by 10 pips, which is not alot on H4 charts. Ah well plenty more round the corner.

trade today

eurjpy

did any get this trade today, right off the 61.8 to the absolute pip, right at a picture pefect demand zone, consolidation and shoot up in price, perfectly played, still time to get entry, i can show you the ingreidients people, but you need to make the pie

--- 帖子 #745 ---
granted this trade here is well under way already, but this is purely for educational purposes again, got a beautiful looking demand zone, consolidation and shoot up in price, showing buyers are the winners in this area, fib level lies dead on the mark, buying here knowing this information is very powerful stuff, like i said making the pie isnt hard when you get the right ingredients.

--- 帖子 #746 ---
Yup, i'm watching that level too. Just got beaten 40 pips on the wick above that level at 1.0073 with sl at 1.0033. But that's just another loss, there's always another chance

Right now waiting for the limit buy at 0.9966 and 0.9919

--- 帖子 #747 ---
2 nice levels for today GBP USD and AUDJPY

Closed them off way too early, not really sure why as price took off after closing them.

--- 帖子 #748 ---
hey only20gp

I am fairly new but from what I have read the better setups are the ones where the consolidation lasted for a few candles. Is that correct?

--- 帖子 #749 ---
Personaly for me, i have never really looked at it that way, for me its about

1> how price left the level, quicker, stronger = better

2> How far did it travel before it retraced back to the level

3> if going short, is there a demand level close by? if there is i stay away

if going long, is there a demand level close by? if there is i stay away

4> very very very important, overall direction of the trend. If im trading the 15M chart and price hits a damand level, I look at the direction of the 4H and Daily, if they are against my 15M setup I stay away. only trade with the trend, it almost doubles your chances of success.

But if trading the 4H, i dont really pay attention to that. but one thing i then do when tradng the 4H is drop down to the 15 M and look at how price really left the area. I trade this way and right now I can say im hitting about 90% win ratio

dont pick every level, pick the really good ones. "eliminate your risks"

But this is just my way. I keep it really simple.

Oh, lastly, since most people here trade spot forex (against the broker) my stops are usually higher than most other traders. as brokers normally know the avarage supply demand trader will put there stop just after the level, so alot of times price will go just over the level to take out stops and then reverse. but thats my style of trading and it works for me

--- 帖子 #750 ---
Your doing well, well done, the consolidation thing is important, but if how your approaching it is working for you, then keep it up

Dean,

Just discovered this thread. Must say looks very good. Looking forward to watching along and hopefully contributing.

--- 帖子 #753 ---
we are now in or at this demand zone i posted last week, i have closed out my short and will look at this demand area closely as london opens  dont say i didnt warn you, no cherry picking here, the chart im reffering to was posted last week in the post i have quoted above.

--- 帖子 #754 ---
Coincidence? or the law of supply and demand?  its not hard

So the area i marked last week has found buyers not only found buyers but right at the fib level too to the absolute pip, its a joy to watch, good analysis? or just coincidence? over time i can tell you, its good analysis but best part is what it was easy analysis took me less than 20 seconds to see that demand zone and put a fib on the chart.

Ok so if these demand buyers can now push it above parity then i will be watching like a hawk, this chart was posted for you guys last week in this thread, like i said no cherry picking here.

--- 帖子 #755 ---
Hi Dean,

I'm watching this pair too. But to minimize risk I made a small investigation on H4 TF and defined D-zone lil bit lower. Have a pending order there so... Hope that bears will push a PA lower to trigger my order

--- 帖子 #756 ---
yup, was on that one too, closed 30 pips profit and it retraced.

Daily view and 30M view.

this trade on demand i mentioned last week i was in on it, got 50 pips in the positive, so i moved stop to BE but i am now out of that trade, remember these zones are ALWAYS at least good enough for a reaction to get into breakeven.

I took these trades, already got some profit from some long trades before.

It's a war zone between bull and bear right now, i'll stay with this long positions until it break the zone

--- 帖子 #769 ---
guys u need to be careful couple of these trades are taken from swing lows rather than a demand zone u need to know the difference, for example look at this GBPJPY trade a poster took a few posts ago, this is a swing low, not a demand zone can easily be broken, there was no consolidation equal bars in a row etc, showing equlibrium. Once you can tell the difference your strike rate will increase.

--- 帖子 #770 ---
Now here is a quick trade i took today while we are trending strongly, notice the long row of bars all nearly in line, its NOT a swing high, its a perfect eqilbrium, price was stuck there for a while, then it broke down, I now know this area has "FRESH" sellers sitting there, coz it was equal so thats how i know they are fresh winners. I got 40 pips from this move from a 19 pip risk.

You can find these all over the place on all timeframes, remember a swing high or low is not fresh, ignore swings, look for equal balance like this, nice long balance where price is pretty much going in a straight line.

--- 帖子 #771 ---
2 differences on the same chart, now im not saying eurusd will not go up here it might do, but not a trade for me, as u can see its not quite equlbrium, now notice my upper level where i sold at, price perfectly went in a straight line for a few days like a rectangle before price broke down. These are the subtle differences u need to watch out for.

--- 帖子 #772 ---
Interesting observation as Sam tells that the less a price was in a zone the more is inbalance and the stronger is move out off the zone. According to you it's vice versa, isn't it?

--- 帖子 #773 ---
No thats exactly true!! but u still need the equilibrium, look at my chart above price found a eqilbrium, the upper level im talking, and only there for 3 bars or so and left, next time price visited didnt even get a chance, it went straight down, no drawdown whatsoever.

This is where people are getting confused, we need price to stall and make a eqilibrium, BUT the shorter time is better BUT i say again, it still needs to make an eqilbrium.

What you guys are doing are going look its demand, its a swing low, because price didnt stay there long, NONONONO!!!!!! thats demand being used up from somewhere else, we dont wanna trade OLD demand, so when it creates a sideways movement we now know at least this area is fresh once it breaks out one way!!

--- 帖子 #774 ---
Thank you Dean!

You made a post of a great value as I noticed that what's looking as a proper zone doesn't work as expected. I'd like you make some comments and observations as a topic starter and an experienced SD-trader! I strongly believe that everybody will benefit a lot out of your posts.

And may I ask you to comment the pic? Here there are 2 zones: are they valid and which one would you have taken?

--- 帖子 #775 ---
Nope, actualy got stopped out by like 1 pip or so before price retraced. very fustrating.

--- 帖子 #776 ---
That is a swing and not valid supply the validsupply was slightly above where price reacted im on phone at mo so cant show chart

--- 帖子 #777 ---
Can you see now where you traded from was a swing high and was that only, it was NOT a supply zone, the real zone was slightly above where price congested and went sideways, that area you traded from was actually the first touch of the supply i marked, hence it didnt go far into it, todays entry into supply which is second touch went much deeper which of course makes sense, coz orders have already been filled from the first touch of the supply, you see how easy it becomes if you can learn from these mistakes you will spot these in the future.

--- 帖子 #778 ---
Is this the same picture Dean? I don't like the wick though.

--- 帖子 #779 ---
yes thats a good area you picked, thats more like it, congestion of candles its not a swing, and it wasnt in balance for long, you would be unlucky if that didnt play out

--- 帖子 #780 ---

--- 帖子 #783 ---
Hi Dean,

I know you're probably too busy with your trading but when you have a chance could you please describe how exactly a gap should be treated in terms of SD zones? Sam mentioned that a gap usualy means extreme level of supply or demand. But how exactly can we use it? Where should be a zone marked? Is it relevant to Forex weekend and holiday gaps?

Thank you in advance! Your explanations are awesome and worth thousands of articles  Peer to peer questions and answers helps a lot!

--- 帖子 #784 ---
I differ from Sams views here, as theres no such things as Gaps, markets are open all week sat and sun.

--- 帖子 #785 ---
Hi guys,

Nice thread you have going here. Ive been following it for a few days now read through it watch some of the suggested videos of Sam. I am primarily a hardcore J16er (i mix a small bit of fundy to add more confluence to my trades but not most of the time). Ive been following the J16 thread for about a year now and have gotten pretty good with the technique.

Now James teaches how to identify trouble areas like PPZ (pivot point Zones which consist of Support & resistance  levels) amongst other things. Many people on the thread have many different variations on how to identify these levels but primarily what it is about is trying to figure out zones where there is excess demand or supply and using that to benefit.

My biggest problem to date has been entry points and stop placements and exits. Using the J16 technique i can achieve a very high strike rate in a successful move but my weakness is the question "where to enter & where to exit". As a result most of the time my orders hit my stop and go in the right direction or my order never gets filled and starts going in the right direction or my order reverses before hitting my TP to go back and break me even. I understand that these have to be learned from trial and error and ultimately experience of developing a keen eye for identification how the trade will be managed. But this dilemma is what has brought me here to this thread. I hope to add trade management skills to my arsenal from here.

So without rambling on any more, I will get to the point. My question is regarding the chart below. Please take a look and see if I am missing the picture .

Best,

--- 帖子 #786 ---
Welcome

That lower supply u marked is not so good, not much of a move away, no maturation of move etc, but that upper level is beautiful, and you are right the last time it went through sell orders were all consumed, but u see the first time it went back there, sell orders completely took over and wouldve been a super easy trade, as for targets, try and mark the nearest demand zone in the other direction even if its a iffy looking demand, doesnt matter as its our target and as long as its minimum of 1:1 risk reward then pull the trigger, move SL to be as soon as you are comfortable in the trade, so halfway to target is a position i usually move stops. hope this helps

Dean

hey guys how do i share my charts on this thread with everyone can someone give me the steps

--- 帖子 #788 ---
Hi Dean,

Thanks for your response. The reason I mention the rather weak level in the chart was because I made a certain observation. Now lets see if I can choose the right words to put it.

Whenever I open my charts to observe supply and demand I see that wherever there has been even a relatively smallish move up/down (even if its one bar or a couple with no heavy momentum), price will always react to the edge of the bar that lies behind the bar with which the up/down move started when it retraces back to that point. This is ofcourse what you taught in the beginning bits of this thread on how to place the zone i.e. with the previous bar (previous bull bar in down move/previous bear bar in up move).

In fact I have noticed that this coincides with all the trend lines one tends to create. It is always price going back to pick up more orders each time at a lower level which measures up to the previous bar area. And when the orders of that move are finished, then price breaks through and

ignores those zones and goes back in the other direction until it finds more orders from a prior move not yet tested. Given this, one can say with atleast 80 to 90% certainty were price will be reacting. The heavier the previous momentum and the fewer the touches the more it will move in that set direction.

I see one problem with this though. R:R. in most cases, even though price reacts as anticipated, the R:R is not viable to take the trade. i would imagine this would be atleast 1:1 for 50% strike rate to break even in the long run. But then we have running trades. But with 80% strike rate (assuming) if we adjust our R:R to 1:0.125, we should also break even in the long run. If return is anything greater than 0.125 then we should be profitable. Is this something that you have even done considering that your strike rate is obviously much higher than 50:50 which is evident from the live trading posts in the beginning of this thread.

Anyway I have posted the chart below to illustrate what I am trying to say above. Its the same chart I was watching yesterday and posted a question with below. Apart from this I have taken 2 other trades today both successful. minimal draw down for which Ill post the charts later as I am in a rush.. I'm liking this already...

Hey Dean,

This time I waited for some PA. But don't know if that was the right thing to do. Not only was there greater drawdown but it came at a cost of at least 20 pip. Im not certain how useful PA would be for this trading approach.

A touch trade would certainly come at a lower risk. Whats your opinion on this?

Hi Cashforex,

Your entry point was at a swing not a supply zone. If you notice on the below chart the supply was created 2 swings ago. The latest 2 swings were not fresh but reaction to the first supply zone. So when you entered on the 3rd retrace, supply at that level was exhausted and demand won. Therefore it shot straight up.

I, as a rule, do not take even the second swing point for a trade. I will only trade this method if Price is retracing back to fresh supply level. But everyone can have their own preferences. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #798 ---
This was a good zone. I was watching this since yesterday as well. However I scrapped this and went for eurjpy instead (as per my post below) for one reason.

This is my reasoning but again this is specific to the way I trade. I usually like to look at 2 EMA's on my charts. the 150 and the 365. In my experience and what I have learned over the years is that they are quite reactive as support and resistance and also add confluence to a trade decision making process. Now notice the below charts. The blow line is the 365 and the red line is the 150.

For EJ the 150 lay pretty much on the supply level. For UJ it was below. We can then see that it tried to pierce through but then 365 was right above it. It could not cross the 365 and came shooting back down before it reached the standard supply zone where your entry is placed.

Since this move has started, I would remove the sell limit now. But of course the choice is yours. Let me know if that makes sense.

Remember you cant blindly go into trades where there are supply and demand zones. You need confluence. This thread as a compulsion uses FIB and S/D zone to enter. I on the other hand look for more confluences e.g. FIBS, EMA, RN(round numbers), Divergence, S/R levels. Also I like to go with the trend unless there has been a very strong move recently in the opposite direction. I would consider it but then would have very tight management on the trade.

Hope this helps.

Hi Guys what you think

your views please

I like the picture  but need to wait it'll happen. It looks like EUR is under a strong downward pressure.

Stopped out here. Should have closed on +50 but got greedy. Oh well lesson learned still ended at 0.5% return.

back from a much needed holidays, time to start trading again.

some zones im watching . . .

anybody else watching these?

--- 帖子 #815 ---
Hi only20gp,

As far as AUD/CAD is concerned I am in 2 minds with these because there have already been responses to the initial supply. But if one was to consider other factors like DIV and TL's it looks good. I have entered one on NZDCAD on some J16 based PA& s/d. which would give the same results as your two pairs. So technically speaking i am also taking the same side as you.

Also just wanted to say that your two pairs are highly positively correlated so my suggestion take only one because you will be exposing your self to twice the risk otherwise.

Best,

Canceling order.... demand building just before supply area.

--- 帖子 #817 ---
is anyone watching this one

--- 帖子 #818 ---
Yeah, saw that level, should hold, only danger being - shorting into a D1 demand level.

--- 帖子 #819 ---
I'm curious as to how you are getting your supply and demand zones. I been through the 1st 5 or 6 pages of this thread and see no explanation anywhere

I guess its a secret society or something

--- 帖子 #820 ---
What about this setup

--- 帖子 #821 ---
No did't see that one, also the AUDUSD seemed to have hit some h1 supply just before the h4 level we were looking at...

Can anyone explain why we could have seen this before going with the sell limit?

--- 帖子 #822 ---
Just wait its going to climb to H4

--- 帖子 #823 ---
To my eyes, the AU H1 supply looks more like a pivot/pullback to the RBD level just above between 9933/9918.

The main issue for me trading the pivot short would be the pockets of H1 demand just below us - no RR.

--- 帖子 #824 ---
Cashforex, still learning the forex thing, this is the first methodology, I have tried and so get worried about not spotting these kind of things before hand. I agree, it should come through...

--- 帖子 #830 ---
It is crazy!!! Who is the broker?

--- 帖子 #831 ---
Hantec Markets. They are ECN so I dont know how they could jump the spreads so drastically like that. Fine liquidity has been llow as US was off but this is just unfair ii think....

--- 帖子 #832 ---
Kind of weird situation...

It looks like they have computerized dealing desk over there.

--- 帖子 #834 ---
Guys,

Look for S/D in the daily Chart and then come down to the H4 to place your order, this is the method I have been using I don't go any lower then H1 the most for an entry, it takes out lot of the noise,

The Short time frames will give you more set ups but not reliable, plus its less stress full, rest is your decision

For those who are unable read the S/D go through the whole thread dean gives an excellent explanation how to identify the S/D

I will keep on posting my set ups to share with you guys let me know if If I can be more of help to anyone

Great tip, Cashforex.

This is the method that I've been putting effort into the most lately

as well; identify S/D on the dailies and then trade the trend in between.

--- 帖子 #836 ---
Been eying this since last week. Beautiful hidden DIV, BRN 0.99, top of TL. + heavy supply zone. No touch trade this time decided to wait for some PA. Entered on break of IB on M15.

Taken half off at +30. SL at BE. rest running long term. If my broker doesn't do what he did yesterday.

Hello everyone,

I have been reading the thread and studying Sam and Dean's videos.  I have been trading for about 2 years now.  On and off with live money.  I have been trading lately with Chris Lori's protradersclub.  His teachings are great, but I feel like I am still missing something.  I must say that I have had a couple of Aa ha moments since reading this thread and watching Dean's videos.  So thanks Dean for starting this thread.

I wanted to see if I could get a little help.  I have posted a chart with a supply zone and I am just curious if someone could give me a critique on the selected zone.  I am only demoing this strategy at the moment, but I can definitely see the value.

Thanks in advance and I hope to make some new friends and help excel my trading along with helping kill some of the time while waiting on a seat in the market.

--- 帖子 #844 ---
Hi Sid,

Im no Dean, but im going to give my 2 cents worth anyway. Seems like you identified a perfect zone but might not have market it out very well which is why as you can see the price reversed just below the zone you marked out. One of the things Dean has taught in this thread to mark out a zone is to notice the lows of the ranging bars just before the breakout. The more level the zones the more price is in equilibrium at that level and the more likely it is to react to that level in the future. The zone you marked is slightly above the the level where prices are consolidating. If you see the bottom yellow line on chart 1, you can see how all the bars could not close below that level. Thats a good entry point IMO.

Furthermore the level has lots of confluence so thats very good. The reversal is at a 1.56 BRN and a significant daily pivot. RSI (and this is what I use and cant speak for anyone else) is showing excellent hidden divergence another + FIBs lining up very well. Very high probability trade. If I wasn't shorting NZD today I would have taken this up.

Keep it up and keep posting.

Best,

-H

--- 帖子 #845 ---
Thanks Goldfish for the help.  You seem to have a good grasp on this method from what I have read.  So your answer is valuable.  One of the things I am still not comfortable with is marking the exact width of the zone.  I seem to be marking good zones, but in trying to lower my risk I tend to draw the zones to narrow.  Just like this time.  With my research I have not been able to find a good resource for the basic rules for marking the zones.  I know the first video Dean put out there was a brief discussion on it and it helped, but still left a bit to the imagination.

I will just keep at it and post some more charts until I can get it down.  Chat with you again sometime soon.

-Sid

--- 帖子 #846 ---
Hi guys here is another update

--- 帖子 #847 ---
Good observation and great advice goldfish, spot on the area was good i think he needed the limit order needed to be lower just like goldfish has mentioned other wise good spotting,

cashforex

--- 帖子 #848 ---
Hey cashforex, do you think that the target (Take profit) should be put around that area?

--- 帖子 #849 ---
When hunting out levels it helps to take a look across various timeframes (in this case M30) to see whether or not one has identified a "level within a level", which is an important Sam Seiden odds enhancer.  This also helps reduce noise and tighten up the limit order.

--- 帖子 #850 ---
Hi Vital,

I normally look to the left where the rally tend to stop that's where i normally put my take profit,

lot of the time when im happy with the profit i will close part of the trade and let the rest of the trade run and move my S/l in the positive then you already have taken partial of the profit and rest of your trade is free, you can let it run close the whole trade use your discretion

it missed my entry point by couple of pips so i didn't get on this one,

if you look at this trade its already in profit of 55pips on the daily chart

best of luck

--- 帖子 #851 ---
EJ demand zone. Lying on the 97-99 weekly pivot. Bought half position @ 97.77. Limit order for lower level 97.3 for remaining half position. I think it'll go lower before it bounces back up. First target, just under 100.

Not much confluence otherwise so relatively higher risk trade. But hey whats the fun in forex if you dont sometimes play on a hunch.

Best,

-H

--- 帖子 #852 ---
Goldfish,

In any other market these would be great levels but with the Euro at present any longs are dangerous.

If these levels hold for a decent bounce the laws of supply and demand will have well and truly proven themselves.

--- 帖子 #853 ---
I agree. Buying the euro is not a prudent choice at the moment. But im foreseeing a correction reversal if not now then slightly lower around the 97 level.

Given that the BOJ is getting worried about the yen getting stronger and if it keeps going this way they are surely to intervene.

In the bigger picture the downward momentum has decreased slightly but not much at all.

Best,

-H

--- 帖子 #854 ---
Seriously need to find more time to trade, missing so many setups. only took 2 trades this week, up 56 pips in total.hungry for more setups. Right now only trading 1h 4h and daily. really enjoy the less noise.

--- 帖子 #855 ---
Thanks cash and simon for the help and encouragement.  Here are a couple of other spots on the AUD/JPY chart I am looking at.  Mostly I am just trying to pick my levels.  Please advise.  I have 3 different TF's and notes for what I am looking at and thinking.

I do not really see much confluence with these areas.  I really am just trying to pick a zone with the right width.  I am not sure I would take these as trades, but I wanted to post some practice charts to get a better opinion.

Thanks,

-Sid

--- 帖子 #856 ---
Hey only20gp!  Nice zone.  could you explain a little bit why you took that zone?  Were you mostly taking that as a zone, because of how quickly it left the area?  Also if I look left of your zone that area seems really washed out to me.  With supply and demand do we not care to much if an area is washed out like that?  And lastly would you mark a second demand zone just below that area or do you not consider that a demand zone?  Just trying to wrap my head around the idea.  I would have missed this zone as an option.  And like you say I am hungry for more setups.

Also how many pairs do you normally watch?

Thanks,

-Sid

--- 帖子 #857 ---

--- 帖子 #859 ---
Thanks Simond2002 for the help. I will keep this in mind.

-Sid

--- 帖子 #860 ---
Does anyone can see the same picture?

--- 帖子 #861 ---
Simond, what are your thoughts on deciding the trades purely on what the rating from the odds enhancers, RR is one part, leaving the zone another but you also have, big picture, time at zone and how it arrives back as Dean says the "magnet effect"?

Keeping it a simple scoring system may help reduce the amount of estimation on if it's a zone or not

--- 帖子 #862 ---
Yes I agree, and for me it is SDZ/RR/Departure/Arrival/Big picture.  No more, no less

For many reasons I've found the one that causes the most headache when scoring out a trade is the Supply/Demand Zone (SDZ).  For example, we may understandably not want to trade a pivot on a H1 chart, however, it's not unreasonable to be on the lookout inside any D1 pivots to see whether or not there is a decent SDZ that conforms to our system.  A robust set of trading rules helps eliminate the doubts on this one.

Also, I've gotten into the practice of first manually identifying the SDZ and then adding the indicator later just to see whether or not the two agree.  If you notice, the indicator seems to have missed a quite nice looking Supply Zone on the original AUDJPY H1 chart around 77.80/77.90.

--- 帖子 #863 ---
Hey Simond2002,

What indicator are you talking about?  I did not use an indicator in this chart.  These were all manually chosen.  I missed that zone as I did not know to look for it.  Purple is just the color I choose to use, because blue conflicted with my candle colors.  I am from Florida and I am a Florida gator fan hence my orange and blue candles.  LOL!

Also if you do not mind what are the rules for SDZ like the one I missed? Does the little rally help support a strong level? etc.?  And what about the level below it that seems to be similar.  It has a small rally then a pretty strong drop.  Can you explain the differences? Is it because it is more of a "V" shape (upside down) and would be considered more of a swing?

Does the indicator really help in choosing good levels?  Should I use it to start with, or should I keep choosing them manually and then like you do apply it and see if I am right?  How much value do you actually give the indicator?

Thanks....Oh and Happy Friday everyone!

-Sid

--- 帖子 #864 ---
Got stopped out here. My entry was too hasty but the market still retraced after the bottom at 95.5 for a good 150 pips.

-H

--- 帖子 #865 ---
Apologies Sid - I'd tested SupDem.exe (i think this is the name of the file) and noticed that it drew out lots of zones in a similar style and colour to the ones that you had marked out.  During testing I also noticed that the indicator seemed to omit various zones (that by my rules would merit consideration), which is why I had supposed that you had applied it.

Anyhow, congrats to you if you're picking out the zones by hand .  I always choose my zones manually.  The only indicator I routinely use is a Bollinger Band but again I have strict rules on how I apply it.  Incidentally, these rules are really only a working version of what Sam Seiden (who I consider my mentor) teaches.

Re your question about the levels I have attached a very basic graphic.

Re your point about the small rally and then pretty strong drop look again at the chart but this time step up the timeframe to an H1.  What you should now see is a drop down into the zone followed by 5 candles of basing followed by a strong drop out of the zone.  It is a Drop Base Drop (DBD) and demonstrates the importance of multi-time frame analysis.   As always though, pulling the trigger and entering a live trade remains the sole responsibility of the indiviudal trader

Have a great weekend - we've got the Queen's Jubilee to prepare for here!

--- 帖子 #866 ---
Okay so heres Gold, ,made awesome pips with this today. As we can see the market rallied like mad on bad US NFP (every number really). UK is already down and Yen is most likely at its peak before which BOJ wont let it go any higher. This gives gold and silver an opportunity to be safe havens.

Big move up, very likely to retrace to fill up all the left out orders lying there. The key is to identifying where. 61.8 is an obvious point sitting on a decent pivot but the market might not return to it. My strategy is to start filling up my total 1.5% risk in 3 parts first at 23.6 (1600), 50 (1571) and last at 61.8 (1560)

All and any inputs are welcome.

Best,

-H

--- 帖子 #867 ---
Thanks for the graph and the info.

How do you guys handle when price spikes through a SDZ when it is driven by a news event? Do you still consider it a retest of the zone and therefore count it towards removing orders from a particular area?  I could understand why you would still consider it a true retest seeing how most levels have some sort of limit orders at these zones.  My question is do people remove their orders if it is just before a major news event and then when price recovers back to normal, they replace their orders?  Or do they just leave them?  My personal rules for trading tells me to not take a trade 30min. before or after a major news release.

In this case if I had a limit order at the supply zone I would have been stopped out fairly quickly.

I have added a chart.

--- 帖子 #868 ---
Sid, I got in caught in between trading and writing this afternoon and forgot to add this image.  The DBD should hopefully disambiguate what we we were talking about and illustrate the AUDJPY zone in question and how it appears different over two timeframes - DBD on the H1 and the smaller area RBD on the M30.

As always though, pulling the trigger and entering a live trade remains the sole responsibility of the indiviudal trader

I started using the indi for a while, but because I am a newbie have decided to do it all by sight, if they don't hold, figure it out, I have found I am able to figure out the reasons why zones I pick don't work out and it really boils down to HTF at the moment.

nevermind!  I guess it was not a very good level.  Either that or the ecb press conference had something to do with it.  I did not take the trade because of the conference.  On to the next seat!

I have another chart for everyone.  Can you please comment?

Thanks,

-Sid

--- 帖子 #886 ---
this is a much better area in my opinon, but one thing to consider is how much time did price spend at the level, the least the better. Now it seems price spent alot of time in that area. The previous post, is just that i like it when the level alligns in a perfect rectangle, on the previous chart, the 2 first candles did not allign. Dont know if you know what I mean.

Here is the setup I was eyeing earlier, see how price shot up from that level? it shot up 30 pips before it started to retrace. I have closed half out at 30 pips, and places a TP just before the 1HR supply zone. Gona let this one ride.

--- 帖子 #887 ---
no patience today, trade closed....

Personally I don't like this EJ picture. No sharp drop from the zone.

I noticed the zone but then rejected it. Now observing USDJPY pair

--- 帖子 #890 ---
Thanks only20!  That does makes sense.  Thanks for the explanation.

I did take the eur/aud you talked about in a earlier post.  I closed out for a total of 48 pips.  Nice level and thanks for the heads up.

I also had the eur/jpy level marked and I am waiting on a seat on that bus.  I did have it picked as you had it drawn.  So it is nice to get confirmation that I am starting to look at it the right way.

Yep, that's it. But to aware you I'm just mastering my skill so please think twice before taking the trade...

--- 帖子 #894 ---
thanks Phi1ipp!  I understand.  We are all in this together.  Just nice to know I am in the ball park.

-Sid

--- 帖子 #895 ---
thats a perfect level, id place half my position at the start of the 4H supply and drop down to the 1H and place my other half there too. ususaly its above the 4H supply.

as for the AUDUSD trade from 2 hours back, philip you were right, so I scalped a quick 20 pips from it and closed it.

--- 帖子 #896 ---
Thanks only20!

I have added a 1hr chart of the eur/usd.  I marked a white line where I think you are talking about taking my second have.  Can you verify my line?

So I placed half my order at the start of the purple area (4hr. supply) and 2nd half at the white line (1hr. supply).  Stops 2 pips outside the 4hr. supply.

Hello everyone!

Nice trade Phi1ipp!  I had that one marked but was asleep when it hit.  I am working on getting more comfortable with POs.

I did take this trade this morning.  It looks like it might take me out.  Can someone take a look at my levels and tell me if I went wrong or if it is just one of those trades that did not work out?

--- 帖子 #905 ---
I'm now trying to keep myself away from CT trades. So, I won't take it for this reason.

Beside that there's no equilibrium zone at the level you've chosen. For me it isn't a proper S-zone.

--- 帖子 #906 ---
Thanks for the advice.  So mainly the biggest problem was it was a counter trend trade?

--- 帖子 #907 ---
I guess the biggest is not a proper zone. And after that - CT trade. But I'd like to mention I'm still practicing.

--- 帖子 #908 ---
Thanks Phi1ipp,

I understand we are all learning this together.  You do seem to make good calls and it seems like I am more of a newbie than yourself.  So I appreciate the input.

The main thing I was curious about is if it was a good zone or not.  I have been taking a lot smaller positions as I am learning this method.  Would you mine explaining why the zone was not very good?  Here is my thinking.  Maybe I am seeing more in it than I should.

I saw it as a drop-base-drop and price left the area pretty strongly (with a gap).  Plus on the lower TF it had a nice base it formed with some structure.  It also moved more than 3:1.

Please feel free to tell me where my flaws in thinking are.  Any advice will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

-Sid

--- 帖子 #909 ---
As for me the zone doesn't have up and down bars which show that there was a battle between bears and bulls. It all happened late on Friday on thin market when all the market-maykers had finished their week. That's why I'm very sceptic that there could be a strong supply. That's proven by the thing that I don't see a rally out of the zone. Just a decline. After that there was a gap but that's because of a new trading week started.

And that again just my thoughts

--- 帖子 #910 ---
great explanation!  That makes sense to me.  Thank you for your input.  I will keep that in mind for future trades.

-Sid

--- 帖子 #911 ---
The supply area you choose was quite good in my opinion, but take a look at that demand just below it. its too close to one another. hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #912 ---
an area i am watching, if no supply is created just above it, this should be a good trade. A 1H and 4H view.

--- 帖子 #913 ---
I saw that area and worried that I would not get much out of it.  I was planning on taking a larger position out if it made it there.  Thanks for the input.  I will definitely keep that in mind for the future.

What is a safe distance away from areas like this?  Or is it pretty much relative to your time frame?  I know this is a hard question to answer.

--- 帖子 #914 ---
Only20gp,

I notice you use bollinger bands on your charts.  I also noticed that it seems like the SDZs tend to land near the top and bottom bollinger band.  Would you mind chatting about how to use the BB with S&D?  It looks like it could probably help if I understood it better.  Also do you use the stock settings for the BB or are they custom settings?

Thanks,

-Sid

--- 帖子 #915 ---
depends on every trader, for me, at least 4 or more what i am risking.

meaning if i am risking 20 pips, there should be at least 60 pips of clear path for price to travel.

--- 帖子 #916 ---
Mine is period 50 shift 2. i dont think its stock, think i got those settings from rocky`s thread. better chances if it hit your zone while its outside the BB.

placed 2 long orders on 30 min got stopped out twice.Based on 4hr chart could i have taken a different approach to the 30 min trade or was this just bad luck and execution was ok?If anyone wants to take a crack at this...Thanks

--- 帖子 #934 ---
Hi Bodine,

Always easy to trade the lefthand side of the chart

but...

Based on the two timeframes that you've posted it is

the H4 that presents the classic pattern of Rally-Base-Rally

demand.  The biggest give away with the M30 pattern between

70 and 80 for me is the long wick.  I would never trade a

pattern like that because it looks more like a pullback

into a lower demand level.  A small Rally-Base-Drop supply

level also formed just above entry, killing the risk/reward.

But in the context of the prior points, this point becomes

academic

The H4 level that you've identified looks pretty good to me

but the risk/reward is only 1:2.  I do take trades like this

but will use a "confirmation" entry.  I will allow price to

first enter around 30 percent of the level and then place a

STOP Order (to buy in this case) and wait to be filled if,

as and when price leaves the level.  As soon as I see circa

10 - 15 pips I immediately move my stop to breakeven.

Personally I don't use anything less than an H1 chart when

hunting out supply and demand as per the attached image...

Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #935 ---
Thanks!going to try some of the things you talk about those half hour levels don't seem to hold very well ..about the long wick placed the orders before hand had to step out but i am on SIM and pretty far away from going live.

--- 帖子 #936 ---
Simond how do you manage your trade once you move to break even? Do you wait till it moves another 10 to 15 then move stop another 10 to 15 and so on? Also do you use TF below H1 if so for what purpose.Thanks

--- 帖子 #937 ---
Depends on the timeframe and profit target but generally speaking,

trading long for example off of a H4 timeframe, I move

the stop to breakeven after 10 - 15 pips and then basically wait

for a new demand level to form in the H1 timeframe at which point

I move the stop to just below that.

It's a case of continuing to do the same until one of two things happens:

either I'm stopped out or price reaches the first opposing H4 supply

level at which point I close the trade.

--- 帖子 #938 ---
do you always let price dip 30% into a level for entry or only when the R/R is not the greatest

--- 帖子 #939 ---
wish I could answer that one conclusively but i'm afraid i can't because

market conditions vary so much from trade to trade...

I'm currently long the AU and took a buy limit at 40 off of the top of the H4 level.

If you check out the H1 inside the H4 maybe i could have done better by allowing price to first come down to that reversal level at 33 and then entering the market with a stop order...

--- 帖子 #940 ---
Do you trust charts for entry under H1 to minimize risk ?

--- 帖子 #941 ---
Pretty much, yes.

Stopped out at +1 on my AU long trade...

--- 帖子 #942 ---
I'm looking to try grab a few pips if this M15 level hits...

--- 帖子 #943 ---
I see! hope that works out for you.........never traded forex only futures

--- 帖子 #944 ---
so you don't go lower than H1 to find your levels,but you find the best entrys on lower frame to minimize risk?

--- 帖子 #945 ---
Basically yes.  But I'm still trying to perfect my system.

Working from MN chart down to H1 chart for SD patterns and then drill down in the lower time frames for an entry with about 15 pips risk.  I do this because the risk factor on a D1 can be 40 pips or more, which is just too much for me.

There definitely are times when I'd look to work solely in the M15 for example but only under very specific circumstances.

For instance, the previous AU M15 level forms a confluence with a 76.4 fib retrace if one draws a fib from yesterday's swing low at 1.0007 and today's high around 1.0058.

If I take this trade I'll limit my expectations because it comes off of a D1 pivot low.  I'll also be looking for added confirmation on the entry by way of price piercing the lower Bollinger band.  I'm no expert, however, just someone trying to fathom his way through the method

Hi Vitall,

It looks ok but in my opinion if you look to the left that point already have been visted previously and there is not enough price imblance, so you could take this trade but its a bit risky it could work out, check the below set up this what you should look for in your next set up, hope this helps

Hi Vitall,

good spoting, try to look for 3:1 return on risk to reward, to get the odds in your favour, meaning in the above if you have look at your supply area your stoploss should be at 25pips and your take profit 40pips next time try to spot with 3:1 if your stop loss is set at 20 pips from the price, your profit target should be around 60 pips

The market is crazy last days... Any fresh ideas, guys?

--- 帖子 #954 ---
HI guys anyone here know where I can find this EA that the trailing will start from TP toward the current price what i mean is supposed I buy Eurusd 1.3200 My TP is 1.3250 and my trailing TP is 5 pips , lets say the price went against me it goes down to 1.3195 i want the EA

to move the TP 1.3250 to 1.3200 , when the price goes down again lets say 1.3190 I want the EA again to move the Tp 1.3200 to 1.3195

EA BUY EURUSD @

thisprice 1.3200 .-----> PRICE 1.3200 -----> TP 1.3250 SL1.3100 (SL remain the same)

this price 1.3200 ----->PRICE 1.3195 ----->TP 1.3200 SL1.3100 (SL remain the same)

this price 1.3200 -----> PRICE 1.3190 ----->TP 1.3195 SL1.3100 (SL remain the same)

Note : (TP change when price change)

i i hope you guys got my idea , thnx

Never heard about EA like that... You can check www.mql4.com - they have a lot of scripts out there. Probably one of them is going to work for your strategy.

Today short term M15 EU supply level is currently the only thing I'm watching but with H1 pivots to the left I'm definitely going to take care if an entry setup forms, and look to be aggressive on T/P.

EA is hitting an interesting D1 Pivot Zone - MN timeframe looks ever more interesting (levels inside levels) though I'll probably er on the side of caution and wait for at least some H1 levels to form inside...

--- 帖子 #957 ---
Simond,

That supply level is a reaction to previous supply. I would thread carefully here. We are coming from a 1st time touch at a demand level dating back to 29th June and could send us back up for a while...

I would look to 1.2620/30 area for PA to think about a short. Even there could be early as its not my preferred type of supply level... Might be worth a scalp!

--- 帖子 #958 ---
Cheers for the "heads up" Rsher101.  I'm currently at breakeven having seen +7 on the trade.  I definitely agree with your points - my rational for taking the trade (with my "scalper's head" on ) was the R:R of the resultant move off of the level you referenced - it was 1:4, am therefore looking for 1:3.

Risk free now so we'll see...

--- 帖子 #959 ---
That is a beautiful piece of demand from Friday. Hopefully have enough buyers to get me to my initial target. Longer term i dont know how the Euro is going to stay at these levels. Really shows the power of supply and demand how we are not sub 1.20 at present..

--- 帖子 #961 ---
I trade futures and i only trade 1 contract or lot,so i'm not sure if i should let trade run from supply to demand and vice versa or just close out half way or use some sort of trailing stop ratio

--- 帖子 #962 ---
Rsher01, did you have a buy order at the 51/63 level?

--- 帖子 #963 ---
Bodine,

I agree, +7 is quite tight!  I think for me it depends on the initial risk.  The EU M15 scalp (stopped out breakeven by the way) was filled at 86 with stop at 92.  I was trying to short on a continuation of the downward wedge, and those trades - when they work - tend to move quite quickly I've found.

--- 帖子 #964 ---
Simond,

Had a buy order at 1.2559 with a 10pip SL. Nearly caught it to the pip. I have been watching that level since early yesterday morning and honestly my patience nearly ran out.

I find that happens me alot. I ID a great area and there is so much noise above this area that my patience ran out. made a point of it to wait this one out. If you look at the big jump up last Friday there was alot of what looks like compression up to liquidity before the major move and the base of this is normally where the smart orders are. Might take us a while but i reckon we will see 1.2620 before we see my BE.

Bodine,

If you can identify the exact point where the decision is made then you should feel more comfortable moving to BE. There is normally only a touch on this levels. Otherwise you will have to deal with a lot of noise and emotion before you see your trade close.

--- 帖子 #965 ---
Looking at this swap zone. No patience to wait and PA is stalling so gonna take the money off the table. +47 pips not bad for nearly 48 hours wait ..

If i was further along in my development id hope to leave half open but not trading with massive money so would like to feel rewarded for my patience.

Rsher01,

I know exactly what you mean about the boredom setting in.  I've started to use alertfx.com with an email address tied to my Blackberry, which frees me from the computer.  Having said that though - there's only so much gardening one can do!

Hats off for pulling that level.  I must admit, I took a look on the H1 and wasn't too keen because of the long pivots and the fact that over the past couple of days supply seemed to have exhausted the original bull move - in the H1 at least.  And even on the M5 the move out of the fresh level around your entry point didn't seem that powerful.  It just goes to show what I know!

--- 帖子 #967 ---
Dunno what it was about that level I just thought it was a great one.

It was a drop base rise level and price went 20 pips up in one 5min bar. The reason why i liked it so much was because it hadnt been revisited and was at the bottom of zone which sent price up a further 120 or so pips.

Then if you look at what price did to get to that level it gave me an insight in the potential to the upside.

Price created 4 or 5 supply zones since last Friday with each one of them being revisited and IMO consumed. Therefore the potential to the upside was to reach 1.2620 which i see it just has (typical with me still looking at the screen).

--- 帖子 #968 ---
For a cheeky scalp there is some nice supply here at 1.2624-1.2635. You may get a cheeky scalp down to at least the 1.2610 area. Anything above 35 though negates this theory.

--- 帖子 #969 ---
The consumption thing is interesting but just checking back over my charts I see your point.

Out of interest did you arrive at the SD trading method straight away or was this something that you discovered sometime after starting?

--- 帖子 #970 ---
Simond,

God no. I arrived at the "get rich quick scheme" advised to me by a collegeague at first. This is what initially got my attention. I then moved on to "gambling stage" as per say by picking a direction or by trading news releases. 1 day I made 300 pips off of a news realease I was sure I had made it. Can you guess how long it took for me to give it all back and the rest?? I am blessed that I hadnt much money to play with at the time and alot of my time was spent trading micro lots and using demo platforms.

I then moved onto indictors (stochastics/MAs/divergence etc etc) and from here I tried the trend following strategies. With trend following strategies I just thought the risk was too much and markets started to get too choppy. I think they can work along with SD trading just havent honed in on this yet.

I must have spent months backtesting strategies and making up my own ,some of which were profitable but risk reward were all off. I intend to return to these strategies and fine tune them some day along with my SD teachings for a greater R:R.

I was blessed to come across the PIE thread one day by accident and my trading has been steadily improving ever since. Every day you look back on a days Price Action and 90% is explained on the chart. When you see a massive turn on a chart and follow it back to the left you can always tell it occured at a price where a decision has been made previously.

There are some great traders on here that I have followed and continue to follow whose anaylsis opens your eyes to what exactly is happening on a price chart.

I am by no manner or means the finished article infact I am just starting out on the PA/SD road but I know one thing for sure it is miles ahead of any EA, indicator, strategy you can find out there.

My feelings are you get nothing for free in this world. There is no such thing as easy money if there was everyone would be doing it. But if you are willing to spend the hours in front of a screen and have the basics right and continue to fine tune them you will succeed in this game (at least i hope so).

For instance I risked 10 pips on that trade. If I had of got stopped out it wouldnt have cost me a thought as it was a small risk for a large reward. If i got 1 in 5 of these right I would still be profitable.

Just see i picked up another 14 pips there. Today has been a good day!

--- 帖子 #980 ---
Hey Rsherl01,

Cheers for sharing this.  I'm kind of taking a similar path

myself and have to say that I feel blessed to have "discovered"

Supply/Demand trading while still reasonably early on in

my trading career.

I started out trading a range bar system whose designers

advocate a momentum crossover method.  The theory seemed pretty

straightforward but I just couldn't trade it profitably and

it was only once I had discovered Sam Seiden's teachings and

really focussed hard on what he was saying that I begun to

understand why this was.

I'm certainly no expert but I have to say the SD method turned

things around pretty quickly - even if this is just on the

psychological level whilst still trading demo.  I'm currently

working on trying to disseminate the levels and choose the best ones,

and feel sure that this is the most challenging bit.

One thing I'm struggling with is deciding which timeframe to trade in.

I'd prefer to stick to D1/H4 but the risk is often just too much

for me.

--- 帖子 #981 ---
Simond,

WIth regards TFs i think sticking to the bigger ones while demo trading the LTFs is best option at present. Personally I look to the bigger ones then zoom in to refine my entries. Sometimes you can tell to the exact pip. Gives you a great Risk Reward ratio and the option to let some ride on the trade.

You should look at the homework given out by a trade called Ifmyante in the Price is Everything Chatroom in the members forum. Some of the homework involves picking the best levels, compression and QM (quasimodo) setups which occur frequently are are great indicators of a reversal. I have been trying to spot these live now for weeks and hopefully they are coming to me easier lately. Some great trades can be got at the start of these with low risk.

You should also follow the Dollar Index when trading a Dollar pair. If the Dollar is in Supply/Demand which matches up with Demand/Supply on the Eur/Usd you also have a high probability of your trade being succesful.

--- 帖子 #982 ---
Hi Simond02

First I like to thankyou  for your feedback I try my best to help my fellow traders to succeed,

To Answer your question, I try not to focus on how many pips im going to use for my S/L whether its 20pips 30 or 40, what I focus on is what is my risk to reward ratio is going to be for example if see an potential set up and my stop loss is at 40pips ill make sure that my target is going to be 120pips

hope this helps

Hi Simond

If you going to trade S/D then to get the best results its best to trade the longer time frames, if you feel the risk is to high for you then try to look for an good supply or demand level on the daily time frame then drop to the 4HR and then drop to 1HR to find your entry should be manageable

hope this helps

Hi Vitall,

Looks good.  I've placed a couple of "in case" retrace levels that I'm looking at too.  The blue shaded box is a H4 and if we

get there would be a 38.2 retrace of this week's move down.

The level in the green lines is H1 and if we see a spike up there sometime during today's LDN/NY I may look at shorting.

Hey guys,

I'm shocked this morning to read reports in the news about Russ Wassendorf Sr., the CEO of PFGBest, which is the USA based broker that I've been demo trading with for nearly one year.

Wassendorf has attempted suicide just after his company's accounts (and of course those of his customers') have been frozen pending a serious investigation regarding the misrepresentation of client funds.  As the story develops I believe PFGBest have filed for liquidation.

What is more shocking to me is that a PFGBest company rep telephoned me just a few days ago and we spoke for a while about my readiness to deposit funds and go live!

Up until today I had fully intended to use PFGBest as my broker because their spreads were so competitive.  Obviously things have now changed.  I have tried OANDA but I have to say that circa 10-20pips spread on the EU during LDN high volatility is crazy.  Alpari seems ok but one can never tell.

Out of interest, which brokers do you guys use?  Any that you guys are really happy with?  Any that you're not?  I'm based in London and will need to consider a UK based outfit.  At least if things go down the pan one can go knock on the door!

I was not using the Fratelli system other than fun and research, i always made it clear that my main account is supply and demand, and i only did the fratelli test as a thing on the side because i had so much spare time, as always it was a system that was too mechanical and of course failed along with udines system.

Thank for your taking you time out and putting up those webinar recordings for us. They are very useful for a latecomers like myself.

I read your posts watch hours of your webinars along with other supply and demand material. I'm still not profitable even though I follow yours and Sam Seiden's trading rules, something is still missing.

I was wondering if you're planning on holding any webinars in the future or getting this thread active again.

Btw, are you still trading the same method that was introduced in the webinars long time ago?

Many thanks,

DeanKenny21,

I just started watching your recorded videos, and I really enjoyed them, however I have a question about Risk Reward.  In alot of these trades it looks like you have an upside down risk/reward, for example in one of the trades you are risking approx. 12-14 pips, but then you're taking a quick profit at 5 pips.

To be profitable with this type of risk reward it seems like your hit rate would have to be above 90% in order for the math to work out profitably.

Am I understanding this correctly?

I do like your style of using fibs and supply and demand together, but it seems like it would be very difficult to sustain such a high hit rate and not go into the red because you'll lose at least 2 profitable (+5 pip) trades every time you are wrong.

Just hoping you can address this, and how you resolved to keep yourself out of trouble.  And I'm curious how your account has grown since you posted your videos, and if everything worked out as you planned.

Thanks.

Hey guys, how are well all these days, hope everyone is doing well in the supply and demand world.

I just wanted to hit you guys up with a website/link that during my career on forex I stumbled upon and completely changed my perception of how supply and demand works and why. Now I am not putting Sam Seiden down here, what he teaches is correct, but the reasons why are not, and although as you guys know from my many trading livestreams I was very profitable in supply and demand, this article and many others from this site really changed the game for me.

I'd say I went from around 65-70% accuracy to 80-85% after reading the articles, bearing in mine my trades are mostly 1risk 2reward and more, well you can do the maths

Anyway here is the link.

Please note following my post above if you read it, you should now understand bank orders in the market, here I have marked a pretty sure bank intraday supply level. MY red ticks are retail traders stop losses for sells, above the highs as retail traders are taught

Banks orders are so large that liquidity is never readily available at current levels, so they need liquidity, so they search for it, liquidity hunt, or more famously known as a stop hunt retail traders are taught

Anyway we see just after lunch in UK and as NY is opening, a strong push up here in cable, taking out many many stop losses (red check marks) of retail traders, these stop losses act as a buy order opening once hit, this helps the banks fill their large sell orders, as they needs buyers to sell, simple concept.

The push down out this zone, created a rally-base-drop an absolute classic in the SAD world. I spotted this while eating my cheese sandwich and my eyes instantly knew a bank was at play, now why does price return so quickly, because banks did not fill enough sell orders to be happy, so price rises again, attracting more buyers they can sell to and eventually fill their remaning sell, and as you can see my sell also

I knew this would be high profitability because against Sams teachings price came back very quickly, banks do not like to hold orders overnight (intraday level) so they will want them filled TODAY!! If you read the article I posted you will see why longer time spent away from a zone weakens a level.

Hope anyone in the SAD can get something out of this, and look to further spot possible bank intraday orders to share with us. The main points we are looking for is break above recent highs or lows (banks searching for stops) base and drop or rise (as banks take otherside of the orders) and mainly during LOndon open and through to NY which obviously makes it more obvious an institution is at play

Hello Dean, I watched Sam Seiden's S&D videos but have very lil success for the past weeks and then I came across your threat and got hooked immediately! I have read all your threads from page one till end hoping to pick up some skills from you but sadly all the images that you uploaded on imageshack are no longer available and the meeting recording links you put up on page 1 are not working it seems. Feeling really lost now and really hope someone can provide some pointers in this thread {fingers-crossed}.

Btw, Happy Friday everyone!

Hi Esther, yes unforutnately due to the age of the thread now, seems all the pictures and live streams have expired, which is a real shame because the livestreams were great and people have literally watched my livestreams and gone off by themselves afterwards to trade profitably, whether it's using my normal supply and demand trading or my more popular 5min scalping using supply and demand with fibs.

Hopefully when the market opens again we can start to get something going again.

For example this week had a beautiful setup on cable, as USD gained momentum buyers. Price broke the last swing low indicated by upper blue line, once broke I can confirm now a downtrend, so I set an order at this supply level, and aimed for the next lows of the swing that was broken indicated by the lower blue line, which ended up being a perfect tp areas as demand started to appear here.

Thanks for your reply Dean! Yeah, such a shame that I have no access to all your hard effort you posted earlier  Anyway, thank you for your kind and selfless contribution and I look forward to learning more from you.

Have a great week ahead!

Here was one of my other picks that I shown a couple friends a nice supply setup in this downtrend, RR of 3.85, drawdown was non-existant as unfilled orders were obviously in drones here. Target was lower demand, and as you can see my target which I saw as demand also would've acted as an excellent trade for the way up too  but these days i'm not too greedy.

Full Take profit has been reached, another trade done, I hope some people took this trade, I marked the area out way before price reached it, and as you can see the tp area marked by the upper thin green line which was the supply area this area reacted perfectly and also could have been a trade, unfortunately I was asleep.

Absolutely fantastic. With the article I posted not long ago, Sam Seiden says time spent away from zone, longer the better, but that does not make sense, since reading the articles I posted my trading has improved tenfold. Orders to sell, orders were not all filled price comes straight back to supply so that the big boys can fill the rest of thier short orders.

Hi, I read that site you referenced and it's pretty cool, answered some questions, that had been bugging me about SD compared to observed behaviour of the market. I was just wondering if you still are using the fibo combined with this strategy and if so could you post an image, because as one poster said the images have disappeared. That would be awesome.. I've spent quite a bit of time with SD but with refreshed view I am keen to have another crack.

cheers, I appreciate the work you have put into this thread.

Now we all know it's great while markets are trending, but markets range alot more than they trend. Knowing WHT markets are ranging is alot better than just saying "this market is in range" knowing the facts behind why it's happening is priceless information.

Take the AUDCAD daily chart here I have posted, we have been in a range since around 16th August. Spotting supply and demand can allow you to see the range diameters and why this is happening. As you can see supply level was created just as market went into range, and reacted off a demand area down below, both these supply and demand areas are still contaning orders, and is why price is stuck within these 2 areas, which will break first, who knows, but we can be pretty sure where price is going to react or where a profit area is in a range market. Take price action traders for example, we see a lovely pinbar here on the daily chart, so I would think many people are shorting this pinbar into next week, but what about TP areas, knowing supply and demand we can see a perfectly excellent area to look for price reactions in the demand area down below.

Hi Minute and welcome, yes I always apply fibs to look for confluence, I do not base a trade purely off fib, but if I see a confluence, this always adds confidence to a trade. Take the AUDCAD I just posted for example applying a fib, we can see the first time price entered into supply it also bounced off the 38.2, next it entered and bounced straight off the 50 fib, this pinbar also looks like it's bouncing from the 38.2 again, so in short, yes I definately still use fibs every time I mark out a zone

Time Spent Away From Zone

One of the primary rules supply and demand traders use to gauge whether a zone has a high probability of working out successfully is the amount of time the market has spent away from zone.Apparently, according to many supply and demand teachers, the longer the market has been away from a supply or demand zone the better chance the market has of turning when it eventually returns.This again is flawed thinking.If the bank places a pending order to buy or sell for when the market returns to a supply or demand zone are they really going to wait a long time for this to happen ?
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

If we compare the old supply and demand zones (colored blue), with the more recent zones colored orange, its easy to see how trading zones which have been created recently is far more profitable than trading zones which were created a long time ago.Lets Imagine you had traded the 6 recent zones Ive marked on the chart, each zone would have resulted in you having a successful trade, however had you traded the older zones, only one of them wouldve turned out to be a profitable trade.So really the example above proves to us the quicker the market returns to a supply or demand zone the better the chance it has of giving you a successful trade, older zone do not tend to work out very often, therefore its better if you only place trades in zone which have been created recently.

--- 帖子 #1069 ---
The Strength Of The Move Away

One of the fundamental rules to trading supply and demand is The stronger the move away from a zone the higher the chance the market has of having a strong move away when it eventually returnsIn other words, if you mark a zone on your charts which has a strong move away from it, how likely that zone is to result in you having a successful trade depends on how big the move which created the zone was.If you marked a supply zone which had a huge drop consisting of multiple bearish large range candles then according to the rules the zone has a really high chance of working out successfully if you decide to trade it.Unfortunately the likelihood of a supply or demand zone giving you a successful trade has nothing to do with whether the move out of the zone was strong or not.How many times have you placed a trade at a supply or demand zone which has a strong move away only to see the market fly straight through it when it returns ?A large number of times I bet.This is because the strength of the move away has nothing to do with how strong the area is.

Common supply and demand teachings would say this is a strong area, yet as you can see the market breaches it without even stopping ! Which brings me on to my next point.

How To Determine Which Zones Are Stronger Than Others

Now we know a big move away from a supply and demand zone doesnt have any effect on the likelihood of a trade working out profitably or not we need to answer the question how do you determine which zones are stronger than others?

The answer is where is the zone in relation to the trend.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Check out this demand zone on the daily chart of EUR/USDWhoever brought when the market was down here has a lot of money at their disposal.To know why requires an understanding of market psychology.As a trending movement increases in length, more and more people begin trading in the same direction. Look at the last drop you can see on the chart before the demand zone is created, at the time of this drop tens of thousands of traders are all beginning to go short expecting lower prices, in order for the market to be able to move up from here, someone needs to come into the market and buy from all the traders who are going short.This would take a huge amount of money, probably hundreds if not billions of dollars.The market eventually stops falling lower and begins advancing higher, creating the demand zone marked on the image. This zone has a very high probability of giving us a successful trade, not because it has a strong move away, but because we know whoever brought down here creating the zone has invested a lot of money into the market.Why would someone spend all that money buying up all the sell orders from thousands of traders if their still expecting the market to move lower ?Another example:
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

This example was taken from the 1 hour chart of EUR/USDApart from the change of time frame the example above is a very similar to what we looked at previously. First we have a significant downtrend which many people can easily see with one look at the chart, then we have a strong, near vertical move up. This move up tells us somebody has come into the market and brought up all the sell orders from the traders going short into the downtrend.Again why would someone come into the market and buy from all the traders going short if they were expecting the downtrend to continue ?The supply and demand zones which have the highest probability of working out successfully are the ones found at trend reversals. A demand zone created after the market has been going down for a long duration of time has a much better chance of working out profitably than a demand zone which forms at the beginning of a down-move.Its the same for supply zones too.In a situation where the market has been going up for a long time a supply zone which forms late into the lifespan of the move up has a far better chance of resulting in a successful trade than a zone which is created at the bottom of the move up.

Time Taken To Return To The Zone

There are two types of trading institutions participate in.The first is intra-day trading, in which the aim is to capture many small market movements over the course of the trading day generating small amounts of profits in the process.Bank traders who trade intra-day will want their trades placed during that day, none of them will hold their positions overnight, this means the market makers will have to work the price in the market to places where these intra-day traders will want to buy or sell.The majority of theses places will be supply and demand zones.So if we know these intra-day traders will not hold trades overnight then its likely that if the market doesnt return to these zones within a 24 hour time-frame they have a much lower probability of working out.Heres a rule for supply and demand traders who primarily trade the 1 hour chart.You should only trade zones which the market manages to return to in 24 hours.If the market has failed to return to a supply or demand zone you have marked on your charts within 24 hours then the zone becomes invalidated, you dont trade it again, it has no relevance anymore.Ive completed lots of test on this and found 24 hours is the max, anything over this and the probability of the zone decrease dramatically.If your someone who happens to trade supply and demand zones on the daily chart, then the market must return to the zone within a month, if it hasnt returned before the end of the month the level becomes invalidated and you must not attempt to trade it if the market returns.

The reason for this is due to the other type of trading banks participate in, long-term position trading.
These long-term positions the banks take is what causes trends to occur in the forex market.The large institutions who operate in the forex market all collaborate together in which direction their planning to take the market and then manipulate the prices so it makes everyone think the market is going to go in the opposite direction to the way in which they are going to be placing their trades.Here is an example I found on USD/JPY Attached Image (click to enlarge)
First notice how there is a significant downtrend which by this point had been in place for nearly three years, due to the fact the market has been going down for such a long time it means the majority of the traders in the market are going short.Then out of nowhere we get a sudden up move. This is significant because of how long this downtrend has been in place, many many people are selling USD/JPY due to this downtrend, for the market to suddenly move up means the banks have entered the market and brought huge positions off all the traders who have been selling.What the banks do then is very clever, they let the price drop, this makes everyone think the downtrend is going to continue so they all start selling again. When the market returns to where the banks initially brought, they buy again, this second round of buying coupled with the mass liquidation of losing positions by the traders who were selling is what causes the market break significantly higher and begin trending.When large institutions place trades in the market they will want all their trades to be entered at a relatively similar price range, they will not place one trade at one location and then wait until the market has moved far away from their first trade before placing the second one, this is why the market returns to the daily demand zone shown on the image.

Trend Direction

As with most forex trading strategies supply and demand traders incorporate the concept of trend into their analysis of the market.The problem is the way the traders implement the concept of trend.Typically what a trader will do is go on the daily chart and see that overall the trend is down, therefore they are only going to take trades at supply zones as they have been told to always trade in the direction of the daily trend.There is nothing wrong with this so long as the trader is taking trades off the daily chart.If the trader is taking trades off a lower time-frame then problems can arise as they are always going to be trading against the trend on the time-frame they take trades off.If for example the trader take trades off the 1 hour chart then they are unnecessarily going to lose on multiple trades because they believe they should be trading in the direction of the daily trend, regardless of whether the trend on the 1 hour chart is up.People don’t realize, the trend on the time frame you place all your trades off is the one you should be following. If you trade the daily chart then you should be trading in the direction of the daily trend, if you trade the 1 hour chart you should be trading in the direction of the 1 hour trend.

Why Do Some Supply And Demand Zones Work Multiple Times ?

Something which supply and demand traders will have undoubtedly noticed in their time trading the zones is the way the market will fail to break past some zones even after being touched multiple times. Supply and demand teaches say the reason this occurs is because the pending orders which are supposedly placed at the zone by the banks have not been depleted by the first or second touch into the zone.

Today I’ll show you the real reason why some supply and demand zones have a tendency to cause the market to reverse multiple times upon being touched and why the banks will never place pending orders at supply and demand zones when they want to enter the market.

The Reason Why Some Zones Don’t Break After Multiple Touches

If a the market is failing to break past a supply or demand zone it can mean one of two things:

The banks are using the zone to either place trades or take profits.

When the banks are placing trades they are rarely able to get their entire position placed all at once due to a lack of buy or sell orders being present in the market. So what they must do is after getting what trades they can placed using the orders available they have to make the price move up and down in order to generate enough orders to fill the rest of their positions.

When this process of generating orders is underway the banks will not want the market to move past the point where they have placed their first trade.

In other words, if a bank has placed a buy trade and is now making the price drop in an effort to drum up enough sell orders to get another buy trade placed, they will not want the price to fall below the price where they have entered their first buy trade as it could cause them to lose money.

To stop this from occurring the banks will get their second trade placed as close as possible to the price of their first buy trade. By doing this they stop the market from being able to drop below the location of their first trade whilst also knowing they’ll be able to make the same amount of profit from their second trade as they’ll make on the first trade.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Here’s an example I found of this process taking place.

First we had a supply zone form due to the banks placing sell trades. The buy orders which were in coming into the market at the time of the banks placing the sell trade was not enough to get all their whole sell position placed which means they must make the market move back up to get enough people to buy so they have enough orders to fill the rest of their sell positions.

When the price moves back up to the supply zone the banks place another sell trade using the buy orders coming into the market from the traders buying on the move into the zone. It would be at this point where supply and demand teaches would say its a bad idea to trade another move into the zone because all the sell orders which were said to be placed by the banks at the supply zone when it was created have been consumed from the previous movement.

Another drop take place because 0f the banks placing their second sell trade. They still haven’t be able to get all of their sell position placed which means they need to make the price rise again to create more buy orders. The price advances back into the supply zone, the banks place their final sell trades and the market completely reverses.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

You can see how each of the banks sell trades were placed at a very similar price. There is only a 33 pip difference between the price where they placed their first sell trade and the price at which they entered their second sell trade. When the main reversal gets underway each of these trades go into roughly the same amount of profit-making it easier for the banks to determine how many sell orders they might need to take profits off these sell positions.

--- 帖子 #1074 ---
Why The Banks Won’t Place Pending Orders At Supply And Demand Zones

In order for the banks to place close or take profits off trades they need the opposite kind of order coming into the market. If a bank wanted to place a buy trade they need other traders to be selling. The amount of orders coming into the market determines how much profit the bank is able to take off a trade or how big a trade they are able to place.

If the bank was to use a pending order to enter a buy trade placed ahead of time then it’s not possible for them to know if there will be enough sell orders coming into the market to get the pending order to buy placed.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

If the banks wanted to place a buy trade upon the market returning to the demand zone above they wouldn’t know the size of the buy trade they can place until the market had entered the zone. When it enters the zone the bank will look at the order book and see how many sell orders are currently coming into the market and then decide on the size of the buy trade they’re going to place.

When they’ve decide on the size of the trade they will use a market order to get the trade placed,

If they had placed a pending order to buy at the zone soon after it formed they wouldn’t have been able to determine the size of the buy trade because there’s no way for them to know how many sell orders will be coming into the market when the price drops back into the demand zone.

In the event of the banks pending buy order being too big what will happen upon the order being executed is part of the banks pending order will be filled using the sell orders that are coming into the market, then the price will move up because all the sell orders are gone and it will continue to move up until enough sell orders are found for the remainder of the banks pending buy order to placed.

This causes the banks to have lots of different buy trades placed at increasingly worse prices. Had they just used a market order to enter a buy trade when the price entered the demand zone this wouldn’t have occurred because they would have known exactly how many sell orders were coming into the market and could have placed a buy trade which they know for sure will be filled at one price.

--- 帖子 #1075 ---
Now taking the above into consideration vs Sam Seiden, here is an example of a "weak" demand zone, which we have been taught would be good, due to time spent away from zone, price has been away for too long from this area for any bank or big firm to still have orders sat there, price being away for this long I would definately NOT be trading a demand zone like this.

Same chart same timeframe, now notice price come back to this supply pretty quickly compared to the other chart I posted above, this zone as price is approaching would be of very high interest and I would be taking a short here every time, this is how I trade on a daily basis, 4hr charts and daily, across most major and minor pairs, there are many oppertunities like this on a daily basis providing extremely accurate areas to trade.

--- 帖子 #1077 ---
Now here is a trade I actually took, Supply formed, and I marked it on my chart, price came back pretty quickly, shortly after forming, placing a fib over too we see the 50 retracement falls near to the entry of the supply zone. Sometimes the accuracy scares me with how good it is, but if you know how supply and demand works and why these areas are more consistent it's not so scary, bank/large firms, sold here. They did not sell as much as they wanted to, price comes back up, attracting buyers into the market, these buyers are now what the big firm wants to sell into, rest of order is filled and price drops sharply.

Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1079 ---
Hi Mary Welcome, most strong zones will form London Morning time and London Lunch, which is also NY open time, as traders arrive to their desk for the day.

I trade mostly London, I do have a tendency to trade the Asian session also.

Okay, thanks.  I can't get to the computer til about 1 hour after NY open.  (I'm West Coast, US.)

--- 帖子 #1081 ---
That is fine, because, we are not getting in at the beginning of the big firms trades, since we don't know when that will happen, but we are getting in on the rebuy/resell where they attract price back to the area to full reamining unfilled orders, and of course these things usually occur couple hours or so after market opens.

Supply And Demand Trading Rules You Must Follow

Supply and demand zones are one of the core strategies I use to trade the forex market. I have been trading the supply and demand strategy since it became a popular method back in 2009, in the years since then Ive spent a lot of time trying to make supply and demand trading as profitable as possible, in doing so I had to change a lot of the supply and demand trading rules which traders commonly use because the rules themselves didnt quite make sense with the reality of how the market works.

Over the course of this article Im going to walk you through the 4 rules you need to help make your supply and demand trading more profitable.

1. Only Trade In The Direction Of The Most Recent High/Low

Most of the traders who trade supply and demand zones try to predict where a movement will end instead of trading in the direction of the movement itself.

What these traders typically tend to do is mark all the supply or demand zones which the market hasnt encountered yet and wait for the price to enter these zones before going either long or short. Usually these supply and demand zones will have been created a long time ago which means they dont have a high chance of causing a reversal anyway ( more on this in a minute )

Whilst the traders wait for the market to hit these old zones which they believe are going to cause a reversal, there are lots of zones forming in the direction of the current movement which the trader is neglecting to trade because he is so focused on predicting where the movement will reverse.

If the trader just stopped trying to find where the whole market was going to reverse and instead concentrated on taking trades at zones which formed in the direction of the most recent high or low, they would find themselves having far more winning trades.

A new high or low is a signal that the current momentum is to the upside or downside, by trading against this momentum you are unnecessarily putting yourself at risk of losing money because youre trying to trade against the trend.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Heres an example

The trader would have had the supply zone already marked on his charts before the price made a new high, when the bull move occurred and a new high was made, the trader should have seen it as a signal that the price wants to keep moving higher, instead he places a short trade because he believes the supply zone will cause the market to reverse.

After hitting the supply zone the price only manages to drop a small distance before breaking higher again, making another new high and forming a demand zone in the process. When the market returns to this demand it causes another up-move, had the trader taken this trade instead of the supply zone trade, its likely he would have made some money because he was trading in the direction of the current momentum as opposed to trading against it.

If you always trade in the direction of the most recent high or low youre giving yourself the best opportunity possible to have winning trades, reversals are very difficult to predict and usually when the market does reverse there will be another chance for you to get in right at the beginning of the reversal anyway, so theres no need for you to try to anticipate when a reversal will occur, just wait for it to happen and then trade in the new market direction.

--- 帖子 #1084 ---
2. Do Not Trade Zones Which Were Created A Long Time Ago

One of the main rules Sam Sedien implements in his trading of supply and demand zones is the idea that zones which formed a long time ago have a higher chance of working out successfully than zones which were created recently.

Like I explained in my supply and demand trading article this assumption is incorrect and makes no sense with how the banks operate in the market. Sam and other supply and demand teaches say old zones work because they have seen the price reverse at old zones before, but the reality is there only saying the old zones cause a reversal because there is no other reason they can point to as to why the reversal occurred.

It kinda comes back to what I was saying in my mutiple trading strategies article about how people who use one method will always look at the method as being the sole cause behind all movement in the market.

Sam Sedien teaches people that price moves because of a supply or demand zone being hit, the traders who then trade supply and demand using his teachings think every reversal begins from the market entering a supply or demand zone which is wrong, the only way the market will reverse is if the bank traders take profits off existing positions or place trades in the opposite direction to which the price is currently moving.

Both of these decisions are made based on how many orders are currently in the market, it has nothing to do with supply and demand zones it just happens to be that on some occasions the banks end up taking profits or placing trades at the same point where an old supply or demand zone formed.

This is why people think old supply and demand zones work, they see the price reverse at one of these old zones and think the zone itself is what has caused the reversal, not bank traders placing trades or taking profits which is the real reason for why the price has reversed.

Since I mainly trade the 1 hour chart I consider any supply or demand zones which formed over a week ago to be old, if the market returns to one of these zones I wont trade them nor will I expect them to cause a reversal, if the price does end up reversing at one of these zones I know its not the zone itself which has caused the reversal and is probably banks placing trades or taking profits.

OK. List all your credibility vs Sam Seiden's for saying his teaching is incorrect and yours is correct.

Hi Ruma welcome, for a start as stated a couple pages ago these articles are from forexmentoronline, of which I stumbled upon beginning of this year, which upped my game somewhat. So that question would need to be referred to them.

As for my own credibility, well, unfortunately for myself and followers my original livestream recordings from page 1 are now deleted by the sites servers due to age, but in these livestreams, I streamed from 8am UK or throughout the whole day, some even through to Asia. I was a taxi driver at the time trading a $200 account. My whole screen was on stream, account number, trades, facebook twitter, even stuff I was browsing inbetween trading the most transparent thing you would have ever witnessed. Anyway long story short, I did this every day for around 6 months, via skype and online meeting/streaming sites, and took my $200 to over $4,000 in that time, using Sams original teachings (So I have nothing Against Sam at all, if not for him I would have never been introduced to supply and demand). Many of my followers although not recommended followed my trades and teachings (I hope) and shown me on a weekly basis their growing accounts, 1 indian man I believe who I still speak to on skype now trades funds in Sweden.

During this time, I recieved many offers via PM, of which was also shown on my livestream, and 2 offers stood out. One of which was a private millionaire would like me to trade a demo and if succesful trade a big fund for him for 50/50 split. The other involved a Canadian Record Company (Avril Lavigne, Nickelback etc) who offered me a small $50,000 account to trade and accomodation and living expenses in Canada. I have a family so I could not move, however they compromised and sent a guy over here to where I live, bought me an office, trading desks, terminals the works. It was at this point due to contractual terms I could no longer share my trading  This is where I have been since I come back to this thread, as now that venture is over, and trading my own funds + private funds now in the UK. With full time trading however, comes alot of free time in life, and it is a very boring life, which is why I would like to get involved here again at FF and revive this once popular thread, depending on interest of course.

So, there we go, credibility somewhat adheered to  I'd say.

So in short, I love Sam Seiden, and his teachings are somewhat correct (remember he does not trade, only teaches  )

During this time though, I researched trades that I took that didn't work, and from what I have been posting from the articles it was at this point everything fell into place with supply and demand, and trading and accuracy has improved tenfold.

--- 帖子 #1087 ---
On that note, I really do hope some of my old followers are still around, as I remember you guys were more excited than I was at the oppertunity I recieved from the record company.

I would love to update you old followers, on all what happened during this time, if your still around of course

--- 帖子 #1088 ---
I do not give a shit neither for you nor for "forexmentoronline"....You made serious accusation on sam seiden so you answer and compare your credibility vs Sam Seiden.

You did not answer my question. shut up and get lost.

--- 帖子 #1089 ---
Ruma, you are extremely Rude, I did not quote your post due to offensive language and insults.

From looking at your previous posts, seems you are an extremely angry person, as this is not the only thread you have attacked.

I am not sure what you agenda is with defending Sam Seiden, as he does need defending, and he has not been attacked. If anything, if you read this thread at all in any measure worthwhile, you will see I have treated Sam Seiden as my god, and worshipped him from day 1. Just because I have altered how I look at supply and demand, does not deter away from the core principles that I first ever learned from Sam.

You have been suspended until further actions, and I shall resume this thread for the benefit of the followers of the thread and new traders to supply and demand, and may I take this moment to also apologise for Rumas behaviour here.

NZD/USD

Excellent thread reading through and good for us that you've come back to give us some insight.

It also explains why one of my trades is behaving the way it is, perhaps. That's if I've marked it up correctly.

It was a long, I was using the 5SMA method at the time...and it's the daily timeframe. (Monthly Profit - Daily Trading using SMA)

It was considered a buy using this method at the time as the previous candle had crossed the 5SMA.

--- 帖子 #1093 ---
Which timeframe and pair is this, and I shall take a look for you and post some analysis.

I take it the order line is a short (green dotted line) hopefully not a long

--- 帖子 #1094 ---
re: USD/CAD daily.

This pair would be a sell with it's obvious supply and demand levels? So I would say this is a buy...without any obvious news at least?

--- 帖子 #1095 ---
From a quick glance, we know that more times a level is hit weaker it gets, so of it breaks through this level, we would have new demand, which you can see being formed at the moment, only however if the supply is broken.

Fundamentals also must be adhered to aswell, we know that the FED rate hike for Sept is now down to about 18% and this seems to be priced in, so all the spectulative buying of the USD now is the prediction now of a rate hike in December.

--- 帖子 #1096 ---
Here's how to analyze possible bad trades that first look good, see first pic, nice demand zone, price has been attracted back it quickly which raises more interest for me and on the 38.2 fib, with 50fib covering the lower area of the zone.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

In pic 2 if we zoom out get a clearer view of things, applying a trendline here shows is, we are trending down here, and although there may be a reaction at the demand zone, it is now lowered the risk reward of this trade, trading with the dominant trend will always work in our favour, and simply zooming out like this can give a nice clear picture of a trade we should either avoid, or take with very minimal expectations.

Trying to clean things up a bit,  I have edited post 1 with the following

UPDATE MID 2016

As many know I had to abandon my sharing and livestreams for the funds I traded for a large Canadian Record Company, in my contract was areas that did not allow me to share or livestream my trading no more.

As of mid 2016, after a good many years trading the funds, I am back  Trading my own funds and also some private funds within the UK.
I hope to become once more active again within this thread and share everything I have gained in knowledge since trading the large fund account.

The webinars and livestreams I did back in 2011, was one of the most transparent seen on FF, not only did I have my trading account on full show, I had everything I did on show, facebook, twitter, writing emails to family, people literally lived my life with me as an upcoming trader. I was a taxi driver at the time and the account opened at $200, when I left to trade funds the account stood at $4,265.44

I am trying to figure a way to once again do these transparent streams again, however, although I am not bothered by followers seeing how much money I have in my own account, since I trade private funds, from family members, to businesses, I cannot of course show these on the screen, so I am figuring a way round this to get something set up.

Proof of trading: Now this is an annoying one, my whole point was never to cherry pick and show everything live, this is why I livestramed it, nothing can show proof better than a livestream as it happens, the webinars were saved I thought forever, upon clicking them today it seems they do not work  Many of my original followers will remember my early success and please chime in if you can, also if any of my early followers have screenshots, or even recorded my streams please get them posted up or mailed to me so I can put them up on page 1 for new followers to the thread.

My bread and butter is using daily charts with monthly and weekly areas marked, and 4 hr for entry. My original scalping method I started this thread of was used to show quickly the success of supply and demand without waiting hours for setup, the scalping of course still works to this day, but as a longer term trader I personally trade the higher timeframes.

--- 帖子 #1101 ---
I am an old follower of Redsword11 but I have been through your thread many times.  I'm happy to see you posting again and will follow.

The desire to show one's ability to trade in terms of profitability is noble and desirable but not always so easy to do as you are expressing.  I am on record as being one that has challenged many a guru to prove their claims especially those with their hands in the wallets of newbie traders. I know longer participate in such demands as it was consuming me with hatred for these fakes.  Rather I ignore them and take what I can from those that I have found through my own due diligence to be "real".

I know you are the real deal and I will follow you at my own risk.  Supply and demand trading has always been at the core of my trading although I have deviated at times and in fact I do still trade methods having nothing to do with S/D trading.

I look forward to following you to learn from your experience and expertise.  If appropriate I will post a chart now and then but only if it supports your thread.  Carry on my friend!

--- 帖子 #1102 ---
Hi Winston, welcome. Thank you so much for your kind words, did you ever watch any of my original streams?

Have seen your username somewhere before also can't remember where though

EURGBP, some daily levels I am currently looking at as BOE set to speak. On the 4 hr chart in 2nd picture, we can see EURGBP is in a nice channel upwards, I am looking for the channel to hold and reactions around these levels. As you can see i am already in a nice buy position on this pair on my families account that I trade from a lower demand, and have moved SL to positive position, I enjoy EURGBP

Welcome guys, did not post much during past week, sorting some personal issues out. But should be very much active again in the forthcoming weeks, especially since both FOMC and the BOJ dissapointed the market, which makes it very easy for intra-day supply and demand traders

As mentioned above, perfect scenarios currently for intraday traders.

Hey dean! Nice to see you on FF. I just got my platform up and running again. Looking forward to your insights.  Im still in practice mode because I got super rusty while sorting out real estate issues.  Looking to follow your path on intra day as my equity is too low to go above 1h.  Your story is truly inspiring.  I still use Sam Seiden more than you although I think some of his advanced stuff just clutters the board.   I found the RSI and other oscillators to be really hopeless.  Now its just support and resistance and trendlines.  I look at fibs too but more just a general 1/4 1/3 1/2 etc then trying to pinpoint the exact fib sequence.

I am still looking at your continuation patterns but havent caught on but catching asian and sydney bounces is a piece of cake now.

--- 帖子 #1110 ---
here is what I am looking at learning about S & D

--- 帖子 #1111 ---
This guy will be the first guy I can vouch for. I was there from the beginning and I can atest to his live streams. While Im still learning and have a lot of realestate issues I can tellyou 4 things that I did after Stumbling upon Dean.

1. Watch any and all Sam Seiden videos on line until your eyes bleed

2. Read through Rocky's Journal here on FF. I wont post the link. Don't be lazy and find it yourself.

3. Read through anything posted by Dean.

4. Read through James 16 thread.get the basics down

--- 帖子 #1112 ---
Im assuming you placed your trade on the trendline.  It looks good. I have found that Sunday bars stretch out the trend because of low volume. thats why you are seeing it meander. Hope it breaks for you.  I personally would have set a buy limit much lower at the strong rejection point.  (Long candles with southern wicks) a little higher than previous rejection.  I know Dean likes continuation patterns better while I look for reversals so I look forward to what he has to say.Im guessing the trade up high is a sell limit at rejection?

--- 帖子 #1113 ---
Winner winner chicken dinner!  Nice run allthe way to the daily reisistance!  I usually do not trade during this time. But Im beginning to see why Dean likes continuation patterns during London and NY. I mainly scalp Sydney and Asia. Reversals are more common.  Its all making sense now...

--- 帖子 #1114 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Edit: While I have not been stopped out yet, I came embarrassingly close.9.5 pips down.  Upon analyzing it I usually do not enter this early. This is a combination of the london boys taking their profits and heading off for some pints and snooker, and NY loudmouths taking profits and off to their power lunches.  I forgot about the Loud mouthed New yorkers.  I usually start my trading around  2PM NY time.  SO THIS TRADE IS AN EMBARRASMENT AND LACK OF DUE DILLIGENCE ON MY PART.

--- 帖子 #1115 ---
Hi,

You began writing about 4 rules, but only listed 2 of them due to interruptions.

Could you please write the other 2 rules ?

Thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #1116 ---
Hope you were able grab that chicken by the neck before it took off. I have tried a few entry points entry at the base of the move hardly gets triggered but when it does R:R is 1:3 or more. I try to find potential trade for all of use to analyze and profit from together. Win or lose. BTW I too went head first with Sam 6 years ago just getting back into. I have been into harmonics, price, ratios etc. with Mr Pips. I post and learned alot there. Awesome guy personally. Anyway trying to simplify even further.

I'll look for trade to post in second

Also Everyone Let me know if you AGREE/DISAGREE and please give analysis behind it so the whole thread can learn thanks

--- 帖子 #1117 ---
Last one of the night heading to watch debate. 3 trades for a total risk (a big 187 pips and reward 768 pips). Assuming all are triggered. If a new high is created I will close, readjust and analyze (FYI) Jump in the water and let's take a look at these and make or lose some cashola

Edited: lost u/cad -41 pips. strong supply area,deleted first order on A/NZD(want better entry)

E/NZD take profit 1 adjusted at 1.5485 supply area and at BE

Weekly long bias fell into demand(one to keep an eye on 500 pips target overall if it holds)

--- 帖子 #1118 ---
Hey Dean,

What you think of my analysis

--- 帖子 #1119 ---
Please disregard the Buy Order its suppose to be a sell order

--- 帖子 #1120 ---
How I see it, it may not hold. it dancing between supply/demand. Better odds is at top of area. will give better analysis later heading to work.

my limit is at 130.93 with stop 131.30.

any other takers on whats going on?

--- 帖子 #1121 ---

Hereunder my first attempt at identifying a supply zone on a 1H TF from the GBP USD, my favorite pair to short at the moment.

I actually took a short yesterday, but not following the SD rules...hopefully this one will come out in my favor.

Would this qualify as a supply zone?

No I would not consider that supply, but I am glad it worked out for you. There is a bunch of crap on there but lets break it down. The yellow lines shows previous supply and demand. As you can see its a bit larger in scope because you want a bigger picture of what is going on. Inside of that last leg was small supply and demand noted in red. I assume you based your trading decision. The candle did not close below the red demand until the next candle so I would not have taken trade base on this assessment. Also as an added note its overall in a range and you could have taken a long position. I missed as I was try to answer your questions. Look at the 4hr chart to see what I mean.(previous and recent S/D). notice how lime demand got taken out. now you look for shorts.

As a sside note if you run into too many S/D areas it will not likely hold. if it hit the area 3 or more times pass on it

Hey VQtrader,

if you look to the left we can see that price it has brokern the last swing high, and that gives us great indication that the price is going to be moving up, and just to double check with the fib ext, from swing high to swing low it falls perfectly on the 68.1, and we can see that the price has stalled there and then took off, so inclusion we can expect the price to come back to that demand, and  it would be a good buy, as you can see the trade played out to perfection

hope that helps

Hi guys..

Just wanted to share a trade I entered  this morning.. On usdjpy 1hr .I went long at 101.385 price level,a little above the arrow ,one interesting the with this demand level is that It could be considered  also as a flag.

--- 帖子 #1143 ---
Cashforex, I give you full credits for spotting this, absolutely beautiful trade, you are doing magnificently well done.

Tip: The quicker price returns to a zone the more prominent move away will be.

Apologies to all for my lack of posting lately, I am having some personal issues with family regarding health and it's tough  but hope to be back in full swing soon. To others posting here keep it up.

--- 帖子 #1144 ---
great to learn from well established traders with discipline.  I too have been preoccupied with other things.  But looking forward to give out some knowledge and learn about the higher timeframes.  I hope to go live next month but I am not happy because my computer updated and I did not save my demo password on my Oanda account. So I am starting from scratch again after being up 80 pips scalping pre-sydney and asia.  This is part time a few days a week with tight stops. A good gig for a us eastern seaboard Americans. Pre sydney starts now but I have to reset all my charts....

--- 帖子 #1151 ---
Stopped out for minus 5. I saw the wedging on m1 and thought to pull the plug but I decided against it since my stop was tight anyway. I'm thinking Play by play analysis might be hurting my trading. But since Im still in demo mode Ill keep going. This type of trading sees 1/3 Take profit trades. 1/3 BE trades and 1/3 cost of trading trades. The BE's are usually BE+1 so its a 66% net winning scene. Just not my week apparently. That's statistics for ya!Getting into Sydney now so I begin to keep an eye on the Ozzie and also wait for the chinese to open the asian  box.  Some yen news tonight but thats really not my bag.  I like to follow the Aus because they are mineral rich and it correlates nicely with gold and silver.  the asian box opens and I look for bounces.But I work so I find it hard to stay up later than that.

Hereunder a PDf file with a AUD/NZD 1H TF chart containing 2 supply zones, the bigger one was drawn on the 4H TF, the smaller red one on the 1H TF.

Plz don't pay attention to the short position I opened, this is not following the SD rules and is just a LT trade based on Daily chart.

many thanks for the feed-back.

Greetings folks

Here's a free trade am in right now..Uj 1hr ,hopefully am in profit at the moment I hope it makes it to the tp..the market rotated bank to a demand level from a prior impulsive leg,though this trade was originally planned to be a scalp trade given the fact that we now have a new bearish trend in place,but  it looks to be working out pretty good.

The other reason for talking this trade is the proximity to a major fib zone of the last bullish run.

Very Nice trace Cashforex, it's instructing to see a trade taken on a 5min TF!

Seems like we are all on the same trade :-D, how do you identify your Supply and Demand zones on the chart?

--- 帖子 #1174 ---
Wow that's interesting, well as u can see on the first 1hr chart ..the market  has just since carved out a new bullish trend,and what we was was only a retracement into our demand zone (coloured rectangle). But as I said in my earlier post I had to go back to the 15 min chart to pinpoint my exact buy point(indicated with an arrow).then the  61.8 fib zone further increased my confidence to take the trade.

Note:Am basically using trade interceptor for analysis, while I place trades on my peoperstone ctrader account,hence  the difference on the earlier posted chart.

I forgot to add ,the demand level shown on my hourly chart is basically a flag.. and I love to take them whenever I spot them.

--- 帖子 #1176 ---
Thx Biafran, what is trade interceptor?

I took a SL on the AUD NZD today, good feeling because I placed the trade well upfront this morning and never thought it would hit this fast. The SL was taken at 1.0520 (actually too soon because not in the zone) with a stop at 1.0550. If I would've taken the Sl in the middle of the supply zone this would have given a max 20 pip stop, which is amazing given that I was aiming for this level on a 4H chart. Really happy about this trade, hopefully it will work out.

Trade interceptor is a forex trading app that runs both on mobile and  desktop computer, but I use them primarily for charting purposes only since I enter 95% of my trades on my tablet due to the nature of my  job.

As for your  AudNzd trade..that supply level sure looks strong possibly that was profit taking level for institutional  traders ..I guess you  are in the money now...

--- 帖子 #1178 ---
even though picks were good I am down from last week base on EU & AU trades. I like dropping down and waiting on price action to react in the zone but that dam J.O.B won't leave me alone. Anyway, here is a trade I am looking at for next week. Maybe if price reacts well in the zone we can grab a sell and a buy. Penny for your thoughts. Peace

--- 帖子 #1179 ---
Here are my EU-AU trades currently negative on both.  I took an aggressive trade on the AU based off on the slight confluence area.  I had my doubts but rolled the dice.  As a safety measure I did see strong supply further up and set an order just in case.  As it stands new demand has been created and will know more when it gaps up or down Sunday.  As for the EU it is a complete mess.  A new structure/swing high has been created but the pull back has created equalibrium between supply and demand so its in a range.  Enough said with this one.  I will take my lost with this one.  EU took my gains plus some

Hello VQtrader, this EUR USD trade is only down +- 30 pips right? I would say that on a Daily chart that is not a complete catastrophe...I like the demand zone you identified there between 1.1120 and 1.1150, but this zone has been touched twice now. The supply zone has been touched several times too.

In general I would say that friday was a special day, beeing month end and a friday at the same time, eg I think a lot of the usual players were not in the market on friday afternoon. So the question, for me, here is: to what extend can we assign these late friday afternoon movements in price to the usual 'big banks/shark' players and are those supply and demand zones representative for us?

--- 帖子 #1181 ---
I am down 38 pips. My overall bias is long base off impulse move up, but thought I could capture supply before the up move. What I would like to see is a gap down to 1.11800 or move down which +26 pips which is at a minor demand level. I try not focus on news just charts. Be there done that and its stressful with little results. I am good at this chart stuff rather stay in my wheel house and capture pips and fine tune as needed. Part of my trading plan(in my weakness section) Missing opportunities and I look at too many pairs(and too many things in charts) trying to grab my 50 pips per day before work I have to remember sometimes its about quality not quantity. These moments remind me of this. I am VERY close to trading and paying all small bills every month which is huge step considering how long I have been in the busy. Anyway here is the chart(the take profit is from another order disregard)

Thanks, this is new for me, do you take previous daily support and resistance into view?

--- 帖子 #1222 ---
HI welcome, please try and refrain from using support and resistance in this thread, as it is highly inferior to supply and demand, so to re-word your question, would be do you take previous days supply and demand into view. The answer really depends on timeframe, predicted trade time etc.

--- 帖子 #1223 ---
Understood, I will need to try to understand how to use Supply and demand and Fibonacci to enter and take positions. I will try to reread the the threads.

Hello DeanKenny, will you teach us how to use Supply&Demand on lower time frames?

Thx

--- 帖子 #1226 ---
I am not putting words in DeanKenny mouth but if you can find it on higher timeframe you can find it anywhere(it can get tricky at times). My suggestion is to start on a time frame that has clear S/D and see how price react to your decision an hour and up. In essence, if the big boys and you agree the price will move out that area fast. You just see it better on lower. Just look at cashforex pics notice he locates an explosive move out then wait on retrace back to S/D. That's how I do it as well but I drop down to 5 min sometimes 1 min, but it hard to get filled at times. hope that helps.

But of course we would like DK perspective

This is the most profitable strategy hands down. The only problem is knowing when the S&D zone will hold. Sometimes you adjust the zones just to see the price breaking the new zone, reaching the previous zone 30 pips or so below, hitting SL. Then moving up 150 pips. Frustrating to say the least. We could certainly wait for confirmation but then we need to give away some RR. So what do you guys do to know when the zone will be broken?

This is one I am looking at right now, EUR NZD long opportunity. Short term trend looks bullish to me, supply zones on the daily were taken out, this for me shows that the demand is in control, so I am willing to take a risk by going long on a retrace.

Hello Eagle,

How can we sport the Time frame you are on? Also I dont see how can we spot your supply and demand zones?

Bravo on the USD cad short, i had the zone marked, but I missed the trade

--- 帖子 #1309 ---
Looking for the same thing on the yen as I was the ozzie. But Im not late to the party this time. The flow should start leveling out now. Im playing it loose. Just hope it's not too loose and miss another. but that is a win if I miss because I didnt lose.

Editlayed it too loose.missed my entry by a pip and a half. Once it retreats I dont wait for it to return. The momentum starts to die and I start to set up for asia. I didn't lose so I won 7out of 8 trades. 5 did not trigger, One was stopped out. Two were in the money. No BE's today. Today was a good day.

Hello SGken,

They look ok, but a Topdown analysis would be better, so starting at 4H for example and bring it donw to a 5 min analysis. I am doing the same for myself starting at weekly, then Daily, and taking my trades on a 4H chart, it works better this way, because it adds a lot more weight to your trade

Br,

Minosd

--- 帖子 #1321 ---
Hi Minosd,

Thank you for your advice! You mean start from higher TF and move down is by looking at the overall trend and trade with the trend?

--- 帖子 #1322 ---
You see signal on weekly.then you see signal on daily when price retraces from supply or demand zone.and then you see signal on 4 h and enter?or you just look weekly and daily trend and enter on 4h by signal?

--- 帖子 #1323 ---
I am not a specialist, but if I see a zone on the weekly that corresponds with a zone on the Daily and I zoom in and there is also a zone on the 4H, everything with the trend, then there is a big chance things will work out right for me.

If you trade on the 5 min you could do the same with for example: 4H, 1H, 5Min/15Min/30Min

You can also just consider the 4H (weekly in my case) to check if you are not above/below important resistance or support zones.

--- 帖子 #1324 ---
For example, a long on the USD JPY I took this morning, it's bearish on the weekly but the pair has been showing some bullishness by breaking the downward resistance line you see on the Daily, also more recently it invalidaded the supply zone you see on Daily TF.

On the Daily again you also see a demand zone beginning at 103.60 until 103.20, I drew +- the same on the 4H chart and took the trade from there. A little risky because I was late...ideally would've been a BL at the middle of the demand at 103.40, stop 20 pips and let it run until the first supply I see on the 1H, +- 1:4 RR.

--- 帖子 #1325 ---
That was a very good explanation and it was clearer to me now. Thank you minosd! I will practice more on it.

I have one question, from my understanding, is the demand zone supposed to be drew from the last latest bearish candle open to the low of the lowest low happen most recently and supply zone supposed to be drew from the last latest bullish candle open to the high of the highest high happen most recently? From your USDJPY D1 chart, I saw the smaller zone was not drew to that and i'm wondering if you drew to that, you would have an entry on the earlier bearish pin bar formed and close with a profit of 1:2. Correct me if i'm wrong as I'm still learning. Thank you!

--- 帖子 #1326 ---
It's a scalping style I developed over the years. I learned this after many years of trading with EA Scalpers. I combined the price action with sam seiden's methods. This is done Primarily after the London close And NY comes back from Lunch To just before the Sydney Open. Money flows begin to slow down and if price took a major bounce of Supply or demand during the NY London Over lap, It's a good chance it will continue as the money flows start to Dwindle after London closes. It often looks like a salmon jumping upstream. It's a pattern I see often.

--- 帖子 #1327 ---
Set up sell limit on Loonie. US CPI and Canadian news coming up so keeping the stop tight. With the US slinging bombs all around and Canada's oil prices going up I expect this down trend to continue. But CPI could be a surprise. 8:30 NY time will tell.

Edit:Stopped out for minus  ten., (pats self on the back for controlling risk) On to the next one. This is not my normal time to trade so I am still learning about NY open.  Thats the cost of doing business.

--- 帖子 #1335 ---
If you are reffering to your blue zone, which to me is just a random placement, this is not demand if that is what your getting at. There is no base, there needs to be a base of some sort. Also the top area must be the last open of selling into the area, so infact the top of the zone should be top of the red candle that drops into the blue zone which infact did react as demand later on and would of involved a profitable trade, but as for the blue zone, unfortunately it is way off anything to do with supply and demand.

Goodmorning evrybody

I stumbled on this style of trading a couple weeks ago and found it VERY interesting.

Once you get the right level picking down you can clearly see entry points, SL and TP levels....

So. the name of the game is "picking the right levels"...of course related to the right market conditions.

So here is my practice take on the concept :

I'd like to build a methodology for having a couple of trades a day, so my first hint is to use 4H-1H-15m for multichart analysis, of course correct me if i am wrong!

Here is Eur/Usd chart from this morning my time (Germany).

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Price is on a large bullish retracement (You can see the sequence of higher highs and lows on the H1 image) that did break the descending channel from a strong bear movement.

Here is the 4H chart
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

From the H1 chart, I found a level around 1,0546 (the middle yellow stripe) that could act as a demand zone in the near future.

Confluences : 61,8% fib retracement from the last bullish swing + 88,6 fib fan + 1:1 harmonic completion from the latest sellout from the high (see the H1 picture for reference).

If the price come back to this level is also VERY possible that it will fall out the low Bollinger Band.

So In theory a "textbook" long....

I have a limit long at 1,05410, stop at 1,05277, and TP at 1,06078 for an unbelieveble RR 5:1!!

Again, you can see the levels on the chart...

And of course I am just a student, so basically my question is if this train of thoughs of mine can make any sense.

I am nowadays at the stage of isolating the good levels from the bad, and I DO NOT find the challenge that easy.

How did You do that guys? Is it just building the eye with tons of practicing and screen time?

Already a ton asked  Sorry, but I am indeed a "passionate guy"

I thank you in advance if you will take the time to evaluate and comment.

I know this is "after the event" and I am not usually one for afters, as many know, I hate it and always pride myself back in the day showing zones for my live followers to profit from, but this one was just to sweet to not share.

USDJPY here, as the FEDS starting coming in a little more dovish, USD lost some traction, this was all happening while approaching my area marked here, whacking on a FIB shows 61.8 level right in the supply area too. Price literally tapped the fib level in the supply area and sold off like no tomorrow. Supply and demand gives me so much of a rush, I just can't sit here and not share with people.

Target was reached in no time at all, which was the start of the up move, upon which I placed the fib end zone. Supply and demand, through my many years of trading has shown to me to be consistently the absolute best risk-reward ratio vs percentage of winning trades.

--- 帖子 #1361 ---
Great stuff Dean, WELCOME BACK!

How are 'ya doin'??

Are you plannin to revitalize this thread?

Best wishes.

maxx

--- 帖子 #1362 ---
I would like to, yes. If there is interest still in my methods etc I am more than happy to share, as I get a rush out of all this, and you guys get a good source of free info, everyones a winner

I am currently tracking down some of my live recordings I did back near the start of this thread, as I can see the links are dead now, which is truly a shame, as they were absolutely riddled with top level teachings. But looks like a follower of mine made some recordings and I may be able to bring some of it back here.

--- 帖子 #1363 ---
hello ..i found your thread today and looks very interesting...would be greatt to come back...btw i also try to play your video on first page but ...nothing

--- 帖子 #1364 ---
Yes, the videos from the first page seem to have expired, which is such a shame  But as I mentioned I have come across one of my followers who has told me they have a few recordings of my sessions, and I will try my upmost best to get these open to the public and shared within this thread.

--- 帖子 #1365 ---
Anyone watching cable, we have a nice sell off happening at the moment just before the Trump/Xinping meeting in Florida. This is happening at a nice supply zone which has been prominant since 3rd April as price keeps coming up, sell orders are just sat there at huge amounts. Add to this the fib of the downmove from end of march to 4th April, we see price hit the 61.8 just like yesterdays trade and is now selling off.

Cable and alot of other pairs have been ranging for a while now, but does not mean we can't make money in ranging markets, supply and demand is found everywhere, including both ranging and trending markets.

--- 帖子 #1366 ---
I would like to learn more from you sir Dean!

--- 帖子 #1367 ---
Sir Dean, haha that's a new one, quite like it, however being quite humble I don't like being looked up at or seen in any different way to anyone else, after all there was a time when I was the one trying to learn how to trade.

Hi DK,

Been reading up on S/D and hope that you could guide us on the journey of trading with S/D. Will try to catch up on this thread, almost 70pages, gonna go thru them first.

Cheers,

--- 帖子 #1370 ---
Hi Dean,

I suggest for the time being to post a quick recap of the core concepts, maybe with a couple of charts, so that we are sure to be everybody on the same page.

I think it would be useful to the newer guys...don't you think that too?

Have a super WE everybody.

maxx, that sounds like a great idea, especially for those of us with old eyes!!

Have a great w/e

--- 帖子 #1372 ---
Man that its a great Idea..!!

--- 帖子 #1373 ---
Good idea, basically the last couple charts I posted up are perfect supply and demand trades, using a fib as extra confluence. However of course finding the supply and demand is the part which takes time to learn. Once learned, you won't believe how easily you can then spot them, nowadays I can open a chart and nakedly mark out all the areas blindy without rectangles etc within seconds. Something a few of my followers also came to find too, hope some of them come back to join me on this, and even take an admin/teaching role themselves to our new fellows

--- 帖子 #1374 ---
Remember this USDJPY supply I had marked out which worked few days ago, look again at todays USDJPY and that supply zone  Did anyone take this trade, I shown you this zone a few days ago? Unfortunately I didn't as had car problems today

First a picture of the supply I am talking about, and secondly the reason I didn't make it home today to trade

--- 帖子 #1375 ---
Happy for this thread to be alive again, read the whole thread about 5 times over! Learnt a lot from your posts.

--- 帖子 #1376 ---
Hi Dean,

Is this a valid supply zone on the 4hr AUDCAD... Has multiple fib confluence too.

--- 帖子 #1377 ---
Very nice Tuk, good work. That is a good level, can you look further left and tell me if this supply has taken out any demand zones, this would make it stronger.

--- 帖子 #1378 ---
Thanks Dean. Would you say the circled areas to the left are valid demad zones or a swing low? I know some teachings would say its a demand zone due to the bullish engulfing candles. Just going out for the day, great weather in London! Will come back and do the weekly analysis, so will post more pics.

Hello. In 2011 I recorded 3 of Dean's presentations, mostly about shorter time frames. They total about 2 1/2 hours. All are quite good.

Shortly after video 3 begins, there is about a 2 minute blank screen. This was my error because I was new to recordings, and failed to pause.

Hi Dean,

on one of the other forums you mentioned the importance fundamentals now plays in your trading. Can you advise where you would start in terms of fundamental analysis and what your daily routine is ? I only watch the economic calendar and avoid trading during high priority news.

I missed you the first time round on this thread so looking forward to learning as much as I can this time.

FlyLo

--- 帖子 #1383 ---
Yes that's right, I non stop read the forex news now to know what's going on, I use various website to keep up to date mainly dailyfx, forexlive and fxstreet. Especially when fed speakers are due to speak these news sites are critical, for example the usdjpy trade I took last week which was a short. I was actually bullish USD at the time but the feds came out to speak and were alot more dovish than people were expecting about more rate hikes. In turn I saw USDJPY in a lovely supply zone as this was happening and I knew 100% to short the hell out of it. That is just 1 small example of how I use fundamentals to aid my trading now.

On top of that, just reading the news all day just makes you feel alot more informed on the markets even if you don't use it directly for trading.

--- 帖子 #1384 ---
Hi Dean...just wondering if you're doing Skype meetings ?

--- 帖子 #1385 ---
Hi kfarawi, not right now no, but it is something I am thinking about starting up again, as I mentioned earlier in the week, depending how much interest gets shown in this thread and style of trading, I will then think about something. Will probably be another screen sharing setup however like I used to do.

--- 帖子 #1386 ---
So I have been doing my Sunday nightly skim of all the charts, and going to try and share a few things, to get us live and kicking again in here.

A good one I just come across here is the GBPAUD, especially with Fridays weak data coming out of the UK, GBP for alot is looking bearish, however the GBPAUD continues to rise, on the back of an even weaker AUD. I found a nice demand zone here, falling right on a fib, with 50 retracement as back up. So for the guys asking about how I am using fundamentals, right from market open tonight, I will watch this closely if it approaches this demand, and I will be constantly watching the news sites for clues towards AUD, hopefully some hints at more weakness, to give me more confidence in hitting buy at this level. Then if price has not reached this area during Asia, then in the morning I will be looking closely at UK news, I don't just look at the news on the calender here, any news relating to economy can move markets, hence the sites I mentioned a couple posts back are now key to my trading. So looking for clues at maybe some more GBP strength. This demand zone is a perfect reason to be looking at forex news for small clues.

--- 帖子 #1387 ---
I would be interested for sure!

I have this EURGBP 4HR marked which is a fresh and original zone, nested within Daily supply. If it reaches back up to the supply zone it would form a bearish Bat pattern at 88.6 Fib too.

--- 帖子 #1388 ---
I suppose those blue and yellow lines we see in that chart are SMAs or EMAs. Am I right? What's their pourpose?

--- 帖子 #1389 ---
They are 100 and 200 moving averages, I only show purpose for them on the daily chart. As it's a well known fact that institutions/banks use both the 100 and 200 on a daily chart for some big moves. So when price is close to either one on the daily I do like to take notice, but until I mention them, they don't play any purpose currently on the lower timeframes.

--- 帖子 #1390 ---
Wow tuk, you read my mind here is my eurgbp chart.

--- 帖子 #1391 ---
Cheers Dean,

I've already got Forexlive as one of my news sources so I'll add the other two and to keep myself up to date.

--- 帖子 #1392 ---
Very good Flyinglotus, for DailyFX, I would recommend especially the session briefings.

Asian session Briefing

European Session Briefing

America Session Briefing

As when you start to trade you can get a rundown briefing of what happened in the previous sessions. So if you wake up tomorrow morning 8am UK time to start trading, you can go and check the Asian Session Briefing to get quickly up to date all what happened during that time, setting you up for your trading session all informed and up to date.

--- 帖子 #1393 ---
OK, time to get organised. I've created a Fundy folder in chrome bookmarks with:

Forex Factory/ Calendar   ( I start with this every morning anyway)

Daily FX / daily - briefing  ( defaults to daily briefing as per Dean's recommendation)

Forex Live / Forex news

FXStreet / Forex News

Cheers again Dean

Just an update to followers, I have a trade currently here for GBPUSD on supply (short), keeping my eye on news. (Chart is 4 hour)

--- 帖子 #1399 ---
Just a bit of transparence here about my trading. One of my family members gave me $10,000 to trade of their money, which I trade for free since it's a close family member, just mirroring my account. Here is the statement for last month, completely clean and raw!

--- 帖子 #1400 ---
I saw this demand zone, but I don't think we'll retrace this high

--- 帖子 #1401 ---
Possibly, whos to know right now, but all I know as we speak now, Cable is in a beautiful demand zone, hitting the 50 fib absolutely perfectly, unfortunately I missed this trade  due to my car issues end of last week etc. But this demand is working out lovely right now, even with GBP being bearish from the majority, the fact it hit the fib pretty much to the pip within demand is all just too sweet

--- 帖子 #1402 ---
Ok, so been getting ALOT of private messages, and a few on this subject, being why am I bearish GBP at the moment. Basically with supply and demand, we favour the more powerful bear/bull, currently supplies are now taking out and erasing demand levels, which would mean a downtrend is the order of the day at the moment, hence why supply areas will be more favourable over demands, demands still work, however they won't get as far as supply keeps growing.

The perfect scenario here would be for this demand to push up to my marked supply level on the fib, and for a sell-off to occur, which in turn would hopefully break this demand zone marked continuing the downtrend. However I stress nothing is guranteed, economic news as well as economy in general can turn within seconds, with a single word out a feds mouth can move anything in the opposite direction anticipated. So keeping an eye on news is pivotal to my trading. I hope this explained my bias on this pair for now, any questions just shoot them in a post on here.

--- 帖子 #1403 ---
SPOTTING BANK LEVELS

The other popular question I got was how I spot Bank and Instituional supply and demand levels. The answer will come as a surprise to alot of people at how easy this is to spot. This supply area I marked on cable happened at 7am-8am UK Time, this is the time EU trading has begun and gets into full swing along with the UK. So what can move a market like this, well easy, big players, banks and institutions, and what time do they get at thier desks, yes you guessed it, 7-8am UK Time . So this level I have marked to me is a "bank level".

--- 帖子 #1404 ---
Thank you for sharing.

--- 帖子 #1405 ---
How do you use fib levels?Which level is more powerful in SD?

--- 帖子 #1406 ---
I tend to favour 50 at the absolute most, 50 is popular with both retail traders and banks alike especially on the big charts daily-weekly-monthly. 61.8 is also another interesting level, however all of them play their own part in a way, if there is lots of selling pressure we will see the early fib retracements coming into play very quickly.

--- 帖子 #1407 ---
What do you think, Dean? Would you treat a strong 'news' backed move as a supply zone or was there enough liquidity in the news period for banks to release all orders without any left behind for their good average fills?

--- 帖子 #1408 ---
Have you marked that from a lower timeframe? When you get to lower timeframes like this, can get a bit messy.

--- 帖子 #1409 ---
I have Dean (30m), although my bias is strongly bearish for GBP and I have been stacking trades as we progress downwards. I'm trying to use SD areas to enter in the direction of my bias with less drawdown.

--- 帖子 #1410 ---
From a quick look this is how I have supply on the 30min chart, however I have less confidence as the timeframes gets lower, however it is a new supply, bit it is fairly large.

--- 帖子 #1411 ---
Makes sense, Dean. I'll watch your supply zone with interest! Thanks for the quick feedback. I'm targeting 1.21 for the next area of major consolidation before bottoming at 1.19 long term.

--- 帖子 #1412 ---
Very good that you have set targets in mind. Also what we tend to find with bank levels, is that if the banks have any unfilled orders from this morning from that sell off, they will attract price back to this area, attracting buyers along the way, so they can fill their unfilled short orders, what we would call a "bull trap". Of course I am not a bank so I cannot see what unfilled orders are, however I do know banks sold at that level marked on the 4hr.

--- 帖子 #1413 ---
Thanks, Dean. I've been a quiet follower for a while.

Have you you every attempted blending market profile with your SD analysis? You obviously have a knack for spotting 'naked' set ups, but for the learners, using a volume profile tool and watching for high volume areas which line up with SD levels can be a very good confluence. I've taken some brilliant trades off the back of this.

I've attached a screenshot I took a while back on MT4, but for anyone interested, if you use the session volume profile on Trading View with data from IDC (not a retail broker) you can spot areas of high activity and thus orders.

--- 帖子 #1418 ---
Your right, I can nakedly see where all the volume is, and lies. However for beginners this may be very useful. So you are more than welcome to post the tool for others to learn from.

--- 帖子 #1419 ---
Anyone/those without Dean's naked vision wanting MT4 volume profile indicators can find them over on Trader Dale's thread or Trading View.

Thanks again for your help, Dean.

--- 帖子 #1420 ---
You're welcome, I'll even have a little play with it myself, be interesting how it compares to where I plot the volume in my head.

--- 帖子 #1421 ---
Great. I advocate IDC on Trading View as the data input, as they're not retail broker biased/dumb money.

Also worth a look at Futures symbols rather than forex for pure volume data comprised of actual futures orders (also on trading view). You can pick out some sweet spots of order stacks and convert this to forex. If you use the 'fixed range' you can draw the range for the volume to be taken from, actively excluding 'used up & non virgin' supply and demand points.

Have fun!

SPOTTING NEW/FRESH ZONES

What we have here, is supply zones all being taken out, and where this supply was, is now formed a demand zone, ever heard support and resistence traders mention pivot zones or the old saying "resistence turns into support" and vice versa. Well here is why, supply has been sucked up by demand, and has now broken the supply levels, thus in turn creating a new and fresh "demand level"

--- 帖子 #1424 ---
I remember marking this supply out for you guys back on April 6th, again today this has provided a very profitable trade, 3rd entry into supply and gone a bit deeper so I would be careful on a 4th entry. Anybody take any of this supply I marked out last week?

As much as I like marking zones out for you guys like this, and I know alot of you who don't post just take my zones and profit from them which is fine. But learning how I do this will be a priceless way to learn how to trade, especially since I am sharing everything for free, so I do urge any lurkers to get active, ask questions, post charts etc.

--- 帖子 #1425 ---
UJ trade.I have a lot to learn from you.

--- 帖子 #1426 ---
How much entry can i take into a supply/demand?

--- 帖子 #1427 ---
Think of it like this, when a "fresh" zone is formed, there are for example 1000 sell orders there of large size unfilled. When price reaches this zone and people continue to buy, they buy into these sellers, which fill those waiting sell orders. Now there may only be 500 sell orders there, and the supply zone may work for a second time. Each time price enters an area the weaker it becomes.

--- 帖子 #1428 ---
Hi Dean...forgive me if this is a stupid question:  where do these 1000 sell orders come from ?  Who is interested in selling at those levels ?  thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #1429 ---
Please refer to POST 1403, about spotting bank levels. Basically the big boys get to thier desks in the morning and make their orders for the day, which is why we see alot of movement after a quiet Asian session, however due to the sheer size banks and others trade at, they cannot get all their orders filled. So those banks will have unfilled orders needing to be filled, which is why alot of the time we see price go back to these zones like a magnet only to be sold quite sharply once hit, as those orders from the morning are still there unfilled.

--- 帖子 #1430 ---
Ok.Now it's clear.

--- 帖子 #1431 ---
hello dean ,

which is the proper action on the following

1. waiting the price to reach the daily demand zone and go long?

2.go  long at lower time frame on the current 4hr demand zone and then short again?

--- 帖子 #1432 ---
Before I even mention trading AUD and the CAD, go look at the news sites I have mentioned and look at the news for these 2 countries currently, think you will be very surprised, and may make you completely change bias or ignore these currencies altogether for now.

A question regarding SD zones.Is this correct or something missing or wrong.

--- 帖子 #1434 ---
Got it.  Cheers

--- 帖子 #1435 ---
lets forget about the curencies and the countries ...and watch the setup...

--- 帖子 #1436 ---
I like to do body to shadow, I don't like the idea of marking pinbars or long candles the way they do, if I get long candles on 4hr for example just simply switch down to 1hr chart and find the highest/lowest body to shadow forming, switch back up, and you have your zone.

--- 帖子 #1437 ---
Stick around my friend, slowly it will all piece together, and trust me when it does, you will be astounded, and never use an indicator again, or these silly cross/tdi systems which have no relevance to current economy.

--- 帖子 #1438 ---
Great.Thanks.

And also about this concept?

--- 帖子 #1439 ---
Trendlines are not things I use often, I do place them if I see an obvious trend, but breaking or not breaking one doesn't take away from the power of unfulfilled orders, however the breaking of an opposite zone does. Like I have mentioned earlier, on the GBPUSD, if the supply is breaking through demands, then supply is in control, and more orders will be waiting in supply over demand.

--- 帖子 #1440 ---
Thanks Sir.I will remember.

--- 帖子 #1441 ---

Looks like a decent zone to me, however price did penetrate it quite deeply, so there are orders there, but not as many as I would like to see, also price has been away from this zone for quite a while. This is probably again news related with Yellen speaking later, market is now in a wait and see mode for Yellen, personally I am predicting some hawkish comments which will result in some more bullish USD. Place a fib over there too, see how that comes out.

--- 帖子 #1446 ---
Touched to the pip

--- 帖子 #1447 ---
Excellent stuff, I hope you have locked in some profits or moved your SL at least, this what I love seeing albeit on a 15 min chart. Users profiting from what I am doing, huge well done to you. Personally I am looking for that move to 61.8 on the nice 4hr supply.

--- 帖子 #1448 ---
I have been reading a couples of pages but has been enough to know that you love Fib and that you would probably ask that.

There is nothing interesting, that is why i didn't post any pic with them.

We will need to wait and see

Appreciated. I am counting on this zone being the peak, but if I'm wrong and we do go higher I'll join you on the 61% short!

--- 帖子 #1450 ---
Look for clues tonight 9:10pm as FED YELLEN speaks, I am looking for a Hawkish tone, which would be shorting GBPUSD, USD bullish behaviour. If it's near my zone too even better!!!!!

Couple other scenarios, if level is not reached tonight, tomorrow at 9:30am there is some big UK news out, which might give some drive to the market.

--- 帖子 #1454 ---
Ok apologies in advance for the long post... I have been learning S&D from another thread and community, which lays out specific rules and processes. Some may be overkill or do not necessarily make sense to me. So, wanted to check here.

Dean, please can you share your thoughts and process on the below questions. Others feel free to share your experiences and methods

Questions:

1) Time Frame do you have a set in stone time frames, I know you mention on your first post you mark out monthly, weekly, daily and enter on 4 hour. Is that 100% or sometimes you will day trade the 15min etc?

2) This brings me to question 2, Potential vs Valid demand zones. There are plenty of zones around how do you differentiate a potential zone to a valid zone. Ive learnt from my course that for it to be a valid zone it must break recent structure trend line or opposing zones.

3) Time frame alignments How do you align and trade the timeframes you have chosen? When you say mark out monthly, weekly, daily have you just looked and marked the most recent zone to avoid running against them? But once near the zones you go with them on 4hr?

4) Do you mind showing/sharing with us how you do your top down analysis, and what considerations you take in mind

I have learnt a lot, but just trying put the pieces together to write a IF/THEN trade plan with specific rules and forward test for a few months with a 500/1k account (real money instead of demo, to get emotions in check) before I put serious money on plate. Before people jump on the band wagon on me blowing up my account I have rules around money management that wont allow me to

Many thanks

1: As a rule I try not to go lower than 4hr for my trading now, the only reason I would go lower is to spot and mark a zone I cannot clearly make out on the 4hr.

2: To me ALL ZONES are valid, even counter-trend, albeit for less pips and a smaller TP. IF however as you mentioned zones are taking out opposing zones, then yes I will add more weight to that zone.

3: End of every month, week, day etc I check the corresponding chart and check exactly where we are in the bigger picture, if we are sitting in a supply, I will add more weight to supply over demand etc and take any demand zones with caution until we have cleared that zone on the bigger timeframe.

4: Top down like I said, on a normal day in the middle of the month, considering in the monthly and weekly we are clear of zones, I will check the daily and see where we are, which way we are trending, then I will get down to the 4hr and trade all zones I find applicable.

Bear in mind with ALL the above, I am checking my news sites I have listed for any potential fuel to market moves, like the Canadian strength at the moment in their economy has led me to some fantastic trades this week buying CAD, and the opposite goes to AUD, with all the negative factors, and as you can guess my best trade has been shorting AUDCAD, as it continues to fall even now as we speak.

--- 帖子 #1456 ---
Thanks Dean. Appreaciate you taking the time to answer this, makes sense to me now.

--- 帖子 #1457 ---
Please when one start trading S&D how % accuracy

--- 帖子 #1458 ---
That question has no answer, I cannot gurantee anyone a % number first starting out, as everybody is totally different with different styles. However if you are just starting i'd say close to pot luck really, have you been trading Forex long with other systems/strategies?

--- 帖子 #1459 ---
Hi guys, I have been having a look over the internet for some supply and demand indicators to try and help new traders to this style of trading. I do stress though however, both these indicators don't mark all the zones, and some zones marked are incorrect, however it can pick out some lovely zones. So have a play around, place some fib retracements, see how they fall onto levels, have fun.

The first one "shved" looks pretty, tells you how many times a zone has been touched, whether it is fresh or not etc.

The second one "supdem" is one of the originals from the beginning of supply and demand trading and still stands the test of time today.

Hello deankenny21

Please make your valuable comment on this setups.

--- 帖子 #1462 ---
Hi Cerve, this is not fresh demand be aware, does not mean it won't work, just that not being fresh, its not as powerful, also look on the fib to the left, price has based here a few times and gone up, so this certainly is not the original demand.

--- 帖子 #1463 ---
Yesterday at 4:44pm I marked this Demand zone, on CADCHF, and also later talking about CAD strength in the economy at the moment, price has hit demand and instantly found buyers, we are now 20 pips into profit. So for those lurkers that took this trade, trade management is also key, either locking in profits or moving your SL to reduce your exposure.

--- 帖子 #1464 ---
Nice man!... do you front run your orders by couple of pips? Out of interest how many pairs do you trade, the ones you have chosen is it purely based on the spreads from your broker?

--- 帖子 #1465 ---
Hi Dean. Got run over by GBPUSD. I was shorting at 1.2461.  Did I do anything wrong ? or is it just a losing trade that is part of trading ? I would really appreciate your comments on this.  Where would you put your stop loss on this trade ?  thanks in advance

--- 帖子 #1466 ---

I got blown out on that lower level too. Got in again short at 1.2490 with a stop at 1.2510. It doesn't appear to be in a big hurry to fall away.

--- 帖子 #1467 ---
ok guys, couple of things I need to stress, and I have mentioned it ALOT over the past couple days, so I am not angry don't think that, just dissapointed at these GBPUSD scenarios. The UK has had red news today and it came out ABOVE expectations, did you know that? I kept saying I had an order to sell cable BUT I will be closely watching news too quite a few times.

Also your zone is wrong, I shown my chart a couple days ago with the zone marked out. With the positive news this morning for the UK, I had to make a decision about my order for cable. Sometimes I erase the order completely, sometimes as I did today, I halfed my risk, so I edited my trade to half the lots I originally planned on going into it with. This is called risk assesment, and that was what I believe a correct assesment of risk vs the UK news and economy from today.

With that out the way here is cable, unchanged from my posting the other day of this chart, with supply and the fibonacci, price has stalled at the 50 fib and found some sellers within the supply as we can see. With the good news today for the UK, price could break supply, but as I said with my risk assesment and halfing of my risk it is no issue to me as I have applied the appropriate risk I believe to the risk of this supply.

So I stress once more, bookmark news sites, always refresh as much as possible, read every single briefing.

But as far as my trade is going on GBPUSD it is currently active and fully within limits, and finding sellers at the 50 fib.

My sell placement and stop loss has not moved since my posting on this the other day.

--- 帖子 #1468 ---
Now an update on CADCHF, and I said if you been reading the news you should know all about the CAD and it's strength at the moment, so this one is alot more plain sailing. Hopefully you guys have moved stop losses to reduce risk by now at least. Of course our first target is always the opposite end which would be supply so at the start of the fib drawing here would be our first targets.

You have a couple options at this point, you could take half off as profits, put SL at BE or positive and let the trade run, or you could close out for full profits at a good 1:3 risk reward ratio, 3 times the reward vs risk. I know 2guys on this trade who have pmmed me off the zone I marked here yesterday, but instead of replying to individual seperately I prefer to post publicly and let everyone get a chance of managing the trade.

I don't want this thread just turning into a signal service, where people just take the trades I keep marking out and posting. So I do urge any lurkers to please make a post. Some questions you have, or some advice I can give on your current analysis. After all if you learn how to trade like this, wouldn't it be much better to make these profits yourselves rather than relying on myself.

--- 帖子 #1469 ---
First of all thanks for your insight. I actually watched the news but I didn't think it was outstanding news. 2.3 % vs 2.2 forecast. Having said that, my Fibonacci levels were wrong. I didn't include the high of 3/27.

--- 帖子 #1470 ---
And that is exactly why I only halfed my risk, rather than deleting the order completely

I am surprised you can see price going on at all with the mess on your chart  Don't fret however, my charts used to also be as messy as that in my early days. When you realise less is more, and it all comes to you, it's a great feeling.

--- 帖子 #1471 ---
Here is a nice "fresh" supply formed on the EURJPY

--- 帖子 #1472 ---
CADJPY finding buyers at the demand, supply sits within the 50 fib as 61.8 as backup.

--- 帖子 #1473 ---
I reckon we'll see a nice reaction on the supply above if it reaches eventually. Its not original.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

If you want to be more conservative on your entries drop to lower time frame and look for price action/bar by bar analysis.

For example of you have a zone on 4HR, when price enters the zone go down to 15min and look for certain price action for reversals.

For any looking at CAD trades, please be aware of the BOC interest rate decision tomorrow.

Fresh "daily" demand here on AUDNZD, beware however of AUD news and stories.

--- 帖子 #1476 ---
One thing I do want to mention to new guys to the forex world too, is that we are in a shortened Holiday week with Good Friday and Easter Monday, so alot of assets will be risk-off and moved to safe havens such as the Japanese Yen and Gold.

--- 帖子 #1477 ---
This USDCAD 4HR supply is just under the daily supply in the big yellow zone. Might be one to watch tomorrow... with a bit of caution. It's a fresh zone but not original.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

What are your thoughts Dean? 78.6 and 88.6 running along the zone too.

--- 帖子 #1478 ---
This is how I have USDCAD supply at the moment.

--- 帖子 #1479 ---
Cool thanks... How would you trade the two most recent zones as they are so close together? Would you put both orders in?

Sorry.. I have too many questions, let me know if I am starting to become a pest haha

In one of your old post, you shared an article saying the quicker price comes back to the zone the higher the chances vs when price been away from zone for too long. As, if banks didn't get all orders filled at the zone they would not wait so long to put there orders in again. Would you say the top two zones been away from zone too long, or reckon there will still be some reaction?

Many thanks

--- 帖子 #1480 ---
The closest supply is already been used 3 times, so I wouldn't like that area at all.the second area is a little more interesting. The area at the top is at an extreme so there will be sell orders there regardless of time away, but the second area I would like price to return sooner than later yes.

--- 帖子 #1481 ---
I am back to my computer after a long day of work.

The current geopolitical instability is going to intensify the movement to the safe heavens as well (the conflict of USA with Russia and North Korea and also the latest pools in the upcoming French election), we have seen that today on the USD/JPY.

I got F*****, I was thinking that the USD/JPY low would hold a bit better and that I could get some pips from the pull back. It never happen and it went through it like a lead balloon.

I hope that would teach me. I need to be more aware of the news

Mind sharing which zone you were talking about? Your last post was on USDCAD

--- 帖子 #1485 ---
Hi guys It seems the AUD/NZD is getting into a supply area.

The only concern is that is not a fresh supply but the AUD is currently weak and under-performing vs other currencies.

--- 帖子 #1486 ---
GBPUSD Update: I am out for a small half risk loss. Some more good news today for UK was the final bullet, good analysis only going in at half risk.

CADCHF: I am now fully out this trade with all TP taken, just over 3 to 1 reward to risk, very pleased with this one.

Overall very good trading day, I risked 0.12% on the GBPUSD trade and 0.25% on the CADCHF trade, I made +0.81% on the Cadchf and with the loser thats +0.69% overall. See how important risk management is and money management, just as important as trading itself.

--- 帖子 #1487 ---
Hello DeanKenny,

It's with an immense great pleasure I see you are back! I had been watching this thread regularly with the hope it would revive! There is still so much to learn and share about sup/dem method...

After reading your thread in 10/2016 I started my sup/dem journey and have never looked back since. In those 6 months I took 75 trades with a 68% win ratio, totaling a 27% gain in my portfolio. Worst DD on weekly basis was -2%, monthly -5% (march, bad month for sup dem, low volatility!) RR: always 1:1 but I also keep track of other entry methods (eg 50% of the zone BL ea) and TP methods (eg 1:2 RR being 1 of them). For me the best results are still coming from RR 1:1 with a 1% risk at the moment on each trade, but I am looking to add an entry method with a RR of 1:2 of 1:3 with maybe lesser Win ratio but it will allow me to hit big winners once in a while...

Tonight I will start posting trades and trade opportunities of mine. I am so happy I will finally be able to share!

BTW: beautiful trade on the CADCHF! There is no better feeling when you see price only touching your zone to then rebounce strongly in the opposite direction :-)

Edensgarden

--- 帖子 #1488 ---
That was an amazing trade.

I got stopped out with a small profit. I still have a lot to learn.

Thanks for your advice

--- 帖子 #1489 ---
Hi Edensgarden, and very big welcome, so happy to hear about your great success from Supply and demand. Even happier to see that you have you psycology in check with 68% win ratio you obviously have some losers, but looks like this does not phase you and you get on with the task at hand and the next possible setup. You've made my day on what has been a very quiet day in the markets thank you  Very much looking forward to your charts and analysis.

Hi Cerve, as I always say, profit is profit, and something I was told when I was young small+small=big

Always keep a record of your trades and look back at how different you could've handled it, I put my stops at BE, and had a solid TP at the beginning of the down move, we had a very small retrace, so does make me wonder where you moved your SL to come out with a small profit  Either way, good job  and keep it up.

--- 帖子 #1490 ---
Thanks for the feedback.

I am going in with the GBP/USD. I think it is a good opportunity, it seems overpriced and there is a big supply to hold the upside move.

This time I am going to double the size of the position and have 2 different target, 1 small (to cover loses) and another a bit more ambitious.

There is no significant Fib level because we are at the top.

--- 帖子 #1491 ---
If you are in this eurcad off the daily demand + 61.8 fib we are over 70 pips up right now, stops to BE or +20-30 and aiming for full TP at the 4hr supply just above.

--- 帖子 #1492 ---
Missed my entry on demand here by 15 or so pips. Watching closely.

--- 帖子 #1493 ---
Dean.  You make it look so simple...quite unbelievable

--- 帖子 #1494 ---
Answer to a question in PM

"Hi Dean Kenny, thanks so much for that CADCHF trade, I have not taken any profits yet and unsure what to do. I see you have now taken full profits, can you tell me why you are not aiming any higher"

I would prefer to answer this publicly as to not only help the PM but also all those that are following. If we move up to daily on the CADCHF we have entered a "DAILY" supply. Which I am not going to war against, so 3:1 trade will do me just fine  Always remember to check the bigger picture.

--- 帖子 #1495 ---
IT truly honestly is, I am a bad teacher unfortunately  Hence why I can probably trade haha. But honestly spotting zones and taking the fib confluence is alot simpler than all these charts that look like christmas trees with 100 indicators waiting to all line up at once. Hence why I like to post my charts before zones are met and then post the updates, to show that it is truly that easy. What isn't easy though as we have seen past couple pages, is trade management and psycology once in the trade. That's what seems to make or break a profitable to unprofitable trader.

As of now, 78 Traders viewing. C'mon guys, I really don't want to be just a signal service, lets get some posts, questions, charts etc

Waiting for the right price action on 15min to enter this based on my analysis yesterday. Cerve has noticed it too

This supply may fail due to the bullish engulf heading to the zone... just a warning

--- 帖子 #1497 ---
You made my day too!

I've attached a Daily chart of AUD CHF on which I took the SL last week (to the pip) and took a BL last friday, closed yesterday at BE 'cause is taking to long.

Another one is the GBPCHF I took last week, also on Daily, see supply zone.

Last one is AUD CAD 4H, taken last week on a 4H chart this time/

I am looking at:

AUD CAD 8H opp (I like it when price tends to be in balance red/blue/red/blue and then suddenly break out! Those are the best zones)

EURUSD DAILY opp: easy to spot, you only need to watch for the strong moves away from a zone that give you something that is not in proportion with the other candels

USDJPY WEEKLY OPP: this is LT but the order is there and going to stay there until zone is hit :-D

USDCAD DAIL OPP: zone was hit before, but being a big one I tried an entry at 30% retrace, did not make it :-) but will try again if it moves back up (with the trend, big supply zone on all the Time frames)

I will post regularly what I see and what happens to my trades ;-) Most of the zones are identified on sunday afternoon!

Edensgarden

--- 帖子 #1498 ---
I don't think you're a bad teacher. In a week or so, I learned a lot from your charts. Can you comment on this chart ? bear with the indicators.  Are the sup/dem levels OK ?

--- 帖子 #1499 ---
It's not so much the bullish candle that makes me see this trade differently, I don't care for candle patterns, end of the day it's supply and demand that causes these candles, pinbars are usually caused by price hitting a supply and reversing making a pinbar, then people short at the open of next candle. Thing is, I am already in the trade well above at a much better price as I KNEW where the supply was to create this pinbar.

Anyway, like I said, this is what's getting me a bit watchful at the moment.

--- 帖子 #1500 ---
The top supply should start from the body of the last Bullish candle, opposite applied for demand, should start from the last bearish candle before the surge in price. The bottom zone should also finish at the wick of the candle not the body.

--- 帖子 #1501 ---
Your insights are priceless, thanks for the response

--- 帖子 #1502 ---
I place GBP USD 4H SL

--- 帖子 #1503 ---
Yes that is a decently placed supply, there is also a smaller supply slightly below it to, a rally-base-drop supply. Which is where price has halted for now as it's found a defence of sellers, but with Trump speaking at the mo, how that defence holds up is questionable.

--- 帖子 #1504 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

We are in Asian session now, and they have yet to react to Trumps comments on the USD being "too strong" so this trade I have not taken. Remember it's all good and well looking at the news calender here at FF, but if that's all you look at regarding news, all USD bulls would be getting their ass kicked right now. So like I said bookmark news sites such as

GREAT Stuff Dean Kenny.. so much to learn here..Thank..You

WAVE CREATION, WHY FOREX MOVES LIKE THE WAY IT DOES, ELLIOT WAVES

Elliot waves and such are made by supply and demand, infact anything and everything in the markets is made by s and d, chart patterns, candlestick formations, waves etc you name it supply and demand made it. So ask yourself this question, "What method would you most like to put time into and study" Why study formations, elliot waves and such, when you can study what's making ALL OF THIS HAPPEN.

Here is a live chart of GBPAUD, both supply and demand working beautifully in unison making these moves and patterns occur, price come off supply, down to demand and has found buyers and is moving up again, it really is not that hard

I assure you guys, learning supply and demand will be the best thing in your life. When you can turn around to a candlestick pattern trader who waits for pinbars and say "well I am already in the move, as I can see before the fact, of when this pinbar was going to occur"

--- 帖子 #1507 ---
HOW YOU WILL ALWAYS BE ONE STEP AHEAD LEARNING SUPPLY AND DEMAND

With all these examples and teachings I make, I will always use a "LIVE" chart. Not a chart picked out from history.

So I bet many of you guys/gals here will have seen a method or teaching using candlestick formations/patterns. Waiting for price to hit support or resistence creating a pinbar for confirmation then clicking buy/sell.

Now please see the chart below, we see the red line, which most teaching would say is resistence now turned to support. As price goes back down to this line we can see a lovely demand level, we know buy orders are sitting there in some quantity, small or large we don't know, but we know for a fact as S and D traders that here buy orders reside. Now as a supply and demand trader we would buy here and enter a long trade. For most other traders they would see this pinbar/hammer form and get in the trade much much later, infact over 30 pips later!!!!!! currently the supply and demand trader would be 50 pips in profit, while the candlestick trader would be alot less in profit and probably not close to a position to move sl or take profits. At 50 pips us supply and demand traders have at least already moved our SL to breakeven and now we have a "RISK FREE" trade.

Go and look for yourself, go away now and look at your charts, look for these candlestick formations, then look left, I assure you this will really open your eyes

--- 帖子 #1508 ---
Hi Dean good last chart, thanks. The 4hr demand zone is quite wide, is there a way to get a better entry off the 4hr chart so that you can reduce your sl ?

--- 帖子 #1509 ---
hey dean, why not open a demo trade explorer, this way it will be easier to follow your live trades

--- 帖子 #1510 ---
Hi Metta, because as I've said many times, I do not want this becoming a signal service, the last time I had a trade explorer up, there was alot less activity in the thread and people just simply copy pasted trades straight from my trade explorer.

As you said with your quote

"it will be easier to follow your live trades"

Brings me to believe my biggest fear that alot are here to just mirror my trades rather than learn the princibles behind the trades.

--- 帖子 #1511 ---
Thanks for your precious word & really happy to see you back to FF again .. yeah learning suppy & demand is the best way to read the chart  IMO.

--- 帖子 #1512 ---
Hello Dean,

I mentioned the Daily Aud Chf trade I closed off at BE, today AUD broke higher in a BIG way and took Aud CHF with it...now it breaks my heart to see this would have been a beautiful trade!!

On the screenshot below you can see price bounced of beautifully on the top of the daily demand zone, you could even have zoomed into the 8H or 4H time frame to take a better RR trade.

My question is: how can I determine if I should close a trade prematurely? Should I count the candles or rather the number of closes inside the zones? From my experience I noticed that if a zone is really strong it will bounce off immediately, trades that tend to linger in the zone have a lesser chance of touching the TP.

Thx for the feed-back;

Edensgarden

PS: I think I answered my own question! After seeing priced bounced off the 8H and 4H demand zones I should've kept confidence that the trade was still well on track and ready to break higher, valuable lesson for me...

hey Dean i get your point, but you can hide all the info you want on the explorer(while taking trades ) and still teach here on the thread. I think if people see the results on the t.e coupled with the information being taught here, there wont be any reason for them not learning the principles behind your thread.Thanks.

--- 帖子 #1515 ---
Hi guys.

this is more like a general question to everybody really.

Easter is coming and the markets are going to close for a bit of time. Are you thinking on closing the positions in case the market bounce, or do you prefer to leave them open during the weekend.

Bear in mind that the markets would probably change during the weekend but we would not know until Monday.

Hi, no one has a gun to anyones head, and I have already done the TE stuff, and it was an absolute nightmare. If it's proof anybody wants, I think my 100s of livestreams and twitter account are slightly better than any TE, infact whole point I did the livestreams was to show how floored TE's can be. On that note, I wouldn't need to "prove" anything anyway, since I am not trying to sell anything, so it's no skin off my nose. You want to learn supply and demand stick around and learn, if you don't, the door is open

--- 帖子 #1517 ---
Anyway back to proper business. I guess ALOT of you are in this cable trade with me, I have posted my chart on cable many times for the last week or so, so absolutely no excuse not to be. After our first supply got broken with the UK news, then Trumps words yesterday, we see the Extrmina supply come into force. We are now 57 pips in profit on this one, so we have just surpassed the 1:1 RR of the trade. All my stops are now at BE for this trade aiming for TP at 1.2495 at the demand we are heading towards. 1.25 for a conservative target if you please.

--- 帖子 #1518 ---
Hi Dean,

Thanks for taking the time to share all this, I'm taking my time reading thoroughly through everything, making notes etc. Still a bit new to trading but have always been interested in trading without indicators. As the saying goes if you want something done right you gotta do it yourself  if you were planning on doing any webinars again I'd definitely be game.

--- 帖子 #1519 ---
Yes, I was planning to do one this Sunday evening, having a look at the week ahead, marking up potential trades etc. But then realised it's easter weekend and probably not the best week to get this started. So I am looking at starting one the week after, and see where we go from there regarding interest etc.

thanks Dean, where can i find your 100 livestream and your twitter account please cause I definitely want to learn sup-dem. Many systems are shared here on ff and learning them takes time, so when trading history is shared ( live trades real or demo ) its easier to see if there is merit to the system or its just a time waster. Thats why i asked for yours( especially when i saw you showed a screenshot of one of your accounts the other day ) but its okay if you dont want to again, they say a close mouth dont get fed so i had to ask for it. Take care and good trading.

Deankenny, I just joined and have been reading the posts from the start but I think I am missing your actual system.  I get the gist of it but without the actual rules, I am in the dark.

--- 帖子 #1536 ---
For those that have re-entered EURCAD off this lovely demand here that I makred 2 days ago!, not quite made it to opposite supply, but being good Friday, and another bank Holiday on Monday is a good idea now to book some profits or at least lock the trade in with SL movement into positive.

Hi fellow traders. I expose you this AUDCAD dilemma.

What would you do, sell at SZ or buy at DZ?

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1538 ---
Answer me this, are you closer to Weekly supply or Weekly demand?

--- 帖子 #1539 ---
Wouldn't you sell or buy at whichever supply/demand zone you are closest to, irrespective of whether it's a weekly or daily level?

--- 帖子 #1540 ---
Remember when price is heading towards a zone, it's heading there for a reason. Price manipulation by whoevers interest it is for price to reach supply, for their unfilled order and so on, so when price is heading towards supply, think about it logically, why is price going this way? why does it stop in supply, or meet a defence to go any further?

Asking yourself these questions, you start to realise how the markets work, and why price heads towards some zones like magnets and steers away very sharply once hit, its not rocket science

Guys, I must stress I am an AWFUL teacher, so apologies if my teachings don't come across very easy to follow

Remember I make a living from trading, so I don't need to teach for subscribtions or money, if I did, I would certainly need to be a better teacher, but then If i was a good teacher, it's very likely I would not be a very good trader

I will keep an eye.

i am away guys but I saw this 3 hours ago and I am sending you a quick picture from the phone. It might be too late now but it worth keeping an eye.

The picks are from the app so don't expect perfect levels

is anyone in the GBPUSD trade once again?

One of the very first charts I marked on my return

--- 帖子 #1553 ---
No worries, just trying to pick yours and others brains to learn of ... Yep I noticed a few, thought I'd check to see if you guys would still consider placing a trade on non fresh zones. I guess it depends on experience and confidence. I think I will stick to fresh and orignal zones while starting out!

I closed my trades before the weekend but I reopened the gbp/usd 4 hours ago. Now it is on profit but I do not expect a important reaction because the area has been tested so many times. I don't think there is much supply left over there.

i will keep the SL trailing the price.

Hi

Which sequences of time frames are you trading?

I have a day job so I can trade only W/D/4H.

Happy to see another S&D thread here on FF.

Keep up the good work.

Cheers

--- 帖子 #1557 ---
Hi Merka.

Welcome. I am starting to trade and I have a full time job. So I see the market in the computer in the morning an evening, and monitor the trades and the news releases with the phone on my breaks.

I trade 4H but I keep an eye on daily and weekly for important areas and the hourly to be more accurate with the entries, SL and Take profit.

But as I said 4h seems perfect because you can check it before and after work.

i hope this is helpfull.

Regards

Nice One Dean,

update on my GBP/NZD trade

--- 帖子 #1561 ---
Now for those that joined me on this AUDCAD trade, now is the time you can think about moving stop loss, maybe take some profits off the table and leave some in to run, there are multiple ways you can play this now, entirely up to you, there is no 100% right way to play it, enjoy. And remember, those traders trading price action sold the pinbar, us supply and demand traders got a MUCH BETTER price and well into profits already  Supply and demand rules over all.

Warning to those in AUDCAD: We have Monetary Policy Meeting at 2:30am UK TIME. We are over 1:1 risk reward just before the meeting, so conservative traders may take all profits now if you wish to.

--- 帖子 #1562 ---
Excellent job my man, just what I like to see, I have not put that pair up at all, so you did it all on your own, good job. I have had 3 trades today, and I only posted this AUDCAD one, reason being is like I said, I don't want to be a signal service, I know many probably jumped on the AUDCAD when I posted my entry, but must be someone who has some input, I could make a fortune as a signal provider, but I don't want to, because I make money from trading, so I don't need to sell myself, and don't mind sharing for free just as long as we get some constructive input

--- 帖子 #1563 ---
Yes, Dean, you are a valuable asset to this thread, and you are doing a great job, no one does what you are doing, teaching people how to fish not just handing it out.  its sad to see some people want the easy way out, but i have learned so much from your thread, i have been following you since 2011, and have struggled a lot but kept at it, and now the supply and demand trading has taught me a skill for life i can now  make money, from anywhere in the world and without worrying about depending on a job

Thanx to you may man, i hope you don't mind i f share my setups on your thread, to help other people who are willing to learn

cheers

keep up the good work

--- 帖子 #1564 ---
Thank you Cashforex, I am so glad that I have reached out to someone, and even happier for the fact that your trading has come a long way since learning about supply and demand. As for sharing setups, by god of course, yes please, that's what I want to see, go for it.

Hi Dean and guys !!! Thx for your efforts. Glad to find this to support my PA style.

Is this a good place to start or I have to read something before read the full thread ? Will take me a while but I´ll do before start asking like a dull :-)

Indeed. I see the Pound heading towards 1.28 in the coming days (altough I must say I don't trade the H4 charts).

@Deankenny21 Are you using volumes in the decisional process to take a trade?

What's your input on the pair now? It seems pretty messy at the moment.

gold looking for a long

--- 帖子 #1574 ---
Hello All,

AFter a long WK, back at FX again.

I am looking at a AUD NZD BL opportunity on the daily chart (same as Dean's) - BL not yet placed

Also I shorted EUR USD on the 8H, was in profit but price has retraced at the moment.

Br,

Edensgarden

--- 帖子 #1575 ---
GBP/AUD have reached monthly supply so look for short setups on the lower time frames

--- 帖子 #1576 ---
These are 2 other trades with price close to entry price

AUDCAD 8H unfortunately missed the entry by a few pips, if price does not get up there again quickly I think to close this SL

NZDJPY Daily SL, is looking goof to hit the price soon!

--- 帖子 #1577 ---
Hello Cashforex

I also had a SL marked on this pair, Daily, red box, but price missed it by just a few pips before crashing lower

Now price is heading into some weekly and monthly supply zones (black box), but for me the best opp is already behind us

--- 帖子 #1578 ---
What do you guys think of this supply zone (black box) on EURCAD DAILY SL 1.4305/stop 1.4356/TP 51 pips for me, otherwise maybe the next demand zone at 1.4150?

Confluence on this one: at the 50% FIB retrace + with the LT downtrend

--- 帖子 #1579 ---
Sometimes it feels too easy!! Supply and demand, god I just love it!! HAd this as a buy limit and woke up to this

--- 帖子 #1580 ---
Hi Minsod, this was the original supply which you should have taken on the trade pls refer to pic, as you can see the supply area you marked those orders have been filled from previous supply and its not a fresh zone have a look to the left

--- 帖子 #1581 ---
Yes dean had the same trade as well, doesn't get any better then this

--- 帖子 #1582 ---
Hi Minsod, bro can i ask as to why are you shorting EUR, when the EUR long term Trend is up

--- 帖子 #1583 ---
Am looking at these zones, upper one from daily, what do you guys think ?

--- 帖子 #1584 ---
Nice level Rioja, good job, we know that's a fresh level as its just broken through demand, so it's turned demand into "NEW" supply, and on the 61.8 fib too, nicely spotted, keep your eye on news appraching the level, and remember. WE ARE LOOKING FOR AN INITIAL REACTION NOT A SWING POINT AT THE LEVEL.

Please remember that traders, we are looking for an initial reaction to move stops to BE at least, then hope the sellers are strong enough to take us for a ride. Never ever just expect price to fly off from a zone, the market is alot bigger than us, we know for sure sellers are sat there, but we don't know how many or at what size, but 99% of the time there will always be some reaction at a level, most the time enough to lock in profits or move stop to BE thus reducing your risk.

--- 帖子 #1585 ---
Are these zones OK ? Please don´t pay attention to the red doted lines :-)

--- 帖子 #1586 ---
Hello, EUR USD upmove surprised me, I shorted EUR USD on 8H an almost hit TP before it turned and hit STOP, too bad I DID NOT move the STOP to lock in profits like I should've!

EUR CAD SL got not chance at all, maybe now it's in an uptrend, but if you look at LT trend it's still down for me

--- 帖子 #1587 ---
Anyone trading after Mays speech and the moves we seen in the last few hours, should take a step back.

Let it settle, don't try get in the way of all that, as much as a good trader as one can be, not even myself takes on that.

GBPUSD Weekly fresh supply held like a brick wall if anyone does position trading...

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1589 ---
Completely true! Unfortunately I had a day off today and took the opportunity to place that EUR CAD trade without paying too much attention to May's speech, in Belgium this is minor news, even if forexlive covered it extensively...good lesson, this GBP news was bound to impact the EUR in a way or another and create a tsunami of orders that make the exercise of zone placing futile

--- 帖子 #1590 ---
Indeed TUK, quite a number of sellers at 1.29 as we can see clearly being supply and demand traders. IS it enough to push it back down into the lower range, we shall see, but anyone trading from the weekly, we have had the reaction, remember thats what we look for, react from the reaction, then ride it if it moves down, if not the reactin you made at reaction will cut losses very much short.

--- 帖子 #1591 ---
@ Dean, do you make a difference between NY closing charts and others? I noticed some of the charts here don't match mine, NY closing charts.

Br,

Edensgarden

--- 帖子 #1592 ---
Dean, do you have a specific set number of pips/down movement when looking for reaction? At what point would you move stop loss?

--- 帖子 #1593 ---
WHat do you guys think of these 2 zones on the Daily, they are correlated zones and formed at the same time

--- 帖子 #1594 ---
I got that EURUSD marked down too on the daily

--- 帖子 #1595 ---
Sorry, I'm very new to this..

reading this and I still don't quite understand

is this supply demand zone correct? are there any zone nearby that i missed?

I wanna learn the correct zone first

I tend to look at lower time frame

CAD/CHF Short set up

--- 帖子 #1597 ---
I posted this chart yesterday and had a nice succesful trade all closed and profits gained. Whoever has entered on the second touch, you are very much in healthy profit right now, if you have not already, at least move your SL to breakeven, final target is really up to you, could be the last swing low where my original TP was taken, the opposite supply level etc, there is no 100% correct way, the main rule is getting your risk reduced, that should be your priority.

--- 帖子 #1598 ---
Nice one, I have this one on the 8H SL not triggered yet. Would it still be valid since the 4H was tested twice now?

--- 帖子 #1599 ---
Missed the AUDNZD Daily BL by a few pips...the difference between a good and bad week is often very small!

OK, I have another trade on the AUDNZD Daily, SL red box, valid zone?

Hey guys,

I've been trading S/D for a little bit, but I just discovered this thread and I like the idea of mixing Fibs to S/D to get a very powerful tool.

I just entered this Gold long on the 4h and I was wondering what you guys thought about it. (I just moved SL to BE).

Thank you for all your help.

--- 帖子 #1610 ---
Absolutely beautiful trade, and to add to my happiness, you have reduced your risk and moved your SL, absolutely what I like to see, big thumbs up

--- 帖子 #1611 ---
I like these levels of demand turning into supply, as we know for sure 100% that this is always a "FRESH" level, as fresh as it can get.

Unfortunately been away from my monitors today visiting my dad in hospital

But, it's excellent to come back to all these charts, and trades you guys have been doing for yourself, absolutely fantastic.

--- 帖子 #1612 ---
Thank you guys for your replies.

I like the idea of moving my SL faster to BE.

I'm wondering, in the case where price would come back to hit SL, but not by much, do you let the trade go or you get back in?

Also, Dean, great thread! I'm working my way through it to make sure I'm up to date.

--- 帖子 #1613 ---
Hi guys.

I spotted this area on the daily chart. The price seems to be reacting to it. Be aware that the area has been tested several times in the Past but it had a very strong reaction.

Hi guys, i am new here. And need a lot of things to learn.

Here is my first chart. What do you guys think of the SnD zone?

Also, Dean, great thread! Thank you..

--- 帖子 #1616 ---
Guys please i like to stress, that before marking your S/D be mindful of the longer time frame as to where the price is, otherwise marking S/D on smaller time frame you will get the price just shoot through the zone, i think Dean would agree with me on this one, thats the key to trading S/D succesfully

HI Geerson, in regards to your Question the GBP/USD currently favours the uptrend, please look the longer term trend then reconsider your S/D, plus your Supply you marked its to noisey, you might want to look at the 38.8 supply you might get an reaction hope that helps

Hello, I posted this one yesterday...in the end the entry was hit during the night, TP just hit! see pic below.

--- 帖子 #1625 ---
OK, nice one!

--- 帖子 #1626 ---
Why do you have 0 at the starting point and 100 at the end? No real difference, but still, I was confused

--- 帖子 #1627 ---
I posted this zone on the 11th April, 9 days ago  We went quite deep, but we are finding sellers in there. Reason for deep entry is probably due to the policy commentary.

EDIT: I am now out of this trade.

--- 帖子 #1628 ---
Further to my EURJPY, here is the perfect time to show you guys the easiest way to spot a nice new fresh level, we see this supply has failed, HOWEVER, with this we can see a nice brand new FRESH demand level, we know this is fresh because it was supply that was in control here not demand, so if demand is now in control at this price, then it must be fresh.

EUR/CAD Dean hope you got this one bro, i missed it aaaarrgh !!!!!

--- 帖子 #1643 ---
Hi cashforex,

Any reason the zone just below it was not a zone for you? the drop base drop zone that failed.

--- 帖子 #1644 ---
I had that one on my watchlist to monitor it closely, but i missed it, I was not at the computer.

The previous zone it was very good, you can see how the price reacts to it and slow down. The problem is that it went through all the supply until the next one.

I am still learning but one of the things that I learned form my mistakes is wait for the price to show you what is going to do. If the price is moving sharply (every single candle is bullish) it is likely to eat through the supply (or demand on the other case), but if it is slowing and giving consolidations, it is more likely to reverse.

Trying to get into the previous supply it would be like catching a falling knife.

Sometimes i prefer to wait and see what the price has to say.

--- 帖子 #1645 ---
I left this trade a while ago.

I just closed it today because I wanted to be conservative, but it did a very nice move.

--- 帖子 #1649 ---
Hey guys,

I currently am in the EURCAD short, almost missed it! Here's my reasoning on why I took this zone and not the first one.

First of all the 2 nd zone was inside a Daily supply zone (a good +)

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

On the 4h, the price actually based right under the 1st Zone, making it less interesting and eating up the profit.

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Hopefully this makes sense and it helps!

I'm safe on this trade (BE) but I'm trying to let it run for a bit.

--- 帖子 #1650 ---
It is true, it got rejected on the second supply.

It should have a reaction to it, but as you said, not very strong, so caution would be the key here.

--- 帖子 #1651 ---
Nice Article Dean. Bold in it's statements, but it does make sense though.

--- 帖子 #1652 ---
Now I feel the best time to up our game for the newbies here now we have some very active members. Multi time frame analysis. If we look on the weekly we are right down near the weekly demand zone, now ask yourself this question, would you really be wanting to sell off supply levels when we are close to weekly demand. You see those levels that get shot right through, no matter how perfect it lined up, well that's probably because you have neglected to take the bigger picture into consideration.

Now my first chart is weekly, placing a fib on the most recent upmove, the demand falls right onto the 50 retrace, price has already entered weekly demand and found buyers. So what we do now is go down some to a smaller timeframe to see if we can join the ride up. The 2 hour chart shows a lovely demand which was formed at the top of the weekly zone, this level would most probably be a very nice level to go long if we go back down there with what looks like to be an excellent risk reward. If we don't go down that low, I will be looking for more demands forming and marking them for possible trades to enter. All of course while keeping an eye on the fundamentals.

Hi guys,

It is me again posting a couple of pictures and analysis.

we can see that the pair is on a tight range on the weekly chart.

And it is currently on a 4 hour and daily supply on top.

--- 帖子 #1656 ---
Hey Cerve,

from my perspective on the USD/CAD if you look at the monthly we are still pretty far away from supply, please see below and then we drop down to the weekly, wait for the weekly support to be broken then i would consider taking a trade probably might look for some long as monthly supply is still far away but thats being aggressive,  hope that helps

--- 帖子 #1657 ---
Thank you for the feedback. I do really appreciate it. I did not checked the monthly timeframe.

--- 帖子 #1658 ---
Had broker problems, so not been posting anything....

I only look at daily entry due to work, but this looks like a good zone on AUDCHF, original and fresh zone, just above weekly demand.

How about this?

I am just a newbie

what method are you trading, your chart is too confusing for me to analyse, what are you asking help with please be specific

--- 帖子 #1661 ---
Nice level here. What say you Dean?

--- 帖子 #1662 ---
I would say the level is not clean enough, try to see if it's also good on a higher timeframe like 8H or Daily, weekly.

Br,

Edensgarden

--- 帖子 #1663 ---
I would totally trade that that level.

Care to explain why you don't think it's good enough?

--- 帖子 #1664 ---
It also lines up beautifully with the 61% fib.

--- 帖子 #1665 ---
Hey Dean,

You planning to do any live streaming soon?

--- 帖子 #1666 ---
This level does not stand out enough, when i see a supply level I want it to have a big bearish engulfing to start with, I want it to move away quickly from the level, I want some previous stability before moving away (this way i know the buyers were surprised and are stuck in their positions) and I want the supply level to preferably cover all the highs.

--- 帖子 #1667 ---
This is a huge decision point for GBPUSD, bulls are very strong, weekly supply has been entered.

--- 帖子 #1668 ---
As we are in the weekend I feel like showing how my setup has changed from the very first year I started forex to my system now. I used to have a 4 monitor setup, but found myself never using more than 2 monitors, so I kept it simple, but powerful.

First pic Is what I started trading forex on, as you can see with Oanda loaded up, and second is my workstation as it stands today.

--- 帖子 #1669 ---
So, is it the right time to place some short orders? Or we have to wait the next price movement?..

Ty Dean..

--- 帖子 #1670 ---
nice set up bro, im looking to get three monitors myself

--- 帖子 #1671 ---
I don't want to make it to obvious as I would like people to learn in here aswell as me showing levels. But i would be more focused on the JPY crosses this week, if you look carefully and also look at the fundamentals there is some serious pips to be made this week on JPY.

I'd focus more on that that the GBPUSD at the moment, with Brexit, a new general election, euro uncertainty etc, it's really one I'm looking to avoid at the moment.

--- 帖子 #1672 ---
How do you truly know there is either Supply or Demand at any "level"?

--- 帖子 #1673 ---
gbp/chf long check it out, deano is right need to look at the GBP because of thr brixit

--- 帖子 #1674 ---
the optimal entry should have been at 1.2846 i got in a bit late lets see how v go

--- 帖子 #1675 ---
Please try to read the thread to get questions like these answered.

As said before, no-one "truly" knows, but we can give ourselves a damn good indications looking at distribution, imbalance and acccumulation. These things together can only mean one things, if there is an imbalance at a lever of the market, then obviously bull/bear was stronger than the other, 9/10 if this is the case there will be unfilled orders.

Think about it - If you go to a club and theres 4 men to every 1 girl, not every man is going to pull are they. Now if these men stayed at the club, they are unfilled orders, when price (woman) come back to the market (club)

--- 帖子 #1676 ---
Nice to see you around Dean. I have never seen supply and demand that way but it is quite accurate if you compare it with a club.

It seems that the USD/JPY is consolidating on a supply zone on the daily chart.

It also seems to have very good R:R ratio.

hi dean & all,

what do think everybody of this one?

sell @ 4h supply

--- 帖子 #1678 ---
It is infact a very good supply, but as I keep stressing, keep your eye on fundamentals too. USD is on the brink of major weakness.

--- 帖子 #1679 ---
I'm seeing this supply zone as stronger, with high volume and resting on the 61% fib. There hasn't been sufficient reaction from this point in my view.

(Also a 125.000/113.000 Round number)

--- 帖子 #1680 ---
While looking at EURNZD I noticed a similar supply zone one the weekly

--- 帖子 #1681 ---
I am eying this one, but am not the best in trading continuation supply zones

The zone is the first black zone the price is going to meet

Update: it corresponds exactly with the 50% retrace, so maybe I'll take it

--- 帖子 #1682 ---
Certainly found some sellers at weekly supply, but fundamentals could make them weak.

I'm sidelining this one personally, if in doubt, just avoid.

Hi, Sam. I have the same Supply zone as yours. Let's hope we did the right decision.

Hi Guys my take on the AUD/USD like dean mention watch the news on the USD ifn you look at the AUD/USD its forming a Swap right at the supply i think it should go upward from here, but hey i might be wrong but that's how i see it

Be aware that is not a fresh demand zone, and a swing low/pivot low also. Please see the original zone, which infact was a reaction to the zone slightly below that. Always look left

--- 帖子 #1700 ---
I see now thank you for the heads up. Sorry i tried to add you on skype but no luck so far ....

--- 帖子 #1701 ---
Something to consider a nice 30 min supply zone, and to add more we had bearish engulfing pattern on daily tf

--- 帖子 #1702 ---
Add a fib to that

--- 帖子 #1703 ---
Those that have taken the weekly supply, you are around 50 pips up, well done.

Why don't you read through and have a look, i'll give you a headstart, 20th April was my last loss. EURJPY

--- 帖子 #1713 ---
Yes Cerve I taken that supply, you can see on my screenshot above, I have a sell from up there

--- 帖子 #1714 ---
my bad man. One last question, do you happen to spot those sup-dem zones also on renko ?

--- 帖子 #1715 ---
Do you mind sharing what is your usual % gain  pet month? Do you have a target or you get what the market gives? For example what was your % gain for March? Also if it is not a problem to share what %  of your account you use to enter a trade 2,3,4,5 %?

--- 帖子 #1716 ---
I don't use and never will use Renko.

--- 帖子 #1717 ---
I aim for about 5% per month. March I made 8.18% on my account.

For each trade I risk 0.25% of my "equity" not my balance.

--- 帖子 #1718 ---
never ?but arent sup-dem zones easily spotted on renko ?

--- 帖子 #1719 ---
Sorry I didn't see the pair of the trade, the chart looks completely different.

I hope I can trade like that one day.

It seems like a nice 1 to 3 R:R ratio. Amazing

Remember this setup from today? Price is doing what suppose to do....

Yes teodosy87, fantastic, hope some of you got in on this.

Nice thread DeanKenny,  I am also in a similar trade for the aussie.

--- 帖子 #1723 ---
No mate i marked it and bunch of others, in some I did in some didn't. I will upgrade my setup I need one more monitor to properly see what's going on with all of the pairs I follow. We had same level on eurnzd as well and price respected it same as this one.

--- 帖子 #1724 ---
Good job i was able to catch it at the start.

--- 帖子 #1725 ---
Nice one, i was suppose to get in around that area too but accidentally put the trade on the wrong account that's not funded :-(.   No matter there are always more trading opportunities around the corner.

--- 帖子 #1726 ---
Absolutely, patience is probably the one main thing that makes a great trader. Waiting price to come to you, and not chasing it around, this is what mist people that are losing doing and that is the main reason in my opinion. If you miss the opportunity look for another these days there is so much stuff that we can trade with patience and sound risk vs reward the sky is the limit.

--- 帖子 #1727 ---
nice! i was in too, but unfortunately my sl was to tight...i'm looking on daily, it could go lower

--- 帖子 #1728 ---
Yes I am looking at that as well we might have some pullbacks now ad we have some demand on h4 but still down is the way to go.

Aud/USD another one looking good

--- 帖子 #1732 ---
Hi! I'm new to supply and demand trading and found interest in trading supply demand system. I have been practicing trading for the past 5months. I'm faced with a minor setback which is when we doing analysis for H1 TF, do we look at the higher TF? If so, which TF higher should we look at? H4 and D1 is more than enough?

And if we are trading M5 TF, do we just look at M15 and M30 TF?

Thank you!

Supply zone found for AUDUSD on H1 TF.

--- 帖子 #1733 ---
LOL ... I've never heard it out that way before.

In the meantime, I can understand the threads ... I just don't see where just because of a certain candlestick pattern there is a supply of unfilled orders -- long or short.  I have picked plenty of levels that weren't anything like a supply or

demand zone.

If you are saying that a combination of specific indicators can help them be "seen", that is different.

Is that what you are saying?

--- 帖子 #1734 ---
There is nonspecific tf to look at first start with bi gb ones depends on what do you trade swing or short term. Let say you are in trade trader I will start with daily and look for overall direction. I see many people try to pick where price will reverse and so not take all the easy levels that are with price. So this is no easy task it is reading the price.

--- 帖子 #1735 ---
One of many I am right now with some profit taken and risk to 0. I think that taking profit and moving stop loss to 0 is acting like a relief and you see the market as it is. Your emotions doesn't clutter your decision anymore. This way you will leave your profits run and get the maximum from every move not just a fraction.

--- 帖子 #1736 ---
And again letting winners run with risk 0 and profit already taken......

--- 帖子 #1737 ---
This one still going now i just have to manage it to take full profit. Risk to reward.... Is huge..

--- 帖子 #1738 ---
Thank you teodosy87 for explaining to me in details! I will continue to improve using your guidance as well as dean guidance.

--- 帖子 #1739 ---
For sure, I have one advice which is helping me a lot. If you want to really be successful don't follow other people. Learn the supply and demand and practice it as much as possible and you will become your best. Following other people in my experience is a waste of time and will make you think why the person does that or this, while you have to know what the market is doing. This is what you actually need. You will spent precious time doing the wrong thing, and forex will seems very hard because you will be trying to know others people methods and styles while everyone is different, even though we all have sl the same information we see things different from each other. This means you will not find your own way but try to adapt to someone else's. Go to tickmill.com website there is a section in there called promotion and you will find trade of the month. There real trader share their experience and you will see none of them were thaought by someone else they found their own way. Real traders, the big problem is many people pretend to be traders but they try to sell you something telling you how successful they are which in reality is not true. Most of them don't know anything, the real traders make money and don't share it everywhere trying to see you something. Which leads me to my point you have to know what is the real traders expirience that's why i always follow the interviews in tickmill website, they also show the person who is interviewed statement for the month, and you can see how they were trading, lot sizes stops everything. Wish you luck my friend.

Base on the supply zone above, would you guys trade the 2nd supply zone after it completed 1st supply zone? Because it seems to be forming a 2nd rally-base-drop so I am unsure if it can be consider as fresh supply zone. Any experience trader can share their knowledge? Thanks!

Interesting trade, you need balls of steel to trade the GBP AUD like that against the Short term trend and on the 1 hour with a tight stop!

I hope you hit tp 3R or that you took some profit off the table. Nice trade

Regarding the same pair I see a supply zone on the Daily, what you think? It's like standing in front of a high speed running freight train :-)

--- 帖子 #1765 ---
Hi guys.

Yesterday I entered this trade. A bit late but it seems is working nicely.

1H chart

--- 帖子 #1766 ---
I got stopped out for the GBPAUD though. Did not hit my TP. Haha.

It is a good supply zone imo too. It broke a number of previous supply zone already though. Rally-Base-Drop usually happens by standing in front of a high speed running freight train from what I see so far. Lol. For me, if it fulfill my rules and criterias, I will just take the trade and not base on my guts/balls to take a trade or not take a trade.

--- 帖子 #1767 ---
Hi Cerve, not sure which pair is that. Probably its not one of the pair that I traded because base on the price on the right, it does not match any of the price on my screen. Haha. Probably you can share the pair that is shown.

GBP AUD still open, I take my trades on OANDA now, but still use the charts from FXCM

--- 帖子 #1780 ---
Do you guys think this is a good demand zone? If yes why, if no why?

For me I don't think its a good demand zone because the base looks like not taking bull or bear side due to the doji candle.

Please share your view with me so I can understand and learn more.

Hi Dean,

Firstly my deepest Condolences to you and your family. Next, i am really glad that you are back to share your knowledge and make this thread alive again. At the year 2011, i miss out all your teaching and live webinar. This time round i am not going to miss it and will stick around to learn and eventually contribute. Thanks

By the way is your skype ID still active.

Why demand supply is challenging? Because there can be supply invisible on h4, which will turn the price of h4.

Like here (brighter green supply zone)

It was good, but for 1:1 RR

--- 帖子 #1791 ---
Hey guys! I am interested in this strategy but cannot find any explanation of rules. Can you please point me where can I read them?

--- 帖子 #1792 ---
This isn't a mechanical system, there are no set in stone rules. Spotting supply and demand is simply finding the imbalance in price at points in the market, simply mark them out and trade off them. Use fibs and other such indis as confluence if you like.

--- 帖子 #1793 ---
Multi Time Frame Analysis. Top-down approach.

--- 帖子 #1794 ---
Yes, I saw many Sam Seiden's videos and he repeatedly says that if your supply zone is h4 then you don't have to worry about m15 demand zones on the way to h4 demand zone. But in reality you just never know where supply/demand is hidden which can turn the price and is invisible on your timeframe.

If you would worry about supply/demand on these smaller time frames for larger moves, then obviously you could not trade, because you would not have even 1:1 RR.

--- 帖子 #1795 ---
For those who like to read I found such pdf for supply demand method. Quite close to Sam Seiden's explanations.

--- 帖子 #1797 ---
Your speaking as if you want to trade EVERY SINGLE zone imaginable, which just can't be done. If your trading off the 15 min timeframe then trade off that timeframe. However if your trading off the 4hr, then trade that timeframe. Remember the lower the timeframe the less strong the zones will be, as higher timeframes are naturally more dominant over their smaller counterparts.

Looks like your getting yourself worked up about something which there is just no right or wrong answer for.

I took the indicator from another threat of Supply and demand but is basically a rectangle reader. I don't like the indicators that make the zones for you because you don't know how reliable can be and it can give you some zones that are not very reliable.

I am not with the computer at the moment but if i remember I will upload later the indicator.

--- 帖子 #1801 ---
Is this consider a relevant zone? Drop-base-rally.

--- 帖子 #1802 ---
Possibly a good support zone, but I don't see a demand zone in there

How do you guys go into this process?

How many test of an area You spotted do You trade?

Thank You

--- 帖子 #1804 ---
The drop-base-rally forms on 1 H1 candle for drop, 1 H1 candle for base and 1 H1 candle for rally. After 2 H1 candles it retouches the zone. That is a demand zone I highlighted. Not sure is it consider valid?

--- 帖子 #1805 ---
For me personally I only trade the fresh zone which is touches once only.

This is an excellent thread..where can you get the Supply & Demand indicator?

--- 帖子 #1810 ---
Did a quick 5 min scalp:

I was not sure if the lower wick is a breach of the demand zone or if the candle needs to close below the demand zone in order to invalidate it.

Also I was a little late in entering (Should have entered on the 61.8 fib).

--- 帖子 #1811 ---
Hi All,

Look for potential short at the weekly supply zone for GBPUSD.

Comment are welcome.

--- 帖子 #1812 ---
thats not a true supply you have identified, its more of an swing high i would be careful trading that

--- 帖子 #1813 ---
Good supply zone spotted on USDCAD H1!

--- 帖子 #1814 ---
Thats a good tactic but fresh zones can take time. If a zone is touched 2 or 3 times but price did not violate it. Then the zone is still valid. However the thing to consider is how long price stayed in the zone and how it left. Ideally 4 to 6 candles are a max and should leave with 2 extended candles.

--- 帖子 #1815 ---
Its alright to wait for the fresh zones to work/not work as long as I have a higher probability chance of having winning trades than losing it. I trade not for having many trades but to have many highly successful trades.

That's a new knowledge I learned from you NMZee, 4 to 6 candles in the zone to form a supply/demand zone?

--- 帖子 #1816 ---
Fair point. No, not to form a zone  but to form a base. Minimum 1 maximum 6. Must leave with a maximum of 2 extended candles (long candles) finally we also have to see after how long the price return to the base. To describe a high quality zone, these are the 3 Odd enhancers. ☺. If interested i can share with you how to find trends using the 2 zones violation method.

--- 帖子 #1817 ---
of course, please!

--- 帖子 #1818 ---
Of course! No harm to understand and learn more from one another!

--- 帖子 #1819 ---
ready to learn

--- 帖子 #1820 ---
Grreat spirit.

ok. Depending on the timeframe you trade. For me i look at daily for trend. 1hr for my trade set up and 15 mins for triggering of the trade. Coming back to the original topic.

we have to find 2 zones which were violated. We start with the last candle and work our way to the left. We go candle by candle until we find a zone and see if its violated. Remember for this purpose we dont need class A zones, even week zones are to be considered. So you found a drop base drop zone violated that means trend is up. But you need 2 zones. You found another zone rally base drop violated. Uptrend confirms. Similarly 2 violated demand zone means downtrend.

--- 帖子 #1821 ---
One DZ and one SZ violation means side ways

--- 帖子 #1822 ---
Give me a pair and i"ll try to do this.

--- 帖子 #1823 ---
From your explanation, I don't quite get it on how to trade. I think I need to see it from a chart perspective. Do you mind doing it on GBPCAD H1 TF for me to see? I'm trading H1 TF only. Thank you NMZee!

--- 帖子 #1824 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1825 ---
First zone is dbd you sell here so violation means uptrend. Second zone is a dZ where u buy so violation means downtrend. One of each means based on 2 hr chart the pair is movind sideways. You can do both long and short on Strong dz and sz based on 15 min chart confirmation. Ideally aiming for 20-30 pips with 10 pips SL.

--- 帖子 #1826 ---
2 hr is a typo. Its 1 hr chart

--- 帖子 #1827 ---
Is this what you mean? Sideway for USDJPY

--- 帖子 #1828 ---
usd/ cad set up

--- 帖子 #1829 ---
Sorry for the delay response . Ok lets work this out.

lets consider the last red candle as candle 1 and work our way backwards candle 10,9,8,7 forms a rally base drop which is SZ violation means uptrend.

now going further back on the left side we have candle 20,19,18,17 forming rally base rally a DZ and violation means downtrend. Hence sideways .

Although one might argue after yesterday's risk on scenario. This might have changed on smaller tf. Or may be not. Why dont you have a go at it

--- 帖子 #1830 ---
Candles num are 11,10,9 & 8

second zone 21,20,19, 18.

Good buy set up, its better with a Ihr chart. But looney moves with oil. Meed to sync with oil movements as well

Thanks for the explanation, still trying to wrap my head around this idea. Gonna run thru the charts and spot them.

Cheers,

--- 帖子 #1833 ---
It will be easy once you do a dozen charts☺. All indicators tell you about the trend once its changed. 2 zones violation tells you about the trend or change of it real time.  Feel free to share the charts with me once you are done.☺

Hi guys, Yes I am still alive and here. As mentioned earlier a family member died recently, and it is his funeral tomorrow, so I have been very busy regarding such matter so I apologise for my lack of input recently. After the funeral once all is done and I can let go and allow him to finally rest in peace, I can come back all guns blazing into this thread

In the meantime, I thank each and every one of you who have been posting charts and been making an input to this thread to keep it alive, as you know I believe it deserves activity as such trading produces profitable results once mastered, by not quitting, sticking at it, getting rid of crap indicators, you can trade with the flow of money rather than against it.

Hi all,

I recently discovered this thread and was wondering if the video's on the first post still apply to scalping 5min tf?

--- 帖子 #1836 ---
Hi Shrips, yes by all means, scalping is still fully doable using supply and demand with the method provided. But please be aware smaller the timeframe the less reliable the zones will be.

Hi guys!

I just found out about this supply/demand system after i got f* up yesterday and not knowing why aside from risk management issues

Anyway, I have been reading and learning the system from page 1 up until page 10 currently and man! How i wish i knew about all this simple trade system since the beginning.

Anyway since i'm really new and usually people eventually will find the same problem when starting, I want to ask my first question here because up until page 10 i haven't seen/can't see where this leads to.. Please kindly give me feedbacks as to where i am wrong and loss..

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

So basically GBP/AUD is in BEAR state as on 1D Chart.

I found out that A is the Supply Area at that moment.

It hit once, twice then three times before it drops really far to C.
My first question is around the B area, can that also be considered a new Supply Area? I read that all the Supply/Demand area is suppose to be fresh so it means that A is no longer in progress and it changes to B?

2nd.. Can I consider C a Demand Area in a 1D bearish chart? or in a bearish state we can only use Supply Area?

If B is the new Supply Area (or if this ever happen to a Supply Area),

What happen when something breaks it and keep going?

Does that mean (in this case) it is not going to go down anymore? and how do we know where it will stop?

Thanks in advance!

--- 帖子 #1840 ---
Oh and I also has question regardings this statement.. I know this is like REALLY OLDDDD but I think this might be related to what i asked before this

Page 3 post #43

^I can't see the image is there any good example of what is happening here? Is this similar to what's happening in A?

Page 9 post #173

^If it comes shooting back is like what is happening in the END of my image? That means it's a no trade? because now losing its way?

^This means selling before it falls after it went pass the supply/demand area like in B where it breaks?

Sorry for all this questions.. Thanks again!

Now I'm the first one to say nothing is 100%, and if they say they are, they are lying.

However, I so far have a 100% record trading bitcoin, I have never met a chart that plays by every single rule of supply and demand.

Please see my 2 pics, I gave a signal on Twitter "before the event" about Bitcoin in supply, now in 2nd pic, the result. Absolutely loving bitcoin at the moment. I guess the lack of banks deter from manipulation the currencies get which can break supply zones sometimes.

Hi Dean,

I'm new to Forex trading (2 months in) and I'm so happy that i found your thread. From all the books, videos and  sites I've visited your post has given me the hallelujah moment!!

This and it's also not affected by QE. (though i wonder if that makes any difference)

Wow the feed looks very different on Forex ltd.

How was your blue rectangle's limit based on though?  the lower side. Because on my chart, on the 4H it basically looks like that zone was consumed. (though it still ended up holding price).  No pin bars on my feed. So you basically touch trade your entry? no confirmations then?

How to know if these zones will hold though? Do you look at the dollar index ? (if it's located at a supply or demand zone). Or do you simply accept the 50/50 chance of it failing?

I get that you're picky about the zones. Look at confluences with fibs. but how long do you let these trades run? Just to the next logical opposing zone of the same time frame? For ex, daily demand to daily supply. What if price violently turns against you before reaching your target? Simply trail stop from the start? (wait for daily candle to close, then if price still goes in your direction, move stop under or above next daily candle wick ?

Or is the trade management different at all?

Just another question. Why the daily ? Doesn't that reduce your trade opportunities? Or are there plenty of opportunities every week?

Do you just find the daily more reliable? Or is it too stressful to trade 5, 15 or 30 min time frames?

Just found this thread, trying to perfect my 5/15 min s&d scalping. Will have a good read through.

--- 帖子 #1850 ---
Good morning from asia session.

I am still paper trading and so far I have mixed results with indicators and better results with PA Support Resistance. I found this thread last Saturday and i've pummelled through until page 70-ish, some of rockys thread, read articles re: SD zones and couple of hours of youtubes vids. Tried to wrap my head around this concept but was unable to completely get it looking at the price histories last night. So I decided to sleep on it. This morning is saw a setup and took a trade. Made a good 16 pip out of it. Looks very promising indeed!

That is, of course assuming this is not a fluke and if I can replicate this trade consistently in the future

Therefore I appreciate forum member's advise if my logic was correct.

GBPUSD 5min, 01:50am MT5 time.
Attached Image (click to enlarge)

a. From candle 1 and 2 I identified the supply and demand zone. I was a bit skeptical about this setup since to the pull back occurred relatively quick and the fact that this is a 5min chart and those candles and the pullback occurred last Friday (would you consider these valid considerations?). Appreciate if you can adv if I have identified the zones correctly. The candle 2's super long upper wick confuses me, more on that in point c.

b. Until 02:05 MT time, things are shaping up nicely. Put a buy limit order just a hair above and SL below the demand zone. My order was filled shortly thereafter (candle 3).

c. I actually have put the TP above the supply zone, reasoning : the zone had been tested several times prior.

d. The ride north was smooth but I actually chickened out and closed the trade manually (candle 4) because I was unsure abt the boundaries of the supply zone. Eventually the price actually hit my initial TP. If I identified my supply zone correctly, can I say that the price have formed a new level of supply zone (3 candles after candle 4)?

Thank you for the OP for sharing this strategy and I appreciate fellow forum member's input on the above.

Hi to all in here,

thanks to all for sharing all the information here (especially deankenny21). I am new to FX trading and want to learn trading by supply demand. I read sveral threads and watched some Sam Seiden videos.

My first step is to learn how to define supply and demand, then later on I want to use fibs and maybe bollinger bands to improve trading success.

So here is my first my first chart (I tried to combine higher (daily) and lower timeframe (H4)).

In this case i would take a long trade in the higher H4 demand zone. What do you think about the demand zones highlighted in this chart (yellow is daily, green is H4).

All comments and feedback are appreciated.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Mike

--- 帖子 #1852 ---
I agree with you on the zone on the 12th Jan, not sure about below it, didnt have the oomph upwards. How about H1 chart? Tested twice before, lets see what happens when price visits that zone. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #1853 ---
Hi,

i am also not sure about the second zone as the consolidation lasted quite long, this means that in this time many trades had been placed without moving the price. So there are not many trades left that have to be placed when the zone is touched again.

Do you mean the demand zone at around 0.79481 (i downloaded your screenshot and tried to mark the zone)?

I am also not sure about this one, as there is a black candle right after the takeoff. and I also think, that the candles are not big enough, for me there was not enough power (when you compare the red candles where the price dropped from about 0.80330 to about 0.79530, price did not take off that fast). And it is the second touch, so it is not a fresh zone.

Did you follow what happened when the zone has been touched, it would be very interesting (can not access Meta Trader right now)?

Edit: You would have made a nice profit on the mentioned demand zone (see new chart attached), very weill recognized I would say.

Hi,

I would need some advice on this one. Do you consider the marked zones als valid demand zones (they only consist of one big white candle)?

Thanks for your help.

Hi Mike,

Sorry I was preoccupied with something else. I actually was referreing to the small bull bar (17 Jan, 0900hrs MT4 time) in my post earlier. Tested once but seems we wont see it tested again anytime soon now

Ref to your last post I would agree with you, however as you can see these zones are not reliable to make trading decisions. They were just 'somewhat' respected by price. From what I gather, the confluence of zones in one timeframe with another along with fibs and TL will greatly increase the reliability of an identified zone. Pls have a look at this :
https://www.forexfactory.com/showthr...309766&page=10

Post #193 onwards. TS was rocky which I believe also mentioned by deankenny21 himself.

Im still trying to wrap the idea around my head myself. Hope it helps.

--- 帖子 #1856 ---
Dean -how do you draw in those zones please ?

--- 帖子 #1857 ---
Hi Spot,

thank you for your answer and sorry for the late reply, was very busy the last days.

Rocky and Dean are both using fibs for their trading decisions. I am still not that far with my learning. My first goal ist that I am able to spot the right zones and using time frame analysis. The next step would be drawing the fibs and the last would be setting the target limits / stop loss limits.

I tried to spot some zones. All comments appreciated.

Thank you and greetings

Why wait so long for your money Mike?

You can adjust your risk to remain the same on smaller timescales.

GU, look to retest the start of the move, with SL above. The most obvious target is the first pinbar but on a smaller scale it will usually look like a 123. This is the subwave (i) of the prior cycle. You will be amazed how often that PA will react off of this point to the pip, particularly if it is in normal hours with good volume when the retest occurs;

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Follow stoploss chase tightly when approaching prior demand. I use a pip above each finished candle at that stage. So you can see the reaction when we reached prior demand and the trade is taken out.

Now because there was no fresh LL yet for trend continuance, we look back to the most recent obvious Supply zone again. Find the 123 (subwave 'i') at the start of the move and we can see the reaction;

Hi Cableguy,

thank you for sharing your knowledge and for taking time answering me.

To sum up your information: When choosing a supply or demand zone on a higher timeframe like H1, the chosen zone should be confirmed by a 1-2-3 subwave (the zone is constructed by the 1-2-3 wave). This will enhance the odds of choosing a working zone.

As I am having a full time job I am not able to participate at trading during days (maybe I will make my way to a full time trader in the future) so my intention is to stick to Daily, H4 or H1 timeframes.

Which timeframes did yiu use on the posted charts?

So you are not only trading FOREX, you are also into index and stock trading?

Thank you very much.

Greetings

Hi Mike,

Yeh, it is in EW terms, a subwave 1&2 of the previous cycle, but don't get too hung up on it with smaller time scales. If you are trading larger, look for the pullback pin;

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

It will just look different depending on how you zoom in on it, on small scales - a 123, (retest point 2);

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

on bigger scales - a pullback pin - bigger again, the candle body of the pinbar at the start of the move...

This is the same as above, but how it looks on a smaller scale, (now you will see the usual 123 retest of point 2);

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

and even if you missed that entry, scale in and there is a repeat on a smaller set-up, but the same;

I generally trade the NQ, but Supply/Demand is the very basis on how any instrument works, be it Commodities, Index's of FX pairs etc

Big scale, the starting pinbar candle body;

The great thing is that even when the trend is wrong, you often get a nig enough reaction off of that point to at least get your Stoploss to BE (safety).

Hi Cableguy,

thank you again for your answer.

I tried to spot some supply/demand zones according to your advice (pullback bar). I think zones work quite well when they consist of only one pullback bar. My problem with this is that I can't spot this setup quite often when searching the main forex pairs. Or maybe I simply do not have the practice to spot them.

Is it also okay, when the zone consists of more candles (2-3)? When yes is it ok, when they really form a pullback with 2-3 candles?

Because when reading through this thread, it has always been said that in the zone we need an equilibrium of about two to three candles.

Thank you in advance.

Greetings Mike

--- 帖子 #1869 ---
Absolutely Mike;

This would be my favourite pattern, which is easy to identify... some tightly packed candles showing consolidation, followed by a fast thrust away. The retest of which is always worth trading with stop above;

Hi,
thank you again for your answer and guidance.
As I am going through charts, questions occur and I am glad I can ask them here in this thread and experienced traders share their knowledge. So, thanks to all traders who share their knowledge and experience with a novice trader.
To sum it up, we have these types of supply/demand zones:drop base drop rally base rally drop base rally rally base drop The zone of these types can be formed by one pullback candle or more candles that form an equilibrium (tight pack of candles) How long do you wait until a zone is touched? How much time do you let pass before deleting the zone?
Attached you find some charts with zones marked. If you have time, please have a look at them, all comments are welcome.

Thank you in advance.

Hello deankenny21,

I am new to this art of trading and I have found it to be my way to go. I am also new to forex trading and charts in general. I tried to look on the thread where you show how the fib is used, but I have not encountered it yet. I have watched the Sam Seiden videos on YT, read some lengthy .PDF documents on the subject, including your documents. Your videos I have not yet watched to their great extent, but I will.

I can see you draw the fib. retracement, but the rules for the retracement, I have yet to stumble upon elaboration of the aforementioned subject.

Or is it just a "normal" Fib. retracement, without any specific use case regards to your S&D trading. I will find out. Thank you for your good spirit!

I am really looking forward for this year, learning S&D and automating the trading. GOOD LUCK TO ALL OF YOU!

Hi cable Guy. Any idea why spread is high on gbp pairs[/quote]

If you mean right now, there is little liquidity as it is Good Friday and most markets are closed.

--- 帖子 #1876 ---
In my humble opinion, it is best to use Supply/Demand in conjunction with overall market structure (HH/HL's or vica versa) and choose the immediate pullbacks, within the likely same phase.

Choosing prior S/D levels when against trend has limited success. Yes there is often a reaction at that level, but if the trend has changed it will likely only be enough to get your stoploss to BE.

Attached Image

So here we have LL/LH combo - trend is down, pullback to prior Supply. Join in to target fresh LL as per trend...

My favourite trades are using 123's back into underlying trend. You need to match the scale of the pullback (and thus set-up) to what PA was printed beforehand;

Attached Image

Here we can see a pullback within an uptrend with HH/HL combo, then a 123 that triggers (break of point 2), followed by an immediate pullback to near point 3 (where the demand starts), enter there to get onboard the ride back into main trend...

Here was 15 minutes of trading the NQ yesterday;

--- 帖子 #1877 ---
Hi, Cableguy. im a kind of reversal trader, and the 123 is an important part to consider when i chose my reversal levels. don’t know whether or not you also trade reversals, if any, could you please share some of your opinions on how you pick the SD zones when trading reversal?

best regards.

--- 帖子 #1878 ---
Hi Derek,

I think that the answer is too complex to explain in one post!

I would suggest that every trade i take is a reversal, but i try to take them back into the underlying trend, (everything is fractal, so i'm talking about the next largest cycle), thus i am predicting the end of a corrective move.

Along the way I've practiced Elliott Wave for 7 years or more and can't help but to view the market in phases or cycles.

Combining Fibonacci levels together with wave counts can be very accurate and i have a thread with many examples of this, but in all honesty, keeping it as simple as possible. I will look for a 123 to trigger by break of point 2 and then wait for a retrace close to point 3. If it doesn't pullback, hey ho, wait for the next one.

I spent years taking the triggers of 123's but that puts the risk too high compared to waiting for the pullback to original S/D level at start of the move.

Market structure (HH/HL's or vica versa), then pullback, without breaking that trend, then 123 back into underlying trend;

--- 帖子 #1879 ---
I should add perhaps, that i find trading the NQ Futures market far better than FX. There is a level playing field and tonnes more movement.

Just as an example, here is a chart showing 15 minutes of trading starting at 10:30 US time (from last week);

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Both trades are 123, trigger, deep pullback to retest start of S/D. That is when i will enter, with SL just above/below point 1 (or 3 if i'm feeling more aggressive).

There was also a pullback trade, short, inbetween, but i was too slow placing my limit order, deleted it and missed another retest of the same level, but it was moving very very quickly.

The 123 at the low, was also prior Demand, looking left.

--- 帖子 #1880 ---
Thanks for your kindness Cableguy.  i just find some 123s, marked them with ellipses and arrows, ellipses are good ones that i will take, and the arrows are bad based on my experiences, i probably will ignore them. Do not know if they are reasonable to you? And the problem is that i could not tell more about why they are good or bad, except that " this is a flag".

--- 帖子 #1881 ---
I trade futures as while. you always enter with limit order?

i marked some level on your chart, will you set limit order at there?

--- 帖子 #1882 ---
Trades journal http://t.me/wicksfxlabs Taking into account all what deankenny21 its imperative to note that supply and demand trading is among the most profitable approach. However, its a mystery and a fallacy to many. Everyone has their own views on technical analysis and more important how supply and demand works. But all these are self centred approaches unless you were trained by the market itself.

I document my trades here http://t.me/wicksfxlabs  only trading from the extreme demand zone and extreme supply zone which is hard for new traders but reduces risk and drawdowns.

--- 帖子 #1883 ---
when you have a 123 at the end of a trend that's a no brainer

--- 帖子 #1884 ---
Yes, i generally always use limit orders. If i consider we are clearly in the powerful 3rd wave, i will use stop orders if the leg 3 (of 123) was small, back into trend...

It looks to me like your levels are more Support/Resistance type than Supply/Demand.

I want a retest that is deep, to remove most of the risk, we want a reaction there as a minimum - enough to get stoploss to BE quickly, so i am basically looking to identify the start of where buyers or sellers previously entered the market (some examples in red rectangles). The stronger the reaction, the better, so we want to see nice thrust bars, to give evidence of this. If we can retest near the start of the move, it is worth the risk in my mind. That said, i don't like to see a pullback immediately before a level. If i get a fill, i will look to remove risk as soon as possible, if it pulls back before a fill, i will likely remove the order and look for the next set-up. That's the beauty of trading something like the NQ - set-ups come along every few minutes, cos she's a lively little thing!)

Attached Image (click to enlarge)

The important thing to realise is that there will be losers. That's why i stress to identify the start of the move, but nothing is for granted. If the trend has changed then it can storm straight through a previous S/D level without hesitation or reaction.

That's why we need to watch market structure (HH/HL's etc)

I've not conversed with Dean before, but he got this down to a T... I see he was here, lurking earlier, but hasn't posted much of late.

Divergence (above) is another trader who should be watched and listened too. I've learnt a tonne from him over the years...

--- 帖子 #1885 ---
hi Cableguy

interesting way of trading.

how do you exit trades?, because I notice your profit amounts are all different and it's looking like you're not using a fixed tp

--- 帖子 #1886 ---
The target always changes depending on the set-up, so although my order does have a set TP, i usually get taken out by stop instead. I chase PA up/down with my SL as it prints, after a retest of entry, i will usually chase down a tick above/below each completed candle, but if the current candle is going strongly in my favour and i am already +20, i will even chase down within that candle.

It's all about accumulation of points. A +20 here, a +15  or +12 there and you can quickly amount a nice total. You would need to watch the NQ on 133 tick to really understand that it is printing so fast, that it really is about grabbing what you can.

If i see a strong Elliott Wave set-up, suggesting eg, a fresh low (if short), i will try to hold on for this target as a minimum, but that is often more difficult in reality than in theory.

Yesterday, i viewed the PA that had just printed as an 'ABC' move (corrective, which suggests trend to continue afterwards). When a 3w (abc) move is followed by another 3w move to create a double bottom/top, it is likely A & B of a flat correction, thus wave C should not travel far beyond wave A end. Look for a 123 reversal at that point, trigger and pullback, et voila, you get a great set-up with target of fresh low. Even then, i was too aggressive with my stoploss chase, not wanting to give any back;

Thanks Dean for this amazing amazing thread! Be blessed abundantly!

My question here is why would you take this 1 hour demand and price has taken long to get to this zone? Looking back to your rules, you say amount of time taken to get back to the zone invalidates the zone..

Also, would you take trades off immediate entry into Supply or demand zones? Or what would be your trigger for entry ?

Thanks

Hey guys, I am thinking of starting a livestream again simply due to the amount of time I now have in life.

But I don't want it to be treated as a signal service, I want people to learn, watch and do it for themselves, I will of course pick out levels, but for educational purposes only, not for signal purposes. I will of course go through everything behind that level being chosen, target to be looking out for, how to work out your money management etc.

Right lets get back into action...

So a trade I am in right now, I also took the ride up which you can see touched by the exact pip, as pretty much my supply zone did too, you can see I am in a trade here SHORT, and I have now moved the SL to a positive positive equalling 1.2 of my risk, I am of course aiming for the opposite zone which will be around 4.0-5.0 of my risk, which is fantastic, this trade for me now is already a winner since the SL is now in a profitable position more than what my risk originally was.

--- 帖子 #1923 ---
Both fast move...and first revesit...any other explanations?

--- 帖子 #1924 ---
I'm out now for 1.2 risk reward, so nice profitable trade for today.

As for the explanations this is something I want to start the livestream for, for example putting a fib on the move up the 61.8 falls straight through the middle of the supply zone amongst other things of course which are harder to explain but easier to show in a live market, hence the thoughts of starting up some livestreams again.

Could also be due to changing market conditions as this was started in 2011. A lot of these threads are pretty old and they start off really decent but over time just die off as the strategy loses its edge over time I guess

--- 帖子 #1941 ---
Seems like you just couldn't read couple of pages. The guys is still here and trading lol =)

Why even come here and type something if you don't believe in forums and strategies here. Always wonder, did you just lose money to the market and  trying to take it out on the people here?

--- 帖子 #1942 ---
Is he still on this forum or is he elsewhere? Last post here was in April. I've been following S/D trading for a while but haven't given much time to it. I'd like to start learning from him if he's still active

--- 帖子 #1943 ---
I saw him post one trade, could have been cherry picked. Then checked his twitch and all I saw was a F1 game.

I come here and other forums from time to time to remind what people is using and what is not working. Kinda like a counter indicator  In fact I wrote I want him to stream some trades, real time. I have followed his channel for a long time now. Hid and bunch of others around here.

And no, I didnt just lose money. In fact today was a day off because of CPI being released. Apart from that, a pretty good week to be honest.

Sorry to burst your bubble. Keep looking for the winning strategy here, maybe you'll be lucky

Till next time.

Yeah same. All I saw was him playing some F1 games... Maybe his trades shared here worked and add value but his stream, not so much

Hi all, long term member here but never posted. I have been trading forex for almost 10 years with inconsistent success across many strategies including supply and demand. I would get frustrated with zones constantly not being respected until recently.

I have tried the usual advise of long candles, leaving the zone fast equals strongest zone etc etc etc. I have found a very simple technique which takes away all of the over analysis, rules and discretion.

Using a 50 and 20 MA to identify previous supply and demand zones has increased my success rate like no tomorrow! Below are some LIVE trades I am in, I'm not posting previous setups as anyone can do that and doesn't help anyone really. I find a supply or demand zone sitting above or below another supply and demand and the highest probability I have personally seen. When it does not respect the initial zone the one above or below where it started is the area I enter>

Again this does not seem to follow any traditional supply and demand trading rules at all, but its definitely working for me and that's all that matters at the end of the day.

Red line is my SL, green line my TP and yellow mark is where I entered so you can see its actually a REAL LIVE trade.

I have attached screenshots of my LIVE trades currently in as examples.

How do you fit your MAs into the picture? Do you draw your supply when they cross or close to each other (meaning MAs)? Or you draw your supply/demand when the price gets close to them to expect brake or bounce of them? May you please explain more?

--- 帖子 #1947 ---
I use the cross or strong continuation (widening MA) to assist in determine where the zone is. I draw the zones after identifying with the MA first.

--- 帖子 #1948 ---
just saw this thread n subscribed, seems I will love it as I use snd with fibs, hope get many experience from this thread

--- 帖子 #1949 ---
Ok I see. How did your trades end up? =)

--- 帖子 #1950 ---
Wow some really ignorant comments lately, just goes to show and maybe somewhat explain why I don't share so much, although most of it previously was binded to contracts when I got signed up to trade for the record company.

I started a stream on twitch, really excited to get that going, nothing is cherry picked as any one of my early followers will know, when I was a mere taxi driver, cherry picking was my pet hate, and something I despise, and prided myself for only ever showing my live trading, even my dollar amount that I had with my first little account was not even hidden, I planned to do the same again on twitch.

Anyway so I started my twitch stream and nobody turned up, not even 1 person, only person that turned up asked when I was going to be playing Assetto Corsa next.

So you only have yourselves to blame., it was a Sunday evening when I assumed most people would be at home and I even remember entilting it about the week ahead and looking for possible opportunities, but I waited for a good while and no one showed up. HELL, even I edited my last post about no one turning up and asked everyone a good time, and STILL no one replied but 1 person as to a suitable time for them, the following posts are people moaning about me streaming racing games (go back have a look for yourself, I literally post asking people for times, then next page, AHHH HES PLAYING VIDEO GAME) , cmon guys, you got to give to receive in this world. https://i.imgur.com/8pIATSz.png

Everything I've ever shared or taught I've done for free, and never EVER asked for a dime as I was about to do so again via free streams on twitch, so please less of the rudeness and ignorance, and if anyone ever finds value in my thread still then it's all still worth it to me.

For everybodies information, yes I still trade, I've had Audi R8's, Nissan Gt'Rs, Mercedes c63 blah blah blah been through that materialistic phase in my earlier days as i've grown maturer and realised more important things in life, I have various accounts now all dotted about doing their own thing, I have alot of time, and I mean ALOT, hence all the game playing and streaming, yes I still trade supply and demand, it's not really something that can expire, as supply and demand still drives the market as it did back then, today and into the future.

--- 帖子 #1951 ---
The problem I have found with the Supply and Demand strategy is it rarely works out as expected. Most of the time zones are not respected. I don't see how anyone can make a living from such a strategy. It makes more sense to see how price responds to recent highs or lows, and then trade in favor of strength using candlestick patterns.

--- 帖子 #1952 ---
Works with confluence, fibs RN's etc IMO

--- 帖子 #1953 ---
Well there's your first faliure already, supply and demand is NOT a strategy, it is a law, it is a driver, it is not something you can copy and paste and colour by numbers.

You can create a strategy using supply and demand as the main driver maybe, but as a singular.

Like myself, once you can spot supply and demand with just looking at your chart with your naked eyes, everything changed for me, my eyes were opened.

Upon which of course I built a system to work with using supply and demand as my respected driver, bring in fibs, and a few other bits just as above user mentioned, then you are closer to something which can be called a strategy. Supply and demand is a law, in pretty much everything, business, sales, food chain, stock market etc etc etc, not a strategy lol. With whatever you choose to trade with, no matter what you choose, if you disrespect the law of supply and demand then you will lose either way.

If you perceive supply and demand as a strategy you are at a place where you still have alot to learn, and much to respect within the markets.

--- 帖子 #1954 ---
Well, yes, I understand it is a law. But when I say, 'strategy,' I am not in error. I am referring to the method commonly taught on trading so-called Supply and Demand zones in the Forex market.

I have a very good supply and demand indicator. When I say it is 'very good,' I mean to say it is quite accurate in drawing so-called supply and demand zones. It was when I tested this indicator in MT4's Strategy Tester that my eyes were opened to how unreliable the strategy is.

But perhaps you have found a better way to trade these zones. If so, then that is good for you.

--- 帖子 #1955 ---
Your posting have been fantastic I think and the fact they are not cherry picked makes you genuine and not like many other posts!

Im really bad at putting questions into words so I’ll give it a crack, please let me know if it dosnt make sence!

might just be me, but I have noticed that often when price races fast towards a zone during the uk and us session (high liquidity) and then slows down and stops at the end of the session, it it’s close to the zone then there it seems to drastically increase the likelihood of the zone being respected during the Asian session. Just wondered if you had any observations or thoughts on this?

--- 帖子 #1956 ---
Here are some examples of current open trades I was explaining regarding when a zone is entered at the end of the US session. Price often becomes exhausted and then the 'bargain hunters' enter at the commencement of the Asian session which seems to increase the likelihood of the zone being respected. Just my personal observation would love to hear your feedback!

I apologise the first trade is completed for profit but the second two are live and still open.

--- 帖子 #1957 ---
Its actually that most people can’t follow it, that’s the issue. I can say hand on heart this thread owner has improved my trading tenfolds. I always knew I was close but couldn’t quite get it. The information posted here was just that little extra I needed. When you see zones you see them and they become EASY to see! The R:R is so large even if you was only 50% successful you would be way in front.

@deankenny21 I can not thank you enough!

--- 帖子 #1958 ---
Hi Dean, just a question on an observation I have made a lot. When price returns to a say a supply zone the second time and in a downtrend, the second reaction on many occasions often results in a massive move, I’m talking like a R:R of like 1: 8, 9 and even 10!

Have you even noticed this? I have attached an example of what I’m on about.

--- 帖子 #1959 ---
My friend it is rather simple. You focus too much on technical analysis

--- 帖子 #1960 ---
That is a problem.

--- 帖子 #1961 ---
Hey guys i am new in this thread, is this a valid entry?

--- 帖子 #1962 ---
I am interested.  am now in love with supply and demand.

--- 帖子 #1963 ---
Hi. If this is still a thing Im interested too! thanks

--- 帖子 #1964 ---
