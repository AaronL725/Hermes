Main purpose of this thread-understanding the movement of the market with te help of volumes. The sense of all theory is very simple: the market forms volume, and than trades from the prices with max volumes. http://savepic.ru/373672.png http://savepic.ru/356264.png Simple example. We take any day, for example 01.12 (the euro Futures): the Volume of day was made on the price 1,262: Volumes you can take from programs working with feed. http://savepic.ru/391236.png http://savepic.ru/374835.png Now we take a look how the next day trades from that volume. http://savepic.ru/375859.png Buy from max volume accumulation of the previous day. It is important.All intraday movements lean on intraday volumes of day + last volumes. The FX market follows these quotations.Reaction of the market to these injections (volumes) looks in shape of "rebound", as is shown in drawing above. Why so the market reacts to the volumes? The price on which the large volume is accumulated, it is the price on which large players buy or sell, people, who knowe how the system works. On such prices turn-overs are hundreds million dollars, these prices are key levels from which any market trades. On an example 2.12 this situation can be described so: On Monday large positions have come into the market under the same price. It is possible to consider it as the price behind which there are big money. On Tuesday we see that during the period from 4:00 the market was above this level of a previous day, and has pressed through the market only to the price 1,262.Usual traders are not capable to resist injections of big money.We see reaction of the market to the prices with large volume in a kind of rebound from that prices.

Example of the same trading principle.Max volume of the day-2.12 was formed on the price 1, 27: http://savepic.ru/378948.png The same system of trading from the max volume of the previous day: http://savepic.ru/393133.png Pay attention that the market has reached volume of Monday 1, 262 - level from which traded Tuesday.

Analysis 12.12 on euro. The logic of the movement of market from volume of the previous day: today market opened above max volume of the previous day- that means "we are in a buy-zone".looking where to open a "buy" position.the market gives system deals from the price with max volume. http://savepic.ru/380822.png Trades from that volume: http://savepic.ru/351149.png

Great thread Alex, thanks! Sensible and logical concepts. I have a question, if one doesn't have a data feed service other than meta trader, is there a way to figure out previous day's volume? Would this be the 50% retrace of prev day hi-to-low fib?

--- 帖子 #5 ---
No.I advise you to use something that counts volume.Other methods are unprofitable.Because nothing esle shows it.

Let's consider the market movement (euro futures) last week. First we will look at the volumes of all contract since 08.09, as that day there was a change to the December contract. Max volume for contract prices (till Thursday 04.12 at 8:00): http://savepic.ru/369734.png During all the contract on the prices 1,263 1,27 1,285 huge volume was formed.As current contract comes to an end, from 1st to 5th of December on the market appears large volumes of days (closing large positions).That forms total volume of week on the price 1, 262: http://savepic.ru/360518.png On Thursday 4.12 at 8:00 we already have large volume of week which has been formed for three days.Pay your attention: volume of the week 7179 lots, and volume of all the contract 19767 lots. That means only for 3 days was formed 1/3 of all volumes for the contract.That tells about serious movement in the market.Exactly that happened on Thursday: http://savepic.ru/371630.png I show in more details as happens deal on "buy" from these levels. After 8:00 the market gained from level of week 1, 262 and what`s interesting - on that price-1.262 from 7 to 8:00 was formed max volume of an hour, hour befor strong movement. Volume of an hour we see on a cluster chart: http://savepic.ru/370606.png Now we look for the process how the market gained from formed volumes: http://savepic.ru/363438.png Finally the market gained from max volume of the contract, which was on 1,263. Such powerful movements of the market happen from large week volumes and max contract volumes.It always happen in the same way.

Just curious what kind of charting package your using

--- 帖子 #8 ---
I use everything that helps to trade.charts from trading platform.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Is it just me or is that bloomberg you're using?

--- 帖子 #10 ---
Looks like Bloomberg service but he said this is Volfix platform.

--- 帖子 #11 ---
anyone know if there's a "cluster" indicator for mt4 that shows the cluster information shown above? Tried a search but had no luck. Maybe under a different name?

--- 帖子 #12 ---
The trading software that i see from up bar is called VOLFIX! Really interesting this method, it seems an advancement of VSA! Maybe it can be done something like that with metatrader, making an indicator that shows the volumes of the bars and at what price is the maximum volume. Lubo.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Information above in such enterpritation shows only that programm.Though Market delta has cluster charts too, with delta volumes.Bloomberg has some similar instruments, cqg and e-sygnal work with feed too.As for me its much easier to work with volfix.If people are inerested, I`ll continue to post here information about trading by volumes on gold, euro and s&amp;p futures.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Hi Alex_S, thanks for thi tread! I went to volfix page , and says only that you can download the demo with one month dalay. Could you tell something more about? like on the price fee, data feed, which broker can be use ....etc.. Thanks. Lubo P.s : Continue the explanation is really very interesting.

--- 帖子 #15 ---
No problems.But lets talk about such thing in private.I dont want this stuff to be deleted because of abuses in advertising.I want this thread to be only about trading.Maybe later Ill make a thread about technical questions-here only trading.Demo of this programm I can ask with online data with no delay.

Let's consider on an example how traded the current contract on s&amp;p 500 mini futures.With the help of volume counter I look for the prices with the maximum volumes for the contract. A principle is simple: in the beginning of the contract investors open long-term positions and that forms a trend. After accumulation of large volume there is "working off" of prices with max volumes and strong movement.The market comes back to the prices with large volume and without "pressing them through" it "flies away". The first prices with large volumes in the beginning of the contract: 1179 / 1250 / 1252/ 1250 / 1210. http://savepic.ru/353384.png Chart shows all the contract that began in September: http://savepic.ru/343975.jpg Market declined.After strong movement on sale on the prices 967 and 968 new maximum volumes for contract appeared, that means that possibly the trend may be reversed or may also continue to decline for a long time. The market has given sales from that prices.And declined again. After that the new volume of the contract has been made on the price 870,and that new max volume reversed the market to the previous max volume on 967-968. http://savepic.ru/348264.png All given movements of the market are used for opening positions on "buy or sell", only when it is confirmed by intraday volume and there is an intraday-deal in the same way.

--- 帖子 #19 ---
This is currency futures. How is that volume related to the spot market?? I don't see the relationship.

--- 帖子 #20 ---
On futures we can see a volumes.volumes that form movement.currencies, commodities, indexes.volumes on futures shows what is going on the futures market as well as on the spot makret as they are unseparable.

--- 帖子 #21 ---
The analysis on S&amp;P 500 mini futures.That day began changing from DEC`08 contract to MAR`09. On tis chart you can see 3 last weeks, and prices with max volumes per week. Dark blue is the week from 1 to 7.12 with max volumes 834/835/844,5 Red week - 24-30.11 formed volumes on the 849-850 prices. Volumes of two weeks in a narrow range.Huge volume is formed in the bottom.That pushed the market higher. Yellow week (8-14.12) opened above this large volume that means the market is in a "buy zone".But for 3 days from monday to wednesday, unusually big volume appeared on 898/898,25/898,50.153491 lots for 3-4 days.That is about 540 million dollars only on one price.Must be a strong movement.And we have to join it Thursday the market gave intraday deal from that price: market rebounded from 898 and went under intraday volumes.Big players reversed the market to the levels of previous weeks. On the chart 870 and 869 are max volumes for all the contract. http://savepic.ru/335800.png On this chart you see how happened a sell-deal from 898 level, with rebound from that price. http://savepic.ru/337848.png Here are all intraday volumes with interval of 1 hour.Max volumes are coloured-we see how was fomed volumes for selling. http://savepic.ru/342968.png This are max volumes per week. http://savepic.ru/340920.jpg This contract was quite volatile wiht not as big volumes as it was in previous, but it wasn`t a problem for trading.

--- 帖子 #22 ---
This week`s trading situations on euro futures. Nice positions are from the max volume of the previous day. Current week-white chart, opened above previous week- red chart, and above max volumes per contract, that means we are in a "buy zone". It means we are looking for positions on "buy", but if there will appear large volumes on the hights, it may be a reverse.The market usually pull through prices with less volume concentrations, and rebound from prices with big volumes. Support, and the price from which we look for position to buy, will be prices with max volumes of the week before previous. That is week 24-30.11, and it is the green chart. Volumes (24.11-28.11): http://savepic.ru/364475.png Trend is gaining.we look for ponit where to buy from prices 1,29 / 1,286 / 1,2885. http://savepic.ru/368571.png The best deal was afer makret formed a normal volume of a current week( for 2 days 8.12-9.12 on the price 1,2896).It usually makes a "platform from volume" from which to start a nice movement. That was an acknowledgement that market will gain. Final "buy" on wednesday is from category non-risky deals.Deals on which you can searly open all deposit. http://savepic.ru/356283.png

Great thread Alex. Keep them coming!

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Very insightful volume analysis Alex. Thanks a lot. Carl

--- 帖子 #25 ---
This is a very cool concept...You are basically finding the fractals within the volume. While a lot of us use extreme swings to trade off, you have an edge by trading that which is unseen- that being these high volume fractals. I look forward to learning more from you. I am seeing some really strong possibilities with what you are teaching when connected to my fib methodologies. Thanks, Scotty B

Nice to hear that.Ill keep the information coming)

Analysis for 11.12 After strong gain of the market, at top 1.3265-1.3269 great volumes were generated. In the range of two hours only on the price 1.3266 was total positions of 1425 lots. The maximum volume for a day + the maximum volumes in an hour, after strong movement. Someone`s trying to reverse the market, though a trend and gaining, but to the bottom volumes speculative sale should pass. On the chart violet-is an hour from 8 to 9, green chart-is an hour from 9 to 10.I use this stuff for intraday trading The market was forming volume for an hour and a half.That`s enough for reversing. Time factor is really important too. Volume, price, time. We wait till the market rebounds from prices with maximum volumes .That happened at 9:35 than under 1.326 it was necessarily to sell deal with very low risk. This is chart with volumes formed for 60 min per every cluster( max are coloured): http://savepic.ru/365442.png http://savepic.ru/366466.png

--- 帖子 #29 ---
12.12 analysis Short intraday sell, from intraday max volumes.By the way-new max volume of the contract - 1,335.Not large yet. http://savepic.ru/353209.png Above the price with max volume of contract the market was forming volume for about 2,5 hours, and what is interesting-max volumes are in close price intervals. When max volumes of hours are in close price intervals that tells about high interest of the market to that prices.That means deal from that levels will have very-low risk character. http://savepic.ru/342989.png This situation on bar chart: http://savepic.ru/330701.png Sell stop limit under the contract price, sell against price with max volume for a contract is unprofitable P.S.The weather in Kiev is awful, its time to go on South

Friday analysis on s&amp;p.Intraday. It began trading on a new contract, now it forms volumes to start a nice movement that surly will be next week=) On Friday there was only one deal-a good oppotunity to buy in 11th hour. To make it clear -the volume of 9th and 10th hours forms the "mood" of the market till the end of a trading session.There may be some reversing large volumes in the second half of the day-but they are easily seen.Volumes of 9th and 10th hours may be considered as a "corridor" of two prices.If market is under that prices-we are in a "sell zone", what means you shouldn`t buy=) If market is above-we should look where to buy. Friday`s max volumes per hours: http://savepic.ru/354255.png Market "gave deal" from volume of 10th hour and max volume of the day.One important thing-before you open your position - make sure that you aren`t opening position against max volume of previous 15 min.It is a very good ensurance=) That means we should buy above and sell below max volume of previous 15 min. http://savepic.ru/339919.png Cutting one chart on many, with interval-an hour and their imposing against each other helps to evaluate better a current situation concerning last time periods and volumes. So that happens speculative movements.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
I also earn money on EUA on pipsing.I wont go into details, just show the mechanism.I take time from 8:00 to 10:00.show not all deals, just some of them for example.I take as a base some time interval-5 min.I have tick chart and tick volumes.I look for 5 minutes with maximum tick volume.Its usually a quotation with large volume concentration.On chart they are painted red.Prices with big volume accumulation.The market does not punch these prices and jumps aside.It s usually not hard to open position. http://savepic.ru/338825.png http://savepic.ru/337801.png If such things are interesting-Ill continue to post here pipsing deals.pluses of such method-many deals-with 5 pips at once, minuses-you shoul pay a lot on comission.But I usually open positions less times but they are longer.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Hey alex, I am very interested in learning more of your analysis. This is really good stuff. I see tons of potential in what you are teaching. Where did you learn these things? Thanks, Scotty B

--- 帖子 #33 ---
I had an honour to study from a person with very big experience in the market.Tommorow I will post some trades on Gold futures with the same principle.By the way-anyone interested in FTSE?Write me-I`ll show here how it works

--- 帖子 #34 ---
hi very intresting stuff here is there a possibility to use this knowledge with metatrader no chance or? lodol

--- 帖子 #35 ---
hi, no it isen't possible with MT4 the same strategy, because on forex spot is not possible to know the total volume of contracts couse is an OTC market and it hasen't centralized exchange market like futures, and also because on MT4 there aren't currencies futures data. I think the only way to use this method is to have a platform for look at the currency futures volumes and prices and their relation with FX-Spot. Lubo.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
there is a chance... if you understand the system, and see on metatraider where the makret stays longer-large quotations or smth..where large volume must be.But I wouldn`t do that.First of all it`s risky- if you trade big money mt will only help to lose them.

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Yes you are right.Later it would be nice to have a synthetic instrument with volumes from futures on currencies and forex charts.It will be much easier.

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Last week. Pipsing.few days and some deals. Deals are made from max volumes for a short period of time(4-7 min).Principle is easy- on hights you look where to sell, on the lows- where to buy.If a max volume appeared- concentration of large positions on one price during short time, I waite and look how the market will react to that prices-if rebounds I open position.From one large concentration to another goes systemly. 11.12: http://savepic.ru/345998.png 12.12: http://savepic.ru/390106.png later: http://savepic.ru/392154.png

hi alex what you mean with "....large quotations or smth.."? thanks for explanation

--- 帖子 #44 ---
I ment If u dont see the volumes its hard.But on the simple chart u may pay ur attention to the places where the market stayed for making some volume and u will see that from that prices there will be system movements. http://savepic.ru/350172.jpg http://savepic.ru/338908.jpg

GC Gold mostly trades positionally, with long positions made from max week volumes and prices with max volumes per contract. Lets look at situation that happened last week: From 24.11.08 to 28.11.08 market formed large volume.Max volumes are at the prices 814 and 815 and 816: http://savepic.ru/389073.jpg Red week(24-28.11) forms big volume on prices 814/815/816: http://savepic.ru/336843.jpg After market declined green week(1-5.12) made max volume on prices 770 and 772: http://savepic.ru/340939.jpg Next week- white(started 8.12): on Monday forming of volume in the same price range-must be a strong movement.Tuesday the market gave perfect oppotunity to buy.Non-risk system deal.T/p on max volumes of red week s/l below green levels.Such positions are usually held untill new max volumes that can reverse the trend are made.

--- 帖子 #46 ---
GC Today Gold gained from max volumes made on the prices 829/828/827/823 during Thursday and Friday. Under that prices we might look for intraday sell, above- buy. http://savepic.ru/351189.png http://savepic.ru/342997.png Today`s max volume 840.We will see where the market will close and where will be max volumes to make some conclusions.But Monday often gives nice trades from max volumes of previous days.

--- 帖子 #47 ---
Pipsing.s&amp;p Today was quite an interesting day.First of all-information about prices with large volumes in real-time will be posted later-I am intraday trader too Lets begin...Today at 09:01:01 someone opened big position of 1006 and 607 lots on the price 872,50 .This is a tick volume that shows us real deals on the market.That must be an insider and we shoud join him Second "Big Man" appeared at 09:23:02.That was 565 lots. From 9:00 to 10:00 there was few opportunities to sell. http://savepic.ru/345045.jpg On this chart you see how the market reacts to the prices where big positions are.I put there limit orders. http://savepic.ru/354263.jpg

can u pls post for EURUSD?

--- 帖子 #49 ---
hi alex thanks for clearing this and how long such area are valid signals for instance : you have one area (max volume) and if its touched one time then you drop it or will this area stay valid also for later touchings? lodol

--- 帖子 #50 ---
It depends on what volume you consider: Such big positions on tick volumes are valid as level for trade from 5 to about 30 min or a bit more...depends on how big is this position to other volumes during the day. If you take as a level max volume of an hour- you have not more than 30 min of next hour to trade from it. Max volumes of a day- are good for next day and all the days in the current week. Max volumes of the week- are levels for next few weeks. Max volumes for the contract are important for all 2.5 month of the contract. Everything depends on how large the volume is in the shortest period of time.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
I post here analysis on EUA.This is euro futures.It has the same price as a EURUSD but on the futures I can see the volumes, what I can not do on FX. So if I can not see the volumes on forex- I will only loose there money, like other people, trading with indicators...I post here volumes on euro- that operates EURUSD price.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
cash is king forex is the cash market and the future ALWAYS has to follow the cash price. same with dow jones futures. so there is an unbearable big relationship. without that rule, there even wouldn't be thousands of arbitrage traders which take care for the futures price aligning to the spot.

S&amp;P Some of today`s shots: Today the market has opened over Monday. We were in a "buy zone".On the Europe trading session the market gave nice trade.Now on the price 881,25 Chicago formed volume of more then 30000 lots that may pull the price lower. http://savepic.ru/371684.png http://savepic.ru/377828.png Today is a FOMC meeting announcment.My advice is to be careful and out of market from 13:00 (Chicago time).

I`m glad that there are people interested in volumes

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Current situation on s&amp;p: max volumes.interval-an hour.Today is FOMC announsment so volatility may be very low untill 13:00.Max volume in 5 min interval on the price 884.5 - 9000 lots. http://savepic.ru/341988.png

EUA Current situation on euro. Position movement from the rating prices. 11.12 last week there was a transition to the new contract (MAR09).

EUA pipsing 17.12 Some of today`s trades on euro futures.Today is quite a volatile day.On tick charts you see max volumes in 7 minutes interval. Rules of pipsing are simple: buy on lows and sell on hights, I look for big positions in that places, wait till market rebounces from that price and enter my own position.There must be no price drifting of important levels. http://savepic.ru/363274.png http://savepic.ru/373514.png http://savepic.ru/366346.png

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Only for pipsing.Short time period chart and max volumes for such periods.It`s very good way to trade euro. But I always consider max volume accumulation of previous day, week, of contract.That helps me to understand trend and minimise risks.

s&amp;p current situation. Max volume of yesterday 62914 lots on the price 903.Really a lot.Max volume of the week on the price 909.In this "corridor" my advice- to do nothing.Waiting till they make here large volume of the contract and than will be strong movement. http://savepic.ru/371487.png http://savepic.ru/372511.png

Wednesday closed session with high volumes in a rage 903-909.Tuesday formed max volumes in a range 903-909.Thursday: we have large volumes formed on 903-909 and there must be strong movement of the market.Looking for intraday enter for position trade.In "corridor" 903-909 we just sit and watch.Chicago formed max volume of the day on 904 and max volume of an hour on 907.25.Max volume of the contract 903-904.Under 903 sell and above 907-909 - buy.

19.12 s&amp;p 500 e-mini analysis Yesterday was the same trade as on Thursday.About 8 a.m. (Chicago time) market started to gain on news Bush administration will save automobile industry.Large volume accumulated from 8 to 9 pushed the market higher up to the price with max volume of the contract 903.Big positions on 903 are sell orders and market declined from it on Thursday.Above that level trend will be reversed and we will be in a "buy zone".On friday 903 was "worked off"-market tested that price, made large volumes there(from 8 to 9 a.m.), and declined again.Nice trade on "sell again". http://savepic.ru/353073.png http://savepic.ru/353072.png http://savepic.ru/359216.png

EUR euro futures analysis 18.12 Sell from maximal volumes of the day. At the "top" market formed max volumes till 7:00 a.m. on such prices: (volume counter) http://savepic.ru/332593.png From 7:00 to 8:00 a.m. market makes max volume of an hour below these prices- on 1,4591 Attached Image (click to enlarge) Than we observe "working off" of the bottom level 1,4610 that says us that market will decline.No support levels below.Nice opportunity to put sell-stop order under max volume of hour 7-8:00: http://savepic.ru/340788.png Clothing position only when maximal volume, that can reverse the market, will be formed.On the price 1,426 market makes new max volume of the week.Close position. http://savepic.ru/377648.png

EUA One more time about pipsing.Some people are making mistakes so I make it clear. On the first picture we see how in the market appeared position of 96 lots.Than, price with 96 lots, must be tested, market have to "touch" it and rebound. Market gained and than, above appeared 100 lots, that means that "sell" is possible, but there was no rebound from that price.Later market went above that price, came back, touched it and gained.That is a good trade, we should buy there. http://savepic.ru/347952.png http://savepic.ru/343862.png

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Some explanations. When I say max volume must be "worked off" I mean such things: http://savepic.ru/373672.png http://savepic.ru/356264.png Prices with max volumes should be touched and than market "rebounds" from them.Market always confirms importance of large volumes. In shape of "rebound" from the prices with maximal volumes.Like you see on a pictures.That`s what I call "worked off".

GC Next week analysis. During this week(15-19.12) market has formed maximal volumes on such prices: (Volume counter) http://savepic.ru/331568.png Key days of the week on Gold market are Thursday and Friday.They formed max volumes on such prices: (Volume counter) http://savepic.ru/391987.png We put this prices on the chart, showing all week (15-19.12): http://savepic.ru/359233.png We see a "corridor" of prices with max volumes.Above that "corridor" we will be looking for a position "buy" because if the market will be above that volumes, that means- such a big volume is mostly big positions on "buy", and big traders are pushing it much higher, we will be looking for position "buy", as trend will be gaining. And absolutely opposite situation will be if the market will go under that "corridor"- declining trend, we look where to sell. That I call "buy zone" and "sell zone".On Monday usually market gives good trades from max volume of the week and THU+FRI volumes.

EUA analysis Last(15-19.12) week began trading above max volume of the contract (1,335) and was gaining all week till Thursday.During last week the market formed max volume of the contract on the price 1,4025 and max volume of week(15-19.12) is on the price 1,4028. Current week opened below max volume of the contract and max volume of previous week.Now the market is in a "sell zone", where we are looking for intraday positions to sell. On the chart you can see all max volumes of the days from previous week and max volumes of the contract. 1.Monday 2.Tuesday 3.Wednesday 4.Thursday 5.Friday 6.Contract and week. First short sell- sell from max volume of the contract to max volume of Friday.Why?Because market moves from one large volume to another.Market may make some big volume on 1,39 and gain back to max volume of the contract.If market will go under max volume of Friday, than its going to max volume of Monday and Tuesday.If they will go under max volumes of Monday and Tuesday, than our positions will be holded to old price of the contract 1,335. Other variant: if market will gain and make volume above price with max volume of the contract, our possible "buy" positions will be hold to max volume of the Thursday. http://savepic.ru/388951.png All zones of sales and purchases are specified. Further market movements will depend on a formation of new volumes.

--- 帖子 #80 ---
S&amp;P Market is now is "sale zone" because it opened below max volume of contract and last week(903). Today market opened lower max vol of Friday and on europe session market tested that price 887.But open sell position only when market goes below 881.25, comes back and rebounds from 881.25.That price is a resistance and we should sell below that.If the sale will be - market will go to max volume of monday-868.75 If Chicago session makes volume on 887(max volume of Friday) and gains from it the market may probably come back to 903(max volume of contract), but its risky, because trend is declining. Christmas holidays began and because of that on the market are low volumes. 1.Monday 2.Tuesday 3.Wednesday 4.Thursday 5.Friday 6.Contract and previous week http://savepic.ru/371562.png http://savepic.ru/349034.png

EUA pipsing In pipsing it is very important to understand simple rule-max volumes on the lows are buy positions, and on hights- sell positions.On the highest and lowest peaks insiders open big positions that reverses the market.So we just have to wait till this max volumes will be touched and market will rebound from them. On this chart we see how big players entered their positions on the low of the day: http://savepic.ru/350072.png http://savepic.ru/348024.png

--- 帖子 #82 ---
The best trades on pipsing -when big positions on the hights and lows stick together. For example on chart you see how at 10:15:15 big position of 107 lots appeared on the price 1,4206.Than at 10:16:19 we see 126 and 57 lots on 1,4205. Time interval- about minute.2 or 3 positions stick together on one price- that is very important level.Than we see how market touched this level and rebounded.Here we should buy. p.s. level-price with large volume. http://savepic.ru/371579.png http://savepic.ru/376699.png

Thanks for the charts Alex. I am new to Volume and still trying to understand how it can help. Looking at one of your earlier illustrations, can you help me understand how you would know whether you should buy or sell when you see high volume.

--- 帖子 #86 ---
It depends on what volume you consider.For example- on your picture we see how happens forming of max volume of an hour.Than next hour touches price with max volume and rebounds.Only next hour.It is really important.Volume, price and time.I don`t predict where will market go, but I make all my trades only in the same direction as trend goes.I have sell-zones and buy-zones I wrote about it.About for which time max volumes should be forming-I wrote too.

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Hi priceaction, I´am new to volume too, but I think its one -maybe the- key to trading. As far as I understand, you should look for this situation: If the price is going down, and volume is going up, there is a good chance for a long trade. Watch the change in the color of the candles Nr. 1 and Nr. 2, and compare the volume bar Nr. 1 and 2. Volume bars are rising, and price is changing direction. This is the point of entry. It is easy to spot this after it has happend. Hope its a correct explanation, but maybe this is not the right place for volume newbie discussion, because what alex is doing here, is real professional stuff Thanks for your postings alex, very good work

--- 帖子 #88 ---
I've been studying your stuff and working in volfix. I have a question though. If we buy or sell the pullback off of a max volume and there is no max volume to trade to, where is our target?

--- 帖子 #89 ---
i can only advise everybody to stick using targets. who i nthe world can determine how far price will go? you either limit your possible reward or even let a good trade turn into a loser..which in no way should happen. i would advise to use the following: close 50% of the position at 1.5x stop size (in case u use reasonable stops and not just fixed numbers) other 50% stop to b/e and then trailing down using a volatility based approach like ATR or shortterm price capture lines. let the market take you out by coming back to the trailing sl and do not close the trade at a fixed position.

--- 帖子 #90 ---
That makes sense. I couldn't think of anything else to do. I have been using the volume for the entry and a fibs for targets though. It works well.

--- 帖子 #91 ---
Hello Scotty B where can i find the volume histograme that you are using? Thank you

--- 帖子 #92 ---
You have to message alex at the address he provided. The volumes come from the futures market. There is no kind of quality volume data in MT4. I take the volume data from a different service and apply it to my chart.

--- 帖子 #93 ---
Ok thank you!

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Targets may be different- from closest large volumes, to some ammount of points.This question needs some examples- you can ask me in skype.

Yesterday morning I wrote analysis on s&amp;p 500 emini, about current situation.But I fogot it to post.Now you may watch it Max volumes of the contract: http://savepic.ru/382840.png 872-873 it is also max volume of week that was before previous. Max volume of current week= max volume of Monday: http://savepic.ru/369528.png Now we put this prices to week`s chart to analyse what may happen and how will we react: http://savepic.ru/370305.png In "Corridor" of these prices we do nothing.If the market falls under the price 868.50, it is necessary to look for sales.And above the price 873 will be short buys. Why short?Because above are volumes of last week which will be resistance for the market to gain. Here you should be very careful. That is how we understand what the trend is on the market right now.

--- 帖子 #96 ---
Current situation on s&amp;p : Current situation on S&amp;P: Yesterday, as well as it was supposed, in the market there was a negative background, all the day the market was in sale.Yesterday important levels were made.And from them we will look for market movements: http://savepic.ru/339585.png This is chart with important levels- max volumes from last week and max volumes of contract: http://savepic.ru/385664.png On the chart you see price ranges thanks to which we can indicate a trend. Such analysis is necessary do every day before the trading session begins.

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Yesterday I also wrote analysis on EUA: Now we see how it was yesterday morning: Sell from max volume of the contract 1.4025 to the price 1.39 - it was previous max volume of the contract. On Monday - European session: at 04:29 there was a sale with rebound from max volume of the contract 1,4025 and as the market goes from volume to volume they came to the price 1.39. During the Chicago session market made max volume of the day on 1.3955 has been generated, and at the price of 1.39 have made large volume of 983 lots, that is how on Monday they transffered max volume of the contract to the price 1.39. On Monday it was possible to hold position "sell" to first large volume- which was on 1,39.And they came to 1.39- opened there large positions, made this price- new price with max volume of contract and stopped declining trend. Tuesday has opened in the same price range as Monday, but in a "corridor" between 2 prices with max volumes of the contract. As the market is above max volume of the contract - it is in "buy zone", but if it is in a "corridor" of such volumes-we need first for market to get out of this corridor and than we will look for position to buy- nice oppoturnity to buy from 1,025.For sell- wee need market to break 1,39. On the chart you see volumes of last week (1,2,3,4,5 - on sequence of days of week),prices with max volumes of the contract and max volumes of Monday(22.12).With indicated zones for trades. Buy from 1.3955 (volume of Monday) to 2nd price with max volume of contract, or short sale from 1.3955 to the max volume of contract.I fmarket will decline- hold to 1.39, not against 1.39 http://savepic.ru/331394.png At volume counter you can see all the prices with max volumes of the contract.To the first two prices we pay our attention. http://savepic.ru/335737.png

--- 帖子 #98 ---
On Monday EUA made volume on 1.3965 and declined.It was possible to open "sell" position only from volume of Monday, the market "worked this price off" in touch and declined.As I already wrote- hold this position only to 1.39 (that day-it was a price with max volume of contract).As they did not break max volume of contract and rebound, they came back to volumes of Monday and Tuesday, and in that "narrow corridor" market finally formed enough volume to make 1.394- price with max volume of the conract(4040 lots). Situation on EUA market: Market is in "corridor" 1.4025-1.39 max volume of contract- 1.394 -short risky sell from price with max volume- 1.394 to 1.39 -sell under 1.39 -buy: only above 1.397(max volume of Wednesday) and hold till 1.4025 Till market is in corridor 1.39 -1.394 it`s better not to open any positions and wait. Markets are closed.Marry Christmas! http://savepic.ru/373416.png http://savepic.ru/363176.png

I noticed that even though forex doesn't have true volume, that if you look at the volume on a chart( I start out looking at vol. on a 60 min chart and work my way to down to 15 and 5 min charts, then a get a price range from the high volumes)...you can see that the range does act as sup/res... I will continue to look into this....very interesting.

--- 帖子 #101 ---
Thanks.On Futures and Securities are aviable volumes.That is basic thing for analysis in trading.That`s why I show people how to use volumes in trading.

--- 帖子 #102 ---
vol in relation to price bar spread is the only way to see supply &amp; demand in action and act accordingly. needs time to get understood &amp; mastered, but if, it is the most pleasuring way to trade and an approach to trade with in the direction of the least resistance, with the big boys. the vol of one brokers is of pretty low significance. there are times when it aligns with the composite vol but often enough it doesn't. u need at least the esignal gtis forex feed with tick vol to make reasonable assumptions.

--- 帖子 #103 ---
You are wright my friend.Feed is necessarible, like knowledge and experience.It would be very nice if people will share here their experience in trading by volumes.

Principle of a combination of Charts S&amp;P500 mini Here I will explain on example S&amp;P 500 emini what is combination of charts and how it helps in trading.Trading is constructed on three parametres (the price, volume and time) and I will show how to analyze the time periods: for example, we take the usual day chart, and we divide it into intervals of 60 minutes: http://savepic.ru/366295.png Imposing these hour intervals against each other, we can see "mood" of the market concerning the previous time periods and volumes. On an example of any days we will consider imposing on hours:17.12 we see that max volume of 10th hour is on the price 904, and 11th hour has gone above, that means that market is in a buy-zone so we shouldn`t sell: http://savepic.ru/375510.png If hour has gone below previous,it means we are looking for sell-positions, as is shown in a following example: http://savepic.ru/362198.png At 10th o'clock we will not buy, as previous hour (9-th) is above with reversing volume. The same principle is used for analyse of days -for definition of movement of the market within one day: http://savepic.ru/357078.png This day we are looking only for buy-positions, by analogy to hours, the same principle.

--- 帖子 #105 ---
Example of declining movement within day: http://savepic.ru/331478.png As day went under previous - only sales. Well, and actually week trend, all is advanced by an identical principle: http://savepic.ru/334550.png Nothing difficult.We put levels of last week, the corridor is formed. Over it we search for buy-positions, under it - sell. As to go against a trend it is not profitable. I hope that it will help more productively understanding the information which will be post here.Happy holidays!

--- 帖子 #106 ---
EUA pipsing Here for everyone to understand the principle of pipsing I post analysis of one day.For example 18.12, time from 5:00 till 9:00. I remind that it is necessary to catch only large volumes on one price, or single large positions of 100-120 lots or more. We use "take-profit" 10points, and "stop-loss" of 2-3 points depends on situation. The first large volume accumulations after 5:00: http://savepic.ru/381648.png Places to enter positions on tick bar chart: http://savepic.ru/373253.png http://savepic.ru/372432.png http://savepic.ru/354821.png Next large volume accumulations: http://savepic.ru/376528.png

next large volume accumulations: http://savepic.ru/364240.png and "working off" with "rebound" these large volumes, witch happend at lowest prices of the day: http://savepic.ru/386632.png it`s no use to continue, as all trades on pipsing are the same. I hope the principle is understood. I open positions by stop orders. Happy hollidays and protable year to everyone!

Friday EUA So, Friday on euro we had ready max volume of the current week on 1,392 and from this level market gave some chances to sell.Lets look how it was: http://savepic.ru/357969.png First time market did not break that price and declined at the beggining of asia trading session and the second time "rebound" from this price was on chocago trading session.No doubt second position is more interesting.I advise to use in such places stop-orders. http://savepic.ru/356945.png

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Yen. Logic of trade of yen is the same, as on euro futures. We will consider Friday(2.01) from last week. Max volume of week: http://savepic.ru/334417.png Than we will see max volume of previous trading day (31.12), as 1.01 trading session was closed: http://savepic.ru/333393.png As a result market is in a sell-zone, as it is under max volume of the week. http://savepic.ru/388704.png Market did not break max volume of previous day and declined.

--- 帖子 #112 ---
EUA After 2 week volume accumulation, euro futures have made max volume of contract- on 1,39 - that has shown us the further direction of the market. Strong movement of the market for sale has occurred today in a consequence of long accumulation of volume in a small price range.Such movements start from prices with large volume, as 1.39 is(more than 5000 lots) and usually shows trend for next week or more. Volumes of last week: http://savepic.ru/328289.png Max volume of the contract: http://savepic.ru/329313.png On the chart it looks like that: http://savepic.ru/360037.png And as a result sell from maximal volume of contract, - declining trend, we will wait for new volume accumulations. At present time max volume of day is on the price 1, 3649: http://savepic.ru/349797.png As you can see- to that price market shows heightened interest as some hours trades in a close price range: http://savepic.ru/336485.png This price will be basic for tomorrow, and it will be possible to try to open position from it.

S&amp;P Let's look at a current situation: Last week was actievly gaining, and Friday closed at level 928-927.75 where was formed new max volume of the week (previous was 904): http://savepic.ru/369249.png Let's consider more in details as levels 928 and 927.75 on Friday were formed. At the closing of the Chicago trading session, there is a fixation of profits and losses of all trades on the market, that means that at the end of the trading session happens closing of positions, and partly- opening. On Friday the picture was following: http://savepic.ru/348775.png Max volume of the day is in this range. These 2 prices will serve as basic level for movement of Monday, it is possible to buy only above them. Situation in the market is following: http://savepic.ru/349799.png At present moment market is in a corridor of last week, we will wait for an exit in some way to understand the trend, and some trades from intraday max volumes.

--- 帖子 #116 ---
GC(GOLD) Yesterday, on Monday- there was a good example of market movements from one large volume to another.We take maximal volumes of two last weeks.During two weeks market has formed a "corridor" of prices with large volumes: http://savepic.ru/384631.png http://savepic.ru/332406.png One of the most important principles of market movements is that the market moves from one large volume to another.That is a key for position trading.

--- 帖子 #117 ---
S&amp;P Yesterday (7.01) was a nice example of the market technically "working off" of the prices with max volumes. The first thing that I want you to pay your attention- large volumes after holidays. Pay attention that during 1 day only on one price the volume &gt;70 000 lots is accumulated: Volume of Monday 05.01: http://savepic.ru/394661.png Max volume of Tuesday 6.01: http://savepic.ru/400805.png On a day combo-chart you see that Monday and Tuesday traded in a close price range. http://savepic.ru/442808.png After rebound from low of the "corridor"( 925.75- max volume of Monday) the market went to the sell-zone, as it couldn`t break such large volumes above. Trend is declining and Chicago Session gives opportunity to open position intraday. Intraday volumes in clusters( 60 min): http://savepic.ru/402872.png Max 60 min volume of the day - is maximal volume of 9th hour - 30120 lots ( 105 mln $). Market after forming volume in 9th hour gained from it, 10th and 11th were above max volume of 9th hour, so we should sell only below max volume of 9th hour, as it is resistance fro makret to decline.No buy positions- as trend is declining.In such cases its better to wait till market in an hour or two forms new max volumes and shows good "position sell". Exactly that happened.10th and 11th hours made max volumes on the prices 914 and 915.50, and pushed market down by trend: http://savepic.ru/433595.png On the chart you see how market went down from 914 on sell breaking max volume of 9th hour.In the first case you shouldn`t open sell position, because max volume of previous 15 min is lower than current price on the market- that is risk.

Tuesday traded below Monday, and Wednesday in a range of Monday, bacause of that on these prices accumulated maxamal volume of the current week. On the image I have indicated the further movements of the market, and levels from which it is necessary to enter into the market.

yen Lets look how happened yesterday's trade on "buy" and continuation of the today's. Basically all powerful movements goes either from a contract price, or from volumes of weeks- from the prices on which the large volume is accumulated. As has occurred yesterday. Volume of current week: http://savepic.ru/439736.png And a beautiful enter at the beggining of the session: http://savepic.ru/424378.png On a day combo-chart the situation becomes more clear: http://savepic.ru/410042.png You see 4 moments of entering positions after rebound from max volume of the week; max volumes of all days, except wednesday are below- the do not resist the market to gain.Buy position only above max volume of Wednesday with s/l at the opening price.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Example of importance of large positions- big volumes. What actually are large tick volumes?- Big positions of traders on the floor, people "in system"- insiders, trading robots or someone else who knows where market will go wright now.Importance of such volumes can easily be seen- when market cant break the price with large position, it rebounds and go in other way. Today on s&amp;p on the low appeared the biggest position of the day 2966 lots (about 10 mln $ position).This is what pushes the market, not technical analysis, not waves, or whatever. http://savepic.ru/433590.png http://savepic.ru/430518.png

Current EUA Today market made new large max volume of contract and on news(unemployment) declined.After market couldnt break max volume of yesterday- and went under max volume of contract which is more then 5000 lots- it declined; no resistance.

EUA Friday 9/01/2009 Friday opened under max volumes of previous day(Thursday) which were on 1,3695/1,3698/1,3696. All time market was uder previous day`s max volumes- it means we are in a sell-zone; but at 7:30(Chicago time) will be announced important news about unenployment.On that news I dont advise to trade.Market tried few times to break max volumes of previous day but it couldn`t.That confirms a sale on market.But on the prices 1,365/1,3648/1,3645 we see that market made new max volume of contract.From that volumes we always see strong market moves.So we have a corridor of prices in which I advise not to do anything. On the chart red is Thursday with its max volumes and white chart is Friday, green lines- max volumes of contract. http://savepic.ru/453088.png Max volumes of contract: http://savepic.ru/458208.png Max volumes of Thursday: http://savepic.ru/442848.png And about situation that I noticed in previous post: We have 2 max volumes of hours on one price 1,3485.That is a good level to trade from.Trend is declining- so in the next hour we wait for market to rebound from that price, and than we will sell.That price is important.But what should we do if price drifts above or important level and than goes below again.Is it "rebound"?On the chart we see that first market drifted 1,3485 about 13 pips above- that`s too much, we shouldn`t trade in this case; second time market drifted 1,3485 for about 6 pips and went down- that is risky too, but risk is much lower and we may trade in this case. http://savepic.ru/428512.png

GBP/BPA I will post here trades and analysis of pound. This week was indicative in respect of exact inputs from large volumes. Volumes of last week: http://savepic.ru/455167.png Max volumes of all contract: http://savepic.ru/456191.png Like you see easy input from volume of last week, has given pure pass to contract levels: http://savepic.ru/404980.png After market has shown buy-position from max volume of Monday 1,45 longterm buy is confirmed ( only to max volumes of contract- this is an example of buy position below max volumes of contract as strong declining movement has already been from that volume and market is far from it, and also volume that may reverse the market was formed(volume of week)).

Situation on euro futures. After Friday news makret has appeared under max volumes of contract and max volumes of current week: http://savepic.ru/417276.png http://savepic.ru/414204.png Base levels for the next week are: http://savepic.ru/441608.png We will trade from levels of current week (see above), and from prices with max volume of contract. In a corridor of week to enter into the market it is not recommended.

Hey man...Thanks for the update. So we are starting the week in a short bias, regarding EUR. I suppose we'll wait to see a bounce off of one of last weeks highs. My fibs are in agreement for more shorts. We'll see what happens. Scotty B

Alex, Does volfix shows the volume for Swiss, Canadian and Aussie dollars ?

--- 帖子 #131 ---
yes.

Of course we will see.Good trading Day!=)

GBP/BPA Current situation: Today market opened below max volume of Friday and went under max volume of contract 1,502.Now it is in a corridor on max volumes of contract: we will wait till it breaks this corridor.The best way- it goes under 1,49 comes back, rebounces and declines, like at 2:25-2:27 with 1,502 price. Max volumes of contract: http://savepic.ru/426244.png http://savepic.ru/418052.png Grey line- max volume of today.

--- 帖子 #134 ---
Logic of actions today is simple. On Friday powerful levels were generated: http://savepic.ru/425220.png Today we are under Friday, and from these levels will try to sell(as trend is declining): http://savepic.ru/417031.png Or, if the market breaks Friday levels and starts to gain from it, we will try to buy there (but low- lots postition as it against trend- risky).

--- 帖子 #135 ---
Importance of intraday volumes. I have already mansioned about importance of max volumes of hours that stand close to each other, or even on one price.Example: On Friday on the bottom of the day market stayed in one price range during 2 hours(13:00-15:00), and max volumes of that hours are close to each other- 1,3395 and 1,34.These prices is a level for us to trade in next hour, as you see market gained from it in next hour.Such important levels are usually "worked off" in next few days. http://savepic.ru/439568.png On the chart you see these prices and how market traded today from them.You see that market tried to break them through many times but it couldn`t.It rebounced.Very good levels to put there limit orders with low loses and significant returns The market always confirms importance of volumes in a kind of "rebounce". http://savepic.ru/424208.png

Hi alex, great thread. Just tryin to understand it a bit more. So u are waiting for price to confirm the sentiment around a high volume area and then trading with that? It sounds like u basically know where the big players are going is this correct? Also where do u get these charts and currencys from?

--- 帖子 #137 ---
Some interesting information of today`s pipsing on S&amp;P .On this instrument I put a min volume 500 lots in tick cluster and wait for at least 3 positions stick together on one price, but it must be on lows or at hights.For example market strongly declined and on the lows you see big position- that`s someone reversing the market.Big positions of "Big traders" are seen very good by tick volumes: http://savepic.ru/419091.png http://savepic.ru/424211.png http://savepic.ru/422163.png http://savepic.ru/425235.png

Yes.With the time comes understanding what big players do with the market, because they are acting mostly in the same ways I post here futures on currencies- it`s a security instrument that follows spot market, and charts I take from a program I use.

Current situation for euro(EUR/USD) futures. I already showed levels of the last week, as well as it was supposed, the market is in a zone of sales, but have not allowed to enter from week levels. We will consider possible market situations and the prices from which it is possible to trade: The nearest levels to trade from for us are only volumes of current week, we will focus on them: http://savepic.ru/425238.png And also the bottom border we can advance, when we will look on cluster chart with previous day: http://savepic.ru/458027.png On the price 1, 33 the volume of 1151 lots is accumulated, that`s a lot. Possible variants of market movements: http://savepic.ru/443691.png At the first approaches to the bottom border of a corridor - 1, 33 it will be possible to try to short with SL at the opening price. Till market will not break 1, 338 - there won`t be any good opportunities to open long position, a trend is completely negative.

--- 帖子 #141 ---
S&amp;P Monday, unfortunately has not "worked off" levels of Friday, but has generated the levels, base for trading on Tuesday: http://savepic.ru/403755.png On cluster chart you may see yesterday's intraday max olumes accumulations( max volumes of hours) - behind these prices are hiden not only money, but interest of "big traders". The corridor from these prices will serve us as a reference point for today: http://savepic.ru/408875.png Buy-zones and sell-zones -as usually: under and over a "corridor". That that is represented on the chart - three possible variants of behaviour of the market from determined prices. We will observe. By the way skype chat "Trading Based on Volumes" is already working- wellcome

--- 帖子 #142 ---
While I was writing previous post, the market came to 1, 33 and jumped aside from that price.Short: http://savepic.ru/433450.png Half of this position you should cover on max volume of today: http://savepic.ru/438569.png Then put your Stop/loss at the opening pice.At worst you will not lose anything.

--- 帖子 #143 ---
As I also wrote earlier if market will go under 1, 49 - sales. The maximum volume of the last week is generated on the price 1,52 and also in this range are situated a lot of important prices with max volumes of week(1, 515... 1, 521....): http://savepic.ru/414998.png Only one volume accumulation in the bottom of the last week is on the price 1, 459 which has been generated for Monday-Tuesday. Max volume of the contract is on the price 1, 502: http://savepic.ru/402710.png Overall situation on the chart and one position of about 40-50points from max volume, accumulated on the bottom of last week: http://savepic.ru/395565.png Such long positions are risky, because against a trend. And nevertheless the market jumps aside from such levels as "ball".

--- 帖子 #144 ---
EUA(eurusd) As trend is declining we are looking for a position to sell.Max volume of the day is formed on the price 1,3263 (1322 lots).That will be a base level to short.Market rebounds and we short. http://savepic.ru/444716.png http://savepic.ru/445740.png

YEN The trend on yen is positive, on Monday max volume of contract pushed the market higher, and now market is over it. Max volume of contract: http://savepic.ru/436502.png Max volume of week that was before previous 29. 12 - 2. 01, is the same as max volume of contract: http://savepic.ru/435478.png The volume of last week was generated for Thursday-Friday on the price 1, 095. Now we will consider logic of movements of the market in the nearest future. Price with max volume of contract is basic reference point for market movement, moreover it serves as a place of a possible input in the market, we will pay all our attention to this price: http://savepic.ru/431407.png Concerning the last week, the market is in a buy-zone, therefore if market won`t break the contract price down, means it will be possible to try to enter a long position, but you should be careful as market has already gained. If there will be a return situation, short sales from volume of the contract to volume of the last week are possible.

--- 帖子 #148 ---
GC(Gold) Last week market mostly stayed in one close price range and formed volume on such prices: http://savepic.ru/396796.png Max volumes of contract: http://savepic.ru/400892.png So we have such base levels to trade. 12.01( Monday) market opened below max volume of contract- a sell-zone.Market broke 848 which was second max volume of previous week and only one resistance for market to decline, and after it came back and rebounced from 848- it finally declined. http://savepic.ru/454958.png

--- 帖子 #149 ---
Hi Alex, I see that u also work with cluster tick chart to see big volume positions, but i don't understend the way to identify if these levels are sell or buy positions. Now i'm trying the volfix platform and on cluster chart i see that it can be show also volume with delta, it's that useful to verify the side of big positions? Thanks. Lubo

--- 帖子 #150 ---
I dont understand the system but seems to be good

--- 帖子 #151 ---
u cannot verify if its sell order buy orders, even tough there's delta. if the information was that legitimate, it wouldnt be a problem to make winnder after winner. it is enough to know where the big positions are. when price comes back to those areas watch for reactions and price actions. if all the big positions are bilt below crrent price we can assume it to be longs. since the professional traders are very greedy, they come back to retest those areas and buy/sell some more before starting the move.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
Alex, On post 148, u showed 2 volume picture of GC. What is the difference between them and how do u use them in yr trading ?

--- 帖子 #153 ---
I don`t advise people to trade with the help of delta, its too tricky- you should consider only quantity of volume.

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Everything is simple- cathing prices with biggest positions and join the movement.

--- 帖子 #155 ---
For example- today is Monday 12.01: What do we do before trading?We should find important levels from which to trade.We check max volume of previous week(5.01-9.01) and see that it is on the prices 854, 848- we put them on chart.Then we check max volume of all contract- it s on the prices 855, 850- we put them on the chart.What do we have?- corridor of prices in which its dangerous to trade.848 - it is a lowest border of our corridor and 855- highest border.When the price break up 855, comes back to 855 and rebound we will open long position.But if the market will go under all that prices- comes back and rebound from 848 ar even 850- it is ure short because resistance is broken and you see that trend is declining.

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Alex, Just to confirm. In your daily trading, u're trading currency futures or spot FX ?

--- 帖子 #157 ---
HI, this is my analisys on GBP/USD of price actions on volume. Lubo

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Alex, Forgive for asking stupid question. What is the difference between the 2 volume chart ? One is max volume of last week and max volume of all contract ? What is their significant difference ?

--- 帖子 #159 ---
LuboLabo: u are ding really good. Today`s situation on GBP What do we have today- the closest pric from max volumes of contract - is 1,455- by the way today market may make on it new max volume of contract, that tell us about new possible strond movement, and max volume of previous day on 1,4548. http://savepic.ru/424240.png Situation from 1:00 am to 3:00am Chicago time: As market couldn`t break these two prices with large volumes- it gained, but we are under max volume of contract so this long position contains risk. http://savepic.ru/423216.png Situation from 3 to 4:00 am: Then market went below that prices, rebounded and there was a good opportunity to short- as no resistance was below. http://savepic.ru/407856.png Situation from 4:00 to 5:00 From 3 to 4:00 market formad max volume of this hour on the price 1,4515(green line on the chart).An starting from 4 o`clock market climbed on that volume and went closely to max volume of previous day, though haven`t touched it.So max volume of this hour is a resisance for market to decline, I would short only below it. http://savepic.ru/453939.png http://savepic.ru/457011.png

--- 帖子 #160 ---
Hour from 5:00 to 6:00 Hour 4-5:00 made volume on the price 1,4533(yellow line) and from that price gained and even broke through max volume of previous day: http://savepic.ru/443699.png http://savepic.ru/449843.png So 1,4533 is a resistance for the market to decline too.As you see best trades happen when no intraday volumes resist for the market movement.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Hi Alex_S ! I'm very intrested about your methodology and try to understand it. On BPA we have a max volume for today a 1,4515. I think we are in a corridor between yesterday max volume and today max volume. As far as I understand it mean we have to wait the break of this corridor to take a position, am I right ? but buy zone is against the trend as we are behind Max volume of contract so caution ...

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Please advise if you see anything wrong. Legends: 10% volume range, I pick the top 10 prices which form 10% of total volume to create a range. As a result, we have: Red lines - Jan 12 10% volume range Yellow lines - Jan 13 10% volume range Range: 129.42/130.50 1) Price starts within range 2) minor reversal at top of range 3) After the 3rd attempt to break range, it attempts to reach Jan 12's range 4) After failed to reach, retrace back to lower range of 129.42 5) Rebound to top range 130.50 and create a range trading after

--- 帖子 #163 ---
I've try a long a 1,4557 as it makes a double bottom on 1 min chart above the corridor ... Is that ok ? EAprogrammer where do you find your informations about GBPJPY volume please ?

--- 帖子 #164 ---
I have an EA to collect tick volume, still need some manual process to merge all data. Once complete, will post to this thread. Also, included the latest GBPJPYm5 chart Added: It is hard to believe the intraday volume is that strong. Additional GBPJPYm5 to show.

--- 帖子 #165 ---
EAprogrammer, So, you must be extrapolating a change in volume at each tic as a proxy for tic volume... since that doesn't really exist in MT4? I would be interested in seeing if that MT4 information would be as valuable as Alexs' information, since his is based on real futures trading information. When I first read this thread several weeks ago, I too wanted to start writing a windows based program based on tic data, but have been unable to find that type of raw information. The extrapolation would be cake for a number crunching program. To be able to have this type of volume information at your fingertips is actually very powerful and very few people use volume for trading, and have dismissed volume as useless. But as can be seen by Alex, it is one of the more powerful, non-indicator price based indicators that I've seen, when price is connected to volume. Carl PS. If you'd be willing, I would like to use your EA as an input to a windows based analyzer. We could even feed real-time tic's for continuous analysis. I have a thread in the programming section of FF for a windows based basket trade analysis program if you would like to see my previous work.

--- 帖子 #166 ---
Yes.Everything is correct.But if look in my previous post you will see that I wrote about new price with max volume.If you see that market is making new max volume of contract- be careful that day.This happened today- no serious movements, just volume formation.And finally we have new price with maximal volume of contract- 1,455 http://savepic.ru/446784.png

--- 帖子 #167 ---
Volume shows interest of the market to some price.One thing is price with biggest volume of some week and another price with max volume of all contract. Yes I trade futures.But it is not a problem to trade such way on fx.Soon synthetic instrument will be made.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
Alex, Do u do swing trading that last few days to weeks in trade position ? What would you recommend to see in volume for swing trading ? So far, i assume your analysis is based on intraday trading.

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Large volumes- weeks, contract.It is a base to stand in market for a long time.Maximal time I was holding position 3 days. Todays levels contract+previous day on GBP http://savepic.ru/424280.png Max volumes of contract- the most important prices: http://savepic.ru/422232.png

Alex, Volfix is the most powerful tool I have ever seen. I really appreciate your explanations. I actually made some money using the new EURUSD Synthetic charts. Very impressive. Thanks for your teachings. Carl

EUA Today`s trade on eua(uer/usd).Today we had: max volume of the contract- 1,3145 and 1,314: http://savepic.ru/399723.png Max volume of yesterday- on the price 1,314 too. http://savepic.ru/444778.png These are base prices for trading today.Situation of today.Hour by hour. 6:00-7:00 a.m. Chicago time: http://savepic.ru/431466.png This hour did not give any trade.No rebound from significant volumes. But this houre formed max volume on the price 1,3085: http://savepic.ru/419178.png That volume will be moving market next hour.So we put it on the chart.Market may climb above 1,3085 come back to it and rebound- but we won`t open long position in this case- against trend.market may also go under 1,3085 rebound from it and decline.That would be a risky short too, because volume of 6-7:00 hour is low to trade from it and be sure; and you see that there was no rebound from max volume of contract and max volume of yesterday.We will wait. Hour from 7:00 to 8:00 http://savepic.ru/407914.png Market gained from max volume of previous hour(1,3085) to max volume of contract and previous day(1,314-1,3145)- on the chart you may even see a rebound, but If you short here you should understand that you sell against max volume of previous hour that adds a risk to your trade.Usually most of trades in a period of one hour are closed in next hour.That`s why you should always consider max volume of previous hour.Actually it rebouced from important level, so if u shorted here- some money market gave you.

--- 帖子 #173 ---
Max volume of this hour is on the price- 1,3132: http://savepic.ru/450925.png This price will be important too- we put it on the chart(green line): Next hour 8:00-9:00 http://savepic.ru/449901.png Market went under max volumes of contract and previous day, came back and rebounced from that prices.When after rebound it went under max volume of previous hour - we short, nothing resist for the market to decline.Sure move - to max volume of hour before previous.There you may put your take profit, or cover a half of your position on that price, as it is a first resistance.

Today`s analysis of BPA/GBP Max volumes of the contract: http://savepic.ru/428398.png Max volumes of previous day: http://savepic.ru/427374.png These prices we put on the chart- we will look for trades from prices to which market showed the biggest interest. http://savepic.ru/432494.png We had 3 situations today where we could enter the market: http://savepic.ru/420206.png Now I will show them in dateils.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
Situation number 1: Market rebounded from 1,456-1,4564.Max volumes of previous hours are on prices: http://savepic.ru/422254.png You see that market formed max volumes of hours in the same places- you see 2 pairs of max volumes in the same price ranges.It tells us about importance of prices with this volumes during today.If I put them on the chart (lines with grey colour) we will have such picture: http://savepic.ru/403822.png If we open long position after rebound from max volume of contract+max volume of yesterday we should open it only above max volumes of hours that I mansioned before, as intraday volumes may resist.Or we may take have little t/p going from one volume to another- but I don`t like it.Better to open long position after market broke prices with these volumes, broke resistance- this movement is more sure and it has given good money. Example why should not we stand against intraday volumes: Next hour market came back to prices with max volume of contract and rebounced from them, but we have max volumes of hours above.So market rebounced from max volume of contract came to intraday volumes, rebounced from them and went below contract prices.That`s why it is a risky. http://savepic.ru/395630.png Situation number 2: Situation similar to today`s situation on EUA: Market broke max volumes o contract+yesterday and formed some volumes below.We will see this volumes- max volumes of hours: http://savepic.ru/453985.png They are important.Expesially is important 1,453(green line)- here during 6 minutes appeared a volume- biggest of the day- 782 lots, that`s really a lot on this market,that is annomally big position, that must be a person with valuable information, because his position is much bigger than usual max volume of all day on this instrument. This volume appeared after rebound from max volume of contract+yesterday.So if you shorted here you should have closed with profits after appearance of annomally big position.Noone knows where he will pull the market. http://savepic.ru/449889.png

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Importance of this big position you may have observed a bit later, in a next hour, after market could not break down this price and rebounded.That guy is really big http://savepic.ru/428385.png With the help of such guys market broke max volume of contract+yesterday. Situation number 3: http://savepic.ru/430433.png So market went above max volume of contract+yesterday.It comes back to these prices and rebounds from them.Same situation as 1st.If you want- you may pips from one volume to another- but I don`t like it.Also it`s time of changing trading sessions on the board of trade, so market just bounced between intraday volumes and contract levels.Nothing interesting.Long position only above intraday volumes(grey lines-look first situation). And what do we have next: http://savepic.ru/420193.png Market broke intraday volumes, came back to them and rebounced, it shows us importance of intraday max volumes-max volumes of hours and gives opportunity to enter sure long position with good t/p, as nothing does resist.Don`t forget to make your trades by the trend.

--- 帖子 #177 ---
S&amp;P index On index you may see these days very big volumes.For example 14.01 market made during the day on the price 838 the volume of 105000 lots(!!!), such volume during previous contract market was making for a week or two. http://savepic.ru/446822.png Also we have formed max volume of week: http://savepic.ru/423276.png At present time it is powerful level for movement. Long positions- to volume of Monday and Tuesday: http://savepic.ru/440678.png The variant on sale is possible, but if Friday opens over the max volume of week, and over present day volume, that is a high probability of long positions to top levels.

--- 帖子 #178 ---
EUA(eur/usd) On euro futures max volume of contract is moved to the price 1,3145: http://savepic.ru/393583.png Now this price is basic in the market, further a trend will be developed from a contract price to volume of Monday and to the rating price 1,365: http://savepic.ru/410982.png From this price it`s possible that market may be pulled to the prices 1, 2 ***. We will observe the situation.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
YEN Today`s speculative trade on yen market. You see large volume accumulation.During two hours market traded in close price range and fromed max volumes of hours closely to each other. Prices with these volumes are very important for the market, and we may trade from them. http://savepic.ru/403835.png http://savepic.ru/402811.png Next hour market approved importance of these volumes and rebounded from that prices.This long position is quite risky, it has just speculative character.

Hi Alex, Hi Crod, What is the new Synthetic instrument or charts? Are the same? Do I have on volfix too? Lubo.

--- 帖子 #181 ---
Synthetic instrument- instrument between spot price and volumes from futures.Noone has it in Volfix now.

--- 帖子 #182 ---
Ok , there's a Synthetic Spot/Future tool project on volfix? It would be great!! I think the charts are the same on futures and spot but differer in price for some points. U can see the futures with spot quotations and relative forward point on CME website here http://equivalentswdc.cme.com:443/index.html . Lubo

--- 帖子 #183 ---
S&amp;P Index is definetly the most liquid and technical instrument for trading.It "works off" large intraday volumes very well.For example we take yesterday.One of main hours on s&amp;p when max volume is formed for following movement of the market is 9th hour.Yesterday all 9th hour market traded in a close price range- it formed a volume, and on cluster chart we see that max volumes for that preriod are on the prices (846,75-848 we take volumes starting from 15000 lots). http://savepic.ru/408717.png On the chart you see period of time from 9:00 to 10:00 is violet, and from 10:00 to 11:00 is green: http://savepic.ru/399501.png So when 9th hour finished, we have its max volumes, which will be base prices for next hour or two, and declining trend.Next hour opened below volumes of previous and came back to the prices with max volumes and rebounded from them.As market could not break them it was possible to short in first half of 10th hour.

OIL This week market gave an excellent trade on Oil, based on market movement from maximum volume of all contract: Prices with max volume of contract: http://savepic.ru/398499.png On the chart you see how market tried to break prices with max volumes, but it couldn`t, and declined.Nice chance to short.On such reactions to prices with biggest money accumulations is based my strategy of trading by volumes. http://savepic.ru/435364.png Volume of current week is on the price 38, so that price will be main for market movements next week.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
BPA/GBP This week was an example of a turn of the market after formation of new volumes. After market declined, on the 12th and 13th the market has calmed down and generated large volume, and in the end of a trading session there was a long position from generated volume. The prices with max volume of contract: http://savepic.ru/442531.png Volume of current week(12-16.01): http://savepic.ru/449699.png We have a corridor from 2 prices with max volumes of contract (the first picture with volume counter) which borders will be indicating the further direction of the market: http://savepic.ru/400550.png After market has accumulated volume of week, on the 15th of January market gave a nice trade- long position, at which we will look more in details: This trade is based on market movements from prices with max volumes of contract and weeks, after these volumes have been formed. Here works "steps" principle- when market stands and rebounces on important prices one by one.This trade is also showed in previous posts -15th of January. http://savepic.ru/420025.png One of signs of long position: you look the nearest volume for the small period, for example a present day. Volume of a present day (15.01): http://savepic.ru/418979.png As soon as the market has stand on volume of day, it is mainly in a buy-zone, concerning this volume, further the market stands and rebounds from a contract price, and then from volume of current week.After it has broken all resistance, we buy. Such is the logic of trading by volumes. Nothing should resist to your position.

Hi Alex_S. Volfix seems not working for today intraday volume, maybe because I am on demo only ... Do you know other free software to have intraday volume and especially with volume by price ? thank you

--- 帖子 #188 ---
My Volfix too, but now it work again, maybe some problem on server, i think also cause Volfix is a platform in development too. It's right Alex? There are other platform with volume by price, but not like this, almost of those draw volume line by price on chart. See X Trader, one of famous, but the most of blasonate have this tool. Lubo

--- 帖子 #189 ---
Demo version does not show you realtime data from 7:30 to 15:15 Chicago time.I don`t know free software showing real volumes.

--- 帖子 #190 ---
Read please previous post.If you use other software check volumes on CME site, are they the same or not.It is in development but it works without problems- I think you use demo version. By the way today was a nice day on EUA, will show it tomorrow in details.

Yes. There is a synthetic EURO on volfix. I checked price and movement on my MT4 for IBFX. It's about as accurate as you can get. The EURO futures prices are off by about 20 pips (as when I checked them), due to the nature of "futures", you'll pay interest, etc. Remember that the nearest EURO futures contract is March, so that is why you have to use the synthetic prices for spot FX.

--- 帖子 #192 ---
Yes, I know that, I'm using Volfix too. But these is not the tool which Alex speaks about. It's a tool that allow in Volfix to have spot price.. that is in development. For more info ask to Alex. Lubo

--- 帖子 #193 ---
Yes futures prices differs from spot prices, though it does not disturb the process of equal movements of these markets.I talked about synthetic instrument, which has price from spot market and correct volumes from futures- on the needed prices.You can`t see it now on Volfix, you may see there only futures.

EUA(EUR/USD) 19.01 analysis On holiday the market opened above max volume of Friday and max volume of contract: Max volume of Friday: http://savepic.ru/438484.png http://savepic.ru/403668.png Max volumes of contract at the beginning of Monday were on the prices 1,3145/1,32/1,34- same as max volumes of previous week. Market moved to price with max volume of Friday- 1,3227, broke it, then pullback+rebound.As we are above max volume of contract we don`t sell here.After that market made max volume of contract on 1,32 broke it, then pullback+rebound.We short here as it will go by trand.Our target is 1,3145- next price with max volume of contract.But in the middle of way during 1,5 hours market made a large volume of 910 lots on the price 1,3165.Anomally big volume that may reverse the market- so it`s a sygnal for us to cover at least a half of our position. http://savepic.ru/446679.png After that market reached 1,3145 and made there max volume of contract, which was a base price for trading today. http://savepic.ru/440535.png http://savepic.ru/439511.png

EUA Tick volumes What to do when market is situated in a free place?When there is no volumes of previous day behind and no max volumes of contract.Usually such situations appear after strong market movements.Logic tells us that it`s not a good time for trading, because market may stay in one price range till it hasn`t formed some volume and that is true.But on the other side there is a good chance to open your position together with volumes that stops market.So for example we will take yesterday: On Monday and Tuesday market strongly declined and yesterday we had only max volume of Tuesday to trade from it 1,292.But all positions from that level had a bit more risk than usually- as we understood that to reverse the market it needs to be much more volume in this place- on the price 1,292 market may stay all day to create there volumes for further movements.All rebounds from this price were only technical reaction of the market and did not sygnale about any significant movements. http://savepic.ru/414734.png

--- 帖子 #201 ---
For example after market opened yesterday, it declined: and then on the lows we see that 2 positions of 50 and 60 lots apeared- they stay together. http://savepic.ru/395265.png

--- 帖子 #202 ---
Positions appeard on the low of the day(by that time) at the time 1:48 http://savepic.ru/396289.png So we put this price with these positions on the chart- it is 1,2885 and will try to open long position after pullback+rebounce. http://savepic.ru/394241.png After market rebound I open long positions.I call it pipsing because 4-5 pips it gives always at least, then depends on situation you should cover all position or a half.

--- 帖子 #203 ---
How to enter the market using tick volumes: We look for large positions that stick together- as such levels are the most reliable and wait rebound from them.What is rebound- this is pullback, when market tries to break important price, but it can`t, and it goes in another direction. Of course we should consider such large volumes: Max volume of the day Max volume of the week Max volume of the contract Noy to stand "against" such important prices and trade by trand. http://savepic.ru/451589.png Large accumulation of positions of tick volumes on one pice usually reverses the market. Large positions are cautched - Pullback+rebound: http://savepic.ru/442373.png

--- 帖子 #204 ---
EUA(EUR/USD) For example we will take yesterday: The biggest positions from tick volumes appeared from 9:00 to 10:00(Chicago time) in the price range- 1,2933-1,2947.That was annomally large positions- about 100-200 lots in one tick. http://savepic.ru/402462.png So we may divide yesterday`s trading session in 2 parts- period of formation of large volumes and trading from them. http://savepic.ru/405534.png So after such large volumes appeared we wait till reaction of the market will be understood.On the prices 1,2937- 1,294 market made biggest volumes of the day and max volume of the day on the price 1,294- 3086 lots- very big. http://savepic.ru/395294.png After market formed this volumes and went up we wait.Market came back and rebounded from all important prices.Reaction is understood- we open long position. http://savepic.ru/394270.png

--- 帖子 #205 ---
On EUR/USD market situation was equal- price difference 8 pips between futures and spot market.Movements are same.Max volume of the day on 1,2948: http://savepic.ru/399390.png

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Current situation on EUA(EUR/USD) on 1,292-1,294 market may make max volume of conract. What happened today.Exactly same principle as I mansioned before- appeared the largest positions 100-200 lots on tick volumes(biggest positions in 1 tick) and that guys will pull the price somwhere.As market declined from 1,292 and 1,294 we are in a sell-zone, we put prices with these big traders in the chart and wait for reaction of the market.There is always a period of time when volume is accumulated, and there is period of time when market trades from it.When we have a lot of positions in some price range- market usually rebounds from each of them- in a kind of "steps" ao goes below them all, then comes back and rebounds from the lowest position.In such cases I short. http://savepic.ru/407572.png http://savepic.ru/406548.png

Yesterday`s trade on s&amp;p Intraday trading based on market movements between max volumes of hours.One important rule: never open long position under max volume of previous 15 min, and never short above max volume of previous 15 minutes.After 11th hour finished- 12th hour(from 12:00p.m. to 13:00 p.m.)will trade from max volume of 11th hour. http://savepic.ru/457784.png Max volumes of hours: http://savepic.ru/437304.png Buy only above max volume of Tuesday - 825, as main days of the week on s&amp;p market are Tuesday and Wednesday- their volumes are very important for Thursday and Friday.Open long position in 12th hour after pulback by buy stop order.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Today I will tell you about trades from max volume of the contract.We will consider EURO but at the same principle are trading all markets, depends only on the size of volume. There is nothing hard, we wait for large accumulation of volume(5k) from beginning of the contract.We look for first 5000 lots in All prices. As soon as appeares such quantity of lots, we will pay our attention to that price.Then we analyse the market - the trend: look for volume of week and volumes of previous days and we look for intraday volumes for the exact entering the market.What should we do: We look the first week of the contract and if it is necessary the second,look for the day when 5000 were made(it may be 5300 or 5500 even). Also we need volume of week, volume of day, and the basic levels of the day when 5k was made.

--- 帖子 #210 ---
To catch large players easier when new contract begins and new volumes appeares.We look for price with max volume, and that max volume must be large enough.Then big players that certanly are in this volume are pulling the price really far.This contracts first 5000 was on 1,39.You may look a lot of contracts in history to make sure that it is a rule.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
Let's take this contract.... In All Prices look for period 11.12.2008 - 02.01.2009(from the date when new contract began to the date when 5000 lots were made - 2.01): We see that first price(price with max vol) is 1.392, the second 1.394,1.39, 1.3915 - these prices are main for us. We put them on the chart. We put these 4 prices on the chart, and also we put on the chart price with max volume of week and day(2.01) - as a rule in such trades they are identical.Then look in cluster chart with interval 60 min and date 2.01.2009.Till 11:00 o`clock (as the market has gone from 1.392 approximately at 10 o'clock).And then we open combo-bar and we put there 2 hours - 11th and 10th and we put there their volumes and volume of day. (It is for understanting where to enter the trade). We see that from the price with max volume of contract market rebounded in the end of 10th hour, exactly- in last 15 minutes of 10th hour. But we should wait till market goes under 1.39 to short (as our trade should not be against such large volume).

--- 帖子 #212 ---
Basically under 1.39 we can sell. Very often trades from the contract price leaves quickly so when to enter the market everyone should decide by yourself- from the contract price (that is better not to do and wait when the market leaves a corridor and then to trade). So we have waited for 5000 - have found where to enter, have looked for rebound, and opened after pullback+rebounce and when market broke close risistance volumes(like it was with 1,39). Such trades leave very far as long position as short. You see it all on the chart. It was possible to sshort around 11:20 - just at this moment nothing disturbed the market to decline(only 1.3845 - here you should be carefull).

--- 帖子 #213 ---
And one more thing!!! We look Monday 05-01-2009. Europe session, time 02:00 o`clock. On the chart we put all prices with important volumes,and also we watch in cluster chart with interval 60 minutes intraday volumes.the sentry till 03:00. Important prices - 1.39 (the contract), 1.392,1.3915,1.394 + volume of last week. So we see that on Europe session the market comes back to the contract prices (already 1.39) and if you will look at cluster chart with hours you will see that on 1.389 is situated max volume of hour and on 1.3895 there is max volume of day(Monday) which is under price with max vol of the contract.And volume of the first hour 1.3897. Here it also the second chance to enter the trade. Be attentive - 1.384 is volume of Friday, at this level it is necessary to be very careful. Or cover a half or put your stop loss at the opening price. But as usually the market passes good distance before staying somwhere. That we also see on the chart.

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Very important for the trades from the contract price to understand intraday movements of the market. As to enter the market from the contract price it is necessary to enter the market from intraday volumes.That is why we look for max volumes of houres as they are base levels for market movements intraday.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
Current situation on EUA(EUR/USD) Max volumes of contract formed corridor in which market is currently trading.Market is above Friday and previous week, but I wouldn`t advise to do anything in this corridor, but above- we would look for long position, and below may be a risky short. http://savepic.ru/444498.png http://savepic.ru/452690.png

--- 帖子 #216 ---
Main prices (with max volumes) on EUR/USD market/price difference 7 pips: http://savepic.ru/436306.png

--- 帖子 #217 ---
As I mansioned before max volumes of contract: http://savepic.ru/447593.png Max volume of previous week is on 1,29. After market went above them, came back and rebounded it was possible to open long position.Volume of more than 7k is enough to pull market to volume of week 12-16.01(white chart): http://savepic.ru/411754.png http://savepic.ru/423018.png

Situation on EURO: Max volume of contract 1.314 current week volume 3.16. Trend is gaining- we are above max volume of contract, and max volume o current week, after rebound- opportunity to open long position. Very important in such trades to see all important volumes- week, contract, day and hours.Its more reliable to trade from large volume accumulations as max volume of contract and week+day are- the bigger volume the less risk. http://savepic.ru/441460.png MAx volumes of contract: http://savepic.ru/417909.png MAx volumes of current week: http://savepic.ru/418933.png Price difference with EUR/USD- 5-8 pips.

Hi Alex. Thank you for this interesting thread. This is very interesting softwhere. Well, I got some questions regarding this softwear "Volfix". First of all, If you do not mind, could you tell me a bit about the soft. Where is the data coming from, which trading company owns the system, etc... Becuase I was looking for the information, i couldnt find any details. What I found is only few blogs that show Russian uses it.... though i can not read it. May be you r the creator of Volfix!? becuase there was your name in "Load profile" tag on Cluster chart..... Also here is one more question. i trade USD/JPY now, and I want to find res and sup price by Volfix. Then how could i find? when i look at "YEN" volume, Between Volfix and MT4, there are used different prices... oh.. I got so many questions...

--- 帖子 #223 ---
The futures contract related to USD/JPY of spot forex is the contract starting 6J.. ( currently 6JH9 ). It's correct that the price is not the same, and the chart too ... In fact, you will find that the chart mirror the USD/JPY and the reason is that the futures contract offer JPY/USD instead of USD/JPY. So if you use metatrader like me you have to find a broker offering currency futures contract quotes to mirror informations on USD/JPY spot forex chart.

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Hi, Kyuubi. Thank you for your reply. A broker...... u mean a broker like this? http://www.whcmarket.com/ Now I found how to watch currency movement with Volfix. but i still do not know how to refer "Cluster chart" and "Bar chart" as Alex does.... Whats Barc1? it mean "Bar candle"!? There are also tags, shows YEN_Synth1, YEN_synth2.... Sounds like, to understand this thread, i need to have other knowledge like stocks, GC, emini..... can not understand by just understanding Currency market. Sorry, what is "6JH9" What i want to do is that watch the volume movement of currencies by number on chart, just like the Cluster Chart does. I appreciate your help

--- 帖子 #225 ---
this question is to VSA people that are reading the thread, like Dr Geppynius and others. id like to confirm with VSA people that these examples above are the opposite of VSA, correct? Because with VSA the signal should be buy if the test don't produce volume as high as the first high volume appearence. is this correct? thanks in advance. and thanks again, Alex.

Hi Alex. Thank you for reply! Yes. I see what is exactly happening "YEN" on Volfix bar chart and USD/JPY of MT4 chart. YEN is going down caz USD is being stronger. I understand that. well, "Different price" i asked was about the # like 1,1115... 1,1145 shon on the side of chart. May be thats the amount of volume... Also the #s on cluster chart is showing the "order (lots) volume" Am i right!? And I might got this too. "6J" means Symble of YEN. H,M,U,Z, mean is contract month. 9 mean is time. Sun-F 5pm -4pm. Ohhh. Id never cared stock/gc trading. but for now i got to start study for understanding thoese symbols used on Volfix...though refering relations work for my trade style becuase im scalper and close position less than 1 min since op. So i need to find exact extry point right before the price jumps up/down. Neen to try it! Have u ever tried to find op point with the volume system for scalping? Yes, your name Alex2, Alex mini are in "load profile" on Cluster chart. Im sorry for that i posted personal question, and appreciate your kindness. Please keep posting this useful thread for fans! Best Regards

--- 帖子 #231 ---
No I don`t use volumes for scalping.Pipsing sure 5- 10 pips- maybe, though I don`t like it, but there is a way I already wrote about that.

MAX volumes of week vs Max volume of contract ===================================== Which is more important ? Till now, i don't what is the difference between both volume week vs volume of contract ?

--- 帖子 #233 ---
Simple: price with max volumes of contract is the most important, price with max volume of week is secondary important.But situations are different.

--- 帖子 #234 ---
I don`t think that commets are needed here: Max volume of contract-10k which was formed at 8:16: http://savepic.ru/414661.png http://savepic.ru/427994.png

--- 帖子 #235 ---
You got a big one! Nice

--- 帖子 #236 ---
Alex, If I'm understanding this correctly, and 1.3140 is the max volume for the entire contract, what would you have done at the point I have circled. Was there any reason why you wouldn't have shorted there. Also, what is the best way to find out the difference between the futures and spot price. So if you were aware of 1.3140 as being important, how do you work out what that price would equate to on spot, which appears to have been 1.3145 Thanks.

--- 帖子 #237 ---
I always analyse futures market, and when appears some nice trade, spot market will give it too, as price movements are the same at the same time, it does not matter is difference between spot and futures price is 5 or 8 pips, if EUA futures will decline, exactly the same spot market EUR/USD will do.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Alex i have a few questions. Example: we look at previous day max volume prices. We have 2000 contracts on 1.3500, then 1600 on 1.3400 and 1400 on 1.3401. If i understand the basics right 1.3400-1.3401 will be a more important level than 1.3500. Probably this won't happen often (most of the time there will be other big volumes around 1.3500 but hypothetically, am I right?)

--- 帖子 #239 ---
Usually max volumes of day don`t stand at such large distance, usually they are in some little price range.If max volumes of day are at 1,35 and 1,34 we consider largest.Of course if we trade from 1,35 we will cover for example at 1,34.If large distance between volume- that adds risk.Large volumes in little price range is the bestlevel to trade.

--- 帖子 #240 ---
Alex, ... which is the most important level 1.3500 or 1.3400-1.3401 ?

--- 帖子 #241 ---
1,35 as it has largest volume.

BPA (GBP/USD) Today market gave opportunity to open long position from max volume of previous week and max volume of contract: http://savepic.ru/411441.png Volume of previous day was below, trend is gaining. http://savepic.ru/397105.png

--- 帖子 #243 ---
Hello Alex, So by the same reasoning, todays max volume and other large orders appears to be around the 1.4370 area. If price retreats, is it reasonable to say then, that price should not fall below the 1.4190 region (large volume order there) and also that if price goes back over the 1.4370 area, then that would be a good trade for longs?

You mean the horizontal Buy/Sell trigger lines? Please note that the lines only show up in accordance with the DIBS rules which depends on where the day opened. If the day opened up and price is up then it will only show Buy IB triggers, if the day opened down and price is down it will only show Sell IB triggers. If price has been above and below the open price it will show both Buy and Sell IB triggers accordingly. I cannot divert from those crucial DIBS rules that were presented by PeterCrowns. If you have further concerns please PM me instead so that we don't distract Alex's thread. I'll post this in the DIBS thread, thanks...

YEN (for USD/JPY) Let's consider market movement this week, then - analysis of the next week. As I already said, the strongest and most reliable movements in the market happen only after accumulation of volume during the long period of time. This week is a good example of it, we will look it more in detail. During a week (26-30.01) market formed maximal volume on the price 1,1146: http://savepic.ru/447141.png Maximal volumes of contract at that moment: http://savepic.ru/448165.png We have a "corridor" of these prices: http://savepic.ru/393895.png Week starting from Monday the 2-nd traded in that corridor and during three days formed large volumes at the price 1, 1164: http://savepic.ru/422565.png So we see that market was trading whole week and three days in one price range, and are formed two large week's levels, and also max volume of contract. Such big volumes which were formed during long period of time give the one hudred-percent movement - up or down. Exactly that happened on Thursday. On the picture below you may see how market traded day by day that confirmed declining trend: http://savepic.ru/445113.png Volumes which were formed, will render negative pressures on a market during the nearest week, because there are a lot of large positions, and to outweigh such large ammount of money on the market, it is necessary to form an identical accumulation of volumes on minimums. Friday formed a small volume after falling, and that volume will be the base level for trading on Monday.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
Thank you Alex for your great posts. I want to say one thing. The price of Volfix is amazing, I would say crazy, even for a professional. I think programmers should change the monthly fees because great part of the traders here, those who are interested in it and learning from you thread can't efford that fees, or, if they can efford them they thinks the price is high. Some of the functions of volfix, like volumes for each price are available on other platforms like marketdelta and many others. I fallen in love with volfix but give up the idea for the high price, and other friends did the same.

BPA(for GBP/USD) Before considering possible movements of pound next week, we will consider the scheme of trading of previous week 02.02-06.02. Imagine that now is 02.02. Week before (from 26.01) made its max volume on 1, 43: http://savepic.ru/426658.png Logic of movement of the market: If the market leaves under volume of previous week, we will be looking for short as if we are under volume, it "presses" the price down, and long positions are usually very hard, or there are no long positions at all.So by such principle of analyse of the market, on Monday we short. Then - Tuesday. Market formed volume during Monday and European session of Tuesday on the price 1, 426, that was enough for market to break max volume of previous week 1, 43. http://savepic.ru/406178.png On the US session the pound was in a zone of long positions, volume of previous and current week on 1, 426 was below: http://savepic.ru/404145.png But for good long positions- the market should break through the price with the maximum volume-price of contract 1, 455. Market forms for Tuesday-Wednesday new max volume of current week on the price 1, 4457, which tells us about transferring of a volume accumulation and the basic interest of the market on this price: http://savepic.ru/407202.png On Thursday this volume accumulation pushed the market over a contract price which already became support level. From max volume of contract there was a long position. The market has appeared in a buy-zone. Analyzing the market in such way the understanding of its movement within days, weeks, the contract comes.

I agree the price of Volfix is way to high

--- 帖子 #261 ---
BPA(for GBP/USD) The next week (from 9.02) will appear over everything, long positions from volume of week 02.02-06.02, which was generated on Thursday-Friday, are possible: http://savepic.ru/397986.png and also from contract volume. Breaking these volumes down may be after volume formation for Monday-Tuesday.

It seems every time I try to launch Volfix, either the program does not respond or it freezes windows explorer. I am running Windows Vista, are you aware of any compatibility issues with Vista? Any ideas how to solve this problem? Is a new version or update coming up soon? Thanks mazingaz

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Well to my dissapointment, Volfix has now removed all Euro and Pound instuments from their platform, so until they put them back, that is if they do, don't waist your time, it was good while they had them. I just hope that do come back, i'm sure we will be informed here

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Check out barchart.com You could see futures volume there too

--- 帖子 #265 ---
Please tell me how can i do that Can i bring for example the max vol. of euro from 8:00 to 10:00 ?

--- 帖子 #266 ---
http://www2.barchart.com/mktcom.asp?...ion=currencies then click "c" under links and then you can zoom out to 5min tf and get max vol from any period you want. This is something new for me too and I'm still getting used to it. FF user RickW00716 posted this link on http://www.forexfactory.com/showthre...83#post2525283 thread.

I begin to read this interesting thread

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Okay, Conspiracy theorist please stay away because I not trying to promote anything!!!!! That being said, I spoke with the woman who is running the chart-ex charting service. She generates her chart using end of day data that she complies from her feed. Currently the charting service is free, but within two months she will be moving down to time frames as small as 20 mins in addition to the day to day charts, etc. that she is currently being offered. So once she transitions to the smaller time frames there will be a fee. She is open to answer any questions concerning her data feed (which is cme), how to read her charts, and how to relate them to spot forex. She was very open, very nice, and very knowledgable. I gave her this site so she may stop in just to say hello. Dallas

--- 帖子 #275 ---
I would like to see top 3 volume prices listed for the previous day,week and month. That will be great for seeing support/resistance. Her current charting although showed the largest volume, we still have to search for the 2nd and 3rd largest volume price. With compiled listing of top 3 volume prices is what i need.. ha!

--- 帖子 #276 ---
Yes, I agree and I just relayed your request to her via email, so lets see what happens. Dallas

--- 帖子 #277 ---
We all knew Volfix would start charging for their product sometime, it makes no sense to invest so much development time into it otherwise. Anyway there are alternatives that will give similar information but display differently, maybe better ! You need NinjaTrader to use the indicators, it's free at zen-fire.com Volfix and zen-fire have the exact same volume data, I have added up the total volume in a column of say a 1 minute bar or a 60 minute bar-cluster chart and it is the same as the volume on the same time frame bar chart in NinjaTrader. There are 2 good indicators. The first one shows a daily histogram, you tell it what start time and how long the session is and it calculates volume over that time. The Red line is Yesterdays Max Volume. I have this using 0 start time and 23 hours session time with chart time of New York hours. NinjaTrader uses your PC clock time to time stamp the bars on a chart so you have to work out session times from there, also you can not use a start time of say... 22.00 and a session time of 9 hours, as 22 + 9 = 31, and there is no such 24 hour time as 31. It's a pain but you can set your PC clock to New York time, sometimes you can get away with just setting your Time Zone but not your clock, but if you keep getting Login errors when trying to connect to a Data Feed then it is probably because your PC Time and TimeZone do not match. Time Zone you can get to by double clicking your PC clock time in bottom right of your toolbar. Unfortunately you tend to have to put up with all this mucking round if you want free stuff when the other free stuff aint free anymore. The Second one will show a volume histogram for all the bars showing on the chart, use for when you want weekly, monthly or total volume levels. Just zoom out to maximum [ Crtl + UpArrow key] grab the side of the chart window and drag it to size to show all the time frame you are interested in, hint:use the lowest time frame chart you can that will fit in the chart window to get a more accurate result. Neither of these indicators are perfect, sometime the second one will not show on the chart and you have to refresh it with the F5 key, or drag and resize the chart window either height ways or width ways. There is a lot to learn with a new charting package and indicators so if you think this is too hard, then you are probably right... :-) If we can get successful result with the www.chart-ex.com site then that would be good. There is a copy of their program at http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/fx/fx/euro-fx.html but who knows for how long. Check out my picture below to work it. To Import Indicators 1. Download the attached file to your desktop 2. From the Control Center window select the menu File &gt; Utilities &gt; Import NinjaScript 3. Select the downloaded file 4. Open a chart and right click&gt;Indicators 5. Select the Indicator from top left box, click New button, then OK button. Dean.

Hmm, I downloaded volfix and couldnt figure out how to select the different commodities - would appreciate some help on doing that. Also has anyone determined the cost of there service, there may be other ways but I do like thier presentation of the volumes. Dallas

Click on All Prices Then click on 3M and the drop down list gives you their instuments that you can look at I believe that it is $300 for currencies, I think

--- 帖子 #280 ---
300$ for just ONE currency

--- 帖子 #281 ---
I think they have 3 currency futures on their list, euro dollar, pound dollar yen dollar

--- 帖子 #282 ---
In this moment the developer stopped currencies data so you cant see their volumes. I send a email to volfix programmers and ask about prices and this is their answer email: Hello, Price of monthly subscription depends on instruments which you are going to trade through our platform. Currencies (Euro, British pound, Yen) cost $300 per month each, gold and crude oil cost $600 per month each, e-mini S&amp;P500 cost $1000 (you could add two other instruments to this subscription for the same price). -- Kind regards, Vasyl Gryshchenko VolFix

The analysis: YEN after strong decline last week, forms volumes on Monday at 1.0919 and on Tuesday at 1.0973. As the market is under important levels - it is basicly in a sell-zone. Concerning volume of current week that pushes the market upwards, and days (Monday and Tuesday) we are in a buy-zone. On a slide I have shown levels of resistance and the important levels. Movement in a corridor between 1.164 and volume of current week 1.0973 is expected. If market forms volume under 1.118 and 1.146 and 1.1164 and dont break throug 2nd largest volume of contract- 1.114- market may decline to volume of current week.

--- 帖子 #289 ---
In a situation if market will be pushed higher it is necessary to wait while market will leave level indicated on a slide (gradient) then at the price 1.114 will be the new max volume of contract-as a difference between price 1.1235 (12205 lots) and by 1.114 (12080 lots) is not big. Where then will go yen we will look - it depends on where will be situated Wednesday`s volumes. http://savepic.ru/422648.png Max volumes of all contract (that trades 3 month): http://savepic.ru/447202.png

--- 帖子 #290 ---
I saw people post here some volumes from ninja or other sources, I just advise them to be careful with that.Noone knows what is actually that, but you may be sure that you won`t find real volumes for free...or is there any people believing MT is showing any actual volume on Forex pairs?Volumes you can buy, go to CME site or any site of Board of trade and there are some companys that sell data about volumes, free real volumes won`t show you any platform and any broker.

--- 帖子 #291 ---
British pound After yeaterday`s strong market decline it is now under everything- max volumes of yesterday, contract and current and previous week.Market in a sell-zone, it rebounces from max volume of contract and will probably go to 1,43 which is max volume of week that was before previous.It may be forming all day volumes on the bottom or give one more ooportunity to short, depends of todays intraday volumes: http://savepic.ru/453373.png Max volume of contract that inspires in March: http://savepic.ru/434941.png

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Yes and about software- about old demo accounts with volumes on currencies they are still aviable, as many people are studying how to use volumes, send a me personal message, I don`t want people to discuss it here, and then hear abuses in advertisment, so in nearest future I hope I will post here analysis based on bloomberg platform too.Good trading to everyone.

--- 帖子 #293 ---
For Cable (gbp/usd) we had an excellent trade from below the previous day's max volume. Note how price was forming the volume for several hours. I used fibs for target take profit as we were below all previous major volume targets.

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Not bad for a free software. I just compared hourly max volumes on Ninja Trader and Bloomberg. It is the same. Also works with total hourly and daily volumes.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
I use ninja trader for opening my positions, but not more.If you can use such histogrammes for trading by volumes I would be really interested to see your posts here.

--- 帖子 #296 ---
Yes it was interesting, 11.02 market made at 1,436-1,4355 huge volumes of 1344 lots, and after 12.02 has broken these prices closest target was only 1,43.They went much far

Chill out mate, no one is trying to disrespect your trade or take away your "customers". I am just trying to help people who do not have the means to pay for Volfix or any other expensive news or date service.

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Thank you for your interest in Chart-Ex. I am happy to answer any questions that you might have...just make them easy I like your idea about having the top 3 volume numbers. I am also in looking into having the 70% value area as an option. My enchancements are what I am working now, so it is good to hear input from traders in what they are looking for that helps them make trading decisions.

--- 帖子 #300 ---
Thanks for this info Dean, Very useful. and yes it is always a bit of pain to learn the subtleties of a new software package, (on top of developing a trading strategy) , but I think I need to spread my wings. I've been joined at the hip to metatrader for too long. I more or less know it inside out, which took several months, so I'm sure this learning process of NinjaTrader will take a while, but I feel it will ultimately be worth it. Thanks again for the indicators. As a former Internet Researcher I find that most of the paid information on the net can be obtained freely if you look hard enough or are willing to do some extra work to put it together. I think Voltix has packaged the information neatly and so they should quite reasonably expect compensation for their efforts. That said, in the spirit of sharing, I have included two links below, one to the forex factory thread and the ingenuity of VolumeTrader that inspired the creation of a volume program that does a lot of what is being described in this thread and also the link to the program, which is freely available . http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=126216 http://trading-evolution.com/

--- 帖子 #301 ---
I want to show that VolFix and the Zen-Fire data feed are the same cause I think this is important if you want to compare them. Check out the High Low and Volume on the Bar I have the cursor on in the first picture. Ninjatrader with Zen-Fire feed, now check the High Low and add up all the volume that happened in the Volfix cluster I highlighted in Yellow. Its the same, the time is different but Ninja uses the time of my PC where Volfix uses Chicago time. Also Ninja uses the Bar CLOSE time, where Volfix uses bar OPEN time that is why it is 1 minute difference. Now if you add up the volume in the second cluster chart picture. It is the same as the Ninja volume. I am sorry I only have a few pictures like these although I did check it out on different days and time frames, because I was only trying to prove to myself they both used the same Data. By the way if you noticed the Ninja bar time HOUR has a different offset to my previous chart that is because I sometimes change my PC clock as one of those other indicators will not work with my local time. But I only ever change the hour, never the minutes. Dean.

--- 帖子 #302 ---
Here is a week of data comparison, pretty darn close, what I like the most is though the visual of where the next big level of volume is. So the PEAK of the histogram is where the Max Volume occurred, but another thing interesting I noticed, the VALLEY is where price either goes to and reverses, or quickly jumps across, just like you or I when we come to a small valley, creek or small river crossing and we do not want to get our feet wet, Jump or go back ;-) The bigger the Valley the more power it's effect. Draw a horizontal line at the Valleys and you have Support and Resistance Levels. GodFreH thanks for the links, there is so much interesting information out there amongst other.... uninteresting ;-) stuff so it good to be shown such info. Gunn Mann try downloading the indicators again and make sure they are saved as a ZIP file, others have got them working so it must be something wrong on your end. Dean.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
Lisa, You might want to look at http://trading-evolution.com/ This is the kind of information that i am looking for. Showing the 10 listing of top volume prices. Perfect for me... but it would be great with more currencies to choose from.. lol ! Previous day, week and month + Current week and month volume data + the period you want to analyse from. If you do something like that and keep the fee reasonable, i will be happy to subscribe it.

--- 帖子 #304 ---
OK, got it sorted out

--- 帖子 #305 ---
Thanks for that info GodfreyH...

--- 帖子 #306 ---
Hi Deanz, is confident that Zen-Fire has the same volume, all future go through CME, but with ninja if u want to see accurate volumes u have to keep ninja always on, to recording tick data, couse free Zen-Fire don't provide backfilling them. I'm using ninja too, I think if we want to talk about, we have to start a new thread, and leave this to Alex. Lubo

--- 帖子 #307 ---
First of all, reading this thread is very interesting and refreshing since it differs from the hundreds of threads centered around lagging indicators. The approach reminds me strongly of Market Profile where you look to trade off of certain levels created from previous trading sessions, such as the POC= Point of control, Value Areas etc. It seems that Volfix is not needed since a lot of charting platforms feature Market Profile which gives you the price with the highest volume visually. There is also a Market Profile indicator for Metatrader which is based on time instead of volume, but it works equally well. But maybe I'm mistaken and the concept described in this thread is different. The question remains: how do you know when to trade off of a high volume level ? Price can chop around a high volume level for quite a while until it trades away from it...what to do ?

--- 帖子 #308 ---
The analysis of gold for the next week: After strong gain gold market has stopped in a range of the prices 945- 937. During three days large accumulation of volume was formed on the top, that will have an effect on Monday-Tuesday: http://savepic.ru/439895.png http://savepic.ru/404053.png We will short only under max volume of Friday, and will hold to max volumes of contract 910-915.

--- 帖子 #309 ---
Well, according to Alex, if price closes above the max volume of the previous day, then you should be in a buy zone and vice versa. Also, I understand that if price closes at approximately the max volume for the day, then that price area should provide strong support / resistance. If you look on the 15min chart of gbp futures below, you see that price closed just below the max volume, so I suppose the bias is down. But its still in the support/resistance zone. I believe the strategy is that price will usually move away , but then retrace to the max volume and then rebound from there. I still use traditional oscillators and indicators to verify potential trades though. Incidentally, I gather the US market will be closed on Monday, so that may affect volume readings.

--- 帖子 #310 ---
Thanks.System is based not just on rebounds from important levels, besides large volume accumulations like week volumes, month and contract, for accurate trading we need intraday volumes- like max volumes of hours, max volumes of 15 min intervals, tick volumes, to open in exact time and exact way.Market moves between intraday volumes by the same principles as it moves from large volumes of weeks or month.Thats why I pay people`s attention to places where are accumulated max volumes of hours during the day, or where we see large tick volume accumulations.Market movements from volumes has exact rules, and of course I don`t post them all here.

--- 帖子 #311 ---
I'm developing a new theory,based on what Alex and Dean said, its called "nature abhors a vacuum" lol, no, that physics 101. Can't remember who said it though. Anyway, the idea is that market profiles establish concentrations of volumes at particular prices. So you can see the big boys process of accumulation at work. Now Having looked at different software packages, I realize that time can act as a good proxy for volume. Now before you all beat up on me, I realize time doesn't equal to volume, but in practice, a market profile based on time is almost as good as one based on contract volumes. So with the limitations of mt4 software and data feed, the first chart shows a 1hr market profile of gbp/usd and the second the trend lines involved. If my theory is right, a break down should at least go to the price at the next large concentration of volume, and a break up should go to the price at the next large concentration of volume. Filling the "vacuum" gap between price so to speak. Well, what do you think Alex?

--- 帖子 #312 ---
Hi Godfrey, yes, that has also been my observation. Very often, differences between Volume Profile and Time Profile are negligible. Sometimes, the Time Profile gives the best levels for the day, some times its the Volume Profile.

--- 帖子 #313 ---
Hi Alex, I'll agree ...the principles apply on every time frame. Please keep on posting.

--- 帖子 #314 ---
wow, thanks for let all us know that.

--- 帖子 #315 ---
GodfreyH you may know this all ready but both those Ninja indicators have 3 options as to how they calculate: TPO ... Time Price Opportunity, which is Market Profile. How long priced stayed at each price level VWTPO..... Volume Weighted TPO, which is like MP but uses Volume instead of Time. How much Volume was at a price level. VOC... Volume On Close. All the volume of a bar is allocated to the close price level. On 1 indicator you have to type in TPO or VWTPO or VOC, and the other it had a drop down menu. So if you wanted you can easily compare Market Profile to Volume Profile.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
Thanks for that !

YEN The analysis. Volumes of 2 weeks at one level 02/02/09 and 26/01/09- weeks max volumes at the prices 1.1164 and 1.1146.This is very strong resistance. This week has reached these levels, has not breaked them and the market went in a sell-zone. On a slide it is visible as Monday and Tuesday have generated volumes and have pushed the market to the important volumes of last two weeks. As powerful resistance on 1.1164 and 1.1146 on Wednesday was generated under them volume of current week, and declined, other days declined. On a slide I have shown where and at which prices volumes of days of week and volume of week 1.1065 were generated.

--- 帖子 #319 ---
What we will expect- as we are in a sell- zone, we have above us volumes of previous week and contract and 2 last weeks, it is necessary to short only. It is not recommended to open long positions. But market can gain to volume of week 1.1065. Pay attention to levels 1.0973,1.1042,1.0919-volumes of days, it is recommended to open long positions as it is shown on a slide. We will wait for a good short trade. Monday will likely form volume between levels 1.0973 and 1.088, and Tuesday will trade from this volume. http://savepic.ru/433778.png

Sorry Alex, about the indicator intrusion, but I'm being overwhelmed by PM's, so to those that I haven't responded to yet, I'm posting the indicator here. Remember this indicator does market profiling using time and not volume. You really need Voltix or Ninja Trader for true volume information. What the indicator attempts to do is highlight the areas of price accumulation, which usually also indicates volume accumulation.

Dear GodfreyH, Thank for the information on your indicator. I am wondering how this is related to volume especially in the format it was and been discussed by Alex. Dont you think the tread would benefit more on analysis that are volume based and off course that may also enhance the value of the current thread on volume indicators and there best mode of utilisation? Just a question. Cheers

--- 帖子 #333 ---
Due to the easy availability of the metatrader and its volume indicators, I have tried to see the possibility of visually using these indicators with teachings of Alex. Please find attached a few charts of the Cable. They have been working as Alex indicates. Please feel free to comment.

--- 帖子 #334 ---
On this chart, we have a buy day as the day end on or above the highest volume of the day. Secondly, we have a very strong resistance level from the previous week just below 1.6579. The question here is if it will re test 1.6880 before heading south again. However we have the highest volume today just above that of yesterday. We wait until end of day to see. Cheers

Suppose that we are in moment of time (range arrow in attached file),when price touched 1,262 from under ,a few minutes before your left green arrow. I expected that price rebound to short from 1,262 and I went there short. How do you know that wait for break up 1,263 , ,back of price, and take long from 1,263 (max of contract) please ????

During 8-9 hours there has been foming of large volume, that was seen on cluster chart,from that hour level we may trade only in next hour.Hour level is confirmation for intraday trade, because we cant just trade using week or contract volumes, we need to see what is happening inside of day.

Alex thank it is clear , but you did not understand my question: Suppose that we are in moment of time (range arrow in attached file),when price touched 1,262 from under ,a few minutes before your left green arrow. I expected that price rebound to short from 1,262. How do you know that wait and take long???. Why dont go short ??

--- 帖子 #346 ---
One more time- first, before you open position from week/contract level you need some confirmation - intraday volume accumulation near important level, like it was on example- max volume of hour 7-8.So you open position in 8-9 hour from max volume of previous hour near important large volume of week or contract, it is intraday trade(from max volume of hours)+ from some large level, such trades are best, but you shouldnt open it in hour 7-8 when volume formation was happening, its a trap.

hi alex right but also the hourly volume show only that there is support or resistance...it again dont show which direction one should trade... so how you should decide which direction to trade..? i also dont understand..... regards lodol

--- 帖子 #349 ---
Alex Thank you for answer. I have to say that I very hard study all examples in this thread and I try to understand but I have more unclear things. For example: Basic principle is : must to see „reaction“ of price to strong level of price (level where is big volume in past) ,what means that I want see on cluster chart (1 hour or 15 minute ) big volume on this level and wait for bounce from this level. Is it true ??? Am I right ??? Suppose and hope I am right. But for example in post number 60 (continue 61) I didnt see reaction of price to strong level. In this case price in week that started 15th december, even did not touch strong level ( max .volume of contract) , or are there any else strong level ??? . Please could you explain it. What is strong level in this case and what numbers in cluster chart are „reaction of price“ ?? Thank you for helpfulness.

hello sir and thx for valuable informations i have red the thread and got some kind of basic lines to enter the trade , first of all we should indicate strong level and they are : 1- max contract 2-previous week 3-current week 4-last day 5-current day 6-max volume for current hour and previous hour 7- and ( im not sure ) max vol for current 15 min and last 15 min and corridor happens when the price goes between ( max contract and previous week , or max contract and current week , or previous week and current week ) " we should wait for safe trade " and the trade is safe for long if the price is moving above the levels i mentioned , and below them with short and it's needed to get confirmation from intraday volumes like ( current day , breaking current and previous hours max volume ) juts need ur opinion about these main points , waitng for ur advice, thx

I'm focused on EURUSD, GBPUSD, USDJPY and I still find difficult to be really profitable with the strategy. But I don't give up as I find this is the only system I feel confortable with and in which I trust the most. Anyway thanks to be back and help people like me ...

--- 帖子 #381 ---
For example what do you think about this scenario ?

--- 帖子 #382 ---
it seems not a bad start ... do you think I should trail my stop behind the max volume of current day until I reach my target ?

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Finally price goes under the max volume of today and make a bearish rebound ( this was at 1.4858 ) so I think it was the good moment to closed the trade. No so easy to spot in real time but I think it will become more easy with time and experience Are you agree with my interpretation for this trade plan Alex ?

--- 帖子 #384 ---
You should use intraday volumes, to see what is happening inside of trading session, where are big positions, accurate entering the market may be done only this way.But you are doing wright thing, making your trades near significant levels.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Thank you for your comments. What do you mean by intraday volumes exactly ? because I use max volume of the current day ... Are you talking about Max volume of hours ( for example ) and tick chart to see where big position are ? Unfortunately i don't have charting package allowing me to do it in forex .. I can only have a cluster chart not a tick cluster chart ...

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Imho, when price is in a huge trend, be aware, that big intraday against trend positions could make you believe in a possible reverse, that in these cases usually does not happen, and get you in a wrong position. Usually this big counter trend positions are from someone that close his positions. Lubo.

Hello!!! Sorry I was silent so long, lots of holidays in May=)Quick view at Gold market... Today I look for short from max volumes of previous days- 914-915, there was made huge volume, about 5000 lots for few days...strong movements always starts from place where large volumes was made, so I wait for market to reach 911-904 today and even lower, or if Bernanke will tell smth unique and market will go above 914-915 I will put buy limits to 914-15. Counter with max volumes of previous days: http://savepic.ru/650601m.png Whole previous week: http://savepic.ru/653673m.png On tick chart I look for market reaction to important prices: http://savepic.ru/654697m.png http://savepic.ru/642409m.png I will answer to all questions but questions that I see need very large answers, it takes a month at least to understand, I teach some people and I can say that it takes aq lot of time- not 1,2 or 10 posts.So I will better make some book about trading by volumes and will share it here.

Alex, Whatewer you way of trading is, if you make money-happy for you! As far as I understand it's all about Market Profile and a POC and a Virgin POC? Praviljno? Da, kstati, che ti tut delaesh va6e??? Pochemu ne na traderslaboratory.com ili daytrader.com??? Sdesj odni mtshniki, i k sozhaleniju objemi eto ne dlja nih (FX no vols)!

--- 帖子 #392 ---
You are not wrong... when I use POC on spot and look at the futures market I can see that POC is where there have been the most trades have taken place and MAX volume seems to accumulated there. though I don't want to hijack alex's thread as market profile is different to what alex is trading on. i am more and more looking at MP and for me this made me understand what the market is doing.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
What is a POC? Thanks

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Point of control - it shows you where the market has been the busiest, where traders have found a fair price to buy and sell. type in Market Profile in google and you will find loads of info... I do not want to hijack this thread as it is not based on the type of trading alex does.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Listen guys, all strategies of trading by volumes came from one sourse- market profile, that was created in 80-th.It has one really useful principle, it pais your attention to places where 70% of max positions are.I have traded by that principle for long time, and I can say that some details are useless and some are very important, it is all experience, and I share it here, and mostly in skype chats, so if you have any questions- faster to find me there. Now I want to share share 1 interesting strategy on Gold market, it is based on cathing "big dogs":s1: So I put in filter amount of 300-400 lots and look at 5 minutes-cluster charts.So when at some low or at some high appeares big position(300 or more lots per 5 min), better if such position is not alone- two or more, it colours red(all smaller positions in cluster chart are white and grey).Logic is easy- after strong decline we look for long, after strong gain- for short.So wee look for positions that reverses the market. Of course such stratedy contains some more details, so before using any strategy I always advise to check history at least 1 previous year. here are examples from previous week: 5/05: http://savepic.ru/642192m.png http://savepic.ru/632976m.png 8/05: http://savepic.ru/635024m.png http://savepic.ru/636048m.png

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Good day to everyone!! Today I want to tell you about tick volumes, some base information: Tick Volume Definition Tick volume is measuring every trade whether up or down and the volume that accompanies those trades for a given time period. If you are a day trader or a short term swing trader, tick volume analysis will assist you in sizing up the market on an intraday basis. Some traders also refer to tick volume as on-balance volume. When analyzing the market at large, traders often focus on pivot points to look for changes or continuation in trends. This is where all the money is made and lost. In order to trade this effectively a trader will want to obtain an edge that will assist them in determining whether a pivot has the strength to hold the current trend. While many traders have access to volume on a chart, the one thing that volume charts do not show you is the volume that takes place at a given price. Would you want to buy a break of the last swing point, if you knew that it was broken on high volume? Well maybe you would, but it does not hurt to know what is going on at this critical level. Tick volume provides traders with this detailed breakdown of the trading activity at a given level. Tick volume is critical as for futures traders, as for stocks. Stocks on the other hand are bought for only one reason, to invest, so large size indicates that people importance and wealth believe the stock is worthy. But currencies move around for a multitude of other reasons making volume size kind of irrelevant. If Honda decide to hedge 500 million before shipping cars overseas of what relevance is that to you? If you saw an activity like 5 million, 15 million, 50 million, 5 million, 5 million, 100 million,and then again 20 million.... etc etc. What does this tell you? Nothing... You do not know who is moving this money or why. But what tick volume does tell you is the amount of activity going through the market. Tick Volume Simon Hart

Hello people. I see a lot of people having problems with understanding main principles of price movements and volume. I will begin to post here information about Market Profile too, for better understanding of 3 main things in trading- price/volume/time. Here is market profile chart with number of volume at each price. Very useful thing. If that would be needed I may organize webinars about trading by volumes. http://savepic.ru/609859m.png Market Profile was created by by J. Peter Steidlmayer and the Chicago Board of Trade in 1985.

With the availability of the real-time representation of market activity, the general public now has access to market-generated information which previously had been available only to individuals who traded on exchange floors. As a result, it is now possible to get the "feel of a market" without being in the trading pit. Many individuals strive to learn trading by following market fundamentals and/or by conducting technical analysis where the general intent may be to trade by some system or formula. The "market logic" approach, which is the foundation of the CBOT Market Profile entails understanding what is happening in the market, thinking about it logically and acting accordingly. Because activity is not random, it can be read and interpreted by using the Market Profile and volumes data. There are three principles underlying the Profile: the market's purpose, its operational procedures and the behavior of its participants. The purpose of a futures market (as of all markets) is to facilitate trade. This is accomplished by providing a location, market-imposed time frames (the trading session, the life of futures contracts, the timing of market reports) and the information that the Profile captures. The market is self-regulating through the use of time and price, and market activity consists of "time/price opportunities" in which participants can trade at specific times at a specific price. Market activity is interpreted by the acceptance or rejection of "time/price opportunities" by market participants . Futures markets operate through a "dual auction" process. That is, as the market is attempting to facilitate trade, it seeks the activity of market participants through the use of price probes. These price probes move alternately too high and too low in order to create trading opportunities. The acceptance or rejection of these "time/price opportunities" is a function of the needs and objectives of market participants. Observing the behavior of market participants allows one to interpret market conditions. For example, it allows a trader to judge the profit potential of buying strength or selling weakness. Market participants can be categorized by their time frames. "Day-time-frame traders," as CBOT calls them, intend to conduct business in a specific trading session. Most of them are local scalpers who seek a "fair price" in order to facilitate trade. That is, they operate to buy the bid price or to sell the asking price. "Other-time-frame traders," who initially may not intend to conduct business in a specific trading session, may assume a market position because of an attractive TPO. They seek an "advantageous price." They operate to buy at the low end of the price range or to sell at the high end of the price range.

Market Profile is not an indicator in the typical sense. It does not provide buy/sell recommendations but acts more like a decision-support tool. It organizes the data so that you can understand who is in control of the market, what is perceived as fair value, and the direction of the price move. It is possible to extract enough information from Market Profile for you to position your trades more advantageously. Market Profile is useful for the pit trader as well as the offfloor trader. The indicator can help the off-floor trader get a better sense of the market; prior to the introduction of Market Profile, only floor traders had access to this information. Although all references here refer to using futures contracts, Market Profile can be used just as effectively for other tradables. Software vendors such as Cqg/Bloomberg/Volfix/MarketDelta provide Market Profile displays for equities. The concept of Market Profile stems from the idea that markets have a form of organization determined by time, price, and volume. Each day, the market will develop a range for the day and a value area, which represents an equilibrium point where there are an equal number of buyers and sellers. In this area, prices never stay stagnant. They are constantly diverging, and Market Profile records this activity for traders to interpret. Market Profile is based on the normal distribution curve, where in approximately 70% of the values fall within one standard deviation of the average..... Later I will post more

Materials for the course of lectures: trade strategies development methods on S&amp;P500 INDEXES. Meaning. background . Indexes arose because of a need to account stock price averages when the market is analyzed and a decision on investment is made. All price averages are based on that which is called a representative list . The whole list is divided in several groups: shares of industrial companies, railway companies, public-service companies, high-tech companies. Dow Jones indexes are probably the most known among all averages. Those averages were developed by Charles Dow and first estimated in 1884 for 11 stocks only (one of the oldest averages, which has been already estimated for about half a century.) Afterwards this list was widened to consist of 30 stocks. Dow Jones averages have their opponents despite the popularity. They are criticized for the weak statistical basis and insufficient representativity. Other index S&amp;P500 computed on the basis of 500 companies stocks recently has therefore become more popular among investors. The stocks accounted in the index represent companies of 86 industry sectors. The index comprises the stocks representing about 80% of market value of all stocks quoted in New York stock exchange. S&amp;P 500 is a list of 500 selected joint-stock companies in USA with the largest capitalization. The list is owned by the company «Standard &amp; Poor's» and is developed by it as well. It is the value weighted mean of prices of those companies’ stocks, that is known as S&amp;P 500 index. Capitalization is used to weigh when the index is computed. Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P) is a subsidiary of McGraw-Hill corporation, engaged in analytical researches of financial market. This company along with Moody's and Fitch Ratings is included in a triad of the most powerful international rating agencies. Before 1957, the «Standard &amp; Poor's» company published two indexes: daily and weekly. The nowadays aggregate «Standard &amp; Poor's 500» index replaced them in 1957. S&amp;P 500 index is more composite when compared with Dow Jones index, but it is considered more accurate by reason of that the stocks of more numerous corporations are represented in it, and the stocks of each of the corporations are weighted by the value amount of all stocks held by shareholders. Futures and options are traded at it on Chicago commodity exchange. S&amp;P 500 is not simply a list of the largest companies in USA as private companies and companies which stocks are insufficiently liquid are not included in it. In addition, when the list is developed, the authors attempt to represent different sectors of America’s economy the most fully. For example, the stocks of such companies are included in S&amp;P 500 index: Company Industry General Electric Power generation Exxon Mobil Corp. Information technologies Microsoft Corp. Information technologies Pfizer, Inc. Health care Citigroup Inc. Financial sector Wal-Mart Stores Key consumer goods American Int'l. Group Financial sector Bank of America Corp. Financial sector Johnson &amp; Johnson Health care International Business Machines Information technologies S&amp;P 500 index is worthily called the barometer of America’s economy. And NASDAQ is one more America’s popular index about which it is worth to tell. NASDAQ is an index of over-the-counter market. A volume of trade through NASDAQ system has considerably grown recently. By 1986 the National Association of Securities Dealers developed and introduced 9 indexes. The composite index of NASDAQ over-the-counter market, which reference year is 1970, is calculated by NASD with using an automated communication system. Stocks of about 4300 America’s companies traded through the NASDAQ system are accounted. Two indexes were introduced in 1984: the composite index of the NASDAQ system’s national market and industrial stocks index (of high-tech companies mainly) the NASDAQ system’s national market. A market value is used to weigh and 100 is assumed as the basis for both indexes. Those which are well-known among other foreign indexes: FTSE100 (English), DAX (German), CAC (French), Nikkei (Japanese) WHY FUTURES AT S&amp;P500? As is known, a futures contract is a contract on supply of any commodity with maturity. A contract’s parameters are determined on an exchange. Futures contracts first existed historically on a commodity exchange (soy-beans, sugar, gold, oil etc) As the futures market adapted to financial instruments in 1970s, this resulted in reversal of opinions on futures trade. In 1982 exchange trade of futures started on the basis of a stock index. The trade developed most successfully on the basis of «Standard &amp; Poor's 500» index, which is quite logical as the index itself has been one of the key tools of market situation analysis (market «barometer») and at which all the players in the market have been focused. And when it transformed from an analysis tool into a speculation tool, all the trained attendance actively participated in tenders. Therefore, trade in futures contracts attracts not only hedgers but numerous profiteers tempted by small initial margin as percentage (about 5-10% of the current value of a contract), and, consequently, by an opportunity to use a large «leg». Thus, a great number of profiteers using that instrument ensure three main qualities of the instrument: volatility , liquidity, forecastability which in turn determine our interest to S&amp;P500 and e-mini S&amp;P. Contract specification for e-mini S&amp;P: Futures contracts at S&amp;P index are traded by contracts: December, March, June and September. A contract lasts for 3 months. Official dates of S&amp;P contracts expiry: Mar 20/3, Jun 20/6, Sep 19/9, Dec 19/12 A process of a contract replacement starts a week before the official date; it is not recommended to trade. Marginal security for e-mini S&amp;P contracts: from 2 250$ to 4 500$ per 1 contract. 3500$ on the average. Tick level is 0.25, tick cost is 12.5 dollars. Thus, a cost of market movement at a position size is determined as 1 lot: For example: change in price from 880 to 890 is 10 dollars (figure), which is 40 ticks and 500 dollars accordingly. Some conclusions of observation practice and conducting of trade operations 1. Contracts are the best traded within the first 2 months: regular deals are practically conducted every day. More complicated deals with pass of 2-3$ are conducted within the last month. During that period it is recommended to trade especially cautiously as a lot of rating prices are formed at the end of a contract. 2. When the volume of a contract achieves over 300 000 lots, a price benchmark is levels of volumes registered within the last week and the week before last. 3. Transition to a new contract occurs within the last week of a contract, so it is not recommended to trade during this period. It is not recommended to trade on news days, namely when news from Federal Reserve and unemployment reports are published. 4. Following the trade within an «impulse» (with strong movement) hour, it is necessary to make a break of 2-3 hours. As a rule, a day more “inert”, accumulating or corrective follows after a trend day. Platform tools used to analyze a market situation: counters : All prices, volume search, aggregate, daily minutes diagrams: Bar chart ( 60 min, 10 min, 1 min) cluster chart ( 60 min, 30 min, 5 min), combo bar ( week, day, time), Action algorithm when it is analyzed a situation before tenders: 1. Determine rating price levels (i.e. levels of significant volume indicators; usually, the first 5 prices in rating “All prices”) with using volume counters at different time spans. (Study the last month period, two weeks, the last week, the last two days from the beginning of a week). Numerical values of volume indicators are also a subject of the analysis. 2. Plot significant levels on a Bar chart. (Analyze charts for a day, 60 min, 10 min) and Combo bar (week, day) 3. Analyze a response of the market to key levels in the past and determine presence (absence) of a trend, its development degree. 4. According to item 3, determine actions priority for a forthcoming tender period. 5. Set price levels, probable entry points and targets. Any decisions are made on the basis of analysis which purpose is to estimate probabilities and to determine the point with probability of occurrence of the event planned by us of not less than 80%. You have already familiarized with the brief action algorithm above. Now we will consider in details all the parameters of systemic analytical approach. There are several basic levels in the systemic approach to an analysis of any financial instrument, and in particular, to S&amp;P500 index: 1. Time (analyze behavior, nature of trades, price ranges, volume indicators and other parameters within different time periods, starting from the background in the case of speculative deals: 3-6 months, and ending with short time periods: 1 hour, 30, 15 minutes). 2. Trend (presence/absence, arising, extinction of a trend within any time period) 3. Outlining of action priority (buying/sale). 4. Price benchmarks (to enter into a deal, forecast of target, fixing of a deal) Having analyzed the market situation for each of the levels, we sum up the data and get that entry point with a large probability value (up to 90%) of the event planned by us. We will consider in details in this course titled «development of trade strategies for S&amp;P500» the peculiarities of analysis, planning and conducting of trade operations using this instrument in the contents of operation procedure on the basis of data for volumes. (We will consider as the theory of operation with volume indicators integrates in the systemic analytical approach, enriches it and places on a new level, which enables to optimize a trading process). How to find an entry point with the larger probability of an expected event with using the functions and advantages of VOLFIX platform. All academic schemes and theoretical postulates of the method would be visually confirmed with some examples of actual trade cases. Before we move to the detailed consideration of that how volume indicators are analyzed, treated and used at each of the systemic levels (i.e., operation at relations: volumes-time, volumes–direction, volumes-action priorities, volumes-price benchmarks), we will repeat the fundamentals of procedure for working on the basis of data pertaining to volumes, with which you are familiar from the initial training course (should you not be familiar with this course, it will be necessary to be trained under it before you start with the given course): First fundamental: a volume indicator reflects a degree of intensity or strength of price policy, a risk degree in this or that price range for market players. An increase in volume evidences of rising of the pressure on prices, which forces them to change. Second fundamental: a decrease in pressure due to buyers/sellers is first detected with volume indicators before it directly reflects in a price tendency (hence, forecast significance of volume indicators). Thus, the scheme “ volume-price ” works . Third fundamental: those the most interesting in terms of analysis are maximal volume indicators forming the very levels of support/resistance , well known from the concepts of technical analysis. The market moves from one level of maximal volumes to the other one, and this rule is held for various time periods. Should those fundamentals have been realized and tested by you, then we will move to consideration of development of trade strategies for S&amp;P500. THUS : § VOLUMES-TIME (work with volume indicators at different time intervals): Time is a key parameter when a situation is analyzed and a decision is made. The market axiom exists not without reason: «it is important not what to buy or sell but WHEN to buy or sell.» Time determines the market rhythm (impulse-pause–impulse). When operating with futures in general and particularly with S&amp;P futures, time is extremely important as the tool is volatile enough and there is “leverage effect” here as for all futures instruments. Therefore, selection of RIGHT TIME to conclude a deal is extremely necessary (and is critically important for deposits of less than 100 К ). Having become familiar with the rules and key principles of operation at relation «volumes– time», you will be able to avoid mistakes when entering into deals and considerably optimize your trade system.

As far as “time” parameter is concerned, there are several rules enabling to correctly estimate volume indicators and operate with them: First rule: intraday volumes consolidated in weekly, weekly ones in monthly, monthly ones are involved in forming the maximal amount of a contract, which is the most significant and maximal volume. (A volume is placed in a volume under a principle of set of nesting dolls). Coincidence (or maximal approximation) of levels of maximal half hourly, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly (or other occurring at different time) volumes provides a maximal significant price level with large degree of reliability of a deal performed at it and strictly focuses the deal’s time point. An example of coincidence of significant monthly and daily levels: http://savepic.ru/731459m.png http://savepic.ru/729411m.png Having analyzed the readings of counters for the period from 6.10.08 to 27.10.08 (140 411 lot) and for Monday 27.10.08 (36 034 lot), we may see that 870/869 level is significant within these different time periods; therefore, it may be expected considerable movement while trading from this level. It just so occurred on 28.10.08.: the 870 level was broken and the strongest intraday movement was induced by it (see the graph). It is interesting that within the day further time work continued at that level, which narrowed a time range of the deal to several minutes (see cluster charters below). http://savepic.ru/736579m.png Graph illustrated the scheme of “overlapping” of the levels formed by maximal volumes in different time periods. Example of level coincidence at different time scales: 120 min and 15 min http://savepic.ru/734531m.png At 12:00 when price level was 872 we saw coincidence of price values at scales 120 min and 15 min (on the left); at that, the same level is marked (scale on the right) as the level of maximal daily volume. At the same moment this level was actively broken.

http://savepic.ru/755010m.png http://savepic.ru/759106m.png Scales on the left are in a narrow price range; 33 032 lots are accumulated at 870 level. Buying from this level at 13.20. http://savepic.ru/748866m.png We will consider coincidence for short time periods in more details in the intraday section (intraday trading) Second rule: the longer the time period within which a volume was formed, the more significant price level at which the volume was formed. That is why the levels formed by a contract volume are more important than weekly levels, weekly levels are more important than the daily ones. Thus, levels rating by volume indicators and time of a volume formation as such: 1.A level by a contract volume (maximally possible of S&amp;P volumes and covering the whole trade period starting from appearance of first lot in it) 2. A level by the volume for a day (current and previous) 3. A level by the maximal volume for a day (current and previous) 4. A level by the maximal volume for an hour (half an hour, 15 minutes, 5 minutes etc) And here we can give approximate volume indicators significant for level formation in each time period. (You may broaden for yourself this list of coincidence of a volume formation time and its numerical value): Volume for an hour Volume for a day Volume for a week Contract volume Approximate indicators of maximal volumes 10 000/20 000 lots 30 000/40 000 lots 100 000 – 200 000 From 150 000 to 500 000 lots . Logically following from the second rule Third rule: in any time period the largest value (in terms of a deal’s reliability) usually belongs to its second half. If to consider a month, then the intersection with the central (or the second week) serves as supporting factor for a deal. The most reliable deals intra week are those concluded from the volumes of Tuesday, Wednesday, i.e., in the second half of a time period (when a weekly volume being an additional support and confirmation of previous weekly volumes has already formed; see an example below) as well as intra hour: the first half an hour for volume formation, the second half an hour for selling out from formed levels of maximal volumes. Let us consider an example of trade strategy for the intraweek time period: 13.10.08- 17.10.08 The key levels of last week: 1020, 1005, 1000. Levels for the period of Monday-Tuesday: 1055, 1018,5

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Intraday levels were formed on Wednesday: 972,5 and 970 positioned by the market as support levels. http://savepic.ru/753005m.png http://savepic.ru/739693m.png http://savepic.ru/740717m.png It is already seen that 1020 (the last week level) worked off as resistance. And therefore, it is more reliable deal on 15.10.08: sale from 1007 and at breaking 972,5. http://savepic.ru/743789m.png Thus, in the middle of a week we have another degree of protection of a deal’s reliability as historical levels are confirmed by levels of the current week. This principle is applicable to other time parameters.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
http://savepic.ru/781676m.png The situation looked like as such in chart Combo: Wednesday (pink chart) – movement from the minimum of Tuesday (blue) level 979,7 to achieve as minimum the “bottom” of Monday – 927,5. Let us consider one more example of trade strategy from a level of maximal volume in the middle of a week. Thus, within Monday, Tuesday (November 3-4) it was formed the levels: 1002,5, 1000, 999 totaling about 200 000 lots (the same levels were significant on October 13-14). Maximal intraday volume of Wednesday on 5 November was formed at the price of 987 (37 872 lot), 973 (32 540 lot) and 951,75 (32 342 lot). http://savepic.ru/772460m.png http://savepic.ru/770412m.png You may observe by nature of trades that the first part of week was inert, accumulating, without trend. See the chart below. On November 5 which was Wednesday the market efficiently responded to levels 1002,5 and 999 as resistance levels. It was formed the daily level as 987 and its breach was a strict signal to sale. November 6, Thursday. Selling out from the Thursdays’ significant level (952) + levels 945-945 which are historically significant levels. (Levels of the previous month) – illustration of different time level coincidence as well

Trade scheme of a delaing in thesecond half an hour . http://savepic.ru/739692m.png This scheme reflects the priority of second half an hour (sometimes last 15 minutes) to conclude a deal. The main point of mechanism remains the same as for longer time periods. The first half of a period is for a volume formation, the second half is to analyze the market response to a volume level and to make a decision in accordance with this response. (Should a level be positioned as resistance, then sell, should as support, then buy. In detail : in section “VOLUME - DIRECTION” ) SCHEMES OF INTRADAY TRADE SEE IN SECTION «STRATEGIES FOR DAILY TRADE» (INTRADAY). And the last item of what we treat as the subject of «volume-time» relation Fourth rule: п the rule of remoteness by time in respect of a current moment, i.e.: for example, at equal values of several weekly volumes the level formed within the nearest week is more significant than a weekly one formed by the week before. This is connected with the psychological aspect of trades. As we deal with a response of traders to the market movement and the positions which they either have already occupied or missed to occupy, then it is quite understandable that the closer an event and response to it by time the more significant the event itself is. o VOLUME–DIRECTION (work with volume indicators relating to the market movement: trend-direction, turn, breaking, trend formation, intra-trend operation) In the initial course on a system of trade strategy development on the basis of volume data we touched some rules of treatment and use of volume data concerning the main points of market movement. We particularly touched the rule of correspondence/difference of trend direction and increase/decrease in volume values, now we will consider this rule in detail with using an example of trade sessions development on the basis of S&amp;P500 (e-mini S&amp;P) and will see other regularities when work with volumes relating to the market movement. SO: First rule: WE REALIZE UNDER A RESPONSE OF THE MARKET TO A MAXIMUM VOLUME LEVEL THAT A DIRECTION OF THE MARKET MOVEMENT is one of main rules assisting to be rightly oriented along the market movement direction. This means that if a maximal volume level is positioned as resistance and when approaching it, “rebound” down occurs, it means sales are prevailed in the market (see the schemes below). And the larger a significant level (see level rating by formation time) which is positioned as resistance, the longer and stronger movement from is. http://savepic.ru/743788m.png SCHEME 1 http://savepic.ru/741740m.png SCHEME 2 The schemes provided reflect another nuance of no small importance. If the rebound approaches the contact or even slightly does not achieve a maximal level до (rating volume), then it would be a signal of «strong» market, the signal of that the movement would continue and the movement nature is characterized as quick and intensive. If the rebound occurs from the zone or even slightly overlaps the maximal volume zone, usually, it is a signal of that the given movement is in the completion phase and turn is soon expected (local one: correction or global one: tendency breaking) or of consolidation and formation of new significant level as minimum.

Some examples illustrating the schemes provided above are given below Levels 1052, 5 and 1053 За were formed on Monday-Tuesday ( 6.10.08 and 7.10.08). On Wednesday those levels were broken and confirmed as resistance level from which the sale started. http://savepic.ru/774511m.png http://savepic.ru/764271m.png Monday was a day of volume accumulation and new levels arose in the range of 1020 and 1005. Those levels were also worked out as resistances and new sale from 1005. http://savepic.ru/769391m.png When a deal is concluded, it is necessary to strictly detect the period of a volume formation and wait for confirmation – «rebound» from a maximal volume level, which is an additional confirmative signal.

* Continuing to post materials from my book* http://savepic.ru/766014m.png http://savepic.ru/755774m.png See buyings in the chart http://savepic.ru/776241m.png Historically maximal volumes Intraday volume level The schemes and examples provided above are pertaining to the trend situation – strict direction in the market. We will now consider volumes work in the change zone or trend suspension Second rule. TENDENCY continues until IT does not show apparent signs of breaking point. There are, as minimum, three stages, three steps in the market movement development, which signal about that the existing tendency has suspended as minimum and has changed as maximum: broke. First step.Intraday volumes fix unusually large indicators at a point opposite to the market movement: at the bottom, should the tendency have been bearish, at the top, should the tendency was bullish. (If average values for intra-trend movement at S&amp;P500 are about 20 000-30 000 lots per day, then values considerably exceeding those in marked points are the first signal to suspend the existing movement) Second step. Some «platform» for a potential turn is formed, when the aggregate indicators of volumes for the whole period of the market’s horizontal movement must be comparable by size with volume indicators at the beginning of trend.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Third step. If the tendency has actually changed, there must be the last confirmative moment of tendency breaking: the nearest significant level of maximal volumes positioned as resistance must be broken and transformed into support by a local volume. You may visually see the given mechanism on the scheme: http://savepic.ru/741425m.png The given mechanism functions within different time periods. The schemed would remain the same, should it be an intraday turn only or a global tendency change. Only volume indicators values needed to stop and reverse the tendency differ. And should about 50 000 lots be enough for local intraday reversal at S&amp;P, then a volume from 150 000 lots would be needed for more significant (weekly or intra-month) reversal. Third rule. The rule о f correspondence (divergence), growth (drop) of volume indicators to arising (extinction) of the tendency existing at a given moment, i.e.: a volume must confirm the market movement direction.

--- 帖子 #444 ---
Table below visually demonstrates that rule: http://savepic.ru/784432m.png § VOLUME-ACTION PRIORITY We have three options with regard to making a decision, taking an action on the market: buying, selling and inaction. First rule: should you decide to act, the selection of a priority is determined by the tendency being medium-term as minimum (1-3 months) and existing in the market at a given moment . http://savepic.ru/776240m.png And if you speculate even within a day (on the chart of 13.11. 08), always remember and better keep before your eyes a chart with a long-term tendency (see the chart below). Account maximal volume levels determined for a long-term period. Intraday buying in the given example (13.11.08) IS NECESSARY to fix at 903/906 level being the level of significant volume indicators for a longer period. http://savepic.ru/777264m.png Second rule: the shorter a time period in which correction develops (anti-trend) you have decided to use, the more risky it is for you. (We used in the above example the speculation against the middle-term trend, which provided us with time and price option to realize a dealing). In the case of speculation against a daily trend, time and price provision is less and accordingly, risk is considerably higher.

GC(gold) analysis During previous week gold has made significant levels from tight price range with large volumes. http://savepic.ru/747382m.png Levels indicated on the picture will be important for Monday. We will enter the market from them and 963-966. Short positions are in priority, as these are largest prices of current contract. Current (DEC09) contract has started a week ago and already S.O.T. index reports from Dollar Index tell us that during last week largest part of positions on the market was made by Biggest Dogs. That is confirmation for us for a good move on a Gold market next week.

Analysts assure that now the trend in the gold market is absent — metal trades in back trend As the reason, containing growth, is called oversolding of gold concerning other metals. At the same time as basic "locomotive" for a rise in prices of gold we see dynamics of prices of currencies, the American dollar, showing the declining tendency already for few months. The new Gold futures contract (DEC09) is already trading for 2 weeks. Maximum levels for the last 2 weeks will be key levels for market movement in forthcoming week, it is 963 and 966 that at present is top, and has been worked off on Thursday, and also 958-959 and 947-948 that are main prices of this week.

Hi Alex Just wanted to say thankyou for you informative thread. Really enjoying your approach to trading. I have a couple of questions. When a contract becomes available to the market do you tend to sit on the sidelines until the big players establish a base level for volumes.i.e Contract begins Sept 01 do you begin trading that particular contract in its early days and if so do you use the volume high of the previous contract period to establish the corridor. Secondly how do i get hold of the demo volfix platform that you use ?

--- 帖子 #459 ---
is still volfix price 3000000000000 dollars a month per instrument? too expensive 300 dollars a month per instrument is too expensive, maybe because it has a bloomberg looking

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Hello Alex, I enjoy reading your posts but could I ask you to write a post with some specific trade entry and trade exit rules. Along with some charts with notes on them. I think this would help everyone get a better understanding. Regards, Jeff

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Hi Yes I mainly trade in firts 2/3 od the contract period and only after appearance of large positions, and yes i use previous contract leargest volumes...trial access you may get on their site. Regards

Hi Aleksey, I've enjoyed reading this thread, please do continue. Here is what I have for the spot market. The volume comes from FXCM 's feed which is fed from a collection of their liquidity providers. So far, it seems very accurate. So the images below are for GBPUSD. Bias is still heavily to the short side.

--- 帖子 #476 ---
Hello Later I will post here volumes from bloomberg feed on british pound, for you to check whether your data is correct or not Yesterday on Columbus day it was not very patriotical for US to put their dollar down, but today why not- bad inflation outlook or whatever they did, so now we hear that weak dollar drives gold prices higher, madness.. http://savepic.ru/870235m.png http://savepic.ru/917338m.png Volumes at hights: http://savepic.ru/905050m.png http://savepic.ru/873306m.png

Very accurate trading Aleksey. Same strategy still? CME changed the way volume is reported on ES, is it affecting you?

I always try to develop my strategies, but still everything is based on volume...CME tries to make it less public, but anyway I get the same data as before from my feed sources.

Here is GBP today after the big rally which started yesterday at the Max Quarterly Volume. The blue lines are also levels from the previous quarter's volume chart, and it still surprises me how accurate it is. The yellow is max 2hr volume. I find 1 hr max vol in forex makes for a lot of confusion and 2hr is a sweetspot, providing good targets for scalps and places for some support/resistance. Is this how you incorporate these small period max vols in your trading?

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Mine are a bit more complicated, includes more parametres, but you are doing good, going in right direction, except one thing, try to take volume from futures markets, if you don`t do it still.

--- 帖子 #500 ---
Ok, I will think some more about the short periods and how to use them . About the futures volume, I understand that might be better, but logic says that if the futures fx trading only accounts for 10% of all the volume in the fx market, then using what I am using might be as good if I want to trade the spot market. Look how effective the levels are, even if the volume is possibly no more than 20-30% of total traded volume. The only benefit I see in using the futures volume is to see the number of contracts traded, because I'm not completely sure what are the units quoted in this volume I have, maybe millions. Who knows.

Well here is my activity for today. I am so pissed that I was kicked out of this cable rally prematurely. A couple of small negatives from early asia not shown in image.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
NYSE stocks as an alternative for Forex and Futures: I started to look at shares, it became interesting to make at least the most simple system. So I have looked at BAC, APPLE, Cisco, IBM, MSFT, APA... I was surprised. On futures daily levels work from time to time, and it is not enough just to use on futures daily volumes...for futures there are other strategies..But on shares daily levels are working more accurately. It is the most simple trading system which it is possible to use. The matter is that on futures risks in times more than on shares. That means that investor may cause serious damage to deposit after 3 trades... On shares that would be much harder. If to talk about expensive shares (google for example), then risk is comparable. If to trade shares which price is less than 50$, risk is not big, but at the same it is possible to get without serious problems about 10-15 % in month. Actually it is even simplier than its looks. I think that this information remains not without interest. On an example shares of APPL from 06.10.09 until now, and Ihave simply started to set a range of large volume of last days, and considered more or less nearby standing levels. Here`s what I got: 07.10: http://savepic.ru/898771m.png 08.10: http://savepic.ru/887507m.png 09.10: http://savepic.ru/888531m.png 12.10: http://savepic.ru/886483m.png

If the dollar rallies- it`s an exuce to sell for profit. Thats how should be described today`s trading day on gold, silver, platinum and palladium markets. Analyst are common in recommendations to use every declining move to buy more as dollar "has further to drop". 19 of 26 asked traders and investors are waiting continuing of rally next week. But I have no such optimistic and bullish fellings. For this contract gold have reached a target of +200 dollars per ounce. Time to fix, shorts should start taking their place.

I have started to write the robot based on some systems that I posted in screens.. As a result robot opens and closes trades exactly where it should, but there is one minus- it also makes higher quantity of trades than it should... I am currently working on the system of filtration of false entry points that is in fact the hardest part. Here is robot based on simple strategy (trend system), with t/p of 4 pips and loss - 6 (don`t be surprised). With this one situation is much simplier: http://savepic.org/209799m.png A graphic from 05.01.00 to 09.02.2010: http://savepic.org/203655m.png Numbers show results of trades with quantity -10 lots. It`s about 2500$ return for 1 lot, with not agressive money management system - and that would be about 10k deposit, with 25 % annual return. But of course - the biggest attention to the most difficult strategies and robots, so there would be a lot of work.

Hi everybody. I've a question to you, Alex. Is there possibility to see DoM in volfix like in post http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=575 ? What software do you use to make and test robots, based on volfix volume trading ?

--- 帖子 #581 ---

Hello everyone! I receive many requests - to give any advice where it is possible to get access to volume data. First of all- be ready for a long learning period, it will take a lot of time till you`ll get used to volume and start to develop low risk strategies. I will post here different trading platforms which allows to analyse volume and will comment to what volume confirmations I am currently paying attention. So today I am paying attention to gold market: to Friday volumes on 1157-1158. Best scenario would be if market would go below that levels- to start shorting. http://savepic.org/460187m.gif

Price is working off key current week levels. Price is above highest volume levels of contract and current month. Potentially a profitable long trade if significant volume comes in.... What do you think Alex?

This is a great thread. Why did everyone stop posting?

Red = Max volume of contract Yellow = Max volume of previous week White = Max volume of previous day Pink = Intra-day max volume (max volume of hour 07:00 - 08:00 London time, which is 01:00 - 02:00 chicago time) This is a key hour. Other key hours which could be used for intra-day level include: 08:00 - 09:00 09:00 - 10:00 London time

Firstly i would like to commend you for the quality information you have given here. I would like to add "Principles of market movements" to my trading system,but i have questions. My question is how/where can i get information on market volume/programs working with feed that will give me price and market volume information? Also, how do i know if i am to buy or sell with respect to the market volume? (ie. at a specific price/contract with highest volume....). Hope to hear from you. Thank you.

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Hi, First take as much historical data as you can. Choose market and start research- I already showed to what volume levels you should pay attention. For software- PM me. I think it`s not allowed to write it here. Regards, Alex

--- 帖子 #616 ---
hey Alex I am just wondering what settings you used to generate this chart. I notice that you only display ticks where volume was greater than 40 however, i notice that your volume bar limit is 80 however you have ticks that are greater than 80. When I choose a Volume range of 80, it only plots a range of trades up to 80 never above, just wondering how you got that chart? Can you instead look at a 1M chart of the volume? http://savepic.ru/376528.png

Try to wait for bigger corrections, after volume level is formed, there should be at least 8-10 pips correction and only then you wait for rebound.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
Thanks for you reply. I trade forex and i have been trading for a while now.

Alex Hello. I have been spending the last few days playing around with your strategies and for some reason I am having a hard time getting any help from volumes on the forex pairs 6E 6B 6J. It seems that pipsings or max volume from prior day doesn't mean much in these markets. It seems completely random. However I compared it to ES CL and GC and it seems that it works much better. The max volumes do play a role in the way price moves. So do your strategies no longer work with forex futures?

--- 帖子 #622 ---
hi sir do u mind adding me in ua skype plizz

--- 帖子 #623 ---
There are more ways to get volumes now. For example use different plugins to Ninja Trader. Or use MD. Or use Volfix, as they have useful database. My skype is aleksey_trader if you still have questions.

--- 帖子 #624 ---
First of all - currensies are the noisiest markets. Thats why important levels are often changed. If you start developing strategies based on volume for indeces you will get better results.

--- 帖子 #625 ---
Filter of ticks is now aviable for everyone on HVA ( http://dotnettrading.blogspot.com/p/hva-software.html ) Very useful for analysis of activity. Example what happened on 7th of Dec (historical high on gold): http://savepic.ru/2187251m.png http://savepic.ru/2172915m.png

--- 帖子 #657 ---
Thank you Alex for answer, i tried it and works fine but it works only by txt file no real-time and i think that the analysis of volumes in real time is very interesting. I use NinjaTrader and i would like know if there is an indicator for NT that shows price volumes in a cluster mode as "Visual volume". Thanks again.

--- 帖子 #658 ---
Hi Alex! I am very interested in using currency futures to predict movements in spot. In particular i am very interested in Market Delta. However with futures only making up a small part of FX do you think its an accurate indicator of Volume? When informed large money comes into the futures market do you think that corresponds to the big money in spot? Do you think the footprint chart in market delta for futures can apply for spot? Would love to know your thoughts on this as for me it would be incredibly useful. Thanks

--- 帖子 #659 ---
It definetly corresponds. A 100% correlation between currency spot-market and currency futures is a provement to this. Spot-market has different places for transactions and market participants use currency futures, as a reference point for transactions on spot market. Volume data from currency futures allows to define trades, time and prices which initiate movements.

--- 帖子 #660 ---
Yes it`s made for analysis on history. Real-time data would be in a month. For ninja-trader there is an indicator "volume researcher" from traderswell

Great! very interesting, i will try it, thank you!!

what is that exchange from which u get forex datafeed?

--- 帖子 #679 ---
just an mt4 broker and the tick volume on the custom like today i can see we hav big tick volume left at 1.3820 so am expecting eu to get the there today and the week opened below kast week tick volume same same yesterdays volume.so i took short from 1.3910 trailing it to 1.3820 i hope i interpreted correctly like u do

--- 帖子 #680 ---
The biggest problem with these products is that you do not trade on an exchange and it is not regulated. That means your mt4 volume isn`t correct. What you see is quantity of ticks but not summarized volume of every tick.

--- 帖子 #681 ---
ok sir but the tp on eu finally hit at 1.3820 may be am lucky but for the past two weeks everything is going fine if am using on wat i have read on this read i.e is ua style. By the r u still using visual or which broker do u use sir

While Friday's dramatic skid lower in the precious metals was later blamed somewhat on a leaked margin hike (as well as the simultaneous and anti-empirical sell-off in 30Y), it seems the liquidations that were rumored (whether hedgie or central banker) are in play once again as both gold and silver (the latter very significantly!) are finding little support. After some early weakness (EUR strength), the China news we noted earlier and general lack of any actionable rescue plan or large-scale money-printing has markets in a decidedly risk-off mode for the last few hours as ES shifts into the red and very early credit runs show 2-3bps widening in the front-end of the European indices.(zerohedge) Today Shanghai Gold Exchange Hikes Silver Margin By 20%, and as a result silver is 12% lower from friday close. http://savepic.su/16605.htm] http://savepic.su/16605m.jpg [/URL] Gold/Silver ratio made new hights and back to levels of sep 2010: http://savepic.su/25819.htm] http://savepic.su/25819m.gif [/URL] On Friday ES closed underperformed to basket of risk assets (aud/jpy, eur/jpy, eur/usd, 2-10 yeild spread, gold, oil), which allowed to use large volume levels on asian and european session for shorts for cl/ gold/euro and longs for es: http://savepic.su/50386.htm] http://savepic.su/50386m.gif [/URL] http://savepic.su/23762.htm] http://savepic.su/23762m.jpg [/URL] http://savepic.su/57557.htm] http://savepic.su/57557m.jpg [/URL]

The S&amp;P cash made new lows for the year as we aggressively probed lower into the close and penetrated Doug Kass's bottom from Aug 9th with cash and futures closing below 1100 back to 13 month lows, with the pain spreading wide following rumors of hedge fund blow ups. BAC -2.7% at $5.38 (at 3/12/09 levels) MS -2.2% at $12.2 (at 12/03/08 levels) C -2.3% at $22.58 (at 3/16/09 levels) GS -1.6% at $88.6 (at 3/11/09 levels) JPM -2.1% at $28.05 (at 4/08/09 levels) WFC -1.6% at $22.8 (just above recent lows) http://savepic.su/133341.gif Credit markets were a disaster with red everywhere and notable gaps suggesting some desperate reaching for hedges/unwinds as index overlays started to disengage from single-names. We have warned that sooner or later, managers/traders will need to sell/unwind longs as basis risk in the hedges/overlays becomes too much and the moves today suggest we are getting there (especially in financials) - zerohedge Instead of its normal sideways plod after Europe closes, FX markets continued to weaken dramatically against the USD with only JPY holding stronger while EUR broke to a 1.31 handle and closed at its lows of the day as DXY managed to trade at its highest since Jan 13th 2011. Gold and Silver managed decent gains (the former outperforming the latter) as oil and copper lost 2-3% on the day. http://savepic.su/156865.jpg http://savepic.su/193756.jpg As we closed broad risk assets ( CONTEXT ) and the S&amp;P managed to reconnect - with ES overshooting a little after cash closed. While relative to credit we still see 20-30pts of downside for the S&amp;P (based on current HY levels which obviously can deteriorate), we need to see further weakness in carry FX and oil as well as strength and flattening in TSYs (more 2s10s30s compression) to really 'enable' this sell-off to reach January levels. http://savepic.su/174300.jpg http://savepic.su/164060.jpg

Moody's ITA downgrade took some shine off as EUR drops 60 pips and ES now 13pts off its highs. On the basis of old news, more promises, lack of any clarity, and Dexia's dump on the Belgian government, the equity markets staged a 4% rally in the last 45 minutes to end an incredible day. Our assumption is that this was simply the bounce that everyone expected as we seemed to have squeezed shorts into lunch and were limping back lower on AAPL disappointment. Quite clearly, there were a few uncomfortable equity shorts who were squeezed out rapidly and incessantly as the S&amp;P massively outperformed credit as well as the broad basket of risk assets - even TSYs only managed to sell back to earlier day's high yields (as opposed to extending). Gold/Silver rallied (though well off week highs) as the USD dumped back near the week's lows and copper and oil rallied but again no where near as ebullient as stocks. Evidently, the equity move is exuberant at best but these squeezes seem able to maintain longer than anyone expects. - zerohedge. The clearest example of the exaggerated move in equities is probably against the broad-basket of risk assets known as CONTEXT which tracked very well all day but was simply unable to keep up with the covering in ES as we rallied. While it does not mean equities are absolutely expensive, it does imply there is a disconnect between risk appetites relatively speaking and would suggest equity weakness short-term. http://savepic.su/176023.jpg http://savepic.su/159639.jpg We had noted all day that credit was underperforming - - suggesting forced long covering or horizon changes (from short to long) in macro to micro hedging. The indices in general did not initially follow ES but as the rally took hold they started to catch up (understandably so) but significantly underperformed ES as we closed. AAPL was the story of the middle of the day as it failed to provide an iPhone 5 (all-singing-all-dancing awesomeness) and fell more than 5% at one point (testing its 200DMA) before ripping back higher to its VWAP and then a little more to close down around 0.6%. Sectorally, it is more what we would expect from a bounce day - the heavily shorted and prime-for-a-short-squeeze financials ripped almost 6.5% higher in that last 45 minutes. Amazingly, MS is now +3.25% from Friday's close, rallying 14.5% in the last 45 minutes with Goldman and Wells Fargo also making into the green on the week. - - zerohedge http://savepic.su/139156.gif FX saw the USD dump as AUD ripped higher as did every other major (apart from JPY) as carry FX took off - it was initially delayed in its response but once we got going in ES it didn't take long to rip. Precious metals and commodities all managed to rally back as the dollar lost ground with oil finding the day's highs but copper, gold, and silver all stayed well of the earlier day's highs. http://savepic.su/133015.jpg

--- 帖子 #697 ---
The pictures below show the price dinamycs of s&amp;p against a basket of risky assets. On a short-term basis, CONTEXT is implying that broad risk assets are not following the excitement ор pessimism in stocks as aggressively which leads to corrections. Unusual was situation on this week when s&amp;p on the way down was leading risk - which is unusual though not unique - but during rallies we very seldom see s&amp;p stay above and hold above CONTEXT for long. That may help to indentify direction in short-term and analyse reactions of TSY 2s10s30s, commodity and FX carry (for longs) and s&amp;p (for short). For entry points I recomend to use analysis of tick volume. Currently it feels like s&amp;p is a little overdone (above CONTEXT from Thursday close). http://savepic.su/184883.gif 28_09: http://savepic.su/176691.jpg 29_09: http://savepic.su/167475.jpg 30_09: http://savepic.su/168499.jpg 4_10: http://savepic.su/151091.jpg

Hi Alex, Have spent hours trying to sort out the OEC trader demo, looks like the footprint software is no longer available for the demo, and I'm also not getting the option for the ESH( contracts. I have the option for straight EUR/USD forex pair, but I don't think that's the same as the futures market is it?

--- 帖子 #700 ---
Usually eurusd pair quotes are same that euro futures (just traded with 5-8 pips disctount or premium). It also depends of your quotes provider (I guess it`s forex broker). However euro futures quotes and volumes are more reliable and I would use them for analysing fx pairs moves.

Monday: ..the huge shift in the whole WTI crude complex that is perhaps more fascinating. For the first time since May 2011, Dec 11 WTI is more expensive than Dec 12 and in the last three trading days alone, the entire curve has shifted to backwardation very aggressively. This inflation-prone signal.. http://savepic.su/468078.png A fundamental long signal (such backwardations resulted in few week longs for cl). From the point of view of volume analysis, not ofter CL gives such clear long singals: http://savepic.su/462958.jpg

The tight correlation between various risk factors and the S&amp;P futures market are well-known and often discussed here. These factors include FX carry, commodities, Treasuries (absolute and curve/butterfly), and swap/credit markets. yesterday was one of those mildly odd days when ES was playing catch up to a risk-basket that was driven significantly by three main factors, EURJPY, TSY, and 2s10s30s butterfly. http://savepic.su/508608.png about 10:00 (chicago time) ES was undervalued and at 1218,5 we saw largest tick volume accumulations (big longs). http://savepic.su/515776.jpg Correlation between EURO futures and TSY (10yr): http://savepic.su/509635.png Euro was overvalued compared to tsy about 13 o`clock (ct), and big shorts after 13 identified a point at which euro pulled back. http://savepic.su/480960.jpg

After being perfectly in sync with europeans and us equities for a while, oil dramatically disconnected move appeared yesterday: http://savepic.su/672877m.png Short Oil did make some sense after large ticks volume appeared at the top. More likely it was technical move, less likely (as we see from result) inside information about the Israel-Iran situation that none of us knew. http://savepic.su/666730m.png

Zerohedge presented interesting simple trading strategy: being long gold in the overnight session, and shorting it during the day. Strategy had shown a return of 143% in the last year and annualized 37.46% for the last 10 years. http://savepic.net/2311971m.jpg http://savepic.net/2318115m.jpg Research has showed that most upside movements on gold happens on bullish Asian session and most downside movements happen between am and pm fixing on gold - USA session. I checked volume on Asian session for last contract and got interesting results - a lot of downside movements on Asia session were followed by large tick volumes and then market retraced.

Hi Alex. I discovered your post some time ago, but put it aside for a while. I'm trading VSA these days and find one of the best methods to trade. Would it be ok if I add you on skype to get some more insights from you about the methods you use and to exchange some knowledge? Thanks a lot and looking forward to your new posts. Cheers, L

hello, everyone! So from 1st of April we have new 06/12 futures contract on Gold. So what has already happened and what can we expect further? First, picture of 2 weeks: http://savepic.net/2735453m.png As you can see previous week started from big fall to the area 1652-1653 which market participants met with dramatically increased volume of transactions. As a result, there was a pullback for the next few days. Here you can see it more in details: http://savepic.net/2701661m.png Second largest ticks volume area was near 1630, this volume appeared when market was falling sharply. Reaction of the market to this volume - continue to fall for 15 points yesterday, and test of this area with confirmation shorts today: http://savepic.net/2749788m.png Breking of this area higher may be used as a signal for long positions. But be careful, they should accumulate volume in this price range before market will increase gradually. Use volume counters to track summary horizontal volumes at prices. Have a good trading everyone!

--- 帖子 #717 ---
Current situation on eur/usd: As you can see, every large volume at the bottom results in a pullback - the largest was yesterday at 1,3125. Todays first volume was broken lower and now we have a pullback from 1,3047 - area where more than 1k lots has been just accumulated: http://savepic.net/2703711m.png

Hi Alex! Great Analysis! I have noticed you have been trading by this method since 2008. So how is your trading results so far? Profitable ?

--- 帖子 #722 ---
I've finally reached the end of the topic and so far I have two questions: 1# Why on the markets where value doesn't have limits on both sides, when price is fallin as well as volume is, it is strong market? I'd say this right is ok for stocks, where most people only buy or sell, without going short. But here strong volume on down move should indicate strong market conviction, isn't it? Or in the terms u used here, strong market means its bias is to go long and weak market is likely going short? 2# U have quoted here some parts of your book, could you please tell us where it is available? 3# hmm 3rd question came to my mind: could u describe volume trading strategies for currencies or the way the important vol level changes? Greetings

--- 帖子 #723 ---
Hello! That`s right. I started from volume analysis and continue trading it. Although I had different periods, I`m satisfied with results.

Hello! Nice to see you analysing this material seriously. Add me in slype aleksey_trader and I will send you book volume trading. I will try to answer your question in pictures with example of Dollar Index: 2 weeks ago we saw a fall on rising volume: http://savepic.net/3087634m.png http://savepic.net/3140885m.png http://savepic.net/3144981m.png Picture is same if we check volume profile: http://savepic.net/3130645m.png http://savepic.net/3133717m.png

I'm glad u're still alive I hope u don't live in flooded area? Thanks for your answers, now everything is clear. U see i used to think about volume in bars under the chart, so this is where i did my mistake. Let me please repeat my last question: what can u tell us about volume strategies and changes for currencies? Thx for your nick name, I've send u a message via skype. Greetings

--- 帖子 #727 ---
I don't understand why two bottom levels are there, when volume profile does not show those prices as the ones wit highest volume? Are they there because those levels were highest ones in the past, when those prices were reached?

--- 帖子 #728 ---
As many people have asked, what do you base your actual entry criteria on? Volume builds at certain prices so you know they're going to be important. Ok, I understand that, but that still does not reveal to you whether it will be a buy or sell! From what I can see you base your entries on chart patterns, i.e. accumulation at a price and then the market moves away and then comes back to the same area - what you call the 'rebound'. However, during the accumulation phase the market still goes up and down so it is ALWAYS going away and coming back. How do you know how much the market has to move/return before it is considered a valid rebound and thus a signal to buy or sell? Also, just say the market goes up a little and comes back, how do you know to buy when it approaches the volume area? It could go under the volume area and become a sell! From what I could see, you did not reveal this absolutely critical step to successful trading in any of your posts. What you did say is that you 'do not predict the market'. Well, I am sorry, but unless you are doing some kind of hedging strategy, EVERYONE who places a trade is trying to predict the market. When you buy then you are predicting the market will go up and when you sell you are predicting it will go down. So saying you do not predict is a lie. That brings us back to the same old question of HOW do you make your predictions? I shall use your very own charts to show there is something missing from what you have taught us and how volume as described by you here is not enough for successful trading. This is not to be interpreted as an antagonistic post. I just want you to reveal what it is you are withholding from us about how you ACTUALLY DECIDE ON THE DIRECTION TO TRADE. In the picture below I have copied your original diagrams to show the accumulation phase and in it you will see my problems with what you have taught: http://savepic.su/2267589.htm You then try to show 'real world' examples of these diagrams with a couple of chart pictures of the Euro Futures. Here is your first one which showed the volume accumulating. I have added my own comments to it: http://savepic.org/2396334.htm After that you showed us the same chart one day later to show us an example of a rebound. This is great with the power of hindsight, but as you can see in MY version of your very same pic that there were a couple of times when the market approached the special volume price level that you ignored. I have pointed these out at the left of the chart and once again I must ask you what it is you are NOT telling us about selecting your entries: http://savepic.su/2230725.htm Thank you for your time reading this. I realise its been years since you first posted and probably have changed how you do things. Nevertheless, I would still like an explanation some time whenever you are online.

Hmm, my pictures don't seem to have hyperlinked to my first post. I will try to attach them here instead.

--- 帖子 #730 ---
Hello, mate! Two bottom levels on picture indicate prices with highest volume during short period of time. I analyse not only summary volume with the help of volume profile but also prices where volume rises most in a moment. As you can see on picture while market rised, there were two times when volume rised sharply during short time - on prices 804,5 and 815 (centers of circles) - it was the highest volume increase in a moment for more than few month. As a result, you may see a correction on the market after this volume. Correction was on low trading volume - which you may see on volume profile as well. Take a look at this situation: http://savepic.net/3173626m.png http://savepic.net/3172602m.png You may see shorts appeared after rebound on S&amp;P 500 eminies: http://savepic.net/3171578m.png

Hi Alex, Its nice to read your thread, eventhough i havent finished reading it, i must say its the most interesting thread in ff. I just wondering if I still can get trial of your software and the english manual if already available. Thank you

--- 帖子 #733 ---
Hi Alex, Can I have the book title &amp; author if you dont mind, because im also interested. Thanks

--- 帖子 #734 ---
Thx for your answer friend. So you say that the biggest orders may determine market movement for next few days/weeks/months, depending on how big the order is and how it's implemented into the market? One more thing is I sent you an email and tried to reach U on skype, unfortunatelly unsuccessfuly, so I like to ask u here if U find english version of the book we've talked about? Greetings

The software Clusterdelta, that you see, is free, no payment, it displays the futures volumes from CME. Are available currencies, metals, energy and indexes. If you like it, download from here and follow the numbering: http://clusterdelta.com/platform#download

--- 帖子 #739 ---
Too bad the site is only in Russian, it seems to be full of many useful resources...

--- 帖子 #740 ---
Hello, thanks for sharing your trading insights with us. really appreciate it. I have used the software but then i have a lot of questions regarding the price level relationship with volume. Those areas with high volume are the significant buy and sell areas. my questions are 1. what is acceleration of volumes ? is it after the major volume (red/orange boxes) appear, the price will move for quite a distance ? 2. the data comes from futures market ? thank you

--- 帖子 #630 ---
1. No, the acceleration is a dV/dt, a sudden variation of V contracts in a short period of time. V contracts may have an average during the day, a sudden deviation from the statistical average marks an acceleration. 2. Yes it comes from CME Chicago (currencies, energy, S&amp;P500), COMEX (metals) and ICE New York (dollar index).

--- 帖子 #631 ---
in your opinion, how accurate is the data ?? from my understanding not all of the transactions goes through CME. got some more questions on this Volume = Ask + Bid ?? Delta = Ask - Bid can you determine the buy and sell(direction) from delta ? I have noticed at the certain turning point, the delta value becomes a few times higher than usual, the consecutive bars will be a strong move.

--- 帖子 #632 ---
I have compared it with other software such as volfix, marketdelta, ninjatrader and they are the same data. The difference is that CD is a bit slower. Yes, volume are ask+bid and delta is ask-bid. I consider the acceleration at the point of control of the past days, (expecially if they are "naked"=they were never touched). +the POC in real, of the act day, only after the 12 pm-13 pm (Chicago or New York time), when the American volumes stabilize. At these points I apply the rules of graphic rebounds that are contained in this topic. In addition the delta must make an inverse spike, in case of reverse short: large volume + large positive delta, and immediately after large negative delta. The inversion long: large volume + large negative delta and immediately after large positive delta. The volumetric spikes are the same of grafic pin bars, have the same meaning. In correspondence of accelerations if these factors are lacking they are continuation patterns and not the reverse.

--- 帖子 #633 ---
WOW. thanks man i actually use futures data for my order flow analysis

--- 帖子 #634 ---
thanks again. another question is the line which you decide to trade on. Is it the weekly most traded line with the highest volume ?? or can the same principles be applied on a smaller time frame ?? Lets say be traded on M15 timeframe. there was once i spotted a trade on oil, the price spiked up to the highest volume line of the day and then reversed down for about $2. wow that was really unbelievable that it reversed on that level.

--- 帖子 #635 ---
another question is why the data from futures are sometimes different from spot price ?? the data from CD sometimes is higher than what i see at spot.

--- 帖子 #636 ---
It can be applied on each TF, change the target profit. I personally use only daily POC, do not use contract, month, weeks or intraday POC. I see the daily POC, quickly, every morning, from this site (apart Clusterdelta): http://fxcoder.ru/services/futures-volumes or: http://trading-evolution.com/forum/portal.php Then the acceleration is always on 1m on Clusterdelta. The accelerations form a normal distribution which is with mean and standard deviation. For example I show you all the distribution for the euro/usd: European session: From 2am to 8:30am (New York Time): American session, from 8:31am to 17pm (New York time): I usually imposed two filters: one at 70% and the second at 90%, then they are 382 contracts and 480 contracts in the american session. On days with high volatile and news I can put them even more stringent, for example 85% and 95%.

--- 帖子 #637 ---
The table does not show well, it is a normal distribution: probability in % and number of contracts. 100% = 1757 97.5% = 569 95% = 528 92.5% = 501 90% = 480 etc.

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Yes, it is normal, at the beginning of each contract (March, June, September and December) there is a difference between futures and spot that gradually decreases towards the end of each futures contract.

--- 帖子 #639 ---
Another useful means in addition, the differences (divergences) between the price (above) and the cumulative delta (below)

--- 帖子 #640 ---
could you show on the charts ? i cannot imagine how these calculations come about. Thank you. acceleration of volume on M1 charts ? means all of the big volumes are not separated over a price level but always can be seen at M1 ?

--- 帖子 #641 ---
clusterdelta is marketdelta except marketdelta charge for the service just go to clusterdelta.com translate from russian to you own language and download it thats all i did saves paying a monthly subscription for the exact same thing WENDIGO

--- 帖子 #642 ---
The distribution was calculated by recording all accelerations 1m for 6 months, then I made a statistical study with mean, standard deviation etc. Yes, the acceleration can be studied only at low time frame, it would be better in terms of seconds if possible. Perhaps you are referring to POC, but it is a different concept. In figure where I place the two filters 70% and 90%, with an example of a set up short.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
thanks for showing me so many information. I'll get back to you if i got more questions. Have a happy holidays and a good trading year for 2013 !

--- 帖子 #644 ---
OK, happy holidays.

--- 帖子 #645 ---
Hi Dimitri, i have another question for you. i've been testing by using values of delta for smaller timeframe but not very effective. However i will not give up and will devise a way to counter the market noise. I do use another indicator on MT4 which is cumulative delta indicator. it detects the number of delta much like the number on the top of ClusterDelta software number and plots it in a line. What i want to ask is have you noticed a pattern where when the cumulative delta becomes from very negative turning into positive, the price will soon revert from a downtrend to uptrend on daily chart ? recently GU has been downtrend and trending down about 500pips. On last friday, the cumulative delta starts to go up (less positive), yet the price still goes down about 140pips. after that a strong reversal is seen (about 250pips) till now. Is it smart money is buying as the trend moves down ?
