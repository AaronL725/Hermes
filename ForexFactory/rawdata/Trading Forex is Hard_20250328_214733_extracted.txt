Attached Image (click to enlarge) Entries are the arrows after stops get taken out on each of those areas. Yes there will be losses, small ones if you trade on 1min. Opportunities? Countless everyday per pair. If you think this is hard to make money with, I dont know what to say to you. No technical analysis. No Fundamentals. No Indicators. Wake up in the morning and get your money.

--- 帖子 #2 ---
What are you trying to say with this? However I agree, Once I started using only S/R my account went from 500 USD to 3400 USD in the week of trading. However I deleted everything later once I got "hungry" again. This could be a nice thread.

--- 帖子 #3 ---
Well what im saying is, would you risk 2 pips to gain 10? lol. People over analyze and concentrate way too much when trading, just take the damn trade. That's all ill say.

--- 帖子 #4 ---
Yes I would. That was exactly what I did. Works great as long as you follow rules. Oh, I forgot to say that I was using tick chart because that was much more accurate than 1minute. I even had a site where banks levels were displayed, and on those levels price reversed amazingly even when NFP happened. On 1 minute chart I was unable to get exact entry, but on tick, that was something different. I would say if you want to be accurate, do not use minute but tick chart. You will see a big difference.

What strategy is this? Can I know this strategy in a bit of detailed way. Can anyone please explain this to me. It would be a real life saver for me.

In the cases which you have marked "stops have not been taken out" except number 7 which is ok

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Could you explain your strategy please mate? More than tripling your account in a week is impressive! Please enlighten us!

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Thank you for your reply. But what do you mean by that? Because when I think "stops" I think about stoploss but certainly that is not what you meant. If possible could you zoom in on the chart and show a example of one of yours that worked and one of mine and show why the entry didn't work. Thank you in advance

--- 帖子 #13 ---
It Is impressive, sure. But I should also say that I deleted that account later. I literally stopped using any stoploss and MM. However all my trades were still OK. Funny to say, but account was deleted just because when I run out of margin, price reversed where I wanted. But It was too late. I'm working on system I will make public later. However it need some work. I want something special. Also you will need tick charts. (Probably). I recommend cTrader for this. I love that platform. Just a friendly advice. I will try to find my old picture with tick vs minute chart comparsion. Should be visible what I mean. Or I can release system without the needed polishment. I am not sure what I missed. But I do not feel It is ready.

--- 帖子 #14 ---
hi can you tell me what indicator is that please ?

--- 帖子 #15 ---
I believe it shows you how much profit (in pips) you get in a trade.

--- 帖子 #16 ---
Good thread mate...

--- 帖子 #17 ---
it simply means that you identify a high then that high gets broken and price moves back below that high that is where you enter a short trade. Have a look at your own number 7 mark, you have drawn a line on the last high, that line gets broken and then price moves back below your line and that is your entry short

--- 帖子 #18 ---
Thank you for the explanation. In that case the place that I marked 6 there is an entry if I extended the line a little bit more to the right. Whats the exit strategy?

--- 帖子 #19 ---

Hi everyone, I'm new with Forex. I've just opened a 50$ live account and try the first order. I set the stop loss and I didn't close my order. Then it closed by itself ( very far from the stop loss ). Can anyone explain if I did something wrong here? Pls see attached photo

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Just take the trade?! That's not easy... Do you use stop orders? For me to be quick I have to ambush price... Thanks for the thread Regards S.

It's Pivot Trading system.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
This strategy has been used so many times before. Stophunts are used by market makers. Market makers arent hunting stops on a 1 minute chart though and you will never know if it will be a stop hunt a break of s/r. Unless you bring some other type of skill to this system you are going to lose your money. Newbies beware. I really wish people wouldnt make threads that make it look this easy because its not lol.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
I believe he wants you to understand that it is better to lose 4 pips and get 10 than trade 1H chart with 25 SL for profit of for example 10 pips. You can lose 6 trades with 4 pips SL, but 6 trades with 25 SL will give you 150 pips lose. 6x4 is only 24. So you can take a trade because profit will be bigger than stoploss. You will endup with more wins than loses. You don't actually need to know if it is break or not since breakouts does not happen 100% of the time.

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Trade this and you will lose your money no matter how you figure your SL or TP. The biggest issue there is in forex, is where to set your TP and SL. If your SL is too far then your 1:1 TP may be too far and never gets hit and if your SL is too close your stopped out. If your Risk is higher than your reward your loss will wipe out your wins. If your reward is higher than your risk price may not get to your TP. So what is the solution? The only solution is to find a level that will be strong enough to propel price in your trade direction and protect your stoploss, combine that with trend exhaustion/weakened momentum and targets. Price will not be pushed in your trade direction because of a "stophunt" that may or may not be there. Stophunt on the 1 minute chart? Do you think JP Morgan is acting as a market maker and looking to hunt someones stop placed on the 1 minute chart? come on man. Even if that was the case since it can be possible(not probable), you will not be able to tell when it is a breakout or stophunt. Breakouts happen all the time. Try this for a year than guaranteed you'll add 70 useless filters and then quit this system and all of this will transpire in a weeks time

--- 帖子 #33 ---
This is true. At least now I can agree. My friend have something that will show you where big banks enter the trade and where are their stops. He use Excel for this calculation. He is pretty clever and call Market Makers forex brokers a "casino". I never found out why. He gave me some secret ideas but it is very hard to get info from him. There is always a way. You just need patience and energy to look.

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Your friend knows where the banks bought and sold but your friend does not know when the banks will buy and will sell. The key difference being the word will. Small word, big difference.

You seem to have some sort of ego, but is that ego bringing you money yet? Just wondering. By the way: " The more members are talking bout other members, me or people rather than positive trading/results, the more they are simply wasting their time. Keep your eyes on the prize, eliminate all distractions by placing members like this on your " Ignore Block " list. If a trader should say something rookie, put them on your Ignore Block list. Wasting your time? Ignore Block. Lower trading experience and success? Ignore block. With forums that have a membership of over 500K member, it MUST be done to sift through all the noise You will find your entire trading experience here at FF more profitable, less noisy and more beneficial for sure." I hope you find what youre looking for, goodbye!

Intresting idea about the high/low is hunted by someone who takes the SL. Here´s a m1 trade for it. The idea was good, the execution could be better. EA -3,5 + comm. I´ll skip this pair and look for majors. Guido

--- 帖子 #47 ---
@Daumen hoch! Let me know if I get the concept correctly. Thx Guido

--- 帖子 #48 ---
I posted the stop taking out way of trading because its easier for people who dont want to think too much, I look for every support resistance nearby and then look at the support resistance within each candle, so I look at the price action move then the micro price action by candle, something like this. By the way almost every candle even on the 1 minute has its reason for reacting the way it does, thats why I say some people are lazy and just call it random. Attached Image (click to enlarge) It takes a few hours of chart watching to understand I think.

--- 帖子 #49 ---

Nice trade, if you had held on it would have been in the 100's now "bounce or break" or "break and return" only two possibilities.

--- 帖子 #71 ---
I think its important to read price behaviour live before getting in on reversals (and most importantly whilst in your trade and get out when signs appear). Attached Image There are other important factors I havent mentioned: -price support/resistance isnt precise to the pip, It can bounce just under or over a few pips off the levels (check chart below). -watching the chart live gives you a much better feel of when the price is about to turn. -watching multiple charts together without switching one by one gives you an advantage on what pair to get in and an even better feel. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #72 ---
What other things are helpful that others take for granted? Its the simplest things. You can use the stop order for the line placement on the chart, I use the bid/ask live price line to help me see exactly which levels the price is fighting off, believe it or not this is a huge help.

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Good morning. How do you spot and use these levels exactly? The larger spread about these zones? Guido

--- 帖子 #74 ---
No nothing to do with spread, simply just using the line for visual aid You dont want to buy or sell straight into a wall right? Chart below is a good example, look where the line is bouncing, Im looking for a buy but im waiting a bit longer as there is a wall there right infront.

I think this will be my last post on the thread, as I dont think much more is needed, trading is really that simple..its about having put in the hours to watch how the markets work and then getting to work and not giving up. I remember when I first started talking to the guy who got me to a consistent level of trading I used to get frustrated to the point I didn't believe he was really making any profit and lying to me. He always said something: just because it doesn't work for you it doesn't mean it wont work for somebody else, and with that I want to wish all the traders good luck and resilience in their journey in trading..and obviously never give up.

the closer your trade is to the edge of repeated touch of levels the higher chance of your trade working out and the lower your risk and stop will be. It doesnt make sense taking trades in places where there has been little to no repeated touches, its higher risk and makes less sense. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Sometimes u wont see a support level, but there will be a cluster of repeated wicks in a tiny area, that is a good sign and usually a good area to try and get in too (first red box on the left of chart)

Best thread on FF by far, we should keep it going! I've been out of the game for a bit doing other things, but saw this thread and decided to get back involved. Veni posted a great link a page ago. Reminds me of something I wrote to try to help some friends a few years ago: There are only a few options as to why to enter - breakouts, failed breakouts, or retracements. My initial assumption is that all breakouts will fail and that is the initial trade. If that fails, it is now a trend. In a trend, the best trade is a failed breakout against the trend which is the 2-leg pullback. So there are two trades I have really boiled my trading plan down into. Failed breakouts of ranges and failed breakouts against the trend, i.e 2-leg pullbacks. The only thing left is then to determine which is failing to be broken. This is where HH/HL LL/LH tracking comes into play, or as I previously have called them LRH and LRL - last reaction high/low. The LRH is the last swing high prior to the previous LL being broken. The LL will either be broken and trend will continue or the breakout will fail. The failure can be traded. If instead the trend continues, the market will at some point retrace. Two entries may occur A minor H (below the LRH) will be created, a thrust will be made back in the trend direction creating a minor L, and then a new minor HH will be created (below the LRH). However, this minor HH will fail (a failed breakout of the minor H and a 2-leg pullback). The LRH will be exceeded - a breakout. The trend is now suspect, but most breakouts fail and a failed breakout can be traded back into the trend direction (down). However, after the LRH has been broken, even if it initially appears to fail, the trend has likely switched to up. I would look to buy a 2-leg pullback or a failed breakout of the LL that created the pullback if given that deep of an opportunity. The trend may also continue which is why you trade the failed breakout of the LRH as it may have just been a search for more liquidity for true break of the previous LL in which case you will be BE by the time the 2-leg pullback (for the long) would have set up. Alternatively, the LRH may break with force. I would then look to buy the first retracement (breakout pullback) into the new up trend. That is the only time I want to buy a 1-leg pullback - the breakout pullback, or first retracement. And that's basically the summation of everything I know about the market. Of course fear and greed always as well as imperfect and inconsistent patterns make it difficult to execute the plan perfectly, but managing with a positive R:R will make the structured approach profitable. https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uXNtSO3tu...20/Sticks2.png

--- 帖子 #106 ---
Wow! Cool Stuff Many Thanks Swnlobo

--- 帖子 #107 ---
You bet! Here's a little Asia session trading, likely keep going, but this is good enough for me! The 30M was clear about the direction, the 1M provided the location, watching the price provided the trigger. The hindsight chart doesn't show the price movement during that entry bar - if you're watching live it becomes much more clear -

--- 帖子 #108 ---
A couple trades after the big news push. The first trade... pullback took out stops at the minor retrace during the push up. Traded back up to the previous high and monitored (instead of profit target) to see if it would break with force or stall... it broke, but then stalled so exited. The second trade was a little less clear, but the move lower below the blue box was rejected, and then I traded the second higher low which also coincided with the channel break (late on the entry). Traded that up to the last minor high

--- 帖子 #109 ---
Trade 1: Pullback to support turned resistance. Waited to see if it would break at the prior low, but didn't wait long enough. While the outcome could have been better, feel okay about how this was managed. I gave it some room to breath but didn't work out. As Veni says, lots of opportunities everyday, no need to be greedy on a single one. Trade 2: A quick in and out continuation trade. It looked from the HTF charts that there was a lot of room after breaking yesterday's low, a lot of momentum, and no real rejection yet, so thought I could at least get a quick scalp out of it. Trade 3: Obvious huge rejection at the range (from Trade 1) prior to the break. Was going to hold back to the low, but big rejection at that minor low so exited there. Trade 4: Trend had obviously changed. Minor news caused the spike and then traded the first retracement. Price pulled back bounced off a level and pushed hard back up, I bought on the next bar after it pulled back a bit to the pins of those two little bars next to it. A lot of movement, but these days when trend flips makes it a little more challenging. As I much prefer trading with trend, I have to remind myself not to develop a bias (and see a trend that is no longer there) and to read the structure to tell me direction.

--- 帖子 #110 ---
i'd like to see more explanation from you if possible. I read your first post on this thread like 10 times but I still dont get it. Maybe because english is not my main language

--- 帖子 #111 ---
I'll keep posting and try to provide more detail about trade entries as I did today. Basically, trend is determined by lower highs and lower lows (LH and LL), or higher highs and higher lows (HH and HL). Opportunities for trades occur at these LH, LL, HH, HL. Focusing on an uptrend, there will be series of HH and HL. For trend trading, there are two options: (1) breakout above the HH or (2) failed breakout below the HL. It is better to trade with the trend. I prefer trading breakout pullbacks then straight breakouts. However, there are options countertrend trading, you have two options: (1) failed breakout of the HH and (2) breakout of the LL. For (1), this would be at a higher time frame (HTF) area of importance, and for (2) a breakout pullback is my preferred entry. EDIT: The little "m" before HH means "micro". Because in between the major swings you will have micro swings that help create entry points (i.e. the failed breakout against the trend, otherwise known as the two-leg pullback) Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Those counter trend failed breakouts and range zone failed breakouts are some of my favorite trades. They are really just liquidity grabs / stop hunts I stumbled across an If Then order entry EA recently that might be useful to you http://fxcodebase.com/code/viewtopic.php?f=38&amp;t=67329

--- 帖子 #115 ---
Exactly! That's why post 1 here by Veni resonated with me. Wait for the "stop hunts" and then trade. The only nuance I prefer because I think there's more room for error and potential larger payoff is with trend, which is where the counting highs and lows comes into play.

--- 帖子 #118 ---
But with the indicator you cover the most important thing .. The PA within the range! And who tells me better what is the range than me. Broken leg before BO. Counter in the range. And a very important point : "money is made in the middle, not from right at the top or bottom" by venividivici Even if you switch the colours to a more clean view. It limits the view to "above/below the range". That way I would avoid to watch the reaction on a level I mark for myself.. Finally it s much better to get an own impression of PA than any tool tells me. ✌Guido

--- 帖子 #119 ---
thanks very much. My main problem is that sometimes I consider mHH/mHL etc to be HH/HL. So I think trend changes but was my fail. Is it good to follow swings on M5 and trade on M1 based on M5 trend?

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Very true! I watch a 5M and/or 15M chart also (occasionally toggle up to a 30M or 1HR if it’s not clear). Others may do it differently, but generally I consider the 5M to provide the trend Im trading and the 1M is just to find the levels and the trigger for entry. You can do it all from the 1M, but to your point, you can sometimes get lost with only that view. This is why I used range bars for a long time (and still do to some extent) as it makes the chart look more like the line drawing I sent and easier to understand. Time is still an important consideration however so I wouldn’t advocate range bars only.

--- 帖子 #121 ---
From my experience, both these timeframes are useful. As usual, I use three main timeframes in one window: 5M, 15M and daily. As an alternative, it is possible to use combination of 1M, 5M and 1H - in depends on your strategy.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
Dang watching M1 and daily together is quite the gap. In my mind regardless of the entry time frame you’re watching you gotta be aware of the bigger daily levels. Even weekly zones, cuz thats where the longer term strong/weak fundamentals will come into play.

--- 帖子 #123 ---
Somewhat, but we’re talking about making 5 to 10 pip scalps here. There can also be too much information leading to paralysis... which goes back to what Veni said, something along the lines of “just take the trade”.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
Indeed. However we get paid to analyze information correctly. So it would make sense then that the more info you can appropriately analyze (what’s important, what’s not, and everything in between) the more profit potential there is. Is it it all worth it? Not for everyone. Just depends on what your goals are with trading

--- 帖子 #125 ---
You don't need any analysis, on the contrary the simpler the better. What you need to know is how this greedy game work. Edit: Think what you want ... and feel free not to believe me Have a good week

--- 帖子 #126 ---
Lol. So is your screen turned off while you trade? dont tell the banks, they’re wasting millions on analysts every year! Dont get me wrong I think I understand where you’re coming from. I just think it coulda been said better lol

--- 帖子 #127 ---
The issue with this system is that the rules of the textbook trades from page 1 are countered by resistance becoming support/becoming resistance and trends. I mentioned this last year and I knew this thread was not going to be successful because the system can not stand alone. You would need more than the rules on page 1 to trade this effectively. You would have to do other analysis to make sure it works other wise a strong trend and support turned resistance/resistance turned support will destroy your trade

1. I can 't see any issue .. works fine .. 2. No thanks.. I m good. ✌Guido

You need to understand how this game works. The rest it´s the usual ... discipline, do not be greedy, keep the losses short, etc ...

--- 帖子 #130 ---
1. You can see the issue clearly, but I will highlight them for you: OP decided to leave because few people are using the system. Few people are using this system because it generates losses in strong trends/strong s/r when you follow original rules(range can turn into a trend whenever) with out adding things to it as the you, others and the OP have done throughout the thread. 2. I do not doubt that you are a great trader, but I know the first page rules are not the only rules you follow because you have taken different types of trade setups in this very thread such as channel breakouts than you commented saying you "took some textbook trades". The fact that you had to specify you took some textbook trades shows that you have been taking trades that are NOT textbook and do not follow the exact rules. So stop lying to yourself and others to make a point. Keep getting more pips, and God Bless you and your family

--- 帖子 #131 ---
I am sure you are an excellent trader and I would never presume that you are a rookie trader. I would appreciate it if you would extend me that very same courtesy and do not presume that I am a rookie trader and not attempt to educate me on basic "babypips" trading fundamentals such as discipline, greed, and keeping losses short all of which I am fully aware, all of which I fully understand, all of which I implement. So please do not presume anything without context. My last year's results: Attached Image (click to enlarge) I keep my losses very short........... when I have them

Hmmmm seems you are a very good trader took a little scalp short here to catch it as it fell back within the last swing high. Classic first page trade, but context is everything

Thanks for sharing Man. Training live with lower lots until I get the hang of it. I exited this with +1.6 pips but I could have gotten more. How do you determine when to exit? I'm guessing experience plays a big part. Here is EU Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Forex trading is hard , its true but most hard is news trading , i have lost so much money only during news from my first step of trading. just nothing to say.

--- 帖子 #136 ---
this happens to rookie traders,i also lost my first account on draghi news,ever since then i dont trade news at all.trading news is not intelligent because we can not fight with banks. Trading manually is really difficult,when i was newbie or i learnt trading for few years,whenver i place order,it goes against me,because retail trades are being manipulated by brokers and MM.so its a hard game,but one can win with lots of hard work and intelligence.

--- 帖子 #137 ---
The easiest targets are 50 retracement a or previous swing highs/lows. I’m not sure about a long there, but the structure that formed last time price was down there looks a lot like an accumulation so had you gotten in on that one it’s clear to see price went back to prior big swing low

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Thanks, so targeting the 50% retracement should be a standard or a fixed 5pips tp. I was only picking trades with possible reversals and only focus on scalping a few pips. Need to work more on PA reading skills and practicing. Exited around this area Attached Image

--- 帖子 #139 ---
Yeah that would be a good target. I’d avoid the fixed pip target as you’re trying to force the market to fit your target and your either asking for too much or not enough in 99% of the trades. Focus on the PA and set your targets based on the market.

Yes, trading on Forex is very hard. Is better using automated systems. For $100-200, you can order write EA and do not waste time for manual trading. Earlier traded for 10-12 hours per day, and now I have time more time.

Interesting !!!he is using Wash and Rinse on 1 Mins chart !!!

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Just be careful what you get excited about, he might be a spectacular trader...I don't know, but it isn't that hard to do...what is not shown is the amount of DD on open trades. This graph shows over 90 trades without a loss, but I will tell you that the DD on open trades is sometimes large because I do not use a SL only small TP and you have to trade small lots and have a larger account.

--- 帖子 #152 ---
You guys are doing something wrong. You can t programm an EA for this system.. There is NO Drawdown , all trades find a TP around 5 to 10 pips-- and a SL around 2-4 pips. Quick in and out is the thing. Happy weekend. Guido

--- 帖子 #153 ---
Way to go Sesamstrasse, I meant no disrespect to you. I was just pointing out that 0 losses is not always the whole story. I aim for 3-5 pips TP on the 5 min chart during the asian session then let the trades close out during the day. I could use a 30-50 Sl and still make this profitable but not required so far. Chris

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Nobody said no losses, how do you think that? -I don t get you- Losses are part of the game. If you take a proper watch about Veni´s posted results, you can clearly see a quick in and out..

I SUGGEST YOU TO WATCH NO NONSENSEFOREX.COM VIDEOS,they explain us that bank goes against the client sentiments and we can check client sentiments on many websites,so be smart and do opposite of wat most of the traders do,because MM do the opposite. trading is very tricky and difficult,it is a game of fear and uncertainity and many traitors are playing against us.

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Highs and low's are not hunted it's simply the nature of the market. Price is attracted to the liquidity above/below the edges. It will always move to the pending's. I trade a very similar setup but it's most effective in futures where you can analyze orderflow/liquidity imbalances and actually see the trapped traders.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Sure its about the game. Actually was in Deutsche Bank few days ago because forex is ther field and when was siting in there they just pop up in monitor dax index nikke index and everything else. So just asked them so what do you think go long on dax or go short on dax and the answer was simply: we can't discuss about it, it's very strict and don't ask those question again it's forbidden. Well after this realise something.dam

--- 帖子 #163 ---
Out of curiosity I had a watch of the big banks vid and what a load of crap. He doesnt know how news flow is traded hence he said avoid it and his definition of banks hunting retail traders, is when I just switched off. I don't know how good he is as a trader or if this is just marketing, but I can assure you it banks do not function like that at all. They trade against each other is a more appropriate way to put it, our collective orders is just not large enough to cover their liquidity requirements. They need other large players to move markets sufficiently to make profit.

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Banks make money in fx in 4 ways 1) they execute orders for clients earning the spread (automated). They also execute orders manually for clients which is largely companies seeking the value of a currency on the day. This leads to the second way they earn. 2) daily fixes is often an opportunity for a bank to make money (I won't explain it here, go read about it). 3) wealth management for clients 4) proprietary trading I have worked with 2,3, and 4 in a professional capacity at major institutions. Let's take the number 4 in that list as an example. When banks trade they too need the market to move in order to realise a profit. It's harder for them due to their sizes so they are disadvantaged to you and I. As for orders, no single bank has all the orders in the market, they are all providing liquidity as a collective but orders are funnelled to different banks. The interbank market is just liquidity between banks either directly or through platforms like the one Reutera runs (the servers for it had cctv cameras on at all times. They make money hand over fist with that system and I recall heated debates about touching it. It was running on ancient tech which forced them to migrate asap). The proprietary guys have global chat rooms with teams globally. It is called follow the sun (or at least that was the phrase being flung around). They have teams of analysts that provide them with key data which they trade off. All trades go through a risk team that sends it to internal insurance divisions which match hedges where applicable. It's a tight run high pressure environment. They do lose, I have seen the data first hand and they had some rough trades. A lot of the proprietary trading includes all sorts of risk models which they run through on price testing systems to produce risk scores and profit\loss projections. Anyways I am getting slightly off topic here but believe I have provided enough to make the point.

--- 帖子 #168 ---
I got some questions please be kind to answer it: 1. What happen with the big orders when the bank close everyday? is the order still left there for days? or event for weeks or months? 2. How do they trade the news?

--- 帖子 #169 ---
1) it depends on the customer. Normally they want a daily price for a currency for business uses so those orders get executed at the fix. Banks don't really close during the working week, there is generally a follow the sun model and teams globally take over where others have left off. If they didn't have this then price could reach an order level and not get executed and they would lose the business. 2) algos and traders working different strategies. All the strategies take into account economic ans political news and they trade surprises where the market prices in new information. It's the only way to make money fundamentally in the short term.

Thanks for the answer..for example when the NFP news coMing..who trade it resulting the crazy up and down moves? Do the banks selling and Buying with each other and the bigger lots win?

--- 帖子 #175 ---
It depends, the fed have not been concerned about employment because its been good and the market knows this. They are however more concerned about wages which is why nfp on Friday was a mixed picture. You had the idiots buying the job numbers at face value but the banks selling them to bring price back to no real change in the day. If wages were up and job numbers then usd would have had a rally on Friday. You see its about context and in fx this is the central banks, what they are and aren't happy with. All economic data trading is the market pricing in expectations of central bank policy changes. If the job numbers on Friday were as bad as the wages then market concern over the coming recession would have driven sentiment on Friday and we would have seen more dollar selling. The banks do buy and sell with each other in the interbank market and in large size (tens to hundreds of millions) and they do that for client orders, proprietary trading, wealth managenent, MnA activity etc.

There is an important aspect im not sure I have mentioned yet, the aspect is the chart context. You dont want to be trading in the middle of nowhere, look at the minute chart as a whole and look at what its doing, but first wait for a move that has been made before going long or short. (this helps alot with consistency). What comes up must come down and what goes down must come back up. Attached Image Attached Image

" That "pattern" contains a lot of things I'm looking for well actually the entire chart. My idea is that a steep and straight movement (but without these news-type spikes) very often are followed by a significant correction or an entire reversal. That said, my system indeed has problems on long trends and as I said earlier, these are the days I have to adapt. My reasons: Straight movements are easy to jump on, you can't do much wrong. If the movement was straight the reversal pattern (can be an engulfing pattern or some morning star, hangman, hammer, whatever) is usually solid. I use a stoporder with a bit of a safety distance to get onto the move."

--- 帖子 #190 ---
It is not very hard if you master it. Just follow the trend and target your SL and TP. Control drawdown in below 20%. Practice it. One of my mythology is confident. Like playing basketball, before you shot the ball, u must have to confident. If not, you will lose the game.

--- 帖子 #191 ---
I think there is some good stuff in here regarding risk management discipline and trend-following, which has been shown to work over many asset classes and years, but I cannot agree that it is "not very hard". http://www.eurekahedge.com/Indices/I...dge_fund_Index Professional and highly resourced FX hedge-funds returned 0.8% YTD and -0.25% in 2018 - below inflation. If it were "not very hard" then you'd expect them to smash it. It is very competitive if, like professional funds, you try and produce risk-adjusted returns. Look at all the Myfxbook portfolios which make money but have a Sharpe ratio of 0.2! I agree you need some confidence in your convictions to place a trade - after all, each trade is saying "you're wrong, mr market" - but i think humility and the ability to question whether you are right is extremely important.

I do not understand why it's still not done, I can tell you cause not all people can allow themselfs to trade long time really.

I look here from time to time and what shared here is good IF you know to use it wise. Many start to trade with too much context, want being in longterm trends for scalping market short period. Some have no context and rush without respect nearly details in trades and wonder about results are negative. I trade also intraday with a balanced minimal context and found my way.

Good question! I can t trade everyday because I have a tough fulltimejob and in my job is every day a monday, 6 days a week. (the benefit is loooong holidays) BUT: If you watch naked m1 charts for a while, it comes to you when a chart could reverse or break out. M1 is very precise, a pin at the bottom and a reaction in the opposite direction may be enough to jump in. I just keep the SL s tight, quick in quick out, I just try to trade flexible. Guido

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Thanks yes I guess you're right. When I watch the charts live I can see price slow down and bounce slowly off alot of areas... It's easier to see live, I think some good hours of screentime of watching the price action live might be needed for it to feel fluent. Also, you start to see alot more bounces after a while, I'm talking about micro price action that normal traders might not even notice, like the tiniest wicks bouncing off the other like this Attached Image Alot of times pullbacks aren't clear enough and you have to use your microscope. It's difficult to explain but after a while you can 'feel' it.

The charts have two things happening, first is the structure in general, because the theory is "what goes up must come down", These are really just pullbacks in the bigger timeframes but look slightly bigger on the minute charts, but to our advantage we can try and identify them as they form, and then either, take the pullbacks to the top (or bottom) until they form a range and are ready to return the move down (or up) or just wait for the tops (or bottoms) and try and scalp them to catch the whole move down(or up). Samples below (I think you understand the idea) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) These moves (ofcourse) can come in bigger or smaller sizes. Attached Image Attached Image They can take the whole chart for the day or a small portion of the chart, but guess what, the principal is and will still look the same. Now, for the main tool you should be getting in and out of pullbacks that look like this Attached Image Attached Image These are small moves anywhere from 3-7 pips but this is the main tool to getting in and out. They should look clear and you can watch them form live to be sure when you are getting in that they don't suddenly break and change to a different direction. a stop is usually put at the top or bottom of these but not too tight, as sometimes a tiny fake spike could take you out. (I've spoken about these here on the thread before, they are a staple and essential) Some of them will look nasty like the image below, the solution is: be patient and watch the moment and watch it move, give it space to move in the direction you're expecting until it starts looking like the 'V' Use pins for clues of exhaustion and reversals with each individual candle!

How many chances in a day to make money? Attached Image (click to enlarge) Inserted Video

--- 帖子 #292 ---
How many chances? Plenty. But above all - and this is perhaps worth mentioning - is that if we are looking for short-term reversal patterns, i.e. range-heavy days, we will find them more often if there are uncertainties that can be resolved in both directions in a rewarding way but do not leave any room for secure cover. If many market participants have found a safe haven, we can hardly make money with it, because the search for reversal patterns in such a trend tends to produce too many false positives. If you can't beat them, join them or stay out. Political negotiations or squabbling, on the other hand, are always particularly great times for us. No matter whether it was Brexit or Trump against NAFTA/Canada. It is also interesting to note that we can find such range-heavy days more often after trend-heavy days or generally strong swings in one direction - that is then classic price-finding by market participants who do not agree with each other so they produce worthwhile bets, that means situations where you can spot good entry, profitable exit and nearby loss-cutting exit. All three ingredients for solid risk:reward bets.

The true market red pill: Price almost always returns to the same place, you just need to have the right safety in place for the times it doesn't.

--- 帖子 #298 ---
Nearby support/resistance levels are overlooked most times because trades look good, but they are a must before you take any trade. First spot your setup, and right after that look at any nearby levels that will interfere with it, this is more important and detrimental than you think!, simple example below. Attached Image (click to enlarge) A good looking short trade on the bearish channel Attached Image (click to enlarge) The result from ignoring the nearby level It will also work in your favour, for example the short could still have been taken and the trade closed out at the nearby level for a profit. Now you have a robust system that will work on most market days. - Play the range - Stick to what's happening on the current range, Is it trending or is it rangebound? and stick to what you see and dont go against that behaviour. - Watch out for nearby levels that may interrupt the move to your trade. (easier to see them as walls that you may not be able to breakthrough from lol) - Of course, always use a stop below or above your trades, but not too close, and dont hesitate to close your trade once it stops looking good to you. - Every other small detail written in this thread that I have forgotten in this post.

George Lane Still Trading Off Stochastics At Age 75 (streetdirectory.com) George Lane the inventor of the stochastic oscillator gave a short but insightful interview when he was still alive. Currently, in his "retirement" Lane trades "about four to 12 times per day." His time frame is "45 minutes to 1 1/4 hours," with average gains of "$150, $350, $750" per trade. "They all add up at the end of the day." "You can make $5,000 a day trading one-lots," Lane said. From his screen, Lane trades primarily off of three-minute, 15-minute and 30-minute charts, relying on "stochastics, volume and trendlines." Recently, Lane has been trading the S&amp;P 500 futures contract at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. He sticks to liquid markets, avoiding thinly traded contracts such as pork belly futures or lumber. Lane doesn't confine himself to U.S. markets, however, estimating that 20% of his trading extends to foreign futures markets. "German bonds and Italian bonds trade very actively," Lane noted. However, Lane said he never trades without a stop-loss order protecting his position. "That's the secret to making money in commodities-control the size of your losses." You can always learn something new from someone or situation in life, beginner or professional.

Is there a reason why USD/CAD is not on the list? I think the pair offers quite a lot of opportunities for our trading style. I also like the fact that both the US and the Canadians are still busy catching some more Zs during the European morning where we tend to trade, so the movements are more technical and not reactions to decisions of a political or monetary nature.

In post #292 I wrote a few lines about opportunities and short market cycles and when the market tends to be friendly to our strategy. The trading week is now as good as over. We have seen more long-running developments especially in the second half of the day, tending to often be followed by a trading day that offers many opportunities with the up and down action we love so much here. That is no guarantee, Monday can still be rather mixed of course, but from a purely statistical point of view, it now seems sensible to plan a little more working time on Monday. It could be worth it. Let's see whether I'm right.

How do you select which pair to trade?

--- 帖子 #341 ---
Here's my take on USDCAD this morning. Could have had a better entry a bit sooner. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #342 ---
I would like to give a few tips here, as I was recently contacted privately, but think this information is better kept public for everyone. General recommendation for all who want to trade like this: Depending on your monitor and field of vision, arrange 3-5 charts from top to bottom on the screen. Jumping back and forth between charts is nonsense, it doesn't work because you lose the feeling for the price action each time. My personal preference: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/CAD, AUD/USD. In addition, there are sometimes small information advantages if you have an overview of several pairs, which often develop rather synchronously. Depending on the situation, you can also switch pairs. During the Brexit referendum, I traded almost only GBP/USD. When Trump started his trade wars, however, I found the price action of USD/CAD very attractive. The individual chart does not have to be excessively high so that on normal monitors commonly used today there is room for 4 charts on top of each other. The terminal window of Metatrader can also be moved to the side. I recommend a chart width that covers about 4 hours. Personally, I use a normal 32-inch monitor, which also fits in my luggage. I used to have a smaller monitor in portrait mode and a second one for the terminal, news and so on but found the single bigger one to be more practical. Initially, many people find it difficult to focus on the bigger picture. The macro view, so to speak. For those, I would recommend concentrating on one pair at first and paying special attention to the zones where the price bounces off, not somehow, but recurrently and strongly. With time, a trained eye will develop that can quite quickly distinguish ranges from channels (stairs or diagonal ranges so to say). The latter, as much as they seem to resemble each other, have a completely different market-psychological profile: Ranges thrive on market participants who bet on reversal, channels on those who bet on maintaining the main direction. A range that slowly converges i.e. becomes narrower/develops lower highs and higher lows, will at some point break out explosively. Such a market waits for a trigger like news. The direction of the breakout is obviously not predictable.

trying to get my feet wet on the 1min, tried this, stopped for -3 have had a rough go with it, execution needs to be flawless...still experimenting with my entries, got my work cut out for me...but I have a few good ideas I'm following four pairs only...EU, GU, AU, and UJ, also trying the 5 min Most people on FF seem very negative toward trading the 1 min for some reason.... PS, thanks Veni for opening the thread to new guys PSS looks like us newbies are locked out again on a count of some snide remrks, anyway I will follow with interest as there are some nuggets here to be had.... PSSS Jens, my approach is looking at candles for now and getting a feel for PA....cheers

--- 帖子 #344 ---
I get that a lot, not only on FF. A professional trader I know personally once told me you need superhuman powers to trade the 1m, that was before I told him I'm trading the 1m. However, if you get past the period thingy, it becomes a lot easier. The patterns we trade here, are for the most part also visible on a 5m chart, or a 3m chart (which I traded off several years ago). The 1m is just superior for picking the entry and once you have developed an eye for the bigger picture, or call it the macro view like some do, you do not want to go back to anything higher because you look through individual candles anyway. Veni and I are not really studying candles, we absorb the price action behind the candles to pinpoint our entry within the pattern. The candle is just a compressed form of the past, that is high, low, open and close and a bit of information behind that, like rejected higher prices (wicks) or rejected lower prices (lower wicks) and so on.

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Hi Veni, thank you for allowing anyone to comment on your thread. Please, can you explain why you shorted there when it was directly on support level.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
Jens said it nicely, I'll try and explain briefly why I took it there, first of all I don't recommend taking those trades unless you've been doing it a while, the main reason I took and take some trades breaking back into support levels is because when you're watching the charts live its a completely different story to a still image, and I think that's a major problem people don't understand. When I took that trade the momentum was moving fast and gave me a 'feel' of what price wanted to do, so I took it, for me trading especially scalping is a game of adaptation. The minute chart is probably the only timeframe that will give you this luxury, you can get in fast and you can also get out fast, It can take you a split second 'to get the feeling' the trade is no longer working.. to me this feeling is acquired by live chart watching and hours spent watching chart behaviour/momentum and getting fluent with it, this took me a while to learn but only thanks to Jens I did. You will see some latest trades I've posted where price goes my way and then goes against me briefly but I don't get out why? Because I'm watching it live and I can see the counter move doesn't have any speed or strength to it. (But if I suddenly saw that changing I would be out). Actually we try and pick the most perfect static image trade examples but the reality is scalping trading is never perfect, there are no perfect trades, the candles and wicks exist but the bottom line is this: is the price moving one way or another? has it changed a different direction? watch the price live, watch how it speeds up and slows down and soon you will see that you will take many trades that would make no sense on a screenshot, but makes perfect sense in your live trading and works out well.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
Thank you, Sometimes i am wondering that this live movement is highly depended on broker feed tick update, internet connection, server location, etc. Movement or speed that i see from my screen may be different with yours, doesn't it?

--- 帖子 #348 ---
In my opinion it would only be miniscule differences, unless you have a major issues like still using dial up 56k internet lol, charts across different brokers mostly all look the same the thing to be aware that will mostly affect your scalping is spread, slippage or crappy platforms, that might have technical issues.

--- 帖子 #349 ---
you were lucky with your "feeling" this time, be careful it was not a support, was a resistance and was a stop hunt cheers

Only if your internet connection has a very unreliable latency, which is rare these days but could be the case with a wireless network and bad signal strength. Of course, it is a good thing to be as physically close to your broker as possible, especially if you're getting in and out of trades using market orders (i.e. clicking the buy or sell button), but a general high ping shouldn't change the visible movement, it would only delay it by a couple hundred milliseconds. I've traded from Thailand with my London and Swiss-based brokers without any noticeable difference to my home in Malta or my previous homes in London or Düsseldorf.

Hello, thank you mate for allowing everyone to post here. I'm practicing and trading 1m and 5m naked chart for a while now but sometimes i feel like i missing something, i don't know if it's just more confidence or a technical issue. I'm reading and studying this thread to learn more, people like you and JensG are a pearl in this ocean. May i ask you a couple of things? 1) Do you analyze higher timeframes to realize if you will be on the right side of the micro-trend? Or it's just a feeling due to the micro price action in that zone? 2) Sometimes you talk about slow and speed of price action during live charts. With this you mean the size of the candles or the high activities in a single candle (e.g. how many times a single candle goes up and down)? Also if it's possible, can you spend 1minute to write the reason of your trade when you post a chart please? Sometimes i can't really understand the reason of some of the charts you post. I personally i'm sticking to "break and retest" situation like in this chart but as i said, sometimes it turns and i don't realize i need to get out of the trade and i get a lose. I'm also learning to spot those "fail breakout" in my trades since they look great. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
1) Do you analyze higher timeframes to realize if you will be on the right side of the micro-trend? Or it's just a feeling due to the micro price action in that zone? No, to be honest I look out for channels/trends but im only looking to make a few pips per trade and not hold, so I'm not bothered about analysing trends on a chart too much, I'm more focused on the reversal of the current legs and nearby levels that could disrupt my trade. 2) Sometimes you talk about slow and speed of price action during live charts. With this you mean the size of the candles or the high activities in a single candle (e.g. how many times a single candle goes up and down)? Yes, watching the activity of a single candle live as it forms, the speed its moving, if the candle is moving fast enough in the direction I want it to go in. (momentum)

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Thank you for the reply mate. Please keep your charts coming, i just love them. This is the trade i just closed, it was a bit aggressive though. Maybe i should've wait a bit more before open.

--- 帖子 #367 ---

--- 帖子 #368 ---
@Jaymantos: Yes, that looks good. As an additional recommendation, I would add horizontal lines or a grid to make it easier to spot areas that are on a similar price level than the PA you're currently watching. @jojofx A higher timeframe doesn't really make sense for what we're doing. Understanding the bigger picture is important, sure. Veni and also I talked about it here before, but our bigger picture is usually visible within the last couple of hours because of the short holding time and not some overarching trend that lasted the last couple of days or even longer. I typically take several trades long and short each day in the pairs I'm trading. The overall direction of the last days, weeks or whatever has no bearing for me, neither does it has an effect on my odds, probability, hell it doesn't even affect my tail risk. We need to understand the current pattern, like is it range, channel or perhaps more of a mean reversion or a completely unpredictable news outbreak. I do, for example, always recommend *beginners* not to take bets against the direction of a channel but to trade with its flow.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
Hi Veni and Jens, Would you take the same trade? Where would you put your positive stop loss after price reversing? My earlier plan is to put SL to BE once it reverses, but as we can see, the price suddenly move against it, which will stop my trade at BE. On that trade, i close it early after seeing big long leg, which i think tend to be reversed. But i will miss more profit, if the price keep moving down Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Thank you for clarification JensG. It make perfect sense: in few words we need just to "understand" what is going on at the moment on the chart and take advantage of it with the very next trend/micro trend/leg. @ phoenix777 For quite some time i had the same issue: feel remorse for the missing continuation trend. But the essence of scalping is getting in and out to just grab few pips and don't care about the rest. If "missing money" is your issue, one thing that can help is raising the amount of volume/lot you trade such as even 5pips it will result in good money but you need to learn to be profitable first or you will just wipe your account. The best would be just don't care about money because they will come anyway if you learn properly. Even 10 pips a day can make you rich Another thing you can do is close half of position and then keep the other half to see if the trend continues, from what i saw a lot of times price comes back to our entry point before continuing, maybe because there is where a lot of liquidity is standing. I'm sure venividivici and JensG can give you more valuable tips. Cheers.

That's how you do it.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
I did take this trade this morning. It was on EUR/USD, wasn't it? I put my entry a little bit higher than you to make sure the previous low was safely broken. This was a buy-trade in a downward channel within a downtrend after all. Be that as it may, momentum was on our side and this channel showed good legs in both directions but, because of these circumstances, I decided to not move my SL into positive territory but instead to exit manually. I typically don't bet on channels to be broken, so there is no point in trying and milk it, furthermore, the counter legs of channels typically show plenty of indecisiveness because channels, opposed to ranges, live of market participants seeking an entry in the overall direction. One man's reversal is the other one's opportunity to get in late.

--- 帖子 #373 ---
I got a bit confused reading this then I realized Jens thought you took a buy trade, I think Jens spotted the wrong thing on the chart, correct me if im wrong so I outlined his trade more clearly. He took the short from the leg with the trend. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Attached Image (click to enlarge) A leg up was formed and I started to look for opportunities to get in on a reversal, getting in too close to that previous daily high didnt make sense, I would be risking a continuation of a bullish trend, so I waited for price to get back downwards within the earlier range below the days high, with a little bearish momentum whilst looking at the nearest levels (disturbances) to keep me alerted to where I would possibly have to close my trade.

Hi venividivici, very impressive charts, i need one bit of clarification, do you draw lines on the higher time frames and then trade the one minute using momentum etc or do you make the one minute chart really small to see what price has done in the last week/months. thank you for your time. chris

I asked a similar question at #post364. You can read the answers there mate.

--- 帖子 #391 ---
Hey, very epic thread Veni! So... I had a couple questions and Jens agreed to answer them here because he thought it was of public interest. So I am reposting a question I previously sent him (wall of text ahead) : As I understand it, tail risk is closely associated with lack of liquidity in the market (from big players / market makers removing their limits?). I'm not 100% sure, but it seems micro-levels and follow through are a bit more erratic when those "big guys" aren't there or perhaps I'm making stuff up with the big guys, perhaps it's just the "natural" outcome of everybody anticipating the same stuff... Anyway... I have read a couple posts from you where you talked about economic calendar and its use - i.e. in order to know when not to trade or take a day off. I'm guessing it is up to every trader to gauge their "risk profile" and to come up with a couple rules regarding when to trade and not to trade. I figured I would ask you what is your approach with this, as I'm trying to learn how to scalp currencies (following advices I'm reading in your older posts and in Veni's thread). With this I mean, how much time prior to an event you stop trading, how much time after the event; Do you pay attention to every events, like low anticipated impact? Also, there are a couple calendars out there with different anticipated impacts for certain events and/or more detailed calendars, I'm trying to follow a couple to be sure I don't miss anything. Is it too much? I would bet that ideally it is best to have a decent period of time during a regular trading session (Tokyo, London, NY, although NY seems a bit crappy for currencies), where there are not much economic events to mess with the liquidity, (and hopefully no crazy news as the current market levels will likely collapse). Ideally just low anticipated impact stuff. Like this week, there are many high anticipated impacts, with a typical big economic event (FOMC tomorrow). Is it just crazy to trade tomorrow? What about this morning with the U.S. PPI? So, if I'm not completely off-tracks with all of this, should I check the calendar and decide in advance which day / period of the day I will trade based on how market reacted to those in the past? Ah, another tail risk related quesiton I would have is concerning the stop. As I understand it, I "should" exit manually based on price behavior around levels, not have a precise stop at the extreme? Or am I mistaken? I'm kind of in a phase where everything seems a bit blurry, I know it is possible to "make it" so to speak, but it's a question of fine tuning I think and whether or not I'm able to "fine tune" the right details ( be it psychological, money management, trading the right opportunity windows, and of course the approach...) Thanks a lot.

I use an emergency stop of 10 pips which automatically comes on everytime a trade is opened, mainly for sudden swings, or unexpected sudden news nothing else, I keep an eye for red news and dont trade slightly before and slightly after, that simple..thats about it...I don't care about fundamentals in general only price.

I wanted to reiterate the important message by Jens on post #342 again, about the advantages and importance of watching the charts together, Although the chart windows are quite small for this explanation, I took a live example on how analysing and watching the charts together will get you further ahead in the game and give you better results than just looking at one chart.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
So basically, not trade against opposing pairs (e.g.: usdcad sets up a short looking chart at the same time as audusd = suspicious ), and trade the ones that offer best outlook / "runnable" distance (amongst same sided pairs)?

--- 帖子 #399 ---
When I speak of tail risk, I am referring in general to the risk of uncontrolled losses from individual trades. Unfortunately, the consequences of this are often underestimated. To reiterate the often said, should-be-obvious but often neglected: Keep always in mind that success in trading follows mathematics. I am only successful if, over the sum of all trades, I make more money than I lose. With high win rates you can boast or lead pointless threads here in the forum about the reliability of trading strategies (like someone recently did), but you won't reach your goal if you ignore the risk/reward ratio. If I have a win rate of 50%, I logically have to win more than two dollars for every dollar I risk. If I lose significantly more than that in a single trade, i.e. more than I can easily recover with my longer-term performance, I have a problem. Once you have internalised this, it is clear that individual losses that are significantly larger than the stop loss, which of course must reflect this healthy relationship to the profit, become a danger. We, therefore, want to protect ourselves from such liquidity bottlenecks in which we cannot expect the stop loss to be executed with the usual precision. So, yes, at the bottom line it is a liquidity squeeze we want to avoid. For me, talk about the big guys is always a bit too unspecific and nebulous. Market liquidity is primarily created by market makers/LPs, i.e. those market participants who trade in both directions in order to profit from the spread. If they sell a million to X, then the profit arises from the purchase of a million from Y without the price going up or down. The difference between the bid and ask is their profit. Their risk is holding these securities, in our case currencies, through price fluctuations. Normal daily fluctuations are not really a problem. The price will come back. When it comes to fundamental repricing, on the other hand, some people are scared shitless. When the Swiss central bank unpegged the franc from the euro in January 2015, known here in the forum as the Alpari bankruptcy and the rescue of another broker by an investment bank, at least one major LP virtually pulled the plug. I was having a few beers with the sysadmin of this bank in London on the evening of the same day. Anyway, in terms of liquidity, these micro-levels are nothing other than support and resistance areas, i.e. narrow price corridors where many market participants have placed their orders. Because of the sudden demand on one side of the currency pair, the price then suddenly moves faster once these are triggered. The fewer market participants are actively trading, the fewer orders will logically be placed in the market and liquidity dries up because of the LP's risk of holding through price fluctuations for the lack of buyers or sellers increases. Yes, of course. There can't be universal rules because every strategy has a different Achilles' heel. Short-term trading with the aim of profiting from small everyday market movements is a bit of a double-edged sword. On the one hand, short market exposure reduces the risk of getting hit the hardest. We have no weekend exposure, for example, and even a pandemic tends to offer us more opportunities than risk. On the other hand, however, even small surprises are enough to cause substantial damage. Suddenly having to close a trade with 5 times your average winning trade leaves a crater in the account and this becomes much more likely if your average profit is relatively small. Someone's opportunity can be another one's risk, that all depends on the strategy, associated holding time and stuff. Large news releases should usually be avoided, such as NFP, central bank decisions and things like that, but in the end, this is only a small part. Much more problematic are political tensions, such as elections, where there can be sudden forecast reports, preliminary counts, etc. Speeches can also cause very nasty market reactions because a sentence can mean something entirely different when it ended than when it started. However, the topic is somewhat diffuse and I find it difficult to derive clear rules that I can share in a forum post. So perhaps I should explain my basic thinking with an example (or 2 or 3): In 2014, the market largely ignored the Scottish independence referendum. This neglect creates a risk, and I don't mean the final result, but also in advance, for example through surprising preliminary polls. During the Brexit referendum, volatility was high, but liquidity proved to be absolutely sufficient. Nevertheless, it was wise to wait for exactly that clarity and to approach this market slowly. The period afterwards was riskier for people who held their positions through the late evening and night. In general, it was observed that the pound was set in motion very quickly and hard by political news. This obviously did not require any advance notice and an entry in a calendar, the news and rumours just came in. In the night hours (from a European perspective) there were indeed one or two flash-crash-like events. Now one can say that it is the fault of those who trade at night, but in my opinion, that is too short-sighted, because it was clear that there was massive uncertainty beyond the usual bounds in all directions. Let's take up the mother of shit-fit-the-fan-situations: The decision of the Swiss central bank in January 2015. True, you could neither know what was coming nor when it would come. This however ignores the fact, that it was well known that the central bank was unhappy with the attacks on their exchange rate defence line and that the SNB's bloated balance sheet was increasingly becoming a hot political issue, which was only exacerbated by the expectation that the ECB would announce to introduce QE soon. For longer-term oriented traders, all these events also offered opportunities. This is logical: if the market ignores something that could happen, the risk/reward ratio widens very much. It's like an opening pair of scissors. For shorter-term traders, but especially for traders who ignore the risk and take the other side, it becomes dangerous. Does this mean that one has to keep all fundamental events in mind and puzzle them together? No. But you should consider whether there is a sword of Damocles hanging over the currency pair you are currently trading. At the latest when the bets on a falling Franc took on epidemic proportions when the threshold was exceeded, common sense would have helped: There is no such thing as free money and central banks managing the exchange rate tends to end in tears. Why all these explanations now? Do I like to write too much? Perhaps. The jury is still out on that. Be that as it may, my main point is that tail risk cannot be neatly separated from opportunity and, most importantly, is much more complex than news on a calendar. If you want to derive simple rules, I would say the following: Don't trade, say from 30 minutes until the occurrence of an important news event like the NFP, CPI, interest rate decisions and things like that. Currency pairs that are relatively liquid while the two players are still asleep are of course quite interesting. Also: CPI and stuff becomes much more important and thus potentially damaging once there is rumour or demand of a rate hike or tapering. Stick to the big currency pairs, they are not only more liquid because they are more actively traded, the structures in the countries are also more established, which makes very big surprises or radical changes a bit less likely. Even Trump has been more reliable than Erdogan. Keep an eye out for surprise risks stemming from the political climate of the country. If in doubt, stay out, stick to pairs you understand and/or trade smaller positions. The final protection for highly leveraged short-term traders is, of course, to keep the account with the broker relatively small, i.e. to have profits paid out often. In most cases, I move my stop loss, which is initially set at -10 pip, into the profitable range. When and where has a lot to do with screentime, i.e. experience, but the microlevels often mentioned here also play a role. The decision for -10 as a starting level has two reasons: It is still a loss that can be compensated for quite quickly, but at the same time it is unlikely to be triggered by accident. My stop loss is set automatically, an adjustment to tighter, volatility-adjusted prices often takes place manually immediately afterwards, so it is not the case that I make a bet on -10 or +x up to a certain profit, but that the automatically set -10 should rather be understood as a precautionary measure. Well, I hope that helps and like I said, the problem always feels a bit diffuse to me and is one of the harder ones to explain.

Regarding screens/charts: Veni's way of archiving that market overview is interesting. Personally, I prefer windows stacked from top to bottom so I have all current action on the same vertical axis. Well, whatever you prefer, let's look at the main benefit of being able to watch it all together instead of zapping charts like the impertinence they call free-tv ;-) I see mainly two reasons: We're trading short-term with fast decision making but usually by taking the bigger picture into account. Switching charts is logically counterproductive in such a situation as it becomes hard to keep the focus of the bigger picture AND the current price action. I can concentrate on multiple charts simultaneously only if I can watch them at the same time, furthermore, and that's my next point I can draw clues from the common behaviour of currency pairs, especially since one side is almost always the ubiquitous USD. You only have to look at the charts: When the EUR rises against the USD, the other major currencies like the pound, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar or the yen almost always do the same. If you look a little further, however, you will see that they do not always do it exactly in sync. Especially in critical reversal situations, i.e. those where the probability is not necessarily on our side, such as against a trend or channel, you can often observe that in one of the pairs the previous direction (the main direction) regains the upper hand earlier than in the others. Sometimes these few seconds are enough to decide against the bet or to remove the placed stop-entry order before it has been triggered. In other cases, you at least get out before the damage has become greater. Now, if you have just made a bet, which pair are you most likely to look at? The other ones or the one you're currently exposed to? Yeah, I thought so. On another matter, I am increasingly receiving questions by private message. I am happy to answer questions, but please ask them here in the thread. By the way, Veni and I trade largely according to the same formula, so questions about whether I use higher timeframes to get an overview are unnecessary - they have already been answered here. All I need to know is, almost always, available within the last 1 to 2 hours and I can easily fit more than 4 hours on an ordinary screen. For people hunting some, let's say precise 10-20 pip bets, there's nothing of interest in the last couple of days simply because charts have no forecasting powers.

Just spent time on this intriguing thread, would like to ask what of the world Fx trading time widows are the best?, or at least the worst? I am in the oceanic window. our SX opens at about 0830 AEST. USFx opens about 11 PM, GBFx about 7PM. Any suggestions I can try out?, I do not have a problem with overnight hours anyway. I see that our AEST hours from 08 to 10 are very low ATR slope usually. KenS

This thread is the gold standard for scalping. Thank you so much. Eye opening to say the least. The most simple things are automatically ignored by traders (including me). Many bad bets can be avoided just by knowing which currency is dominating it seems.

Neither the worst nor the best timezone. You can consider yourself relatively lucky. Personally, I like the European morning the best on most days, on other days, nice action is moving further into NY open. As a rule of thumb: If the whole day was trend-heavy, the next day, especially the European morning though will usually provide ample range-based opportunities. If the morning is trend-heavy, I'd check back around NY open or even 2 hours before that. I live in Malta most time of the year, so I'm one hour later than the UK/Portugal or the same as Germany, France, Spain and so on and usually start my day around 8 am (used to be earlier, but that's what I'm doing for a while now). I wish you all a Merry Christmas, too. Inserted Video

Hey Veni; Jens, I wanted to ask... are there situations where you'll look at a chart and really can't make sense of what's going on and find it's better to just not trade that pair right now? (Probably... why the hell am I asking that) I'm asking that because there are days I'm doing well following channels and/or ranges while other days it seems all blurry and I end up not really knowing what's going on but have the thought in the back of my head that something is going on nonetheless and I end up taking bets I should'nt take. On those days I end up losing a lot and it pisses me off and I end up making even more dumb shit. Does it make sense what I'm asking? Have you been through that or is it just me who has no self-control? Deep inside I know I need to make this as emotionless as possible, in the sense that it just needs to become routine and boring (the exact opposite of why 99% of people start trading in the first place). I often come back to post #268 of your thread and post #66 of mine to gauge myself with the trend and how it should look. I'm not sure whether those are simply examples or any chart can technically be traded even when it appears to just be one big mess; i.e.: I just need to find the underlying trend which is probably (but not necessarily) a bigger range/channel and approach it differently/adapt. I think I know I should just focus on clear ranges/channels on the m1 and forget what I have trouble making sense of... So I'm kind of answering my question... My "problem" really is of psychological nature. I know it's the core of the issue, damn it! It's like a self-fulfilling prophecy from hell. Do you just walk away when nothing seems to be playing out; do you come back later? Do you keep staring at your charts for let's say 3 hours and stop trading or trade for 10 hours; do you put alerts, etc.? It actually just feel like I'm addicted and unable to see what's right in front of me and walk the fuck away... When I said everything in trading seems diffuse (although it was probably not exactly the right choice of word (sorry Jens)) that's kind of what I meant: getting denied every step of the way be it by having the wrong big picture idea and/or failing to recognize the micro levels once the trade is engaged, etc. but not really being able to make sense of it and finally have something that works, but not knowing what place it really has in the probabilistic scheme of things (was it just luck this time? What was different? Should I "analyse" my winners or just my losers?). When I check my trades in hindsight, it all make sense to me, I see the trends and so on. But live it is a totally different ball game, as you are 110% aware. I don't know exactly where I'm going with this, it probably reflects the inner conflict that is going on inside of me at the moment and where I lay on the road to resolve it. But also to be honest about it. Sorry to litter the thread with a long scattered post lol.

--- 帖子 #414 ---
Ofcourse not every day is a good trading day, sometimes its bad in the london session and good in the new york session and other times its the other way around. Not long ago Jens was telling me he had not seen a decent trading day in a few days, trade what looks good to you and dont force it...if you get in a trade and it starts to look choppy and rubbish just close the trade.

--- 帖子 #415 ---
This is exactly why I always say that strategy is only a small part of success. A strategy only works as long as the market and the strategy are compatible with each other, you could also say as long as they are in sync. You can recognise an experienced trader by (at least) two related qualifications: He recognises early on when this is no longer the case. Not necessarily before the first loss, but definitely, before the losses have reached a critical level. He does not start sabotaging himself. Especially days that offer little in terms of our strategy, perhaps even strategies if one is running two different ones, are days when self-discipline is most important. What you can nail to the back of your head, in any case, is the following realisation: good days come again. No dull period lasts forever. The currency market is extremely mean-reverting, you can rely on that even in these times, so you don't have to worry about the continuity of your source of income. What remains is the question of how to survive the boredom in front of the screen? Years ago I asked a question about this here in the forum, but unfortunately, nothing came of it except pointless answers. So here's my answer: If there's nothing on, you can look at it again in a few hours, but during the work itself you can find help from very shallow entertainment. For me, that's sailing videos on YouTube. I rarely spend more than 3 hours in front of the screen. Only the months before the Brexit referendum were so extreme that I used the catering service of a neighbouring kitchen to not have to leave the computer.

--- 帖子 #416 ---
Hi Jaymantos, I'm facing the same problems.When there is an understanding that something is wrong, a "reboot" is needed. It helps me: a break of 10-20 minutes. Just observing the price, without making decisions. Try to change the angle of view (usually simplify the picture) It is necessary to evoke a "positively calm" state of consciousness (it should be interesting to trade and monitor the price). When I started studying forex, I laughed at the chapters about psychology in books, was wrong. I hope it helped a little, even though it's banal. English is not native, sorry if it is not clear.

--- 帖子 #417 ---
"I used the catering service of a neighbouring kitchen to not have to leave the computer" About light entertainment: I used to watch a channel from a Canadian guy who built a log cabin in the woods. (In case you don't like clicking url on the net, channel name is My self reliance, the guy's name is Shawn James). https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIM...XXCeq2UJePJEog I always feel guilty watching other stuff on the side when not much is going on; like I'm not being focussed 100% and probably missing stuff... I guess it was not a bad idea after all! lol

--- 帖子 #418 ---
No, it certainly wasn't a bad idea as long as you still notice what's happening on the screen. I think we're all way too obsessed with concentrated work but in trading, at least for the sort of trading we're doing here, what do we really need to concentrate on? I mean, what we do transitions quite quickly into, let's call it intuition, and none of us determines whether the markets will deliver many or few opportunities today and neither do we know in advance in how many hours this action gets squeezed into. I at least had never managed to hack Trump's Twitter account to send markets into turmoil right between lunchtime and a west end musical ;-) For that reason alone, I would consider anything that makes us more comfortable holding out for another hour to be helpful, regardless of whether it's going to cost a few percentage points of concentration or not. To be fair, this may not be the best solution for absolute beginners, but I guess for them, the markets alone could still be interesting enough. Oh, and of course, podcasts work well, too. Preferably stuff that's easy to follow, for me that's economics, foreign policy and the like.

--- 帖子 #419 ---
When you said sailing videos I thought you meant boat stuff lol. I realize just now it might be an expression to say you were watching them one after the other? Anyway... There was a time I watched professionals at their craft with not too much talking in the videos. For example, a kind of contractor guy doing 1001 things like buying and repairing heavy machinery then using it, etc., a mechanic, a farmer growing very neat vegetables with bio-intensive methods, another farmer butchering and showing how to cut a cow from A to Z, a black-smithing guy who forged ancient weapons (lol)... Also the guy with his log cabin (I must say it evolved quite a bit since the beginning). Oh and forgot this cook guy who shown me how to cook a very neat chicken breast lol. I would be curious to know what podcasts on economics/foreign policy you listen to? I sometimes watch videos from a guy named Kraut and another Jake Tran, who have somewhat well explained takes on different foreign relation/economic situations. I enjoy podcasts on neuroscience, performance, etc. I typically listen to one-on-ones with scientists, athletes, as I have posted a couple in my thread before...

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Hey DaniKash, I just saw your comment for some reason... Don't worry about your english it was clear and thanks for sharing your thought. I recently got back to reading Mark Douglas' Trading in the zone. I have experienced this state of mind where I know I can trade and I just trust myself and the process, doing very simple stuff in regards to analysis; I trust that the market will eventually straighten itself out. When I'm not careful, I let myself slip again, I make mistakes, and I forget why it was working in the first place so I fall back into the old patterns of trying to "understand" the market through better analysis (the 4 fears he talks about). I guess it's all a big process and we need to always remind ourselves of that and come back as soon as we catch ourselves falling prey to those, until we fully integrate it on a emotional level as necessary for success. This carefree state is really important in accepting whatever is going on and moving on, and seeing the probabilities for what they are.

No no, I meant boat stuff. I've become interested in boat life since I moved to Malta and am watching Sailing Uma and SV Delos. We're going to subscribe to a sailing school soon. I'm hoping for satellite internet to become good enough to be able to trade off of a boat in a couple of years and if not, I plan to retire in 6 years anyway. Well, retiring here means to stop daily trading and focus more on my stocks portfolio and perhaps other stuff. Among the English ones its the BBC World Business Report, BBC global news podcast and the economist podcast. The Financial Times also has a few interesting ones. Ultimately, there's a lot of interesting stuff available either for free or paid, I also like the Quartz Obsession podcast which picks rather random topics like Japanese whiskey, rare earth or office chairs. Virology has also become very interesting but turned out to be too demanding while trading.

The following post contains an extremely long wall of text with some newb questions. Proceed to read it at the risk of depleting your attention span to nearly zero and having to mindlessly scroll youtube, quora, reddit or all of the above at once or worse, refreshing your email inbox 25 times per minute for the next 4 hours all the while knowing nothing of importance will pop up. Q1: Is there a way you can recommend from experience that would help the process of finding what works and what doesn't? For example Mark Douglas advocates for collecting samples of 20-25 trades before assessing them. Is this how you proceeded to find what works for you? Q2: I am not asking this in a bitter way: I am wondering if you are keeping part of your strategy/approach details privately? I would assume you shared the core of it and someone willing to learn may or may not connect the dots himself? Is that correct? Like stuff you don't want to disclose publicly about how you trade (wich I would be the first to totally understand). For example, making some kind of analysis to make a mental picture of what's likely to occur today. (Or I am (likely) complicating things too much again?) I mean, if you did extensively give out everything you do in your trading, it says something else to me than if you shared the core of it, learning-wise. It means the problem right now I can be 100% sure it's of psychological nature, impulse control and the likes, self sabotage etc. and I need to zero-in on that (which I'm already approx. 98,45343% convinced is the "problem" already). This question seems weird but I'm really not trying to pick a fight lol. It's just how my brain works to try to fill blanks and tries to know if there's an actual blank... Q3: I have seen you write a couple of times about the take profit, as in the typical limit order to close an already opened position. If I recall correctly, you said it did not make sense and you were manually trailing the stop instead. I have experimented with it also, and right now for me it seems to be draining my "emotional capital" enough that I end up completely blind to what's happening and end up most often than not with a b/e or a loser (even after going into profit, which is mind boggling). I know I need to read the micro-action but for now it seems I do better not trying to do it too much after the trade is live . What seems to work for me right now is to have a target in mind where I will move my stop immediately 1 tick below market once reached and then trail whatever additional tick(s) I can gather this way IF price really blows/spikes through it, it can be worth it especially if the target is reactive(obviously I am doing that with the help of an algo). Another alternative I find less interesting (for now) is to not trail every tick but let it blow through with stop 1 tick below target price and then target next zone in mind. It is less interesting to me because more often than not price will retrace again after a spike like this and whatever additional distance price had made prior to the spike is lost. Q4: Would it be a good way to learn this by simply forgetting about micro-management for now, and simply collect samples of trades that I let run either to a stop that makes sense or a target that also make sense? (After each sample try to find where are the probabilities and come up with some better management rules/guidelines). Kind of building from the bottom-up and I guess my question is what is the bottom here from which I can start building this probabilistic mind-set. (Although, I think I am starting to understand what micro-levels are supposed to look like on currencies, perhaps in the beginning I was seeing too many and it was just messing with my head a lot.) I am probably over-complicating all this again. I just need to dust-off every corner of my brain for it to let go and really trust the process of creating a probabilistic mind-set. To be honest I am probably already aware somewhere in my mind of the answers to most of these questions. Sorry for the very unstructured post, it's a reflection of my brain right now lol. It's probably pointing to the fact that I have difficulty simply letting go and getting in the habit to flow with the market without imposing my view and what I would like to happen in my decision making process. (And that's what I need to work on.) (“A probabilistic mind-set pertaining to trading consists of five fundamental truths. 1. Anything can happen. 2. You don’t need to know what is going to happen next in order to make money. 3. There is a random distribution between wins and losses for any given set of variables that define an edge. 4. An edge is nothing more than an indication of a higher probability of one thing happening over another. 5. Every moment in the market is unique.”)

Shoot, you almost got me! I confess, I only share what seems to work so far that people stay on the ball, but still mostly lose to generate liquidity for me. Veni recognised this early on, we've been sharing profits since then. But let's leave the seriousness aside and focus on the fun: I don't keep important details to myself, or let's say not on purpose, but my way of trading did not originate on the drawing board, but in my head. I started by trading classic reversal patterns and learning from mistakes and losses. When I explained to Veni and a few others what I was doing, it was also only partly altruism. It helped myself to put what I do into a more or less stringent set of rules or rather guidelines. A recurring experience for me was, of course, that I had to explain in detail things that seemed self-evident to me because they were in fact only self-evident to me. Just imagine you are teaching a computer how to eat. Routine 1: Open your mouth. Wait, how does that even work? Well, let's start with the jaw. Just as a pointed analogy. The human, however, rather rarely does nothing when he doesn't know how. Instead, he interpolates what is missing with his way of doing things. Sometimes this works and sometimes it doesn't. That's why Veni or others don't trade exactly as I do, just according to the same pattern. A practical example of these missing links is the manual tracing of a running bet with the trailed stop-loss or my opinion on take-profit, so I'm re-explaining this in the hope of forgetting fewer things this time. The basic question is first of all, how do I get the most out of a bet? The fixed take-profit basically means that I want to get out at this price, even if the price had gone further in my direction. The manual trailing stop-loss, on the other hand, is a different approach, which could be paraphrased as follows: I don't know if this is really the best exit option, I'll keep all options open instead, and take a small bet on a missed take profit vs. further price gains. You might say it's the agnostic approach, but there's no need to get that philosophical. Both have their advantages and disadvantages. With the fixed take-profit I miss out on further price gains, with the manual stop-loss in positive territory I again give away some of my profit if the price actually turns at or minimally after the take-profit level. I like the latter option better also because the take-profit actually only makes sense with quite perfect ranges, which seem to me to be somewhat rare. However, there are hardly any limits to creativity. You can also combine them. Have you ever considered using a take-profit just to reduce your position? Yes, I'm only here to make peoples brains explode. I think a missing point was that I leave quite a lot of room for small setbacks in the price. Only when the price reaches the area where I would also have positioned a take-profit do I pay very close attention to what I see and tighten the noose. However, this can also be multiple areas. However, in the beginning, I spoke of a more or less stringent set of rules or rather guidelines and so I would like my contributions here to be understood more as food for thought or "that's how I do it" and not as a set of rules that you have to follow if you don't want to be doomed. All the details, such as volatility, that you have to take into account in manual tracing, I can't share simply because of technical possibilities, because I can't capture movements in static images. But you can come up with results that work for you in a few hours of screen time. Maybe they are the same as mine, maybe similar ones that work nonetheless. If this were a virus, we would now be talking about random replication errors and a variant that might work less well, or maybe even better ;-) Finally, please also remember that the question of trailing stop loss vs. take profit is also no longer a discussion about the (essential) exit strategy but about fine-tuning it. The first step must always be to find good bets and determine where approximately you should cap them and I believe this has been covered here in this thread reasonably well by examples and also some explanations, even though there is probably still some room for improvement to be made on the latter part. Obviously, if you tend to overthink things, it is easy to get lost and if you try to copy everything I do, you will overlord yourself. Like I said above, it wasn't created on the drawing board but in my head while trading or after analysing problems so I naturally grew into it.

Hello tylers, I think the mistake people make is they focus on one setup only as some sort of system, like phoenix said its all about momentum and price turning, the patterns and zones are just clues that make it easier to pick and choose... Think about most things in life, the weather goes from hot to cold year in year out until the day you die...if you could draw it on paper it would be a never ending wavey up and down chart. When you drink it comes out and you urinate, when you eat the same thing, a beginning and an end and it repeats itself again. You start young and end up old and another child is born. Ice cream starts off cold and frozen and ends up melting.. Well its same principle with this, price goes up and it goes down...and its never ending like that..the only difference is sometimes the up or down moves are shorter or longer...price is moving (momentum) and turning continuously, try and catch the momentum and get some pips out of it, or get out if it stops going your direction.

i dare not say we shouldn't trade right now, because i think it's very personal how each of us see the market. But for me, it's dangerous, i only targeting small pips, any sudden news or unexpected moment can cause slippage that will make any SL not triggered have you read Jaymantos's thread https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...ing-the-market ?

How deep does price action go? Taking leg trades and spotting them is easy, but the next step is to observe candle by candle disturbances within each reversal you are targeting, most of the time I'm looking for candles within the legs which may have wicks that could stop the continuation of my reversal so either I will take the profit at those wicks or I will get in after that candle is surpassed. Below is just a simple example of legs that should have reversed and highlighted where and likely why they didnt. Micro-levels matter, all the time.. most people dont pay attention to these and that's one of the reasons they keep running around in circles. Pay attention to the little details.

Hello everyone! First post here! I'm a fairly new trader and it has helped me a lot to study the Elliott Wave and the ABCD pattern (Take notes). Also getting familiarized with Fibonacci and what each timeframe is good within your style of trading (I use 15M to verify general temporary trend, 5M to view buyer and seller zones and 1M to refine my entries). Also, be mindful of NEWS (Specially RED/ORANGE). I would say I am day trader for now. My goal is to become a Swing trader. Here was my trade for today hope it helps! PS. I am not an expert or very experienced like most of these guys so take whatever you see here with a grain of salt lol Happy Trading!

I'm trying to explain the 'holy grail' to the strategy in a few words now, the thing that cant be explained properly or the feeling to why price moves, in reality all you need is one candle to move away as quick as possible from your entry direction. If you sit and observe the charts in real time you will spot slow and small candles hardly moving, we can discard those for entries..the point is, the momentum we talk about here is about getting in on snappy fast moving candles in your direction. Even if you discard everything said in this thread and make this a basis to your scalping you will have good success. Remember, all it takes is one candle: moving faster than the others in the direction you want, you will be in instant profit most of the time, the rest is up to you - trade management, observe the speed after that candle is it slowing down or is the momentum still in your direction? its up to you to decide to cut the trade or hang on, alot of the time there will be a counter candle after your 'fast momentum candle' but you will see that it has no strength to make a counter move against you. Observe.

Basic price action is useful and wicks are reliable sign, but the main basis is to observe momentum 'moving away' or 'turning' from areas/candles, you can get a feel by observing price live, which candles/areas price is moving away from.

--- 帖子 #489 ---
In your example I don't understand entry 1, I see two strong bullish candlesticks

--- 帖子 #490 ---
I'm no expert, and I don't pretend to be. Maybe the order was a limit sell and Veni was confident that level was liquidity? If you just focus at the bull candles then you're not looking left to see where those candles were going to. Do yourself a favor, drop a horizontal line on the chart, and train your eyes left and see if there is anything you can pick up on that would change your entry from up to down and down to up.

--- 帖子 #491 ---
It's possible you might be missing some context Veni had when the trade was taken. I think pa18 is right in that price was probably approaching a key area. Part of the so called general structure Veni posted about here: https://www.forexfactory.com/thread/...2#post12769582 So after understanding that post, the two main things that stick out to me: 1) It looks like price approached one of those areas that is a key level on a higher timeframe. I'll post a screenshot below to make it clearer. 2) The momentum of price as it turned away from that point after the two bullish bars. Number 2 is probably most important and I think this is why Veni says screen time is so vital. This is all just a guess though and Veni can chime in with what really happened if he'd like.

I have a lot to learn...in the examples that you expose in both I would have had losses. In the veni graph I see that the impulses are the same as the setbacks or I would be out or I would surely have entered late. And in the Fenix graph I would have stayed with the previous range looking for a buy and in the fall it would hit me... there is much to learn

--- 帖子 #499 ---
Be aware that a lot of knowing how to trade has to do with knowing when not to trade. Not just meaning with the news and all that (although important), but when your setups are weak today (meaning probabilities are not there), they are just not favoring any outcome over the other. This is when most people are tempted to bend the "rules" (their guidelines to highlight probabilities), and take less than ideal trades, thus losing money (and their mind ). A lot of hassle could be avoided by understanding that: 1. It's just a "game" of probabilities 2. The method doesn't even matter, as long as you always use the same. It doesn't need to be be able to predict stuff, be always right and "understand" every tick of the market since 1970 on all timeframes. The method serves as a lense to highlight probabilities for your brain. It must be simple, and always looking for the same general ideas. Believe the pros who say you could make money with any method (after watching market through it for a long enough time). Over time, your brain starts picking up on probabilities after doing wrong things over and over again through that method. You start realizing "Ok, I should probably exit now ("based on the 90 previous times I held from there and market just retraced to my stop")". Therefore the biggest mistake people can make is to jump from one "system" to another constantly. It will obliterate any chance they have to start trading profitably one day.

The kid was absolutely CLUELESS as to what he was doing, didn't even know what his indis / template was, and was brainlessly clicking a button to get filled whenever he had enough margin. Typical retail degenerate gambling behavior, so yeah, you can flip a small account into a big one, but with an even smaller initial investment of a few dollars, you can turn it into MILLIONS!!

Just to be clear, I wasn't saying being profitable or putting some winning trades isn't possible, not sure why you're taking it personally. Those are good trades, congrats. The choice of this video is very poor for anything regarding good practices in trading. Do people really need that example to realise that when you click blindlessly a buy or sell button and get extremely lucky in an impulsive move up or down, yes you can win big? That's the same as me opening a full margin trade on GJ (it seems to go up this morning, I don't know) and if I double my account I can go "see, anything is possible". On his trade, his sizing was so disproportionately weighted that any kind of pullback would have destroyed his floating profit. And he had absolutely no idea of trade management, no exit plan. But hey, let's not focus those non existant money management techniques, the guy clicked buttons repeatedly and won big!

Hi venividivici ! Is your method similar to this schematic? thanks

--- 帖子 #490 ---
Hi everyone, Veni and whoever thinks that can help, I'm struggling with my exits, is more they are killing me. My entries are fine actually they are very good but my exits are killing me. Sometimes I go for small profits and leave a lot on the table so next trade let's leave room to run but turns and no profit basically I do not know when to let them run or take profit all this leads to frustration which makes me overtrade and become inpatient. Im asking in this thread because I use the same strategy for entries also on the 1 min chart. For example with veni exits I see that you post many times 3-5 trades of around 7 pips and then boom 100 pips!!!!! So how you differentiate between ok let's go for 7 pips to go to a massive move. I have considered to exit mechanically with a big range candle, on my studies many times is the perfect exit but other times is not and that is what is frustrating not having a clear criteria like with the entries Please help!!!!!! Thanks guys Kind regards

When you get consistent enough catching the small reversal patterns then you can try and hold one pattern into something bigger.

--- 帖子 #492 ---
yes its one of the tools.

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Personally, I use a trailing stop that I manually drag into the profit zone. The exact mechanics of optimal spacing are also hard to explain, but hopefully, it's good as a nudge in the right direction, that means if you're not already doing it anyway. If I find time, I might write something about the mechanics behind the distance decisions, but it has a lot to do with price action and the microlevels that Veni had already mentioned here using the entry strategy. In a nutshell, I leave more room when I do not really expect the price to change direction here and tighten it a bit when the price gets closer to levels of previous uncertainty/reversal zones. For me, that's a bit of an agnostic view on market behaviour and as long we're not seriously edging on liquidity limitations probably a lot better than trying to forecast the end of a "leg" using fixed take profits.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
would love to see your write-up on that mate. is 'leaving more room' arbitrary? Or, does it line up with previous microlevels? Say 2-3 levels away because the nearest one is too tight (just an example pulled out my a**).. the question I guess I am asking is how much precision is involved in your trading here and how much is it just looking at the chart and saying to yourself, "well I'll just put the stop loss here because it gives the current price some breathing room"?

However, if you want to know more (well maybe you saw my thread) let me know in PM. I'm no longer explaining it publicly. SF

As i see you watch some of other pairs too. Are you concerned about correlations to the pairs? If i see a chance in the GBPUSD, then maybe another good chance, to the other direction in the NZDUSD? What is your opinion?

Hello everyone. I have read in silence and it is still not clear to me how this extremely discretionary trading methodology works. If anyone would like to explain it, it would be very welcome. Meanwhile, I wish you all good pips.

What do you mean and could you please illustrate it with some charts?

--- 帖子 #533 ---
I do not understand the meaning of this post. show your gain by saying nothing. does such a post make sense? either you explain how you get them or it doesn't even make sense to read it

--- 帖子 #534 ---
I recommend you watch the pairs together, not a single chart..the issue is momentum..if price is moving in a faster pace in one direction its easy to get in and make money, the biggest problem most scalpers have is when price is moving slower, which happens alot during the day, its slow and choppy and moving sideways..and price looks like its going to reverse and they sit there with an open trade and it doesnt, so when you have all the pairs open together you can spot faster momentum on one pair when others arent moving, giving you better trades.

i just wanted to show that scalping on the 1 minute chart is possible if you know how price moves based on liquidity and volatility. It would take me too much time to go through this and explain it but there are some good videos from Chris Lori on YouTube that might help you

Trading is only difficult if traders lack sufficient expertise of fundamental and technical analysis and jump into trading with no sufficient knowledge, only with practice and consistent positive approach help to understand market better.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
your words are nice, but what is your " consistent positive approach"?

--- 帖子 #542 ---
My consistent positive approach is to analyse our prior trades so that we may improve our weak areas rather than getting caught up in the trade's results.

Hey! Jens wanted this to be public for everyone to benefit from it. Here’s an hour or so of chart action that’ll serve as a basis for explaining how his thought process evolves in the heat of the moment. He’ll explain in more details when he gets the time. Inserted Video

--- 帖子 #548 ---
Thanks Jaymantos!

--- 帖子 #549 ---
can't wait

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Here we go ... Jaymantos already said it, this is about the thought processes or the reasoning behind my decisions to make bets. Of course, a YouTube video is easy, and some might say that hindsight is always 20/20. However, that is not what this is about. I'm not selling anything. So it's not about advertising the strategy Veni presented here in the thread, nor is it about promoting myself, but simply about using moving pictures to explain what I actually observe when I look at a chart because Jaymentos and I are of the opinion that it might be more helpful to others than static pictures, which you often find here in the forum. Let's just start with the bottom pair: USD/JPY. A brief summary of the situation could be as follows: The pair has broken down from a narrow range (far left on the chart at the beginning of the video) between 130,300 and around 130,450 and has now been in a slow upward movement, with minor setbacks, towards the lower edge of this old range (130,300) for some time. This upward movement is similar to a channel albeit a bit dirtier without the textbook-like symmetry. The upward movement exists because every time there was a setback, buyers came back in and took the selling pressure out of the market. If one had started earlier, this would be a great example of a nice long bet where we could very easily buy a setback somewhere in the middle without much risk and ride it to wherever it goes. However, since we are too close to the old range, which has now potentially become a resistance, this would be a bad time. We can play the whole thing as follows: If the price breaks this old range above (above 130,450), that would potentially be an opportunity to jump in late on the buy side. Personally, I don't like to do that without doing further analysis. My motto is either early or not at all. Unless I know of market circumstances that make long-lasting movements likely. But neither this chart nor the others, which also include the USD and where USD strength is already underway, look like that. So let's concentrate on that possible bounce to the downside. I like to talk about a kind of point-based decision-making. So here are the ingredients again in a nutshell: Clear, steep leg towards a resistance? No. Not at all steep and clear. But: It is not just any resistance in the middle, but one of the quite important main marks if you look at this chart. Scrolling further to the left would probably have provided more clarity. Furthermore, an incipient dollar weakness in the pair would correlate with what we already see in the other pairs. Basically, it looks like this: The individual parts for the probability look good, but are not fully convincing. The win-to-loss ratio, on the other hand, looks very healthy. For me, this is enough to prepare a possible short bet. At about minute 3:10, stagnation sets in that correlate very well with the old range; the old support of the starting range at the beginning becomes our new resistance. Here we should slowly consider placing a short bet. The implementation varies somewhat between traders. I would like to discuss this separately later so as not to make the analysis part of this text unnecessarily complex with interwoven implementation methods. Now in the next 20 minutes or so we see that this bet worked out well. But what if it hadn't? Then we would have paid with a loss for the information that the upward pressure of the USD, at least against the yen, is currently very strong and should factor that into the decision of subsequent bets. We would have lost money, but it is up to us to decide whether we also lose our heads over it or take the information gained. Around minute 26:30 this downward movement ends. Should we now make a long bet here? I'm not sure I would have taken it. The argument in favour would be that quite strong movements usually trigger a subsequent movement that is at least long enough to go out with a small profit. The fact that the short bet was not entirely steep and clear would have argued against it, i.e. partial setbacks were used by market participants to jump on the downward movement later and the likelihood of this happening again isn't too low. We could scroll further to the left to find more clarity on whether we have a decent supporting level here or not. In principle, I like such ping-pong situations, but I can't give a proper judgement based on what I see here. When I enter such a ping-pong scenario, it can also be that I merely exchange short for long positions until the price visibly runs out of steam and the trend tends sideways, as you can also see in the later course. When something like this occurs in the morning of the day (i.e. Europe session), more movement usually comes back into the market later in the day, mostly in the Europe/US overlap or around the close of the European session. Execution Now let's return to the short bet for a moment. We can see here very nicely that every now and then a slight stagnation occurs and shortly afterwards the price gains some new momentum to the downside. Such slight stagnation phases can be used very well to increase the size of the position. To do this, we simply place another short position just below the stagnation zone (sell stop order), so we basically consider this small stagnation as a micro-level, so to speak, as Veni already presented it here in the thread. Size-wise, we stay well below the initial bet so that we only have to risk our unrealised gains. Pseudo-mathematically speaking, we thus improve the risk-reward ratio again in the course of the bet. Now, the key part of the execution: Placing the bet As I mentioned elsewhere in the thread, I usually use stop orders to place the bet. I do this primarily for two reasons: Accurate positioning so more or less distance from the resistance to stay within the example of the initial short bet or to wait out micro-levels, such as we could have done when extending the short bet. In addition, this variation also allows me to watch the price action while making adjustments if necessary, without the stressful situation of manually executing with my finger eagerly waiting on the buy or sell button. Accurate positioning can be a little tricky and the initial short bet is a pretty decent example of this. As mentioned at the outset, the initial upward leg was fuelled by late-emerging buyers who took advantage of any small setback to jump on. A similar situation can of course be expected when placing a short bet just below the mentioned resistance. But there is no perfect option here: We can get in early and perhaps see the bet blow up when new buyers come in again. We can enter later but then pay for an increased probability with a poorer risk/reward ratio. A perfect solution does not exist for such bets, unlike reversal patterns following steep and clear legs. Personally, however, I would lean towards early entry given the currency strength factors mentioned and the presumed quality of the resistance. Let's come to the end of the excursion through my thoughts on placing a bet. I'll be away from steadily connected civilisation for around one week from Monday, but after that, if there is interest, we can do it again with clips of days with different market behaviour if Jaymantos or someone else offers to upload them (in a similar layout please). If anyone has questions about other time markers in the video, I'll be happy to look at them again separately when I return. On a side note: I haven't forgotten my text about stop-loss management. It's still in my pipeline.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
Thank you Jens and Jay It takes time for me to respond this post because there are so much information presented First impression is i was wrong about how you might trade, i thought you only pick nearest resistance or as you said as just any resistance in the middle. Then you will see how price moving toward that resistance, if it was clear leg, then just wait for any sign or reversal to short it. I've been doing it sometime and shows quite good result Any reason why you pick that level as resistance? The moment you short USDJPY, and price moving downward. Did you consider what happened on EU and GU? where the price was also moving downward, showing conflicting movement. Thank you for your insight and please answer whenever you have time.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
Hello everyone, I like this idea of the 1 minute trade. With that said, I would not make a habit of staying long in the trades because of the MM stop hunts. Maybe 8-10 pips if you can and get out. The safest trades that work for me are any trades that don’t involve the USD trades. In the USD trades you have to watch the US Dollar and you have watch the pair that you’re trading. I no longer trade the US pairs. And my loses have dropped 56% in one month. Everyone have a great weekend.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Perhaps I should have formulated/explained that better. The price level that I call resistance here was used 2 times as a support, on the third test as support it did not hold and the price broke through and dropped. On the 4th test, it was a clear resistance. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Now to repeat the most important piece of information: I am looking for bets with a good risk-to-reward ratio with good enough probability. That is exactly what I found there. The probability was not perfect but good enough to justify the very limited risk. You have to realise one thing for the trading day, either by observation or by one or two small losses at the beginning of each day, which were then just money paid for information: Do periods of weakness in the price, attract late buyers or sellers who confirm the previous direction or does a price reversal set in here? In the former case, we see the above patterns, i.e. small trend-like movements or channel-like patterns. In the latter case, we see clear legs, sometimes steep, sometimes less steep, but they tend to start and end predictably at around the same prices (think of horizontal lines). This is how I tell trading days apart (in a nutshell). In both cases, the outer support and resistance areas are those with the highest probability and the strongest counter-movement. In the former case, however, you need that certainty and strength to make repeatable profits while they're just nice to catch in the second case. This is exactly why the market behaviour shown in the video is harder to trade: You have to pay attention to more details to cut out the noise and need more discipline when waiting and that's why I always recommend beginners to limit themselves to clear and steep rangebased days first - well, those were rare last week. Later you can add days like the one in the video or trade nice channels. Step by step. One could also say that I trade not one, but two strategies, perhaps even three, and select the one that is suitable for the situation on the basis of observation by assigning the market behaviour to two or three broad schemes that experience has shown to remain in place for several hours. Did that help? Did this approach of explaining it better illuminate the differences between the days and why I would have chosen to trade from this level? I did notice the signal conflicts shortly after the reversal started. Now, this was not a live bet, just an analysis of a video that Jaymantos picked for me. We discussed the idea beforehand, not the market situation. How I would have reacted live to that detail is hard to say, but I would have seen no reason to cut the bet prematurely because the entry point was chosen at a resistance that I judged to be sufficiently well-tested and not it did not exist in the other pairs at least not at around the same time. A proven way to mitigate the risk of a quick and strong return to the original direction is to tighten the stop-loss.

Thank you for your clear explanation. Regarding risk reward ratio, how you determine the potential reward. Attached Image (click to enlarge) Do you think below is the proper level identification? I think in this case, it is the clear leg kind of trade Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #555 ---
So, I'm not back home yet, but at least I'm back on solid ground here in Florida. The level that you have drawn in your second chart is the area that I was sort of looking at as a likely minimum target because the price hovered around that quite often. It didn't always bounce there, but as you can see on your whole chart from left to right, it showed slight stagnation phases there again and again. If such zones are close, it is my experience that the price will at least reach them again. You are absolutely right, that would have been an excellent bet but I limited my analysis to the beginning of the video. I only used the visible "history", as in a real working day, to identify interesting levels. Perhaps I should have communicated that as well ... Regardless, from a purely technical point of view, the reversal of the leg you marked with the arrow fulfils 3 very interesting criteria: Reversal on a seemingly well-tested resistance Reversal on a relatively clear and steep leg compared to the rest of the chart The whole thing is also in the direction (short) of an overarching slow trend (which later seemed to have ended with that reversal). A look further to the left in the history would probably have shown a well-tested support zone there. No rocket science really.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
Thank you for the answer. Your explanation is very straight to the point. It makes perfect sense. So far i have no more question, i will try to put it in practice And i hope you will still post more nugget here. Thanks

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Sir. Jensg these are some precious pieces of informations that either beginner and experienced can benefit from. Thanks for taking the time to share it. Personally i find the exit much more difficult than entry point. My psychology acts a bit weird when i have to decide if it's time or not to exit a trade.

--- 帖子 #558 ---
Interesting. Can you elaborate on that? Do you tend to exit too early or too late? Getting out too early is a typical symptom of feeling uncomfortable with money on the line while being too late is often easier fixable by baking a more straightjacket-like exit approach into the strategy.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Jens, Jay thanks for all the effort into such an informative post!! This video format of showing how you trade is very helpful and i can assure you there's definite interest. @Jaymantos i'm happy to try to help upload videos so we can keep this discussion going! one thing I am curious about Jens. you mentioned the level around 130.20 was what you were eyeing as a minimum target. What would have kept you in the trade when there was some indecisive action there? There was some reversal-like price action with a tiny "micro level" break. additionally this level was a well tested previous resistance turned support correct? couldn't we apply the same logic you had for the short trade to this level? was there something else that would keep you from exiting or even considering a long there (ping-pong action)? there is kind of what looks to be a range around 130.05-130.20. wouldn't buying in the middle also be risky around that area? And when youre "riding it to wherever it goes", are we basically letting price make higher-highs/higher-lows and when price makes a lower-high than before that would be your exit point? hope the questions make sense. thank you again for sharing!

that's why I am trying to trade the news and it's been more or somewhat easier to understand for me

--- 帖子 #561 ---
I've read a quote some time ago that stated something like: "The brain is an amazing machine that works perfectly all life and it stops working when you open a trade". I think this quote resemble a bit what i meant: after i open a trade i seem to lose the lucidity and it can happen either that i close the trade too soon or i keep it open when i shouldn't (this happens mostly when i try to recover a previous losing trade). And this is valid for both TP and SL. Though i don't feel too bad when i close it early (it's still profit), what it makes me a bit angry is when i reduce the stop loss to reduce an eventual loss and i get stopped out just before the markets move in my favor (i know it happens to every one but i still can't get over it). I often try to think about what makes me feel like this and i guess it's because of the past experiences that accumulated and developed my behaviour because i never had a guide/mentor and i had to learn by my previous mistakes. I still need to learn how to control emotions properly (which probably is the hardest part of trading). Don't get me wrong, i'm doing not bad overall and kinda successful but i'd really like to not struggle so much all the time during trading.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
I generally do not use take profits. The whole idea of tying the end of a trade to certain price ranges is almost always foreign to me. I just tighten my stop loss. First from the fixed -10 pip, then into a range that avoids having to go out with a loss, and later I look for the sweet spot between setback risk and reward maximisation. But we'll get to that. Specific to this bet: I generally give a little more room to a short bet that started from a good (i.e. external resistance) and, on top of that, takes place in a market environment that tends not to be steep and clear, but rather is repeatedly interspersed with slight disruptions. Additionally, I always wait for the initial price action. So even if I talk about an early entry, that doesn't mean that I jump right in at the resistance or out at the support or even reverse positions there (ping-pong), but always slightly below or above this price range. The price action basically gains meaning (or not) for me through its location and the previous price behaviour (legs). I have cut out this fictitious bet here as a graphic so that others can follow it better. Besides, I'm losing the overview myself ;-) Attached Image (click to enlarge) You're right, the area between .050 and .200 is not without problems, and you can see very clearly how the trend is slowly weakening. However, when I spoke of "buying in the middle", I didn't necessarily mean it literally, especially since initially you can't know where the price will go and consequently where the middle will be. When I talk about "buying in the middle", I only mean that you don't always have to catch the outbreak of a pattern (or anything very close to it) and such channel-like patterns are a prime example of that. If there is no outer "major" resistance in the way, you can usually jump on (in an upward channel) without any problems shortly after the second low or so, i.e. when the initial price action seems to confirm the previous main direction. This is another case that you can catch quite easily with buy-stop orders, by the way. I hope we can discuss the handling of such channels in greater depth at some point. In general, however, I don't have a rigid exit procedure, but I try to learn a little. My positive stop loss prevents too big setbacks and I have no problems riding such a wave series even by jumping on and off several times. Depending on whether I get the impression that the respective "waves" are big enough for this or the pattern moves upwards with rather moderate volatility. However, and that's where we come back to the first bet, I rarely bet on a general reversal of a channel, i.e. on a breakout against an imaginary line that roughly connects the highs or lows. This requires a price range that I consider to be, how shall I put it, authoritative. Some channels can also be played on both sides and thus I can indirectly profit from a reversal through stop-loss management without actually relying on it to happen to prevent a loss. I hope that shines a light on the thoughts that are forming in my head: It's not about making some huge bet, not about the trade of a lifetime. It is much more an assessment of possible exit options, the search for the net and double bottom, a what-if game, so to speak, that first starts with risk minimisation and later, with a bit of luck, turns into milking a random coincidence all based on lots of hours of screen time.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Sir. JensG i'd like to ask you what do you do in these 2 cases: 1) After your stop order gets triggered, if the price doesn't seem to move anytime soon and it ranges tight in that zone for like 30m-60m, do you look to exit from the trade around BE or do you wait until price goes one way or another? (tp or sl) 2) As soon as your stop order gets triggered the price starts to go in the other way, you wait for it until it reaches your SL or you try to exit the trade earlier before it reaches your fixed 10pip SL? I ask this because sometimes price goes deeper than entry point before turning and go in our direction. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #564 ---
amazing - thank you Jens for the detailed response! My key takeaways were: 1) on why you didn't get out or reverse positions at your minimum target (~130.20) when there was indecisive action you use stop loss orders for both entry and exit. Sort of a manual trailing stop loss method you've devised to use in your own way. you would give a trade like this one more room because it was a key resistance level and the previous leg wasn't clear. I think you've mentioned you try to make as much of your trading decisions based on the previous leg as possible so this makes sense. the reason why you wouldn't reverse positions at that minimum target is because the price didn't move enough in the direction that you would consider it a real direction change i'm not really sure what you mean by "wait for the initial price action", "price range", or "price gaining meaning through location and previous price behaviour" but i suspect it has to do with those micro-levels and how you decide where to place your entry. 2) on "buying in the middle" and riding the trend/deformed channel up you didn't mean buying in the middle literally, but more so that you don't have to catch the exact beginning of a channel. You can jump on after the 2nd or whatever low after the price action is confirming a turn and there are lack of levels in the way. you can go in an out multiple times in these channel like movements. You can even take both sides of the channel if the legs are long enough and price action supports it. you don't really bet on channels to reverse and your positive stop loss is setup deliberately to prevent price from turning too much against you. Incidentally this stop loss also gives room so that if a channel does reverse, you're able to ride the move. this was very helpful, thank you! It sounds like you have plans for where to take this conversation next after the initial post so I will eagerly await what is to come.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
i completely understand this. I think practice will be key here. The more you get used to the movements and how to react the easier it becomes. dealt with this too and again, practice and learning from what went wrong is going to be really important. for me going from static charts to watching price action live I expected the bars to be more straightforward, but there can even be so much up and down action in a single long up or down bar. if you notice you're getting kicked out too early and then price goes your way, you've identified your problem. Now the question is what will help? For me, it was initially giving my trades more breathing room. I would immediately tighten my stop as soon as price starting moving a couple pips in my favour. But at some point I had to accept that I'm getting kicked out on good trades and im ok with a larger loss to give price the chance to go towards my target. I've also noticed that if price takes you out too early but then starts turning again, you can just re-enter. It seems to work really well once you get used to it. definitely think trading psychology is underrated and not talked about enough. I've found studying this with books like Trading in the Zone is generally helpful to keep us aware of our thoughts and feelings and how we can shape better trading habits. Of course, experience is also extremely important too.

--- 帖子 #566 ---
In principle, I don't have a problem with waiting and I am familiar with the situation that the price doesn't really get going and stagnates. However, 30 to 60 minutes is definitely a long period of time and a few things come to mind: Does it make sense to watch the trade for that long? Are there more worthwhile charts that I now have less time to focus on? Is my side at least slightly dominant? Is the release of economic or political news imminent? I'd rather not be caught up in one. After all, we are usually dealing with relatively small individual profits here, which makes tail risk in the simplified sense of unusually large losses a critical weak point. I just remembered a losing bet from 2014, when Putin annexed Crimea and the market could be stirred up by fragments of speeches alone. We have a very similar situation today and have had it before and in between. Be it Brexit, be it Trump, be it the so-called Euro crisis or just any stupid election. My -10 pip SL is an emergency stoploss. I have never waited for this to get triggered. The stoploss at -10 is set automatically because for me it is a loss that I can recover relatively easily, and at the same time this distance is far enough to avoid being triggered accidentally. The purpose of this stoploss, therefore, is not of a trading nature, but more like a safety net against technical problems such as internet or power failures, a fire alarm in the building (happened) or diarrhoea (to name a still outstanding reason to lose a bet ;-) ). All correct. Excellent summary! The context in which this happens is often important. Brett Steenbarger had very helpful texts on his website, which I, unfortunately, can no longer find. If you often close trades too early with a small profit, the question is whether you were just looking for the good feeling of booking another profit or whether the constant risk is driving you crazy. My personal advice would be to cover up any information about money on the display. The important information is not in the profit column when it swings between profit and loss within a fraction of a second but on the chart, in the price action within the pattern you're betting on. Wanting to sit out a trade after a loss until a profit is made sounds like the classic revenge pattern. It is obvious that the combination leads to the maximum unpleasant result of large losses and small profits.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
Good morning folks. Apologize for late reply but i was out city last week and didn't bring my laptop with me. Yes i think this is the exact analysis. There are some days that i just look to make a small profit, just to end the day "positive" but sometimes, for example, all the small profit made in like 3-4 days, are too small to cover a losing day. Though the losing days are becoming less the more time i spend on charts (like TheProtege said: pactice and experience is the key). I admit in the past that "revenge pattern" is what made me get in a losing streak: after a losing day, the next days wanted to recover at all cost but this just led to more losses. I guess taking 1-2 day off after this happens would be the best. May i ask if you have a screenshot of a situation where you realized you were in a bad position and got out manually of the trade to cut your losses? For some reason, for me, it's hard to choice to close the position before it reaches SL because a lot of times it happened that it went in my direction right after closing it, without giving me the chance to get back in and it drove me mad You are right TheProtege, i think giving more breath room to a trade would be a nice solution and probably less stressful. I got this habit to put really tight SL (just 1-2 pip before previous high/low) and sometimes it's counterproductive. I'll try to "fix" my habit and learn to give the trade more space! Cheers.

--- 帖子 #568 ---
I'll make you a screenshot with an explanation at the next good opportunity. But I would like to take the opportunity in advance to explain the mechanics, because that way I can explain the basics without constantly pointing out the specifics of this one situation worth explaining that may now arise tomorrow or the day after. I pull the plug when the bet no longer makes sense. Just to take an example that has happened on a regular basis and also works in line with the thread's strategy. Let's say we have different resistances with some distance between them. Now I see that the price action is hinting at a reversal at the lower resistance and I make a short bet. After a short while and a bit of fighting between bears and bulls, the price breaks through to the upside and I am now -7 pip in the loss where the price will soon meet a new potential resistance. It simply no longer makes sense to hold on to this bet here, because even if the price now turns further above at one of the upcoming resistances, two fundamental problems arise for me: I can short again at a better price further up and have much more profit potential in the best case. But the lower resistance could now have become support in a less fortunate case, so even if the price turns again in the short term, I need additional luck to go out with a profit. You realise: it simply makes no logical sense to hold on to this bet. Especially not when you consider that broken minor resistances usually indicate that the movement has quite a lot of steam at the moment. The goal must always be that the sum of many individual bets must be positive. If you hold on to this one bet at this point, you are only frantically trying to avoid booking a loss but risking a bigger loss in return and giving up a possible better bet. Your current losing bet gets in the way of a better one! If this happens often, something is wrong with your entry positioning. Instead of thinking about the exit strategy just yet, maybe wait for a little more confirmation from the price action and go in a tad later.

I kinda like this losing bet (on GBP/USD today). Well, granted, I do not *really* like it, but it is a good example that meets my criteria for a losing position that is worth explaining and shows my thinking and decision-making process. Attached Image (click to enlarge) The dotted lines explain that it was a bet on a forming bearish channel. The white line was approximately my entry and the red approximately my stoploss. Now you can also see here what I mean by a bet and what I mean when it no longer makes sense. For me, a bet is first of all a specific pattern, and this one simply did not materialise. My exit was quick because it became obvious on the basis of three criteria that it would no longer make sense to hold on to the position. If we look at the legs purely geometrically, it was obvious at the stoploss position that the formation of a downward channel had become very unlikely. To see this, I really don't have to wait for it to grow into a 10-pip loss. Instead, the middle, around which the price had been hovering for quite a while before, became a support zone (which also wasn't unlikely from the get-go). If we look at the price action of the blue bull candles that broke my bet, we also see that this support zone seems to be quite stable, because the dominance of the bulls is obvious. As a take-away, the following may be useful: If you think in patterns, the question of whether a bet is worth holding on to becomes, in most cases, a downright simple, quickly discernible and logical decision. With increasing experience, i.e. screen time, you can always pay a little more attention to your "gut feeling". For beginners, on the other hand, the systematic approach is likely to be more purposeful. For people who fall into psychological traps, the corset of a strategy is also a useful template for action.

Yes, this is the real truth (at least in my case). Deep inside, when i refuse to close a losing position, it's because i want to avoid a loss and, as i said in my previous post, my mind is not lucid to realize that it's much better to close a small loss that can be easily recovered later rather than keep it open and get a bigger loss. I'll write this statement of yours down and read it every day! It doesn't happen that often but still happens more than i would like. It's just that i'd like to have full control over my decisions rather than let my previous experiences dictate my actions withouth thinking Anyway i already started to follow this your advice from the time i've read you use stop orders instead of market orders. As soon as i've read it i started to try using stop orders too and i have to say that i find my entries much more fit because few times prevented me a loss and other times avoided that situation in which price instantly goes against you as soon as you open the trade, before turning back in your favour (and it causes me unnecessary stress).

One thing that i started to do not much time ago is that i keep another platform open with the same market i'm trading at moment so i can watch the chart clean (withouth orders,sl,tp lines), i noticed it helps me have a more clear view of what is going on and if i'm in a wrong trade, now though, i have to learn and force my self to click that close order button when i'm wrong. After all, when i analyze the past week/month journal it's clear that i'm doing much better when i keep my loss small (even if they are more frequents) because this allows me, at least psychologically, to not get too mad and recover from it easily. Your analysis of this losing trade makes perfectly sense, esepcially when you talk about the fact that we always have to consider if there is dominance of the bulls or bears, and thus we don't have to wait the full SL to be triggered to realize that we are in a losing trade. Also i like the fact how you always try to consider only clean markets, with clear support resistances and clean movements, not too messy or choppy. Bytheway i checked the chart and the market turned bearish right after the next leg in your screenshots. Hope you was able to get back in Yes, i guess keep sticking to my strategy's rules and keep making experience with it, is what will make me improve more and especially develop those "gut feeling". Because after hour and hours spend watching charts, subconsciously, we know what is most likely to happen. The fact is either if we choose to "listen" to it or deviate from it and make our emotions dictate the decisions. Sir. JensG i can't thank you enough for all the insight and knowledge you are sharing and the time you spend to explain in details every circumstance. I really appreciate it!

That's an interesting suggestion. I had a related discussion with a friend the other day about how distracting small details in the UI of a software can be. You don't have to close the losing trade manually. If you drag and drop your stoploss, e.g. from my recommendation of the initial -10 pip to -6 or so, you can directly check this level against the critical areas of the pattern you are betting on, based on the line drawn by your trading platform. It's really simple that way to see whether the trade still makes sense. Basically analogous to the entry, where you use the line to check against support &amp; resistances or microlevels, except that the goal is no longer to find the entry, but the point at which the pattern can actually no longer materialise. You're welcome. You can call me Jens by the way, that's my first name (a common northern German and Danish name). The G is because that's the first letter of my surname.

Nice to meet you Jens, my name is Francesco. Yes, sometimes trying to watching a clear chart and "forgetting" for a second that i have an open trade on that market, it can make me check the situation from another, lucid, point of view. It helps sometimes. I do this mostly when the trade is in profit: i trail the stop onward but not always i'm able to do it succesfull, most of the time it closes the trade just before keep going in the direction. But as i said before, i'm ok with it since is still a profit (especially when it allows me to recover a previous loss). I believe that in future, when i will have more experience on recognizing those microlevels and when money will be less of an issue for me, i will feel more calm and comfortable during a trade and maybe just let it develop properly. Though, most important i have to follow your advice about reducing the SL size. I admit that sometimes, when i'm not sure of the SL i should use, i tend to increase the size of the SL instead of reducing, even if just few pips, but it's still a bad behavior that i need to fix.

Do you have a set percentage of account loss for this emergency -10 pip SL? Being a beginner myself, I only want to risk 1-2% max of my account on a trade. That would normally be just past a recent high or low/micro structure. But with a big -10 pip SL on M1, 1-2% would cripple potential profit target amount. My confusion, or just gap of knowledge to the idea, is that this is how much I'd want to risk when figuring a normal SL as my factored risk of a trade. Not in figuring an emergency SL % of the account. I like the idea of starting with a wide breadth emergency SL and then putting it closer to were it is in line with market structure, and then further as a manual trailing stop into profit. It makes a lot of sense both functionally and psychologically to me. It also allows for quick entries without having to take time to plan SL and TP in fast moving M1. Just enter the price of the Stop order and you know it's a 10 pip SL. TP is fluid and will be sussed out as the trade evolves. I just am trying to figure what percentage of a loss to factor into the -10 pip initial set emergency SL. How much (in pips) should I factor for the ideal SL (invalidating-trade-idea-setup SL, not emergency) that I'll inevitably move the emergency SL to? So basically, if I was to have a "mental" 3-4 pip SL at 1-2% of account, would I make the emergency -10 pip SL 2.5-3.33 times that percentage? Perhaps I'm over thinking it. It's the only thing in this thread that's grinding my gears before implementing these strategies. Usually I'd never have a set SL for every trade as it'd be custom for every trade based of previous structure/action. That was on larger timeframes and margin/spread just isn't as much of a factor with wider SL's and TP's. Set emergency SL's make tons of sense on M1 chart scalping though. I've been finding the larger time frames hard to trade due to just loosing my attention span/motivation while waiting. Even when setting alerts it's hard to get back into the groove of the initial setup after hours to days+. M1 to M5 is much more flowing and intuitive even though it's all fractal in nature. So I'm happy to find this thread. Lastly, thank you so much Jens and Veni for the amazing thread! It was a bit vague in the beginning, but that kind of helped by not dumping tons of info all at once. I've read every post over the last 3 days at work. I'm excited to put what I learned here to practice. Also interesting, to me at least, the last post before this one was made on my 41st birthday. LOL. Also, I made an account to FF just to pose these questions to you. Thanks in advance, especially for your detailed and clear responses. I really appreciate this thread even sans a response! Positive pips to all!

--- 帖子 #576 ---
It got quiet around here recently. Just to keep the thread active until Jens can get back to you, i'll share what i've been doing.. Mate I think you are overthinking it. From what I gathered, the emergency stop loss is just there to protect from, well, emergencies. Maybe your broker cuts out or your computer crashes. Idk. But it is the worst case scenario and not the norm. From what it seems like, though Jens can correct me, it's rare to actually have a trade reach the emergency stop loss. Usually the trade will be cut beforehand when the reversal no longer makes sense. I am currently taking 2% risk based on the -10 pip emergency stop. So if I have a 5 pip (plus spread and commission) winner, I'm up 1%. But a loser might also be cut at -5 so again, I'd be down -1% on that one. Not 2% because I would do my best to cut the trade when it no longer makes sense, not waiting for it to hit my emergency stop. It's all relative, i wouldn't expect the risk percentage per trade to be the deciding factor of crippling your profit amounts (unless you're overleveraged to begin with though this shouldn't matter on 2% risk). What would cripple your potential profit is what Jens already mentioned, bad entries or what not. If 2% risk per trade based on the -10 pip loss is too little for you, I don't necessarily think there's huge danger in raising it a little higher if your gains are outweighing your losses and/or what you make on your gains are larger than what you lose on your losses. Of course, that is something for you to decide. Maybe I am misunderstanding what you are asking. If you are asking what the most likely pips per win is so you can base your risk on that, then based on what I've seen I can tell you it's variable. Some days have more volatility than others. Some pairs have more volatility than others. Maybe the closest you can get is looking at the average length of the legs, but again this can change during the day so it's hard to put an exact number out there. Maybe Jens can give a better estimate just based on experience. Heavy plus, thank you jens and Veni for sharing what you have here. It's been so transformative for my trading. Jens also big thanks for sharing that losing trade. I think there's plenty we can learn from your losers just like we can from your winners. I was even caught off guard by how much room you had given that trade and it helped me further fine-tune my exits on bad trades to not get taken out early. I know it's late, but happy late bday! I hope it was great mate. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #577 ---
You weren't misunderstanding anything! Your answers helped a lot (still looking forward to Jens reply though ). They way I learned is to figure the risk first before reward. Also to base your target on structure and if you are going for 1:1 RR or 1:2 RR etc to not take trades where the price action structure wouldn't support those targets (i.e.: taking a trading right before S/R or if S/R is before your 1:1 or 1:2 TP target.) This was also concerning intraday/day trading and not so much scalping. I know the speed and volatility of scalping makes it a bit more discretionary than plannng entry, SL past recent S/R, Tp 1-3 times that distance. Doing that robs my patience and gives me decision fatigue even when not scalping. I like it in theory though. The set it and forget it nature. But scalping needs more breathing room and the spread can also make tight SL's harder. Again the speed on the M1 charts doesn't leave enough time to plan tighter stops anyway. I like the set -10 pip emergency SL. 2-4% sound good. Will just have to try it all out to see what works for me. Thanks again! Thank you! It was a good one. The wife and I saw one of my favorite comedians, Jimmy Dore. Then the next day we did a nice mountain hike on Boulder Canyon trail in the Superstition Mountain of Arizona.

Almost all my trades run into the stoploss, but only in emergencies where I am unable to act, it is -10 pip. That's why it's an emergency stoploss. The stoploss stays at -10 pip for maybe one or two minutes. After that, it moves to a closer position where I assume that the bet no longer makes sense. For the time being, the bet in post #570 can serve as an example. Why is this SL at -10? It is generated automatically, so I needed a set number. It is generated automatically because it makes sense. A stoploss is outsourcing risk to the broker. It is true that the broker can only execute it if the market conditions are right, i.e. if there is a counterparty. See the Swiss franc in January 2015. Internet, computer failures and all the other things, however, are no longer my problem. Ever had a bet open when the fire alarm goes off in the building? It's nice to have one less thing to worry about. I lived opposite Canary Wharf in London for a while in 2014. Every midday my mobile phone's internet would go down for about 20 minutes if I remember correctly. The mobile internet was my backup line. Precisely because of this emergency nature, it is also really irrelevant whether the -10 is 2% or 5% of the account. It just has to be a distance that makes it unlikely to be wiped out directly by ordinary volatility, and at the same time close enough not to push me into disaster. So to recap: -10 pip is set automatically and then manually pulled to a closer position where the bet no longer makes sense. This is followed by manual trailing of the price, which I will explain here in the next few posts. I will explain some bets here in the next few days. Both winners and losers. My aim is to explain the basic idea of each bet and, if the examples allow it, also the recognition of good situations to increase the position. At the same time, I would like to lay the foundation for explaining manual trailing of the price here, at least as I practice it. Oh and of course, also from me a belated congratulations to you Donny and best regards to Arizona.

yes I agree - this is very common advice and still sound. It doesnt really make sense to go short if there is a support level right below. The good thing about taking reversal trades near a S/R level is we already tend to get a healthy dose of R/R just because of where you are positioned within a leg and its following reversal. Think of a V, and then think of where a reversal entry should be. Based on this strategy our entry would be slightly above the bottom point of that V (the bottom tip plus some confirmation distance based on micro levels). I don't necessarily calculate out R/R on my trade, but I can still eyeball out where my trade is, where the next S/R level is, and where the top or bottom of the S/R level I am trading is. But one thing I'm not totally clear on is how Jens decides a "likely minimum target". Im new to this strategy, but not new to the 1m chart. The problem with deciding your reward will just be double or triple your risk and setting and forgetting is it doesn't really fit the nature of the market. There's never a guarentee that if price goes in your direction, it must hit at least 3x what you had risked. when trading this way, it's very common to see price start going your way only to turn around and go back to your stop. And the worst part? You didn't catch any of that. What I find fascinating is Jens manual stop loss trailing which seems to handle that problem by trailing price to milk what you can from a move, not with some arbitrarily value like 5 pips, but instead based on volatility, candle lengths, etc. To me, this feels less of a gamble/hope and more like following the adage "cut your losses short and let your winners run". Not saying you can't make money with set and forget and I like the idea behind it. But there is some tradeoff there between accuracy/possibly profits and attention span. love that area! This is very nice to learn the whole idea behind the emergency stop loss and its distance. Puts things into perspective. Thanks for sharing! Really looking forward to it. I've been wondering about what your thought processes are like when taking a bet and what signals you are seeing, your explanations will help shed a lot of light!

I just finished reading this whole thread and it's very candid and insightful! I very much relate to a lot of what you went through, especially in the first posts. I was kinda sad the thread ended lol. I said out loud "NO! I want more!" So I just want to say thank you and perhaps you could make an update on how you've progressed since then. Sorry if I'm necroing a dead thread. I just had to give my thanks. There's some great practical and psychological info in here with amazing contributions from the likes of Jens, Veni, and MichaelSch. Thanks everyone. This'll be one a re-read in the not to distant future for me.

Set-and-forget seems to me to make sense especially for bets with a longer but not too long time horizon. If you trade very short term as we do here, you are sitting on it anyway. So why sit back and watch the development like someone operating a slot machine? It gets trickier with bets that last several hours. At the other extreme, bets that last weeks or even months, you will automatically follow a middle course by readjusting in between. By the way, it is precisely this possibility that distinguishes us traders from classic gamblers. While we both do bet, and you can see that I place emphasis on the fact that my decisions are also regarded as bets, whereby even corporate decisions almost always have a betting component. Airbus' decision to build the A380 in 2000, for example, was a failed bet that the concept of hubs (hub-and-spoke model) would win over direct connections in air travel. However, just like entrepreneurs, we traders can also intervene by reducing the possible loss (e.g. by actively reducing the SL) or by changing the position size through partial sales or additional purchases. Gamblers can't. They have to live with their initial decision and can at best cheer their favourite racehorse from the spectator's bench, may Fury please find his way swiftly to the finish line and not to the slaughterhouse ;-) Good to know. Are there any other conceptual ambiguities? I will try to explain them in the coming examples.

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Yes! The longer intraday or swing timeframes make the most sense for set and forget strategies. Though i would still technically consider there being a tradeoff between the potential accuracy and time/attention. I used to trade the 15m or 1Hr time frame (can't remember) and no way would I be sitting there staring at the chart for every bar. But at one point i made use of price alerts on my phone that would indicate whether price was moving towards my target or not, similar to what you would see when staring at the PA on the 1m (w/o the momentum detail). This did required the flexibility to pull the chart up on my phone or computer whenever I felt some action or adjustment needed to be taken. And if I had held positions overnight I would probably quickly abandon this, at least while I'm asleep. i've never thought about it that way. There really are a lot of similarities between trading and running a business.. I used to have one in the food industry SaaS space and decisions always had that risk/reward factor. Thanks for asking! There are two things on my mind, but I'm not sure if they would be appropriate for what you aim to show with your examples or whether it would be better to hold off until later. You previously mentioned you base as much on the last leg as possible. What are you looking at in the last leg and how are you using it? I have ideas based on what you've said (profit target based off some previous pics, distance of opposing candles against your bet as potential distance to give your manual trailing stop) Is there more to it than just that? I'm curious about what your thought pattern or "steps" in trading are. Is it first identify the major S/R levels near the current price, wait for price to approach and make a reversal pattern with confirmation before entering?

--- 帖子 #583 ---
So, I had to write everything twice because I had some computer problems. So here I am again with a longer delay but at least before my annual break for rock and metal festivals. Basically, it's about the observation that in range-based trading phases, really good successive legs often show a tendency to mirror each other. These are all things we have already discussed here based on symptoms: Microlevels, steep and clear and so on. So what am I looking for? For disturbances or momentum in the rise or fall of the price, if you want to call it that. Disruptions can be opposing candles, stagnant stretches and so on. These signal uncertainty to me. A micro level, just like a support or resistance level, is nothing other than uncertainty. Once the level is broken, the uncertainty is gone, momentum comes up and we move to the next level, where bulls and bears have to regroup, i.e. profit-taking takes place or losses are capped (i.e. the opposite side is bought to close out) or new bets are made. From the knowledge of a limited mirror image, I can usually derive an estimate of the probabilities of my bet. If this does not work out, I at least gain the information that the market currently has a certain bias in one direction. Regardless of the current bet's outcome (win or loss), this knowledge is often even more useful for the next couple of bets than for the single one I had just taken.

That is not all that easy to explain. We have all heard the saying: Those who can't do it, teach it. There is a kernel of truth in this, in that, conversely, people who can do something are not always able to formulate exactly what they are doing. For me, the way I became the trader I am today is somehow behind a wall of fog for some crucial aspects in the middle of that journey, and much of what I do today has become more of an instinctive driven, automatic action. So I would only say with a slight reservation: yes, that's roughly the order. Essentially, the first thing I definitely do when I see a chart is to assess whether we are more range-based or trend-based. If I now see in a range-based market that the price is approaching one of the S/R ranges, I continue to work there very instinctively. First comes the assessment of whether it is worth betting here at all and where I would cap the bet if it goes wrong. These steps, however, are more than a rough profit-to-loss estimate, because, from an unclear position where the bet would no longer make sense, it usually follows quite automatically that this is not such a good starting position in the first place. Somewhere around here, the search for disturbances takes place, which then means the exact positioning of the entry and this again raises the question of whether the bet can pay off. If the market is rather less range based, I ask myself if what I see fits into another pattern. For example, is it a possible beginning of a channel? In other words, the order is different here. I am waiting for reversals to emerge first. I hope this attempt at an explanation helps.

As a likely minimum target, I consider a possible reversal point, which I do not necessarily see as the actual target of the bet, but which is at least an intermediate target with a higher probability. I call it likely because the price has a higher probability of reaching it than any subsequent target. There are certainly good examples of this every day, but paying attention to these intermediate targets has become so second nature to me that finding examples suffers greatly from the fact that the execution of my "strategy" is now increasingly intuitive after some 11 years. I kinda like this example (even though it's not perfect): Attached Image (click to enlarge) The second leg ends roughly where the first had its origin. But there is a level in between. It is not said that the price will bounce off there, in fact I have even bet against it. But it is a probable minimum target, in the sense that after a reversal pattern, it would have to be a miracle that this level is not at least reached. In principle, the following scenarios arise for its exploitation: 1. the likely minimum target is identical to an inner S/R zone or microlevel and we use its breach as an entry. This is particularly useful if we actually expect a more distant target and the likely minimum target is too close and we are also rather risk-averse. 2. we can ignore it with an early entry and hope that it does not hold. 3. if we have chosen option 2, it may be a level where we want to pull the SL a little closer. This would then be the agnostic approach. This of course requires a certain distance between this entry and the likely minimum target in order to work. Part of my bet was scenario 2 and I didn't use 3 because it was just still too close. If there had been more space between the actual target and the likely minimum target, I would have worsened my win-loss ratio somewhat by playing the market according to scenario 1, but I would also have reduced my chance of booking a loss.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Let's explain a few examples. Example 1) Attached Image (click to enlarge) We see a downward channel in which I traded the second and third leg before coming to the fourth bet, which I will explain here. In the circled area (1) I lost a bet (which was bet number 3) and got out with a very small loss. I did not open a long bet directly because I am generally suspicious of breakouts out of channels to begin with. A good S/R zone to support a valid breakout theory was also not to be found. So wait and see ... At about (2) the clear wick upwards of the candle that ended in red signals that a higher price seems to have been rejected. However, line 3 could be in the way as a very early likely minimum target. An example of the likely minimum target being identical to a microlevel which again roughly correlates with an internal S/R zone beforehand. I have positioned my sell-stop order on the downside breach of this area. So just below this line. After a short struggle with this line, as you can see from the lower wicks of the candles, the price then also broke and my order was triggered. As I interpreted this as an extension or renewed late confirmation of the downward channel, I was not particularly interested in the circled area around 1, which can now become a possible minimum target and thus a reversal point. If it had, however, I could have reacted to it by already significantly reducing my stop distance there. What I found interesting was the small blue candle number 4, which coincides with a previous low of the channel. This was the area for me to pull my stop much closer and continue to follow the price closely from there. Even if this level was broken, which it was, at least the geometric shape of the channel suggested the natural end of this leg. Example 2) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Also a bet that contains some stuff that's worthy of an explanation to get some details of trade handling across. We have a rising leg with a small disruption, which correlates with an earlier S/R zone (line 1). My point of interest is the reversal and the question of where we can best enter here. We see again how the lower ends of the candles around the reversal point are dancing on this line. I always like to interpret that as a fight. If this line breaks, the price breaks through to the downside. At the same time, we already have a likely minimum target shortly after (line 3). We can therefore play the scenario in 2 ways again: Early entry just below line 1 (better odds ratio, slightly worse probability). Late entry around line 2 (worse odds ratio, higher probability). I opted for the early entry because I felt it was unlikely that the bears would have the upper hand at barrier 1 and then fail at line 3. The chart's history simply did not support such a fickle underlying sentiment. The emergence of the lower wicks towards the end of the downward leg signalled to me again that this movement was slowly losing pressure and that I should pull my stop closer in order to catch a good exit. Example 3) Attached Image (click to enlarge) Now let's take a look at this bet. Obviously, according to everything we have gathered here in this thread, a no-brainer. I find it interesting where the candles of the up leg are longer and where they are shorter. They always became shorter where there was more uncertainty based on the previous legs. No wonder, after all, all breakthroughs in such areas are also zones where more traders decide on a direction: Either by entering, or exiting an opposing position. If we get closer to such a zone, it is a good time to tighten the stop, especially if you need to protect a small profit. Once the zone has been overcome, you can leave more room (by following the price more slowly) and only tighten again when the next one begins or the leg approaches its presumed end. More examples are coming in the next couple days.

Huge thanks Jens for taking all that time to provide all of this information/examples not once, but twice (sorry about the computer troubles!) Lots of gold nuggets in your posts and i wanted to take the time to read through everything multiple times to really let it sink in before gathering my thoughts. Just wanted to let you know that there are eyes on your posts and it is really really appreciated! will get back to you soon with a more proper reply once I feel like I've fully understood everything and even put it to practice. Thanks again!

Example number 4 Attached Image (click to enlarge) It is the inconspicuous things that are sometimes so valuable. What I would like to explain here: sentiment reading repetition tendency of the market early vs. late entry (again) why I use stop orders and don't manually click buy or sell. This market (USD/CAD last Friday) has an apparently rather balanced up/down pattern. On closer inspection, we see that the bulls are slightly dominant and that the market often shows a brief pause for breath at the bottom of the waves. I have drawn in: early entry late entry early interrupted bull leg interesting level At 3 I just got out with a slight profit. So in the future, I would like to avoid such situations unless this requires a really late entry. Without the experience at 3, my entry would have been around level 1. Now I thought to myself, I won't just wait for 3 to finish, because we still have a slight dominance of the bulls, so something resembling an upward channel and not a range, plus that would have been too late/expensive for me. Instead, the market's brief "thinking minutes" at the bottom have come into my focus. If I sit out this period of uncertainty, it only costs me about 1 pip risk vs. reward, but increases my hit rate. The wick in the circled candle number 4 served as a signal for me. Another reason for this later entry is that it can be seen that while the bulls had a slight dominance in this period of market action, the bull legs always seemed a little less clear than the bears: They had slight setbacks or small pauses. All in all, by the way, a market in which one can also trade both sides without much stress. And what does this have to do with buy-stop orders? Look at the long blue candle right at my entry. This is interesting in that others have probably chosen a similar entry level and (as a direct consequence) it also shows that you will almost always get a worse price manually if you don't want to enter earlier at a higher risk. By the way, you can learn a lot about this strategy by studying seemingly sudden momentum. It's basically reverse engineering of what other market participants do, and to some extent at least, it's what I originally did to get into this kind of trading.

This is a nice example you have picked out. A bit extreme and generally more typical for far-advanced market cycles, but I don't have GBP/JPY on my screen. Note that this is not an exact science. Often it is amazingly accurate, sometimes rather imprecise, so that one could speak of zones rather than lines. But it always makes sense to draw the lines over longer distances, even if the precision is somewhat lost in the process because it is essentially about recurring market behaviour at support and resistance areas, which we then use to evaluate an emerging reversal pattern. So you don't even have to know *exactly* where to draw the line, just see: Aha, this is roughly where the price turned before. With this in mind, I have revised the chart for you. Attached Image (click to enlarge) In general, it should be noted that such market cycles are difficult to trade. The more cluttered the chart is with such areas, the better it is to either just stay out or generally limit yourself to reversal patterns at the edges.

hey everyone, apologies for the delayed response. I was caught up in some other ventures. i did spend time trading using this methodology and experienced some surprisingly good success. While Im nowhere near the level of Jens and Veni, Im quickly realizing that with more practice and experience, this approach does prove to be an extremely viable way of trading. The more one observes the charts, the more you will notice recurring patterns and the tendency for price to do similar things in specific situations. Getting the hang of that, as well as developing strong trader psychology, can easily enable us to take high probability trades with favorable risk-to-reward ratios. This is a discretionary strategy. It's not as simple as "copying" the same trades Jens and Veni are taking (because there is a lot of experience/intuition/gut feeling that affects how we feel about a potential trade). Its more like copying the methods they use as a basis for their trades, which may coincidentally lead to taking the same trades. By discretionary, I also mean there is still an element of guessing involved based on what you think might happen, which has already been touched on. A lot of traders wish to find an approach where "if A happens, then B must happen". The reality is the markets don't operate that way which explains why two traders can employ the same methods with different outcomes. By utilizing the methods outlined here, it's more like "if A happens, then B is much more likely to happen, how can I position myself effectively to capitalize on this scenario? How can I minimize losses from bad trades? How can milk good positions without exiting prematurely?". It's almost like there are a series of strategies/methods to manage each of these components. I'm actually dealing with a component of my own right now, and maybe Jens has some insights. Trading after 3AM GMT (around the close of the London session) tends to be bad for my trading. it's not the time itself that ends up being bad, but the market losing momentum. When volatility decreases, potential price targets are no longer being reached and market enters a consolidating phase. Consequently, I either incur losses trying to make trades during this time which eat up previous profits, or prematurely move my stop to break even, resulting in minimal profit. Now I'm considering two options: 1) refrain from trading once the market has started dying down, or 2) allowing more room for price to move towards a target before adjusting my stop, even if it takes some time. Personally, I'd guess the former seems more reasonable unless I'm already in a trade. A few other things on my mind: This trade makes a lot of sense and was executed flawlessly! To use this as an example, if you opted for the late entry option, how would you manage your initial stop then? Would you consider cutting a bad trade somewhere above line 1 (previous S/R level), as shown in the picture: Attached Image (click to enlarge) Or would you wait for the breach of the last swing high? it's worth noting that with higher volatility pairs like USDJPY or GPBUSD, waiting for such a breach could be risky, as the stop required could be as large as 15-20 pips on high volatility days. Interesting, this really puts into context how you developed the various methods for managing your trades. What exactly do you mean by the term market cycles? I want to make sure I'm understanding the way you are using it correctly. To me, it sounds like what you mean by market cycles is the up down action (lower highs, higher lows, etc.). And in that picture the up down action is extreme/erratic/choppy. This would make sense then to stay out or focus only on the reversal patterns at those significant levels at the edges.

A good summary. What I have always found interesting is that you can play the same trades differently while still adhering to the same set of principles. Some go in very early and ride individual bets much further than I do, but also sometimes cut losses much earlier. Such differences can also be found between Veni and me. Obviously, both can lead to success. I know that such bets with a short time span can be a bit problematic for people trading from the American continent, depending on the time zone and working hours. If we use the London session as a base, I always find that there are two good time slots Monday through Thursday: Around the opening of the London Exchange, often about an hour earlier, and then again for a few hours when New York opens. For Europeans, this leaves the morning and midday to afternoon. In Southeast Asia, this shifts to noon and early night. Which by the way makes Georgia (the country), Turkey, UAE or Asia an interesting winter trading resort for Europeans tired of getting up in the dark but I digress. For the American East Coast, there is usually only the morning, because London Open is in the middle of the night. Now on the West Coast, you can work throughout the night and sleep during the day vampire style, at least if you share my assessment of lucrative times. My guess is, this is probably due to the fact that New York is the most relevant international financial centre in the US while Japan, as an important financial centre in Asia, is more domestically oriented. In my experience, Fridays often behave differently though. Apart from the fact that I often find Fridays more lucrative anyway, the market seems to slow down less after London Close than on other days. I suspect this is because many people in New York also want to close out their exposure or move it into safe havens before the weekend. You just have to be careful to get out in time on Fridays. Late in the NY session, the spread can go through the roof. Yes. In general, a late entry makes the most sense when you can pull the ripcord at a less damaging price, too. However, there is a train of thought that finds space in my mind in related situations: If the price doesn't behave the way I want it to for this bet, can I get back in at a better time in the context of this pattern? Practical example: I enter at 2 and the price does not fall but rises. Exiting just above 3 makes sense. Now the question: Can I find another opportunity to enter between 3 and the top if the price bounces back down again from a somewhat higher level? In scenarios like these, where one has specifically decided to enter later, this is of course always the case. The first targeted entry does not disappear. But it is a general question that you can ask yourself if you choose an exit that does not actually coincide with the total collapse of the big pattern. Another way of playing this could be to first halve the position, that means, if your platform allows you to do so. Good point. Perhaps I should have written: Phase in the market cycle. My guess/experience is always that we see such extremely erratic appearing stretches of price behaviour, especially in late market phases in which an enormous amount of support and resistance areas have been accumulated. The market is simply flooded with limit orders at every conceivable area, which is of course aided by the fact that the whole concept of S/R is always somewhat imprecise. It is not without reason that I prefer to speak of zones (or areas) rather than lines, even if we must of course decide on a line for entry (and perhaps also exit). But that's exactly why you always have to see the change in the price action before you assign it to a zone. Whatever you draw onto your chart can only be for the sense of guidance. It is a visual aid, not a road map.

I do agree with your assessment of the best times to trade, and yes friday's market behavior is very intriguing. it's interesting to think about why that happens, and it makes perfect sense that traders would want to reduce their exposure before the weekend. Do you have any insights on trading during the Asian overlap session? Veni seems to have good luck with it. I'm curious if you've ever tried it, especially considering the lower volatility and the fact that you don't ride your bets as far as others do. A few things stand out to me: Exiting just above 3: i see, so you prefer to exit even earlier than the point I marked in the image. Essentially, you would enter a trade when the inner support level is breached and set your stop loss somewhere above 2. The stop loss shouldn't be too tight to avoid getting faked out, but it should provide the room to acknowledge that your entry timing might have been off.. BUT, Possible re-entry: In the hypothetical scenario mentioned above, just because your stop was hit doesn't necessarily mean the pattern has collapsed. It could be a matter of bad timing. If the price goes up above 1 but then breaks back underneath 1 again, it could be a signal to consider re-entering the trade. This approach makes sense to really capitalize on market movements. I wonder if you would do the same if the price broke above 3, only to fake you out and then reversed lower again. it's no surprise people often say trading is both an art and science.

While it is indeed interesting, it is ultimately just a hobby and potentially also not without danger. Ultimately, we make our money by trading what we see. I suppose it's a human trait to want to understand why something is happening, but that can also be a trap if you get too caught up in "storytelling". When people ask me why a stock crashed, I have two standard answers: Because more people sold than bought. I can't tell you either, I haven't been able to ask all market participants about their motivation for selling. My point is: while it is somewhat useful to think about why something happens in order to understand the human component of the herd instinct that will continue to drive market activity even in times of increasing automated trading and overall corporate-like decisions like seeking safer havens for the weekend, it is better not to overdo it. If you mean the transition from Asia to Europe, yes, that is the beginning of my normal trading period, or at least it used to be more than it is today. The Asian session is often said to be more technical. I would tend to agree with that and I suspect one of the reasons is also why I used to like starting at that time at least: The "Western" (US, Europe) central banks are currently still the ones that largely set the tone in the currency market and they are still asleep at the time. Sleeping "currency guardians" are good "currency guardians", they can't surprise us traders so much ;-) Somewhat less jokingly: The amount of economically relevant information that is showered on market participants of various stripes throughout the day is overwhelming at times. The Asian session is pleasantly calm. In the past, at least, I liked to play ping-pong within the low volatility until I could take the first breakout. By the way, the result was similar to the one that someone here in the thread tried to impute to Veni as unbelievable: many small winners, a few small losses and then one or two comparatively large winners. What I find interesting to this day is that it allows you to really trade with the market flow (for the lack of a better word), at least for a few hours. I don't know. Sorry, but that becomes too hypothetical at some point. Real examples are great, I can explain what I see, explain sequences and rankings. Fictional examples are problematic for two reasons: All those little nuances that I perceive, whether I can explain them or subsume them in the pool that makes trading partly a kind of art as you rightly pointed out, are missing there. At the end of the day, I am only a human being. Even if I would like to be a robot in trading, Superman in the gym and James Hetfield at Wacken (at least once in my life), in trading that sometimes fails because of emotions. The new entry, i.e. the second bet on a pattern that did not materialise before, requires an enormous amount of discipline and objectivity, especially after a losing position, which I cannot muster every time.

To be fair. and not doubting you know what you are doing, but it is very easy in hindsight.

--- 帖子 #597 ---
That is so true. Keep it at a curiosity level but otherwise stay focused on what you see. Markets are too complex to be able to know without any doubt what the participants are thinking. I meant the Sydney/Tokyo overlap btw, not when Tokyo and London overlap. Seems like a time where those on the US can still trade without a wonky schedule. I was curious about it because trading costs are higher and volatility is lower so one is more dependent on good trading calls to avoid tail risk of losses. But thinking about it, the way you describe your results makes a lot of sense during this time. Btw is there a minimum range of movement you consider trade worthy, and anything under that not worth trading because levels are too tight not leaving enough room for profits? Like for example maybe you need a minimum of 5 pips for most legs in a range for you to trade the range. Anything like that? interesting that’s helpful. So each situation can be unique and can change how you would react. This approach definitely is much more discretionary vs mechanical rules to follow. Are you able to touch more on adding to your positions? I know in an example a while back, you mentioned we can place additional entries after periods of stagnation. But sometimes price goes fast and then rebounds fast without the stagnation. Is this something you do in all your trades? And do you just keep adding multiple entries as the opportunity arises? How much does your position size change from the first to the second to the..? Thanks for taking the time to respond Jens!

Hi guys.. for me, being able to scalp is like the ideal scenario for trading.. it's like a dream come true .. open a trade.. grab 5 pips.. close.. maybe repeat .. day done in a few hours, sleep with no stress, no trades to manage and Make money! However, may I ask, how are you guys dealing with spreads and commissions? In my experience the trading expenses are the equivalent of 2-3 pips, so you're always starting with a loss. Say you take a 5 pip loss, it's like taking a 8 pip one. At this point, I'm having a hard time scalping because of this, as I think unless you have a very high win rate, on the long term, it's loosing. What's your average TP and win rate% if you are making money with this Style of trading? Just asking , in order to have an idea of where I must reach to Make It happen. Thanks guys!

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Exactly, this was one of the most important aspects I learnt whilst scalping, I could always see the spread on the chart and keep an eye on it live, I also always knew what the minimum amount of pips was to break even...and sometimes I wouldn't get into certain trades due to those factors. Do your own broker research and try them out, eventually you will find one with a platform where you feel isn't constantly trying to screw you over everyday.

--- 帖子 #571 ---
There is a kind of artistic feel to scalping, especially zoomed out (easier to see) There is always some sort of barrier around price action, you can use those as safer entries...places easier to set your risk, it makes it easier to understand and see how price moves. Attached Image (click to enlarge)

--- 帖子 #572 ---
Indeed! Broker selection is key! So what win rate do you have? Say you take 20 trades.. how many winners, BE and loosers do you need to have on average to know that you're on the right path?

--- 帖子 #573 ---
Sorry, I have no real experience at that time. It can't be ruled out that I had a trade open there at some point, but that would be a very rare exception. The volatile and cheap trading times are too convenient for me. When I visit the Americas, I only work when I am close to East Coast time, if at all. 4-5 pips usually, depending on the pair's spread and some shallow risk analysis (volatility/liquidity, close enough exit and so on). It depends on how deep we want to dive into this "strategy". There is a pretty simple basis obviously but any trader who trades his own strategy will develop a feel that sort of acts as a filter for trades not to take and that's where every implementation will appear increasingly discretionary. Keep in mind that I'm talking from thousands of hours of screen time but also probably a couple hundred of hours of explaining it to other people and I still struggle with drawing a line between the basics and experienced-level stuff. Good question. I haven't traded the previous week due to a mud fest in northern Germany (also known as Wacken) so I have to postpone an answer to that by a couple of days to pick some examples from the coming trading week. However, my main goal when increasing positions is not to risk my equity but only unrealised gains so I need to be in the profit by some sufficient amount and a stop loss already in the profitable zone. You have to reduce your trading costs. I have never paid 2-3 pip. As a beginner with little equity and small trading volume, the rebate programmes that exist for some brokers may help to improve things somewhat, but the starting point should still be closer to 1 to 2 pip (depending on the currency pair). In the longer term, of course, this way of trading allows you to take better advantage of the leverage offered by the brokers, i.e. larger individual positions with manageable equity and relatively high trading frequency. In other words, your trading volume should increase quickly, making you interesting for brokers other than the usual retail offerings geared towards low-volume traders. Without wanting to give a broker recommendation, you can see where the trading fees are heading, for example, in the Dukascopy fee table https://www.dukascopy.com/swiss/engl.../fee-schedule/ . I only mention this as an example because other brokers with a volume-dependent cost structure rarely make their price table available to the public.

This is a great point to bring up. I’m in the midst of some of this right now myself. At first I just traded every reversal with confirmation at a previously bounced level, regardless of bounce size or past number of bounces. But oh wait, I’m still facing too many losses. So then it’s focusing on trading the correct big picture market structure (ranges, channels), or correctly managing trading emotions, or... These are pretty easily quantifiable, but interpreting those clues that the bars are telling us as a reversal forms and price dances up and down is where things get a little murky. Quantifying something down to price bounced off this area 3 times right after my entry and I didn’t like that so I exited early is much harder. And each individual situation can be different. As I get more experience with the 1M chart and see how price has a tendency to repeat certain behaviors, behaviors which aren’t talked about in books or articles, I can see that this knowledge/experience can help tip the scales for knowing what reversal with confirmation is worth taking and what is best skipped. Something I imagine you and Veni are now a natural at in your own ways. Thanks for that, examples would be great. And highly appreciate your openness to share with us. Mastering the core of the strategy and filtering out poor trades is the important thing. But I find it very intriguing how you maximize squeezing a move with additional entries, and this feels like a natural extension to continue to tip the scales in favor of larger profits to losses. I’m just curious but are these fees hidden for any specific reason? Can they be negotiated and do they differ between two large traders trading the same volume? Or is it simply that not all platforms are as openly transparent as Dukas unless you call them up directly?

--- 帖子 #575 ---
If companies do not publish their prices directly but only disclose them upon request, this is usually due to their customer acquisition strategy. They want to gain contact with the interested party and this is their way to accomplish that. But it is also partly a matter of negotiation. If you ask a broker for a monthly volume of significantly more than 1 yard (trader's jargon for a billion in turnover), you will usually have their sales droids running after you. This is a very good indicator that such clients are indeed in great demand and that they want to win them over, which is unlikely to work if the costs are higher than with their previous broker. At the same time, their salespeople are not stupid. They know the costs of the competition and also their advantages, e.g. in terms of better liquidity or other benefits worth some money. So there will be no haggling like at the bazaar.

Can you explain it to me? I don't understand.

--- 帖子 #581 ---
This is my own interpretation. 1. Liquidity sweep 2. Head and shoulders 3. Bouncing on previous ceiling x floor via fib. There's a lot of ways to view it. And removing 1 2 3 it still works as simply previous high or low is broken and price returns. I prefer to do this 15m. To small a movement while right kills me by spread. https://www.tradingview.com/x/iwmHu0b1 Here is a trade i just did today. Using this method and fibs. Why all the lines? Cause i move my stop loss based on the levels knowing it could return based on market structure. So i do a ping ping-pong but essentially the model is, break of stop loss, then enter. Here price passed my red zone essentially pushing down but returned to the gold and i took the trade targeting next market break on the left based on the above. 2.1 is the structure break and you'll see the green zone i ploted too

There is no strategy here!!

--- 帖子 #583 ---
You're right, there's no one-all be-all strategy to Fx or financial trading in general. It's a multi-faceted market that you have to adapt to, You can't be successful with a 2D mindset or a magical indicator that turns red and tells you to sell.. I wish it was that easy I really do, but the truth is to be successful at this and make some money to be free from working for others you have to graft..put in work, sweat and tears and maybe in the end you'll get there. I hope something on this thread is useful and works for people.

Hello! I use TickMill with tightest known to me spreads (0pips without news) and lowest commissions ($0.04 with 0.01lot EU = 4pips) on Pro accounts. If I set TP=10pips and SL=2pips I try to gain 10-4=6pips and risk 2+4=6pips. Not a good RR at all looking at the microjumps of the price on it's way to the TP with such a small SL. Would you recommend some other broker or do you really trade without any initial SL? Thank you!
