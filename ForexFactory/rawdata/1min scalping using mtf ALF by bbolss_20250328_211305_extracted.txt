hi all sory 4 my english at 1st point i just wanna share with you the system that i started to use last week its pretty god in my opinion it still requaire some work with filtering bad signals but the loss is always small ant the win could be big! so whats more do we need? but first I wanna say BIG THANX to Lou G for coding the ALF Inserted Code [b]What is ALF? Adaptive Laguerre Filter - an indicator created by John Ehlers. It is a superior overbought/oversold tool. There is a free technical paper at Ehlers' website entitled "Time Warp Without Space Travel" which you may download if you really want to know the gory details.[/b] edit 25.06.2010 update to v2 =] entry rules : generaly its up to you guys witch entry you will take! important is to price cross both ALF ( normal and mtf) and to alf mtf not strong rise when we short and not strong fall when we long sometimes it can but slowly rest is up to you ! we have 2 osma one set to show osma on 5min ale one normal and we have a macd one mtf set to 5min and one normal 1min generaly i prefer entrys in directions of both like here: everything down so we short http://img717.imageshack.us/img717/9679/przyklad11.gif but as we known the macd is based on movin avagres witch are LAGGY so sometimes we can enter in direction only osma 5min and 1min macd should be backing slowly to 0 like here http://img340.imageshack.us/img340/5098/przyklad3.gif for reentry i prefer signal from 1min osma and everything else in place its up to you if you wait for break last hihg / low or not.. if to last high/low is at least 5pips maybi its good to take a risk and take 5pips if it will be just 2t or 2b? like here: http://img10.imageshack.us/img10/2337/re1k.gif http://img408.imageshack.us/img408/9323/2reenry.gif there are 2 ma also 50 and 200 you can use 200 ma as long only/ short only filter but again MA ar lagy so if you feel the trade you dont have to ! remembour trading is never 100% mechanical! tou must known the basics of PA and feel the trade! ma 50 works as s/r level exits: totaly random! based on PA usualy i like exit half at +10 and rest on 5min alf touch (or cross ma 50)(if i took entry based on MACD and OSMA toogether) if i enter on just osma i usualy close all at +10 or where i see that pa will reverse or where it crossed alf again again never 100% mechanical and we have it candles also on chart it colors the charts it is just to see a trend even the small one without draving any lines etc you can wait for green/red candle if you like but dont have to... watch out for divs on exit sometimes and be caerfoul during news - there is no system witch can predict news =] temp is for eu set if you wanna other currency posible that you will have to change in osma and macd the max and min value.. but it is important to max and min were the same- to see the 0 level on mtf and normal in one place! and again if you like my system please rate it i dont known why we have 4 stars only.. edit2 many pepoul ask about chat room etc i dont known if it is such a good idea but lets try it out... go there http://spikeria.pl/room/bbolss/ enter any nick the pass is "1min" without " " off course=] read also this http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3802688 and this http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3802708 very useful stuff ! edit 17.07.2010 version v3 beta in this post http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=552 so what do you Guys think? i would love to see comments/ ideas lets make the best scalping strategy ever !

--- 帖子 #2 ---
updatet tpl 1st post changed settings in alf mtf quick +10 now se how mtf alf filtered first price cross of alf because 5min was still rising second entry ok alf flat and start faling down

--- 帖子 #3 ---
another +10 from just now

--- 帖子 #4 ---
what do you mean when you wrote: "entry long when we are on the right side of the 5min alf"? I understood your tecnique in this way: Long: 1) Price over ALF m5 2) Price crossing from down to up ALF m1 Short: 1) Price down ALF m5 2) Price crossing from up to down ALF m1 I'll post the entries..are they correct?

--- 帖子 #5 ---
yes look ok but it is sometimes important to 5min alf was not still rising when we sell or still falling when we buy

--- 帖子 #6 ---
+8 edit could be more if i wait;p

--- 帖子 #7 ---
+12 acording to system a should be enter about 6 bars ealier but i wasnt in front of the screen at the moment so i have entered ad break of previous high can somone move it back now to trading systems?

--- 帖子 #8 ---
im out with +10 again

--- 帖子 #9 ---
Hi, Looks nice! Thanks for sharing! I'm going to try out your system and hope you don't mind me asking a few questions. On the chart attached on your first post you highlighted with green circles some points on the stochastics indicator. Can you please explain why? What's your stop loss? Previous High/Low? Thanks again!

--- 帖子 #10 ---
off course sl usualy 8-10 pips or prev high/low if its not to faar away max 15 let say yes the circles could be the reentry points if we missed the first entry and there is no cross with the alf (for now) because the price is rising fast the stoch should cross and at least touched 50% level im still testing this think with stoch so lets forget about it for now

--- 帖子 #11 ---
Thanks for your answer! Do you only trade the Euro? What's your win to loss ratio? Do you have any statiscs on your system? Cheers

--- 帖子 #12 ---
yes only eu for scalps - the lower spread is best if we targeting about 10pips but it work on all i checked i have no statistics - i startet trading like this last week but i was stil changing something to make it simple and best and tooday i started it live with final (i think) version so for tooday 14 trades 3loss 11wins in final cound over +100pips my last trade for +15 it was a litle risky because alf 5min wasnt 100% flat but almoust i decided to risk - sl was only 7pips i think im done foor today ps why still nobody have moved this thread where it belongs? best regards

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Well done, my friend, great results! Thanks for the patience that you showed towards my questions and ignorance! Have a nice rest and see you tomorrow!

--- 帖子 #14 ---
Very good Trading System. I'm trying to use it with the simulator but I have problems with the ALF-MTF it goes Crazy. Anyway I will try it tomorrow...

--- 帖子 #15 ---
i dont known who wrote the mtf version i found it somwhere in alf/tvi thread but yes it may have some problems sometimes when drawing, changing the tf for a while usualy helps i didnt try it in any symulator so canot help

--- 帖子 #16 ---
I think it´s a great system. I have made 3 profit trades in a row.. within the last 30 minutes. Thank´s for sharing this strategy with us

--- 帖子 #17 ---
im glad that you like this join posting your charts to help others br

--- 帖子 #18 ---
ok next time i make a screenshot... cu

--- 帖子 #19 ---
another 2 good entrys for about 40 pips but im done for today i was wathing movie so didnt take it shame

--- 帖子 #20 ---
bbolss, can you post the graphic with your bad trades? This can help to understand how to filter... I use Fibonacci, when retracement ends and the signal is genereted you can enter the trade easier i safer..

--- 帖子 #21 ---
2 bad are at post 1 marked red one more litle -5 somwhere later i didnt make a screenshot sory but i will think about posting bad sometimes to

--- 帖子 #22 ---
When I click on the indicators in the first post they download as attachment.php. How do I get them as files Metatrader will recognized?

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Your system look good Bbolss, it seems a good approach, simple and straightforward. I will take a look at it. Thanks for sharing.

--- 帖子 #24 ---
Hi bbolss, Thanks for posting, I'm getting back into re-trading by myself, going to give it a shot! :-) Can you/anyone else that has been able to trade successfully using this system, explain a little better for a newbie like myself, when should I enter/exit ?! What should I look for when looking on 5M and what on the 1M? I have the template and all the indicators in place like on your screen-shots. Thanks in advance, Orr.

--- 帖子 #25 ---
Use Firefox or rename the file with the right name

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Could you give ALF.mq4 and ALF-MTF.mq4 instead of ALF.ex4 ALF-MTF.ex4, ..., might be there are more information.

--- 帖子 #27 ---
Always download them from the paperclip in top right corner---the php thing happens a lot

--- 帖子 #28 ---
What are the settings on your ALF-MTF? The Indie that I just downloaded is very similar to the ALF itself.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
Mr.Bosh you can't use the ALF-MTF on a simulator. When you use the simulator you define a time frame for the chart to run (1min in this system), since the ALF is collecting his information from another time frame, in this case 5min, the simulator will go crazy because it doesn't have the required data. You can do it "old style", scroll your chart back and use f12 scroll candle by candle.

--- 帖子 #30 ---
No need to reply. I answered my own question. My apologies.

--- 帖子 #31 ---
here it is...

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Very good scalping system !!!!. Here's my system to minimize whipsaw and to grab more profit. Please review

--- 帖子 #33 ---
another picture

--- 帖子 #34 ---
Why dont you post it for us please so those of us interested can check it out? Brian

--- 帖子 #35 ---
This system is just a couple of week old Stern-Capita , its profitability can't be judge by such a tiny statistical sample. It's a fact that it does look good on charts, but maybe you're trying to fix something that isn't broken. Have you tested your "improvements" for how long? They can improve the system profitability how much? Without statistical data a couple of indicators on a chart worth just that. I'm not saying you should not improve the system, that would be great for those who pretend to use it, but first you should trade it, watch how it behaves on different market conditions. The market is a crazy place, in order to have a real edge we should understand and explore all the possibilities, than pick the most resistant to the market challenges. I like Bbolss's system and I will paper trade it for a while, than after I fully understand its behaviour and how it reacts on all possible conditions I can start working on possible filters, if it needs one. Now, how do you use your filters? What settings are you using for HA candles and for SAR? How do they change the initial entries or exits, do they give earlier entries, if they do, how many of them are actually right? Do they provide a more profitable exit strategy, if yes what's the difference bettween your technique and the original? Again, thanks to Bbolss for sharing this idea, I already knew mesa's ALF and I trade E/U and G/U using a different approach. This indicator is quite good when used with price action. This simplistic cross system really looks nice, maybe you have something here! I did some demo trades this evening, 2 losses (-6 pips), 4 wins (28 pips). I know it's not the best time to trade, but I coulnd't wait to make some trades using this system.

--- 帖子 #36 ---
no problem take a look

--- 帖子 #37 ---
yes that loooks goood;] but i rather enter exackly at ent of this candle marked with green arrow its new cross of alf with previous candle closed under (its not nesesery touch is good also we must try sometimes like that sometimes other and make a stats ) like i sayed its still under development lets make best scalping strategy ever together ps if you like my system please rate it ! it will make more pepoul to look at it

--- 帖子 #38 ---
Hi BBolss, I just saw Alf in the thread title so I gave it a look. Every trader has his own way of doing things, also the ones that use Lou G's Alf. So far I think your set-up tpl looks very nice and the mtf version is not such a bad thing! Good luck with your trading and thread, thanks for sharing pbb

--- 帖子 #39 ---
can this be used on a M15 TF? thanks

--- 帖子 #40 ---
you can try set up m15 and the mtf alf to 30 or h1 as you like but there will be just a few signals over the week and you will miss some also good entrys with you would take without wathing the h1 or m30 alf on m1 there are so much posibilitys ... so we can live with not taking some because there will be next

--- 帖子 #41 ---
I don't see why it couldn't, just change the AFL settings and adjust your targets. It may work.

--- 帖子 #42 ---
I can get the ALF installed, but ALF-MTF does not show up on the chart, though it shows in the list of indicators. Any idea what the problem is? Also, what should the look back period be for ALF-MTF, 20 or 15? Thanks

--- 帖子 #43 ---
I'm not quite understanding the entry points for long or short? Let alone SL I got the 5-10 TP scalp of course. Anyone who does care to post up a chart with better explanation plz?

--- 帖子 #44 ---
fot normal alf 20 for mtf i found out that 15 works better but it can be your choice did you set up time frame for mtf alf to 5?

--- 帖子 #45 ---
my trades today so far +7 +8 +7 +6 market is rankink so not risking closing half

--- 帖子 #46 ---
Very good Trading System

--- 帖子 #47 ---
There appears to be many valid entries on there that you chose not to take. It also appears that you got that absolute MAXIMUM that you could on each trade before they went against you. Why didn't you take the losing trades and how did you know to take profit at this absolute maximum levels?

--- 帖子 #48 ---
first was just "feel" to exit - first trade after breakfast i didnt wanna be greedy ;] second and third - exit at the same prace as 1st trade becouse i found out that here can be support line 4th trade - exit where i saw that 2 candles was traying break this level and failed so exited at this level - looked like rezistance? but i must say it was a LITLE luck

--- 帖子 #49 ---
woooooooooooooooooooooow that was a luck!!!!!!!!!!! se here exited with +4,5 because i was afraid of a news and se what happend now!

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Thanks for the explanation. Think there was a bit of luck here as I would say that this morning should have been a very difficult morning for this approach. Definitely think you need some additional filters.

--- 帖子 #51 ---
im open for ideas just give a name if you known something that will work good enought ;] i checked rsi cci trix some mtf trix its realy hard find something what will work with alf on 1min ;/

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Dunno mate. I have been trading M1 on and off for a while now, it seems the only way I can make money at trading though, which is frustrating. I am drawing tendlines and channels and waiting for breakouts with higher lows/higher highs forming and then just getting into the new trend. Using hidden divergence with RSI helps and stochs leaving ob/os. Something more mechanical would be great but have never found it. I threw this on this morning on a seperate chart and watched it. Looked very difficult to trade it this morning other than the one big move. How long have you tested this for?

--- 帖子 #53 ---
just a week but have my eye on it loong loong time when the idea came just i didnt have time befour to make system from it

--- 帖子 #54 ---
What has been the average win % so far? Difficult thing about this strat is that it's very difficult to back test.

--- 帖子 #55 ---
about 70-90% even i couple times start using the worse money managmant than i can image - after 2 loses 3rd entry was using double stake and it worked it is realy rare to have 3 or 4 loses in row from what i noticed.. 2 trades +7 and +11

--- 帖子 #56 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Hi, thanks for sharing, could you explain the exact entry point for the system and how long have you been using ?

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Hi bbolss, Don't think you need more filtering. Choppy periods always exists and are very hard to avoid. Maybe you can add some support and resistance to avoid going short just above support etc. and to get a feel of a possible exit. I think that the combination of the 5min alf as filter (above/below), then take trade in that direction based on the 1min alf and colored candles are a good way to go. You can't be profitable all the time and adding much more indys to the game will probably make it more confusing. Support and resistance can keep you out the no go zone on many occasions. pbb

--- 帖子 #59 ---
i wrote yesturday i use it in this version from yesturday but i use something like that i mean with alf and mtf alf from about 2months but i was still changing something adding some stuff some movigng avagres filtres etc and last week i decidet that it is all unnesesery and i can trade using only this entry long when price cross above alf and is above 5min mtf alf and 5min mtf alf is not faling down ( it should be flat or rising up short - oppozite but remembour trading is nevet 100% mechanical - you have to think when you do +7

--- 帖子 #60 ---
Bbolss, in your screen shot I see you took a trade while the 5 min was sloping down. Since it is a MTF indicator, it's getting it's data form the 5 min timeframe, that means it take 5 1min candle to close. See my chart Is the any reason for that early entry?

--- 帖子 #61 ---
As has been said above, maybe the only other filter is to add lines of interest. S and R areas drawn off H1/H4 and maybe pivot points? Breaks and retests could also be added to the strat as safe trades? Maybe you don't need anything if 70-90% win loss ratio continues. This last trade, I was watching it develop as I suspected that the long move hadn't finished yet but the pa never ducked back inside the M1 ALF. How come you still took it?

--- 帖子 #62 ---
exackly this is what im talking about about s/r it is hart to se them on m1 we have to add them on some higher tf (from bigger picture) but the alf works realy good i checked couple times and it the price go to some rezistance level then then cross alf down and cross the alf up again it ALMOUST always mean that the price will make at least double top or break the rezistance so i usualy count how many pips is to last top to in case of double top take at least +5 and usually it work

--- 帖子 #63 ---
yep it was as i sayedit still need some test it wasnt flat but almoust i sometimes risk "a litle" check post 12 same situation

--- 帖子 #64 ---
yep this is the thing with stoch that i hint in 1st post no dock under the alf but cross stoch with at least touch the 50% level this thing still needs some tests but usualy works for me

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Some fair points there. Maybe price action is the filter that newbies will struggle with though. Pin bars on M1 still show significance. Not as much as longer TF's but if you get a big pin on M1, I am on guard. Trading with the waves of the price action is also vital. If you have had a higher high but the strat is saying go short, i'd again be very wary about getting in the trade. The safe trades are when price action is making waves of lower lows or higher highs in your trade direction. I've only been trading 10 months and am still no price action king but I remember back to when I first started out of most of this was foreign. Newbies will struggle to filter trades with price action and would probably have lost a few of those trades that you took profit on this morning.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
here is a good example first cros alf to last top 3 pips - to low! second cross to last top 6pips so i would take it but i was on a forum

--- 帖子 #67 ---
I don't get it yet, I will try to show screens now and you might be able to guide me from there

--- 帖子 #68 ---
this could be your possible entrys break alf 1min and alf 5min up or flat or price still above alf 1min and stoch cross with at least touch 50%lvl but remembour not mechanical chouse the right one

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Yep. Obviously there is a fair amount of discretion needed here. I have looked at it and I think without discretion you might be one trade up today after making many, many trades from 7.30 gmt. If you use good discretion, you would be anything up to 7 or 8 trades up. Yesterday, you'd have been up by a staggering 12 winners if you'd traded 7.30-5.30 gmt. Far more if you'd used discretion. Obviously there are good days and bad days but it seems to win out in the end, but you need good forex skills. The visual order edit tool you use is important I think, deserves a mention!

--- 帖子 #70 ---
Ok Thanks, what do you mean by "Break alf 1min" ?

--- 帖子 #71 ---
mhm this is en ea that allows us to move sl/tp by just doubleclik just like horizontal line it also allow to close part of trade at some point and to move sl to be at some point but use at your own risk for me it is workink 100% but i uploaded it in some other thread and have some pepoul who sayed that it isnt working or doing mess..(thats why i didnt mention earlier) im not an author i found it somwhere paste it just to /experts folder ant try 20x on demo first!

--- 帖子 #72 ---
price go above and close when last was bellow

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Thanks mate. Sorry I meant to say that I have just started using it too although i've just found out that it didn't take my stop out on my last order so had to close manually. Have you found this problem too then?

--- 帖子 #74 ---
i use scripts to open trade with sl and tp from the start so no i use this ea only to move sl/tp by doubleclick and move sl to be sometimes here are the scripts if somone like open in notepad and chance value of lots and sl / tp then paste to /experts/scripts and make hotkey in navigator/scripts

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Ok, cheers

--- 帖子 #76 ---
WOW! I THINK I SAW IT! Just took this trade, closed at +9 pips after 2 minutes lol , was it a good entry?! And how do I know if I should stay or quite the trade? I didn't want to be greedy...

--- 帖子 #77 ---
addet scripts to last post

--- 帖子 #78 ---
i i personaly would wait till next candle close abouve alf 1min on 1min chart it breaked previous high so +8 was to take;]

--- 帖子 #79 ---
Thanks for sharing bbolss, One question please. Does the 1min ALF need to be above/below the 5min MTF ALF when going long/short? Thanks,

--- 帖子 #80 ---
YES! and the 5min alf shouldn rise when we sell or shouldnt fall down when we buy

--- 帖子 #81 ---
uff that was hot i was about to close at -4 becouse of cross the alf but fialy ended at +3 - last candle top =] i could stay longer im going to eat something;d

--- 帖子 #82 ---
I don't trade M1 between 12.30-2.00 GMT, it just slows down too much every day

--- 帖子 #83 ---
Hi, How can i get these alf and mtf indicators to my chart? where can i download it? thanks

--- 帖子 #84 ---
Go to the first post of the thread.

--- 帖子 #85 ---
again ranking;/ im going to make some hadshots in UT2k4 ;] it usualy helps

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Quick question, are you using any other timeframe to judge entry i.e 15 or 30 min ?

--- 帖子 #87 ---
took this one

--- 帖子 #88 ---
Not looking good, what is stop loss ?

--- 帖子 #89 ---
to last top was just 5.1 pips (with spread) so only +3 was almoust shure so i wouldnt take it... beside there are some big news in 4min so better to wait i dont look at any other tf this is the best of this method almoust always you dont have to worry about "bigger picture" just trade what i see

--- 帖子 #90 ---
R1 was right above your entry #1 and second I dont trade right before markets open...much whipsaw of false momentum right before markets open, ie us currency open. And yes good point, many of the best entries are also a new high in current trend this was not yet at par with the first move up when it crossed. All the best Brian PS Was good news so hopefully you were patient

--- 帖子 #91 ---
yes I was

--- 帖子 #92 ---
great job with a litle luck thanx to the news

--- 帖子 #93 ---
thanks bb, now only if i can stay consistant

--- 帖子 #94 ---
Yes, I set time frame to 5 on a one minute chart. It did not work at timeframe 0 either.

--- 帖子 #95 ---
Hi, I'm getting an error : Error = trade in not allowed in the expert properties Any idea why? I put all the 4 files into the scripts folder and made the hotkeys..

--- 帖子 #96 ---
setings&gt;strategys allow ewerything and do not ask for permisions some qiuck and easy pips first fail -6 second +20 third half at +11 and rest ad +21 =] anyone couch up?

--- 帖子 #97 ---
Hi man, where do I find the Settings ?! * on your picture here, how did you take the 2nd one? I don't see a big slopage until a bit later on... also, that's why I thought first one failed...

--- 帖子 #98 ---

--- 帖子 #99 ---
I See, and thank you, scripts working now

--- 帖子 #107 ---
no i dont wait its new Lou G indicator you can found it here http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3799948 but its not part of the system (yet) for now i have it just for overview

--- 帖子 #108 ---
hello bbolss, congratulations for your results, you do some little question: you've tried on other pairs of currencies? or you are focused only on EUR USD? You also do operations against the main trend? operates mainly in London and New York sessions? sorry for my English thanks

--- 帖子 #109 ---
nice work keep it up!

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Hi Traco1 Can you please be so kind to share the indicator TrixH that you are using in your template? Thanks in advance for you help. Regards, Target

--- 帖子 #112 ---
THV Thread, I dont want to post I dont want to get in trouble

--- 帖子 #113 ---
taco hmm can you look thru all day and see if it was at least 1 false signal genereted my my system and filtered by trix? if you will found post here plz just courious - i testet it with trix last with and it give me almoust nothing...

--- 帖子 #114 ---
I dont use the trix for scalping, but you are right it does'nt really help, I do however use the LAG RSI. Trix I found to be to sensitive, lost alot of money trying to scalp with it by itself but i just like to have it hanging around.

--- 帖子 #115 ---
and does this lag rsi work? i didnt try it post some false signals filtered by this lag rsi if you can and mayby the indi also thanx

--- 帖子 #116 ---
Here it is, try it out

--- 帖子 #117 ---
still trading +6

--- 帖子 #118 ---
hmm again i checked all day and i was unable to find at least one my system bad signal filtered by this indi di you found some? edit nice trade ! market slowing down but i see it still works

--- 帖子 #119 ---
You have a great system BB, some of us just like to see alot of lights, I cant wait till tommorrow to try to scalp.

--- 帖子 #120 ---
Hi, I´m very interesting in this Trading Method, but, my ALF-MTF doesn´t appear on my screen. I´ve reloaded MT4 again and again, but it doesn´t work. What can I do ???

--- 帖子 #121 ---
Mine does not work too.

--- 帖子 #122 ---
i dont known guys what are you doing just checked installed clear version of metatrader pasted thre .ex4 files from post 1 to /experts/indicators pasted one .tpl file to /templates opened eu usd loadet template and it is all ok!

--- 帖子 #123 ---
I have the bbolss template in my templates folder but I can't get it to my indicators list.

--- 帖子 #124 ---
You simply click on template button in main menu and select "load template" ;-)

--- 帖子 #125 ---
Thanks, Horuss!

--- 帖子 #126 ---
I loaded the template and its working fine for me.

--- 帖子 #127 ---
&amp; @ BlackStack, Just loaded ALF-MTF (the .mq4 from post 36) twice from my indies folder &amp; got them both working. Did you alter the Timeframe to 5 (or 15 as I did on my 2nd 1). cheers scalpz

--- 帖子 #128 ---
Hi scalpz: Yes, I tried timeframe 0, 5, 15. Tried it on two of my computers, did not see any lines are either of them. The ALF does show up, but not the ALF-MTF. I normally do not have problems installing indicators, I've installed and tested dozens of them. Not all MT4 platforms are the same though. I have the IBFX version. Kind of disappointing. Thanks

--- 帖子 #129 ---
I am with IBfX with no problem. Go to the upper right hand corner and click on the "paper clip". Download both indicators from there. Maybe that will work for you.

Do the colors or the candles mean something to this system? Keep the charts coming with entry and exits. I'm starting to get it.

--- 帖子 #132 ---
no its not part of the system (yet) i posted link couple post ago but its just for overwiew for now=] first trade quick +5 and out not risking to fail first trade;d

--- 帖子 #133 ---
attachment are not working and could not attach it can somebody show me way

--- 帖子 #134 ---
can u tell me plz when to enter.i could not understand bye ur first post .when price cross ALF up wards thn shoul go for long or vice versa.plz tell me .i am very excited to trade your system.

--- 帖子 #135 ---
i think i will let run this one already at be;] edit hmm strange closed at +5 i see today we will go up again ;]

--- 帖子 #136 ---
Good morning. I have a question about this trade as well, if I may Yesterday, you pointed out a couple of trades that you wouldn't take because there was only 3 pips between the entry and the top of the last move. Here, there was only 3 pips between entry and the bottom of the last move? What made you take this one but not the similar long trades yesterday? Thanks

--- 帖子 #137 ---
lol good question probably this that it was downtrend start - 5min alf just starting to fall down yesturday cases that you are talking about was possible up trend end - it rise for loong loong time

--- 帖子 #138 ---
Thought this might be the reason, well worth keeping in mind. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #139 ---
quick +20 reenter at stoch cross with at least touch 50% lvl and break previous low

--- 帖子 #140 ---
bbolss do you wait for the ALF to croos the ALF-MTF before entering the trade? What was your EP on the Euro short earlier mate? I was following it on the chart, caught it going short as well but not half as early as you did. Cheers

--- 帖子 #141 ---
you mean in post 139 or 135? it depends sometimes i wait sometimes i dont you have to use it on demo by i dont known a week and you wil "feel" how good trade loks like

--- 帖子 #142 ---
Morning bb, I long on the Magenta line. is it a valid entry? Thx

--- 帖子 #143 ---
slooow +10 ;p

--- 帖子 #144 ---
Hi bbolss Thanks for sharing your experience. Last trade for 10pips was against the rules as ALF was flat. Can you please explain if i am wrong? Many thanks

--- 帖子 #145 ---
here is some fail -8 ;p

--- 帖子 #146 ---
nope read 1st post it canot fall down wnen we long(or just a litle sometimes ) it should be almoust flat, flat or rising

--- 帖子 #147 ---
excellent and many thanks great job bbolss

--- 帖子 #148 ---
I took it too. I guess you know they will come but taking every valid setup is the answer. What do you think about this strategy in different market conditions? Do you think it has longevity to work long term in all market conditions?

--- 帖子 #149 ---
it should i have the alf and mtf alf for at least 3months and always play in similar conditions mayby a litle stranger;p we had some biiiiig fall down big shot up we had days when nothing happend and i dont remembour any day to be at minus in the end of the day

--- 帖子 #150 ---
Great news! I take it you trade full time, for a living?

--- 帖子 #151 ---
Can u explain this for me plz entry long when we are on the right side of the 5min alf, 5min alf is not STRONG faling down (at least almoust flat or rising) and the price cross the alf 1min short just opposite

--- 帖子 #152 ---
mayby not yet - for now im trading with minilots 0.1/0.2 ;D hard to live from it but defynytly i will

--- 帖子 #153 ---
read whole thread it was explained couple times with good examples

--- 帖子 #154 ---
Good luck!

--- 帖子 #155 ---
+8 with a litle luck i see now that if it is not to far 5min alf can be good sl point

--- 帖子 #156 ---
Can you look at attached pic and tell me if there's anything im doing wrong. when to exit ?? i have had 6 losing trades like this in one row ;-(

--- 帖子 #157 ---
Cant seem to get an angle this morning, what about you guys ?

--- 帖子 #158 ---
Your first two entries should have yielded profit. What were your profit targets on these? Having scalped M1 a bit in my time, I always have my stop loss no further away than the last swing low or swing high, yours look a little wide to me. Can't undertand the last stop loss on your chart. There is no entry here.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Well i have my sl just above/below the alf . and exits would you based on what?? i dont seem to understand the exits. shall i just place the fixed 10pips?? if your sl is even narrower than mine you must have lot of losing trades as well??

--- 帖子 #160 ---
possible entrys with at least +10 every one fail -10 but it was because of news so i wouldnt take it - i would wait dor the news but i didnt take it im not feeling whell seriusly this method is realy good the only thing wrong about it is timing i hate sit infront of charts all day long;p i must thing about moving it to m5 mayby or m15 hmmmmmmmm ;p

--- 帖子 #161 ---
Try and aim for 1:1 risk reward. If your stop is 7 pips and your spread 2 pips, try and take 9. If price is stalling badly or there is a reason to take profit early (pivot point or support/resistance area) then it's not too bad to take profit early but try not to take too little or do it too often. The more often that you take less than your stop loss, the harder it is to make money scalping. If price seems to be really flying, try and hold out for a little more. I have a rule that if price reaches within 10% of my TP, my stop loss will go to break even. Letting a trade that has gotten that close to your TP take out a stop loss of 10 pips or so is a daft way to trade IMO. Every so often you will break even a trade that eventually won but you will cover yourself more often that you will prevent winners.

--- 帖子 #162 ---
Is that a good plan? You would have far fewer entries on M5 and even fewer on M15. You would have to check the screen nearly as often for far fewer trades. You may take 2 or at an absolute push 3 winning trades a day on M5. Why not just trade London open until you are 3 trades up (or 6% account growth at 2% risk), close shop and rinse and repeat the next day. That's over 150% account growth a month for a few hours work a day. I've long held the belief that traders who have nailed trading M1 are the real Forex winners. The best reward for the least effort.

--- 帖子 #163 ---
hmm good point but also you can take one good entry on m5 and take rest the day off set m5 for a while and mtf stoch set to m15 one nice entry morning - short for 57pips it is enought for me hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

--- 帖子 #164 ---
Good luck with that if you do it. Personally I think you are on to something here with the M1 strat. By the end of the first hour after 8.30 gmt today, you had two winners. 45 minutes work and your job is done if you are happy with 4% growth!

--- 帖子 #165 ---
Thanks mate. Will try and if it will eventually work for me than i'll go to leeds and buy you the biggest beer in the world ;-)

--- 帖子 #166 ---
yep that is also true;] i must sleep with it;D how about you? any good trades today?

--- 帖子 #167 ---
I've taken three. I'm using this in conjunction with my usual M1 scalping approach. Two winners and one loser. Not great but not traded a whole lot today. Once you nail M1, you can make a whole lot of money with not that much work

--- 帖子 #168 ---
can you say more about your usual scalps method?;p

--- 帖子 #169 ---
Mentioned it earlier in the thread. I draw channels and trendlines, S and R areas off H4 or H1 and just wait for breakouts/confluence areas and for price to either start making higher lows are breaking out with gusto. If stochs come out of overbought/oversold or you get hidden divergence on RSI, you are good to go. Also, breakouts of wedges are often good on M1, again using the indicators as confirmation/extra comfort. If I trade one tomorrow, i'll try and get a live example up for you.

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Are you trading london session only?? and why? the biggest moves should be through london/NY session no?

--- 帖子 #171 ---
bbolss, My chart only shows black and white candles not red and green. Is there any other indicator need for this purpose? I put indis and template without any change...!

--- 帖子 #172 ---
ok waiting to se;] i thought about that one time some day but from my expirience it is realy hadt to say on m1 if the breakout is or if it will be failed brekout? price offen like to creak s/r lvl abot 5-7 pips and then go right back ? have you expirienced it?

--- 帖子 #173 ---
check post 107

--- 帖子 #174 ---
Yes I have. Like all trading, there are losers but it is 70%+ reliable. You get far more entries with your strat here though.

--- 帖子 #175 ---
ok make mi some screenshots tommorow if you can i dont trade tommorow - i have exam on my colelge;] mayby afternoon something;p ps on Lou g thread about alf some guy sayed that he take 5pips with every price cross of alf 5min hmmmm

--- 帖子 #176 ---
Sounds a bit too random that! Shall do a chart tomorrow as and when I take a trade mate!

--- 帖子 #177 ---
Hi bbols! I interested in your strataegy. Some traders tested it and I want to know how efficient it. Do you have some statistics?

--- 帖子 #178 ---
The only way you are going to know how efficient it is ; you need to spend the time and demo trade it.

--- 帖子 #179 ---
I think that bbolss can count his pluses and minuses and post statistics

--- 帖子 #180 ---
its hard to make stats when im not taking exery signal of this system dont you think? just thats that i "feel" ;p you will probably take diffrent like everybody els start on demo try to start "feel" in your own way and then make a stats

--- 帖子 #181 ---
hey mate. how can i get these coloured candles to my chart? i downloaded the "it candles" and "instant trendline" from previous post here but there something need to be changed in your template i guess no? Can you tell me how to do it? cheers

--- 帖子 #182 ---
copy ths files to indicators folder ant then add it_candles to your chart from mt4 navigator

--- 帖子 #183 ---
Great thanks. So whats the best way to use them? are those candles any good or shall i not bother?

--- 帖子 #184 ---
its realy good on m5 on m1 sometimes late but helpfoul

--- 帖子 #185 ---
dont chase the pips. chase the %growth of your acct. 10pips may have increased my account by 2% given i risk 1:1 but did the 57 pips gain 2% if not then i'd rather settle for a high probability system. e.g i'd prefer a 99% system for 10pips a week than a 50:50 system for 50pips a week if u apply proper MM.

--- 帖子 #186 ---
am doing quite well with this system. so far only wins n BE +1. everytime it moves 7pips in my favour i move SL to BE +1. if it hits BE + 1 it usually hits ur -7 SL go check it out. no point waiting for -7 when u still can run off with +1 in M1 the good thing about this system is that the trigger would at least give u 4-5pips so its almost always certain to give u BE +1 if u move it early enuf. DONT BE AFRAID to miss entries. u have SO MANY OF THEM waiting to come again. an interbanker once told me this: daily charts if u count peaks n valleys only have 4000pips of movement a month. if u count 1min TF its about 60000pips of movement a month. all u need to do is to pick up 1% of these quality pips. be picky. u will have alot to choose from. i always love to trade short TFs. those who dont get it calls it noise. those who see it shout GOLDMINE!

--- 帖子 #187 ---
I understand u. But I just to know ur personal statistics, how many positive and negative enteries using this sistem u had for a month.

--- 帖子 #188 ---
lets say around 60-85% depends on a day

--- 帖子 #189 ---
This is a good system and a good thread ! I am in !

--- 帖子 #190 ---
and fun..will you post your M5 screen shot as you were suggesting bbolss? Would appreciate seeing it.. I like the setup on M5 but would like to better confirm and the trix was not helpful enough for me for this purpose, love to see your stoch setup you are confirming with for such trades. Also you use same alf settings just change to M15 the alf mtf?? Brian

--- 帖子 #191 ---
no problem here was 2 realy good entrys on m5 witch conf on cros m15 alf too (marked entry candles with green lines) setiints fot m15 alf same 15 5 4 entry based on div on osma and second on osma and stoch also for more conf

--- 帖子 #192 ---
can u explain me that why u went long for this one

--- 帖子 #193 ---
The more I see it the more I like it. I just can't stay up all night trading. The woes of living in CA. All I get is stupid asian session.

--- 帖子 #194 ---
Great system. Made my first 17 pips (2 trades) Does anybody have a pip count indicator that displays pips in color on the chart for 4 digit broker ? Thanks

--- 帖子 #195 ---
can u post your chart here for recent trade

Not at my trade station atm.

--- 帖子 #197 ---
Good observation

--- 帖子 #198 ---
Hi bb, I want you to confirm with me that this ISN'T access signal since the ALF-MTF on the 1M chart hasn't gone down yet.... right?! Seems like I'm right and a minute later it's starting to get back up?! please give me full details regards this position how you look at it... Thanks!!

--- 帖子 #199 ---
I would mot trade it. Basic rules + wait for a lower high. Just my 2 cents.

--- 帖子 #200 ---
No entry here mate

--- 帖子 #201 ---
i read all the pages but still have the problem of the mode of entry Please explain a simple facility with chart

--- 帖子 #202 ---
[quote=beck7777;3809199] i read all the pages but still have the problem of the mode of entry Please explain a simple facility with chart [i think everybody is confused here for entry. according to me in simple way forgot about the name of indicator 5 min alf or anything this makes confuse to everyone. i think if u got chart as same in this thread ONE LINE WITH THICK BLUE LINE and ONE WITH THIN BLUE LINE FOR LONG..........1. all candle should be on above both lines i mean thick and thin blue line 2. for exact entry when price (candle ) cross the thick blue line to up side and close up side on the blue thick line thn enter long on close of this candle for short vice versa

--- 帖子 #203 ---
Hi Bbolss, thanks for sharing your system. I had a programmer develop a support and resistance indi I've called Fractal Lines and I would like to share it. I recall someone mentioning they'd like such an indicator earlier in this thread. Essentially, what this indi will allow you to do is to specify the quality of the fractal from which the support or resistance is generated. It works as a MTF support and resistance tool. Parameters: Bars retrace: This is the number of bars that must form after the high, without price breaching that level, before that fractal is valid from which to draw a 'fractal line'. Pips retrace: This is the number of pips that price must retrace from the high before it is a valid fractal. No bars to left: This is the same as the Bars retrace but is the number of bars that must have formed before (to the left) of the fractal high before that fractal is valid from which to draw a fractal line. Because we are using 1 minute time frame with your system, the support and resistance typically generated is weak. So, you I would recommend entering, for example, 20 or 30 in the 'bars retrace' and 'no bars to left' parameters. This means you are basically being indicated what would be support and resistance on a higher time frame chart and is thus more reliable. Don't worry about the parameters session extremes, session start or session end. They are not important. Leave it false. Max lines is important. I usually set it to 3. Many more than that and you won't see your screen for all the lines. Max duration means the number of bars after the formation of a fractal line that the line will remain visible on the chart. Previous fractals will be indicated by red and green arrows. It sounds complicated but it is really simple. Anyone is welcome to use it if you feel it will be of benefit.

--- 帖子 #204 ---
I hope this helps. The pattern you see here is one I particularly like. You see how we are in a strong uptrend? The lighter blue line is the 5 minute ALF on a 1 minute chart. As you can see, this is moving up - the first confirnation we need for entry. The thicker blue line is the M1 ALF. The green circled candle is our entry as it has closed above the ALF in the direction of the trend. The reason why I like this trade is because we have a rounded bottom to the retrace with a collection of doji candles and small candles followed by a larger momentum candle. This shows you that the retrace is dying and that the market is moving back into the trend. I took 13.5 pips, 12 pips profit after spread. My risk was 10 pips including spread. Obviously it moved a great deal more but you can't worry about that when scalping. Get what you can and get out, preferably with as much as you risked on the trade or more. Does this help?

--- 帖子 #205 ---
without rsi and breaks ?;d nice i just get back from my exam im testing new indicator as a filter check out osma with settongs 60 130 45 ! (its 12 26 9)*5 so it is a way to see osma as on 5min... indi in attach.. se how nicly filtered to bad trades right now and i took +10 here entrer at break of last high

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Yep, just an ALF trade that one. Does this indi stop you getting good trades as well as filtering out bad ones?

--- 帖子 #207 ---
my take. just a 20,3,5, &amp; 5,3,3 stoch both signal lines invisible w/IT candles &amp; ALF.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
Can you explain how this filters please mate?

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Sure, it is just 2 stoch lines one fast one slower. When price is crossing the ALF just look at the stoch lines. The faster one (darker blue) will tell you when to go when it turns and confirms the ALF cross and the same direction of the light blue (slower) stoch line or the stoch lines may already be in sinc with the ALF crossing.. The dark blue (fast) line will simply put you in sinc with the dips and peaks. JMO but I think it is a relatively clear indication of short term direction..

--- 帖子 #210 ---
Thanks, i'll take a look. There is a danger though that by trying to filter out some bad trades, we filter out as many or more winning trades. Any additions I think need to be tested and proven to be genuine enhancements. Personally, I think the maximum expectation for an effective M1 scalping strat is 80% if you intend on making any serious money from it.

--- 帖子 #211 ---
It is actually simply a different viewpoint of Pilotui's Ultimate Filter indicator (in a way) from the other ALF thread. It was that indie that I ended up with this from..

--- 帖子 #212 ---
i still not get it mayby because of my english can you write it more simple? we have to look at 0 point or on cross this 2 lines? thanx

--- 帖子 #213 ---
yep most of it but im still on tests in the mather of fact i can secrefice some good trades to eliminate tha bad ones and make an ea of it some day

--- 帖子 #214 ---
Just look for direction. you want all to be the same direction. ALF line down or price crossing down through it. Light Blue (slower stoch) down Dark blue (faster stoc) down You would not want to enter when dark blue stoch (faster) is going opposite the other lines. Wait for it to turn and be with the other lines.

--- 帖子 #215 ---
bbolss hi, no doubt its a great system. I had 90% winning trades or may more than 90% with your system. I use Ema as well. when 60ema penetrate between MT ALF and alf after that i apply your rules and i take any available signal. i am confident, anyone doing practice on your system for month, i am sure this will bring lot more profit to him. I normally avoid adding more indicators to original system but 60ema helped me lot. its great idea and many thanks for this.

--- 帖子 #216 ---
im happy that it works for you hmm ema 60 lok nice in fact it givs similar results as this osma check it out @tommyd i see hmm i will check it also

--- 帖子 #217 ---
i was even thinking about connecting it to dashalt scalp system he use ema 50 20 and 8 and scalp with stoch wneh all emas are in right place but it was a litle strange with all this emas and alf to many lines simple is best @bigmanin whad do you think about ema 50 instead of 60? look a litle faster with similar results in fact mayby even better check here fore example with ema 60 entry to late?;p and see blue circle how nicli osma filter mad trades there emas dont?

--- 帖子 #218 ---
@bigmanin whad do you think about ema 50 instead of 60? look a litle faster with similar results in fact mayby even better check here fore example with ema 60 entry to late?;p and see blue circle how nicli osma filter mad trades there emas dont?[/quote] Yes, bbolss i have to agree with you, it looks more accurate than 60ema. keep it up thanks

--- 帖子 #219 ---
[quote=armaan;3809264] thank you man but I still hope to see chart a clear way

--- 帖子 #220 ---
even 45 look good;p

--- 帖子 #221 ---
I like using all three... for me the M1 is so beautiful with all its potential, I want to reduce my entries and missing a few is just fine to get a higher daily net pip count! I added the stoch setup, the longer osma and the 50 ema and it looks great. Thanks and all the best Brian

--- 帖子 #222 ---
What settings are you using for your stoch + osma? please and thank you.

--- 帖子 #223 ---
As mentioned in the thread 5 3 3 stoch and 20 5 3 stoch overlay just the signal line needed, blank out the main line and the 60 130 45 osma I really like this before but now its golden the 50 ema also helps make sure I am not jumping the trigger too fast because I must have been a gunslinger in a past life I seem to like to pull the trigger pretty quick. LOL All the best Brian

--- 帖子 #224 ---
can u pls post your latest templates and indicators? thanks!

--- 帖子 #225 ---
I personally really like your stoch.. some weird whipsaw times that extra stoch really works great... ie if going short the longer stoch should be solidily below 50 before the 5 3 3 stoch crosses back down usually at same time as alf cross for entry. Just wanted to say thanks for contributing that suggestion. All the best Brian

--- 帖子 #226 ---
Ahh yes, thank you and excuse my ignorance. I just took a look at it and it looks very nice indeed! I notice the 50 ema does create a few missed opportunities but the ones it does confirm are glorious! I am falling in love with this system as it fits my trading personality like a glove. Thanks again and thanks to all who had a hand at developing and refining this system! Happy trading

--- 帖子 #227 ---
Not ignorance, just stating its the same as others I just like putting them together.. real nice Brian

--- 帖子 #235 ---
Good morning to all ! bbolss can u show on previous picture exactly points of enter and exit and why do it like that ? thank you

--- 帖子 #236 ---
it is marked by green square ? enter break alf everything else in place osma break 0 lvl - i like it! exit at +10 bdw i told you guty to watch out and i myself loose like 15 pips ;/ i will never ever go to interactive trading thread again! ever! i just read some guy stupid post that it will break this level and guess what lesson learned!

--- 帖子 #237 ---
I like the trading method in this thread. I am trying to pratice with demo account. the result seems better than before. I lost a lot before and fear to operate my real account. I hope I can build confidence with this method and recover my lost soon. Thanks to bbolss and other nice guys.

--- 帖子 #238 ---
Hey mate. I can see on your chart 2 instances of going short according to your system. any reason you didnt take them? I mean those two on the left before you went long

--- 帖子 #239 ---
yep there is a very good reason i was sleeping this long was my 1st trade in the morning

--- 帖子 #240 ---
hah. fair enough mate. how many trades you usually do per day? Good luck today

--- 帖子 #241 ---
Didn't know which entry you were talking about here but here is my take on it if it helps at all: Entry 1 is sound IMO. Price did make a higher high but the wicks on the peak of the last high show you that price is getting rejected. The signal bar is a nice momentum bar so i'd have had no problem trading that. Entry 2 is one I really like but it probably breaks the OP's rules as price didn't really retrace back into the ALF. Nice little pin bar in a strong move and then a momentum bar. Entry 3 is a valid entry but a failed trade. However, price has made a higher high and the signal bar has a long wick against your trade showing rejection. Given that it had already made a strong move, I couldn't have traded that one. I'm guessing that bbolss wasn't around for the good entries.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
depends on a day but like 7-15 thanx u2

--- 帖子 #243 ---
check out how osma nicly filter this 3rd bad entry

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Good point!

--- 帖子 #245 ---
Thanks for your input mate. regarding entry 2 what you mean it didnt retrace back to mlf? i thought i needs to just cross it and then you enter at close. Also can you tell me why you suggest trading london session only? Last thing. can you help me a little bit with the exits? I always either close early or too late ;-( cheers

--- 帖子 #246 ---
Pls have a look at attached pic. Why would you filter enter in red circle? cheers

--- 帖子 #247 ---
Yip, if you can read PA, you will be right most of the time.

--- 帖子 #248 ---
I would be happy to take entry 2 but I think the rules are that it needs to close inside the ALF and then close across it in the direction of the trade, Bbolss can perhaps clarify. London session is important for me as this is when price moves the most. My spread on EU is 1.6 so if the moves are small, your spread is accounting for too large a percetage of your stops and take profits to make it viable. You will never nail exits so that you are bang on every time...or even close to be honest. The absolute must for me is to let a trade run to at least give you 1:1 risk reward (remember to include your spread). If you are losing £50 on losing trades but only making £30 on your winners, a winning strategy will usually become a losing one. Moving your stop to break even after a move of 80-90% of your stop will prevent some winners turning into losers. If price seems to be really moving, try and hang out for a few more pips. Only experience will let you see this. You can usually tell when you are in a "flyer"

--- 帖子 #249 ---
Not sure what you mean mate?

--- 帖子 #250 ---
Well the red circle entry i would take as it broke below m1 mlf and m5 mlf is going down plus it broke previous low. But eventually it turned into failed signal

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Because you know the basics of price action you can make a call easier and does not follow the signals blindly. A sign of a good trader.

--- 帖子 #252 ---
Thats great but what did you see at this price action that you would skip that entry

--- 帖子 #253 ---
The candle you circled is in no man's land. It wasn't crossing the ALF, it had crossed the ALF 12 candles earlier for a good trade. You will have losers with this, you have losers with EVERY trading method. The only way to filter them all out is to never trade again.

--- 帖子 #255 ---
for me it was good to take the second no clear stay out of alf but cross on stoch witn at least 50%lvl touch and osma bellow 0

--- 帖子 #257 ---
Cool, cheers mate.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
bb Could you please post your new template with osma and stoch ? Thanks

i will post it next week for now it is changing with every hour now im thinking if the normal osma give us something ore just the huge one and it looks a litle crayzy

and im still thinking about some money managment for it so i have a realy realy important question did anyone saw 3 or 4 losing signals in a row? its realy important so think about it look at your charts check your trades especialy the losing ones and post answer...

--- 帖子 #261 ---
I usually skip Friday US session. Not my cup of tea, and if it looks like this, I sign off. Have a good weekend and don't wreck your brain. You will find what you are looking for.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
I agree that overfilterring is not the answer. It just leads to overoptimization so it' not likely to be profitable in future.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Thanks for help this week guys, have a nice w/e and see u on monday

--- 帖子 #264 ---
yep have nice weekend ! see ya !

--- 帖子 #265 ---
This is an excellent system. I demo traded for one day then traded it live for 3 days (just one lot). Three live days and I made 108 pips, just trading EUR/USD from 7:00am-12:00pm EST (3:00-8:00GMT). The only thing I change was the candlesticks. I prefer heiken ashi bars instead of regular candles.

--- 帖子 #266 ---
Great job! Can you please post some screen shots of your trades?

--- 帖子 #267 ---
Hey carrefull, I can see you add one more indicator in the system ! More indicator less a system is readable and efficiente ! The advantage of you idea as descrived in the first post, is that is simple and clear enough to avoid confusion at the time to take the trade !

--- 帖子 #268 ---
yep i known it thatswhy i didnt post my template for now i will delete some now it is just for overview ;d i think i will clear this up over the weekend

--- 帖子 #269 ---
First, Have been doing a bit of trading 5m-15m using Lou Gs ALF with mixed results, but was out of market last week so not sure how the revised ALF is compared to first. Your idea looks interesting, and on M1 there will be more trading opportunities. However, with your question above, and an earlier post where you mentioned you doubled up on 3rd trade, it sounds like you are looking at some sort of martingale system for lot size dependent on consecutive losses - you really don't want to do that, trust me. Black swans exist. I'm very much a probabilty type of guy, and I think your idea has potential - if it can win even 60% of the time, with the right MM and R:R it is a winning strategy in my book. But I don't believe the forex market is the place to be doubling up on bets as part of a MM plan. X.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
But ALF indicator based on regular candles so how handle this problem? Would you like to post some of your trades?

--- 帖子 #271 ---
i prefer still this it candles from Lou link in post 107

--- 帖子 #272 ---
IT Candles are all black, will they change once the market opens ?

--- 帖子 #273 ---
nope they arent you did sth wrong did you add both inid to right folder? it candles need to have the second indi in experts/indi folder too

--- 帖子 #274 ---
Happened to me to. Left everything as it was, restarted MT and it was all good

--- 帖子 #275 ---
K Thanks

--- 帖子 #276 ---
what 2 indi's need to be loaded ? I have IT candles and Trendline.

--- 帖子 #277 ---
no it need to be just in the folder the candles show same think but more clear

--- 帖子 #278 ---
something must be up with the platform, o well i will see what happens when the market opens.

--- 帖子 #279 ---
just a thought BUT PLEASE READ THIS CAERFOUL AND TWICE befour you answer... so we have a system that give us EVERY day at least COUPLE of signals to take lets say +10 so what if we try do it this way (i known that every book say do not to but i still think that in this case that will work!) we will use tp=10+spread, sl=10(with spread) first entry 1 lot if tp hit ok next entry again 1 lot if first entry hit sl second entry 2lots if tp hits next entry 1lot if sl hit next entry 4 lots if tp hit next entry 1 lot if sl hit next entry 8 lots tp hit next entry 1 lot and from the begining i look over the weekend at some random dates seraching for a day when we will have 4 5 or more loses in a row iw we will take every signal! and i didnt find! one with 5loses max if i remembour right but it was night when i do not trade it requaie some casch on account but i think that this realy can work im waiting for yours answers/opinions tomorow and have good night all!

--- 帖子 #280 ---
Really this need to be backtested a lot....

--- 帖子 #281 ---
Hugely, hugely dangerous for me. Because something hasn't happened before, it doesn't mean it won't happen in the future. It could happen this morning. If the next 5 trades were losers, it could ruin a new trader or wipe an account by using this approach. There are enough winners with this system to trade through any losses. With a 70-80% win rate, just take the losses on the chin, even if it's the first trade of the day. It's easier to trade through losses on M1 than any other TF.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
i known that so i wanna ask you guys to sacrifice an hour or two ! and try to check some realy random dates and check if im right ! if you will found something make a screenshot and post !

--- 帖子 #283 ---
i known this is not for new traders im shure of it you known everything depends on casch ammount on your account... even if we would have 5loses in a row we can off course take next trade with 16lots % of having 6 loses is like wining lotto take some time and dig a litle plz

--- 帖子 #284 ---
This will work! and keep working! possibly for weeks, maybe even months! and then wipe out most of your account... and that only has to happen once. Once, even if it is one in a thousand. You need to re-read my earlier post. This is the novice gamblers "holy grail", and from someone who has spent considerable time in casinos I have seen it time and time again. You need to develop your trading system and trade off the probability of winners, not gamble using a martingale system of betting. X.

--- 帖子 #285 ---
best think would be to meke an ea from it and backtest;] but im guessing it will be hard to make an ea based on alf?

--- 帖子 #286 ---
The poster above is right. It may not happen on backtesting, it may not have happened soon but it can and probably will happen at some point and unravel all the good work you have done in building your account up. If you have a system like this one that wins 70/80% of the time with at least 1:1 R/R, why do you need to take crazy risks? Just keep growing that account and one day, you'll trade from a beach and scoff at the idea of a dreary job behind a desk. A great number of traders fail not because they don't win most of the time but because they want to win more quickly than is realistic. Take it easy and great things can and will happen.

--- 帖子 #287 ---
probably you are right ;D i will think about it with mayby some small account and mayby play minilots 0.1 0.2 0.4 0.8 1.6 does not sounds so crayzy?;d my entry from now sl at +8 for now we will se;] edit sl at +15 (at alf 5min ) edit 2 i closed at +20 strange thisgs start to happends;p edit 3 yep good choice;]

--- 帖子 #288 ---
+10 x2

--- 帖子 #289 ---
bbolss, I've tried to duplicate your chart so I can follow your trades but haven't been able to. I've downloaded all the attached indicators and the template from post #1 but you've changed it since then. Can you post a template or tell me where it's already posted? Thanks, Barry

--- 帖子 #290 ---
several pepoul already asked about it hmm it is still not finished but here it is if somebody want last temp and indi

--- 帖子 #291 ---
short sl at +10 already edit close at +30 (strong 4h up trendline )

--- 帖子 #292 ---
Hi Bbolss, Try putting this indicator, found in forexfactory too. I just use ALF and TrendMagic. Do you see anything that can help to make this system better?

--- 帖子 #293 ---
hmm and how it does help? post some screenshot plz

--- 帖子 #294 ---
Overall, We enter when trendmagic change color blue for long and red for short. We wait till price retrace back to trendmagic or to ATF. But I couldn't find any solid strategy to enter, yet. Currently i'm trying on simulator Hope this can help.

--- 帖子 #295 ---
Just nailed 20 pips, entry at arrow

--- 帖子 #296 ---
i dot known i prefer mtf alf with osma i took +50 xD

--- 帖子 #297 ---
Wow 50 pips, and you call this system scalping??? LOL

--- 帖子 #298 ---
lol half taken at +10 off course sl at be and i had a feeling that we will break this up trendline from h4 and we did

--- 帖子 #299 ---
Would you be so kind as to mark your entry, exit points and tell us what "signal" made you get into that trade? I say "signal" in quotes because I'm still struggling with ALF and ALF-MTF. I've tried taking trades where it looks good (as in your picture with M1 ALF below M5 ALF, lined up with every combo of indicators I could throw at it) but still got stopped out when price completely reversed (and I don't mean re-testing). There must be some other filter you're using -- not an indicator -- time of day? trading range? support/resistance, price breaking support (as in what I see above) ... something????? Thanks, Deb

--- 帖子 #300 ---
and last +10 for the end of a day !

--- 帖子 #301 ---
bbolss, Where was your entry for this last trade?

--- 帖子 #302 ---
at green line? osma for 5min was &lt;50% and osma for 1min went down everything else in place=] tp 10.

--- 帖子 #303 ---
I'm sorry. I was in a hurry and I looked right past the green line. My apologies. Thanks!

--- 帖子 #304 ---
Has anybody made a fully functioning autmatic EA with this yet? I'd be willing to do it, but I'm not sure if you guys have figured out what all to use. Everybody is using the ALF, but some seem to prefer also using MA crosses, and other things as well. Also, has anybody tried using a 5 min ALF to enter and a 15 or 30 min ALF to set up SLs and TPs?

--- 帖子 #305 ---
hey bbolss, could you explain how your using your new template with OSMA, Can you explain your entries and exits strategies? I was reading through the forum, but I didn't see it, did I miss it? ...haha Thanks!

--- 帖子 #306 ---
hi would u mind updating your improvements n attachments on the 1st post so that it wont be so messy? also helps the readers to be briefing on the thread's evolution.

--- 帖子 #307 ---
when im done tests i will update 1st post for now i still dont known how to describe good entry ;p is the both osma must be on right side? etc i make a jurnal of my entrys and exits and i think at end of a month i will check witch was the bests !

--- 帖子 #308 ---
mhm 1try down sl -7 i could take +5 but i wasnt fast enought ;p second try down +18

--- 帖子 #309 ---
+8 could be +10 but i didnt wana risk;p

--- 帖子 #310 ---
+10

--- 帖子 #311 ---
Well done! What are the candel's that you use? Do they help in any way?

--- 帖子 #312 ---
i watch m5 also so the candles realy help on m5 on m1 hmm sometimes its it candles check post 107 ;p

--- 帖子 #313 ---
this is going so well you will become a millionaire soon

--- 帖子 #314 ---
lol some day enybody had some good entrys today?

--- 帖子 #315 ---
bbolss, why dont you share what you have so far? posting pictures based on your new template isnt really helping me so far. Share what you have so far so we as a forum community can help to improve it together.

--- 帖子 #316 ---
if you would read the whole thread you will noticed this http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3816994 even i made a link in 1st post about an hour ago...

--- 帖子 #317 ---
Cheers mate!

--- 帖子 #318 ---
how are u doing with this system so far mate? u demo or live?

--- 帖子 #319 ---
I'm trading it in fits and start along with my own strat. It's won every single day i've followed it. You will get plenty of losers though but you'll win in the long run.

--- 帖子 #320 ---
Hi bbolss, When you say, you watch m5 candles what is it that you look for in that time frame. Is it exhaustion of the move or trend agreement with m1 or what else. Can you please explain. :^) Thank you, bcarbon

--- 帖子 #321 ---
first -3(close manualy) i could stay;p second +10

--- 帖子 #322 ---
im just wathing and drawing important trendlines it has very litle effect on my trading on 1min only sometimes when i see important s/r - im thinking about moving this system to m5 it could give us les entrys but more profit from trade im just thinkink for now;p it look like this

--- 帖子 #323 ---
bbolss, If it is not too much trouble, can you post a pick of your 1m trade chart (when you take a position) and next to it a 5m chart so that I can compare. Thank you so much for your time and effort. I really appreciate it. bcarbon

--- 帖子 #324 ---
hmm i can think about it but this will give you nothing?;p you can compare last 2 trades one -3 second +10 from post 321 with 5min that i just posted it was during 6 and 9 candle from the end - two big red;D and what you wanna see there?

--- 帖子 #325 ---
just found this thread....nice scalping system Bbloss

--- 帖子 #326 ---
thanx if you like it plz rate it half +10 half +30

--- 帖子 #327 ---
I started testing this setup today (EUR/USD, live account, micro lots), here is what i get: +5 +10 +7 +7 +10 +8 -4 +43 for the day and running a short at +9. Euro open and US open, just using alf and alf mtf, nothing more. I think you really got something here. Best setup with a 1-2-3 pattern according with 5m chart. I'll try put some screenshots when i get some free time. Thanks for sharing it.

--- 帖子 #328 ---
no problem post charts off course and mark 1-2-3 on this where you used it

--- 帖子 #329 ---
+10

--- 帖子 #330 ---
The longer osma is a nice filter but the shorter (12-26-9) seems to keep me out of way too many trades. Does anyone agree or have another idea about that?

--- 帖子 #331 ---
i never sad that this is perfect setup;D im open for any ideas =] ps post screenshots where id filtered a good trade for you

--- 帖子 #332 ---
Why take take that short at that point when the longer osma was bullish?

--- 帖子 #333 ---
but it was &lt;0 and i sow 1-2-3 patern and short osma down and hiden div on shorter osma ;p if you would enter when longer osma changed colour you still could take +10 =]

--- 帖子 #334 ---
Where did you enter and exit? (post 321)

--- 帖子 #335 ---
yeah i saw that particular post with the indicators and template files, i was looking for the rules associated with the newly designed system.

--- 帖子 #336 ---
enter at green line! exit at +10

--- 帖子 #337 ---
I am fast warming to the idea of trading just this with price action. What so few will realise is how a simple idea such as this has huge potential. It should work in any market conditions as long as you are shooting for 1:1 risk/reward and for most people, a working day finishing at +4% account growth would more than do. I have tested this for a while now and am increasingly sure that you could do that most, if not every day in 1-3 hours work. He's definitely unearthed a simple and easy way to make money on M1. Most folk will think it's too simple though, i've little doubt.

--- 帖子 #338 ---
Morning guys. Doing my first day live and so far a had one trade +9.3pips and end up break even. second one +9 and end up sl -9. really struggling with exits here. absolute science for me :-( ;-(

--- 帖子 #339 ---
im today on m5 will see how it will go;p but fingers crossed for you guys!

--- 帖子 #340 ---
If you reached +9 and your stop loss was -9, why didn't you take profit? I usually only aim for 1:1 when scalping. If I have a feeling (they only come with screen time) that i'm at the start of a big move, I may let one run but usually, caution is best practiced. What was your stop loss on the first one? Personally, if a trade has gone 90% toward my TP target and reverses, I will close at BE unless I have a strong feeling that i'm in a good trade.

--- 帖子 #341 ---
At first one i had sl 10. i think im too greedy or what. always sort of waiting for 10 pips profit. dont have problems with entries its just those bloody exits are killing me

--- 帖子 #342 ---
I would have probably ended up at BE on the first one as well then. If my risk was 10, i'd want 10 out of the trade unless price action was clearly telling me that I wasn't going to get it. Can you throw a chart up or let me know what time GMT your entry was?

--- 帖子 #343 ---
I like your color scheme and indicator list. Any chance you couple post a template for us? Thanks, Ed

--- 帖子 #344 ---
first one 10.30 uk time @1.2282 long - end up b/e second one 11.00 @ 1.2286 long - end up -9 on both of them i had my finger on the button when was +9 but was greedy....

--- 帖子 #345 ---
Hi, I've marked out the candles I think you entered on with green rings. I have also marked out where your stop loss should be (in my opinion) with the yellowish bars. The first trade has a stop loss of about 4.5 - 5 + spread. This is a pip or so under the most recent swing low (you see this?). The second one would have been about 8.5 - 9 + spread. With my Spread, I would have taken profit around about 10 pips on this. Just no need to be greedy. So on the first trade you could have happily got 1:1 risk reward because your SL was small. With small SL trades, nothing wrong with holding out for a little more if you think it's there. Your entry was good but it was your stop placement and take profit that was all wrong. The second one is touch and go. I may have taken profit at 10 pips, however, if I had left it I would then have seen a doji form. After a long run up with mostly bullish candles, this is a warning. If i'd seen the doji around my TP mark, I probably will have closed. Even if I hadn't taken profit here, my stop loss would have been moved to break even so I would not have lost money on this trade. It's criminal in scalping to have let it go to around 1:1 R/R on a trade like this, yet still lose money on it. Trade management will come in time. It takes a bit of practice. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #346 ---
I think you are right, the R/R is very important. But if you can do 1:1 i think thats ok. Did my first Demo trade yesterday with +3 pips. Very interesting System.

--- 帖子 #347 ---
yep after couple hours on m5 i did my first trade with +14 and it took me about 50min;/ mhm in m1 i could probably make more from the morning;p

--- 帖子 #348 ---
Not worth the time IMO. You have a cracking M1 strat here. Go make yourself rich with it mate ;-)

--- 帖子 #349 ---
i guess i will have to how about you? did you stopped this rsi think with breakouts?;p you promissed me a screenshot;p

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Crap, I did, didn't I? Sorry mate. I will get you one. Promise!

--- 帖子 #351 ---
what a beutiful move. and obviously i didnt get on that train. did you guys catch it?

--- 帖子 #352 ---
nope ;/ i decidet that the market will rest till news about seles hous in about 10min i was wrong;/ but watch caerfoul now

--- 帖子 #353 ---
i stayed out because of the same reason ;-) 4 min to gooo

--- 帖子 #354 ---
300k??? what a miss

--- 帖子 #355 ---
yep i took quick +10 i see fibo 50% is holding for now;/ but still watch caerfoul

--- 帖子 #356 ---
have done quick 10 too. now watching to break

--- 帖子 #357 ---
it was realy terrible news and we didnt break it so i dont think we will... im going out get some gresh air dont wanna be part of it i think;d

--- 帖子 #358 ---
thanks mate. i had my sl in first case at your yellow mark but moved it to b/e when i was +5. in second one i suppose to do the same thing and i didnt now i know and learned. so my sl is not an issue its just the fact that i dont take profits. dont have this feeling yet when its the right time ;-) at mo im trying to use your advise about 1:1 R/R and doing gooooood so far. the thing is that i used to work on much bigger timeframes and thats why its a bit strange for me to take 5 pip profit ;-) thanks again for your input mate. much appreciated

--- 帖子 #359 ---
You're very welcome bud!

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Here's my strategy for using this system. Timeframe: M1 Sessions: London and U.S., currently looking at Asain session The original strategy on post #1 still applies, trade only in the direction of ALF M5, don't trade if the line is parallel, wait for a candle close above/below ALF M1 line. Use OSMA (60,130,45) to determine stronger long term trend, trade only in the direction of this OSMA. Above 0.00 for longs, below 0.00 for shorts. Use stochastics and OSMA (12,26,9) to determine entries. Enter long when stochastics moves above 50, and OSMA (12,26,9) moves above 0.00. Enter short when stochastics moves below 50, and OSMA (12,26,9) moves below 0.00. Note: Its good to know some patterns like double tops, double bottoms, head and shoulders and such. If you have any questions, or suggestions please feel free to share them.

--- 帖子 #361 ---
hi, am new to this thread, i am looking for an effective scalping method to get my scalping skills improved, what can you tell me about this system? Is it stable or new? profitable? thanks adrian

--- 帖子 #362 ---
I have found some comfort in adding a 5 min MTF Stochastic to the chart to filter false entries... -Observe the 200 EMA... Watch for breakouts or short when price is under, long, over Stoch Settings are 8,4,4 All Rules from Post #1 apply.. Price is below 1 min ALF, which is below 5 min ALF AND 5 min Stoch has peaked, crossed and is heading down, below the 75 level... +50 pips this morning after the NY open in 1 hr from 8:42 until 9:52 or so...

--- 帖子 #363 ---
200 ema (green) give us same results as 5min macd check out! macd gife also food entrys usual and stoch mtf hmm did you trade couple days with it? i had my time with mtf stochs but usualy you canot belive them - stoch cross as pa move not vice versa ;p

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Thanks for the heads up on the 5 min MTF MACD! It does indeed seem to be the same as the 200 EMA. This particular MTF Stoch has been good to me. It behaves itself pretty well... you need to occasionally refresh it by clicking on its properties and saying "OK". I'd like to find the MTF MACD version you are using... The one I have only has a 1 color histogram.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
I think instead of using the MTF M5 Stoch, I would rather TP at the pivot point.

--- 帖子 #366 ---
Hi Bbolss. Thank you for sharing your system. Results very impressive! I read through whole thread. Just want to ask you - could you open a skype room in order to discuss trades online in real time? I think, we don't need to ask questions there or discuss rules so much (in order to do not divert each others too much) - just information about entry, exit... etc.. we could write when entered when exit.... If big questions - go to the forum. What do you think?

--- 帖子 #367 ---
i thought about that but hmm skype chat room etd are good for 5min systems 15 h1 etc for m1 i dont known if it is relevant - befour you even ask on skype room if this entry will be good ot do we consider it it will be too late dont you think?;p @jnevins here you go check it out

--- 帖子 #368 ---
I mean not before enter but just after... for example - you (or somebody) have entered and after that type in skype: I entered. (or exit). Very brief information. Everybody can see on their charts the present situation. I don't mean a "signal service" ... just in order to better understand current situation on the market and position of indicators... I think, with such communication everyone can understand the system better and the possibility of "feeling" of the market will be much better (because I see, you have such feeling). And it will be BIG help from you as a creator of this system, and I'm sure, everyone will appreciate it very much.

--- 帖子 #369 ---
hm i will think about it next week today im on exam br

--- 帖子 #370 ---
please,attach the latest - TEMPLATE -

--- 帖子 #371 ---
today results 7 trades 5 - positive 2 - negative total +26 p Several trades I missed. Its would be positive... about +7-10 p Good. Thank you Bbolss.

--- 帖子 #372 ---
go here http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3816994

--- 帖子 #373 ---
Once we have some solid rules, it would be nice if someone can create an EA to alert of possible trades.

--- 帖子 #374 ---
lol i just back home from my exam and grabbed quick 50pips during eating ;D this is so beautifoul in this ssytem - you do not have to worry about anything you dont care about some big trends on dayly h4 h1 etc you just take what you see;d any one took this to?

--- 帖子 #375 ---
i was on this train but took only 10 pips ;-(

--- 帖子 #376 ---
thats why i like sometimes take half at +10 and make free run somtimes i hit be but sometimes there is nice move like this! especialy that we had 2 litle higher lows so i do it this way bdw hmm i think that i will delete stoch for now i think it is redundant - check out - if it is a potential reentry with at least 50% touch stoch cross it is usually fast osma signal to reentry to will see tommorow!;d

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Interesting picture, but where were your entry and exit points? The green dotted line for entry? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #378 ---
yep green line was entry exit half at 10 sl to be and moving sl when it was rising and i took rest at 50

--- 帖子 #379 ---
+10 here entered at break 3times tested low i closed all at +10 no free trades - its late market is slowing hmm i think i go sleep;p see ya tommorow!

--- 帖子 #380 ---
Hi bbolss, can you tell me the rules for the last template that you use, please?

--- 帖子 #381 ---
give me time ok? during weekend i will update 1st post with my last temp and rulez;] now still on tests;p

--- 帖子 #382 ---
hi Please explain how and why we use osma with this system. I have tried searching this thread but cannot find the answer. thanks for this nice system. I only take +5 every trade and I am doing it successfuly. Thanks

--- 帖子 #383 ---
After watching the market for awhile, ive noticed that both London and U.S. sessions usually attempt to test a pivot point. So for example, if you must leave and go do something, I would close 1/2 of your position, ensure you have an SL just in case, and set TP to the nearest pivot point. I usually wait 1 hr for the market to make up its mind, and I will usually trade within that direction. Today was a good example of this, what does everyone think about this? Note: Look where i said there was a nice trade, notice how its another perfect example of the trading rules i specified in post 360

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Had a perfect 11 for 11 trades this morning using the 5 min ALF with the 1 min ALF on the 1 min chart. Grew my demo account 14%... I made a couple of errors in jumping in too early but the larger trend was down so I waited it out and they came back.... I do prefer the 3-10 minute trades though. I used the 5 min MTF Stochastic set to 8,3,3 this morning to help with the entry. Exits are fib pivots, the 200 ema or 200 EMA envelopes set at fib number deviances starting with .13, .21, .34, etc. MM is to take acct. balance and divide by 5,000 for the number of lots to trade. I added on some 1/2 lot trades when I was feeling aggressive... I'm starting to like this.....

--- 帖子 #385 ---
I always have FibPivots v2 on my charts. It is one of the better leading indicators as price always respects them. I do agree that trading with a a good "nautical chart" gives you a better sense of things rather than being adrift in the middle of the ocean. I also use 200 EMA envelopes .... they always seem to work too....

--- 帖子 #386 ---
Hello to you all As far as my understanding goes, price needs to cross both ALF lines for an entry (let's forget about other considerations such as stoc, macd etc for a moment) I am aware that if the price crosses ALFs in bullish this is a buy. Here's a question, is it always a buy entry if the price crosses ALFs in bullish regardless of a direction of ALFs whether ALFs are in bullish or bearish?

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Its important to look at the M5 ALF, if the M5 ALF line is above price action, then you could say its acting as resistance, therefore providing a bearish signal. If M5 ALF is below price action, the you could say its acting as support for a bullish signal. The point of having the M5 ALF is to show support and resistance in regards to price action. I hope i answered your question? Let me know if i didn't, i will try to clarify it if i must.

nice job!! What broker do you have? I know GBPJPY is a nice pair but sometimes the spread is too much, I've been looking at EURJPY during Asian session, its looking rather nice. EURJPY usually doesn't have as much of a higher spread then GBPJPY.

Hi bbols Giving your system a bash. I trade gbp/usd . Went short on the 2 red vertical lines for 10 pips each. So far so good. Thanks

--- 帖子 #393 ---
Where did you get the alf meter from ?

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Couldnt resist Took another 10. Traco check on the original Alf thread from Lou G . I think Pitlou posted the indicators.

did you think about skype room? Let's get in touch and make a best system together.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
yep i created some room on free nice server where we can use mics also sometimes in 1st post now also !

I'm using JadeFX for my demo acct right now. They are a STP (straight through processor) ECN with low spreads and lightning fast execution. The typical spread on the GY during the NY session has been 2.5 pips with a .6 pip commission.

--- 帖子 #401 ---
did you try to use for entries just crossing of both mtf and mlf? or you always trade as per rules in 1 post

--- 帖子 #402 ---
Hello brother Thanks for Nice system. I am testing this past 15 days .. I am using only ALF &amp; ALF-MTF But I am using One minutes chart with Alf , ALF_MTF 5min &amp; ALF-MTF15 min. Entry Rules: ALL three alf are up. Exit : Up to you (ALF showing down) (I personally used based on price cross with 15min ALF. I am expecting more than scalping.) .. SL: 10-15 pips based on volatility.

--- 帖子 #403 ---
buu i was drinking beer with my friend and missed such a nice PERFECT entry could made 100pips in such a easy way! i go to drink another... ;p anyone catched up?

--- 帖子 #404 ---
I forget where I've heard this before, but someone told me once to never drink and trade, no matter what!! ...haha

--- 帖子 #405 ---
Now that we have some solid rules to go by, can someone create an EA to provide alerts on possible trades. On screen alerts, even email alerts.

--- 帖子 #406 ---
so make one if you can im terrible programer so dont count on me bdw i changed the thread name from 1min scalping using mtf ALF by bbolss to 1min system using mtf ALF by bbolss it is hard to call it scalping when we can sometimes catch 100pips move like yesturday =]

--- 帖子 #407 ---
I once tried to program something useful, but the program eventually went rogue on me and laughed in my face... lol I can't program also!! Can anyone on this forum program an EA to provide signals based on post #1?

--- 帖子 #408 ---
Hi, the AlF is a great tool for trading. For those interested in timing add the Bressert indicator. It helps with working out which movments are more likely to be successful. Also worth adding the MTF indicator for one period higher. Allows better indication of the important moves. I have attached both indicators and an image for those interested I use a 40 ema on the screen as it mirrors the bottom Alf indicator. Useful to judge if a pull back or a reversal rgds Peter

--- 帖子 #409 ---
What are the dots above the candles

--- 帖子 #410 ---
Ema cross over rgds Peter

--- 帖子 #411 ---
Hi folks my first 11 pips. What do you think i have to do with my indicators? BBolss thank you for this incredible system. Regards to all.

--- 帖子 #412 ---
hey Matija, Looking good!! How long have you been trading for? I noticed you are over leveraging a bit. Not a wise idea on areal account if you are starting out. Other then that, good job =)

--- 帖子 #413 ---
Hi all, I am trying to download this wonderful system, but instead of downloading the file I get "atachment.php" Why? I wish I could test the system. Thanks and sorry for my English

--- 帖子 #414 ---
change browser or rename to whathever.zip

--- 帖子 #415 ---
realy good entry! half +10 half +70 im out now i think that it cant fall any longer ;p

--- 帖子 #416 ---
look on top of ratings on this same window u will locate the attachments,click on it and download from there,that .php will not appear

--- 帖子 #417 ---
bbolss, Did you add another indicator?

--- 帖子 #418 ---
no its indi for 1h not part of this system

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Missed all that. But got my 52 pips (on EJ) soon after on the next drop during the Ldn / NY overlap. I try to just use ALF &amp; MTF set for next higher 1 or 2 periods. And a bit of PA I suppose, like "thats retested that level &amp; failed so going this other way". Or sweet spot coming close - WAIT. Also have sessions on mainly M5 &amp; M15 screen. Would like to get ea sorted to follow a few of what I think are rules. Even if it doesnt get all the trades. Im sure it would be close if not more than I am getting at the mo. Noticed the three failing highs then a good drop shows a lot across pairs. Havent noticed opposite as much. Bit harder to see 3 failed lows then a good tradable rise in the current markets. cheers scalpz

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Hi bbolss. Do you wait m1 Osma go below zero?

--- 帖子 #421 ---
for 1st entry wben macd is changing not always but usually for reentry when trend is going yes macd should cross 0

--- 帖子 #422 ---
hi, just wanted to drop by to say thanks! for a great system. i had good fun today on EU. what other pairs are you watching?

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Hi bbolss Been trialing out this system, getting to grips with it now and seems very good ;-) I just tried using the my_sell script to open a trade. For some reason the script kept opening one trade after the next, I turned off Expert Advisors but it had already opened 4 trades by then! My own fault for not testing it in demo first. Do you know what might be causing this mate? I would also rather manage my orders/positions with scripts as well. Cheers Mark

--- 帖子 #424 ---
+45 enter at break of dialy everything else ok exit at alf touch when osma quick go bellow 0 and osma 5min start to fall..

--- 帖子 #425 ---
I guess to close to support ?

--- 帖子 #426 ---
looks like i wold take short here only after break this level besaid this was against the trend ;p and your sl should be at last high i think no sl will kill you! always! ;p

--- 帖子 #427 ---
USDCHF is also good rgds Peter

--- 帖子 #428 ---
Thanks BB, still still trying to become consistant in scalping

--- 帖子 #429 ---
this is a nice indicator. thanks for the sharing. I just wandering, anyone tried it before with other pairs beside EU? is it also worked well?

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Hello, yes im looking at charts for four years, i ve been testisting forex robots (commercial), but none of this craps doesnt work on real account. On demo maybe somtimes , but in time all fale. waist of time and money most money. Now i doscover this site and this incredible system all thanks to bbolss. I have to learn alot. Now i have to manege sl and tp i think i do with 1 bbolss post. As i see 10 pips for sl it is great. Yes i know that my laverage is to high. On commercial forex robots it was 0.1 lot for 1000 eur / dolar. I have to test this system. If you have any suggestion please write it. I dont know what books i have to read to learn more about forex indicator or some internet sites. Thanks to all Best regards

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Just got 5 pips after breaking daily high with this system - very nice but with more patience it could have been 15 pips

--- 帖子 #432 ---
Here's a suggestion I just thought about, its something that I've added to the template being used currently. I've added PivotsDWM to provide the pivot points for the day, these important levels help provide support/resistance levels where price may respect or try to pass. If price action is too close to a pivot point, I would usually wait to see if there is a candle close above/below these particular levels. Then enter a position according to the rules of the system. Something interesting to keep in mind, if I see multiple attempts to pass a pivot point, but it fails to do so, i will usually try to enter in the opposite direction. I've attached an image that explains what I'm talking about, let me know if you have any questions regarding it.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Still in demo or did you enter in real account ? Until now, nobody offer to build an EA out of this ? We could backtest and perform the strategy !

--- 帖子 #434 ---
im on real now but on 0.1 / 0.2 lot max;p still lerning;] nope no ea for now ;/

--- 帖子 #435 ---
I'm trading this on a real account also, but I'm trading really small. I've noticed I take things seriously while trading on a real account. I'm also working on my trading psychology, trying to become discipline, sticking by my system and such.

--- 帖子 #436 ---
Hi to all, i'm member of elite section on trading system forex and i asked funyoo to code it here u are today will finish optimization since 1st april, will post set file thx to bbloss for great strategy but seems difficult to get same results w ea

--- 帖子 #437 ---
Wow!! This is really great, I appreciate this indeed. I will look into it and test it. By the way, is there any chance to create an alert system that only alerts to possible trades? A system that only alerts to a possible trade, not an EA that takes the trade? Thanks again!

--- 帖子 #438 ---
BBOLSS. Reading thru your thread, a man needs to do something on a rainy Sunday in Mexico. Congratulating you on a nice system and a LOT of patience you seem to have, as I have seen SOOOO many dumb questions about loading indicators and/or a TPL, that I wonder if these ppl EVER took the instruction classes of their broker. Trading my own system, but it seems to me that using the ALF in whatever configuration can give experienced traders an edge in taking the better trades. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!

--- 帖子 #439 ---
There is no such thing as a stupid question, this is a forum where people can help each other out. Please think twice before posting something like that, it doesn't help and will most likely prevent a beginner from posting a question now.

--- 帖子 #440 ---
then there must be many questions posed by stupid people. That Freddy congratulates the OP on his patience in answering them is not a reason to critisise him, as anyone who sees the continual questions about how to load indicators must wonder whether people with such a scant level of knowledge of MT4 should be encouraged to trade. On balance, I doubt whether such people will be deterred from asking questions. Freddy, I'm with the Oranje this week, as ever. My father was involved as a doodlesacspieler in the liberation of Vught and we still have family friends there, although a diminishing number unfortunately. Good luck. Bal

--- 帖子 #441 ---
If you used your brain cells, you would understand that all freddy was pointing to is what we all get frustrated with. What is PA ? What is a candlestick ? How do I use MT4. And since your clever enough to know that this is a forum, I am sure your also aware. That this forum has a place for beginners, A place for programming ect.ect. LEARN HOW TO USE A FORUM

--- 帖子 #442 ---
"then there must be many questions posed by stupid people" The exact kind of mentality that I was asking Freddyfx to not talk about. Ukcool, my brain cells are working just fine. You however may want to repeat High school, talking in all caps isn't the best way to express yourself in any language. P.S. I wasn't trying to insult Freddyfx, I was however trying to provide a better and much more positive environment for people who have any type of question.

--- 帖子 #443 ---
Trying this system on EURCAD. Seems to work good so far. It has been going down for a while now though. Could you tell me if I'm understanding this system properly? proper entry, proper exit? Thanks Brady

--- 帖子 #444 ---
for stepping into the shoes of the thread starter and setting yourself up as the moral guardian of the thread. In doing so you may manage to start the process by which this thread breaks down. If you'd left well alone, Freddy's comment may have simply been acknowledged privately by those in agreement and ignored by those who disagreed. To jump down the throat of posters with vouches may not be the best way of convincing the forum users that your views have merit.

--- 帖子 #445 ---
This thread was a nice, civilised and focussed place to be. I think we should try and keep it that way

--- 帖子 #446 ---
He started it!

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Great Effort! However I think since a lot in this system is up to the trader, I'm not sure an EA would work. I wish I was wrong of course. I mean how do you tell a computer values like "not strong rise"? Also, what is the exit strategy for the EA?

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Hello, started to try this system today. After few looses (due to my misunderstandings) , got first small win. Entered on close where red vertical line.

--- 帖子 #449 ---
right! 1st backtest using osma and macd didn't give good result, now backtesting only w osma filter. if someone could help to backtest and how to filter i can ask to modify it

--- 帖子 #450 ---
Nice work done. I want give a try from today. Let's see how much pips i can grab with this EA. regards

--- 帖子 #451 ---
I realized that this system is usable in trendy periods, but on flat periods(like today) better stay away. Am I right ?

--- 帖子 #452 ---
i knew that toooday will be flat so i did not trade live but in day like this i think we just need smaler tp see today charts every entry expect 2 - one marked and one that i forgot to mark here;p was worth at least +5...

--- 帖子 #453 ---
This method rocks. I have been using it for a few days taking M1 scalps following ALF M1 and ALF M5 combined with PA, S+R levels, and... patience and discipline. There have been heaps of opportunities during London and NY sessions yielding 5-10 pips per trade. Thanks mate!

--- 帖子 #454 ---
you entered when candlle closes, that marked with green line, right ?

--- 帖子 #455 ---
Any luck with the EA? Thanks.

--- 帖子 #456 ---
Once a trade is at +10, I close half the trade, i typically move sl to breakeven but im wondering if i should just keep it where it usually is at, what is everyone else doing?

--- 帖子 #457 ---
Nice 20 pip trade.

--- 帖子 #458 ---
I generally close between 1/3 and 1/2 ( depends where I set my stop loss) at 10 and move stop loss to plus 1. Scalping is not trend trading and generally I will have closed the trade if it pulls back close to 10 pips rgds Peter

--- 帖子 #459 ---
I don't know why this EA is not putting any trade. I try today this EA in M1 and M5 but still notrade place. Give some idea about this EA if any one using it.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Yesterday was a bank holiday in the US, a long weekend and I would expect it to be relatively quiet till tuesday US opening (which is about now). Long holiday weekends are always hard, some times you have major swings but without volume, sometimes there's no movement at all.

--- 帖子 #461 ---
Playing with exit's a little. I am using the standard fibo expansion and retracement from the mt4 platform and somehow that works fine. Using a fixed target of let's say 10pip will be ok in trending markets where you can easily get back in a new trade. But you'll be hitt for more pips in range markets. Entries using this strategy are easy, exit's need a little more thought. We will come there...

--- 帖子 #462 ---
This is definitely a logical approach and is a sound trading approach. My technique is to shoot for a minimum of 1:1. Usually, if you put your stop .5-1 pip below the most recent swing high or low, the move up will give you your stop + spread. In low volume markets, the stops might only be 4-7 pips. In explosive markets, 10-15 pips. It matters not as you can usually expect to get the same - if it moves your way - as your risk. As you say, shooting for a strict 10 pip target makes no logical sense because it assumes every day's trading conditions will be identicle, which we all know is not the case.

--- 帖子 #463 ---
First 2 trades hit TP today with this ALF EA. I have it on the GU M1 chart. Also have ALF indi &amp; ALF-MTF (set to 5min) on the chart to see when price is passing through both. All other indi's turned off in the ea, just want to start with ALFs cause thats what I have been using manually on the EU M15/M5. EA doesnt need ALF-MTF indi, just ALF indi showing in your Navigator Custom Indicators list. cheers scalps

--- 帖子 #464 ---
Ok here's a dumb question. I've been trading for many years but never used an EA. Where do I put the file and how do I use it? Thanks, Max

--- 帖子 #465 ---
I was able to attach the EA to the chart but the little smiley face is "sad". Do I need to change a setting for a 5 digit broker?

--- 帖子 #466 ---
Interesting... I've found this to be true as well, the market is constantly changing, and you must change with the market. Good job.

--- 帖子 #467 ---
Make sure experts are enabled and live trading is allowed.

--- 帖子 #468 ---
Be careful, guys !!! If working EAs existed, the banks could send all those thousands of screen watchers home..............but they are not doing that for a good reason. In my whole career as a forex trader I have seen many robots, .................none EVER deliver what ppl expect from them. Still programmers exist that think they can outsmart market sentiment of the human being. Just my 2 cents.................after Holland sent Uruguay home.

--- 帖子 #469 ---
I will agree with you. EAs are generally not profitable. Doesn't stop people from using them, however.

--- 帖子 #470 ---
ea will never understand PA period;] if there would be ea that make money every day/month everybody would have it right!? no mather what cost so i dont belive in it..

--- 帖子 #471 ---
PLUS another important matter to be aware of: Brokers use different data feed, to be clear, what you experience in a demo, will NOT be the same as in a live acct. Simply notice that the servers are not the same My advise is to use them on demo and simply copy to your live. If you pay proper attention you might only miss a pip or 2, but an EA will not eat your account while you are away.

--- 帖子 #472 ---
Congratulations! Can they win their first ever WC?

--- 帖子 #473 ---
Can someone tell me when they manually close a trade that is going against them? I was thinking, if a trade is already going against me and there is a candle close above/below the M5 line, then it would be a good idea to close the trade manually instead of having the SL hit for -10 pips. What is everyone else doing? When would you close a trade manually?

Hi bbolss, If you use a 5min alf mtf on a 1 min chart then the alf mtf is not correcting itself for the last 1min bar. The slope of the mtf is a little odd, when you update the indy by clicking on it, it will turn to it's normal slope. Has someone else seen this and if so, does anyone know how to adjust the code in a way that the alf mtf will refresh automatically at the end of the 5th 1min bar? Thanks pbb

--- 帖子 #476 ---
I think you got your posts the wrong way round.

--- 帖子 #477 ---
Thanks for the EA ninichingyi, I was just wondering how we can optimize the EA so it will open trades more frequently. I changed the min lot size to 0.1 as my broker only permits that size and that's it. In 24 hours, it's opened 1 trade for a 10 pip move, running on 8 charts, each with a diff. magic number. I have MM on and set at 5.0 risk. Just wondering how I can get it to open more trades more frequently. Thanks for any inputs!

--- 帖子 #478 ---
I have no idea what you mean, im looking for an answer and not a riddle.

--- 帖子 #479 ---
due to pc shutdown now i restart optimization, anyway first backtest on last 3months didn't show good results w default settings, now i'm backtesting w macd filters and ma filters disabled. on backtest it trades more but i suggest to find w backtest settings that can fit ur risk and then test it in fwd demo. u cannot trust on backtest only

--- 帖子 #480 ---
Ok thanks for the info. I'm not a big fan of backtesting, it proves nothing of what the current market conditions are so the results are somewhat bogus. Though I suppose they give you a general idea. I'll give 'er a shot, thanks again. Also, I've been trying without much success to get this system to work for me. Can anyone out there, PLEASE hook us up with some sort of indicator to suggest an entry point with this system? Something like a big BUY when it's time to buy, or SELL when it's time to sell the pair?!? Would make everyone's life a tad easier. Well, make my life easier anyhow! Is it even possible or is what I'm asking for completely off the wall? Thanks everyone! Happy trading!

--- 帖子 #481 ---
Well my plan is to have the SL sorted before I take the trade. Part of working out if the risk is worth it or not. Then if it hits the SL then it closes. Next. Holding longer is not only risking more, it is wasting other opportunities. Well thats the plan anyway, but sometimes the rails shift &amp; I fall off. It's normally when I let other factors outside my plan influence my trades - and then guess what happens. cheers scalpz

--- 帖子 #482 ---
I do the exact same (including shifting rails ): Usually aiming for 10 pips TP/SL. If it is a good run and goes above +10 swiftly, I let it run and judge on possible reconnection with ALF, but if it gets back to +10 pips I close the trade anyway. The saying goes: Don't let your winners turn into losers.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Again, same comment as for the EA: How do you tell a computer rather vague values like "not strong rise"? My recommendation is try it (on demo if you like or with the smallest lots). Practice is the way to go.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
I had a look to the code of the EA, it is very hard that it work since one of the indicator is mtf, the code does not handle it, and less for backtest, Also, one of the condition is related to the state of the line of this indicator; this EA does not handle this part at all. forgetting that the all fundamental of this strategy ! The EA end up being another indicator-value-crossing...

--- 帖子 #485 ---
Can you fix a code?

--- 帖子 #486 ---
good entry sl at +7 for now (about dialy) and will se i thing will fall like 50pips or more;] i waited at break this yellow line and enter at candle marked green line edit im already out with +18 we broken so many tl on my m5;p last one hold shame ;D

--- 帖子 #487 ---
Hi bbolls, Could you share your latest template/indys with us? Wondering about your pivot and ma indicators (dotted yellow and green line). You're not as active on your thread as in the beginning, summertime started in Poland? Thanks pbb

Since you're from poland, what are your trading times. Do you watch all day (europe and opening us) or just some periods around the opening? Thanks pbb

hi yep sumertime and exams on my studdy so much on my head;] last temp is still in 1st post i just added now auto pivot here you go and i changed for test now longer osma to 50 120 40 seems to be a litle faster and still show what is on m5 strange that there is no MTF version of osma i serached it over last weekend with no results ;/ anout my poland work time hmmm when i woke up (about 8 am) i start usually london open ad 9 my time then i usually make a break about 12 - 14 ( usually nothing happend) and from 14 till 17-19 depends on a day are you from poland too? br

--- 帖子 #490 ---
No, I am from Holland, so same timezone. My morning session is from around7 till 11 and mostly I don't trade the afternoon, but if I do it's from pre opening till around 16.30. The dotted yellow and green line in the chart, are they just moving averages? What setting do you use for them? Thanks pbb

--- 帖子 #491 ---
yep 50 and 200 they are in 1st post temp?

--- 帖子 #492 ---
I'm currently forward testing this EA, turned off the MACD and MA filters and added a stop loss of 10. I also reduced the number of open trades/chart as it was openning up a bunch of trades at the same price. After letting it run for 8 hours, I'm +$1,180.00. For anyone interested, here's my statements. http://windsorftw2.mt4stats.com/

--- 帖子 #493 ---
Yes, you are right. At the ALF crossing point there should not be an order placed unless the 5 minute ALF is going in the same direction as the 1 minute ALF. The code does not account for this as far as I can see. I'm just starting to learn how to code, so I would not have a clue on how to code these conditions into the order coding.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
Is it possible for someone to correct this code?

--- 帖子 #495 ---
hi bbolss, first of all thanks for the system. I have been trading it for about a week with some success. Have developed a couple of indies for this particular system - OSMA for 2 tf and MACD for 2 tf. May be it's what you are looking for. Unfortunately get connection error when trying to attach files to the post. So if you want them, drop me a PM and i'll send them by email.

thanx to uset JUSTME we have now a realy nice indi showing osma and macd from 2 tf on one window here how it looks on my 5m chart on m1 also look great ! its realy nice becouse on the web i was unable to find any mtf osma and this long term osma was not realy mtf it was just close to it all 3 files must be in indi folder thanx justme again! bdw 500 reply in this thread;]

--- 帖子 #502 ---
hey bbolss, I want your opinion on an indicator, I've been using a scalping indicator that really helps to determine entries and exits. Take a look at the image i uploaded, the indicators seems to grab about 80-90% of the trade. What do you think? I've attached the indicator if anyone wants to try it out.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
hmm it definitly look nice ! i must check it live thanx! no repainting etc? where did you find it? here is modded version by me with disabled alerts - deafoult alerts was on with no posibility to change it... i have exam on monday but on thu will check it

--- 帖子 #504 ---
Forex Trend indi is worthless. It repaints several bars. When indis look great it is because they repaint.

--- 帖子 #505 ---
As far as I've noticed it doesn't repaint, i could be wrong! but please do test it on a demo first if you want. I found it while using another system, somewhere on ff. I will also test it a bit and let you know what I found.

--- 帖子 #506 ---
yeah, I've noticed that. Nothing in Forex is ever too good to be true, if it looks perfect or close to it, it usually isn't. I will test it and let you know

--- 帖子 #507 ---
Set Forex Trend to inputs-period to 5. Backtest on 5 min frame and buy and sell on close of candle everytime it changes color. It never loses.

--- 帖子 #508 ---
Forex Trend repaints like crazy mate, I remember using it a year back.

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Given that your previous post stated that the Forex Trend indicator was worthless, is this latest comment "tongue in cheek"? Or did you suddenly discover the holy grail?

--- 帖子 #510 ---
lol Well, actually, I was explaining one way to test if an indicator repaints without the market being open.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
hey cjd, yeah, your absolutely right, it looks to repaint about 3 bars. oh well, scratch that idea.

I was just thinking about alf alert, it looks like alf alert watches alf line on whatever timeframe you have the chart set to, after I enter a trade and close 1/2 of the trade after +10 pips, i will switch tf to M5, and have alf alert me to when the line is crossed for a possible exit signal. This can be useful for anyone who doesn't want to watch the trade all day.

--- 帖子 #515 ---
If you take the break on the first bar above or below alf with ss agreement, you usually can pull some pips.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
These two checked trades today.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
What is ss agreement?

--- 帖子 #518 ---
The macd and the osma are just making my eyes and brain hurt. going back to just pure pa with the 2 alfs

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Exactly! The indicator was making me crazy. I love the ALF indicators. I’m just using those with Heikin-Ashi bars instead of regular candles. Some people say they’re lagging. Maybe so but maybe that helps keep me out of bad trades.

--- 帖子 #520 ---
bbolss, I was wondering how you know when to close some of your position and let the rest run until price action hits alf M5 line? Do you automatically just do this with every trade, or is there something in particular you look for?

--- 帖子 #521 ---
attached new version , this one should take care of alf mtf and trade when alf and alf mtf went to same direction

--- 帖子 #522 ---
Thanks for the update, ninichingyi. Quick question about the EA, I can't seem to get the stop loss to work. Bad trades will go -30 or more pips before I close them manually...any ideas? PS, I can't download it, when I click the attachment it saves as 'attachment.php' Thanks!

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Download from the paperclip icon at the top right side of page.

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Well if its working who cares??? Us the Heikin-Ashi i say. My problem is when is the best time to trade this system? Living in CA makes it so hard and the idea of an EA does not seem to be in the future.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
why my alf-mtf looks like this? simple alf also?

--- 帖子 #526 ---
So your just trading the break above or below? I like simple.. hate to think and look at 5 other things on a one or five min chart. its too fast for that crap.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Your ALF line looks fine to me. Try your CandleWidth setting down to 3 for your TVI Candles indicator. Do Ctrl-I &amp; double click the TVI Candles indy (if loaded). cheers scalpz Ah - maybe on the MTF, set the TimeFrame from 0 to 15 or 60 or whats a day, umm 1440.

--- 帖子 #528 ---
In the template that is being used by many on this forum, everyone else is using alf_mtf on M5. So timeframe = 5 Try this, let me know if that solved your problem.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Hey everyone, check this out, I've been playing with the template a bit and I found that mtf schaff indicator M5 is working really well to determine entry and exit, if schaff is equal or less then 90, look to go short. If schaff is equal or great then 10, look to go long only. As far as I can tell, this doesnt repaint.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
Thx that help me

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Do we have to have indicators on chart for this to work ?

--- 帖子 #532 ---
it just work it is not perfect but do not repaints ! sometimes just change direction like here but that is good you known to exit fast it just folow the price with his own way bdw anyone took this +50?

--- 帖子 #533 ---
Hi bbolss, is this the latest template you are using? or it is just a test. Can you update post # 1 if you are using something new? I have been using the old version, and so far so good. However, it is nice to try new things.. :^ Thank you!!! bcarbon

--- 帖子 #534 ---
i use diffrent temp almoust everyday also like test and serarch for best thinks 1st post will be updated mayby during weekend basic is the same just change osma and macd to http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3864190 this and thats it

--- 帖子 #535 ---
In Post 532 window 3 you incorporated SchaffTrend indi with osma. It looks very nice. That indicator is awesome!!

--- 帖子 #536 ---
jusl load 2tf osma from that 331 post and then drag and drop to this window SchaffTrend no magic here

--- 帖子 #537 ---
You are wrong. There is lots of magic here!!

--- 帖子 #538 ---
bboloss, I've been using MTF Schaff Trend to determine the trend and filter a few things. Take a look at the image I uploaded... 1. Schaff has crossed above 10, I'm looking to only go long. From here to 4 its a +100 pips. 2. This area would have been a good long according to the original template rules, from here to 3 at pivot point or 4 reversal of schaff, its about 60-70 pips. 3. Daily R2, A possible TP. 4. Reversal of Schaff trend is a good exit signal.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
Do you mean post 501?

--- 帖子 #540 ---
exackly sory my mistake ;p i loged ad my post stats ;p was Member Since Mar 2010 332 Posts lol wrong number ;d br

--- 帖子 #541 ---
hi Eurisko please share ur template and indi! it looks nice : ) thx

--- 帖子 #542 ---
while use "5" in the timeframe setting in 1min chart, it does repaint for the last 5 bars, cause when the last minute of a 5min is not the same direction of the first min of the same 5 min, it will change back or say "correct" the change of the first min. But of cause, it does not repaint at the current tf. So, i think maybe use 10,115,250 and "current time frame" while we use it in the 1min chart and want to see the five min STC. But while I used it by this way, it looks not the same and it is not as useful as while we use default ema and use "5" for the time frame setting. Welcome all advices on how to use of this ind. And thanks to you for bring this good ind to us.

--- 帖子 #543 ---
I like this mtf schaff indicator...is there anyone who could add an alert to it when it crosses the 90/10 or 70/30?

--- 帖子 #544 ---
Hey zmskyj, Thanks for your suggestion. I was looking at it, but if you look at image I uploaded it seems like having a 10,115,250 on the current timeframe gives too many false signals. There are times when it looks good, and it provides a good signal, but overall it seems to not be as accurate as my original settings. I think overall, schaff isnt always going to give a perfect enter and exit signal. Keep in mind, it does change direction, I think I understand what your talking about when you say it repaints on M5, that is why I wait for a candle close once it has crossed either the 10 or 90 levels to confirm reversal. I'm still playing with the settings, I would like some additional opinions regarding the schaff indicator.

--- 帖子 #545 ---
I'm still currently playing with the template and all the settings, if anyone would like to use schaff, please refer to post #529 It would be nice if someone could add an alert system to the indicator, a popup and email alert. This indicator has shown to grab +100 pips, I don't want to sit at my laptop the entire time ...haha

--- 帖子 #546 ---
I've recently had a lot of questions regarding my template, so I decided to just simply share it, let some other people have fun with it. This is the template I'm currently using, I'm still playing with it, its not my final version. Please don't use this on a real account, demo it first, if anyone has any suggestions please feel free to ask or share. My Changes 1. I've added another mtf_alf to address the price spikes, I've seen it be very useful when used with the other mtf_alf M5 2. I removed the moving averages 3. Added pivot points indicator I would really appreciate your opinion regarding this template bbolss. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
Hi eurisko, thanks for posting your template. Are you able to post a quick bit on the capabilities of the Visual Order Editor ea included. Do you only use the MTF ALFs, not a smooth normal ALF ? I like the Schaff indy, will have a look at adding an alert. No garantees thou. My coding is normally cut &amp; paste with a little bit of added code into somebody elses hard work. Slowly getting better. When I get my tpl sorted with a Schaff indy, will post that also. cheers scalpz

--- 帖子 #548 ---
thanks eurisko for your reply. Like what you said, use ema 115,250 instead of set time frame "5" in the schaff ind is not a better choice. So, you mean you watch the 5min schaff in 1min chart, and wait while current 5min finish(like the end of the 4,9,14,19,24,29,34,39,44,49,54,59 minute)then if at this time, schaff does cross over 10 or cross down through 90, then you buy or sell? I think that is the only correct way to use it if someone want to use this ind as a buy or sell ind. And of couse, the result will not as good as it shows in the history data. I just wondering if we can have a schaff trend TF ind which can show all the changes in every minute and does not correct the last 5 bars in each 5min cycle time. I don't care if we reopen the mt4 then we lost all the history of changes. At least if we don't close mt4, it will not change automatically and we can forward test it. If you don't understand what I mean, please take a look at the two pic I attached. It is another tf indicator, I also plot 5min in a 1min chart. The first pic is a realtime one, you see the "serrates", and the second is the one you get if you close and reopen the mt4. It is smooth and you will find for each 5min cycle time, the value of the indicator is the same, because it only use the value the indicator got at the last minute of each 5min cycle time. Which is the same as what we got now from this tf schaff ind. I just wish if we can have a tf schaff ind that can show us the same pic as the first pic I gave. Any one who wants to add aler to SchaffTrendCyclemtf.mq4 can check this thread out http://www.forexfactory.com/showthread.php?t=121882

--- 帖子 #549 ---
im now working on something else bdw but look ok just change the long and short osma to this http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost.php?p=3864190 this is true mtf osma and this one that you use and that is in my 1st post isnt exackly mtf it is long and it show almoust the 5min osma but only almoust;p truly 5m osma give almoust always good signals check it out

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Check out the image I uploaded, in the image the red line is the regular alf line, the purple line is the mtf alf I use, blue line is the regular mtf alf M5 line. If price action is above/below the purple line, its also above/below the red line. I just personally like my version, it reacts to price action a bit better, when both mtf alf lines agree upon trend direction, I look to osma and macd for confirmation. Regarding Visual Order Editor, check out the image I uploaded. You can change the values to match what you want. Here is how I'm using visual order editor, I trade using my template during London and NY, I also trade the news. So i made another copy of the ea, renamed visual order editor to visual order editor_news, Metatrader recognizes visual order editor_news as a different ea with different settings, I made a template and loaded my newly renamed ea into the template and load the template whenever I need to trade news. Visual order editor_news has my own customized settings according to my strategy for trading news, whenever I open a trade, I have visual order editor_news manage the trade. So basically, I make another copy of the ea, rename it and change the settings whenever I have a new strategy to test. Let me know if this helped, if you have any other questions.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
hey bbolss, could you share your template with the new osma, I would to see what your settings are for osma and macd.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
here is last i used ;]

--- 帖子 #553 ---
thanks bbolss, I didn't realize you changed indicators. I'm going to check this out after I get some much needed rest.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Thanks for the Visual Order Editor info eurisko. I have had a go at adding the alert to Schaff TC. Have it currently set at 10 &amp; 90 for alert, maybe alter to entries later. No market open at the mo, but got alert to trigger by adding to H1 EU chart then changing to M15. Will see how it behaves when market opens. Hope it doesnt keep alerting, cause I like to think I have that bit covered. @ zmskyj, thanks for that thread, it had an older SchaffTC version, but the alert files are ex4's so I had to start from our current mq4 version. Noticed I had to add 10&amp;90 levels to the Schaff indy when loading to get the lines. Anybody know how to have that done within the indy? Have fun everybody. cheers scalpz

--- 帖子 #555 ---
Hi Bbolss! Could you explain how you read your new indies? How you make a decision to enter and exit? Maybe, you can update 1st post? (rules and pictures) Thank you in advance.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
same as in 1st post macd show exaclky the same think just have new look osma short is also the same and osma long is changed to mtf osma so enter like always both alf crossed osma signal and macd like in 1st post just schaff is new but i try to use it only fot exit for now like eurisko showed;]

--- 帖子 #557 ---
Hi Eurisko, This looks very promising. I like the Shaff indicator a lot. It seems very accurate. My question is, if Visual Order Editor is an ea, (to my understanding eas trade automatically you just give them your parameters according to your trading comfort zone), then why do you need the indicators in the windows below the PA window? (Osma, MACD. etc.) Regards, bcarbon

--- 帖子 #558 ---
hey bcarbon, Most Ea's are designed to trade automatically, most of which fail to show any profit. Visual Order Editor is absolutely an EA, however it doesn't automatically open and close trades for me. I manually open trades and let visual order editor helps me to manage my trade. For example, If i set my stop loss to 15 pips, and target profit to 40-50 pips within visual order editor, that means once I open a trade and don't specify those variable just yet, visual order editor will immediately correct my trade to the specified variables I previously wanted. Whenever you open a trade, you will see horizontal lines on the pairs chart that specify your particular variables, you can easily select those horizontal lines and move them up or down and change those particular values. Visual Order Editor provides a point and click interface, which can become very useful no matter which strategy you use. Let me know if you have any other questions.

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Thank you so much for your answer. I agree with you about the eas, you have to risk 300 pips in order to get 5 or 10. Very risky non-sense strategy. I have tried few of them and am not convinced yet. Do you have any statistics so far? I will put it on the strategy tester of my platform. I will be testing this week. Regards, bcarbon

--- 帖子 #560 ---
My statistics are based off my own manual trading, remember visual order editor doesn't trade for me, it only manages a few certain things. I'm winning about 70-80% of the time with a win:lose ratio of 2:1 - 3:1

--- 帖子 #561 ---
Anyone testing this EA or was this a dead end.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
hey scalpz, I've been using your version of schaff with the popup alert on it, its working well for me, thanks again. Is there any chance you could add an email alert system also? An email system can be very useful, even on the M1 chart. I use Thunderbird (email client) to check my email account every 1 minute for new emails, if a new email is present, an alarm goes off. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Hello , still trying to understand the schaff indicator. what about the area inbetween the 10 or 90, for example: If i am looking to go long, do i wait for the line to cross above 90 or can i enter if it crosses above 10 ? Thanks in advance.

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Hi eurisko, I havent been able to get my own IBFX terminal to send me emails, let alone an ea or indy to do that. LOL. Suspect it is the terminal settings to do with getting into a hotmail email account. All became TFH. If you have any good settings, screenshot would be great. Would pay to alter your account info a bit though. Hi traco1, Schaff Trend Cycle is quite an old indy apparently. Do a check on some other forum sites. I spotted a pdf file but it has commercial type pieces added, so I wont post in FF. Not doing their advertising for them. cheers scalpz

--- 帖子 #565 ---
bbolss I am going back to basics. IBFX went from four digits to five and everything is a mess. I deleted everything and are working with template v2 plus a stochastics window (that was in the first template) with the Schaff indicator with two settings. So far so good but took me sometime to make my platform work again. . Hope you did wonderful in your exams. Regards, bcarbon

--- 帖子 #566 ---
hey traco1, You are only looking to short once schaff has crossed the 90 level and is moving down, only go long once schaff has crossed the 10 level and is moving up.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
I was thinking while feeding the cat, so did some digging &amp; had a play at adding email alert. Found out its bloody hard to get a miss written alert off your chart before it alerts you again &amp; again &amp; again... Have to be quick, &amp; just keep trying. Turning the volume down down down helps the mind work. What a laugh. Now sorted that little repeating bit. Anyways have a go at this. I only really tested the PopupAlerts as I've never been able to work an email alert manually. Please let me know if it needs some more tweaks. cheers scalpz

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Hi Eurisko, Can you please tell MTF ALF settings that you are using? (purple line) Many thanks. Regards, Target

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Thanks

--- 帖子 #570 ---
hello thread ppl. i have been trying out your system/strat and all looks good so far. I see that the original strat was changed and then changed back a bit. Is this because the new filters were worse than the original or about the same with no major difference between the trades that they approved of?

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Hi guys, did you test http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/attach/mq4.gif Forex Trend fxfariz.mq4 , i would like to but have no time. In august i have holidays, then i would test it. It looks very nice. I would like to test on 15 min chart. when i came home in evening it is very nice picture of the day on 15 min chart, but im considering it is work all day same picture(candels) like at the end (evening ) when i came home. If it is then is very good indicator. Bye in near future

My problem also same as you. Did you manage to work the EA with 5 digit broker?

--- 帖子 #580 ---
Its working nice with alpari.uk which is 5D. but i am working with FXDD also 5D in demo today but from aug its becoming 5D real acc. I tried in demo in FXDD its still not working but only show the lines on the EA chart.

Hi, It was very troublesome to change the "TimeFrame" to next higher timeframe when you are in different TF using the ALF_MTF. So created this Automatic ALF_NTF. This means when i am in M5, ALF_NTF will shown M15 ALF. Hope it useful to you

--- 帖子 #582 ---
Hi, Found out this bug in this ALF and related indicators that bother me when try to change the color setting to my like. When you insert the ALF.ex4, ALF_MTF.ex4, ALF_Alert.e4 or the similar AdaptiveLaguerreFilter.ex4. You may face the problem of the indicator don't shown up, but when you use the author's template, it is OK. I believe lot of complain about this in the beginning of the post. When you faced this problem, save the template, and edit the template using text editor. search to the following portion: .... &lt;indicator&gt; name=Custom Indicator &lt;expert&gt; name=ALF flags=19 window_num=0 ..... change the flags= 19 to value 256 or higher and then save it. load the template and the ALF will shown.

Hello, i try to find the indic Schaff Trend Cycle but not the MTF one. Eurisko do you have the original STC. The one use to make the MTF one plz ? Thanx

Hi I have been having problems with this alert - it seems to put the arrows on the screen OK, but the pop up window &amp; email part of it only seems to work several times then stops, until I close &amp; re open the platform, any suggestions has anyone else had this problem? It would be great if this problem could be rectified as I do like this indicator, I am using conventional candles, could this be the problem? by the way I use it on the 15min charts. Regards, Drew....

Did you manage stoploss i prefer 20 pips. Today it works Ea for me OK on demo account. If you have new results please post it. For me it trade 8 trade all wins 10 pips a trade 0,05 lot . But yesturday when i instal EA it have only one loss trade 40 pips with 0,1 lot. Dont know whay not trade the same lot. Thanks for all explenations guys. See you soon. http://cdn.forexfactory.com/images/icons/icon12.gif

--- 帖子 #589 ---
I think you can help me more than I can help you. The EA was working wonderfully. Just minutes after installing it, it started trading and all the trades were winners as I posted previously. However, Fxdd changed from four digits to five digits and that was the end of it. The Ea has not trade at all for me this week. Very frustrating, not with the EA but the broker . I agree with you about the stop loss, it is to big. Take a look at your winning trades and see how deep each trade went against you before becoming a winner. I thing averaging those figures could give you a better number for a more reasonable SL. I will keep trying this coming week again and will post my results. Regards, bcarbon.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
The EA also stopped functioning here. I think FXDD does not have their stuff in order, as I noticed that the 5th digit is only switching between 10 points, so like the normally indicated pip. Attacked them on it and of course the response is they will have their tech guys look into this ASAP. Damned brokers, they are ALL the same bottom line.

--- 帖子 #591 ---
im glad that you guys are still using it it is still great system! but for now im trying to play with PA only best big fish are playng PA only right so im trying also with nice results so far regards!

--- 帖子 #592 ---
Is this working on Interbank MT4 right now? Does anyone have installation instructions?

--- 帖子 #593 ---
O so thats why it did not open a trade for me, this EA only works on 4 digit brokers ? How do you make it work for 5 ?

--- 帖子 #594 ---
Maybe why thats why the EA never worked right for me. I'm using alpari Uk and its a 5 dig broker as well.

--- 帖子 #595 ---
may i know which setting r u using. thx

--- 帖子 #596 ---
all backtest i did and fwd test was on 5 digits broker (atcbrokers.com) and ea worked well and it adjust automatically 4/5 digits

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Mine started functioning on 5 dig. as well. Don't know what changed, but it functions, so no worries at the moment.

All settings are default settings. The only thing I did change was ECN to TRUE. Thank you bcarbon

Bcarbon Please share your setting. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
ok i had it on the charts last night and it started working, i changed tp to 5 and sl to 10

--- 帖子 #608 ---
I put it on last night and left it on default and wow to my suprise not one loss till maybe tonight. (I forgot to put in SL thats why no loss's but can one take the draw down in real time)

--- 帖子 #609 ---
Here is what I have been doing with the settings. Money Management to true but it would close trades just on 1 pip draw down so I changed it back to false. Risk=10 but it would open trades in cents so I changed it to 30 ecn=true oppositeclose =true partialclose = true reverse signals= false. This is a work in progress and I want to work on the scalping feature of the EA. I changed maxtrades from 100 to 1 to enhance the scalping. With old setting mostly a winner but did not open many trades that were so obvious. Will keep you posted on how the new settings will do. Have a wonderful weekend everybody.

--- 帖子 #610 ---
I stopped useing it started losing real bad (live account) I will try the new settings next week

--- 帖子 #611 ---
My settings so far are the same but the maxtrades I was at 100 and I've had almost all winners... only a couple of losers.. and still no SL in place I will try changing the 100 maxtrades to 1 and see how it goes. Glad its working for you cause i'm amazed how well its doing

--- 帖子 #612 ---
Attached Image (click to enlarge) This trades are from last night. Pretty good, Every time it opens a trade, it opens two positions. I might start writing a manual soon for personal reference. It would make things easier than starting from zero every time.

--- 帖子 #613 ---
That would be great to write a manual, but when I test I always test on live account EA's behave differently

--- 帖子 #614 ---
[quote=traco1;3951724]That would be great to write a manual, but when I test I always test on live account EA's behave differently[/quote What you are saying is very interesting. Hmmmm. I will presume you have tried both. The questions are, where do they behave better, in real or practice. Have you tried this particular EA in both. And for how long. Regards, bcarbon

--- 帖子 #615 ---
I'm getting winners but i'm still trying to understand how all the settings are working. Looks like its closing 1/2 then 1/2 again.. grrr just take the damn 10 pips

--- 帖子 #616 ---
[quote=bcarbon;3952149] Any time I test an EA it is on a live account only, especially if it does not involve tinkering with to many settings, it is just a personal choice, I have a small live account just for EA's. When I first put the EA on the chart it started to win the first day, the other days were all losers. I will admit that I did not test it every day because I have to work different hours but I still would like to tinker with it because I like the system, maybe its something on my end, Im using Alpari (us) for testing. I would love nothing more than to find a EA to trade while I sit on my A$$ and be profitable but Im still looking, and live account only matters to me.

--- 帖子 #617 ---
had my first loss last night on demo so its not a big deal but it was bad. Now I'm looking at my second loss at it opened a sell and market has moved up. Anyone know if the reversignals option reverses on opposite signals? Some of these options don't seem to do anything like tradesperbar or oppositeclose???

--- 帖子 #618 ---
Last night I had only winners again. Try changing your SL. I also changed from M1 to M5 for the same reason you described. It would open a trade and immediately PA would go the other way. Lets try reversesignals to see what happens, what it does.

--- 帖子 #619 ---
It's not doing anything on my charts. so i put it back to false just like max trades don't seem to do anything but I could be wrong. yes price action does seem to go the other way BUT as long as its taking orders in the direction of the long term trend they always become winners. Ok yes I've had some draw down but its only once so far lost a trade. (big loss) I don't think all the settings here work. I'll post my setting tonight when I'm off work.

Hi, I have been having a go on demo with the ea presented by ninichingyi on the 1 minute I have had not bad results but it seems to take trades a bit hit and miss looking at the rules of this strategy, it misses a lot of good trades and seems to take the ones virtually at the end of a long run before a reversal is in play, has anyone else found this - also I wish to take partial profit and move SL to break even, but it doesn't seem to do it...Is this possible I have looked at the code and there is a lot of settings in there too, regarding turning off at news and times of the day it trades, Etc it would be nice if anyone has a set of instructions to go with this EA.. Great Strategy by the way bbolss, I use alf on the 15 min with stochastic agreement and price action - but i do like to play with EA's.... Drew.

I had winners again last night. It seems to adjusts the leverage itself. Some days my winnings are 2.5 for one position and 5.00 for the second one. Other days it is 25.00 and 50 respectively.

--- 帖子 #622 ---
Hi guys Hi bcarbon I use your setings as you posted on 610 post with risk 10. In two days i have 13 wins 5 pips and two loses, but they are bigger then 10 pips as you see on picture. As i see above, did i have to go on M5 minute chart with EA. Dont understand well above typing - reverse signal, PA. Thanks for explenation. Today i go to real account with 0.01 lot . P.S. Sorry for my english - Have to go to live in AMERICA, yah baby.

--- 帖子 #623 ---
Can you post charts showing where did you enter the trades so that we can see any drawback on the trades specially the winning ones? Perhaps your SL is too big.

--- 帖子 #624 ---
These are the settings I'm currently using. Now I know the stop loss is stupid but its not working anyway as far as I can tell... maybe someone with smaller stop has seen it hit and trade out. I think with oppositedclose set to true it does close out with a loss. Sucks cause every loss I've had so far turned around and went the 4 pips Remember 4 pips at 1.00 is 40 bucks x 2 trades=$80 per trade... My account was -1000 Monday from playing around with other ea's and trading ideas its now -500 so a few days of trading this way with these settings and all my loss's are almost caught up. Again the loss's of this EA never hit my stupid crazy stop and all would have been 100% profit so far. this is my setting on demo so far. And i don't think many of the other setting's even work. But the logic seems to be working and thats most of the battle. Also this ea only takes one direction a time so if your short and its moving against you its going to be a few hours before it moves into profit. To bad it dont not take longs and shorts at the same time to diversify draw downs. Lots 1.0 Oppositeclose True Partialclose false Reversesignals false Maxtrades 100 Tradesperbar 2 (nice feacher) Stoploss 150 a account killer i know Takeproifit 4.0 All entry logics on true

What Stop Loss amount are you using sir?

--- 帖子 #626 ---
Hi, could I ask some one with some programming skills to modify this ALF Alert to show a close over the ALF line. At the moment it seems to need both a open and a close over the ALF line to signal.As a result it is often one bar late for a strategy I am testing Also if possible add an optional EMA cross option Your help would be appreciated. I'm happy to share what I am doing with anyone who could do this. tks Peter

--- 帖子 #627 ---
Yikes it took a while but i blew up my demo. seems this weeks range killed this EA's performance. Ah but range trending always does don't it. Back to drawing board with this. I'm thinking when ranging open up to h1 with the ea on MTF on 240 (hr) and be safe for the week or days of ranging. another idea I'm trying is using the trend following dash board and only letting the ea trade in the direction of the H4 and H1 on these type of days.

Hi, scalpz. SchaffmtfAlerts is very helpful. It is wonderful. However, e-mail is not sent. I use as Emailalerts = on. I am not good at English. There may be impoliteness. thanks.

--- 帖子 #629 ---
hey Everyone!! It's been quite a long time since I last posted something on this forum, I wanted to share an indicator that has been newly designed to help the trading system here. I've attached a modified version of MTF Schaff Trend w/ Alerts, it has popup alerts, email alerts!! and you can set the levels in the input tab. It's been tested already, try it out, let me know what you think. P.S. I want to personally thank scalpz!!

--- 帖子 #630 ---
Hi, eurisko, thank you. I was able to send e-mail. I appreciate very much.

--- 帖子 #631 ---
Very good scalping system Thanks bbolss. I am searching a system kike this for a long time. Going to try this system tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #632 ---
thanks so much for this thread. just to clarify, do we need to see very clear step up or down from the 5m alf before we enter trade?

--- 帖子 #633 ---
yes price moves above alf mtf alf is moving up as well. Or use the EA and decided if you like all the filters or just a few or none. With all the filters on the EA has a tendency to place open trade at the top of the 1m range so a draw down happens before the 1 min catches up to the 5 and higher frames. I'm experimenting with only some of the filters to see if I can get in sooner and catch the move. Like we do when we manual trade this system.

--- 帖子 #634 ---
Can you expalin or post a chart on how your using this new indy with the manual system?

--- 帖子 #635 ---
Hey tommbstone, Sure!! not a problem Please refer to the image uploaded. So lets pretend for a moment, you are trading during U.S. session, you look at the trade presented in the image, and you decide to short the trade. At that very moment your girlfriend/wife walks in and ask you to buy something at the market, naturally most people hate walking away from their computer and not have a clue whats going on!! But wait, you just downloaded my MTF Schaff Trend indicator, which has an email alert system, if you have your phone setup correctly, once MTF Schaff Trend reverses above 25, you get that email, you login into your account with your phone, and you can immediately close the trade with a +30 pip gain!! The MTF Schaff Trend indicator is just meant to gives traders back their lifes. Enter your trade, setup the alert system and go enjoy life!!

--- 帖子 #636 ---
ok I see... makes perfect sence thanks

--- 帖子 #637 ---
Hi eurisko, can you post your templates and the indicators which you have used?

--- 帖子 #638 ---
Hi srpips!! The template contains the MTF Schaff Trend v2.02, I suggest to play with it, if your using the strategy to scalp then using the M5 timeframe is perhaps best for scalping, if you think the trade might continue in the same direction because of some strong fundamental or technical analysis, then perhaps set timeframe to M15 (15) or even H1 (60). Let me know if you have any questions! Note: All credit goes to the original creator of the strategy, BBolss.

--- 帖子 #639 ---
I recently received some concerns about my recent upload of my template and indicators, I heard it was crashing metatrader. I really have no idea why this would happen to be honest, however I've repackaged the template and indicators. In this new package I've only included the .ex4 files, I'm thinking maybe metatrader was having problems trying to compile the code? So if the code is already compiled, maybe it would be easier on the system. Let me know if there is any concerns, or if anyone is still having a problem.

--- 帖子 #640 ---
That's a mazing indiactor,and thank you very much, and how about work with MTF macd,like 1h and 4h, it will be more helpful.

--- 帖子 #641 ---
Hi all! this is nice sistem, but I can`t try it because I dont see on my chart ALF!!! I download indi and attach, but nothing happend! please help me!!! sorry for my poor english

--- 帖子 #642 ---
zhuxinyicn, check out the indicator I just uploaded, you can use it for MTF MACD.

--- 帖子 #643 ---
Marrow, did you load all the indicators into the proper folder? and then load the template into the template folder? Did you load the template file afterwards? What did you do exactly?

--- 帖子 #644 ---
YES! I find link indi like ALF http://cdn.forexfactory.com/attachme...7&amp;d=1254031398

--- 帖子 #645 ---
moderator has rejected my previous post. This link to the indicator which is similar to Alf, but I can not compare it to Alf, because ALF did not work. in the previous message was written "I put the indicator in the folder expert indicators and restart Terminal. added to the chart but nothing happened. Then I opened the window of data, and there I saw that data indicators 0,0000." You can download the link indicator and say does it look like Alf!

--- 帖子 #646 ---
Thank you very much eurisko, but I can't download it with your link, just a php file, or maybe someting wrong with my computer?

--- 帖子 #647 ---
change the name on the file to the one you need. with the .zip it will work. I wish the form would fix this strange error

--- 帖子 #648 ---
Thanks eurisko How does this system trades during choppy times?

--- 帖子 #649 ---
Its fine manualy but turn the ea off.

--- 帖子 #650 ---
Juzgood1978, What do you mean by choppy times? If you are referring towards price action ranging, you will be murdered like always. If I see a ranging market, I will almost never enter a trade. I only enter a trade if I can determine a trend and see a good risk to reward ratio like 1:2.

--- 帖子 #651 ---
but problem with range is it happens then we know it by them we got murdered already..

--- 帖子 #652 ---
Well, I will at least tell you what i do. I look at the M5 chart, I look to see if price action has made a recent high or low, I monitor price action and setup alerts to when the recent high or low has been broken. I trade the breakout of a range, using wave analysis.

--- 帖子 #653 ---
It does not show on your template posted for me..do you just use the default settings? thanks Brian

--- 帖子 #654 ---
golden1, are you talking about schaff trend? The setting are based on your preference of trading. If you are just scalping then maybe timeframe should be 5, if you day trade then maybe 15 or even 60. I use the 25/75 levels to provide trend reversal levels. I'm not sure why its not showing for you, trying attaching it to another chart. Is anyone else having problems with the template?

--- 帖子 #655 ---
Thank you, I already download it successfully

--- 帖子 #656 ---
Hello there, I had the same problem as others did have before ... can't see ALF ... when I load the template I got the following alert by MT4: 2010.10.09 15:46:24 Cannot open file 'C rogram FilesFXCM MT4 powered by BTexpertsindicatorsMACD_ColorHist.ex4' on the EURUSD,M1 So, what's it all about? Thanks for your advice!

--- 帖子 #657 ---
This thread and adaptation of ALF looked interesting. Sad to see it devolve into another quest by lazy traders to try and make it into another holy grail EA that won't work, because EA's will always be missing the secret ingriediant, a human brain.... discretion. I really hope that the manual traders trading this come back and post their trades to continue this thread.

--- 帖子 #658 ---
No problems eurisko, its all part of the learning from sharing process. I've been away for over 5 weeks &amp; another 2 weeks of catching up on threads. Have had a read through the additions you put in. Looks good. Have been trying to get my head around how to sort out an ea for alf &amp; alf mtf indi's. Will get there eventually. cheers scalpz

--- 帖子 #659 ---
I still use it to scalp out a few pips.. the ea never did work 100% correct. It would double your account then bang it. LOL nothing new there

--- 帖子 #660 ---
hello guys im glad that somone is still using it! yep the ea for this sucks but it is still good system! unfortunetly i left alf and all other stuff now i scalp only with PA and sometimes rsi it is no so hard ! and there is zero lag in my trades not like with alf or any other indi! you should try

--- 帖子 #661 ---
i'm not ready for PA yet. So many info in FF. Maybe you can give us some suggestion about it?

--- 帖子 #662 ---
yep this require some skils but if faster you start then faster you will be good at it! i will write some topic i think or journal right after i will double my real account ;] i still need some time but im on right patch i think =] regards

--- 帖子 #663 ---
Let me know

--- 帖子 #664 ---
Thanks alot bbolss for a very useful system!!! This is my live acc after 7 days trade! $5000 fund, bonus $400, profit $937.18; Total profit: $1,337.18

--- 帖子 #665 ---
That's awesome. I have 3 questions - 1) What percentage of your account are you risking per trade ? 2) Are you using the ea ? (I hope not) 3) How are you avoiding ranging markets ?

--- 帖子 #666 ---
hahah yeah the ea posted was garbage BUT this is a good scalping system if you have the screen time.

--- 帖子 #667 ---
sorry for late reply! 1. my risk is 5% per trade. 2. No,I'm not use EA 3. I just use bbolss' s system to scalping so there were both Sell &amp; Buy in short time. There were 3 loss trades per total 74 trades

--- 帖子 #668 ---
A ranging market is the bread and butter of 1 minute scalping. Just keep your pip cost down with a low spread. I am happiest in a ranging market pulling 3-10 pips per trade. I trade the GBP/JPY with an ECN broker and don't enter a trade unless the spread is less than 2 1/2 pips. During a ranging market, just ride the waves up and down. During a trending market, just enter the wave in the direction of the trend. To me that is harder.

--- 帖子 #669 ---
Thanks Tomb I wouldn't dare an EA to pull the trigger. Just wanted to know if his win rate was through manual trading

--- 帖子 #670 ---
Thanks for sharing personal info. If I come anything that might help, i'll pass it on

--- 帖子 #671 ---
Its a good system just don't use the EA I just don't like sitting in front of my computer biting my nails during drawdown. LOL I'm a set and forget guy now. But it does work no doubts just follow rules

--- 帖子 #672 ---
Hello hung303, tell me plese you use bbolss system with alf indicator? If it's not problem for you, can you attach template or full trading system? Thanx !!!!

--- 帖子 #673 ---
Be attentive! All that is in the 1st page of this thread.

--- 帖子 #674 ---
Just curious, What happen to this thread??

--- 帖子 #675 ---
NB, I'm not sure , I think that the thread starter went away and the various entries to achieve 100% success got too hard. I use ALF cross as one of my entries at 1 and 5m and its quite consistent in the right market conditions. rgds Peter

--- 帖子 #676 ---
I noticed several indicators in the folder, which ones are best to use? Also, I was looking to see a decent scalping system enhanced using 10.0 or 10.1 reads. I read an early post where they had trouble with this system when the market is ranging but 10.0 lets you know the market is ranging so you can adjust accordingly in your trades. I was thinking that 10.0 or 10.1 would help this system out knowing that. With 10.1 S/R lines you would know to look for a BO or bounce off the S/R line. Anyway this one for some reason peaked my interest.

--- 帖子 #677 ---
Hi Peter, how do you determine the right market conditions for ALF cross usage? Do you have some rules? Regards, Q

--- 帖子 #678 ---
NB and Quoyend. NB, I have tried using your V10 range or trend finder and think it works well down to 15m. Beneath this market movements, the impact of market openings, news, random events overcomes ranging or trading. Especially around market openings and in volatile periods such as Greek tragedies. Some thoughts on whether the market is ranging or trending. Personally I trade 1m and 5m at random periods of days and nights due to being a consultant, frequent insomniac, live in Aust (UK opening is about 7pm, US open about 1am my time) and have kids that require drop offs and pickups most days of the week at random times of the day and night. I take about 5 seconds to visually determine if market is ranging or trending. Simple use the daily open,(white horizontal line), if price has stayed near this it's ranging , if its away from this with long price movements its trending. If crossovers of the alf line are close in the last hour or so its ranging. If it moves suddenly with long candles making new daily highs or lows its trending. The ALF line by itself replaces any other indicators other than the Bressert indicators (current timeframe and 1 tf up) which in certain market conditions can be very accurate, in trending periods just trade the Alf line and candles. I'm at a loss why people use so many indicators when they are typically variations on a moving average. I trade 1m, 5m (generally if 1m ATR &lt; 5 pips I trade 1m &gt; 5 pips or so 5m) chart side by side and use 4 different entry, exit strategies depending on ranging or trending, ALF line crosses combined with Bressert gives great trend entries either for entering at the start or on pull backs. Smart trading suggests only taking trades in the direction away from the daily open as this is the short term or daily trend - I'm not that smart and I tend to overtrade. I have included a renko version of an ALF template to provide a wider view. Hope that helps rgds Peter

--- 帖子 #679 ---
Thanks for the detailed reply. I became a higher TF trader because I dont have time to just sit and stare at a screen on a lower TF. Drives me nuts anyway. Just thought that maybe with 10.0 some other system might fit well.

--- 帖子 #680 ---
Hi Peter, could you share a template and the indis, please? Thank you very much for your efforts! Best regards!

--- 帖子 #205 ---
Thank You for the answer! The above pretty much describes me as well, although I reside in Poland, so I am in tune with the London session Being a programmer, I navigate to write automated algorithms and start to come to conclusion that the scalping ones should be turned on/off using discretionary decisions. Regards, Q

--- 帖子 #206 ---
Hi, nice system. tested some live trades today. Got 12 trades. 9 profit 2 loser 1 still open with be+4

--- 帖子 #207 ---
Hi everyone! i am fascinated by this thread. I began to practice this exciting method. The thing I am still missing is how to determine the trading dynamic, in terms of risk rewards, exiting on loss and exiting on profit. off-course I would love any insights you may share about the system's workflow. I would like to ask any of you that trade this system (and specially bbolss) if you could publish a video of actual trading. Cheers, Gilben

--- 帖子 #208 ---
OK guys, I've posted a sitrep on how I'm doing with this system. It is very good indeed and bbolss has shown good skill and good mental approach in coming up with this. Excellent work. Today I wanted to capture a trade done in afternoon (UK time) which I've attached. You can see I had a text book set up in terms of the MTF and 1M ALF. This is in my opinion a laser guided method. I set my stop loss for about 7 pips. I set target just above the "big round number" of 1.35000 ( EURUSD.) Be in no doubt - these psycological levels are like magnets and "attract" the price to them. Then...BANG...Job done with a good result. I also use a price channel which you can see. Top work bbolss. I wish you every success and thank you for your generosity.

--- 帖子 #209 ---
Hello hung303, tell me plese you use bbolss system with alf indicator? If it's not problem for you, can you attach template or full trading system? Thanx !!
