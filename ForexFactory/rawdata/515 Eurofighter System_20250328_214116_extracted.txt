Vertical line #1 15m: Stochastic making swing high and price find resistance @ PW 1.3950 and 365EMA of H1. 5m: Stochastic making swing high and price find resistance @ PW 1.3950 . Entry @ the opening of next candle in 5m (1.3944) with 20p SL. Easy 20p profit @ 1.3924. Vertical line #2 15m: Price still resisted @ 365EMA of H1. Stochastic still going down. A Trend Continuous (TC) signal. 5m: Stochastic diverging with the price making Doube Top (finding resistance around the previous high @ vert. line #1). Entry @ the opening of the next candle in 5m (1.3937) with 20p SL. Easy 20p profit @ 1.3917 HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Look at vertical line X. I am always alert when the stochastic in 15m TF below level 20 or above level 80. In this case, the stoch reading @ 13.8+++. Siganl to place for my BUYING position. Then I flip to m5 chart n c where I can make my "clean" entry. Obviously, in this case it is at the opening of next candle. LONG @ 1.3910 with 20p SL. Another easy 20p profit from this move.

--- 帖子 #5 ---
thanks for system...does your system has better performance versus 4h MACD strategy in your experience ?????

--- 帖子 #6 ---
To me yes... I can easily get 80pips/day using this system because that is my target just for a day.

--- 帖子 #7 ---
This one is only based on 5m stochastic swing high. The vertical line is the signal candle as the stochastic reading @ 91.4++ (super swing high). In 15m, the stoch seems going up, so this is a Counter Trend (CT) and I only willing to risk 10p SL for this one. Entry @ the opening of next candle (1.3934) with 10p SL. Easy 10p profit...but nerve wrecking trade as well... HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #8 ---
Thanks for sharing, I'm going to try it on my MT4 also.

--- 帖子 #9 ---
4 entries per day using 20p SL/TP strategy = 80p profit daily. Should be enough for you? All the best

The last example for this week. This entry are based on 5m stochastic and 15m Price Action (PA). 15m : Doji candle with support @ previous low (see the support-resistance indy in blue dots ) 5m: Stoch reading @ 11.7++ (swing low) for BUYING signal. Entry (LONG) @ opening next candle of 5m (1.3910) with 10p SL. Easy 10p profit @ 1.3920

--- 帖子 #12 ---
Thanks for your idea. It seems my system still a lot better for me.

--- 帖子 #13 ---
Sometime stochastic making divergence/convergence before it reach 80/20 levels. Say if we make 9 entries as per 5m chart below and our entries are @ the vertical lines...if we use 10p SL/TP strategy, how many trade we will lost here? Answer is none. Profit is 90pips. THINK AGAIN.

Hi Orange, I really like your approach. Can you share your templates. Thanks PR

--- 帖子 #15 ---
Thanks for sharing your system!I will test it,for sure!

--- 帖子 #16 ---
well i have been usin this sys for quite a while and it really works wonders, i will be sharing my trades tht i did with this sys, its very easy and works well in all market situation, thanks Orange for the research and time u have spent on this sys, i hope traders get more pips out of it

Hi all... m15 stochastic already bounce from its swing low and m5 stoch is also about to make its own swing low soon. My prediction is that the price will rebounce somewhere inside the aquamarine rectangular ( 50sma of m15 region) and will go up to at least 21ema (m5) for another swing high in m5... Well...this is what I can tell from the system we are using here... Let us see if I'm correct or not tomorrow... HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #22 ---
Well...I was wrong in my prediction last night...sorry about that.. BUT THAT'S OKAY...it is just a prediction...no entry is made there.... The trend is clearly down right now...as you can see how fast the price going downside per m5 below... SELLING is back in control...just watch for the swing high @ m5 for SHORT position... 50sma (m5)/ 21ema (m15) are the points where you can short this pair at the momment... HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #23 ---
Alright... Let us see how we can use the 5m stochastic swing high/low as signal for our entry. Also, let us see how good is your entry if the 5m swings is in agreement with the 15m stochastic. Consider our entry is at the next opening candle of 5m.... (A) 5m + 15m stochastic signals are in agreement Vertical line #1 and #4 have this signal's criteria. Vert. line #1 is SHORT signal meanwhile vert. line #4 is LONG signal. As per this system's rules and strategies, we can already bank 40pips profit from these 2 entries (20pips x 2). Note: Rules for 5m entry based on 5m and 15m stochastic behaviours is SL=TP=20pips (B) 5m stochastic signal Vertical line #2, #3, #5 and #6 are only based on 5m stochastic signal. All lines are signal for SHORT and among them, only signal #5 is a bad signal (but it still give profit). The rules says that this kind of entry will at least give us 30pips in hand (10pips x 3) if we are not considering vert.line #5 to make an entry there. Note : Rules for 5m entry which is only based on 5m stochastic behaviour itself is SL=TP=10pips CONCLUSION 1) Overall trades can give profit up to 70pips; &amp; 2) It is up to you whether you wanna use criteria (A) or (B) or both of them to make your entry...they are still profitable Your questions/comments/suggestions are most welcome.

well made few good pips this morning, was a perfect setup for goin short, though the odds were against it. entered short @1.3990 with trailin stops following the 5 min and 15 stoch. made around 40 pips in this down move. now why i made this move was pretty obvious, if u look at 15 min it was headed down and 5 min was in sync with it, now as i look at my charts the price is arnd 1.3950, with 15 min stoch arnd middle and 5 min makin a swing low. will go short for few pips lets c where it end up

--- 帖子 #25 ---
ok here are the charts, as we see tht 15 stoch is still in the middle of nowhere but 5 min is makin swing low, so i would jus wait for it to make swing high and will enter for nice 10-15 pips, easy . yeh i got the bigger picture from 15 min and am gone be usin 5 min for exact entry, lets c how it works out

--- 帖子 #26 ---
Hello all... Earlier today (23/06/2009)...these are the signals that we can use to make entry... Signal #1 and #3 (LONG) : Entries only based on 5m stochastic swing low Signal #2 (SHORT) : Entry based on both 5m and 15m stochastic swing high... Early 30pips today if considering that you are taking all these signals Yesterday 22/06/2009 (Monday) we see the price close below Price Wave 1.3870. The next level we should watch is 80pips above and below this PW, which are Price Wave 1.3790 and 1.3950 . HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

I have updated my fib levels and the temporary trend line @ H4. Also, attached herewith is the template for those who want to use it.

Hello Orange and Arslan thank's for putting this nice system do have any trading reports on this system or do you have started testing it now.

--- 帖子 #29 ---
You are welcome. Trading reports on this system? Maybe Arslan can answer this question. I will be trading once I quit my job soon and becaome a fulltime trader myself. It should be this year...

--- 帖子 #30 ---
Alright guys... This is a perfect example from real market condition right now. This is how you see the chart...starting from:- H4: We are expecting the price will make some big retracement since the Stochastic GOING HIGH H1: Stochastic already @ SWING HIGH...!! M15: Stochastic making SWING HIGH...!!! M5: Stochastic making SWING HIGH...!!!! So, if you wanna make a big catch... you must think of SHORT right now...if the current swing high in m5 didn't work....wait for another swing high.... It is very rare to find stochastic in all these TFs agreeing to each other at the same time....so never missed this opportunity...!!! HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #31 ---
For 20p SL/TP rules, the criteria is when the stochastic from both m5 and m15 are in agreement. Below are some of the latest example:- Signal #1 (LONG) Entry @ opening of next candle of m5 = 1.3837 SL @ 20pips = 1.3817 TP @ 20pips = 1.3857 TRADE WAS SUCCESFULL FOR THIS SIGNAL.... Signal #2 (SHORT) - Counter Trend (CT) Entry @ opening of next candle of m5 = 1.3933 SL @ 20pips = 1.3953 TP @ 20pips = 1.3913 TRADE IS STILL ONGOING FOR THIS SIGNAL... THE TREND SEEMS GOING UPSIDE AND STRONG...SO LET US SEE WHETHER THIS 5M ENTRY (CT) IS A BAD ONE...OR WE HAVE TO USE ANOTHER SWING HIGH IN M5 TO MAKE ANOTHER ENTRY... HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #32 ---
Alright...yesterday signal #2 was a false signal.... The uptrend was too fast (the price only riding on 21ema of 5m) and when this happen...we should only favour 5m Stochastic SWING LOW for entry (LONG). That is an easy come back for the lost we made earlier on signal #2.

--- 帖子 #33 ---
Earlier today...we found two signals for 5m entry based on 15m stochastic swing high/low. The first signal is 15m swing high and the second signal 15m swing is low . Easy 40pips profit within 2 hours for this move. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Okay... This overview is made after the Asian session is closed and during the first 2hrs of European session. Lets go from:- D1 As per the chart, you all can clearly see the longterm thick and black Trend Lines (TL) with the Equidistant Channel in pink. The major trend is still uptrend after EU testing the lower part of the channel yesterday (23/06/2009). H4 A temporary thin and black resistance TL is made from this TF and below by extending the Previous Swing High of the stochastic to the Latest Swing High. Only the highest high is considered to form this line. Price might pullback to around 21ema or at least to fib 76.4% if we are considering the stochastic and the price are going all the way down soon (normal market condition). H1 You can see the Price Wave as per this system is working nicely. See how the Price Wave 1.4110 taking charge and become the immediate resistance for EU now. Always go to the first post @ first page (titled ADDITIONAL FEATURES ) to find out the sequence of the Price Wave of the system. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #37 ---
Hi all... As per the system...Price Wave is equally important as the TL and fib levels. Below is another example for nice entry (SHORT) after getting SHORT ENTRY signal from 5m stochastic (swing high). Price finding resistance from PW and TL in this case (see aqua rectangular) . Considering the PA, PW is the immediate res for EU. In relation to the stochastic behaviour swing high) at this point, looking for SHORT wth 10p SL/TP strategy would be so easy. SIGNAL @ blue vertical line ENTRY @ 1.4108 with 10p SL/TP strategy.... Another easy and convincing 10pips profit... HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Hi Orange and thank you to take your time to share and teach your system ! I just want to know about what session do you prefer to trade this system ? And can you post your own templates because the templates posted before don t represent the same view i see on the charts you posted in this thread ! Thanks Orange Luk

--- 帖子 #43 ---
Here is the template. Normally, I prefer during the first 2hours of Euro session and onwards to trade this system. I will avoid 1 hour before opening US session, ahead of NFP and rates announcement. Let me know if the template doesn't work. All the best...

--- 帖子 #44 ---
Thanks Orange for your templates but the problem seem to be that about 3 indicators don t show up on my chart ! I tried manuelly but the same problem ! Do you have any idea ? Luk

--- 帖子 #45 ---
Hi all... As per D1 , the uptrending Channel is still in control but the potential bearish market ahead is always there. Strong support from 365EMA for few days already. A very sharp stochastic swinging down in H4 yesterday, as the price actually found it support @ 50SMA in sync with stochastic level for SWING LOW right now. Please see the aqua rectangular for a better understanding. From H1, a clearer view that the price has actually support by the lower part of the Channel with the immediate res @ fib 76.4%. Next level to watch for today : Price wave 1.4030 (high) and 1.3870(low) HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Which indy r u reffering to? I have them on the 1st page of this thread. U can get them there if you want. Let me know if you any other troubles

--- 帖子 #47 ---
I dowloaded these indicators on the first page for the second time tonight and still the same problem, in fact i have only «stochastic bar v2» on my chart and the 3 others indicators don t show up on my chart ! Luk

--- 帖子 #48 ---
Placing sell limit here based on 15m+5m swing high (a little bit late entry as per 5m). Order @ blue vertical line with 20p SL/TP as my trading strategy. Let us see how it goes.

--- 帖子 #49 ---
Okay...try this again...

--- 帖子 #50 ---
Thanks you very much Orange it works like a swiss clock now ! About template, do you use the same for 5M and 15M ? Luk

They are all the same..from M1 to MN.... All the best to you...PM or mail me also can do mate... K.I.T.

--- 帖子 #52 ---
Thank you Orange for the quick reply, now i m ready to try this system ! Luk

You are welcome... So far so good...you can see it yourself now... All the best to you...

--- 帖子 #54 ---
About this trade now pa sit on 50 and 21 ma what do you do now because i m 11 pips in profit ? Luk

--- 帖子 #55 ---
I mean do you exit at this point or if you still aim your 20 pips target even in this situation Orange ? Luk

--- 帖子 #56 ---
The 20p SL/TP strategy mean if u have ur both SL and TP = 20pips...then 20pips it has to be. Thats the rules. If ur entry only based on 5m stochastic swing high/low, ur SL/TP = 10pips. However...it is not a good idea to pull out half way even if the PA seems hardly to go below 50SMA. STICK TO THE RULES.

--- 帖子 #57 ---
Ok thanks Orange

--- 帖子 #58 ---
Thanks Orange, i will do my best ! Luk

--- 帖子 #59 ---
Orange, just to be sure about the rules, even when stochastic has changed direction in 5M and 15M we stay in the trade too ? Thanks Luk

--- 帖子 #60 ---
few pips to go... Note: I took this trade because the trend still look shaky to me...so I x think the 50sma (m5) is a tough support for now. Just wait what will happen...stochastic @ m15 still on the way down

--- 帖子 #61 ---
You need to stay with the rules. From that you can find out whether the stochastic in 5m/15m making a true/false signal. Try to relate the PA that move around MAs/PW/fib/TL and Equidistant Channel that in sync with the stochastic behaviour. From there you can see where to make a good entry. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #62 ---
It was a little bit tough ride (around 3hours of waiting) since the entry wasn't that good and made during the Mid-Asian session ...but...this trade still manage to get the 20pips somewhere around aqua rectangular area as per the chart below. Something is already well proven from this system...even ii is used during the "quite market". HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #63 ---
Using 20p SL/TP strategy as both m5 and m15 stochastic now are @ swing low level (&lt;20). ENTRY @ lime vertical line. Let us see if this move works or not.

--- 帖子 #64 ---
It seems this one was a false signal.

--- 帖子 #65 ---
Okay...let's try again for this one...I'm doing a CT (Counter Trend) now. Stochastic @ M5 and M15 are both making swing low supported with H1 swing low as well. Price testing lower part of the CHANNEL (potential strong support level). Entry @ LIME vertical line using 10 lot entry for this one with 20p SL/TP strategy. Let's see if this one still works.

--- 帖子 #66 ---
TP was hit @ blue vertical line. Regain back 20pis in the previous lost. This move only required 30mins. Another well proven result by this system.

--- 帖子 #67 ---
Alright...I'll make it SHORT and SIMPLE here... D1 The major trend is still uptrend, but it is a weak trend as both RSI and momentum in the "ranging zone". Stochastic also seems unsure with its direction. H4 This is where the fun begin. Nice rebounce from the support area ( aqua rectangular) as both the price and stohastic agreeing each other. Lower part of Channel , 50SMA and 200SMA are obviously the strong support areas now. Alert: STOCHASTIC @ SWING HIGH...!!! H1 Price just manage to close somewhere above Price Wave 1.4030. And please be aware that the stochastic is in sync with H4's stochastic as well. They are both @ SWING HIGH... CONCLUSION Favour the SHORT (SELL) for today should be great. Just keep in mind that the market can change direction at anytime for any reason. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Hi Orange , just want to be sure what you mean about your trading time with news announcement included, can you elaborate more ? Ok for the first 2 hours of Euro session but i m not sure about what you mean after that ! Sorry Orange but English is not my native language and sometimes it needs more time to understand ! btw i had good results the last 2 Euro session with about 80 pips total with 6 successful demo trades in a row ! Thanks Luk

--- 帖子 #69 ---
Hi Luk, First of all...congratulation with the 80p+6 succesfull demo in a row. That's very stunning but of course, with this system...trading is EASY right? You can go to www.bloomberg.com to find out what is the opening time for Euro session and compare it to your local time. Then watch the market (EURusd) during the first 2 Hours of Euro session from its opening. I will not trade ahead of NFP and ECB/Fed interest rates announcement since the market quite "crazy" before these news are released. For safety, leave the market for a while (1 to 2 hrs) after they are released. Let the dust settle to the ground. That's what other traders always said. Hope this helps. Keep in touch and all the best.

Hello all...Friday (26/06/2009) was seems a little bit thin trading day for us. To see what we can have for tomorrow, let us go chart by chart:- D1 Price ended up below temporary resistance line that I made before (look at the black thin line ) and the stochastic is still uncertain with its direction. RSI however giving a little bearish signal. Watch for the fib 76.4% as the immediate support level. H4 A clearer view from this TF. Aqua rectangular is the area where EU found resistance from the temporary TL and it seems the stochastic is in agreement with the price (SWING HIGH). Nice long tail PA for the last candle. Based on the stochastic, there is a possiblity for EU will retrace to at least 21EMA tomorrow. H1 The LIME vertical line is where the last H4 candle began. Here we can see the Price Wave 1.4110 also come into play as the res TL also in place. Let us see if the PW 1.4030 can support EU in the early session of the market next MONDAY (29/06/2009). HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #71 ---
Alright... This is another example for those who want to trade only based on 5m stochastic swing high/low only. The rules is 10SL/TP. Below is the last 8 hours of the market on last Friday (26/06/2009). The LIME vertical lines #5 and #6 represent the 5th and the 6th candle of H4 on this day (1day = 6 candles of H4) The BLUE vertical lines are the signal candles (stochastic swing high/low). Consider all entries ( SHORT and LONG ) are at the opening of the next candle after the signal:- SHORT (a, c, e, f, g, j) If the rules as above applied, all of these entries give profit = 60pips..!!! LONG (b, d, h, i, k) With the same rules, d and k can give profit = 20pips...!!! Roughly...all these entries can give you at least clean 50pips profit for the last 8 hours of the market. How much will you get if you start trading at the very beginning of the day? THINK ABOUT IT.... Even Friday is always a tough day for trading...but there is always trading opportunities...

l think you are right. it will hit the pw 1.4030 and down to 50% fibo (H1)

--- 帖子 #73 ---
Orange, Thank you for sharing your system. I have been demoing it since last week and it's looking pretty good. Will you please give an explanation how you use RSI and Momentum in this system. Thanks! ForexRook

--- 帖子 #74 ---
First of all, welcome to the thread and it's always my pleasure to share this system with you and the others. Both RSI and Momentum are optional indicators for this system, however they are very useful as filters for the stochastic behaviour. Below is the latest example on M15. As you can see, momentum has been bottoming very low. Theoretically, it should bounce up together with the price. RSI also quite low and just above the OVERSOLD level, so we might anticipate the price would regain it strength sooner or later. And as you can see in the black rectangular, the price also rebounce according to all the indicators (stochastic+RSI+momentum) and it is supported by 50SMA of H1. I rarely looking at RSI+momentum because they are not so accurate as stochastic do. As I said, they are just filters...but very useful filters. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #75 ---
Alright guys...as per D1, it was a doji candle on Sunday.... So, here we go:- H4 Price testing the 21EMA on the first 4hrs of trading today. Looks like it currently supported by this MA together with the fib 76.4% . H1 This TF showing some early move with the stochastic already making swing low once the price supported by 50SMA and fib 76.4% . The major trend is still uptrending but it is still too early to say if this trend will be continuing later today. Just watch and play with the lower TF, M15 and M5 as what this system is all about. That is why it is named "515" Eurofighter System...we are paying more attention on M15 and M15 entries for EURusd only. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #76 ---
Here we go again... Watch out the two MAs ( 50SMA and 89SMA ) with the lower part of the Channel once again. These are the SWING LOW area (especially the Channel's area) where the price found support. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #77 ---
Okay... Here is one of the best example based on the 20p SL/TP rules:- M15 1) Stochastic @ swing low level; 2) Fib 76.4% is the immediate support as what it has done in the previous swing low M5 1) The LIME vertical line is the signal candle. Stochastic already making swing low supported by the momentum behaviour; 2) Entry (LONG) at the opening of the next candle. Another EASY and CONVINCING 20p profit. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #78 ---
Okay...this one is the latest and one of the simplest example to identify whether the current market is trending or not. In the case as below, this is an uptrend and I am using entry based on M5 only. The rules is 10p SL/Tp. Signal #1: Stochastic @ SWING LOW with the price closing just above the 21EMA . Signal #2: Here is the most important area. Stochastic @ SWING HIGH but you might not want to risk to SELL, which is a CT (Counter Trade) because you still not sure about this one. You should leave this stochastic signal to see what happen on the next SWING LOW . Signal #3: Stochastic @ SWING LOW once again with the price is also closing above 21EMA . Enter (BUY) at the opening of the next candle. Another easy and convincing 10p profit for this one. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #79 ---
As usual, entry @ the opening of the next candle. 1 , 3 , and 5 are BUY signals. 2 and 4 are SELL signals. If your entry is simply based on the M5 stochastic swing high/low only, and the rules is 10p SL/TP, the example as below are 5 signals that will give you easy 50p profit. THINK ABOUT IT... Any question/comment is most welcome here... HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #80 ---
This one is the latest signal that happened just now. Stochastic @ both TF (M5 and M15) are @ swing low. Also, both stochastic and momentum in M5 are @ swing low. Entry @ the opening of the next candle (M5) using 20p SL/TP (because our entry also based on M15 stochastic signal). Another easy and convincing 20p profit from this move.

Hello all... Yesterday (29/06/2009) was quite a little bit thin trading volume. Let us see where EU can go today:- D1 Stochastic @ SWING HIGH level and waiting above is the temporary TL ( thin black line ) as the immediate resistance. Be alert for the retracement! H4 Price making a TC pattern yesterday after it bounced of 21EMA , which also supported by fib 76.4% ( SEE AQUA RECTANGULAR ). However, also be alert for the stochastic as it is seems to make another SWING HIGH as per chart below. H1 Alright...here the fun begin. Stochastic already making SWING HIGH. A lot of support from below and I think if the price retracement is in sync with the stochastic, we can see the price will go down to at least 50SMA or Price Wave 1.4030 . I will favour SHOURT for now using 5m and 15m stochastic signal/entry. This is what the system is all about. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #86 ---
Alright...so far today we have 5 stochastic signals (swing higs/low)from M15 TF. Using the 20p SL/TP strategy, below are the result from the stochastic signals ( LIME vertical lines). SHORT (1,3,5) Signal #3 and #5 gives positive result = 40pips (Net profit after minus false signal #1 = 20pips) LONG (2 and 4) All signal gives positive result = 40pips Overall profit so far = 60pips . HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #87 ---
Alright...I'll make it simple for now... D1 Price still moving within the Equidistant Channel and the uptrending market is still in control. However the stochastic has already swinging down. Be alert. H4 Price supported @ fib 76.4% and 50SMA . Stochastic also already making the SWING LOW, but this doesn't simply mean that the price will bounce. Another temporary Res TL ( see red arrow ) is made. You can load my template later on to get this TL. H1 Stochastic is on its way up and the price probably resisted @ somewhere around 50SMA before the stochastic making it SWING HIGH . We'll see how the market do later on today. Price currently nicely sitting @ Price Wave 1.4030 . A very nice level for your favourable set up and trading plan. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Hi all... As per the system using 15m ann 5m stochastic swing high/low, so far there was only one good signal (see blue vertical line #1 ) that can give a safe 20p SL/TP . Signal #2 is only suitable for 10p SL/TP strategy (using 5m only Sotchastic swing high). It seems a little bit uptrending but there will be more opportunities to make entries once the US session is on. Be patience. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Hello Jey, First of all, thanks for your compliments. Yes, I'm from Kuching, Sarawak. You need to download the custom indys provided in this thread and the EA as well. Just in case. Whenever I attach my template, it is always the latest update. So keep you eyes on that too. Your contribution in this thread is highly appreciated. All the best.

Hello all... Here are the latest good signal using 20SL/TP strategy , which is based on both 15m and 5m stochastic swing high/low. The first blue vertical line is LONG signal. A fine entry should be done @ aqua vertical line (the opening of the candle). The second blue vertical line is for SHORT signal. Entry @ the opening of the next 5m candle (aqua vertical line) should be fine. Another easy and convincing 40pips!!! HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Hi all... NFP and ECB rates announcement ahead. It will be an interesting day for today. So here is my overview:- (PAY ATTETION TO THE AQUA VERTICAL LINE ) D1 The uptrending market is still in control as per the MAs and Equidistant Channel . However, please be aware on what the stochastic is currently showing us. H4 The temporary TL (THIN black TL) has been broken but the price making a swing high once it resisted by the longer term TL (THICK black TL) and agreeing with this is the stochastic which making the SWING HIGH as per the aqua vertical line. If the price is in sync with the stochastic, 50SMA should become the reliable support for SWING LOW stochastic later today. H1 From the aqua vertical line (where H4 stochastic making SWING HIGH), the price is nicely sitting @ Price Wave 1.4110 where the stochastic has already @ SWING LOW level. A nice level as per the system. Loads of support from below but the H4 is dominant. So we stillcan see a great ranging market today. So far, there is no clear direction but it seems bias to the downside as per D1 and H4 stochastic. Use lower TF (5m and 15m) to play around with the market as what this sytem is all about. Note: I prefer not to trade ahead of NFP and rates announcement. Let the market establish its rhythm first. Don't let the dust wipe out your SL. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Hello all... As I stated in my previous post, the trend is bias to the downside as what we can see from 15m chart as below. From the beginning of today ( aqua vertical line ), price currently resisted @ 21EMA a few times and making a TC (Trend Continues) pattern. Please look at the aqua rectangulars area where 21EMA is becoming the immediate resistance for EU. SHORT entries based on 5m stochastic SWING HIGH definitely give you some positive pips from this short term market rhythm. This is just another technique on how we can read the 15m rhythm and finding some nice entries using 5m stochastic swing high/low. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #99 ---
This is another example of using 5m stochastic SWING HIGH signal ( blue vertical line) to make my SHORT entry @ aqua vertical line. Using 20p SL/TP strategy, this move looks promising as I see the 50SMA (5m) is currently become a very comforting immediate resistance for the price. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Hi all... The market has been very2 bearish this one whole day since its opening @ aqua vertical line. Since stochastic in H4 is @ SWING LOW level , let us wait and see whether the fib 76.4% and 89SMA / 200SMA @ H4 could support this pair by the end of the day. The D1 stochastic is more dominant compare to the H4 stochastic, so it still seems that the trend is in strong bearish for today. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Hello all... Since today is US banks holiday...so I think the trading volume will be very low. Also, I have adjusted my Equidistant Channel (upper channel) a little bit. Simply put, I think the market will only move somewhere between Price Wave 1.3950 and 1.4030 today (see H1 chart below). Let the market readjust itself and established for today.

Hello all... Price Wave (PW) in this system is very important. As listed in post #1 of this thread, let us see more about PW in this lesson and how we can benefit from it. The charts below showing the market movement for this week, beginning from 29/06/2009 to 03/07/2009 (Monday - Friday). I remove all the MAs and TLs so that you guys will have a clearer view for this lesson. Alright, here we go:- Trading Day/ Open(PW)/ Close(PW)/ High or Low (PW) MONDAY/ 1.4030/ 1.4110/ 1.4110 TUESDAY/ 1.4110/ 1.4030/ 1.4030 WEDNESDAY/ 1.4030/ 1.4110/ 1.4190 THURSDAY/ 1.4110/ 1.3950/ 1.3950 FRIDAY/ 1.3950/ - still on going - As you can see, EU always open/close just somewhere around the PW that is recommended by this system. Wednesday (01/07/2009) was the highest ranging market (160pips) but the price was still closing 80pips away from its opening of the day. How we can benefit from this PW? Simply use higher time frame stochastic behaviour (H1 and H4) to predict the market direction , and then use the 515 Strategy (as per this sytem is all about) to make our perfect entry. Just remember this - The market will not always open/close at this system's PW all the time. But most of the time, it does. And when it does, use this opportunity to bank loads of potential pips by placing your order at the PW or somewhere nearby it. This strategy however, only suit for those who prefer the Trailing Stops strategy (open position trading). Any comment/question is most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Hi all... Alright...as per D1 , the uptrending market is still in control...but it is a weak uptrend since the stochastic is heading down. In H4 , we can see the price already break below 200SMA and hardly testing the 89SMA . If the Channel couldn't hold the price, it is a possible to the downside now. As per H1, the next nearest PW the price can go down is 1.3950 and we still have to wait and see if the bearish market is in the way, then PW 1.3870 should be the next level for the price to sit at.

Hi all... There is only 1 red flag calendar for today, and just a little news ahead. So, I will not expect too much activities (movement) in the market today. However, I will always update my review here later today. Happy trading....

Hello all... If the entry is made based on 5m stochastic signal, so far today we can get 5 signals. For this type of rules, this 5 entries can give us 50pips easily as per 10p SL/TP rules . All the signals are the SWING HIGH signals as the market is bias to the downside, which mean we should only favour for the SHORT for now. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #110 ---
Hello all... Let us see the market in the simplest way we could:- D1 Price already deny the Channel and obviously the downtrend is about to take charge in the market right now. However, also be aware that Daily stochastic is @ SWING LOW level around 50SMA . Don't be too happy about SELLING the pair. H4 Stochastic also @ SWING LOW level here. The bearish market can keep on coming or could also paused for a while here. But, we are still bias to the downside. H1 Stochastic behaviour = H4 = SWING LOW level. Alright, for now if the theory is right then the market will paused for a while here and rebounce a little bit before the TC happening again. As usual, use lower TF (15m and 5m) to play with the market. The higher TF charts are only our guide. Note:- Pay attention to Price Wave 1.3870 today.... HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #111 ---
Hi all... Let's make a quick review here:- H4 As I said yesterday, we need to pay attention to PW 1.3870 , and yes...the price did make a rebounce @ stochastic SWING LOW . Right now, it seems the price is about to make a TC pattern against the current resistant, which is 21EMA and 89SMA as the stochastic @ SWING HIGH level now. If the price and the stochastic in agreement, favour the SHORT position today!!! H1 This is easy to watch. Let just wait what will happen when the stochastic is making SWING HIGH in this TF. Again, favour the SHORT position. Always use the lower TF (15m and 5m) to make your entry as per this system is all about. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Hello all... As per this system...so far there are 3 signals to make our entries since the opening of the day. 2 SHORT entry signals and 1 LONG entry signal (see vertical lines). Using 20SL/TP rules (entry based on both 15m and 5m swing high/low) for these 3 signals, we can easily get 60pips from these moves. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Hi all... Here is a very rare case but I will never miss this trade ( SHORT ) if I am online. Today (07/07/2009) has the best example on how we can make our entry using 20p SL with open position and trailing stops strategy. Below are the steps:- (Note:- The orange vertical line is the signal candle) H4 Signal candle closed @ 50SMA and PW 1.4030 as stochastic already swinging down. Nice SHORT signal. H1 The signal candle closed below 200SMA / PW 1.4030 as the stochastic also making the SWING HIGH . Very nice SHORT signal. M15 Here the the signal candle also also agree with the higher TF (H1 and H4) as the stochastic making the SWING HIGH. Also look at the momentum (in yellow) that is already at the peak and it is anticipated to get colder once it reach this level. M5 This is where we make entry. The signal candle is 3rd bar in 15m TF. Entry is made @ the opening of next candle of 5m (also the opening of 15m candle). The stochastic/ RSI /momentum are all in the "overbought" level here. Just SELL...!!! Using these steps, you can possibly bank 80pips if you are brave enough to wait the price touching the PW 1.3950 below it. But you need to consider the stochatic-price theory and this system's rules before you deciding to take the risk. THIS IS HOW THIS SYSTEM WORK AT IT BEST...!!!

Hi all... Alright...let's make this simple and easy to understand:- (Note:- the market on 07/07/2009 closed @ orange vertical line) H4 Yesterday (07/07/2009) the price closed just above around 20p++ above the PW 1.3870 and as what we can see from the chart below, maybe we'll see a little rebounce around this Price Wave later today. The elipse area ( PW 1.4030 ) is a level we must remember where the stochastic making the SWING HIGH yesterday. H1 Momentum is already @ it lowest so we are expecting the rebounce is on the card right now. The price still couldn't close above the 8EMA and the downtrend still seems dominant. However, since we are expecting the little rebounce here, and if we want to do the CT (Counter Trade), make sure the lower TF (15m and 5m) rules is always applied.

Hello all... Alright...just as I predicted earlier today...that the little rebounce @ PW 1.3870 is just happened (See the vertical orange line as per chart below).

Hello all... Let us see what we have for today:- D1 Yesterday (08/07/2009) the price resisted @ 50SMA and closed just few pips below PW 1.3870 . So far, the stochastic still in the SWING LOW level so wait and see how long this stochastic can hold its position later on today. H4 This is easy. Let us wait and see for a TC somewhere @ 21EMA if the stochastic made it to SWING HIGH level. H1 Stochastic on SWING HIGH level and 50SMA is a potential area for a TC to the downside move.

Hi all... This the first signal ( orange vertical line) using both 15m and 5m stochastic SWING HIGH signals. As per 15m, the price also found resistance somewhere below 50SMA (H1) which is considered a very good reason to SHORT this pair at the openig of the next 5m candle (also the opening of the next 15m candle). Using 20p SL/TP rules, this is another EASY and CONVINCING 20p profit. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Hello again to all.... The market has been bullish for the 1/4 trading day today. As per charts below, it seems the H4 stochastic very dominant and still on its way up to make its SWING HIGH level. Since the market move upward too fast, I anticipating that the price soon will find resistance somewhere @ 89SMA / fib 76.4%. As per H1, the stochastic seems "adjusting" itself with the H4's stochastic and perhaps we might see some SHT opportunity here soon. Maybe, PW 1.3950 and 1.3870 are where the market will move around for today. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Hello all... Here is another nice example of the latest signal ( orange vertical line) for SHORT entry ( blue vertical line @ 5m). This is a multi TF technique.

Hello all... It seems the market made a very strong rebounce yesterday...and the H4 stochastic is really2 dominant with the market price. And as usual, the price found resistance @ H4 stochastic SWING HIGH around PW 1.4030 . Right now, it is rested @ fib 76.4% . (Watching it closely, it is really nice to know that we can find the market rhythm using H4 stochastic. We can at least roughly estimate how high/low the market can go everyday) Currently, the H1 stochastic is making SWING LOW and it is not in agreement with the H4 stochastic behaviour. Always remember that the H4 is the dominant here. So, I just expecting a little rebounce here before the price retrace to PW 1.3950 . Overall, as per D1 stochastic , the market might retest the upper Channel and I think it will be some bullish sentiment soon. Comments/question are most welcome.

Hello all... Earlier today...I have mentioned about the H4 stochastic behaviour is really2 dominant to the market rhythm. As per chart below, it seems that the price already break below PW 1.3950 and move down so fast according to the stohastic so far(in complete agreement) The evening star candle (in blue triangle) that closed somewhere @ PW 1.4030 with long upper wick against the upper Channel is another strongest factor to show that the previous SWING HIGH of the stochastic of H4 must be considered seriously as a SHORT signal. Next stop should be PW 1.3870. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Hello all... It seems the downtrending market is probably begin to take control. Let us look our charts here:- D1 Loads of resistance from MAs since the opening of today. Also, stochastic seems to swing downside reacting to the PA vs MAs. H4 Long bearish candle against the 50SMA ! This could be a strong sign for downtrending market. We'll have to wait and see until the opening of Euro session later on today. H1 Nice PA in orange rectangular (Evening Star) against the 365EMA (nearby H4's 50SMA ) as the stochastic also making SWING HIGH in this area. Currently, the stochastic @ H1 is in SWING LOW level. So we might see a little bit of ranging market earlier today. Hopefully, we'll have a clearer direction during the Euro and US sessions today. As usual, use 515 Eurofighter Strategy rules to make fine entry, regardless it is for LONG/SHORT . Personally, I favour SELLING for today. Your comments/questions are most welcome.

Hi all... Since we are using the 515 Strategy, it is very important to know what the market is doing in 5m and 15m charts.

Hello all... Here is a quick update for my overview earlier today:- H4 50SMA is the strongest resistance for EU today. The previous 3 candles since the opening of today's market are all closing below this MA. See the rectangular...!!! H1 Nice SWING LOW and SWING HIGH as per two elipses in the chart. However, the signal of the day would be the orange vertical line, where the price found resistance against 200SMA a nd fib 76.4% as the stochastic making the SWING HIGH. A very probablity trade that we should not missed...!!! 15M This is where we make the entry. The orange vertical line (the signal) is the last 15m candle before the H1 candle is closing. With the stochastic @ SWING HIGH and also the momentum that is ready to off the peak, this the best signal that we must catch. Fine entry for SHORT by using 5m TF with 20p SL/TP strategy should giving us loads of pips, convincingly and easily. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Hi all... Before I go to my bed and dreaming...here is another lesson of the day. Simple. Look at the orange vertical line in 5m . You might consider it is a SHORT signal as the stochastic making SWING HIGH . However, for this case it is very easy to identify that this signal is a FALSE SIGNAL since the 15m stochastic and momentum are on their way to the UPSIDE . So, no agreement between 5m and 15m means FALSE SIGNAL. Comments/questions are most welcome. (Note: As per H1, the dash TL and the light grey elipse are the area that which I think becoming the temporary support area) HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Hello all... I received e-mail from investopedia.com which I think I should share to all of you here. It is really related to this system rules/strategy. "Typically, using three different periods gives a broad enough reading on the market - using fewer than this can result in a considerable loss of data, while using more typically provides redundant analysis. When choosing the three time frequencies, a simple strategy can be to follow a "rule of four". This means that a medium-term period should first be determined and it should represent a standard as to how long the average trade is held. From there, a shorter term time frame should be chosen and it should be at least one-fourth the intermediate period (for example, a 15-minute chart for the short-term time frame and 60-minute chart for the medium or intermediate time frame). Through the same calculation, the long-term time frame should be at least four times greater than the intermediate one (so, keeping with the previous example, the 240-minute, or four-hour, chart would round out the three time frequencies)." Click the link below for the rest of the info. http://investopedia.com/articles/for...ner=fxweekly7b Hope this explains why I have the multiple time frames strategy in this system.

Sorry Orange and rest of forum fellows for being away for so long. Well it seems alot of you are gettin well through the system and i m glad . Well for last couple of week i have been tryin and back testing this system on Daily and 4Hr charts and i am happy that it works the same way as it does with 15 and 5 min charts. Now all the rules are almost same except that you might have to keep sl arnd 80pips or so, but i am very much sure tht you will in return get arnd 80 pips in one move. well presently i m in a trade since yesterday and lets hope how it end up. if u look at daily and 4hr stoch, the are both headed down, that means making swing high. Now the entry point should be when 4hr has finished it swing high or swing low. Avoid entering while its flat up there or down there. You need to wait for it to take a direction after makin a swing. Now why i m sayin tht is because in higher TF you need to a bit more carefull with timings of entry. but once you have entered then jus relax and wait for your target, Now how much should the target be. i suggest 80 pips but its not necessary. You can go with trailing stops. Now if u open up ur MT and look at 4hr stoch. observe how the 4hr stoch been makin complete swings. and thts the point which impressed me. you might be in your trade for a day or two at max but u will get your profit. Now there is another thing which i learned from orange was the importance of 50 sma on 4Hr. well i backtested this also and realized that the best place to enter is when the price is away from 50 sma and stoch is makin either swing high or low. the price will always move back to touch 50 sma in 4hr chart. According to phillip the price usually came back to touch 21 ema. but what orange figured out was also correct tht it always does come back to touch 50 sma. But u should enter in accordance with stoch high or low swings. Look at you charts, draw a 50 sma on 4hr. observe how price moves away and comes back to 50 sma. use swing low or high of stoch for entry. I hope this further extension to orange system will be of great advantage to those who can sit infront of computers for long. If you have any queries or question do ask.

Hello all... Let us see what we can predict for the market today:- D1 Simply put, the market seems a bit sideways for the last few days and MAYBE the price will be testing the upper Channel very hard today. H4 The price found resistance @ 50SMA for almost the entire day yesterday (see blue triangle) before it finally break above it and closed higher. However, the stochastic right now giving the SWING HIGH signal with the PA is also resisted against the 200SMA / 89SMA / fib 76.4% area. If I am right, and if the price in sync with the stochastic, we might see the retracement from this region later today. H1 Here is why the MTF strategy is very important. The stochastic is about to make its SWING LOW and we can estimate that probably the little rebounce will happen somewhere @ PW 1.3950 (Price Wave - another important subject in this sytem). Personally, I will favour to SHORT for today because the H4 stochastic is very dominant so far. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Hello Orange, how are you my friend, its great to see you have taken the 4h rules and incorporated them into your own style and rhythm. I see Arslan also here so it's great to see you guys here. I looked at your system and I am going to study it more during the next week. From what I see is that it is similar to the rules of the 4H price movement but as you said, it gives you much more chances to enter and possible to get 50 to 80 pips a day. I have since been studying the 5 min price action to be able to give me more opportunities to trade during the day. From what I have seen on the charts, please correct me if I am wrong............this system is great in ranging markets where you can establish trend lines and trading off of them..........I have noticed that when it is in a strong trend, sometime we get the right signal but because the trend is so strong the move is as strong according to our stochastics and thus might turn into a loss. Ranging markets where price is up and down, using the stochastics gives you a very high probability of pips. something I noticed on the charts that the system is great for ranging periods and that is exactly what I have been looking for as well to incorporate a ranging system with the macd trending system. anyways hope to contribute when I can here and great to see you guys. Great job orange

Hello... As I mentioned earlier today, the H4 stochastic is very dominant with the PA. If you see the elipse area , the price testing the upper side of the Channel very hard and it is eventually give up and move away from it right now. Significantly, this area is where the stochastic is making its SWING HIGH , whichis a very high probablity trade as there are also 200SMA , 89SMA , fib 76.4% and the upper side of the Channel that become resistance to the price. A very2 nice place to find SHORT signal . Fine SHORT entry using the 515 Strategy and Rules will definitely give you a very good timing entry with tight SL. As per H1 , the next area we must always watch are the PW 1.3950 and the temporary support TL (dash line) below it. If the market break below these levels, maybe we will see a very strong bearish market again soon. As in this system, the orange vertical line in both 15m and 5m TF would be the best SHORT signal of the day. This is because both the stochastic and momentum (in yellow) are at their peak and this is definitely giving a strong prediction that the retracement would happened next, which it eventually did. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Hello traders... Yesterday's market was a little bit tricky for most of us. So, let us see how it will do today:- D1 8EMA , 21EMA and 50SMA are still bunch up together in this TF right now. This is a very critical scenario as the price also keep really2 tight between this MAs and the upper side of the Channel , which I think will be tested very2 hard again today, and probably the price will break above it if the stochastic maintain its domination to the PA. H4 The stochastic didn't made it through all the way to the downside as the price also supported by the temporary TL (see green arrow) below it. 50SMA is already become the immediate support now and the upper side of the Channel is on the threat. H1 As we can see, the stochastic already making SWING HIGH and we might see some retracement here later on. Loads of MAs bunch up together below the price and so far I don't see any reason why they cannot support EU for the time being. Well, I think we are bias to the upper side right now. I will neither favouring SHORT/LONG for today . We will have to wait and see until the opening of Euro session to get stronger signal. Playing with the lower TF is always much better right now. That's what the 515 Eurofighter Sytem is all about. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

When this happened, sometime we missed/overlook something. The system is about using 5m and 15m (stochastic vs PA) as our entry signal. However, at the same time me must also know what are the higher TF (H1 and H4) doing. That is why as per Post #1, we have MTF Stretegies. They are:- 1) H1-M15-M5 (primary); &amp; 2) D1-H4-H1 (seconday); While the MTF #1 strategy is the "zoom in" version for the price emotion and we used these TFs to take advantage from every little "tick" that occurs inside them. This is why this TFs is the primary and this is what the 515 Strategy all about. The MTF #2 strategy is basically used for us identifying (predicting) the mid-term market trend. Hope this helps.

Alright all...here we go:- Per charts below, the price already break above the downtrend Channel as I ancticipated earlier today. However, I still keep it together with the temporay support TL (see green arrow). I WILL REMOVE THEM FROM MY CHART ONCE THEY ARE NO LONGER USEFULL. And I also make a new uptrend Channel . Let us see if the previous high (see resitance indy @ 1.4072 ) will be the next SWING HIGH for H4's stochastic . Comments/questions are most welcome.

Hello all... After the BREAKOUT , we should know that favouring the LONG entry signal is the best. As per 5m chart below, the orange vertical line is the first nice signal for the day. Both stochastic and momentum are at their lowest here as the price found support somewhere @ 21EMA of 15m TF. Nice + easy 10p profit as per 10p SL/TP rules (entry that based on 5m stochastic signal only). HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

I will test it. Which mt4 broker gives the best results for this EA?

--- 帖子 #158 ---
The broker is not the big issue here, but I use Ibfx since its MT4 has GMT offset @ Zero and it still use 4 decimal pricing. All the best to you... You can ask me anytime if you have any question.

--- 帖子 #159 ---
Let us look at the 5m chart below. It is very important to favour only 1 direction during a fast trending like market such as now. During a fast trending market, which in this case is an uptrending market, the price is hardly close below 21EMA . Most of the time, it will be only riding above the 10EMA ( Vice versa if the market downtrending very fast). If you missed the entry in the beginning of the trend, simply wait the next SWING LOW in 5m stochastic to make your entry (see the orange vertical line) as per chart below. It shows that the price found support @ 50SMA . Another easy profit to be taken into your bag. This should be very easy to understand. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome.

Be prepared for this SWING HIGH of H4 stochastic. Look at the PA against the PW 1.4110. The PA in H1 also giving some sign of rteracement. Use lwer TFs (15m and 5m) if you wish to do the CT trade here. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Hello... Before I go to bed, please take a look at my H4 chart as below. There are 2 rectangulars shown here which I think that the price pattern in rectangular #2 might repeat the same pattern as rectangular #1. If the stochastic will make its SWING HIGH and the PA in sync with it...we will see some nice retracement here, where we can do some great Counter Trend (CT) trade to take advantage from this situation. Also, please take note that loads of resistance TLs above the price right now. This could be very fun. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

I'm sorry for the all the troubles. Here it is

--- 帖子 #170 ---
Hello all... Here what I can see for the market today:- D1 The price is riding above the 50SMA , and it is definitely an uptrending market right now. However, watch over the resistance TLs above it as well. H4 As I said in my last post yesterday ( post #167 ) the similar pattern is now occurs in the rectangulars #2 . The stochastic did make the SWING HIGH exactly @ the PW 1.4110 (see the spinner candle inside the box ) and the price respecting the resistance TLs at this area. A very nice place to do the CT trade. H1 Stochastic at SWING LOW level right now but per H4 , I still anticipating that the rebounce will be somewhere around the aqua region here. Watch the PW 1.4030 for the TC upside move for today. The uptrending is back in control, but I predict that we will maybe see another ranging period soon since there are loads of resistance from the upper side of the price. Use lower TFs (515 Strategy) for this tricky market. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #171 ---
Alright... As per post #167 , I would then favour for any SHORT entry that is possible. Since the 15m stochastic didn't give so much great signals after the retracement from PW 1.4110 , the only thing I can do is refering to the 5m stochastic SWING HIGH signal. The orange vertical lines as per chart below are the examples of SHORT entry signal using the 10p SL/TP strategy and rules (signal is only based on 5m stochastic SWING HIGH/LOW ). I would also considering SHORT entries at 2 rectangulars here since most of the time (and from my own experience) the price resisted @ 50SMA during the retracement. Overall, 70pips is already in hand from all these signals. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Make up your mind where you're gonna post and post there. Just quit spammin the EU thread for viewers for this thread. You're the only guy in FF that does that sort of thing, it's lame and it's really getting old.

If anybody is interested in your thread, they'll read it and if they're not... you'll have to deal with it, but spammin the EU thread or any other thread is not cool and will get you more of the kind of attention you don't want.... In case you still don't get it, "cut and paste" links, or whatever you call it needs to stop. This is the "polite" version.

Alright... This is a very quick update here:- We have seen the H4 stochastic move down very fast so far but the price still seems to be supported by the 8EMA . If I am right, price will revisit the PW 1.4110 and probably will retest the resistance TLs very hard again later today. Just wait and see.

I have a very simple definition of an uptrending/downtrending market. If the price stay above 50SMA , it will be the uptrending market. Vice versa for a downtrending market. As such, during an uptrending market right now, I really like to open my other chart which is much more simplified from what we have in this system. No Trend Lines and no other MAs . I only have Equidistant Channel , 50SMA and fibonacci levels in my H4 chart as below. At least, I have a little relaxing chart for my eyes once in a while.... As we all know, the market moves in wave. So, during a trending market I will closely watching what the Price Action (PA) vs Stochastic are doing when the market reach @ certain Price Wave . When I feel "something" is going on, then I will go back to the original method as per the system in this thread. As per chart below, you can also clearly see what happened to the market when the price reach at certain PW. Sometime it will ignore the PW, but most of the time "something" is always happening. Simply put, the PW are like stairs . You can do your own research yourself if you feel doubtful about it. So, this is just another way for me to read the market emotion.

The previous candle with long upper wick (see blue rectangular) closed below the resistance TL. This should be a signal candle that telling us some retracement will occurs again later on. However, the stochastic behaviour also showing that the price might get a little support from PW 1.4110 for now. Price still have the potential to test the TL very hard once again. Not a very good situation to trade, since the lower TFs stochastics are still looking for agreement to each other. Bias to the upper side though...but a bumpy ride...

Hey! AMAZING AMAZING thread, all the pictures explain so much. Just so confused as to is there an EA or you all doing manually? Ive looked at all of them in metaeditor but all just indicators?

Hi all... Yesterday was a really tough market for us. Towards this weekend, let us see how EU will do today:- D1 The uptrending market is very obvious right now but I'm afraid the TLs (see THICKER TLs) above it will become a great resistance for this pair. Plus, stochastic @ SWING HIGH level now. So, be alert for the swing down that could happened anytime for any reason. H4 At current situation, the stochastic behaviour showing that the price get a strong support from 8EMA and PW 1.4110 . The temporary TL (see arrow ) is now very vulnerable this time and I think it won't last long soon since the damage also has been done in the previous candles. H1 See the elipse area where the price get support from 50SMA (the most important MA in this system). The stochastic seems agree with it and barely touch the level 20 before it go for the swing up. We are bias to the upside for today. That's what I can see now. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Doesn't looks good. The stochastic and momentum not in sync earlier. Reminding me the False Signal lesson .

Earlier today...the SHORT entry @ orange vertical line was not a good one...price revisit 50SMA @ 15m once again (see elipse ) and we might pull out our trade when this happening. However...since the dominant stochastic is come from h4 stochastic behaviour (which is heading down at the moment), 20p profit is already in hand right now. Quite a tough trade...but it is a profitable still... HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Let us straight to the point:- H4 The orange vertical line is the signal candle for today. At this point, the momentum is about to off the peak and the stochastic is testing its own support TL (see the blue TL ) . 8EMA and PW 1.4110 are surely on the threat...and it when the next candle make its move to the downside. H1 I always said that the H4 stochastic is the dominant factor in the price movement. Here, the stochastic in this TF seems wanted to go up, and yet it just manage to go half way since the momentum is on the way down and because of the H4 stochastic factor. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #208 ---
This is another subject that I think you should mastering in. So here it is:- Like the price, stochastic also has its own TL (see the chart below). It is important to know what you can expect from this stochastic's TL. Unlike the TL for the price, stochastic TL is just a temporary guide . I only draw this in my H4 because it is the most dominant stochastic in a single trading day. By this stochastic TL, I can at least predicting that what the price will do @ certain level...as example in this case...if the stochastic rebounce @ its TL, the price will get support somewhere @ 21EMA . And if the stochastic break below the TL, the next support level for the price is PW 1.4030. Study this carefully. Comments/questions are most welcome.

Hello... It was a very2 tough trading day on last Friday (17/07/2009). So, let us see what can we predict on Monday (20/07/2009). D1 Uptrending market is still in control but I'm afraid it won't last that long since the stochastic is already @ its SWING HIGH level. Be cautious... H4 Stochastic rebounce @ its own Sup TL (see triangle ) and this mean that MAYBE we will see the price testing the Res TL (see arrow ) on Monday. However, the momentum is heading down so becareful for every signal that produced by both of these indys. One of them would be false signal sometime. H1 Stochastic is now NOSE DIVING but I am thinking the ellipse area is where the next rebounce will happened (somewhere around 21EMA @ H4 or 89SMA ). We'll see how it goes tomorrow.

Hey Orange, Thanks for your contributions to the forums, I don't trade your method but I have been watching it for a while. I was going through the list of indicators you use on your template and noticed multiple instances of the same indicators being used with the same settings but just placed solely separate timeframes. Do you have a reason for this? It would be much easier to just have the indicator visible on all timeframes and this will use less resources for folks like myself who look at many pairs at the same time. Maybe i'm missing different settings for each timeframe but they look identical. (im only commenting on Stoc, Momentum, RSI and RSI Bar settings) You put forward great effort in maintaining this thread, keep up the good work! If I get the energy to post, i'll post every now and again when I see some sort of setup. Have a great day, Luke

--- 帖子 #224 ---
Hello hndymann, First of all...Thanks a lot for your respond. I have the same setting for Stoch, Momentum, RSI and RSI Bar in all TFs . And their setting are STANDARD SETTING . I don't change anything in these indys' setting. For example, standard setting for stochastic = 5;3;3 . That's it. For RSI = 14 . That's it. The reason is very simple. In my theory and as what I learned from the others before this, stochastic from the higher TF dominate the stochastic from the lower TF . So, it is very important to have them in agreement to each other before we can consider to take the signal. Please remember that this system is only designed for EU pair (I don't trade other pairs). If you have enough interest into this sytem, go through all the lessons/examples in this thread. I'm sure you'll finally understand how to use each of these indys (especially stochastic and momentum ) as your entry signal. Hope this is a good answer for you...and all the best

--- 帖子 #225 ---
Alrigt... I will make this very2 simple and easy to understand:- D1 ALERT: Stochastic seems in a "SWING HIGH" behaviour now. Keeping LONG position is not really a good idea for now. H4 Price are now testing Res TL (see ellipse ) very hard after the stochastic made its rebounce (see triangle )- great agreement between price and stochastic in this TF. Be cautious... H1 See triangle - Stochastic making Double Top (DT). Should be the retracement on the price afterwards. Use the helps form 15m and 5m TFs for more sensitive market behaviour. Hope this helps.

Alright... As per H4 below...the 1st Res TL has been broken (see rectangular ). I think retracement (pull over) is about to happen as the price is a bit too much of bullish since it is now testing the next Res TL and way above the Channel (see ellipse ). Both stochastic and momentum are also in extremely SWING HIGH together (whic is rarely happened in H4). Per the theory, this is a VERY HIGH PROBABLITY of SHORT signal. Use the 515 Strategy and Rules to SELL this pair and since the market is in strong uptrending, making a CT trade is very much risky. The primary MTF strategy (H1-M15-M5) is very critical in this case. I prefer to wait the H4 candle closed first before before I use this strategy. Hope this helps.

This is the first signal of the day which I consider a very nice ones. Let us see how do we enter here @ orange vertical lines:- See the ellipse in 15m TF . The candle making long tail against 50SMA and finally closed above 21EMA . This showing us the price get its strong support from both MAs. Meanwhile, stochastic is seems going down but the momentum does not agree with it. So, we need to go to lower TF to tackle this problem. See again the ellipse in 5m TF . These 3 candles equal to 1 candle (the one which marked with ellipse in 15m TF) of 15m. This is where we get the entry signal. Stochastic already making SWING LOW and the momentum is about to off the ground. The orange vertical line is the last candle of 5m before the 15m candle is closed. A very great entry can be made here or the next candle of 5m. Using 20p SL/TP rules and strategy , this entry is definitely a winning trade...!!! Study this... Comments/questions are most welcome.

Hi all... I have updated mt Equidistant Channel and remove one of the Res TL which has been broken already. Please check the template as per attacthed below. D1 I'm still be very2 cautious for the SWING HIGH stochastic here. It could stay there for few days or may turning down at anytime for any reason. H4 Pullback @ orange vertical line after both of the stochastic and momentum at SWING HIGH level. Price currently find support from 8EMA (see rectangular ). The Res TL (see arrow ) might be tested very hard again today. H1 See ellipse . Price get its support exactly @ PW 1.4190 then make a little bounce now. Also, see the orange vertical line where both the stochastic and momentum making SWING HIGH before the pullback happened (the same behaviours with in H4 ). We are still bias to the upside move right now and we might see the market visiting the PW 1.4270 once the price manage to break above the current Res TL. Comments/questions are most welcome.

Hi all...see the rectangular The first two h4 candles of the day are both open/close above the 8EMA . The recent candle is also open above this MA. This PA however doesn't go in sync with the stochastic (diving position). So we might see a battle between Res TL and 8EMA / PW 1.4190 today. This is really fun to watch...

Hello all... A new Res TL is made (R2) today. So please get the latest template as per attached below. Let's us see what we have for today :- D1 As I mentioned yesterday (21/07/2009), the stochastic is @ SWING HIGH and the price is just hardly to go up furthermore. See triangle as the stochastic is swinging down right now. H4 See ellipse . Long upper wick candle and still closed below R1 and nearby the PW 1.4190 . Great resistance by R1 ...!!!! It is a false breakout against the R1 as the price resisted @ upper side ot the Channel and PW 1.4270 (this is where a new Res TL - R2 is made). R1 will be tested again as if both the stochastic and price rebounce later today. H1 Currenty, both the stochastic and momentum is heading up as the price is likely to retest the R1 . Just wait and see what will happened once the Euro session begin. We are bias to the downside today. However, we should be very carefull especially when the price is nearby the TLs and PWs. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Hi again...this is the latest update for today:- H4 See rectangular . The previous 4 candles open/close below/at 8EMA . This MA become the immediate resistance right now. However, also see how the 21EMA supporting the price right now. If the D1 become very dominant today, MAYBE we will see the price visiting the PW 1.4110 by today. H1 Price get loads of support from 89SMA but the stochastic is adjusting itself to the downside. PW 1.4190 has become the platform the price for quite sometime already. It won't hold anyway. We are bias to the downside move today. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Blue vertical line for SHORT signal using 20p SL/TP rules and strategy... Nice one....!!!! Study this... Comments/questions are most welcome....

--- 帖子 #239 ---
See the blue vertical line. Both stochastic and momentum are already at their SWING HIGH position. This is another great example of SHORT SIGNAL and a very high probablity trade using the 10p SL/TP rules . However, this signal is the beginning of the bearish movement in the market. Too bad, we can't really sure this would be the big move to the downside since we couldn't get it from higher TFs such as H1 and H4. A very nice one...still...!!!ummmppphhhh...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

--- 帖子 #240 ---
The bear is looking to control now...as I predicted earlier today.... As the stochastic @ D1 become very2 dominant to the downside move today, it is also very significant to momentum @ H4 going to the same direction (see triangle ) pretty fast right now to catch up with the H4 stochastic . The correlation between this two indys become very important to this system especially when we use the 515 entry Strategy and Rules . In H1 , price is hardly supported by the 89SMA and I think that it will be break below anyway later today. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #241 ---
It should be somewhere around here (see ellipse ). Get ready with the 20p SL/TP stategy . Comments/questions are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #242 ---
Hello all... I'll make this very2 short, simple and easy to understand:- D1 Stochastic is still going down and the bear market is not over yet. However, the momentum is likely pushing up and sopprting the price from falling furthermore to balance the market. H4 Price rebouncing nicely (see ellipse ) against the 21EMA as the stochastic rebounce off its TL (see triangle ). However, the Res TL (see arrow )still pressuring the price from above. H1 Nice Evening Doji Star pattern (see ellipse ) for the retracement move as the stochastic making its SWING HIGH here. Price still have strong support from 89SMA right now. I will say we are in sideways move now. If D1 stochastic can regain its domination, we will see a bearish movement later today. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #243 ---
See the blue verticle line. This one is a very nice signal based on 20p SL/TP strategy. Stochastic from both TFs are in agreement. Stronger SHORT signal produced by the momentum from 5m TF as it is @ SWING HIGH level. For sure, 20p profit if SHORT from this signal...!!!!

--- 帖子 #244 ---
Hi again... Here is the update:- H4 See ellipse . A nice PA against the PW 1.4270 and Res TL pointed in arrow . A very familiar reversal signal to most of us.. H1 See ellipse . The reversal is also supported by stochastic SWING HIGH behaviour. MAYBE, we will be seeing the 50SMA and/or 89SMA working very hard today to support the price. However, I'm bias to the downside for today. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #245 ---
See rectangular : Let us see if the price might get a little support from 50SMA and/or 89SMA here...at least for few hours...

--- 帖子 #246 ---
See ellipse for SHORT signal.

--- 帖子 #247 ---
As per 15m, now I'm expecting some rebounce at rectangular . Note: Momentum @ 15m already @ its lowest...!!!

--- 帖子 #248 ---
Very unlikey to happen...price in fast downtrending now....

--- 帖子 #249 ---
here we go now.........let us see if it rebounce or not this time...

--- 帖子 #250 ---
it is really2 bearish now...

--- 帖子 #251 ---
Hello all... Friday is a very2 fun (and sometime could be very2 dangerous too) trading day. So here we go:- D1 Stochastic swinging down very fast this week and yet the price still hang on to 8EMA . This is simple now...obviously the uptrending market is still in control...but it is a shaky control however. H4 See ellipse as where the price retest the upper Res TL again before it finally give up and move to the downside and supported @ 50SMA (the most important MA in this system). Stochastic breaking below its TL and I ope to see some rebounce here later today if the temporary TL (see arrow ) could hold the price from falling furthermore. H1 Price rebounce @ 89SMA (see ellipse ) before it resisted at the upper Res TL and going south with the 200SMA and the temporary TL is the immediate support from this TF right now. We might see the price ranging between PW 1.4110 to PW 1.4190 today if the market "sleepy and lazy". As per D1 stochastic , we are still bias to the downside today but becarefull with the rebounce as the stochastic in H4 is in the SWING LOW region right now. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #252 ---
A little change in my TL. Here it is the latest template.

--- 帖子 #253 ---
H4 See ellipse (long tail doji). Nice PA against the 50SMA showing this MA supporting the price right now. Maybe a little rebounce here...of this could also maybe a beginning of another strong rhythm to the upside...we will see that later on today. H1 If I am right, the rectangular is where the TC to the downside will take place. This is based on this TF stochastic . However, be wary of the momentum as it is at the lowest region now. I'm still bias to the downside. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #254 ---
Here we go...TC downside or not?

--- 帖子 #255 ---
See rectangular . A possible Morning Doji Star pattern and this pair might go bullish when the Euro session open later on. Carefull wiht the EMAs and Res TL.

--- 帖子 #256 ---
Rectangular: It should be here for 10p SL/TP Strategy and Rules

--- 帖子 #257 ---
LONG entry somewhere here ( ellipse ) can already give 10p profit so easily as both stochastic and momentum @ their SWING LOW level just now. Nice one...!!! Note: The reason of using 10p SL/TP Strategy and Rules is because I only use signal from 5m TF. Plus, I'm very aware of the Res TL above it. So, 10p profit should be fine.

--- 帖子 #258 ---
See ellipse . Spinner candle against the Res TL showing some resistance here meanwhile the stochastic also already making its SWING HIGH . However, be aware of momentum from below. Either this indy will catch up the stochastic and push the price higher, or the stochastic will catch up with the momentum and drag the price lower with it. Both are possible now. I'm still bias for bearish market now. Use lower TF (15m and 5m) to decide your entry. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #259 ---
See ellipse . This candle will close around 2hrs from now. If it is a spinner/doji during its closing...use lower TF Strategy (H1-M15-M5) to favour for the SHORT . If not, just go for scalping method. Always use the 515 Strategy for a better entry. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #260 ---
See rectangular in the indy window. Momentum catching up the stochastic but only manage to push the price a little higher....ready for SHORT signal now. Note: SHORT for CT trade is however risky...becareful now

--- 帖子 #261 ---
This is the H1-M15-M5 TF strategy example:- Vertical line is where I expecting the price might retrace earlier and the ellipse area is where we should wait for the right entry. It is a doji (mean pausing) as the stochastic and momentum are at their SWING HIGH position already. Using 20p SL/TP strategy is definitely safe and 20p profit is surely in hand. Nice one...!!!! Comments/questions are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #262 ---
See ellipse and vertical line. A nd also relate it with the stochastic and momentum behaviour when the price reach this PW . I will never missed a great signal such as this and I might let my position unlock to grab as many pips as I can from this move. If the 20p SL/TP strategy and rules is used here, the 20p profit is already guaranteed.

--- 帖子 #263 ---
Hello all... I'll make it very simple for today's view:- D1 Uptrending is still in control. Just becarefull with the Res TL above it. H4 Last week, we have been watching the market ranging very tightly around 160pips (between PW 1.4110 and PW 1.4270 ). 50SMA also supported the price very well during last week. If I'm right, we'll see the price testing the Res TL (see arrow ) very hard once again...and probably will break above it too. H1 Nice long tail spinner candle (see ellipse ) against the PW 1.4190 . This TF is another supportive analysis for the uptrending market. Immediate resistance @ PW 1.4270 for now. I'm bias to the upside today. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #264 ---
Very nice LONG signal (see vertical line ) earlier today. Entry to be made after the signal using 5m TF. The stochastic in both TF are in agreement...plus the momentum in 5m are @ its lowest. Very high probablity trade for this one...!!! For this kind of signal, using the 20p SL/TP strategy and rules is surely a profitable trade. Comments/questions are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #265 ---
H4 Price already break above Res TL (see ellipse ) and PW 1.4270 . Be cautious with this because it might be a false breakout as the stochastic is already @ SWING HIGH level. H1 As per stochastic, price might retrace to at least 21EMA here before it will make the TC upside price pattern. This is another reason why the previous breakout as per H4 might be a false one. We are still bias to the upside though. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #266 ---
See vertical line for LONG signal. Using 10p SL/TP strategy and rules , this one is guranteed for another easy 10p profit. Study this...

--- 帖子 #267 ---
See rectangular in H1 . The recent candle will be closed in 10mins time. If the pattern in this box is going to be the 3 OUTSIDE DOWN PATTERN (highly reliable bearish reversal signal) when the recent candle is closed, I will be very2 doubtfull to consider the LONG SIGNAL in the 15m SWING LOW stochastic right now. My point here is, the H1 and 15m are not in agreement . So, this is either you want to take the risk or give it a miss for this one. There is always another opportunity to come though... Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #268 ---
H1 Rectangular : 3 OUTSIDE DOWN PATTERN is confirmed. M15 Ellipse : Don't get nailed with a sudden spike such as this PA. As I mentioned earlier, the signal here is doubtful (a.k.a. false signal) Comments/questions are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #269 ---
Ellipse : Looking for a small CT (rebounce) somewhere here... 50SMA / 89SMA of H1. Note: Stochastic + momentum already @ extremely SWING LOW level.

--- 帖子 #270 ---
See ellipse and vertical line .

--- 帖子 #271 ---
This LONG signal of rebounce can already give us 20p profit using the 20p SL/TP strategy and rules (based on agreement in both 5m and 15m signals). A risky CT trade...but a very nice one...!!!

--- 帖子 #272 ---
Rectangular : 3 INSIDE UP pattern is confirmed. A highly reliable bullish reversal signal. Price will probably touch to at least 21EMA . This PA (price Action) is also supported by the stochastic+momentum @ SWING LOW . Comments/questions are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #273 ---
Hello... Let's do this as simple as we can:- D1 The uptrending market is still in control, however it is yet to break above the Res TL since last week. H4 Price moves in triangle area right now, between the Res TL (see arrow ) and temporary Sup TL (see arrow ). A spinner in a previous candle might be the sign for this pair go down a little lower today. H1 See rectangular . After this PA is formed, the market has been moving sideways. 50SMA and 89SMA still support the price very well so far, but I don't think they can hold it today. I am bias to the downside now. A possible breakout from the triangle might happen today. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #274 ---
See ellipse . This one is for 10p SL/TP strategy and rules .

--- 帖子 #275 ---
The previous one is a false signal. See ellipse now. If the momentum (yellow) catch up the stochastic ...the right signal should be there...

--- 帖子 #276 ---
There we go now....

--- 帖子 #277 ---
Alright... The final hours of Asian session today has some strong bullish sentiment for this pair. The PW 1.4270 is no longer a strong resistance, but as an immediate support level now. As per H4 , I believe the previous Res TL is now become the Sup TL (see arrow ) for the price. In H1 , the price might retrace to at least 21EMA before it making a TC upside price pattern. Obviously, the bulls are controlling the market now. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome. (Note: Next level to watch now is PW 1.4350 ) HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #278 ---
This could be a very nice rebounce. Ready to buy here (see ellipse )...the recent H1 candle will be closed around 30mins from now. Stochastic @ extreme SWING LOW as the price find support @ 89SMA now. Stochastic + momentum in 15m also @ extremely SWING LOW level right now. Use 5m signal for a better entry. The 20p SL/TP strategy and rules should be applied here. All the best...!!!

--- 帖子 #279 ---
Okay... LONG signal should be here then...for the small rebounce The previous one is not the right signal as per H1 since the momentum still on the way down and pushing the price lower right now. So we are here @ 200SMA and PW 1.4190 . Loads of support here as the temporary Sup TL (see arrow ) also in the way.

--- 帖子 #280 ---
This is a CT trade...and...since the market turn down very fast...we could only expect the rebounce up to 10EMA as in 15m TF. Comments/questions are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #281 ---
See ellipse . Temporary Sup TL ( see arrow ), PW1.4190 and 200SMA are all fail to support the price from falling. The trend downtrending too fast for us to do the CT trade . However, its look like a little calm for mr.bear right now. We are goins south for now. Favour for SHORT only.

--- 帖子 #282 ---
A little update from my Daily TL. Attached herewith is the latest template.

--- 帖子 #283 ---
Rectangular : Price pattern is potentially forming the 3 OUTSIDE DOWN formation (highly reliable bearish reversal signal). The price has higher chances to revisit 89SMA , PW 1.4110 and lower Channel for the next support levels. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #284 ---
Hello all... Bearish sentiment was very strong yesterday. Let us see how the market going to do for today:- D1 Even though the uptrending market is now shaken, the price still have support from 21EMA and lower Channel . However, the stochastic and momentum are sliding down right now. Bear is now in command. H4 I made a temporary Sup TL (see arrow ) as the price make some rebounce here. Loads of resistance from above ( 8EMA , 21EMA and 50SMA ). H1 See ellipse . It is very rare to see the price react to the 365EMA but it did happen yesterday. This is where the price rebounce after a nose diving market yesterday. Looks like it is resisted @ PW 1.4190 and 200SMA so far. We are bias to the downside today. I'm considering the D1 stochastic as the dominant factor. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Hi Orange, I'm new here ( in yr thread ) just found your thread very good analysis and congrats. I have one question about EU. What is your target for today? can this pair S3 seems looks very bearish. Best regards

--- 帖子 #286 ---
Hello newkidfx, Thanks for the compliments and sorry for the late reply. I was busy with my work today. Back to your question. I don't really have any specific target every single day trading. As you can see, this system is very much the same as a scalping method. I'm just riding the price rhythm and wave, up and down. As long I can get at least 80pips per day, that's enough. That is my target. Well...maybe we can see the price touching PW 1.4030 tomorrow. It is around 50SMA in D1 . As per this TF's stochastic and momentum , the bearish sentiment is definitely taking control the market right now. Hope this helps. I'm looking forward for more of yours and the others posting here in this thread. Feel free to comment/ask anything here. All the best...!!!

--- 帖子 #287 ---
Hello again... It seems the lower Channel has been violated now and the 89SMA also fail to support the price from going down. So here we are now:- H4 Stochastic already @ SWING LOW level as the momentum is likely to settle down for the moment. If these two indys can push up the price higher, the price might rebounce and pull back to the nearest MA ( 8EMA ) before the it making the TC downside pattern. H1 Both stochastic and momentum also already showing that the downtrend market has calm a little bit for now. Will look @ 8EMA or 365EMA for the next SWING HIGH level. We are still bias to the downside. Next level to watch is PW 1.4030 and 200SMA . Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Hi Orange thanks for your reply. Seems yr prediction is correct to 1.4030 area. I'm looking forward to learn yr system start frm today well maybe it could take sometimes to master it. Currently i already download your new template and other indi. During learing process I have to look back from your 1st page of thread to get know better yr system . Meanwhile if you have all the system method documented word / excel file if you don't mind to upload here so that it easy for my quick study sorry if i ask too much. Ok for today from my noobs analysis for EU base on my chart i'm looking forward EU if can break 1.4005 area because we have strong support there. If could break we can see more bearish to area 1.3942 - 1.3830 or to 61.8 monthly fibs at 1.3744. I could be wrong due to this is my first analysis on EU and EU is my new pair for trading. Please give comment or advise because i'm here for learning . For new guest I reccomend this is the best thread for tf 5 and 15m. cheers! Best regards and happy trading.

Alright now... I have identified the downtrend Channel now since the bearish sentiment has been taking control the market in the previous 2 days. Attached below is also the latest template. Here we go:- D1 We have fib 76.4% as a strong support for today. Be cautious as the stochastic @ SWING LOW level right now. H4 Stochastic + momentum @ SWING LOW right now. Should them rebounce, they might lift up the price up at least PW 1.4110 . H1 We still can see that this pair really2 bias to the downside. Stochastic @ SWING HIGH and the price still unable to go above 21EMA . The bear is roaring...the bull is sleeping...but maybe we will only see some little fluctuation in the market activity today.

H4 See ellipse . Even though the stochastic is heading up, the previous candle showing a great resistance from 8EMA . A spinner candle with long upper wick. However, I still think the price can touch PW 1.4110 before it making TC to the downside. H1 I make a small TL for the temporary guide here (see arrow ).

Hello again... We have a great rebounce during the US session yesterday. Let us see what we have for today:- D1 See blue channel . There is a possiblity that the market moving within this direction as well. I will keep this one in this TF only to see how does it goes in the next few weeks. Stochastic @ SWING LOW now and there will be a good chances for this pair rebounce sometime around next week. H4 We see the price making a very strong rhythm here, a nice pull back towards 21EMA and probably still on going to 50SMA . After the stochastic making it SWING HIGH , the price is definitely making a TC to the downside move. Nice one...!!! H1 The small and temporary Sup TL (see arrow ) I made yesterday still holding strong up to now. Stochastic and momentum both @ SWING HIGH now. Also, see the doji candle below the 89SMA now . We might see a little retracement here sooner. This is easy now. I will say we are going south again today and back to PW 1.4030 . Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome.

H4 Be alert. Stochastic @ SWING HIGH as the price is resisted against 89SMA . However, the price still have strong support by PW 1.4110 and 21EMA . H1 Nice rebounce there...around 21EMA . Since the stochastic @ SWING LOW , it probably will go a little higher above 89SMA before it retreat again later on. As per H4 , I'm still bias to the downside movement. Hope this helps.

Just now was a false signal...the higher TF is dominating the trend right now...will let the market run for a while....still be cautious of PW 1.4190 now. H4 stochastic is in SWING HIGH position.

--- 帖子 #350 ---
Hi all... Here is the latest view of mine:- D1 I am now keeping my Channel a little bit to the upside from now on. This TF already making SWING LOW as per its stochastic . Uptending is still in control. H4 Momentum has been pushing up the price very well last Friday (31/07/2009) and now it is already keeping up with the stochastic @ SWING HIGH level. Hence, we will see price making a RETRACEMENT to at least somewhere around PW 1.4190 sometime by tomorrow (03/08/2009) . H1 This TF supporting the H4 TF since both stochastic+momentum are also @ SWING HIGH and the price is now already out of steam. Great resistance by the PW 1.4270 here. Price could probably gong back to 200SMA or 21EMA before it making a TC upside pattern. For Monday (03/08/2009) , my prediction is the price will going south again meanwhile the major trend is still seems to be going sideways right now. Hope this helps.

Hello again... It is time to get some idea now:- D1 Well, stochastic is heading too fast. Based on this, we can see that the price is probably still cannot go so much higher than the previous high. H4 Nice retracement once the price hit the Res TL (see arrow ). Price is now coming back to PW 1.4190 as I predicted yesterday. Loads of support from MAs below but the price might also go to as low as 89SMA or PW 1.4110 later on today. This is because the stochastic and momentum are still in the beginning of their way to the downside. As we all know, most of the time these 2 indys are giving very powerful signal of the price pattern. H1 We'll see some little support from PW 1.4190 at present. But since the H4 TF is more dominant, we need to be very2 carefull here. Let's wait and see if 200SMA is strong enough to support the price. For today's direction, I am bias to the downside. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

This is the mini channel (see arrows ) for shorter TFs viewing. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #353 ---
See the blue vertical lines . As in the first vertical line @ 29/07/2009 , both stochastic + momentum are @ extremely SWING LOW . After that, we see some great rebounce from that point. In the second vertical line @ 02/08/2009 , the indys are making the vice versa behaviour from what we see in the first vertical line . After this point, we also see nice retracement in the market. Study this.

--- 帖子 #354 ---
Hello all... This is my view for today:- D1 Finally the bull gain its control in the market. A little adjustment for the Channel and be cautious with the stochastic behaviour now. H4 Price making a new high with currently resisted @ PW 1.4430 and the long term Res TL . Anticipating some retracement now to somewhere nearby fib 100% before the price making the TC upside pattern and retest the Res TL . H1 Ellipse : The rally seems began @ this point yesterday once the price break above the mini channel . The immediate support now is PW 1.4350 . I am bias to the upside now but we might see some tight ranging market today. Hope this helps. Also, attached herewith is my latest template. Comments/questions are most welcome.

Very little movement since the Euro session opening. H4 Looking forward for rectangular area for the TC upside pattern. We are still having strong support from 8EMA though. H1 I make the the mini channel (see arrows ) here for the Flag Formation . This could be very helpful to determine the PA as it has the similar pattern as the yesterday's (03/08/2009) mini channel.

Loads of profitable scalping method in the market today as per 5m below. Too bad, I am too busy with my work...

--- 帖子 #358 ---
Still goes as I planned earlier....

--- 帖子 #359 ---
Hello all... I'll make it simple for today:- D1 Doji candle below Res TL yesterday and also stochastic that is making SWING HIGH now. If I am right, retracement will happen for the next few days. H4 Rectangular : I am still expecting this area is a tough support area for the rebounce. However, price looks really2 tired to go up now. H1 Sideways direction, and obviously thin trading volume here. It might be the sign for the next downturn. I am losing faith in bullish sentiment at the moment. The daily chart is the reason why I should favour for SHORT now. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #360 ---
Ellipse : Target area for TC downside pattern. Will use 5m TF for a better entry. Will watch this area later on...

--- 帖子 #361 ---
Hello all... We are in the middle of "waiting" right now. As per D1 , there are already two doji candles with the stochastic is now @ SWING HIGH position. In the nexyt few days, we might see a very strong bearish sentiment as per the signal given. (However, it is not impossible if this situation could also become a temporary pause in the market before the next rally is coming. Only time can tell). Nothing much to say in H4 and H1 as the price movement is very2 tight and only ranging between PW 1.4430 and 1.4350 . Technically, I am still very2 bias to the downside move now. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #362 ---
Signal for SHORT . We should be going down a little bit from here for now (See ellipse @ 15m)

--- 帖子 #363 ---
I make a temporary mini TL (see arrow ) for 15m and 5m viewing only. I anticipate that if the price break below this TL it should be a comfort zone to favour SHORT entry later on. Time will tell.

--- 帖子 #364 ---
Ellipse : As I anticipated yesterday, price need to break below this area for us to get comfort with our SHORT position. Rectangular : It is very nice to re-enter here as the price respecting the 50SMA at least for 4 bars (equal to 1hr) and make it TC to the downside. Study this and hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #365 ---
Good day all... We have some difficult time since few days ago. Let us see what can we see for today as the NFP data is also ahead:- D1 From above, loads of pressure from Res TL and the stochastic is also already making its SWING HIGH . However, we still have some good support from fib 100% , 8EMA and Sup TL (see arrow ) from below. H4 Price has been constantly rejected by PW 1.4430 and eventually sitting somewhere nearby 21EMA for now. We need to see the price consistently below this MA before we can say that the bearish sentiment is start controlling the market. H1 Price has been moving in this temporary Channel so far. If the stochastic become the dominant factor today, it should drag the price to the lower channel (and probably break below it) since it is making SWING HIGH position already. But if the momentum is rising and start to catch up with the stochastic from above, it should lift the price a little higher soon. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Just let the market plays out today since it is NFP ahead of us. As per daily chart, I am still bias to the dowside move for now. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #366 ---
This could be the early sign to the dowside move from 5m TF (but we are still yet to see some clear direction from 15m). See ellipse . Price resisted @ 50SMA as the stochastic making SWING HIGH behaviour. Nice one...

--- 帖子 #367 ---
I made temporary mini TLs (see arrows ) for 5m and 15m TF viewing only. Will use the mini breakout strategy (break above/below) since this system is about 5m and 15m strategy and rules. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #368 ---
Ellipse : Will SHORT somewhere from here using 10p SL/TP strategy and rules . Let's see how it goes...

--- 帖子 #369 ---
As I anticipated earlier, I will SHORT if the price reach somewhere around the temporary resistance TL. See how the price respecting this line and pressuring the price to the downside (see ellipse ) Too bad, I went out for lunch when this happening....

--- 帖子 #370 ---
Retangular: We still have support from fib 100% . Ellipse: Weak support from this TL now.

--- 帖子 #371 ---
We are into the WAR ZONE now...see AQUAMARINE price action and area...!!!

Now it's ranging between these two temporary TLs (see arrows ) now...

Hello again... Looks like enough already for the bullish market:- D1 We are now looking forward the support from lower Channel and 50SMA for next week's trading session. H4 Rectangular : I am just predicting this area (somewhere nearby 200SMA and PW 1.4110 ) for a rebounce or at least a little pull back to 8EMA . H1 Looks like the price will be hold up somewhere around PW 1.4190 until the end of today's trading session. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The uptrending market is now losing its control and I think we are going to see the downtrending market soon. It is still too early to say this, but I am still favouring to the downside direction right now. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #374 ---
Hello... Alright...we have seen the downtrending pattern is now begin to take control in the market. Let us see how will be the market sentiment for today:- D1 Previous 2 bars closing below 21EMA showing that the bearish movement is in the way. Meanwhile stochastic is nose diving so deeply now. We still have support from 50SMA and lower Channel . Becarefull with the possiblity of rebounce that might happen at anytime soon. H4 Stochastic + momentum are yet to make their SWING LOW and the price still resting @ PW 1.4190 at this moment. If they rebounce, the first resistance area that need to be watch is somewhere around 50SMA / 89SMA . The next resistance area we should be watching is the 8EMA or PW 1.4270 . For the support, it is obviously the 200SMA and PW 1.4110 . H1 Stochastic @ SWING HIGH as the price seems resisted @ 8EMA for now. However, the momentum is yet to push up the price higher. Not a very strong signal to the downside move. The temporary Sup TL (see arrow ) is made here. I am not bias to any direction right now. Will let the market adjusting itself for today and let it plays out. Probably just doing fine with the scalping method right now. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome.

Hello again... The US session is not open yet...but the bearish sentiment is still in the mood so far:- H4 Still looking forward for 200SMA and lower Channel for some support tot the price.

Nice SHORT signals based on 5m TF and stochastic behaviour. See ellipse .

--- 帖子 #377 ---
Here we go now. Let us see if 200SMA and/or PW 1.4110 can hold the price from going down further...

--- 帖子 #378 ---
Alright... This is the starter for today's view:- D1 Price is now testing the lower Channel and 50SMA . Stochastic is seems to make its SWING LOW . Be ready for the rebounce that could happen at anytime soon. H4 As per RSI , the market has went oversold yesterday. We can see the stochastic trying to lift up the price a little bit right now, and the momentum is yet to off the ground. 8EMA and PW 1.4190 is the immediate resistance for today. H1 Nice support from PW 1.4110 so far. 8EMA and 21EMA are now began to move sideways. This could be a sign that the market might consolidate in a tight range until it get back to its normal rhythm (upside/downside). I am on the sideline today. Just get the feeling that the market will make a little bounce today. Just wait and see. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Euro session has created some movement in the market now. As predicted earlier, per H4 the price is now rebounce up to 8EMA area (and probably still can go up until 21EMA ). Just look at the stochastic and momentum behaviour. In H1 , I just made a temporary Sup TL (see arrow ) for lower TFs viewing only (H1-M15-M5). Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome.

LONG signal @ here. As per 15m , if the 50SMA couldn't support the price, the next level we should watch for entry is the temporary Sup TL as shown in arrow . Hope this helps. (Note: Do not overlook the H1 Price Action and signal as well...)

--- 帖子 #381 ---
Nice LONG signal from 50SMA ( 15m ) just now. The vertical line is where the signal is taken from 5m TF . Very good for 20p profit in the bag.

Hi ORangeRange. First of all, thank you very much for sharing this amazing system and teach us so well. I see that this system is a result of very strong work and experience, and am very grateful with you for sharing it. Second, about last signal, I was just following the charts and noted that STO went in swing areas a couple of candles before the one you identified as signal candle. Could you explain why it is better to wait and what is the specific for getting your candle as signal? Finally, I was in doubt about this signal, bc previously I say price to in down to TL under SMA50 for three times, and I was not sure. Could you explain why could we not be aware of this? Thank you so much again.

--- 帖子 #383 ---
Hello... Thanks for the compliment. I've been using this system since June 2009. Have been studying and researching this on my own since January this year.

--- 帖子 #384 ---
Ellipse : The price already break below this temporary Sup TL . I'll remove this line later on. See arrow : Making another temporary Res TL here for H1-M15-M5 viewing only. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #385 ---
Here is the latest update:- D1 Pay attention to 50SMA @ 1.4081 now. I think this is the lowest point where the rebounce area might happened. H4 See ellipse : Doji against 8EMA in the previous candle. Price is now retest 200SMA and lower Channel very hard. Becareful because it seems to be a false breakout here. H1 A nice resistance @ 50SMA for TC downside pattern for the past couple of hours. We still have to very2 carefull with the PW 1.4110 since it is still remaining the strong support so far. Be patient now. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome.

Hello, about the Stochastic Bars indi, could you please specify what the different bar colors (Red, Lime, Gold, Orange, ...) mean? Thank you in advance.

--- 帖子 #388 ---
Different colours represent different strength of the stochastic behaviour. You can pick your own colours in its set up. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #389 ---
Hi all... Let's roll:- D1 50SMA and lower Channel still supporting the price...meanwhile stochastic is begin to make it SWING LOW behaviour. H4 We are stuck between 200SMA / PW 1.4110 and 8EMA / PW1.4190 . A typical sideways direction as we always seen lately. H1 8EMA , 21EMA and 50SMA are all bunched up together right now. The only way to trade during this "freezing" market is by using lower TFs from 15m and 5m ( 515 Strategy ) for scalping method. I am still on the sideline today. Will let the market plays out and have a little breathe before we can see some nice direction again. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Hello again...here we go for the latest update:- D1 As I always mentioned earlier, price exactly rebounce @ 50SMA . H4 Nice + strong support from lower Channel and PW 1.4110 for the rebounce area. H1 Looking forward for PW 1.4190 (Somewhere around 21EMA @ H4 ) for a little retracement before we can see a TC upside pattern. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome.

LONG Signal (see ellipse area). I'm looking forward to BUY somewhere around 50SMA @ 5m ( 21EMA @ 15m ). This also will depending on how the PA and signals provided from 15m and H1 TF as well. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #393 ---
The uptrending is so obvious when you see your 5m chart become like this. See how the PA when around 50SMA and 21EMA (see ellipses ). Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #394 ---
Hello, orangeRANGE. 1. The ellipses you highlight are not good setups, right (Stochastic is not always in swing low area). So, should we enter only based on PA on the MAs? 2. As for the attached image (sorry, I don't know how to include images i the post), I traded on the vertical lines. The blue were M5 only setups (10 pip), the red was a M5+M15 (20pips) setup, but it was counter trend, so it has been a loser. Please, could you give your comments? Many Thanks.

--- 帖子 #395 ---
Hello Fedro, 1) Yes, as per the signal, they are not good setups. The most important thing to be considered when using this system is the PA around the MAs and sup/res TLs. As I always mentioned in my previous lessons, stochastic + momentum are for supportive signals only. 2) During a fast trending market, NEVER EVER do the CT trade. When the market trending up very fast, only favour LONG . During this kind of trend, stochastic swing high is often making false signal especially in lower TFs (5m and 15m). Vice versa if the market downtrending very fast. As per my previous lessons, you need to identify the true/false signal. Do not trade every signal provided by stochastic (especially during a fast trending market). In addition, you need to understand how to read the higher TF PA and direction (rhythm) because they are the more dominant, especially the H4 . That's the purpose I post my daily overview here. Simply put, we get the idea of the market direction from higher TFs and we trade using the lower TFs. That's it is all about. Please go through all the lessons in this thread and do your demo trade before you live trading. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #396 ---
Good day to all, We have wild movement in the market yesterday. So, here we go now:- D1 Not much to say. It is bias to the upside move as per the stochastic . H4 We see the price is struggling to break above 89SMA but it manage to get support from 8EMA and 21EMA for now. Beware of the stochastic's SWING HIGH behaviour now. We might see some retracement before the price making TC upside pattern later on. H1 Price is slowly begin to ride above 8EMA now and our next target should be PW 1.4270 before we can see some resistance around res TL (see arrow ) above it. I am bias to the upside move for today. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Hello orangeRange. Thank you very much for your help, it is very valuable. I read all post in the thread and am astonished by your knowledge and genius. I feel lucky about meeting you and 515EF method. Don't be afraid: I'm demo trading on this new approach, I want to learn it well before going live. I knew that going CT was risky, but being demo I prefer to make errors there. Errors teach, and I think that I can learn a lot making errors (in demo, obviously). Here I put a special situation with some analisys, looking forward for your comments. At 17:45 (my charts are GMT), STO@5M went at swing low area. Price was etween 8 and 21 EMA, and before it swong-up here for three times. The trend was strong, the last support (formed by the doji at 17:20) was tested, and the signal candle was a bull candle, so I thought this was a good setup. I tried a long 10pip, entering at 1.4224. Eventually EU went down just 10 pips before swinging up, so the trade was loser. I tried to figure out how could I avoid such errors: 1) PA @ 5M was not giving a so convincing reversal formation. 2) the 15M candle was still too far from 8EMA, that gave strong support in 15M in the last few hours. 3) STO @ 15M had broken its uptrend and was pointing down, while mom @ 15 M got a very high peak and was pointing down too. - Which of points 1-2-3 is the most important per your knowledge? - Are there more things we should note here for which we should have rather waited? - Going on to the following candles, is there , by your experience, a better entry point? - Being imminent some important news (19:15 in FF calendar), should we stay out from trading say 1-2 hours before? Thank you in advance for your comments.

--- 帖子 #398 ---
Fedro, -for point #2 , whenever the candle has been away from 10EMA (not 8EMA), you must be aware that it might pullback to that MA after a while. For point #3 , it is very important to know that retrcament could happened at anytime if both stoch and momentum are already at their peak. Point #1 is the least important to me. -I x understand this question.... -there is no good entry from there. You must know what the higher TFs doing as well (H1 and H4) and what their PAs around certain MA. In this case, it was nearby 89SMA with it stochastic @ SWING HIGH level (H4) showing some resistance in the way. So, alert... -I will only avoid trading when the Fed/ECB about to announce their interest rates, the US Unemployment Claims and the NFP of course. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #399 ---
See ellipses . These two signals are so far the best produced by both stochastic and momentum for today as per 5m chart below. Signal #1 ( SHORT ) Price reaching @ PW 1.4270 (I always beware of retracement/rebounce when the price reaching PW) Stochastic + momentum are @ SWING HIGH level. Signal #2 ( LONG ) Price get support @ 50SMA Stochastic + momentum are @ SWING LOW level. Maximum 40p profits from both signals if the 20p SL/TP Strategy and Rules is used here. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #400 ---
Here we go for the latest update:- H4 Becarefull now with the PW 1.4270 , 50SMA and Res TL (see arrow ). If the price break through them, our next target for some good retracement are somewhere around fib 100% or PW 1.4350 . H1 This TF telling that the market in "OVERBOUGHT" situation now. 200SMA is in the way, meanwhile the both stochastic + momentum are at their peak. The bull is on parade but we might also see the some fight from the bear, hopefully during the US session later on. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome.

At the second ellipse STO @ M15 is not at swing low. So, according to the strategy, don't we should trade for just 10pips (not 20)? Did I miss something?

--- 帖子 #402 ---
We are talking about the vertical line signal here. Yes, as per 15m , stoch seems going down. As I said, you can get maximum (not minimum) 20p profit from this move. But since this signal is just based on 5m , the 10p SL/TP Strategy is the best. Hope this helps.

Nice retracement signal over here (see ellipse @ 5m ). Let us see if the price able to revisit PW 1.4190 later on. As per H1 , loads of support from below. Comments/questions are most welcome.

From 5m stochastic's SWING LOW vs PA , we can see an uptrending market for the last 8 hours. 1) Support @ 50SMA 2) Support @ 50SMA 3) Support @ 50SMA (15m) 4) Support @ PW 1.4270 Hope this helps.

It is less than 1hr now before my recent H4 candle is closed. It seems the price find strong resistance @ 50SMA and Res TL (see arrow ). I will wait this candle nearly its closing before I take my last decision. I am favouring SHORT now because the stochastic is now about to make its SWING HIGH pattern. As per H1, I just roughly predicting the price could go as low as PW 1.4190 , the lowest point I could think for now. However, there are loads of support from MAs below. I will use lower TFs (5m and 15m) to make my entry later on. Hope this helps. Comments/qeustions are most welcome.

Hi all... We are into the the weekend now. So, here we go:- D1 We have been in a bullish market sentiment in these few days as the stochastic also into that direction. Price still resisted @ Res TL (see arrow ) and it is still unable to close above this line yesterday. Cautious. H4 See rectangular . The previous 4 bars were testing the Res TL very hard and they are consistently closed below it. This PA is also in sync with stochastic behaviour ( SWING HIGH pattern) during the course. Still have a little support from 8EMA for now. I am looking forward for 21EMA or 89SMA for the next rebounce area. H1 If I am right, we can see the price rebounce somewhere nearby 50SMA from this TF. We'll see how it goes for Euor session later on. I am favouring LONG position for now. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

Hi all...

See rectangulars . In rec.#1 , when the PA is riding above 50SMA and also well supported by PW 1.4270 , this is where the uptrending is about to happen. In rec.#2 , I'm expecting rebounce aaround here for the TC upside pattern. Hope this helps.

Look like 3 Outside Down pattern (see rectangular ) here against the Res TL. This is a highly reliable bearish reversal pattern. Now I'm looking forward for 365EMA or 89SMA for the next support. I am not favouring SHORT since the Daily stochastic still heding up. The bull is not over yet. Hope this help.

H4 It seems we might go lower today and maybe will revisit to somewhere around PW 1.4190 H1 89SMA looks good for support but 365EMA is still holding on for now. Also, I make a temporary downtrend Channel for now. This is just in case the bearish sentiment continues. Attached herewith is my latest template. Hope this helps.

Here it is...

--- 帖子 #419 ---
Good day to all... Let us begin this week with today's forecast:- D1 It seems the bearish sentiment continues for now and I'm expecting 50SMA will be tested very2 hard by sooner or later. H4 Stochastic @ SWING LOW position. If 200SMA and/or lower Uptrending Channel fail to support the price, the nearest immediate support has to be PW 1.4110 or the previous low @ 1.4086 for the rebounce point. H1 We will see how hard the price will be testing the lower Channel later on. I am neutral for now. The bearish sentiment seems want to take over and controlling the market but it is still too early to say that. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome. (Note: Attached herewith also is my latest template) HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #420 ---
Let us see if we still can see rebounce @ PW 1.4110 or previous low @ 1.4086 ...it is just somewhere nearby 50SMA @ D1 . Use lower TFs strategy ( H1-M15-M5 ) for a better PA analysis now. Watch out now.

--- 帖子 #421 ---
Hello all... Bearish sentiment is now begin to roar. So, here we go:- D1 The downtreding Channel is now on its course but I still keep the uptrending Channel for reference. Price has closed below 50SMA yesterday but we still have strong support from long term Sup TL from below (see arrow ) and 89SMA . H4 Price has make the pull back to 8EMA once the stochastic making it SWING LOW in the last previous 3 bars. This is very easy. Just wait for PA and stochastic behaviour for the next TC downside pattern. It should be somewhere around 8EMA or 200SMA or 21EMA . H1 It seems that we are resisted around 21EMA and PW 1.4110 for now. The next move should be bias to the downside now. Alright, we are heading south for now. Hope this helps. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #422 ---
Watch out for this area (see rectangular in both TFs) for TC downside move. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #423 ---
Evening Star pattern against 8EMA @ the previous candle for some TC downside move now.

--- 帖子 #424 ---
Price might pull back to 21EMA for the normal market rhythm and stochastic is still heading up, meanwhile to momentum will push up the price very hard anytime from now. So becareful now. We still need to wait and see what the euro session can do for this pair later on during its opening. I am still looking for the rectangular area for the ideal SHORT positon. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #425 ---
Here it is...

--- 帖子 #426 ---
Hi all... This is the latest update:- H4 Price does pull back to 21EMA and it is now in the rectangular area as I anticipated earlier. Currently resisted by 200SMA and I am favouring to SHORT this pair once the recent candle is closed. H1 We have 50SMA (the most important MA to this system) as the current resistance for the price at the moment. Alright, if I still have to go online, I will use the 515 Strategy to make my SHORT entry later on. Hope this helps. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #427 ---
Hello all...this is for today's first view:- D1 Not much change in this TF. We are yet to see the price go below 50SMA if the downtrending continues. H4 Watch for the PW 1.4190 and 50SMA for another potential SHORT positioning area as the stochastic is now in SWING HIGH position. The rectangular area still available for SHORT since yesterday's analysis. H1 Making a temporary Sup TL here (see arrow ) for another potential support area. I am still bias for SHORT for now. Hope this helps. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #428 ---
orangeRANGE, please have a look to tha attached chart, red vertical line. Stochastic are at swing high in both M5 and M15, momentum is high. At that time, H1 Stocastic was at swing high and Stochastic H4 was pointing down. It seemed a perfect 10 pip setup, instead it went to lose 20 pips. No news at that qime. How could this been explained? Why should we avoid that trade? Thank you.

--- 帖子 #429 ---
Fredo... Do you the temporary Sup TL (see arrow ) @ H1 as I mentioned in my previous post before this? Never take it for granted when it comes to TL. See what hapen to the PA when the price reach this line. Plus, even the H4 stochastic was looking for downside direction yesterday, you need to remind yourslef that the momentum is already off the ground and might push the price higher anytime. Just see the momentum vs stochastic behaviour in your H4 . You need to master this H4 rhythm before you can make nice entry using 515 Strategy . Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #430 ---
Hello.. Here is the first view for today's market:- D1 Bull flag pattern in this TF as the 50SMA is still seems a strong support region. Bullish sentiment gain its control at the moment. H4 A little adjustment for the downtredning channel here. Price resisted @ PW 1.4270 as the stochastic is making SWING HIGH position right now. Becarefull with loads of support from MAs below. Immediate support now @ PW 1.4190 . H1 PA @ ellipse area showing that the temporary Sup TL (see arrow ) has to be considered as a strong support from this TF for now. Momentum @ its highest level now so becarefull for any downturn int he price later on. I'm favouring to the downside today. Attached herewith also is my latest template. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #431 ---
Please, note that my H4 momentum ( orange ellipse ) looks very different than yours, maybe for different timebase of brokers. Moreover, just a few before the losing trade ( red ellipse ), there was a winning one ( blue ellipse ), and there were no apparent difference in the setup. So, how do we do to filter the second as loser?

--- 帖子 #432 ---
1) My platform (ibfx) has GMT offset @ Zero. It should be a little different. What is your broker? 2) To filter this lose, you need to correlate this TF with higher TFs ( H1 and H4 ). Plus, this is a very fast uptrending market, so doing the CT trade is very2 risky. When the price has been riding above 10EMA @ 5m consistently, you better not to use stochastic + momentum SWING HIGH to short the pair. It is much better to do the TC trend for this kind of market condition. Hope this helps. Please go through all the lessons and examples in this thread. If you have anymore problem, let me know.

--- 帖子 #433 ---
Hello all... Here is my first view for today:- D1 Doji candle yesterday. We should see some bearish sentiment today. I still want to keep the downtrending channel as it is before just in case the price going back into it. H4 Nice support/resistance @ 8EMA and PW 1.4270 respectively. I think we might see the price revisit the PW 1.4190 ish area (around 50SMA ) today. H1 I still see the 50SMA area as a very good support for the price in the coming few hours. Well, it's Friday and I choose to stay on the sideline now. Will let the market play it out until the Euro/US session opening later on. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #434 ---
This one is the latest great signal from 15m TF. See ellipse . Stochastic+momentum are @ their lowest and PA rebounce @ 50SMA of H1 . Since this is a CT, it is a little risky but 20p SL/TP strategy should be fine here. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #435 ---
Nice SHORT signal here (see rectangular ). Resistance @ 50SMA (nearby 21EMA of 15m ).

--- 帖子 #436 ---
My broker is InvesttechFX, it has CET (GMT+1). Thank you for help. 515 EuroFigther is a very good system, but the thing I find very difficult is filtering good entries from bad ones. When strong trends start, Stochastic signals are false, and this can happen ad any time. Moreover, momentum is important sometimes, but not always, and many good trade happen when momentum is not good.

--- 帖子 #437 ---
You need to do a lot of demo and study the stochastic/momentum vs PA before you know how to identify a true/false signal. Pay more attention to PA than indys. Afterall, the major direction is still in indecisive period so I don't think that any of the system out there can produce a very good trading result right now. The market turns up/down suprisingly at anytime. So, don't blame the system because it is design for normal market condition. All the best to you.

--- 帖子 #438 ---
This is one of the latest best signal during an uptrending market as per PA from higher TFs ( H1 and H4 ). The vertical line is the signal candle. Here we go:- 15m See PA @ ellipse area. Stochastic+momentum @ SWING LOW level as the price get support somewhere around 50SMA (also around 21EMA of H1 ). 5m Stochastic+momentum also already @ SWING LOW level. Entry to be done @ the next candle. Nice 20p profit from this move. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome.

Hello ppl, This week is the final trading week for this month. Let us begin wth today's early view:- D1 Be cautious. Doji candle yesterday as the stochastic @ SWING HIGH position at the moment. Also apy attention to the long term Res TL above the price now (see arrow ). H4 PW 1.4350 currently resisting the PA from going up further but the previous Res TL (now has become Sup TL - see arrow ) and the PW 1.4270 still can hold the price from dropping. H1 I'm still keeping these two temporary Sup TLs (see arrows ) for lower TFs viewing only (H1 and below) as they still have the potential for rebounce point. Not much movement yet. Will have to wait what the Euro session an produce in the market later today. Hope this helps. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #445 ---
This is the latest update:- H4 If the bearish continues, next target should be:- 21EMA or 89SMA or 1.4232 ( 21EMA @ D1 ) for today. H1 50SMA still holding but I think the price might break below it sooner. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #446 ---
Hi all... This is for today's view:- D1 Evening Doji Star pattern as per rectangular . Becareful with the immediate support from 8EMA for now. H4 The recent candle making strong rebounce @ PW 1.4270 and might retest the temporary Res TL here (see arrow ). H1 Great support by 89SMA here. We might see tough resistance @ PW 1.4350 later on. I'm still on the sideline today. Hope this helps. (Note: Also, attached herewith is the latest template) HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #447 ---
Hello all, This is my view for today:- D1 We still have 8EMA supporting the price but it is look like stochastic and momentum are going the opposite way. Becareful now. One of them will definitely give up. Let us see if the price can go to as low as 21EMA by today. H4 We still have the PW 1.4350 and temporary TL (see arrow ) that I made yesterday resisting the price. Still indecisive for now. H1 89SMA is now become the supporting MA in this TF. LONG position can be taken from this MA using 515 strategies . But again, becareful. I am still on the sideline and probably will not take any trade this week. But in longer term I am still bias for bearish market sentiment. Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #448 ---
Hello all, Let us see how the market do today:- D1 As I hoped yesterday, the price went down to as low as 21EMA . Now, if the bearish sentiment continues, we still have to look @ 50SMA for the real support as the price rebounce around this MA for a few times already. H4 We see support @ 50SMA from this TF at this moment and now looking forward for PW 1.4190 for the next low. H1 Looks like the previous temporary SUp TL (see arrow ) still able to hold up the price for now. If the PA break below this level, we should be bias to the downside move again. It is now depends on what is the signal produced from the lower TFs (15m and 5m). Hope this helps. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #449 ---
A correct and a good trend line will definitely helping in our trading. As per H1 below, both TLs (see ellipse ) work very well so far. In this, I am talking about taking the trade @ the sup TL (see arrow in H1 ). The 15m TF doesn't give so much signal when the price reach this sup TL , so alternatively, I'll go to the 5m TF to look for signals. See three ellipses in 5m . If you are using the 10p SL/TP rules , these moves definitely give you 30p profit . Taking the stochastic SWING LOW signal from this TF, you go for LONG entry around the Sup TL . Hope this helps. Comments/questions are most welcome.

Potential 3 INSIDE DOWN pattern (see r ectangular ). I'll go for SELL now..

Price and stochastic in agreement. Nice pull back towards 21EMA here (see ellipse ) before the next TC to the downside (hopefully)....

--- 帖子 #453 ---
Hi all, I will be on a vacation and will not be posting on next Monday (31st August 2009). So let's roll with today's view:- D1 I was very2 cautious with 21EMA yesterday and it does support the daily candle very well for now. Let's see if the price can revisit the Res TL above it today. H4 Price making great rebounce off the 50SMA and PW 1.4270 before it finally break above temporary Res TL (see arrow ) and sticking up with 8EMA at the moment. We will see if the price manage to go up to as high as PW 1.4350 or not later on. H1 A false break out @ temporary Sup TL (see arrow ) yesterday as the price is actually regain its bullish sentiment around 200SMA . I have amde a little adjustment for this TL now. Bullish sentiment is not over yet but I'm leaving the market to play out itself for now. I'm comfortable with the PA recently. All the best to you. Hope this helps.

Hello, This is my simple view for today's market. D1 We are now at the edge of the TRIANGLE TLs. Also becarefull as the price is now again to retest the 50SMA . H4 Long term Sup TL (see arrow ) and PW 1.4190 are to watch. H1 Potential TC downside move as per this TF. Hope this helps. HAVE A LOOK AND MAKE YOUR OWN THOUGHT

--- 帖子 #459 ---
SharkLady, if you trade in demo, you can test this system, it will only waste your time, otherwise, it will waste you both money and time. Low time frame, counter trend trade, tight stoploss,,,,,, what else can blow off your account as quick as possible? Perhap Mr. Orange would disgree with me about his system, but he can prove I am wrong by his trading record.

--- 帖子 #460 ---
Show me your chart...

--- 帖子 #461 ---
This method is not suitable for you then...and obviously...you don't understand the method. Every trader knows that doing a CT is a very risky effort, and it is only best to do that when you really understand how the system (any trading system in this world) works for you. My system is included. Only favour the TC trade...and only trade the lower time frame (5min and 15min) when you already master the higher time frame (hourly and 4hrs). It is all has been mentioned in this thread. Thats why I have two TFs strategies for this system, the D1-H4-H1 tf and the H1-M15-M5 tf. Think again before you leave your "harsh" opinion here. Afterall, you cannot adapt yourself to all trading systems that available in FF. Just stick to the one that suits you. IT IS SUCH A WASTE OF YOUR TIME TELLING OTHER PEOPLE THAT THIS SYSTEM IS GOOD AND THAT SYSTEM IS BAD. Let the trader himself/herself decide. Hope this helps.

Well, it is not out of my expectation that Mr. Orange will be unhappy and highlight his words, shout to me loudly. So the following words is only to the newcomers to Forexfactory. If I keep on talking to Mr. Orange, the post would be extracted by the web administer to somewhere . However, I would like to get notice by the newcomers to the FF before the post is removed. Dear new traders, From my point of view, there are four kinds of systems in FF 1.Great one. The owner of the system consistently making money, share his knowledge more than his system. Some followers can make money by using the system, someones can not, but they are learning the knowledge. 2.Reasonable good one. The owner share a profitable system without thorough explanation, the owner can make money, but the followers can not. 3.A system in developing. The rules are changing time by time, however, the owners are open to comment, it will become profitable system in the future. 4.Rubbish If you quickly go through 515 “system”, you will find the only replies come from newbie who register to FF only short time ago. Then they stay away, as most of the others stay away from the very beginning. Someones modestly asked why 515 is not working. He tells the follower to blame himself rather than the “system”. Mr. Orange is not open to the comment, he is only open to the praise. As Mr. Orange said his “idea“ comes from 4H MACD, which is a mainly a trendfollowing trade method. Mr. Orange does not follow it very well. He wants to catch trend by swing trade style, and lock profit by scalper’s MM. Well, enough. I would like to make a suggestion only to the newbie who comes to FF than on month, please thinking about 95% failure rate x one of the four kinds of the systems mentioned in above, ask yourself to whom you are learning from, that’s all.

Been busy with other projects and my personal life for more than 2 years. Now coming back to refresh everything again

--- 帖子 #482 ---
Okay, Look at the right hand side of the BLACK dashed vertical line. This is where the PA started this week. From this H4, we see 89sma and PW1.3950 are showing some resistance against the price (see ellipse area). The current candle is about to close in about 30mins. If it close below 89sma / 1.3950, chances to sell this pair is and gaining some good pips are quite good. Price is well below 89sma/21ema a sign of TC downtrend atm. I could be wrong, but I favour to SELL this pair. My suggestion will be SL @ 1.4000 (9 pips above previous S up/Res indy). Go for TP 80pips. Trade @ your own risk. Good luck guys.

--- 帖子 #483 ---
Selling @ 1.3918 just now with SL/TP @ 1.4000/1.3830. Let's wait the result.

--- 帖子 #484 ---
Selling another @ 1.3911 using the same SL with the 1st entry but this one for FREE RIDE purpose. Will remove this SL to ZERO RISK once the 1st entry hit TP. Hopefully I am not fall asleep though...

--- 帖子 #485 ---
The two vertical lines were my entries just now. So far so good...

--- 帖子 #486 ---
The reason why I think the trend is gonna be TC downtrend is because of this candle @ H1 (see ellipse ). If I am not mistaken, it is a Shooting Star PA against 50sma , 89sma of H4 and closed just 2pips above PW 1.3950 . The PA (candlestick behavior) is always an important key in any technical analysis. Even this trade is just a demo, but I still really hope that I am getting the right judgement and a great FREE RIDE from my second entry earlier. Your comment/suggestion is appreciated.

--- 帖子 #487 ---
My 1st trade (entry @ 1.3918 ) hit the TP (@ 1.3830 )...!!! So now, I modified my 2nd trade's SL (from 1.4000 ) to it's entry price (@ 1.3911 = just a few pips above 8ema of H4 ) for a FREE RIDE...!!!! (zero risk trade). Now, I'll let the 2nd trade to take care of itself until Friday and will see whether it is survived or not. Even these two trades are just a demo, but I'm glad I did it right. 88pips worth USD880.00 already in the bag for just 3hrs++ of the 1st trading. Not bad Cheers...

--- 帖子 #488 ---
My FREE RIDE still okay for now even the pair found some support atm. Price is pulling back towards 8ema / 21ema of H4 (which is normally happened) before (hopefully) continuing the downtrend pattern. Okay. It is a waiting game now as I want to see how much I can get from this FREE RIDE (even it is just a demo) - or the right way to say is, how long this trade can survive? Patiently waiting now...

--- 帖子 #489 ---

Alright, Technically for today, we can see that there is quite a strong support from 50sma (D1) and price has been ranging between PW 1.3790/1.3710 for the last 12hrs. From H4 's view, I can explain only 1 thing:- 8ema and 21ema are trying to pull back the price towards them before the trend decided (in this case the downtrend is the favourite). In my case, I prefer to wait around less than an hour before the current H4 candle to close (sometime around 2300hrs++ of my local time) and will decided what I want to do next. Lower TFs (H1, M15 &amp; M5) are too NOISE for me atm. Any comment/suggestion is most welcome.

--- 帖子 #494 ---
I start to read you thread but you mostly showed your trades. Its interesting... great experience. Could you explain how to use all your indicators (MA, MTF MA, RSI, stochastic) point by point.

--- 帖子 #495 ---
Hello, By showing my own trades, it is the best to train myself and keep learning. The MA will give you the direction of the trend. If the price cruising above all the MAs, it is an uptrend market. Vice versa for the downtrend. This is the very basic concept of using the MA. They can be your support/resistance for most of the time. The MTFMA is for you to see the real MA reading from a higher TF from your current chart. As an example, from H4 below, I can see MAs from my D1 chart here (see the dashed line MAs there? 8ema , 21ema ans 50sma ). RSI is basically used in D1 as a reminder whether the market is overbought / oversold. Stochastic and momentum are normally indicate the EMOTION of the price. You can see from the H4 chart below, when the price dive, these 2 indys will go in sync with it. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #496 ---
The battle of price is now between the support level from 50sma of D1 VS resistance level from PW1.3790 .

--- 帖子 #497 ---
Thank you. Still reading )))

--- 帖子 #498 ---
It is clearly a downtrend for EU. For the last 12hrs, 8ema still dominating the price, and the price itself is strongly resisted @ PW 1.3790 for the last 32hrs...!!! A few attempts to break the support from PW 1.3710 (also held by 50sma from D1 - which is quite a strong ones) and the sup/res indy (see rectangle area) indicate 1.3670 is a hard level to be broken atm. Carefully if you guys want to SELL, because I still don't see a good signal here (PA) even though I predict the price might go to next lower PW @ 1.3630 . Will stay on the sideline and watching for now.

--- 帖子 #499 ---
SELL @ PW1.3710 with 80 pips SL/TP using 5min chart entry (see vertical line). Found good signals (PA) at H1 (bearish engulfing) and H4 (some kind like 3 inside down): PLEASE SEE THE RECTANGLES . Hope this turns out well...

--- 帖子 #500 ---
A clearer view from H1 (see BEARISH ENGULFING PATTERN in rectangle ). Entry (SELL) was made @ candle marked with vertical line. Comments/suggestions/questions are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #501 ---
This signal is selling into quite a strong demand zone, it's a higher risk, lower probability trade imho.

--- 帖子 #502 ---
Sorry for the later reply but I already fall asleep last night. Yes, I admit that it is not a high probability trade, but I also believe PAs based on H1 &amp; H4 were stands for something. So I like to give it a try.

--- 帖子 #503 ---
Okay, It almost touch PW 1.3630 (my TP) but I think it might go there today. Seems the support level @1.3670 as per H4 unable to hold the price from breaking it last night. Well, I am just gonna leave this trade with 50% risk by removing my SL 40pips lower from previous ones (Just the way I will do it if this is a real account as well). Getting back my 40pips now...yeehaa!!! Comments/suggestions/questions are most welcome. Cheers...

--- 帖子 #504 ---
If I wasn't asleep last night, I would have made another entry somewhere at the rectangle area because both stochastic and momentum was giving a very good signal (swing high) @ 50sma . This is a downtrend price so I would always favour this kind of set up from 5mins chart (vice versa if it is an uptrend). What a miss...

--- 帖子 #505 ---
Hi just found your thread - very interesting. I presume you trade this during the Asian session?

Another 80pips in the bag from this trade (3rd demo). The first one from my other Demo Account (in my wife's laptop) was the 1st 88pips gain of the week (see here:- http://www.forexfactory.com/showpost...&amp;postcount=487 ). Also, there is another FREE RIDE that's still gaining for more pips from my 2nd trade. Cool. Already bagged 168pips this week (excluding the one that riding for free atm). Comments/suggestions/questions are most welcome. Cheers.

Price is now making its attempt to break the 365ema @ H4 but I think we are going to have some real big support around the rectangle area (nearby 365ema @ D1 ), where the PW 1.3470 is waiting. Have to wait &amp; see until next week though... Comments/suggestions/questions are most welcome. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #509 ---
Okay, seems the market showing the rhythm atm as per H4 (see the ellipse area). Price is bouncing back towards 21ema (which is normally happened before it continues its trend) and getting a great support from 365ema . So I decided to do the trailing stops strategy by reducing the SL to 160pips lower (just nearby 21ema ) because I don't want to loose the potential pips just in case the market retest the PW1.3630 later on. Otherwise, it will be wiped later (could be) and nothing to lose either way. Another clean 160pips added in my account though. Cheers...

--- 帖子 #510 ---
My FREE RIDE has ended few hours ago. So, 160pips gain it is. I am enjoying this demo...

--- 帖子 #511 ---
The history so far...

--- 帖子 #512 ---
Okay, SELL @ the same candle of 5mins chart (see vertical line) @ 1.3702 (1st entry) and 1.3717 (2nd entry). Both using 80pips SL with TP equally set @ 1.3637 (just 7pips above PW 1.3630 ). The reason of selling is because PA (price action) @ 89sma of H1 is quite interesting (see rectangle ), supported by momentum @ its peak &amp; stochastic @ swing high position. The previous candle @ H4 is also a spinner with a very long upper wick against the 21ema , which can only tell me 2 things:- either the price fail/succeed in its attempt to break above this EMA later on. Please remember there is 50sma of D1 (previously was a great support level) will double team with 21ema of H4 as the resistance area. Let us wait &amp; see the result. It will be either double strikes/blows. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #513 ---
Modifying my 2nd entry's SL to the same level with 1st entry's SL @ 1.3782 to reduce some risk... Just another way to manage my trade when the confidence is only 50%.

--- 帖子 #514 ---
From a higher TF, we can clearly see what is the direction of the market. I believe we all have almost the same trend lines per the weekly chart below. Firstly, we look at the 1st TRIANGLE where the price broke below it and went downside. Then, we see the 2nd TRIANGLE where the same breaking down pattern has the potential to be repeated here. However, it may takes weeks/months before we know what we can get from this current triangle. Don't forget to see 2 arrows for each sup/res TLs. Also, see how the momentum and stochastic indicate the direction of this pair for the next couple of weeks. You guys know where they are heading to. The chart alone explain a lot. Comments/suggetions/questions are most welcome. Cheers and have a great weekend.

For those who visiting this thread for the first time, here is the list of the additional indicators you need to upload if you wish to use this system in your trading. Please let me know, if they are not working. Thanks.

--- 帖子 #516 ---
I would like to share the method I learned during fx seminar before. It is the from Easy Forex analyst expert. He only using 20sma &amp; RSI in his charting. But,I just a few more indys &amp; still keeping my PW in my chart. The idea is pretty simple: The market is downtrending if the price went below 20sma (based on D1 ). Vice versa for the uptrending ones. From D1, favour the BUY signal when RSI go below oversold level (10/20) and when the market is overbought (80/90), look for SELL signal. Please refer to the template given here, but remember to upload all the additional indicators given in the post #515 (above) if you wish to use this method in your trading. Comments/suggestions/questions are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #517 ---
Trying to be nasty here. Made 2 entries (SELL) @ 1.3685 per 5mins chart and another one @ 1.3693(see vertical lines) . Nice PA against PW 1.3710 per H1 (see rectangle ) and supported by PA (see ellipse )against 20sma of H4 (from the other method as I mentioned in post #516 ). Not sure this one gonna be alright or not. Just give it a try for triple strikes.

--- 帖子 #518 ---
Got stopped out...bad entries

--- 帖子 #519 ---
Just made another 4 entries to regain my losses today (see vertical lines of 5mins). Nice PA formation of H1 (see rectangle ): 3 INSIDE DOWN pattern. Also, good PA against PW1.3710 and 21ema of H4 (long upper wick of bearish candle). Hope this one doing well... Comments/questions/suggestions are most welcome. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #520 ---
Adjusting one of the trade with no TP because I am looking for a one free ride (if possible).

--- 帖子 #521 ---
So far so good. Will launch the FREE RIDE after the other 3 trades hit TP. Comments/suggestions/questions are most welcome. NOTE: Watch the 365ema carefully.

--- 帖子 #522 ---
These 2 trades (SELL) I made on last Friday (1st demo account) already hit the TP. 145pips in the bag from these 2 entries. Nice.

--- 帖子 #523 ---
Alright...going for FREE RIDE now since the other 3 entries will hit TP anytime from now on. Cool...

--- 帖子 #524 ---
Alright...I got triple strikes of TP from the 3 trades. Again, another 226 pips in the bag. Great...!!! The only one that left is for free riding. I am enjoying this.

--- 帖子 #525 ---
As I mentioned earlier, now there is a nasty price reaction against 365ema here (see ellipse)...!!! The price is currently retest this level (also PW1.3630 ) after the last rebounce and might get temporary support here again...but who knows...sometime the market rhythming so fine...sometime it just trending very fast. Just watch...and do not favour the BUYING (unless you have big guts to do that) since the market is downtrending atm.

--- 帖子 #526 ---
ATM, the price continuing its downtrend whenever it touch 89sma area (see ellipses ) but its also make a strong rebounce (rhythming) when it is landed on 365ema of H4 (see rectangles ). Depends on the PA (candlestick reading) and indys ( stoch / momentum ), you can take advantage by using Swing Trading method from these 2 situations. Use lower TFs ( 15m and 5m ) to refine your entry, but be sure to have tight both SL and TP since this kind of trading is very/extremely risky. Comments/suggestions/questions are most welcome. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #527 ---
Still riding good...freebies...

--- 帖子 #528 ---
I think EU will go down as low as fib 50% ( D1 ), or at least supported around PW 1.3550 . Previously, the price has broke below 365ema as in H4 (see rectangle ) &amp; PW 1.3630 has become a temporary resistance atm. Let's wait &amp; see how deep the price goes down. Comments/suggestions/questions are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #529 ---
Closing my FREE RIDE @ 61pips gain . The reason is because I see a good PA in H4 (see rectangles ), which could be the BULLISH ENGULFING PATTERN when the candle closed in about 1hr++ later. I might consider a CT (Counter Trend) trade because stochastic at both H4 &amp; D1 are making SWING LOW atm. The trend can change anytime by now (or at least making another bounce before it continues downtrend), but still need to be very careful since CT trade is very risky as well. Comments/suggestions/questions are most welcome. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #530 ---
I will give it a try for this one (CT trade). Made 2 BUY entries both @ 1.3616 with SL/TP 80pips from the price. I hope the bullish engulfing pattern will do me a favour. SL (1.3536) is well below the next lower PW 1.3550 , and TP is just 4pips shy from the previous PW 1.3710 . Alright then, let's wait &amp; see if this CT trade worthy or not? Who knows. Comments/suggestions/questions are most welcome. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #531 ---
Made another BUY entry @ 1.3609 with SL/TP @ 1.3536/1.3689 . Adjusting the first 2 entries' TP to 1.3689 also. Ok. That's it. Hope they doing good today, or else this CT trade is a big failure.

--- 帖子 #532 ---
These CT trades are not doing good currently. However, the price is now begin to ranging in lower TFs ( 15m &amp; 5m ), and I am thinking this could be the sign of the early rebounce. So hopefully if I am right, price will pullback towards 21ema of H4 (or at least 50sma of H1 ) later today. Also, I made a mini TL for H1 , 15m &amp; 5m viewing (see arrow ). Hope they bounce against this line. Comments/suggestions/questions are most welcome. Cheers...

--- 帖子 #533 ---
So far this TL doing a good support for the price.

--- 帖子 #534 ---
My CT (Counter Trend) trade has been wiped out today (3 entries). When the price break below the mini TL per H1 , I know they will be gone. Luckily, this is just a demo for some good reasons:- 1) Never trade during Asian session (as I did today &amp; the other losses before). Only make your move during the mid Euro and early US session; AND 2) Never CT trading when the trend is strong (even the signals like PA/indys/etc look so promising), especially when the price is so close to 8ema ( H4 ). Only consider the CT trade when the price has been move away from this MA &amp; expecting the price making a pullback towards this MA It is really good to made mistakes so that we can learn from it and improvise. Hope this helps you too. Comments/suggestions/questions are most welcome. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #535 ---
Alright, I am expecting a rebounce / pullback towards 8ema ( H4 ) once the price go down as low as PW1.3470 because this is the area of 365ema of D1 . Just be alert here.

--- 帖子 #536 ---
As I expected earlier, price definitely flat around this PW1.3470 &amp; 365ema (D1) area. Now, I am making an experimental CT trade again here since it is an MORNING STAR PATTERN (could be a MORNING DOJI STAR later on) made by the current H4 candle here. I am expecting a good rebounce from here. Made 5 entries (BUY) with SL/TP @ 1.3406/1.3568 . Let's wait &amp; see whether this one working or not, because I wanna get back my loses yesterday. Comments/suggestions/questions are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #537 ---
Meanwhile, I made a short term TL (see arrow ) for H4 &amp; lower TFs viewing. IMHO, if the price make a good break above this line, it could be determine the change of the trend. Let's see how strong this TL can resist the rebounce.

--- 帖子 #538 ---
Closing 2 trades earlier with 41pips profit &amp; reducing 50% the risk of the other 3 remaining trades' SL as this trade looks favourable atm. Also, as per H4 , it seems the resistance TL (see arrow ) has been broken, but I still cannot simply BUY since the price still below 21ema . Atm, we can only consider this move is just a normal pullback towards this MA. Comments/suggestions/questions are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #539 ---
It almost hit my TP (4pips shy) last night but.... Nevermind...I'll just let the remaining trades run because I see the previous resistance TL is now became a support for the price atm (hopefully). Tough trades though...

--- 帖子 #540 ---
Bagging 239 pips from these 3 trades. So,I already recover the previous 3 losses. Tough CT trade, but really worth it.

--- 帖子 #541 ---
Price manage to break the downtrend line (see arrow ) &amp; manage to make a strong pullback towards 21ema . Becarefull if you wish to LONG, because you need to consider a few things:- 1) The mid-term trend is stil bearish; 2) Many strong resistances upwards. As in order now, they are 365ema and 1.3655 area (see ellipse ) are waiting. Kinda tricky market atm,so I am just watching from the sideline. Will make my move if there is any good opportunity later, whether it is a SELL/BUY. Comments/suggestions/questions are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #542 ---
Remember this PA against 89sma ? See ellipses . Looks similar but it could be a different reaction this time. Watching...

--- 帖子 #543 ---
I didn't look @ this 3 OUTSIDE UP PATTERN earlier (see rectangle ) since my concern still with the resistances from 365ema &amp; 1.3655 area. My bad. Still, I am expecting a retracement from ellipse area before I can decide any convincing entry. Stochastic doesn't look favourable atm as the price trending very fast. "Trade the calm, storm the profit". There is always a good entry later on. Be patient.

--- 帖子 #544 ---
SHORT @ 1.3651 earlier with sl : TP = 36 : 40 because I'm expecting a short retracement atm. Entry is supported by off peak momentum &amp; swing high stochastic , both from H1 . A short lived trade though...

--- 帖子 #545 ---
My TP hit gain just now. Expecting the retracement correctly &amp; another 40pips in the bag. Cool... However, I think there will be uninteresting movement for tomorrow because the price still need to establish the trend (it could be ranging), whether up or down, who knows. Back to the chart, as I anticipated earlier, there is a great resistance within the ellipse area ( 50sma /1.3655/ 21ema of D1 ) atm. If I am right, the price will settle arround PW1.3550 ish for today. Comments/suggestions/questions are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #546 ---
Made 2 SELL entries @ 1.3627 &amp; 1.3634 with both SL / TP = 1.3774 / 1.3594 . Price making Double Top formation (see ellipse ) against 50sma of H4 &amp; still below 200sma as well, so I would like to give a little try &amp; error here. Overall, risk : REWARD = 87 : 73 . Another short lived trade which I would like to experiment here. Let's wait &amp; see the result later on. Comments/suggestions/questions are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #547 ---
BEARISH ENGULFING PATTERN (see rectangle ) was formed against 50sma from the previous 2 candles. Adjusting my 2nd entry's TP to 80pips target since I am confidence the price will go down later on. The r : R is now changed to 87 : 143 . Hope this trade successful.

--- 帖子 #548 ---
These entries got stopped out. Went wrong again this time.

--- 帖子 #549 ---
BUYING @ 1.3705 (2 entries with 5x vol. each) using 80pips SL/TP strategy. Decision is based on BULLISH ENGULFING PATTERN against 21ema &amp; 365ema (see rectangle ) . Let's see whether this one work out well or not. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #550 ---
Closing one of my trade just now @ 21pips gain. To redeem back the "money" I lost earlier &amp; to play safe. Strong bullish sentiment for EU atm. Will do the trailing stops strategy for the remaining trade if things looks better later on. Comments/suggestions/questions are most welcome. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #551 ---
A little concern from the upper side of the price atm. Be alert with resistance around ellipse area, the 365ema ( H1 ) &amp; 21ema of D1 (viewed from H4 ). Price might retrace towards 8ema per H4 before proceeding the uptrending price, because it is look like the stochastic &amp; momentum indys from both charts are at their peak. Anyway, I already adjusting the remaining trade's SL at 20pips higher to reduce the risk. Comments/suggestions/questions are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #552 ---
This trade got stopped out on last Friday. Bad/wrong decision.

--- 帖子 #553 ---
Made 2 entries (BUY) last Friday with 80pips SL/TP strategy. As per H4, I am now concern the ellipse area where the 21ema of D1 awaits. Also, the PW1.3710 remain a pretty strong resistance during the previous trading session. Could be a tough ride to the upper side since the price is still not establish a firm trend. C/S/Q are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #554 ---
Bag another 159pips of profit from these 2 trades. Per H4, price might retrace towards 8ema / 21ema (rhythmic) before it can push higher since there is 89sma , PW1.3790 and 21ema of D1 are tough resistances for sure. Be alert using lower TFs (H1/m15/m5). C/S/Q are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #555 ---
I am expecting the price will go to as low as ellipse area once it break below PW1.3550 , and it could slow down there for the rest of today's trading day since this area was the last low and where 365ema of D1 also became a strong support before. It is depends on the US session later on. C/S/Q are most welcome. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #556 ---
I didn't expect the price will go down this far. Per D1 , 365ema &amp; 89sma (support level) are broken so easily last night. Please look forward the 200sma and the support TL of the D1 (see arrow ) because if the bearish sentiment manage to push the price lower than these 2 supports, we might see EU will potentially go as low as 1.3130ish . C/S/Q are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #557 ---
I want to share something that I found just now, which is another way to make a fine &amp; early entry with risk : REWARD = 80pips (SL:TP=80pips:80pips). For me, this idea is only suitable for H4 chart. (The basic thing: Set both your RSI &amp; RSI bar in 8 days). Please have a look @ all vertical lines as the signal candle after the grey RSI Bar. Entry must made in the opening of the next candle . LONG when the signal candle gives GREEN RSI Bar . SHORT when the signal candle gives RED RSI Bar . From all 12 signals given per H4 below, 8 of them are successful trade. Considering that you trade all of them, your total nett gained will be 640pips within 25days (more or less). But of course, you need to consider the other trading rules as well before considering to make the trade such as res/sup levels, PW &amp; etc. Comments/suggestions/questions are most welcome. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #558 ---
What is the RSI indicator used here? Where to get it (for testing)? Thanks

--- 帖子 #559 ---
Open the RSI Bar first then you drag the RSI into the RSI Bar window. Set them both for 8 Days. Attached herewith is the indy. Regards.

--- 帖子 #560 ---
Thanks!

--- 帖子 #561 ---
MidnightRun...you are welcome. Something is going on here (see rectangle ). It has been 20hrs and the price still get a strong support from PW1.3310 . So becareful. Price is either rebounce towards 21ema (per D1 ) or break below the Support TL later on. Who knows. C/S/Q are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #562 ---
The yellow and blue indicator in the RSI window is stoch?

--- 帖子 #563 ---
Yes...correct.

--- 帖子 #564 ---
Happy weekends to all fx traders &amp; FF members. I don't do analysis for today. Will review the market again on Monday. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #565 ---
Using H1 RSI as filter to avoid False Signal from H4 RS I I will explain the above mentioned matter. Given here are the recent 2 signals taken from H4 (see vertical lines). The first vertical line is a false signal and the second vertical line is true. On the first vertical line , RSI from H4 giving the SHORT signal. However, when you drop to H1 tf, RSI reading is above 55 . No agreement between this 2 tfs. So this is the filter: It is a false signal . On the second vertical line , RSI from both H4 &amp; H1 indicating above 55 , so this is a true signal for LONG . Per H4 , waiting the RSI bar turning to grey , then green / red in the next bar, will take us for 8 hours minimum. This scenario sometime occurs only once in 1 day or 2 days, or 3 days, or more. So do not lose your attention when it appears in your H4 chart. Patient is the key here. Alright, that's all for now. C/S/Q are most welcome. Regards.

--- 帖子 #566 ---
Updating my template.

--- 帖子 #567 ---
"RSI from both H4 &amp; H1 indicating above 55" is 55 "the line in the sand" - meaning that if RSI is lower than 55 you do not go long? Thanks

--- 帖子 #568 ---
Above 55 , LONG. Below 45 , SHORT. Trade nothing when the bar turns grey (price between RSI 45-55). It is that simple.

--- 帖子 #569 ---
Based on H4 &amp; H1 , there is a fast down trending move not long ago. When this happened, use the 515 strategy (5min &amp; 15min charts) to refine your entry. I give two signals example here (see vertical lines ) from 15m . It is a fast down trending price, so only consider RSI below 45 after it turns grey . Drop down to 5m chart: Entries are made after the signal ( vertical lines ) here. Yes, that's the rule. Always wait the bar turns to grey , then red , before entering the trade. You must make sure the 5m signal is in agreement with the 15m . Vice versa if the price is going for a fast up trending. C/S/Q are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #570 ---
Here is another alternative for those who like to trade against the support/resistance (whether it is a breakout/rebounce/retrace). See dashed lines marked with arrows per D1 below. Since it is a down trending price atm, I use the previous resistances (see rectangles ) as the potential supports, and take only 1 recent support (see rectangle ) as the resistance. As we all know, price has memory &amp; it will always retest its previous lows/highs. You will be more alert once you highlighting this levels based on D1 , and viewing them on lower TF. As an example per H4 below, be more alert when the price come down &amp; retest the previous resistance @ 1.3518 , which now is the potential support. This level is just 8pips above the PW1.3510, just giving us another reason why PW (Price Wave) is also an important psychological level. All the way down, we still have 200sma ( D1 ) &amp; 1.2917 as the potential supports. Please remember these supports/resistances must be updated always once the sup/res indi provide a new ones in D1 . C/S/Q are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #571 ---
Updating my template...

--- 帖子 #572 ---
From weekly chart, we are now entering the critical zone (see rectangles ). Price has come back &amp; retest the 365ema area. But the real concern here is the zone between 2 previous sup/res indi, which is the price between 1.3333 &amp; 1.2587 . If the price manage to break below 365ema &amp; support TL by next month or two, we will see a long term major correction here. Anything can happened &amp; I could be wrong. This is just what I can see right now. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #573 ---
Goodmorning everyone, Missed early LONG signal this morning (since we are all asleep) from lower TF. Nice bounce off 15m's 50sma with RSIbar indicates GREEN after the GREY bar, and in agrrement with the 5m RSIbar. Okay, I wanna go jogging now. Keep in touch. Cheers.

--- 帖子 #574 ---
A "huge" bear candle (see ellipse @ H4 ) just telling us that price will definitely break 1.3159 sup (which is the previous res:- see rectangle @ D1 ) and can go as low as 200sma ( D1 ). Chances for looking a ct as the price need to bounce back towards 21ema of D1 is favourable when the price is around that 200sma . For the moment, bearish sentiment is too good.

--- 帖子 #575 ---
Maybe we will see a little rebounce towards 8ema ( H4 ) today as the previous sup of D1 is now become the immediate res. Based on PA of lower TFs, I'm yet to see a trend reversal here. I'm still favouring the bearish sentiment atm. C/S/Q are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #576 ---
We have 2 good SELL signals from lower TFs today (see vertical lines ). The first one is the best though. I think the price might retest the previous res of D1 @ 1.2918 today, just nearby the next PW, which is 1.2910 . Very bearish market for this month &amp; it could be a very long term major correction to the downside for EU. C/S/Q are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #577 ---
If there is a strong rebounce towards 21ema tomorrow, it is recommended to wait &amp; see whether the price make a solid closing above the immediate resistance @ 1.3159 . The major trend is still bearish, so thinking of BUYING to make some pips is not practical right now. I will rather wait the TC (trend continuous) rather than catching an early TR (trend reversal). See you guys again tomorrow.

--- 帖子 #578 ---
EU in the bullish sentiment today but becareful with the resistance @ 1.3159 / PW 1.3150 . Price will retest this area &amp; might retrace towards 8ema again before it can continue uptrend. Quite a tricky situation right now. C/S/Q are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #579 ---
Orange, What are the rosy levels on your chart? Thanks

--- 帖子 #580 ---
You mean the horizontal lines? If that's what you are referring to, it is the PW (Price Wave).

--- 帖子 #581 ---
Something new. Where can I read about the PW?

--- 帖子 #582 ---
I made it myself based on my observation. Been using this PW since 2years ago. I believe in normal market condition, major pairs, especially EU, has normal up/down wave 80pips in average. You can go to babypips.com to confirm this. Regards.

--- 帖子 #583 ---
For those who excited about the trend reversal (bullish), maybe here is a bit reminder what happened to EU in the major direction. MONTHLY We have a HUGE BEAR candle in November. So, it is not a good idea to keep your LONG position (if you do) in a long run. Also, price still below 8ema . WEEKLY This TF confirms that the pattern is repeating atm (see triangles ). Again, price is below 8ema . Bearish. DAILY It is normal if the price try to make some adjustment &amp; rebounce back towards 8ema / 21ema , even in this TF. See ellipse as the recent example. Becarefull with res @ 1.3159 (or PW 1.3150 ) for today. Also 8ema of D1 that closed @ 1.3227 yesterday. It is kinda tough to the upper side. C/S/Q are most welcome. Also, attached herewith is my latest template.

--- 帖子 #584 ---
Looking ahead for today is much awaited data, which is US NFP &amp; unemployment rate. D1 Repeating patterns (see ellipse ).A normal rebounce before the price decide to continue its trend or reversing. 8ema closed @ 1.3224 yesterday, 3pips lower than one Wednesday, which is @ 1.3227 . Not a strong sign of bullish sentiment. H4 On the upper side, 50sma making strong hold (around PW1.3230 ) so far. If the price fail to move higher than this, I think it will revisit nearby the recent low @ 1.3060 . H1 Watch out for the temporary sup/res here (see arrows ). It has been almost 12hrs the price resisted @ PW1.3230 . I am bias to the downside for now. We'll see what happened in the US session. C/S/Q are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #585 ---
Okay, D1 As I always mentioned, the pattern (see ellipses) is repeating. Price try to come back towards 8ema / 21ema . I am looking for an overbought signal (RSI) around next week onward &amp; might get opportunity to keep a long term of SELL position with entry around immediate res @ 1.3447 . The long term direction is still bearish. H4 Looking for a good retracement once the price touch 89sma/PW1.3390 area. Attached herewith is my updated template. C/S/Q are most welcome &amp; happy weekend to all of you.

--- 帖子 #586 ---
Orange, How do you use ATR? (I have come across various descriptions, sometimes conflicting sort of, so I am somewhat confused). Thank you.

--- 帖子 #587 ---
Here it is...

--- 帖子 #588 ---
I suggest you just use RSI atm. ATR suggest that it is the mirror image of the price but sometimes it didn't. So, just pay attention to RSI will be more than enough.

--- 帖子 #589 ---
Just a little more example from what happened during the NFP last night. See vertical line . 15m RSI turns green after the grey bar. Drop down to 5m chart, its RSI also above 55 prior to 15m closing. Enter (BUY) at the candle here (see arrow ). This should give you at least 40pips in less than an hour during the fast trending market. C/S/Q are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #590 ---
Something that I expected on next Monday....

--- 帖子 #591 ---
Per Daily , we see true resistance @ 21ema and the market has been bearish so far. From H4 , if the price manage to break temporary sup TL &amp; 1.3159 sup (see ellipse area) it will probably visit the last low @ 1.2968 sup . I went for SHORT just now. Let's see what will happened during the US session later on. C/S/Q are most welcome.

Got stopped out for this trade. Now I am watching 89sma of H4 (see ellipse area) because it resist the price yesterday. 3hours plus to go before the current candle closed &amp; opening of Euro session. Will see PA by then &amp; decide whether to enter or stay away. C/S/Q are most welcome.

You use my Price Wave (PW) as your guide? Or..you use my method?

--- 帖子 #595 ---
I used the wave tpl to confirm trades...... luv it....

--- 帖子 #596 ---
Owh..okay..cool...

--- 帖子 #597 ---
Short @ 1.3260 with 160pips SL/TP. Entry based on Daily. Great resistance done by 21ema so far. Will update again later.

--- 帖子 #598 ---
I am closing this trade with just few pips gain. Waiting for a better set up of entry using H4 or H1 later on. There will be a rebounce if the price need to continue downtrend. Just want to be cautious since we are @ Double Bottom situation per H4 right now. Plus, I need the price break below PW 1.3230 &amp; 50sma before considering it is convenience to SELL.

--- 帖子 #599 ---
Short @ 1.3266 after a nice PA against 8ema of H1 (see rectangle ). SL/TP @ 80pips. Hope this one doing good.

--- 帖子 #600 ---
Sorry...entry @ 1.3226 .

--- 帖子 #601 ---
Closing this trade with a few pips gain. I don't like the PA against 200sma of H1 (see ellipse ). Will be back for US session later &amp; hopefully there is good signal for entry.

--- 帖子 #602 ---
We get support from 50sma ( H4 ) atm but be aware of yesterday's 8ema ( D1 ) @ 1.3285 . No true sign of trending market yet. Expecting the price will be hold @ PW 1.3310 &amp; will see any opportunity from there again.

--- 帖子 #603 ---
Per Daily , we could have a bullish reversal pattern here as yesterday's candle formed as a doji. However, we still need to clear the 89sma (H4), temporary Res TL &amp; PW 1.3390 (see ellipse area) to keep open position for LONG. The Resistance of The Day is yesterday's 21ema @ 1.3385 . Also, attached herewith is my updated template.

Orange, A couple of days ago I downloaded your 515 template, and I see trendlines on the 4h and daily charts. Some of them do not make sense to me at the current state of the market. Are these templates self-updating depending on the price action, or were they just left on the chart when you posted your template and do not change with the market and should be removed? Also, on the weekly chart I see purple triangle appearing. What are they? Showing that a triangle is forming (or was formed?) Thank you

--- 帖子 #605 ---
Hello MidnightRun, Some trendlines are for longer term, some are only for temporary. If they do not make sense to you, you can adjust them whichever you feel suitable. When I updating my template, I am updating my TLs most of the time. The purple trianlge on the weekly chart suggest that we might experience the same scenario there. The first triangle showing a break below for a long run of downtrend. Therefore, I am expecting the similar break out from the second triangle. This is the way I look the chart in different TF, but it doesn't mean it fits your charting style. It is optional. Regards.

If this EVENING STAR formation (see rectangle ) of H4 confirmed when the recent candle closed around 2hrs++ from now on, I will not hesitate to SHORT. My decision will be depending on the candlestick behaviour of H4 &amp; H1 later on. Need to becarefull as there is 50sma (or 200sma of H1 ) made a good support yesterday. Also be aware of temporary sup TL per charts below. C/S/Q are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #607 ---
Technically, there will be 2 possibilities after the recent candle of H4 close as a major bear candle (if). First: It will be followed by another bear candle (free fall) for a TC. See ellipse . OR Second: It will be a rebounce (adjustment) a.k.a. rhythmic PA before it continue down trend (see rectangle ). Four our case now, we are dealing with 50sma atm. Do not underestimate this MA because this is where the price get it strong support yesterday. So, always becarefull here. C/S/Q are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #608 ---
Here are the sup / res TL of the week (see arrows ). If you see your Daily chart, we get strong support from old sup/res indi @ 1.3159 (see arrow ). To the upside, immediate res @ 1.3422 is solid as well. What a tough week we had. Hope there will be a huge breakout next week. Attached herewith is my updated template. Happy weekends fx traders.

--- 帖子 #609 ---
It seems that we still having a tough time for this pair. Even though it already break above Daily res TL, we still need to pay attention to the previous res level @ PW 1.3310 . I guess that this scenario is normal during December. No obvious trend atm. Market just ranging between PW1.3310 - PW1.3230 since 8th of Dec. Attached herewith is my update template as I updating new temporary sup TL (see thin black line per chart below). C/S/Q are most welcome.

A very interesting area to watch now (rectangle) .

--- 帖子 #611 ---
I am looking for LONG entry somewhere around rectangle area here. Expecting the price make pullback nearby/towards 8ema (H4) and find support there. Entry will be based on lower TFs (5m &amp; 15m). There will be some red data from US today so it should be a good day for trading today. To update again later.

Orange, Are the waves coded to appear only on the EUR/USD charts? (I open your 515 template on GU chart and the waves do not appear, wile they do on the EUR/USD chart). Thank you

--- 帖子 #613 ---
Yes... this system &amp; this PW are for EU only. I don't trade nor study GU because of the spreads (3). However, you can do your own waves for GU &amp; AU (80pips) but you must know where are their significant levels. Hope this helps.

--- 帖子 #614 ---
H4 It seems that the previous candle has break above daily res @ .3422 and making a new high which currently resist by PW1.3470 &amp; 365ema from both H4 &amp; daily. H1 Loads of resistance from above which explain why the price could retrace as low as 21ema. But PW1.3390 could be a good place for LONG entry.

--- 帖子 #615 ---
Yesterday the Daily candle closed as EVENING STAR pattern (see ellipse ), which is a sign of reversal trend (uptrend flag atm). However, I will not fancy to hold my position (or even to trade) since this month is quite difficult. We are still in the triangle of ranging zone, and per H4 there is no solid trend atm. Daily still shows downtrend but H4 is vice versa. It is flagging up for sure, but we still have loads of resistance on the upper side compare to the lower side of the price. Decision is yours...

--- 帖子 #616 ---
Sell @ 2 entries after the previous H4 bar (marked with vertical line ) indicates RSI &lt;45 . First entry @ 1.3299 &amp; second entry @ 1.3319 . Both SL @ 1.3369 (higher than today's opening) and TPs are both @ 1.3259 . Not a good r:R ration because I am aware of temporary sup TL per H4 (see arrow ). Let see how this work today. C/S/Q are most welcome.

--- 帖子 #617 ---
Closing my trade before it hit my SL. Should have seen this 200sma of H1 (or @ 50sma of H4 )and spinner seriously just now. Alright. I really don't like the market ranging atm. Should stay away from the trade for this month. Only doing some analysis should be okay.

--- 帖子 #618 ---
A simple, but still a very useful template for me. Here it is....

--- 帖子 #619 ---
Good day everyone... Starting from this week, I wil present my weekly review as our guide. I will post my first weekly review later today. For sure, no trading from this week until 2011 January's NFP as trading volume will be very thin.

--- 帖子 #620 ---
See rectangle for last week's event. Per H4 , the market only ranging between PW1.3470-PW1.3150 (&gt;320pips&lt;) during the whole week, and it was tight IMHO. Here is the immediate sup / res for this week:- 1.3141 / 1.3278 (medium range) OR 1.3032 / 1.3232 ... 1.3302 ... 1.3446 (wide range). These are my guides for this week. Hope it helps you guys. C/S/Q are most welcome.

This is the final week of 2010 weekly review. See rectangle for last week's PA. As per H4 , price is just ranging around 100pips (more or less) last week and I am expecting the same behaviour towards this end of year. In D1 , EU still get strong support from 200sma and as long this MA hold the price, there is very little chance for down trending price. Here are the sup / res for the week:- Medium range: 1.3034 / 1.3163 &amp; 1.3201 Wide range: 1.2968 / 1.3422 &amp; 1.3497 HAPPY NEW YEAR 2011 to all of you... -Cheers-
